From the spate of problems you are getting I feel you have not read the
documents. Please follow the steps mentioned in the documents. When you face problem post details of what you have done rather than simply posting last error message.

As an example see how similar problem is posted here (and probably solved)

I understand it is being used, but I don't see a community following 
behind it. It will be helpful, if you can clarify the purpose behind 
BOSS Linux. Through the examples you have provided, I kind of get the 
idea that it is primarily meant for govt agencies who, IMO, typically 
require a local technical support.

Also, for privacy reasons, many people including me might be hesitant to 
give postal address. Is there a place where one could get a copy of BOSS 
Linux ?

My question was in relation to the "Vendors" tab they have on the 
website.. And, Since BOSS Linux DVDs are mailed home for free, I was 
just wondering if they have a list of places in chennai where one could 
collect it.

Dear all,

On behalf of ILUGC, myself conducted a two days workshop on FOSS in Idhaya
Engineering College for Women, Chinna Salem on 28 & 29th July. It was
attended by about 22 staff members from the dept. of CSE/IT.

The topic covered were -

Introduction to FOSS
Basic Linux commands
RPM Package management using YUM
For a given set of RPMs, how to build repodata and server packages over http
Apache Configuration
Samba / CUPS configuration
Kernel compilation
Virtualisation using QEMU
Using Dspace etc.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank the college management for the opportunity.

Subject: [Ilugc] Restrict attachment size for individual
Message-ID: <CANHPT+ousVC4dyKMq2+9-OMxsaoYaoLPumXiGgK=coi_F7hWNw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends,

I am working in an MNC. in which they are asking me to configure a new mail
server with open source softwares.

I have evaluated zimbra 7.1.1 (Open source edition)for about 2 weeks and now
I and our seniors are mostly liking to go with zimbra.

The only issue we are facing in it is we cannot restrict mail attachment for
individual users. for example our Manager, VP, TL may want to send mails
with attachment of about 15MB. and others
should not be able to send mails with attachment over 5MB. Is there any way
to configure such things.

I googled for this but i cant find answer. even I posted a question in the
forum but no response.

I came to know that zimbra internally uses postfix as MTA. is there any
option to hard code postfix to apply the above settings.

thanks in advance

If you want all the goodies in zimbra you have to pay for it.

IIRC, postfix can strip attachments.   IMO, the best place would be to
RTFMs of postfix and join the postfix mailing list to clarify your
doubts.

You can't use poweroff?

Linux does not even come with gcc or make

Anyway if you use Debian which is more sensible than Ubuntu I don't think
 you will need to install any package for this.

I would consider this as being quite basic.

What about halt?

      In Debian, we can use apt-file to find the packages. In Debian
Squeeze, this is what I get.

bala at bala:~$ apt-file search sbin/shutdown
sysvinit: /sbin/shutdown

Zimbra uses postfix. The parameter u r looking for is

mailbox_size_limit (default: 51200000)
       The maximal size of any local(8) individual mailbox or maildir file, or
       zero  (no  limit).   In  fact, this limits the size of any file that is
       written to upon local delivery, including  files  written  by  external
       commands that are executed by the local(8) delivery agent.

       This limit must not be smaller than the message size limit.

Have you tried here?

Specifically <http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=contents&keywords=shutdown&mode=exactfilename&suite=stable&arch=any>

Have a look at policyd[1]. Accounting module[2] might be the same as
you're looking for.

In Ubuntu it's in the upstart package, as has been pointed out by others too.

Thanks everybody. :-) In synaptic search by installed path isn't available
and I assumed it would be the same with underlying apt/dpkg system too.

It is. I never said this command was not available in my system. I merely
wanted to know the package name it is in. GNU/Linux is not as bad as you
would like to portray.

This interface is the best, but if you can enter the URL yourself, you
can try:

http://packages.debian.org/file:/sbin/shutdown

Message-ID: <CAH2vYhpfGG-dh5=cE_YCV_tMT5+O5igWP2WidjPbSGUgjwmyQA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am in need of configuring squid proxy server just to block Internet for
specified machines in my network, content filtering and site blocking for
our institution in working hours. (Don't want to use the above facilities
from my router) In other times all machines can connect to Internet without
any restrictions. I am trying squid with Ubuntu 10.04 with two NICs in my
server. My Idea for network setup is

Internet line  ----> My Proxy server  -----> My internal router  ----> My
LAN machines.

Is the setup is correct.

If I keep my proxy server as one of the machine in my LAN like this

Internet line  ----> My router  ----> LAN with proxy server.

Then I may need to configure proxy in all user's IE and firefox. and the
user's may change it when they need. so I think first method is correct. is
it?

My proxy server has two NICs in that I am trying to configure WAN in eth0
and the connection to router is through eth1. so that nobody can connect to
Internet without proxy.

How to do this? any idea. please help me.

Sometimes I enter URL myself, but I think this will be most useful while

Yes this setup is not wrong at all.

This is usually the preferred setup if you have a switch behind it.

Not if you use transparent proxy. But, it can't handle https.
Otherwise run your proxy server on port 80 and use that machine as the
gateway.

You should do some work on your own and come back if you're stuck at
any point. Also, you might want to look at firmware like dd-wrt which
would allow you to do this on the router itself.

No. This is a known problem even when MS Word opens OO files. No
option but to reformat afresh.

+1. We are willing to help but please do some groundwork. There are
many Howtos available for Squid in tldp.org. Most of them should get

Dear Friends,

Recently AU-KBC/NRCFOSS have sent proposal to various colleges to establish FOSS Lab Server for conducting FOSS Lab CS2406 and it costs Rs. 20,000.

On another hand, Mr. Bhaskar and team are doing it virtually free of cost for limited number systems and they would have established in more than 200 colleges.

Do you think AU-KBC/NRCFOSS installation cost of FOSS Lab Server? is worthy enough?? Do they provide something more than the latter?

Kindly give suggestions.

Do you mean converting units like foot, metre etc., try units. man units will throw more light on it. It is part of Unix/Linux for a long time.

The calculator utility coming by default with GNOME can do this amazingly
well. (Want to convert Light year to nanometre? ;-)

Please be careful next time, when you copy-paste logs. My first word of 
advice would be to change the mysql root password immediately, even if 
you don't care about it right now, because they tend to come back and 
bite your *** later.

I am no MySQL expert but I think you are facing authentication problems. 
By default, I have noticed mysql doesn't have any password for root, so 
you can try running "mysql -u root" to check if it is password protected.

I have Ubuntu installed. But I don't see any converters except for
currency converter in the Financial  mode. Maybe I need to install an
extension /plugin??

No plugins needed. Which version are you using? I'm using Natty; I just now
checked and it was working.
App version is "gcalctool 6.0.1".

By default it displays degree to radian convert option and might be mistaken
for deg/rad selection button in scientific calculator.

Sample resume? What for?

What is your qualification? You don't mention it.

Good.

Keep attending interviews looking for ads in newspaper and elsewhere and try to
 move through contacts.

But you need a resume. There are some good resources in the Internet that help
 you with resume design.

Essentially you should focus on your skills and projects and
educational background.

Make it short and sweet and write in flawless English and pray to God.

Best of luck.

Suggest you spend some time/effort into writing your own resume. There
are several websites which teach you resume writing best practices.

Message-ID: <CALJ7LH_Ea9sP2YTSAu+1yxaBFN8+Xj0jQyoDDYFYQwfkMSx9vw@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Hugin

What it is:

Hugin is a panorama photo stitching program. Essentially, Hugin is a
GUI frontend for Panorama Tools. Stitching is accomplished by using
several overlapping photos taken from the same location, and using
control points to align and transform the photos so that they can be
blended together to form a larger image. Hugin allows for the easy
creation of control points between two images, optimization of the
image transforms, and much more.

To know more about it:

http://hugin.sourceforge.net/

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install hugin

Message-ID: <CABuMF3KTMXBLmd+_f4Cbx-_LkNw6a5LS3e005JfhOpJBoxCK3g@mail.gmail.com>

I am using Ubuntu 11.04.
I am behind a proxy with authentication to connect to the Internet. I
had set up the system-wide proxy via System Settings. But Synaptic
Package Manager did not take the proxy. So I configured the settings
in the Synaptic for the proxy and auth. It worked.

Now the proxy's username and password got changed. I updated the
proxy and auth in both Synaptic and System-wide settings. But when I
reload or install any packages in Synaptic, it is now throwing this error.

"Failed to fetch http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/
binary-i386/Packages  407  Proxy Authentication Required"

Then I tried setting the http, ftp and https proxies in /etc/apt/apt.conf
file in the format.
Acquire::http::Proxy "http://username:password at proxy:port/";
Acquire::ftp::Proxy "ftp://username:password at proxy:port/";
Acquire::https::Proxy "https://username:password at proxy:port/";

Now I tried apt-get install. It also threw the same error.

Note that there is no problem with the proxy server, as I am able to
access the Internet via Firefox.

Could anyone help on this ?

Thanks

Dear Friends,

Last Monday, I was invited to give a guest lecture on FOSS by Mrs. Mythili Prakash, Asst. Prof., Computer Sci. Dept., Shri Sundarlal Shahsun Jain College for Women, TNagar, Chennai.

Nearly 60 girls from BCA course attended along with 5 faculty members. I conducted quiz based on my presentation to assess participant and gave a book on "Linux in easy steps by McGrath" to the winner. In the end, I distributed Fedora-15 LiveCDs and Install DVDs.
I encouraged them to join ilugc and participate actively in it. 

As a outcome of guest lecture, I received a call from them next day and they are willing to implement Moodle based LMS in their college. I directed one of my faculty member to help them.

Slides of Mr.Bhaskar from LinuxExpert with snapshot of various applications was also used for presentation.

Regards,

Benedict J. Nicholas,
Senior Lecturer, C.S.E Dept.,

Dear Mr. Benedict,

first of all - hearty wishes for a good job done.  keep it up.

i could feel the worth of your presentation - how good it would have
been, even without coming there, just by reading your post.

Post is very clear, using simple words, straight, and also breaking
the points into seperate paras, which makes it easy for understanding.

Why I mention this ????  because I feel, though there are some really
really very good people who have excellent knowledge, sometimes they
dont take this extra time (just few seconds extra) to reply or even
post properly for anyone to understand clearly.

thanks for the work at T. Nagar school, and also for writing a post -
clearly. I appreciate both.

with warm regards

Hi,

As we started publishing manuals on Muktware a few months ago. We just 
published a detailed Arch Linux manual. The manual is targetted at those 
users who want to try it but fail to do due to lack of easy manuals. 
ArchWiki is an excellent source, yet we needed simplifications.

I hope it will help users.

Create another user using the command 'adduser'
login with the new user and check the GUI.

If it works, then you can restore the default settings of the first user by
deleting the following folders.

rm -rf /home/<username>/.gnome2
rm -rf /home/<username>/.gnome2_private

then login in GUI and check it.

Update us with your results.

Application: PING- Partimage Is Not Ghost

What it is:

PING is a live Linux ISO, based on the excellent Linux From Scratch
(LFS) documentation. It can be burnt on a CD and booted, or integrated
into a PXE / RIS environment.

Several tools have been added and written, so to make this ISO the
perfect choice to backup and restore whole partitions, an easy way. It
sounds like Symantec Ghost(tm), but has even better features, and is
totally free.

Features:


    * Probably the best available Linux toolbox for rescuing a system;
    * Backup and Restore partitions or files locally or to the network
(MS Network Shared directory, NFS, FTP or SSHFS);
    * Backup and Restore the BIOS data as well;
    * Either burn a bootable CD / DVD, either integrate within a PXE /
RIS environment;
    * Possibility to Blank local admin's password;
    * Create your own restoration bootable DVD;
    * Partition and Format a disk before installing Windows (so to
make sure your unattended Windows installation will happen on the
right partition);

"ps -o" can produce output in fixed width format.
You will then need to convert it to csv.  See "man ps".

Folks who have been wanting to put some solid hours behind one of their ideas, and build something working out of it, now have an opportunity.

Time and time again, we meet two sets of people. First, the types who believe that they had come up with great ideas (such as Google) even before Google came up with it. And then there are the second types, who arent able to commit a fulltime association with an idea which isnt validated yet.

In50hrs, is an event, that helps such folks with ideas, to take the help of developers (even better if you can code as well) and Demo a working version of their product before the weekend is over. The Product built becomes a great way to see if there is legs to your idea, you can stop saying "Imagine if" and start showing people what you are working on. If it does have legs, then its easier to make the leap into it.

Going by what we saw last time, its an awesome way to mingle with likeminded product guys, get feedback, learn and most importantly build something. If you haven't registered already, visit http://in50hrs.thestartupcentre.com and do so.

If you have, be a sport and send a shoutout on twitter, with the hashtag #in50hrs.

Hope to see you there.

       I guess RFCs are the best documents to learn protocols. They
have sufficient examples, and if necessary ASCII diagrams. Have you
already tried them ?

           If you can give some more details on what exactly you are
expecting, may be someone can help better. For eg. this email has the
subject SNMP. Which aspect of SNMP do you need help with ? Thanks

Does apt-get work from command line? Did you check again if you have
updated username and password in Synaptic? Also, have you checked for
typos?

          After updating apt.conf with the proxy details, did you do a
sudo apt-get update before trying apt-get install ? Also, do you have
env variables http_proxy configured ? If yes, that overrides all other
proxy settings. So, if that is having the older credentials, that
might cause the issue. Check that as well. Thanks

No, apt-get is not working from command line. Yes Synaptic config is
correct. No typos.

sudo apt-get update throws the same error.

Those proxy variables were unset already using this command.
unset http_proxy
Hope this is the correct command.

Hi all,
I was invited by Dr.Anita Mary, Dean/CSE Department,Prathyusha
Institute of Technology and Management, Tiruvallur to conduct workshop
on Perl, Python and PHP to the IIIrd year CSE and IT students. The

students participated each day sessions.
The Lab was setup with Debian Lenny. Students were taught of working
with Perl, Python, PHP and mysql. Also the environment was setup in
such a way, students installed the necessary packages like
python-mysqldb, apache, php etc., as when it was needed.
Each day session was quite interactive.
I thank Dean/CSE Department and the Management of Prathyusha for
organising the workshop

Thanks

I concur with the view that RFCs are the best place.

But for beginners it will be overwhelming. There are also some short pithy RFCs.

What L2 and L3 protocols do you want to learn?

L2 STP or Bridging?

L3 routing protocols? Like RIP, OSPF or BGP?

Or MPLS?

I don't know how many of you are already aware of the Opensource
Project Fedena - http://www.projectfedena.org/

Fedena is recently selected by Government of Kerala, India to automate
13,000 schools with 7million+ students. I guess it is one of the
largest implementation of a Ruby on Rails code in education sector.

The project is named as "Sampoorna" - http://sampoorna.itschool.gov.in/
News - http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/digital-super-highway-connecting-schools-soon/760209.html

This project is into the final stages and expect a huge fan-base of
ROR in Kerala. The IT at School department of Government of Kerala is
notable for its achievements related to supporting FOSS

Hi,

Another people funded Free Software project. They are targeting 25000
dollars and currently have 19000 dollars raised with 3 days to go. I
hope some of you would be interested in seeing this project succeed. I
pledged 35 dollars. You can pledge as small an amount as 1 dollar
(about 45 Indian rupees).

hi,

tried to install boost in Ubuntu 10.04, but keep getting the message
boost >= 2.30 not found. I installed every single package with boost in
the name, still no joy. I did notice that Fedora has a package called
'boost', whereas ubuntu does not have a package called 'libboost'. All
the packages are 'libboost-*'. Any clues?

Hi gurus,

Boot linux without bootloader is possible

Default boot sequence BIOS->MBR->grub->Debian.
I had tried put changes MBR directly boot without bootloader its possible.

BIOS--->MBR(some changes)--->booting process

In qemu emulator set some argument is possible to boot machine.
qemu  -M versatilepb   -kernel vmlinuz-2.6.28-versatile -hda
debian_final.img -m 256   -append "root=/dev/sda  mem=256M
devtmpfs.mount=0 rw" &

If it's possible in x86 machine, please guide me.


Did I learn something today? If not, I wasted it.

If you building something that needs boost, installing libboost-dev should help.

FYI,

$ ls 1.csv
ls: cannot access 1.csv: No such file or directory

I am not sure whether i understand you correctly but if you want to skip 
the loader screen and boot default, just set the timeout to 0. AFAIK, 
you need a bootloader to boot whichever it may be.

Yes, this is how it works, in MBR we have the bootloader like GRUB.
BIOS->GRUB stage 1->grub stage 2->linux kernel

But directly booting Linux kernel without a bootloader is not possible. This
is partly because the kernel doesn't want to handle low level details that
the bootloaders can do. The bootloader has to set up the stack and put the
kernel arguments in a standard memory area and load the kernel.

In this case Qemu itself acts as a bootloader, so we don't need another
intermediate like GRUB.

I don't have enough info to say what exactly is wrong here but my guess 
is, you overwrote your MBR. you can easily add PCL as another boot 
option to your current opensuse grub.

mount the PCL boot partition and find the entry for PCL, 3 or 4 lines, 
in /boot/grub/grub.conf or menu.lst. add that entry to opensuse's 
/boot/grub/grub.conf or menu.lst.

Subject: [ubuntu-in] Case Study: Ubuntu is providing networking to Rural India
To: ubuntu-in at lists.ubuntu.com


They have setup broadband network in Dharamsala and in places where
there are power problems using WiFi routers, solar cells and Ubuntu.

Airjaldi?s is providing broadband services in rural India where
terrain is difficult, the population is sparse, and financial
resources are scarce. Success depends on keeping overheads to an
absolute minimum ? and there is no spare budget for costly,
proprietary software.

Instead, the company powers its Network Operations Centre (NOC) with
free, open-source software Ubuntu Server. To further reduce operating
costs, Airjaldi uses Ubuntu on its workstations, where its simplicity
and ease of use are great benefits for employees.

If you are using Ubuntu in interesting ways or have significantly
large deployments, do let us know!

Subject: [Ilugc] [ILugC] Low battery power management problem in Laptop
Message-ID: <4E44A311.3080302@gmail.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

I'm having this weird problem. I don't know if anyone has come across this.

The situation is as follows:

1. Laptop (not on power) runs low on battery
2. Warning dialogue pops up saying the system will Hibernate if I don't
plug in. I ignore the warning. ( No clicking OK or Cancel )
3. Multiple warning dialogues pop up one after the other. Ignore them
all .. Don't close or click buttons.
4. Critical warnings pop up ( n number of times )
5. System hibernates. I plug it in and then switch it on.
6. I give the password. The system is live. I can see all the warning
dialogue boxes still open.
7. Again hibernates abruptly. I switch it on..
8. Again and again it hibernates as many times as the number of critical
dialogue boxes that popped up.

I drained most of the battery and then switched it on ( not on power) to
test it. I got only two critical warnings. And then it hibernated
exactly twice.. I can replicate the problem in my Dell Laptop with
Ubuntu LTS 10.04 installed with all the latest updates.

I kept an application open just in case.

Here are my power settings while on battery:

* Never put computer to sleep
* When battery is low, hibernate.
* When lid is closed, suspend.

Is this a Gnome problem or an Ubuntu problem? Any clues??

While it may not be the direct solution to your problem, can you try
and install powertop <http://lesswatts.org/projects/powertop/> (should
be available as an Ubuntu package) and check what are the tunables
that seem to be causing battery drain. ?

Application: Prism

What it is:

Prism is designed to create a better environment for running your
favorite web-based applications. Much of what we used to accomplish
using an application running locally on our computers is moving into
the web browser. Thanks to advances in web technology, these apps are
increasingly powerful and usable. As a result, applications like
Gmail, Facebook and Google Docs are soaring in popularity.

Features:

* Access web apps from system taskbar or dock
* Tray icon and dock menus
* Associate applications with browser links
* Rock solid web app stability
* Run applications automatically when your computer starts
* Minimize to tray
* Popup alerts

Hello everyone,

C42 Engineering is looking for talented and passionate programmers.

You *do not* have to have prior experience in Ruby or Rails to apply - all
we care about is that you enjoy programming and that you're good at it.

Here's an extract from our careers page[1] - if you fall into one or more of
these categories, you'll probably fit right in.

  * You care about writing code, and writing it well
  * You are a polyglot programmer and are comfortable with several
programming languages
  * You are passionate about products and product development
  * You test drive all your code
  * You are familiar with eXtreme Programming (XP)
  * You contribute to open source projects
  * You love both teaching and learning, and take pleasure in getting better
at what you do
  * You want to work with like minded, intelligent people you can have a
real conversation with
  * You aren't overly fond of conformity, especially in the context of being
a faceless cog in a big company
  * You value decency and integrity, and prefer working with other people
who do so too

Here's a quick outline of the company:

  * C42 Engineering is a 1.5 year old boutique Ruby and Rails consultancy.
  * We follow an Agile/XP setup where we test drive all our code and pair
program throughout.
  * We have nascent product and training arms.
    ** We did our first public training session[2] last month.
    ** We are on the verge of launching the beta of our first product.
  * We are deeply involved in the Ruby community.
    ** We contribute to open-source via both our own projects[3] as well as
patches to existing projects[4] like RSpec.
    ** Our top three open-source projects combined have ~350 watchers and
~50  forks.
    ** We speak fairly frequently at various conferences[5]. Our talks have
been accepted at the international RubyConf for two consecutive years now.
    ** We were one of the sponsors of RubyConf India[6] and we are committed
to supporting this event in the future.
  * We obsess over integrity and transparency. Internally, all finances and
salaries are open.
  * We pay extremely competitive salaries. As we say on our careers page, we
may not match top paymasters like Amazon and Google, but we're within
shouting distance.
  * We understand that snacking and hacking go hand-in-hand and so maintain
a fully stocked pantry.
  * We play video games.

For more information, please take a look at our careers page[1].

Thanks,
Sidu Ponnappa.

Most likely a gnome problem. I am on fedora and I find this package 
'gnome-power-manager' which seems to handle all the power related stuff 
on gnome session. If you find a similar package, can u try upgrading it ?

You can apply by emailing us at work at c42.in. My original post had a note at
the top asking
people to respond directly to me because I wasn't expecting it to be
x-posted further :)

Additionally, we'd appreciate it if you could include links to any personal
projects you've worked on. This
excludes projects to complete an academic requirement, or projects
you've executed as part of your job.

If you have a Github profile, it would help us if you included that too.

I find it surprising how come one misses OpenVista in this field which
runs in huge (army veterens) hospitals in USA and is blistering fast.
of course GUI enthusiasts may ignore it.

Hi Mr.Baskar,

Can you please share the correct URL for your company website.
When I tried so many times https://www.linuxpert.in/ I got only "bad request" error message.

How Can I learn more about your company & reach you.

It would be nice if you could share your correct phone number.

Thanks,
Selva.

audio formats and a lot more essential software that you may not use
directly but is important all the same.

Debian Community celebrates its 18th birthday

The Debian Project is pleased to mark the 18th anniversary of Ian
Murdoch's founding announcement [1]. ?Quoting from the official project
history [2]: ?"The Debian Project was officially founded by Ian Murdock
on August 16th, 1993. At that time, the whole concept of a 'distribution'
of Linux was new. Ian intended Debian to be a distribution which would be
made openly, in the spirit of Linux and GNU."

?1: http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.development/msg/a32d4e2ef3bcdcc6
?2: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/ch-intro.en.html


A lot has happened to the project and its community in the past eighteen
years. ?There have been eleven releases - most recently Debian 6.0
"Squeeze" [3] in February 2011 - and a huge amount of free software
packaged. ?The current "unstable" branch consists of more than 35,000
binary packages for the amd64 architecture alone - over 44GB of
Free/Libre Software! ?Throughout this history Debian has maintained its
goals of technical excellence, accountability, and above all freedom.


?3: http://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110205a

Of course that wouldn't be possible without the strong community which
has developed around Debian. ?Besides more than 1,000 Debian Developers
and Maintainers from all over the globe, there are in excess of 11,000
registered accounts for the Alioth collaboration platform, and that
doesn't even include all those people contributing with translations or
bug reports (and sometimes patches for them) and all those users helping
others via our mailing lists, forums and IRC channels.

?4: http://alioth.debian.org/


As a project, we would also like to take this opportunity to thank all
our users and contributors, and of course also our upstream developers.
All of them help to making Debian a great experience and a great project!


Across the world today, Debian Developers, Maintainers, Contributors and
Users celebrate our birthday [5] with small conferences, with virtual
parties, and even with parties in real life. ?This celebration is
organised by the community, and it's not too late to start a party in
your own city!

?5: http://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay2011

Users can also use the web platform at http://thank-you.debian.net to
express their thanks, and share pictures of their own Debian birthday
celebrations. ?If you post on Twitter or Identi.ca please use the hashtag
#thxdebian</tt>.


The Debian Project continues to welcome contributions in all forms,
from everyone, encouraging people to download, use, modify,
and distribute its source code in the hopes that it is useful.

I did not run the mount command - I am talking about the automatic

What user and group does that partition get mounted as?
Does that your user have write support?
Have you checked if it is mounted as rw or ro?
Also, what is the filesystem? If it is vfat, running fsck on that
filesystem might help fix it. I have seen vfat filesystem show up as
read only and get fixed on running fsck on it.

Hi,

Am planning to go in for a new laptop. I have done some research and to me
it seems the new MacBook Air (i5, 4GB, 13", 1.35Kgs, 128GB SSD) is a good
buy! Am going to use it for web development and am considering the following
options:

1. Make it a dual boot OSX and Ubuntu system
2. Use VirtualBox to run Ubuntu (and maybe even Win7)

Anyone here, who has gone through this, share their experience? Any specifc
pitfall that I should be aware of?

thanks,

OSX is a variant of Unix. you have all the tools you need for web dev. you
can use macports for installing any open source tools you need

mac os x with tools like MAMP or XAMPP, GIMP should be enough for web
development.

Weight is a big criteria for me and considering Toshiba Portege, which
weighs the same, costs 72K (with regular HDD), I felt its not bad. Also, I
need a mac because I have been getting feedback that my web app does not
work as expected in Safari (and even Firefox on a Mac!!!). Am also
considering a Vaio VPCSB26 - costs about 57K but have had a bad experience
with a Vaio a few yrs back.

No to mention that I have always been intrigued by the Mac UI aura. Mac

If you can source it from singapore, it will be a lot cheaper.

I bought my mac book pro for 58k(INR).

I use macports, but it is not same as your production server environment.

The versions of some of the libraries in production & development may not
match.
Its mainly dependent on the web stack you use.

As for me, i use node.js/mongodb and didnt really have any problem.

i do have the problem of firing up a virtual instance of windows to test in
IE(majority of users).

I had an ibook for three years. It is basically BSD - so no need even
for dual boot. All open source software including open office ran on it.
I never used all the fancy mac stuff on it so cannot comment. They have
something called (I think) parallels which one can run any number of OSs
at the same time. Fortunately for me, it got broken accidently so I was
able to get back to the wonderful world of linux.

I'll second Kenneth on OSX == BSD and that you don't really need
Linux. I've been developing on OSX since '08 for software that is
deployed to Linux servers with no problems. It's as good as a BSD box,
but with better user experience and it's also the finest hardware you
can buy in that form factor. It's expensive, though, but since I earn
my livelihood off it *and* use it for personal stuff, I find that it
was well worth the investment. I wouldn't at this point choose
anything else if I had to get a new machine.

You may want to purchase it in the US as that works out about 20%
cheaper and the warranty is global anyway. Remember to add the cost of
AppleCare to the price of the laptop while budgeting. Also, apple
branded hardware upgrades and accessories (mini-DVI to VGA adapter for
projectors for example) are expensive. You're allowed to upgrade RAM
without voiding warranty, and you can get a superb 8GB upgrade pack
for $85 in the US as opposed to Apple's $200 or so for a similar
upgrade.

Watch out for Apple support in India - all your requests will be
rejected and you're forced to escalate to customer relations to get
any replacements.

I was just going to suggest Mano to post in the Chennai.rb/BangaloreRUG 
lists, as there are more converts there :). I think you can take Sidu at 
his words, but personally, I never got the Mac religion.

I've used a few Macs and they're beautiful machines for sure, but they 
don't excite me in the same way that most 'hackable' devices do (I use 
an Android phone though I can very well afford an iPhone and hate my 
Kindle with a passion, so take my views with a pinch of salt) and I have 
problems with Apple's worldview delivering (admittedly beautiful) 
computing experience on what are essentially closed systems. If you'd 
give me the same money, I'd buy a ThinkPad X220 with SSD option and run 
Ubuntu (or Arch, if you're hard core :D) and run VirtualBox for Win7/Mac 
OSX needs, etc.

But that's just me, so the best option would be to borrow a Mac for a 
while (and setup your work environment on it) and see if you like the 
experience, and then spring for whatever you like.

Vamsee.

Hi, I am little bit confused about one issue. In fact, I am not that much
good in networking - frankly speaking.
So, here is the scenario:

My client want me to open the port 10050 withing ip range of 123.45.6.0/24and
123.45.7.0/24

But, IPs of those servers are different like:  111.222.3.49 - eth0
111.222.3.50 - eth1

So, here, my question is: how can I open some port + IP where my server's
IPs are different? Can anyone please help me out?

Oh, I should point out that I'd vote for the TP X220 over the Apple
too if you travel a lot. Nothing more robust than an ThinkPad.

> But that's just me, so the best option would be to borrow a Mac for a while (and setup your work environment on it)
Remember that it takes at least a couple of weeks to get familiar with
the new shortcuts and the trackpad. Better if you have someone to pair
with that you can learn the productivity stuff from because you'll
find yourself using them in ways which aren't possible on Linux or
Window. Without, you run the risk of getting frustrated (unless you're
diligent and stick with researching how to do stuff more effectively).

> (I use an Android phone though I can very well afford an iPhone and hate my Kindle with a passion, so take my views with a pinch of salt)
I'm actually with you on this point - I use an Android too, for the
same reasons. Between DarwinPorts/homebrew, however, I find OSX as
hackable as Linux for my purposes (I'm not a kernel person) and
developing applications for OSX is completely different from doing so
from ios from a legal/openness perspective. Something like 95% of the
application software I use is open source and my entire development
stack is off brew and so is open source too.

Best,
Sidu.

Dear friends,

The Central Government has on 11th April 2011, notified the new Information
Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011 prescribing various
guiding principles to be observed by all intermediaries. The rules cast an
obligation on the intermediaries to remove access to any content on
receiving a complaint from an affected person that it falls under the
category of a wide, vague list of ?unlawful? content specified in the rules.
This vague list includes content considered as 'blasphemous', 'libellous',
'grossly harmful', 'harassing', or 'disparaging'.

The new rules in the current form:

? - Lead to a clamp down on the freedom of speech and expression enshrined
? in the Constitution of India by providing for a system of pre-censorship /
? self-censorship by non-state actors;
? - adversely affect the right to privacy of citizens by allowing
? Government agencies to access their information residing with the
? intermediaries;

Its fun playing around and installing a lot of stuff but eventually you 
just end up using only things that are really needed. So, just get a 
laptop that just suits your needs. Additionally, the most important of 
all will be the service you get in India. Like one of our members 
mentioned, you might want to check the quality of Apple's service in 
India. And, Does Apple provide on-site warranty ? on-site warranty is a 
absolute must!

Also, SSDs are so overrated. It definitely makes the laptop lighter and 
reduces the power consumption but its not worth the price. I can't wait 
to see them replaced by PRAM/PCM based storage.

There are two parts to a connection, a client ip + client port and 
server ip + server port. Now, if you are hosting a service on server 
hosts 111.222.3.49, 111.222.3.50 behind a firewall, then the firewall 
needs to be configured to allow certain client IPs outside your network 
to connect to server.

If my understanding is correct, your client uses the IP range 
123.45.6.0/24 and 123.45.7.0/24. So, you need to configure your firewall 
to allow clients from this ip range to connect to your server on a 
particular port, which i am guessing is 10050.

Does this make sense ?

Actually they are using 192.168.x.x for private usage. I need to configure
these new  ( *here what he wanted: port 10050 within ip range of
172.22.4.0/24 and 172.22.5.0/24 on both of servers?) *172 range there in
server.

I understand the problem better now, can you give us the following details ?

1. What OS does the server run on ?
2. If you are running Linux, can you share the output of the command 
"iptables --list" ? (you need to run the command as root)

iptables currently indicate that the server will grant access to port 
443 (https) from anywhere, port 22 (ssh) from anywhere and port 3306 
(mysql) for hosts example.host.com, perform....info, 184...static.my.com.

so essentially, IMO, you have been asked to add a rule to INPUT chain so 
that, similar to the above ports, port 10050 could be accessed from 
hosts matching the CIDR 172.22.4.0/24 and 172.22.5.0/24.

A word of caution, If you don't know what you are doing with iptables, 
you can lock yourself out and cannot ssh to the machine. so, use them at 
your own risk.

The following link gives a basic idea of how you can use iptables to 
white list ip addresses.

http://library.linode.com/security/firewalls/iptables#sph_whitelist-traffic-from-specific-addresses

The examples they have provided in the link appends rule to the INPUT 
chain but your last rule in the chain is DROP (see above), so you will 
need to use the insert variant of the iptables command using the -I 
option to insert your rule before the LOG rule.

Hope this helps.

I have written a chat applicaiton(via terminal) using ruby 1.8.7 and i want
to produce a bell sound or any sound in terminal whenever i receive a msg

I tried to use 'espeak' but i get the following messages in terminal which
gets displayed in between the chats and totally messing up things.

I dont want these to be displayed in terminal and i wanted this to redirect
to some file.

I tried this command:


# espeak hi > temp

but again the message appears in terminal

If this can't be done is there any way to produce sound in ruby either by
using gem or using system commands?
Thanks in advance

if you need to run the command as root then the same thing should work. ie.,

sudo espeak hi > temp 2>&1

But if the file temp resides in a directory owned by root then try this,

espeak hi 2>&1 | sudo tee temp > /dev/null

Hi,

You may want to use a better code sharing app like pastebin or
something. I doubt if this line is correct. replace with scanf("%s",
infix) and see if that helps.

Thanks, everyone, for all the useful suggestions.

The change of environment that am comfortable with is defenitely weighing on
my mind! I did not know we can run Mac OSX in a virtual machine. Is it just
downloadable? In which case I'll check out ThinkPad X220.

Hows the service / support from Lenovo?

thanks,
mano

That'll hurt :-)

Suppose I make my Macbook a dual boot machine, does it void Apple's
warranty?

Leave the OSX in peace; use Virtualbox or VMWare and if you need everything
seamless.. pay for VMWare commercial version.

I've worked with guys who are pure mac addicts and use Windows and Linux on
paid VMWare as they write code that needs to work on all 3 platforms.

Imho, that's the best way to go.

Why'd you really need to dual boot it; in real work life you'll need to
access all of them simultaneously as you switch between tasks.

Probably.
The bundled audio visual apps which come along with any Mac is incredible.

You can make professional quality videos and audio projects with it.
Also, the sound loops and all come royalty free for commercial use.
And the quality is incredible.

If you aren't writing code for OS X and thinking of dual boot, you could get
a windows machine and use the extra money to buy an external moniter unless
you WANT a mac.

Haven't heard good things about Lenovo customer care. If you are ok with 
a windows/linux laptop then I recommend dell with the right coverage 
options. I have used dell since 2005 and I have availed their service 
several times and i have always had pleasant experiences except for one 
bad experience with a sales person.

To give an idea on what happened and how they resolved, All problems 
were fixed at my home.

- 2005 hard disk, clicking noise: hard disk replaced (2 days)
- 2006 got kingston memory & dell confirmed warranty not void
- 2007 video fan not working: fan was replaced (2 days)
- 2009 power input pin lose: AC adapter & motherboard replaced (2 days)
- 2010 one strand of hair went inside LCD screen: screen replaced
- 2010 a flying scissor and desktop monitor damaged: monitor replaced
- 2011 two defective graphic cards: both graphics card replaced

I usually get both warranty and accidental insurance since the insurance 
costs only a little more over warranty, atleast for laptops.

Hope this helps.

Thanks all for helping me out. The above thing works perfect. and can anyone
give me explanation of what it does? One is it redirects to /dev/null and

Not if you use Bootcamp, the dual boot software that ships with OSX.
The catch is that it is literally dual boot - only one other OS
besides OSX.

> If you are going to use the computer for web development, I would say don't buy Mac because it's too expensive for your requirement.
I'd differ with you on that point. I've been using my Mac almost
exclusively for web development and find it worth every paisa.

> I recommend dell with the right coverage options
Seconded, except that you'll *need* that coverage - the build quality
of Dells is atrocious. I used a Dell D620 for 3 years, and have a
similar list.
I know people with ThinkPads that have gone for three or four years
without any repairs at all. Macs aren't as reliable, but they come
close.

The fundamental thing that nobody has talked about is that Mac
usability clobbers Linux + commodity hardware in every sense. I'm not
sure why all Linux distros generally sucks in this respect, but they
do. There are a thousand small details that in isolation may seem
thoughtful but trivial, but put together result in a fundamentally
superior experience. The least explicable thing is that all the open
source applications on the Mac are fundamentally more usable and
thoughtful than the equivalents on Linux (and let's not even start on
Windows).

I'm not going to go on about this further on this thread, but Linux is
unfortunately the second best alternative for a *nix application dev
env if you don't factor in price. I want a reliable machine that I
allows me to stay focussed on my work while providing a good
experience. I don't want to have to mess around with X just to plug in
a projector or to have a dual display. I don't want to struggle with
crashing or sucky UI layers forcing me to drop down to the shell
whether I want to or not. I don't want to sit tweaking config files
and shaving yaks to do stuff that should Just Work. I appreciate
quality font rendering, mag safe adapters and the thousand other tiny
details that make my life easier or more pleasant, though these aren't
critical. And I want all this on a *nix environment. If I could get
this on a platform that is more aligned with my philosophical
preferences (as I do with Android) I'd pick it. But it isn't, and so
I'm a Mac user.

Best,
Sidu.

I agree with some of your points, but I would differ from the above point.
AFAIK, in recent (at least for past 1 year) versions of Ubuntu, connecting
projector and dual display is very simple and intuitive. You don't have to
mess around with any code, you don't event have to use command line; it's
just a matter of 2 or 3 clicks!

I have an Acer now (a TM 6292) and an Aspire One. Problem with both is that
it gets very hot - even the keys are hot to touch.

What model are you using? And what's your exp?

 I have an Acer Aspire 5745, with Ubuntu 11.04 and I use it for atleast 10
hrs a day. It hasn't got hot ever.

But, once I lock screen, it crashes most of the times and I need to restart
gdm to get the login screen. I'm not sure if this occurs only for this
model.

+1 for ThinkPad reliability. I bought (an economy model at that - R51e, 
if I'm not wrong) way back in 2005, and I've taken it on some really 
rough journeys home. I simply got bored after using it for 4 long years, 
and not one problem (but I'm usually a careful device user, so YMMV). 
Donated it to my sis, and she still uses it just fine (with a RAM 
upgrade) after the Compaq/HP she bought got bricked in about half the 
time. I'm more of a desktop user now and an Acer netbook does the job 
for my short trips, but if I had to pick a full-powered laptop, it's 
definitely going to be a TP.


Vamsee.

Hi Karthik,

   You could use Squid Analysis and Report Generator for the same purpose.
It is open source. Are you using it in some educational institution?

Dear all,

On behalf of ILUGC, myself conducted a two days FDP on FOSS in KCG
College of Technology, Karapakkam, Chennai on 18 & 19th August. It was
attended by about 15 staff members from the dept. of CSE/IT/MCA.

A subversion server was setup in the college to develop/host final
year projects in a collaborative environment.  All the above 3 dept.
have decided to insist the final year students to do their projects on
FOSS from the current academic year.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank the KCG college management for the opportunity.

Bit the bullet and shelled out 74K for a 13" MacBook Air with 128GB SSD.
First impression is pretty good. I think saying anything more would be
considered seditious on this list :-)

Much thanks to all for helping me make my decision.

So is the quality of dell product so bad, that mem was upgraded, HDD
had problem, GPU fan, etc. I thought product (not just PC) would be
one that runs for years without issues. Which is what thinkpads are
famous for. I think any good product should be running without major
issue for long time.

Get an external drive and setup Time-machine as your #1 priority and
sync everyday. SSDs fail frequently.

And what is this claim based on?  Most claims on SSD failure rates have been
shown to be exaggerations at best.  SSD lives, even pushed to max write
rates, have been shown to average 7+ years, which is higher than most
storages.

Personally, I've been using SSDs for backups and a MacBook Air and a MacBook
Pro with SSDs for the past couple of years and I've been quite impressed.
I've been fortunate enough to have had no problems, and both my machines
have traveled a fair bit and taken enormous beatings.

Not that I discount your advice on backups, of course, but in my experience,
SSDs perform rather admirably in both desktop or server environments.

According to co-founder of stackoverflow.com jeff atwood, SSD's are both
hot and can drive you crazy
http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/05/the-hot-crazy-solid-state-drive-scale.html

7+ years? what is your claim based on?

Arun SAG has already given the citation, but I might add one more bit here.
SSD is nothing more than a fancy big pen drive. Pen drives fail miserably is
my personal experience too.(I have never had one that lasted 3 years!) Of
course they are faster than other storage. Windows guys even introduced a
'feature' to use pendrive as swap space to increase swap speed.

phpinfo(INFO_MODULES);

It gives information of all the modules. You have to extract the Apache
information from it. I'm not sure if there is a way to get info for a
specific module alone.

May be.. if you look at it that way. But at the end of the day, any 
product can break and, in my opinion, a good service is a must and Dell 
provides that.

In the last weekend's rain, I think, one of the power lines got hit by 
lightning and there was a power surge. Both my UPSes went to overload 
and shut off for a brief second. The end result, I think, I lost a 
PSU/SMPS. One can argue that the 2 other PSU/SMPS survived while the 
Dell one died but these are extreme situations and I am happy that I 
will have the Dell technician visit today to replace it for me. 
Considering, I placed the service request on Sunday, I think this is 
good service.

Please do *not* top post.

"iptables" command line given the input data from the browser.

If my surmise is correct then you should really learn iptables o/w
you could screw up things pretty bad.

The docs @ http://netfilter.org/ are an excellent place to start.

Before anyone give you a workaround, you need to provide information
as to how are the two WiFi APs configured?

Good product is a result of engineering effort, while good service is
a management concept thing (more often than not). IMHO a good product
is one that has good design behind it. Not give a crap first and then
compensate it with after sales service. I mean a good engineered
product is much easier on the customer than support. Support involves
the support personal's mood at that time and also relies on his
knowledge of how to handle customer and his technical expertise and so
many other factors. Which i think is unecessarly put through the
customer. IMHO we should never be relaying on customer support unless
it is a extreme case like you mentioned above ( thunder stike ) . If
you going by support to evalute a product , i think that we have made
a wrong decision. technical specs and performace stats at worse
conditions and peer review are what i would consider as good criteria
for judging a product.

Its all my opinion though.

I have a question on Thinkpads since there have been numerous mentions of
them in this thread.

Thinkpads were associated with IBM and were known to be mean machines that
could run on and on.

Today its a Lenovo Thinkpad (and not an IBM). Has this affected the quality
of Thinkpads in any way? I am talking about the PRODUCT Thinkpad, not the
after sales service.

Thinkpads are still the same tech specs and same hardware as IBM
original producted it. lenovo is selling additional models of their
own brand (not thinkpad series, their own series) . I am using
thinkpad t400 and lenovo G560 and i am happy with both. I feel IBM has
doen justice to the product line by choosing lenovo as the successor.
lenovo is a worthy successor.

I strongly disagree.

Having used ssd's on server hardware for a few years now, I finally got 
an ssd drive for my laptop about a week back. This is an HP EliteBook 
2540p with 8GB ram and ( it had ) a 250gb 7200rpm sata disk ( its an i5 
machine ). Pretty much everything is faster on an SSD - and thats a 
massive productivity boost. Bootup time is down to 16 seconds from 40 
seconds, not a big deal since most people just do suspend / resume 
anyway. Battery life has gone up marginally too : 2hrs'ish to 2 hrs 45 
min'ish ( this is a year old laptop now, and the battery has been 
through a fair few power cycles, this machine is my main workhorse at 
home and work ).

the main killer feature of the ssd is that actual work is faster, 
searches are faster, stuff loads quicker - even things like thunderbird 
and firefox and chome respond nearly instantly. Using an editor is more 
productive ( eclipse and jedit are both super responsive ). And this is 
a machine with 8GB of ram, so if I am not running VMs quite a lot of 
stuff is in cache, but with an ssd - it gets into cache faster.

I guess its hard to explain, but the few seconds of time you save even 
with small operations makes a massive difference. eg. being able to do a 
find across a 20k line project in near realtime is fantastic, you can 
actually follow your thought process; big deal to me. Being able to 
deploy a new VM in less than a minute with puppet manifests being tested 
in under 25 seconds; big deal again. Being able to import a 12 GB mysql 
backup db into the local laptop, run tests against it and do migrations 
in near realtime with index builds in a few seconds - massive win.

So yes, if you are a generic user, with a need for a device to look at 
webpages and mostly consume media - a 7200rpm disk or the seagate hybrid 
disks are fine. If you are actually looking at development grade work, 
an SSD is definitely the way to go. Leave the large scale storage on 
remote machines ( I have a 1U machine with 4 x 2TiB disks in a DC, thats 
about all the real remote storage anyone needs normally ).

btw, I've also heard people argue that ssds are lighter than 2.5" sata 
disks - the difference isnt really noticeable. And to really get the 
massive battery life extention, you need to scape the cpu governors 
right back to run as slow as they can, for as long as they can. With an 
SSD churning out data at the 300 - 350MB/sec mark, pretty much 
everything becomes cpu bound - and the regular ondemand governors are 
going to keep the cpu at high clock rates quite a bit.

and my second btw, if you are going to use a large'ish screen with a 
reasonable response rate: get something better than an intel HD graphics 
interface if you can.

Just my 2bits

If you are looking at options, consider the HP EliteBook series as well. 
its the same ( if not better ) configs as the ThinkPad x series, has a 
better display and comes with a 3 year worldwide warranty as standard. 
And HP dont mind if you upgrade anything/everything from the device.

No idea on support metrics. Last time I cared about local india based 
support, HP only worked through third party agents and that totally 
sucked. I suspect whatever is the state of play with Lenovo, HP is 
likely to be about the same.

Oh, and the EliteBook are standard issue in a few Armies around the 
world, they are certified at the same spec as the Panasonic ToughBooks ( 
which cost a lot more, and are much slower configs ). The encasing is 
solid single piece metal.

Do I sound biased? I did a lot of research on just this thing ( ~ a year 
back ) before buying my device.

There are people who say this, do you have some evidence on hand to say 
they fail more often than regular sata disks ? I manage machines with 
about 150 ssd disks in various roles ( mostly db centric though ), and 
havent had any fail[1].

Message-ID: <CAFe1ooLP4aP-rpSujon=BvwEQzTRJWBaT0C7b3JE_nZUqKSztQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I know that there is no such thing as an "unbreakable" system, but would
like to provide the best possible solution to a client.

I am in the process of building a Linux box to serve videos and to run a
LAMP application. The software combo is working fine from Amazon Cloud
instances. As a new service, the client is going to locate these boxes at
the end user's offices. So the box cannot be physically secured. The use
case is such that the end user will not be willing to enter a password for
crypto disks either (if they knew the password, they can replicate the box
anyways). One solution is a USB hardware lock (dongle).

Any suggestions or pointers? Is there a way to do it without building the
system from scratch (LFS)? Say start from a Debian base install and disable
single user mode?

Regards,
Arun

DePython is an online service which will do this, but only up to
Python 2.5, and costs some money after 5kb.

Subject: [Ilugc] OpenDNS
Message-ID: <CA+WoLTk-apxAKGckRNni3vsP0BFXN6a-dMWUmuVsNtiLaf==nw@mail.gmail.com>

The DNS (Domain Name System) is the phonebook of the Internet. When you
enter a website into a browser, it's DNS that finds the optimal machine to
serve that website to you. Without it, browsing as we know it would not be
possible.


Open DNS serves 30 billion DNS requests to  millions of customers every day,
with plenty of capacity to spare. You have been probably using DNS service
of your Internet Service Provider (ISP) which was default /etc/resolv.conf
setting, but ISPs sometimes have notoriously unreliable and slow service.
Switching to OpenDNS gives you best output.

OpenDNS are:

nameserver    208.67.222.222
nameserver    208.67.220.220
nameserver    208.67.222.220
nameserver    208.67.220.222

how to set up:

edit /etc/resolv.conf file and change the nameserver.
you can also alternatively add google's public DNS which are
8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4

 :)

A suggestion,
You could have put that source on top of the mail, so that people
could come to know EARLY on. Anyway nice article, Thanks for the post.

2 is error stream and defines where error are to be displayed . It is
by deafult set to your monitor. here you are re-directing standard
error stream to standard error to that of where standard output goes
which is going to /dev/null. I hope you know what is /dev/null. Read

hi,
for several years I have been using everydns to maintain the dns for my
(mainly opensource) websites. Recently they have gone over to a paid
model. I do not mind paying for my commercial usage, but would like to
ask members for options for free dns for my free sites.

The other option is to run my own dns, but I need 2 IPs for that on two
different servers - if someone can contribute an IP we can offer free
dns to all our members. I am willing to spend time on a GUI for members
to setup their records.

I have recently bought a VPS server. I am in need of a DNS service. My
plan is to set up primary dns in my VPS and secondary DNS in the
freeDNS service. For which ILUGC member's  opinion on good freedns
hosting service would be of great  help. If my vps server proves to be
reliable enough i am willing to host my server for free dns hosting
service. But i am not planning to have any GUI for this service. Since
i am a more of a ops guy rather than  a web desginer/dev guy. I am
planning on relying on email to provide that service. If the email
becomes overloaded then will think of alternatives. I dont expect this
service to be popular over night.

This post reads like a commercial advertisement for OpenDNS/Google!

While there are several reasons to use these services, there are also a
few downsides to be aware of:

1. privacy concerns -- they track every website/domain you visit

2. unknown domain redirection -- they redirect unknown domain lookups
to search engines.  This breaks some applications as they expect DNS
queries to return "domain not found" instead.

3. CDN breakage -- this was already discussed here in the past

I think this may be slightly OT for the subject of this thread, ll ask
anyway. ;-) Is it OK to run our own resolver like BIND? I read somewhere
that this is not a good thing.

Why reinvent the wheel?  The DNS service offered by cheap shared
hosting providers like DreamHost, 1and1, Hostgator, etc should satisfy
your requirements.  Most of them offer "unlimited" domains, and have
web interfaces for managing DNS records. IIRC DreamHost offers
management delegation, so you can create individual accounts for
each domain owner and have them manage their own domains.

My requirements are different from what you are saying above. I want
VPS hosting at rates as cheap as Shared hosting . I found one, but
unfortunately they don't provide dns service. So which requires the
free dns hosting or host my own dns server. So it is not re-inventing
the wheel. Is it ? AFAIK the hosting providers you mentioned provide
dns service only if you choose to host with them and their VPS
services aren't anywhere near cheap. Further i am not a business class
user to require so many of their features like 24x7 support, SSL
certificate, plex control panel (what ever that mean) etc. I choose to
go with unmanaged , no support , no ssl, plain VPS provided by tocici
and for my purposes this is more than enough. You see that i feel that
root access is great compared to shared hosting where you are treated
as a dumb end user. I would better switch to windows OS than using
such a service. Here is the price comparision of 1and1 vps solution
and that provided by tocici
http://order.1and1.com/xml/order/VirtualServerL;jsessionid=CDE40393DBB0D93C92D3C37FF5F0B6F5.TCpfix141a?__frame=_top&__lf=Static&ordernow=true
http://www.buildyourvps.com/unmanaged.html

1and1 demands 29$ monthly for their lowest offering in vps class
tocici is asking for ~2$ monthly for their offering. I subscribed to
their plan and i am paying ~4$ monthly and it is just 2 months old.

Message-ID: <CAL3PARU1MhMd2E-QnONZjaY-XFR+UGcK+2F5s7Q=BCUN4MBANA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I'm looking for a hosting service preferably a VPS or even a dedicated
server where the IP address of the server needs to be dynamic.

I'm going to use this only for running applications (perfectly legal ones )
so I do not  worry about the constantly changing IP or dns etc. I'm not
going to be hosting websites at all.

All I need is SSH shell access. (I can take care of writing an app which,
once the server is switched on I will be informed me of the changed IP
address so that I can login !)

Picture this. You have a server running in your home using a simple DSL
connection. So everytime you switch on/off the router  your IP address
changes. I want a similar situation.

Do you know anyone who can provide this service  located preferably in
India or anywhere ?

Of course I can run a box out of my home now but it is not practical
considering this needs to be live 24/7.

Chris

I run my own named and, AFAIK, there are no issues if its protected 
behind a firewall. In Chennai, We have F Root server so it helps in 
running your own nameserver.

But to the most part, the named cache hit helps the browsing experience 
greatly.

Take a look at http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#How_long_does_it_take_to_remap_an_Elastic_IP_address
- but you're limited to 5 IPs per region IIRC. You'll probably also
have to write a script to rotate IPs.

Best,

I'm advising someone on building an retail ecommerce site with some
peculiarities to a specific business vertical. Have recommended Drupal
as the platform.

I'm now seeking companies that can develop this app for them. This
will be a high volume site and are looking for folks that have done
some such work earlier.

Those interested to engage in this, please reply to

This is for a medium stealth startup application and there is really a
genuine reason for this type of requirement.

I will explain.

$ ls > /dev/null 2>&1

is the Bourne/ksh syntax for redirecting both stdout and stderr to /dev/null

/dev/null is a construct to ignore output

This is the way it is told to the shell.

Redirect fd 1 to somewhere, then redirect fd 2 to fd 1( 2>&1)

The left hand side is without '&', say 1> /dev/null or 2>/dev/null

But the right hand side is written with an '&' to mean:

Instead of to the file foo in 2>foo, redirect to the fd with

2>&1

So this means

redirect fd 2 to fd 1

Instead if you write

2>1

it will redirect to a file called 1

yes, opendns were selling access records to people. Not sure if they 
still do that or not.

Also, they redirect all search traffic via their own sites, so they keep 
a record of what you are doing - again info that is potentially sold to 
other people without your knowledge.

using opendns is perhaps one of the worst things to do in order to 
secure or protect your privacy

We at ThoughtWorks are planning to host this year's DevCamp Chennai on
November 12th (2 weeks after Deepavali)
For those who are new to DevCamp - It is a BarCamp[1] style primarily
targeting software development (across all hardware platforms).
This will be Chennai's second DevCamp. Some photos of first DevCamp[2]
and its home page[3]

As always, requesting active participation from the community and plan
ahead to make yourself available on November 12th!

Last year DevCamp clashed with ILUG-C's monthly meeting and I remember
Shrini & other luggies came for DevCamp in the morning and then rush
for the ilug-c's monthly meetup in the afternoon. Unfortunately it'll
be the same this year as well.

If you are able to connect to other sites, this is most likely a DNS 
issue. Try using one of the open DNS servers.

Hi

Try installing software through shell. If that too fails then check out the
file at /etc/apt/sources.list. This file might not be updated.

The above error message means that you already have a dpkg process 
running (could be apt-get, synaptic, update manager and etc.). Try 
closing it before trying the command.

As a last resort, if there is no dpkg process running and still you get 
the same error, you could try deleting the lockfile, but be careful as 
doing this could potentially corrupt your package database. To be on the 
safer side, I'd reboot and then delete the stale lockfile in that case.

This seems to be a problem with most ISP's DNS servers.

I  use 4.2.2.4 when roaming and use a "caching name server" in the LAN.

Physical (local) access => no guarantee to security.  Besides
encrypted file systems nothing else comes to mind.

What is it that your client wants to secure in this machine?

With physical access no system is secure;  any LiveCD is sufficient to
break into the system.

OK...
Thought about a lot of methods. Nothing can stop a determined cracker to get
access. I guess the only method is to use a an external protection dongle so
that only 1 copy of the system can be used at a given time. Can make it
really difficult to the cracker by encrypting the disk and storing the keys
in the external protection dongle too.

Arun

Laby is a small program to learn how to program with ants and spider webs.
You have to move an ant out of a labyrinth, avoid spider webs, move rocks,
etc.

Using Laby, you can learn OCaml, C and Java. Other bindings can be added later
to support new programming languages.

Harisankar

There is no such thing as the best course and the best certification. I
would not recommend joining a course or even bothering about certifications.
Its hard to find quality faculty.

  Suggestion - If this is for your final year project, mention your area of
interest, speak to a few experts on ILUG, show them what you have done with
linux so far, prove to them that you don't need spoon-feeding and help them
on their projects taking one module at a time. That would give you hands-on
learning experience - which would be far more useful than certifications.

Hi

Check out these pdfs at http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/, by Alessandro
Rubini. Quite good for hands on work. Specifically the ethernet driver
for the 'snull' device.

In case in doubt you might mail the list.

dear all,

please accept my ignorance.

Is it possible - first of all ??? (except in virtualisation). How come
both will be working in the same instant.

Or he is talking about through some shell etc.....  (I used to think

If so, please somebody explain.

I think it should be possible if the windows machine has telnet or
ssh enabled. login to telnet/ssh and run the shutdown command. However
I think this would be a crude way. I think there should be a more graceful
way to do this.

Hi,

I have never faced such issue before regarding IPTABLES in CentOS.

I am just trying to create a vanilla httpd site which will show "It Works"
or the default page of httpd.

Now, I have inserted port 80 in iptables, but yet when I *start iptables, my
page is not coming. When I stop running iptables, page is coming. *

For your understanding, I am attaching my steps here:

1. opened /etc/sysconfig/iptables

2. entered this line:
    *-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j
ACCEPT
*
3. restarted iptables with:  *service iptables restart

*And, here is my "iptables -L" output:

*Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  all  --  anywhere             anywhere

It looks like your rule got appended after the REJECT all. You need to 
use insert instead of append, I think. Try this and see if it works,

-I RH-Firewall-1-INPUT 9 -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 
-j ACCEPT

Hello all,

I am a student currently enrolled to my PG course in Anna University,
Chennai. I wanted to take up some sort of part time job (read as
programming) somewhere here in chennai, so I could work on my weekends and
gain a few notches in the career ladder. But a conversation on the IITM
Hackers list gave me a new perspective. The line read:

Replacing ROR with anything suitable and considering the earning to be *not
only money*, I was made to think about freelancing. And freelancing ofcourse
had its own +and - like multiple clients, varied projects, flexible working
hours(not just weekends), also strict time constraints that might be bad
during those sem ends..etc.,

So I really wanted some expert advice on which way to go. Kindly state your
views, experiences so that I could learn a few things and decide on my path.

Freelancing is not everyone's cup of coffee. And you are right its not
always about money. Its also about time. Its the experience and how much you
enjoy it!

My recommendation is give it a shot when you still can. Start with one
client on a small project. If you like it make it two. And then three.

No advise can replace real experience. So just start and go for it.

It depends. In freelancing you will miss the face to face contacts, working
with coworkers as a team etc and etc. In the bargain you get freedom
(supposedly !)  But most important of all it depends on how long you want to
do freelancing.  It might all be fun and dandy but wait till you get married
!. And then if you want to switch back later, to a day to day office job at
a later stage. The first question a recruiter would ask you is "All along
you have worked alone but now how would you adapt to a team situation".

>> if you are an RoR developer, you can
> earn more than a google job just by freelancing.

Also on this point. A question arises in my mind. Is it true only for RoR or
even for other languages/framework etc. OR is RoR ruling the roost in
freelancing ?

My premise is that if you are a freelancer and are  really good at something
be it java, php or RoR or even creating modules for WP or Drupal. You will
always find your plate full.

Not necessarily true, but close.

Most freelancers who work alone at home and don't do anything else
outside of their billable work tend to stagnate and aren't the best
programmers (IMHO). The good ones are good because they also work on
open source and learn from other, better programmers. Basically, if
you freelance, you won't learn much from your billable work and if
you're serious about helping your career, you want to learn as much as
you can.

If you're looking to learn, identify programmers you'd like to learn
from working on popular open source projects that are small enough
that your pull requests will get their personal attention. Then try to
contribute enough to get commit. Not only do you learn a *lot* about
writing good code, putting that open source project on your resume
will reap rich rewards.

As a case in point, we only hire fresh grads if they have demonstrable
open source experience on their resumes.

You also need to take a call on how much time you have - I would
suspect that you can't study, do open source *and* freelance.

> Replacing ROR with anything suitable and considering the earning to be *not only money*
You will pretty much earn only money. You will learn a fair amount,
but on the business side of things - and that's only if you look at
the whole proposition as a business venture with two assets, your time
and your knowledge. Run it haphazardly and you'll come out of it with
a decent amount of cash and little else.

I'm happy to answer any questions involving actual numbers off-list if
you're interested in the business side of things.

Best,
Sidu.

An alternative is to run the command "sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg".
That'll terminate any process using the lock.

Subject: [Ilugc] Clamav remove windows virus?
Message-ID: <CAPSMCpKjp+7CLQ6BBQMbJAosbSWJu-7HX2t6-EaVh5Ua_4pBLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
 I have an arch system triple boot with windows xp,windows 7. I am sure
there are viruses in both windows system, I am not interested in running
windows antivirus for hours to scan the system but leaves the virus.

Can i run clamav to remove all viruses which are in my harddisk? (I am not
sure that a software running in linux will detect exe files and find whether
they are legitmate or viruses)

Regards,
Balaji

It will. Rather that's what anti-viruses on Linux are made for.

Hi,

According to http://www.muktware.com/news/2382 , TN Govt has scrapped the
old tender and issued a new tender to buy only "Microsoft" products.

Guys thanks for the links and pdf, I will look in it.

Hameed: Its not part of my final year project, I am considering it a career
choice. I felt the same regarding certification didn't seem to find any good
or standard ones for industries.

Too bad. Also a close reading shows that not only they removed Linux dual
boot, but the words "starter edition"(cheapest windows product) also is
missing in new tender. Now it simply says Windows.

 TN Govt has scrapped the old tender and issued a new tender to buy only
"Microsoft" products.



> Surprising to note that ELCOT promotes Open Source.
http://www.elcot.in/open_source.php . Why Elcot changed their stance of
using Dual boot OS to Windows only  may have other reasons apart from the
Curruption as alleged. We need to find out the "real reasons".

Is there anyone in the group who have connection with Elcot to find it?

Hi

I feel we should concentrate more Linux than on Govt's stand.
