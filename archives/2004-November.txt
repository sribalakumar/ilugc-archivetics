CBV is the file format of chessbase (www.chessbase.com). You need
chessbase to read the database.
AFAIK, there are no opensource/free readers for CBV files. Moreover the
file format is undocumented so
writing a reader is difficult.

This message did not appear badly mangled and is quite readable.

The best way to post on almost any mailing list is to disable HTML
emails.  I don't know how you'd do that at rediff but any mail service
worth its salt usually provides an option to do this. :)

The policy of this list is to convert the HTML to plain text.

Here i assume all ur logs come to "root"
In the root's home create a file ".forward" which will
have the ids you want the mails(logs) to go.
Any send to "root" will be forwarded to the mailid's.

You have to start sendmail, but its enough if you configure it
to listen for lo(alone), which will be the default(in redhat/fedora).

Do revert back if that was helpful.

I have come accross this many times. It will try to give the GUI
screen and crash.

Here is a quick solution:
What i do is reboot the machine, get into text mode(init 3) from bootloader,
login and startx(save the prev log for reasearch). If that started the GUI
then, logout again and init 5. You will see the login screen. If you didn't
get the GUI mode after startx, then read further.

For this, first thing to checkout/correct will be ip & hostname.
Did you change the ip/hostname before, Does ping to your hostname pings your
system ip/lo? If all these are fine then dig the XFree86 logs and Google.

Hi Manokaran,

 Gmail makes it easy for you to send text mails and
 the 1GB space is also worth having especially with
 tools like

 GMailFS
http://richard.jones.name/google-hacks/gmail-filesystem/gmail-filesystem

 Gmail Drive( http://www.viksoe.dk/code/gmail.htm )

 I have 6 Gmail invites to offer, would you like to have one?
 Send me a reply with First name & Last Name to my address.

Mandrake 10.1 requires a decent hardware configuration to perform well.
It was not satisfactorily fast even on my Athlon XP 1800+ with 256 MB 
RAM machine. You will need a faster machine if you are going to use KDE or 
Gnome as your desktop environment (on any linux distro, for that matter).

Here are some things that I would suggest:

1. Disable startup services that you dont use (perhaps NFS, Apache, DNS 
resolver, Kudzu, atd, samba and so on...). Optimize your system startup 
scripts for faster boot time and to reduce the number of default services 
running on your machine (you'll need to know some basic shell scripting to 
tweak the rc scripts). 

2. If you plan to use KDE, try to reducing bells and whistles, by using 
simple themes (like .NET or Windows 9x) and turn off menu transparency, drop 
shadow, icon highlighting, and so on.

3. If your video card is a medium/high-end model, check to see if hardware 
acceleration is enabled (enable it if you can). Else, try reducing default 
depth of X Window System to 16 bit. 

Alternately, try migrating to a lean desktop environment like XFCE. You can 
also optimally mix and match various components that make your desktop 
environment to suit your requirements. Here are some alternatives:

1. For a light fast window manager - try Openbox, WindowMaker, 
Enlightenment, Fluxbox, Sawfish, Fvwm2.

2. For managing files and folders, desktop icons, sessions, background and 
panel - try ROX-Filer (and ROX-Session). 

3. For effective file management - try using Midnight Commander within xterm 
window.

4. For playing music, you can try xmms, or command line players like 
mpg321, mp3blaster and so on.

5. If you need to use terminals within your X session, avoid the overly 
_bloated_ gnome-terminal or konsole. Use rxvt or xterm instead.


There are many more things that you could do to optimize your system 
performance depending on your free time and patience. I'm still 
productive enough on a Pentium 60 with 16 MB RAM running Linux (with a lean 
and mean GUI of course) ;-).

Sorry for not letting you know in advance. 

I am willing to give a presentation on November 7
(Sunday), 2004. How long should the presentation be?

Is the room air-conditioned? If yes, and if you have a
projector, I am willing to bring my laptop for a demo
(GUI/multimedia/OOffice/). Else, I will be happy to
use a desktop. But, do let me know if I need to come a
day ahead and setup the desktop for the presentation.

I can be reached at 98407-87007.

Thanks,

K Shakthi

This brings us back to the basic question - "How fast is fast after all ?" 
The answer to which generally varies from one person to the other. 

A simple test on my machine proved that KDE setup (default on Mandrake) was 
pertty slow. I started noatun to play music, and then I opened up the 
Konsole (which took atleast 5 seconds to start), and clicked on "Create new 
tab" button for about 40 times (to open 40 new Konsole session within a tab) 
till noatun almost stopped and my hard disk began to churn. My desktop is  
almost unusable now. 

I tried the same exercise using Openbox window manager (with ROX Session 
running) by running mp3blaster within rxvt to play music, and clicking on 
the terminal icon (rxvt, apparently). I gave up after opening about 
130+ sessions of rxvt (I should've automated the task with a script 
perhaps), and my desktop still felt stable and responsive enough (without a 
glitch in music). I'm sure it could run more apps without churning my hard 
disk. 

Of course, you would argue that my optimal setup (Openbox+ROX+rxvt) is 
 neither "user friendly", convenient nor "windows like" for an average user. 
But it has been more convenient and productive for me ;-)

Chandrashekar Babu

A good balance over "user-friendly" and "resource-friendly" can be
found in the XFce4 desktop - http://xfce.org.  But I will switch to
rox one day if official debian packages become avaiable.

I used to like XFce desktop back in the 3.x versions (which resembled more 
closely to *cough* the beautiful CDE on Solaris). But the 4.x version though 
looks more pretty (anti-aliased fonts, gtk2 bindings, more bells and 
whistles), was a bit more resource intensive and at times buggy (xfpanel 
fails to load once in a while). Of course, it is lighter than KDE/Gnome, but 
 I still consider it to be somewhat heavy-weight. It needs upto 32 MB of 
memory to be usable.

> But I will switch to rox one day if official debian packages become avaiable.

Its well worth the effort ;-). ROX-Filer in my opinion is more "user 
friendly" and powerful than xffm/xftree4 (the file manager bundled with 
XFce). When configured well with ROX-Session, you can get the basic features 
of a _modern_ powerful desktop environment like background wallpaper, a 
powerful file-manager, desktop icon support (which is a very useful feature 
for those who have been using KDE/Gnome/Windows desktop), desktop panel, 
basic configuration tool and session management. All these features with a 
memory utilization of about 12 MB. Works like a charm on my old thinkpad
with 32 MB RAM :-)

Chandrashekar Babu.

 hey sridhar..you do know that unlike debian people, ILUGC folks
 are quiet friendly and wouldn't make a big fuss over something
 offered to them in a friendly gesture :-)

 In fact..the ILUGC folks are so friendly that they even let you
 publicise commercial(unlike Gmail) products/services such as
 Internet Broadband Services (from Airtel for example) for the 
 benefit of the Chennai Linux community.

 The debian community may be smart, but they need to learn quite
 a few things from ILUGC. ;-)

  Thanks for the tips, but I'm curious: Which desktop distro of Linux can
run reasonably fast with X and say, a browser, in 16 MB on a P60?

  I have a nice Toshiba Libretto (P75 w/16 MB) that has been running
Slackware for a long time in 16 MB, but I'd like to upgrade to an RPM-
based distro, with Wifi support, and a halfway decent browser, that will
be reasonably quick (without paging). Extra memory for the Libretto is
more expensive than the residual value of the machine, so that's out of
the equation.

  RedHat 5.2 comes to mind, it's lightning-quick in 32 MB and has Netscape
4.07, but it requires jumping through some hoops to get WiFi going, and its
usability at w/16 MB is doubtful.

I am not sure about these.  But you can try link2-x11, dillo for
browsers.  x11 version of link2 is close to gecko in rendering.

Subject: [Ilugc] checking CD
Message-ID: <1cc2ae10411012040abdee52@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List,
  I find somewhere in the Net that to check the goodness of CD we can use

dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/dev/null

If the o/p is without any errors then CD is fine.

I checked this with a CD i have. I got the following o/p

[root@snmoorthy root]# dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/dev/null
dd: reading `/dev/cdrom': Input/output error
2392+0 records in
2392+0 records out

CD is partially written and I can understand that reading beyond that
gives I/O error. While giving following command with blocks

[root@snmoorthy root]# dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/dev/null count=2392
2392+0 records in
2392+0 records out

Here I have specified the blocks in "count" parameter. My question is,
is there any way to find the bytes currently used in CD so that I can
specify in "dd" command.

TIA
Moorthy

Well, I did make a fuss and if OT posts cross a threshold, will do so
again.  Once you start down the path of tolerating any amount of OT
posts, you end up with tons of them, S/N suffers and the list is
ruined.  So, please do avoid off-topic posts.  Sharing gmail invites
is definitely OT on this list.

 I didn't actually share inivites here but just made a hint.
 Anyway.. I understand your valid concern about offtopic posts.
 Henceforth, I would be careful about things I post here.

I second that suggestion. I run Slackware 8.1 on my old P-60 
desktop (16 MB RAM), with GNUstep environment (WindowMaker, GWorkspace.app, 
GNUMail.app, wdm and some wmaker dockapps). For web browsing, I would prefer 
the hacked links web browser from twibright labs 
( http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~clock/twibright/links/ ) or w3mme (if 
you are willing to stay happy without javascript support). 

By the way, I've tweaked Slackware 8.1 on my old machine to an extent that 
the last PID when I run 'ps ax' command within a terminal remains below 
80 immediately after system boot. It also runs XFree86 3.3 series which is 
lighter (and less featured) than XFree86 4.x or X.org series.

Oh well, most of the times when I'm on that box, I'm on emacs, which is 
the *true* desktop environment for me :-)

And yes, Netscape 4 is bloated for my box (not to mention that it 
used to crash pretty often with "Bus Error").

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu

As an alternative to X, you can also try FBUI -

I guess the very early versions of Mandrake (1.0 ?) were much faster 
and well optimized for old Pentium boxes. I dont know about its stability 
though. Again, I would suggest a different web browser opposed to 
"Netscape". Infact, Opera is much lighter, feature rich and stable than 
Netscape 4 series.

Thanks, I tried the hacked twibright links-2.1pre15-2, and it is usable, but
just barely (maybe I need to get down the learning curve on it). It is
minimal-featured, having just a 'back' button for page traversal. Text-
entry fields render differently, like text-mode lynx. It seems to be
compact and quick, and the big advantage seems to be that it does not need
X - it will also work with SVGAlib alone (not tested yet).

However, it seems adequate for Google (with one minor quirk - it does not
follow the link to the international google.com). It's probably OK for
notebooks (with keyboards) but not web-pads.

Thanks for the tip on Dillo - I just tried dillo-0.8.3 and it is nearly
perfect for my requirements. The rendering has some faults, and it does
not use the correct spacing, etc., but it is *very* quick, and its feature
set is pretty large (apparently it's used in the Samsung Yopy PDA as well).
It's comparable to Konqueror, but written to GTK+ and runs like it's on
steroids. Even those of us who've been spoiled by Mozilla can adapt easily
to Dillo.

I'd totally second the recommendation of Dillo for small-footprint desktops
and handhelds. The SRPM is very small, and it's pure C.

  I'll modify my opinion and add that SSL support is preliminary and disabled
by default in Dillo, so you may have to do some minor hacks if you want to
access secure content. Other than that, it's nearly perfect.

There's a misleading article in today's Ziff-Davis eWeek, titled
"Mac and Linux Not Immune to Viruses".

http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1706263,00.asp

The article has *nothing* at all about either the Mac or Linux,
and talks only about social-engineering and phishing, and how they
might work even on the Mac or Linux. Most probably, it may have
been commissioned by Micros~1.

I'd urge you all to read the article, post talkback comments and
write to the editor (politely). State that the article is factually
incorrect and misleading, and explain why.

It's important to get our message out, because this kind of nonsense
is what is read by the IT/CIO types and the great unwashed - the
article has been picked up by Yahoo technology as well.

  I meant that even those of us who are so used to the features of Mozilla
that we cannot give it up easily, would not mind trying Dillo because it
has sufficient features to be a usable non-bloated alternative.

I think you made the point clear there - the article tries to say that even
if you use a Mac or a Linux, don't go around typing your credit card info in
sites you don't know. And don't run programs you don't trust. That advice
holds true for any OS or platform. Typing out your credit card information
in a pron site is as dangerous in Firefox as in IE.

  The license is non-transferable, similar to that of StarOffice 5.2, which
was also a free download. If you've already registered at the Sun download
site, I guess you may copy the ISO for your own use as per the terms of the
license, otherwise not.

  Running an untrusted program without root privileges in Linux
has little or no consequence - at the worst, it can destroy or alter the
contents of your home directory. A nuisance, but easy to recover from if
you have a halfway decent automatic backup policy, for instance with
rsync.

  *Big difference* from the mayhem that can be caused on Windows
by merely clicking a link or opening an attachment, or is some cases with
Outlook worms, no action at all by the user.

  Phishing attacks (for credit cards numbers, etc.) are of course platform
independent, but they're not viruses, which is what the title of the
article claims to be talking about.

  This is classic FUD from Redmond, make no mistake about it.

  There has been a plethora of recent articles in the press that talk about
the dangers of spyware and malware, and how legislation is needed to defend
against these threats. The FLOSS community responded by saying - "Not so, this
is only a threat if you're Windows user. If you're using Linux, there's no
way you can get infected by clicking a link or opening an attachment. Linux
is inherently more secure. There's no need for fresh legislation". 

  To prevent this message (which would be against the interests of Micros~1)
from getting out to the great unwashed, they're responding with FUD from
paid shills, like the author of the said article in eWeek.

  Conspiracy theory? Maybe, but Micros~1 has a long history of actions
similar to this.

A similar FUD generated by Forbes a few months ago, that Linux was expensive 
than Windows to maintain, about Linux being insecure than Windows, and 
more recently generated FUD by AdTI.net claiming that Linus 
Torvalds wasn't the original author of Linux(!), the history of 
relationship between these firms and Microsoft somewhat proves your point 
;-)

That's besides the point. Social engineering works anywhere. If people get a
dialog box asking them to type in the root password to see 'My Document',
they would.  Linux being or not being inherently secure is not a factor
here.

You are trying to hide many design-level security flaws in Windows by
saying something like this.  Luggies, internal FUD! ;)

  On any Unix-like operating system, you would not get a dialog box asking
for a root password to see any document, leave alone something called
'My Document'. That alone would be an indicator of something wrong,
like maybe he's sitting in somebody else's cubicle in front of a different
computer :-).

  Ordinarily, the user need not even know the root password, and still be
able to use the system for normal day-to-day office activities. This is
the default situation in most Unix deployments in corporate settings.
Popping a dialog-box with such a question would not be of any use for
a Trojan, if the user simply didn't know the root password, or was smart
enough not to type it in at such a prompt.

  The title of the article referred to *viruses*, but the entire article
only talks vaguely about social-engineering and phishing - both of which
have nothing to do with viruses.

Well, I've seen slightly different social engg exploits targeted at the 
sort of semi 31337 crowd that knows just enough to install FC3, knows 
all sorts of cool buzzwords ...and then receives an email that has the 
subject "pgp has been cracked, run this command to see how" .. the 
command being, on pine "pipe the attached script to shell and then 
execute it".  Of course, the attached script just happened to be a 
rootkit ...

*nix (linux, bsd, sun, whatever) has its very own category of stupid 
users.. those who know far more buzzwords than unix concepts, and who 
still lack the ingrained caution and security consciousness that you 
develop when using a well engineered and security aware OS like *nix.

You get semi-clued users all over the place .. on MSDN forums, as well 
as on linux mailing lists. They're not unique to microsoft.. and as long 
as there are stupid users, there will be exploits targeted at their 
stupidity.

Always remember that, as Alexander Pope said, "A little knowledge is a 
dangerous thing. Drink deep, or taste not of the pierian spring".  Half 
baked knowledge is the most dangerous knowledge to have ...

  It still wouldn't get installed unless the guy was root or typed
in the root password, would it? (Unless, of course, there were
holes in pine and sh. Unlikely now, because both have been around for

3 = E, 1 = lowercase l, 7 = T.  Misspelled words, with random case, 
letter number substitutions etc are characteristic of IRC skript kiddies 
(as is the deliberate misspelling of words like kewl, skript etc).

A vaguely similar form exists among people who, though quite well 
educated, think it is essential to spell on email / messenger etc like 
they failed their english exams somewhere around std IV and then stopped 
learning english after that ...

Well - this one dates back to 4..5 years back, and exploited some kind 
of local root hole.  Someone was sending copies of this to all users on 
a lot of free shell servers ..

 Ah, I got it. Not so much a slow-bulb, but too much lateral interpretation
(ghost of Jacques Derrida at work here?).

I thought 31337 should be read upside-down and backward (like those parlour
tricks with calculators). 7 = L, 3 = E, 1 = T and I got stuck on the last 3,
which would have given LEETE, and left me a little confused.

Count me in for LAMP. Just tell me what do we need to do. Working
Demo. Then I nedd the system up and running with LAMP pre configured
to avoid hiccups. Otherwise I can bring a slide show with some generic
code and snapshots.

I shall cover the following:
- X applications (software tools for different needs)
- Multimedia (Audio/video)
- Linux support (finding help) 

Note, I am NOT covering Desktop environments
(KDE/Gnome/Fluxbox/et al.), unless you want me to.

Saravanan Team and Basker, please clarify if this is
ok and let me know what you will be talking about. Let
us not end up covering the same topics.

English is a proper noun written with a capital letter at the beginning.
   Sorry about the mistake there: "proper noun" is a Proper Noun ;) (OK. 
Is it really so?  Who maintains the official rules of English and where 
are they written down ? Answers may closely match the search for 
official linux kernel or official gcc :) Poets deliberately revolt 
against rules, and looks like many modern users are like our poets! [2]

The classic work, "The King's English" by H.W. Fowler is available on
line at http://www.bartleby.com/116/  and makes very interesting
reading. If anyone here is *seriously* interested in the rules of
English grammar, please write functions that could help programs to
write well. If such a library of functions is already available as free
software, please point links to it. I have written a few functions in
php that could give plural for singular and feminine for masculine, that
works like this[1]:

function get_plural($singular){
      // returns plural of $singular
      ...
      return $plural
}

GCIDE at http://www.ibiblio.org/webster/ is fairly mature, and it is
quite possible to write many useful functions with help from GCIDE, that
could ultimately help programs to write and read English, like we do, or 
maybe much better :)

Thanks,
Ramanraj.

[2] Poets would always find ways to bend or even break rules to carve a
space for themselves. It would be interesting to read Abraham Cowley's 
`Ode: of Liberty':

<quote>
/Where honour or where conscience does not bind,
No other law shall shackle me,
Slave to myself I will not be;
Nor shall my future action be confin'd,
By my own present mind.
Who by resolved and vows engag'd does stand,
For days, that belong to fate,
Does like an unthrift mortgage his estate,
Before it falls into his hand,
The bondman of the cloister so,
All that he does receive does always owe,
And still as time comes in, it goes away,
Not to enjoy, but debts to pay,
Unhappy slave, and pupil to a bell!
Which his hour's work as well as hours does tell,
Unhappy till the last, the kind releasing knell./
</quote>

Samuel Johnson sharply criticised Cowley for careless use of `_does_'
many times in the above poem ! Probably Cowley deliberately used
'_does_' many times to revolt against the rules to make a visible show
of the  exercise of his `Liberty'.  But it _does_ help to know the rules
and be aware of its violations - atleast to give meaning to our `Liberty'.

Message-ID: <20041103043701.8E079329C4@whitebox.dias.ath.cx>

         I'm enclosing the text of a forwarded e-mail from
Microsoft - it looks like they're starting an RFID project in
Hyderabad. I'm not aware of an Open-Source RFID project, although
Symbol Technologies (the market leader in Point-of-Sale and RFID)
has dabbled with both Windows CE and Linux platforms.

Those who're looking for a Greenfield FLOSS project with excellent
potential for the future should look at trying to implement an
RFID/POS platform on Linux. That way, we'll at least get a say
in the standardization process before that is hijacked by Micros~1
and others.

*********************** Begin text of forwarded mail ******************

Information on RFID
-------------------
Microsoft has a new initiative to develop state-of-the-art RFID 
(Radio Frequency Identification) software capabilities for the 
Windows platform. RFID technology is being rapidly adopted by large 
and mid sized businesses alike, initially to automatically detect 
and track goods in supply chains, where the technology promises 
unprecedented real-time visibility and significant efficiencies over 
existing technology. By integrating such real-time information with 
their existing applications and processes, business can determine 
the number, status and location of their goods right from production 
through distribution until such time they are sold by a retailer.. 

RFID technology is also being applied in wide-ranging applications 
outside the supply chain too, e.g. asset tracking systems, automated 
payment systems, rental equipment tracking, and so forth. Because of 
its innumerable applications for tracking real world objects, RFID 
is referred to as the enabler of an "Internet of physical things". 

Our team will develop a comprehensive set of RFID software services 
to enable Microsoft's ISV partners to create real-time track and 
trace capabilities into their business applications. We will support 
multi-vendor RFID hardware (incl. RFID readers/writers, tags, tag 
printers), including the discovery and management of such devices on 
a network. Our software will allow efficient capture and 
manipulation of RFID tag data, allow customers to flexibly integrate 
business-relevant RFID data and events into their existing back-end 
business applications. Our vision is to create hardware-agnostic and 
application-agnostic RFID services for the Windows platform, which 
customers can use to easily define, test and deploy rich, robust, 
easy to manage RFID solutions.

  OK, I now understand the significance of both articles - they're
definitely FUD commissioned by Micros~1, and here's why:

  The first article pretends to be talking about viruses (it's in the
title), but actually talks about social-engineering and phishing in the
text of the article - concluding that all platforms are equally vulnerable
to social engineering and phishing.

  The second article pretends to be talking about security, but neatly
sidesteps the issue of malware (spyware, adware, viruses, trojans, ...) until
the concluding paragraph.

  The only metric they're measuring is a break-in, and it's not even clear
how they define it. Their definition of 'security through obscurity' is
fallacious, and they're not even considering the severity of the intrusion
(in reality, a non-root shell intrusion into a Linux system, say as 'guest'
or 'nobody', is very common, but has negligible severity).

They're also clubbing home users, soho users, big enterprise servers, etc.
together without any differentiation. It is entirely possible for a newbie
home Linux install to have no firewall and all TCP services turned on. 

On this basis, they conclude that Linux is the most vulnerable to break-ins!
(Maybe - but what exactly is a break-in? IMHO, a login into a guest account
should not count, but a remote root exploit should count - there's no clarity
on this subject in the article).

As they say, there are lies, damned lies and statistics. To this, we may add
an entirely new category, which is FUD from Redmond.

  After reading the referenced text (instead of the article at Yahoo 
technology that refers to this report), I'll retract the claim that this
FUD originated at Micros~1. It's misinformation, regardless of where it
originated, nevertheless.

  The thing to note is that this is a for-profit entity, that has links
on the page where you can order the report, so it's in their interest to
drum up sales by creating controversy. There's not enough information
on their methodology and metrics to be able to refute it without actually
buying the report, and that's not something I'd recommend.

LOL :-)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31337 has some background on 31337 speak. 
However, it's also interesting to explore some other angles to this. 31337 
has traditionally been a unix backdoor port; it's really open to debate if 
31337 speak pays indirect homage to these original crackers.

More recently back-orifice has used port 31337 as a pretty clear homage to 
31337 speak; with the result that most firewalls nowadays bounce any traffic 
that happens to be on port 31337!

Subject: [Ilugc] Strange problem
Message-ID: <cma7ft$n9a$1@sea.gmane.org>

Hi list,

i have a strange problem here. We purchased a new machine yesterday.
I tried to install WhiteBox(respin1) the install boot form the CD. It
detects the HDD & the prob is when it detects the hdc(cd) and exits with
coredump. Then i tried with fc2 and ended up with the same prob.

To make sure that the cd drive has prob i tried installing win98. It
installed without reporting any prob. I cant believe it. So as a test tried
with gentoo(minimal cd). It worked. I could download the stage files and
continued the installation, in the course, I removed windows :-).

My question here is, why WBEL and FC2 couldn't start the install, when win &
gentoo did. Has anyone come accross similar prob.

My H/w config: Intel D865GV(orig),celeron 2G,512M RAM,80G HDD(samsung). I
have also a mild doubt about RAM(eventhough it passed memtest86 - false
positive?). Any pointers appreciated.

TIA

[Commercial]

Dear Linux enthusiasts,

LINUXForYou: The Complete Magazine on Open Source.
LINUXForYou's November issue is now on stands, it has a
lot of content which the community would like to get their
hands on.

November's Focus
LINUXForYou: Michael Tiemann, VP, Open Source Affairs, Red
Hat, shares his vision, enthusiasm and entrepreneurial
spirits with LFY readers.
LINUXForYouPRO: Fine-tune your video cards.

Other highlights of the November issue includes:
----------------------------------------------------------
LFY CD #1

CD #1 is bundled with the following software
* SmoothWall: This is an Internet security software package
based on Linux. It is Web managed and has the facilities
normally seen in expensive commercial offerings.

* Damn Small inux: This is a business card sized, bootable
LiveCD distribution.


LFY CD #2

MEPIS: MEPIS is a LiveCD distribution. It is an ideal
foundation for developing a custom version of Linux for
large scale deployment. It is ideal for integrators and
end-user clients to develop privately branded and
optimally tweaked Linux configurations.

LINUX For You
--------------------
Articles in detail

* Are You Ready to Rock? is the theme of this interview
with Michael Tiemann, VP, Open Source Affairs, Red Hat.
Tiemann has shared his thoughts and vision that all of us
can learn from. He has addressed the concerns of the CEOs
of Indian IT firms who are wondering if it's time to shift
to the open source paradigm. He has also explained why
CIOs would be at an advantage if they deploy open source.
He has also expressed his willingness to partner with
governments to demonstrate the benefits of open source.

* With the battle raging between the open source community
and the proprietary world on one front, there are lots of
arguments to be settled between free software against open
source software. Licensing is the key behind these
arguments. So the article titled "Licensing Open Source
Software" just do this.

* The cute little penguin has made an entry in the
electronic design automation industry. So, if you are a
part of electronics industry and are looking for ideas on
cutting costs the article titled "Tux Automates Electronic
Design" is for you.


LINUX For You PRO
-------------------------
Articles in detail

* Troubleshooting Video: This article describes how to
configure, troubleshoot and fine-tune the performance of
video cards in Fedora.

* If you have a Web server in Linux and want to secure the
acess from browser clients to the Web server, Hyper Text
Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is one of the solutions.
We have an article fully devoted to HTTPS as it's widely
used in e-commerce.

* Review: Firefox Browser: In this article, Firefox browser
has been reviewed in detail.


Why do we have two versions of Linux For You now?
------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux For You was conceived with the aim of pushing Linux
from labs to offices. To achieve this goal, we realised
that we needed to reduce the pricing of the main magazine
so that those who were not technical but curious about
Linux/OSS could access the information. Hence,
LINUXForYou's main magazine was created as a magazine for
everyone to read.

At the same time, the demand from the tech community was
clear -- they needed technical content along with CDs that
bundled the latest software and distros. Hence, the
combined pack of LINUXForYou and LFYPRO and the two CDs is
now available at Rs 100!

For more details about LINUX For You magazine, log on to
www.linuxforu.com or email at niraj@efyindia.com.

This communication aims to inform the Linux community
about the information contained in Asia's only magazine on
Linux and open source, and we hope that it will be taken
positively.

Subject: [Ilugc] [possibly OT] Music plays. No sound.
Message-ID: <20041103111121.GA19624@symonds.net>

Hello,

I just bought a KM400A mother board which has a Via 8233 sound chipset
onboard (ALSA module: snd-via82xx).   The mother board appears totally
futuristic to me since the last  mobo that I bought was a 'tomato' for
an AMD K6 500 MHz :)

Now, I've  setup ALSA to load  the appropriate module for  my card and
when I do mplayer /whatever/whatever.wav, it does seem to be "playing"
but I  donot hear anything  inspite of setting _everything_  listed by
'amixer' to 'full'.

So here are my (possibly off-topic) questions:

1. What does the  term 'front panel' in the context  of a mother board
   refer to?  My mother board  manual claims this:

    "If you donot want to connect  to the front-audio header, pins 5 &
    6, 9  & 10   have to be  jumpered in  order to have  signal output
    directed  to  the  rear   audio  ports.  Otherwise.  the  Line-out
    connector on the back panel will not function".

   So I  did. I have  jumpered 5&6 and  9&10. but When I  do something
   like   cat   /bin/ls   >/dev/dsp,   I  donot   hear   the   "usual"
   line-noise. but  there are load  and spaced-out click  sounds (much
   similar to someone tapping @10bpm).

2. My  cabinet's interior has  two 0.5"  stereo jacks  (which actually
   opens out on the front-side  of the cabinet as two stereo sockets).
   Note   that    these   two   0.5"   jacks   are    found   in   the
   interior.  ie.,. along  with  the  wires for  HDD  LED, POWER  LED,
   etc.,.  My question is:  How does  one connect  this to  the mother
   board? My  mother board  does not have  any compatible  0.5" stereo
   sockets on it  (except the 'real panel (ie,.,  if I understood what
   'rear panel' means correctly)).

It would be highly helpful if  some noble soul that has had experience
with such mother boards can shed light.

thanks!

  -Suraj

Hi

How to limit display of other users process ?

If you log in as a normal user and do a ps -aux you can display all the 
process running on the machine including root. How can I as a root stop 
this as I feel its a security threat. It should display only users 
process. Any solution ?

If you're getting rid of the K6-2/500 (CPU + heat sink only), drop me a

  Have you compiled mplayer with OSS or ALSA support? If it's the former,
you need to enable OSS emulation, etc. in your kernel config.

  It's the set of header pins that contain the Speaker, power on, power
led, reset sw, hdd led, front usb, etc. signals. Ordinarily, you should
connect the cables that are connected to these componets/sockets in the
cabinet to this header.

  Not sure, but it may be a driver issue. You've maxxed out everything
in aumix and unmuted everything, right?

  Yeah, this is a nuisance, and it's found in most of these 'entertainment
centre' cabinets. That jack pair needs to exit the cabinet (sometimes
with the help of a rear-slot L-bracket with a circular hole in it) and then
it should be plugged in the rear panel speaker and mic sockets. A classic
Taiwan-special kludge.

  Some motherboards provide these signals on a header near the front
panel connectors, which can be used if you have the right cable (a pair
of sockets on one end, and a pair of berg female plugs on the other).

Thanks Cheeni - I remember an early Usenet spam posting (about '93/94),
in which a script-kiddie said "I am Elite - Gimme Warez!" or
something to that effect. That was the first direct reference to
the term 'Elite' that I saw, and at the time, I had no clue at all as
to what the posting meant. My sysadmin at the time, Sean 'Xibo' Coates, who
was a minor net.personality at the time (he presided over alt.angst, and
was also a counter-weight to another net.personality who went by the name
of Kibo (alt.kibology)) just laughed off my enquiry, so it must have been
well-known terminology by that time.

BTW, an earlier mail of mine to cheeni.net bounced - just a mention of
a BusinessWeek article on Wikis - it looks like the suits are taking
notice of it.

Hello,

     I have to build a  couple of linux boxes from
scratch(right from choosing computer components to
install the proper distro) in Chennai. 

Any guidance is welcome. 

If anyone is willing to make an onsite visit to build
the box, that is highly appreciated and will be paid
also :-)

These are the system needs 
a. should run mysql with 4.X or 5.X(this should be
accessed thru socket bind )
b. kernel 2.6.x is expected.
c. no need for hi end graphics cards.
d. the motherboard doesnt need to have any gaming pc
or personal pc features.
e. AMD socket A is good enough, or anyother processor
at a reasonable rate.

please pass your advices on choosing the components
and choosing distros.

i prefer slackware(but the default in this is 2.4, no
idea on how easy the 2.6 installation will be)

Thanks
Murugan

  If you need to build a Linux server, stability and driver quality are
the main criteria, not speed. I'm proceeding with the assumption that
driver quality is very good and not an issue for the chipsets from Intel,
AMD, NVidia, Broadcom (Serverworks) and Via. These are the only chipsets
I'd consider - SiS and other Taiwanese vendors are out of
consideration. 

 The most important HW issues, IMHO, for a stable server meant for 24/7
use are:

1) The quality of the power supply (preferably an over-engineered one from
   the likes of Delta or similar)
2) Heat (more about this below)
3) Motherboard stability (more below).

SMPS: Be very picky about the power supply, if necessary paying money to buy
a sample to dissect and examine. It must have MOVs to protect the inputs,
over-engineered line filtering, over-engineered heat sinks, everything
(You probably need to be an SMPS designer to be able to do this
 effectively). In my experience, there are a few companies that are pretty
good for server SMPSes - Delta Electronics (OEM suppliers to IBM, HP),
and a few others. These aren't going to be cheap - a well-engineered
server SMPS rated at 450W or so costs anywhere from $100-$200 retail.

Heat: To most people, this means bigger heatsinks and more fans. I have a
very contrarian view - I try to pick a CPU that produces very little heat
in comparison its performance. Roughly, this list contains:

1) Via C3 or Eden 667/733 MHz (<10 W)
2) Transmeta Efficeon or Crusoe 600-1.6 GHz (~10 W)
3) Intel Banias Pentium M/ Celeron M 1.2- 2 GHz(~25 W)
4) Intel Mendocino Celeron 366-533 MHz (~20 W)
5) Intel Tualatin Celeron or PIII 1-1.5 GHz (~25 W)
6) Intel Coppermine-T PIII 1 GHz (~30 W)

  (Choices below need further research)

7) AMD mobile Athlon 64 1.5-2 GHz (~35 W)
8) AMD Athlon 64/2800-4000 1.6-2.4 GHz (~50 W)
9) AMD Opteron 2xx 1.4-2.4 GHz (~80 W)

  (This isn't even worth further research)
10) Intel Madison/Deerfield Itanium 2 800 MHz-1.7 GHz (up to 130 W)

(It doesn't include Athlon 32s and P4s either 32 or 64, which aren't suitable
for 24/7 use - more below). 

Of this list, 2 & 3 are ruled out because you can't get motherboards for them
in India. 7-9 are possibilities that need researching (the best, but with
limited availability). 10 isn't even a possibility worth researching, it
isn't x86-compatible.

 That leaves 1, 4, 5 & 6. I have machines with each of
these CPUs, and 6 (Coppermine-T) is good - but very hard to obtain. These
were the last generation Coppermines that Intel produced, and have many of
the Tualatin features, including the integrated heat-spreader. But they're
not available now.

That brings 5, the Tualatin. It's very good, still available, but good server
motherboards for them (with features like ECC, on-board SATA, etc.) are
limited - only the Serverworks HE comes to mind, and it's hard to find.

That leaves 1 & 4, which are relatively slow (the C3 tops out at about
1 GHz, and the Mendocino Celeron at 533 MHz), but both are excellent
choices for a server, especially the Mendocino Celeron. Here's why:

1) They're cheap and widely available - the Mendocino Celeron is available
in the grey market for ~Rs.600 or less.

2) Both have superb packages for heat conductivity, with integrated heat
spreaders.

3) Both have a wide choice of motherboards that support them, especially
the Mendocino Celeron. In particular, the most reliable chipsets ever
made (with ECC SDRAM suppport, etc.), the Intel 440BX or its predecessor
the 440LX, both support the Mendocino Celeron.

You'll notice that I haven't recommended either the P4 or the Athlon, and
there's a simple reason. Both dissipate tremendous heat, and most recent
motherboards for them are consumer-grade, with poor quality electrolytics.
Couple Indian summer temperatures, dust on the fans and heatsinks, and
the effect of heat on low-grade electrolytics, and you're guaranteed a
rapid failure (outside of the 1 year warranty period, but usually within
3 years). No Athlon or P4 (motherboard + CPU) combination is reliable
enough for 24/7 use. In particular, the P4, especially the higher FSB
versions (533 to 1066 MHz) does not meet timing margins for the entire
range of ambient temperatures commonly encountered during Indian summers. 

Pay attention to the heatsinks/fans - if possible, use an oversized one
running at low RPMs in preference to the original small OEM one running
at high RPM.

Motherboard stability: Basically, a reliable well-known chipset platform,
with ECC support and high-quality engineering. The choices are 440LX/BX/GX,
Serverworks LE/HE, and AMD 81xx, all which are highly regarded. The AMD
is for the Opterons (choice 9), which needs further research. The 440GX
for the PIII Xeons was also pretty good, but those Xeons were expensive
and hard to obtain. 440LX/BX, supporting Mendocino Celeron/PII/PIII are
widely available at commodity prices (Rs.1k-3k) and would be my 
recommendation.

Conclusions: If you want low cost, the Mendocino Celeron gives a
very good ratio of cost to reliability, running on
a 440LX or 440BX motherboard, with ECC SDRAM. This combination has
uptime potential (continuous running) of anywhere from 1 to 5 years
without rebooting. They're relatively slow, at 533 MHz, but that 
doesn't matter for a server. Just stuff it with a Gigabyte of ECC RAM.
Cost: < Rs.2k for CPU + motherboard

(As an alternative, if you can get hold of a Serverworks motherboard
with Tualatin support, the Tualatin Celeron 1 to 1.4 GHz wins hands down.)

If price is not a criterion, the winner is an Opteron/AMD 81xx setup
with registered ECC DDR, and that's going to cost 10 times as much for
about 6 times the performance. Also needs further research on stability.
Cost: Rs.30k upwards for CPU(s) + motherboard.

A middle of the road alternative is an AMD Athlon 64/2800+, which has
excellent price/performance, but motherboard reliability needs further
research.  Cost: Rs.12k upwards for CPU + motherboard.

Dude

The Stalling issue is very common in Linux USB.
The reason is the host controller drivers ( UHCI and OHCI ) and particulary the UHCI are not good enough in 2.4 series kernels.
I don't know how good it is in 2.6 kernels.

Some quick suggestions / questions

If you have the access to source code, try to clear the stall condition. ?
The USB subsystem provides calls for clearing stall.

USe only OHCI, It is much better than UHCI.

Plug out the usb modem and plug in again. ( BTW does the stall condition occur to you at regularly at some time or is it arbitrary )

Count me in for LAMP. Just tell me what do we need to do. Working
Demo. Then I nedd the system up and running with LAMP pre configured
to avoid hiccups. Otherwise I can bring a slide show with some generic
code and snapshots.

Sorry for that. Always felt LAMP was programming. Now I am serioulsy
in trouble. LAMP is 1 thing i know to do properly (a bit huh, hey i do
know C/C++/Java/Perl/Bash but i dont really like them as I like LAMP)
and it is said to be something genral in Linux. Come on. Please get it
up as programming.

Ok getting to the point

As fas as the configuration goes I think bringing the relevant
httpd.conf snips should be relevant. LAMP really does not need much of
configuration now i guess. It does get running easily. I think giving
brief ideas of how to strt it would be better. Hence I feel code is
what i will get. Then I really need somebody to get a pre configured
system with LAMP up and running (and tested if possible please). Could
somebody who can take charge for this let me know as i cant bring
along my PC from Vellore.

( :-) Slide show is what i will have to make and tell.)


Also directions regarding the meet venue would be really helpful for a
guy like me. (Dont know tamil And dont know chennai much either,
However I have had a swell time of my life in Tamil Nadu besides
having made some bvery good friends here.)

> Afternoon Schedule (Parallel Sessions like LDD):-

Well if I am not missing anything then the LDD in question here is the
one we had sometime in july or august i guess. Or is it an earlier
one.

How many talks on simultaneously. I serioulsy dont like this
multitasking of talks in conferences as we can miss out on quallity
stuff like this in other talks while we attend something equally good.
I think it is always a good idea to stretch the length of the event
rather than have simultaneous sessions or rather squeeze the sessions
(and lose out on SOME quality) and get a brief idea across. For the
IEEE thing the latter approch could be handy as in depth can always
begained by people through personal education. But basically our aim
should be to get an idea across in 20 minutes of what each technology
is about and what r the options available. This way the talk remains
interesting for those who like it and good for those who dont too (20
minutes aint much to stand a boring talk like 1 that a person like me
would give on LAMP). At this rate post lunch say starting from even at
1500 hours we can have 9 techs discussed in 3 hours.

P.S: The multitasking thing is also something which humans are not so
efficient at as machines are. The talks really need tog get co
ordinated for people to switch from one venue to another which leads
to the point of again having a restrined talk which leads us to the
approach discussed above.

I wonder who would *buy* such reports.  We are hard pressed for
volunteers, and the people who file these reports could instead study 
code, and point out specific bugs if any, that could enable evolution
of more robust code.

This may not have originated from Micros~1 (whatever that is :)

I've used it quite a bit actually. It is meant more as a compatibility thing
- if you are a company that runs Unix and want to migrate to Windows for
whatever reason, SFU is meant to ease the pain of doing that.

Cygwin would be a better choice if you are looking to migrate windows

  I haven't tried it, but I believe it's actually a POSIX API for
Windows. The intent is migrate programs the other way - from
proprietary Unices to Windows.

Hi All,

A small doubt,

knx-hdinstall for installing Knoppix is not working in version 3.6. Is
the feature renamed, reworked or removed.

Its not just a POSIX API - it is an entire environment containing korn, c
shell and most of the utilities you would find on a traditional *nix
platform including Perl,etc.

Many people currently using Windows for production, ask for concrete
ways to migrate to Gnu/Linux. Getting to know Gnu/Linux is ok. Moving
"their" stuff from Windows to Gnu/Linux is the difficult part for some.
So far as email and office suite files are concerned, they are almost
readily interoperable.  But things like large programs written using,
say VB, or accounts on Tally, may get messy during migration, and may be
difficult to port.  We need a clean list of  things that are
interoperable, and things that won't migrate easily. Is there any
program in the free software world that could use VB source code to
build executables? Or, should the VB code be simply dumped, and written
afresh with more portable languages?  A tidy list, in the Indian
context, may help migration in a better way.

Uses gcc [interix?] well, I guess.  Many GNU Project tools have been
"optimised" for SFU, and released under the GPL:

Gambas comes to my mind: http://gambas.sourceforge.net/
It is not a clone of VB though, but you can port your VB apps to gambas easily.

Gambas FAQ: Is Gambas compatible with Visual Basic?

No, and it will never be!

Fortunately, there are many similarities, but do not expect to take
your old Visual Basic code and run it on Gambas without any change.

You can go the troubleshooting page to find some examples of the
differences between the two languages.

I would recommend doing a rewrite rather than migrating the code. Most VB
apps talk to too many Windows components like COM, ADO, etc that it would be
a pain to chase and replace them all. Plus, most VB apps are database apps
using ADO or DAO or databinding which uses this under the covers. VB is more
about the components it uses (in most cases, though I have written an
full-blown interpreter in VB (yes - it is possible - I did it to win a
bet)).

The Opteron 2G generates enough heat to cook a meal. Would not recommend it
unless case has good cooling, additional fans etc.

Nine years for sending spam !! That sounds far too harsh!  I wonder how 
such complicated mischief is even possible, and it may be that the

  I've heard good things about the 90 nm Opterons, and how they're much
cooler than the 130 nm ones - further research is needed.

Hi Thirumalai,

  I got the drivers from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/zyxel630-11".  The 
one dated 08/04, "amedyn".  I am running RH 9.0 and I needed an updated PPP 
which supported PPoA, ppp-2.4.0-2 from samba.org I think.  I chose to upgrade 
to 2.6.9 for no reason other than just trying it out.  When compiling the 
drivers, you can choose to ignore the error with the "bridge" mode for
 this modem.

  There is a start script and a stop script.  The actual connection takes 
longer than in Windows.  The startup script tries to load firmware and takes 
time sensing the ADSL line.  I guess in Windows the firmware is loaded on boot 
and likewise with the ADSL line.  The start script establishes the ppp 
connection also.  The stop does not always cleanly unload the driver.  
So if you stop and try to start again, you might have trouble when the 
firmware is loaded again. Unplug and replug the modem to fix the 
problem (is this the "stall" problem that for which you have 
the workaround below?).

I am scratching my head to recall what else? It will come back to me.  

I had tried this a year back with the 10/29/2003 release and had given up
cursing Touchtel for the choice of modem.

Would be glad to help more.

Karthi

Yeah. Rewriting/Porting costs lot of money and time.

That is the biggest rock which lies in Win to FS conversion.
Or IMO this is the main reason for FS not able to conquer the 
WorkStation/Desktop OS *business*.

Message-ID: <51422.202.56.231.116.1099628411.kourier@202.56.231.116>

Hi,

I'm trying to use my Airtel GPRS connection under Linux.


Status: pppd refuses connection due to improper remote IP address
(255.255.255.255)

(what puzzles me: Why on earth would someone use that as an IP address?)

What I did to get GPRS working:

1. Checked for the following details from Windows XP:

a. modem initialization strings
b. authentication type : pap
c. remote IP address: 255.255.255.255
d. gateway address: my own IP is made my gw (10.*.*.*)
e. name servers: automatically assigned numbers...

2. Rebooted into Linux

SuSE Linux 9.1 - Professional
vanilla kernel (2.6.4-52-default)


3. Ran wvdialconf to see if phone is detected.

GPRS modem (LG G3100 model) was detected at ttyS0

4. Set up ppp options to allow
defaultroute,
noauth,
ipcp-accept-local (and -remote)

Among others that are common.

5. Dialed (tried both direct pppd invocation and through wvdial)

6. Tried a few things to "force" it to accept.

a. Edited pap&chap-secrets to "allow" 255.255.255.255

Result: no changes in response.

b. Edited pppd/ipcp.c to disable authentication

if (!auth_ip_addr(f->unit, ho->hisaddr)) {
        error("Peer is not authorized to use remote address %I",
ho->hisaddr);
           ipcp_close(f->unit, "Unauthorized remote IP address");
           return;
        }

The above code snippet, which checks the authentication, was commented
out, so I can make the peer use the IP address without "authentication".

(ps: This was necessary as adding an entry for the IP in pap-secrets and
chap-secrets had no effect on the error message.)

Result: fails when trying to set 255.255.255.255 as remote interface's
address (ioctl failure)

c. Edited pppd/sys-linux.c to set gateway ip=local ip

- SIN_ADDR(ifr.ifr_dstaddr) = his_adr;
+ SIN_ADDR(ifr.ifr_dstaddr) = our_adr;

Result: connection established. But, routing failed miserably. I was not
able to add a `route` so I could do virtually nothing with the ppp0 link.
Because nothing was reachable. (Obvious! But I gave it a shot)

7. Called Airtel to know what protocol they were using so I can figure out
how to set it up.

Result: they didn't know what they were using on their side.

----------------------------------------------------

If anyone has further information which you think could be of some help,
kindly share. I'd appreciate it.

Thanks!

That spam was "girls with horses" type stuff (and no, I dont mean a ladies
gymkhana at the guindy race club), and it was sent through several hundred
thousand hacked machines around the world.

That spammer (Gaven Stubberfield aka Jeremy Jaynes) was supposed to have
about 20 million dollars liquid assets in black money, that was held in
various offshore accounts, from running this illegal porn operation and
sending spam for it.

So - spamming, cracking servers to spam, laundering money etc etc - sure,
worth 9 years.

  A request - The title of my talk is "Introduction to Linux",
and it is a non-technical introductory overview consisting
of only 3 slides. It will take only 15-30 minutes, depending
on audience interaction and questions. It's probably more
appropriate to schedule it before Ramanraj's talk. It will
lead naturally to a more detailed presentation on FSF and GNU
by Ramanraj (FSF/GNU is only a single bullet-item in my talk :-)).

  I can do a demo after the talk sessions are over - perhaps
a short demo on RPM build and install (subject to change).

No. If you boot thru the CD you will always get a root shell(correct

and the installation file is knx2hd as already pointed out.

Cygwin is excellent for a UNIX Environment.
Infosys uses Cygwin widely for testing C code for portability to UNIX .
Add to this the backing from Industry majors like Red Hat and it qualifies as an

Try Mono.
Its MS's .Net Implementation done by Miguel(Novell).
At LINDEC2004 there where showcasing VB/ASP.Net Applications running in Linux.

Another Implementation is the GNU.Net Project.

ASP.Net and VB.Net support is currently limited(unstable) but is expected to make it into Mono.
Though not production-quality I think its apt for testing and portability checks.

This comment is based on a) hands-on experience b]
published and verified data c] hear say ?

Anyhow, I run several Opteron dual processor(250)and 
Quad processor(848) systems in my lab and I haven't
experienced any troubling 'heat' problem.  Few of the
boards run on the bench with just AMD supplied cpu
fans and they been up for several weeks as of this
writing.

Both dual and quad processor based linux servers
are real winners IMHO. Need a good power supply
and proper thermal ventilation.  As SC commented
you need a quality power supply that will meet your
computer power requirements for your server including
pci(-x) cards. You get what you pay for wrt to 
power supplies in the market.

AMD site has enough published data regarding this.  My
experience so far with SUSE SLES 9 and RH AS 4 beta
are very positive.

Any how, what kind of meal you had in mind ?
Broiled prawn ? or micro Chicken Tikka ? 
Either case, Opteron doesn't have
enough real estate with or without fan for that!

Cheers,
Rudy

Sorry to say but you are:

Knoppix 3.6 gave me a user name knoppix logged in to the system.

In the terminal i first typed an su and as there is no password set
for root in knoppix i immediately got the root prompt where i gave
knx-hdinstall to no avail.

Will try the new command today and report. Thanx all.

Looks like a case of having shot one's bolt. Is the Internet & WWW still
largely beta? If "security" of machines depends on short  strings that
could be guessed by others, it is a bit of joke to take that kind of
"security" for granted as foolproof, and blame and convict others for
guessing passwords. Imagine bank managers claiming: "Our bank walls and
safe vaults are made of straw! By law, it is an offence to touch the
straw! Our bank is highly secure". If infallible security is not yet
there, sysadmins or others need to inform users about their
inability to provide infallible security, and users may use the
available services at their own risk.  In short, blaming sysadmins for
this [ok. giving credit too] would help; finding fault with users or
malicious crackers is useless and a very weak form of security.

Of course, even after we do get to the point of having infallible
security where cracking is impossible, other kinds of criminal acts may
still continue, for instance we will then come across cases
like what happens in routine bank robberies:  "sysadmin held at gun
point, millions looted"

Blocking sounds like a reasonable way to deal with spammers. If huge
money laundering is involved, surely that is a mild sentence, but
surprisingly, no confiscations or heavy fines seem to have been imposed.

Bah. So if you accidentally leave your keys in your car, and somebody drives
off with the car, you wont be able to complain to the police and get the car
thief punished?  Or if your house door is unlocked, I can just walk in, help

In cases 2 & 3, the sysadmin is more culpable.

Tighter audits and more regular reporting about usage [probably
automated] should avoid any reliance upon fake letterheads and prevent 
other kinds of frauds.

Basically, a fortress needs to be strong on its own strength.  If a
fortress falls, it is as much as losing the kingdom, and a new ruler
enters into the picture, and he will make and enforce his own rules.
While a fortess may fall, a car may be stolen, there are no reasons why
these material world metaphors should be carried on to the electronic
medium where it is possible to build fortresses that can never fall, and
cars that can never be stolen.  It is a pain to see people being charged
and convicted, and there should be no scope for that atleast on the
Internet and WWW.

The ~8 char login/pwd that was good 10-15 years back, and which is still
suitable for academics to share free info on the internet, is obviously
not suitable for securing transactions involving banks, private
correspondence, etc.  Fixing that will discourage abuse.

that is comparable to the 8 blind men who felt each part of the elephant

just fixing security is no use - you need technical solutions, sure - 
but you need legislative, ISP antispam policy etc measures, you need 
user education about spam and security, etc.

Hello All,

HOWTO Reach the Central Lecture Theater (CLT):-
---------------------------------------------

Reaching CLT is very easy. Bcoz it is opposite to Open Air Theater 
(OAT).

1) Enter thru Main Gate. 

2) Reach the Gajanthra Circle (GC) (~2KM)

3) Take the Hostel Road.

4) CLT is 100 meter away from the GC. On the road, you can see Central
   Library & OAT in Left side and Admin block on Right side.

Read: http://www.chennailug.org/location-tenet.php

NOTE:
----
1) If you come with PC/Laptop, then write the items in a plain paper,
show to the Security and get a sign from them. This will avoid
unnecessary problems, while going back from IIT.

2) Today evening (around 7PM), I am going to IIT to check the LDD
Hall. It is Nice, If Volunteers also join with me.

Hi,
I backed up the files and restarted with default boot
type as 5 (GUI mode). it didnt seem to work out as the
GUI seems to crashed after the intial boot sequences.
i also tried the "monitor-shutdown" method with
failure. i tried booting with the commandline entry
(init=3) and once inside, i triggered the GUI
(startx). that seems to work fine.  ut if i try to
revert to my normal GUI boot-up sequence, the problem
reoccurs. how come it works when i trigger GUI from
within the command prompt and not in the initial login
screen? what am i missing here? can u pls give me any
other leads in this?

Thx in advance
Joe

OK. _Good Education_ in general, may be the most important thing needed.

This thread started with a first conviction in the US, and we can close
it now with the first conviction here in Chennai [Dubious distinction of
being the first in India, first under the IT Act etc. etc.]

HOWTO Reach the Central Lecture Theater (CLT):-
---------------------------------------------

Reaching CLT is very easy. Bcoz it is opposite to Open Air Theater 
(OAT).

1) Enter thru Main Gate. 

2) Reach the Gajanthra Circle (GC) (~2KM)

3) Take the Hostel Road.

4) CLT is 100 meter away from the GC. On the road, you can see Central
   Library & OAT in Left side and Admin block on Right side.

Read: http://www.chennailug.org/location-tenet.php

NOTE:
----
1) If you come with PC/Laptop, then write the items in a plain paper,
show to the Security and get a sign from them. This will avoid
unnecessary problems, while going back from IIT.

2) Today evening (around 7PM), I am going to IIT to check the LDD
Hall. It is Nice, If Volunteers also join with me.

I am not sure about the current POSIX API -  sounds like it is
better now. But for a long time the general impression seemed 
to be that, MS maintained a crippled POSIX API in order to get
a foothold in government contracts.

If you are using the x font server (xfs daemon) just restart xfs

If you are just defining font paths directly in XFree86.conf or 
Xorg.conf, make sure the font directory where your ttf files are located 
is defined in xorg.conf (if not - define it, and then run fc-cache to 
update the fonts cache.

You must not use the Konsole found in the quick launch toolbar. 
Instead try pressing Ctrl+alt+F1 and you would get a root shell. there 
you can type knx2hd and you can install knoppix to your harddisk.

Create a .fonts dir in your home dir and restart the X, then fonts
will get automatically identified by the X.

Hi everyone,
  As members of ILUG-C, It is our duty to make aware about Linux to
the people of this city. It would be better if we start a ILUG-C blog,
instead of just a mailing list. A blog would benefit both the ILUG-C
members as well as the other netizens.

http://www.idc.com/groups/isi/main.html

The status of the Indian information economy as a paper tiger with very
little impact on social growth is well known to the knowledgeable. The
annual IDC survey bears out the reality by placing India at the bottom of
the heap; 51 out of 53 nations surveyed. Some mandarin in Delhi will be
quick to point out I'm sure that Pakistan, and also Bangladesh, Sri Lanka
and Nepal didn't even figure on the survey.

The bulk provider of IT services for the world has a real problem creating
an IT enabled society at home.

India ranks 51 in global high-tech polls
Sunday, 07 November , 2004, 12:20

New Delhi: IT leader India ranks way down at 51 out of 53 nations in IDC's
Information Society Index (ISI) 2004, which measures the abilities of
countries to participate in the information revolution.

South Korea is the only Asia Pacific country to rank within top ten in IDC's
ISI, climbing four points over last year to reach 8th position, while China
rose from among the bottom five last year to stand at 44 in the latest list.

The ISI study combines 15 variables in four infrastructure pillars to
calculate each nation's ability to access and utilise information capacity
and wealth. The four pillars are: Internet, Computers, Telecom and Social
factors.

India's overall position at 51 comprises a ranking of 43 in Internet, 51 in
Computer, 53 in Telecom and Social factors at 51, indicating that there is
far less ability to access and use information and IT than other nations.

For China, the aggregate ranking of 44 includes Computers at 46, Telecom at
39, Internet at 38 and Social factors at rank 48.

In much the same way that gross domestic product (GDP) measures a country's
economic wealth, the ISI measures its information capacity and wealth, IDC
said.

The pillar for Computers measures the number of PC households, IT spending
as a percentage of GDP, software spending as a percentage of total IT
spending and IT services spending weighted against GDP.

The Internet pillar factors in the number of net users and e-commerce
spending; the Telecom pillar measures variables related to broadband
adoption, wireless services and mobile handset shipments while social
factors evaluate a society's ability to utilise IT by measuring education,
civil liberties and government corruption.

Among the top 20 nations, Denmark displaced Sweden for the top slot,
followed by United States at 3rd position and Switzerland, Canada,
Netherlands, Finland, Korea, Norway, UK, Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore,
Austria, Germany, Belgium, New Zealand, Japan, France and Taiwan in that
order.

''While majority of the Asia Pacific countries have fared average with
regards to the Social index, many captured top ranks in the Telecom and Web
related indexes,'' Asia Pacific Central Research Group Vice President Kitty
Fok said.

''Rapid adoption of broadband technologies and roll out of wireless
infrastructure and services in countries such as South Korea, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Taiwan and Japan, have resulted in these comparative standings,''
IDC added.

  I guess there are not many surprises here - to be able to use IT effectively
requires a society that wants to create more free time through efficiency
and productivity for a higher quality of life. That's simply not a priority
for most of India - there's an intrinsic belief in the fallacy that toil
and drudgery is a difficult-to-practice virtue: witness the frequent lament
that Indians dislike working *hard*, as if hard work was a desirable ideal.
Nobody ever laments the fact that Indians are unable to work *smart*, and
leverage advances in technology that may have occurred elsewhere, through
free trade, rapid adoption of automation, acquisition of capital assets at
favourable prices, etc. (there some exceptions - VSNL and Reliance buying
transcontinental fibre at fire-sale prices may be one of these *working
smart* exceptions, but it's too early to say).

  I'd rate Japan much higher than 18, and certainly higher than Singapore
and Hong Kong on the list, though.

Use rxvt, or good old xterm. I would suggest Eterm if you want a spiffy 
looking terminal. Konsole and gnome-terminal are perfect examples for what 
I call "bloatware" !

> OpenOffice Writer - 1:20 seconds

If you are willing to sacrifice some features and MS-Office compatibility, I 
would suggest Abiword. Its lighter and faster than OO Writer. I would 
personally prefer LyX, though. 

> Firefox  - 15 seconds

You dont have much of a choice here. Yes, there's Opera 7 which is 
lighter than firefox (and faster too). But I'm afraid that you will miss 
some of the cool features of firefox. Earlier posts do talk about other lean 
web browsers worth exploring.

Fonts Installation procedure:
*  Copy TTF font in the TTF font directory.
(On mandrake, it is /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF)
* Run 'mkfontdir' command from the TTF font directory.
* Restart xfs by /etc/init.d/xfs restart
* Now test the fonts in word processor/browser
* Here TOPAZ.TTF (Tamil font) is attached for sample. After installing, check

Nice.  However, Python specific stuff should really be discussed on
the izpug (Indian Zope and Python User Group) mailing list that can be
reached here: izpug at yahoogroups dot com.  The list has been around
for close to three years now!

Nothing much - random ssh probes or other portscans are a fact of life 
on the internet.. and looks like they havent been able to do a breakin

authentication failed each time as you can see from your logs.

so dont worry about it.

if you want, install lids / snort etc.

Dear LUG team,

Thank you for the wonderful presentation on LINUX. More than 20 IEEE
members and 70 IIT students have benefited from the program. The
sessions were well planned and presented. Not all technical sessions
have a demonstration session included. The applications of what was
learn during the presentation was clearly depicted in the
demonstration. The video show added feather to the hat.

Looking forward to have more such knowledge sharing sessions from you.

Thanks and Regards
Jansi

Long back, I have heard that Google plans to acquire

some truth in it.

Subject: [Ilugc] web hosting doubts
Message-ID: <20041109134345.28284.qmail@web51703.mail.yahoo.com>

Hai,
  I need to have n subdomains under a secondary level
domain(abc.com) and I need to have seperate pages for
each http://a.abc.com, http://b.abc.com,
http://c.abc.com, etc...
  
How to make this possible?
 
My understanding as follows
  i) I can have single ip address for all
subdomains(a.abc.com, b.abc.com,...)
  ii) Configure virtualhost(apache)for all subdomains.

Since the No. of subdomains are high,its not an easy
job to configure the virtualhost each time when I
create a subdomain.

Is my understanding correct?

Any suggestion to make it simple?

Sarav

AFAIK, When you are going to host your site with some hosting 
service provider, he doesn't gives you the control over 
the apache configuration files. Instead there will be a control 
panel for your site which will allow you to create sub-domains 
painlessly. Most of the providers use Ensim for control panel.

There is nothing like opening gcc. In your console (command prompt) you can invoke gcc like 'gcc -o hello hello.c'. You should have a program hello.c in the current directory before doing this. For more info type 'man gcc' in the console.

If it was a single CD-ROM installation of SUSE 9.0 Personal Edition, I doubt 
it if gcc comes packaged along with it by default.

Is gcc installed on your machine ? Try typing 'gcc' at your shell prompt 
and check if you get a message like 'gcc: no input files'. There are many 
ways to start learning linux. Here are some tips:

1. Buy a good book on Linux. There are many books that can get you 
introduced to Linux. 

2. Browse through documentation available on http://www.tldp.org/. Though 
the site is vast, you can select specific topics that interests you. 

3. There's an excellent online guide to Linux. Check 
the URL: http://www.icon.co.za/~psheer/book/index.html.gz

4. Socialize with people who use Linux (LUGs for instance). 

5. Google!


Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

Subject: [Ilugc] LDD for IEEE and EEA members
Message-ID: <a0e665a12f88.a12f88a0e665@vsnl.net>

The LDD  on Sunday was a  very memorable event.   Ms. Jansi introduced
ILUGC and IEEE to the  gathering. Sivasankar Chander began the session
with introducing GNU/Linux to the  audience, that was followed with my
talk on FSF and GNU.   The technical presentations by Raja Subramaniam
and Shakthi Kannan were  stunning.  Raja Subramaniam gently introduced
programming  in the  morning, and  took the  EE students  to  the very
depths of programming by afternoon.   Shakthi gave a broad overview of
many  free  software tools  that  could be  used  to  design and  test
circuits with superb illustrations.   Shakthi, please post the link to
your  presentation.   Balachander  and  Bharathi  did  a  live  Fedora
installation.   Knoppix 3.4  CD's  were distributed  to the  students.
Bharathi also  gave a demo on  using Knoppix.  Saravanan  and his team
also gave demos.

IEEE  honoured ILUGC,  and each  of its  volunteers on  stage  with
artful plaques embossed as follows:
 
<quote>
IEEE GOLD MADRAS SECTION

LINUX WORKSHOP
on 7th November 2004 at IIT Campus, Chennai.
</quote>

IEEE  also  hosted  a  sumptuous  lunch  and  tea  for  us.   All  the
arrangements  for  the demo  were  done  with  grace and  taste.   The
students  were  very enthusiastic  about  GNU/Linux  and ILUGC.   Many
wanted to join ILUGC to learn more. Bharathi elaborated on how to join
the mailing  list and highlighted  its policies.  The Demo  Day closed
[also opened!] with "The Code".

We also  had the privilege  of meeting the  members of the  Faculty at
IIT,  who  raised  many   interesting  questions  touching  upon  free
software, during the course of the event.

My presentation introducing FSF and GNU is available for download:
http://personal.vsnl.com/ramanraj/FSF_and_GNU.tar.gz

Though I used  OO Impress for the talk, I have  converted the file for
use with MagicPoint, an X11 based presentation tool.  The presentation
file (FSF_and_GNU.mgp)  is just text.   MagicPoint allows presentation
files  to be created  quickly with  a text  editor, building  with tag
directives for embedding graphics, grabbing command outputs into foils
for live displays during presentations etc.

Official home page of MagicPoint is: http://www.Mew.org/mgp/

This is far too brief, but I hope Siva, Raja, Shakthi & Bharathi
will elaborate :)

Good, but 'Revolution OS' would have been be much better.  For the
"IBM Linux Campus Club" at Anna University which is yet to be started,
we are planning to screen 'Revolution OS' successfully this time as
the first activity.

Well, can anyone suggest a good DVD player in Linux (xine? mplayer?
...) which is  fault-tolerant to as much extent as possible (less
bugs?)?, bcoz our first attempt of screening was not that excellent
(inspite of Siva's reputable effort)

As far as the feedback from those who attended is concerned, myself
and many of my friends loved the Perl, Python demos and the talk on
programming, besides the other demos and "The Code" during the
session. Thanks for such a great session.

If I am a service provider, then how to implement

I am talking abt neither client side nor web
interface. I need details abt the server side.

overwhelming?
the ilugc list has several hundred people signed up to it.

Summary: People who think posting web based polls to a mailing list will 
produce any kind of useful response are sadly mistaken, as I've seen 
freom previous such attempts on other lists.

Just re-install it.  

Hint: Visit any website that uses flash/java.  Firefox will allow you
to install the plugins with breeze!

It is a bash builtin that expands to the pid of a script / program's 
instance.

http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/internal.html

#!/bin/bash
# self-exec.sh

echo

echo "This line appears ONCE in the script, yet it keeps echoing."
echo "The PID of this instance of the script is still $$."
#     Demonstrates that a subshell is not forked off.

echo "==================== Hit Ctl-C to exit ===================="

sleep 1

exec $0   #  Spawns another instance of this same script
           #+ that replaces the previous one.

echo "This line will never echo!"  # Why not?

exit 0

Hi,

I just want to log the http,ftp,.... URLs accecced in my computer into
a seperate log file.  This is just to monitor the users activity who
use my computer for browsing and I have touchtel provided router.

I tried squid, difficult to set-up .. lengthy manual .. and finally i
configured it to log (access.log). But this happens only if the user
configures his browser to use proxy port and ip.  direct internet is
still allowed!

Just looking for a neat and simple solution (squid is not necessary
for URL logging)

Hi Gilbert,

Try this,

create a softlink for the jre plugin in your mozilla plugins directory.

check for the jre plugin at

usr/java/j2re1.5.0/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so 

to install the plugin do the following,

*Open a terminal
*change to ur mozilla plugins directory
*issuing the following command 
 ln -s /usr/java/j2re1.5.0/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so

if it is jre 1.4.2, this libjavaplugin_oji.so is in 
plugin/i386/ns610-gcc32 directory of jre.

Dont copy the libjavaplugin_oji.so to ur mozilla plugin directory, it
will crash the browser while loading a java applet.

Assumption is made that ur jre is installed in /usr/java/j2re1.5.0, if
other please change the above command as suited.

Dont forget to enable java in ur preferences of firefox.

For more information pls. refer

we also have updates for all the fedora releases; updates include i386 and

Message-ID: <20041114045237.GA15933@symonds.net>

Hi,

I  have an  athlon XP  2600+  on a  VIA KM400A  motherboard. The  ACPI
temperature  sensor reports  '65 C'  as the  CPU temperature.  Is this
considered "okay" for an Athlon XP 2600+?

I donot have any fans in my cabinet, I'm anyway going to buy some. But
I'm wondering if  there could be any other cause  for this. (Note that
my loadavg is around 0.20 (ie.,.  when I have just launched a few apps
and running XMMS) and never gets to cross 1.20 even when compiling the
kernel).

cheers,

it does generate heat .. and will heat up even faster in a non A/C room, 
and when you have to face frequent power surges / voltage drops etc that 
your power supply has to compensate for

Get a big cabinet with lots of fans and good ventilation .. well worth 
the money ... unless you like buying new motherboards that get fried 
ever so often.

Yes, this is quite funny to ask, but I am looking for a wireless
keyboard (must be compatible with Linux).  I use my computer mostly
for programming, so need a 'comfortable' one than with
bells-and-whistles like multimedia keys, .... .  I wonder if some of
them will come with thinkpad style mouse ball.

Looking for suggestions ..

There is one wireless Logitech Keyboard plus Mouse set (yes, its got a
mini joystick  like thing on the  top right of  the keyboard). However
you need  a table or  some 'steady' surface  to keep this  thing. Also
when I tried it at my friend's place by lying on the bed and trying to
operate it, it  was a disappointment to me since it  required a lot of
skills to keep the thing pointed at the receiver. Cost: ~Rs.3700/-

Oh, actually I thought they can be comfortably operated by keeping in
the thigh.

Is this a general problem with wireless keyboards. (The one that I
inquired about was Logitech that is based on RF not IR)

Now it costs Rs. 2400 (logitech)

Oh... that is good news to me.  Now I have to find some really small /

Also what do  you guys suggest for IR  remote controls? My requirement

  Check out LIRC - Linux IR control. It's a piece of middleware that
can be configured to listen to signals from a wide variety of standard
IR receivers and decode a wide variety of universal remotes (like the
$2 made-in-Chine types you can get almost anywhere), and generate
keystroke sequences or fake a mouse event in response.

  I used a stock IRDA port, LIRC, a standard universal remote, and
Xine to experiment with a Media-Center setup. I say 'experiment',
because it was not a great success - when you press a button
on the remote, you have to wait a long time before Xine responds
and starts doing something. By that time, most people would have
become impatient and pressed a dozen other buttons; in conjunction
with the modal UI employed by Xine, you have total disaster.

  Others have had greater success with MythTV and XawTV front-ends,
but I've never tried these.

I am on a dial-up, so if i use gftp to download iso image how long

Downloading  ISOs  over dialup  certainly  requires  a  great deal  of
determination J.  I  suggest you use wget instead of  gftp so you dont
have to tax IITM's bandwidth :)

Assuming 4 kBps, downloading 3 FC3 CD images would take around 5-6
days to complete (without interruption)

Find the person in charge and write the CDs in IITM itself.

Hi Gilbert,
try this,

If u have any local theme (which u have downloaded from the internet)
in the form of jar file. visit this link,

http://texturizer.net/firefox/themes/index.html#install

give the filename and click install, 

ur new theme is installed and enjoy.

As Sridhar said u can install most of the themes from the website directly.

Check out the Tools -> Themes dialog to get more themes.

Hi,
      I saw the recent posting by Prof. Sriram. It was really nice to
have a fedora mirror in chn. Does anyone has Fedora Core 3 CD's.

I am on a dial-up, so if i use gftp to download iso image how long
will it take (i am using BSNL Netone connection). If i split this time
into smaller chunks, will the download continue where i left the dl on
previous attempt.

Thank you,

with regards,
ashwin

Hi,

Sify has implemented some sort of spam grouping application which will
tag all the mails which it thinks can be spam with the "****spam**** "
 tag. Why your mail got the spam tag can because , you were using a
suject line that their mail server thought might be a spam. This spam
tag will help you to put a filter and move all the tagged mails to one
folder and pick out wanted ones. If you strictly wants the same
subject and doesn't need to be tagged, you can contact the mail admin
or customercare at sify.com

My god! 
that must have been really tiresome.
Many of us(ie students inside the campus) have the CDs.
We can figure out some way to help others to get it.(during the  next
ilugc meeting ???)
the entire process might take around 1/2 hour inside the campus.

 Firefox Leaves No Reason to Endure Internet Explorer
=20
 By Rob Pegoraro
=20
=20  Internet Explorer, you're fired.
=20
 That should have been said a long time ago. After Microsoft cemented a mon=
opoly of the Web-browser market, it let Internet Explorer go stale, parceli=
ng out ho-hum updates that neglected vulnerabilities routinely exploited by=
 hostile Web sites. Not until August's Windows XP Service Pack 2 update did=
 (some) users get any real relief.=20
=20
 And yet people found reasons to stick with IE -- alternative browsers cost=
 money, were too slow, too complicated, or didn't work with enough Web site=
s.
=20
 No more. Tuesday, the answer to IE arrived: a safe, free, fast, simple and=
 compatible browser called Mozilla Firefox.=20
=20
 Firefox (available for Win 98 or newer, Mac OS X and Linux at www.mozilla.=
org) is an unlikely rival, developed by a small nonprofit group with extens=
ive volunteer help. Its code dates to Netscape and its open-source successo=
r, Mozilla, but in the two years since Firefox debuted as a minimal, browse=
r-only offshoot of those sprawling suites, it has grown into a remarkable p=
roduct.=20
=20
 Firefox displays an elegant simplicity within and without. Its toolbar pre=
sents only the basic browsing commands: back, forward, reload, stop, home. =
Its Options screen consists of five simple categories of settings -- most o=
f which don't need adjusting, since the defaults actually make sense.
=20
 One in particular should delight many long-suffering Web users: Firefox bl=
ocks pop-up ads automatically.
=20
 But Firefox's security goes deeper than that. It doesn't support Microsoft=
's dangerous ActiveX software, which gives a Web site the run of your compu=
ter. It omits IE's extensive hooks into the rest of Windows, which can turn=
 a mishap into a systemwide meltdown.
=20
 Firefox resists "phishing" scams, in which con artists lure users into ent=
ering personal info on fake Web pages, by making it easier to tell good sit=
es from bad. When you land on an encrypted page -- almost no phishing sites=
 provide this protection -- Firefox advertises that status by highlighting =
the address bar in yellow. It also lists that page's domain name on the sta=
tus bar; if that doesn't match what you see in the address bar, you're prob=
ably on a phishing site.
=20
 To keep Firefox current with any security fixes, the browser is designed t=
o check for updates automatically.=20
=20
 A "Find" bar at the bottom of Firefox's window lets you search for words o=
n a page without blocking your view of the page itself; as you type a query=
, the first matching item is highlighted in green. "Find Next" and "Find Pr=
evious" buttons jump to other matches, and a "Highlight" button paints all =
of them in yellow.=20
=20
 For searches across the entire Web, a box at the top right provides a shor=
tcut to Google queries, and a menu lists five other sites, including Yahoo,=
 Amazon and eBay. Downloadable plug-ins offer access to such resources as t=
he Internet Movie Database.
=20
 What if that Google search yields four interesting sites? Hold down the Co=
ntrol key as you click each link, and they will open behind separate tabs i=
n your existing window. This tabbed browsing -- a feature shared with almos=
t all non-IE browsers -- is far more efficient and far less cluttered than =
the old one-page-per-window approach.=20
=20
 Busy readers can also use Firefox's built-in RSS (Really Simple Syndicatio=
n) newsreader to fetch updates from Web sites that publish their content us=
ing this standard. This "Live Bookmarks" feature lacks the flexibility of a=
 stand-alone newsreader, but it's also simpler.
=20
 Web addicts can customize Firefox to no end with browser extensions that a=
dd functions and themes that alter its looks. Find the Options window's set=
tings too limiting? Type "about: config" into the address bar and you'll se=
e about 600 preferences to tweak.=20
=20
 I've used Firefox as my default browser since February, and in that time I=
've found few Web sites that don't look right in it. Most of the time, it's=
 the Web site's fault: Microsoft's MSN Video blocks all non-IE browsers, wh=
ile SideStep's airfare-search tool employs ActiveX (an ActiveX-free version=
 is in the works). In these rare cases, I will fire up IE -- it's not like =
I can uninstall it -- or, more often, vote with my mouse and move on to ano=
ther site.
=20
 Switching from IE to Firefox is nearly painless. Download a 4.7-megabyte i=
nstaller, run it, and let it import your existing IE data. Your plug-ins, b=
ookmarks, browsing history and even cookies should transfer over (IE's home=
 page and any saved passwords should be imported, but were not in my tests)=
; you can then pick up in Firefox exactly where you left off in IE.=20
=20
 I think anybody using Internet Explorer should switch to Firefox today. Se=
riously. Even if you've loaded every IE security update, Firefox will give =
you a faster, more useful view of the Web. If you haven't -- or if you use =
a pre-XP version of Windows ineligible for Service Pack 2's security fixes =
-- it would be lunacy to stick with IE.
=20
 (If you're using Mac OS X or Linux, there's no such urgency; Apple's Safar=
i, for example, is a fine browser in its own right and offers a few conveni=
ences that Firefox leaves out.)=20
=20
 Firefox's story doesn't end with this 1.0 version. Some upgrades, such as =
a rewrite of its awkward bookmarks-management interface, are waiting for la=
ter releases. But the beauty of an open-source product like this is that yo=
u can participate in its evolution. Firefox's code is open for anybody to i=
nspect and improve; you can browse a database of bugs (bugzilla.mozilla.org=
) and vote on what you want to see changed next.=20
=20

Dear vel,

For joining win2k client into smb pdc, we need to create machine id into
samba, please try the following steps for creating machine id into samba.

Samba server

# useradd -g machines -d /dev/null -c "machinename" -s /bin/false
machinename$

# passwd -l machinename$

# smbpasswd -a -m machinename


open /etc/passwd
edit the following line

"machinename$:x:500:500:::/bin/bash"


Win2k

we need to add the following to the registry key
- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Service\netlogon\Parameters,

	"requiresignor seal" = dword:00000000
	"signsecurechannel" = dword:00000000

- in command prompt
	c:\NET USE * /DELETE /YES

- goto Mycomputer
 	properties, select computer name tab, enter or change 'domain name',
	enter samba admin user id and pwd, OK

- restart 

please send me the feedback.

Regards,
Saran

Dear saran,
Thanks for your suggestion

I did all the things that you have sent to me already except the
registry settings in client. I don't know what is the value to be set
to those registry settings  and i set the value 1 for both variables
and restarted. Again i am getting the same problem.

I have a doubt in this config,

In my samba configuration , i didnot find the smbpasswd file in the
/etc directory.
Then i created the smbpasswd file by using the mksmbpasswd command.

I dont know that the smbpasswd file is available by default or it has
to  be created.

I have checked the smbpasswd file and passwd file contain the entry
for machine account .

pls give me a solution

thanks and regards,
vel

Dear vel,

By default samba password file stored in /etc/samba/smbpasswd, plz chk this
location and find the details about machine account info also. Win2k
registry key should be 0 in both value 

Please make sure most of the time we forget to create login id (userid) in
samba.

Hi
mkisofs -o file.iso -b <eb-5.2.4-rtl8139.zdsk>  -R -J -v -T \ 
<additionaldiryouwanttowrite>

This will create a iso  file by name file.iso. -b is for bootable CD image 
with the file name of the image as parameter

cdrecord -v dev=0,0,0 speed=8 fs=20M -eject -data file.iso
The dev should have your corresponding device entry. Mine is 0,0,0 :-)

"Last post?"

Hi folks.  If you're reading this, I thank you.  Perhaps you'll have a role
to play in bringing about the miracle that I desperately need.  First, I'd
like to apologize for the lack of updates lately in Slackware -current and
stable...  I know there are a few outstanding issues that need to be 
addressed.  However, I've been too sick to work for a couple of weeks and
now I am away from my computers and at my parents' house in Fargo, North
Dakota where my only online access is through an AOL dialup.  I have told
only a select few people about what's going on thinking that I did not want
the internet at large to know about this, that I'd get it taken care of
and get back on track without a major problem.  Now, I'm hoping that this
will get seen by a lot of people and that if it hits Slashdot that some
kind medical geek will help save my life.

I've generally been a pretty healthy guy.  Nobody I know would characterize
me as a hypochondriac by any stretch, so when I raise an alarm it tends to
be for real.  I'm going to give a timeline and run through all the
symptoms I've had (so if that sort of thing grosses you out, you can stop
reading right now).  For the rest of you, here goes.  This is going to be
long, but hopefully somebody who can help will read it...

This all began quite some time ago, perhaps as long ago as May of 2001.
I was preparing Slackware 8.0 for release and working really hard.  A pain
developed in my shoulder, and (too busy to do anything about it right
away) I ignored it and continued to keep working.  It got to be pretty
bad and one afternoon in early June I was rushed to the emergency room
at a hospital in Concord, California.  I was sweating, feverish, with a
weak pulse of around 50, experiencing chills and seeming to be on the
verge of passing out.  The doctor who saw me did a chest X-ray and didn't
think it was too unusual.  I was told it was probably bronchitis and was
sent home with a prescription for ciprofloxacin which mostly cleared up
the problem.  Still the pain in my shoulder seemed to vaguely remain.
By mid October of 2001, I was in bad shape again.  My parents asked me
what I wanted for my birthday and I told them some more Cipro.  They
found someone who was able to help me out with a 60 day supply (no small
task as this was right after the infamous Anthrax mailings when all the
newspapers were running articles about Cipro and people were trying to
horde it).  I finished the two month course of antibiotics and felt
better.  Not perfect, but significantly improved.  I chalked the events
of 2001 up to stress, but in retrospect I am not so sure.  I had
similar problems in 2002 and 2003 that were also knocked back with some
antibiotics, but the pain in my left upper back (and some kind of 
"presence" there) never did fully clear up.  Tests for TB came back
negative.

Fast forward to May of this year.  I found myself complaining about "my
usual pain", as I had started to call it, more and more.  I was starting
to wonder if I was even going to be able to make my annual camping trip
out in western New York state at the beginning of July, but I did go.
I figured the sun and a little exercise would do me some good, and I
did feel a little less like I was "fixin' to die," but upon my return
to California things started to go downhill for me again.  This whole
time I was coughing up some strange stuff.  Some of it was white and
reminded me of dental plaque.  In spite of being a dentist's son I've
never had the best oral hygiene so I'm familiar with plaque.  The
"plaque" I was getting out of my lungs was some nasty stuff and
smelled just like dental floss used after a couple of days without
brushing.  Yeah, I know I should be better about that, but tend to
stay up late and if my wife is already asleep don't always turn the
light on and wake her up so I can brush before bed.  To help me avoid
more tooth decay my dad bought me one of those fancy rechargable
electric toothbrushes that really powers away the plaque.  It also
creates a fine aerosol mist of plaque, and I started to wonder if 4
years of using this brush had caused me to breathe in some of this
plaque mist and moved an infection into my lungs.  I inquired with
several physicians about "lung plaque" and most of them had never
heard of such a thing.  One told me he had heard of something like
that in people who were exposed to asbestos, though.  Searching on
Google didn't turn up any relevant hits on the subject.

By early September 2004, I was spending a good portion of the time
I'd normally be working online flat on my back instead.  The pain
that had started in my left upper back had moved into my left side
below the ribs, and my right side just under my armpit, too.  Being
an ex-smoker, worries of lung cancer were starting to consume my
thoughts.  A close friend of my father's had recently died from that
disease, and his initial symptom was also shoulder pain -- in fact,
they treated him for a presumed pulled muscle for many months while
the real problem went undiagnosed.  Sometime in October I decided 
that it was time to pull my head out of the sand and get in to see
my usual physician who runs a small clinic in Concord, tell him all
of this stuff, and at least try to get cancer ruled out.  He ordered
chest X-rays, blood work, ran an EKG, and checked all my usual vital
signs.  I told him about the "lung plaque" and reported feeling weak
all the time with no appetite.  Being 6'2" and about 145 pounds I
knew I didn't want to be losing any weight.  He also listened to my
chest and like all the doctors I've seen this year thought it sounded
mostly clear, like there wasn't anything major going on there.  The
X-ray was a little different story though.  It was taken on a
Thursday and I was told not to expect to hear anything until sometime
the next week.  Well, the next morning the phone rang and it was my
doctor.  He told me there was something "suspicious" seen in my left
upper lung (right about where the long-standing pain was), and that
I needed to get some more X-rays at the local hospital instead of
the imaging center I'd gone to before.  They weren't going to be able
to get me in there until the next Monday.

The next morning I decided that I'd better FedEx some T-shirts that
my friends at the GUS in Brazil had been waiting for (not knowing
how much longer I could procrastinate on that, etc).  While driving
back I felt a sharp pain in my left side and felt something in there
pop and drain (maybe into the pleura?), and since cancer was well on
my mind, as well as the fact that this had been going on for way too
long, I headed straight to the nearest ER hoping I wasn't bleeding
internally or something like that.  By the time the doctor there saw
me I was holding onto my left side which seemed to help the pain a
bit.  He ran a UA (and called it "questionable") and sent me down for
a CT scan.  No iodine dye -- just a lower abdominal scan to see if I
had any kidney stones (and yes, I related as much of this other info
as he had time to hear in a busy ER).  No stones were found, but he
wrote me a script for Cipro and some pain medication.  I showed up
at the hospital the next day (in only slightly better shape) to try
to schedule additional X-rays, but they had misplaced the fax my
doctor had sent in, and they didn't want to schedule additional images
until they had seen the first ones.  I never did see those myself,
and the imaging center requires a 48 hour notice to check out films.
It was starting to look like going through this medical center was
going to be a slow process, and I wasn't sure I had that kind of time.

So, I made the decision to pack up the car and drive back to North
Dakota from California.  My Dad has been part of the medical community
for years there, and knows a lot of people.  I figured he would know
who I should be seeing, and could help me set something up.  A week
ago Sunday (Nov. 7) my wife Andrea and I set out to make the 1680 mile
drive to Fargo.  We made it as far as Monida Pass.  This is a mountain
pass on the Idaho/Montana border with an elevation of 6820 feet.  On
the way up the grade I knew it wasn't going to be kind to me.  I felt
an intense squeezing under my sternum and started to sweat and nearly
passed out.  I've never previously had any trouble with high elevations
and have done hiking and mountain biking at much higher ones than this
particular pass.  Luckily Andrea was driving at the time!  We decided
that we would stop at the next fairly large town with a hospital and
see what they could do for me.  This was Butte, Montana, an old mining
town, and home of St. James Hospital.  The folks there were absolutely
wonderful to me.  They did some more blood work (finding only a slightly
low potassium level), chest X-rays, and a CT with the iodine.  They
didn't wait long for the dye to circulate because they said the main
goal there was to insure I didn't have a pulmonary embolism.  I did not
have that.  The doctor and radiologist also told me my lungs looked
"slightly inflamed" and to stay on the Cipro, but that I was unlikely
to keel over before making it to Fargo, especially as I'd be losing
elevation rapidly upon heading east.  They packed the X-rays and CT
scans into a big envelope and told me I could borrow it to take to
my doctor in Fargo, and that they see a lot of people come in from that
pass with similar problems.  So, off we went.  I was mostly ok getting
back to Fargo, but never lost the feeling that someone was leaning on
my chest pressing on my sternum, and was occasionally short of breath
even after getting down to the 1000 foot elevation.

Back in Fargo, I had an appointment with an internal MD on Thursday
morning.  By Wednesday night the pressure under my sternum was so
bad that it felt like I was having a heart attack, and was again
taken to an ER (the Slackware 2004 ER tour continues).  While there
I started to feel better, and the pressure was letting up, and I
did not want to be a GOMER in their emergency room.  The doctor I saw
the next day focused on the possibility of a thyroid or liver problem,
and ran some more tests that came back looking ok.  He thought the CT
from Butte looked "within normal limits".  That night I again got the
squeeze (pericardis?)  but suffered through it because I did not want
to go back to the ER.  I've had at least one strong attack every day
since, along with the sensation of "pop and drain" in all the original
pain points and under my sternum.  The next day (Saturday, 13th) I went
to a local clinic with an MD in private practice.  This guy was/is
great, and has seen me about a half dozen times since.  He agreed
that I had signs of serious infection, including a disgusting
garlic/sulfur smell you could detect at 50 paces.  He put me on
levaquinone and metronidazole hoping to have a better chance of
covering whatever the responsible bacteria was.  Took more X-rays
but couldn't see anything obvious.  We discussed getting an
echocardiogram to look for pericardius.

Then, I got my Google breakthrough.  One of the symptoms I'd
noticed over a year ago was feeling like something hard was stuck
in my throat causing me to cough.  Maybe 4 times I was able to
recover was looked like a small (<= 1mm), round, hard granule that 
was light yellow in color.  I'm sure I swallowed a bunch of them,
but hadn't seen too many examples and had not remembered to
mention this to any MDs along the way.  I googled for "yellow lung
granule" and maybe the third hit mentioned something called
Actinomycosis.  There it was, a laundry list of the symptoms I'd
been experiencing.  Furthermore, the disease is caused by the
same bacteria that normally lives in the mouth and in dental
plaque.  Infections are most common in the jaw, but sometimes
occur in the lungs and spread elsewhere through the body.  The
hallmark of the disease is the finding of small granules of
sulfur.  Aha, I thought.  Now that I know what this is, I should
be able to get some treatment.  I tried "sulfur lung granule" on
Google instead and had a ton of hits, all highly relevant to
the situation I was experiencing.  I printed out one of the hits
from the Johns Hopkins Microbiology newsletter and raced back to
the clinic to tell Rodney about it.  He looked it over and
thanked me for doing so much work for him (whatta guy :-), and
on the basis of what I'd told him felt there was a good chance
that we were looking at the answer right there.  None of the
antibiotics I was on would touch this -- they were all too modern.
That was one of the terrible side effects of old antibiotics;
they would kill the natural flora in the mouth and GI tract and
you have all kinds of problems like fungal and yeast infections
as a result.  So the newer classes of antibiotics are carefully
chosen to avoid killing those types of bacteria, and this was
probably caused by Actinomyces, the most common bacteria in the
mouth.  When found in a lab culture, its presence tends to be
discounted as normal.  So, what kills this stuff?  Good old
penicillin.  Yup, while everything else in the world became
resistant to penicillin and amoxicillin, Actinomyces israelii
never did.  Rodney had me quit taking the other antibiotics and
put me on amoxicillin (even though V-cillin-K 1g qid might have
been a better choice).  I've been on it for a couple of days and
I'm doing a bit better.  I don't stink anymore and the palms of
my hands have quit sweating.  He also gave me five days of
prednisone which seems to be lessening the frequency of the
chest attacks, although one did get me out of bed at 03:00 last
night (and I took the opportunity to start working on this report
hoping to save myself).  Problem is, things are somewhat
contained, but still appear to be spreading.  I'm getting sudden
pressure releases occasionally that seem to be coming from the
pleura or pericardium, and this morning had one that seemed to
be inside my head.  This has me more than a little concerned.
- From everything I've read about this, it is a really tough
thing to treat.  Oral penicillin generally does not do it.  What
is needed is 2 to 6 weeks of IV penicillin G (12 to 24 million
units a day), followed by 12 months of V-cillin-K 1g four times
a day.  Amoxicillin 500mg 3 times a day has me in a holding pattern,
but it's probably not going to do the trick.  Rodney has no ability
to directly admit me to a hospital without first sending me to an
infectious disease MD there who would have to agree with all of this.
I have an appointment on Friday.

There you have it.  That's where I am today.  If anyone out there
is familiar with this and is able to help, please let me know.
I'll travel anywhere I have to at this point.  I can be reached on
my cell phone at (925) 535-9062.  Please call only if you can help
get me some high-dose antibiotic treatment.  I have been trying to
check email at least once a day at volkerdi@slackware.com as well.
I'll accept whatever you'd like to send me at that address (as
usual :-), but if you're contacting me with an offer of help please
add [HELP] to the subject so that I'll be able to find those emails
more easily.  Say prayers, knock on wood, whatever.  I need all the
help I can get.  Anything sent here will be confidential unless you
say otherwise, too.  I also hope if I'm off the job for a couple
more weeks that the Slackware community will still support me when
I can return to the job, which I'm really itching to do ASAP (I'm
not looking for donations though).  This experience has changed my
perspective on a lot of things, and I think the future will be
different (and better).

Oh, there's this blood test result which I should also mention.  
While almost everything looks normal there, the following white
cell counts are (barely) out of the normal range:
Neutrophils     79        (high)  NormalRange = 40-75
Lymphocytes     16        (low)               = 20-45
Absolute Eosinophil 0.00  (low)               = 0.015-0.500

BTW, my login quote tonight was "Snow and adolescence are the only
problems that disappear if you ignore them long enough."  heh.

Thanks for listening.

Hi Saran,
I set "0" for both reg. settings and again tried to login , gives same error.
Usually there is a smbpasswd for storing samba passwds.

 But in my machine i created this file manually using mksmbpaddwd
file. So this could be reason for this problem.

What i am going to do is , reinstall the samba package and configure
again and will get back to you.Meanwhile if  you find any solution pls
tell me.

Thanks

I have located this call in $LINUX_HOME/linux/kerne/context.c

But where is the header that shows the defination of this prototype

  Are you writing kernel-mode code (i.e. code that is part of a device
driver or kernel module) or user-mode code (i.e. code that runs outside
the kernel and uses syscalls to access kernel functionality) ?

  If it's the latter, you can't use kernel_thread() in your code (at least,
not directly).

A grep would help you for every such need. When using emacs, you
can jump directly to the line in a file where the pattern
occurs..

hi again, 

How can I use synchronization machanism at kernel-mode between two 
threads I have created using kernel_thread(1) and kernel_thread(2)?

I want to use concepts like mutex and messages queues.. Any pointers?

Thanks for reply and that was right to be called as declaration.. :)

This gives some intro on kernel threads.
http://mail.nl.linux.org/kernelnewbies/2004-07/msg00343.html

Wait queues will work for kernel thread synchronisation......

Ideal solution to find out is to explore the kernel_thread usage in
the kernel source and use the best one.

I assume that you use Fedora Core 3 and give this solution. 
This can be applied for any RedHat/Fedora versions. First 
you have to locate the package that provides the file 
'/sbin/shutdown'. For this do...

# rpm -qf /sbin/shutdown

It should return you the package name that provides that file. 
In my case I got 'SysVinit-2.85-34' as the output. Now you 
have to get the SRPM from Fedora's website 
(http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/3/SRPMS/)
 and install it. Then you will be getting the tarball of the 
sources of this package at '/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES' directory. 

HTH.

Dear Friends,
    I installed FreeBSD 5.2.1 from this month CHIP DVD. It comes with XFree86 4.3.0. The problem is in starting the X server... I have tried the following.

With vesa driver:
* No suitable modes found

With vga driver:
* When the ColorDepth is <= 4. The Xserver starts without problem
* When =8 Starts without problem but the desktop area is very small to work.

I tried all possible configurations for the Color depth and the Modes in the configuraion file.

I used the configuration file of the Knoppix XFree86 config file (with necessary changes) but no use.

---
Ther's no issue starting X with my hd-knoppix installation on that machine.

---
Please help me resolve this issue..

Note:
vesa driver correctly identifies the chip...

Config:
AMD64 2800+
Gigabyte Motherboard VIAK8M800 Chip with onboard video

Message-ID: <20041119074139.30183.qmail@web50203.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,

     In windows OS when i access a file repeatedly,
the OS provides a cache to the file and the speed of
file access time increases a lot.

     In Redhat linux, i am unable to get such a
performance(file access speed). Is there a way to
configure the OS cache in redhat.

I need to provide a proof of efficiency in porting an
application to linux, this is acting as a hurdle to
me.

Any solution is highly appreciated.

Thanks
Murugan

How did you measure? The kernel implements a buffer cache to store portions
of the disk in memory. Google for "linux buffer cache". I got this link [1]
which was good.

Hi

Try out the mknod command from the shell.
Refer to the man page for more info on this.

Hey Suriya, 
     
      OS cache aka buffer cache tuning looks like a

There should be some other way of improving the file

You  should probably  try  other  'light weight'  distros  if this  is
migration you are doing is  for servers in your organisation. Also try
turning off the 'pre-empting' if you are running on the 2.6.x kernel.

Main Memory  based File systems can be  of good help only  if you have
big memory  size.  Also since  the data is  lost during a  reboot, you
need to have a system in place to backup the files (if you need to) to
a  permanent   storage  and  then  restore  it   (which  means  longer
boot/reboot duration)  and _zero_  guarantee for data  recovery during
power failures.

STFW for 'tmpfs'. This HOWTO might be of some help:

http://www.linux.com/howtos/Multi-Disk-HOWTO.shtml

tmpfs  can  be  used  for  /tmp,  but how  many  apps  write  to  /tmp
frequently?

Also, what filesystem are you using?

I just pointed out that the kernel implements a buffer cache. How do say
how bad/good performance is? What benchmarks are you using?

You can use /dev/ram0 or some other device to store data in memory. The (I
think) driver offers 8 MB of RAM space to store data. You can increase
this, if you want to. This is most suitable for Read-only data, since you
will be losing information if the system crashes, if there is a power
failure, etc.

Anyways, this is how you can use it.

% mkfs.ext2 /dev/ram0
% mount /dev/ram0 /ramdisk
 ## write data to /ramdisk
% umount /dev/ram0
% dd if=/dev/ram0 of=/disk.image

The next time you want to use the same data

% dd if=/disk.image of=/dev/ram0
% mount /dev/ram0 /ramdisk


I don't know if this is what you are looking for. You are limited by the
size of physical memory available.

Hi,

Have you configured cups properly?

Try lpstat -a and see if your printers are configured. if they are
configured then something should be wrong with the drivers.

Goto linuxprinting.org and download the .ppd file for your printer and
put it in the /usr/share/cups/model/ and then browse
http://localhost:631 from  your webbrowser.

If nothing shows up then restart cups using 
/etc/init.d/cups stop 
/etc/init.d/cups start

( dont use the restart option bcos it doestn work some times. )

then try localhost:631 again. goto the printers tab and then delete
the printer (as it doesnt work) and then choose add printer and just
answer the q's and in the device list chose the newly listed device
(as per your .ppd file).

then restart cups once more (for your satisfcation) 

hope this helps :)

-Riyaz

Hi,
     If your printer is configured and is working normally. Then go to
the installation directory and execute ./spadmin and configure your
printer in openoffice. I hope this helps you.

cheers

You just had to type 'eclipse' in Google instead of typing this much. 
Now it is enough for you to click on this link.

Message-ID: <20041120152926.12138.qmail@web54110.mail.yahoo.com>

Dear All,
In our company I have configured cvs repository in
redhat 9 server.All client PCs use wincvs and ssh in
win PCs and gcvs in Linux PCs.Everything has been
setup properly.
I also used vss2cvs perl script to convert vss
repository to cvs repository.The difference between
vss checkedout sandbox and cvs checkedout sandbox was
determined using WinMerge directory compare.Wow It was
such an wonderful script.Everything was fine and
identical.[revisions,tags,etc.,]
Now we have decided to use winCVS and do edits using
Reserved-Edit.Conflicts wont occur if people use
reserved edit[We can't use unreserved-checkout model
people are afraid of resolving conflicts].
The problem is that each time when a person needs to
edit a file he has to "update" the file first and then
do "reserved edit selection".Do any of you have
scripts for winCVS that will automatically do "cvs
update <filename>" and then "cvs edit -c <filename>",
whenever a user clicks "reserved edit selection".Look
this must be integrated into winCVS as a right-click
menu item or atleast it must be tcl script or anything
of such sort.
This will be of great use to me.
I also have a doubt,whenever a user clicks "cvs
edit"["cvs edit <filename>] for a file in wincvs, is
it possible to make the server to interpret it always
as "reserved edit"["cvs edit -c <filename>" ]

Thank you
ignacius

Assuming your proxy tunnels smtp requests (which is a bad idea - it can be
abused to send out spam if you dont restrict it to LAN IPs using a firewall
or something similar) ..  you can set your http proxy settings in nautilus or
using gconftool from the command line like this ... that'd make these
settings gnome wide.

gconftool -s -t string  /system/gnome-vfs/http-proxy-host proxy.mydomain
gconftool -s -t bool  /system/gnome-vfs/use-http-proxy true

umask 022 in your fstab for that partition should help you

Scholarly pursuits
Much of scholarly research is learning what others have discovered and
building on it. As the famous Isaac Newton quote goes, "If I have seen
further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." Today we are
launching the beta version of a service which we hope will help this
process. Google Scholar is a free service that helps users search
scholarly literature such as peer-reviewed papers, theses, books,
preprints, abstracts and technical reports.

Just as with Google Web Search, Google Scholar orders your search
results by how relevant they are to your query, so the most useful
references should appear at the top of the page. This relevance ranking
takes into account the full text of each article as well as the
article's author, the publication in which the article appeared and how
often it has been cited in scholarly literature. Google Scholar also
automatically analyzes and extracts citations and presents them as
separate results, even if the documents they refer to aren't online.
This means your search results may include citations of older works and
seminal articles that appear only in books or other offline publications.

We at Google have benefited much from academic research. This is one of
the ways in which we are giving back to the research community. We hope
Google Scholar will help all of us stand on the shoulders of giants.

Google certainly seems to be getting into a lot of things!
but after initial usage i feel this search is heavily dependent
(atleast as of now) on prevelant databases managed other
organisations(universities,libraries publishers etc.)
Google is just helping us getting everything in one place.

And this is a *big* thing. Obviously, you havent seen me searching for my
textbooks on the morning of the exam :) Google Scholar is awesome - the only
issue I have is not all the links are free. On CiteSeer, you were guaranteed
to get a PDF of the paper. Here, a lot of the stuff seems to be paid
subscriptions only. But, hurray to Google for not limiting to free content
only - for now we can see what is there in the non-free world and can buy it
if we want to.

"Linux could be about to fork. In a worrying parallel to the issue
that stopped Unix becoming a mass-market product in the 1980s -
leaving the field clear for Microsoft - a recent open source
conference saw a leading Linux kernel developer predict that there
could soon be two versions of the Linux kernel.






Each version of the kernel requires applications to be compiled
specifically for it. Today, only one Linux kernel is current but
Andrew Morton, lead maintainer of the Linux kernel for Open Source
Development Labs (OSDL), said that he expects the 2.7 version of the
platform to fork to accommodate large patch sets."

Useless post! Linux kernel forks all the time.  2.7 is a fork of 2.6
for example.  See this letter,

    From: Chad Walstrom  
    Subject: Comment: Is Linux about to fork? 
    Date: Fri, 19 Nov 2004 19:43:15 -0600 
    To: kierenm@techworld.com 

    I'm writing to comment on the article "Is Linux about to fork?"
written by Paul Krill, posted on the 18th of November, 2004. Paul
really doesn't do his homework, does he? Nor does he understand the
development process of the Linux kernel. Linux has ONLY been around
for ten years, with a well documented idea behind the "fork" he is
speaking about.

    Currently, the Linux kernel is at version 2.6.9, with 2.6.10
peeking around the corner. This is the STABLE kernel, the one
receiving most of the attention over the last year or so. The kernel
eventually always forks to a DEVELOPMENT branch, in this case the 2.7
branch. Is Linux about to fork? Yes! Does this have any correlation to
the Unix idea of forking? No!

    Kernel-Trap.com covered the recent possible changes to the Linux
Development Model in http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/3513. In general,
forks are good things in the Free Software environment; it's part of
life.

    For a straight FAQ Q&A style of answering the question:
http://www.tldp.org/FAQ/Linux-FAQ/kernel.html#linu x-versioning

        Q: How Does Linux Kernel Versioning Work?

        A: At any given time, there are several "stable" versions of
Linux, and one "development" version. Unlike most proprietary
software, older stable versions continue to be supported for as long
as there is interest, which is why multiple versions exist.

        Linux version numbers follow a longstanding tradition. Each
version has three numbers, i.e., X.Y.Z. The "X" is only incremented
when a really significant change happens, one that makes software
written for one version no longer operate correctly on the other. This
happens very rarely ? in Linux's history it has happened exactly once.

        The "Y" tells you which development "series" you are in. A
stable kernel will always have an even number in this position, while
a development kernel will always have an odd number.

        The "Z" specifies which exact version of the kernel you have,
and it is incremented on every release.

        The current stable series is 2.4.x, and the current
development series is 2.5.x. However, many people continue to run
2.2.x and even 2.0.x kernels, and they als o continue to receive
bugfixes. The development series is the code that the Linu x
developers are actively working on, which is always available for
public viewing, testing, and even use, although production use is not
recommended! This is part of the "open source development" method.

        Eventually, the 2.5.x development series will be "sprinkled
with holy penguin pee" and become the 2.6.0 kernel and a new stable
series will then be established, and a 2.7.x development series begun.
Or, if any really major changes happen, it might become 3.0.0 instead,
and a 3.1.x series begun.

Memory requirements
See http://wwws.sun.com/software/sundev/jde/sysreq.html for memory and
disk requirements

The minimum memory configuration for the IDE is 128Mb of RAM. The IDE
can run with less, but performance is not very satisfying. The
recommended memory depends on the OS, the IDE configuration, and any
other applications running on your system. Recommended memory ranges
from 256Mb for Community Edition on Windows to 1Gb for Enterprise
Edition.

** 1 GB for Enterprise Edition ** - As I said, this is a problem with
Java. (Bottom-line: nothing is perfect, it's all about choice)

Its just an IDE which provides all the project management features plus
plugin features which enables it to be used for different types of project
i.e Java, PHP, Python.  Ofcourse you need j2sdk for running
eclipse.

The below link points to latest 3.0.1

But beware some plugins might not work well with latest stable release.  
I am still

For php you can download the plugins from here.

Dear Friends,

Soemtimes back I installed Conexant Chipset based USB ADSL modem delivered
by  Airtel (Touchtel) in  RedHat 8.0 (2.4.x kernel). I used Olitec driver
for the same. This driver is based on 2.4.x kernel only. It was a
successful attempt and enjoyed browsing.

Now I have installled FC3, which is based on 2.6.x kernel. There is no
Olitec driver available for 2.6.x kernel. So I am trying accessrunner
driver (cxacru) which is available for 2.6.x kernel. Once ppp0 device
created, after some time, I am getting error of "LCP: timeout sending
Config-Requests". I googled on this and tried so many other options
specified there. But no positive signals. Can anybody help me on this?

Details:

Modem: Conexant USB ADSL Modem with VID & PID of 1 & 32 respectively.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] GNU/Linux - CD Maintainers / Area
Message-ID: <20041122171024.8471.qmail@web50206.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

With some of the ISPs providing free Internet hours,
atleast during odd hours, and with the low price of CD
burners, I feel we should have one (or more) GNU/Linux
CD Maintainers in each area or group of areas that are
close together. The CD Maintainers should either have
Internet connection that provides free Internet hours
AND/OR have a CD burner with which they can burn CDs
(maybe you can charge for the CDs?) 

You don't have to write the distros to CDs. With about
5 or 6 common distros and with 40 GB HDD we can easily
download (bittorrent rockz!!) and store the distros,
and burn the CDs when required. It can also be other
GNU/Linux stuff, for instance The_Code_Linux.avi or
Revolution_OS.avi. I should get Revolution_OS.avi
soon, will see how the print is and let you know (700
MB) :)

The idea is that one needn't travel across Chennai to
meet a friend to write or borrow a GNU/Linux CD. So, a
person in Thirunvamiyur can get the CD from a
maintainer in Adayar or from Thiruvanmiyur itself,
rather than travel all the way to say Parrys or
Kodambakkam.

I can take care of Gopalapuram, Poes Garden, Alwarpet.
Similarily there can be CD maintainers for Mylapore,
Santhome, Adayar, Thiruvanmiyur, Kodambakkam, T.
Nagar., Royapettah, Triplicane et. al. Any volunteers?

Your suggestions?

Thanks,

Shaks

The printer what you have is a non postscript printer so u have to
set up ghostscript in openoffice printer configuration. In
properties window of openoffice printer administration use the
following command 

/usr/bin/gs -q -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=epson -sOutputFile=\|lpr -

mine is also a Dotmatrix printer i have used this and works fine

We can have more than one maintainer per area. It does
help too.

So, what you can do is get the distros (CD or hard
disk dump) that you don't have from maintainers in
your adjacent areas. So, you can keep repository
uptodate.

We also need to put up a webpage (either in ilugc or
separate) giving Maintainer's contact info and distros
that each one has. Who maintains the ilugc website?

So far:

1/ Sriram Krishnan <ksriram@gmx.net>

Hi,
 It sound's like your LCP packets are  going through PPP0
interface , check the routing table . You need to have a
route entry specifying the PPP tunnel endpoint as reachable through
a non PPP0 interface . This is usually taken care of by the script
itself , it may not be happening on your machine .
Hope it helps!

Normally such problems occur due to MTU being higher than MTU along the
path. You could try clamping the MTU to PMTU using iptables
(clamp-mss-to-pmtu option). Alternatively, reduce the MTU of the outgoing
interface (suggest 1400) and establish connectivity using trial and error.
This can be done in the PPPoE config file too.

check your smtp logs

and set php mail to use a real sender - if you dont, it will use 
www@your-server, httpd@your-server etc (whatever uid/gid apache runs as)

if there are a lot of emails, set up and use mailman instead of using 
phpmail for this

You could run innd for internal newsgroups.

If you want to give your employees access to public usenet newsgroups 
instead, get a single feed from a place like supernews.net and then set 
up leafnode to cache the newsgroups locally and have all your users read 
it / post through the leafnode ...

Hi,

A 5th parameter was added to Php's mail() function
in  PHP 4.0.5(but disabled in safe mode since version 4.2.3)
which lets you mention the return-path

mail ($to, $subject, $content, $headers, "-f"."returned@mymail.com");

Examples are given in the php manual
http://in2.php.net/function.mail

You can then do a POP3 check to verify if it bounced or not.

I agree with u ppl. It would be good if we have CD maintainers for
each area. It would be good to have a Wiki to update the maintainers
list. It would be great if some ppl come forward for areas like
Tambaram, Chrompet, Pallavaram & Pammal. If I had a writer and a BBand
connection I would have been a volunter for these areas. Please, some
one come forward. It would be of great help to others.

I think Sridhar did post about having CDs available if you are in that 
area and want CDs.

If somebody is in or near Adyar and wants Slackware 10, I will keep a 
copy around .. only problem is that my CD writer is busted, so somebody 
who leaves nearby (Bharathi?) may want to take my CDs, burn themselves a 
copy and help distribute them to whoever wants slackware CDs.

I am in Velachery.  Badly I had deleted many ISOs.  Currently I have
only sarge (first 2 cds) and some set of live cds (knoppix, mephis)
that came through LFY.

I am willing to contribute some disk space for keeping the ISOs and
distributing them.  First we need a wiki.

Hi GNU/Linux folks!

Thanks for all your replies. Appreciate it.

Here is the list of GNU/Linux Distro Maintainers
(GLDMs? or do we coin another name?) as on November
23, 2004 (in alphabetical order):

1/ Chandrashekar Babu <lug@chanrashekar.info>
- Sholinganallur and nearby areas

2/ Prem Kumar V. K. <mailpremkumar@yahoo.com>
 - Parrys, Mint, Tondiarpet, Tolgate, Thiruvottriyur

3/ Shakthi Kannan <cyborg4k@yahoo.com>
 - Gopalapuram, Poes Garden, Alwarpet, Teynampet

4/ Sridhar. R <sridharinfinity@gmail.com>
 - Velachery, Vijaya Nagar, Pallikaranai, St. Thomas
Mount, Guindy Railway Station, Besant Nagar 
 
5/ Sriram Krishnan <ksriram@gmx.net>
- Nungambakkam, Kodambakkam and nearby areas

Wiki is a MUST and it must be done ASAP. We should
make a database there so that we know who has which
distro and who needs to get the distro from the
neighbour. If it is ok with the other GLDMs, we should
also include mobile number as contact info for faster
communication, or if people want to call you and ask
for CDs.  

Either we can exchange blank CDs for distros or pay
for the CD cost? (and not the distro, of course). Your
thoughts?

Thanks again,

Shaks

If the distributor likes it, 'writing cost' (which includes time spent
in writing) ?

Database is not required.  We can put the list in the wiki page.  The
wiki will be probably ready in next week or two.

If people start doing this, it'll get commercialized.. ilugc is not
ritchie street.

As long as the guy burning the CDs gets blank CDs from someone, burns
those CDs and gives them .. he can definitely ask the guy who wants the 
cds to treat him to dinner (or beer or whatever) if he likes :)

Presently the cds4grabs is replaced by the new list (Thanks SK). 
Myself and Sridhar is trying to add Wiki support to our ILUGC Site. 
Hopefully, this will be ready by next one/two week(s).

I totally agree. There are more things to do than
worry about cost, after all, we strongly believe in
"free as in freedom and not free beer" :).

Members who install GNU/Linux can put their
installation documentation in the wiki. Or, if you
have  a link where you already have documented the
installation, you can provide the link. It can also
include the hardware that one has used, which distro,
which components one has got working, which ones are
still being tested etc.

The idea is that new members/members who want to try
out new stuff (hardware/software) can read through
existing documentation and check for hardware
compatibility list (if they find any issues) before
buying hardware from Ritchie street or from any other
dealer.

Of course, we can also add other stuff in our wiki to
provide more info to end users.

Regards,

K Shakthi

Now we get free as in speech as well as free as in beer too ! Maybe I should

Why doesn't / can't the system fix such missing stuff on reboot? Is it
because of the static nature of /dev?  Does udev fix this issue and

My friend in Taiwan once helped a guy he knows (a lawyer) clean a major 
infestation of viruses off his laptop.  It took about a day to clean the 
viruses, update windows with security patches, restore stuff from 
backups etc (downloading took a few minutes at the most .. taiwan has 
real broadband available, not the sort of nonsense you get here!)

That job was worth dinner at a five star hotel for my friend ... and you 
say nobody even bought you a single beer for that sort of work? :)

Yup - hotplug + udev adds / removes devices on the fly, and rationalizes 
the /dev structure rather well.  You'll certainly have no problems with 
random devices that you suddenly delete.

Good good. My current system (SuSE 9.1) does hotplug pretty well and
since I've had no issues with it so far (mostly plugging in USB
storage devices), I never bothered to look into it. Isn't that how
life should be :-)

Hmm.. udev rpm is installed. sysfs on /sys - is this udev's handiwork? 

I've heard Fedora Core 3 includes the shiny new HAL+DBUS combo. Any
reports of delight / squeals of horror from fellow luggies on the
working/non-working of this component of Project Utopia?

(Should this be a separate thread already?! :-D)

If you told this ("get commercialized") in general, it doesn't make
sense.  So wouldn't you be asking for price for doing some some
service to your customer?

There is nothing wrong with people selling CDs for a profit -
cheapbytes.com etc do it and make good money from it.  I just believe
this is not something that ilugc or other lug should get into.

Sorry for volunteering late.

I can take care of Tambaram,Chromepet areas (from 15 Dec 04.)

I can take care of Ayanavaram,Perambur, Villivakkam also as I work
in Ayanavaram.


About cost we should keep in mind that ILUGC also requires some small
fund. We can print CD-Paper/plastic Covers with ILUGC details and
charge 5-10 rupees for this cover(depending on manufacturing cost).
These covers to be given along with CDs burnt. That way a distro of 3
cds may cost only 15-30. The fund so collected by the maintainer can
be given to ILUGC either in part/full (we can decide percentage after
a discussion).

We have to workout something for the common problems we are going to
face in CD-writing,if we accept empty CDs from others.

1.People come with 4x RW cds and it takes hours to copy

2.Bad CDs. Who is to take blame?

    We better make it clear that it is only voluntary work and nobody
can demand any distro and also timely delivery/availability. It is
purely at the discreetion of the volunteer.

I don't want to sound like the cheapskate here - but can't we keep things
simple and informal? For example, someone can just call me up, walk over to
my place, have a chat while I burn a few CDs and then walk off. Any issues
can be sorted out on the spot. Come on - all of us burn tons of CDs for
friends/etc , so I'm sure we can figure out what to do about bad CDs and
stuff like that

Unfortunately my experience in the last three years of giving cd's to
others suggest other way. You get countless calls/emails whenever
something is not alright. 

I don't know what to chat for 1 1/2 to 2 hours while I burn 3 set cds
on 4x RW CD?

Hi,

Thanks for your reply P. Raman. There is nothing late
here. This will be a work-in-progress. As more
volunteers join in the network will grow :)

This is an updated list (v0.2) of GNU/Linux CD
Maintainers as on  November 24,2004 (1:15 PM IST):
 
1/ S. Boovaraahan <boose@eth.net>

7/ Sriram Krishnan <ksriram@gmx.net>

I think it is fair to pay for CDs, say Rs.10-15 per
CD. So, a distro such as Gentoo (with 2 CDs) can cost
about Rs. 20-30. If the user brings his/her own CD,
then we only have to write and give it back, no
charge. One should not pay for service for writing the
CD or for downloading the distros. My thoughts.

Hi Everybody,
I have put up a wiki page for CD Maintainers at the following url: 

http://www.amirtharaj.1800-webhosting.com/phpwiki/index.php?CDMaintainers4Chennai

I invite everybody to use this to create a comprehensive list of
maintainers (areawise, distrowise). We could transfer this list to ILUGC
wiki as soon as it is ready.
Cheers!

Message-ID: <557E17BE74D22143B7BE70EB60E33E9913D23AD6@shlmsg01.ad.infosys.com>

Hello,
 
I need suggestions for a Computer Case.
The PC is a Pentium4 3.0 Ghz (HT) /w 512 MB DDR RAM.
The PC also has a GeForce FX5900.
The room has an AC but its not on 24 x 7.
 
I need a good case that will provide good ventilation and enough space
to accommodate 2 hard disks and 2 CD-ROM Drives.
Should I just go with the vanilla full tower case and add additional
fans as and when necessary (if the temp goes up too high).
 
Shiv, Any suggestions?

Hi Sam,

I guess the problem happens because the initial
history database has not been created. The INSTALL file that
comes with INN source package has this..

======================================================================
=
Creating the Database Files

    At this point, you need to set up the news database directory
    (~news/db).  This directory will hold the active(5) file (the list
of
    newsgroups you carry), the active.times(5) file (the creator and
    creation time of newsgroups created since the server was
initialized),
    the newsgroups(5) file (descriptions for all the newsgroups you
carry),
    and the history(5) file (a record of every article the server
currently
    has or has seen in the past few days, used to decide whether to
accept
    or refuse new incoming messages).

    Before starting to work on this, make sure you're logged on as the
news
    user, since all of these files need to be owned by that user.
This is a
    good policy to always follow; if you are doing any maintenance
work on
    your news server, log on as the news user.  Don't do maintenance
work as
    root.  Also make sure that ~news/bin is in the default path of the
news
    user (and while you're at it, make sure ~news/man is in the
default
    MANPATH) so that you can run INN maintenance commands without
having to
    type the full path......

    ...."control" and "junk" must exist as newsgroups in your active
file for
    INN to start, and creating pseudogroups for the major types of
control
    messages is strongly encouraged for all servers that aren't
standalone.
    If you don't want these groups to be visible to clients, do *not*
delete
    them; simply hide them in readers.conf.  "to" must also exist as a
    newsgroup if you have mergetogroups set in inn.conf.

    Next, you need to create an empty history database.  To do this,
type:

        cd ~news/db
        touch history
        makedbz -i

    When it finishes, rename the files it created to remove the ".n"
in the
    file names and then make sure the file permissions are correct on
all
    the files you've just created:

        chmod 644 *

    Your news database files are now ready to go.
======================================================================
=====

There's also a FAQ page maintatined for inn
http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/faqs/inn.html

Subject: [Ilugc] tomcat & jsp
Message-ID: <4dc6c904041124075647d89bb4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using tomcat 3.3.1, jsdk 1.4.1 on rh7.3.
I have installed the binary under my home dir. I have set the
necessary environment variables. It includes JAVA_HOME, CLASSPATH,
PATH & TOMCAT_PATH.  I am able to run the servlets (shipped with
tomcat) successfully.

But, the problem is, i am unable to run jsp pages. When i try to run
the test script (shipped with tomcat), it is reporting 'error 500,
internal servlet error' as follows:

<error>
Error: 500
Location: /admin/test/test.jsp
Internal Servlet Error:

I have referred the following faq, but it doesn't help much:
http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/faq/misc.html#compile

Could you please let me know what i am doing wrong here ? 
A link would be suffice. 
TIA.

    In the five-year MoU period, Microsoft aims to reach out to over one 
    million students and over 12,000 teachers in government and

To rephrase the same excerpt:
    In the five-year MoU period, Microsoft aims to convert/lock over one 
    million students and over 12,000 teachers in government and 
    government-aided schools to use _their_ products and services. 

It shows that they are desperately trying to avoid Free Software/Open Source
technology from toppling their software monopoly by the next five years or 
so.

Good luck Micros~1!

Err..not really. It shows that they are trying to get more people to use
their products and in this case, the students benefit as well (as they get
to learn technology that they'll be working on when they finish their
education. Microsoft is only doing what..err...every single company does.
Promoting their products. I wonder why nobody protests when Apple ties up
with US schools but people come up with a conspiracy idea whenever Microsoft
does anything.

Do you really think Coke would go around encouraging school students to go
drink Pepsi?

It really doesn't matter who does it, whether Apple/Microsoft/Oracle/Sun. If 
they are trying to penetrate schools and colleges, they are building a 
strategy to lock users down to their products and services - thus killing 
freedom of choice for future companies when it comes to recruiting skilled 
people, and also blinding humble students from understanding their own 
freedom of choice when it comes to deciding their software career. 

> Do you really think Coke would go around encouraging school students to go

In my opinion, both Coke/Pepsi must stay far off from school and college 
campuses. Promoting a _commercial_ product and/or building a long term 
business strategy on educational sectors is plain bad! Any company with 
decent etiquettes would never do it.

As an example, when you were at school, I presume that you were never 
forced by your school authorities to use "Cherry" polish to shine your 
shoes, nor were you forced to use "Bombay Dying" as your fabric, nor were 
you compelled to use "Camlin" or "Hero" or "Parker" pens to write. 

When you were given freedom of choice in the earlier aspects, I believe the 
same holds true when it comes to the current generation students in 
choosing the tools and software of their choice to get their job 
done. By the act of commercial companies penetrating into educational 
segments, this harmony is broken.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

Hmm..then get those pieces lined up. Since I'm a part of this, let me point
you to some stuff

The MSDNAA (www.msdnaa.net) - Provide software to colleges and students for
huge discounts. Around 250+ colleges in Tamil Nadu itself in the short time
since it was launched.

www.microsft.com/india/academia - Check out their student champ programs.
Also, their faculty training programs (which most colleges want and a lot of
colleges are getting). At last count, over 300 student champs (each
representing a college) and several hundreds more trying to get in. I know
'coz I take care of part of the approval process in Chennai.

www.studentprojectprogram.com - Thousands of students ( I think some 45,000
the last time I checked ) from around the country doing projects with
Microsoft's help, guidance and software. First reviews are happening in
Decemeber. From the posts I have seen in the various forums, there is
tremendous response for this..and the poor chaps at Microsoft India handling
this are getting run over by the sheer numbers.

www.cnugstudent.net, http://groups.msn.com/dnughydstudent, etc - The first
group I run - it has over 1000 members in less than a year and is growing
every day. The second link is the Hyderabad group which has close to 1500
and I can show you similar groups from all over the country. Thousands of
students *voluntarily* using Microsoft software and tools - no one is trying
to lock them in.Also, these groups hold events throughout the year. The
Bangalore group just held something called "Date with .NET" which had over
1500 people attending. The Hyderabad group held '.NET Explored' which I
heard had close to 2000 attendees. I'm involved in the planning of one such
event in Chennai.

www.thespoke.net - Students from all over the world( a lot from India)
interacting and doing a lot of cool stuff together. The Imagine Cup
(Microsoft's annual competition for students) is being run from here.Check
the numbers there. Last year, over 900 teams of 4-5 members each
participated from India for the software design alone.Hundreds more
participated in the Algorithmic and other events. This year, the number is
expected to be more than double that.

www.teched.com - See the link for TechEd Academia. I was there when it
happened in Bangalore (though I missed it in other cities). I have never
seen 1000+ faculty (the people who count - HODs,Principals,senior profs,
people like that) in one single hall. The Bangalore event was held at IISc -
I heard similar numbers were achieved by the Chennai event as well. This was
also held in other cities across the country. The previous year

MSDN Academic Yatra (www.microsoft.com/india/events) - Faculty members and
student champs now can get attend free training sessions on the latest
Microsoft technologies. In Chennai, this happens at Le Meridien. Last month,
this was so packed that people couldn't get in.

Project Shiksha - this is being launched now - the link to this sparked off
this thread.

Microsoft Research (http://research.microsoft.com) has tie-ups with some of
the IITs and IISc in Bangalore. I think Anna Univ is involved too though I'm
not sure - maybe Sridhar can clarify. A lot of people doing some pretty cool
research.


There are a lot more programs waiting in the wings...and I think missed a
few in this list.

Do you want more? Seems to me that a lot of students like this 'Microsoft
entering their colleges' instead of being tempted to part with a piece of
their minds. Either that or the 1000 people in my group are nuts. Do try and
understand that because you don't like Microsoft personally doesn't mean
that all other students subscribe to your view. People are entitled to their
own opinions -and a lot of them choose to exercise that right.

Ah..cool. I thought this was another 'M$ conspiracy' thing :-)

I'm not sure I agree. I have a lot of friends who have been working in the
big Indian IT companies(they've just joined). A lot of them struggle badly
mainly due to the fact that they don't have any exposure to real world
programming. Knowing bubble-sort does not make you a programmer. Having
stuff like Java or .NET or Unix or whatever in the syllabus helps a lot.If
you talk to the student community, by and large,you would see that people
want something like this. Unfortunately, people don't want to read Don Knuth
books..they want to read 'Learn C# in 21 days'.

I'm not sure how you say they lock in people. They only promote their own
products - doesn't mean I can't think for my own self.For example, I've
spent over 3 sems with Java and I still hate it (which is a personal opinion
- so don't flame me). On the other hand, I don't have Python in my syllabus
yet I love it. Teaching a student some technology doesn't mean you lock him
in- you're showing him all the options and letting him think for himself.

Though this sounds good in principle, this is non-existent in today's
academic world. Why should I do compiler lab in C? Why not in Python? Why
should I do distributed computing using Java RMI? Why cant I use .NET? When
I study operating systems by Tannenbaum, I get questions like 'Why are
microkernels better than monolithic kernels?'. I would love to write how
today's operating systems are not micro-kernel based..and the reasons for
them not being micro-kernel based. Am I allowed to write that? No.


Let me ask you something - why do you think of this only when Microsoft is
involved? Let's say Redhat had entered into an agreement with the IITs to
make them teach only 'free' software. Would you have protested then that the
choice for students is now reduced (as you're eliminating all proprietary
software)? Choice is good.Helping the students make an informed choice is
another matter altogether.

The Project Shiksha program you mentioned doesn't mean that Microsoft will
have *exclusive* control over the syllabi -they only contribute to it in
various forms of resources. You'll learn about .NET as much you'll read
about Java or something else. If you want another example of Microsoft
involvement in education, check out Anna Univ. Microsoft has huge tie-ups
with them (they even have a lab all to themselves at the Guindy campus as
Sridhar would probably know). .NET is probably going to enter the syllabus.
VB and VC++ are already there. But does this mean that Anna Univ has stopped
Unix labs or Java papers? Absolutely not. Students have the same choice they
had before - only this time, they get a better look at the other options out
there.

What's wrong with showing the students what the industry is using? And what
if the students want it themselves?

This is a FOSS enthusiast list, what do you expect?  MS lovers?  That
said, I think you completely loose sight of several things.  Please
read the whole list of points before responding.

 1. People form opinions and likes and dislikes based on what they are
    comfortable with.

 2. If you make someone comfortable with a commercial tool say, then
    you eventually do lock them in.  It is like addiction.

 3. Not everyone has the luxury of switching lock-stock-and-barrel to
    the "new-fangled" language on the block.  Once you invest heavily
    learning the ropes of a piece of software and are comfortable with
    it to the point of developing a whole lot of functionality with
    it, it becomes next to impossible to switch to something else.
    Students who are still fooling around writing code and learning
    have this luxury.  If you kept switching languages you'd probably
    be an expert in variety of languages known (thats worth brag
    value, yes) but its unlikely you'd have coded much given that
    you've wasted so much time learning zillion languages rather than
    write something truly useful.

 4. MS has a lousy record.  Their prime motive (as is the motive of
    any good company) is to make profit.  The knowledge of the
    student, comfort of the user etc. are secondary.  Given the chance
    MS would want to own as much of the market.  Sure, for competition
    (and other reasons) it is good to have a small bunch of other
    software companies, but this is good only so long as MS has the
    largest market share.

 5. Given this, it is easy to see where MS is headed.  By baiting
    students into using their software (by giving massive discounts),
    getting them totally enmeshed in their tools, making sure their
    tools don't run on other OS's and then conveniently asking these
    students to pay through their noses once they are out of school
    they see a sure shot way of making tons of money at the expense of
    the poor student or the company she works for.  What is so
    honorable about it that its worth defending?!  How does this
    promote choice?  It practically forces the students choice.

 6. If MSFT really cared about computing and its users it would try to
    make life easier for others who do want to make a choice w.r.t
    what runs on their computer.  So why don't we see MS porting some
    of its applications to other OS's?  Why not play fair?  Why not go
    with a policy of "live and let live" rather than "dominate
    everything"? 

 7. Deciding what the school's policy is should really be up to the
    school but any school with sense would train people on the basic
    concepts and not on specific tools.  If a computer engineer can't
    pick up a fancy tool in a little while, he isn't worth hiring.
    Computer scientists are not just people who know how to use a tool
    or a language.  I would think a CS student gets to learn a lot
    more if he/she has access to the sources.  If all a CS student
    does is to use software, that isn't a degree worth having.

 8. By making matters convenient (by lowering prices etc.) so that a
    large fraction of the student population uses your (I don't mean
    you personally) software in order that you make profits eventually
    is a self serving goal.  This has nothing to do with being nice or
    giving folks a choice.  On the contrary it is explcitly a device
    to get people hooked to you.

[...]

    SK> What's wrong with showing the students what the industry is
    SK> using? And what if the students want it themselves?

OK, then show the software in all its light.  Tell folks the real
price of the software and what they'd pay for it when they leave
school.  Tell them that their software is proprietary and cannot be
ported by the user to his/her favorite OS.  Tell them that they are
likely to never port the software to other OS's.  Tell them that their
software runs mainly on x86's and perhaps alphas.  Tell them that if
you have N machines you need *buy* N pieces of this software even
though you are just one user.  Tell them that when they start using
their fancy tools that the same codes they wrote will not run on
another platform.  Tell them that the reason for this is that they
want you to use their OS and not yours.  Tell them that if you change
your hardware setup in some tiny way you need to get permission from
them.  Tell them that they really want your money and could not care
less about anything else.

Surely I missed several there.  Hopefully others will fill in.

True, any company with the kind of power MS has is likely to do what
MS is doing.  My point is, free software is an excellent alternative
for CS students.  You learn a lot, you can actually help a whole lot
of people (but perhaps not enough people care about helping, I don't
know) and you still get your job done for free.  So certainly free
software is a better alternative than any commercial choice.

    >> nor were you forced to use "Bombay Dying" as your fabric,

    SK> Off-topic..I started laughing when I read this. My school used

Pot, meet kettle.

This whole thread is off-topic.  Sriram, if you haven't realized
already, this is a Free/OSS enthusiast list.  Don't expect people to
be kind to MS or to implicitly trust their motives.  They haven't
given anyone a reason why they should.  Besides, you've been here
before and seen what you get.

Dear all,
I also think this to be a trap laid by MS to get
children and teachers like a piper[who blows superb
music using pipe to collect all the rats and finally
drop the rats that follow him into the sea]. I think
MS is some what frustrated and has jealosy on the
rapid development OSS products. Did you people read
the artcile on move from windows to LINUX[1 month
back] in the City corporation of MUNICH... and other
transitions from WIn to Lin.
If you have read this article you would know that MS
has come to a conclusion of trapping children and
teachers in their hand... and getting back to their
position.Adoption to a commercial software in schools
is total idiotic concept.
Why except APJ all other Indian politicians/and
authorities have gone/trying to get into the trap of
MS.I stongly oppose these kind of activities in India.
By all means GOVERNMENT should have adopted to teach
OSS in schools.
Let the discussion continue...

It really doesn't matter who does it, whether 
Apple/Microsoft/Oracle/Sun. If 
they are trying to penetrate schools and colleges,
they are building a 
strategy to lock users down to their products and
services - thus 
killing 
freedom of choice for future companies when it comes
to recruiting 
skilled 
people, and also blinding humble students from
understanding their own 
freedom of choice when it comes to deciding their
software career. 

> Do you really think Coke would go around encouraging

In my opinion, both Coke/Pepsi must stay far off from
school and 
college 
campuses. Promoting a _commercial_ product and/or
building a long term 
business strategy on educational sectors is plain bad!
Any company with 
decent etiquettes would never do it.

As an example, when you were at school, I presume that
you were never 
forced by your school authorities to use "Cherry"
polish to shine your 
shoes, nor were you forced to use "Bombay Dying" as
your fabric, nor 
were 
you compelled to use "Camlin" or "Hero" or "Parker"
pens to write. 

When you were given freedom of choice in the earlier
aspects, I believe 
the 
same holds true when it comes to the current
generation students in 
choosing the tools and software of their choice to get
their job 
done. By the act of commercial companies penetrating
into educational 
segments, this harmony is broken.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

Hi Sridhar:

I did update the list for the different areas.

> Otherwise, this
> would cause
> redundancy and information is copied to multiple
> place.

It is not redundant data. It is data for each separate
area. As an individual I can provide service to
members in 3 or 4 nearby areas that are walkable
distance! It is important for us to provide coverage
for as many areas so that we can reach out as far as
possible.

With volunteers specified for only one area, we get
back to square one. For example, a person in
Kottivakkam may find his required CD only from a
person in Mylapore, if we don't mention the fact that
there is a nearby maintainer in Adayar/Thiruvanmiyur
(who might have the CD).

That is why I had specified earlier to create a
database, volunteers versus areas. Also because some
people may live in one place and work in another area.


The initial list (v0.2) that I had created specifies a
volunteer for many areas.

Regards,

Shaks

The volunteer must be specified for *single* area where he resides
(exceptions are multiple residences, work area, etc...).  But he/she
must not be listed under nearby areas, as the vistors could always
judge the nearby areas and this could avoid the integrity of
information on next update.  What a visitor does is to look at the
areas which are 'nearby' to him.

If many (who are crowded near) had listed ther name under different
locations, this would cause some confusion when choosing the
volunteer. (think about it)

Wrong! expecting a CS student to learn .NET/Java/Unix/whatever-tool-fits-in 
without understanding the fundamental concepts is as good as expecting a 
medical student to learn about how to use xyz branded medicines to cure a 
disease and using xyz branded equipments to perform surgery 
_without_ understanding the basics of human anatomy and the fundamental 
concepts relevant to the cause and effect of a disease. You really would 
never hire such a doctor, would you ?

Students in general... (a large part of them) are pretty much clueless 
about the industry. They are mostly driven by hype created by the 
_commercial_ companies with lack of focus on fundamental concepts. It is 
similar to school kids drinking coke/pepsi/whatever-unnatural-drink to 
feel hep about, while neglecting home-made fruit juice and/or milk which is 
essential for health.

For instance, when you teach a student how to program using the 
C/Pascal/Python language, and leave it upto the student to decide on the 
compiler/IDE/tools to choose from, you are giving him freedom of choice. But 
if you teach him Visual C++ or Borland Delphi or Activestate Python, you are 
locking him to use a specific tool - which is a bad idea. 

Same goes for Databases too. I have come across a lot of fresh engineers 
who are skilled /only/ to use Oracle or MS SQL Server and have no idea about 
any other databases, nor do they even know the fundamental Database concepts 
like normalization. Reason ? The colleges perhaps never stressed much on SQL 
or RDBMS concepts... but rather on things like "how to use Oracle" or "how 
to use MS SQL Server". I myself was taught on how to use DBase 
III+ and Foxpro during my BCA graduation. I wonder how many companies today 
use them.  

This also explains the fact why programmers of the last century were a lot 
more creative and talented than those we find today (largely i.e.). Reason ? 
CS students of the 80s weren't locked to a commercial _product_. Thus a C 
programmer was a C programmer and not a VC++ programmer or a Borland C++ 
programmer. A database guru of the 80s knew much beyond Oracle/Sybase/MS SQL 
Server because his fundamental knowledge were strong.

Some of us (very few infact) tend to look beyond the options we were

If you hated Java and liked Python, it was simply because your college 
syllabus would've stressed more into "How to use Java" rather than teaching 
you "How to program". My point about software lock-in still holds true 
;-)

I totally agree with you in this regard. This is a clear case where your 
freedom of choice has been revoked. But atleast you have the choice to use 
any C compiler to do a compiler lab... what if your college demanded that 
you must do compiler lab only using Borland C++ ? Worse right ? There 
are instances though, where you *must* be taught on "how to use the right 
tool for the right job". But what tools you would use to effectively 
accomplish a task should be left upto you.

Redhat "sells" Linux. They never created Linux. Anyone who learns Redhat 
well enough still have his choice to switch to any other forms of Linux (or 
UNIX in general). They *cannot* lock students to use "their" technology 
because of the very nature of Free Software. Can you say the same with 
any Microsoft product ? In my personal experience of training many people, I 
have realized that it is easy to teach Linux to an absolute newbie than 
migrate an Microsoft tools-pampered professional to the Linux platform.  

Linux is Community driven... written from scratch by a community (though a 
lot of commercial giants have pitched in to help the community development 
today). When I install Linux on my machine, I own the software, very 
much like the way I own my car - which gives me more freedom to do whatever 
I like with it and to use it however I wish. Can you say the same about 
Microsoft product ?

If Microsoft puts MS-Office, MS SQL Server, .NET, VB or any other products 
of their own into the curriculum... they already have *exclusive* control 
over the future software professionals and companies. If they must 
contribute their resources as an ethical company, ideally they should just 
donate funds to the schools/colleges and expect the educational authorities 
to decide the syllabus on their own.

If Anna Univ. hasn't stopped teaching non-microsoft products and tools, it 
is because they are conscious about their decisions and well aware about 
the tactics of a _commercial_ entity. The same cannot be expected from other 
schools and colleges. End of the day, the students turn victims due to  
 fallacies of uninformed/blinded high authorities.

we can always specify the nearby places if we want.
For ex: My residence is in Virugambakkam and the nearby places are 
vadapalani, koyembedu, saligramam.

And remember :

* please use bullets for the various distros you have

I have edited the current list and i think it is neat.

We (AU) do have an elective on .NET/C# (as per the request of M$ and
in return some collboration work... ) added last year I think.  Nobody
in our class (7th sem) took the elective, probably I guess it will be
taken for 8th sem -- whatever the elective may, it is sure to be taken
only if the course is handled by any lenient teacher who always asks
straightforward questions from class-notes/books.  Worse that
important course like graph theory was finally offered only in 7th
semester as definite elective (after 3 rejects by the students).

The system needs to change, otherwise education in India is judged to
be nonsensical.

Easier to upload a map of Madras instead.  Or link to an online map of 
madras on some website like chennaionline.com

If somebody lives in Adyar and doesnt know Thiruvanmiyur / Besant Nagar 
are closer to him than Mylapore, they can use the map ... and the wiki 
would remain a bit less cluttered.

But don't list your name under each heading corresponding to nearby
area.  I already pointed out the problem and visitors can easily
browse through locations (that are nearest to them) themselves.

A mathetical blow ...

* f(x) is areas nearest to X (say within d kilometers)
  f(x) will look like a circle

f(x1) and f(x2) may overlap [ Let the intersection be f(x1) # f(x2) ] 
  (v1 in x1, v2 in x2)

Now the visitor resides in f(x1) # f(x2).  He certainly don't know
where v1 or v2 resides.  How would he decide whether he should call up
v1 or v2.  v1 may be nearest to him/her, but the proposed method of
listing doesn't reflect this well.  Instead if each volunteer is
listed under single location, he (visitor) could easily find out the
nearest guy.  All he/she has to do his expand the circle around his
area and keep looking for volunteers at the locations enclosed!

(Sorry for Company disclaimer)

Using so called industry tools (proprietary) to educate (Help) student is like

using XXX hardcore porn videos to give sex education to students.

"Srirams" and "salespeoples" of the world might argue that its the same and even better as its the real thing that people do in the real world.

Sorry pal, I wouldn't want my kids or anybodies kids to be put through such an education.

There is no easy path for good foundation (education) and learning. Lets not be blinded to the true motive of greedy corporations.

Please don't (this for students in this list) reduce yourself to be skilled in TOOLs but instead learn for learning sake. If you have good basic skills and fundamentals picking any supposedly "Industry Tool" is just matter of couple of weeks.

You are close, actually I was thinking about a seperate application
with imagemaps in the Chennai map, highlighting areas where CDs are
available with different colors for different distros ...oh my.. lot

If you are using Redhat/Fedora/Mandrake Linux, make your script/program 
executable, and copy the same into /etc/init.d/ directory. After this, you 
might either wish to manually create a symbolic link to this script to 
/etc/rc0.d/ and /etc/rc6.d/ directory (or /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/ and 
/etc/rc.d/rc6.d/ directory) or use your favourite service management tool 
(like ntsysv, redhat-config-services or other tools) and enable 
your script to be executed on runlevel 0 (system halt) and runlevel 6 
(system reboot). 

If you do create a symbolic link to your script manually, make sure that the 
name of your script starts as S67 or something like that (S stands for 
"Start" and 67 is the numeric order that determines when the script must be 
run). 

If you are using Slackware or similar distro, you might simply edit 
/etc/rc.d/rc.6 and add a line to execute your script, before the  
block that umounts your filesystems. 

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

Huh? Microsoft and porn? This is the silliest comparison I have seen. For
your information, proprietary tools are used by a majority of the world's
computing population today, whatever be the merits of open source. Our
syllabi are full of proprietary tools - we use them in our labs, everywhere.
Do you want people to stop studying about the Intel 8086 processor now since
its from Intel?

Like Prabhu said in his reply, every company wants to make money.Period. If
they don't , then they betray the trust of their shareholders and other
people involved with the company. How did wanting to make money ever become
evil (as people don't want any corporations involved with academics at all)?

Quoting from that article

"..Until you've done Windows programming for a while, you may think that
Win32 is just a library, like any other library, you'll read the book and
learn it and call it when you need to. You might think that basic
programming, say, your expert C++ skills, are the 90% and all the APIs are
the 10% fluff you can catch up on in a few weeks. To these people I humbly
suggest: times have changed. The ratio has reversed.
.."

Though the article is mostly about Windows(he does talk about free software
too) , the argument could be easily extended to any programming platform out
there ..be it Gnome or XUL or whatever.

It is good to have many maintainers in an area. Say
you have two people enlisted in an area. If one is not
in station or is held up with work and is not able to
do the needful, you can always contact the other
person.

If you find two next-door neighbours wanting to be
maintainers, it isn't fair to ask one of them to be a
maintainer for a far distant area where he doesn't
belong! 

Everyone should have the freedom to contribute and
share the CDs rather than bureaucratically assign
people to areas.

</quote>

He doesn't have to know. He can contact (e-mail/phone)
whomever he wants and proceed with what is available.
We shouldn't impose a restriction on the guy who needs
the CD. He should have the flexibility to contact any
of the maintainers.

People believe that it was this article which eventually led to Avalon and
Indigo being released for WinXP. There was huge responses over the blogs for
this. 

Microsoft has a stronger commitment to backwards compatibility (just read
Raymond Chen's blog) than most other companies out there. The Longhorn demo
at the PDC showed Visicalc running on Longhorn

You misunderstood.  I said, if suppose if A resides in Royapuram and B
resides in Washermenpet, A must be listed under Royapuram but NOT also
on Washermenpet.  The same goes for B.  Suppose if C also resides in
Washermetpet, under 'Washermenpet' we have 2 entries - B, C. but not A
just because that A is nearby it. Hope you understand.

> Everyone should have the freedom to contribute and
> share the CDs rather than bureaucratically assign

Each one is assigned to his own location, let him/her be listed under the same.

To illustrate the confusion, look at 'Chennai' and 'Pending' section in 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sridharinfinity/ILUGC

Now suppose under location X, A and B are listed according to your
recommendation.  A is listed because he resides in X.  B is listed
because X is nearby his area.  Now a person in X wants some CDs to be
written.  Sure, he can approach A or B for that.  It is just *or*.  I
can make some decisions like to contact the *most* nearby person.  But
he is not sure.  In my suggestion, B is not listed under X at all.  B
is listed under say Y.  Thus this would avoid some confusion and that
person can simply call A.

The catch is some people may not be aware of the nearby locations. 
May be we can link to the Chennai map.  Otherwise, it will become
tedious for us to maintain the list.

If A is willing to help Washermenpet residents, why
should we say no?

You can specify A too if he is willing to travel to
the area and provide the service AND if B and C don't
have all the CDs or they are not in station.

Let the person contact and find out. We needn't make
any assumptions, right?

The term "nearby" refers to where the maintainer can
lend his CDs to. If A wants to service locations P
(residence) and Y (work place) and if P and Y are far
away places, you are suggesting that A be assigned to
P only. But, when A is willing to service Y, why
should we say no?

We are not saying NO.  We are letting the person (who is searching for
CDs) to find out A (in case if B is not possible) is nearby instead of
listing A on all locations nearby.
The very first page of the wiki page says
... If you like to grab CDs, click on the location that is nearest to
your residence. ...

So if the person clicked on X say and if the person under X is out of
station, he can go and choose some other locatio nearby.  We need not
list A under all locations that are nearby to X.

Actually the term "nearby" refers to the places nearby his residence. 
For eg. washermenpet is nearby royapuram.  So list your name *only*
under royapuram so that washermenpet users could find using simple
inference.

And if A uses to visit both P and Y (as in this case), A *can* be
listed under both P and Y, which is actuallly clearly stated in the
policy.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sridharinfinity/ILUGC#CDs_for_Grab

It reads ....
... Add your name, email and phone number under single location
(except in the case of multiple residences). (Do not list under nearby
locations) ...

Here *multiple residences* refer to P and Y which are not necessarily
nearby, but don't just list under nearby locations which are
considered to be redundant.

Btw, if the wiki page is confusing to understand just rephrase it. :)

(Sorry for Company disclaimer)

Using so called industry tools (proprietary) to educate (Help) student is like

using XXX hardcore porn videos to give sex education to students.

"Srirams" and "salespeoples" of the world might argue that its the same and even better as its the real thing that people do in the real world.

Sorry pal, I wouldn't want my kids or anybodies kids to be put through such an education.

There is no easy path for good foundation (education) and learning. Lets not be blinded to the true motive of greedy corporations.

Please don't (this for students in this list) reduce yourself to be skilled in TOOLs but instead learn for learning sake. If you have good basic skills and fundamentals picking any supposedly "Industry Tool" is just matter of couple of weeks.

Wrong! expecting a CS student to learn .NET/Java/Unix/whatever-tool-fits-in
without understanding the fundamental concepts is as good as expecting a
medical student to learn about how to use xyz branded medicines to cure a
disease and using xyz branded equipments to perform surgery
_without_ understanding the basics of human anatomy and the fundamental
concepts relevant to the cause and effect of a disease. You really would
never hire such a doctor, would you ?

Students in general... (a large part of them) are pretty much clueless
about the industry. They are mostly driven by hype created by the
_commercial_ companies with lack of focus on fundamental concepts. It is
similar to school kids drinking coke/pepsi/whatever-unnatural-drink to
feel hep about, while neglecting home-made fruit juice and/or milk which is
essential for health.

> products - doesn't mean I can't think for my own self.

For instance, when you teach a student how to program using the
C/Pascal/Python language, and leave it upto the student to decide on the
compiler/IDE/tools to choose from, you are giving him freedom of choice. But
if you teach him Visual C++ or Borland Delphi or Activestate Python, you are
locking him to use a specific tool - which is a bad idea.

Same goes for Databases too. I have come across a lot of fresh engineers
who are skilled /only/ to use Oracle or MS SQL Server and have no idea about
any other databases, nor do they even know the fundamental Database concepts
like normalization. Reason ? The colleges perhaps never stressed much on SQL
or RDBMS concepts... but rather on things like "how to use Oracle" or "how
to use MS SQL Server". I myself was taught on how to use DBase
III+ and Foxpro during my BCA graduation. I wonder how many companies today
use them. 

This also explains the fact why programmers of the last century were a lot
more creative and talented than those we find today (largely i.e.). Reason ?
CS students of the 80s weren't locked to a commercial _product_. Thus a C
programmer was a C programmer and not a VC++ programmer or a Borland C++
programmer. A database guru of the 80s knew much beyond Oracle/Sybase/MS SQL
Server because his fundamental knowledge were strong.

Some of us (very few infact) tend to look beyond the options we were
provided... unfortunately a lot others do not have the apt to do so.
If you hated Java and liked Python, it was simply because your college
syllabus would've stressed more into "How to use Java" rather than teaching
you "How to program". My point about software lock-in still holds true
;-)

I totally agree with you in this regard. This is a clear case where your
freedom of choice has been revoked. But atleast you have the choice to use
any C compiler to do a compiler lab... what if your college demanded that
you must do compiler lab only using Borland C++ ? Worse right ? There
are instances though, where you *must* be taught on "how to use the right
tool for the right job". But what tools you would use to effectively
accomplish a task should be left upto you.

Redhat "sells" Linux. They never created Linux. Anyone who learns Redhat
well enough still have his choice to switch to any other forms of Linux (or
UNIX in general). They *cannot* lock students to use "their" technology
because of the very nature of Free Software. Can you say the same with
any Microsoft product ? In my personal experience of training many people, I
have realized that it is easy to teach Linux to an absolute newbie than
migrate an Microsoft tools-pampered professional to the Linux platform. 

Linux is Community driven... written from scratch by a community (though a
lot of commercial giants have pitched in to help the community development
today). When I install Linux on my machine, I own the software, very
much like the way I own my car - which gives me more freedom to do whatever
I like with it and to use it however I wish. Can you say the same about
Microsoft product ?

If Microsoft puts MS-Office, MS SQL Server, .NET, VB or any other products
of their own into the curriculum... they already have *exclusive* control
over the future software professionals and companies. If they must
contribute their resources as an ethical company, ideally they should just
donate funds to the schools/colleges and expect the educational authorities
to decide the syllabus on their own.

If Anna Univ. hasn't stopped teaching non-microsoft products and tools, it
is because they are conscious about their decisions and well aware about
the tactics of a _commercial_ entity. The same cannot be expected from other
schools and colleges. End of the day, the students turn victims due to 
 fallacies of uninformed/blinded high authorities.

I'm not sure this is a fair assessment.  There is one sweeping
generalization made in this article, based on the assumption that we
are still programming in the 1990's.  

Eric Raymond's opinions sometimes receive mixed feelings from the OSS
community.  In some ways just like RMS is both worshipped and disliked
by different folks.  However, everyone respects both of these for what
they have done.  

Surely Joel is aware that there are hundreds of folks out there who
are striving to make a difference via KDE/GNOME.  If anyone today
looks at a recent desktop linux box and claims that the GUI is a silly
strap on that does not work, he surely needs to have his head
examined.  Sure there are cultural differences but it seems to me that
these are slowly disappearing.  It appears that all OS's are tending
towards precisely the same thing.  If the unix world is moving towards
the generation of sophisticated GUIs, integrated management of a
zillion little files etc., the windows world is waking up to CLI
interfaces, and security, true multiple user setups etc.

Each environment seems to be covering its ugly sides.  It just so
happens that the majority of the world consists of non-programmers
that people claim the superiority of one approach over another.

As to why unix users are perceived to be more self-righteous, I'll
simply say that its unclear how Joel gets enough numbers to make a
truly meaningfull assessment of this.  It seems to me a rather biased
judgement.  It is also true that many people who choose to remain
idealistic, believe in their ideals very strongly.  That is their core
being.  Its like arguing religion.  So unlike Windows programmers who
are using windows because they have to make some money, the unix guys
(whom Joel seems to refer to) code for very idealistic reasons.  It
stands to reason that the idealist is likely to be more vociferous and
self-righteous.

While largely the article was nice, the author perhaps has no idea about  
UNIX-like operating systems in use today. For the rest part, the article 
sounds somewhat biased. The following quote was from his article:

+------
|The cultural schism is so sharp that Unix has never really made any inroads 
|on the desktop.
+------
Perhaps the author hasn't heard much about Mac OSX, nor would he 
have chanced upon Xandros, Ubuntu, SuSE or Mandrake desktops that are in 
existence today. The days when UNIX-like operating systems were all 
command-line and user-unfriendly have long gone. 

Linux especially has become more user-friendly that even my 7 year old 
nephew has been using them for the last 1 year to play games, watch 
his favourite cartoons and play music. All I had to teach him was about how 
to use the mouse and to use windows/buttons/folder/menus and some basic 
apps. And he's not alone... in fact a lot of his friends (aged 
almost the same) have been using Linux at their home. If the kids could 
use Linux, there's no reason how other newbies would face problems.

Its not whether "Linux is ready for desktop" anymore... Linux is ON many  
desktops already ;-) 

Same holds true for other UNIX-like operating systems such as Mac OSX or 
even FreeBSD.

Just link to a plain, simple map. No need to automatically calculate

Actually the general statement that UNIX-like OS's made zero inroads
into user-friendly GUI's is so wrong.  Any SGI user would tell you so.
In fact the kind of integration and sophistication that IRIX had way
back then is something you'd be hard pressed to find today.  Agreed,
SGI boxen of yesteryear can't be called "PCs" (you could call them
"workstations") but the general blanket statement on UNIX is
completely wrong.  It seems to me that Joel equates UNIX to the freely
available UNIX versions.

LOL... You have a kindred soul in me... only, I flunked the math paper

Very true! Infact, I was very much impressed with Sun's Openlook (later CDE) 
 after having a hard time, though for a short while on Microsoft Windows 3.1 
 back in the '90s. Haven't chanced upon SGI IRIX as yet, but from 
what I heard from a couple of SGI users, they were impressive and perfectly 
well designed for their needs.  

At times I still work on twm and appreciate its simplicity of UI design (an 
efficient environment without double-click!) and there's GNUstep, yet 
another well designed and usable environment. We have far too many choices 
on Unix today to cater to different classes of people (with different 
ideologies and personal tastes of course) - and the best part... they wont 
lock us down ;-)

Joel was probably referring to popular mindshare. He correctly mentions
Apple in the article as the the first GUI-based system to become widely
popular.As for Gnome and KDE and others, they may be great pieces of work
growing very fast, but I doubt whether their numbers are comparable to
Apple's numbers, let alone Microsoft's. Don't believe me? Check out the
archives of Google Zeitgeist.Linux maybe an excellent product - and though a
lot of people have heard of it, not many from the non-techie population are
using it full-time.

Actually, I don't know why Ubuntu was spoken about.Though I'm sure its an
excellent distro, excellence doesn't automatically mean popular
mindshare('popular' as in outside the geek community) . From my personal
experience,the non-techie people who know of Linux mostly know of Redhat and
to a small extent Suse and Mandrake. 

Btw, Joel isn't the only one to criticize OSS usability. Check out Eric S
Raymond's article on how he struggled with CUPS.
Also, see
http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/25/1416208&tid=189&tid=1
56 and the forums of www.ok-cancel.com where this was a hotly contested
topic once.

Usability isn't the only issue here. If Linux *has* made in-roads into
desktop systems, why is it that 30 out of 41 people who responded to the
recent survey on this list dual-boot with Windows? I'm sure they have their
reasons - perhaps the lack of a lot of popular software or games -or maybe
they have some hardware issues - or perhaps they have some documents which

Whatever be their reasons,  the point to note is that those reasons do

It is necessary for maintaining "Requested Area List". Say if for a

the list and any volunteer after going through the list can come
forward.

The policy is create a area section only if the volunteer comes to add
his contact.  Otherwise the user could always judge the nearest are
(in the TOC) and naviage to it. Simple.

Area section must have at-least one volunteer.

Selectively quoting my email is rather unfair.  The unfortunate

having a compelling desktop solution.  If someone does say so he is

Largely bogus argument.  The problem really is that there are too many
proprietary pieces of software that are simply not
cross-platform/cross-OS.  The fact remains that Windows does have the
largest mindshare.  It does not mean that Windows is the best OS in
town or that Linux is unusable and has no decent GUI environment.  If
you want choice, OSS is way better.

Also notice how you started with CS students and are now talking about
non-tech masses...

Policy is what we make of :).

People really shouldn't be associated with physical
boundaries. There are some residences which really
don't fit into any area. I stay in Cathedral Road, and
my address doesn't go with any area (neither
Gopalapuram nor Poes Garden). It is like asking which
area does Mount road belong to? 

Anyways,

Yes, but policy is also used to prevent ambiguousness in information.

I am always confused seeing your mails ;).  

If so just list under "Cathedral Road (near Gopalapuram)".  Users
could easily find it if they know there are staying *near* gopalpuram.

My point listing under multiple nearby areas will cause confusion and
redundancy of information copied.  Or perhaps, you could list the
nearby areas along with your name, email, phone.

2. Have a CDs4Grab which will just point to the volunteer pages. Links

Sorry, perhaps the argument moved out of context. I was clearly speaking 
about whats good and whats ethical, not whats popular. Just because Windows 
is the world's most popular OS today, doesn't make it qualify it to be good 
does it ?

Wrong, a lot of non-techie Linux users know about Ubuntu too. I know a lot 
of them who do, infact.

Eric S Raymond might be a great personality... but even great people make 
great blunders at times, and he seemed to have proved it with that article. 
Managing CUPS _is_ as easy as navigating a decent website. Dont trust me ? 
ask any _sensible_ Linux user on how he sets up a printer. If he struggled 
with it, its his fault. The very basic ethic of Open Source - stop whining 
and start learning/helping-out/promoting. Thats how communities grow. You 
dont like something the way it is ? make it better... you cant do it ? help 
some to do it for you and give it back to the community.

You aren't locked into someone's way of thought... you still have the 
freedom of choice and that is what Linux assures you! I would have more than 
a 100 different issues personally on Windows UI itself... but do I have a 
choice there ?

This is what we term as software/technology/vendor lock-in! The users who 
use Windows today had no choice back in the 80s and the early 90s. They 
were forced to learn Windows/other commercial tools or perish. Even if 
choices did exist (on a PC), they were mostly purged by your "friendly 
neighbourhood" Microsoft. This explains Microsoft dominance, monopoly and 
control over the user's mind-share. Today, a lot of sensible and 
well-informed users do keep Linux as an option and use them sometimes in a 
dual-boot environment. The drift is happening though. 

Regarding hardware issues, if you still live down the dark, Linux already 
supports more hardware devices (and painlessly detects them) and _hardware 
platforms_ than Windows does, _by default_. Infact, most hardware vendors 
these days have consciously taken steps to support Linux anyways. And if you 
still think Linux has no games like on Windows, you are seriously mistaken. 
All the latest and greatest games run on Linux (yes, Doom3 included). 

Yes, people stick to windows simply because they have been locked-in by 
 proprietary vendors. The tide is slowly shifting, as a lot of well-informed 
users have begun to realize the truth behind the business motives 
of Microsoft and its allies (and other _commercial_ software vendors even). 
This explains the _growing_ Linux popularity. It is slow, but stable and is 
surely determined to make a positive impact on the way we percieve software 
 phasing out the whole generation of "Commercial" software on mainstream 
computing environments in the coming years. 

The day is not far, when users purge Windows altogether to move onto  
Linux permanently. This might take time, but will surely happen. 


> Whatever be their reasons,  the point to note is that those reasons do

As I already told you, we belong to the generation who have been locked-in 
(and have been forced victims) to Microsoft. A very few of us live in an 
environment free of commercial software. I have a  home-cum-lab with 11 
computers - none of which have any commercial software. All machines share a 
combination of various Linux distributions, FreeBSD and Plan 9. My students 
use them without any difficulty. I know of a lot of internet parlours and 
training institutes in bangalore where there are no such things called 
Microsoft Windows on their machines (thanks to NASSCOM and their 
anti software-piracy drive). 

With a lot of people like me not being interested in voicing our views on 
some random survey lists, the recent survey (whatever that is) can be as 
bogus as Microsoft's "Get the Facts right" thing. 


Anyways, I see where this whole discussion is heading to... and it seems 
like a DeJaVu for me again. I guess I'd stop now and move on to play 
around with brighter things in life (its been a while listening to loud 
music) ;-)

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

CDE  is based on Motif and Openlook is based on another X toolkit,
whose name I can't remember.  I could never stand CDE -  apart from
Motif's heavy bevelled looks, it was a clear case of design by
committee by the unix vendors.

I am a big Joel fan - but have learnt to take his words with a pinch
of salt.  At one time he had some uncomplimentary  things about web
based software, but is singing a very different tune of late. 
Apparently his  own desktop product for authoring web pages  is a
flop, but the web based bug tracking software - another product that
his company makes and which runs on Linux, supports PHP etc, has
turned into the main revenue earner .

hi all, 
       In gmail SMTP works but when you add attachment( a word file of
30k)to your message, it stays at 85% and it is not able to send the
message. I have tried in evolution as well in the mozilla. I think still
pop feature is not completed done with.

Cheers

That is because we have clueless (or selfish) educational ministers
and University authorities. My wife is doing PGDCA from Annamalai
University. She has to learn VB, MSOffice, Oracle ... in 1st Sem.

Don't know what all things I have to install on my machine, before
she finish her course :-(

Luckily we have a great President. See this mail from APJ Abdul Kalam.

Take a stick and whack my head for writing emails while over-dosed on
caffeine. I was thinking IMAP and reading/writing SMTP.

Sorry for any ensuing confusion.

  Linux on the desktop has passed Apple a while ago - but the numbers
are obviously split over several GUIs.

  Because it costs nothing to retain dual-boot capability, and it still
retains the original functionality of the machine, if it becomes
necessary to recover it. For instance, I got a Toshiba notebook 3 years
ago bundled with Windows ME. Instead of nuking Windows ME, I just
re-partitioned it into a little partition of about 1G, and used the
remaining space for several distros of Linux.

  Occasionally, you need DOS/Windows functionality to upgrade the flash
BIOS or similar stuff.

  I manage without Windows perfectly well - but I'll retain a legacy
fallback mode if it costs me nothing. Simple risk-management.

 It's like getting a new car, and
being told that I can keep running my old car if I need to, without
taxes, registration, fuel, etc., at any time. I'll take that option
if I have the space to keep my old car, but that doesn't mean that
I'm going to pay money to buy another model of my old car. That's
the problem that M$ faces now. People aren't willing to pay a high
premium to upgrade. Any time the M$ marketroids come around, you
just have to say the magic phrase 'We're migrating to Linux', and
*boom*, the M$ upgrade licensing fees get discounted by 50%-90%.

The main goal is to get that discount to 100% or more - i.e. force
M$ to pay money to retain customers. That's already happening in
some sectors - XBox, Set-top boxes, Smartphones, etc. It will
spread to Servers and Desktops sooner or later - it's inevitable.

Depends on how you look at it - it's certainly not open source, as Sun 
is still resisting it - and the Java logo is copyright Sun. You'll get a 
freindly but stern warning about using 'Java' in your product/project 
literature if you don't take explicit permission from Sun Microsystems.

But, it's 'open platform' in every other sense of the word - you don't 
have to pay any licence fees to Sun for using jdk, apache site is 
choc-a-bloc with open-source java projects. In short, you can't make any 
changes to the JDK, but you're free to do whatever else you want. Also, 
now, you can influence what gets into java language by participating in 
the 'Java Community Process'. All the future J2EE standards (like EJB 
3.0) are being developed this way.

Just google around, you'll find a lot more info on Java's version of 
being open :)

Agreed 100%

And considering that Dileep's email made Kalam get the site shifted to 
Linux and Apache + PHP (+ Java) instead of running on IIS, that's a good 
enough start without wasting time on license wars.

Just let it be the way it is.  It is just fine, without confusing the 
issue with all sorts of useless formulae.

Alternatively, someone reorganize the page according to Raman's 
suggestion .. it will look a bit neater.

The site uses JSP. Eg.

Java is *NOT* Open Source.   Better alternatives are php,

How do you say Apache and PHP?  I see only JSP/HTML pages there. 
Perhaps they are using tomcat.

looks of PHP there.

Load that page in lynx (presidentofindia.nic.in) and press = there to 
see server information.

Part of it is Apache/2.0.42 (Unix) PHP/4.2.3 mod_jk/1.2.0

For our server (cs.annauniv.edu), mod_python is also listed in
netcraft. Does that mean that we are using it? actually, NO.  It was
installed long time back.

Hi,

Dear friends,
I am sick and tired of my valuable bandwidth being
wasted by this
Sriram Krishnan.
Whenever anybody talks about Microsoft he pops up and
starts a
flame war.
People with nothing better to do immediately respond
falling into the
trap,without realising that we cannot argue with him
since
he has been planted to change us.
I am sorry to see that even Prabu has fallen into his
flame war trap.
This is supposed to be lugc mailing list, but anybody
going through the
threads
started by this gentleman will wonder where the hell
has he entered.
On behalf of the silent majority I request Mr.Prabu to
kick this gentleman
off the list.
Considering his fanaticism, he is bound to enter in
another 'avatar',
so we have to be vigilant.

I have a better solution for you - stop the person from talking about
Microsoft as it is off-topic to a list supposed to be dedicated to Linux
users and helping Linux newbies. If you want to flame Microsoft, a better
solution would be a list like fsf-friends or one of the advocacy lists which
is meant for that kind of thing.

That is just not my style.  Sorry, I see no reason to kick anyone off
this list.  If anything we should discourage OT posts.  Besides,
despite Sriram's defence of MS, we did get to explicitly see why many
of us dislike/distrust MS and why OSS is a compelling alternative.
Surely something was learnt.

Of course, in all such matters you retain the right to exercise your
delete key.

not, try sylpheed.

I have a much better better better solution for all.  Sriram, stop
from popping up when somebody talks about Micros~t.  Why do you want
to waste your time, which can be otherwise used wisely.

Look, if you are that irritated with him, just delete or filter out his 
emails.  Or answer him with logic instead of with abuse - and take care 
not to get into long debates on ideology rather than technical issues.. 
both sides end up looking silly that way.

But right now he isn't doing anything wrong that should warrant booting 
him from the list.  This is not the sort of list where random people get 
kicked off or moderated out, anyway .. don't let us make it that way

Hi TDP,, I think you dont have any right to put Suresh Ramasubramanian
 out . it is his nature of popping up as u told. you cannot tell like
this. If u r not interested in any of the conversation , Please Ignore
the mail. This is the group where everyone wants to share their
precious linux knowledge to the newbie and experts. Not just a group
where people come for time pass. So if u dont like it just ignore the
mail.

Everyone has rights to oppose anything or agree anything. its their rights. 

Hi guys, I kindly request u to stop this conversation and just go
ahead with linux hacking and can come out with different development
and share with the group. Please..

pine seems to b non-GPL s/w. I recently read mutt manual which says
POP, IMAP access as optional settings, so does that mean it was not
meant to b a e-mail client for mails from internet instead from LAN
net. like the old unix system, where there was a central server and
all mails were within network connected to server. Plz correct me if i
am wrong.

I know thunderbird is lite on windows, but is it true on linux. Your

Try cone (http://www.courier-mta.org/cone/index.html). It is powerful, user 
friendly (similar to pine, but much better/intuitive interface), and 
standalone (does not depend on external agents like sendmail, fetchmail and 
so on). 

You might also want to try elmo (http://elmo.sourceforge.net/). It provides 
a more pretty UI - (on large console, though) and is equally easy to use (as 
cone).

It might have sounded like a flame war to you, but to a lot of us, its 
merely a learning experience. Personally, I have nothing against Sriram or 
his ideologies.. Like they say - "Different folks, different strokes", but 
at times it is also important for us to know about ourselves and about our 
beliefs and ideologies not from those who appreciate us or our beliefs - but 
by our critics. I (and most of us here) have something against either 
Microsoft or _commercial_ software in general... but by our critics we get 
to learn how we are better off and what we stick lack. 

By most of these discussions, we get to learn how to defend in what we 
believe from those who dont.

That would be too harsh a treatment... he is like you and me, after all, 
just that he's trying to defend his ideologies.

I dont know about Mozilla Thunderbird (I guess its heavy weight), but 
sylpheed is very light (atleast the version that comes with Debian Woody). 
It works peacefully on an old Pentium with 32 MB RAM.

No problem, speak your mind freely. But, I should point out something 
about the *ILUGC* mailing list as well:

"The policy of this list is simple and uncomplicated. Discussion is 
restricted to matters that directly concern ilugc and its activities. 
While technical queries are not /actively/ discouraged, this list itself 
is /not/ a forum for help regarding generic problems involving 
GNU/Linux. You'll be better served in this issue by the many GNU/Linux 
mailing lists hosted by maito:majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu?Subject=lists 
<mailto:majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu?Subject=lists>, and the Linux-india 
<http://lists.Linux-india.org/> list. As regards posts, flames, trolls, 
and HTML mail are deprecated."  - quoted from 
http://www.chennailug.org/join.php

Probably the policy of the list has changed a bit now, and could be 
updated to reflect the reality, affirming that this is now mainly a 
technical list, and that ilugc activities are also discussed whenever 
appropriate.

The  "mutt-way"  of  doing  it  is  to have  a  mail  fetching  thingy
(fetchmail), (an optional) mail filtering thingy (procmail) and a mail
client (mutt).

procmail   is  good   at   mail   filtering   in   much  better   ways
than, say, evolution/thunderbird.

Even if  you wanted to  switch to something  other than mutt,  you can
continue to do so without  having to "import" (or worse, recreate) all
your filters again in your new client.

Sorry, I wrongly quoted it.  I was talking about the resource
hungriness of thunderbird.  Never use thunderbird on a machine with
128MB RAM.  Sylpeed is definitely lightweight (both gtk1 and gtk2)

Say *foo* requires RHL then he can see click on the link on the CD4Grabs

Yes this would prevent the ambigous entries as a user will be having his 
contact info only in his user page

But these can be implemented only if the wiki is setup soon and there 
are enough sysops.

Can i use sendmail instead of fetchmail. Since its already running in
my system. AFAIK sendmail is also used to fetch mail. Or is there any
benefit of using fetchmail.

thank you,

Hi,

I have updated the page, one person per area. If I
have left out anyone by mistake, please feel free to
add your entry or inform Sridhar or me. Ashwin Kesavan
Iyengar, kindly send an update with the list of
distros and CDs you have.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sridharinfinity/ILUGC

The suggestions are good. One of the key features that
I would look for is the search option, to be able to
search for distros. The map idea is really cool. As a
user moves across the different areas, maybe, we
should display the maintainer, the distros he/she has
etc.

I have obtained FC3 CDs from Sriram Krishnan. Thanks.
Vinayak, do let me know when you want them.

Are we by any chance having a demo/festival in
December? Just wondering :o

Take care,

Regards,

K Shakthi

So?  There is a lot of software bundled with linux that has other licenses

Precompiled mutt builds (rpm / deb / freebsd packages etc) come with pop3 /
imap / ssl etc all enabled. But you'd be better off using a mail fetcher
program like fetchmail to get your mail to your mailbox.

http://www.hserus.net/dlhowto.html should help you.

sendmail is used to send outgoing email, it is a mailserver

fetchmail is a pop3 and imap client

anyway as I said, read http://www.hserus.net/dlhowto.html .. it'll answer
some of your questions, or failing that, will give you a working mutt +
sendmail + fetchmail setup if you just copy and paste.

Pundits predict malware may target Linux
========================================
When a parasite is faced with a change in environment,
it too will change or perish. While Microsoft Windows
is the platform of choice for viruses and other malware,
parasite writers are starting to smell fresh blood
elsewhere. Numerous metrics indicate that Linux is
charging full speed into the desktop market. According
to an IDC report, businesses and government departments
will spend $98 million on services to support their Linux
systems in 2004. By 2008, the figure is predicted to
increase to $228 million...

Fedora Core 3 Tries Out Latest SELinux

The previous week saw the latest release of Red Hat's
community-based Linux distribution, Fedora Core 3.
While not a business release and indeed Fedora has no
official support from Red Hat Inc. Fedora serves as a
proving ground for ideas that may eventually make
their way into RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux). Perhaps
the most important of these new technologies being given
a trial run in Fedora is the latest version of SELinux
(Security-Enhanced Linux).

SELinux was first developed by the U.S. government's
National Security Agency. While not intended to be a
complete security solution for Linux, SELinux does strive

"Fedora Core 3 is what would have been Red Hat 10 or
10.1 had Red Hat not abandoned the boxed, retail-shelf
market and therefore is its closest offering to SUSE 9.2
Pro. Novell/SUSE have recently announced their corporate
desktop which appears to be in direct competition with
RedHat WS and Sun's JDS. As such, with different offerings
from both parties, I wanted to make sure I was comparing
apples to apples and comparing Fedora Core 3 to SUSE 9.2
Pro seems to be the best match up..."

Red Hat opens China office
==========================
Red Hat Inc. is opening this week its first office in China,
as part of its effort to tap demand for low-cost software in
developing markets. Staff in Red Hat's Beijing office plan to
work closely with other vendors in the region, including IBM
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel Corp., Dell Inc. and Oracle
Corp. Establishing local support for the company's university
training program on open source development and Linux usage is
one of Red Hat Beijing's first initiatives. The company said
it is working with work with Tsinghua University and Nanjing
University.

A company spokeswoman declined to say how many employees Red
Hat has in China. Beijing marks the 28th worldwide office
opened by the Raleigh, North Carolina, based open-source
software maker. Red Hat's other facilities in the Asia-Pacific
region include offices in Singapore, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong
and Malaysia.

Sun in Japan
============
Sun scored a major victory in Japan, as the Ministry of Economy,
Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Sun's Java Desktop System
has been selected through open competition as a key platform that
will be used in schools and other IT projects that Japan's
Information-technology Promotion Agency will manage.

In a statement, Takashi Kume, deputy director, Information Services
Industry Division, Commerce and Information Policy Bureau, Ministry
of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), said, "METI is promoting the
deployment of open source software to provide more choice of desktop
environments for user...

The AnandTech Linux XBOX PC Experiment
======================================
A few weeks ago, we started investigating the possibility of
putting Linux on an XBOX. We played with some ideas in our heads,
  a render farm, a cheap office computer or a distributed crypto
platform, just to start. The idea required a little bit of elbow
grease, a mod chip, Linux and a bunch of free time.

All XBOXes are locked into only booting the Microsoft BIOS. That
is, if you buy a new XBOX, it's basic IO does not let you do all
that much, except read DVDs, and XBOX games that have special
keys encoded into them. A mod chip is a computer chip with another
BIOS that physically overrides the Microsoft BIOS....

"Has Bill Gates Gone Nuts?"
===========================
"Which company is the biggest spender in the Linux world?
Is it IBM? Sun Microsystems? Red Hat? Novell? No, the biggest
spender in Linux, at least this year, is arguably the company
most threatened by its success. With this week's $536 million
settlement of a legal battle with Novell and April's $1.9
billion deal with Sun Microsystems, Microsoft has now agreed
to pay more than $2.4 billion to companies likely to spend the
money popularizing the arch-enemy of all things Microsoft.

Redmond is spending this huge sum of money voluntarily in an
effort to get its legal problems behind it. By doing so,
Microsoft is not only paying for its sins but also buying an
extra dose of punishment from two competitors. Given that
neutralizing the Linux threat is Job No. 1 for many at Microsoft
these days, a fair question after considering these huge
settlements with competitors is, 'Has Bill Gates gone nuts?'"

Sorry - should have probably phrased that better.What I meant is,if you want

Hi,

I just learnt about a quick way of searching the
ILUGC archives using FireFox.

1) Bookmark the following link
  (hopefully,not broken in to two lines)

http://search.gmane.org/search.php?group=gmane.org.user-groups.linux.i
lugc&query=%s


2) In your firefox Bookmarks menu, right-click on the
   entry you have just bookmarked, click properties and
   in the keyword field put "ilugc" (without quotes)
   and ok it.

Now when you type

ilugc FC3

in your Firefox Address bar and hit enter, you will
quickly get to the search results page. Hope this is
useful to you.

Kumaraguru

{Apologies for cross-posting}
 
Dear Chennai Linux User Group,
We welcome you to participate in the online discussion forum "Free and Open Source Software: Policy and Development Implications" (FOSS-PDI) at http://lists.apdip.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/foss-pdi

FOSS-PDI is a joint initiative of Bridges.org, (Cape Town, South Africa); Free and Open Source Software Foundation for Africa (FOSSFA), (Nairobi, Kenya); OneWorld South Asia (OWSA), (New Delhi, India); UNDP-APDIP International Open Source Network (IOSN), (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia); UNDP Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (APDIP/UNDP), (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia).

The multi-stakeholder partners of this e-discussion firmly believe that FOSS is in line with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): because it increases access to, ownership of, and control of knowledge and information through the collaborative development of newer technologies and communication opportunities. FOSS also provides an innovative Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) framework that can be applied in all areas of development theory and practice - advocacy for Free Medicine (e.g. generic HIV/AIDS drugs), Free Seeds (e.g. seed banks), Free Books (e.g. Open Access Movement), Freedom of Information Movement et. al. Therefore the issues being considered central to this debate are:

* Opportunities and drawbacks of FOSS for developing countries ? the roles of government, civil society, business in the process

* FOSS and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ? stretching the development dollar for scaling-up impact

* The global Intellectual Property Concern - Business monopoly of first world nations software giants VS third world collaborative
efforts.

* Enabling legal/regulatory/policy framework for country specific strategic evolution of FOSS.

* Open-source processes outside the software sector ? Free Medicine, Seed Bank, Open Access, Open Archiving etc.

* Comparison of proprietary software vis-?-vis FOSS in terms of technical merits ?reliability, stability, and vulnerabilities,
especially in the context of national security.

* FOSS versus Public Domain Software and Freeware ? the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of FOSS.

* Motivations for contributing to FOSS projects - What motivates FOSS developers to "donate" their time? In the context of developing countries, can these motivators be encouraged by government, civil society and private sector interventions?

We expect the deliberations of this on-ine discussion will contribute toward evolution of enabling policy framework on building/using FOSS for developmental interventions.

To post to this list, send your email to:

Hi 

  I am using Evolution 1.2.2 with RH 9. I want to configure Evolution with
my exchange server. 

I found ximian connector will do the job for me, unfortunately the link
given in store.ximian.com --> http://www.novell.com/products/connector/ is
not working. Another link ftp.ximian.com/pub/ximian-connector/redhat-9-i386
is also outdated.

Can any of you guide me to the correct URL ??Also share your exps using
Evolution to connect to Exchange server.

Include  a  dummy  image  which  is  generated  by  a  CGI/server-side

<img  src=http://mydomain.com/ljcounterimg.pl width=1  height=1>. Make
this ljcounterimg.pl log the hits.

Haven't tried practically. But I think you can go to:

http://www.livejournal.com/editpics.bml

...and  set your  pic to  a  'URL' which  could be  this log  tracking
URL. However, it might grow to become a pain to track 'which' page one
visited, etc.,.   For a  general purpose counter,  this should  do the
job.

the ads?  quite likely

look at the content on the site though - that's still quite useful, and 
installing one of those ad zapper programs like proxomitron helps make 
the banner ads etc go away

Message-ID: <41AB2DCF.7060804@eth.net>

Hi Friends !

Let me share my on spreading of linux.

Most of the institutes give training in windows only and people at large 
don't have a chance to know of other OSs leave alone mastering them. 
Also a major chunk of the PCs are sold by assemblers ( at least in the 
home PC business) who install windows only. Unless the buyers ask for 
linux they won't install it. So it is imperative that we have to spread 
the salient features of linux like its ruggedness, free availability 
etc. Only when there is a demand the assemblers will try to install linux.

So far lugs cater to the needs of techies only who already have fair 
knowledge of linux. But what about non-techies like me who are simply 
baffled by the technical jargons ? Now that we have a solution for 
availability of linux CDs by having a linux CD maintainers list, some 
body should come forward to impart knowledge and training on linux. Last 
week I had a chance to meet Mr Chandrasekar Babu and I have requested 
him to conduct such a class. Hope such classes are conducted area wise 
so that non-techies and people who have limited knowledge may benefit.

Some people try to advocate Windows in ilugc but I'd like to draw their 
attention that ilugc is not the forum for propagating windows or other 
Microsoft products. It should be solely used to spread and share one's 
knowledge in _*linux and linux alone.*_* *Do correct me if I'm wrong.

Thanks

Are you handling this shared IRQ in an appropriate

Message-ID: <JOENLJOADKDFGHHHCOCKOEIHCDAA.yuvaraj@novatium.tenet.res.in>

Hello:

We are looking for Linux (Embedded/Systems/Admin) professionals to join
Novatium, a Chennai based company, immediately.

Three visionaries from diverse backgrounds - Prof Ashok Jhunjhunwala (of
IIT-Madras); Ray Stata, Chairman of Analog Devices, USA and Rajesh Jain
(ex-IndiaWorld and MD of Netcore Solution, Mumbai) have come together to set
up Novatium Solutions in Chennai.  These individuals have been thinking
about low cost PCs (thin-clients) for a long time and they think now is the
time India and other developing nations need one.

They believe developing countries like India need low cost computers for
penetration of benefits of ICT to the masses. What is needed is 80% of the
PC ability at a 20% cost. This venture intends to build thin-clients that
not only makes computing very affordable but also makes them easy to use and
manage - like an "appliance".  In the past six months some crucial
development has already happened at IIT-Madras.  Novatium will build on this
base to develop its Linux based thin-clients.  The first thin-client is
expected to be ready by Jan-end.  Novatium is targeting a price-point of
less than Rs.4500.

Like a true product company Novatium will be a R&D and Sales organisation.
We are keen to put together a team consisting of the best and the brightest.
We are looking for a person with a big appetite for learning and challenge -
and in building a motivated team.  We offer an opportunity to not only do
well but also to create an impact in the development of India.  Some leading
stalwarts with whom we have shared this idea, are convinced we have an
opportunity to create a deep impact with this innovation.

In case you are interested please send us your resume and contact number.
Please feel free to ask your queries.  Since we have just started we do not
have a website.  I am enclosing a small note on Novatium below

Regards,
Yuvaraj


--------------------------------------
About Novatium Solutions Pvt Ltd.


Belief
That the next few hundred million users (mostly in the developing world)
need a device that is 80% of PC and at 20% of the cost (<Rs 5K or <$100) - a
device that has the ease of use of a home appliance.

Building
Comprehensive computing services for the next few hundred million users by
making computing more affordable and relevant to their lives. The solution
involves a centralised server-based computing platform--a gigantic computer
of sorts--which hosts a wide range of software applications and content and
which can be accessed by users remotely over broadband connections using
very simple low-cost access devices (or Thin-Clients).  The thin-client will
be built by Novatium.  While sister concerns, Netcore and Tenet companies
will build the Grid and other key pieces.

We are convinced that for about Rs. 700/month (on par with average monthly
mobile bill) we can provide a CommPuting (Communication and Computing)
solution.

Promoters
Novatium is promoted by three visionaries from diverse backgrounds.

Ray Stata received both his Bachelor?s and Master?s degree in Electrical
Engineering from MIT. In 1965, he founded Analog Devices, Inc. with his
former MIT roommate, Matthew Lorber '56 EE and Richard Burwen (a Harvard
alumnus).  He has been chairman and chief executive officer of Analog
Devices Inc. since 1973. Headquartered in Norwood, MA, Analog Devices
designs, manufactures and markets analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal
processing equipment.  Analog Devices has close to 10,000 employees, and
sales of more than $2.5 billion.

Ray is amongst the first who believed and put faith in India and the
abilities of its people.  He will be a Member of the Board providing
valuable guidance.

Rajesh Jain did his B. Tech. in Electrical Engineering from the Indian
Institute of Technology, Bombay in 1988, and his M.S. in Electrical
Engineering from Columbia University, New York in 1989.  He launched
IndiaWorld in 1995. From its pioneering start, IndiaWorld grew to be one of
the largest collection of India-centric websites, comprising Samachar, Khel,
Khoj and Bawarchi. IndiaWorld was acquired by Satyam Infoway (Sify) in
November 1999 for $115 million in one of Asia's largest Internet deals. He
is Managing Director, Netcore Solutions.

He is passionate about building the new India enabled by internet and
information technology.  Amongst the most influential bloggers [Blog:
http://www.emergic.org].  Rajesh will lead Novatium and be its CEO and
Member of the Board.

Dr Ashok Jhunjhunwala is professor of the department of electrical
engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai, and was department
chair till recently. He received his BTech degree from IIT, Kanpur, in 1975,
and his MS and PhD degrees from the University of Maine, USA, in 1977 and
1979, respectively.  Since 1981, he has been teaching at IIT, Chennai. He
was instrumental in establishing the TENET group at IIT, Chennai, with
fellow faculty members, with a vision to make India a design house in the
area of telecom and computer networks. Dr Jhunjhunwala has championed the
cause that a lower telecom infrastructure cost will make telecom affordable
to more Indians.

For his pioneering efforts he has been awarded numerous awards including the
Padma Shri in 2002.  His TeNeT group has incubated a number of R&D companies
which work in partnership with TeNeT group to develop world class
technologies. The products include corDECT Wireless in Local Loop system,
Fibre Access Network, DSL Systems and several other systems.  He and his
TENET group will provide technical expertise to Novatium.  He will also be a
Member of the Board.

Check the maximum limit of the cache. Check whether your
squid.conf points to lots of space that does not exist on the
filesystem.. if you want to clear the cache., I dont think the
"-z" option will do it. You'll have to manually remove the cache
and then recreate the cache directories using that option.

 yes, that is really a good idea and thats how we need
to spread the popularity of linux. and ofcourse Kaavi
at Kilpauk garden had already conducted one such
"linux learning camp" but we were not able to go into
depth as i myself lack that knowledge, but any how we
were able to give them the basic idea of setting up
their own linux boxes, answer to some questions like
"why linux .?" why open source.?" 

We had a good response too.
Thanks to ilugc.

i agree with boovarahan. to start with, we can contact City Schools
and engineering colleges and ask them to arrange a linux demo day on
their school/college. we, ilugc members will give all the technical
details and help students learns linux for free.

we shall provide them with following things,
1. Linux distros
2. Linux Live CDs
3. software used for development in linux
4. games in linux
5.  books in CDs etc

like this if we provide along with a 1 day demo, i am sure students
will eagerly participate and start using the linux and enjoy it.

Hi Yuvaraj Galada,

                    Nice to hear about another consortium looking to
provide low cost computing in India.The Rat-Race for a Low Cost Linux
PC started long ago i guess.We have Amida Simputer which has already
-hit the markets, but failed to get the actual market response.It was
a SA1110 Strong arm based device.We have now better variants like
S3C2410 (Samsung) with complete Linux ports (Mizi)on it. The one
question that quizzez me is that provding a touchscreen LCD + PDA for
Rs.4500.I guess you should be cutting out on the Processor (maybe a
Coldfire or a Non MMU variant),Flash (maybe 2MB-4MB)and SDRAM
(16MB).But with my experience in porting in Linux i guess the whole
box ends up being just another linux solution , even mobile phones
now-a-days are equipped with a similar configuration for almost the
same price.But it is really nice to hear about your new effort to
spread linux usage.

All the best to you in your Porting effort,

Regards

.Bharath.

ILUGC has been doing programs like this quite regularly at LUCAS TVS / for the
IEEE at IIT-M etc .. and they seem to be quite a success.

One thing that has been done in the past is to find a local IT exhibition and
convince the organizers to donate a stall to the LUG.  Then, ask redhat india,
novell india etc for demo copies of Fedora, SuSE personal edition etc that can
be passed out to people who want .. and copies of other distros with a few fast
CD burners handy for those who want other distros.  

Ideally - single CD distros like knoppix rather than 3..5 CD distros like FC3
and Debian can be burnt right at the venue.

People can also just talk about their linux related problems (there'll be a
fair number of LAN admins who got convinced to install pcq linux and dont know
too much about how to do stuff with it, etc) ... and quite often it turns out
that there's a geek in the city who's not in the LUG yet and would make a great
addition to the LUG :)

Nothing on the scale of it.com / linux bangalore etc .. but find small IT
exhibitions that keep taking place, or work with local orgs like engg college
IEEE chapters, etc to organize more such events.

yeah - mobile phones, small "wifi router + firewall in a box" type stuff such
as the linksys wrt54g etc all exist, and it is nice seeing linux ported to
various embedded platforms.

but please consider what differentiates your port from all the rest of the
linux ports out there .. you will need to focus on the actual userspace apps /
kernel features you'll have to include for your product, and see about porting
those as well .. and whether it is worth writing a whole new port, or just
concentrating on porting and optimizing various apps to an existing embedded
platform for your new app.

Hi All,

BSNL broadband connection is now being made available in Chennai.
Eventhough DataOne is yet to be formally launched they have started
collecting application. 1500 is yet to receive info on this, so contacting
them wont give us much info. But what they say is the service is going to
be launched within a week or 2. The good thing is no more 64kbps
broadband, the min. speed itself is 256kbps. If someone has got more
info on this pls update.

Best Regards,
Mahesh.

Srs,

     To add more points to the user space application.I have used an
Amida Simputer, it has almost all what a normal PDA would have plus
they have a bash(Ash/Csh) Terminal coming out of a Serial console.They
have a USB connector and a pretty good GUI.I think it is QT/QY if i am
not wrong.The Diffculty in using the device comes when the USB devices
does not have supported drivers. They provide most of the standard
2.4.X kernel tree modules with the simputer,ofcourse you could always
connect it your host PC and sync.

They have a jukebox/music player , Open office , a browser (opera i
guess - am not sure long time since i used it). If Novatium is looking
into the PDA market they can be sure of real stiff competition from
Amida.

Now because of Bearish Sales they are looking into POS (Point of
Sales) and other markets to sell the linux box (in fact looking at all
other possible markets).Guess the Low Budget PC market is yet to
mature in India.......

Cheers

.Bharath.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] Python 2.4 Released - Can we have a PUGC please?
Message-ID: <002b01c4d708$a5e14290$0d07a8c0@kums>

Python 2.4 is finally released today.
I hope python gets some serious spotlight at least now.

Is there any Indian Python Users Group, Specifically in India?
(No..don't point me to http://www.izpug.org/  there's
 hardly anything going in their mailing list though the
 company behind izpug - zeOmega - conducts 4-day training
 session on Zope and Plone in Bangalore for a hefty sum 
 - not exactly very helpful!)

I don't know why Python Books are completely ignored even
in major book shops like HigginBothams which stocks 
some really useless books that remain untouched since the
day they were put on the shelf.

Just a few days ago I went shopping for a book on Python
Programming at a nearby bookshop that sells CS/IT books.
The salesman who was confused for a moment at the mention
of "Python" told me that he doesn't have a Python book but
sweared he has a book on "Cobra Programming". I wanted to
laugh but was equally curious to see the book. That guy must
be dyslexic or something because the book was actually titled
"Programming CORBA".

Even some OSS enthusiasts in chennai are game to talk about
perl programming but ask me to come again when mentioned the
name "Python". Python in India - at least in chennai - is 
little known to most of the developer community. None of the
mainstream IT education centers that I know of has a course
on Python (please do tell me if I am being blind to some
obscure institute that teaches python). Even php has gained 
enough corporate support to form a PHP forum in chennai
( see http://www.phpcircle.org/ )

Unfortunately for Python, not a thing like this exists,
and it's left to the individual efforts of a few to acquaint 
themselves in isolation. It's not going to change in a day
or two but the first stones must be laid. I know that even
the ILUGC's admin - Prabhu - is an ardent python fan
and I believe It's no big deal for him to start a 
PUGC [Python User Group, Chennai] or at least a python 
mailing list. I wish he could do that. Any supporters?


Regards
Kumaraguru
