I've been in Bangalore multiple times in the recent past and I dont think
I've seen any of the bus stop names written in English.

Strange! When I was the last time you came to Bangalore? I live in
Bangalore since Jan 2007
till now. I travel from all the way from  Frazer Town to Electronic
City every weekday and I see bus stop
names written in English all the way.

Not strange at all. I've lived in Bangalore from 1999 uptil 2002. I visit
bangalore once in a couple of months, after that. And, I usually stay either
in Koramangala
or in Indira Nagar. I've not seen any bus stop names painted in English. You
are not insinuating that "English" is written in Kannada...;)

Perhaps there is a confusion between stop names on the buses itself and the
names of the stops as written on the bus-stop shelters!

This is getting rather frivolous. Lets end it!

Yes. Indeed.  I am referring to the latter.

stop names on the buses:
Only Volvo AC and other BIA Airport buses have the stop names in English.

Here is an article which shows that Google is set to overtake
Microsoft financially!

http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/5/google_to_surpass_size_of_microsoft_windows_in_2009

Expecially noteworthy is the "important observation" on why Google
will rise --- "It is a natural monopoly".

Let me re-iterate that it is not my intention to say that Google is
"evil" --- howver, as companies become monopolies they tend to take
the "either you are with us or you are against us" attitude. This
is road from civility (inter-operability) towards "evil"ity. ;)

Kapil.

You mean the 'Let us promote ILUGC' attitude or the 'Let us wait till

I have been hearing that Google is preferring to build tools inhouse than
using FOSS tools - though it contributes to OSS in its own sweet way - but i
am yet to see a 'really cool' FOSS tool from Google's stables.

Having said that, i find that the biggest asset in GOOG is there employees -
some of them who are not egomaniacs :)

I do not consider Y! here - am always confused whether they are a media
company or a tech company! btw...i happen to know of an instance wherein in
one of the Y! interviews(for their search team) - the interviewer ended up
asking the interviewee about the fields in the RSS feed :P and asked how the
individual fields that can be stored in a MySQL table.

"write" can be used. But it does send messages on different computers. It is
for users on the same system but different terminals.

I'll try to not look like I'm speaking as a Yahoo! employee here :)
Instead, I shall merely try to explain why the notion of 'monopoly' is
a common running thread across all stock-market driven companies such
as Google or Yahoo! or Microsoft. I'll try and elaborate why its not
really in the companies hands to be pure of heart given the conficting
drive to make profits.  and interestingly, even a seemingly altrusitic
thing such as releasing "really cool" FOSS tool. The motive is the
same. The approach, different.

You gotta understand one thing: End of the day, both Yahoo! and Google
are companies into which the market has invested money and they need
to make 'profits' against the money invested. Don't make profits,
nobody wants to invest in you. Emotional affectives such as freedom to
the world do always take a back seat because the investors don't shake
a leg about such affectives. Doesn't matter whether its a Google or a
Microsoft or a Yahoo!. What differs amongst these is how they intend
to make the money. However,  there is clearly nothing different in
what they all want to do: to gain an exclusive market space and keep
making money in such a way that its difficult for competitors to take
away your market share.

Microsoft's strategies has been the three Es (Embrace, Extend,
Extinguish (see wikipedia for details)). Google's strategy has been to
provide a free-value network to people while making that a marketplace
for advertisers to show their ads. Yahoo! had created a marketplace
for itself by making itself the number one destination on the internet
(yes, even today, Yahoo.com is the most visited website on the
planet). People (especially those of the US) visit Yahoo! because
that's where their tidbits of their daily lives come from - Mail,
News, Photos, bookmarks, media sharing and so on. Yahoo! had
traditionally been making money pretty well by displaying
advertisements on these 'destinations'. We all know about how
advertising drives up sales and so on. While traditional advertising
is all about registering a brand in the observer's mind, a significant
portion of advertising is also to find out the user's intent. While
each Yahoo! destination went the way of mining the user's data and
using it to deliver relevant ads, Google's strategy was quite
different - they ended up asking the user to provide his intention
into a search box. That's where, things took a big turn in how the
internet advertising industry evolved. Soon advertisers saw the great
potential of search based advertising and Google became a one-hit
wonder.

So, its all about the advertisements in the end. Google does it by
some ways. Yahoo! uses some other... and there are lot of overlaps
between the two too. Now, both have figured, being destinations isn't
the way they are going to grow further and that being good with
interoperability is the way to go. Google allows folks to access their
data through APIs. Yahoo! also has APIs to a lot of it's services
(del.icio.us, flickr, maps... and I'm sure you heard about Search
Monkey :) ). Besides APIs, I can say with certainity, amongst google
and Yahoo!, Yahoo! has released quite a lot of pretty interesting open
source software. The first that comes to my mind is Hadoop and all the
work around hadoop (pig, etc.,.)... and for the common netizen, YUI,
Yahoo!'s contributions to mysql and even the FreeBSD project. Compare
this to the 'funding' by Google to the Mozilla project. IMO, it is
merely a distribution 'deal' (ie.,. to have google as the default
search engine) than a funding per-se. You see, I'm not saying Google
is evil. I'm saying, even if google's pure-hearted intention was to
fund the Mozilla project, they wouldn't have been able to do it
without explaining to their investors why they want to give away that
money. Becoming the default search engine on Mozilla is their answer
to the investors.

Finally, I'd like to throw some perspective about the 'question' you
were asked in your interview. Before I joined Yahoo!, I worked for an
embedded systems company. The challenges there are quite different:
It's about being memory efficient and the data one deals with is
typically small. For instance, one of my interview questions was to
write a program to extract common words between two files. My initial
answer was a technically working answer. But the moment my interviewer
asked me "What if there were a million words in both the files?", I
had to rethink my program because now we are talking a completely
different scale and the problem has morphed into a new one. Its not
about 'finding' the intersection, but about finding it effectively
given the large scale.

Extracting and storing an RSS feed into a database is a very similar
question too. It has quite a few elements that can be optimised and
they were just testing your design, data structure and approach, IMO.
Imagine, you have a billion RSS feeds to process, wouldn't you have to
think differently about how you'll do trivial things such as sorting
or defining your database schema? Would you even be able to run a
single database instance? ... and how are you going to be
fault-tolerant?

Cheers,

  -Suraj

What is this?  At least give a 2 line description of what it does to

Sathish,

This is really a great news that some one from colleges is taking the
initiative.

However, you havent specified your requirements exactly.  What are the areas
you want to use open source software?

I am lobbying my sister to implement mail server, webserver in her college
(kumarasamy college, karur), which she also agreed.
I have also canvassed a couple of students in Mahendra college to implement
the same there..

I feel, it is the simple starting of some serious opensource technologies at
the college level.

My proposal is that can we form a network of college professors, to share
and diverse open source knowledge and skill sets?

Am sorry for i havent replied to the bulk of the email - i felt asleep..i
got blinded. Suddenly i woke up and saw some references to 'you' and since
the previous email was mine - then i presume 'you is me' :P

I guess you didnt read the Q properly : storing the fields in a Mysql
table(as in 'desc tablename')  is different from creating a format(read
'Data structure') in which lookups are faster and is also feasible on the
space(we learnt it in college as 'Time/Space complexity').

On second thoughts, probably you are right, probably the interviewee should
have anticipated the Qs that 'desc tablename' will lead to 'design a custom
rdbms'.

Just two days back, we were asked to practice some shell commands in the OS
lab..
There was a guy who did a wall help!
The teacher sent him outta the class.. She could have done much better by

Or the teacher could have told him nicely to use such tools with care, 
explain the ramifications of such action but sending him out of the 
class gives a wrong message IMO.

How will the student learn if s/he is not allowed to experiment?

Thank you, Aditya Manthramurthy !!!

I tried write command

like $ write verman
there was a error saying "write: verman is not logged in"

can you give me some examples on write.

thanks,

Greetings Arun Khan !!!

I thought that everyone know about LAN (Local Area Network), but without
knowing "LAN" there is no use of learning "wall" command.

since you don't know what is LAN, I can explain you.

LAN means "Local Area Network".

Messenger means "messaging program, designed for use within a single local
area network".

In windows, there is a console utility called NET SEND, by which we can
send messages to other users, computers, or messaging names on the local
area network.

eg. c:\>net send 10.0.0.10 Happy birthday to you
the message sucessfully send to 10.0.0.10

Here "Happy birthday to you" is the message and 10.0.0.10 is the
IP-address of my friend.

Likewise, Is there is any command in linux.


With "wall" we can send a message to everybody in the LAN.

my question,Is there is command in GNU/Linux where I can send messages to
a particular user or hostname.

Here user referred to "user working in the computer" or hostname referred
to the "computer name".


Can you tell me the GNU/Linux command, where I can send messages to a
particular user or hostname?


-----------------
> Is there any command to send messages to a particular user or

user - email?
host - rexec?


what do you mean by email? & rexec?

At least give a 2 line description, what does it mean?

thanks,

Verman

Well if the user if logged in and that too has an active terminal,
when you use the command, the text will appear on his/her terminal.

See "man write". It won't work across different computers if they are
not part of the same system. This means that it will work as you
expect it to, only if users are present on different terminals and
logged on to the same server. In my experience, such setups are rarer
than they used to be. You can open a terminal and try sending a
message to yourself, to get a feel of how this will work.

The commands relating to messaging users

shell based:
wall : all users
write : to specific user with optional specific tty
talk : two way chat

for X11
xmessage

Note: When in GUI, shell based tools will work normally only on those windows  where shell is open. If no shell is open, no message will be received.

I remember in fvwm default days, some tool to trap such messages even if no shell is open. I forgot it name.

xmessage depends on xauth setting.

console messages depend on mesg setting
you can set accept/deny messages by using
$ mesg y/n

If mesg is globally set in /etc/bashrc it can be overwritten at command prompt by mesg command.

It is mesg y or mesg n not mesg off


Raman.P



      Did you know? You can CHAT without downloading messenger. Go to http://in.messenger.yahoo.com/webmessengerpromo.php/

This is a much better explanation. It could have been written as
follows.

Lan Messenger::
	In the Windows context the LAN consists of a number of
	*single-user* desktop machines connected to each other
	and possibly to some server machines and sharing resources in
	various ways over the network.

	In a Windows LAN one service available on the LAN is to send a
	message to a specific collection of desktops. This is called
	"Lan Messenger".

Since a typical Unix LAN is *not* structured as a collection of
single-user machines, such a service is typically not available in a
Unix LAN.

If you really need such a service it is not difficult to create it in
a Unix environment. For example, a shell script like
	for host in $(ypcat hosts)
	do
		rexec $host wall < /tmp/msg &
	done
This would require each user to have login access on every machine on
the network. This has associated security issues which can be solved
using ssh or Kerberos.

With multicast and broadcast networking one can think of a lot of more
interesting things. For example, see "whiteboard".

Services that are more "unixy" and already exist to provide similar
features are "IRC" and "talk".

Read:

the article use Google Trend to measure, during the period 2004 - 2008.
the article quotes this guy's theory "On the Web, If You're Not
Growing, You're Dying"
http://www.louisgray.com/live/2008/06/on-web-if-youre-not-growing-youre-dying.html

it shows Debian, Redhat, Fedora, Suse, OpenSuse,
Slackware  declining.

but Ubuntu grows a lot.

the last graph shows  the term ubuntu has become almost as
popular as Linux.

I did a Google Trend search with all of these "debian, redhat, fedora,
slackware, suse, opensuse , ubuntu"
http://www.google.com/trends?q=debian%2C+redhat%2C+fedora%2C+slackware%2C+suse%2C+opensuse+%2C+ubuntu&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=1

but Google Trend seems to have limitation of 5 terms.

In India  (at least per Google Trends), Red hat and Fedora rules.

One linux distribution which is not even in the top 96 of the distrowatch
charts is Crux. But imho, it has a great set of users. I would choose crux
for source based systems and archlinux for binary systems.

Also Red Hat and Fedora are well established. IIT uses RHEL, Fedora and
Debian.. It is unlikely to switch to Ubuntu et al.

I believe no linux distro will die till it loses its last user

They very well might change. Newer batches will know that Ubuntu is
doing better and maybe even be enthusiasts themselves enough to make
the change!

This is the (IMHO) flawed philosphy of "Trend mongering" that leads
people/companies/programs to want to grab more and more.

What happened to the Unix philosphy of doing one thing and doing it
really well?

If the program is a web browser, it should be a web-browser and not
try to be a film-viewer, mail-reader, editor, programming interface
etc. etc.

The surrounding O/S (kernel+libraries) should provide reasonable ways
for these different programs to pass the relevant objects to the
program that (according to a choice made by the user) handles them
best.

When Seamonkey/Iceape became Firefox/Iceweasel it became _smaller_
and avoided dying.

The most complaints about FF3 have been regarding the features that
have been _added_ to it. The most kudos for FF3 have been about how
it uses _less_ memory and time than FF2.

Motto: Removing bugs is more valuable than adding features.

I would never use Ubuntu on a system like a university. It needs some
configuration to fit that bill.. Imagine every user having access to every
file using sudo. Of course it can be modified. But it needs more config than
something that comes configured for this out of the box like Debian. Also
remember, if Debian ever shuts down.. which is next to impossible, there
will be no ubuntu.. ubuntu will need those deb packages to add more shine
too.

I don't want to argue that one is better or worse. But I would like to
clear up things that are deluding you:
1) Only the first user created by the person who installs the system
has sudo powers. All other users created, are normal users who can't
see everything. Unless you explicitly specify it, they are not able to
use sudo to see all files. And this is by default.
2) Ubuntu now manages all its own packages. If debian shuts down (and
I agree thats its rather unlikely), Ubuntu will manage. In any case,
Ubuntu now contributes quite a lot back to the debian project.

Use nmap with caution and judgement.  

It is a swiss knife but you could hurt yourself.

Some site may have policies to block IPs that scan their networks/hosts, 
you could be causing yourself denial of service inadvertently.

I recommend it's use only on hosts/network that are under your purview.

You must checkup the following

I can understand that might have never used Ubuntu with anything more 
than the first created user who has sudo privileges by default. If you 
have ever tried to add more users you wouldn't have said that. Second, 
if ever Debian shutdowns then half the GNU/Linux distros will be in, not 
exactly trouble, but in a very tight position. Remember it's FOSS, so 
even when the main project shuts its door down at sometime, you can take 
up from that point and carry it further. Using these two reasons for not 
using Ubuntu (or the second reason for not using Debian or it's 
derivatives) is pretty lame.

Err... sorry I should have been more specific. The part where you say
"Ubuntu now manages all its own packages" is something that leapt out.
It would be nice if you could provide some explanation about that.

Determine the partition in which the file you wish to recover was
located. Type pwd in shell command..
Unmount the partition...
Use lsdel command...which lists all the deleted files...
Be patient as it takes some time... :-)
Recover those files by typing  dump <file name>...

IIT appears to be moving towards Debian...The DCF of my department (computer
science) shifted all desktops from Suse to Debian Etch recently. My lab
(RISE) shifted all desktops from RHEL/Fedora to Debian Lenny recently.

I completely agree with the KISS principle, but there are a few cases
where thinking outside the box results in something that changes the way
software is written. Emacs for example. It might be a kitchen sink, but
when you get a complete desktop environment that fits within a few megabytes,
I am more than willing to accommodate it.

That is great.. I know some systems under santosh were using Sid.. But I saw
one sabayon and  the rest were RHEL there.. It is good if it moved to Lenny

Would it be possible for you to share as to what were the factors that

I am worried about extracting TAR files...(1) What if it contains files with
absolute paths? (2) What if it contains files with ".." in the path? (3)
What if it violates the Unix convention of extracting the contents in a
sub-directory?

Are these problems possible? And what can be done to reduce the risk? I
currently use "tar -t" but I want something easier.

I'm sorry too. Its my fault. I meant to say that "Ubuntu *can* now
manage all its own packages", mainly in the sense that with its
growing popularity, it should be able to find enough people to hold up
the enormous number of packages, in case Debian disappears (which is
itself a completely arbitrary assumption).

As Parthan said, in FOSS, someone can always take the software further
even if the current devels leave. I definitely agree that Ubuntu would
not have been possible without Debian, but we cannot say that Ubuntu
cannot continue if Debian shuts down.

I just did

in Debian Etch, but I got some unreadable characters. The problem is not
with my terminal (xfce4-terminal) as it handles even Tamil script. The file
is probably encoded in ISO-8859-1. So how do I cat it? I don't want to
change my locale, which is:

    export LANG='en_IN.UTF-8'

Use -C option to stage the files in some other dir.

A system back up (e.g. tar on /) will contain  such files esp. in /etc.  
What is your concern?

Then you have a compromised version of tar.  This could happen with any 
command e.g. a compromised rm could wipe out your system (presuming 
that you are doing this with root privilege)

Once the message goes out from our system, can we control over what

Let me ask a simple question: How to convert a file from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8
on the command line? Is there some command like:

    transcode --input-encoding ISO-8859-1 --output-encoding UTF-8 < /usr/share/dict/words > dict.utf8

Emacs is an interesting example. Note that basically emacs is:

 (a) an editor
 (b) a lisp interpreter

The latter is the "main" function and the former is a consequence!

Everything else you do with Emacs is done by running lisp code.

So saying that emacs "tries to do everything" is not very different
from saying that that perl/python tries to do everything.

Another good example of how things evolve to down-size is "xulrunner"
which is the fundamental interpreter which runs the different
applications like Firefox, Thunderbird etc. The former is "merely" a
UI engine with networking capabilities.

Now that I have said all this, I confess that I mostly use "elvis"
and "w3m" in preference to "emacs" and "firefox/conkeror".

Regards,

Kapil.

I you mean that an archive could contain files like
	../.ssh/authorized_keys
which if extracted in /home/luser/testarea/
could over-write the authorized_keys file of the user?

GNU (and most other modern tar versions) do not allow such
over-writing by default. Specifically, leading '/' and '..' are
recursively stripped and symbolic links pointing outside the current
directory are not followed. (Don't believe me! Just test it out!)

However, there are situations where a user may want to do this. So
there is the "-P" option to tar which disables this safety feature.

Regards,

Kapil.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

cut -- CUT a specified part form the file and Print it on stdout.

Summary : 

Print selected parts of lines from each file(s) to standard output.

Examples :

Create file1 with 10 columns (separated by TAB) of data for 10 lines 
and file2 with 10 columns (separated by space) of data for 10 lines.

$ cut -b2 file1 -- Print only the byte in 2 position. Tab & Backspace
                   are treated like a 1 byte char.

$ cut -b1,3,5 file1 -- Print only the bytes in 1,3 & 5 positions.

$ cut -c2 file1 -- Print only character in 2nd position. Normally 
                   same as -b option. But you can feel the difference 
                   only with multi-byte encodings (Unicode).

$ cut -f5 file1 -- Print only the 6th field. TAB is default separator.

$ cut -f4- file1 -- Print from 4th field to last field.

$ cut -f-5 file1 -- Print from 1st field to 4th field.

$ cut -d' ' -f3-5 file2 -- Print only the fields from 3 to 5, which is 
                           separated by spaces.

$ cut -s -d' ' -f2 file2 -- Don't print lines that don't contain the 
                            delimiter,space (line without a delimiter 
                            is printed verbatim).

$ cut -f2-5,7-9 --output-delimiter=',' file1 -- In the output, field
                   will be separated by "," (Not by the default one).

Note:
1) Use one, and only one of -b, -c or -f.  
2) Range or many ranges can be separated by commas. 
3) Range of Bytes/Chars/Fields can specified like this:
   
  N   == Only Nth byte, character or field.

Dear All,

Presently LinuXpert Systems has involved in the process of setting up FOSS Labs in many 
engineering colleges / universities and we have signed MoU's with those institutions
to implement FOSS labs and also to train the staff members and students as per the MoU.

If any institution requires help in setting up a FOSS lab they may write to 

opensource@vsnl.net / linuxpert@vsnl.net

come on ilugc. you can give a better analysis. someone has posted an nmap output
of the unixpod.com server, someone else posted the result of a telnet 22. so, it
should be clear what is happening - ssh is running, the port is open and the
firewall is allowing incoming ssh connections. for whatever reason, the server
is refusing ssh connections from student <at> jtuxmeet - it may be the user id,
it may be the client host (ip). so, the only solution is to contact the sysadmin
at unixpod.com and find out why this client is being refused ssh access. there
is also the possibility of an intervening firewall that is setup to putout this
message (instead of the standard message), but this is very unlikely.

if we go by the traffic at the iitm ftp server (which has ubuntu, debian, fedora
and centos mirrors), ubuntu is king. centos, debian and fedora place a distant
second. also, the computer centre at iitm is likely to stick with rhel because
of support issues.

Does Fedora have the content updated yet? I don't see much in

http://ftp.iitm.ac.in/fedora/releases/9/

It is unlikely you will get any traffic without the latest content. All 
I see is the netboot iso.

Just to test, I tried running ssh and irc explicitly. ssh works but
irc port is closed.

I am able to access my unixpod account. Do note that the servers of unixpod
went down after a kernel update and the accounts had to be requested again.

Even then, doesn't ssh actually need a user@server.org syntax?
I am still at a loss how just "$ ssh unixpod.com" would work.

Maybe it's because the unixpod public key is in your known_hosts in your
local workstation but not in your college computer from which you are trying
to access unixpod. I have a hunch that if you don't give the user name, ssh
automagically substitutes the remote user id as the one with which you
currently logged in. Can anyone confirm this?

So going by that logic, you are trying to login from "student" user account
in your college. Subsequently ssh tries to login as
$ ssh student@unixpod.com

which i am sure doesn't exist

No it isn't this way. Atleast it should connect to the server, only
then will it determine if the public key matches? The problem here is
he isn't able to connect at all.
I don't have the public key but still am able to connect.

Yes, ssh assumes your current username.

It should connect still.
I tried with ssh -v unixpod.com and it connects, though my username is mehul.
The username and public keys can only come after the connection is
made. Here it is flatly refusing the connection. I am doubting that
outgoing traffic is blocked except for certain ports.

Yes, I can. It can be found in man pages. I do it pretty often.

No. This is not right. ssh will anyway ask for the password, take it and
then say that its a wrong password.

Anyway it seems to work as expected now:

adi@ubuntu-family:~$ ssh student@unixpod.com
The authenticity of host 'unixpod.com (12.205.155.236)' can't be
established.
RSA key fingerprint is de:a6:3d:d8:09:26:ce:63:67:e6:ec:c8:81:38:a2:0d.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'unixpod.com,12.205.155.236' (RSA) to the list of
known hosts.
student@unixpod.com's password:
Permission denied, please try again.
student@unixpod.com's password:

So I guess everything is fine now?

First of all, our lab badly needed a revamp. Lots of systems just
weren't working and there were some three NIS domains( for 35-40
systems ), some ppl had account in just one domain and couldn't login
is some machines and so on.. The task of doing this revamp was given
to me. And i like debian :)  The fact that we had the debian
repository next building(IITM ftp) also helped. I setup a FAI(Fully
automatic installation) server and did all the client configurations
in that (I setup ldap for authentication, which reqd editing 4-5 files
on the clients). After that all the 40 machines installation happened
in some 3 hours without any intervention and the systems were ready
for use right away!

Good to note you moved to ldap.

Please document your procedures so that other's can reference your work.

You could write an article in linuxgazette.net (like Pranesh's vim tut.)

WHY I RECOMMEND DEBIAN:

1. It is not controlled by any company
2. Superior design (Ex: /usr/sbin/update-alternatives)
3. Stability (Ex: Used on the space shuttle mission STS-83)
4. APT
5. FAI (Fully Automatic Installation)

Thank you (both of you) for taking time to respond. You do bring up 
interesting points. Just another question - what RHEL were you running 
earlier ? ie what variant of RHEL ?

WHY I RECOMMEND MANDRIVA

1. Controlled by a company
2. Superior design (Ex: Harddrake)
3. Stability (Ex: used by my grandmother
4. URMPI
5. UCI User Controlled installation

It is the responsibility of the archive creator to follow the convention.
What if the archive was created from within the directory, ie, what if:

    cd foo && tar -cf ../foo.tar *

was used? The above command is perfectly legal, the problem with it is that
it violates the convention. The correct command is:

    tar -cf foo.tar foo

Malicious tricks are also possible: For example, if I am extracting
something in my home directory, what if the archive overwrote .bash_profile
or .bashrc ?

WHY I RECOMMEND GENTOO

1. Not controlled by a company
2. Superior design  (Ex: portage, revdep-rebuild, USE flags, Parallel fetch
(downloads sources in the background when sources are compiling, so
upgrading a gentoo and ubuntu/debian box takes the same time)
3. Stability
4. Teaches Patience!
5. Rolling upgrades, no versioning.
6. More *unique* packages than any other distro, (-dev -dbg packages doesnt
count)

And oh yeah, all that messages scrolling during emerge feels geeky..:D

The topic itself is not for making intelliget comments . There are so
many distros ..each is good on its field .. so a topic like this will
cause flaming ..its obvious .

Instead which distro is lacking in which field would have made some sense ..

Anyway, I will add my 2-paise worth.

Why I prefer Debian? Come to the ilugc meeting next Saturday and

Why not experiment and find out?!

Hint: You need to _force_ GNU tar to create an archive with funny
paths by using the " -P " option. Do not use this option while
extracting the archive and see what happens.

If you try it on US government sites, you might have the police at your door
step. I am telling you this since it happened to one of my friends pretty
much in Chennai. They take these sort of things seriously. It is pretty easy
for the police to come hard on you, since they have no clue about what nmap
is. They will basically be thinking you were "hacking". Be very careful.

my comment above about ubuntu being king is limited to iitm internal users
(which is the thread i was replying to). as for external users, the ftp.iitm
traffic shows fedora as most popular by a huge margin (though we have been
mirroring debian etc for much longer). it is news to me that the server does not
have latest content; server seems to have gone down now, i will have to get
someone to get it back up and see if there is any problem. the updates are run
every day and my update script logs (even as of yesterday) showed successful
updating of the fedora tree.

would you care to expand on this? there is such a thing called a time stamp in
the fedora tree also. checked that lately before making such an accusation?
ubuntu, debian and fedora all have the same update schedule on the ftp.iitm
server. fedora generates more traffic on the server than anything else. the
server seems to be down right now, i have to get someone to get it back up and
then we can check this.

It would be nice to have the server up. With the IIT-M server in place,
it does make a significant difference to the mirror coverage in India.

I would have thought that Google and Yahoo servers would be able to
handle the hammering from nmap? Isn't US Gov sites a different issue?

I have a doubt. How do people find the IIT-M FTP mirror for distros?
At least for Ubuntu it has not been listed on the ubuntu site [0] (in
their list of mirrors).

It is not an issue of whether a site/network can handle the 
nmap "hammering"  It is up to the org.  If they have a security policy 
to go after people who try to probe their network (which is what nmap 
does), they can choose to do so.

In another thread, I had made the point to use such tools **only** on 
systems that under **your** purview.

If you still don't get it then please go ahead and nmap all the sites 
you want.  Don't be surprise if the cops are knocking on your door one 
fine morning.

Unfortunately, the law will *not* give you any leeway for being a "n00b"  
AFAIK, there have been young adults, amongst cyber criminals who were 
caught and prosecuted, for similar activities.

The moral of the story is do not use such tools indicriminately.  If you 
don't know ask someone who can guide you.

Is it possible for you to share with us info on what broadly constitutes the
"FOSS Lab" set up  by you? I understand that you may have different set ups
in different colleges, but I presume there should be some basic set up
common to all with additional features to cater to individual cases.

While it is unlikely, it _can_ be reproduced.

On your local machine do 
	iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j REJECT

This will reject all _outgoing_ port 22 connections so if you do
	ssh a.b.c.d 
You will get "connection refused" for any a.b.c.d

Don't forget to do
	iptables -D OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j REJECT
after completing this experiment!

Note that a similar REJECT rule on the gateway for "jtuxmeet" for the
FORWARD table would have a similar effect.

Kapil.

Hi All,

OK, let me tell you the reason for opting ELCOT laptop, I checked Dell and
Compaq , I found the difference of price was not more than 5K - 6K, but the
warranty period(3 years) and all the open source applications made me go for
ELCOT Laptop.

*I am not going to buy ELCOT Laptop.(NOT AT ALL)

*I called up ELCOT sunday morning, and the person who picked up the phone
guided me for the place,which is in Nandanam, I wanted to see the Laptop
before buying it, which I was sure I will.When I reached there, I met a
ELCOT guy wearing Linux T-Shirt and I was ...Wow these guys are promoting
Opensource, but I was wrong, to my suprise he told me that the office is
closed today,I said I just called up and the person who responded my call,
asked me to come down, he became wild at me and took me to ELCOT office,
which is in second floor and Security guy was sitting in office and he said
that no one called him,I justified my point that I just called them few
minutes back, and he swear that no one called them and they dont work on
sundays.

Check this out -
http://www.elcot.in/StudentLaptop2008/laptopTermsAndCondition.php?mode=SQ==

Inspection would be facilitated on Saturday and Sunday only in Chennai as a
special case. Inspection hours - between 9.30 A.M and 5 P.M.

I Never trust goverment employees, and they proved me that I am RIGHT.

1.What is the gurantee that they will deliver Laptop on time ?
2.What is the gurantee that the purchase order for Student Laptop will be
confirmed ?

They say that - 3 years International warranty for Laptop and 1 year
warranty for battery from the date of installation and handing over of the
Laptop.

I CANNOT TRUST THEM, BECUASE THEY JUST EAT THEIR WORDS.

*Please do not got for it.*

Shed some 4k-to 5k and you can buy the same hardware configuration from Dell
,HP or some other merchant, and I am sure that the service will be to your
satisfaction.

Thanks and Regards,

Towfeeque Aalam.

iitm is an archive mirror, not a cd mirror; so, you will find it listed at

https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors

i am not an ubuntero, but i believe what this means is that if you want to start
installing, you have to download the cd installer image from one of the cd
mirrors (or borrow an installer cd); once in the installer, if you choose
network install, ftp.iitm will show in your list of locations from where you can
download packages to install.

I am convinced to consider this a mindless rant because of one bad
experience. You are taking it far too seriously. There is no need to
buy the laptop on terms of "we will keep our *word* about the
guarantees". You will surely get official documentation to the effect
of giving you the promised warranty. And this is company warranty, not
ELCOT's. I know of a couple of friends who bought the laptop last year
in a similar offer and are pretty happy with their choice and service.

They say that 4-5 weeks is the delivery time. It is understandable as
its a high volume deal. A similar sale happened last year, and there
were no problems with delivery, etc. At least nothing happened in the
case of my friends and nothing was reported in the papers either.
Similarly, with the confidence that it happened ok last year, I can
say that your concern about purchase orders is equally baseless.

The company has a good track record in this computer business with the
social cause of  promoting linux usage to save costs and spreading
openness/freedom. In case you don't know, they have setup "ELCOT labs"
all over Tamil Nadu in state sponsored schools with SUSE enterprise
linux. Just because the staff here in Chennai are incompetent, you
bring great charges to defame them. A little overboard I think.

Its very difficult to escape the Windows tax if you buy it yourself.

I think you should try to find the price of the same configuration in
dell, along with the three years support (at least they have a
customise feature [0]). I did it for you. See the order details at
[1].

Price after taxing (including delivery), is Rs. 56,392!

Ok, even I am terribly surprised by this (so please check at the link
above). But the configuration is nearly the same, except that the
wem-cam is 2 MP instead of ELCOT's 1.3 MP. I had to 7.3K for 320GB
harddisk, ~1K for carry case, and some 8 K for 3 years support. I hope
you reconsider, because you will miss out on quite something here!

Acer does not seem to display prices on its site or I would have
checked them out as well. But Acer does seem to preload linux for some
models, but I have heard that it is very minimal version. That does
not really matter for us, eh? We can always install something :P.
Perhaps its cheap compared to Dell. If someone finds out, please
share.

I can predict that people will argue that when we buy by ourselves, we
won't go in for so much support, HDD space, etc. So that is again
another point for why people should take this offer more seriously.

I know that its a little hard to put up with a government
organisation, because we have been brought up in a way to have very
negative thoughts about it. I think that ELCOT is different. If we are
a little patient (just like we are patient with driver problems in
Linux :D ), we can be happy with this deal.

Yes, the timestamps are correct but there is virtually no content. I 
send you a mail offlist a couple of weeks back which you might have

 Hi all,
         Regarding the ELCOT offer, it is not about the guarantee on paper
as much as it is to the degree of trust one can place with the
company.Aditya gave us a nice and long description extolling the virtues of
ELCOT's offer as well as other activities of ELCOT. What he failed to
address was about the discrepancies on the part of ELCOT with what is on
paper and it's dealing with the people. He also failed to allay the fear and
unrest in taufiq aalam's mind with respect to ELCOT. He dismisses it as "
mindless rant because of one bad experience."         Now let us check out
what this "one bad experience" is. Well first of all let me clearly state
who i am. I am taufiq's friend and i went
along with him to check out this laptop that is supposed to be on
display "<http://tr_1215488444101/>Inspection
would be facilitated on Saturday and Sunday only in
Chennai<http://www.elcot.in/StudentLaptop2008/studentLaptopFAQ.php#2419>as
a special case. Inspection hours - between 9.30 a.m and 5
p.m."<http://www.elcot.in/StudentLaptop2008/studentLaptopFAQ.php#2419>
Well we did go on Sunday at about 10 a.m. Before leaving we called up
ELCOT.A man picked up the phone and we asked him whether the laptops were
available for inspection and he said it was. Then we asked him for
directions which he gave us. On arriving at the place, we had to go up and
ask the guy regarding the inspection. The reaction he gave us cannot be
expressed in words but it was a typical "I am the boss here and who the hell
are u midgets to ask me for anything" kind of a reaction given to us. Then
we told him about the call and the security, while sneering down on us,
flatly refused having received any call and he thought we were making fools
of ourselves. It was the typical Government employed behaviour that we have
been seeing all over our lives.
         By the way what was that about "I know that its a little hard to
put up with a government organisation, because we have been brought up in a
way to have very negative thoughts about it." Whoever says such a statement
must have never had to deal with a government organisation himself. It is
the same all over the country to a large extent and hence we prefer and
trust private companies over government ones even if they offer us a cheap
deal. The red tape is a very irritating and life-consuming force, it just
sucks out the life from u. In fact i feel it would be very good if they keep
a board outside their premises that says "Beware of GOVT employees". Then,
at least innocent unassuming people like us will know what we are dealing
with beforehand.          "I think that ELCOT is different. If we are a
little patient (just like we are patient with driver problems in Linux :D ),
we can be happy with this deal." Well well , maybe the product from ELCOT is
different but the employees definitely are the same as far as we know. They
may promise you three years warranty but the government is so good in making
you run around for some mistake of the Government. In fact we have come
across so many instances wherein we had to run around for some mistake of
some Government employee's. I hope that it is not the case with ELCOT.
           Having said that I am going to wind up the rant which i think is
not so mindless and not without good reason. So far we have evaluated the
people not yet the product. We will be doing that and will get back to you
guys. Who knows it may be the case of the "Frowning man selling candy".

This is a generalisation which is unwarranted.

Suppose I generalise about the quality of software written by private
companies based on my experiences with MicroSoft?

There is red-tape in a number of organisations. Moreover, deliberately
rude people in any organisation can usually be found gathered around
the red-tape admiring it! :-)

This should not detract from the following points:
 a. Obtaining a laptop with GNU/Linux pre-installed from a vendor is
 next to impossible unless a bulk purchase is made.
 b. ELCOT (or some group of people within ELCOT) has made
 arrangements for such a bulk purchase on behalf of students of TN.
 c. The hardware configuration and price range chosen for this bulk
 purchase is adequate for typical usage.

Regards,

Kapil.

Subject: [Ilugc] duplicate IP on network Issue
Message-ID: <cbf34a590807080318r6a03ab10i7262f087c4404973@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

 Need your suggestions on what could have gone wrong in the following scenario
we have a solaris box running peacefully for the last couple of years,
Box runs a proprietary CMS server and bugzilla.

mysql , Apache , perl all have been built from source (for .

I am the admin of the box , this is more or less used by me alone ,
not many people have  access let alone root access.

Solaris box has two network cards , one is not used another has IP
assigned by our corporate DHCP server.

our corporate DHCP  server always assigns the same IP ( 172.18.33.58 )
based on MAC address.

This has been going on for the last few years without any issue.

Last Friday our box mysteriously tried to assign itself the IP of our
network gateway ( 172.18.32.1 ) and succeeded.

The result was almost a catastrophe , our entire office network was
down and for well over 3hrs no one knew what was happening.


when corporate team found out they immediately pulled the network plug
, my server was out of network and our office network was back to
normal.

my server logs indeed confirm server took the gateways IP .

How can this happen , if this behaviour is acceptable can any one
running *inx assign some arbitrary IP and bring the server / network
down.

 Can I assign myself IP of my internet proxy and prevent everyone from
accessing network. The whole idea looks scary .

I have reproduced portions of dmesg here

--------------dmesg logs -----------------

All along i was thinking if there is a duplicate IP in network , the
machine that tried to assign the existing IP  will fail. In this case
gateway failed and my box succeeded.

It should have been other way round, my server should have failed ,
gateway box should have continued with the same IP.

Am I missing something here ?

hi,
Any system can take any ip. But it is illegal to use another's ip.
The control, allowing only certain ip's, is generally done by the network
not by the system.This is how IP is designed.
Windows though detects other machines with same ip and informs you. Linux
doesnt care.
I cannot exactly tell you what the problem is, without more info.
It could be due to your DHCP server, assigning a already used ip (may be the
gateway was down at that time).
Or some1 assigned static ip to u r sys ( only u have access, so not possible
).

Hi list,

I am pasting pradeepto's mail to foss.in . It will help the aspiring KDE
contributors :)

---

Foss.in and Geodesic would be sponsoring a KDE Hackathon [
Bangalore, 11-13th July ]. Some details here[1]. We plan to hack on
our favorite projects during the event. Thought that I should inform
the list as well. Thanks, team@foss.in <team%40foss.in>.

Here is a mini-HOWTO to avoid this problem.

 1. Ensure that your DHCP server does *not* give dynamic IP addresses
 to your servers. Separate the dynamic address range from the server
 address range (for example, using a netmask) and use only the former
 for DHCP addresses.

 2. Run "arpwatch" on some server (for example the DHCP server). This
 maintains a table matching IP addresses to MAC addresses and warns you
 whenever there is a change. You can specifically exclude some
 address ranges like the DHCP address range.

 3. Set up a static table of MAC/IP pairs for all your servers and
 publish this table using LDAP/NIS. Make sure the clients use LDAP/NIS
 to pick up this data and feed it into their arp table as "permanent"
 data.

What these steps will do:
 1. Ensure that your DHCP server will not "give away" one of your
 server addresses.
 2. Ensure that you will receive a warning as soon as some machine
 assumes the IP address of a server.
 3. Ensure that all clients will send packets to the correct MAC
 address when they want to sent packets to a server IP.

As a consequence you will be protected against _accidental_ IP take
overs. To guard against _hostile_ IP take overs you need some kind of
encryption and authentication for the data.

=============================

tee - Read from stdin and write to stdout and files

Summary : 

Tee will copy the stdin to file(s) and also to stdout output. 
Actually tee is doing the redirection. The following  ASCII 
art(!) will shows "How Tee works".

STDIN >---+---> STDOUT
          |
          |
          |
          V 
        File(s)

Examples :

$ tee   -- Read from stdin and write into stdout.

$ tee f1 f2 -- Read from stdin and write into stdout, f1 & f2.

$ tee -i myfile -- Same as above. But it will ignore the interrupt 
                   signals (Ex: ctrl+C).

$ tee -a myfile -- Read from stdin and write into stdout & append 
                   to myfile.

$ who | tee myfile -- Store the output of who to myfile and also 
                      write to stdout.

$ ls -1 | tee f1 f2 | wc -l -- Store the ls output in f1, f2 and 
                           write the count of all files on stdout.

NOTE:
STDIN  - Standard Input  - Keyboard
STDOUT - Standard Output - Screen

Read : man tee

Nearly all enterprise networking switches can easily counter such attacks
using DHCP Snooping, IP Source Guard, etc.

> Talk 1: Brief intro to Deb Packages and the Release cycle:
 Speaker: Kapil Hari Paranjape, Debian Developer
Duration: ~30mins

Debian GNU/Linux has a fairly complicated release process, with
packages first entering unstable, then moving to testing and, finally,
testing becomes stable. How do packages actually make their way
through this path? Also, what's the weirdness with these Toy Story
characters? This talk will attempt to answer these questions with the
following:

- How a package enters Debian, and a description of unstable
- Building packages for various architectures
- The transition from unstable to testing: how dependency based
  transitions are resolved, rules for transition.
- Freeze and stable
- Updates to stable

> Talk 2: Software Porting
 Speaker: Narendra Babu, HP India.
Duration: ~45mins

This talk focuses on the basic issues raises during:
a) Porting between X OS and Y OS
b) Porting between 32bit and 64bit
c) Porting between different processors
d) How to write porting friendly code?

> Talk 3: VRRP 
 Speaker: Bharathi Subramanian, Midas
Duration: ~30mis

This talk cover the basic and implementation details of the Virtual 
Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) and its use in a LAN Env.

Summary : 

`seq' prints the numbers from Start to End in steps.  By default,
Start and Step are 1, and by default each number is separated by 
a new line. All numbers can be reals, not just integers.

Examples :

$ seq 6 -- Print Nos from 1 to 6.

$ seq 2 6 -- Print Nos from 2 to 6.

$ seq .1 .5 10 -- Real numbers with factional step value 0.1. 

$ seq 10 100 10000 -- Print Nos from 10 to 10K with step value 100.

$ seq -w 10 100 10000 -- All Nos are printed equal width.

$ seq -s' ' 1 2 10 -- Each number is separated by SPACE.

$ seq -f %1.f 1000000 1000001 -- Print Nos with no exponent and no 
                                 decimal point.

$ seq -f %e 1 5 -- Print Nos with exponent and decimal point.

Note: 
1) Fractional increment may NOT end with END value.

/** What about Job Opportunities for PHP in Enterprise Organizations? **
I am working in an MNC, and i am working on Wordpress..  We implemented
wordpress multi user in our company, and my career was based on it for the
past two years..  and believe it, out of all internal portals, the blog
portal is heavy success..

When i started with wordpress it was nightly build version of Multi user
version.. and due its success, we are now working on porting the code to
latest version.. (we had lot of customizations done here)..

So, its not just PHP.. we have to complete the lifecylce..  i mean, the LAMP
Administration, Linux Commands, if possible Unix Shell Scripting, and some
practical knowledge like backup mechanism, etc..

Definitely these skills will help in getting job in an MNC..

More than PHP, i feel, knowledge on Open Source software would be the best
job opportunity..

Senthil

Hi Senthil,

I think I know what you are talking about. I agree that "our company"
has "some" operations. But how many are customer facing? Out of the
1000s what % would be FOSS? Just curious.

Sorry for being pessimistic, The consulting companies do what it gets
to get paid by the customers. The internal blogging and stuff are not
customer rewarding, and so it has been built on PHP. But Knowledge
Management portals can win projects (a similar implementation at a
client site would be a good example), so we got some of our KM tool in
MS Sharepoint. We (including me) do a lot of POCs on open source stuff
but when the customer asks for a particular product, we use the
equivalent of the OSS stuff

PHP will aid in getting a seat into a company which has a lot of job
openings. So will any programming skill as a fresher. The more
programs you have written, the better. It would be better if you have
worked on larger programs instead of a many smaller ones. The "Unix"
experience is of course valued highly at many places. But if you want
to stick to OSS, be prepared not to work for such consulting
companies,but concentrate on some others.


with regards,
Natarajan

congratulations - keep it up. One small point, I notice you are using  
a vsnl mail address - and possibly yahoo and gmail. To be taken  
seriously, you should have your own domain and your mail ids should  
be mail@yourdomain. I personally would hesitate to deal with an OSS  
company that does not have it's own mailserver.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0807110915510.4719-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

"No Software Patents!" -- Allowing patents over software ideas will
seriously affect the creativity, productivity and freedom of all.
Link: http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

fold -- Wrap each input line to fit in specified width.

Summary :

`fold' wrap input lines in each input file and writes the output to
standard output. `fold' counts screen columns by default.

Examples :

$ fold myfile -- Fold each input line at column 80 and print in the
                 screen/stdout.

$ fold -w 40 myfile > myfile1 -- Fold each input line at column 40 and
                                 the output is redirected to myfile1.

$ fold -s -w40 f1 f2 -- Fold each input line of f1 and f2 at column 40
                        and folding will happen at space only.

$ fold -b 40 myfile -- Folds at 40th byte place.

$ fold -c 40 myfile -- Folds at 40th character position.


Note:
1) Normally all the above options will give same output. Difference
can be felt only with multi-byte encodings, like UTF-8...

2) A tab may count more than one column, backspace decreases the
column count, and carriage return sets the column to zero.

Read : man fold

I agree..  however, still there are customer facing projects ..  i also
worked on another customer project implementing oscommerce .
I heard a couple of other projects like drupal etc for the customer project.

There are also some client projects on Movable Type Blogging software too.

The quantity is too low, compared to commercail products.

Generally, i encourage students to learn a technology in its complete life
cycle..  ie, if one opts to learn PHP, then apache, mysql, webdesigning like
HTML, CSS, GIMP .. all comes in to the loop..

There are lot of freelance projects, particularly on social networking one..

One of my friend is working exclusively on implementing opentaps for his
customer..

I feel, when techies of open source raise above programming and concentrate
on architecture, we can certainly match commercial vendors..

Subject: [Ilugc] Need some help with routing on a WA1003A
Message-ID: <3c52da3c0807110543v3e85c655s14d24b1aa8859b1b@mail.gmail.com>

(Depending on the solution you provide this may or may not be OT :-) )

Right, I've moved to Mumbai and have a Reliance broadband connection.
They have brought an ethernet cable upto my house (I don't need a
router/modem, although they have provided some form of router/splitter
to use the telephone + plus two LAN connections over this same cable)

Now: I need to type in a username/password everytime I log in (not
PPPoE! For instance I type http://www.google.com, and it shows me a
reliance broadnet login page, like what we see at airports)

Now I'm trying to use wireless on this same connection: I can plug in
the ethernet to my old WA1003A router (from my old BSNL connection),
and turn off its DHCP server. And I can connect wirelessly to the WAN.
But now my laptop and my desktop (connected via ethernet) have
different IP addresses on the WAN (basically the WA1003A acts as a
router.. so the desktop and laptop get IP addresses from the WAN's
DHCP server)

And, two different IP addresses on this WAN, cannot use the same
reliance login at the same time! This is my problem currently.

My present solution was to use iptables on my desktop, and set my
laptop to route through it. This is an overkill since I'm now leaving
my desktop on for 24hrs. I would like to use iptables on my WA1003A
instead, and make that act as a gateway --- so that both my desktop
and laptop will have the same IP address on the WAN. And so that both
machines only depend on the WA1003A.

Well, how do I go about this? (for any router, not necessarily
WA1003A. I am ready to buy another router to achieve this. Although
should not happen that I buy a new router and have the same issues.)
My WA1003A has a small linux busybox shell, which has "iptables,"
"ifconfig," etc. But I don't know if it is possible to save any
changes to its filesystem (well, it should be, because it *can* save
settings information from the web-administration app). The web-app
allows me to create the following types of "connections" : PPPoE,
PPPoA, Bridge, Static, DHCP, CLIP. I tried DHCP, but it did not seem
to be getting an IP address from the WAN. I could try using iptables,
but I can't get the device to get an IP for itself (there doesn't seem
to be an equivalent of dhclient on the busybox shell :/ )

 Speaker: Kapil Hari Paranjape, Debian Developer
Duration: ~30mins

Debian GNU/Linux has a fairly complicated release process, with
packages first entering unstable, then moving to testing and, finally,
testing becomes stable. How do packages actually make their way
through this path? Also, what's the weirdness with these Toy Story
characters? This talk will attempt to answer these questions with the
following:

- How a package enters Debian, and a description of unstable
- Building packages for various architectures
- The transition from unstable to testing: how dependency based
  transitions are resolved, rules for transition.
- Freeze and stable
- Updates to stable

> Talk 2: Software Porting
 Speaker: Narendra Babu, HP India.
Duration: ~45mins

This talk focuses on the basic issues raises during:
a) Porting between X OS and Y OS
b) Porting between 32bit and 64bit
c) Porting between different processors
d) How to write porting friendly code?

> Talk 3: VRRP 
 Speaker: Bharathi Subramanian, Midas
Duration: ~30mis

This talk cover the basic and implementation details of the Virtual 
Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) and its use in a LAN Env.

I don't know the feature set of WA1003A. But try this,

1. Make WA1003A to get the IP thru DHCP from WAN.
2. Enable DHCP Server in WA1003A.
3. Get the PC/Lapi IP from this local DHCP Server.
4. WA1003A has to NAT the local IP.

HTH :)

I'm not able to do this step :( I too think the rest should be do-able
once I get past this.

And now was able to do this, but I was wrong about the rest. :)
There was a command "udhcpc" after telnet-ing to the router.

So, I get an IP, and I get a route ... yet I can't ping the gateway.
The same process works if I connect the ethernet directly to my laptop
instead of the router. Am I missing anything here?

The talk _will_ be about Debian and about the release process
but more about how we as users can be involved in this process rather
than the naming conventions.

The abstract you gave was probably the one Kumar gave you and I was
too lazy to correct it!

I hope that is OK. Enclosed is an updated abstract.

Regards,

Kapil.

Debian: The system that you grow along with

Debian has users at various levels, entry level users, debian
administrators, package maintainers and developers. Each of them can
benefit from and contribute to Debian. Each release of Debian has
a special meaning and relationship with each of these classes of
users. The talk will explain how one can progressively learn more
from and give more to Debian.

I only know the appropriate phrase in Hindi so Tamil speaking people
should correct me:

I have been trying to play one usb webcam in Ubuntu 8.04. Model: A4tech
PK130MG.
My *lsusb* show this:

Bus 005 Device 002: ID 0ac8:0328 Z-Star Microelectronics Corp.

Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:000

I loaded *gspca*, */dev/video0*

I tried with 1.cheese 2.ekiga 3.gqcom 4.camorama

But, one error came all the time:

*/dev/video: No such file or directory

couldnot connect to video device /dev/video0*

What should i do now? I googled a lot, but didn`t find proper help page.

I think you don't have the driver for the webcam. Maybe you can try this:

I don't know if anyone has worked on it, but if you can translate
about 50 strings and make kdebase from 74.47 to 75% Tamil will be
released with KDE 4.1

There was a release titled "Kelunga Maamiyaare, neengalum marumagal
thaan" which roughly works out to an equivalent meaning ("Saas bhi
bahu hai" though). :-)

it was with Kde 4.1 Beta[1]. Off late additions caused the deficiency. I

try installing "ubuntu-restricted-extras" (too much indeed for too small a
requirement ;-)) package, and try playing the file.

else mplayer is a good alternative.

Looks like Reliance is using a Captive Portal for authentication.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal

Unless you authenticate through the captive portal, you'll be
firewalled out of the web.

So try logging in through your browser first, and then try
pinging the gateway or other hosts.

The problem is I can't connect multiple machines (laptop+desktop) at
the same time, because both machines get different IP addresses, and I
can make only one login at the same time.

So I'm using my desktop as a gateway with NAT, what I was hoping for
was to do the same with my router instead... so that I don't need to
keep my desktop on for using my laptop.

Follow Bharati's original suggestion of enabling NAT on your router and
hide all your machines behind it.

Captive portal's only depend on the MAC and/or IP.  So if you NAT
on your own router, and login on the web form through your wifi laptop,
the captive portal is none the wiser.  So long as any single machine
in your LAN has passed the captive portal, your entire LAN will have
unrestricted web access.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

fmt -- Simple optimal text ForMatTer

Summary :

`fmt' reads from the specified file arguments or stdin, and writes 
to stdout(display).

Examples :

$ fmt myfile -- Format myfile and max line length is 75.

$ fmt f1 f2  -- Format f1 f2  and max line length is 75.

$ fmt -w 60 f1 f2 -- Same as above but max line length is 60.

$ fmt -s myfile -- Don't split the small line. Useful if your file 
                   contains some sample program codes.

$ fmt -u myfile -- Uniform spacing. One space between words. Two space 
                   between sentences.

$ fmt -p BB myfile -- Only lines beginning with BB will be formatted.

$ fmt -t myfile -- Paragraph indentation will be preserved.

Note: By default, blank lines, spaces between words, and indentation
are preserved in the output; successive input lines with different
indentation are not joined; tabs are expanded on input and introduced
on output.

Read : man fmt

Hi,

I have a repository with trunk and branches. This runs under https. I  
have several people who have commit right to everythig. I wanted to  
give a person commit rights only to one branch. My authfile is like  
this:

main-devels=a,b,c
branch-devels=d

[myrepo:/]
@main-devels=rw
* = r

[myrepo:/branches/mybranch/]
@branch-devels=rw
*=r

but d is getting forbidden when he tries to commit. What's wrong here?

Can you specify the branch without specifying '/' in the end? I think
i faced this problem before and this solution seem to fix the issue.
Your configuration file should look like this:
main-devels=a,b,c
branch-devels=d

[myrepo:/]
@main-devels=rw
* = r

[myrepo:/branches/mybranch]
@branch-devels=rw
*=r

Ensure that you are not running multiple instances of firefox.  Use
"ps auxww" in a terminal to list all running process and check output.

Try starting firefox in safe mode without any plugins enabled.  Run
"firefox -safe-mode" from your shell prompt.

If safe mode does not work, move your profile folder ~/.mozilla/firefox/
temporarily to another location and then start firefox.


FF2 is a memory hog.  My FF2 instances used to take ~1.5GB
of RAM.  I have plenty of plugins, ajax apps, several tabs open
and almost never shutdown my computer or close FF for days
on end.  Restarting firefox usually cures the RAM usage.

FF3 is much better and even after a week of browsing, it only
consumes ~512MB of RAM.

There are some tweaks that can help reduce FF RAM usage,
but I have not explored any of them.  Google is your friend.

Even if I give correct password, the prompt for password continues again and
again.  Kindly help me to know what I am missing.   Nothing is printed in the
apache error log also.  


The following are the configuration details in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
<Directory  /var/www/svn>

# Enable Subversion
  DAV svn

# Directory containing all repository for this path
  SVNParentPath /absolute/path/to/directory/containing/your/repositories

# LDAP Authentication & Authorization is final; do not check other databases
AuthzLDAPAuthoritative off

# Do basic password authentication in the clear
  AuthType Basic

# The name of the protected area or "realm"
  AuthName "Your Subversion Repository"

# Active Directory requires an authenticating DN to access records
# This is the DN used to bind to the directory service
# This is an Active Directory user account
AuthLDAPBindDN "uid=user_name,ou=People,dc=bksys,dc=co,dc=in"

# This is the password for the AuthLDAPBindDN user in Active Directory
AuthLDAPBindPassword "user_password"


# The LDAP query URL
# Format: scheme://host:port/basedn?attribute?scope?filter
# The URL below will search for all objects recursively below the basedn
# and validate against the sAMAccountName attribute
AuthLDAPURL
"ldap://ldapIPaddress/ou=People,dc=bksys,dc=co,dc=in?uid?sub?(objectClass=*)"

# Require authentication for this Location
  Require valid-user

If it prompts for password again it was clear that the password does
not match with the one stored in the authenticator. Please refer to
following directives and verify if you need to use them in your
configuration:

  AuthBasicProvider
  AuthLDAPEnabled

In addition, verify the apache version you use. If it is apache 2.2,
please be aware that the module mod_auth_ldap has been renamed as
mod_authnz_ldap. See if you have to use any other directives specific
to this version.

You can refer to following links and see if it helps:
  http://blogs.open.collab.net/svn/2007/03/subversion_ldap.html
  http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2004-10/1567.shtml
  http://subversion.open.collab.net/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=3&dsMessageId=286

Also do not miss to see the error_log file which may have an interesting clue.

> # LDAP Authentication & Authorization is final; do not check other databases
> AuthzLDAPAuthoritative off

If this is off and if userid/passwd not exists in LDAP, the
authentication would fall back to passwd based authentication.

This is a valid concern.. however, i ordered a laptop, because of the trust

Hi,

We shall use 'dd' command

"dd if=/dev/sda3 of=/dev/sda5"

then edit grub....i think this should work.

Otherwise we can also use "cp -rvfp source-partition destination partition"
then edit grub and boot.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

top -- Display TOP Intensive processes

Summary :

TOP provides an ongoing look at processor activity in real time. TOP
list the process, which is sorted based on the CPU usage of the each
task on the system. It can also sort the tasks by memory usage & run
time.

Examples :

$ top -- List the most CPU-Intensive processes.

$ top -q -- Runs with the highest possible priority.

$ top -d 6 -- List will be updated every 6 Sec.

$ top -n 5 -- Update the list for 5 times and then exit.

$ top -p 100 -p 200 -- Monitor only process with PID 100 & 200.
                       Maximum 20 processes can be monitored.

$ top -s -- Run in secure mode (Disables the potentially dangerous
            interactive commands).

$ top -c -- List the process with command line options instead of the
            command name only (default).

$ top -b -n 5 > myfile -- Run in Batch mode & dump the output in myfile. 
                
NOTE: 

1) Batch Mode is useful for sending output from top to other programs
or to a file. It runs until it produces the number of iterations
requested with the n option or until killed.

2) TOP supports few interactive commands to change the output formats 
like changing update time and few actions like killing a process.

Read : man top

HTH :)

        Yes I am using the Apache2.2 with mod_authnz_ldap, the only difference i
found was AuthzLDAPAuthoritative variable.

        I have made it 'on', even then no change.

My current configuration in httpd.conf:
        AuthBasicProvider ldap

        AuthName "Your Subversion Repository"

This is not a very good idea as all kinds of blocks of zeroes will be
copied.

As far as copying the data is concerned using cp is a much better
idea, still, using cpio is to be preferred as the links would
also be preserved (symbolic as well as hard links).

Moreover, some other things have to be taken care of. For
example, the /etc/fstab would typically be different.

Hi,

One approach would be read the HTML using rubyful soup/ hpricot  and
process(things like striping the html tags) them and then with
PDF::Writer you can write the contents to a pdf file.

kill -- Sends a signal to processes.

Summary :

The command kill sends the specified signal to the specified process
or process group.  If no signal is specified, the TERM signal is sent.
Signals are used for inter process communications. Two kill commands
are available. One is built-in SHELL (default) and 2nd is in
/usr/bin/kill.

Examples :

$ kill -l -- Print a list of signal names with numbers.

$ kill -l SIGIO -- Print the number for SIGIO signal.

$ kill -l 9 -- Print the Name for the Signal number 9.

$ kill 100 200 -- Send TERM signal to processes with PID 100 and 200.

$ kill -s 9 100 -- Send KILL signal to process with PID 100.

$ kill -n SIGKILL 100 -- Same as above

$ kill -SIGKILL 100 -- Same as above.

$ kill -9 100 -- Same as above. We can use either Signal Name 
                 (SIGKILL) or Number(9).

$ kill -9 -1 -- Kill all your login sessions. But Not the current one.

NOTE: Kill is a shell builtin for 2 reasons: it allows job IDs to be
used instead of process IDs, and, if you have reached the limit on
processes that you can create, you don't have to start a process to
kill another one.

Read : man kill, signal(7)

I think cpio has a limitation of 8GB, but I could be wrong. pax can be
used instead of cpio.

Yes, you will most likely have to update /etc/fstab with the partition
information as the disk geometry will differ.

$ ps -h -- Same as above. But with-out header.

$ ps -ux -- Show all processes owned by you.

$ ps -U bharathi -- Show all processes owned by bharathi.

$ pc -C bash -- Show all process with name bash.

$ ps -C syslogd -o pid=  -- Print PID of syslogd.

$ ps -aux -- Show all processes including daemons (without tty)  with
             username or UID.

$ ps -jx --sort=uid,-pid -- All processes will list in ascending order 
            of UID and each users process will sorted descending order.

$ ps -o start,time,etime -p 100 -- Show the current status of the

Quoting from the website,

"PHOENIX: Physics with Homemade Equipment and Innovative Experiments

Phoenix is developed using Free Software tools and distributed under GNU GPL.

The basic design of Phoenix is well documented and a set of
experiments have been developed. To make it really useful , we need
more number of experiments. It should come from the academic
community. As per the suggetions from the governing council, IUAC is
announcing some prizes for developing new experiments.

The experiment submitted should be usable as a 2 to 3 hour lab
experiment at Degree / PG level , having some amount of data analysis
involved. The cost of  sensors etc. to be added to the basic Phoenix
box should  be reasonable. . . . . . . "

In my first post, I was trying a xinerama setup using a laptop with it's ?
onboard Intel graphics chip; display 0 the DFP of the laptop and display 
1 monitor connected to the VGA port.

We got the setup to work halfway, the 
display would come up on the main monitor stating low memory 
issue. ?We changed the res. to 800x600 but still it would not work. ?
The system bios was allocating a fixed 8M memory - not 
dynamic/changeable.

We then decided to use a dual port video card with it's own memory. ?
Installed a NVidia dual port card GEForce 8600 GT (512 MB RAM) on a 
desktop. ?Installed the NVidia binary drivers, they also 
provide a config utility nvidia-settings. ?Using the util, we were able 
to get a TwinView setup. ?Required a couple of hand edit tweaking in 
the xorg.conf

I also got this as a reference from one of the ILUG-Mumbai member.

Can anyone help me with the information about where I can get a SUSE Linux

Bit confused. Are you talking about Twin Display (What is see in 
laptop screen and external screen is same) or Xinerama (combine both 
screens into single big screen)?

To the best of my knowledge ELCOT uses Novell/SuSE Linux Enterprise 
Desktop (SLED).  SLED is not free.

However, openSUSE (Novell's community version) is free check out 
www.opensuse.org.  

I would suggest that you evaluate a couple of distros before deciding on 
one.  A lot of folks have tried Ubuntu desktop (www.ubuntu.com) and are 
quite happy with it.  Fedora (community version from Redhat), Mandriva 
(www.mandriva.org) are other options.

Xinerama with two or more monitors is ok. But with laptop + monitor,
i feel, it may look ugly. How to you feel? Is there any specific use?

Agree that the "total" display would look incongrous.  The objective was 
to demo "proof of concept"   

As I said in my follow up post, we used a dual port video card with 
dedicated memory and two LCD panels (same make/size resolution 1440x900 
each).  It was very impressive.  The only thing we did not like was the 
sides of each LCD panel breaking up the continuity of the image but you 
get more real estate.  For example, it is a great setup for video 
editing (Cinelerra), the various windows can be positioned in one of 
the 2 screens.

I haven't tried it myself, but I for one would love to have two compiz
workspaces on different screens (laptop+monitor). Very useful while
using a projector. I remember trying unsuccessfully long back..

I dont intend a flame. I prefer Ruby's way over Py's way. But it looks like
though Ruby was surging forward near 2007, there are many projects in
rubyforge et al. that are outdated. Half the bindings seem half done. Some
are inexistent. Though I absolutely love the "Ruby Way", is it finally gonna
be what perl and py are for the *nix world? I know rails is a holy grail,
but what happens Ruby by itself?

Many projects have built in python bindings now while Ruby is left to
catchup. Is it wise to delve more into ruby or start afresh at py?

Thanks,

Ash

Would it be difficult to get into Python Programming, after knowing Ruby? 

I think, it might not be difficult for you to start with Python. Python being conceptualized by a mathematician, might have a better value. 

If you plan to contribute to FOSS projects, python, afaik, could be a great plus. :) (IMO)

You have run into the other side of the network effect. No matter how 
well designed your ideal language might be, if it doesn't have things 
like bindings for the popular libraries, you are usually better off with 
the more popular ones not just because they are popular, they also tend 
to be convenient for interacting with the rest of the world.

I have to use an Enterprise Resource Planning software for one of my
friend`s textile factory. It will nice enough if it is open source & free.
What do you think? Which one should we use? Here, i want to add that, this
software must have a very easy user interface.

So, friends, which one do you suggest me to use?

Since you do not have a separate /var and /tmp it is likely that /var
or /tmp is full of stuff which you do not need. Otherwise, I find it
difficult to understand how 14G can be used by an installation of
Ubuntu (or any other distribution for that matter!).

However, this does not mean that you can go around deleting stuff
from /var or /tmp indiscriminately.

Check "du -ksh /tmp /var/tmp". If these are large then you might
want to install "tmpreaper" to clean these areas out systematically.

Check whether and with what frequency you are rotating your logs in
/var/log. If you do not already have "logrotate" then install it.
If you already have "logrotate" then see if the frequency of
rotation or the number of logs kept matches your needs.

If you have large databases or other stuff in "/var" then you
might want to put them on a different partition than "/". It looks like
"/home" is only partially used so you could do any of the following:

	a. Create a symbolic link to push the directory containing
	the database to "/home"
	b. "bind" mount the directory containing the database from
	"/home".
	c. resize "/home" in order to create some space for a new
	partition for the database.

By the way, waiting until you reach "96%" is not a good idea. You
should really have started thinking about this when you were at
"85%"!

Regards,

Kapil.

We used a PCI card; one VGA and one DVI port.  The MRP on the box was 
Rs. 5600, don't what the client paid to the vendor.  The card was 
ordered in a hurry so we accepted whatever was on his shelf.

I am sure PCI-xpress versions with dual DVI ports are available at add'l 
cost.  Ideally, I prefer this 'coz most LCD panels today come with 
DVI/VGA ports, using the DVI ports gives a brighter and sharper image 
(my experience)

ERP is a complex beast.  Whichever package you use, you will have to 
understand it thoroughly.  Understand your client's business process, 
map it to the application and give your client proper training o/w 
forget it.

> So, friends, which one do you suggest me to use?

Most of the open source ERP packages have a western slant to them given 
that their contributors are from the west.  The accounting modules will 
not be suitable to "Tally" minded audience.

There is a plethora:
1. TinyERP (Python)
2. OpenBravo (Java)
3. OpenTaps
4. Apace Open for Business Project <http://ofbiz.apache.org>
5. WebERP
...

Choice of the platform depends on the vertical market.

Message-ID: <d5c9fe000807182219l4642dfealddd4b202621ccc0c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Am facing a installation problem in Debian Lenny Beta 2. I downloaded
the dvd version and when I tried to install it in my pc, the cdrom
drive(LG DVD writer) is not getting detected. The installation is
failing in the step,  "Detect and Mount CD-ROM."

I googled and found that I could pass kernel parameters libata=1 or
libata.atapi_enabled=1 to over come the issue. But even after giving
the parameters I got the same errors. I guess the problem would not be
uncommon, can some one give a solution for this

thanks,
siva.

Hi,

It is better if you go for Openbravo. (Compiere is not very active now and
it is being pushed in a different name also called Adampiere.) Openbravo is
conducting some training sessions also and oflate there is lot of push by
these people.

One thing you could try is generic.all_generic_ide=1. This worked for
one case, which I recall, having a DVD writer which didn't work with
newer kernels, though I am not very sure if it is the same problem.

Dear LUGs,
                I have an 2 GB pen drive. Pen drive is ext3 file system. I
used it in Ubuntu 7.10, RHEL4 Puppy linux 3 and Mandriva. In my experience,
i wish to expose some steps to be followed.

1. Use our pen drive in normal user instead of root for safe operation.
2. For copying files, first mount your pen drive with R/W permission. (
Ubuntu auto mount the device with read only permission.
3. Use only commands to copy files.It is easy to terminate the process in
middle. In GUI mode, some times file system get corrupted.
4. Never make to change file permissions of files available in pen drive.
this makes the file as read only and unable to edit.
5. make proper mounting and unmounting when using the drive.

               All are requested to share thier experiences.

N.Padmanathan,
Ooty.

in KDE under Mandriva/Sabayon
1. insert pen drive
2. window pops up asking if new medium to be opened in new window
3. konq window opens up and you can treat it as a normal drive and do  
whatever you want with it

sabayon opens it as /media/disk

*If* you are booting from the machine where the DVD image is on the
hard disk, then the installer has the option of looking for this image on
the disk.

Thanks for your write-up. I agree with most of your points.

What is the precise problem? If there is some problem with the way
your GUI (Nautilus?) copies files then this is a bug and needs to be
fixed.

Can't you just change the permissions back when you need to?

Also give the output of
du --si --max-depth 1 /
This will show us which are the directories which are using up most space.
And have you cleaned your system of unwanted logs, packages and stuff?

That only supports HTML, shows HTML static files and we pick out  
tables for insertion. You need to know the exact table structure.  
Cannot pick and choose values from cells. All or none in the table is  
the choice. It does not support web services that return strings. E.g  
quotes from Yahoo.

That is pretty strange. Can you give some examples? Though Ruby is a 
very cool language in itself, you have to understand that Ruby got so 
popular mostly because of Rails. So the engine that chugs Ruby 
development forward, comes from the web. So sure, you might not find 
mature bindings like PyGTK in ruby (but things are improving fast... 
there are several new options already - check out _why's Shoes). So, 
it's just a matter of time.

But when it comes to libraries that are useful for dealing with web 
development, I would bet that Ruby's offerings are as good as, in some 
cases better than what Python's have to offer. Don't take my word for 
it. Try to build something in Ruby and tell us what are the problems you 
faced. That is the only real way to know.

You can read all the flames that will follow until the cows come home, 
and you'll be no wiser. Try something. Ask specific questions. And I'm a 
little suspicious about the way you put the question - it's always wise 
to delve into _any_ language - provided you're looking at it for the 
right reasons. Even if you decide to drop it in the end, you would have 
learned valuable lessons. So, what are you trying to do?

Forgive my ignorance, but why would one require PyGTK in Ruby?

This is pretty much standard now.  When you pop in the drive Gnome/KDE 
pop up file managers with the drive mount on /media/<something>.

I use the native fs on pen drives (vfat) for interoperability with other 
desktops.  Have not run into this issue.

Cannot enforce this on "average" users like office staff.   They are

I think this is related to 2 and 3 above.  Not sure what you mean here.

Agree, should be done on *all* desktops for fs integrity.

6. Disable autorun for all removable media types.  (how to do this?)

Recently, I helped a colleague to create a PDF version of his OO 
presentation so that he could give his talk at a workshop (OO version 
at workshop premise was 1.x and would not open his 2.x file).  He 
warned me that the pen drive had been hooked up to promiscous desktops.  
Upon insertion, Ubuntu presented the file manager.  I believe there was 
an autorun.inf which copied a whole bunch of <directory>.exe in my home 
directory.  It was like Whoa!  The point is that some of the virii have 
started recognizing a Linux desktop and use Linux utils to install 
themselves.  Fortunately, they were windows exe and I removed them.

I believe XFCE does it too. And for other window managers, you could
use ivman to achieve the same.

Was the desktop running wine? There's this thread going on, on
ubuntuforums, where people have managed to get windows virus to work
upto variable extents using wine.

agreed:
1 case of beer
python and ruby webdev libraries and resources to be put up in a wiki
Raman (a perl guy) to be the judge.

If you accept the bet I will set up the wiki page and we can go ahead

I was there - strangely enough my usb drive (a used one given to me  
by my company) did the same thing on my mac - copied Documents and  
Desktop as exe files

Yes, and so does KDE.

No wine.  But the fact that it was able to create dirs and install 
some .exe files is scary.  It could have well installed some other 
script that could have removed dirs/files in my home dir.

and hence the problem with product development. We have forgotten the
latency times. *Every* context switch(read 'microsecond') consumes time. We
talk about scalability issues , but we notice latency times only when GOOG
replies back with the hit-list after 'n' seconds. (i did not venture into Py
vs Ruby debate here, but having Ruby bindings for Py)

Ruby and Py (and for that matter any language) is good in its own way. A
good artist is more keen on what he paints rather than the brushes to be
used - though the choice of the brush does have an effect here.

and... I would rather use the beer can to hold my brushes :)

Sorry Kenneth, I don't drink and I have better things to do. Just like I 
said in my previous mail - I don't think a flame war or blow-by-blow 
wiki challenge can convince anybody to take up a particular language or 
web framework. There is no 'best' solution to all sets of problems - you 
choose your language or framework based on your needs.

That is why I was asking the OP what he was trying to do. I think 
solving his problem is more important than trying to prove which is a 
better language. Which I think is rather pointless anyways. Some 
languages are good for doing some things. Others not. It's up to you to 
make that decision.

various places which is in my control. To handle pen drive i use Puppy Linux
( In mini-cd). I experienced that the file copied in RHEL4 machine can't
edited in ubuntu.then i changed the file permission in ubuntu. after some
time, when i access the file in RHEL4, the file owner displayed as 999 (
using ls -l). The same thing happen when i use the ubuntu live CD in RHEL4
machine. I aready posted the above occurence in the list.Hence i told that
never change the file permissions.

Agreed. All I'm saying is what brushes you need depends heavily on what

If you have a sata dvd drive on a very new chipset, you'll need a
newer kernel with the correct drivers enabled. I had similar problems
installing Debian on a Dell R200 server. In the end, I had to install
by booting using a custom kernel.

this is not about which is the best  language - i agree with you  
there - each to his own choice. This is about a specific statement  
you made that ruby has more and better web resources than python has.  
This is not a question of opinion - which would lead to a flame, but

Sir,
     In my office, Acer altos G540 Server was purchased. specification is,
processor: Intel Dual-Core Xeon 5110 / 1.6 GHz, Dual-Core, 64 bit computing,
RAM: 1 GB, DDR II SDRAM, 1 x Serial Attached SCSI - integrated HHD.

I tried to install RHEL4 for making Oracle Database server. but RHEL4 will
not detect SCSI HHD.

Please tell me an alternate linux OS to install.

Padhu,

Huh? here's what I said:

"I would bet that Ruby's offerings are as good as, in some cases better 
than what Python's have to offer."

They don't sound the same to me. But if you insist, why not. The list 
will be crazy long (and pointless) if we concentrate on all the 
web-related libraries. Let the OP state his problem, and we will list 
what libraries are relevant to his problem.

The issue is that files copied on a system A by user a are marked
with the user-id of user a rather than the user name.

If the files are then seen on system B where the user a has a
different user-id then that user cannot easily access the files.

One solution is to use a file sysem like FAT/VFAT that does not care
about user id[*]. However, long file names can occasionally cause
problems if this is not mounted correctly. There are other issues like
fragmentation as well.

When you want to copy files with permissions and other attributes use
an archive like tar.gz or tar.bz2 or a loop device.

Another solution using ext2/3 etc. is to mark all files/directories on
the portable medium as world readable/writable. Perhaps that is what
you meant.

Regards,

Kapil.

[*] I feel some reluctance in suggesting this old FS but it is the
only one which was _designed_ with floppies in mind! So it works well
with portable media.

Is this RHEL 4 base or updates ? In case it is anything above RHEL4

Additionally, you may also want to check up hardware.redhat.com to see

Your problem is a system that is much newer than RHEL4.  RHEL4 most 
likely does not have the drivers for the SAS chip.  You could either 
provide binary blob of the drivers during install process or upgrade to 
latest RHEL or try CentOS 5.2 (equivalent of RHEL5.2) in case you want 
to retain RHEL compatability with other packages.

The issue is not about file permission but ownership.  Please read up on 
uid/gid and their mappings to "string" names.  AFAIK, file ownerships 
is identified by uid/gid.  These could be different on different 
machines for the same "string" name.  You need to write a small shell 
script to restore ownership when you move the pen drive across systems.

Dear Luggies,

Today, I went to my friends. They are IT Professionals (one of the four
biggies in india) used my linux to practice some unix commands(Project
requirement, I think so!!). Basically they are new to linux and open
source. But good in Windows and its stuffs.

In between, I got some little time to surf in the net, and they noticed
that I am using firefox 3.0. Suddenly one of them said, "I also used
firefox, But I downloaded for windows, Its a pirated edition, downloaded
from a p2p sharing site",

"What?????" I replied, "Ya Its called MS firefox 2007 Professional, In
microsoft site they have it for
XP(http://www.msfirefox.com/download-microsoft-firefox.html)" he replied.

then a little google, I showed this informationweek
site,http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/browsers/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=193700190
But They came up with this site,
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/11/14/ms_firefox/ and this site
.

Enough!!! Its better to ask geeks about this, In 2006, what happend

there any deal? Is these sites are real? these sites are still present,
If these sites are fake, then why they are still there?

Ask them first what piracy means itself? If I download anything via p2p,
does it become illegal or pirated?

LOL! Hehe, it's a spoof. I particularly like the "kernel protection"
feature:

"Note: TakeOver will often over-react to unendorsed security software
and may unexpectedly force the Windows file system into a uncontrollable
shutdown / recovery phase. There is nothing you can do."

Check http://www.mslinux.org/ out too :-).

I think the two statements are entirely disconnected, that it is
obtained via P2P has no correlation with it being pirated.

Hehe, interesting. I never liked the Register, but I hope it's just a
prank (though the date is no where near April 1st), and not terrible
quality control.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

yes -- Print a string until interrupted

Summary :

It prints the command line arguments, separated by spaces & followed
by a newline, forever until it is killed. 'yes' can be used to feeds a
continuous string of the character to another process and create dummy
process for learning the process control.

Example:

$ yes -- Prints `y' followed by a newline until killed.

$ yes ILUGC -- Prints `ILUGC' followed by a newline until killed.

$ yes `cat myfile` -- Print myfile content until killed.

$ yes | fsck /dev/hda1 -- Runs fsck non-interactively.

$ yes | rm -r mydir -- Same effect as rm -rf mydir.

$ yes > /dev/null & -- Dummy process.

Read : man yes

HTH :)

you can use convert to make each image as a page, although I am not
sure if this what you're looking for.

Message-ID: <c9ea6e770807210203h4136f061xdc994dfd5cca25c5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Last sunday, i gave a seminar to 3 engg students on Web server, MySQL
server, PHP, and some basics of web programming, like sending form variables
procesing it in server using PHP, updating mysql and retrieving from it.

The students were very encouraged at this, and in the evening they called me
and said, "We are very interested" and they started working on a sample
project for resume/profile management".  And i am sure, in their final year
project, they would be able to do a project on their own.

I also gave them the demonstration of how to install a typical PHP
application like Mediawiki, forum, wordpress blogs etc.  But more than that,
i gave them an idea, on how to bring those softwares in to common use in
their college.  I have already expressed in this ILUG group.  I will again
recall it below.

1. To implement Knowledge Management Portal in their college using Media
wiki.  I gave them an idea of how easily we can create new pages, and manage
our data, and they are very much interested.

2. To implement an announcement portal using wordpress, for every
department.  This announcement portal would be used to publish all circulars
issued by the principals and HOD.

They would be discussing with their HOD and staffs and get back to me by
this week.

One thing i observed from this experience is that there are enough students
who are very much interested to learn.  The problem is that there is
complete lack of guidance and support from knowledged quarters.  Without
these basic knowledge they felt handicapped and could not implement any of
their ideas even if they are very much interested.  When i sat down with
them, they came with lot of ideas, and i just told them how easily we can
implement those with WAMP/LAMP tools.

I would like to bridge this knowledge divide, and i am thinking of how to
interlink those industry professionals and academic students.

My goal is to implant the basic knowledge to as much students as possible,
so that they would be able to implement their ideas.  And it should be a
participative mode.  The three students whom i taught would be further
teaching another 5 students (of different college) in the coming week.  I
also want to make sure, that not any single college exploits the knowledge
acquired by these students.  For this, the solution is to diffuse this
knowledge to other colleges, and enable inter college participation on this.

I also suggested them to add Open Source concepts and particularly on FOSS
tools in the symposium that they are going to do.


Some suggestions:

1. What i have done is very basic thing, that need not require any expertise
or great skills.  However, to actually get a momentum, we need to establish
knowledge pockets, on advanced technicalities like Building a Linux Distro
from source, knowledge on compiling methods, linux programming etc.

2. We can evolve a list of basic skills needed for the students, and
volunteer to teach them at some selected colleges.  Once a team is formed,
then those students should volunteer to teach their juniors and other
college students.  This will create innumerable opportunities and would
unleash the creativity of young minds.  Imagine, if atleast few in each
college knows how to build a linux distro, we would have atleast a dozen
customized distro in india.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am sorry if i am too impractical.  But i just shared some of my vision
with you all.

Senthil

/** I have to use an Enterprise Resource Planning software for one of my
friend`s textile factory **/

I came across a software called ERP5 , that's specially designed for
Apparell industry.  I havent tried it out, but i feel it could be a good
choice.

WebERP:  I think, its not that much usable in the present context.  If we
could tweak some PHP code there, we can make it usable.

Opentaps: One of my friend's friend is working on opentaps.  The UI is well,
and simple.  Since its based on OFBiz, (apache's another project), it may be
given a try.

Open Bravo:  I think, it has too much of features, and the UI is not that
much friendly.  (To my very limited knowledge and experience)

This is not impractical, it just needs coordinated effort from us. We can organise a set of teams, each of which handles a different domain like kernel development, web development, packaging etc.  But how do we do this and how to go and let people know about this needs some more discussion.

That was a good work Senthil.

May I know how to install by booting a custom kernel?? Is it mounting

some other way?

Have a look at PDFlib. I'm not sure if it will meet your needs.
But they have bindings for PHP/Perl/Ruby/C/Java etc...

Thanks santhosh..  I suggest, that we can have the skills database from our
ILUGC group..  it would be useful if we want to plan in future..

In the list of OS supported, they have not mentioned anything about linux.
It seems the disk is preformatted in NTFS. If we reformat to ext3, can we use it in systems with Linux OS. 
I request you to kindly comment on this.
If you or your friends have any prior experience in using this product in Linux OS, kindly let me know.

Should not be a problem.  How long has this size been in the market? 

Hearsay, the first gen of the mega size hard disks have had higher

This seems to be a standard USB external storage device and should be
usable as such.

You should probably not reformat it as a single disk partition unless
you are planning to use it for "large file" type file system for many
large files. In order to give yourself some flexibility, you should
create an LVM physical volume and then use LVM to partition the disk
as you need to. This allows you to resize volumes if you need to.

I have been using an external USB Seagate 350GB external drive
for backup. No problems so far.

LFS was one of the most interesting things I did :D. And yeah. I believe ABS

I am wondering if we need customized distros. It would actually work better
if we had a StudentForce GNU/Linux or something like that with a ground up
package manager and 0 config tools (so that people dont depend on a single
tool for grow up the *nix way) . Here we can allocate a package or two to
every interested student and watch it progress.. I am sure it will grow into
a huuuuge distro. Of course we can have trusted users, community repos etc.
I love the Archlinux project for that.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

uniq -- Remove duplicate lines from a SORTED file.

Summary :

It prints the unique lines in a sorted file. If input is NOT in 
sorted order then, only adjacent duplicate lines are discarded.

Example:

Create 'myfile' with 2 cols of digits for testing.

$ uniq myfile -- Print only unique lines.

$ uniq -i myfile -- Ignore case when comparing.

$ uniq -u myfile -- Print only lines, Which is not duplicated.

$ uniq -c myfile -- Print all unique lines with no .of occurrence.

$ uniq -d myfile -- Print only duplicate lines. If a line duplicated
                    then, only one line will be printed.

$ uniq -D myfile -- Print all duplicate lines.

$ uniq -w5 myfile -- Use only first 5 Chars for checking the uniqueness 
                     of the line.

$ uniq -f2 myfile -- Don't compare up-to 2nd field.

$ uniq -s2 myfile -- Don't compare up-to 2nd char.

$ sort myfile | uniq > output -- Sort myfile & store the uniq output.

I am recommending bcoz, only if student understands the full compiling
process they can work on individual modules effectively.  They need not
customize the distro..  but, they can atleast know how to compile it from
source and make it running..

Personally i feel, there are lot of customizations needed for the Linux, to
match microsoft..  probably high level customization..  It would also help
in localising the distros

"sort <-u|--unique>  ..." to remove duplicate lines.

Indeed, uniq has other useful options.

Following through with LFS upto the point where you can create a
self-building system is instructive in some ways. However, it is not
for everyone. In particular, it may be useful for those who want to
work on a kernel or libc, but not for people who work on/with
applications which are cross-platform.

> I am wondering if we need customized distros.

I don't think we need yet-another-distribution. Learning to improve
and develop the tools used to build, develop, maintain the existing
distributions is far more fruitful. Of course, someone may have a very
nice new idea about _how_ to package software in which case creating a
new distribution would be worthwhile.

The idea behind customised (sub) distributions is to pick, choose and
configure packages that are relevant to a specific community. This
works by using the _same_ package lists and stable repositories as the
main distribution. At most some customising packages (which could
even be dummy or arch independent) are added. Any one who installs
such a customised distribution then has easy access even to those
packages that were _not_ chosen and customised.

Regards,

Kapil.

+1 to this. Creating a distribution is possibly a learning experience
in terms of package management, etc, but it would be far more useful
to learn to write and maintain software/applications. At the
beginner's level, a new package management system is a bit challenging
because lots of advanced concepts about security come into play.

I agree..  my core point is to establish knowledge pockets on all these
skills.. whether package management, or application development or kernel
coding. whatever may be, we need to focus on how to establish and sustain
that skill set..

Another attempt i made was, after introducing them MySQL, i showed them how
to connect to mysql from VB (which they already learned)..  this way, the
dependance on Access and mSQL server could be reduced..

Then we have gambas similar to VB, and MonoDevelop/Sharpdevelop similar to
.NET ..

So even in application development, the present state is NIL..

You have not mentioned the distro.  If it is RHEL or Novell/SuSE you can 
contact their tech support for help.  You can also investigate if AMD 
has any Linux support channel for systems using their CPU.

Do you have the luxury to boot the system using the latest kernel using 
a custom built kernel?   At a minimum, scan through the release notes 
of the subsequent kernel versions for fixes related to AMD chips.

Should not be a problem.  How long has this size been in the market? 

Hearsay, the first gen of the mega size hard disks have had higher

This seems to be a standard USB external storage device and should be
usable as such.

Oh.

You should probably not reformat it as a single disk partition unless
you are planning to use it for "large file" type file system for many
large files. In order to give yourself some flexibility, you should
create an LVM physical volume and then use LVM to partition the disk
as you need to. This allows you to resize volumes if you need to.

I take your word.

I have been using an external USB Seagate 350GB external drive
for backup. No problems so far.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

rdate -- Get the time from Remote machine. 

Summary :

It connects to an Remote Time Server over a IP network, printing the
returned time and/or setting the system clock. The time in remote
server is maintained properly. So that all machines can get the time
from that server.

Example:

$ rdate -p 192.168.1.5 -- Print the time returned by the remote 
                          machine.

# rdate -s remote.pc.com -- Set the system time to the time returned 
                        by the remote machine (Need Root permission).

# rdate -u myserver -- Use UDP instead of TCP as the transport.

# rdate -l myserver -- Use syslog to log errors and output (Useful 
                       when it is used in cron jobs).

NOTE:
1) Remote server should run the time service in port 37.
2) Firewall should not block port 37.

Read : man rdate

Yep. I will post the notes later on. We plan to hold such sessions on a 
regular basis. If folks here are interested but unable to attend in the 
date/time specified, let me know another convenient time and I will try 
to accommodate.

Same here. Having packaged a few apps for Fedora I still would want to
know more and help out in the classroom. Is it possible to have it
after 2100 hrs anyday?

Its difficult for me to attend at 1500 hrs. If logs would be available
it would be great! But nothing like being there doing it :-)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0807240019340.14633@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,
One of my friend needs to migrate from HP-UX to AIX OR Sun Solaris.
He has several ksh scripts(korn shell).

My understanding is the program does not require any change(assuming the
folder structure and files are maintained in the same way as before both
for the korn shell executable and the migrating programs themselves).

He says it would require code changes something like "if" and "loops"
syntaxes. OR to put in other words, his point is the output will not same
as expected and might require changes.

The applications are huge and numerous in number and the time is limited.
That is the reason we could not test all the programs by ourselves.

Could any one who has migrated before and done some large scale coding
help in the understanding.



Thanks & Regards,
carti

Hi ,

i find my self in a situation where i need to  host  a knowledge base for my
company.
i did search in Google , but the best i could come up with are OWL and some
Wiki engines.

My Requirement.

There a bunch of roughly   2000 articles in the form of html, text , pdf,
and  (yes you guessed it)  .doc format.

I  am also in need of a design idea. what would be an ideal way to present
this to the users.

The main  aim is to make this collection  highly searchable.

My IT managers are trying to push this whole episode in to   getting us into
a quagmire( read : M$ sharepoint ) unless i can come up with some
alternative.

1)Should i just host  a website and use a search engine like perlfect or
something?
2) Does some one have experience with OWL?
3) better yet, did anybody face this situation before? your advice would be
most valuable.

Thanks for reading.


Regards
Raj

eGroupWare has a "Knowledge Base" as well as a Document Management 
component.  The KB module itself does not have attachment capability 
but you can have the files under the Document Management module and 
link to it under KB.  Alternately, you could extend the KB code to 
allow attachments of your existing docs.

I think you could get an usable system, if you think out the 
organization of your KB and Doc. Mgmt. carefully.

Nothing new, most of them look at short term gain 'coz in the long term 
(when the TCO has hit the roof) they have transitioned to some other 
job/company.

A Drupal guy could probably dish a prototype custom KB app. in a month 
or two.

I am proposing eGroupWare's functionality to a client (although his KB 
is at much smaller scale).

We installed eprints from eprints.org. It required some work at
customisation and is working after that
	http://www.imsc.res.in/eprints

This is appropriate in an academic environment like ours but I don't
know whether it would work for you.

There is a search facility but I have not used it much.

Hi

http://www.heise-online.co.uk/open/Intel-switches-from-Ubuntu-to-Fedora-for-Mobile-Linux--/news/111166

"Chip manufacturer Intel wants to use parts of the Fedora Project Linux 
distribution instead of Ubuntu as the basis for the second version of 
Moblin (Mobile & Internet Linux Project)."

"Intel is keen on using a Linux distribution that uses RPM packages and 
package management software. Hohndel pointed out that RPM packages 
include licence information; the DEB package management as used by 
Ubuntu and Debian doesn't have this information in the package files. By 
having licence information available, developers can create software 
collections by licence type or exclude software with certain types of 
licences."

Not wanting to start a flame-war or anything ;-) ...

Any Debian package contains "/usr/share/doc/<pkgname>/copyright"
which contains the copyright info.

Perhaps RPM has some way this information can be directly displayed using

	rpm some_option pkgname.rpm

_without_ installing the package.

If that is the case, then this would be a good feature to recommend
to the "dpkg" maintainers.

RPM has the licensing information in the metadata so you can use tools 
to gather that information in a consistent machine readable fashion 
which you cannot do by merely reading a copyright license (that makes 
the difference between identifying whether a particular software package 
is under the GPLv2 license or GPLv2 or later licensing for instance).

For example,

# yum info worldofpadman
Loaded plugins: refresh-packagekit
Available Packages
Name       : worldofpadman
Arch       : i386
Version    : 1.34
Release    : 0.9.rc4.fc9
Size       : 11 k
Repo       : fedora
Summary    : World Of Padman - Comic 3D-Shooter
URL        : http://padworld.myexp.de/
License    : GPLv2+
Description: World of Padman (WoP) is a first-person shooter...

The License tag here indicates clearly that this is under the GPLv2 or 
later license. For additional details, refer

ifconfig - CONFIGure a `network' InterFace

Summary :

Ifconfig is used to display/configure the kernel-resident network
interfaces. 

Example:

$ ifconfig -- Show info abt the active network interfaces like IP
              Address, MAC address, Subnet mask, and status.

$ ifconfig -a -- Show the status of active and inactive interfaces.

# ifconfig eth0 down -- Deactivate/Shutdown the eth0 interface.

# ifconfig eth0 up -- Activate the eth0 interface.

# ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up -- Activate an
                                   interface with specific IP address.

# ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.1.101 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255

# ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.1.102 netmask 255.255.255.0 -- Creating
       Alias for eth0, ie Assign more than one IP address to eth0.

# ifconfig eth0 arp -- Enable the use of the ARP protocol on eth0.

# ifconfig eth0 -arp -- Disable the use of the ARP protocol on eth0.

# ifconfig eth0 promisc -- Enable the promiscuous mode on eth0.

# ifconfig eth0 hw ether 06:05:04:03:02:01 -- Change eth0 MAC address.

# ifconfig eth0 mtu 1412 -- Change Max Transfer Unit of eth0.

Read : man ifconfig

NOTE:
1) Deactivate the interface before changing the IP/MAC.
2) Note down the original MAC, Otherwise Reboot needed 
   to get back the original MAC Address.

Hi,
Log4j is the only API available for sending syslog messages..
I don't think there is any other API available for this...
There are several other examples available...just do a google... :-)
U can also visit www.claros.org which is a free software were they have
used log4j...
This is an open source software.... :-)

Subject: [Ilugc] Introducing Trisul - an open source project out of Chennai
Message-ID: <4889D9DE.5080108@unleashnetworks.com>

Hi List,

First, a quick intro. My name is Vivek and I run a startup called 
Unleash Networks. We make tools for network & security analysis. I 
attended the June meeting of ILUGC , but was unable to attend the July 
meeting (even though I badly wanted to hear the Debian packaging talk). 
I hope to meet many of you personally the next time.

I recently started an open source project called Trisul. It is an GPLv3 
open source tool targeted at network and security administrators. Trisul 
meters network traffic usage as well as stores raw traffic for forensic 
analysis. The metered data goes into a SQLITE3 database and the raw 
traffic goes into a ring of files. You can then use Trisul to 
investigate incidents or drilldown into network usage. You can ask 
questions like "Which IPs contributed to the ICMP flood at 5AM 
yesterday". You can even reconstruct traffic "What files did IP x.x.x.x 
transfer between 10 and 11 AM two days back".

Trisul has two main components :
1. The backend which is C++  (currently tested on Ubuntu/Fedora)
2. The web interface (called Web-Trisul) which is a Ruby on Rails 
application.

I wanted to share this with the list because:
1. This is a great opportunity for interested students to get involved 
with an open source project.
2. There is plenty of learning opportunity starting from using autoconf, 
to coding,  to packaging.
3. The ruby on rails app is pretty nifty, this is a chance to work on it 
even more and enhance your skills.
4. Linux based companies can try out the tool and build a support based 
business out of it.
5. Network admins who are running tools like Snort, ntop, can also try 
this out and help build the feature set.
6. I am based in Chennai - therefore accessibility is easy.  I would 
like to get involved with some of the others in building more expertise 
in Chennai in Linux development / packaging.

Without further ado :

The Project is at http://www.unleashnetworks.com/trisul/doku.php
The Freshmeat announcement is at 
http://freshmeat.net/projects/trisul/?branch_id=75172&release_id=281386

If anyone is interested in either joining, testing, commenting about 
this project. Feel free to email me.

Thanks for listening,

Regards,
Vivek

Yes, indeed.  rpm --queryformat "fields" can display any field from the

yes. something will keep getting locked - I remember this happening  
when I was using ubuntu. You need to periodically delete the locks -  
or upgrade to opensuse or mandriva

Starting with JDK 1.4, Sun has introduced java.util.logging framework.
Its packaged along with the JDK and is available in all JVMs. Even
with this, most of the applications use only log4j. But instead of
using it directly, people generally create a wrapper over it (and very
often fail misserbly) or they use commons logging.

Apache's Commons Logging is a logging framework wrapper. It will try
to use whichever logger is available at runtime in its classpath.

As someone has said this indicates that some "sound daemon" is
locking your audio device. Perhaps this is "pulseaudio" which was
hurriedly released along with Ubuntu LTS. If you installed the
browser directly from mozilla.org then you should mention that.

 - look on the ubuntu fora or ask your question there
 - usually you can reconfigure iceweasel to use a different
   sound system with
     dpkg-reconfigure -plow iceweasel
   choose native or alsa (not OSS!).

Kapil.

I also faced the similar problem but solution is very simple. The problem is with Pulse audio and flash 9, Ubuntu has a fix for this one. Please try to install "libflashsupport" from synaptic and your problem should be solved.. Just restart the Firefox and you should be able to play audio from multiple sources -- flash, totem, amarock...

It appears that by Default, libflashplugin (Flash 9 support in Firefox) doesn't work properly with PulseAudio.

Restart Firefox to enable simultaneous audio output from flash and other sources (rhythmbox, totem, etc).

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] DNS sec issue affects home users
Message-ID: <20080726042544.GE12786@imsc.res.in>

Dear Friends,

There is potentially a huge DNS problem that is about to hit the
internet on a scale comparable with spam e-mail.

It can be solved by patching the DNS resolver you use but:

  - the DNS resolver of your home router is impossible to patch
 
  - the DNS servers of Indian ISP's have currently not been patched

Thus the problem affects *all* users who use the 'net from home.

Note that running your own caching name servers may not help if your
home router is an appliance style NAT firewall between your name
server and the net. That device may effectively be de-randomising your
DNS lookup requests.

Please check your DNS service via www.doxpara.com (which is Dan
Kaminsky's web site) and if your ISP is at fault --- bug them!

Another step which is currently expensive may be to buy a home router
that runs GNU/Linux. You can then patch to get 2.6.24 kernel which
randomises ports while doing NAT.

A cheaper solution for both problems is for all users to switch their
home computers/routers to use a safer DNS service.

One such service is www.opendns.com. If people know of other such
services, they should let their friends know.
 
The problem with some of these services is that when the name lookup
fails they re-direct the lookup to their own sites "for advertising".

To mitigate this we could offer our own name servers for recursive
lookup instead of www.opendns.com and the like. The problem would be
how we could keep the load at reasonable levels. We could use traffic
shaping to limit the use of bandwidth for this to reasonable levels.

Suggestions welcome.

Regards,

Kapil.

I tried making use of a public DNS, 4.2.2.2 to be specific, on my Airtel

Dear Luggies

Arunai Engg College, Tiruvannamalai is organising an International
Conference on Information Technology for Rural Development from
29th Aug to 31 Aug 08.

Thiagu and me visited their college on 25 jul 08 and had discussion
with management,faculty and students on how ILUGC can participate 
in it.

We have broadly identified the following areas

1.Village GIS system: This will use the openstreetmap to provide
all information like vao office, schools etc.

2.Agri/botanical information. The details about the crop, soil
  and other such information to be aggregated using some tool.

3.Women self help group, their activities, how to start, what
  are the products produced, credits etc.

4.Veterinary information system: The detaills of live stock,
  their dieseases etc.,

5. Primary health info system like immunisation, sanitation
   etc.

6. Tele health : enabling consultation with specialist remotely.

7. Bridging digital divide using Lowcost computing in rural schools 
   with ltsp based thin clients

8. Computer aided learning using educational software like gcompris
   kstars etc.

9. Computers in local language 

For 2-5 we have to think of proper tool - may be wiki like.

Students have suggested few

10. A remotely operated system with some wifi technology to control
    irrigation channel, switching on/off the pumpsets etc.

12. Some kind of web based aggregation tool to provided rural related
    data from various websites.


Suggestions are welcome. Please keep in mind following constraints

a.Time is short less than 30 days, so only what is possible
  within the time should be aimed at.
b.We have to involve their students and get things done or do it
  ourselves
c.We have to visit atleast twice before the event to guide
  the students, though most guidance can be over net -  but net
  penetration isn't very high.

d.We need atleast 20 physical volunteers


Needless to say we talking about FOSS based tools/work only.

hi,
conducted a one-day python workshop at Krishna engineering college,  
Coimbatore. It was attended by about 60 staff and students. The whole  
workshop was hands-on and was a good success. Many questions at the  
end. The management of Krishna engineering college are very keen on  
open source, so I request LUG members who go to Coimbatore to visit  
the college and hold sessions. Looks like foss in kongunaad is taking

The KDE Education project has a whole list of very good tools. One can
have a look of all the tools available here

http://edu.kde.org/ (The new program STEP is one amazing tool. It will
be great if one can manage to run KDE 4.x and show this tool)

I can be available for a day or two. Please feel free to ping me.

I dont use slides - I sit and type code and the participants follow  
along on their machines. The college has a lab that can accommodate  
about 70 people - with around 50 machines and all on the internet.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

arp -- Manipulate the Address Resolution Protocol cache

Summary :

ARP is used to find a MAC Address corresponding to an IP Address.
After resolving the address, the result will be stored in kernel
cache. The 'arp' command is used to view/add/del kernel ARP Cache
table entries.

Example:

$ arp -- Show ARP Cache table.

$ arp -v -- For detailed output.

$ arp -n -- Show Address in numeric. Don't try to resolve the names.

$ arp wify -- Show the ARP entry for wify host.

$ arp -a wify -- Same as above.

$ arp -t ether -- Only show ether HW class entries.

$ arp -i eth0 -- Show ARP entries of eth0 interface.

# arp -d 192.168.1.100 -- Delete the ARP entry for this IP.

# arp -s 192.168.1.200 00:0B:22:33:44:55 -- Add a new entry.

# arp -f arps.txt -- Same as above. Here data will be taken from 
                     the arps.txt file.

The caching name servers (on LAN) contact the root servers and the SOA 
of the queried domains directly don't they?

I did not quite follow what you mean by "de-randomising DNS lookup 
requests."   Are you saying these NAT devices are aware of the root 
servers and redirect the query packets to the DNS servers configured 
into instead?

....................
.....................

**/

This is an excellent suggestion and a nice idea..

However, to avoid the risk of being theoritical, can we evolve a set of use
cases, on how the people at rural villages would be using these
informations..

Instead of taking up bulk of suggestions at one time, can we take few
important suggestions, and then work in details, right from conceptual to
implementation, and sustainability.

Analysis of the predicted outcome in that area because of this project,
would help us improve the clarity of our goals..

Some of my suggestions:
------------------------------------

1. Establish Connectivity at rural areas, through Fibre Optics.  And then
persuading IT related companies to setup office there.  Initially, BPO's can
start with this.  Once we could make a pilot project successful, i feel,
more will follow up.

Some of my predicted Usage Scenarios:
--------------------------
   -> People working in BPOs tend to settle in villages (due to reduced
living cost & work availability) .  This will bring in economy there, which
provide more opportunities.  As a result, shops with urban items would be
setup, clinics would be opened, good theatres will come, and these people
would be a good market for the surrounding farmers, to sell their produces.
Over the period of time, good schools would be setup, and thus, a complete
cycle of basic requirements will be available.
-> The rural people have immediate accessibilitie to the educated ITES for
any help or guidance. and the local people by implicit start learning IT
business.

2. I think, now internet connection is available in all Panchayat Offices.
We can approach the government, and use that connectivity to setup small
browsing centres and computer centre.  But, that should not teach them c or
c++.. rather, that should teach only the tools and softwares necessary and
beneficial to those rural people..

They should not be trained to merely consume the information..  Rather, they
should be able to contribute their knowledge back, even though its not that
much technical or sophisticated..  Training the people to express themselves
will bring drastic change in their thought process.

Some examples are:
1. Creating a issue resolution system there.  So that any knowledge person
can go to browsing center, and log in their complaints for view by their
panchayat leader.  This would enable them to maintain issue history, which
they can review and analyse in the long run.

2. To create a local forum to discuss about their issues. (the forums
accessible in the browsing centre..)

And for using all these, they need to know typing.  We can setup a small
typing training centre..

And all these in our Mother Tongue..  and they should be trained to type in
Mother Tongue first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I dont know if its practical or not..  But, my approach to problem is
"Enhancing our life with IT tools, rather than enhancing the tools with our
life"..

ie, first we need to understand our requirement..  then when we get a new
knowledge/tools/technology, how can we use it for improving our current
situation.. how can we adapt it to our lifestyle..

If we think in this framework, we can be more indigenous, and automatically
innovation will emerge, when we start implementing it..

Nice suggestions , but i would like to add my observations

We can afford to do what a little difference can add to enrich the
life in the rural sector. The exhibit models are more of a proto type
to envisage how systems can we put in place for the villagers to get
information for their  needs. As you will agree with me that the
million mile journey starts with a single step ahead, and that step is
this opportunity, where arunai extends us to go in for  building these
exhibits. Our responsibility is to conceptualize and build the best
solution at a short time frame.

We have identified some 10 stalls, which will be contextual and
technological in relevance  to the International summit on rural
development which is happening at AEC TVM. We are open to ideas, We
need guyz for  setting up wiki's CMS utility softwares,
infrastructural projects(like LTSP) which can be show cased.

So in all means, this exercise is the step 0 towards our goal of
modernization of rural areas. interested people please pitch in , and
make a difference in the lives of those who deserve it  , This
initiative is being called by AEC TVM, lets rope the event and make a
good show.

No way. Bcoz before the next month meet, Kumar will be @ Univ of Texas
for his PhD.

Apart from this, Porting talk was decided in the last meet itself and
Mr Luis availability on next month is also doubtful. And I don't want

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

sleep/usleep -- Sleep for a specified amount of time

Summary :

Sleep will introduce a delay for a specified seconds (Seconds may be
an arbitrary floating point number). usleep sleeps some no of micro-
seconds (default is 1).

Examples :

$ sleep 6  -- Sleep for 6 Seconds.

$ sleep 6s -- Sleep for 6 Seconds (Default).

$ sleep 6m -- Sleep for 6 Minutes.

$ sleep 6h -- Sleep for 6 Hours.

$ sleep 6d -- Sleep for 6 Days.

$ sleep 10.5 -- sleep for 10.5 Seconds.

$ usleep 200 -- Sleep for 200 mSec.

Sleep may NOT give a very accurate result on many machines.

Read : man sleep , usleep

Actually, I volunteer to withdraw my talk. I'll attend the meet though.

Too many cooks spoil the broth! :-) So consider my talk withdrawn.

Though I have no clue about the error, for getting back data
use a live cd like knoppix or use fc2- first cd and go into rescue mode,
mount the partition and copy data over the network .

May the filesystem in the partition is corrupt, try running fsck after backup.

"Google, like most other companies, requires a BS (equivalent) for all
their programming positions.

This probably is a direct application of an American idea to an Indian
population. The average Indian engineering graduate has spent 14 years
of cut-throat competition at school, the last 2 years of it
"coaching"
to get into a good college, 4 years of dubious college education, the
last 2 years of it getting coached for CAT."

Message-ID: <7bf1bec50807291009y2c62cd0p4adb1a199e1299ef@mail.gmail.com>

Now that the 'Left' has been shown the door, I was wondering if there
would be a move to introduce software patents in the name of fast
forwarding economic reforms. Looks like there is, in fact, such an
effort:

http://osindia.blogspot.com/2008/07/patent-office-meeting-in-mumbai-on-7th.html

As expected, the 'jewels' of digital India, TCS and Infosys want it
and looks like they will use all their might to get it done.

Meanwhile, a judge of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
the US says he regrets the 'unintended consequences' of software
patents:

http://techdirt.com/articles/20080728/0236131808.shtml

So, while the US might extricate itself from the mess, our 'thought
leaders' are busy preparing a brand new mess for us - so they can fish
in it at leisure!

BTW, do such meetings happen in Chennai also?

regds,
mano

Probably  not, There is a huge warmth in the govt level organization

he has been in the post for 3 years, which is a surprisingly long  
term. No IAS official is given more than 3 years in a post. I do not  
think you can read too much into this. btw, it is not good etiquette  
to post a tinyurl on an archived mailing list. Please post full urls.  
In case of long urls, you can give instructions on how to reach the url.

Sir,
     I think that this is due to restarting the machine having Dual/Triple
OS.

 I experienced this type of crash many time, due to restarting the machine.
My experience is,

If you having dual OS of Linux, both are share the single swap partitions (
by using auto guided partitioning using large free space in ubuntu
installation) and when we restart the machine, change the OS when booting,
OS will crash. I used RHEL4 and Ubuntu 7.10.

If you having Dual OS of Linux and Windows XP, Improper shutdown and
restarting machine to switch over from linux to windows will cause System
cash which is normal.

I don't have an solution. Only thing is try to backup your datas and
re-install it.
First install Windows then Linux. edit the grub to add booting option for
windows. avoid NTFS partition for windows.

Please avoid to use Windows with Linux. try to use wine package.


Padhu,
Ooty.

I have used the same swap disk partition shared amongst multiple Linux 
distros (Ubuntu, CentOS, openSUSE) and I have had no problems.

Are you hibernating one Linux distro A and then rebooting to another 
Linux distro B?

I have tried installing multiple GNU/Linux distributions with a single 
swap partition, and even with Windows along it. I have never experienced 
this problem.

I am somehow quite wary on suggesting people to use things over wine. If 
you want to use it and there is no alternative, you genuine Windows itself.

Dear kenneth ji,

This is not good. I would like to create a news story on this for EFYTimes.com. Can we talk outside the list to get the feedback of community as to how they view this transfer as, and what impact it is going to have?

since they are beginners, they may as well start with the latest and  
best - git. But if their level of understanding is not so high,  
subversion is the easiest to use, and, if you are not going to have  
many branches and merging I would recommend that.

there is nothing to discuss - no IAS officer is ever given more than  
3 years in a post. And it will be very difficult for the new guy to  
undo everything that has been done. Look at it positively, Umashankar  
now has a whole new department to linuxify.

i heard its asking for .xls upload. if thats the case we need to show our

i also noticed today, though icicibank.com claim to be firefox (firefox
3.0.1) compliant but inside loan and few other sections are not working with
firefox. strictly internet explorer compliant.

any one tried logging on to irctc.co.in in one tab (firefox 3.0.1) and
opening same irctc.co.in in another tab? what do you get? it allows another
login for me.

is this the way it should be?

yes, we should protest IF, but it does not. the upload is an xml file, the 
same as last year. i have e-filed my return last year and this year also. 
unfortunately, the it department gives you one tool only to create the xml 
file and that is an excel spread sheet (with macros) that will probably only 
run on microsoft excel. however, they also give you the full schema and give 
you other tools so you can write your own application to create the xml file 
(in the developers portion of their web site). i have not tried this part 
myself, but i see that there are several commercial offerings, typically with 
web front ends, that allow you create (and file) the online return xml.

Please look at /var/log/messages file on the NIS server. It should
provide more clues. Only after you are successful in fully bringing up
the server, you need to concentrate on the NIS client side.

Azureus is a full and full Java Application. But it uses the SWT
library - which depends on a few .so files under Linux (.dll under
Windows).

Am not sure about the Debian packages, but you can download the
libswt-gtk from www.eclipse.org and add it to the LD_LIBPATH (Did I
spell the variable name correctly?).

ofcourse you can download the Azrues jar file directly from the site
and run it -  if you have Java already installed.

LTSP + Edubuntu is an excellent combination for educational institutes
in rural as well as urban areas all together imho.
As most of you are already aware, it uses simple and highly efficient
technology to provide  effective and feasible alternative to using high
end fat clients as desktops with  proprietory os.

These days I am working with a silicon valley based NGO to  set up a
computer lab for an orphanage in karaikal, a costal town in tamil nadu.
Our intent is to use computers in a school setup so as to make existing
learning more effective. And we believe that we could use a simple
technology to make big difference in people's lives. 

I have a setup almost ready with one  amd opteron dual core server  and
8 diskless and light generic clients with  accessories such as
projector, printer/scanner, speakers etc. Edubuntu comes loaded with
LTSP, which makes setup mostly automated and has a number of educational
softwares and interesting  games.  We are right now working on setting
up few add ons and customizing client desktops.

I would be happy to showcase it at Rural India Conference. I could spare
a weekend for the conference, but will not be able to visit the place
before that due to my other engagements.   If  I get some help from a
few enthusiastic volunteers /college students, who are willing to come
and work at my office  I could work on customizing it in Tamil and make
it rock.  If any of you want to have a look at the setup and provide
suggestions/feedbacks/help, feel free to stop by at my TTK road office.


Thanks & Regards,
gourav

It's not ubuntu, it's flash.
