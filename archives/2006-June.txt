release is available for download at

supposedly there is a program called Gyach Enhanced for yahoo which
can do voice chat (not sure about video..).. I don't use it myself,
and it was a bit of a fight before you could get it installed (I just
installed it once for fun :) ). Try your luck!

it moves on...

Oh. I think I get you now. I don't have access to windows, so I can't help
you much, but if you're trying to find out what the name of the database
that the demo application uses, then just go to the folder of demo app (I
think it's named 'mycookbook') in instant rails and checking
config/database.yml file should give you the name of the database being
used.

You might have better luck here (I remember someone saying that they use
Instant Rails) :

I have been using the Dapper Beta 6 and then upgraded to Dapper 6.06 (Long
term Support, Release Candidate LTS RC) . It is terrific.. But just that
after loads of bug reports and more to come from users after they start
using packages and solving some and packaging some Dapper has become a bit
boring for me now. I have uploaded some 3 screenshots of my Dapper RC on
flickr. Looking forward for Edgy already.. w00t!! It auto-detected my long
term dormant Broadcom 4318 802.11 Card?? Even ndiswrapper had some
problems.. Thats boring because it does not test my hacking skills :-)

overall Ubuntu  - Rocks.. :-)

0x18a0b1ca is probably your own IP address 202.177.160.24. It looks to
me as if you misconfigured your tproxy. Hard to say without seeing
your rules.

Message-ID: <20060601163705.86359.qmail@web36702.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hai, I have a RHEL 3 server where in I used sendmail to send some alert mails. It just relay those mails to our mail server. I used SMARTHOST for this, where in I had given the mail servers short hostname and made any entry in the /etc/hosts with its IP. But when ever a mail is sent, sendmail says hostname lookup failure. I haven't given any nameserver IP in /etc/resolve file. i want sendmail to look the /etc/hosts for name resolution for the smarthost hostname. 
   
  When I tried thru command line to ping the mailserver hostname it is pinging. sendmail is not looking /etc/hosts file to resolve the hostname. What should be done.

I have uploaded Tamil typewriting lessons for learning
tamil typewriting on GNU/Linux, released under GNU
FDL. Its been written using Gedit.

I use Ubuntu Dapper Beta with "Tamil Unicode" keyboard
preferences (as used in Dapper Beta).

You can check it out from here:
http://www.shakthimaan.com/ta/computer/computer.html

I have also uploaded keyboard mappings and finger
position diagrams for reference.

Practice each lesson atleast 5 times, and spend
atleast 20-30 minutes per day practicing the lessons.

You can use Tamil99 (TSCII), Tamil99 (Unicode), Tamil
Anjal (Unicode), TamilVP (TSCII), or TamilVP (Unicode)
input methods as well (right click in the Gnome
application -> Input methods).

Friends.

I have an Intex sound card.

There are 2 ports for Front and Rear speakers.
But i have only stereo speakers.
So i can hear any of Front or rear sound only.

Is there any possibility to bypass any rear or front sound to only one port
in linux?

  Mine is a Powershot S210 (Ixus V2 in Asia/Pacific). I do it
the hard way - by pulling out the CF card, plugging it in
any of numerous USB->CF adapters available locally, and
copying out all the .jpg images. I use gqview to view/edit
the images, and Gimp for more heavyweight processing (rarely).

  Apparently, Picasa for Linux can detect plugged in cameras,
but I haven't tested it with the Canon.

I have installed Ubuntu Dapper 6.06 in my Desktop and Laptop (HP nx6120). It
is really amazing!!!!! Everything works just like that. I have not started
tweaking. I don't think I have a lot of scope to tweak :-) :-)

The great first noticeable improvement is Suspend/Hibernate works out of box
in both Desktop and Laptop. I will come up with detailed review soon.

Yes. I have done this in my machine, after installing FC3. Run the
'alsamixer' command, it provide a option to select only one port.

instead of learning the tamil type writer, i think we could use scim
which is a transliterator that means if u type in english, it would be
automatically transferred to your language. i hope in thamizha.com i
see tamilkey which helps u type in english with slight adjustment in
unicode which will be transliterated to tamil on the fly while typing.
say to type bala in tamil, i can use baalaa which will give u ???? in
tamil. so it would be easier to learn. also thamizha.com provides
firefox extension to type in tamil.

Oracle considers venturing into Linux:

In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Ellison said that Oracle
wanted to sell a full "stack" of software that included both OS and
applications.

"I'd like to have a complete stack," he said. "We're missing an OS.

As other replies tell, hotplug is rather now integrated as a kernel part and
its been depreciated with the advent of HAL and UDEV.You can easily modify
the UDEV scripts to mount USB devices when inserted at your specified
location. Whatever distros i used, they are using UDEV and HAL, i havent
dealt with Hotplug.Damn Small Linux(DSL) uses Hotplug.DSL scripts might help
you.Its a live CD.

Message-ID: <594b3b9d0606012331j2d61565ekf9eead41d368bff8@mail.gmail.com>

members,

i'm creating a live cd for my linux distro based on debian of kernel verion
2.6.12smp. i'd created my installable cd with udev, hal, pmount and latest
gvm. when i insert usb i could find my icon for usb instantaneously. but
when i created livecd i could not see the icon corresponding to the  usb,
but the nautalis recognizes and opens the file browser window which shows
the fle contents in the usb(this happens bcos i'd made changes in the FHS of
policy.h of pmount). The livecd is based on the concept of the knoppix where
the contents will be loaded in the /UNIONFS/ folder on mount.

Following is the snapshot of

Though FHS has to be followed i'd added /UNIONFS/ string prefixed to the
directory structure provided in the policy.h of the pmount and made the usb
to mount.

my problem is i like to know why gvm is not recognizing the usb and
displaying the icon on the desktop.

Thanks in advance.

SuSE is already bought over - by Novell. Oracle was considering Ubuntu
for its offering, I seem to remember.

Transliteration is useful for beginners, no doubt.
But,  if you intend to use/promote Tamil in the long
run, and you want to do professional work, I wouldn't
recommend it. Its much faster to use the Tamil
keyboard input, than use transliteration.

I will give you another example. Just like different
input methods for Tamil, there are many input methods
for Mandarin Chinese.

The quick and dirty method is to use the Pinyin method
(romanized). It takes many key strokes to input a
method, but, since pronounciation and written have
nothing in common in Mandarin Chinese, this method is
easier for beginners or non-native speakers to use.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin

But, native speakers in Mainland China use the Wubi
method. There are journalists who are known to hit 160
words (characters) per minute. Each character can be
uniquely entered using scim input Wubi method, within
4 key strokes. 

http://wubi.org/

SK

I take back the term hackfest.
It should be termed a workshop.

Workshop will cover the following aspects of F/OSS hacking:
        - Picking up a task
        - Opening up a discussion in the community

Message-ID: <1149237796.3138.5.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi all,

I use postgres version 7.5.9-2 with psqlodbc version 7.3-3 that comes
with RHEL3 for our application.But i a found sort of bug in psqlodbc
when i try to execute a query while the postgres database is down,the
SQLprepare statement returns 0 insted of -1 & the application crashes by
displaying Broken pipe.

But i did not find this in earlier version of psqlodbc.

I need to handle this we are enhancing our application for postgres
database recovery.

the code goes like this i call this function 

Void executeQuery()
{
    int i, iRetValue;

    for(i = 0; i < MAX_ROW; i ++)
    {
        iRetValue = SQLPrepare( hstmt, (UCHAR *) cmds[i], SQL_NTS );

        if ( iRetValue != SQL_SUCCESS )
        {
            printf( "SQLError SQLPrepare() failed\n" );
            return;
        }

        iRetValue = SQLExecute ( hstmt );
        if ( iRetValue != SQL_SUCCESS )
        {
            printf( "SQLError SQLExecute() failed with retVal: %d\n",
iRetValue
        }
}
                                                           

  Is their any way to verify postgres connection.If so please help me
it's urgent.

                                                                    with

Ages since I touched ODBC, but I think SQLPrepare doesn't actually
talk to the database. SQLExecute is the one that uses a DB connection
to run an SQL query.

You shouldn't be checking for 0 or -1, but for SQL_SUCCEEDED or not.

If your DB died before your ODBC program started, you SQLConnect will
fail, and if it died during your program's execution, your SQLExecute
will fail.

the reason behind is that red hat's acquisition of jboss. because red
hat has now apps server included in their OS. since Jboss was the
direct competitor in Oracle Apps server, Oracle is interested in Linux
OS.

for making big money and competing directly with redhat

 This is a graphical tool to import raw data from high-end digital cameras

 gimp-ufraw has lots of preprocessing options which seem to duplicate gimp's
 features. Unfortunately, they are necessary because its 8-bit limitation
 would cause major quality problems.

When you create your rails application 'Foo',  a database.yml file is
created in the config directory under your applications dir. This file has
configuration parameters for three databases, namely, foo_development,
foo_test and foo_production. You'll have to create your databases using
these names (or change these parameters in the file to reflect the names you
have given to your db). Also the password field will be empty. You'll have
to fill in these too with the relevant values.

Hope this helps.

Subject: [Ilugc] Re:psqlodbc problem Urgent
Message-ID: <1149307148.3148.6.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi all,

 We use postgres version 7.5.9-2 with psqlodbc version 7.3-3 that comes 
as built in package with RHEL3 for our application.We  found a bug in
psqlodbc. When we  try to execute a query while the postgres database is
down or  crashed (Note: This condition occurs after calling SQLConnect
once to  connect to postgres & several calls to executeQuery) the 
SQLExecute crashes displaying Broken pipe.

Note: But i did not find this in earlier version of psqlodbc.

The Code goes like this I call this function executeQuery multiple
times  with pause in between. Between two calls to executeQuery, the
postgres crashes and the very first call to executeQuery after that
causes the program to crash as mentioned above.

 ##################################
 Void executeQuery()
 {
        int i, iRetValue;

         iRetValue = SQLPrepare( hstmt, (UCHAR *) cmds[i], SQL_NTS );

         if ( iRetValue != SQL_SUCCESS )
         {
             printf( "SQLError SQLPrepare() failed\n" );
             return;
         }

         //printf("Executing: %s\n", cmds[i]);
         iRetValue = SQLExecute ( hstmt );

         {
             printf( "SQLError SQLExecute() failed with retVal: %d\n",
 iRetValue
         }
 );

 Is their any way to verify postgres connection. If so please help me.

Dear Friends,

I have an issue, In kubuntu 5.10 breezy badger i installed xampp which went
on fine. after extracting to /opt the installation went well and the lampp
started.I copied the crmctt extracted file to htdocs in xampp and in the
fourth stage of installation it said an error

Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted (tried to

After googling i am coming to the forum as i cannot find a fix for this
solution. the web reference to increase the memory size in the

functions.php where the problem reported, the problem seems to be not over.

any pointers to the issue

XAMPP on Linux seems to be buggy. I've experienced the same issue
with XAMPP on both Slackware 10.2 and Vector Linux 5.1 when I tried
setting up Agavi/Symfony. If I'm not wrong, you would also see a couple
of "Segmentation fault" messages in your apache webserver's error_log
file. While simple PHP scripts work on XAMPP, complex web
applications/framework (like Agavi, Symfony, SugarCRM and so on) fail.

In my case, removing XAMPP and installing individual packages available
on my distribution (Apache + MySQL + PHP + ProFTPd) solved the
problem.

Cheers!

What distro are you using. On my Ubuntu, it is as simple as, System ->
Administration -> Networking, selecting the correct interface and then
providing the parameters, provided your card is recogonised.

If you have an unsupported card, another option might be to try to see
if it works under ndiswrapper.

what is a file's colour? If you mean the coloured output of ls. you can
add the following line in your .bashrc:

alias ls='ls -CF --color'

> directory , etc - all are black. I dont have .bash_profile even,  i have

put this in your ~/.bashrc file:

export PS1=`echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME}: ${PWD}\007"`

you probably deleted your .bash_profile or .bashrc files

power-on reset, and the Linux kernel supports text-mode consoles without
any difficulty. Almost all will also support VESA framebuffer consoles.
This will allow Linux to boot and display text on almost all PCI graphics
cards - exceptions were some ancient high-end 3dfx Voodoo, SPEA FireGL
and similar cards which were graphics-only, with no text-mode support.

For X, it's important to see what accelerated features of your specific
card are supported by XFree86 or Xorg. For reasonably good desktop
performance, you'll need XAA support. If you want 3D gaming support,
you'll also need DRI & OpenGL support. In general, you should be OK
with most older Matrox, ATI or NVidia-based PCI cards.

Traditionally Nvidia cards have had very good Linux driver support.
The supported chipset list :
http://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_18897.html

ATI cards have very poor Linux support.
So , you would be better off with a Nvidia card if Linux is your primary
desktop.

You can use gyach, But it will work only if and only if you have got
the eSound sound driver. No, it won't work with ALSA :-(

gaim-vv (Gaim, Voice-Video, thanks to the respondents of my query long
back) is a good option. Gaim-VV has currently been put on hold, so
that it can be merged after the final release of gaim2.0. As of now
Gaim 2.0 is on Beta 3. After the final 2.0 release, they will start
integrating gaim-vv into Gaim 2.0. I am eagerly waiting for that.


> Have any body succeeded?
I did not succeed as my intel original Mother board with 840 chipset
was supported by ALSA, and I did not try eSOUND.

As of other options, to talk to my brother in Singapore, I came with a
beautiful combination of best sound and video quality, I have ever
seen on a PC. Though not always the right choice for a Linux enthu.
the combination just works fine :-)

have skype for voice chat. It works beautifully on Linux.

Download aMSN from Source Forge. aMSN supports two way half duplex
video conversation.

I was also successfull in using GnomeMeeting in combination with
Microsoft NetMeeting (on the other end). But the video and voice
quality was no where near the Skype and aMSN combo.....

Hi,

>  Where should I start to make my own linux distro?

>From your existing Linux distro itself! You can either try
dissecting your linux distro, to understand how packages
are being managed and then walk-through the installation
scripts to learn the steps involved in installing your own
distribution.

Once you are confident with how your existing distro
was packaged and installed, determine the goals for your
own distribution (in what way will your distro be different
from the others ?). Then start building packages that
should ideally fit into your distro, and if needed customize
the installer to suit your needs.

Alternately, you can start from here:
    * http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/

It would be easier to create your own distro by remastering
existing live CDs. Try looking around for information from the following
sites:
     *  http://www.linux-live.org/
     *  http://www.knoppix.net/wiki/Knoppix_Remastering_Howto

There are many other sites and many more methods to create your
own distro. Everything depends on your exact requirement/goal.

Cheers!

Hi,
I installed kubutu 6.06 Dapper Drake(KDE Version of Ubuntu). I am
totally impressed by it. It is the best linux distro i have tried so
far, way ahead of others. Suse 10.1 is far behind & lot to be desired.
 Everything easily configurable in Kubuntu, my Nvidia Geeforce FX,
Avermedia TV Tuner, DVD-VCD, MS true type fonts, real palyer,
installing packages.  Everything works.  Everyone should try.

To learn try the LFS Project. Already existing Distro list is here
<http://distrowatch.com/stats.php>.

If you want contribute anything to community, Plz join in any of the
on-going project and one bug fix is worth more then a distro :)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0606051400010.1345-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

Hi All,

On Sunday, I attended, Mr Nagappan's talk on "Contributing to FOSS"
in MIT. Here is the tiny MoM:

Around 3:30PM, Mr Nagappan started his talk. Nearly 10 people attended
this event and in that only 3 are new to FOSS. He talked about Bug
Reporting, Diff, Submit etc ...

Then Topic is changed to LDTP (Linux Desktop Testing Project). This
project is used to test applications written using the accessibility
layer library. Presently Gnome applications can be test with this.
Soon KDE also coming with accessibility layer support. Then KDE
application also can be tested using this. Presently he is working to
add the support for record and replay of events.

Link: http://ldtp.freedesktop.org

Then topic is changed to Google Summer of Code. Two students from Anna
Univ are selected for this. Both are ILUGC Members!! (Prasanth Mohan
and Rajagopal). We asked them to share the GSOC Selection process
experience. I hope, the prize money is around $5k.

Prasenth Mohan's LDTP Proposal got selected (NOTE: He is already
contributing to this proj). Rajagopal is selected for Biometric algo
based support in Bash. Good work guys. Kept it up :)

Bye :)

Message-ID: <26fbe3a70606050402i42fcdad6q37b0a52e6860098d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

     I just installed kubuntu 6.06 and I cant seem to be able to get the
network working. The network has two machines, and one airtel adsl
modem/router to connect to the internet. We use static ips, the modem uses
192.168.1.1 and i'm supposed to use 192.168.1.2. The modem is the gateway on
the network. These setting were working fine on my old box which ran FC3. I
just bought a new box, and the same configuration works fine on it in
windows. However, on kubuntu 6.06 i can ping my own box, but cannot ping the
modem or the other machine. I have an asus motherboard(a8n-vm series) with
an nvidia nforce chipset and an onboard ethernet card.

    Has anybody else faced a similar issue(maybe a kubuntu 6.06 issue or a
lan card issue)? Any suggestions/pointers will be appreciated.

Thanks,
Murali

the Release one.. No problem in giving a Demo. But I suspect a Distro flame

Flame wars are NOT bad, if it brings out +/- technical points of the
distro or whatever, which can help other know about it. Unfortunately
in flame wars, people try to give more importance to personal views
then technical truths. Most of the time in India, it became endless
personal war, that is very bad :(

Bye :)

I've never used Ubuntu, or seen someone using it either.  So I come without
and preconceived ideas.  From my end, it's a purely educational experience.
I just want to see if Ubuntu's strengths line up with any of my expectations
from a distro/OS.

I can't speak for others, so you may need your asbestos suits :-)

Well, all that look good, so probably your firewall or selinux or

Sorry for jutting into the thread, let me join the Ubuntu Dapper fanboy
network. Did an upgrade from Breezy last night, and yeah, it was everything
I expected to be. Smooth. The desktop looks very slick. Me thinks, the
future Desktop OS wars wouldn't be Windoze vs. OS X. I think it would be OS
X vs. Ubuntu ;-). Ok, I have donned the asbestos suit ;-)

I had run the command #rm -rf ~ instead of #rm -rf *~, but this command 
is not from /root . It is from /root/xxx/yyyy. And the effect is  not 
immediate.

I had also lost the files .bash_profile and .bashrc.
I had copied these two files from other system and tried. Now it is  is 
working fine.
But i didnt understand how deleting the tilt in a sub-directory inside 
the /root affected  these files.

Thank u prashanth and balaji narayanan.

thanks

Here is more for those who missed the event: The talk was with special 
focus on reporting bugs to developers - a useful activity which almost 
any free software user can do if an application crashes. 

Bugzilla is generally associated with tracking Mozilla bugs, but the 
idea has caught on and others have adopted the tool.  Every major distro 
or application has bugzilla running from a sub domain that would be the 
first place to report a bug.  examples are bugzilla.redhat.com 
bugzilla.gnome.org    https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/ (ok, they have moved 
to using malone https://launchpad.net/malone)  etc

http://www.pastebin.com is a useful site that provides a facility to 
share error reports and for debugging code.  The basic idea is to dump 
the error messages at pastbin.com, get a tiny url link to your post, and 
use it as reference to track and discuss the problem with others.  
Nagappan gave a live demo on how to file a bug report with pastebin.com 
and  bugzilla.  He showed a bug report filed by Prashanth Mohan, and how 
the feedback to "replay" the the bug helps the developer to identify 
possible issues and offer a patch.  Prashanth Mohan wrote a minimal 
program to demo these activities.

Nagappan then explained how the accessibility libraries and daemon could 
be used to automate tracking of bugs in the ui.  Accessibility tools 
could be used by users who need it, and it also enables tracking of bugs 
in the ui to test if an application itself is suffering from 
disabilities.  At present applications like Mozilla, and OpenOffice and 
any program using jawa swing/java foundation classes could be tracked 
this way.

At a lighter moment, he said, all of them in the room probably know 'C' 
programming except "him" (that is 'me' :)  Of course, I know no c and 
wish to forget the little php or js I have forced myself to learn too.  
(Both  are not very hard things to do - as I discover that from time to 
time) The basic strategy should be to train computer programs to write 
code. php-mode.el tells emacs how to indent the php code I write, but it 
would be better if it could write php or c code for itself.  Btw, 
Nagappan's college mate, Anand Babu, gave an introduction to guile last 
year, at a GNU Vidyashram session at Ma Foi Academy,  and one of the key 
points I still remember is that "C" is a language written with machines 
in mind, and not exactly the right language to start life with, 
particularly if you are for beginners.  Anyway, I would rather leave it 
to the machine itself to decide if it wants to code in c, lisp or 
whatever - and that may be the only way to an environment that is free 
from bugs.

There were other talks I got to attend that morning:

Rahul Sundaram made a presentation on contributing to FOSS, with the 
Fedora community as an example.  He also mentioned his participation in 
the One Laptop Per Child - OLPC project. 

Bharathi spoke about embedded solutions in FOSS.  An amazing array of 
tools are available to cater to the needs of the industry using minimal 
hardware to save costs for communication devices like phones, mobiles 
etc.  Rahul started his talk with how Linus made the decision not to 
fork the kernel project to create specialised kernels for embedded or 
super computer needs and that has helped to make better design 
decisions. The special appl. merely strip down the kernel and load other 
modules.  qemu and other emulators are available to mimic the required 
hardware for testing purposes.  Bharathi explained the layers in 
embedded software with a few clear slides.

Ma. Sivakumar, who contributed to zha - the Tamil localization project,  
talked about his background in leather technology and industry, and how 
he is building an erp solution for the industry, using FOSS, through 
trial (& *error* ;) He had plenty of tips for the young entrepreneurs on 
how to build their contacts and market.

I made a brief presentation on FOSS Licenses. "FOSS" usually expands as 
"Free and Open Source Software" but it would better to expand it as 
"Free and Open Standards and Software" to avoid redundancy and make it 
more meaningful.  The chief highlight of a FOSS system is that it uses 
open standards like TCP/IP, POSIX, ANSI C, SQL http/1.1, the various W3C 
standards for html, css, xml, dom etc and free implementations thereof 
like linux, much of the gnu project, apache web server, firefox, mozilla 
etc .  I took the participants briefly through the FOSS licenses widely 
used: the GNU GPL, LGPL, FDL, and some of the BSD like licenses for 
FreeBSD, PostgreSQL, and the Apache and PHP licenses. 
I pointed to some of the bugs in the licenses, typically, the conditions 
or trend to prevent free use of the name of the program that is 
preventing wider use of free software.  This is an ironical tragedy - 
the software itself is free but its name is not so free and would 
probably rank the number one reason why FOSS still remains obscure and  
within a small circle of people hidden from the vast majority.

To put it simply, ~ is the currently logged in user's home directory
as listed in /etc/passwd, irrespective of where you used it in your

No point in complaining about spam originating from Korea. Report the
email as spam from within gmail. If you want, you can also report it
via spamcop.

more details please :) afaik, debian uses ubuntu's packages as the
first step for many of the releases (esp. the big ones, like the
recent Xorg 7 which migrated to testing), and then tweaks and modifies
them further till it's own set of stringent norms are met. i am not
really sure of how things go on internally (may be the Debian X Strike
Force created the packages which were taken up by Ubuntu?), but
shouldn't all this mean that Ubuntu's debs are somewhat close to how
vanilla Debian's debs are built and packaged?

and btw, since every1 is making a stand :D ... i have nothing against
Ubuntu, but i am content with the vanilla. would love to see what
Ubuntu had achieved in Dapper, but i don't think I can make it to the
meeting, being out of station...

it moves on...

Me too out of station this week for a vacation. Seeing the response hope I
am able to make it to the meet. Am landing in Chennai around 3 in the
afternoon. Hope to make it to the meet by 4:30 PM atleast [if it will go
till then].. If I come I will show what Ubuntu and it latest Dapper is all
about. Will share my personal experience of contributing to Ubuntu,  How
sync happens between the "Debian" community and the "Ubuntu" community and
lots of other details which you guys might have. Suresh could be able to
share more I guess.

No wonder by Xorg drivers blew when I upgraded to Xorg 7!

On a related note, I hope everyone here remembers that Ubuntu has
often drawn flak for their non-support to migrate patches to the
parent Debian packages. Many Debian developers who aren't Ubuntu
developers often complain about the fact that incompatibilites in the
Debian and Ubuntu packages and not enough cooperation doesn't help
them get the patches easily.

That is, Ubuntu has made no attempt to maintain the Debian packaging
guidelines per se. Also, notice that among all the biggies in the DCA
Common Alliance (Yes, it's a recursive acronym), Ubuntu is missing!
Shows what little respect Shuttleworth has for Ubuntu's parent
project? I certainly think so.

(BTW above statements are best to my knowledge. Please feel free to
correct them, and I don't mean to offend anyone!).

Well, I said so, didn't I? Many Debian developers don't like Ubuntu
for various reasons, foremost of which is the way packages are built.

And though I don't have any problems with Ubuntu being number one at
DistroWatch, I don't like their way of rating distros by number of
views of that distro page. For one, I have read somewhere (sorry, I
can't find that at the moment) that Ubuntu fanatics were respnsible
for "making" Ubuntu number one etc.

But, all said and done, the last time I tried Ubuntu, it seemed very
straightforward to me. It cannot be denied that the Ubuntu people have
done a fantastic job! But the whole concept of Debian and Ubuntu are
different, as is pointed out in the above article.

I'm just telling you what a couple of the guys I met told me

I simply use ubuntu .. still dont like using (for example) debconf, or 
other debian specific tools more than necessary.

Ubuntu seems to have got a slicker UI among other things .. and a 
slightly more usable config interface for users.

I use a Redhat 9 box with Dataone connection. My modem model is
SmartAX MT-800. I downloaded and installed rppppoe. But i'm not able
to figure out what i should set for DNS server and stuff like that.
Someone please give me pointers to some page which gives information
about configuring rpppoe to get my dataone connection working.

Finally, I found a solution. I pulled out the ethernet card from my old comp
and stuck it in. I guess the problem is with the nForce ethernet drivers.

hi,
           Any body can tell exactly how linux detects hardware and give information to respective applications.For example we are using 
 
 hotplug
 udev
 hal
 pmount
 gnopme-volume-manager
 discover
 hwdata
 hwsetup
 
 so which pacakge is exactly used for detectding hardware
 Take a example of USB stick..what minimum pacakages are needed to detect a usb mountit,pop up in nautilus window and show the desktop icon.I need sequential steps

Redhat 7.1 ISOs are available at:

ftp://archive.download.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/7.1/en/iso/i386

PCQLinux 7.1 can be re-created by running sed -e s/redhat/pcqlinux/g :)

The device name is /dev/xsysace as you could see in the fdisk command 
line .
I have tried with both xsysace and xsysace1. The output is as follows:

root@local xilinx_sysace]#mount -t msdos /dev/xsysace1 /mnt/fat16
mount: special device /dev/xsysace1 does not exist
root@local xilinx_sysace]#
root@local xilinx_sysace]#

[root@local xilinx_sysace]# mount -t msdos /dev/xsysace /mnt/fat16
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/xsysace,
       or too many mounted file systems
[root@local xilinx_sysace]#

I could see the msdos and vfat support in "lsmod"
[root@local root]# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by    Tainted: GF
msdos                   8140   0  (autoclean)

Pl help me .

And also break/delete some critical rpms. The zlib related rpms were
omitted in PCQlinux 7.1.

Hi,
   My friend is a BSc graduate and currently doing MCA in
correspondence. He is working as a Team Leader in a BPO. If he has to
switch over to Linux as his career, will RHCE certification alone help
with out technical background. If yes, can you pls suggest the
training centres available for providing RHCE certification courses
which will also provide job assurance. Or can you give us any other
better alternative.

waiting for an earliest reply,
Thanks in advance,

Hi,
Im trying to use ImageMagick to resize and save image files through perl.
Works fine with gif format but when it comes to JPEG
I get the error message:
"No decode delegate for this format".
I tried with the following versions of ImageMagick :
ImageMagick-5.5.7
ImageMagick-6.2.4
ImageMagick-6.2.7

Can anyone help with getting ImageMagick to recognize JPG format?
Thanks in advance,

What OS? What does your favourite package manager say for libjpeg (on
Redhat/Fedora, rpm -q libjpeg)?

So - what does it take to make a very simple logical deduction from 
Binand's question instead of simply answering it?

Install it then
And try your commands again

I want to move some 10 or 20 files with the mv command to one directory. But if the file names are long the number of characters in the command line is also more and it is not allowing me to add more files to the list. 
   
  Is there any parameter that can be changed to overcome this

This is one of those Unix IAQs. For Linux, you can:

find /path/to/dir -stuff that -lists your -files | xargs mv
--target-directory=/path/to/new/dir

Make sure the find lists only files that you are interested in. Also,
use find as:

find whatever -print0 | xargs -0 whatever

(Read respective manpages to figure out why).

OK. So now you know where your problem is.

Now, I have a follow-up question. How did you end up in this situation
in the first place? You installed ImageMagick via rpm -ivh --force,
right?

most systems have a limit on the size of the command line. on
gnu/linux, i guess it is 32676 characters or something like that
(./configure usually checks for that).. this limit is not
configurable, but i am sure having 20 files will not cross this limit.
please check if your shell has a problem displaying arguments with
more than a screen line on the terminal. (i think bash had this
problem of not being able to edit previous lines, once you enter an
additional line... i dont use bash now, so i don't know if that bug is
still there...i don't have any problems with multi-line editing on
zsh). if u want to go for more than the upper limit, sorry, out of
luck. you might have to use xargs.

it moves on...

Hi,
     We are supporting US client who has got problem with the spam

still spam mails are increasing due to which mail server is getting

Hi,

No! RHCE is merely a certification that assures that the candidate has skills
and capability to work on "RedHat Linux" distributions. Without technical 
background, it might be difficult to pass through RHCE exams.

What should your friend be doing ?
1. Spend enough time (1 to 2 months, 4 hours a day atleast) regularly
   working on Linux platform. Start from the basics, understanding the 
   shell, then about the filesystems, commands and utilities, package
   management and so on. A good book/online reference should help
   in order to stay in focus. I strongly suggest the following book:
        RUTE User's Tutorial and Exposition 
        [http://rute.2038bug.com/index.html.gz]
   The time your friend needs to spend might vary depending on his
   skills and capability. 

2. Start browsing through http://www.tldp.org/, download and read
   howto documents and guides of interest. Try and get comfortable
   on Linux as a power-user.

3. Learn fundamental concepts in networking (covered a bit in the earlier
    book). Learn networking relevant commands on Linux. The Linux
    Network Administrator's Guide should also serve as a good start.

4. Browse through Linux mailing list archives, subscribe to the local Linux
   User's Group (ILUGC for example) and participate on events.

5. Learn system and network administration concepts relevant to RHCE,
   and fine-tune skillsets. If needed, browse through CBTs, RHCE training
   materials and attempt mock exams.

Now, your friend should be ready to face RHCE exams. But the journey
doesn't end there - its only a start. Once, your friend does pass RHCE
exams, he/she will need to constantly update skills to the current trend
and technologies and focus on specific topic of interest like - Database
Administration, Mail administration, Network Management, 
Web administration and so on. 

What's most important is that your friend needs to be highly competent
on fundamental concepts (the foundation) on Linux and be able to learn
new things quickly.

If your friend aims to be a System Administrator, having multiple 
certifications would help more (RHCE+CCNA+MCSE - for example), as most
system administrators are expected to know different platforms these days.

Only if your friend isn't a good self-learner, that he/she needs to look out
for coaching centres/training institutes to get proper guidance. Ask around
from the students of various coaching centres to judge which one's good.

If

1. He's already using brightmail
2. You still have to ask and dont know what to do about it

You're probably not going to be able to do anything about it

A careful choice of blocklists, and moving as much as possible of the 
spam filtering to the edge of your network to start with would be an idea ..

Add to that,

3. If you are getting paid by your US customer, and you still have to
ask on a mailing list, you better not let the customer find out about
this. :)

In any case, when I faced this problem few months ago, what I did was
to have an offline discussion with several "industry contacts" (Suresh
included), evaluated several vendors, and ultimately got management to
shell out $$$ for a HA pair of IronPort C300 boxes -
http://www.ironport.com/products/ironport_c300.html. It has been peace
of mind and happy customers since then.

Keep in mind that without spam filtering just buying higher capacity 
mailserver appliances wont help .. the volume of spam will just increase 
and saturate your fancy ironports real fast [yes, it takes a lot of spam 
to do that .. but it can be done, i've seen it done]

Oh yes, I fully understand that. But then again, this risk was weighed
against the risk of hitting false positives in any RBL, and a business
decision was made not to use RBLs. A mitigating circumstance found
during this risk analysis was that IronPort's Reputation Filtering
system already factors RBL listings into it.

I don't take business decisions here, I reccommend and implement them. :)

Look .. she's already using brightmail.  And that's carrier / freemail 
class (hotmail uses it for example, as do several other ISPs)

If they can afford to pay for brightmail they'd probably scale a bit 
beyond ASSP.  And I'd suggest Spamassassin instead of ASSP myself but at 
the sort of loads I'm thinking about .. you'd have to triple h/w 
capacity -- several racks worth -- to do that

hi,
I have used rpppoe but don't remember it now.
I will give you a alternative way to configure your Dataone Connection.
You can configure your connection through your MT800 Configuration Manager
GUI.

Note: If you have used the Dataone connection in windows without dialling a 
connection
you can skip the first four points and straight away go to the fifth point.  
Once it is configured
like this, you won't have to dial your Dataone Connection in windows also. 
You can start browsing
as soon as the ADSL link status indicator turn amber coloured.

1. Your CPE by default has a IP address of 192.168.1.1 . Configure your 
ethernet card
to have a address in the same subnet (for e.g. 192.168.1.5) with a subnet 
mask of 255.255.255.0 .

2. Now start your browser and type 192.168.1.1 in the address bar and press 
enter. A dialog box will
appear asking for user name and password. The default username and password 
is 'admin' (without the quotes. User name and Password are same by default). 
If you have changed the password type in that password instead of 'admin". 
Now you will be shown a Configuration interface of the CPE.

3. Click the ATM Setting link the left frame. You will be shown the ATM 
Setting page. Change the "connection type" to 'ppp' and "PPPoA/PPPoE" field 
to 'PPPoE'. Make sure that the 'enable' option is selected in the "Default 
Route" field.  Next give the User name and Password you used to connect in 
the respective fields. The "Use DNS" field must have the 'enable' option 
selected. Click the small lens icon in the status field. It will pop up a 
window. In the window select the 'start on Data' option for the "Change 
Status" field. Click the submit button in the pop up window and also the ATM 
Settings page.

4. You have to save the configuration and reboot your CPE for the changes to 
take effect. Click on the save and reboot link in the left frame and follow 
the instructions. Once you have rebooted the CPE, wait till the ADSL Link in 
the CPE to turn amber colour. Again go to the MT800 Configuration Manager 
and check the status of the WAN interfaces. If you are connected then you 
will have a IP address and gateway address (not 0.0.0.0).

5. Now go to your LAN interface settings and set the Primary DNS to 
192.168.1.1 and Default Gateway Address to 192.168.1.1 .

Start your browser and check whether you can browse the Internet.

Message-ID: <a2de783d0606080143m167bd561m74c9c4db7feae04c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

  I try to write some data in Blu-ray RE disc with
  syscall write(). But I got the message as Read Only file system.
  I tried with dd also, got the same message.

  I tried in windows, I was able to write.

  What could be the reason ? Any idea ?

Vivek

I would first like to build a bare minimal OS with a basic toolchain and
later make it more usable by adding things like a web browser mail client
etc...

Make sure the find lists only files that you are interested in. Also,
use find as:

find whatever -print0 | xargs -0 whatever

(Read respective manpages to figure out why).

Hi,

This is probably OT as it has nothing to do with Linux.

Why should I store my Firefox passwords on Google?  Google knows
enough about me already.

I've been a loyal Google user for the last 6 years, and now I can't stand
Google's half-baked and unfinished products any more. Calendar,
Bookmarks/Toolbar, Notebook, Spreadsheet all suck.  Not to forget the
abuse of "Beta".  Labs seems directionless. Maps was the last cool product.

Hi Jeyaram,
Gnuplot is not that much user-friendly or more customizable to generate the graphs.
I recommend jfreechart(in java) which gives you a set of libraries, so that you can progam it and get cool,variety of charts.
You need to be a  java programmer for this.

Thanks and Regards,
Karthick P

Debian's release cycle and Google's release cycles are entirely different.

Along with testing/unstable streams, Debian has always produced stable
releases.

It's been more than 2 years since GMail appeared and it's still Beta.  Where
is the stable release of GMail?  Google Finance, Talk, etc. have not produced
any stable releases either.

Abuse?  Debian unstable/testing sounds pretty much the same to me. And I
wouldn't say abuse.

You are basing your prejudices only upon the dictionary meanings of
beta and stable. How does it matter to you, whether they call it Gmail
or Gmail Beta or Gmail XP or Gmail Woody or whatever?

I suppose Chennai LUG is meant for Linux and anything that runs on
Linux irrespective of Free or Open Source, and anything that interacts
with Linux. Given that definition, and the facts Firefox runs on Linux
and the Browser Sync extension "runs on" Firefox, your post is
on-topic.

If I were to object to your post, it would be about your track record
of snarfing stuff off Slashdot's main page and posting them here. But
that is only me.

Calling it "Beta" rather than woody/XP/etc is a little different in 
software development.

Perhaps you can see the definition of "Beta" here:

I guess it's got more to do with what you call Beta. After all, Wine
entered beta from alpha only recently, after god knows how many years!
(ten? just guessing :) )

it moves on...

I would love to test Alpha/Beta quality software any day.  I don't run 
the most stable version of Firefox/Thunderbird.  I compile new versions 
twice a week :-)

It doesn't mean stable software has no bugs.  There might be some use 
cases that might not be tested during the beta testing.

Beta testing just ensures that there are no obvious bugs ;-)

Debian Woody which was stable long time, didn't boot on my PowerPC. 
Only Sarge did.

Typically, software development goes through these phases:

1. Pre-alpha - interfaces are developed, project roadmap is defined.
Features can be partially implemented, can change, can drop out
altogether, not suitable for anything except for the developers
themselves.

2. Alpha - The project roadmap and the interfaces etc. are all defined
at the beginning of this stage, full speed coding ahead. Features etc.
will not change. Unit tests are run. Might run some regression tests.

3. Beta - Development completed, active testing/QA. Regression
testing, stress testing, bugs fixed etc. Features or roadmap won't
change.

4. Release - software available for public use. The CVS tree is tagged
and branched off. Bug fixes are applied to the branch, with
occassional merges to the trunk.

Release doesn't mean it is 100% bug-free - it just means that the
release has gone through a resource-contrained QA environment, and
some amount of regression, stress and other testing have been done. It
certainly cannot handle the myriad of possible deployment scenarios,
and hence bugs do come up after releases, which need to be fixed.

Hi Group


Is there any possibility of restricting access to a person from sending
email to
*                allusers @<cmpy name >.com *

That is

Can we set filters or permissions to an email so that he/she can/cannot
send email to a particular email id.

*Eg :*

      Normal Employee should not send any email  to  all@<cmpy>.com
      and if he /she is trying to send then  the  email should revert back
to his email id .
      ( ie., the from address)


       Company's CEO , VP  etc  should be able to send email to
all@<cmpy>.com


I hope that i have made my question clear.

Awaiting  reply
Thanks in advance

Why dont you setup mailman as a mailing list manager, and create

That way you can define posting rights etc

And then i ran a wvdial...it goes and initialized and Wating for a
carrier signal..

Here you go: http://www.mepis.org/ [SimplyMEPIS]

Worked right out of the box for me, and played music(mp3)/videos
(while I tested the old version - 3.3.1 that is). It comes with an easy
to use installer too. 

You could also use Ubuntu/Kubuntu - just that getting it to play
your MP3 songs would require some extra effort.

Cheers!

Try out any of the Debian based distros, though I'd recommend Debian
Sarge. It has support for MP3s et al. If you would like to spend a few
minutes searching on how to get MP3 working on other distros, I would
also recommend Fedora Core, as it closely follows RedHat standards.

I am no tech guru, but I can tell you this: DON'T confine yourself to
one distribution. Though you may like one, and prefer it over others,
please do know that there are other options, and people getting work
done in other ways. Get an idea of everything, then choose one
distribution.

Try one distro for a few months, then go on to another, and so on till you 
find one that you're comfortable with. That way, you'll find a good distro, 
and you'll have working knowledge of many...

<distro-plug>While you're at it, if you have a fast connection with a liberal 
download limit (read, no limit at all ;-) ), why not try Gentoo 
(www.gentoo.org)? It's basically a developer's distro, and good for learning 
things with. Installing it is a learning experience in itself, and you'll be 
able to experiment to your heart's content. I've got virtually everything 
(music, graphics card support for NVidia, and so on) without too much 
headache. As long as you can stomach long compile times, Gentoo is quite 
nice. </distro-plug>

You seem to have a very developer-centric approach to Linux (which is
excellent). I can't advice you on what distribution to start off with,
but irrespective of the distro you start with I guess you'll finally
end up with Debian-unstable
(http://www.debian.org/releases/unstable/). That's where you will find
all the development libraries under the sun.

For now, you can consider Ubuntu 6.06 LTS which is excellent for a newbie.

It's very important that the first distro for a newbie is a popular
one as support in the LUG-community is usually not a problem.

just my 0.02$

Hi All,

LinuXpert Systems, which was started in August 2003 has been
promoting/providing FOSS based solutions to the educational, business and
Government organizations.  We have huge collection of FOSS softwares of
about more than 400 GB as ISOs
(www.chennailug.org/wiki/CDs_for_Grab#Pazhavanthangal) and also distributed
so many free CDs to academic institutions.  As a Promoter, I have conducted
FOSS based seminars in more than 50 Institutions in Tamilnadu and also
conducted many onsite training courses in colleges.  

In order to provide better and stronger education on FOSS, we are starting
LinuXpert Academy focusing to empower the usage of Linux/Open Source
Softwares in the entire rural area of Tamilnadu.

LinuXpert invites everyone to share this glorious moment and we look for
active people to distribute our FOSS collection of softwares throughout
Tamilnadu and take FOSS into our education system more stronger and wider.

Regards.

Baskar.
LinuXpert Systems

(Note: I have personally collected/downloaded all the linux kernel version
source code starting from the historic 0.01 to the latest 2.6.16.20) in 3 DVDs.

If you are bashing Google for unfinished  products,   I don't  find theirs
unfinished except for the tagging BETA to the name of the product. This is
strictly speaking from a user's perspective who simply use it. There could
be and would be bug if ppl look for it. As a user who does not do QA on
Google's product , I find it good as another released product if not better.

Two years or whatever,  the goal is the good, betta quality when it's
released.  Isn't Gmail the  most convenient way to  read ilugc list  :-)
Google makes a difference.

Would your friend do so because of passion (with Linux) or better
opportunity?  If you look at this list, my assumption is that many of them
are people with years of experience in industry, men with  kids,
responsibilities @ work and @ home. They still find time to regularly
participate in the list. I so strongly the main reason is because they are
passionate about it.

Remember those days when everyone wants  to learn Java.

Same time, I have seen people with passion, switching to tech and really
doing well.

There are a few like that but the majority of people on this list are in 
the 18-30 age group (or maybe the 25-35 age group)

Well, by the time one is 30, one would have about 6-8 years of work
experience, would have been married for 3-5 years, with at least one
kid - if one is from a typical Indian middle-class background. So
aren't you both essentially saying the same thing?

Dear All,

Nearly 6 months back, Myslef and Joe meet Mr Umashankar. At that time
itself, We discussed about this following plan. I feel, It is a good
oppurtunity to spread FOSS in gov operations and get Gov support for
our movement. So Just go thru and think, What you can do for this as
a Volunteer (+ Partner).

---------- Original Message --------
Subject: Call for OSS partnership and support // LUGs may join ELCOT's
         efforts (Date: Sat, June 10, 2006 9:16PM)

TamilNadu is one of the pioneers in the use of OSS. Already 6500
computers have reached the village panchayats in linux environment
under Panchayat computerisation programme.  It is heartening to note
that almost all the young IAS officers want only OSS be promoted in
their respective offices/jurisdiction. This calls for a quick and
efficient role from ELCOT to support the current initiatives of Govt
of TN in the area of OSS.

ELCOT looks for partners and volunteers who can join ELCOT's efforts
to promote OSS in  Government functioning.  Already certain companies
have expressed willingness to join.

ELCOT is shortly setting up an open source support centre in its
corporate office to support government organisations adopting OSS. The
support would be for OS (OpenSUSE & FC5), DB (PostgreSQL) and
OpenOffice.org suite.  ELCOT needs large number of OSS volunteers to
make this initiative a public owned effort. ELCOT runs a call centre.
This would be upgraded to include support for OSS queries. A website
needs to be built to support the volunteers who wish to join the
effort. ELCOT is shortly finalising a vendor for the web portal
development for this.

LUGs from Chennai and other areas are requested to join the nitiative.

C.Umashankar IAS., MD ELCOT

Mankind deserves open standards and open source software. Only the
chosen ones get its taste. Others just hear the taste.

HI all,

Some of you might remember Natarajan Kannan's  and my work with the
LiveURL's extension[1]. We thanks everyone for the feedback[2]. Some
of the feature requests were:

1. Ability to highlight and bookmark content so that when a user
revists the page the next time the "state" of the web-page is retained
and the user is able to identify which is the important content he had
earlier marked through highlights.

2. Ability to highlight multiple sections of a webpage.

3. Ability to navigate between multiple highlights.

4. Ability to clear a highlight without reloading the page.

Presenting to you, the next avatar of liveurls, WEB-MARKER![3]
Go ahead install it, play with it and drop in your feedback.
Also,remember to uninstall the old liveurls extension before
installing web-marker. Liveurls development will be discontinued. If
you find web-marker useful(or useless) drop in a rating for the
extension at the web-marker homepage.

A search for "speech recognition" in

Hi,

Is there any tool to convert the ext3 FS to Reiser FS?
How do I select Reiser FS while formatting the hard disk
or during a new installation.

Thanks & Regards,

Message-ID: <20060612094832.23057.qmail@server301.com>

Hi,

>  Is there any tool to convert the ext3 FS to Reiser FS?

No. You might need to create a new partition with reiserfs
filesystem and migrate all data from your existing ext3 partition
to the newly created reiserfs partition.

>  How do I select Reiser FS while formatting the hard disk
>  or during a new installation.

Create a new filesystem using the 'mkreiserfs' (also named as
'mkfs.reiserfs' in most distributions) command as super-user.

For example, type the following:
    /sbin/mkreiserfs /dev/hda3
as super-user (AT YOUR RISK) to create a new reiserfs 
filesystem on your /dev/hda3 partition. 

Make sure that your kernel has support for reiserfs, and 
also that you have reiserfstools package installed before 
you proceed. Check with your Linux distribution's package
repository and also the kernel config.

AFAIK, RedHat Linux (and Fedora Core) does not support 
installation on reiserfs partition out of the box. Other 
distributions like Debian and its derivates (Ubuntu, Knoppix, 
MEPIS, etc), Slackware, Mandrake, SuSE and Gentoo support 
installation onto reiserfs filesystem as an option.

Cheers,

This should help. Stick the following line in /etc/apt/apt.conf *

Acquire::http::Proxy "http://username:password@proxy:port_no";
(change parameters accordingly)

Alternately you could also use the $http_proxy env var to set the
proxy and apt should pick it up. Of late(debian-sid) this doesnt seem
to be working[1].

Friends.

I cant view the unicode tamil fonts Fully in firefox.
The tamil pages in http://chennailug.org/wiki,
look like the letters are seperated.
But, I can see them correctly using Konqueror.
In both browsers, the default font encoding is utf-8 only.

What I have to do to view unicode tamil fully in firefox?

Thanks.

Nice list.  Another interesting product that Google bought over is
SketchUp (sketchup.google.com).  SketchUp has a Ruby API!

Sad that the company now depends on acquisition for its innovation.
Reminds me of a certain company from Redmond.

Huh?? FUD, FUD and more FUD. http://labs.google.com/

In any case, I can't see why it is sad that a company acquires other

A look at
    info coreutils common\ options
tells us that:
<quote>
Certain options are available in all of these programs.  Rather than
writing identical descriptions for each of the programs, they are
described here.  (In fact, every GNU program accepts (or should
accept) these options.)
...
`--'
     Delimit the option list.  Later arguments, if any, are treated as
operands even if they begin with `-'.  For example, `sort -- -r' reads
from the file named `-r'.

Which Firefox? Which distribution?

I use suse10 in a PC and suse9.3 in another.
Firefox 1.5 and 2(Bon echo), and Flock 0.7, opera 9

Only Konqueror shows nice tamil unicode fonts.
Others show with some seperated literals.

Any clue?

mostly the firefox binary from mozilla.com does not have Indic
support. so u cannot view tamil properly though u have tamil fonts. i
have the latest version of firefox 2 alpha release
here http://balachandar.net/node/138. hope u can use this and install
it in ur system and u could view any indian language site along with
the fonts preinstalled in ur system

Hi Gurus,
             Am trying to connect my mobile (Sony Eric k300i) to Linux and
plan to use it as my modem. I compiled the kernel with cp2101 module for USB
Serial communication (my data cable driver). But I guess I require some
assistance in configuring my PPPd.
            Linux identifies the data cable and assigns to ttyUSB0 and using
wvdial I'm able to communicate with the mobile. After dialing the number
PPPd reports (syslog)  that (LAC request expired). Following are my
configurations:

/etc/ppp/peers/gprs:

lcp-echo-failure 0
lcp-echo-interval 0
nodetach
debug
show-password
connect "/usr/local/bin/wvdial --chat --config /etc/ppp/peers/gprs-
wvdial.conf airtel"
disconnect /etc/ppp/peers/gprs-disconnect-chat
/dev/ttyUSB0 # USB serial device
115200
crtscts
local
:192.168.1.3
noipdefault
ipcp-accept-local
defaultroute
usepeerdns
novj
nobsdcomp
novjccomp
nopcomp
noaccomp
noauth
nomagic


/etc/ppp/peers/gprs-wvdial.conf

[Dialer  airtel]
Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0
Baud = 115200
Init1 = ATH
Init2 = ATE1
Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","airtelgprs.com","0.0.0.0",0,0
Dial Command = ATD
Phone = *99***1\#
Stupid Mode = yes


My ISP is Airtel. Has anybody faced such problem? Have I missed out
something?
 I works well in Windows then why not Linux where am I going wrong?

Regards

when I had tried FC3, I remember passing `linux reiserfs` to the boot

Folks,
         FWIW, Google Earth Version 4 Beta is now available
for Linux. Unfortunately, it's a binary-only release, in a proprietary
packaging format (no rpms or debs), but it's still a start. With this,
another major app that required me to access Windoze has
also been ported to GNU/Linux.

     I gave it a whirl on FC3/4, and it worked just fine - it does
require accelerated OpenGL drivers for best results with cards
like an NVidia GeForceX, but it still works fine with the stock
non-accelerated Xorg drivers.

   I took a quick peek at the Shevaroy Hills - too dark to
make out much, but it's all there. Go forth and download!

Proprietary packaging format, indeed. Your lack of knowledge of it
doesn't make it proprietary.

held in Bangkok, Thailand, from June 6-8, 2006. For detailed
coverage of the event see http://asia-commons.net

Asia Commons' goal was to bring together participants from
Asia-Pacific and around the world to discuss, explore and
collaborate around three key themes:

     * Access to Knowledge and Culture in Asia 
     * Models for Collaborative Knowledge and Culture 
     * Towards a Healthy Asia Commons

Asia Commons has some interesting perspectives, and their
ideals flow in close parallel to the Free/Open Source
Software (FOSS) movement.

Many resources exist on the conference themes, including:

* del.icio.us Links: Del.icio.us is a public collection of
web resources which anyone can contribute to. Resources added
(or 'bookmarked') in del.icio.us have been 'tagged' by their
contributors to describe the resource's content. Participants

ASIA-PACIFIC REPORTS
*************************************************************

Governments, Going Online and Macau

FROM MACAU, REPORT SAYS, "GOVERNMENTS GO ONLINE - WITHOUT
WINDOWS": Inter Press Service had this interesting report on
26 March 2006.

     "Developing countries can't afford to buy Windows-based
     software. The basic Windows operating system costs a
     year and half salary for the average Vietnamese
     citizen," said Mike Reed, director of the United Nations
     University International Institute for Software
     Technology.

Electronic governance promises to cut corruption and improve
transparency, and open source software offers a way to break
South Asia's technological dependence on industrialized
countries, experts say.

Open source software such as Linux is non-proprietary, less
complex, more efficient and freely available to anyone -
unlike Microsoft's (Nasdaq: MSFT) Windows operating system,
says Mike Reed, director of the United Nations University
International Institute for Software Technology (UNU-IIST),
based in Macau, China.

"Linux is now the fastest-growing software and powers eight
of the 10 fastest supercomputers in the world," Reed said.

Open source software like Linux is embedded in many types of
electronic devices, like mobile phones and cameras. Open
source is also starting to cut into the near complete
domination of the personal computer market by the Windows
operating system, he said.

"Developing countries can't afford to buy Windows-based
software. The basic Windows operating system costs a year and
half salary for the average Vietnamese citizen," he noted.

That's led to rampant theft or illegal copying Latest News
about illegal copying of Microsoft software. However, such
software cannot be modified or customized to meet local
needs. Companies and governments have no other choice than to
commission expensive custom programming from California's
Silicon Valley.

Open source, on the other hand, is easy to customize and not
particularly difficult to learn, says Reed. Although Linux
has been around for more than 10 years, only a few developing
countries like Brazil have a significant number of home-grown
open source programmers. Without local programmers, setting
up electronic governance - use of computer technology by
governments to improve public access to information and
services - becomes very expensive and difficult.

Access to computers is one major problem in the developing
world, and so is the lack of local programming projects so
that programmers can learn, says Reed.

Reducing Corruption

Vietnam is one exception. A few years ago, Vietnam launched
an ambitious effort to modernize, developing its own version
of Linux called Vietkeylinux, partnering with the computer
chip Latest News about computer chips manufacturer Intel
(Nasdaq: INTC) Latest News about Intel and moving to
electronic governance (e-governance).

"Vietnam has more things online than the U.S. government,"
Reed said.

Isolated Vietnamese villages now have public computer kiosks
where citizens can conduct business with the government
online, such as registering for birth certificates.

"That reduces mid- to low-level government corruption,
because it's easier to keep track of paperwork and everything
is visible and public," he said.

Government services are easier and cheaper to provide
electronically. Plus, such an electronic/information
infrastructure and expertise in these areas is crucial for a
country like Vietnam to successfully participate in the
global economy.

South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore are successful examples
of countries with low levels of corruption and high levels of
economic activity that other Asian countries are hoping to
emulate, Reed said.

The information revolution has been slow in reaching
two-thirds of the world, according to Darrell West, an
e-governance researcher at the Center for Public Policy at
Brown University in Providence, R.I.

"Many countries don't have the money, and some don't see the
benefits or have the desire to make the public sector open
and transparent," West told IPS.

Major Motivator

     In an exhaustive survey of the e-governance capabilities
     of 191 countries, West found that it is practically
     nonexistent in most African countries, as well as those
     in the Middle East. While money is the main problem in
     the former, the latter are dominated by "rich
     monarchical governments that have a very different view
     of public service and are not interested in
     e-governance," he said.

Although e-governance can reduce "street-level corruption,"
the biggest motivator for most countries is to improve their
economic development and boost their trade capacity, he said.
In the long term, West is optimistic. "Countries are
beginning to see the benefits and the cost reductions of
e-governance," he said. However, launching such initiatives
isn't easy and requires technical expertise, financing and
political leadership, Reed added.

It required a major two-year effort in the UNU home base of
Macau, on the coast of China. Among the most difficult parts
of moving to e-governance is getting government departments
to open up, share their information and cooperate with each
other, he said.

"It used to require permissions and licenses from 10
different agencies to start a business in Macau. Now, there
is just one online form," the researcher explained, and it
took a strong leadership that insisted government officials
make it happen.

The impoverished country of Nepal was on the verge of
achieving a good level of e-governance until the current
political strife erupted a year ago. Nepal's high level of
literacy and good mathematical education made it possible to
develop Nepalese programmers who, with UNU training and USD2
million in outside funding, built an open source e-governance
infrastructure.

Government Resource

E-governance in Nepal is effectively on hold now, said Reed.
This month, India announced an extremely ambitious national
e-governance plan to computerize data in public sector banks,
insurance companies and tax departments, create national
citizen databases, put passports, visas and immigration
information and data online, and much more. The two-year
effort is expected to cost USD1.5 billion.

To assist these e-governance attempts and to help other
countries get started, the UNU has established an interactive
information clearinghouse on the Internet that it calls
UneGov.net. In addition to having instructional how-to
materials online, the portal will make available software and
research papers, as well as contact information for others
who have or are setting up e-governance in their own
countries.

The World Bank is among funding agencies being approached.
Already, Vietnam is sharing some of its experience with
Nigeria, Reed said.

"People love to share their success stories," he concluded.

Feeds from Asia
http://feeds.goa-india.org
-------------------------------------------------------------
     WHAT IS ASIA talking about? You can keep track via
     http://feeds.goa-india.org -- a site for RSS feeds of
     mailing lists discussing (mainly) FOSS in Asia. If your
     Asia and FOSS-linked mailing list offers RSS feeds and
     is not yet listed here, please contact
     fred@bytesforall.org

DP's REVIEW: You must be aware of the fact (atleast by now)
that there exists many LUG (Linux User Groups) and FSUG (Free
Software User Groups) which have publicly available feeds of
their message archive. However the number of user
groups/communities are not only very large...it's hard to
find out which ones have online mailing lists...which among
these have opened their message archive for public preview
(i.e. a visitor can read the messages without joining the
group)...and finally, what might be the URL's of those mailng
lists? One simple answer is http://feeds.goa-india.org/

It's a simple website with the message subjectlines from
members of various LUG's, FSUG's etc. of India (and some more
countries of Asia) appearing in reverse chronological order
.... You can expand a subject line to read the summary (the
default abstract that a website exposes through it's RSS/Atom
channel) and also read the full article by clicking on the
appropriate link.

Although, this site itself doesn't archive feeds for more
than a week, it serves as the perfect LUG newspaper. You get
to see all the news, links, software from such a wide variety
of sources and yet at the same time, they are guaranteed
fresh..thanks to the RSS technology...umm format actually. :)

Last but not the least...joining more than one LUG is
sometimes not only necessary (to get in touch with a
community of people better geared towards answering queries
in certain fields of open source/linux) but also encouraged
to volunteer your help to more people than just those in your
own user group or community. We need to get discussions going
on here...so maybe we'd feature on
http://feeds.goa-india.org. ;)

Hope you find the resource timely and useful. Or atleast a
constructive way of enjoying leisure time. -- Diabolic

Spreading GNU/Linux the low-cost, human way
http://linuxdvdsale.tripod.com 
-------------------------------------------------------------
In India, bandwidth can still be an issue in many parts of
the country (apart from the bigger cities). In this context,
the best way to spread GNU/Linux software is to encourage
FOSS enthusiasts to replicate the same and sell the service
at a low-cost affordable price. One such example is Nelson
Lobo's http://linuxdvdsale.tripod.com (where, for India, a CD
costs a little over US$1 and a DVD under four dollars). Try
to replicate operations in your part of Asia. This could help
to make Free Software widely and affordably available.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Arellano reports in ITWorld Canada (12 May 2006) that Intel
hopes to gain a head start on untapped markets in the Third
World by launching World Ahead, a global programme that will
pour USD1 billion over the next five years to promote
computer training and Internet use in developing countries.
The Santa Clara, California-based company recently unveiled
its five-year project plan, which includes extending
broadband access to one billion users and training 10 million
teachers on the use of technology in education. A component
of the programme is the development of a USD400 mobile
personal computer, dubbed Eduwise, that will run on Microsoft
Windows or the Linux operating system. The World Ahead
Programme will also push adoption of WiMax wireless
technology that allows high throughput broadband connections
over long distances.

FOSS Scholarship in India
http://www.in.redhat.com/community/rhscholarship.php
-------------------------------------------------------------
Mayank Sharma in an interview in Newsforge says, "there is no
dearth of IT talent in India, but for a country that churns
out thousands of IT students every year, the number of Indian
contributors in the FOSS world is disproportionately low, due
in part to a lack of proper mentoring. To encourage more
students to go into FOSS development, the Kanwal Rekhi School
of Information Technology (KReSIT) at the Indian Institute of
Technology Bombay partners with Red Hat for an open source
scholarship challenge each year. Participants, mentored by
FOSS leaders, get the opportunity to work and collaborate to
solve a real-world problem, and the winners get a share of
the Rs. 1 million (about USD22,000) prize." [Source:

NEPAL FINDS ITS SOLUTIONS: From simplified Nepali typing...to
an OS is an article by Bal Krishna Bal, published in April
2006 on the Association for Progressive Communications blog.
Bal tells the story where it starts: "Somebody rightly said,
'Necessity is the mother of invention'. Had it not been for
the necessity felt by Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya(MPP) for the
electronically cataloging of its collection of books some
four years back, which was then not possible with the help of
the existing fonts of Nepali like Preeti and Kanchan, there
are doubts that MPP, a principal archiving house got involved
in developing software in Nepali." And what they achieved was
something quite unexpected.

Messaging Solution for SMEs in the Philippines

(Romania). AXIGEN Mail Server calls itself "a fast, scalable
messaging solution, perfectly adaptable to the communication
demands from both small and medium companies and Internet
services providers." Launched by the last fall, during Linux
World Expo in London, AXIGEN says it "succeeded until
nowadays to manage e-mails from over 300,000 mailboxes and to
be distributed worldwide through 10 valued partners." It
reached version 1.1 and operates on both Linux and FreeBSD.
AXIGEN Mail Server has been designed and created from scratch
by Gecad Technologies developers. Gecad Technologies has a
five-year history of expertise in technology research,
information security, project management and messaging
solutions. [Source: http://www.prleap.com/pr/34866/]

Take Responsibility for Something You Believe In... writes
Khairil Yusof in MyOSS Community of Malaysia
http://www.iosn.net/Members/kaeru/blog/being-involved
-------------------------------------------------------------
Let's be clear. MyOSS community consists of students and
developers. Hard pressed for time and other resources. Every
now and again, somebody comes up and says that the community
ought to do something. They've done a lot already:
http://my-opensource.org
http://www.my-opensource.org/oss-faq.html
http://myoss.iosn.net/ http://foss.org.my
Of course these students and developers should give up what
little personal time they have left to do what other people
tell them to do. I take this personally, because whenever
this comes up, it usually comes down to a few people (aizat,
ditesh, nsh) who do real things (papers, presenting at
conferences and talks, organising meetups). It's unfair to
ask any more of them. This won't be the last time we hear
such requests, but what I would like to see next time is
something along the lines, "I want to do this guys, and have
spent some time doing it and would like the community to help
me out." Taking responsibility for something you believe in
is a much better attitude, then just throwing it to the
"community."

There is a talk on Lisp which will take place in Bangalore on 16th of
July.  The possible topics are listed at the bottom of this mail.  The
speaker will be Rainer Joswig (of the LispM and dsl-in-lisp videos
fame).  Here is the entry on his blog talking about it:
http://lispm.dyndns.org/news?ID=NEWS-2006-06-09-1

Please do come if you are interested.  Further details will be posted
on "bangalore-lisp" (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bangalore-lisp/)

In case you want to brush up your Lisp skills, here are some good links:

Just a little follow up.  The talk won't be for absolute beginners, so
if you wanted to learn Lisp anyway, this will be a good time to start.
 The links above are the best introductions that I know of, so go on
... do it. :)

A week of reading will bring you up to speed ...

Hi 

 

I have configured a RH NIS master all went fine

 

I could ypcat from the NIS slave (solaris 9) and could see passwd and
othe maps.

 

But I could not logon from the salve using NIS user id I see the below
error message in /var/log/messages of NIS master

 

ypserv[9499]: refused connect from 10.61.200.35:32840 to procedure
ypproc_match (<domainname.com>,user_attr;-4)

 

Any one could help on this.

A couple of things come to mind:

Solaris NIS clients use unprivileged ports, but RedHat NIS server does
not like that.  See BUGS section for ypserv.conf man page.

IIRC, Solaris also has problems with md5 passwords, so you may have
to use vanilla crypt for password hashing on your NIS master.

I figured out the problem.

It's the shadow file Linux NIS does not support shadow only passwd file.

Hi,

I am new to KUbuntu. I installed Kubuntu successfully
but I want to enable NIS and Autofs. I am trying to
start/restart both the services in "GUI System
Services" but it shows as "not running" in the status
column. I also tried by command /etc/init.d/nis start
it is also not working.

Please help how to enable the services and how to
configure nis ie like "authconfig" in RedHat.

Thank you.

Babu. J

Message-ID: <ed2d3c000606160431j460ef4a3qffc4a7693cd04e4e@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

Warm greets, This year we are celebrating software freedom day on sept 16
'2006. This falls on a saturday. lets start preparing for it. I am in
correspondance with ELCOT - Chennai for MACHINE/VENUE Support. Mr. Uma
Shanker M.D elcot has given me an appointment for the same. I will update
you as and when development happens.

My personal opnion is that we will not ask any CD/T-Shirt support from
www.softwarefreedomday.org for this time. I beleive that all of us will be
with the saying of Mr.Raman that "Lets not Bleed our supporting
organisation". There was a thread asking for Rs10/- per CD as the consignee
spent for bribing the Constom dept. Even the customs dept made a difficult
task for me in  obtaining the open cd. After all it is wastage of time and
energy going behind these stuff.

So folks pitch in, We have enough time, lets start exploring with lots of
ideas to make the event great success as we did last year.

Sincerely
Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

1. what about a ilugc t-shirt ?? We planned for one during the 
tiruvannamalai LDD! :)

2. What kind of events are expected to be held... LDD ? Special talks ?

3. Think CDs are no longer a big issues, most people having unlimited 
braodband these days and a wide network for luggies offering help in 
CD-for-grab, don't think we need to ship ubuntu CDs.

This is not the case everywhere. Distributing CDs to the LUG members is not
the point. Distributing CDs to those who have not tried FLOSS / Distribute
CDs to those who are not aware in the first place about the power of FLOSS.
Its a matter of doing "Stuff" on the Freedom Day.  Unlimited BroadBand (most
people??) ! I strongly disagree. Not even 1% of INDIAs poplulation would
have unlimited broadband. [Guess most still use DialUp in Villages]

I seem to second that thought, there are folks even in the city
withour broadband.

Possibilities are more that folks using FLOSS will continue using &
exploring, its all about helping others have a feel of FLOSS.

1. T-Shirts are good.
2. Pendants/Rings/Any other suggestions for nice jewel (made of Silver
to start with?) promoting FLOSS.

Thoughts please...

We have indeed given a lot of Free CDs in the past, how far had it 
served the purpose. Am not meaning giving CDs within the LUG. Just 
giving out free CDs will serve no purpose. We can follow the same idea 
of burning out CDs during the LDDs for the really interestedt guys, who 
have/can get empty CDS.

We should use this opportunity to attract more school crowd, especially 
in the 9,10,11 and 12th standard category. We should chart out a plan 
such that rather than just showing things at numerous stalls, we reach 
more deeper into the crowd's minds... We can also try something like 
what we did in thiruvannamalai, where we trained some newbies to handle 
things, so that they learn the right way..

If 2 people out of 10 even tried to install it is good enough a achievement

If you were with the idea of distributing CDs to anyone and everyone who
comes and things like that then it is a *bad* idea. It is always about
asking and getting. Do you think everyone who asks for a CD goes back and
installs?? It is a strong NO.

Good one. 10 and 12  are out of question. May be 9 and 11

Then LDD will be one way.
@Raman,Srinivasan Please can you update us with how the Thiruvannamalai guys
are doing. What progress has there been after the LDD, etc?

I have already put my thinking caps on :-)

If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange them we both have

Dear Friends,

Warm greets, Mr.Gowri Shankar I.A.S  M.D of Elcot is ready to give support
for Free Open source software. I went to his office, In the verandah  There
was a tux picture which had the caption 'Futuristic Vision"  and in the
right side  of it it was "ELCOT" caption.I went inside his office, Out of
his hectic schedule he spared about 1 hour in discussing about the FLOSS. He
was giving me a demo of SUSE 10.1. It was indeed a good distro. He needs our
proposal , like what sort of support we require from his organiasation in
promoting FLOSS.I said that our organiasation lives on its own and we expect
material support in promoting FLOSS like conducting Linux demos/seminars.

I am attaching a scanned copy of his business card, You can see something
suprising. "We encourage open source softwares". Further he asked us to
praticipate in a yahoo group called egovindia deals about egovernance.

His business card is : http://www.penguinprogress.org/bcard.jpg
Egovindia web address is : http://groups.yahoo.com/group/eGovINDIA/

Thanking you,

Sincerely,
Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Friends.

I installed suse 10 on my friend's General Merchant shop.Grocery shop.

It is now a dual boot.
He uses windows for tally and some special software done in foxpro for
inventory, bill printing.

So, if we suggest any open source applications for accounts and inventory,
it will be nice.

Any of you have same experience?
Have you seen any software like this?

thanks,

Hi Prasanth,
I have open suse 10.1  5 cds. The cd grabs page is not editable for
quite some time.
It is not logging in. That is why I have not updated it. The site
administrator needs to set it right, it is due for quite some time. U
can find my contact info Under Cds for grab, T.Nagar. I also have
latest Kubunu 6.06

well, over a period of time, i guess any debian user will tend to
agree... there might be problems with debian, derivatives might have
been unfair to it, but it has ticked along all the while, and as long
as it continues to do so, we are happy sticking with it! :)

You can set your Tamil keyboard preferences in Gnome,

Better start learning. Spend atleast 15-25 minutes a
day doing typewriting lessons, at home. You don't need
to go to any institute. Ubuntu, for example, has good
localization support.

Since, lot of people are interested, I shall give you

discuss with Bharathi and let you know.

i am cc-ing the lug on this as i feel it is an important topic

my thesis is very simple:

1. By far the most succesful open source model has been the 'sell it,  
free it' model. This means that an application has been built for a  
specific customer and tested in practice and then opensourced. Very  
few successful open source applications are the 'scratch the itch'  
type where the developer feels something is needed (or he wants to do  
it). The important examples are koha and sql-ledger. (Although not  
succesful, avsap falls in this category as it was originally written  
for a wholesale merchant in the local bazaar and was in production  
for two years before it was released.)

2. In any field, there should be many competing applications  
available, as it is only in a competitive environment that a  
succesful application can be developed

3. There is huge demand for customised applications in india - some  
examples, online bus booking, supermarket billing, hotel booking and  
billing etc etc. Take a look at the crappy stuff KPN travels has  
purchased - couldnt we do better?

4. This demand is being serviced mostly by customised applications -  
the indian market is not very keen on readymade packages. Example is  
nestle, which gives its distributors a package that drives them  
crazy. (I had adapted avsap to mesh into amul's whole sale system)

5. So if you want to make a successful opensource application in  
India for any purpose, first find a customer, get him to pay you,  
build it to his satisfaction and then maybe generalise it and release  
it under an opensource license

A large percentage of Indian firms etc want to manipulate accounts -  
tally is excellent for this purpose - no other FA package caters to  
this need

This is scratching an itch. Do you have a customer? if you do, you  
will find it easier to write an app from scratch than to customise an  
existing package. We think and do business differently from people in  
the west. (This is not chauvinism, it is my experience at the grass  
roots)

Message-ID: <20060617051716.34297.qmail@web50213.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

I have started "One Day One Thirukkural", concept
similar to "One Day One Command" by Bharathi. This is
an example of using GNU/Linux to promote Thirukkural.

http://www.shakthimaan.com/ta/thirukkural.html

Of all the books on Thirukkural, I found the
&#2980;&#3007;&#2992;&#3009;&#2965;&#3021;&#2965;&#3009;&#2993;&#2995;&#3021;
&#2980;&#3014;&#2995;&#3007;&#2997;&#3009;&#2992;&#3016;
by Dr. M. Varadarasanar to be the best. 

I visited Mr. Muthukumaraswamy, Manager, The
Thirunelveli Southern India Saivasithananda
Publisher's Office in Alwarpet, Chennai who had
published the book. I convinced him that putting it on
the web was to promote Thirukkural, and also to show
people how we can use GNU/Linux for the same. His only
request was that users shouldn't print it in any form,
and sell it in hard copies.

He is also in touch with Dr. Kalyanakrishnan and his
team at IIT-M, who are working on multi-lingual
support.

http://acharya.iitm.ac.in/summary.html

For the english translation, I found Thirukkural,
English translation by Sri. V. V. S. Aiyar to be the
best. This is published by Ramakrishnan Tapovanam,
Thiruprayathurai, Tiruchirappali. I sent them a
snail-mail, and I was extremely happy to receive an
inland post-card reply from them giving permission to
publish the english translation online for
non-commercial use. I shall scan the approvals and
upload the same.

Regards,

SK

Message-ID: <2A1A6E935323B04BB28608B01B9B077A025E4D57@CHN-SNR-MBX01.wipro.com>


Hi All,

Can somebody explain me how to add a new protocol type in socket?

            The requirement is I need to have a heart beat running
between two cards. Since the Heart beat is exchanged at very high
speed(typically at a speed of 20 Hz).

            And I need to process the heartbeat also, So I cann't
process each and every packet received at the socket since it will cause
a over head in my application. So What I thought that I will have a
proprietary protocol type in socket in that case I can just process the
packet received at my end assuming it to be a heart beat packet.

The socket command will look like this...

sock = socket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW,NEW_PROTOCOL_TYPE);



I googled it also, but I was not able to find any examples regarding it.



Host : Redhat 9.0

Platform: montavista linux 2.4





Thanks in advance







Thanks and Regards

Shree Kant

To show an example of the use of localization with
FLOSS to ILUGC members?

* I have mentioned the publishers, and they are part
of the 'The Booksellers and Publishers Association of
South India', to whom we need to introduce GNU/Linux,
and how they can benefit from it. 

* There is a yearly Chennai Book fair held in January
in the grounds of Quaid-e-Millet Government Arts
College for Women by 'The Booksellers and Publishers
Association of South India'. With their permission we
can try to get a stall for ILUGC-FLOSS promotion
during the book fair. 

http://www.chennaionline.com/cityfeature/bookfair.asp

* There is a need for localization work in India.
Although, I have mentioned in my e-mail w.r.t. Tamil,
the concept applies to other Indian languages and
literature.

Regards,

SK

Hello there!

I recently caught up with SuSE 10.1, installed it. Everything went good.
Sound card was detected. All Audio Players play music. But the problem is
the volume is low. The volume control on the GNOME Panel show 100% volume.
Still the volume is low. Any suggestions?

Use alsamixer on the command line to change the PCM value. I think

of course not. this very server has been using nis with shadow passwords since
before this list even started! you can use nis in linux with or without shadow -
only your configuration should be appropriate. as mentioned by a previous
poster, when you mix linux and sloaris machines, there are issues with md5
passwords, use of privileged ports - and also shadow passwords. appropriate
config can take care of all three issues. i still suspect your shifting from
shadow to passwd file  was not the solution; did you shift from md5 to des in
the process?

there is an alternate and perhaps easier solution for doing this (i had someone
do this for me for the exact same problem). instead of adding a new protocol,
use an existing protocol that you 'know' will not be needed in this application.
your code can then trap all the traffic for this protocol. of course, this may
be frowned on as bad practice since if and when sometime in the future someone
decides they need this 'unused' protocol, there will be nasty surprises.

Can you try to assign a static IP address for eth1 and
see if it get assigned? For example:

ifconfig eth1 192.168.0.1

Arul, 

Do you have a DHCP server in your network? And if yes, is it
configured to allocate address to your machine?

Else, you might want to try and assign a static IP address to it as
Shakthi pointed out to see if it works.


Btw, why do you have to configure the nameserver and the default
gateway? They are generally assigned by the DHCP server, if you have one.

Balaji,

Just I  would like to activate my broadband connection in linux..

For that i gave the primary dns and default gateway as 192.168.1.1..

Before I run the adsl setup, i am not able to activate the ethernet card.

while i am debuging that ifup scipt, i found that it is looking for dhcp
activation.

thanks,

Hi all,

We all are Linux developers/users/testers.To be more precise, we are the
users who use FOSS (Free Open Source Softwares).

Does FOSS mean, that, the word "Free" is actually meaning "without cost" or
as in GPL ?

Suppose i say, i have an application which is Licensed GPL, but you need to
pay Rs.x to get the source as well as binary, will this be considered under
FOSS or simply Open Source Software?

And how many of us will use Linux/OSS if they are charged minimal ? and will
this be OFF TOPIC here?

Till today, many see Linux as Free as in "Free beer" :)

Are you sayinng those many are wrong?  Quess you mean to  say "Free as in
Free beer alone" and they don't know the Freedom part.
Linux, the kernel is pretty much Free as in Free Beer besides the Freedom.
Oh, if you download yourself, you pay for the connection but who delivers to

When you run this, your card is already configured. Can you then try
ping 192.168.1.1 which as you said is your gateway and see if it is
working?

Are you using an ADSL router? If yes, can you look into its config if
it can be configured as a DHCP server?

It can mean both Free as in Free Beer and Free as Freedom. GPL is not 
the only licence that defines "free software". It just says how your 
'free' software might be used.

It will be considered a GPL violation. As GPL says, if you use GPLed 
software, or make modifications to it and re-distribute it, you should 
make the source, with the modifications, available for free. That 
doesn't mean you have to copy it onto a CD and pass it on to whoever 
requests, but at least it should be available for download (if you're 
not doing the latter, the former might apply). You really need to read 
up a lot on licensing on the net.

Personally, if it's really worth my while, I would pay for the software, 
whether it's free/open/closed. But at least I would expect to pull out 
*my* data without hassle. That's why Mark Pilgrim 'switched' from Mac to 
Ubuntu recently:

http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks

In other words, it's a personal decision, for some people it's 
philosophical. I found out that I no longer care about the philosophical 
stuff the moment I laid my eyes on a MacBook Pro. The damn thing is too 
sexy, and I would give an arm and a leg to get it. You might not, of course.

That would immediately change if they found out what they have to pay 
for a *good* Linux Sysadmin ;-). There shouldn't be any complaints 
there, as at the end of the day, even if you pay through your nose for a 
Linux sysadmin, you'll save more money on operations and license fees.

Hmm. Quoting you, "Suppose i say, i have an application which is 
Licensed GPL, but you need to pay Rs.x to get the source as well as 
binary,". What I meant to say was, if you are charging for the binary, 
you should make the source available for free. Or, the source code 
should come with the binary. You can't price each of them separately, 
unless you are incurring a cost to distribute the source code. I hope I 
am clearer now. You might have meant the same thing, though.

Taken from http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Message-ID: <9a9bfc170606150752n268cdb71id2cb1f5aec14a3bd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I get a combo drive with this laptop Acer Aspire 3002NLC, but
strangely the drive never seems to detect CD-RW's or DVD+RW's. (The
drive seems to vigorously blink for quite some time when the medium is
inserted, and mount after a long time returns "No medium found").
There seem to be no problems with CD-R and DVD-R. I have never
installed Windoze on this machine, so I don't know whether it is an
issue with my configuration. Does anyone have any pointers?

it moves on...

Some info:

The media I tested with:

Eurovision CD-RW (4x - 12x)
TDK DVD+RW v1.2 Single Sided (1x - 4x)

I tested by burning the medium with cdrecord (on a diff machine, of
course :) ). I have also tried burning on a Windoze machine, with
Nero.

my two cents...

as in GPL, is what I would think...

it would be free software, but I guess you can't make too many copies
neway, since the guy you sell it to, can legally distribute the
software he bought free of cost...

> Till today, many see Linux as Free as in "Free beer" :)

frankly speaking, that is the reason Linux is getting popular, atleast
amongst the corporate sector. "more cost effective", as they put it :)

it moves on...

I've been using a Mac for quite sometime (more than a year now), but I 
almost never boot to Mac OS X (I have it in place only for my wife - she 
uses it).

I bought a Mac because I wanted to try out non Intel platforms (no AMD, 
its just a clone) since not too many of the free software projects have 
been tested on these grounds.

The hardware is just amazing, but the parts, and everything are just too 
pricey.

I've always been happily using Gentoo (previously I tried Open SuSE for 
a few months and Debian Woody refused to boot even, had bad experiences 
with Sarge).  I too, like Mark Pilgrim, fear the closed formats of 
iPhoto, iTunes, even though they are XML.  Only those applications can 
open their files, what the heck!

Not to mention virtual desktop support, any day Mac OS X is kind of, 
looks out dated for me ;-)

i use an ibook for a laptop - convenient because it is compatible  
with everything. And the darwin shell is the same as any other bsd -  
i have used darwin ports to install the usual apache, postgresql,  
python, etc etc - so i have my cake and eat it too.  But desktop,  
linux is still my choice as you configure peripherals only once

i have tested this with multiple media. the eurovision cd i mentioned
was just bought seal intact, burnt and tested. further, if the drive
is dirty (i did try to clean it anyway :) ), even the *-R versions
should be having a problem, right? i don't have much of an idea of how
the burning process could affect detection. is there any such issue?

it moves on...

Balaji,

I use BSNL broadband connetion.

I know that the ADSL setup is based on pppo, but the broadband connection
has wireless WAN connetion as well.  for enabling the wireless WAN, i think
that my system's ethernet card has to be enabled.

My system has dual bootable(windows and linux), in Windows, the internet
connection is fine. and have viruse problems,  but the same system, i run
the adsl-setup in linux and it is not in active for the net.

I am not clear, how the broadband works, I think that the wireless WAN
connection is based on the ethernet card.

thanks,

arul maran

Only the product which caters to the actual 'needs' of the market can be
sold. ( or can be made popular even when it is made free)
If a Indian foss fa package can be made popular only if it has
the manipulation ' feature' built in, then it has to be made that way.

I have a customer who will be interested in buying it.
He will fund the development to get the first copy.
He will have no objection to release it as foss also.

 one condition:      The package should have the all the features of tally
including the manipulation ' feature'

If this is agreeable, pl let me know how much it would cost for the
development of the first copy.

Are the "fighters" you refer to here the slashdot-crowd ?
If yes, then all I have to say is never go by what the slashdot-crowd says.

OTOH, you also need to understand that the "fight" you seem to
indicate here is not against an individual but against the "system".
The system here being proprietary software. Both proprietary and free
software have their places, however there is going to be friction (not
fighting).

You should also understand that like FOSS-hackers there are much
respected individuals in Microsft/Apple/Oracle who till today garner a
lot of respect in computing circles. One should learn to separate the
individual from the company before judging someone.

slashdot. fast.

Not so fast. If you read comments at threshold level of 4 (or 5), you get many 
angles to a story. Instead of just relaying on journalists who are 
increasingly biased towards large corporations, filtered opinion from a large 
tech population is better any day. 

I read Slashdot regularly, not as much as I used to, but the daily dose of 
technical news and related information come from Slashdot.

Dear Mr.Thiagu,

I am sure you have lots of ideas on open source promotion after Friday

Look forward to getting concrete proposals in this regard

I am sorry, I seem to have missed the earlier thread related to this 
topic. But can you explain what is the error you are getting and how you 
are getting it? I had some experience with MediaWiki, and might be able 
to help you. But I would need more info.

Unfortunately, there is no 'standard' way of cleaning up spam-infested 
wiki pages. Since mediawiki stores all the data in mysql, the best thing 
you can do is, go to mysql prompt, collect the spam text patterns, and 
delete the records. Something like:

delete from archive where text like '%st0ck p1ck%';

Since the spammers seem to have signed up for logins automatically, I 
think 'captcha' (image- based) logins would be safer. The latest version 
of Mediawiki comes with this feature, I think.

Anyone can submit news to Digg and it appears online and then the
digg-users decide which news gets promoted to the first page.

OTOH, Slashdot is still moderated, not all news submitted appears on
the website and the news-review process is SLOW.

So, in digg, you see lots of duplicate stories.  I'm subscribed to their 
feed and its a pain.

Waiting for the next version of digg, hoping things might improve.

1. AJAX has nothing to do with Web 2.0
2. Browser compatibility is no longer an issue with AJAX. Usability is
a BIG ISSUE.

What usability problem are you having by using a web site that uses AJAX?

If you're saying about the browser's back button, many of these web 
sites (including GMail) have handled the problem already.

wasn't Gmail such a pain for those older browsers, which forced them
to get a basic html version? fine, firefox (or other modern browsers)
might accept anything from ajax to the latest version of ecma to
mathml, but there are older ones as well!

and what's your problem with usability?

it moves on...

I know friends who use links for normal browsing. That perhaps
indicates that there are ppl, perhaps in a minority though, who bother
about such issues. But well, coming to think of it, I guess these guys
might not be the ones shifting to ajax :)

The usability problems usually creeps in due to bad design. But I see
that all AJAX web apps suffer from some common problems. Some of them
are:

1. I can't bookmark a AJAX-y page
2. I can't share URL's of AJAX-y pages with friends.
3. Content can't be accessed by external-programs (unless through an API).
4. For an app like G-Mail I can't use a URL like
http://gmail.com/inbox/msg0001.html (after logging in , mind you).
5. AJAX Web-apps are not accessible by the disabled.

Bah! the "back button problem" is just ONE!
GMail handles it well, but most of the apps I see today don't seem to
handle it at all.

If the browser can't do ECMAScript then don't use a AJAX web-app.
Using lynx and complaining to GMail that it doesnt show up on your
"browser" is pointless. Go crib on lynx-dev.

strangely enough, i also know how to use google, i just asked for an  
explanation of what web2.0 is from one who has understood it - i am  
frank in stating that i have been unable to understand what it is -  
or even believe there is such an thing as distinct from web1.0.

This is the mistake of the programmer rather than AJAX.  W3C never says

The problem with some web pages are that the entire page will work only 
with AJAX, and this can be solved by having a fall-back which quite a 
few of them do.

Like for example, consider "<a href="something" 
onclick="DoSomething()">...".  Here, if your web browser doesn't support 
JavaScript, you'll still be taken to "something", and hence without AJAX 
it would still work.  Also, you can always right-click and bookmark the 
link.

> 2. I can't share URL's of AJAX-y pages with friends.
 > 3. Content can't be accessed by external-programs (unless through an 
API).

Making the entire page accessible only through JavaScript is simply bad 
design and never the problem/intention of AJAX.

In both the above cases, you can't say the problem with GMail, since you 
never share your e-mail link, nor bookmark it.

> 4. For an app like G-Mail I can't use a URL like

I don't see this as a valid use case.

The problem goes away if the developer has adhered to W3C Accessibility 
Guidelines, not the problem with AJAX.

Summarising, the use of AJAX should be used as when necessary and not 
throughout the page.  For example I can say a few, "rating a message" in 
Yahoo! Message Boards, Changing the photo title/description in Flickr, etc.

Fair enough. :-)

Let's put aside jargon for a minute. I'll use the words "old-WWW" and
"new-WWW" instead.

Imagine the old-WWW as a place where you went to for getting
information. This information was available to you through a
content-provided, the content-provider gave you the information and
you had to take it or move to a different one. It was one-way traffic.
Example: Slashdot

The new-WWW is different in that there is no one autocratic
content-provider. Instead what you have now is a form of two-way data
channel wherein you access content from a contet-provider but at the
same time you can also push content to the content-provider. The lines
between content-provider and content-consumer is diminished. Example:
Digg

Ofcourse, what qualifies as Web 2.0 is purely upto the data-consumer.
For me it's the data providers/consumers, for other's it's the
new-look-AJAX web-apps.

nobody has bothered to clearly *define* web 2.0.. The wikipedia link

There are many older browsers which support ECMA but not AJAX... I
guess web devs have taken ECMAScript support for granted and I think
that's fair enough, but I am still inclined to think that AJAX
currently needs a fallback.

Hi all,

I'm using pthread library to write a threaded appilcation. 
And for long i have been wondering, if there is some method 
through which i can know the state of the thread - alive, 
running, blocked etc. More precisely, is there any function 
in pthread library which returns indicating if a thread is 
alive/cancelled/exited ??

Searching the net gave me some interesting stuffs, but not 
what i intended.

Are you sure? You might want to read the last part of the link you have 
provided:

http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html?page=5

Sure, I agree that Web 2.0 is more than just Ajax. But we have to give 
it it's due share because for better or worse, most people associate Web 
2.0 with rounded corners and gee-whiz ajax effects.

If there is going to be such a thing, I would sincerely hope that the
web learns to separate data from presentation and ends up using XML
and XSLT :) All the pipe dreams... ah! :)

one good way to go is to find the spam users, delete from archive any post
by those spam users

then delete the users

then allow subscription to the wiki only by moderator approval

I think taking it "waste of time" may be for few people and at the same time
there may be people who think it is good..so one cannot tell at his own
interest that it is waste..

many at times, we do see, people giving a link from slashdot and redirecting
us for some good valuable information...taking it as a "waste of time" or
"useful" is each ones interest..

First, learn the fundamental concepts of Linux - architecture, 
shell, commands, editors, basic usage/working knowledge
of development tools, the X Window System's architecture
and networking concepts on Linux. Refer tutorials, 
documentation and reliable sources on the Internet and 
work extensively on the Linux platform to gain enough 
knowledge on these concepts. Ideally, these fundamental 
concepts should turn you into a Linux power-user.

Then, decide on what your interests are - whether you are 
interested in web development, application development,
network programming, system programming and/or 
kernel development. Focus on relevant tools and technology 
based on your interests. 

If possible, try and gain enough breadth as that would lead 
you to more potential oppurtunities as a fresher. 

Cheers!

Not necessarily. *Learn both* and go for
python instead. And yes, I'd also plug
ruby into that list.

AFAIK, all the above listed languages do support 
i18n. Learning the language intrinsics and concepts
alone along with standard libraries/packages/modules
should be a good start.

Internationalization/Localization cometh next.

there is an alternate way, which is much more fun (and the way i  
learnt). Start writing an application (depending on your choice, gui  
or web or sockets or whatever) In the process of downloading and  
setting up the software, getting the application to run, debugging,  
setting permissions, cron jobs etc etc, you will learn linux - and  
never realise you are learning. You will also learn to use mailing  
lists and IRC chat to solve your problems and meet interesting people.

i18n afaik is not on the agenda for either ruby or rubyonrails -  
there are third party addons which you have pointed out. I am not  
trying to flame ruby (dont know enough about it to flame it) but find  
it odd that is practically the only mainstream language which does  
not have i18n, nor has it on the TODO list

Yes. It seems like the ruby-dev gurus have been busy working
on Ruby2 for quite sometime. Lets hope i18n makes it into their
next major release :-)

i18n support aside, the reason why I suggested learning ruby
was merely for its elegant design. Learning a new language
that make us think differently is definitely a big plus. Assembly
language, C, Forth, Perl, Python, Ruby, LISP are some good 
languages (oh yes, I surely must've missed a couple of others)
worth learning to broaden our thinking (in terms of 
programming).

Just to set the record straight, though i8ln is not in Ruby core, there 
are perfectly workable solutions, both in Ruby and in Rails, like 
gettext (for Ruby), globalize plugin (for rails) etc. Yeah, if they can 
get one of those many options integrated into core, it would be great.

Other than that, the recommendation to check out Ruby is a good one, 
because it is mind-bendingly dynamic, maybe more than Python (seriously, 
that wasn't meant to be a flame ;-). If you're coming from Python, Ruby 
might not seem all that impressive, but if you're coming from Java (like 
me), it's pure poetry.

Dear Thiagu:
Mr. Uma Shankar had come for the NRCFOSS Teachers' Training Programme and
had interacted with the 50 plus college lecturers. Please keep the college
group in mind when you work out various activities.

thanks to your grand show at Arunai, lots of colleges are interested. I had
discussed this with Raman and Bharathi. The idea is to have at least 3-4
one-day workshop plus LDD every month. If we work out a specific
lecture-cum-training schedule, we can cater to multiple colleges on the same
day. At NRCFOSS, we had also discussed with the lecturers about various FOSS
related activities -- elective, project, localisation, etc.

We can set the following target:
a) at least 10 workshop/LDD (if not more) by August end
    -- thereby garner a trained student workforce of 500 and lecturer group
of 50
b) the colleges already in FOSS could conduct at least 20 FOSS awareness
lectures in nearby schools
c) contribute to the content repository (??) -- technical / non-technical
-- am trying to coax the lecturers to product course contents , ported on to
moodle and shared among all colleges
-- organize a group of volunteers to type in technical articles / fiction
(will be able to get people like Sujatha, Jayakanthan allow one or two of
their works to be keyed in and uploaded : they can even write out something
specific for the occasion) -- I would prefer it in Tamil and other Indian
languages
-- in the "national" symposia conducted in colleges, translate at least the
abstracts of top ranking articles [we can think of uploading them in NRCFOSS
portal or some suitable place], if not the full articles ; or else we can
try to bring one sheet per symposia of localised "kalai chorkal" --
technical terms pertaining to the symposium theme.

Well, some of the above could work out, at least it will trigger other ideas
among the group members. Will try to contribute from my end -- personally
and thru our official resources.
Regards, Srinivasan.

I don't intend to start off a flame war, but Perl has its place in the
scheme of things. You can't just dump it. I am sure you know how
useful Perl can be to a sysad. If I quickly need to parse some output
to generate some statistics on whether everything is going right, I
would rather right five lines of Perl code.

it moves on...

The implications of Anna University signing an
agreement with Microsoft seems to have been completely
missed by lugc members.All Microsoft agreements with
colleges and Universities has an exclusive clause.
Once the agreement comes into force ,I doubt whether
you will be allowed to hold a LDD in any of the
colleges affliated to Anna University.

Does that agrement stops colleges from exposing students to technologies 
other than M$'s ? Or, the agrement is only for use of M$'s OS and 
Softwares and not the others ? :O

I had a similar requirement sometime ago. I used pthread_kill with
signal number 0 on the thread that needs to be tested. If the return
value is 0, then the thread is alive. If the return value is ESRCH, then
the thread is not alive in the system.

If you use NPTL (linux 2.6 threads), then you can use kill on the thread
(pid would be what got from gettid() system call) with signal 0. If the
return value is 0, then the thread is alive and if it is not zero, then
the thread is not alive.

AFAIK, both of them works fine in my application because, I have my
application running on both linux 2.4 and linux 2.6.

PS: To know if you are using NPTL, issue the command 'getconf
GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION'. If you are using NPTL, the output should be
something like NPTL 2.3.6. If you are using the old
threading(LinuxThreads), the output should be something like
linuxthreads-0.10

HTH.

in the same way, i find sed and awk to be best for sysadmin to parse some
output.Yes, they are difficult to learn, but once you do, they are Powerful

Yes. 

AFAIK, VLSI engineers who work with
verification/validation are expected to be Perl gurus.
They use Perl extensively.

Slashdot is not as bad as you make it look like. If you create and
account and customise it so that only topics that interest you are
shown, it can be a good all-in-one website where the latest tech news
is summarized. If you set comments to 3 or higher, you do get
insightful perspective to the topic under discussion too. I find equal
value in Slashdot and Google news.

To take an example, I am at the moment reading "Microsoft's Mundie to
Continue OSS Outreach". Did anyone here know that Microsoft had
identified OSS as a threat to its business model as far back as 2003
(or maybe, Microsoft identified OSS as a threat to its business only
in 2003, which might explain why it is finding it hard to compete with
Linux ;)?

Any reason why you ruled out UDP for your heartbeat? 20Hz is nothing
if you are talking over a LAN.

I don't think the GPL goes to that extend. It only says that, you need
to provide the source with the modifications ONLY to the person(s) to
whom you actually distributed the binaries. You are even allowed to
charge reasonably to cover your distribution costs (cost of a
CD+burning charges, or cost of your bandwidth).

If you develop fubar v1.0 which links to GPL'ed library libbaz, then
you can charge the moon for fubar, but your customer has a right (the
four freedoms) to the full source code and he can even recompile it,
removing any branding you may have included, and sell it for a
fraction of your price. Thus, the end user is the winner, in that he
has the choice of picking the best distribution of fubar v1.0 - your
pricey version for which you may provide 24x7 support and free
training, or the other version which is
download-use-but-don't-bother-us, with support only via a Yahoo group
or a wiki or a forum or something of that sort. See how RHEL and
CentOS co-exist in the world.

Not everybody knows Perl, and every tool has its own following.
Its like asking why do you want to learn Python when you can do the same

If this is true, then M$ is clever in Business.Anyways, Anna University
would belive an Organisation than LUG i suppose , becoz he is also into
Business, which is Education.

Guys, am sorry to tell, but i always think, we should showcase ourselves as
a small Organisation and say we come from LUG to people which would make
them feel that we are Professionals.For colleges/universities, the name
Microsoft is enough, they would faint, thats becoz they have captured the
market.We have to focus ourselves with a Solution in hand and approach them,
rather telling, "there are thousands of options one can have in FOSS than in
M$".Think, who would see what are those thousand options, everybody looks
whether his/her work can be done or not.They would just tell you, "Give me
one solution and it should solve my problem".

What i would suggest is, if LUG thinks Ubuntu or any other distro seems to
be good for newbies where it eases many of the works and also has tons of
applications including support for Windows (for new users),good
tutorials,good business softwares,good games collection,good educational
bundles,good media bundles etc.,take that distro, and approach the
people.Insimple terms, market the distro, but with a GPL
License.Sometimes, people think twice if its given for free :).The Support
should be there 24x7.If we approach as LUG and tell them LUG can give
support, how many would be available 24x7 to those colleges/universities and
sometimes we also need to go there in person too.

Now Linux is seeing a new World out there in Business/Educations/Desktops,
people are expecting more and more new things which can make their work
easier and if we dont take this oppurtunity and leave Microsoft to Market
his product, i think the situtaion of GNU/Linux would be the same as how it
is now.

These are just my thoughts.

That can be said about Sed/Awk too; so my question really was why
would anyone recommend Sed/Awk over Perl for the specific purpose of
parsing through some output and producing a report - what specific
features of Sed/Awk would make those a better tool than Perl for this
purpose.

You're not getting the point.  If I already know sed/awk (like I do, 
I've been using it for all of my needs till now), why should I bother 
learning Perl?  For the tasks that extends beyond the scope of sed & 
awk, I use PHP (again I've been writing PHP for years).

I'm just making a point that there are still people out there like me, 
that are still using/enjoying writing small scripts using sed, awk, 
grep, etc.  We don't need the help of Perl.  BTW, thanks ;-)

It is an FE Link.. and I will be receiving the packet at very high rate
and I don't want my packet to go through the Linux IP stack(since it
will take more time). So I am planning to implement a LLC packet. I
don't want to filter my packet on user space since it will cause further
delay. That's why I am planning to go for proprietary protocol
implementation.

Any reason why you ruled out UDP for your heartbeat? 20Hz is nothing
if you are talking over a LAN.

Have you used sed/awk extensively? If so, you wouldnt ask this question of
what would make sed/awk so powerful!. Better buy a book on sed/awk (Orielly
publication) and just go thru them as you would have done for Perl, in
detail.

If you want to edit and change a particular line in a file, i would change
it in one command using sed and if that was to changed according to user
input, i would parse the user input with awk and then pass on to sed
statement and overall again its only one command.

These are the native tools.Am not saying they are the best, they are one
such options where sysadmin should know about it rather than telling,"Perl
does the job, why should i do it with awk/sed".

We might do that but Binand can use "perl -pi" to achieve that.

Every tool has its own advantages and disadvantages, and its not worth 
the effort to fight for Perl vs Awk or anything.

If you're using sed, fine continue to use it.  If you're using Perl, 
well you're not a sinner ;-)

well, for that case, you could just tell a tool is not worth than another
tool :).I think this should passed on to Binand :)

You are not getting my point either - in several cases, sed -e
/whatever/ can be drop-in replaced with perl -p -e /whatever/ (with $N
replacing \N); ditto for awk. There isn't much extra learning needed
to replace sed/awk with perl.

In any case, you are talking about your specific skillset. My
question, to repeat, was why would it make sense to recommend Awk/Sed
over Perl to anybody else, what features of these would make such a
recommendation spot-on.

Oh yes, in my > 15 years of Unix experience (only the latter half of
it is Linux, earlier it has been stuff ranging from OSF/1 to Solaris)
I have used Sed/Awk extensively - more code than I care to think
about. I too went through this Perl-denial phase in my life. But once
I started writing code in Perl, its advantage has been evident to me -
it could replace all of find, sed, awk, grep, cut, sort etc. and I
could write silly little scripts faster than in shell.

In place editing has been a feature of Perl for a long time now. Sed
got it recently, but

This is what I'm questioning. Just because Sed/Awk exists, why should
a system administrator be forced to use them? Newer tools will come,
obsoleting older ones; resisting them will not stop them from gaining
acceptance, and will only make one fall behind in keeping up with
technological advances.

In my years of experience in Unix, I've remained away from Perl, I 
almost never needed it.

I believe you're like those folks that think Perl is panacea.

This is like saying, C++ obsoletes C.  If you don't want to write sed or 
awk well, don't.  But you can't stop somebody from recommending people 
to read sed & awk.

I'm not, everything I have said in this thread can be equally applied
to PHP, Python etc. too. You yourself admitted that there were times
when you needed PHP.

Further, if you have stayed away from Perl, I'd like to know how you
can take an informed decision about whether it is better or worse than
awk, for example. Only by using perl you can appreciate its qualities
that make it superior to awk or sed.

Normally 3 cds will not have source codes of all except linux kernel
source. You can get all source rpms for other software from redhat
site.

Please note: redhat 9 is  several years old.

It's not the question of falling behind. It's the question of need. I
know that Sed/Awk is quite powerful, but it is just that I happened to
learn perl first. Or rather, I learnt sed s/// first, and then Perl.
So, I use sed s/// for simple replacements, but anything more complex,
I switch to Perl. Not because Sed/Awk can't do it... I know that many
of the Perl scripts I have written have equivalents in Sed/Awk... but
just that I haven't bothered using the advanced features of Sed/Awk
because I already have a tool which does the job perfectly, and with
very little coding effort. Just because Perl contains a superset of
features in Sed/Awk, it doesn't mean that one should stop using the
smaller utilities, when the problem is simple enough!

it moves on...

murugan, actually, RHL 9 bundles with linux source code (kernel source
code). You have to install an extra package.

Goto Add or Remove programs>Developer Tools Section and There will be a link
called linux source code. u just select that and update. and thats it. any
more doubts abt RHL u can contact.

Hi Guys,
I'm new to ILUGC,
Can any one show me some light on Linux GUI programming and tools. I'm
through with basic linux terminal commands. I've strong foundations in VB. I
know a little of Java Applets and .Net too.
Whats the basic requirement for GUI programing in LINUX. I use ubuntu 6.06.

So, Help me.

hi,

for VB programmer, Qt Designer will give a very easy workaround. But i think
ubuntu doesn't hav Qt. Qt is not a GNU product even.  but for a begineer, Qt
can be used for GUI programming.

other tools are Glade Interface Designer (supports GTK, GTK+). also refer
more abt GTK for GUI programmin.

Bye.

first decide whether you want to use gtk or qt - the two main gui  
toolkits available. Then decide whether you want to use c on the  
toolkits directly or perl/python using wrappers on the toolkits. Then  
go ahead - there is enough material here for you to google and get a  
start

I think so, yes. The agreement is usually that Microsoft provides
subsidized software, training etc. (including course design, reference
material and instructors) in exchange for not letting alternate
technologies anywhere near the univ. They have done the same in
Karnataka & AP too (in Kerala, they haven't been that successful
because of resistance from the left parties who were in opposition
then).

1. Do not re-use threads to post your questions. You need to start a
new one if the question you intend to ask is not related to the
current thread.

2. There are lot's of tools for GUI programming. You might like to
look at pyGtk or py-Qt . Those are the best places to start off.
Google for them.

Py-GTk/Qt is python based, you will also find bindings for other
languages. If you are a C programmer, then this site would be a good
starting point.

This is bad and how come colleges/univs can accept this kinda thing!!...its
very bad...this makes the student also stop exploring things :(, very

A question arising rather out of some personal interest :P.. Having 
learnt ( sorry, you said strong foundations na ?! ) VB and .Net, two of 
the popular hot cakes of M$, why do you want to jump into Linux 
development.
To prevent being put into flames, I ask such a question just out of 
curiosity and this doesn't mean that you *shouldn't* learn programming 
and development in Linux platform, if you are from an earlier M$ 
exposure. :D

As one of our friend has said, Qt will be easier to learn with your 
exposure to VB already. And yes, you have an option of gtk and Qt. The 
best will be to try the basic things in both of them, learn the basics 
and then decide upon which ever is comfortable to *you*.

Second, what kind of programming or development are you interested in ? 
What are you looking or planning to achieve by moving to open source 
development with an already good skills in M$ ??

Thats why i asked that question. Anything like that is like neglecting 
the freedom from the students to select their own choice of 
technologies. It can also be put as something against the fundamental 
right of the students to select the choice of the technology which is 
going to be there for their entire career or life. May be some of the 
students mught, on their own personal interests and passions, learn and 
practice open source technologies. But, how many of them are going to be 
like that ? We have been trying to spread the open source technologies 
amongst the students and this will be a great blow to our endeavors too.

Why should that matter? The vast majority - 90%+ - of Free Software
are not GNU products.

Hi,

How about conducting some quizzes and competitions for students and
giving out some prizes for the winners. This would encourage the
students and bring in more ppl. As Mr. Thiagurajan said that ELCOT is
ready to give some support, I guess, he could try to get some
financial support for organizing these events.

Or may be ELCOT may sponsor for some event like a linux software
development competition which would go on for a month or so before the
event and the prizes would be awarded for the best software. This
would enable more ppl to participate and would be productive as well.

More such programmes may be organized and a little hyped up among the
school and college students and news regarding that may be posted on
forums and mailing lists like "techbridge" and the likes to reach out
to more people.

Conducting competitions,quizzes, these are not going to change the
scenario.Maybe it can bring out interest in a student, thats the only thing
it can do. We need get down into Business. We need to advertise
Tux/Linux/GTk+/Qt/Ubuntu/Linspire/RedHat , whatever, so that the colleges
and universities understand that LUG is an Organisation and seek help from
us.If you conduct events, it would not put us in track.

Events should be conducted in such a way where a distro is taken in hand,
and as i wrote in my previous mails, the distro should contain all
supportive formats, including Mp3 support and should not report that it is
Restricted and M$ pays for it whereas this distro doesnt pay.People out
there wont understand these, they will just ask you, whether these support
are there or not.Linspire/Xandros/SuSe(i suppose) provide these supports,
but i have seen Linspire provide more options to propeiratory licenses like
Mp3 License,DVD License,CrossOver Office etc.. These Events should be
conducted in a grand way to attract people as how M$ conducts its talks in
chennai.I think these are Business tactics and essential stuffs..

Or may be ELCOT may sponsor for some event like a linux software
> development competition which would go on for a month or so before the

Even i thought of the same idea of seeking help from ELCOT . IBM/HP are
investing a lot in Open Source, but will they sponsor us for these kinda
events?. I think they can, as they sponsor for LinuxAsia.

More such programmes may be organized and a little hyped up among the

For people like us, mailing lists and forums may be a good place to
interact, but i dont think for students.We should bridge that gap somehow
and find a method or atleast start teaching them how to use these features.

I would also recommend not only to concentrate colleges/universities, but
also the Public as a whole.

No. Qt is under dual licensing, one of which is the GPL. I am not even
going into your obvious lack of knowledge of licensing issues here.

>  but iam not sure 90%+- software where not under GNU. is that true?

http://sourceforge.net says: Registered Projects: 122,886
http://directory.fsf.org/GNU/ says: 4,788 packages indexed

That works out to about 4%. Or in other words, 96% of all software is
non-GNU. Not that SF is not the final authority on the number of Free
Software projects out there.

Hi All,

I hope, most of you seen the fwd mail of Mr Uma Shankar IAS, MD ELCOT.
I feel, It is the good opportunity to help Gov to use/support FOSS. If
our members are interested to help in this mission, We can meet on Sat
(24 Jun) in IIT-M to share our views about this.

Depending upon the interest, in next week end, We can invite Mr Uma
Shankar to give talk about his new FOSS initiatives thru ELCOT.

Bye :)

Yes Qt is free for personal use and if you commercialise your Qt Product,
you need to buy the Commercial license/Qt from Trolltech .Everything is not
free in this world :)

Not true. You can have a commercial Qt product, built on top of GPL'ed
Qt, so long as your commercial product is also under the GPL.

that would be better than discussing it in mailing list, as something 
more concrete from iliugc is welcomed.

Yes. thats not the ultimate task. But if u need to spread the word, u
need to conduct such events.. U know, M$ does that. for example,
MSApp(http://www.msapp.net/), Imagine Cup(http://www.imaginecup.com/),
etc.. And ppl spread out the word.. Students feel that M$ is getting
closer to them. Thats the feel that any organization needs for
popularizing technology.

Not very true. There are a lot of students who have enrolled in
mailing lists like
"techbridge"(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/techbridge/). Especially, i
liked the tactics of "Appin Solutions" (http://www.appinonline.com/)
in popularizing the computer courses that they offer among the
students. Rajat Khare, a graduate from IITD started this group and
made all his friends from IIT join it, and projected it as a community
of IITians who are interested in letting ppl from other colleges gain
the edge that IIT guys have, and increased the strength of the group
slowly by asking all the members to spread the word about the group,
so that when the strength reaches some 2500, some company called appin
which is interested in training ppl and  getting them placed in top
companies would be interested in joining hands with the group. Ppl
joined the group and now, its a 5807 member group. Students from
various colleges are there and Appin earns a lot through the group.
There are lot of audience in the group, who dont have a clue of the
latest technology that is there and they join courses, whose
curricullum are meagre crap paying a lot of money.

We can make use of that platform to spread the word.


>  I would also recommend not only to concentrate colleges/universities, but
> also the Public as a whole.


Yes concentrating on colleges and universities wont be enough. But
students here are the people who can adapt themselves easily. If a
student who didnt use linux previously gets to use it, he may
definitely make his parents use it. Atleast, parents who work for
non-IT organizations wont try to install something called "linux" on
their system. They would prefer to keep their computers as an object
in museum, as they have invested a few thousands in it. They would
normally prefer to have the OS installed by the computer dealer as
such without disturbing.

So, the other target should be computer dealers. There should be some
event to attract them. Say a workshop for them to install linux and
configure and administer a linux system. I've seen a lot of young
computer dealers who get fascinated seeing that there is a linux
running in a system, and they ask if i myself installed it(as if its a
very difficult task), and ask me if i could tell them how to do that..
Even the BSNL Dataone ppl spread the wrong news that the modem wont
work with Linux. They need to be educated about Linux and the myths
that they have need to be cleared.

I dont think any 50 year old person working in a bank would shift
himself to Linux. Either the computer dealer or his son or daughter
need to make them shift, as their learning curve would have gone down.

He is a good entrepreneur perhaps. He is a co founder of appin knowledge
solutions. I left that group when all the posting there was crap. I
tried replying to a few queries, but it was a moderated list and they
never approved my replies. If you do look at the list most of the
threads have no answers.

ok enough ranting OT things :| but really techbridge is *defenitely* not
the right group to take as example.

yes. i know. I too had faced the same. But definitely he permits any
adverstising. So, we too can advertise.

I didnt mention about techbridge to take as an example. I mentioned
about it just for a platform to advertise things. You know, free
advertising to 5000+ ppl is good enough. U just spend some 5 mins for
an attractive write up, and u get some nice Buzz around.. You may feel
that creating a buzz among non-technologically inclined people is
useless.. But u know, marketing is all about that. Intelligent ppl
never go by the advertisement. they think twice b4 buying things.. It
is ppl who dont think much buy a product for its advertisement.. If
you have seen "Thums up" or any similar kind of ads, u'll see that the
ad is in no way related to the product.. but the idea is to create a
buzz of its name..

he allows appin advertisements be cause *he is a co-founder* of the
institution. they dont even allow relevant posts on the list (at least
when i was subscribed), I don't think they will allow any evangelising
on the list (at least not until appin comes out with linux courses :p)

That is deeply unsettling to me. I'd rather be in the company of couple 
of intelligent guys rather than a hundred idiots. Do you really care 
what they think? We're not after their money, are we?

Again, you're insulting your audience. What do we achieve by that? Trust 
me, *good* advertising is all about getting intelligent people to care 
about your product (or at least your target audience - but this is not 
how you get them to care about Linux).

NO. UNfortunately ILUGC is *NOT* an Organization in the legal sense.

Can we do anything about it ? I don't know.
Can we apply for something like a NGO status ? I don't know

Problem is pushing things through the LUG till now has been at the
personal level (people like Shakti and Raman). The only time the LUG
as a body gets together is during the LDD-time.

If we are going to make an effort at hitting business establishments
with FOSS "propaganda" then you will require organizational status, an
official body. Problem is whith the establishment of such a body
working closely with the LUG can have dangers.

This is something which we should address during the demo's at the LDD's.
Instead of each volunteer displaying his "uber" distro, there should
really be one common distro so that newcomers seeing Linux for the
first time feel at ease.

Again, you will need some kind of official status to approach HP/IBM.
Nobody will be willing to make out a cheque to "CSD-320 ESB Block, III
floor, IIT-M,Adyar". :-(

If ILUGC is not willing to turn into a "body" can this be done under
the aegis of Linux-India ? I don't know. L-I (atleast today) looks
like a shadow of the organization that it was supposed to be.

If you really feel comfortable with VB you can make a switch with small
gap using Gambas which is an GPL (free) IDE based on a Basic interpreter
with object extensions, like Visual Basic.

http://gambas.sourceforge.net/

Internally Gambas use Qt frameworks. So you can switch to this C++
framework latter.

Like ilugc, linux-india is not an official entity either. In addition,
it was not supposed to be any organisation - certainly not a
registered one, with obligations to keep financial records, file tax
returns etc. It might not be as active as it used to be - but that is
only because of the fact that regional lugs have taken off big-time -
you don't hear about LUG-Germany or LUG-Russia, do you?

Message-ID: <150b4b060606202256j423df44fwcd7149ab76f8ed32@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have SUSE 10.1 in my notebook, which is used by my friends and also
some of my relatives.

I have basicaly two doubts:

1. There are some applications which are common to all users like
XMMS, Amarok, etc.  I have separate users for every persons who access
my system, but i want to know how could i restrict those applications
from selected users. say i have three users

usera, userb, userc

i need to revoke the rights to access those applications from userb
and userc whereas usera must have the rights.


2.  I have a desktop pc with P1 processor and 64 mb ram, i need to
connect that system to my SUSE along with remote access to XServer.

now i have installed DOS in the PC and invoke my suse thru telnet, i
do not want that option to work, i need a remote boot from suse,

Please let me know how to do those stuff.

Pranavam

there was a lot of bad blood and fights in the old days, so ilug  
became dormant and each went their own way to the regional lugs. But  
a lot of new blood has come in, so maybe we should give it another  
try to build up ilug. The first step, as i see it, is that chennai  
luggers subscribe to the mailing lists of ilug-mumbai, ilug-delhi and  
ilug-hyderabad, and encourage members of those lugs to subscribe  
here. I am sure a consensus will slowly build up. Many of us are  
already subscribed to multiple lug lists, and this *is* helping. Ilug- 
kolkata list/site is in dissarray at present - things are expected to  
clarify soon.

I'm no grand visionary and I don't think I can speak for Linux-India
but this my idea. It's based on the simple fact that mailing-lists are
the viens of the FOSS community.

Why not setup a mailing list, or re-use L-I-G in such a way that a
"spokeperson" from every LUG which considers itself associated with
L-I is a member. The duty of the spokeperson is to report to the
mailing-list with a detailed summary of what's going on in the
local-LUG-community.

It needn't be a full digest-mail of all the threads which were
discussed for the Month but just the community prespective of the LUG.
What it's doing for the community, what are the plans, what upcoming
events it has planned for. We could start with such a model to first
bring together the LUG's under a common list wherein people get to
read what is actually happening with Linux@India. Once such reports
start flowing in then we can think of griding the LUG communities
together.

Is it too late ? I don't think so.
Is there a better plan ? Please let me know.

This list(or this thread) might not be the right place for such
discussion, but as Kenneth says, the time now is ripe to re-kindle the
old flame.

Add usera to a group, change the ownership of those programs to that group and 
give execute permissions for that program only to user and group.

Example:
(as root)
# groupadd groupa
# gpasswd -a usera groupa
# chown root:groupa /usr/bin/foo # Where foo is the program you want to 
restrict
# chmod 754 /usr/bin/foo 

7 = read, write and execute (for root), 5 = read, execute (for group members), 
4 = read only (for non-group members)

SuSE may have a graphical tool for one or more of the above operations, though 
I do not know about that.

If we can seek ELCOT or any other organisation's help, can anything be done?

Yes, there should be one common distro with all options into it as i

Message-ID: <ed2d3c000606210014q169af1fand078c54fca9c01e2@mail.gmail.com>

Hello friends,

I am coming to you with a query.

I have a joomla installed in my localhost. I don't know how to find the
version of it. My db name is dbcms and the joomla cms works fine. Now i want
to  add a module, a search module, in which a search key is given in tamil
Unicode content   and it looks for corresponding table say 'cms_content'. I
have three fields fulltext,introtext and displaytext. I understand my db is
a non collate utf8 mysql database. I further understand that the Unicode
content added through the control panel of joomla cms  is added as
'&#nnnn;&#nnnn;......." . I force to add some tamil unicode content to the
table, it inserted by throwing some 8 warning in the mysql console but added
as a Unicode content.  For doing a search now i need a clarification , what
should i do for string comparison. Do i have to upgrade my database with
collate utf8  mysql extension. I have a plan like parsing the string
'&#"n","n","n","n"' computed into &# nnnn and then goin for string search.
Any pointers to this issue.

Thanking you,

Sincerely

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

Thanks for your help reg restriction of the access, just get me one
more point; Do i have to manually set the rights for various

Wont u feel that would be time consuming process (here the no of apps

You can use LTSP kernel and create a boot floppy.

You do not need any OS for booting, instead boot the system through the 
floppy.

sure is a good idea, but aren't regional lugs helpful when it comes to
discussing issues that are local to the region, like say, tamil l10n?

regions are where it happens - but the idea of an umbrella org like  
linux australia is attractive. The infrastructure - website, mailing  
lists are all in place. The people in charge are not squatters, all  
it needs is willing persons from the various regions to come forward ...

You could probably script it using bash, but that's the fastest you can make

The easiest (and reasonably secure) way to do this is to recompile
bash with the --enable-restricted configure option, and then set the
shell for these users as rbash. Once you have that, do:

a. Create a directory, say /usr/local/allowed-apps
b. Symlink all the programs you want to allow your users to access,
from this directory: ln -s /usr/bin/xmms /usr/local/allowed-apps
c. Add all the users you want to have restricted access to say, a new
group: groupadd restricted; usermod -G restricted username. Change
their shell to rbash (usermod -s /bin/rbash username)
d. Add a small script in /etc/profile.d which will check if a user is
in your restricted group, and if yes, does something like:
PATH=/usr/local/allowed-apps; export PATH

hi,
Is my guess right?. "there is no GUI or CUI tool for locking apps and files
still now in linux." If it is not there, then why not a GNU/Linux tool for
doing this work ?.. If it is created, it would be more helpful for novice
user.

Thanks

Enabling global read access will allow users to copy the binary to say /tmp,
"fix" the permissions and run the app anyway.  You probably want mode 750.
In any case, this is not the way to restrict users from running apps.

Binand's post with restricted shells is The Right Way(tm).

Indeed. The user can copy the binary over from another machine and in
99 cases out of 100, it will work.

> Binand's post with restricted shells is The Right Way(tm).

Well, rbash should be carefully thought out as well. If any of the
programs you put in allowed-apps lets the user to run a shell escape
or refers to an external program, rbash can be beaten easily.

  Well - one could consider Ray Ozzie, who is replacing Bill Gates as the
Chief SW Architect to be one of the FLOSS-friendly types, too - he was
at Lotus. They've also fired the key anti-Linux guy - Martin Taylor of
Microsoft Live, and the guy behind the "Get the Facts" FUD (they
wouldn't have fired him unless they actually lost business due to his
actions - which they did, of course):

http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=32552

  Once Ballmer goes (not too far off, given institutional unhappiness
with the M$ stock price under his watch), there's nothing stopping
M$ from turning into a FLOSS company. Who would have thought
that FLOSS would infiltrate M$ from inside and take it over?

  It's largely irrelevant now, given that M$ has lost its way, but it
would still be helpful to have the marketing/financial muscle of
M$ behind FLOSS, like IBM.

Guys,

 I think his question is,  after getting into  bash shell by typing bash,
why does echo $SHELL still shows csh, his   login shell? Given that, how do
I find out which shell  am I in?

here..

  Check out this article by Joel Spolsky:

http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/06/16.html

Try to understand that Microsoft, with Billy at the helm, was a
far more formidable entity than Microsoft with a bunch of lame
MBAs at the helm - because, at the core, Billy was a top-class
programmer, who kept track of *details*.

Frankly, there isn't anything left to fight against - Billy the
Philanthropist is worthy of praise, and M$ without Billy is a
crap organization headed (for now) by "Monkey Boy" Ballmer
and his ilk. Once Monkey Boy goes, there's nothing to prevent
M$ from turning, at least partially, towards FLOSS.

Message-ID: <895952550606220226s42c015amef00e63a88034fbb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I guess I am not the first person to ask this. But would appreciate if
someone can help. I cant find the previous discussion regd this.

I needed to have NTFS module enabled and also the kernel source for learning
kernel programming.

Since the LFY Fedora 5 CD did not seem to have the source, I downloaded
2.6.16-18.
This was better behaved than the 2.4 kernels. Compiles without problems.
I used the Config file from my existing OS.../boot/config.. compilation went
through like a breeze.

I also installed the kernel. I use Grub so this added an entry into
/boot/grub/grub.conf.

Now the problem is i am not able to boot from this kernel.
Remember I did not do any manual work here.

At boot time, I get an error message like root not found or something like
that.
I can get the exact message if needed.

The grub conf says root=LABEL=/
I remember i used to change this to root=/dev/hda<n> to make it work.
I tried this and it still does not work.

i do think i gave the correct partition..
I have 3 primary partitions and 2 logical partions in the extended partition
in that order.
Linux is under 2nd primary partition(hda2). Am i mistaken in this?

Can someone who has been through this pain, tell me what the grub entry
should read?
Can you also tell me, why root=LABEL=/ does not work for the installed
kernel?
it works for the original one..

Any the sites that discuss this in some detail??

Currently I am force loading the new ntfs module into my old kernel.
And I was able to compile some simple modules...and force load it...
booo hooo....:((((

Thanks for any and all help...

The most common cause for this is that your driver for the root
filesystem resides on the same filesystem, thereby creating a
chicken-egg problem. You probably need to create an initrd file.

why not u try checking out root ( hdn,n)?.. it may too cause a problem.

i do think i gave the correct partition..

Or compile the module for your root fs into the kernel
then load other fs modules at boot, or compile them in as you please

I guess there is no direct command to find that. You may do "echo 
$SHELL" .. but that is not reliable.. but a quick hack will be to run 
some bash specific command.. say export .. if the shell throws a error.. 
then u are not in bash..
run "setenv" .. if you get a error then you are not in csh..

May be someone else has a better solution.. 
good luck Ashok

I think `echo $0` is the best way to go about doing this... But avoid
putting that inside a function. Some shells, under some options set,
return the name of the function in such cases.

it moves on...

thats only the pid of the shell. as the faq mentioned by you says, u
have to grep thru ps for this pid.

that reminds me of the short cut for linux systems.

`cat /proc/$$/exe`... gives u the path to the executable.
read the file /proc/$$/cmdline till the first \0 for argv[0] of the shell..

it moves on...

"$$" is pid of the parent process, if you say "echo $$" from the shell 
prompt after logging in, it is the process id of the parent shell.

If "$$" is used within a shell procedure (script), it returns you the 
pid of the shell that was used to run the program.  For example, even if 
you use C-shell, but you ran the script using "sh shellproc", "$$" 
returns you the pid of "sh" (or bash/ksh depending upon your OS to which 
sh is linked to).

If the requirement is to print the login shell, its easy to grep 
"/etc/passwd".

Hi,

It works after adding an initrd file.

Basically i went by Binand's tip...Thanks a million for this :))

#mkinitrd -v --preload=ext3 ./myinitrd  2.6.16.18

This created the file myinitrd, containing the ext3 module preloaded from
/lib/modules/2.6.16.18.

Once i moved this to /boot and changed my grub.conf to point to this, i was
able to boot into my new kernel.

Thanks ppl for your help....

Guys,
Right way to change the shell is to supply exec bash instead of simply bash. There is a slight difference 

simply supplying bash will invoke a new shell with a new process id 
but if you give exec bash it will open the new bash shell with the same process id.

===== Original Message from Mr UmaShankar IAS ======

Sub: Call for OSS partnership and support // LUGs may join ELCOT's
     efforts (Date: Sat, June 10, 2006 9:16PM)

TamilNadu is one of the pioneers in the use of OSS. Already 6500
computers have reached the village panchayats in linux environment
under Panchayat computerisation programme.  It is heartening to note
that almost all the young IAS officers want only OSS be promoted in
their respective offices/jurisdiction. This calls for a quick and
efficient role from ELCOT to support the current initiatives of Govt
of TN in the area of OSS.

ELCOT looks for partners and volunteers who can join ELCOT's efforts
to promote OSS in  Government functioning.  Already certain companies
have expressed willingness to join.

ELCOT is shortly setting up an open source support centre in its
corporate office to support government organisations adopting OSS. The
support would be for OS (OpenSUSE & FC5), DB (PostgreSQL) and
OpenOffice.org suite.  ELCOT needs large number of OSS volunteers to
make this initiative a public owned effort. ELCOT runs a call centre.
This would be upgraded to include support for OSS queries. A website
needs to be built to support the volunteers who wish to join the
effort. ELCOT is shortly finalising a vendor for the web portal
development for this.

LUGs from Chennai and other areas are requested to join the nitiative.

Mankind deserves open standards and open source software. Only the
chosen ones get its taste. Others just hear the taste.

$$ is the PID of the shell or script.

$PPID is   parent process id. For  login shell,  PPID  is pid of login




If "$$" is used within a shell procedure (script), it returns you the
> pid of the shell that was used to run the program.



When you run a script, login shell forks a new process and wait until it
finishes.  $$ within the script would be the PID of the scipt or new process
forked for the script itself.

This is good.
I will try to join the discussions.
failing which kindly accept my best wishes.

Now my sugesstions for how to go about :
Before discussing what all we can do for elcot, we should know what is that
they actually need. ( some sort of a 'things to do list' or in the IT
parlance some sort of a RFP )

i feel that the 'things to do list'  is more impartant  for making the
saturday   discussion more effective.

So the lugger who is spearheading this effort may get in touch with elcot
and make out a list of things / areas where lug can help them out.

If elcot is also in its early stage of the plan  or " wants to explore what
all can be done " - stage, then we should invite a few of the elcot
officials to Gandhi Mandapam and participate in the discussion to make it
more effective.

"'$' shall expand to the same value as that of the current shell."

When you run a script, the current shell if no longer your login shell.

Subject: [Ilugc] su login problem
Message-ID: <19ed471a0606230032y30cd0ab7vb465b0e6db5481da@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Is there way to kill a process in uninterruptible sleep state, without
killing the parent process.
I have a script say abc.sh which needs to use su in the following manner

su - user1 -c myscript.sh

that is abc.sh is a cron job executes myscript.sh as a different user.
If myscript.sh goes into "uninterruptible sleep state" for some reason, what
happens to my "su" command.

In my case "su" too went into the same state. Not only that, I was not able
to use the "su" command after that,
even from an other terminal. If i issue "su -" or "su" the terminal just
freezes, and I cannot get a root shell.

Will one "su" in a "uninterruptible sleep state" cause any other "su" issued
thereafter to go into the same state.
Thats what happens in my case. I tried some 10 to 15 times from different
terminals, and I got 15 "su"s in "D" state,
when I checked with "ps -auxwww" as an ordinary user.

Is using "-c" option of the "su" command the cause. Can I have the same
results by using "sudo" instead of "su -c".

Only a reboot solves the problem. I am able to "su -" and login as root
after a reboot. But this happens in a RHEL 3 update 3 server, hosting
critical database applications. I cannot reboot every time I loose "su"
functionality.

How can I prevent the above scenario from repeating. I cannot alter the
scripts as they are from a 3rd party DB vendor and modifying the scripts may
have disastrous effects on the database.

Easwaran

Well - one thing they do, quite often, is to find out sites that are 
doing so-called "search engine optimization" (or google spamming) by 
things like stuffing random keywords into metatags, creating gateway 
pages that redirect tot eh actual site etc - and ban those.

Not much else that they absolutely ban for (probably illegal content)

You might just stop trying to play with google's pagerank by doing SEO, 
and see if they dont unblock you shortly thereafter.

I didn't get -ve comments about the place :). So We will meet in
*Gandhi Mandapam* around 3:30PM. During our 1st meeting with Mr US, I
got some idea about this proposal. So I will share that in the meet.

Message-ID: <dae53550606230224h27220b06kdfa62a4fb21f5506@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
      I am using RedHat Linux 9 PC.

   To authenticate and account  a PPPoE user via RADIUS server, we a
need radius client in linux PC which is not available by default, but
only pppoe-server package is available.

    So, I tried installing the radius client rpm package from net
which is named as radiusclient-0.3.2-0.dag.rh90.i386.rpm.
    For this it requires the 2.4.3 or later version of the pppd
source. This also I downloaded, compiled and installed.

But when i try to connect the pppoe user, pppoe server is immediately
sending PADT or it is not responding for the ppp lcp configuration
requests.

Here is my dump of the /etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options

lcp-echo-interval 10
lcp-echo-failure 2
mru 1492
require-pap
plugin /etc/ppp/plugins/radius.so

Is there any solution for this? Or Any other configuration is missing
in /etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options or in any other configuration
files.....

Is there any related weblink? I googled, but no result......

Thanks

A process in uninterruptable state cannot be killed.  Killing the parent
will not help.  Rebooting is the only way.

Processes gets stuck uninterruptable primarily due to kernel races
or bad drivers.  I would suggest that you update your kernel and
test your hardware.

Without looking at your application and the script that's causing
the problem, the only thing that can be said is "contact your
DB and OS vendor".

Further, if a process is stuck in uninterruptable sleep, it increases the
system load by 1.0.  If several processes are sleeping, load average
will shoot up inspite of the fact that all the processes are just sleeping
and the machine is fully responsive.  Daemons like at, sendmail, etc
will stop normal operation during high load and create further headaches.

Hi
 Thanks for the help. But, in UNIX one process crashing should not affect
the other processes right....Then why a single su gone bad is preventing me
from using su again..

Let one su process go down the drain, I can at least do a proper shutdown on
other DB server processes before rebooting, if I can su to root again. Why
am I not able to do that. Why are further su commands failing. Is it related
to one su going to uninterruptable state. Googling did not help me find
answer to the above question.

I need to explain this to the DB guys in my office. Any links or leads on
why one su is pulling
down further su commands will be helpful......... :-))

Thanks again..

Hi

The first su might have failed due to the script that was executed by the -c
option.
But the su commands I am issueing after thet are plain su without any
scripts. The only thing it has to do is give me a root shell?????? Why does
that fail .. A solo su is not supposed to go in D right????

More of a workaround... Why don't you try logging in as root from one
of the virtual terminals, or use `sudo sh`. May be those commands
would work... If not, one more workaround: If your server is
physically secure, try using acpi (acpid) to bind one of the buttons
to script the proper shutdown of your DB server processes and reboot.

Well, you would still need to get to the root of what is the problem :)

heh... the ways of a buggy kernel are strange, if that's the problem.
Such logic is unlikely to hold :)

Hi there,
I'm using mandriva 2006. Even though many say that its 4 amatures, but still
i find it harder to install and still harder to install other programs esp
tar.bz. So, throw in your suggestion about how to use this distro. Is this
good to go on with? Should i go 4 any other distro like Fedora Core 5,
SuSE10.1, or GENTOO

Just a side note, what is stopping you from running abc.sh as a
cronjob from user1's account instead of from root's?

ours is a customised build of redhat linux , which prevents normal users
from running cronjobs.
I think the first su that goes into D screws up PAM so bad, that I cannot
use any other PAM enabled services..
Can that happen??

Unless you have extensively hacked into Redhat, the /etc/cron.d
directory for non-root cronjobs should still be available. You have
probably only disabled individual users' crontab -e facility.

Hi,
Mandriva 2006 is one sable flavour of linux. I've used it and i still use
it. Its got not problems with mpeg like suse and fedora. So far i have faced
no problems. I guess it depends on ones requirement.

Tarball install will be the same everywhere except for Arch Linux which
uses  it as it's  package format.

Try them all and stick to what you like.  For every distro, if you google
you will find lots of reviews. That will give you lots of ideas about a
distro which you plan yo try.

I would suggest PHP for the server side and JavaScript for the client side.

A few examples of cool user interfaces developed using the above:

[1] The GPL-V3 draft at http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/ is discussed 
using stet, released under GPL V2, and btw, would probably be the first 
GPL V3 program.  stet source code says:

/* stet will be released under the GPLv3 as soon as the license is
finalized -- so its development may be seen as a sort of
meta-licensing bootstrap operation: a program whose sole purpose is to
develop the terms for its own distribution.  */

[2] TinyMCE is a platform independent web based Javascript HTML WYSIWYG 
editor control released under the LGPL at 
http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/index.php

[3] Calpp is my own project released under the GPL to free users from 
designing user interfaces by hand, using PHP and  JavaScript.  This is 
under development and online at http://calpp.freeshell.in/calpp

Hi,

I have installed KUbuntu 6.06 on my Lenovo 3000 N100 Laptop.
1.  I am unable to play sound.  From KUbuntu wiki site 
(https://wiki.kubuntu.org/LaptopTestingTeam/Lenovo3000N100?highlight=%28lenovo%29%7C%28n100%29) 
found that there is a work around to enable sound.  I had added the line 
mentioned in my /etc/modprobe.d/options file.  But still I am unable to 
get any sound.
Has anyone been able to configure sound on Lenovo N100.  Is there any 
more steps that need to be done after adding the lines? Am I missing 
anything?? Any pointers would be very helpful

2.  When I partitioned my disk during installation, I tried creating 
multiple partitions.  While doing so ended up with around 1GB of disk 
space which is shown as free but I am unable format it fat/ext3/Linux 
swap.  I did not understand why that space is shown as free but not 
available for use.  Is there a way to recover the lost disk space?

I am planning to get a BSNL broadband Internet connection.
I dont like to dish out money for the modem rental, since there is an option
to use our own, I want to get one.

Those of you who already own such a modem, pls help out.

Apart from what BSNL offers, can you tell me which ones I can get from the

Say, if I go to Ritchie street, what should I ask for?
Brands, and if possible approx cost...

I prefer one that is compatible with linux of course.

If ELCOT starts supporting the Gov offices and schools to use/teach
FOSS, then their is changes for facing problems in installing/ using/
troubleshooting. So ELCOT is planing to setup a call center to address
this issues.

Apart from Call Center people, FOSS based users group members from
different places can help *call center* thru mails/ phone/ in person
in volunteer mode or in partner mode in solving the issues.

During this meet, All of us shared views about this. All members saw
this in +ve angle. So we decided to invite Mr Umashankar for our ILUGC
meet to share his views.

Bye :)

Sorry that i couldn't attend the discussion.

Now, by going thro the available details, it looks that elcot  wants to play
an active roll in e-governance.
In that context, in Indian scenario, the place one should start with is,
developing an accurate , error free and exhaustive citizen database. America
has its social security system revolving around such a database.

In India thou we have census database / electoral list data base, etc they
are neither accurate nor exhaustive.

Application of biometric devices / program should be looked at integrating /
perfecting ,  this database first. Advise / Help of actuaries may be sort
for designing the fields of this database to make in comprehensive.

Many of the govt functions can be simplified / made extremely efficient by
designing / perfecting this data base. The following are a a few examples.

1. Birth / death / community / nativity certifications
2. Admissions to govt colleges / planning the requirement of college
seats/courses in the coming years
3. managing / monitoring pds ( ration shops)
4. History/ pattern of diseases  and  monitoring / managing govt vaccine
purchases and efficient functioning  of govt hospitals
5. Requirement planning and managing water supply / sewage , and garbage
6. criminal history / crime detection / crime control
7.simplifying tax  computation and  tax collection

are only a few among the endless uses.

E-governance is a emerging concept and there is almost no one who can guide
people with his experience. It is only one's innovative abilities to put
the  technological developments, and the social/ regional  needs together
can make a lot of progress in this subject.

A efficient call center may also planned based on the services of this
database.
A concept like " Call the Govt at 100 "  ( or 104/105 whatever) can also be
discussed.

Oh sorry, I didn't notice that this has been quoted already!

Bharati and Thayagu explained about  their interaction with
Mr.Umashankar. Based on  this it appears that ELCOT is

a.Interested in promoting FOSS
b.in need some technical help
c.planning to setup Call-centre kind of setup to help
   government department/schools/others, in using FOSS.
d.expecting lug to provide tech support for this the call-centre ( or
help centre) as a fall back when local talent is not enough.

After discussion, following broad views arrived:

a.ILUGC can provide training to the employees who will work in the
call-centre. The level of training to be decided based on ELCOT's
requirement.
b. A separate mailing list/discussion forum can be created with ELCOT
staff and volunteers from ILUGC. Support to the call-centre staff can
be done through this list. If required the LUG volunteers can post
the query to general list, get feedback and repost in the special
mailing list/forum.
c.We can ask ELCOT to provide facility for weekly GLV
d.Seek their role in Software Freedom Day celebrations

Mr.Bharthi will meet Mr.Umashankar again, for followup and invite him
to our next LUG meet. If required a special LUG meet may be held
again.


Additionally we discussed about Software Freedom Day and LDDs.

July, Aug are best months for LDD/Seminars in Colleges. Hence,
members are requested to try to get some colleges to conduct
LDD/Seminars. Jaya college have earlier expressed their interest to
conduct one in July. Aanjhan will follow this.

For Software Freedom Day
Following ideas have emerged

a.A Software Freedom Awarness Walk/Run
b.Simultaneous celebration in various colleges/school throughout TN

Other ideas are solicited.

Raman.P

Hi all,
     I am using RedHat Linux 9 PC.

  To authenticate and account  a PPPoE user via RADIUS server, we a
need radius client in linux PC which is not available by default, but
only pppoe-server package is available.

   So, I tried installing the radius client rpm package from net
which is named as radiusclient-0.3.2-0.dag.rh90.i386.rpm.
   For this it requires the 2.4.3 or later version of the pppd
source. This also I downloaded, compiled and installed.

But when i try to connect the pppoe user, pppoe server is immediately
sending PADT or it is not responding for the ppp lcp configuration
requests.

Here is my dump of the /etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options

lcp-echo-interval 10
lcp-echo-failure 2
mru 1492
require-pap
plugin /etc/ppp/plugins/radius.so

Is there any solution for this? Or Any other configuration is missing
in /etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options or in any other configuration
files.....

Is there any related weblink? I googled, but no result......

Help is required.....

Thanks

I am using the same kernel version as mentioned in the bug listing.  But 
still the problem persists.  Let me know if you find a way out of this 
problem.  I am still googling to find out a solution....

Recovery CD would be better :-(  I dont mount that partition....

think the problem was me trying to create more than 4 primary 
partitions.  I had used GParted to repartition my disk and was able to 
recover the lost space.  Actually I had created the fifth partition for 
swap.  As I could not I was using linux without any swap enabled.  
Thanks to  your information, I had created extended partitions and 
problem solved...:)

Thanks for your help!!

Lenovo comes with a also sound card. First try increasing your PCM sound 
value using alsa-mixer. Also, these is a known bug with older ubuntu's 
linux kernels that sound is not heard in speakers in lenovo, but for 
some it works in microphones. It was also the same for me in ubuntu 
daper. I updated my kernel to the lastest available version and am now, 
atleast able to have sound in microphone. I have again re-openned the 
sound bug in ubuntu's bug reporting system and waiting for a solution 
from them :)

Parthan,

I found that on KMix--> output tab PCM option and KMix-->Switches tab 
'External Amplifier' option were disabled by default.  I had enabled 
both the options and I am able get sound on my Laptop speakers.  Check 
for your settings.  It might be of help to you.

Hi All,

I am using the following comand to recurse through directories and fetch me the files that are conforming to *.zip format in the ascending order of timestamps.

    find "$sdir" -name *.zip -type f | xargs ls -tr

where $sdir is the directory path.

I need to fetch all the directories that contain the *.zip file but do not contain *.log file. How do i achieve this?

this should do, if I get your query right :)

find -type f -name '*.zip' -not -name '*.log' -printf '%h\n' | uniq |
whatever...

it moves on...

Consider the following case: I have 3 directories dir1, dir2 , dir3.

Contents of dir1:
dir1file1.zip
dir1file2.zip
dir1file3.zip

Contents of dir2:
dir2file1.zip
dir2file2.zip
dir2error.log

Contents of dir3:
dir3file1.zip

Now i want the output to be the contents of dir1 and dir3 in ascending order of timestamps. since dir2 contains the log file, it should not appear the output.

It would be great if you could inform the dates well in advance so that lug'ers outside chennai can plan their travel accordingly.

What I wrote should have worked for you then.. you just have to
replace "whatever" by `xargs ls`... If you want ascending order of
timestamps, you will need to put an extra `xargs ls -dt` in the
pipeline before "whatever". If you want to have spaces in the
filename, you will need to put a sed before that to quote each
line....

it moves on...

Subject: [Ilugc] Radius Client with PPPoE server in RH9
Message-ID: <dae53550606270449s2589f200w3604b0ed1852e2cd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
     I am using RedHat Linux 9 PC.

  To authenticate and account  a PPPoE user via RADIUS server, we a
need radius client in linux PC which is not available by default, but
only pppoe-server package is available.

   So, I tried installing the radius client rpm package from net
which is named as radiusclient-0.3.2-0.dag.rh90.i386.rpm.
   For this it requires the 2.4.3 or later version of the pppd
source. This also I downloaded, compiled and installed.

But when i try to connect the pppoe user, pppoe server is immediately
sending PADT or it is not responding for the ppp lcp configuration
requests.

Here is my dump of the /etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options

lcp-echo-interval 10
lcp-echo-failure 2
mru 1492
require-pap
plugin /etc/ppp/plugins/radius.so

Is there any solution for this? Or Any other configuration is missing
in /etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options or in any other configuration
files.....

Is there any related weblink? I googled, but no result......

Thanks

Greetings!

Thanks to Balu K, ILUGC member, I have with me the
video lectures by Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman
on the Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs.

Anand Babu, GNU hacker, suggested these lectures for
students beginning with computer programming and dor
learning lisp/scheme during his talk on GNU Guile.

http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/

There are 20 lectures, each around 500 MB. So, it is a
total of 10 GB.

When I go to colleges, I shall dump it to their
servers.

If anyone would like a copy, I can transfer it through
the LAN from my laptop or from the external USB hard
disk. I don't have a DVD-writer.

Regards,

SK

Friends.

My friend in velechery gor sify broadband connection.
He has FC5.

Sify gives a seperate cable to his network card.

using netconfig, he gives IP address, netmask address, Route address,
DNS address.

Eventhough, he cant connect to net.
he can't ping to his gateway.

Firewall is stopped.

"route" command gives proper output.

any idea? anybody has sify conn?

Help me.

It is very difficult to see just one line of a logfile and guess what
the problem could be. You haven't mentioned what VPN software, what
P1/P2 proposals, whether the boxes are behind NAT gateways etc. and
haven't pasted any detailed logs or configuration information.

Having said that, from the given information, my best guess could be:

ICMP Type 3 is "Destination Unreachable". It looks to me that your two
VPN end points cannot talk to each other on port 500/udp. Check your
firewall rules and see if that is indeed the case, and fix the problem
if yes.

Hi friends,

Great support to hear from you Mr.Harish, Mr.Raman was talking about this in
our meeting. Now, can you(any one)  say which will be the  ideal location to
start and end point of this run/walk. We have to take prior permission from
The Police department regarding with this. I feel such event will add a huge
momentum to our community. Some sponsorer for t-shirt/banners/promotion
material will be a added flavour. Any ideas to transform this idea to
reality.

Cheers,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

Well, your logs say otherwise. What does:

nmap -n -sU -p 500 [remote-gateway's-ip-address]

say, when run on both gateways? (Nmap above needs to be run as root).

These two together say that your VPN tunnel is up (P1 - ISAKMP and P2
- IPSec SAs are established). So now it is only a matter of tunneling
traffic over the VPN interface (what does "ip link show" say at the
end of this?)

There are no IPSec interfaces there; so what are your left/right
subnets? Please post your config files as well. Also, post the output
of "ip route show".

The purpose of this walk is to create awareness.
more the public crowd seeing it , better the awareness created.

At the same time we need to choose a place with the lesser public crowd/
traffic to avoid public disturbance. How to meet both the objectives ...?

imo , choosing a place/time where the crowd is the least and having  the
entire event published in the news papers is the way to meet both
objectives.
To attract the attention of the media, huge no. of people participating the
walk is a very good influencing factor.

the beach road  from island ground to kanagi statue or light house  in the
morning from 7 - 9 may be suitable

I suppose we could start with /etc/freeswan/ipsec.conf (or wherever
ipsec.conf is on your system).

Post "ip address show" as well.

To start with, there seems to be a problem with the default gateway
setting on your DXB side. The setting seems to be the same as the
local interface IP address, which is probably not what you want:

3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000
   link/ether 00:02:a5:b1:45:33 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
   inet 195.229.190.151/28 brd 195.229.190.159 scope global eth1

The other side looks OK (local IP is 217.66.217.131, default gateway
is 217.66.217.142):

> default via 217.66.217.142 dev eth1

3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000
   link/ether 00:30:48:80:1f:23 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
   inet 217.66.217.131/28 brd 217.66.217.143 scope global eth1

If it is anyway similar to Redhat, you need to look inside your
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1 and /etc/sysconfig/network.
Make sure the IPADDR variable is the local IP address, and the GATEWAY
variable is set to the default gateway IP address that your ISP
assigns you.

Hi,

My thoughts below:

* Run - I am not sure. Walking is fine.

* Having the walk a day prior to the Software Freedom
Day or on a Sunday will be useful, as creating
awareness will help people show up to our LDD.

* Yes, it should be organised and must not affect
traffic - maybe walking in two piles?

> Marina Beach to Bessi beach??

Isn't that too far?

War memorial to Light house on a Sunday, perhaps? It
shouldn't affect any traffic.

We definitely need to get Police permission. 

We can invite all the GLUGs, FSUGs and college
students so they can participate as well.

Regards,

SK

Just that this GATEWAY is not visible in your routing table:

195.229.190.151/28 dev eth1  scope link
152.109.247.0/24 via 195.229.190.151 dev eth1
192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0  scope link
127.0.0.0/8 dev lo  scope link
default via 195.229.190.151 dev eth1

Get rid (comment out) of that GATEWAYDEV line, and restart your
network service. Then see if it changes your routing table in any way
(ip route show).

Use synaptic package manager to install
ttf-indic-fonts.

Or simply go to System -> Administration -> Language
support and select the languages you want. All
dependancy packages and support will be installed for
you.

>From Gnome panel, display "Keyboard indicator". Right
click it -> Open Keyboard Preferences and add Tamil

I have CAPS key set in preferences to toggle input

Try the knoppix based Morphix Live CD. It's supposed to be a games-based distro.

Hi ashok,

why not you lend "Linux for you" magazine CDs from ur friends?..

this CD will contain all time favorite games such as Quake 4, Cold War etc.
and also screenshots of the game will be in the magazine itself.

Try out!! and say comments abt it.. becoz i hav not tried them yet..

Google for  Games Knoppix, a Knoppix derivative which focuses on
games. I like the selection it offers.

What is a good game is a matter of taste. It depends also on what
genre of game you like.
I have liked the following games:
Cube - a first person shooter like Doom, Quake etc. Graphics is not as
polished as Quake 3 or 4, but enjoyable to play, IMO.
Battle of Wesnoth - Turn based strategy game. I find it very
addictive, but it depends on if you like turn based strategy games.
Torcs - Car racing game. Needs a good graphics card to get full advantage
Netpanzer - Real time strategy, you control tanks and try to kill
enemy tanks. Has AI for play against the computer, maybe multi player
mode too.
scorched3d - duel with other tanks in an arena
gl-117 - Fly a fighter plane , shoot things up.
lbreakout2 - arcade game, tetris like
frozen bubble - arcade game

I've not had much chance to play these but I will for sure if I get
the time and / or bandwidth
Freeciv - Civilization clone, turn based strategy. Supposed to be very addictive
bzflag - drive a tank, team up with other tank drivers, and try to
defeat opposing teams. Works best in multiplayer mode
Boson - Real time strategy, works in multiplayer mode only
Stratagus - Real time strategy
ASC - Turn based strategy
Vegastrike - travel/trade/fight in space. Works in multiplayer mode only.
FlightGear - full fledged flight simulator, not really a game as such.

Not all these games are available on the distro I mentioned. They are
at different levels in terms of graphics quality and how polished the
game is, but they are all playable and fun for me.

What do you mean, when you say "rejected"? Do you get an ICMP network
unreachable response?

Your config:

config setup
       interfaces=%defaultroute

conn %default
       left=217.66.217.131
       leftsubnet=152.109.247.0/255.255.255.240
       leftnexthop=217.66.217.142

conn firewalldxb.test.com-vpn
       right=195.229.190.151
       rightcert=firewalldxb.test.com.crt
       rightsubnet=192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0
       rightnexthop=195.229.190.145

I am not sure if you need those leftnexthop/rightnexthop entries. I
have been trying to find config file documentation for this IPSec
package, but without much success. The main reason I believe your
tunnel is not working is because that the IPSec daemon does not bring
up the ipsec0 interface at the end of successful P2 negotiation, and
neither does it add routing table entries for rightsubnet into that
tunnel interface. The reason for that looks to me as if the config
file tells the IPSec daemon explicitly to add the routes to the
leftnexthop/rightnexthop IPs and not the the ipsec0 interface.

Message-ID: <d6e7f37f0606290042o86003f5g9727593be4b449cc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

i hate IE. but i need that now, because a website needs that madly. so, i
tried installing wine and started installing IE6 based on a patrick's
tutorial. i.e, installed, dom98, ie6setup.

finally i got an error from ie6 as "crlengine problem"

iam using wine 0.9.15.

but ie6 is tested to work on wine-20030618 patched version (according to the
document).

i already heard that this wine version is best for many windows apps but i
cannot get that version now. any links that u can suggest?..

and also i tried winetools which automates installation of many win apps.

but in both of this trials, i get a blank IE window. i searched many forums
but cannot find a correct information.

thanks for all the help.

login or create a new account, it is redirected to "You have to login
to edit pages. Return to Main Page" page.
2) I have an account created couple of years back. When i click 'Mail
me a new password', i'm not receiving a new password.
3) As i dont have an account, i'm unable to edit or create a new page.

Any workaround for this ?

Dear Friends,

I am working with joomla 1.0.10 and when i developed a component it worked
with my local installation(lets call this area as
http://localhost/aarea(read it as ' a area)) and it worked. And i had
another copy of joomla  running in my same localhost(lets call this area as
http://localhost/barea(read it as b area)). When i shifted my component from
'a'  area to `b' area it gave me an error

*Warning*: reset()
[function.reset<http://localhost/Tamilonline/function.reset>]:
Passed variable is not an array or object in *
/var/www/barea/includes/joomla.php* on line *1813*

I surfed through the net and this error creeps for phpbb , mambo and similar
php appz. any pointers to the solution is appreciated.

Thanking you,

Your shorewall seems to be blocking this. But it also says OUT=eth1,
which confirms that the ipsec0 interface is not being used for
tunneled traffic.

How about uploading somewhere and posting a URL?

Message-ID: <032601c69b67$457fad90$3600a8c0@JANANI>

Hello all,

Greetings from the Linux For You team!

As you all know, last month we launched a new initiative called CommunitySpeak where we pose a question to various ILUG mailing lists and publish the top five responses (selected by our technical editors) in the magazine. Thanks to all those who responded to last month's question on "why a majority of the world's top 10 supercomputers are powered by Linux". The best five among the responses received are to be published in the July 2006 issue of LFY. 

The selected responses were sent by Vishnu Vyas (Chennai), S R Parthan (Chennai), R Subramanian (Chennai), Manu Konchady (Bangalore) and P Sriram (Chennai). Thanks again for your participation.

This month we have chosen the topic: "What would make a Windows user pick up a Linux magazine?" 

No, this is not a marketing tactic. We are *really* curious. What would make Windows users pick up a Linux magazine? How can we convince them to read about and adopt Linux and other free and open source software? Would they be interested in reading about free business software than run on Windows? 

What's your take on this? Our eyes and ears are wide open and we are waiting to listen to your ideas. Please write to us at writetojanani@gmail.com with a CC to atul.goel@efyindia.com before July 5th 2006.

The top five responses will be published in the August 2006 issue of Linux for You. 

Look forward to your responses. 

Thanks,

Janani Gopalakrishnan, Freelance Writer

Use your knoppix cd and try installing grub using grub-install. Before
that you must chroot to your debian or any other GNU/Linux distro root
directory.

Simplest would be to get a live cd (Knoppix/Ubuntu) and do a
grub-install over your hard disk where linux is installed (say
/dev/hda) as root.

Hi siva,
    I think you have lost grub.

To get back our grub first stage boot, here a procedure you can use.

    * Boot from debian CD choosing linux2.4 kernel (default)
    * Change to console 2 with alt + F2 keystrokes
    * Make a new dir to mount the boot partition, for example /disk
    * mount the root partition on /disk.
    * Do a chroot to the root partition: issuing chroot /disk
    * Run grub command to enter grub shell
    * Type in the root disk for grub, for example root (hd0,1). This is
      /dev/hda2 on my system
    * Type the following command to install grub on /dev/hda: setup (hd0).
    * Last step, type quit, exit from chroot, unmount all disks and reboot

Please refer the : http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/325

Regards,
Arun Velusamy.

Hi,

How to configure multiple smart relay hosts in
sendmail?

Currently I use 'DSmail.mydomain.com' in sendmail.cf ,
where 'mail.mydomain.com' - smart relay host

I need to add more , so that If one mail server fails
, the mails 'll be relayed thru other server. 

Any other solution for my request?

boot with a bootdisk and at the prompt - something like (google for the 
correct parameter)

linux root=/dev/hda1 noinitrd ro

then once youre in there - as root run lilo

/sbin/lilo -v -v

if you overwrote your linux partition with windows you're out of luck though

Message-ID: <ed2d3c000606291011t5eb19be4n4d15536f11db7e2c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi friends,

I am working with  Joomla CMS, it is a open source tool and in it we have a
mailing function, The mailing function has the senders email id , name of
the sender, recipient address, subject and body of the mail as a parameter.
Can this function be used by the spammers to junk the e-mailing traffic. I
was testing that function by sending sample mail to my email id( not in the
evil prespective of a spammer), this exercise is to understand the joomla
cms system. after 10 mails my mailing routine went out of function. I am
aware that a  huge chance of my stupid mind spilling the code, but may it
would have been any security feature in protocol level?.
Any pointers.

Cheers

The recent kernels offer write support for NTFS, although with some
restrictions. User space support is also provided.

yes - badly coded phpmail (or perl based) applications are one of the 
single largest spam sources these days.

There are several FAQs on perl and php lists on how to stop this - but 
roughly

1. Hardcode the recipient address if possible

2. Sanitize input to your scripts to filter out things like a spammer 
feeding your list a big list of "bcc: x@y.com, y@z.com ... followed by 
spam content

If you cant hardcode the recipient definitely enable human interface 
checking (aka "captcha") features to stop automated abuse of your form. 
And also run outbound email on that app through spamassassin so that 
even if someone abuses your form it'll be caught and rejected.

Hi,

I am experimenting mhonarc for replacing exchange server public folder. I
found that for one mailbox (daily traffic around 100 mails), it take 10-15
min. We have 25 projects. Most of them have similar range of mail traffic. I
wish to know any other alternative for this purpose. Most of the Google

See http://cdimage.debian.org, look for "testing"

In particular, note that using jigdo is the best way to get the images
for testing (Etch) and Stable (Sarge).

Hi everyone,

There r many and more distros of linux come up day-by-day and only very few
become success.

the way user selets distros according to me are,

Debian-based distro users will be core programmers.
Redhat/Fedora users will be enterprise managers and UI software developers.
SUSE/Madriva/Linspire users will be some linux desktop users.

so,vote for ur best. lets see which distros win. already many polls like
these will be conducted. but there r some discussions that Fedora
distributions are going ahead of all the other types of distros. and Ubuntu
is picking up the community past 2 years. so, lets see how many votes each
distro gets..

Thanx.

Why not Gentoo/LFS?  On what basis do you make this comment?  If you 
think a distro that has installation/configuration being difficult is 
meant for core programmers, then Gentoo/LFS is harder to configure than 
Debian.

That being said, no distro can be best, it depends on your usage ;-)

Its not a win for a distro that matters, freedom matters.

IMO, such polls do not make much of a sense, coz I don't think there
can be a single "best" distro... That's one of the boons and banes of
free software... You end up choosing what you like best.. A poll is
meaningful only when the candidates are capable of being put in a
total order, or we are in a situation where only one could be selected
:)

it moves on...

If you are saying Debian uses "will be" good programmers, as in "will
become", I'm happy. But this, by no means is necessary. There is
nothing in Fedora Core which makes it less suited for development or
more suited for UI development.

I use Debian because I like the package management system, the variety
of packages to choose from. People use Fedora if they can handle
yum/RPM better. Since I am yet to try Suse, I cannot comment. But I
strongly contest your Fedora and Debian claim.

And, you really must mention Slackware. In my view, that is the most
(and only) no-nonsense distribution which exists today.

oops.. i said "will be".. its all on my view.. but debian installation is
somewhat tough?.. isn't it..

slackware is worst than debian.. i believe. it still goes on in the old
paradigm of which kernel to choose..

but, debian may be mostly used my kernel developers.. that what i mean?..
becoz.. most of the command line tools in Fedora does not match with debian
tools..

Do you have any other options in boot, like

Boot from a LiveCD and see if it boots fine. Just to
make sure there is no problem with hardware.

Well, if you think a colourful Anaconda based installer is the only
thing that is user friednly, Debian isn't! However, I believe the
Debian installer is very simple, though not aesthetic.

Slackware isn't for those people.

I am sorry, but I will have to disagree with you. Please be clear
about which command line tools you mention. If you are talking about
some utility to compile kernels, yes, Debian has make-kpkg, which is
excellent, but that really isn't just for kernel hackers. I use it
myself often... but other than that, what arethose utilities which
Fedora lacks?

thanks for your reply.
i am not putting any other options in the bootloader.
while i am trying to troubleshoot, i can enter into single usermode,then by
using init 3 i can enter into runlevel 3,then from 3 i can enter into
runlevel 5.no problem. (so, no hardware issues)

i can login to GUI by the above process.but when i start to runlevel 5
directly, it hangs. (its totally confusing me).

i cant understand, what the error says,awaiting your response.

I have contacted D-Link on phone , they said DWL-G510 is available and 
not G650.
I want to know wether the Linux-2.6.11 supports DWL-G510.

And also can anyone tell me some best shops in chennai to contact in

With 75,000+ Drupal power websites and an emerging industry supporting
over 150 professionals, the open-source Drupal project and community
is exploding. At the heart of this community is an incredibly active
and productive group of contributors. Creating contributed modules,
themes, bug fixes, and core enhancement, these individuals define the
course of the Drupal project and the ecosystem of users, tinkerers,
and professionals around it.

Through this internship program we will attempt to train students from
India the ins and outs of Drupal and help them established themselves
as long term contributors to the Drupal project. Over two months the
selected students will work closely with project mentors on real world
Drupal projects; contributed modules, and core patches.

They will learn the Drupal development process and gain extremely
valuable experience interacting with a live open-source project.
Students will be paid a stipend of 4,600 INR to 8,000 INR a month
depending on the level of their contributions to the Drupal project.

It was said that a chicken could install Debian Potato.  All you had
to do was peck at the Enter key.

The Debian installer is also very flexible.  I've installed Potato on a
SGI Indy box with one internal HDD running IRIX and no removeable
storage.  Netbooting the kernel + installer image using tftp and dhcp
right from the Indy's firmware prompt was just too easy.

I've also installed Debian on couple of SGI and SUN boxes which had
no graphics cards.  The console was connected through a serial port.
And some G4 macs as well.

The first phase boot strapping and installation is very quick -- takes
~15 mins on modern hardware (on the same hardeware, the Solaris
installer took ~20 mins to just boot up).

The installation steps are consistent across all architectures.  If you've
installed Debian on PC, you should be able to install it on any other
arch without too much difficulty.

I found OpenSuSE 10.1 to be really good as well. Its boot time is
faster than FC5 or Debian Sarge with equal number of servers installed
in both. And for gamers like me, there are a few cool games that ship
with opensuse(though u can install them on other sitros as well). The
drawback with it is that not many softwares give rpms for OpenSuSE,
while lot of support is available for debian, gentoo or fedora..
