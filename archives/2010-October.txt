Very nice idea. I had a similar idea but didn't have time and patience to do
it. I wanted to compile/organize stuff from ILUG-C archives and put it in a
wiki, so if some one new comes here and asks a question which has been
already answered we can just point them the link. Please create a webpage, I
am willing to help.

Get a brief overview of how many files and directories are installed

    $ locate -S

This locate command is provided through the mlocate package, installed by
default on most GNU/Linux distributions.

The output is self-explanatory- it provides an overview of how many
directories and files are on your system.
Ex:

 shrini@arul-desktop:~$  locate -S
Database /var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db:
    33,159 directories
    3,72,258 files
    2,23,63,372 bytes in file names

If everybody can do their homework, we don't need the list. Google and the
list of search engines can give the answer to anything under the sun and
this list is not required. The list is there as a human touch to learning /
using Linux. If the list only answers questions about advanced networking
and stuff, we can call this an 'advanced linux' user group...

There are some brilliant people in this list who just ignore the noise and
come in and give brilliant answers when it is in their domain. Isn't this
how it should be?

The list should accept all kinds of questions. The busy/people who don't
like newbie questions can simply ignore it. The rest can help.

Exclusivity is simply wrong. It goes against everything to do with FOSS.

The Mailing List Guidelines have everything I mean by Home Work

If they follow it, they won't shouted at. So there is no reason to be afraid.

Valid point. And if anyone is not following the list guidelines,
instead of flaming him/her in the list, offer a personal help to
understand the issue. That will improve relationship and harmony in
the list.

In the same thread, Somebody was asking about moderator. This list is
unmoderated. That means, everyone in the list is responsible for what
is going on the list. So be responsible :)

See above to know how your mails are displayed to everyone.

Can you guess which is your reply, which is quote and which is advert from
your email client?

This is 4th/5th time someone is pointing out this fact to you. Why don't you
listen to them and stop using whatever lame email client you are using?

I tried to create a page, i got the following error

A database query syntax error has occurred. This may indicate a bug in the
software. The last attempted database query was:

(SQL query hidden)

from within function "Revision::insertOn". MySQL returned error "1048:

          Are you referring to the disk controller ? I am not sure
what exactly you mean. The file system is a software abstraction that
the OS understands and its not about any device. The hardware just
reads a collection of bytes and doesn't have to understand the
underlying file system. Thanks

Subject: [Ilugc] Linux-Windows sharing folder problem
Message-ID: <AANLkTineX5Tvs-z1=ZMZi5VaiaaJkNqKhPUyt0B+qfEG@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I need to share a folder named "check" which is under /usrl/local/ tree.
I am running in Debian. I have made that folder "shared". After that, we I
tried to access that folder from Windows machine, I tried to made a shared
link into that folder / machine, my "root password" of Debian is not
becoming effective from Windows machine. That means, when I tried to create
shared link in Windows machine and I am putting root password, it shows me
that, "Wrong Password", I know that password is 100% ok.

What I need to do now? I think, I am missing some steps here. By the way, I
have installed samba in Debian box. What do you suggest me to do?

Samba uses a different back end account/password database.  You need
to create password entries for your users using the "smbpasswd" command.

As root run "smbpasswd -a root" and set a password for the root account.
You can then access the smb shares from Windows using this password.
Note that the smbpasswd and the regular unix account password can be
different, smb password is used only for accessing shares through samba.

Some suggestions:

1. Linux File System Heirarchy Standard does not recommend sharing
/usr/local with Windows systems.  Read the docs on how to do this the
correct way.

2. Don't use the root account in samba.  Suggest that you create separate
samba users.

Start reading the manuals?

Lot of thanks for your helpful reply. Here, regarding your suggestion number
1: I know that, samba file should be in some places of /var/ftp or something
like that. But, my problem is: My Software system is running and saving it`s
data in /usr/local/check directory and that "check" directory need to be
accessed by my colleague who will insert new raw data there in that
directory for processing. :)

It's very clear that the software used is Mediawiki, the one which Wikipedia
uses. I wonder if such a bug exists in it. I guess there could be some
problem with the configuration (Even the place for logo still contains the
placeholder text). As I have worked a little with Mediawiki, I can try to
fix these if the Web admin would like to.

Hi all,

Also, to add to the previous responses ... You could also give links
to some blogs that has some novice information... It will be seriously
helpful for the needed people.. As open source awareness is growing
all over India, this is really a nice start-up for the information
hunger of Indians.. Supporting the cause and any help needed will be
done gratefully....

Nanda

With NetworkManager, I have found that a "reboot" solves this kind of
situation sometimes.

Purge NetworkManager [1] and enable the dhcpclient.

[1] This will reduce your flexibility of choosing the Network
connection on the "fly" between WiFi, Wired, DialUp etc. but give you
more stability.

Did you try creating special passwords for samba as raja told?

Else, you can great public writable samba share.
It wont ask for any password.

Here are the steps to do.

Try this and update here with your experience.

I recently did quite some research and ended up buying samsung CLP 300 series - specifically Samsung CLP 315. This is a pure printer i.e. no scanning/fax/telephone.

Most Samsung devices have Linux drivers and are downloadable from their site - samsung.com/in

I also researched other printers - HP, Canon, Brother...but Samsung is a pretty strong brand with a clear Linux driver policy and I just went with it.

My only regret is that I did not buy the wifi enabled model :-)

In such case tell your software vendor to make this directory
configurable via settings in some .conf file under  /etc.  It will
make it more compatible with the other packages like what you are
trying to do.

I suggest that the application data be kept somewhere under /srv since
it is being made available to other machines over the network.

Also, I second Raja's suggestion - please do read up the Samba docs;
they are comprehensive and come with excellent examples which you can
use as templates for your specific scenario.

I have found the following howto/tutorial/guide very helpful

@ R.KRISHNA MOORTHY,
what you have done is **unabashed** **hijack** of a thread that has
nothing to do with your problem.

It also demonstrates your laziness/unwillingness to compose a new
message with an appropriate subject line.

If you are using postfix, then it is a fair assumption that you know
what you are doing and the first place you should have looked for a
solution are the postfix docs; hint:  look for UCE.

Subject: [Ilugc] Kalculate, Tally, GNUCash
Message-ID: <383841.13744.qm@web33105.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I wanted to maintain accounts of our small FOSS firm. Currently the accounts are being maintained by an external accountant in Tally.

I want to start maintaining them in-house (hopefully myself) and in my research I found Kalculate as a promising alternative. But looks like you are better off with GNUCash.

Here are my reservations on Kalculate:

1. It is not Free software in any sense. There is no 'community edition' either. Just an evaluation edition.
2. The last release of Kalculate seemed to be in 2006 - http://openlx.com/download.php
3. I do not seem to be able to download from here: http://kalculate.com/download.php
4. Don't know if it is keeping up with changes in accounting standards. Looks like the co. is dormany/hibernating. I sent them and email - lets see if they respond.
5. The only connection with Free Software is that it runs on Linux and they have some OpenLX distro but Kalculate itself is NOT under and 'Free' license - GPL/Apache/MIT....


I am currently trying out GNUCash. This should be interesting - I do not really know the difference between voucher and invoice. 

If anyone is planning a GPL alternative to Tally (accounting ONLY and not ERP), please talk to me. I should be able to provide support.

I think there is difference between GSM/CDMA SIM adapter and data
card. I do not know if we can transmit AT command to data card for sms
or audio call. these are for internet connection.
correct me ! I may be totally wrong

However, E160G reported to send sms

Hey, 

Posted a message to the mailing list 2 days back, but for some reason, it didnt 
reach the mailing list. 

Heres the message:
Guys, 

Coming back to topic, Ganessh(FOSS club representative) and I went and met the 
CS
dept HOD who was receptive to this idea. For mail server infrastructure, we went 
and met the ICTS department, which manages computing infrastructure. They said 
they will get back to us after reviewing security concerns and feasibility.

As far as naming goes, i personally vouch for ilugcbe, but if a majority of 
contributors from Coimbatore want GLUG, we can review it. Valid arguments
for and against GNU/LINUX are given in many websites including wikipedia and 
gnu's 
website. However, i am personally neutral.

One question from me is that Android is uses linux kernel, but is not GNU. Nor 
is it 100% free. Are Android users/programmers a part of LUGs? What about 
Maemo/Meego? 

Also, I would like to stick to the naming convention we follow and try to make 
it
less complicated to newcomers.

Yes that is ideal case. But unfortunately we cannot expect everything to be
ideal always. If something undesirable happens and when it goes out of
control it would not be nice if none is there is to moderate. As Akilan said
if those who violate the list guidelines continuously are blocked
temporarily and after a certain critical point permanently, it would help
all users to be conscious and alert to follow the guidelines.

Just a thought -- there are many arguments (flamewars) on Linux v/s
GNU/Linux, but I've never really found any published arguments
(wikipedia, gnu.org, etc.) on the subject of LUG v/s GLUG. It has
always been LUG.

Just verify that your internet connection itself is stable. I too use BSNL
and sometimes, the connection gets dropped every few minutes.

the internet connections is stable for sure because same time when other
five laptops are working properly how can just one laptop wont work?
its problem with laptop not with connection. coz the same wire works well
for other laptops while not for the one which is not working for time being.

Yes, I was wrong about my observations. There does seem to be a page
about the FSF trying to hijack the idea of a Linux User Group and
'encouraging' people to register GNU/Linux User Groups:

http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-user-groups.html

In any case, it is a problem that the Coimbatore [G]?LUG needs to worry about.

Why not? Flamewars are good if you learn from them.

Hi,
The PHPLIVE monthly meet was held today at MIT. Two talks took place on:
* Input handling and form validation - by myself
* Database connectivity - by Tamilselvan
The total count was around 20. Finally we gave LAMP package to those who
wanted.
Thanks for the interest shown by the students :)

Hi,

I am registering my thoughts, feel free to fire me, if you disagree..

IMO, having it as LUG can give an accommodation to widest audience. I am
seeing an attrition[1] in bring a glug, for reasons of Anti-M$  and similar
ideas of FSF(which i learnt from Mr.Siddarth session which happened in the
Aug ilugc meet). I feel being spiritual is going to help us rather than
staying religious. We have to win the hearts of people by showing
technology, assist them in their learning execise  and the sort of
ANTI-SOMETHING preaching is not going to work any more.

regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

[1]In science, attrition are ratios regarding the loss of participants
during an experiment. Attrition rates are values that indicate participant
drop out. Higher attrition rates are found in longitudinal studies.

Could you post the error message ? I heard from someone on an IRC channel that 
the currently packaged version of youtube-dl for Ubuntu fails. It seems to be 
working for me on Fedora (rpm version youtube-dl-2010.08.04-1.fc12.noarch).

I would recommend trying the latest version of the script from:

http://bitbucket.org/rg3/youtube-dl/wiki/Home

If you still have problems, it would be a good thing to file a bug against the 
package at:

http://bitbucket.org/rg3/youtube-dl/issues

I don't know of any other command line download tool. I sometimes use the Video 
Download Helper extension for Firefox:

I use youtube-dl a lot, and just checked that it's still working.

Run "youtube-dl -U" to auto update itself to the latest version.

I typically use "youtube-dl -t -r 200k -m $URL" for the mobile version,
and replace -m with -b to pull the best quality video.

VLC plays everything nicely.

I agree with you completely except for one bit: I don't know if you can
relate GLUG and Anti- MS sentiments. I myself prefer to call it GNU/Linux
but never indulge in MS bashing or even call it M$. I don't think many
people passionate about software freedom agree with many of Mr.Siddarth's
views on that day. I certainly do not.

Calling it as GNU/Linux is just an acknowledgement that Linux is just a
kernel and not an Operating System and that GNU project has contributed a
lot to that OS. Its unfair for GNU guys(not only for RMS, but to all those
who works in that project) not call it that way.

That in no way is associated with MS bashing.

1) Practice what I preach by using a  Apple i book/mac variants, activities
like porting Linux to apple mac..
2) Can i build an web app using FOSS+ adobe flex platform

and these are the two points which flashes immediately in my head and I am
welcomed to do a presentation in LUG on the above points, How about if it is
GLUG?. If  'No'  is the answer, Kindly acknowledge that there is a
difference, not just in the name.

I agree that some mails in the middle of this thread caused such noise, but
the recent mails are not so AFAIK. Discussion on the pros and cons of naming
as GLUG is quite related to the subject IMHO. Let the relevant discussions
go ahead.

Hi,

Whether GLUG or LUG member, you will be passionate in driving (Gnu)Linux to
all categories of people,
As a glug member I  am not allowed to have a dual boot system (M$ windows
and Gnu Linux) as the gnu philosopher says

"The free software movement has campaigned for computer users' freedom since
1983. In 1984 we launched the development of the free operating system GNU,
so that we could avoid the nonfree operating systems that deny freedom to
their users. During the 1980s, we developed most of the essential components
of the system and designed the GNU General Public
License<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>(GNU GPL) to release them
under?a license designed specifically to protect
freedom for all users of a program."

There are strong faith (some of us here, may call blind faith) M$windows
users, As a glug member, i cannot install a dual boot and  give an
experience to the user and allow him to decide which one of the OS is better
for his needs. If I am a Lug member I am perfectly welcomed to do this.
The amount of new users whom you will lose or get is also dependent on which
way you choose, glug! or lug.

regards,
Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Hi,
   It is best and easiest way, What I did is I will allow youtube video(not
only you tube video) let the video buffer fully. Open up terminal and type
cd /opt/ directory and there you will find a video file general its file
name starts with flashXXXXX and copy it and paste it on my directoryand play
it simple

cpan.org has perl modules for youtube downloader. Look at
http://search.cpan.org/~xaicron/WWW-YouTube-Download-0.15/lib/WWW/YouTube/Download.pm

As simple script given in the eg directory can be used to. You can download multiple videos simultaneously also.

In todays context especially on desktops, GUI is most important part of OS, so it is unfair not mention X also.

We shouldn't forget, that we win our bread and butter though the proprietary

What we preach shouldn't differ from, what we practice, but look at us their

Friends.

Shall we stop here on discussing how to call a FOSS user group in this thread?

Linux or GNU/Linux or GNU/Apache/Mozilla/BSD/X/Y/Z/A/B/C/D/Linux ?

It is coimbore friend's own wish to name their group.
We have given enough links from them to read and proceed.

It will be nice if we discuss on how can help for forming a FOSS user
group in coimbaore.

Thanks.

Yeah, Youtube often makes changes to the applications that access the
videos.. Checkout this.. this might be useful.. It has some options too..

Shrini, I am recording what  I think these points that will help to
differentiate LUG with glug.
It is not just confined to coimbatore friends, this may help any set of
people who are willing to form lug and contemplating in naming it as a lug
versus glug. My personal opinion is that one needs to adopt homotopic[1]
approach between  lug and glug.
Hope I believe I am in the ambit of good discussion, Shrini, care to explain
why this thread should be stopped.

regards,
Thyagarajan Shanmugham

[1]In topology, two continuous functions from one topological space to
another are called homotopic (Greek ???? (hom?s) = same, similar, and ?????
(t?pos) = place) if one can be "continuously deformed" into the other, such
a deformation being called a homotopy between the two functions

Fine.

It is an endless discussion.
It is their wish to name their group.

We have given enough links and points to think.
Let us leave it in their hands.

Instead of naming a group,
we have to think on how to help for their activities.

Still, if we want to discuss on the naming a group,
please start a new thread and discuss.

We have to remember that we are still "Indian Linux User Group, Chennai" :-)

Thanks.

Hi,

>>It is an endless discussion.
It is their wish to name their group.

But one should draw the line between lug and glug. I am trying to add
something to it.

>>We have given enough links and points to think.
Let us leave it in their hands.

Ofcourse,it is in their hands.Advocating is our job, isnt it?. So arguments
and counter arguments (until stays in ambit of this mailing list
guidelines), should be welcomed. What is enough, how do we quantify it?.

>>Instead of naming a group,we have to think on how to help for their
activities.

Some of the points which I added is from the operational domain.So naming
something and operating away from the  named spirit will be a irony. So, the
first help what we can offer them is to distinguish in nuances of naming.


>>Still, if we want to discuss on the naming a group,please start a new
thread and discuss

I cannot understand this logic of breaking the discussion.

Hello Ganesh ,?
For starting a Glug/Lug ?( I dont want to debate on it anymore on this thread as told by Ganesh), target a single college , it would be good if its your college , then ?speak with the students ?. They would most probably be your friends or in worst case friends of friends . Then represent this matter to your HOD . If there is green signal from HOD we can conduct a session in your college and after that free software ?would start to blossom in and around Coimbatore .The only problem is a good beginning . Hope you guys can deliver it with full force . Any help feel feel to mail us .?

Hello guys,

As informed by our coordinator, yesterday night we got together at #ilugc-in

Here are some effective tips (what I think)

a.You can start meeting any where - on the 'mottaimadi' of your house even, But please start. If I remember right, the first ILUGC ( or the chennailug) was held in one of the founding member's house. As the famous saying goes ' a thousand mile journey starts with single step'. Look at Kanchilug - they meet on the lawns of 1200 year old temple. Few mandapas on steps of Marudhumalai comes to my mind for you. It is will that is important.

b.There is no point in planning too much in this kind of activity. We are not  going to send rocket to moon - where you have only one chance. Our activities can be corrected over a period of time. But there should be some activitiy.

c.In my humble (or perverted/irrational/arrogant) opinion mailing doesn't help in organisational matters - only personal rapport with others help. So don't discuss too much of time on ideas. Whatever you can start immediately start now - get people involved. 

d.Try to attract industry people - for sustaining. Do not just concentrate only on students. 

f.For God's sake do not ask question like - I want to start lug ,give me idea what to do?.  Instead putforth your plan and then ask for suggestion. You will get meaningful discussion.

This mail is fantastic.

The experience is obvious.

Only one joke. ;)

Motta madis are costly in Chennai. My office is in motta madi though
it is fully furnished.

Dear All,

While booting my ubuntu 10.04 I am getting this message : 

ata4 : SATA link down SStatus 0 SControl 300

I googled for this error message. All users were complaining that they failed to boot the o/s. I am getting into the o/s GUI. If I follow the troubleshooting steps I am afraid that the existing o/s will get corrupted. Please help in fixing this bug.

While this list is not meant just for seeking and providing technical
support, many exchanges on the list seek from and provide support to
other members of the list and the guidelines followed on Ubuntu forums
may be of interest:

http://ubuntuforums.org/index.php?page=policy

I understand that the governance of those forums is quite different
from the governance of this list, but some of the points mentioned in
those guidelines may certainly be useful.

Mailing List Guidelines: Monthly reminder

1. English is the medium of communication in this mailing list, so use
only english in the mailing list. For people wanting to expressing
themselves in Tamil, ILUGC's Tamil mailing list exist. For joining ILUGC Tamil:
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/listinfo/ilugc.tam

2. Use a proper subject line.

3. Do not troll in the mailing list

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll

4. Use [OT] for off-topic, non-technical discussions.
But, don't misuse this to start flame wars or to troll
in the mailing list.

5. Do not top-post:

Because it messes up the order in which
people normally read text.

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting

Example of a top-post:

> > Why is top-posting
> > such a bad thing?
Top-posting.
> > What is the most
> > annoying thing in e-mail?

Use interleaved, trimmed posting

?Sure.

?> CTAN doesn't seem to give me anything.

?Check this example (Observing Time Application Form):

?Bar Foo

6. Do not over-quote:

Example of an over-quote:

>>> On Friday you said
>>> blah blah blah
>> On Saturday you said
>> foo foo foo
> On Sunday you said
> foobar

7. Do not post HTML messages

8. Do not recycle messages

9. Do not send attachments

10. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical legal
disclaimers. If your company uses disclaimers, don't
use your company ID for the mailing list.

11. Do not reply to a digest. (If you are in digest
mode and want to reply to a post use ILUGC Gmane blog
interface.

Link:
http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc

12. Search for answers for your questions/problems in
google.com or any other search engine before posting
your query to the mailing list.

13. Do not post messages in all capital letters. Mails
in CAPS is considered rude and is similar to shouting
during a conversation.

14. Following these guidelines could be helpful
http://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/

15. Don't send season's greetings or birthday or social networking site
?invites to the group. Its not mailing list etiquette.

We must use the above guidelines to maintain better
readability, proper archives, efficient bandwidth
usage, etc.

If any of the above are not clear to you, Please read
the detailed list guidelines:

surely your mail client has a filter to send my mails to the spam

although not GPL'd (it is under BSD license), this is in active
development. The accounting module is more or less complete. If you want
a log in to test it out please contact me offlist. (there are some bugs
since there has been a small hiatus in getting a team together. This is

I am in Ooty, but spend a lot of time in Coimbatore and have been trying
to form a LUG there for a long time. I will turn up for any meetings -
and also help to arrange for venues. (If it is a LUG)

Hi all,

I am Arun Prakash . I am a member of Fedora Free-Media Program . We got more and more request everyday , and we are unable to satisfy all the tickets . So thought of forming a free media group within every town or colleges in TamilNadu . These groups will be provided with the distros like Fedora , Ubuntu ,etc., and these volunteers are expected to circulate it within their locality . 

Though this existed very early in ILUGC , it is unmaintained . Now it is the time to maintain it . All the Volunteers will be listed in ILUGC website , so that people could get from them. Interested volunteers are welcomed . 

Regards,

Arun Prakash

precisely. BSD license allows one to make the application proprietary,
but insists on name change and also insists that the application is not
touted as derived from the original. That is why apple calls it open
darwin or whatever. What they do is perfectly legal.

Q3: As a commercial OEM, ISV or VAR, when should I purchase a commercial

whatever this means - as I said I do not understand the GPL, and so
cannot understand whether this complies with the GPL or not.

back in about 2003 I was involved in a flame war with the owner of
mysql, and he told me that they only accept contributions if the
copyright was handed over to mysql (under GPL of course). And assured my
that this would be paid for. If this had not happened, he would not have
been the owner of the whole copyright of mysql and would not have been
able to sell the software as if it was a commodity (and pocket
millions).

you are wrong - If I buy the full copyright of a GPL'd product, I can
make it proprietary (as far as new development is concerned). The same
hold for BSD, but the danger is less, as very few BSD product owners
bother about purchasing the copyright from contributors. Very many GPL
people do this.

Hello


I have recently loaded Ubuntu 10.04 Server Edition as dual boot OS alongside Win XP. While installilng ubuntu, I did not do network configuration and lef it to perform later. The nework source is from BSNL Broadband and I am facing trouble in confiuguring the network from BSNL which is provided through DHCP server. As the CLI is the only option for server edition, I am unable to proceed with n/w configuration. Could anybody help in this reagard?


With GUI on desktop could be easiest one to configure n/w but CLI on server edition without GUI makes it to complicate. I shall highly appreciate your help towards it. 


with regards

Ok, so lets call this scenario (1). Where it is perfectly legal for recipients 
of BSD code to modify it and turn it proprietary *but* there is not way for 
recipients of this modified BSD code to get access to the modifications.

I think you are confusing matters here. Firstly, there are 2 *different* 
licenses we are speaking about. GPL and Commercial. That is the meaning of 
*dual* licensing. Secondly, yes, you as a recipient of the app, get to *choose* 
which license you want (unlike scenario 1).

Let me get this straight -- what do you have a problem with ? That they can 
change and modify and make proprietary ? (from scenario 1, that doesn't seem to 
be the case) ...or that they can do all of that without changing the name ?

...because, in the first case it is just like BSD and in the second /less/ 
restrictive than BSD !! ie: for sake of argument, let us assume that they were 
only allowed to modify and turn proprietary *if* they changed the name, would 
you be ok with it ?

If you would, I'd suggest that as you read further while thinking of the mysql 
commercial license as a BSD license with the change of name clause removed 
(<sarcasm> yay ! /sounds/ still 'free-er', doesn't it ?!! </sarcasm> )

ugh ! the commercial license != GPL. So, people purchasing under the commercial 
license need not comply with the GPL ...and whether people want to purchase 
under the commercial license (ie: think 'free-er' BSD license) is their own choice.

What is wrong with selling software as if it was a commodity (and pocketing 
millions) when the *very* *same* software is available under the GPL ? It is 
still better than selling software as if it was a commodity (and pocketing 
millions) without offering the source code (as in scenario 1).

Red Hat's business model is not comparable with MySQL's. However's MySQL's model 
is comparable to Apple's (as shown above) and I think in those terms it is a 
better model.

Yes, like the BSD license (again think commercial license as a /free-er/ BSD 
license ...*snicker*)

Wrong, wrong, wrong ! That is the *whole* point of the *dual* license. Yes MySQL 
is *also* GPL but if you want to make it proprietary for new development you 
purchase the commercial (a.k.a 'free-er' BSD) license.

References please ? I have yet to hear of a legal way to purchase something 
under the GPL and then modify and redistribute it as proprietary.

Like mentioned in the link above. The license is decided per client. The basic 
download license is BSD:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/downloads/oslicense-093458.html

The irony I was trying to point out was how Oracle can completely control the 
license on a per client basis (read the first para on the link above or go 
through the details in the link before that one).

Anyways, all that said, let me just say this:

my problem here is this: there are two licenses. But is it the same
software? If I contribute code to mysql under GPL - then can oracle
include the same in their commercial mysql? Obviously not - which is why
they either have to purchase the copyright from me or cannot include it
in the commercial version. In which case there are two versions. I can
understand dual boot - but I am unable to understand dual licensing.

this is the two clause BSD license which is non free

I am sorry - I am of the opinion that treating software as a commodity
and selling it is evil. Regardless of licenses. But just because it is
evil, I do not feel I have the right to restrict people from doing evil
things with my software - they can do so as long as they remove my name
as a contributor and change the name I have given it.

cool - that is all I am arguing about - and will repeat it: BSD is a
good open source license - people should be open to it and to the other
40 odd open source licenses and not go around propagating FUD against
them and saying that it is an invitation to disaster and GPL is the only
way

> b. I think the GPL is a /better/ open source license

I do not think either is better or worse. All I think is that GPL is
more restrictive. Perhaps it is necessary to be restrictive in the case
of major projects (that can be embedded) like the linux kernel or
iptables) - but evidence shows that many major projects are surviving
quite happily under non-GPL licenses.

Again, I do not think I have said BSD is better. That is a question of
perspective - but if you think GPL is not more restrictive than BSD, you
are wrong - but I respect your right to be wrong.

know it is a little distant, but so are the other venues I can arrange.
If anyone can arrange a more convenient venue please do so.

Agenda:

1. talks - anyone can give talks

I am not in digest mode and yes I am aware of how thread aware email
clients sort/link the messages based on the headers you mention.

Coming to your posting, I am trying to figure what it is that you are
referring to.

I suppose it is this thread started by "indianathann"

<http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2010-October/060965.html.>

My post on the topic is here

Please elaborate -

Take a look at this link which lists all of Oct/2010 postings sorted by thread.
<http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2010-October/thread.html>

which subject are you talking about?  Give me a specific link that you

I'm aware that you know much more about networking and email headers than
me. You erred in assuming that i was telling about your mail. ;-) I was not
telling this to you. As you can see i was quoting K.C. Ramakrishna and my
reply was directed at him.

It seems he is digest mode and replied to one of your previous posts which
is evident both by broken thread and his subject line.(In digest mode the
authors name is put in bracket after subject, which is how the subject line
now has your name.)

No. Look carefully. It has one thread with subject line 'Linux compatible
printer' and another thread with subject 'Linux compatible printer (Arun
Khan)'

This (http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2010-October/061003.html) is
the first mail sent by K.C. Ramakrishna with wrong subject line. Under that
you can see my reply and above mail of yours too.

I have not used cake php, but is the warning above the error? is this
all available for crash dump? For the warning, google has a fix

wget <http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/%7Eprikryl/wget.html> is a nice tool for
downloading resources from the internet. The basic usage is wget url:

wget http://linuxreviews.org/

Therefore, wget <http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/%7Eprikryl/wget.html> (manual
page <http://linuxreviews.org/man/wget>) +
less<http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/>(manual
page <http://linuxreviews.org/man/less>) is all you need to surf the
internet. The power of
wget<http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/%7Eprikryl/wget.html>is that you may
download sites recursive, meaning you also get all pages
(and images and other data) linked on the front page:

wget -r http://linuxreviews.org/

But many sites do not want you to download their entire site. To prevent
this, they check how browsers identify. Many sites refuses you to connect or
sends a blank page if they detect you are not using a web-browser. You might
get a message like:

*Sorry, but the download manager you are using to view this site is not
supported. We do not support use of such download managers as flashget,
go!zilla, or getright*

Wget has a very handy -U option for sites like this. Use -U My-browser to
tell the site you are using some commonly accepted browser:

  wget  -r -p -U Mozilla http://www.stupidsite.com/restricedplace.html

 *The most important command line options* are --limit-rate= and --wait=.
You should add --wait=20 to pause 20 seconds between retrievals, this makes
sure you are not manually added to a blacklist. --limit-rate defaults to
bytes, add K to set KB/s. Example:

wget --wait=20 --limit-rate=20K -r -p -U Mozilla
http://www.stupidsite.com/restricedplace.html

A web-site owner will probably get upset if you attempt to download his
entire site using a simple wget http://foo.bar command. However, the
web-site owner will not even notice you if you limit the download transfer
rate and pause between fetching files.

*Use --no-parent*

--no-parent is a very handy option that guarantees wget will not download
anything from the folders beneath the folder you want to acquire. Use this
to make sure wget does not fetch more than it needs to if just just want to
download the files in a folder.

Friends,
We all know that there is no PDF library which can support Indic
scripts. We ourself have seen many requests for this in various
mailing lists. The workaround available is to generate ODT file and
then doing export. ?In case of python the default pdf library is
reportlab which does not support any complex scripts. Wikipedia's page
export feature is broken for complex script languages because of these
limitations.
We are starting a project to address this problem. The project is
named as PyPDFLib and hosted here :
http://github.com/santhoshtr/pypdflib
The project uses Pango for complex script rendering and Cairo for PDF
and graphics manipulations. Project is in Python and licensed under
LGPLv3+
The current status :
* Basic set of APIs in working condition. Widgets such as paragraph,
header, footer, line, h1,h2 etc., image(not all formats) are available
now.
* Basic configurations like Font, size, alignment etc
* Sample program with Kannada, Hindi, Malayalam, and Bengali texts.
* Another sample program which converts a wikipedia article to PDF -
tested with Indic languages, English etc

Project is in initial stage, so expect many bugs. But if interested
play with the apis , report bugs, give patches..

Thanks
Santhosh Thottingal

Hi everyone,

Here at Ubuntu we love to give training sessions over IRC. Since
Developer and App Developer Week cover the more advanced end of the
spectrum we have something for normal users -- Ubuntu Open Week:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek

If you look at the last schedule you'll see that there's still some
pretty development focused sessions there:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/openweekLucid

I am looking for instructors, specifically those of you who have never
taught a class before. Now that developer week is separate, we have
some leeway to make these sessions more productive for end users, so
I'm looking for some more end-user type questions. So, if you're
interested in helping out by teaching a session dive into the prep
page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek/Prep and submit your
ideas!

As always, if your Local Team wants to run a concurrent Open Week in
your own native language feel free to branch from this wiki page and
arrange something, please let me know so I can help get the word out.

(Hoping for someone to do an Inkscape class!)

On the server side, Ubuntu unfortunately does not provide any sys

it's pedigree is Debian, many of the Debian help sites would be
applicable to Ubuntu as well.

Roll up your sleeves, hone your text editor skills and start editing
the relevant files.  For your specific scenario - required reading
"man interfaces"; configure the /etc/network/interfaces file.

In bash, this works only if CLI mode is emacs (default).  In vi mode
it does not; ESC puts the CLI in  "command" mode.

In emacs as well as vi  modes.

Hi all,

I was maintaining a small discussion board at -
http://impactservices.in/forum/ which covers linux admin and FOSS. I
felt it would be nice to dedicate a site to FOSS for knowledge
sharing, collaboration and networking of professionals.

Hence, I started http://fossbase.in - I am still working on it.

The user profile module is almost over. It has facility to add avatar,
upload some photos, write about yourself and skillset etc. Member's
blog, website fields still need to be added.

I can arrange the below venue for any LUG (or GLUG or other)
activities.  Just give me 2 days advanced notice:

APG Matriculation Higher Secondary School,
FCI Road,
Ganapathy, 641006.

Can have a class room ready anytime.  Please bring your own
computer, projector, etc.  Meetings to be conducted during non
teaching hours.  If you permit, interested school students may
also attend.

You can run the following commands to install compiz from the terminal (To  
open terminal, goto Applications->Accessories->Terminal)

sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager  
simple-compizconfig-settings-manager

It will ask for your password. Once you type, it will also ask whether you  
wish to install the software. Press 'y' and it should be installed. You  
can check in "System->Preferences->Simple CompizConfig Settings" or  
something. Sorry, don't have my Ubuntu in front of me so cannot say the  
exact name :)

Two places. "Applications->Ubuntu Software Centre->Installed Software"  
(easiest) or "System->Administration->Synaptics Package Manager". Here  
search for the application you wish to know if it is installed. It will  
have a tick next to it.

Hi all,

Am posting this on both ilugc and ilughyd.

> 

1. Gave up on Kalculate - no response from the co. and no community edition either. Will strongly urge them to GPL it. 

2. Not trying to run Tally on Ubuntu. Also Tally has expanded to include ERP functionalities and cannot figure out from their site how to buy just the accounting part. Will continue with external accountant if forced to use Tally. 

3. GNUCash is on standby as its more tuned for US accounting. I would prefer an India specific package. Will support one of the evolving ones till its ready for use.

I looked at the 'avsap' link above but will appreciate feedback from actual users. are there people using this software? Also updates to this seem to be sporadic. KG generously offered a login to test it but I am yet to take him up on it. Am not an accountant - what will I test? :-)

I also looked at GNUKhata. This seems to be under more active development and am getting email digests from their user lists. 
GNUKhata seems relatively more mature. Installation seems fairly simple on Ubuntu 9.04. One issue is that they do not seem to have tested with an empty Database. I had a few crashes when I was adding master data. I have not proceeded to adding transactions yet. 

At this point I am partial to GNUKhata. Will update afer I check out avsap.

I am looking at India specific accounting software as hopefully these will be more in tune with Indian accounting and taxation practices. I also hope that as these softwares mature, they will automatically calculate tax, depreciation etc :-) I just want to enter data and click buttons for everything else :-)

I have to buy a book to learn accounting I guess (sigh!!! the travails of entrepreneurship)

Cheers,
kc

if you do not know accounts, avsap is of no use to you. (in fact if you
do not know accounts, better to employ some one who knows). Except for
very simple home accounting (which can be done with a spreadsheet) your
accounts will be in a mess if you do not know the basic principles of
double entry book keeping. Which goes for tally, gnukhatha, avsap or
anything else. You have to know which side to credit and which side to
debit. If you are interested in avsap, we have a few people in our team
who can guide you in the basics of double entry accountancy. We have not
updated the software in the last 4-5 months as we are assembling our
team. We are planning on restarting sometime this month.

Dear All

I have tested the Sugar Interface, 
As a teacher, I believe that Students need a common, widely used interface.
So that after school learning they can also continue at Home. I have tested
with my daughter , who is 2nd Std. She likes only LinuxMint and Puppy Linux.
It is difficult for her to come out of an application. Also Identifying the
job of an application. 

Sugar is Unique, also complex for our school children. [ you can recall that
all the "Games" software are have same type of menu and interface ]

However, we can add the applications which are highlighted / listed in the
sugar interface , to other distro. [ My heart goes to Linux Mint ]

So , kindly reconsider promoting Sugar.

Have a nice day
Thiagu

I too faced the same difficulty - could not exit. I feel sugar is not a
good interface for kids. Kids are not stupid. They are very smart and do
things that adults cannot do. I find that the sugar interface is built
for what Americans think that kids understand. I have seen many parents
giving their high funda cellphones to small kids and asking them how to
do this or that. And the kids find out and show them.

That's pretty much the point of Sugar.  It is designed for portable,
rugged and cheap laptops that students own and can carry home as opposed
to computers they cannot afford.  If you can afford the regular
computers, perhaps you are missing the underlying thought process.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinWKj2RME+ziA+KDTXQ2ezsMNu7K0kUR21sS7Oo@mail.gmail.com>

(x-posted to COCC, ChennaiRb and ILUGC)

Hi Folks,

Chennai has excellent groups like Chennai OCC, ILugC and
Chennai.[rb|py]. But what I found missing was a forum to have talks on
technology without being focussed on a single topic. We are living in
the best of times. We have tools and the computers that allow a single
person to create solutions that took teams of several individuals to
build. Also, as one becomes better at the craft, they tend to use the
right tool for the right job. In the future, I see that there is a
need for more polyglot hackers. The lines between the typical roles
such as Programmer, DBA, Sysadmin and QA are blurring. Earlier each
used to have separate tools and there was not much overlap. However,
in the current state, DBAs need to learn Javascript to work with
MongoDB and CouchDB. SysAdmins have to learn Chef or Puppet to create
recipes. QAs have to learn Selenium, Cucumber, RSpec and other test
suites and Programmers have to dabble with scripted tools like RVM and
virtualenv. There is a great convergence of these roles leading to my
favorite role - "The Passionate Hacker". This site is dedicated to
such passionate hackers who are willing to advance the craft.

I would want this group to foster the hacker spirit that is essential
to create just about anything. Although, I am biased towards open
source technologies, I do believe that people in the .NET camp should
have their fair share of excitement. They are welcome here as well.

This group is open to anyone who would like to pursue the exciting
craft of building software. I have also setup a?ChennaiGeeks.com
Facebook Group[1]. To start with, I would like to catalog all the tech
talks happening on various fora. I also take this opportunity to
invite bloggers to contribute technical content for this blog. It
could be on anything as long as it relates to technology.

So long. Keep hacking. You know I will.

Yep ! ...and my teacher also tells me that the correct and proper way to address 
non-believers is "infidels" and also that the proper way to deal with them is to 
bomb them so as to relieve them from the misery of their lives.

I can accept a ideology and still not prefer the name GNU/Linux.  I

Hi, I am facing a weird problem now a days. I am running a test streaming
server. For such issue I used Apple`s open source Darwin Streaming Server.
Here, some times ( in fact, it`s now and then now ) that server loose it`s
internet connectivity. If I restart that Debian machine, it becomes ok but
after some days, it starts the same thing again.

By the way, we are not serving live streaming, but, the streaming is serving
from hard drive contents with rtsp protocol.

Can you suggest me anything?

@Rahul and Raman: Is there any reasons why you still Do not prefer it to be
GLUG?
@Balajee: Adding some more views of yours along with "+1" will make us know
why you support this.
And I Saw this naming issue By yesterday night at the meeting of people and
I am suggested to  look at the history of this thread and to answer them 'If
I can'. I dug deep and thought of asking some Queries. I shoot them along
with the previous discussion.

I never said anything about a GLUG.  I was merely saying that support of
ideology and preference for a name are two different things.  I support
Free software.  Whether you want to call it a LUG or GLUG or a BLOB
makes no difference to me.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=X=S42eHkO2DLWfDmAazqX919M6e=ehNC8mu_T@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

 I am having a switch ,one server and 3 systems which are connected to
the switch. The IPs are 192.168.48.9, 108,109,110 respectively.
Netmask is 255.255.240.0 . Now there is no problem in ping command
among 108,109,110 always. But i can ping the server from only one
system either 108 or 109 or 110.  If 192.168.48.109 pings the server,
108,110 did not ping the server. After some interval 192.168.48.110
pings and 192.168.48.109,108 did not ping the server. I also checked
the cables. They are all right. What is the problem in network
connection? Can someone bring me out?

LUG seems to me a multi cultured domain, meaning people from all walks of

replied for question no 2, hope it answers this , my personal view though.

One of my question is not answered ! from our Glug friend..
Query1: Is a dual boot way of installing linux is permissible in a GLUG?.

I heard Mr.Siddarth of FSF India Talking on FSF principles in the august lug
meet about Anti Microsoft policy and went on saying "hitting an microsoft
guy".

on the other hand I would love to quote  Linus Torvalds sayings

 "I love seeing people who are really passionate about what they do, and
many people have something they really care about. It?s just that when that
becomes something exclusionary, it often gets ugly. It?s not passion for
something, it becomes passion against something else."

"This is, just to take an example, one of the reasons I try to avoid talking
much about Microsoft - I?m very passionate about Linux (obviously), but
quite frankly, I really find the whole notion of Linux as being ?against
Microsoft? to be silly and wrong-headed".


I leave to the wisdom of each individual on which line they need to pursue.

Well I am supposed to get an answer for "GOAL of LUG" in a different way. I
don't know about what adobe flex deals with. But what I believe is, we have
to find another solution for whatever the problem may be and Development
alone is what I believe. I believed ILUGC is to develop Linux environment.
If people uses proprietary, and If they are in LUG, they should try to
develop an alternative.

A learner can dual boot, then can covert into a developer(Where development
of what he found in proprietary good than GNU/Linux applications). That is
my view and Wherever I support, Development of Linux is also a key.

When I go to a school and speak about Mac, people never knows what LUG or
GLUG is trying to do. It must be a movement that reaches Every Indian. You
have to make people realize. I don't know about Mr.Siddarth's view as I was
not there and I don't want to comment him. and this is for the following
statement too.

It's an unmanagable (unprogrammable) switch only.

If its an unmanageable switch, try checking the tcpdump output and see if
you are receiving any ping packets on the server. similarly, check on the
systems if the packets are being sent consistently or not. If both are fine,
then try to check on another similar switch if you have one.

also, you can try different ports on the same switch. Might help.

Abhi

Message-ID: <AANLkTinvL5aUVk0bfQ=MfDMNaaBm+WLUL=R9HSjaf_2j@mail.gmail.com>

Application: SWFTools

What it is:

SWF Tools is a collection of SWF (Flash) manipulation and creation utilities.

Features:

The central tool is swfc which takes as input a description of a Flash
animation in a simple language and creates as output an SWF file. It
is possible to include ActionScript scripts into the generated SWF
file. SWFTools also includes the RFXSWF Library which allows to write
programs that generate SWF.
In addition SWFTools includes a number of tools to convert content in
the PDF, JPEG, GIF, WAV and AVI formats to SWF, and others to extract
information and content from existing SWF files. It's also possible to
embed other SWF files, which may be useful for animating static
pictures (for example, the static SWF files generated by
OpenOffice.org Impress and Draw).

To know more about:

http://www.swftools.org/

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install swftools

Friends.

Recently, wordpress.com changed its hitcount graphing to the
javascript library - flot.
http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/sexy-stats/

Flot is a pure Javascript plotting library for jQuery. It produces
graphical plots of arbitrary datasets on-the-fly client-side.
The focus is on simple usage (all settings are optional), attractive
looks and interactive features like zooming and mouse tracking.

Explore about flot here.

I am presuming the "server" is 192.168.48.9 since you have not
explicitly stated so.  What is your objective for using a /28 netmask?

Anyway, with a /28 netmask, the "server" is on a different subnet
vis-a-vis your other systems.  see [1] and [2]

Given you are using a /28 netmask this is interesting ... even though
the 2 subnets are on the same physical fabric, you would need some
kind of routing to occur for ping to work between hosts on the 2
subnets.

IMO, the netmask is your problem.  With a  /24 netmask all the
machines should be able to ping each other.  (make sure iptables and
SE Linux are disabled)

Buy a new switch if the problem still persists.

commandline dictionary

 $ wn wide -over

Note:

1) Replace "wide'' with any word you looking the meaning for in the
above example

2) Need to install these packages:

 wordnet & wordnet-base (latter should be automatically installed
because of dependency)

It's like Artha. :)

Subject: [Ilugc] c/c++ endian neutral disk i/o
Message-ID: <254933.22512.qm@web94712.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

Hello all ,
?
I have 2 questions on endian neutral? : 
?
1)I'm? dont need C++ Object Serialization per-se but I intend to write a few C structures to disk (file.bin) -
The written data structure on-disk should be portable across different platform architectures (small/big endian)
?
Would someone know where I can find some library and/or sample code to write portable C data structure to a disk storage. 
at least some guidelines and pointers / examples would be nice.
?
2) if have solaris code which genrates binary file and i have read it from Linux program .
?
so any specific thing i need to take care so that i can read big endian generated from soalris?? from Linux program which is on little endian 
?
?
Many thanks
N

If you use a character buffer C struct then it is endian neutral. Then
when you read back the structure by doing a cast using
 this code:

                                struct mydata *nw_struct;
                                  nw_struct = malloc(sizeof(mydata);
                                 memcpy((struct mydata *) &nw_struct,
buf, sizeof(struct mydata));

                                  Now you can send and receive from
across the network in an Endian neutral fashion.
                                  If you have longs or shorts inside
the struct, just use htonl(), htons() and vice versa.

                       This will surely work.

You have the code to achieve it.

See above.

On Sparc architecture? No problem. It will work. I have done that.

Nothing more than what I wrote above.

Endianness does not hurt when you use unsigned char buffers.

What is artha?

I use dict instead.

Far better than wn I think.

It uses the dictionary protocol described in RFC 2229.

While dict is nice ...
a. It requires you be to connected to a dict server (ie: connected to the net, 
unless you are running your own server !)

b. It is just a dictionary. Whereas wordnet is more like a thesaurus. For 
example to find opposites (antonmys) of a noun, verb, adjective, call:

wn [noun|verb|adjective] -ants[n|v|a]

eg:
$ wn top -antsn
$ wn go -antsv
$ wn bright -antsa

You can also find hypernyms, hyponyms and synonyms (besides other stuff that I 
do not understand or use). Run 'wn' without any arguments or 'man wn' for more info.

cheers,
- steve

Mea Culpa.

Most likely the OP has a bad switch; time for a replacement - go for a

Have a look at 'google protobuf' (http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/).
Store your content onto protobuf objects, serialize them onto disk and
load them back when needed.

Long back, I faced a similar problem due to the failure of the switch

Well, we really  cannot control any of that i guess. Besides, unless
its a trending topic that makes fun of the LUG, i guess we shouldn't
be giving it any more than its worth.

Post more relevant stuff with that tag? And try not to oppose each
other's views way too often. But then unless you do that, good ideas
aren't going to come out anyway!

Of-course it is.

"The real entertainment gimmick is the excitement, drama and mystery
of the subject matter. People love to learn something, they are
?entertained? enormously by being allowed to understand a little bit
of something they never understood before. One must have faith in the
subject and in people's interest in it.? - Richard Feynman

If you feel it is a scrap, better try postgresql.

Sure ! what's so bad about the lug list being entertaining to some ? That is the 
very nature of our community (by 'our' I mean the FOSS community). We should not 
take ourselves too seriously. Being part of the community should be Fun ! ..and 
the occasional flames, trolls, n00bs all are part of what makes us who we are. 
Denying that leads to a community which only has a whole bunch of 'serious' 
high-nosed elitists. There already exist mailing list in India of that nature. I 
am glad this list is not one of those.

If you use a character buffer C struct then it is endian neutral. Then
when you read back the structure by doing a cast using
this code:

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? struct mydata *nw_struct;
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? nw_struct = malloc(sizeof(mydata);
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ???memcpy((struct mydata *) &nw_struct,
buf, sizeof(struct mydata));

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Now you can send and receive from
across the network in an Endian neutral fashion.
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? If you have longs or shorts inside
the struct, just use htonl(), htons() and vice versa.

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ???This will surely work.

You have the code to achieve it.

See above.

Nothing more than what I wrote above.

Endianness does not hurt when you use unsigned char buffers.

Thanks Girish for your inputs ,
?
?
One more input in need from you is? as i mentioned i have solaris generated big endian binary file and i need to read the same big endian file in Linux which is little endian or on intel machine .
?
So is there anyway i can read big endian file in linux and process it and write the binary in big endian .
?
The reason why i am asking is becos i need to maintain the existing solaris code and i need to use linux to read and generate the big endian binary so that? solaris code can read the big endian file genarted by Linux 
?
in simple words i need to read/write the binary file which in bigendian from linux .
?
also i am mostly looking for disk i/o not much of network i/o
?
Thanks

When you read the data into a struct, it will be read as big-endian
and you can write it back as is, so long as you don't want to
interpret the numbers. To interpret, you can use macros defined in
/usr/include/endian.h.

+1 Completely agree . I am happy that ILUGC is continuing despite many
generations of experienced users , there are n00bs coming in in a

Sorry that is not the easy solution. This particular user, a doctor is using this login id from 1988.

I found that correct name of widget is Pager, I was searching under workspace switcher, desktop switcher etc.  That was my mistake.

In PHP i have created a global variable.

global $x

Instead defining this global variable in each method of a class,I like to
define the variable in class and make it available for all the methods
inside the same class.Your suggestions are welcome.

Access the global variable as:

$GLOBALS['Varname']

AFAIK This way, you don't need any declaration at all, to use the Global
Variable.

What different does it going to make ?

A variable is still a variable :-) No big deal.

You can still access the members as:

$GLOBALS['x']->MemberFunction()

Streaming is an often confusing term.

Do you want people from the Internet to view  your webcam video capture?

You need to port forward the RTSP port and do some advanced tricks to
do UDP hole punching or some such technique to
allow the outside world to view the video on a private IP.

Since protocols like RTP, FTP, PPTP use a non standard port as part of
the payload of handshake, this is very tricky.

But it can be done.

 You could use streaming libraries like live555 to achieve the same.

Even mplayer or ffmpeg can do the same thing.

But live555 is in C++ and mplayer and ffmpeg is in  C. Big difference no?

Is it a good thing to write in C++?

Find out for  yourself.

Best of luck.

Understand one thing.

Anything that is worth knowing cannot be taught.

So you have to learn yourself.

Courses can only introduce you to places where you can find knowledge.

You have to learn by hard work. And knowledge is not transferable as
most people think.

It is the most precious possession on earth.

While pinging, ARP packets are sent as broadcast transmission.

The output of wireshark is like

       " 3.000001  00:24:01:a3:99:4b   Broadcast       ARP     Who has

+1 on this. Nothing beats getting hands-on experience. Investing money in 
hardware is a better option than joining a training course. Get a system, if you 
already have one, get another :)

...or since you mentioned you were interested in networking, search ebay or 
something similar for cheap second hand routers[1] and start hacking. For 
instance, installing and configuring and managing (for example implementing 
traffic shaping or security) using OpenWRT or Tomato (or any one of these[2]) on 
an old wireless router can be a learning and gratifying experience which would 
never be taught in any training course.

If you already have hardware or if you /do/ want to join a course, I'd suggest 
taking up a hobby class instead. Expanding your field of interests helps in many 
subtle ways, including career progression.

cheers,

Check on 192.168.48.9 to see if it can see the ARP packets.

$ sudo -k

Make sudo forget password instantly

By default sudo 'remembers' password for a few minutes, so that you do
not need to re-enter password for a series of sudo commands that might
follow within a short time duration.

However, sometime you might want sudo to instantly 'forget' the password.

(Next sudo command will need you to reenter the password)  ;-)

Message-ID: <AANLkTimNh016inpONtADbHUVeG5e7QqeUyGB3qbg_XwU@mail.gmail.com>

Hello friends,

Do any one use DREAMBOX[1] here in india. They say one can watch many free
to air channels, some add that it decrypts almost all channels. Is this is
legal in india under the ministry of broadcasting or relevant agencies?. At
the age of having mobile number transferred from one service provider  to
another, I feel one can switch the service providers in the satellite
television domain  as well. More than all , it fascinates me because it runs
Linux in it :). Any information please share.

Check the connection info by right clicking on the Network Icon
(normally shown in the right top) OR run the ifconfig command from the
terminal.

Try to learn some of the basic set of Linux commands.

Is it a laptop? In-build speakers are available and working? Did you
checked the volume setting?

If nothing works, connect an external speaker and enjoy the music :)

I ping 192.168.48.9 from both 109 and 110 and i captured the packets
at server using tcpdump. When i opened it using wireshark it shows the
ping request from 110 and ping reply to 110, but nothing for 109. When
i saw ARP packets it shows,

Instead of using a variable as global, declare a variable in a class and use
it in all the methods (functions) within the class as given below. create an
object and then call the methods with the required parameters using the
object.

<?php
Class var1         // declaring a class
{
var $a;           //declaring a variable in a class

function incr($par)        //method1 using the class variable "a"
{
  $this->a = $par;        // assigning the value of the parameter to the
class variable "a"
   echo $this->a;        // output the class variable "a" using "this"
operator
}
function incr1()             //method2 using the class variable "a"
{
  echo $this->a;         //here "a" is globally accessed
}
}

$ob1 = new var1;            //creating an object
      $ob1->incr(100);            // calling method1 using the object "ob1"
with one parameter "100"
      $ob1->incr1();               // calling method2 using the same object
"ob1"
?>


Hope this helps answering your query.

Hello Everyone,
             I downloaded a video file ( Ripped) file to my ubuntu machine.
When i try to play the file in VLC, *This video is encrypted. please
download the codec from infoavi.com* message appears. I searched in google
and could find a clear solution. I am sure, one of the movie freak and also
a linux lover would have gone thru this and found a solution already. If you
have anything, please let me know.

Friends.

Here is a nice gift to the ilugc community.

http://wiki.ilugc.in

So happy to dedicate the wiki to our ilugc team.

The new wiki is fresh and there is no old data.
Let us create our new contributions.

Some points to note:
Only registered members to http://wiki.ilugc.in, can edit the pages.
All pages are CAPTCHA enabled to avoid spam.


Remembering the old days of having wiki pages for
CD/DVD Sharing
Event Registrations
Articles
Tips & Tricks
etc

Let us contribute for the great contents in the wiki pages.

Thanks a lot for ArunSAG, Akilan and Balachandar for the
deep discussions in #ilugc-in

Enabling the CAPTCHA for the wiki is a great work and
thanks for the team's hardwork.

Happy to see a lot of helping hands to contribute to the ILUGC community.

Let us taste the true community sprit.

Welcome to http://wiki.ilugc.in

Go to System->Preferences->Sound->Output and try changing the

Good to see wiki back.

Is it possible to have editors like tinymce integrated with mediawiki? That will be helpful. Foswiki (http://foswiki.org/) does it by default.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimVMEskQz=utRr0eDP2T+Hw2Zp=R9sJE8xG6G0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I have been using Debian for a long time but I have never faced such
network connectivity problem before. I am facing problem like:

In on laptop of office, I installed Debian 5.0 for test purpose. Darwin
Streaming Server is running there. But, sometimes, suddenly, network stopped
it`s work!! Then, I cannot ssh or my clients ( now, my fellow team members )
cannot connect to that server.

And, If I physically plug out and then plug in that cable, it becomes ok.

What do you think, what may be the problem?

To: Shrinivasan T <tshrinivasan@gmail.com>


Hi Shrini,
Please find the?Introduction to Drupal session notes:



Why should you use a CMS for your website:

Clean separation of content from look-feel.?Content creation team
creates website content,?CSS/HTML designers create website theme.
Syntactically correct HTML, easy Search Engine Optimization, sitemap
generation, content aggregation, update notification, etc.
Modules/plugins extend base functionality of a CMS to great heights.
Drupal API and modules allows sophisticated functionality to be built
entirely inside Drupal.

Why?NOT?use a CMS:

It may be very difficult to create some unique requirements which do
not cleanly fit into a CMS feature set.

A CMS makes many commonly used features very easy to implement, and
some features very difficult to implement. ?It's essential to
thoroughly understand the requirement, and if possible even change the
requirements so that fits within the CMS capabilities.



CMS landscape:

Wordpress -- (worthy of it's own talk), exceptionally easy to create
sites with static pages and blog posts. ?Can be used entirely by end
users with minimal IT exposure. Ideal for small business, product
announcement or personal websites and blogs.
Drupal -- picks up where Wordpress left off. ?Great for medium to
large websites.
Joomla, MODx, RadiantCMS, etc ? similar to Drupal in feature set, but
probably have smaller communities.
Rails/Django ? some people prefer to use a web framework instead of
limiting themselves within the confines of a CMS. ?The extra freedom
is paid by the efforts in coding (no free lunch).

Why Drupal:

Large development and user community. ?Drupal Association
(association.drupal.org) formalized in 2006.? Drupal is here to stay.
Commercial and community support available from several sources.
Excellent subprojects ? Drupal for Education, Drupal for Collaboration
(OpenAtrium is a Drupal clone/fork(?) which focuses on team
collaboration).
Thousands of modules to extend Drupal functionality
High profile websites use Drupal ? White House, Yahoo and SUN
Research,?FedEx,?Linux Journal,The Economist,?NATO, World Food
Program, ?Amnesty International, Green Peace UK,?etc.
Drupal can be cheaply deployed and is shared hosting friendly ? PHP,
MySQL is base requirement, certain modules also depend on Apache.

Why NOT Drupal:

Drupal does not have a wealth of ready made themes like Wordpress.
Making Drupal sites look good takes some effort -- theming tutorial,
and the Zen base theme are good starting points.
Drupal's size and complexity can put off beginners. ?But there's
plenty of online video tutorials to get you started, and several
Powered by Drupal websites to get you inspired.

Core Drupal concepts:

Content: several content types available -- pages, blogs, forums,
custom content types, etc.
Navigation and menus: primary menu, secondary menu, navigation menu
(typically for logged in users).
Blocks: specify page elements, and how to place them together on final
output pages.
Themes: final look and feel

Installing Drupal:

Follow the Getting Started section of the Drupal documentation
(drupal.org/getting-started/install)
After you have setup your DB, and installed Drupal core, it's time to
enable and install some modules.
Core modules to be enabled -- "Path" and "Upload" module. ?You can
enable modules after logging in as admin and select Modules from the
Navigation menu on left.
Don't forget to setup cron as per the installation docs.
Install the drupal shell (drush) to simplifying module installation
(see more-beer-less-effort video below).

Essential Drupal modules for every site:

Path (core module): create meaningful permanent URLs for your pages.
Aggregator (core module): used to pull RSS feeds from other sites and
display them on your site.
Ping (core module): notify other sites whenever content on your site changes.
notewords: set default and custom meta tags for every page/post/content.
sitemap, xml_sitemap: can submit sitemap in xml format to search engines.
google_analytics: track visitors using Google Analytics.
boost: high performance Drupal cache, note: incompatible with mobileplugin.
domain, mobileplugin, wurfl: detect mobile browsers and redirect them
to mobile version of your site.
trigger, rules, action: these modules allow you to build custom
workflows for your content.
CCK, Views: these two modules allow you to construct custom content
types, and render them online.

CCK and Views offer excellent flexibility and power to Drupal. ?Eg.
for a real estate website, you can construct a CCK object for every
property with all the necessary fields (address, photo, sq ft area,
price, etc) and use Views to input the fields (HTML forms) as well as
list them online in various ways. ?For online shops, the ubercart
module offers a full blown ecommerce solutions.

Hi friends,

   I found that there is an internal switch in 192.168.48.9 server
system. The problem is with the port in internal switch. I changed the
port and now everything is fine. Thanks to all who spent time to clear
me. Thanks again.

Thank you. Yes, it will be great. But, it is not our priority now. We will
be working on integrating a WYSIWYG editor first.

Lets use the default Wiki editing mode for some time. thats what
wikipedia uses. adding WYSIWYG to wiki adds lot of HTML tags which are
not necessary.

I would suggest that we should keep it as it is. As many wiki editors
know the default wiki editing mode. personally, i dont like WYSIWYG
for wiki.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=8Cf22JPhAQH8XueFDW4HAZC-9N+0v8ZXVDMGT@mail.gmail.com>

Application: lifelines

What it is:

LifeLines is a genealogy program that runs on UNIX systems in text mode. It
maintains genealogical records (persons, families, sources, events and
others) in a database, and generates reports from those records.

There are no practical limits on the number of records that can be stored in
a LifeLines database, nor on the amounts or kinds of data that can be
kept in the records.

LifeLines does not contain built-in reports. Instead it provides a
programming subsystem that you use to program your own reports and
charts. Some standard report files are included in the
lifelines-reports package.

The programming subsystem also lets you query your databases and
process your data in any way. LifeLines uses the terminal independent
features of UNIX to provide a screen and menu based user interface.

The program is able to read and write GEDCOM files, the de facto
standard for genealogical data exchange.

To know more about:

http://lifelines.sourceforge.net/

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install lifelines

Now the things are changed. Students are most aware about open source.

I heard about NRC-FOSS which is funded by central government. They have to
support colleges. But I dont know now they are working r not?

As per the AICTE norms engineering colleges may use open source software.
But the AICTE committee people not aware about open source.

It is their(NRC-FOSS) duty to educate the committee people about open source

If approached NRC-FOSS There is no proper answer. I went NRC-FOSS directly

It is great that your problem is solved but ....

Please clarify what you mean by "internal switch" in the server.  Does
the server come with a built in ethernet switch?  I have never come
across such a thing.  It would be great if you could give the hardware
details about your server e.g. brand/model of motherboard and the
installed cards.

LCD displays do not work on windows - it must have been connected to a
computer running windows. And what is your problem with this? NRC-FOSS
is housed in the AU-KBC centre which also does a lot of work in
proprietary software - so it is quite natural that they use windows.

1. do not top post
2. wikis use wiki syntax - learn to live with it. And newbies can
experiment on the LUG wiki where we can help them out so that later they
can contribute to other wikis without making fools of themselves.

This is not an acceptable argument. It is like saying web uses HTML - live with it -don't use frameworks, cms, wiki's.
Posting content is more important, so anything which can help in this like WYSIWYG must be encouraged. If the underlying software has some problem let us try to overcome it or shift to others like foswiki which has this feature built-in.

you left out answering the second part of my argument - in most software
products, there are bare wikis - very few professionals waste time with
offering more than the basic wiki syntax. I find newbies are scared of
this and hence do not contribute. I find that even many people are
scared of contributing to wikipedia. If the LUG is to be a training
ground for producing people who can contribute (not only code, but more
important, documentation) they *must* learn wiki syntax. Otherwise, the
moment they join some project, we will hear 'pls 2 mk WYSIWYG'. And to
answer the argument that 'web is html, so only allow raw html', I agree
that this is silly. But at the same time I know of a lot of so-called
web designers who do not know html, or css, and only know how to drag
and drop in dreamweaver - that is not the 'nix way - one must know the
basics in order that one is not a slave to the software tool. And LUG
must show the way.

I hope they are not expecting NRC-FOSS to setup labs for them for free.

Hi,

We are continuing our online packaging sessions from this Thursday.
Every one is invited. Those who are interested to attend please start
reading "new maintainers' guide". The whole session will be based on
that. We will split the session to two - one for people who attended
mini debconf (#debian-in-mentors) and another for those who are new
(#debian-in). Hoping to see some mentors to help me out as well.

For those who are familiar with packaging, it will be a work out
session where you can get real time help with your packages. For new
people we start with an example package.

Thanks
Praveen

basker is there - on a shoe string budget he is doing more than NRC-FOSS
has been able to do with all the central government crores! (and do not
take this as a criticism of NRC-FOSS - govt/univ bodies are constrained,
motivated individuals can do much more. All we can do is give initial

1.It is not necessary to have RICH content, but a WYSIWYG editor does help in posting quickly, as compared with wiki-editor. 

2.We need wiki because we need many people to add content. Plain text or plain html only sites doesn't help in collaborative content. Only some part of website requires wiki. Main pages still need not be on wiki.

3.WYSIWYG editors are safely and easily integrated with other wiki/cms like foswiki,twiki,wordpress,plone etc. Should not it be easy with mediawiki also?

Hey Venu ,

I recommend you use 

LinuxMint (Debian ) 

Omega ( Redhat )

These two distros come with default multimedia support .ie., with all plugins .

Try this .

It's Suguna Spark Business School, Kallipalayam, Coimbatore (Now, I am here
in the college to complete the full foss lab setup)

Also, 3 months back I was here during AICTE inspection and AICTE committee
people are aware about open source and also accepted, and they did not
insist on any proprietary software/os.  (Kenneth helped through NRC-FOSS by
providing a letter to the college regarding this FOSS implementation)

It was a childish move to pre-pone the release to 10-10-10. :)

I don't see much of changes to the release, except for a  few fonts,
Eucalyptus upgrades and colour schemes. Can you please tell me or point
me to a page where I can find a list of changes?

One more way of viewing multiple jpg files in a pdf reader (evince,
okular) is to zip all the jpgs and change the extension name from .zip
to .cbz

*cbz stands for comic book archive. (To view image files of a comic
book in a document reader)

p.s.: The output file is not a pdf.
p.s.2.: Not all pdf readers like Adobe Acrobat support .cbz format

Please send the httpd.conf and its included conf file and most
importantly error log and access log. Probabaly apache is crashing and
restarting itself. Which you describe as slow. Probab;y something is
mis configured. without the access log and error log and those conf
files it is almost impossible to help.

You are browsing while the torrents are running?

Hi Aswin ,

 This what i analyzed


1.  If you enter the website URL in the browser it will load easily.

2.  After login the website try refreshing  after 3 to 5 min. Then it will
load too slowly. Once it get refreshed then

   it will be fine.

3. Keep it idle again for 3 to 5 min . And if u reload it again too slow


FYI the website hosted in local server.


This what my problem.


Regards

Jithin K

Since it is local server, network problem is ruled out.

Look at the process running in your system. I feel it may be using swap. Look at top output. Stop unwanted process. Also it may not be due to apache, look at your browser also.

Message-ID: <1286982800.1506.8.camel@tamizhgeek-desktop>

Hi,

I recently had a problem with my motherboard and replaced it with a new
one. After that the audio stopped working. I used alsaconf to
reconfigure it again with no success. After that I recently did a fresh
install of ubuntu 10.10. Now when I play something a loud noise is heard
from the speaker. But the song is also playing behind the noise. I used
alsamixer and checked, the PCM level is 100%. I can't raise master or
other controls. The Audio controller from lspci output is this,

<snip>
00:14.2 Audio device: ATI Technologies Inc IXP SB4x0 High Definition
Audio Controller (rev 01)
</snip>

The speaker is fine. It plays well with the other devices.
Can anybody guess what could be the problem?

You could also use the gs command for that.

gs works with images? I have used gs for merging pdf documents but

Yes. Check the CPU usage with top command when you make page request.

IO error reading from CD or writing to your HDD?


> is there a way to check the CD I have burnt ?

Easy way: mount your CD on an working system and try
copying the entire contents of the CD to HDD.  If you
get a read error, then the CD is buggered.

You may as well do this on another computer to rule out
possible CD/DVD drive issues.

Harder way: run as root, dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/tmp/test.iso
If it completes successfully, you have no errors on your CD.
md5sum of test.iso should match with your original iso images.

Smarter way: when you burn any iso to disc, ensure you
always verify after writing.

+1 , All we as outsiders need to remember that the more we cry/shout
on Govt/univ organisations/bodies the more we would be alienating them
.

The best we could do is to see if we could help them come closer to
the community . Try personally emailing them twice before we bring the
issue to a mailing list .

Good that you have taken initiative to go to that place , well '
windows ' a propreitary OS is not IMHO a huge 'Hall of Shame' kind of
thing ,but did you see how many free softwares that windows had
installed?

Some people still use the propreitary windows because of their comfort
levels in using a distro /environment . But I think with proper
guidance and our(community) efforts in explaining the importance and
values of free software , things might change .

Lets hope to hear more from them and collaborate more from them .

Well Syllabus change and good support by NRCFOSS AUKBC to the events
in and around tamilnadu with a strong ILUGC backing did rock chennai
in terms of FOSS :)

Well NRCFOSS AUKBC has planted a seed called 'FOSSCONF'  , would love
to see the tree and the fruits :)

hi,
This is an unanswered question for me from the time i entered into
open world! (8 or 9 months before).
how people doing business using opensource software. Most of the
opensource software are available at free of cost how are they gaining
money to run the organization, for eg. canonical ltd. provides ubuntu
os for free of cost even they are shipping cd for free,there is a team
to work who is paying them. how they run the organization without
getting penny amount from people. if source is from donation then i
think an organization cannot be ran by having donation only as their
source.

It could potentially affect Wine and the files it uses or has access
to, but not the Linux installation. This reminds me of an old article
which appeared on Linux.com:

http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/42031

The best way to find out would be to actually insert the disk and see
what happens! What's the worst which could happen (assuming you have
backed up all your important files, which you should do periodically
anyway).

Most of the business involves "SELLING" support. Support (directly from the
company or its partners) costs money. True, there are people on forums and
mailing lists who can help a lot. But if an enterprise is involved, it would
be good to have a paid subscription for support since mission critical

I hear that "Mark Shuttleworth" (who founded and probably is funding
canonical) is a "very rich" entrepreneur. He's the second self-funded space
tourist !! He is a venture capitalist and has his own private jet. That
apart. Canonical also sells support.

One other business model is to make some components of the eco-system
commercial. For. e.g. Canonical has "Landscape" which is a "configuration
management system" ( to put it simply ). Users have to pay for Landscape
subscription.

Read up on : Landscape, canonical and mark shuttleworth. And about open
source business models on wiki.

Hi,

System -> Administration -> Software Sources
Go to updates tab
Select "Normal Releases" from the Release upgrades section.
Close

System -> Administration -> update manager
Click Check button. And simply follow instructions.

Make sure you have a solid internet connection.

Well, this might not be a perfect answer, but what I know of as an answer.

Arguably the 3 big 'free linux desktop OS' companies - Canonical
(Ubuntu), Red Hat (Fedora) and Novell (openSUSE) also run something
called as 'Enterprise' business. They sell enterprise
software/operating system to corporate companies (the 'E' in all these
stands for 'Enterprise' - RHEL, SLES, SLED). Ubuntu does not have an
'Enterprise' OS, but they're moving in quickly for 'Enterprise Cloud'.
(Ubuntu as a brand is not profitable yet for the company). Apart from
this, they also sell services such as customer support, training,
consultancy, integration.

This has been the business model (more or less) for companies that
work with and promote opensource/free software.

Side Note: Sun Microsystems followed a similar approach, infact they
had hardware sales too with SPARC-based systems than ran on Solaris.
However, some bad decisions at the executive level and recession
cannot even same a multi-billion dollar company.

They reside under /var/ .
Configuration files reside under /etc/
Try to knock windows off your mind when you think about software in Linux.
They work differently. Windows has its own idiosyncrasies. Read up on Linux
filesystem hierarchies and about what goes where.

Normally, you won't need to look at the "program files". Let the list know
what exactly you want to be able to do and someone will help you.

Unfortunately, it is not that straight forward to use USB with wine.
It seems there are ways to do it - http://wiki.winehq.org/USB,

but then, the questions that need to be asked is:
1. Do you really need WINE? (linux has better softwares than the one
that will run on WINE and the softwares that are truly unique and not
available in linux usually don't run on WINE)

2. If you know your USB has virus that would affect Windows

.. file systems, why risk using it in the first place, windows based
viruses will be easily found in linux file system, take a backup of
your USB data in linux, format your USB and then use it with Windows
or WINE.

This might help if your question was out of curiosity:

typical example: a friend was asked to quote for some complicated
network setup. The windows people had quoted something like 8 lakhs for
software and 1.5 lakhs for installation and configuration. My friend
quoted 0 lakhs for software and 7.5 lakhs for installation,
configuration and one year support. So who earned more? Typically since
the software is free and installation and configuration are one time
affairs, we can charge much more than the proprietary guys. (and our
time is worth much more)

In products business, the margins for the SI/reseller is low. Money is made
in services. The "Total Cost of Ownership" TCO is high.

If a smart person invests time and puts together a suite of software tha
delivers the results, he can sell it based on TCO. If the opensource
solution is sold at half the TCO, the money the person makes would be far
more than what he would make providing services on closed source products.

E.g replacing an Exchange 250 user server with Postfix+ courier+ webmail or
Zimbra/Scalix would be a good case.

This scenario holds good for most commonly used applications (especially
those that are user licence based) but may fail in mission critical s/w like
ERP.

Shuttleworth made his money from proprietary software when he sold
Thawt to Verizon.  Canonical might have some revenues, but they are
not profitable yet.  RedHat makes money (and profits) by selling Open
Source software, and support.

There must be other companies which make money from Free and/or Open
Source software, but it would be hard to imagine that (m)any of them
have greater revenues than those generated by the largest grossing
closed source software.

Did your friend get the contract?  A company might be swayed by a 26%
saving in software cost.  But what fraction was this of the total
costs of setting up the network?

Hi Sivaji,

 I have done MySQL optimization..

 And i check out the time taken for each query . And  i am sure that its not
the problem with MySQL

And CPU usage is less.

he got the contract - I have no idea what fraction this was of the total
cost of setting up the network, but it would have been only a small
fraction. (btw, there is a company that charges 2.5 lakhs to set up a 60
seat FOSS lab - and Basker does it free. So who makes more money?)

Subject: [Ilugc] altering tables with postgres
Message-ID: <1287038021.2238.56.camel@localhost>

hi,

I have the following code which is self explanatory:

begin;
alter table web_stockist add column "contactperson" varchar(200);
alter table web_stockist add column "designation" varchar(200);

update web_stockist set contactperson = 'xyz';
update web_stockist set designation = 'xyz';

alter table web_stockist alter column contactperson set not null;
alter table web_stockist alter column designation set not null;
end;

it does not work. it complains: 'no column called contact person' and
later 'cannot set not null because there are pending transactions'. This
works:

begin;
alter table web_stockist add column "contactperson" varchar(200);
alter table web_stockist add column "designation" varchar(200);
end;
begin;
update web_stockist set contactperson = 'xyz';
update web_stockist set designation = 'xyz';
end;
begin;
alter table web_stockist alter column contactperson set not null;
alter table web_stockist alter column designation set not null;
end;

how can I get everything into one transaction?

Sorry if this hijacks the discussion, i've not been totally following
the thread. But I quickly wanted to add one point replying this
message. I am not sure if Basker is doing this for a living. Companies
do whatever they do for a living. If Basker does so for a living, I
really want to get some first-hand experience working with him (its a
delicate balance and if he does it I'd love to learn it from him,
otherwise unintended pun in that sentence be excused!). I am a little
surprised the company that quoted 7.5 for support actually won the
contract when MS prod+suport was only 3L more. But then that is what
it is. Linux and GNU could be passion but I am not sure how many times
passions also serve food.

Ok, it probably does not reply the message. Just my thought.

It seems that the largest contributors to F/OSS don't make their money
by selling support and/or software, but rather services built on them
- Google, Facebook.  I don't know what Oracle, IBM make from F/OSS.

This is not to say that people don't make money from F/OSS, KG's
friend seems to be doing quite well.  But then there are others making
money by selling services to closed source software.

the largest contributor to the kernel and the GNU toolchain and many
other parts of the linux OS is Redhat.

I still do not see where they are selling open source software - as far
as I can see is that all they are selling is their brand/trademark. One
can download all of their software for free and use and redistribute it
if one removes the brands - which is what centos does. Selling open
source software reminds me of the guy on marina beach who is trying to
make his first crore out of selling buckets of seawater.

Google and Facebook should be more or less considered as users of FOSS
, they hardly contribute back to FOSS , only good thing being the
summer of code and other code releases from google which more or less
are heavily aimed at revenue generation . On FB , its the best
"closed" company  ever !

> ?I don't know what Oracle, IBM make from F/OSS.

Oracle with its take over of sun has invaded into muddy waters . A
slashdot search of oracle will tell you its story .

IBM on the other hand should be appreciated for its kernel
contributions , apache,eclipse and lot other contributions despite
AIX,Websphere, Websphere studio and its other propreitary products .

        True. It has practically killed open solaris and is
suffocating other FOSS projects there. I heard its the same about
Java. So, Oracle as such, shouldn't be considered a free open source
software company. Thanks

indeed. And I like this:

phpsh provides an interactive shell for PHP that features readline
history, tab completion, and quick access to documentation. It is
ironically written mostly in Python.

Your name? Govi or Govinda?

Anyway underlying your seemingly facile question are certain
deep technical topics.

If you configure 3 different IP addresses with different netmasks then
 they belong to different subnets/networks. But if you assign
the same netmask then of course the network is same.

But in all cases the packets always come out and come in thro'
the same physical eth0 interface.

You can however change the source IP of packets with the appropriate
switches if a particular command supports that. I am sure ping does.

I normally do not have any issue with which interface is chosen for
packet transfer.

And I do a lot of my dev work using IP aliasing. I use qemu and with that
I can get a lot of virtual interfaces for doing the sort of interface specific
 manipulation and monitoring that you want to do.

Hi Guys,

 I think that after login  to website , after a 5or 10 minute ideal
condition . The server is closing the connection and for reestablishing the
connection it takes much time.

 Any idea ?

hi,

I am trying to make image maps in gimp. The first two or three worked
fine. I am saving the files as ping. When saving as ping a cautionary
dialogue box comes up to fill in some values. Now when saving my map,
that dialogue box is not coming up, and I cannot view the file - the
browser says 'loading meta information failed'. Has anyone faced this
problem?

Yes, that is true. The RHEL CD contains Red Hat trademarks which cannot be 
redistributed by anyone except Red Hat. You can, if you wish to, remove all the 
trademarks (even from the included binaries) and redistribute the CD.

PS: I have clarified a bit about Red Hat's policies in my blog post here:

Application: celtx

What it is:

Celtx is the world's first all-in-one media pre-production software. It has
everything you need to take your story from concept to production. Celtx
replaces 'paper, pen & binder' pre-production with a digital approach that's
more complete, simpler to work with, and easier to share.

Features:

*Multi-Media Friendly*
Celtx helps you pre-produce all types of media - film, video, documentary,
theater, machinima, comics, advertising, video games, music video, radio,
podcasts, videocasts, and however else you choose to tell your story.

*All In One*
Unlike scriptwriting software and sites, you can use Celtx for the entire
pre-production process - write scripts, storyboard scenes and sequences,
develop characters, breakdown & tag elements, schedule production, and prepare
detailed and informative production reports for cast and crew.

*Fully Integrated*
Celtx is designed to help your entire production team work together on a
single, easy to share project file - eliminating the confusion of multiple
project files, and the need for 'paper and binder'.

*World Community of Media Creators*
More than 500,000 media creators in 160 countries create with Celtx in 28
different languages. Celtx is used by independent filmmakers and studio
professionals, and by students in over 1,800 universities and film schools -
many that have adopted Celtx for teaching and class work submission.

*The Best of The Desktop & The Web*
Celtx is a desktop application that delivers the most fluid writing and
editing experience. You can always keep your fingers moving as fast as your
thoughts and your creative flow is never interrupted. With Celtx you can also
work at any time off-line and privacy is never a concern.

Celtx Studios use the web to deliver a central server's superior strength for
heavy-lifting tasks such as mass storage, collaboration and e-commerce.

No other film production software gives you the advantages of the Celtx-Celtx
Studios hybrid desktop-web architecture.

*Non-Linear Project Development*
Unlike scriptwriting software and sites, Celtx puts a choice of fully
integrated development tools right at your fingertips, giving you total
flexibility to determine how your story takes shape.

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install celtx

Hi all,

No!
I have also checked TMPTIME parameter  set to 0 which means delete
files from /tmp at reboot as per the link.

Here's the output of dmesg after the device was inserted. The connection

Do you infer something from this? The connections are still flaky and as

ttyUSB's using wvdial?? would it help speed up things? Just curious :)

Subject: [Ilugc] Preventing Execution under home directories
Message-ID: <4CB7B995.3030601@gmail.com>

Hi,

I wanted to prevent execution of file (binaries and scripts) under the
home directory. I know I can do this by:

sudo mount -o remount,noexec /home/user

But I also want to prevent execution of scripts under the dir. For e.g.
I can do a sh /home/user/filename.sh and it would still run the script.
So I want to deny access to interpreters to the home directory.

sh
bash
perl
php
python etc.

What tool would I need to use? I was thinking of apparmor since it does
path based stuff. What would you suggest??

Yogesh.

Yes, I am doing it free, only for the first time (a 60 seat FOSS lab
installed with 4500+ packages, requires only 6 hours for me to setup) and
further would insist the college/institution to buy our FOSS Lab server, if
they decide for a complete FOSS migration throughout the institution (few
institutions have already bought our FOSS lab server and currently we are
supporting more than 200+ institutions in Tamilnadu).

Now, I am thinking about extending this FOSS lab setup services to other
region/states, if ILUG-C or other LUG's in India could help/support this
initiative.

I am much more comfortable in doing this for my living (almost 8+ years) and
also happy about helping the education in the long run.

As this FOSS entrepreneur sees education as a big/strong market in India,  I
am sure, we will always be alive and strong enough to keep supporting
education.

We are targeting about 1500+ institutions across Tamilnadu in implementing
FOSS in the next 5 years.  (soon will post some interesting stats about the
use of FOSS in engg./technical institutions in Tamilnadu)

I think you are using alsa. If so try alsamixer.

as usual problem between chair and keyboard. What the map dialogue does
is create a .map file. It does not add anything to the original. So
saving a .map file as a .png file does not make it a .png file.

Message-ID: <611816.38086.qm@web33102.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

We too are making quite a healthy living with Free software. There are a lot of cos. who do so too.

You can charge USD/hr kind of rates even for Indian clients and most of them end up with solutions which are lesser than 50% of MS/Proprietary solutions.

Most small IT service companies make tons of money with LAMP/Drupal/Joomla etc. But most of them do not give anything back to the community or to the products they use.

We go the additional step of making donations/contributions to almost all FOSS tools/products that we use.

And yes, I live in upmarket place in Hyd, bought 42'LCD, Mitsubishi Cedia, and tons of electronic goodies and all from FOSS consulting. I make about 30%-40% more than my peers and we are completely FOSS - ROR/Liferay/Alfresco.

Careers in FOSS are quite rewarding but FOSS alone does not guarantee that. You also need to have business acumen. Else, if you are great with tech, just join a FOSS firm like Red Hat, Novell, rknowsys :-) etc. You will of course get paid well and will have the satisfaction of contributing to FOSS too.

  1.Through "update Manager" itself you upgrade your system as latest OS.And
you cannot install through CD. But you must have the internet connection to
update your system

2.Go to Update Manager it will show the latest update package.Here it will
show "Ubuntu 10.10 is avaiable to upgrade" at the top of the "Update Manager
Window".

3.click the "upgrade" button it will take 5 steps to upgrade.

4.At the 4 th step it will ask "remove and keep". Please select "keep", it
will used to keep the old files and softwares in old original position. To
avoid the data loss through this way.

5. After restarting the system you have same files with new OS.

        Enjoy with UBUNTU 10.10

Pease also refer the "yogesh Girikumar" mail for repository update and
settings.

Subject: [Ilugc] OAOD (OpenFOAM)
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=zYT3+qst5nXpqx0YB3Hj896Gs_sDaVOpjg46G@mail.gmail.com>

Application: OpenFOAM

What it is:

OpenFOAM is a free, open source CFD software package produced by a
commercial company, OpenCFD Ltd. It has a large user base across most
areas of engineering and science, from both commercial and academic
organisations. OpenFOAM has an extensive range of features to solve
anything from complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions,
turbulence and heat transfer, to solid dynamics and electromagnetics.

To know more:

http://www.openfoam.com/

To install in Ubuntu:

OpenFOAM and Paraview can be simply installed using the apt package
management tool. The user will need to provide superuser password
authentication when executing the following commands with sudo

In a terminal window, add OpenFOAM to the list of repository locations
for apt to search by adding an entry to the /etc/apt/sources.list file
(note: this only needs to be done once for a given system).

sudo sh -c "echo deb http://www.openfoam.com/download/ubuntu lucid
main >> /etc/apt/sources.list"

Update the apt package list to account for the new download repository location

 sudo apt-get update

Install OpenFOAM (171 in the name refers to version 1.7.1):

sudo apt-get install openfoam171

Install Paraview (380 in the name refers to version 3.8.0):

sudo apt-get install paraviewopenfoam380

User Configuration
In order to use the installed OpenFOAM package, complete the following

Open the .bashrc file in the user?s home directory in an editor, e.g.
by typing in a terminal window (note the dot)

gedit ~/.bashrc

At the bottom of that file, add the following line  (note the dot) and
save the file

 . /opt/openfoam171/etc/bashrc

This change to the .bashrc file will be
 . ~/.bashrc

Open a new terminal window and test that the icoFoam application, from
the OpenFOAM package, is working by typing

icoFoam -help

A ?Usage? message should appear. Your installation and user
configuration is complete.
Notes:
 If a similar line has already been added to the user?s .bashrc file,
e.g. for a previous version of OpenFOAM, then the line should be
deleted or, alternatively, commented out by inserting a # at the start
of the line.
 If the user wishes to execute icoFoam in the same terminal window, he
must first register the change to the .bashrc file by typing at the
terminal prompt (note the dots):  . $HOME/.bashrc
Getting Started
Create a project directory within the $HOME/OpenFOAM directory named
<USER>-1.7.1 (e.g. chris-1.7.1 for user chris and OpenFOAM version
1.7.1) and create a directory named run within it, e.g. by typing:

mkdir -p $FOAM_RUN
Copy the tutorial examples directory in the OpenFOAM distribution to
the run directory. If the OpenFOAM environment variables are set
correctly, then the following command will be correct:

cp -r $FOAM_TUTORIALS $FOAM_RUN
Run the first example case of incompressible laminar flow in a cavity:

cd $FOAM_RUN/tutorials/incompressible/icoFoam/cavity
blockMesh
icoFoam
paraFoam

hi,

i am in free world! enjoying the freedom.

we have variety of os whichever we can choose to our wish.
we dont need antivirus.
we have secure os than other proprietary os.
we have thousands of softwares to use that can be downloaded easily
via internet.
we have lots of forums and lots of mailing list to clear doubts and to
rectify problem.
Afterall we get atmost all the above at no cost.

Then why people are not aware of open source/free software? why they
are going for proprietary, people are using pirated softwares and os
but why they aren't trying opensource.
Even my college mates know about atleast what the term open source
means,and they know about ubuntu as some labs are having ubuntu
(installed ubuntu by lab admin due to inspection,as they were using
pirated os before) but they are using the unsecure,pirated softwares
only. I dont find anything missing in my system that is available in
proprietary software.
What's the problem... why popularity is not there.. why they are
hesitating to come into free world

Once scan is done, press 'l' to list the IP addresses.

Great thought! :-)
This has been a great challenge for a long period. The most acceptable
answer is *inertia*. That is, most people don't want to move to new things
until they have no other go. Once accustomed to something its difficult to
switch over to something else, unless one has a strong will to do so.
So we can just keep trying to attract more people towards Free Software.
Though creating awareness about the moral principles is important,
showcasing the power and some attractive things (Compiz, in most cases ;-))
can have better results, IMHO.

Thats a good start of thinking about opensource.
Its all in educating others about it.
If we start educating people, not just by saying about it, also by implementing 
in their computers will change the scene that we have.

Ha.. No need for such a "no more" situation.. If Microsoft finds a way to
ban all pirated copies of Windows, thats enough. Except a few corporate
offices and Windows fans, none will be ready to purchase the original
version! Does MS have the guts to do that??

I think many europeans and americans buy their copy of windows.
So I want to assume you are talking india (or perhaps south east asia?)

Is that the only reason people use windows? MS did a great job of
convincing people (and very early on) that windows has the most
friendly interface. Most people get started with windows and are not
sure if they need to learn another system. "Office has it, so I ll use
it here also" kind of an attitude.

Unless you catch the kids very early on (around the time they get used
to programming, even a wee bit) and introduce them and train them
linux, they'd never have enough reasons to make the switch.

That said, if MS decides to crack down, I won't be surprised if people
start picking vendor PCs (like dell/lenovo/hp) that come with windows
bundled as part of the desktop/laptop!

Yes I do agree. But, whatever the reason for which they started using
Windows, now the concern is to make them switch to GNU/Linux. Not much
people worry about using pirated copies. But if purchasing is the only
option to use Windows, then there is a better chance to see more people
using GNU/Linux.

Yes, that is a much better way. If we can convince our government to make
GNU/Linux as the only OS to be taught in schools, the task would be much
easier. But this involves lot more complexities like educating the teachers
on GNU/Linux. So we can keep doing what is possible at our community level.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikGayC_kU1T=satoCnh7B4zBq0J5YzvJJnMHnhV@mail.gmail.com>

Dear FOSS Enthusiasts and Activists.
        I am writing this letter to all for a request to create a task force
to advocate FOSS in schools. If we fail to advocate Linux in schools then we
will be failed everywhere.
        Most of the computer users like me are using computer from Last 5-6
year or less. They learned everything in college only. Also at our time
computer was a costly device. We have not faced much difficult in migrating
from Windows to Linux. Now we love Linux based distro and advocate for open
curriculum, content , no-patents, no-DRM etc.
       But today scenario has changed. Computer are available in every *
Mohalla* and Village. many of them are not having Internet connectivity.
they are just using some pirated software. This is not a small population.
This is a very huge population. This huge population of school students is
also including student who do not have money to buy computer but they are
learning using cybercafe and coaching classes.
       If you do not tell them to use FOSS and Linux based Distro, they will
continue using pirated window software for next 10-15 year of their life
until they got lucky to enter into a college where Local LUG is active and
he got change to explore GSoC and other activities OR course curriculum
include FOSS.
       *After 7 year, if you wish to give a lecture for advocating
FOSS/Linux in a college then Do you think you can convince them to use
FOSS/Linux and stop using the proprietary products which he is using from
last 10 years?
*      During a workshop of Kids at NCERT, a 5th class kids refused to work
on Kturtle because he was using LOGO software from last 1 year. Those who do
not know LOGO created very beautiful diagrams with Kturtle.
      You can only reach engineering students at College level Linux/FOSS
promotion and activities. But these student who are going to use proprietary
product for they whole school life will go in various domain like art,
music, law etc. you can never convince them after their mind-wash.
      I learned to do advocacy from two side attack. System is like pyramid.
Bottom side contains huge student. and tip is controlled by those who run
Education system. at top level we need to look for syllabus change and other
activities. At bottom side we need to advocate FOSS and Linux principle in
schools. Imagine the power of community and collaboration value inside this
huge community. This student community need out love, care and guidance. We
can together create a task force and think for various strategies to
introduce FOSS in schools. If you empower this student community then they
can crate whole curriculum and e-learning videos of their syllabus by
themselves.

   Agree with you on this -
   This has a bigger benefit thats not apparent immediately - It will give
   the children the ability to handle issues/problems face-to-face because
   thts the "*nu(i)x" ian culture to get things to work by your own effort.
   this is an important life skill, and by the time the kids come to college
   in current system, it is deeply ingrained in their minds that there is
   always "someone" who will solve their problems for them - they are
   culturally trained to sit around with the problem long enough.

Well, there are different kinds of users,

Desktop users typically choose Windows because
 - it just works with their hardware
 - it comes bundled with the system they bought.
 - they play computer games
 - their favourite software is not in Linux.

Hardware problem is mostly solved in the Linux world, but we need to
spread the awareness.

Corporate Users typically choose Windows because
 - Accountability, Dependability: IBM, Microsoft, Oracle will sell
products with *warranty*, *service*, *support* - which doesn't come
for free even in FOSS world. So, given a choice, they always choose
the one with a bigger brand value.

Big Corporates will always focus on their core business, they can't
setup the IT infrastructure on their own with free software. So they
approach IT vendors - Any kind of company who want to 'computerize'
the business will manage documents - the best software there is to
manage documents is Microsoft Office - the only environment in which
Microsoft Office will run is Microsoft Windows - If anyways you spend
money in installing Microsoft Windows, why waste more money in
installing other free OS with premium support?

Red Hat, Novell and numerous FOSS based consultancy shops are
addressing the above problem.

Anyways, I won't be happy in a world where there is no Windows or Mac
OSX. Competition is healthy.

What's is your sound card model?
I have a similar problem where sound works but with a high noise. No
solutions posted in forums and ML's work for me too. My card type is,

Service and support, yes; but warranty is not given by anyone. Read the EULA
carefully. So no accountability!

I'm not sure software warranty is 'not given by anyone'. Warranty is
more related to hardware than software, if that's what you meant. But
I just happened to read Microsoft Windows XP Home EULA[0] and they do
give a 'limited' warranty for 90 days.

[0] - http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/eula/home.mspx - point no. 15

+1

In my recent adventures with Drupal and Wordpress, I find that there
are several small companies which create great themes for Drupal,
WordPress and make a lot of money out of it.

Eg. WooThemes.com is one of the premier providers for WordPress
themes.  They have some free themes, but also several paid premium
themes -- the premium themes seem to have generated ~ $20-30k per
theme, and they have several dozen themes.

This is an excellent opportunity and business model for someone with the
right design skills.  All you need is to have the right artistic/design talent,
put in the efforts in acquiring Drupal/WP/other theming knowledge and
simple commodity computer infrastructure.

When you initiate a connection from your system, the kernel is free
to choose any suitable source IP based on the kernel routing table.
And by default, the primary IP of the interface is selected as src IP.

If you want your application to use a specific IP (eth0:1), then your
daemon/app needs to bind to that specific IP *before* initiating a
connection.  Most applications use 0.0.0.0 as the src IP by default
and let the kernel choose the appropriate src IP.

Eg. If eth0 is 192.168.0.10, eth0:1 is 192.168.0.11

"ping 192.168.0.1" will send ICMP packets with src IP 192.168.0.10

"ping -I 192.168.0.11 192.168.0.1" will send ICMP packets with src
IP 192.168.0.11


Note that having multiple IPs defined in the same subnet can cause
other unexpected problems unless it is handled specifically.  If you
have two physical interfaces with IPs assigned in the same subnet,
ARP requests/responses can get mixed up and cause issues.  IIRC
recent kernel versions have addressed these issues.

No accountability or warranty is needed. The word is support and
service-level-agreements. Your critical project could not go live on
the given date due to a internal network/software issue, say. Its
impossible for a company to defend themselves from the client saying
they are on their own and will handle it within a few hours. Otoh,
they just might be able to bail out saying this installation cupped
and people from  IBM/MS/HP or whoever else is working on it. The
client might buy it. RHEL/Novell(are they still around)/Canonical
might be able to address this. Corporates would prefer to stay away
from having to worry about infrastructure. Unless LUGs and Linux
vendors can handle this with the same SLAs the other end of the
spectrum is offering (albeit at similar price), they cannot break this
barrier.

Oh, you don't have to praise Microsoft so much! You're implying as if
Microsoft knows how to stop piracy and willingly doesn't want to do it
:-D

On a serious note, last time I inquired about pirated copies of
Windows Vista (it was a year back) in Ritchie street and Burma bazaar
- No one had it. They said police were very particular about cracking
down pirated copies of Windows and there was pressure from 'central'
govt on this. Not sure whats the state of Windows piracy now.

I am not joking - it is microsoft policy to encourage piracy. That is
well known. That is why they only raid now and then - they want people
to use pirated versions, get addicted and then catch them and make them
pay. Bill Gates once said: 'millions of chinese are now using windows -
now we have to get them to pay for it'.

The preferred quoting/posting style on this list is interleaved
posting.  It means that your reply is woven with the previous
post wherever appropriate, and not just bunching your entire
reply in the top or bottom.  It's also recommended that you
trim unwanted lines from your quote and use correct attribution.

Please read the Posting Style Wikipedia article fully, especially
the Interleaved Style, Attribution lines, and Trimming section.

Subject: [Ilugc] 10.10 installation issue
Message-ID: <AANLkTinmf9L-1fP=K_-6LK3nD=-xasQPnR_bw-T8LPRq@mail.gmail.com>

I tried installing ubuntu 10.10 in my HP dv6 pavillion laptop using a usb
drive.
It is right now, running in the live cd mode, after I hit 'iinstall ubuntu',
i got a screen asking me to check if I'd want to 'download updates while
installing' and 'install 3rd party software'.
I checked yes for both, and the installation has been running for more than
15 minutes. There is no visible progress bar to show download
progress/installation progress.
I have  a 15mbps connection, and yet no response from the installer yet.

Does it really take that long? or is this just the way it is?

the guideline is wrong on that point - I have repeatedly pointed this
out to the people who wrote that and who send it every month. The
correct method of posting is 'interleaved posting' and not bottom
posting. @shakthi+Srini - this has been there for several years and it
is misleading. Kindly remove the words 'bottom post'.

I guess by default the Ubuntu would choose (the nearby) Indian server for
the latest
updates. Thats the reason getting the updates and other softwares takes
time. One
better option you could have selected is to install the updates after
installing the OS
in your laptop since you have a high speed connection.

Or am i wrong in naming it ?

I am not a moderator for this group. I had updated my presentation [1]

Hi Sibi,

I find difficult in reading your reply, Kindly consider to the interleaved
posting mechanism and  trimming unwanted lines out.
I think, interleaved posting makes life comfort for the readers.

Hello?Thyagarajan Shanmugham ,
That was an entirely new post. Just 2 lines were from the previous mail .?
I am fully supportive in case of interleaved posting .?
But when ?some one new does a top or bottom posting why we need to be so harsh to him ?
That was my point over there .
Not being harsh isn't a strict rule written any where but a basic human nature .

I have suffered from this sort of paralysis for several years before I
got off the ground and did something.

But it is not easy, mind you.

You need to constantly be doing something and learning from books,
Internet and so on.

There is no easy answer.

You have to let this thought brood in your brain just like the romance
sentiments young people have towards girls and
vice versa.

All the time you are thinking of it and one day you will get to know what to do.

Nobody needs to tell you. You feel the answer in your gut.

Just like lovers meet and stay in touch, you need to constantly learn
and upgrade your skills and look at the source of popular
open source  projects.

Also gain familiarity with a very good OS.

Linux is fine to begin with but if you really want to do great things
you need to graduate out of linux in a year or two.

Hi ,
     Thats really good you came out to ask some help for doing opensource
projects. Its a very good way to keep in touch with the technologies and
your coding skills.

 The sourceforge.net  is  a good idea. I started my opensource with Mozilla
lab's "Bespin" now its called as "Skywriter".
There are many such huge projects where you get chance to code. "Android"
from google, "subversion", "GIT" which is now becoming popular. You can just
go and join the developer community and start contributing.

But apart from these you need a really a great passion and love to code in
order to do OpenSource or any form of coding.

Hope this helps. Happy coding  :-)

Thanks,
Pradeep.

Hi Pradeep, Girish

  If you were to suggest **ONE** open-source project for any new comer to
start with - a project that makes it easy to learn, at the same time,
generates lot of interest in a *newbie* developer to dive deeper & deeper,
what would it be??


Thanks

Sorry to hijack the question :D

That question is more or less unanswerable. It depends a lot on how
much a person is familiar with a language, how far the project has
evolved, how many different things the project is trying to do and so
on.

I ll anyway leave it for Girish/Pradeep to answer that!

Hi Hameed - I am not very much experienced to suggest any project since i
myself is a *newbie*. Upto my understanding all the open source projects are
documented well and have good community to help . So you can just pick one
and start contributing.


Thanks,
Pradeep.

IMO, Linux is NOT fine to begin with. The code is way too big for a
beginner to handle. And its something I would NEVER recommend for a
newbie. Plus, it is extremely easy to get lost, frightened and
disappear.

The best place to start when it comes to OS would be small kernels.

E.g. RTEMS, TinyOS, FreeRTOS, ?ngstr?m, ucLinux and the likes.

You would have already guessed most of these relate to embedded
systems which enforce a lot of resource constraints. So they have to
be small and stripped off unnecessary crap. Once you learn one of
these, you can graduate to Linux much more easily and then move ahead.

My two cents.

Besides the other suggestions you have received, I personally feel a more 
practical and easier path to contribution is to become a bug-zapper ! ie: Pick 
any random application you use everyday (or you can just aim high and pick the 
linux kernel itself) and then visit the project's bug tracker. Almost all open 
source software has bugs or feature requests that are being ignored only because 
the developers either do not have enough tuits [1] or the bugs aren't critical 
enough. Pick one or more of those and fix them.

Note that this approach is most useful if you do /not/ already have a project 
idea of your own that you would like to work on or are not already motivated 
enough to contribute to one specific application that you use and care about. If 
you do, just go ahead and do that (ie: scratch your own itch).

The reason I recommend the bug fixing approach is because:
a. You can make a very practical and useful contribution to a meaningful 
project. (as opposed to a random small project off sourceforge.net that you 
choose to contribute as a developer; where although you might learn and improve 
your coding skills at a faster rate (/if/ you are committed enough), you might 
not get the satisfaction of contributing to a 'real' project).

b. The time and effort involved between wanting to start contributing and 
actually contributing is much smaller.

c. You get to work with a much larger and more active set of people than when 
for instance working on yet another mp3 player/text 
editor/game/calander/terminal ...etc. This means that you are more likely to 
receive better help, suggestions and feedback.

d. The project developers would appreciate your help immensely.

Dear Hameed and other wanna-be opensource enthusiasts,

Like it has already been pointed out, no one can really suggest an
open source project for new comer. The idea should come from you, the
idea should be a virus, infecting your brain. Like Girish rightly
said, its like falling in love, being possessed with it. You shouldn't
go after a project to 'try' or 'learn' or 'dive deeper' etc.

Remember: In the olden days, people worked in opensource to fix a
problem for them - now people mostly want to work in opensource for
satisfying and boosting their geek cred. It works for both of the
parties, but now the since the demand is more, the barrier for entry
is a bit high.

Its not all glory right from the start.

You need to have knowledge in:
* source control systems. - checkout, commit, fork, branch, patch,
merge, update, status, log (If these words doesn't mean anything to
you, learn them - git, svn, cvs, hg)
* coding standards - each project has its own set of rules and guidelines.
* bug tracking systems and how to sign up for testing, triaging,
fixing, reporting them.
* you need to be good at at least 2 programming languages (apart from
html, css, javascript, xml) and be well versed with programming
paradigms and patterns.
* understand build process. understand what is unit testing, how to write tests.
* You need to be good with typing, ide shortcuts - its an important skill.
* Debugging is also an essential skill - ide to the rescue.
* read code - literally read code. understand what each line does, go
with the flow, use debug points and figure out when and which and what
gets triggered, evaluated and executed.

You won't get commit rights right from the start, you need to build
your reputation, that is only through finding bugs, triaging bugs,
reporting bugs and fixing bugs. Communication skills is really
important. You'd need to mail, irc, chat with fellow developers and
committers. English is the medium of communication - better be good at
it.

Checkout some opensource projects, read the code, find and understand
their bug tracking and request acceptance processes. See their bug
tracking system, mailing lists and start up!

If it feels daunting, don't worry. You'd get it eventually. But, most
importantly - start!

+1

I'd go a step ahead and suggest the 'scratch your itch' approach
instead of just lurking on bug trackers, thus not limiting you to any
single app. There will surely be something about some application that
bothers you -- the odd crash, some behaviour quirk that is just wrong,
or some feature you would like to have in it. Download the source for
that app, read the code and fix your own problem. Then you contribute
your fix upstream. Of course, expect your patch to be rejected at
least the first few hundred times. If it is rejected, understand why;
that way you learn much more about the app.

Somewhere down the line (a couple of years maybe, or more) you will
find yourself fixing more bugs of some specific application than
others, either because you understand the codebase better or find it
interesting/challenging.

I need a quick fix as I have to travel with my laptop very soon on audit  to my auditors at Hyderabad.

I just repeated what I did on another desktop at a friends place where the installation went on smoothly. Just wanted to introduce FOSS to him.

Well I did google, as did a live boot it worked. I did finally solve the
issue, I did a reinstall with manual partition and there I found it
marked the partition as do not use this partition hence grub was unable
to find root when I changed it and reinstallted again it worked fine, 
This reply is from the freshly installed ubuntu.

Thanks for the suggestion.

Hi Jithin,

I saw the access log and error log. I don't find anything unusual. I
expected to see lots 5xx codes. But that didn't happen or the log
isn't complete. The issue you are saying is a typical scenario where
in the httpd dies and start itself up. Which will not be noticeable in
ping request. Ping just makes sure ip connectivity exists or not. It
does nt check whether your application died or not. Ping is in no way
useful in our current scenario. Please look for symptoms of
application httpd crashing and starting itself up. If it Linux i would
look at /var/log/messages . If it is windows i would look at event
viewer. Please start looking at that angle. One more query , is
selinux thing to blame ??

Hi, I need some idea regarding scripting. I need to run a script, which will
search for the (latest-1) file from a folder. Here, (Latest-1) means: this
script will find the file which is not the last edited/saved file but the
immediate previous edited/saved file of that lastest one? Is it possible?

Thanks a lot! Now, Say, there are five files... 1 2 3 4 & 5. Now, I want to
rename and replace the new inserted sixth file as 1, seventh file as 2 ...
and so on. What should be my script command? By the way, there will be no
more than "five" modified files there!!

You're basically looking to replace the oldest file at all times,
kinda like log rotation, so you can simply follow the logic:

n=$(ls -1|wc -l)
lf n < 5 then
   create the n+1th file
else
   replace the file you get with ls -1t|tail -1
end if

Thank you again. But, if I call the variable as "n", the whole name of the
file becomes *n. *

**I have given my total script below which will get the file, immediate
previous one of latest one. Then, a command will be applied on that... and
after that, the new modified file will be saved in a new directory.
*
*
*cd /home/mohib/Desktop/Raw/*
*n=$(ls -1t|head -2|tail -1)*
*/opt/gpac/bin/gcc/MP4Box -hint -latm "n"*
*cp "n" /home/mohib/Desktop/Final/*
*
*
*n=$(ls -1|wc -l)*
*lf n < 5 then*
*  create the n+1th file*
*else*
*  replace the file you get with ls -1t|tail -1*
*end if*

Whats wrong I have made here?

Do a `man bash` or `info bash` and search for `Parameter Expansion`. Quick ref:

[steve@laptop ~]$ i="foo.txt"
[steve@laptop ~]$ echo $i ${i%%.txt} ${i/txt/mp3}
foo.txt foo foo.mp3

hth,

I gave you the logic for it and expected that you would try to
implement it yourself in shell script.

Hi Aswin,

 Thanks for your response. I knew that there is no connection between ping
request and apache2.2 . But i just found that if there any type of
connection ( Putty,FTP,ping etc) established between my webserver and local
pc . Then the website is loading fine.  Any way let me check the message
log.

 Thanks and Regards

I think grub is upgraded to 2.0 in ubuntu 9.x, which could be the
cause. Try installing grub again using the live CD.

Sure, swap the eth0 and eth0:1 IPs  :-)

If your daemon does not support explicit bind IP, then you can:

1. Use SELinux policies and restrict the IPs for your app,
2. Use containers like OpenVZ or VServers and limit the IPs
    your app can bind to.

If you want a specific reply, it will be good if you care to mention
the application and distro you are using along with what you are
trying to accomplish/solve.


And finally, please follow mailing list guidelines and stop top posting.

When you think of kicking one out, then freedom fails. Plus there are lots
of issues regarding attacks targeted. If action has to be taken for what you
mentioned, the same action should be taken at all times.

IMO, it doesn't work this way. From what I have heard and read from
people, the best contributors first started as users. If you use that
software, you will contribute regularly to it and also understand it's
working so be in a better position to work on it.
So, you should be looking at applications that you use regularly and
then look for what you find problematic/missing.

I fully agree - people who contribute for the sake of contributing or
for the sake of improving their resume do not contribute for long.
People who want to fix something they use - or improve it - or add a
feature are the ones who last. But one thing that I do is this: whatever
code I write - maybe just snippets, I upload to my online repo. Most of
it is only useful to me, but on occasion I am surprised to find a person
who has found it useful.

For desktops, it is simple - add n video cards for n+1 monitors.

For laptop: I found this on googling ->

I think, you need to add PIC video card or something which has VGA-out.

This should work too:

They call it, 'Multi monitor adapter'

thanks for googling it for me (I do not use google so could not do it

duckduckgo shows another way of doing it - through a usb port.

actually I posted this question the hope that some one would say: hey I
picked up this chinese thingie from richie street for 250 bucks and it
works fine with linux. I got laughed at in IRC - people just could not
believe that I have spent years of my life with only *one* monitor.

I dont know how the productivity is increased after adding
another monitor.. Can you tell me? For multiple application running at
same time means, we can use virtual desktops which will be in ubuntu
by default.. Why we need another monitor?

you want a nice Terminal??

Just open your terminal and type 'byobu'

Now, you can see the changes at the bottom of the terminal.

See the man page for more exiting information. ;-)

EX:
arul@arul-desktop:~$ byobu

Now, you can see the following information

cpu_count, cpu_freq, hostname, ip_address ,load_average,uptime etc.,

hint:

Press 5 times the F2 button and press F3 & F4.

 /tmp/tmpZqeWqe file descriptor.
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=sSwTwhi9tepH+yms321JC4GJyCY_NxV5ALUkY@mail.gmail.com>

hi to all

am using fedora 13 whenever i startup my system the system is very slow
suddenly there will some errors coming
and suddenly the entire window will get stucking not even mouse movement and
i think collison error on my system

please any one rectify and solve this error ?

SELinux is preventing /sbin/setfiles access to a leaked /tmp/tmpZqeWqe file
descriptor.

Detailed Description:

[restorecon has a permissive type (setfiles_t). This access was not denied.]

SELinux denied access requested by the restorecon command. It looks like
this is
either a leaked descriptor or restorecon output was redirected to a file it
is
not allowed to access. Leaks usually can be ignored since SELinux is just
closing the leak and reporting the error. The application does not use the
descriptor, so it will run properly. If this is a redirection, you will not
get
output in the /tmp/tmpZqeWqe. You should generate a bugzilla on
selinux-policy,
and it will get routed to the appropriate package. You can safely ignore
this
avc.

To be more specific, the latest version of GRUB is 1.97 but this can't be
the reason here because the GRUB has been updated only from Karmic
Koala(9.10). And 9.04 uses the older GRUB.

SELinux provides extra capabilities and security enhancements for Linux
systems.  Most desktops and even servers do not need the extra overhead
and maintenance of SELinux.  Applications will not work correctly unless
the SELinux policy is set correctly for every application.

SELinux docs, and instructions on disabling it are here:

http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Security-Enhanced_Linux/sect-Security-Enhanced_Linux-Enabling_and_Disabling_SELinux-Disabling_SELinux.html

Suggest you try disabling SELinux and check if you are still having issues.

Ha ha. Our company specializes in most of these areas.

I thought RAS was Remote Access Service. Anyway qemu is what we use
for virtualization. Same as KVM. Xen is not good.

It is actually emulation but good enough for us. Not para
virtualization. But it gets the job done. Very well.

For high availability in linux there is something called HA-Proxy. But
we don't use it. We use relayd(8) on OpenBSD.

What to talk of file systems? ;)

If you want a good file system you should use open source UNIX like
the BSDs. Don't even think of Linux.

There was big talk of Solaris and their ZFS but then I think you what happened.

Commercial interests killed it.

In general we stay away from anything commercial.

The way the world is going money is in packaging and appliances. Not
so much in the intrinsic value of software itself.

Stuff like VMWare are on its way out I think...

But despite all this Microsoft Windows and its associated partners
like Microsoft Exchange, Outlook, Office and so on will
always be in demand. I cannot think of a time when demand for these
things will reduce.

Linux and UNIX are good for server side. And Windows is good for
desktop use. Though some people prefer Linux for desktop
 Windows surely has its undeniable place.

I don't follow this thread about multiple monitors. I have also been

for example I am learning (for the 10th time) blender. Now I have the
tutorial on one monitor and blender on the other. So I do not need to
keep switching (both tutorial and blender need the full screen). And
then if cricket starts, I need a monitor to watch that also.

as far as I can see 3 is the minimum. Anyone who uses less than 3, will
be most unproductive.

I don't think this can be done; I believe it would disable your basic
login process and CLI.   Would like to hear opinions from shell gurus.

I use rbash to restrict users to their home dir only but it does not
block shell script execution in user's dir.

Subject: [Ilugc] xfs_repair - need help / pointers to recover files from
	hard disk
Message-ID: <AANLkTim61byfX85krYH48TUo=kzr82B0wA2u-ARSK_oM@mail.gmail.com>

I have an external WD 1TB hard disk with a XFS file system.  It used
to be mounted to my desktop via an e-sata port on the mobo.

It started giving me block read errors while auto mounting and I was
under the impression the HDD was on way to RIP.

It turns out it was the mother board which was on the way to RIP
because the DVI port stopped working 2 days ago.

Anyway,  I have hooked up the 1TB device to my temporary desktop via
USB and the kernel is not reporting any error.

However, there are file system errors and it refuses to mount.

Using SystemRescueCD I have tried to repair the FS with the following:

                            xfs_repair -v -L /dev/sdf1

I see no output on the console (even after letting it run for a couple
of hours) and I am unable to break out of the session (Cntrl-C).

I have also done ddrescue to extract about 150GB of the FS and try to
repair the extracted file - no success.

Would appreciate any pointers / tips to recover the file system.

TIA

That is correct ...due to the inherent nature of interpreters ...

XFS fsck requires a LOT of RAM to check large file systems.  Please
ensure you have at least 2GB of RAM on your system and are running
a 64bit kernel and userland.  It's also good to have adequate swap
mounted -- you don't want xfs_check to run out of RAM midway.

I always "xfs_check" first to identify errors.  Then try a dry run with
"xfs_repair -n" before turning xfs_repair loose.

USB is very slow, so a lot of patience is required :-)  Or hook up the
HDD to your internal SATA controller and rerun fsck.

xfs_repair is probably stuck on kernel IO so Control-C is not stopping
it.  If you don't see any disk activity, it should be safe to reboot the box
and try the above.

Do you have a full image of the XFS partition?  What is the size of your
XFS partition.

If you have LVM setup, suggest that you create a snapshot before running
xfs_* so you can revert in case things do not go as planned.


Not to discourage you but my experience in recovering XFS has mostly met
with limited success.  xfs_repair renames the files with their inode numbers
and generally creates a mess.  I've often had to reinstall IRIX after
a file system
corruption.

XFS requires stable hardware and power to function well.  Further more,
for single disk setups, the performance advantages of XFS over other file
systems is not all that significant.  So for removable disks, it's highly
recommended that you consider ext3/ext4 in future.

   I am not sure what you mean. But we can mount fs from Linux to

you want a nice Terminal??

Just open your terminal and type 'byobu'

Now, you can see the changes at the bottom of the terminal.

See the man page for more exiting information. ;-)

EX:
arul@arul-desktop:~$ byobu

Now, you can see the following information

cpu_count, cpu_freq, hostname, ip_address ,load_average,uptime etc.,

hint:

Press 5 times the F2 button and press F3 & F4.

Unless you are particular about v6.1, the above link has a trial
download. Also, the mail looks to have very poor formatting. A little
more care to what/how you write might help! But that has nothing to do
with the list or the question :)

Yes, I am using 64bit kernel with 8GB RAM.  I am using SystemRescueCD.
  Memory was not the issue; top showed only 670MB in use.

It turns out I was overly optimistic about the condition of the hard
disk.  Although, it showed no disk read errors last night, they showed
up today when I was attempting yet another "xfs_repair" with the -P
option.  This time around I did get some output on the console with it
aborting on disk I/O error.  Time to RMA the disk to WDC.  In this
case,  the files were mostly ISO of various distros so not much loss.

I do not have any spare sata ports on the server and esata port either.

The partition size is the full disk - around 976GB.  I do not have an
equivalent spare so I tried about 150GB and tried mounting the image
file - did not work.  Clutching at straws before letting it go :(

With this experience, I agree with your suggestion re. file system
choice.   I too have had very limited success with XFS repair on
another occasion and ended up reformatting the volume.

Take a look at open atrium, it is a collaboration tool built on the top of
drupal 6. It has calender, events, blogs, documents, shout (like tweet) and

Message-ID: <AANLkTim0XB+MM3m1H5WL6gjZNXz+k3q_nbYgU=iY3=r5@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

As I know, all the services in the linux are in /etc/init.d

To start any service, we can do
/etc/init.d/<servie name> start

But, in recent days, it seems like ubuntu is changing this.

see the results here.


starting apache:

shrinivasan@shrinivasan-laptop:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start
[sudo] password for shrinivasan:
 * Starting web server apache2
  httpd (pid 3529) already running


starting mysql :

shrinivasan@shrinivasan-laptop:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
Rather than invoking init scripts through /etc/init.d, use the service(8)
utility, e.g. service mysql start

Since the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an
Upstart job, you may also use the start(8) utility, e.g. start mysql
shrinivasan@shrinivasan-laptop:~$ sudo start mysql
start: Job is already running: mysql


Why is there a different in starting apahe and mysql in the same machine?

Ubuntu guys are giving that for backward compatibility and for some of the
services, if you start with /etc/init.d/<service name> start, you will get a
warning, start it with service. I don't remember the service name, right
now.

Will this also be used to document some of procedures / configurations /
solution to issues, that are not commonly documented by the flavor provider
(like feora/debian etc)..


For e.g.
1. how to configure wi-fi on fedora?
2. Laptop does not recover when lid is opened

or does this kind of stuff goto FAQ?

I just tried deploying teambox on my shared hosting provider
dreamhost.com.  After crossing the pain of hand installing several
dependency gems, I finally got it working.  Only to find that the
community edition of teambox is *severely* crippled to the point
that it's absolutely no use to anyone wanting to manage a 5-10
member team with moderate tasks/project complexity.

My 2 paisa.

Both methods will work. The older method is provided for compatibility. Its
not just Ubuntu; now almost all systems are using Upstart instead of
sysvinit.

But Fedora is expected to replace Upstart with systemd in Fedora 15. See
this [1] for a good explanation of what a good init daemon should do.[very
long! And Ubuntu lovers like me should take things with a pinch of salt.

IMO, not in FAQ. In that case our FAQ will become big :-). You can have
separate page for this kind of stuff. If you are free and willing to create
these kind of content please go ahead.

An update.

I was extremely lucky - the hard disk started co-operating [1] and I
was able to repair the XFS FS with xfs_check and xfs_repair.

The FS mounted w/o errors but started giving read errors after about
95% completion of rsync.
Thereafter, through multiple iterations of  xfs_check and xfs_repair
sessions I have been able to recover close to 99% of my files.

The HDD is definitely going back to WDC for replacement.

[1] this happened after I had already generated a RMA for it :)

Have you checked if there's no hardware problem with the modem or a

A wonderful initiative Srikanth. Appreciate the work well done!

What's the point of SOURCE being OPEN or CLOSED -
if it only helps few individuals to build Hefty Bank Balances for
themselves and
CANNOT solve the problems of the COMMON MAN or at least benefit
him/her in some little way?

Are there any other projects that were started with the ONLY MOTIVE to
HELP our fellow Indians?
(a new thread on this subject would be very helpful!)

1. Disaster management is a common mans problem and has been solved by
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Haiti/Earthquake_map_resources
2 . Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya, widely known as Africa's largest slum
has been mapped by mapkibera project http://www.mapkibera.org/

And many more such projects are being pursued and can be pursued by us
in our local areas. I believe some work has been done on Mumbai slums
. We could do something in chennai for the river Adyar , cooum and its
sorrounding areas which are in poverty.

IIRC wajig is for Debian and it's derivative distros.

Dear all,

Today, myself setup a 52 seat FOSS lab for Hindustan College of Engineering
& Technology, Malumichampatty, Coimbatore, for the department of CSE using
Fedora-13.

The HOD/CSE, dept. staffs, Sys. admin / lab technicians showed more interest
in learning GNU/Linux and Open Source Software tools.  After having a hour
long discussion with Dr.J. Suganthi, it was decided that all the first year
students get started doing their practicals on the GNU/Linux platform.

For any feedback, pl. contact Dr. J. Suganthi (Vice Principal, HOD/CSE,)
regarding the FOSS Lab implementation.

Foremost thing is to get proper information and requirements and
choose the right mix on that basis.

See The MAN page for the last command

$ man !!

$ man !!:0

This works in bash. The "!!:0" limits the argument to man to be only
the first word of the last command. "!!:1" would be the second, etc.


EX:

arul@arul-desktop:~$ ls | wc
     17      17     153
arul@arul-desktop:~$ man !!:0
man ls

arul@arul-desktop:~$ ls | wc
17      17     153
arul@arul-desktop:~$ man !!:1
man |

arul@arul-desktop:~$ ls | wc

Hi,
      tcpwrapers for ssh are not working on CentOs5.4 hsphere installed . I
have checked with other systems it was working fine without any problems.Can
any one have a idea about it.


/etc/hosts.allow file like this
sshd: <ip1> <ip2> <ip3>

/etc/hosts.deny file like this
ALL:ALL

but it was allowing all the ips to establish ssh connection.I know through
AllowUsers parameters in sshd_config we can do a same , but i want to do in
tcpwrapers.

           Its quite sometime since I used wireless on debian. But
when I guess, installing ndiswrapper might help you at least get
wireless network addresses. Just give it a try. But I am not sure if
it is a free software. Thanks

If you are not successfully associated with AP then the indicator might
not blink.

Did you try?

$ sudo iwlist sc

It will list all the available access points.

 FOSS Lab setup in Sree Sakthi Engineering College, Karamadai,

Message-ID: <AANLkTin2RN3bjOm6g-EY9Erfmg1hYmyVDuw-izMGAV_r@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Today myself setup a 45 seat FOSS lab for Sree Sakthi Engineering College,
Karamadai, Coimbatore District (started in 2010 -
http://www.sreesakthi.edu.in) in the main computer centre using Fedora-13.

After the discussion with Principal Dr. V. Vel Murugan, it was decided that,
students starting from the first year onwards, start using GNU/Linux and
FOSS tools all for their computing needs.

Also, I would like to thank Mr. Balamurugan of Mettupalayam who has been
very supportive in this FOSS lab setup initiative.

For any feedback, pl. contact Principal Dr. V. Velmurugan regarding the FOSS
Lab implementation.

This tip is not limited to man. Actually !! stands for last command. So you can use things like
!!      - to just repeat last command 
info !! - to get info pages of last command
echo !! - simply echo last command name
time !! - rerun the command and get time usage

I normally use fixed broadband with my laptop - but when power goes or
fixed broadband is on the blink, or not available, then out comes the
data card.

Hi all,
I'm looking for some suggestions/experiences on forward proxies...
My requirements are :
1) It should be able to pool connections
2) Ability to handle high loads of concurrent requests

I'm NOT looking for any caching capabilities on the forward proxies

I have the following options now:
a) Apache's -  mod_proxy (
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html)
b) Apache - Traffic Server (http://trafficserver.apache.org/)
c) Squid - http://www.squid-cache.org/

I would love to know the pros/cons for the above or any other proxies that I
have missed that might meet my requirements

Feasibility for fixed line poor at my place. Do you have a preference for
the mobile ISP? Which mobile broadband works better with Linux? Mine's
Ubuntu. And I currently use MTS. I travel a lot within TN and MTS doesn't
work as well everywhere as it does at Chennai..

I have tataindicom and bsnl 3g - both work perfectly with fedora and
mandriva and opensuse. Only thing is that when there is no 3G (like in
Erode where bsnl only has 2G), I have not been able to get the 3G
datacard to shift to the hybrid mode to fall back on 2G.

2G/3G switch works smoothly for me on Ubuntu mobile broadband, it take a bit
more time to connect in 2G areas though. Have to plug / unplug few times
before it connects. I am using Huawei USB datacard.

That was helpful. I expect bsnl to roll out 3g sooner or later. So I think
it would be good to go for bsnl 3g. How do u connect to the net? Wvdial ?

Good. You need the last three packages for ns2

Very fair, since ns2 was not part of Debian Lenny. You can either try
out the squeeze debs, or manually backport (rebuild) the packages for
Lenny.

KG: Could you please let me know the output of:

apt-cache policy ns2

I suspect you might have some other repository; it would be useful to
know which one seems to have ns2.

Thanks.

The following solution worked successfully in Ubuntu 9.10. I felt that you could get some idea to install/search for similar solutions for Debian.
step1:?remove all ns-allinone-2.3x directory (if you put it anywhere to install ns2) and revert back all the path changes you made in ~/.bashrc related to ns2.
step2:??Now export the Wouter Horr?'s ppa repository key by typing the following command on terminal and enter:
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys B3F3334F
step3:?Now add the following ppa repository to source list?
?? ?deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/wouterh/ppa/ubuntu karmic main
?? ?deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/wouterh/ppa/ubuntu karmic main
step4:?Reload repository information when prompted by "The information about available software is out-of-date" notification or reload it manually by following command on terminal:
?? ?sudo apt-get update
step5:?Now type the following command on terminal to install ns from the launchpad ppa repository:
?? ?sudo apt-get install ns nam xgraph
That's all. There is no need to set-up any path, environment variables or make any changes in ~/.bashrc .

Subject: [Ilugc] Help - GPG safe practices
Message-ID: <AANLkTimo4_rgD_A3NvvEEQBgkXHKPUZeV1ykiUbKEGnW@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I use thunderbird. Installed enigmail plugin to be able to use GPG
alongside. Now the thing is my .gpg directory is owned by root and
thunderbird runs as user. So I really can't add my keys to enigmail. I know
I can change ownership of .gpg to user and use enigmail. But I'm not sure if
that's safe.

I searched online for gpg safe practices. I didn't get any result that said
anything about the consequences of not having root ownership for .gpg
directory. So I want to know.

Running thunderbird as root is not really an option unless there's a way to
import all my mail addressbook, calendar etc to the root user instance
easily.

Help me please.

So, as I suspected, you have got the ns2 from from unstable. It is not
part of Lenny, so you can't apt-get it unless you have unstable in
sources.list[.d].

Thanks.

Do you mean the ~/.gnupg directory? Why is it owned by root. It should
be owned by the user in whose home directory it is stored in.

hi jayakumar ,
                    You have to start mysql service first
login as a root user then run this
#service mysqld start
or
#/etc/init.d/mysqld start
then
#chkconfig mysqld on
then you can use mysql command.

and you cannot maintain a server in lenny without unstable and
backports. (you *can* maintain one, but you will have a lot of
dissatisfied customers)

Any document on configuring nginx as forward proxy? I couldn't find

I am assuming that a forward proxy means something that receives
requests and sends them on to another webserver or whatever to handle
them. For example on one server I look after, I have nginx listening on
port 80, with a set virtual hosts each of which forwards requests to
either a django runserver, a tornado server running django, or apache
running osm tiles server and a php site. My laptop config is pasted here
(fedora):

http://dpaste.com/261750/

btw, facebook runs nginx proxied to a batch of tornado webservers.

of course if this is not what a forward proxy does, please ignore me.

That's a reverse proxy. A forward proxy is installed on client
network to proxy client requests.

Squid-cache and wwwoffle are most widely used for this purpose.

In recent versions of Firefox, hitting backspace key has no effect.
You can use Alt+Left_Arrow to go to previous page and Alt+Right_Arrow to go
forward. Does this work in 3.0 too?

This works for MySQL that has been installed separately. As the OP has used
XAMPP it is not installed as a service. So /etc/init.d/ has no related
files. Instead the scripts are located at /opt/lampp

@jayakumar: Check if any other MySQL server (installed separately) is
running on the machine. Try this:
      $sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop

Then start your XAMPP's MySQL using /opt/lampp/lampp startmysql.

Try this out and please update the result here.

Dear luggies

I am planning to have a search engine similar to google for my intranet (actually it spans entire India, with about 2000 intranet sites). I expect about 500-600gb data and about 1 million pages. I found
htdig(htdig.org) and mnogosearch(mnogosearch.org) to be suitable. 

However, they seem to be old and development is nearly standstill.

If anyone has better alternative please share your experience.

Move the keys to your ~/.gnupg directory and your keys will be available
to the user. If your ~/.gnupg directory belongs to root, chown it to
yourself and then chmod the directory to 700, and atleast your
secring.gpg, random_seed, and trustdb.gpg to 600.

I'm using Firefox 3.6.3 and I don't see this problem. This might be a
problem in earlier versions which has been fixed later. Why don't you
consider upgrading your FF?

This is not a version issue. Firefox shortcut for previous page is Backspace
in windows and Ctrl+[ in GNU/Linux. Alt + Left_Arrow works in both OSs.

The wine version seems to be pretty old, i don't know whether it supports
drives. In my system i have something like '/home/zer0c00l/.wine/drive_c/'
which is created by wine. Normally it is used as a C Drive. Please consider
updating your wine installation.

Exactly. Solr is a very powerful  open source indexer around.  Its a
subproject of Apache Lucene and uses lucene libraries for indexing. Well
supported by the community.  You could use Tika content extraction framework
to index not only html but also a lot of other rich text documents such as
doc, ppt, xls, rtf, pdf , even tar.gz, bzip, zip formats.

Initcron  Labs  has designed a appliance for solr by name Blaze.  Check it
out at  http://www.initcron.org/blaze .

There is also another lucene based project called Nutch  which provided web
specific features such as crawler, html parser, link graph database etc. You
can also integrate solr and nutch to build a solution.

Here are a few useful links
Solr: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/
Tika + Solr :

Nutch: http://nutch.apache.org/about.html
Solr + Nutch: http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/RunningNutchAndSolr
Lucene: http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html


If you are looking for assistance/consulting to implement solr based
solution, contact me off the list.

This sure is quite interesting.

But I bet it is not going to be easy.

I have heard about lucene. Since it is Java ....

But I hear it is there in Python as well. Even perl.

Hmmm.:-) Any idea why different shortcuts for windows and GNU/Linux

Agreed there is a learning curve here. However you wont need to go into
lucene/solr internals in order to implement it. All you have to do is
install it and then use which ever is your favorite language  to submit
documents to solr, which uses REST API (get/post) and returns output as XML.
I had successfully implemented solr solution not going into java internals
and using pycurl.    There are python extensions available for solr/lucene.
A couple of them are
http://code.google.com/p/pysolr/
http://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/

You can use:

  $ sudo yum install mysql-server mysql

If you want to search for any software, use:

  $ yum search <software-name>

In future, please use a search engine (like Google) for such

Here's what apache's documentation[1] has to say on forward proxy
"An ordinary forward proxy is an intermediate server that sits between
the client and the origin server. In order to get content from the
origin server, the client sends a request to the proxy naming the
origin server as the target and the proxy then requests the content
from the origin server and returns it to the client. The client must
be specially configured to use the forward proxy to access other
sites."

there is a general confusion about what a forward proxy is and what a
reverse proxy is and whether there is any difference between the two.
For example there is this article:

http://wiki.nognu.de/nginx_as_forward_proxy

and in general this search result:

http://duckduckgo.com/?q=nginx+forward+proxy

please see the later results

The proper terminology is virtual machine more commonly addressed as
vitualization.  Generally the OS running in the VM does not know
whether it is running on bare metal hardware or a VM.    IMO, you can
run majority of the applications in a VM, for instance ERP like
openbravo.

First, sorry for hijacking this thread and my reply for the above,

MySQL server and client is already installed in all the systems and also
mysql service is automatically set to run.

check for

$ service mysqld status

and see whether mysql is running.  To login

$ mysql -u root -h localhost -p <enter>

when prompted for password, just enter and you will get mysql prompt.

I am looking for a solution that will scan multi page documents and
convert the text therein and import the content into OO Writer -
something akin to Omnipage for Windows.  Omnipage scans the document
and imports the text into the "default" word processor with a "best
fit" formatting.  User can then edit that file.

>From my preliminary search looks like it is a 3 step process on Linux:

1. Scan the document into a tiff format and then
2. Run the tiff file through gocr and then
3. Open OO writer and import the text file for formatting.

Would appreciate feedback and/or suggestions/tips if you have any
experience with OCR on the Linux desktop.

Not sure if you've already solved this problem. If not, check your
SELinux settings,
If it is only for development purposes, the easiest thing to do is to
disable SELinux.

Hi, I think your mysql daemon is not running. Please check its status using: sudo service mysqld status
If it is not running, please start it using sudo service mysqld start.

Not sure if you've already solved this problem. If not, check your
SELinux settings,
If it is only for development purposes, the easiest thing to do is to
disable SELinux.

You could try Gambas [1] or Mono [2], but, do have a look at other
alternative tools, languages that you can use on *nix platforms for
GUI development like GTK+, Qt, wxWidgets etc [3].

xdr - library routines for external data representation ? 
These routines allow C programmers to describe arbitrary data structures in a machine-independent fashion. Data for remote procedure calls are transmitted using these routines.

Hi,

there is a general confusion about what a forward proxy is and what a
> reverse proxy is and whether there is any difference between the two.
> For example there is this article:
>
>
As far as Nginx is concerned, it works on a HTTP 1.1 to a browser and HTTP
1.0 to backend servers. Since HTTP 1.0 doesn't implement "keep alive", every
request object is destroyed after use. Hence, ideally its not suitable to be
used as a forward proxy where connection pooling is important [1].
On a side note we have been using Nginx as a reverse proxy for the last 2
years. It handles peak loads of 1200+ reqs/sec easily. There is nothing
comparable to it as a webserver and a reverse proxy(with load balancing).

Anwyays, thanks for all the responses I'm gonna give a shot at Apache's
traffic server (claimed to handle tens of thousands of connections and also
widely used in yahoo's infrastructure) [2]

You can have sudo in Fedora. Just edit /etc/sudoers file as superuser, or use visudo. Add the line USERNAME ALL=(ALL) ALL, where USERNAME is the username. By the way, is your mysql running now?

Hi,


     There are several torrent clients for Linux. KTorrent is good if you use KDE, Transmission is also good, although it lacks many features, it is the default torrent client for many distros. Vuze ( formerly Azureus) is also very capable, but is slow due to the Java engine, which it uses. KGet, also has some basic torrent features. FrostWire ( like LimeWire) can also be used. For using Vuze, in fedora, type "yum -y install azureus", as superuser. For using Transmission, in fedora type "yum -y install transmission" as superuser.

Hi,


    You can try pavucontrol, it helped me in using my 5.1 surround sound system. Make sure that your headphones are connected to the proper jack. If it is a front-panel connection, please make sure the wires are connected, and also that the BIOS Settings are correct.

Hi,


     Forward proxy, is for connecting multiple clients, using 1 proxy server. Reverse proxy, is for connecting multiple HTTP Server, as 1 HTTP Server, so that the load is balanced. Basically, Forward proxy is for the client side, and reverse proxy is for the servers. You can also give Squid a try, it is very powerful and flexible.

Hi,


    I suggest you don't develop software, on a closed platform like Microsoft .Net. Why don't you give the other languages a try, so that you wouldn't have the problem of vendor lock-in, in the future? You can try Qt, GTK, Google's GO, or Ruby. If you're interested in Rapid Application Development (RAD), then you can use an IDE like Eclipse. You can also take a look at Platform as a Solution (PAAS) Cloud Computing like Google App Engine, for your development.

Hi,


    You can try reinstalling grub, on /dev/sda. Please make sure you've given the Chainloader +1 in the Windows Entry. By the way, I'd suggest you to remove Windows 7, as a dual booting option, and have it as a Virtual Machine inside Ubuntu.

Why are going by this way ? BSNL teracom modem comes with default support for linux . It comes with bin file , when installed you will get the gui .


If you could not get this file . You browse for ZTE modem driver , and install it for Fedora . Now when you plug in your BSNL modem it would detect the device . you must install mobile broadband information from fedora repository . If installed it may default configuration for BSNL , but change the access point to bsnlnet and your are done .

This worked for me . Give it a try.

I came to the conclusion that HDA Intel does not have good support available

Hi,
Am thinking to create a distribution which will consists of all
softwares used in 4year engineering life. (you may scold creating a
distribution cannot be considered as project).

Due to some problem one of our lab is installed with ubuntu but within
3months of time ubuntu is removed. Reasons are faculty members find it
difficult to use(!),they are'nt ready to learn new things(they need
only start menu),they are'nt ready to search for alternatives and to
use it. So am thinking to create a distribution which will be more or
less as like windows(so that they will not hate it and in long run
they will become interested in free software) and it will consists all
required softwares preinstalled.

Tell me a suggestion whether to start this or to try anyother(if
creating a distribution is not worthy).

If other means, Is there any company or project centre to train for
projects in opensource.

Project Centre != Open Source
Open Source projects are about your willingness to explore and put your 
time into a software for which your heartbeats. There is NO project 
centre concept here - the proliferation of project centers is the sad

Instead of creating another distro, if you can convince your department in
setting up a FOSS lab, we can setup the lab with all the required open
source software equivalents.

Anna University, Thirunelveli has introduced "open source lab" in the 7th
semester as per the 2008 revised regulation.

Personally, I feel that this is a good idea; but not as a final year
project. During your course, get hold of your juniors, and may be ask them
to create a distro, so that they can learn and they would fee a part of the
FOSS activities in your college.

We have done the same in our university - installed GNU/Linux distribution
(Ubuntu) on all the machines in our lab. We (FOSS Club) also came up with a
custom Ubuntu distribution for Amrita University. But, finally the
University/College lab admins must really support this and also you will

In my humble opinion, if you really want to do a good final year project,

I think you are mistaking VM to be VMWare  - VM stands for Virtual Machine.

There are quite a few FOSS VM solutions - VitualBox, Linux KVM,
openVZ, XEN  (FOSS parts), qemu, bochs  to name a few.  I would
suggest that you first get a good understanding of the various
virtualization techniques.   Search the 'Net, learn the fundamental
concepts, then lay down your requirements and the look for a solution
that best fits your needs.

It is really a sad state of affairs when the very people who are
supposed to open the minds (be the guiding light) of the future
generation have an extremely closed mind set and are unwilling to look
at different things, upgrade their skill set and keep up with the
times.    Sadly, this is the state of affairs in the majority of the
educational institutions and we claim to be the world's "IT power
house"

To mitigate the UI issue  I have found  the "XPGnome"  theme [1] for
the GNOME desktop works with end users.   Most people get pysched out
when they do not see the familiar "Start" button on the bottom left
corner of the screen that is the crux of the problem.  They have no
problems clicking on the button and discovering the applications from
there.

I have done a Cybercafe roll out with Ubuntu desktops using this theme
and the owner has not complained of any user issues.   In fact, some
of his users have also brought .docx files edited them in OO.

Now I did a work around solution for it.

Extracted the .deb file and placed the files manually in the respective
folders.
Rebooted the system.
Now wvdial is working .
I sent this mail after connecting it

BSNL thinks that linux is only Ubuntu !!!

Here is the [foss] project guiding center for final year students

http://openvidya.fossfactory.in/

You may contact Mr.Thyagarajan Shanmugham (mentioned in the above

Hi,

I have code written in c way back in  mid 90's I want to run this
executable over a web server and hence I want to convert the same into
php. To rewrite the same all over again would be very challenging. I was
wondering if there is any tool to convert the same to php /java with
minimum tinkering with the logic.

Application: Bonita

What it is:

Bonita Open Solution is an open-source BPM and Workflow suite, created in 2001.

Features:

Bonita is made of 3 major components :

Bonita Studio: allows the user to graphically modify business
processes following the BPMN standard. The user can also connect
processes to other pieces of the Information System (such as
messaging, ERP, ECM, databases...) in order to generate an autonomous
business application accessible as a web form. Bonita Studio also
allows the user to design graphically the forms that will be shown to
the end user in order to interact with the process. Moreover, the
Studio allows the user to get started with processes designed with
other standards and technologies such as XPDL or jBPM. It relies on
Eclipse.

Bonita BPM Engine: The BPM engine is a JAVA API that allows you to
interact programmatically with your processes.It is available under
LGPL. It relies on Hibernate

Bonita User Experience: is a portal that allows each end-user to
manage in a webmail-like interface all the tasks in which he or she is
involved. The portal also allow the owner of a process to administrate
and get reports about processes. It relies on GWT.

Can you check output of:

Do you have any device files in /dev/lp* or /dev/ttyUSB*?

Are you able to detect this printer through gnome-control-center ->
Printing, and able to print anything from any GUI application?

How much is this printer, and what are its dimensions (do you have a
picture of it)?

?Sometimes we require a particular job to stop for a certain period
and start again.

Most of us familiar with the KILL command, But here is another cool
feature of the KILL command,

$ kill -STOP <pid>

$ kill -CONT <pid>

This 'll stop the given PID since it has been not restarted with the
command -CONT.

:-)

Ex:

$ kill -STOP 9952 (For Stop)

$ kill -CONT 9952 (For Continue)

Thanks. They seem to ship only Windows drivers. I see only
documentation for their product, user manual for Windows driver
installation. But, their website mentions that they have Linux
drivers:

  http://www.tvs-e.in/pos/Specification-just-bill-rp45.asp

Can you please write to them and find out where we can get the Linux

hi to all

i missed lot of events because i dont know when and where the meets and
events conducted ?

recently i missed hackfest in I.I.T ...please inform the forthcoming events
of php meets and lots of meets conducted by foss or ilugc ?

or else the meets conducted by behalf of Ilugc or Foss inform before a week
or 2 days before to plan atleast to attend the meetings !

some of them posting after finished the events

if inform previously its easy to remember the events and plan accordingly to
that and its better to go and attend atleast the meets or events

its an better to update the forth coming events in a month calender in our
ilugc website to plan and see better useful to others

because i have more time so i need to spend more involving the activites
,events to learn more !

so thats y i putting my request to ilugc

Hi GY,

If you know C, It is very easy to convert it into php extension. I
recommended you to go through this document.

To run C code in web server you dont need to convert to PHP  to do
that. You can do that via cgi scripting. Where it directly supports
your code to be run in native language. Apache httpd server comes with
mod_cgi. So most likely you have cgi enabled web server. So just
configure it properly and enjoy without needing to rewite the code in
another language.

My suggestion is to keep the facebook page for ILUG-C alive and put up
the calendar there. A better option would be to create a shared calendar
on some calendar service like Google Calendar or an open source
alternative if you prefer so.

Message-ID: <776142.63451.qm@web94615.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

Few points about Dot-matrix Printers(DMP)

If it is usb the device file will be /dev/usb/lp[0-n]. /dev/lp[0-n] if it is parallel.
A simple cat >/dev/usb/lp0 will print.
Some printers will start only after encountering \f form feed.
The permission on the device will be usually root or lp. 
You may have to adjust permissions.
I have about 25 DMPs. I do not use cups as it is very slow. 
I have my own perl scripts which take care of printing DMP's over the
network, If required I can give it.
Since the above supports epson esc-p system, no need for any driver for printing plain text. Just cat will do.

About cost: Though DMPs are expensive to buy they are cheap to print - about 2-3 paise per page. However, I think for such small sized printer I feel there is no advantage with DMP.

If you?re into astronomy, or have a romantic streak, you might be
interested in Lunar Clock, which adds a moon phase indicator to the
panel.
 To install it,

$ sudo apt-get install glunarclock.

Once it?s installed, right-click a blank spot on the panel where you
want the applet to appear, select Add to panel, and then select 'Lunar
Clock' from the list.Before using it, you must tell it where you are
on the Earth so it?s accurate.

 To do this, right-click its icon, click Preferences, and then the
Location tab. You?ll need your latitude and longitude figures?these
can be obtained by typing the name of your town/city into
http://www.geonames.org.

I have parallel and usb (very few). But my script simply does a cat.

It is highly customised to my hospital environment -requiring sockets etc - about 4-5 scripts in all. I will try to make it generic and post it in few days.

Dear Raman,

Perl has excellent CPAN modules for formatting.

Text::Reform comes to mind.

And of course we could use Perl's own write function.

I only recently purchased a printer and I will start fiddling with
these things only later.

I also love a2ps for what it can do. It is simply amazing.

When my grandfather was alive (some 5 years ago) I took a printout
of source code and RFC standard documents neatly formatted with
headers and borders and even syntax highlighting in B & W and
even my thatha was impressed.

You can just add an ethernet cable between the PC eth0 and laptops
eth0, configure them with custom ip addresses and rsync/scp the files
you need. I think that should work most of the time.

btw, though I replied (my mistake too), you should have started a new

Hi,

I will try.

Just add a ethernet cable between the two machines. That is
straightforward, right?

On each machine, as root, do the following.

machine1 # ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2
machine2 # ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.3

you should be able to ping the machines from one another. Then rsync the folders

machine1 # rsync -r machine2:/path/to/files .

should do the trick. Again, this is not the only way. I am not sure
what GUI options are available. Some research on google should give
you all the methods you can try.

I dunno if cross and straight cables are relevant anymore.

Arun told me that nowadays this is a non issue.

We can also connect machines together with a null modem serial
cable but that is slower, messy and of course more complex.

hmm, that might be. but then for machines that are not older than 2-3
years, this should not be an issue.

then had no problem - the others had.

I am using wifi to do this between my desktop and laptop works very well
no messing with any settings at all. Most distros detect wifi adaptors
with out a prob. On my desktop I use dlink usb and the laptop has built
in intel pro My Airtel broadband  has a wifi router.

I used that them extensively during 90's and early 2000 yes they are slow compared to the 10/100 Ether net or wifi of today.;-)

I can confirm that , the drivers are available for GNU/Linux. I have seen
TVS printers in Govt schools, where they connect the printer with SLED (suse

I heard that TVS  has hastily developed drivers for GNU/Linux to get the

True. But Govt. schools use only DMPs and not POS printers, and TVS-E
provide  GNU/Linux drivers for almost all DMPs in their website and not for
POS printers AFAIK.

Hi to all.

Finally, with the help of Mr. Raman sir my printing problem has been
solved in simple way of using the following command.

root@shan-laptop:~# cat sample.txt > /dev/usb/lp0

We need to stop the cups for this process.

thanks to all of you, for kind response.

ffmpeg in Ubuntu doesn't have inbuilt support for amr. I guess, the
same applies for debian. In the past I have compiled ffmpeg from
sources, it's not too difficult. Else, for ubuntu, ffmpeg from
medibuntu repositories has worked for me. I am not sure how well it
will work out for Debian, do give it a try.

Go for usb_modeswitch http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/ for .tar.gz
or install it using yum and once you do that replug your device
type ' dmesg |tail '
in terminal this will tell whether your modem has switched over to modem
mode from
storage mode once you get something like /dev/ttyUSB*
you can proceed to configure wvdial

this helped me hope this help you too.
happy hacking

What's the problem with networking? I haven't tried windows but with
Linux, i have internet working out of the box. Make sure NAT is
selected in your network configuration in VirtualBox, which is default
anyways.
With guest addons installed, USB should also work.

Since its initial release, the document has been heavily updated and
abridged. Thus, all particular examples have been removed from it, while
leaving general concepts only.

Despite some controversial points, author of this document believes to have
shattered the myths about open source software, particularly Linux.

did you try nagios ? I have not tried it personally but have heard its
not straight
forward to configure it. I have heard its quite stable.
Check this nagios report from apache, http://monitoring.apache.org/status/

This link might help.

Also check hyperic, which is not mentioned in the above link.

hi elango,

There is no free ware concept in opensource/free software world.
freeware means software in which source is closed but it is available
at free of cost.

In ubuntu "wget" is the download manager which comes default and it is
known to me as best. just type "wget siteaddress" in terminal.

IMHO there is no specific download manager for music,picture etc.
download manager will not check the content whether it is picture or
audio or anyother,it will just split the file and download it

See if 'query' here and the SQL statement in your PSQL prompt match

query = "select * from sales offset(select count(*)%d..... blah blah
print query
disp = cur.execute(query)
...
...

Its mostly likely that you are executing the wrong query.

Message-ID: <AANLkTik9VN=rD0X4g5UCpbUwi3Vgd9vCtvNqgpmSMkiB@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I guess the subject says it all. I wish to create a open source STL like
library for C as my BTech final year project here at SASTRA University,
Tanjore. What do you guys think? Is it a worthy one? If so, are there places
where I can approach in case I get stuck at some point and Google is not
able to help me?

Warm regards,

I may be misunderstanding but isn't Glib similar to something you aspire to do ?

Nice idea.

Nice idea to do something on your own and to post to  a mailing list like this
instead of copying someone else's work. Great.

Now STL and C may not really work. You can of course do it.

But C is deliberately meant to be lean and it supposedly allows creativity and
 makes people shoot themselves in the wrong foot.

It is the geekiest programming language on earth.

C++ on the other hand is meant to make things simpler and STL is very
much a C++ thing.

Then of course you need to consider the fact that there is a cultural
issue here.

I would suggest some other projects which you may love to do.

Take your pick.

1) Create a simple socket based peer to peer application for file sharing

2) Write an iPhone application using Objective C. This has good
future. It can help you get a job. But I have zero experience in this.
Ask Arun Venkatasamy in this list for more details.

3) Create a multimedia application with mplayer. More details in my article.

http://linuxjournal.com/9787

4) Find out a perl program to analyze logs

5) Do some cool thing with ssh port forwarding and create a GUI for a
remote shell

Enjoy learning and programming.

I know most luggies are that.

You look at DirectConnect. Then there are many other.

p2p is very complex but cool stuff.

Okay I will give a brief intro since I am one of world's known names
in p2p NAT traversal.

Sounds boring eh? ;)

Does not matter.

Anyway so this is the deal.

You know client server computing. You have a web server and the
browser is the HTTP Client.

Similarly Outlook is the client and Exchange or some other mail server
is the Server.

So all TCP/IP protocols use this concept of one server and multiple
clients connecting to it.

Normally a fork() is done to serve each client(simplified view).

With p2p, this model is taken to the next level.

You have one server node and multiple client nodes(computers) in a
normal network.

In a p2p network you have every node acting as client as well as server.

So you have the usual client server architecture here also albeit in a
complex fashion.

You have machines not only connecting to the server but also each other.

This is the way instant messaging and XMPP protocols work. VoIP, skype
and so on.

Now for file sharing, you need to do a few things above this basic setup.

I will discuss more things later. People tend not to read long mails.

I have time but later on. Long mails are a problem.

Best,
Girish

I did install guest addons and selected NAT yet the usb is not detected
though the devices menu shows the two connected devices but they are not
selectable I also check the vbox site and found I did exactly as per

You can check all the supported formats by
ffmpeg -formats

You should see an 'Encoding' support for your required format.
Some formats will be 'Decoding' support only.

Hi Vinoth,

Good to know that you are interested in learning the new things and
you reached a great place.
But, we would like you to do a google search before asking questions.

As you know already, you are asking some big concept in simple two lines,
it will take much effort and time to explain you everything in mail as
you asked.

Moreover, google has tons and tons of tutorials and how-to documents on
setting LDAP in linux.

You will wonder how google is giving you all you want, if you do a
simple search.
see yourself by clicking the following link.
http://www.google.co.in/#sclient=psy&hl=en&q=how+to+configure+ldap+in+linux

We will be so happy to know the progress on your search, learning and
experiments
with LDAP with linux,

Feel free to contact us anytime, if you stuck somewhere in the
progress of setting LDAP.
Provide complete details on your OS version, the document that you
follow, your infrastructure and
where your stopping.
With these details, it will be easy for us to solve your issue.

Happy Learning.

Wishes.

You would have to recompile libavcodec which is done by configuring
VLC or mplayer and download and
recompile the 3gpp libraries.

mencoder is sometimes much better than ffmpeg for this sort of thing.

Hope I am not confusing. I recently wrote an article on a related
topic. Perhaps it will interest others.

In the case of a LAN the server is implicitly trusted. Then the server
has to authenticate the connecting clients with a user name
and password. LDAP can do it of course but I have never set it up
anytime. It is complex.

Simply create multiple user accounts in Linux and make people access
it using that from LAN.

Subject: [Ilugc] peer to peer networking tutorial
Message-ID: <AANLkTimu-xog8PoTDUa_wAcY1BKKes0o2GF-jOnKcxGO@mail.gmail.com>

I was very surprised and pleasantly requested to present an overview of p2p.

It goes like this.

The biggest problem in p2p is the ability to function as a server from
behind a public NAT IP address.

What is a NAT IP?

Usually we use 192.168.0.0/16 or 172.16.0.0/12 or 10.0.0.0/8 addresses
for private networks.

Most of the time it is in the 192.168 range.

These are known as RFC1918 private IP ranges which can be reused but
are not public. You cannot run a server using
them. You can only run clients on them.

In order to go out on the Internet even as a client a NAT software
like the MODEM/router or some such thing translates this private
IP to a public one.

For a server to be able to reply back to a client from the Internet
both need to have globally unique public IP addresses the sort of
address a NAT box has.

Or you would have to manually do port forwarding or even do it with ssh.

Anyway this is the biggest problem faced by IM protocols and Skype.

How can somebody from behind a NAT without a public IP get notified
that someone wishes to talk to them?

Complex stuff no?

In order to do that we have to have a rendezvous server. Look at my article.

http://linuxjournal.com/9004

Now don't get distracted.

Once you are able to access from behind a NAT, the next thing you
would need to do for p2p is being able to
run the application from on top of the p2p architecture.

Vembu technologies, a million dollar company in Velachery has a backup
software that does p2p over a network.

I have done some very critical work for them in 2007.

And file sharing protocols need to build a certain complex
architecture on top of the p2p infrastructure which is already complex
but the advantage is that you get a lot of resilience, fault tolerance
and scalability which no
client server arch can give.

Okay I think now you guys should take over.

Specifically when it comes to file sharing I am afraid I do not have
the requisite knowledge.

You will have to have a protocol like the stupid noisy NetBEUI or some
such thing using Samba.

You can discover p2p nodes that way.

Then you need to share files using NFS or Samba using p2p.

It will sure be fun.

But a lot of work. Even if you dont' come up with anything great you
would have learnt a lot about networking in the
process and you would be on the way towards becoming a knowledgeable
as I in networking in about 10 years.

I have been doing networking all my life, I started in college in
Trichy back in 1996 and still going strong.

Think of it.

LDAP requires a good amount of system/network admin knowledge.   I
would suggest that you understand the basics of how LDAP works i.e.
architecture level.   Once you understand that then you have many
options for choosing the implementation like openLDAP, Apache
Directory Server, Fedora DS (don't recall the new name) Without such
knowledge you will be running around in circles; no amount of detailed
explanation will help you.  Alternately, get professional help if you
are in a rush to set up network based user authentication.

BTW, if you ever consider MS-ADS for authentication; it is basically
LDAP+Kerberos + MS prop. extensions bundled into one package.

I think the OP is talking about user auth. as in the login process on
each client machine, with userid and password being stored in a
central directory.

In a small network where each user works on one and only that one
system, this would be the easier option.

In a scenario, where users can be assigned to any system,  I do not
know of any way other than LDAP or NIS (plus optional Kerberos
integration).

You need to install 'curl' package.

Get your external IP address

$ curl ifconfig.me/ip -> IP Adress

$ curl ifconfig.me/host -> Remote Host

$ curl ifconfig.me/ua ->User Agent

i/o error while  copying './casper/filesystem.squashfs
so its confirmed that the CD has  a problem

ofcourse i tried this one also - the test.iso from the CD gave me
md5shcheksum different from that of the downloaded iso image.

> Smarter way: when you burn any iso to disc, ensure you

But then I tried another thing, I was not sure if the downloaded iso
image is OK.
so I extracted the downloaded ISO image to a  dir  and did md5sum -c md5sum.txt
whose output is
./casper/initrd.lz: OK
./casper/filesystem.manifest: OK
./casper/filesystem.manifest-desktop: OK
./casper/filesystem.squashfs: OK
./casper/vmlinuz: OK
... etc all OK

this simply means that the filesystem.sqashfs file is fine with
checksums but somehow it doesnt get right while burning it on the CD

I have checked writing the downloaded ISO image  on 4 CDs and all of
them have trouble readng with this filesystem.squashfs from the burnt
CD.
Please let me know.
thanks,

Hi

Just read that the usb support under gust addons is only available under
enterprises version and that too under glosed sorce.. here is the
extract..
Closed-source features ?
The following list shows the enterprise features that are only present
in the closed-source edition. Note that this list may change over time
as some of these features will eventually be made available with the
open-source version as well.

      * Remote Display Protocol (RDP) Server
        This component implements a complete RDP server on top of the
        virtual hardware and allows users to connect to a virtual
        machine remotely using any RDP compatible client.
        
      * USB support
        VirtualBox implements a virtual USB controller and supports
        passing through USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 devices to virtual machines.
        
        They are yet to release them is what I feel had installed vbox
        ver 3.2.10 has anyone used usb support on this if so what tweaks
        need to be done else what is the ver you have used. ?

Correct. You'll need to download the free version from the Oracle site and
not the OSE version for USB access. I had the same issue with OSE and
switched to the Oracle free version.

Hi,

I am replying like a new thread because for some reason mails are not
getting delivered to my inbox and I cannot login to play around with the
settings. I am still figuring out the problem. Anyway, lets set that aside
and thanks to all for replying.

As Sankarshan Mukhopadhyay said, there exists Glib. But it does not target
at STL like functionality directly. It deals with stacks, queues, dequeues,
singly and doubly linked lists, arrays, binary trees, n-array trees,
sequences and a few other data structures only. However, it lacks the
support for graphs, hash tables and several algorithms that exist like
searching, sorting, traversing etc. Also, Glib sounds kinda complex to me
personally and this project idea could benefit people like me as I will try
to create easily usable library functions.

As Girish suggested, STL is a C++ thing and not a C thing. I agree totally.
But in cases when you need to demo the algorithm in class as a teacher or
use these data structure operations in quick prototyping of an algorithm or
software you are developing, I think my proposed idea serves well. What say?
Thanks for the other ideas too.

Warm Regards,
Harish.R.

Glib has been in use for a long time now and is not that difficult to
use. Coming up with something like Glib is not that easy either. Glib
has a ton of utility functions and the documentation is easy to
follow, even for stupid programmers like me.
If you feel something is missing in Glib, why not just add the missing
functionality in Glib itself? Especially since Glib has all the
low-level details abstracted for you anyway. It would also help if you
can tell us what aspect of Glib you find to be complex. If it is the
sleep inducing GObject boilerplate code that you might end up writing,
take a look at Vala. Generates C code and makes Gobject based
programming painless.

If I were you, I'd save myself a lot of trouble by choosing a more
'high-level' language like Python or Ruby (even better, Lisp or
Haskell) for prototyping an algorithm. You can get a lot of job done
by writing less code. Its also easier to teach what the algorithm is
about with these languages as the written code is almost similar to a
pseudocode.

I was able to get the usb working following your link. Now I am not sure
what is the cause but the moment I tried to configure wifi uder the
guest VBox the host got disconnected from the internet and took almost 1
hour to reconnect. Any clue? it is a issue to worry  or just a
coincidence. Also under guest my wifi  access point was not available
fully it was just partially shown the point.

Is there any limitation of such nature where the host is deprived of the
device if guest wants it ?

I would not recommend vala for adding functionality to a Glib like
library. If the OP really implements the said features for Glib, I am
sure the Glib folks will be happy to take it into their codebase.

But the fact that Glib does not have such features YET, suggests that
there might be a reason.

Well I am sorry I misread the documentation on Vbox as devices will be available on both the host and guest I am wrong I read the documentation again and it very clear once host receives the device the host will loose it.
would have loved to have it at both places though as I will not be able
to share the host and guest on virtual network as I have only one usb
wifi available.Am digging to find an alternate to use network function
if any one has some exposure please shre the info.

Oops. I was referring to GObject/Glib programming in general.
I feel, the Vala codebase is an interesting playground for students.
Lot of opportunities to contribute.

I guess one of the reasons is that, being a utility library, Glib need
not have the implementations of all the algorithms under the sun.
As an API user, I won't care what sort algorithm Glib uses as long as
g_list_sort returns a sorted list correctly with a decent performance
:). (g_list_sort seems to use merge sort ;) )

@OP,
All the searching, sorting, hashmaps.etc are already there in Glib.
Graphs are not that hard to implement either. Just have a GHashMap
with GList as values and voila, you have an adjacency list. IMHO,
Implementing a full typing system like GObject and building something
like Glib on top of it is just crazy, especially considering the fact
you want to do it as part of an academic project where you are
time-constrained. That said, there is nothing wrong in doing it. The
experience and the pain might be worth it ;).

Interesting - looks like VB now allows any user to fire up a VM.
IIRC, in earlier versions (about 18-24 months ago) the user had to be
a member of 'vboxusers' group otherwise the VM would not fire up.

Hi to all.

I am using Ubuntu 10.04

I cant login as a root user from terminal, if i use sudo from normal user i
got
error msg like sudo: must be setuid root

I got this problem after i executing the following command as a root user

(i.e) chmod 777 -R /. (i did this while answering a call)

i think this is the problem which i committed.

Now How can i restore the permissions?

How would that work? He destroyed permissions on his whole filesystem.
sudo won't give him super-user because it can't.

I think your best bet is to use a LiveCD. Use the LiveCD to mount your
partitions and then restore them using methods similar to those
documented here: <http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/476>.

Made it into a shell script so I don't have to go searching for
options each time though it's mostly straightforward.

Will add a simple frontend to it next week, probably using zenity.

Interesting article, but it ends when it's just about to get interesting.
In this case, the devil is in the details.

Would recommend the OP to backup his data and reinstall.  That's the
safest way to fix massively broken file permissions.

Solution:

I also got the same problem. It was because mysqld service was not running.

If root user type the following in the command prompt---
chkconfig mysqld on
service mysqld start 

> sudo is not there in fedora

sudo is there in fedora also

Normally if you do 777 / then it is very hard to get back on keel.

Such quick fixes are somewhat dangerous.

For /tmp you should give chmod 1777 .

For others particularly /home you should give user perms.

For user foo,

# chown -R foo /home/foo

and so on.

Best of luck.

Indeed. I forgot to add that the real good advice is in the comments.
All you have to do is fix the package manager and then you can have it
reinstall every package on the system.

Gasp.

Why would you want so much money?

Are you running a bot of supercomputers computing the distance
to Andromeda or something?

You are better off importing this from Taiwan I think.

If you want to share files, then install guest additions and enable file
sharing in vbox. If you want to perform networking functions between the
host and guest, you can use the "Internal Networking" or "Host Only
Networking" options. These allow multiple VMs on the same host to
communicate with each other too.

If you have a single VM, then you could as well use the "NAT" option, where
by default "10.0.2.15" is assigned as IP of guest via DHCP and "10.0.2.2" is
the internal virtual interface's IP of host.

If an encrypted connection is what you want, then you can create a VPN
server and client design (using OpenVPN maybe) in one of the options
mentioned above. It's the same process as creating a VPN server and client
design between two machines in a normal scenario right, or am I missing
something here?

The max I've seen with the white box resellers is 4GB DIMMs.  You'll
need a motherboard with 6 DIMM slots to load 6 x 4GB DIMMs.

Server memory (Dell/HP/IBM) have higher density 8GB DIMMs with ECC.
Contact your vendor for pricing.


> Any hint on price ??

Chennai component prices: http://www.deltapage.com/list/index.html


Note that you will need to check your motherboard/chipset docs to
find out the max supported RAM on your hardware.  If you are loading
large amounts of RAM for any critical workload, suggest you consider
ECC memory.

Friends.

I have to work on some huge text files that are around 2GB - 10GB.
Have to read some content on those files and have to rewrite them.
Mostly have to cut/copy/paste/edit the contents in random areas.

sed, awk kind of utilities can not be used as the data is not under
regex and the manual operation/verification is must.

I have a 2GB RAM machines.
Opening in vim takes much time and every action takes 20-30 min.

Is there any possibilities to speed up the progress?
I have many computers that are idle.

How can I create a cluster of RAMs from those idle machines, so that I
can work on those huge files easily?
Is it possible?

Are there any other ways?


Thanks.

Until someone more knowledgeable answers here goes, 
I've had experience with ETL tools that can handle such data with 
amazing ingenuity. Though some prior knowledge of the structure in data
is expected.

What kind of data are you working with?

(Can't help wondering how long it would take someone to interactively
edit 2GB text files!)

Without knowing anything about the layout of your text files, the simplest
suggestion would be to split up the files into smaller chunks, perform
your edits, and join them in the end.


> I have a 2GB RAM machines.
> Opening in vim takes much time and every action takes 20-30 min.

Vim does a lot of things in background -- maintain undo database,
syntax highlighting, automatic indenting, etc.  To edit large files
in vim see this:
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1506

Will not help.  You can't really cluster RAM unless you have a custom
interconnect hardware as on super computers (eg. NUMA, RDMA).

With commodity hardware the latency in moving multiple GB of data
between your computers will defeat any expected speed improvements.


Main bottleneck is when you write these files out to disk.  In Unix you
can only extend the file in the end, if you want to insert data in the
beginning/middle of a file, you have to rewrite all data following your
insertion point.  Splitting large files into smaller sizes helps.

Thanks for the inputs.

Will think on splitting the file into multiple parts.

No, that won't help.

You have to open files in less which loads up instantly , then switch
to vi with
 the 'v' key...

Hi Shrini ,

If you have number of idle machine, you may use Apache Hadoop:
http://hadoop.apache.org/.  The beauty is,  it is open source and  runs on
commodity hardware.

HDFS + MapReduce is a very effective solution for large file (e.g Log
processing, Web index building, Distributed Grep, Inverted Index,
Distributed Sort ...).

HDFS - distributes data.
MapReduce - distributes application.

Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is designed to handle large files
(multi-GB) with sequential read/write operation. Each file is automatically
broken into chunks, and stored across multiple data nodes as local OS
files.

MapReduce - MapReduce is a programming model for efficient distributed
computing. MapReduce provides API to write application.  Application written
in this style are automatically parallelized and executed on a large cluster
of commodity machines. The run-time system takes care of the details of
partitioning the input data, scheduling the program's execution across a set
of machines, handling machine failures, and managing the required
inter-machine communication. This allows programmers without any experience
with parallel and distributed systems to easily utilize the resources of a
large distributed system.

Thanks & Rg

I believe choosing an editor is a matter of taste. Each one has its
own pluses and minuses. I would suggest you to try Emacs, Vim, Eclipse
(IDE), etc and then decide which one is comfortable for you.
Personally I use emacs which is more than an editor. I use it as
Programming Environment, Personal Information Manager (TODO,
Appointments, Time Tracker),  Mail Reader, sometimes internet
browsing. Ever since I got introduced to emacs and learned GNU keys, I
never looked back.

If possible you can split based on context like - chapterwise etc 
- use csplit.

Jedit is my personal choice. I have tried few python programs in it and it
takes care of automatic indentation, code highlighting and all other

Thanks a lot. According to your suggestion the previous 'unknown encoder
h263' is gone after compiling ffmpeg from source. But, now getting new error
with audio codec. If I use the command with codec "aac", then I don`t get
any sound from my converted 3gp file:

/opt/ffmpeg-0.6.1/ffmpeg -i TV_output -s qcif -vcodec h263 *-strict
experimental -acodec aac** *-ac 1 -ar 8000 -r 25 -ab 32 -y TV_output.3gp

After using this, I can play my video but no audio.

Thanks for providing your link. But, I have already tested that. When I went
with your command:

/opt/ffmpeg-0.6.1/ffmpeg -i Test_TV -s qcif -vcodec h263 -acodec aac -ac 1
-ar 8000 -r 25 -ab 32 -y Output_TV.3gp

Then, this error ( or not! ) comes:

*encoder 'aac' is experimental and might produce bad results.*
*Add '-strict experimental' if you want to use it.*
*
*
After that, I used that "-strict experimental" option and it converts
without any audio, as I mentioned in my previous email.

Then you can try using mp3 or amr audio codecs.

For lame you can use libmp3lame, make sure you enabled it while compiling.

This is really frustrating!!!! I have installed libmp3lame0 from
debian-multimedia.org repo.
And, then tried the command:

/opt/ffmpeg-0.6.1/ffmpeg -i Test_TV -s qcif -vcodec h263 -acodec libmp3lame0
-ac 1 -ar 16000 -r 25 -ab 32 -y Output_TV.3gp

But, again, error:

*Unknown encoder 'libmp3lame0'*

You need to pass the parameter --enable-libmp3lame while compiling ffmpeg.
You can also pass
--enable-amr_nb --enable-amr_wb
if you want amr enabled.

And the acodec has to be libmp3lame, not libmp3lame0.
You might also need to --enable-nonfree if it fails to compile.

Hi 
I am using Airtel Broadband with UBUNTU 10.04 (upgraded from 9.04 -9.10)
using wifi I did nothing it detected by dlink usb adaptor and connected
to then net. Before doing this I just tried a live cd of ubuntu onm my
dell  laptop since it just worked fine tried the same on my desktop
where I have this usb adaptor. Now I installed the same on 100 gb
partition in a dual boot. See if can also get any usb wifi adaptor my
choice for usb is to reduce no of cables cluttering the table.
It also works with xp system from where I transfer files like any other
network work group set up.

Is this a screensaver?  A sentence or two about what the program does
would be helpful + distro info.

In openSUSE 11.3 that is what it shows up as:

$ zypper search cmatrix
Loading repository data...
Reading installed packages...

S | Name                | Summary

That should not require any special configuration other than that done
by your broadband provider on the router. Just set your system up to
use DHCP to configure your network.

Yes I guess that should be fine if OP is going to use only for
browsing / mails and routine activity. I have not yet tried that as a
server option I shall be doing so soon and will let the list know of ,my
experiment, in the meanwhile if any one has some exp please share the
same.

Hi

I wish to generate certificates on the fly, with a base certificate
image(jpeg) and writing the names dynamically(reading from a data
source). I need to write a script for this. Which language/library
will best suit my purpose?

You can use
http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php
for the image processing.

Since it is a command line app, you can use any scripting language to
interface it with the data source.

Friends.

Yesterday, we had a nice meeting with Prof. Prabhu Ramachandran.

He started with little intro to python.
He explained the powers of ipython shell.
Then, explored the python powered mathematical software sage [
http://www.sagemath.org ]
It is awesome to realiase the features of sage's web interface then
numpy and scipy.


Then, he moved to his favorite topic "MayaVi", the scientific
visualization tool. [http://mayavi.sourceforge.net]
As the original creator, he demonstrated the features and capabilities
of MayaVi.
using twisted, he has added networking features to MayaVi.

He explained the operations of FOSSEE. [http://fossee.in]
They are hiring open source enthusiasts. check at http://fossee.in/hiring

Kadambari announced scipy 2010.
SciPy.in is a national level event to promote Python for Education and
Scientific Computing.
This year it is happening in IIT Hyderabad, on Dec 13-18, 2010.
visit http://scipy.in for more info.

She distributed the posters and handouts.

Around 30 participants filled the hall and session was much interactive.
Here are some slides on past events: http://fossee.in/download

Thanks for Prabhu and Kadambari for spending their time with us.
We are so proud to meet and have the father of ilugc on our stage.

Here are some snaps:
