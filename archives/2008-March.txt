You might also require to embedded iso9660 fs driver into the ramdisk/ 
build it into the kernel itself.

Message-ID: <7bf1bec50803010538m416b8483qdc55d8b3e8f03c7d@mail.gmail.com>

Many would've noticed a 'global patent body' is in India lobbying for
a strong patent regime! ET reports here:

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Economy/Global_patent_body_invites_India/articleshow/2823913.cms

There is also a report about it here:

http://www.indiainfoline.com/news/innernews.asp?storyId=60285&lmn=1

The interesting part:

"Giving an industry perspective to the discussion, was Mr Phillip R.
Wadsworth, Vice President, IP Legal Counsel, Qualcomm, who mentioned
that it was important to ensure that there needs to be lot of
flexibility in IP laws. "It is imperative for those countries that do
not provide adequate IP protection for software investors to take
immediate action and ensure that judiciary enforces patents with
claims covering computer programs and computer program products",
stressed Wadsworth."

I think this as an attempt to bypass Indian law that does not allow
software patents. I think even in the US, it was the judiciary that
first legitimized patents for software. So, I think now they are
trying to influence the judiciary first and later use it to convince
the legislators!!

Anyone else here been following what this 'global patent body' is
doing in India? Am worried they are upto no good here.

regds,
mano

Hi Lug members,

Whats your opinion on broadcasting Lug meetings using live.yahoo.com as many
of them (like me) miss the sessions. All we need is Internet connection and
a good web cam available at the convention hall in Tenet.

Although the service is in Beta, but this could actually benefit those who
are in remote villages.

Hi,
Not to discourage u, we had several valid and invalid suggestion in
the past as i  am  good in understanding your visualization, to
broadcast the lug seminars to rural India.

 just to expand your thought and imagine,
------------------------------------------------------

How good if it will be if we organize a meet in the village. This
august we are going to be there in arunai engg college tvm and the
college provides us an opportunity  to show case our talents under the
topic urban development.

why not adopt a village some where near to arunai engg college (some
where near satanur dam  where Mr. A V Velu (chairman arunai engg
college) is the MLA, and make our students(the locals) as the
testimonials and make them to speak  on august arunai engg college
festival.

What about the time frame:
------------------------------------

we have time till august which means 24 saturdays and sundays.


where is the man power:
------------------------------
a minimum of 12 volunteers. arranging( all P.R.O) and related stuff)
and taking classes in the village which we adopted.

more effectively , two people visiting every week end and   taking
classes, which means every volunteer will have to visit the place for
4 times across 6 months....


Mode of commutation.
-------------------------------
Should ask the college management, else  SETC     Moffosil  bus , bull
a cart ride, trekking.


Really fantastic isnt it?.
Add your thoughts

Cheers

I most certainly cant understand the joke or the irony

Hmmm.

My problem is that I fear a loss in quality due to people jumping onto the 
ship simply because it pays more. They don't care for or like their work. 
They just do it because it pays more. They don't want to write good code. 
They just want to write code that satisfies the dumb (ie non-technical) 
customer and pays them. They don't want to know exactly why they configured 
something the way they did. They just do it because it starts running 
something which pays them. Ouch. Massive drop in quality.

`I went into the woods because I wanted to live deliberately. I wanted to live 
deep and suck out all the marrow of life... to put to rout all that was not 
life; and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.'

At this point, I'm kinda glad that most of the people *I* know in the FOSS 
world live by that -- either directly or indirectly. It all changes when the 
sole purpose of `money' comes into the picture. Already happening with PHP I 
guess. Not to mention the huge number of RHCEs who don't even know what the 
`suid' bit does. Oh well.

Message-ID: <fad10ddf0803020834s78995806me2ed5e18c7be602c@mail.gmail.com>

Recently ran into a situation where I needed to get at my firewall box from
my gui-free ubuntu host which I can SSH to from the public net. And I
thought: woot, I'm on linux so just use lynx. The problem is that all these
new fancy routers use a lot of javascript, and lynx just croaks when
confronted with JS.

I tried a few different solutions and finally settled on elinks (
http://elinks.or.cz), which does far more than a text-based web-browser ever
could. Now if only someone can figure out how to do a real-time rendering of
images and flash as ascii figlets, that would be a *really* worthwhile hack
:)

 Yeah I think most here share the same concerns, but
foss is also about evangelism so that more people join
the movement.

Have you tried the graphical version of elinks? Or w3m?

They are text mode browsers that can also display images if run from an
xterm. I know it does not apply to your case.

lynx looks a bit outdated though it has its ecological niche as well.
You can do background downloads and command line dump of URLs.

In fact Perls' CPAN module uses lynx precisely for that.

I stopped using text mode browsers a long time ago since I can always
figure out how to run X on pretty much any modern hardware.

X has also improved. And the fact that LCD monitors aren't that messy.

That said text mode is cool. ;)

While I agree with most of your points I disagree with the above. Just
as there are dumb technical people all non tech people are not dumb! I
have seen many so called techies accusing the non techies (aka
business, marketing...) as dumb in order to hide their own
incapabilities.

To make a living writing code one should learn to satisfy the customer.

This year's carte blanche event at MIT was held sucessfully - though the
attendance was thin.

The highlights were
a.About 90 visually handicapped students and adults turned up. Elcot
  staff did a great job in making them understand what a computer
  is and demonstarted orca software for them. ILUGC members who did
  not attend missed the golden chance of seeing FOSS in the hands of visually handicapped.

b.About 200 school students turned up (below 10th std). Older boys
  demonstrated how to use openoffice to their schoolmates. Gcompris
  was shown on projected screen and the students enthusiastically went
  the the educational activities in it. They had a nice with games
  also.

It is really nice to see this kind of activity. Current MIT final year
students must spread this enthu to Jrs and help them to continue this
kind of FOSS activities.

On Sunday, I was at PenguFest '08 at NIT(REC) Trichy and presented a
tutorial session on Shell Scripting and GCC. Nearly 20 students are
seems to be active. So I hope, we can see some more activities from
GLUG-T and NIT-T.

In a related note, check out this video on blind students trained by
Krishnakant Mane, one of active developer of Orca community. The
training session was organised by ELCOT during Oct 2007 and it is very
inspiring for every physically challenged person:

Had lots of problems with w3m javascript. I did not bother to try to debug

Basically when i hit a problem i switched to elinks and have not looked

Yeah, but the problem is when you don't have X installed at all. My general
rule has been to not install X on any of my servers (usually Webmin is as
far as I go for GUI management).

X has also improved. And the fact that LCD monitors aren't that messy.

In spite of X's improvements it still sucks :) I've been battling X for 16
years now. And I can't say that it has become any more pleasant to work with
over the years. The only good thing is that there is better documentation.
Obviously this is IMHO, so take that with a grain of masala.

Hi,

I'm using Ubunty Hardy. If I type Shft+[space] in an X session, no
character gets typed, but it gets typed as [space] on  a terminal (the
Ctrl+alt+f1 terminal). It's pretty irritating while touch typing :/
The terminal behavior is the behavior I want. I am sure thats how it
was earlier.

Any help?

thanks,

How about 

$ xmodmap -e "keysym space = Shift_L space" -e "keysym space = space" -e
"keysym space = Shift_R space"

All in one line.

Now Shift+Space works, but just space does not work :(
I tried reading up xmodmap's man pages and stuff, but haven't been
able to fix it myself.

(btw, Shift+Space works in the GDM login screen. Is there some gnome
setting for this?)

Friends.

We do web development in PHP/Linux.

All we have is Firefox. We do CSS as per Firefox standards.

But, our clients check in Internet explorer and report some viewing issues.
so, we need to test in IE too.

Is there any way to install IE in linux?
Is that legal one?

Thanks.

Sorry for the delay. Was out whole day.

I dunno why it works in the gdm login screen. Perhaps you are hitting
some bug.

If just space does not work then it is a big problem. I had that issue,
that is why I added a mapping for space as well. Did you give all three
mappings ?

Well I am out of ideas then.

Yes. Google IEs4linux.

Absolutely not. You are breaking the EULA by using it, since IE is to
be used only in Windows (I don't know the exact legalese, but this is
true).

PDF is a nice format. It reads "Portable Document Format". And AFAIK it
is precisely that. Works across all platforms.

And I wished to thank Satyajith Bhat anyway. The material looks
excellent to me. I am going to recommend them to all my friends who wish
to learn linux. In fact the material is very rich and comprehensive as
it covers many more topics than the description says.

I think there is no better format than PDF for document publishing.

I know how much trouble I had with magicpoint. And it is even possible
to embed videos in PDF using LaTeX beamer. 

But I am afraid I haven't tried that yet.

Any particular reason? PDF can be read online, or in almost any

I've been using IEs4Linux (http://www.tatanka.com.br/) for about 2 years now
(almost) and I've been very pleased with it. it obviously has the legal
issues, but it has saved me many times when I've been testing out web-sites.

Enjoy

If you are feeling motivated enough to run the example code, then by all
means do.

$ wget http://sirsasana.org/training/perl/handson.zip

and hack away.

Long live source code!

Or to put it differently with a twist.

 Your best bet is to buy a windows license and run it inside a virtual

Are you sure that you created a RAID 1 and not a RAID 0?  1GB (500+500) 
suggests RAID0.

IMO, you have got this inside out.  

A RAID device is equivalent to a hard disk.  For Linux software RAID 
they appear as /dev/md0 etc.

To do RAID you need 2 or more hard disks.  Although, one can create RAID 
volumes on the same hard disk using 2 physical part., it is only an 
academic exercise.

One can create filesystems or logical volumes on the RAID devices as 
shown below.

Hard disk (2 or more) -> HD partitions -> SW RAID volumes -> File 
systems or Logical Volumes.

BTW, avoid putting / on a Logical Volume

i have created a raid array /dev/md0 that has 2 active devices ( /dev/sda10 and /dev/sda11)and 1 spare device (/dev/sda12)
when i format and mount the array manually,there is no problem
but as soon as i make an entry into the /etc/fstab file and reboot the system,
the system goes into Maintenance mode reporting an error that 
"fsck.ext3:No such file or directory found while trying to open /dev/md0"
if i remove the entry from /etc/fstab . it works fine..but then i have to manually mount it everytime.

this is happening first time in the usual  process of creating RAID array from 3 diff partitons on a single SATA drive.
my os is Fedora 8.

i tried to make a node file for /dev/md0 but it already exists..and also there is no mdadm.conf file crerated.

he should be able to guide the student to do his project (not teach

year we had two students who did excellent work on madwifi.

IEs4Linux as such is not illegal - there's nothing wrong with posting 
about it. The FAQ on the site clearly says that you need to have a 
windows licence to use it. So it's up to the user whether to use it or 
not - but it still is a very valuable tool for a web developer.

even if you have a windows license you cannot run IE on linux - check  
the download page for IE - it clearly says that the EULA allows you  
to run IE ONLY on specified operating systems - and linux is not  
specified in the list.

Thanks for ur valuable suggestions.

Actually i could able to fix the problem by increasing the size of the
ram disk in the kernel configuration.
Previously my initial ramdisk image was quite big but my ram disk size
in the kernel was only 4K.
When i changed that to 16K and recompiled my kernel, i could able to
successfully boot from the cd.

Thanks

It will be great, Girish, to know the model names of some of them that
work on Linux. Please give the details of make and model number.

With best wishes for Unity in thinking, feeling and action.

Kenneth,
Posting information about how to make something work does not encourage
"illegal things". Knowledge is knowledge - whether I provide help to someone
or not has nothing to do with "illegal things". I'll leave the debate about
free speech and whether EULA's are legal/binding to a different thread -
it's not really worth arguing about on this forum.

To address your specific issue about using IE on a non-windows OS, I would
suggest you read the EULA carefully before you make claims about using the
components on non-authorized OS's! The EULA states (and this is repeated on
the IEs4Linux site):

NOTE:  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A VALIDLY LICENSED COPY OF ANY VERSION OR EDITION
OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 98, MILLENNIUM EDITION, WINDOWS NT 4.0, WINDOWS 2000 OR
ANY MICROSOFT OPERATING SYSTEM THAT IS A SUCCESSOR TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING
OPERATING SYSTEMS (EACH AN "OS PRODUCT"), YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO INSTALL,
COPY OR OTHERWISE USE THE OS COMPONENTS AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS UNDER THIS
SUPPLEMENTAL EULA.

That snippet is from 6.0 (5.01 has something similar, see the IEs4Linux
site). 7.0 is not relevant since IEs4Linux does not work with it yet. And
Vista licensing is a black-hole of weirdness altogether - and basically you
can't legally run windows at all if you adhere to it!

You only need a valid EULA in order to use the component(s) of the system.
You are in NO WAY bound to use the OS in its entirety to run any part of the
system. The reasons for this legalese are well established, so again, not
worth really bringing up in this forum.

It is not the place of the ILUGC, the FSF or any other body to stifle
knowledge under the dubious guise of discouraging "illegal things". It is
the place of the individual party to make the decision on whether things are
illegal or not - and this is by reading the EULA carefully for their
location. You may point out to them that this MAY be illegal in your
jurisdiction. It is absolutely insane to suggest that posting something
"encourages" illegal behavior!

Please refrain from curbing free speech.
<rant>
And PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not encourage us to read mind-numbing stupidity
like Microsoft's EULA - it's a monumental waste of time, and does not help
the LUG community in any way at all whatsoever
</rant>

enjoy

P.S. This is not flame-bait. I'm happy to debate this off-forum, provided
it's with some coffee and a samosa :)

Subject: [Ilugc] booting  problem
Message-ID: <20080305120450.GA21088@mrna.tn.nic.in>

Hi all,

I have a debian OS (x86) on an IDE-HDD with / partition mapped on /dev/hda2 and with boot flag set.
Now i am shifting this disk to a new system with better hardware (memory,core2duo) and BIOS too which has support for SATA and IDE disks. Right it doesnt have any SATA drive fixed this disk with debian OS. Now it doesnt recognize the boot parition on the IDE-HDD i suppose, and is stuck with error:
"No bootable device, insert boot disk and press any key"

But when I boot off the GnuParted Live rescue CD, it gives me an option at grub menu to boot from the MBR it found after scanning. if i choose that option, it OS boots fine.

can someone tell me whats going on and what could be the fix ? 

regards,
KM

There are many possibilities and is a tad hard to predict what is going
wrong.

What I normally do is boot the Debian rescue CD and load the kernel and
reinstall grub. That worked for me (TM).

But you will have to fight with it till it works.

People say that you need CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) and a bunch
of other drivers. I think you need to install apsfilter(1) software.

But I have printed with just LPRng. Too bad the project is apparently
defunct now.

It was a long time ago and I used to test for LPD on TCP 515 with 

$ nc -v <PRINTERIP> 515

and you could use 

$ export PRINTER=lp@<PRINTERIP>

$ a2ps <input-file> -o foo.ps

$ lpr foo.ps

and things used to work.

But a lot of water has flown under the bridge since then.

So my above description may not help you (much).

The above message looks like it is from bios and not from grub.
Please check in your bios if ide-disk is part of the bootable devices.

Normally cups has a generic 24pin dotmatrix driver under epson manufacturer.
This works with all such printers

Thanks but the "computer" wala only understands brand/model and as for 
drivers "it is on the CD sir."  I'll get a blank stare if I ask him for 
a webcam compatible with *spca5xx drivers* :)

Defining a raid array with all partitions on one hard disk is OK if you 
are doing this for learning purpose but *not* for a production system.

Did you create the raid array manually or use some GUI tool?  Pls. name 
the tool.

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                This is the problem.  

You need to create this file (refer man mdadm.conf). It is in /etc dir 
structure.

The notion has changed from hda to sda in the recent versions. That could be
one problem else you are not connecting the hard disk as slave of Primary
IDE controller.

Please inform the result if you are successful

What is stopping you from creating one manually?  See man mdadm.conf - 
there is an example in the man page that you can copy and modify for 
your setup.

Try changing your first boot device to IDE harddisk (IDE1 ?). This
should be a problem of
not having the correct bootable device in BIOS.

   Sorry, i have missed earlier threads. If it is 2.6 kernel based, the file
   is not compulsory.

   You need to create the file only for some specialized situations like for
   ex sharing spare drives  among different arrays, etc.

Look for the list of model numbers at

I have described the compilation method in my blog... But it wasn't
reqd. for me to compile those things again after I moved to newer

It is rather pointless but still.

I have got two models that I bought working very well with the gspca
driver.

You can download the gspca driver from

http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca5xx.html

and simply run

./gspca_build

After that it crated the video? devices for me.

Then just fire up xawtv or gqcam.

I have two models that I bought and both work.

They are 

a) Logitech quickcam express USB dev ID 046d:0928)

b) Zebronics USB dev ID 0ac8:305b)

The Logitech is the better one of course.

Hope this helps in a small way.

I also had got gyachi to do yahoo! chat with webcam long ago.

It will be good if people who know Perl well attend it as well.

That way we can all learn together and have fun.

Why do you need to prove it?


1)  Perhaps you can demonstrate the skills you gain from the training.
     if certificate or paper proof is what is sought, may be this is
not for you.

2)  may be you can take pictures, video to prove your presence in the
training :-)

Well I dunno what to say.

Look at it this way.

"Work is its own reward"

or something like

"Joy of learning"

Beyond that I too am as doubtful as you how this training will help.

Let us try to make it entertaining with humor. 

That way at least we can have a nice afternoon. That is all I can
promise.

Dear Sir,
this is ganesh,
i sugest that you need to check the DVD rom and HDD configuration, because your motherboard may not have 2 IDE ports, you need to set the HDD as master and DVD rom as Slave 

thankyou,
Best Regards

Hi,

Greetings to all. This is my first post although I have been part of the
group for a few years now.

I am running gentoo (kde) on a thinkpad (t61p) and am not able to get any
output when connected to an LCD projector. I am able to get output on the
screen right until kdm starts after which the display switches to my laptop
display. I have tried the including twinview in my xorg.conf (I don't know
if that is the right thing to do) but it still did not work. I have attached
my xorg.conf.

One more question : How does one check or know if a key is working or not?.
I have thinkpad acpi built into the kernel but none of the function keys
combinations are working. I am suspecting that the fn key is dead or not
activated, so what can I do to solve this?

Some more info...
Kernel : 2.6.23-gentoo-r3
Graphics Card : Nvidia Quadro FX 570m

If you need more info  just let me know.

Thanks,
Naresh

\--

1. You have different options for "Display" in your BIOS settings. Not
sure which one is currently set, but, you can try different options.

2. You can also try "noacpi" in the kernel command line before booting.

It should be Fn+F4 for switching between displays.

In the original xorg.conf file, just change Device section like this.

Section "Device"
         Identifier "NVIDIA Quadro FX 570M"
         Driver     "nvidia"
         BusID      "PCI:0:2:0"
         Option     "MonitorLayout" "NONE,LFP+CRT"
         Option     "DevicePresence" "true"
         Option     "CheckLid" "false"
         VendorName "Lenovo"
         BoardName  "NVIDIA Quadro FX 570M"
EndSection

Yday only I configured in R60. It is working fine. The only issues is 
the Ext VGA is always on. I need to tweak it work with Fn+F7 key.

Bye :)

If anyone wants a 7.10 CD (Gutsy) for any platform and are showing up to the
Perl Training Session tomorrow or Sunday, please send me a note, and I'll
make sure there are enough available. Ideally if you bring a blank CD you
can just burn the image while you're at the session (or we can do a CD swap
:) ).

Vijay, feel free to stop by the sessions and I'll give you a Ubuntu CD.

enjoy

<sidetrack>

If you wish to figure out if a key is dead, try using the 
xev(1) program under Xwindow.

My experience working on keyboards all day usually wipes out the
keyboard letters and some keys lose their hysteresis (I hope this word
is correct), but keys don't go dead.

I know there is some difficult procedure to get the multimedia keys
working under linux even in case xev(1) does not report anything. 

Even that is possible but never tried.

I wrote to the HP Linux Desktop support team and they replied to me
that, I will loose the support for the OS and the warrenty on items
that gets dammaged (?!) due to installing any other OS. But they also
went on to say that Ubuntu supports their desktops but they dont
endorse that. This was a huge U turn from what the sales support guy
first told me. I then placed an order for the Laptop and I got the
same re-assurance that I loose support only for the OS.


DELL has fallen out of favour over here. Mainly because of poor
quality service and bad customer support. A collegue of mine reported
that he ordered a Keyboard and got an Anti Virus software delevered to
him.

Apple's Lepord's installer has an option to any new OS on their
computers and repartition their harddisks. They were happy to support
it, but the price of their hardware was too expensive for me.

Acer and Toshibha did not have a customizable version atleast here in
the US. All were pre-built models.

I just thought I would share the info with the group if some would
find it useful :-)

Cheers,
Natarajan

I assume it has been almost over a month now and updates to kde.in were

But here it comes, presenting the next FreeIndian: Kartik Mistry.

Our current interview features the Gujarati Geek (alliteration

well as packaging applications for it. Interestingly, he started with 
Redhat 7.0 in his early days of computing with FOSS and has now become

Precisely, here is a quote from the OP.

<quote>
i have created a raid array /dev/md0 that has 2 active devices 
( /dev/sda10 and /dev/sda11)and 1 spare device (/dev/sda12)
</quote>

Interestingly, ananconda installer (CentOS 5.0) did 
create /etc/mdadm.conf in my case even though I do not have any "spare" 
drives for the "three" raid devices.

Friends.

Today, Girish gave a nice training session on perl.
More than 40 persons attended the session.

Day One session was introductory.
Hands on Sessions added sweet to the theory.

People gave a lot of feedback.
Then, Bharathi gave an introduction to Chennai LUG to new comers.

Thanks for Mr.Sundar Raman for the wonderful place and Tea.

Sunday, is the Second day of the session.

Ok, so I finally fixed it. Apparently some SCIM tool or something was
setting Shift+Space and Ctrl+Space as a keyboard shortcut (for
something that I still haven't understood). Getting rid of that
shortcut from System->Preferences->SCIM Input Method Preferences fixes
it.

on Sundays.
 
We are currently training the teacher, Kalapana and two other students
mani and prabhu who are very keen to learn. They in turn teach the
others.

months.
 
TIMINGS
----------
You can meet us in the center Mon , Wed, Fri : 6.30 to 9.00 p.m and
Sunday : 2.00 p.m-6.p.m. Other days there will be regular classes.
 
LANGAUGE NOT  A CONSTRAINT : Pulkit experience
-------------------------------------------------
Oh the other good thing is that Pulkit did his first class on friday .
He is basically from Gujrat and we ha d the fear that language might be
a  constraint. We gave it a shot. He tried with English and it seems to
work to a large extent.
 
 
Things needed:
----------------
 
HARDWARE REPAIR
------------------
1) We need some one with hardware repair skills to troubleshoot the 2
comps which have some issues. If you know a commercial computer hardware
engineer who can help thats also good. 
 
COMPUTER  NEEDED
-----------------
2) After March the exams will be over. Then it might be  good to have
another comp and UPS. We have a promise for the UPS already. We need a
computer
 
BOOKS NEEDED
----------------
3) Good Computer Basics books : if some one who knows kannada can go to
some place like Swapna book store and get a set of good computer books.
Not hi fi ones but basic books. In tamil there is a book on how a
computer works and internet by Sujatha who just passed away. Such books
make a interesting read an are ver helpful to the students in quality
improvement. However any book is good. Especially ones which suggest a
lot of practical things for the student to try.
 
Also books in English are good.
 
Visit 
 
http://slumdweller.wikispaces.com/Curriculum
<http://slumdweller.wikispaces.com/Curriculum> 
 
for the topics on which you should buy books.
 

GNU LINUX Currciulum 
----------------------------------
 
You know that we use the skill set exercise model developed by AID
Chennai .
 
We would like to have the GNU/LINUX curriculum equivalent of the skill
set model. This is not very difficult and for a good GNU-LINUX person it
might take less than a day to develop.

Great going, guys.

Just a suggestion: how about replacing slumdweller with something like
'underprivileged' ! The term slumdweller might have a negative
connotation in some circles.

Message-ID: <7bf1bec50803100510r2d046f0enea08778b7161f0c1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

This is a link to an article that talks about a patent application for
software (one that sends emails!! with, I think,  a workflow thrown
in)

http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/ew/2008/03/10/stories/2008031050120300.htm

The patent office is yet to grant him patent though and a search for
atr/authentic track record at patentinfo.nic.in did not return
anything relevant. But the atr site seems quite professional. Leaving
aside the feasibility of the venture... can any one think up what is
patentable here?

I have sent them a request for the same. Will keep you posted.

regds,
mano

Message-ID: <fad10ddf0803100802l5bdd4928jd8eed1bbbc542ce9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ILUG'ers,
I wanted to put out a public thanks for all of you who attended the Perl
Programming sessions on Saturday and Sunday. We'll be continuing with them
this coming Sat/Sun (15,16 March).

Perl is a difficult language to teach due to its raw power. It can be used
for everything from writing an Operating System (
http://www.foo.be/docs/tpj/issues/vol5_2/tpj0502-0009.html) to writing
simple web pages to writing extremely complex and rich web-enabled
application frameworks. It is, as Girish pointed out, the duct-tape
language. We found out on Saturday that "duct-tape" does not translate well
to the Indian idioma. So let's call it the Fevicol-and-rope language (coz I
can't think of a good equivalent to duct-tape here!).
Need to build a house? All you need is a large enough vat of fevicol and
some rope.
Need to build a massive application that's web-enabled, runs on any
operating system, and can be hacked together in a weekend? Use Perl.

To try to teach Perl to an audience of C-programmers, students, general
computer users, and those with even a peripheral interest, all at the same
time, was ambitious and yet I think everyone benefited.

Girish has been a great instructor, and took a lot of feedback (and some
pretty vocal criticism) on Saturday and Sunday about how he had framed the
classes, and what he was trying to accomplish. I would like to thank Girish
in public for the work he has done for this presentation, and also his
graciousness in adapting his presentation to the needs of the audience.
Sunday was, by all accounts, a more educational and perl-focused session
than Saturday.

And I'm *really* looking forward to next weekend's sessions since Girish is
planning on making them even more interactive and interesting.

See all you Perl-hackers next Saturday and Sunday.

enjoy

If only Colleges around here had a 5 day week instead of six. :(
Just curious, will you be concentrating on something specific with perl
this weekend?

Seems businesses are the same way - I'll be working on Saturday while the
class is going on. Fortunately the class will be at my place of work :)

Many things specific with perl :) Seriously tho' I believe Girish intends to
focus on Perl modules, Web programming and OO. It's a lot for 2 days, but it
should be good I think.

One thing you could try - invoke the function more times, and average.
Perhaps the function is not clocking enough time to make an appreciable
impact. Just maybe...

Hello,
from my understanding the sampling time is about .01 seconds, i tried in
vain of how to increase  the sampling rate, so if you have very less
functions and less number of calls, then the result will mostly be 0.0 only,
try writing a resursively calling function(fibonacci say example) and try
profiling

I barely remember using gprof.

I have found the simple shell command time(1) to be far more easier to
use and helpful.

I remember gprof reporting huge amounts of data. How did you get just
one line?

There are plenty of profiling/monitoring tools in linux.

Why don't you try the other ones?

lsof(1), fstat(1) and so on.

I think you can simply

$ time ./a.out

for your immediate need.

As to why gprof results weird results, the answer might be far deeper
than what meets the eye.

As someone suggested you can try a few iterations.

Hello
from what i understand, gprof is not just about timing.. its just one aspect
of it... its more about how many times a function is called and from where
is is called..[call graphs], its very useful in analysing and verifying your
program

We have a product which hit some performance issues in some scenarios and I 
would like to trobleshoot the performance. Since I didnt get the correct 
gprof output, I wrote a simple program to see if profiling works. I dont 
think time(1) will help here.

I have not used fstat and I dont think lsof will help for my requirement. 
And I am now more focused why gprof is not giving the time spent data.

My simple program has a function which spends atleast 2 seconds. Initially I 
have used sleep and replaced them with "for" loops containg simple 
calculations to ensure that they atleast spend two seconds.

Some of the internet documents mentioned about linking with libc_p instead 
of libc, but I could not find such library.


Thank you so much for your reply.

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0803130653l420d3059yeede812dde520431@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

We use mnogosearch to setup a php based search engine.

To setup everything, we have to compile everything.

PHP, mnogosearch, mnogosearch-php. should be complied from source.

But, we need the deb packages for ubuntu.

PHP and mnogosearch are available.
except, mnogosearch-php.

how to get it as deb package?
can we ask the ubuntu developers?

here is the compilation how-to.
http://www.mnogosearch.org/board/message.php?id=19573

how to make it as ubuntu package?

Thanks.

Long long ago I used the time(1) command to figure out that an
encryption algorithm was spending far more time than before. Later it
turned out that the optimization flags were not enabled in the C
compiler.

Sorry it doesn't help you.

Can you explain what you mean by "performance issues in some scenarios"?

Is it a networking program? 

Have you measured network latency?

Performance enhancement can be performed without resorting to profiling. 

If your idea is to identify bottlenecks, then a simple strace can help
as well.

It will print out the system calls whereby you can know which system
call is invoked often.

But I understand it cannot catch all cases.

Usually protocols are not optimal/efficient and a simple rewrite can
help.

The bottlenecks typically are in inefficient file I/O, network I/O, too
many context switches(system calls) or if it is a threaded program, a lot of time
could be lost in waiting for locks.

Unless you give more details about the product we cannot proceed
further.

I don't think standard libraries will have bottlenecks. 

Perhaps you can throw some light on what your product does.

If your company does not permit disclosure, then some general idea would
do.

Thanks.

My guess is you got to make one .. or compile it from source.  If you create
a deb package please make it public.. so others can use.

I want to remap the filename, which is received from tftp client, like
this from foofileX to foo/fileX and from barfileX to bar/fileX.

Basically I want keep the actual file location in my control. So that
client don't need to worry or know about file path.

Bye :)

So I could not make out what finally worked. Moreover the same setup

Looking forward to some help..

here is the procedure to connect this modem to

internet (Open Suse 10.2)

1. Insert the Modem in USB port (USB drive is loaded and modem is recognized)
2. run wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf to create the configuration script.
3. Edit the script to :
[Dialer Defaults]
Modem = /dev/ttyACM0
Baud = 460800
Init1 = ATZ
Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
Init3 = AT+CRM=1
ISDN = 0
Modem Type = Analog Modem
Phone = #777
Username = internet
Password = internet
stupid mode =1
4. type wvdial

and start browsing. The speed is pretty good.

what i guess is that you are able to connect to the net using wvdial
command. you'll get some messages on the terminal such as local ip,
remote ip & dns1 etc. but u r not able to browse the internet. this
happens when ur routing is not proper. check your routing table

route -n

the last line should be something like
0.0.0.0         ur gatewayip     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0
ppp0

if not change the gateway manually to the remote ip that u got & it
should work. also check whether ur dns servers get updated to the tata
dns servers

cat /etc/resolv.conf

First check the cable, if it is OK. Otherwise, looks like your hard 
drive is gone.

Hi Sivakumar,

I followed your set of instructions, but the results have not changed. 
Anyway thanks for responding.

Hi krazy,

The modem is indeed 'plug to surf whiz model'.
 
The $route -n output and ping output are given below. The $cat 
/etc/resolv.conf  output is already pasted in dpaste 
(http://dpaste.com/hold/39252/ ).

You had suggested to change the gateway manually. Can you please tell me 
how to do it.

Thanks in advance
Regards Ganesh

Message-ID: <9b6118520803140319t1608a47et105ea3dc05fcaab5@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,
   In one of my system when I try to set or get the hwclock it throws me an
error

        select() to /dev/rtc to wait for clock tick timed out

   So the system is not getting synchronised from the BIOS.

   I added the parameters in /etc/default/rcS  and the parameter is as
follows

HWCLOCKPARS=--directisa

    And also I set the UTC to no


   Now during the bootup it is not throwing any error.    But then we are
not able to set the hwclock to system clock  manually.   If we want to set
it manually we have to unload the rtc and load the genrtc.


    Is there any way of loading the genrtc module instead of rtc ?


Thanks in advance .

From the route output posted, it appears you are connecting to the 'Net.

see "man route" and read the section for default route.  The IP# on your 
ppp0 iface should be the gw.

Strange, your ISP is assigning a private IP number on your ppp0 
interface.  Who is your ISP?  Nonetheless as long as your traffic is 
outbound only, it should work once you change your routing table (see 
above).

Your default route is hosed up (see above).  It should be ppp0 and not 
eth0.

Such errors are usually the precursor of impending failure.  Suggest 
backup of your critical data before the next reboot of your system.

BTW, last week I had a file system failure on a Maxtor 160GB disk due 
bad sectors.  I got no warnings at all, luckily I had backed up the 
critical files to another disk.  After reformatting, the disk is 
working fine but am I going to trust it? No.

your default gateway is messed up. *
*

*0.0.0.0              192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0                 UG
0      0        0 eth0

*this line is telling the system to access the internet using the ethernet card, but you are connecting to the internet using ppp0, in this case  172.23.129.14   0.0.0.0            255.255.255.255 UH    0      0
0 ppp0

what you need to do is 

route del default gw **192.168.0.1

**route add default gw 172.23.129.14 (ppp0 ip)
in this case.

krazy.

Hi krazy,

Your suggestion worked. I was able to browse the net, but suddenly 
"Google dropped connection". When I check $route the default route had 
vanished. When I added it again, net connection started working again. 
Thanks for the info.

Now, do I have to do this every time I fire-up wvdial or is there a way 
to do this at system start-up?

Thanks in advance

Regards Ganesh

because you have a static route set in ur routing table for the lan,
when u connect using wvdial it's not able to change the routing table.
there are two options.
1. disconnect ur ethernet cable(manually) or from command line (ifdown
eth0)  & then run wvdial. it should automatically set the routing table
for you.
or
2. delete the static route (default gateway) from ur routing table &
then run wvdial.

having both lan & usb connected at the same time is possible but u need
read about managing the routing table if you want to be on the lan &
browse the net using usb modem.

Message-ID: <809586140803151023o239fdd25ve44528b8ccea1881@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have installed Centos 5 and shared my remote desktop in Gnome. I am
unable to get clipboard functionality.

I know that it uses vino VNC server, but I need to know whether it
supports clipboard.

What is xvnc and how is that different from vino?

Does xvnc supports clipboard functionality (I need to copy between
Windows and Eclipse on linux and vice versa and not with a X app)

Please help me out.

Thanks,

Hi krazy,

Thanks for the response. The straight forward way (changing wvdial.conf 
and then doing wvdial) works well on my laptop with Linux-Mint as well 
as Debian Etch. I keep my laptop connected to lan when I use this modem 
with Linux-Mint (not tried with Debian though). I don't understand why 
this should behave differently on different hardware.

Anyway thanks once again. I'll do the further research.

Regards Ganesh

We have a project in "KARAIKAL TSUNAMI ASHRAM" based
5-6hrs from Chennai to setup a computer lab.

For this I am looking into setting up a Edubuntu class
server with 6 thin clients. I need help in finding a
local vendor that can supply us the hardware and help
set it up. The spec is a entry level server (AMD
AthlonX2/Intel Core 2, 2GB RAM..) with 6 AMD
Sempron/Celeron machines with 512KB RAM. Does someone
have a good reference that I can use ?

Also anyone intrested in helping to setup the lab,
please contact me.

Hi Sanjeev,

I would love  if I could to be of any help to you folks  setting up the 
lab. I work as a Ops Engineer, managing IT in my firm.

 From what I understand, you are looking for a high end desktop grade 
machine to set up as a server.
I could forward you contacts for the local vendors we buy the machines 
from, and try to get a good bargain as well.
Are you interested in buying brandaed machines, or just assembled ones?


Also, if you would like my help, could you let me know the schedule  for 
deploying this, so that I could confirm my availability.

Thanks & Regards,

How about just using ltsp over thin clients? That might drastically
lower the cost of hardware ( thereby, perhaps, giving you more money to
spend on related infrastructure )

While this does not answer your question directly, you might find that
using NX/FreeNX would give you all the functionality you need, including
copy buffer sharing beween local and remote machines. There are fairly
comprehensive details on howto setup freenx on centos4/5 in the centos
wiki ( wiki.centos.org )

Subject: [Ilugc] Many thanks to Exeter and Sundar for Perl training
Message-ID: <20080316144644.GA20546@saraswathy.madambakam.org>

Dear all,

When I first saw an e-mail from Sundar Raman at 4:30 am little did I
realize that it was going to work out.

But after interacting with him closely for a while I consider myself
highly fortunate and blessed to have known such a well traveled, cool,
socially committed and above all technically focused individual.

It would have been quite hard to conduct my perl training without the
amazing facilities provided by Exteter Premedia Services Pvt. Ltd right
at the heart of Chennai in Teynampet.

I have never seen an Apple  computer in my life properly ( Only from a
distance). And Sundar arranged 4 of them for the demo. And the hall had
all facilities including air conditioning.

I would like to emphasize here that Sundar Raman and his company Exeter
are highly committed to providing training facilities free of cost for
any technical topic. I encourage more and people to come forward and
utilize this facility.

It is also interesting that Sundar is a Telecom pro and that he has
tremendous real life experience writing Telecom standards, playing with
GSM, CDMA, UMTS and God only knows what. He knows nearly all of
wireless, mathematics, telephony, mobile communications, VoIP and so
on...

Moreover he is also a brilliant presenter since he has the skill to
delineate any hard concept in a manner that is digestible to any kind of
audience.

If I had known his erudition, experience and teaching skill we could
have benefited from his knowledge much better. Anyway even now it is not
too late.

It will be great indeed if we can arrange a training on telecom by
Sundar before he goes back to USA on April 1.

Any takers?

The location of the company is a great plus since it is close to Anna
Salai and Alwarpet.

I also wish to apologize in public for the mess up that happened on day
I. Perhaps the snaps do not show reality. ;)

"Kannal kanpathum poi, kaadhal ketpathum poi,
 Theera visarippathe mei. "

So goes the wonderful Tirukkural. So this is what happened on day I. The
snaps do not convey what really happened. Close to 65 people came for
the session but nearly half of them left after the tea break. And I
wholly take the blame for that. I would do the same thing if I went to a
movie that did not interest me. 

Overall it was a great learning experience for me.

Day III (yday) was an amazing day. Sundar Raman gave us some really
excellent narrative about CAPTCHAs and how they are subverted.

Overall it was great fun since it was a closely knit group of really
passionate guys interested in learning and having fun.

I am committed to providing world class training in future and here is a
promise.

Henceforth all my presentations will be accompanied by an on the fly
demo. I am sure that is the only way to tackle any technical topic. Mere
theory is useless unless people know how to apply it in the real world.

I shall definitely ensure that every single talk I give in future will
be accompanied by demos interspersed with the talk.

Thanks.

>From Ubuntu, i only get 8-10 kbps speed. Today, one guy of my ISP came with

What`s the reason?

2 MBps connection should give anyone around 200Kbps download. if he is
getting 15-20 Kbps only then there is some problem with the connection

Hi All,
I have Fc 6 on a HP Pavllion dv 6000. I am able to
listen to music on the built in speakers.The
inbuilt mic doesn't work and when connecting
external speakers I don't get the sound on the
external speakers  thought my built in speakers
continue to work. After searching on the internet,
came to  know I had to upgrade alsa drivers. I
downloaded the latest version and  alsa-drivers
and als-libs and did as mentioned in the README.
But  /proc/asound/version still shows me the old
version. What have I missed ? Do I need to 
recompile the kernel ?

I too have got a HP dv6000 series laptop. I was about to install
Ubuntu on it. But, I can't hear any sound at all from the PC (Neither
inbuilt nor external).  So, I have put the installation on hold for
sometime.
I was trying with Kubuntu 7.10 live CD. and yes, I couldn't get the
wifi working either nor the webcam.. I have to do a lot of googling
around before I can start installing I guess.

Cool.  The latest version is dated oct/2004.  IIRC, OP has a SAS (serial 
attached scsi) controller.  Hope it is has the drivers for it.

Awesome if you can help out. The funding is approved
and the donor (he is a New York mutual fund manager)
is used to fast execution.

Need to get the plan in place and then we can start.
>From prev experience it usually takes next 6 months to
complete the project.

Our first priority is to get a cost estimate to the
donor for the machines. For this we should get
estimates from both branded pc like HCL and unbranded.
If difference is small (say upto 10%)  then I would
prefer branded.


Please feel free to give my email id to the vendors.

Though the advice was definitely good no doubt, if things are going
wrong at the kernel TCP level then nothing in userland can change that.

One thing you can try is this.

# sysctl net.inet.tcp.sendspace=65535
# sysctl net.inet.tcp.recvspace=65535

If this works you are very lucky.

I know for sure this impacts the bandwidth delay product directly and
that you can get *huge* performance improvements in bandwidth provided;
provided of course you have real wire bandwidth and there are no other
overheads/bottlenecks.

As always there is a legal clause - ceteris paribus.

Anyway please do not hold me on this since it is only an experiment.

If this does not work then perhaps I can come up with other ideas.

And most importantly I want you to try this.

$ cd /tmp

$ wget ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.8a.tar.gz

instead of firefox.

Bandwidth "guessing" works like a pendulum. It sways both ways till it
arrives at a reasonable guess and this you can know only when the
pendulum settles at the middle.

So wait for a few seconds and once the dust settles note down the
bandwidth.

Try it and get back.

Just run "vncconfig -nowin &" and try it out.

If it works, add this line at the end of xstartup file.

 From my experience I would certainly recommend using branded ones, 
unless price is a big constraint, reasons being manyfold. We use mix of 
both kinds here , and I am highly satisfied with the branded ones in 
terms of quality, reliability,  service etc.
We use branded dell machines and assembled PCs from local vendors.  As 
you might already be aware, dell offers competitive prices.

For high end desktops, the price difference was less than  5K, and I am 
positive, for low ends, its going to be narrower.  Let me get you  both 
quotes, and then you could make a decision. 

I am forwarding your email id to a couple of vendors, and you could take 
it from there. Feel free to get in touch with me if you need any help on 
this project.

I just looked into edubuntu servers. It is infact a LTSP deployment 
comes with edubuntu . 
here is a useful resource abt edubuntu+ltsp+thin clients
http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/linux_terminal_server

 snip

"..........Because the LTSP scripts can be a hassle for a novice, the 
folks who made Edubuntu (Ubuntu plus a few packages and configurations 
for schools) put in automatic installation of the simplest, and most 
common setup, the server running a private LAN with your clients. This 
works well for a classroom, a computer lab, an office or a small 
school..........."


As you said, thin clients would be ideal for this setup.

We at Proto.inhave been realizing the need for startups who are looking for talent tohire. In most cases, it does seem like there is just a simple need toconnect folks with the right  people; Startups and the people who areinterested in hiring.

I've setup a simple template at http://startuplunch .proto.inwhich should explain the process. It's quite simple. If you are astartup, put down your name, and the company info. And if you aresomeone looking to join a startup, jot down your name, meet over lunchand see if your interests match up.

Feel free to create anew wiki/site should you find the need and just link it up to thesection under your city so that people can follow. There are already quite a few startups which are listed. Feel free to add your name under the suitable category.

Let me know.

I have the same one. Sound worked out of the box when I installed ubuntu and
I've also tried with Fedora 8. Without the xen kernel sound has no problem
with Fedora 8 too.

The thing I like about thinclients in situations like these is that you
dont need to manage / maintain them at all - just turn them on and they
are good to go, you only need to maintain and manage the main server (
and pretty much any decent'ish machine that is less than 2 years old
should be able to run 6 thin clients with no issues )

btw, someone mentioned thin clients at  Rs.7,500/- a few months back on
the ilug-delhi list.

Is this a trick question? :)

You didn't specify POP or IMAP.  

For a GUI environment:

1. IMAP only, I would wager the web browser, open standards based, as 
the most versatile MUA.  Many service providers have integrated email 
and other features into the UI within the browser.  Being server based, 
adding features is easier. 

2. IMAP/POP - on the Linux desktop, I use Kontact (KMail plus more).  It 
has all the features I need including RSS feeds.

On the Linux console, mutt.

IIRC, it was imported from Thailand and there is no support available in 
India.

The VXL Itona thin clients (India) cost about the same as an entry level 
(diskless) Celeron/Sempron PC.  Besides, the PC can be upgraded with 
more RAM or a hard disk if need be.

This question is not a good one. But my choice is Mutt. Extensive
customizability, lightning speed, nice colours, niceties such as
dynamic signatures etc., GPG support are a few features I like.

Emacs fans may also like RMail, VM, Gnus.

Anyway, you can RTFM about each of these. I don't wish to participate
further in this flame baiter.

How do you read mail with it? 

Any tips?

Very interesting reply though.

Very verwy geeky. ;)

Have you really done it?

I am sure it can get painful.

I was actually looking for a more formal answer.

I dunno why but whenever I think of e-mail I forget the web browser. But
most people are comfortable with it I guess.

Great. I guess it would be true of any non web based client.

I always use plaintext e-mails. In fact everyone should use only

Isn't it enough to look at the URL?

Anyway this seems to be useful.

Oh I never see them. Very few keys to remember, so I just type away.

When in doubt, isn't it just enough to type the 'h' key for help?

I personally have been able to do an amazing array of things with e-mail
only and only because of mutt.

Of course, there is procmail and the general UNIX philosophy thrown in
but mutt's regex and coloring features help me to stay focused.

mutt's search facility based on date ranges, sizes, header fields and
what not, it's ability to tag messages and attach multiple files or
mails in a seamless way all speak of real genius of Michael Elkins.

Even when one is really unable to focus/concentrate, mutt shows clear
markers to show if the mail is addressed to you alone, belonging to a
list and so on.

It helps you avoid the problems with GUI mail clients. That of too much
 on the screen and too many icons/pictures that distract you. Mutt helps
you stay focused. Since it is very easy to go wrong with e-mail sending,
mutt is even more important.

The most useful feature IMHO is the ability to reply to lists with the L
key instead of copying the list and sending to the respondent. Is this
feature supported in any other mail client?

Another great feature is the ability to delete all the mails in a
particular thread with 'D' once you sort based on threads.

IOW, mutt has really changed the way I look at email. Forever...

Another thing. You can easily send attachments from the command line
with it. You can use it with simple shell scripts to do certain amazing
things.

I am sure I left some of the really cool stuff.

I think there is nmh which is also quite powerful. And perhaps nail?

Any of you guys use them?

Another thing is that mutt is limited to text mailing alone. You can
read and send html mails with it.

And you can view pictures from Xwindow by binding it with the
appropriate 'qiv', 'xloadimage' or whatever image viewer program.

Thanks.

You should read the whole story if you get the time.

No, I am not giving the URL. ;)

But definitely Outlook has certain user friendly features that are
outstanding.

This is awesome. I've been waiting for someone to create the PDF coz i'm
sick of doing the HTML scanning thing, and this is *very* useful to me.
(yes, i'm a lazy bastard who just uses everyone - and that's *really* why i
love open source :) ).

Thanks much.

Damn. ;)

It is so **** simple. 

$ htmldoc -f freebsd-handbook.pdf \
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/book.html

You can create a PDF from any html file or URL this way.

Didn't know life was that simple eh?

i am talking abt microsoft outlook 2007/opera.
1. well integrated calendering system for business needs which i feel is
lacking in evolution. if evolution does that and gives me windows version, i
would switch to it. thunderbird is still not good with calendering.
2. Inbox search is not as good as thunderbird. but if used with windows
desktop search, it works well
3. filter Rules is still stored in exchange server rather than client. so
even if my local client crashes, i can still use existing settings which is
not the case of evolution/thunderbird
4. some of the features of opera i like i.e automatic grouping of emails by
mailing list etc
5. sent items is stored locally i guess in evolution/thunderbird. but in
outlook it is stored in server.

PS: i have used evolution/thunderbird/outlook express/microsoft outlook in
my workspace

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Forwarded, from an Indian KDE contributor.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi,

      Its time for Google Summer of Code '08. Many of you are already
following it. But just a reminder and a friendly poke incase you
forgot all about it.

      Of course, KDE will be there like previous years.  Check [1] for
more details.

       As a student, all you need is some enthusiasm, willingness to
contribute to KDE and Free Software in general. Knowledge of C++ is
almost taken for granted in KDE GSoC. Knowledge of Qt/KDE/PyQt
framework and programming is a definite ( huge ) plus. If you are
already a contributing code to some KDE application, firstly you r0ck,
nextly you did yourself a huge favour and have HUGE PLUS-PLUS :). It
also works if you have been sending in patches regularly. So if you
are one of them, DO submit a proposal.

      There is a nice *idea* page on the KDE techbase page [2]. Feel
free to browse through that and find something that you like or you
might be able to pull off. *Strong recommendation* - Please be
creative and write your own project proposal. Nothing impresses
mentors more than your own enthusiasm to do something uber cool for
the project. It is million times better if you write your own project
proposal - may be even your own idea that is not there in the idea
page which you think might be a cool feature / addition to KDE -
instead of copying something from the idea page. Its a idea page after
all and not a proposal template page ;).  Please read [3] about
certain instructions of participations in KDE GSoC. I repeat, please
read [3] before applying. It is very detailed and will mostly answer a
lot of your questions and will help you frame your proposal in much
better way.

        Last  year KDE GSoC participation [4] [5] was really
wonderful. It got 40 projects sanctioned by Google which probably was
the largest allocation among all the participating projects. There
were 213 proposals submitted to Google and 40 were allocated. 3 of
those 40 students were Indians, you have ask them about their
experiences. I am very sure that they have good things to talk about
the same. Since I have met Piyush and Sharan many times in recent past
after the SoC '07, I know for sure that they ( and Anirrudh, the third
guy ) loved the whole experience and had a blast.

        Looking forward to your proposal.  Good luck.

Hi,

We are having a small level email marketing company for the past few years,
we used to mail to more than a lac of mails daily, we use Sendmail installed
in an empty serve with CentOS as OS, it performs like anything for this
capacity of mailing, we face no issues with the sendmail.

We tried with mail enable and a windows server but it never performs well
for a mailing of over 20k daily.

In my point of view Sendmail is the best

e-mail clients have nothing to do with MTAs. They are two different
things.

Again there is postfix and qmail that are also quite a big powerful.

exim is the only g*****e.

Actually there is no really free MTA that is also really secure. So if
you can write one that is really really good then I am sure many OSes
will pick it up.

People are frustrated with sendmail's poor history of security bugs and
complexity, postfix has licensing problems, qmail is in public domain
and is "weird".

People don't like public domain software.

There is a good opportunity. But writing an MTA is also really really
hard.

Anyway this article will put things in perspective.

you have a broad range of topics to be covered as per

The main reason for inclusion of such broad range of topics is that, at present the 
academic curriculum is entirely based on proprietary softwares. So it becomes necessary
to highlight all the equivalent apps (ex. of programming languages / development tools) in FOSS.

No. Neither we are looking for a full time trainer nor a single person to do the whole job.  Currently, we are 
preparing a wish list and based on the feedback we get from the LUG members, final decisions
will be made. (These programs are scheduled after June '2008 only).

Part time / weekend will be too difficult when focusing academic institutions.  But, we will surely
let you know when there is an option. (pl. send your complete contact address to our official e-mail ID

   Yes, since the awareness program is being conducted in various part of the
   state in Tamilnadu, the knowledge of Tamil language is so important to
   explain the FOSS concepts and also to interact with the academic
   community.

Hi,
I am working with HCL , Chennai and one of my
colleagues in a different project said that he needed
PHP developers (experienced). My-SQL and Apache
knowledge would be a plus.  Primary requirement is Php
and linux exposure.

If interested, please contact me with your resumes.

Thanks,
Sanjay

Dear Bharathi

The user file-creation mode mask (umask) is use to determine the file
permission for newly created files. It can be used to control the
default file permission for new files. It is a four-digit octal number
.

When a file is created, its permissions are set by default depending
on the umask setting. This value is usually set for all users in
/etc/profile and can be obtained by typing:

  $umask
    0022

Do step by step .

1).
create a file using touch(or vi filename,cat >filename)any file creation command

now list your file in the current directory using ls -l
for example my machine
$ls -l
total 28
drwxr-xr-x 3 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 15:32 Desktop
drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Documents
drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Music
-rw-rw-rw- 1 mohan mohan    0 2008-03-19 09:44 p1.c
drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Pictures
drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Public
drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Templates
drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Videos

now create a new file (hello.c)
$touch hello.c
now list current directory and see
$ls -l
total 28
drwxr-xr-x 3 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 15:32 Desktop
drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Documents
-rw-r--r-- 1 mohan mohan 0 2008-03-19 10:01 hello.c
drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Music
-rw-rw-rw- 1 mohan mohan    0 2008-03-19 09:44 p1.c

drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Videos

now see the umask value by typeing

$umask
    0022

if you use any file creation command to create a file it sets 0666 as
default permission for file.but i am created a new file hello.c its
permission is 0644 .the logic is


Default Permissions(vi,touch)              : 0666
Subtract umask value                          : 0022 (-)
Allowed Permissions:                            : 0644

so the touch command creates hello.c with 0644 permission.

2).
    now  set umask value
     $umask  0000

   now see the umask value by typing
   $umask
     0000
  now create another file say for example(hellotwo.c)
   $touch hellotwo.c



  now see the permission set by touch command to hellotwo.c  file

  $ls -l
drwxr-xr-x 3 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 15:32 Desktop
drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Documents
-rw-r--r-- 1 mohan mohan    0 2008-03-19 10:01 hello.c
-rw-rw-rw- 1 mohan mohan    0 2008-03-19 10:02 hellotwo.c
drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Music
-rw-rw-rw- 1 mohan mohan    0 2008-03-19 09:44 p1.c
drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Pictures
drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Public
drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Templates
drwxr-xr-x 2 mohan mohan 4096 2008-03-18 12:07 Videos

now compare the permission set by touch command for two files and
compare it permission.

Default Permissions(vi,touch)              : 0666
Subtract umask value                          : 0000 (-)
Allowed Permissions:                            : 0666

i think you will clear about umask value.

The default umask value is usually 0022. It is an octal number which
indicates what rights will be removed by default to all new files. For
instance, 0022 indicates that write permissions will not be given to
group and other.

By default, and with a umask of 0000, files get mode 0666 and
directories get mode 0777. As a result, with a default umask value of
0022, newly created files get a default mode 0644 (0666 - 0022 = 0644)
and directories get a default mode 0755 (0777 - 0022 = 0755).


if you not clear about this.please replay i will help you.

Hi,

He has clearly mentioned umask is not working with the core file.  I
vaguely remember seeing a kernel patch for controlling core file
permissions that is getting created, will try to dig that out. Guess
it means cores file permissions are taken care by kernel. Will revert
with more details and links.

regards,
siva.

Does it print diagnostice test page (using's it own buttons)?

Does the printer work with any other OS on the same systems?

FWIW check if it works with your friend's or the neighbourhood computer 
guy's desktop.

But, it requires a lot of dependency packages to be installed to convert from one format to the other (a lot of encoders and decoders has to be installed for this package to work)

The most popular players, encoders and decoders like lame, wavpack, mplayer, mpg123 can be downloaded from

http://rpm.livna.org

The base perl-audio-converter and other remaining dependency packages I have downloaded for Fedora-8 and made as a tar.gz file and this can be downloaded from

http://linuxbaskar.googlepages.com/perl-audio-converter.tar.gz

After installing all the required rpm packages, it works fine and I have converted all MP3 files in my harddisk to OGG format and now almost all default media players plays OGG files without requiring any additional audio codecs and it has additional plugins to integrate with amarok and other audio players for audio conversion.

Now, without worrying about proprietory audio codec formats, there is an easy way to convert your favourite music to freely available audio formats.

Subject: [Ilugc] DNS for Intranet - Setup Help required
Message-ID: <47E10B74.3050302@gmail.com>

Hi All,

Thanks for helping me with TATA - Indicom USB modem setup. I am back 
with another help request. I am trying to set-up a DNS for our intranet. 
We have following machines in our LAN :
* A linux server running Debian Etch (hostname : linux05, ip : 192.168.0.71)
* A Win NT-4 server (hostname : NTServer)
* About 15 Windows PCs (Win 98 & Win 2K)
* and a Linux Mint laptop (hostname : mg-laptop, ip : 192.168.0.104)

I am trying to configure a local domain pulsars.lan and resolve names 
like linux05.pulsars.lan, mg-laptop.pulsars.lan etc.
My configuration files are at
* /etc/bind/named.conf - http://dpaste.com/hold/40126/
* /etc/bind/named.conf.options - http://dpaste.com/hold/40127/
* /etc/bind/named.conf.local - a file with 5 lines of text but all 
commented out with //
* /etc/bind/db.pulsars.lan.hosts &
    /etc/bind/db.0.168.192.hosts  - http://dpaste.com/hold/40129/
* /etc/resolv.conf - two lines (search pulsars  nameserver  192.168.0.71)

When I do nslookup or dig for mg-laptop.pulsars.lan in the linux05 
machine itself, I get SERVFAIL only. However I am getting correct 
responses for localhost. (Server : 192.168.0.71, Address : 
192.168.0.71#53, Name : localhost, Address : 127.0.0.1)

I vaguely remember  giving the domain  name  as  pulsars.com  while  
setting  up the  debian  server  long  time  ago (about  six  months  
back).  Now  I am  not  able  to  find  out  where  that  information  
is  recorded.

What else  should  I  check? 

BTW I used webmin to do all this  setup.
 
Thanks in advance

Regards Ganesh

your domain is linux05.pulsars. or pulsars.lan?

Suggest a method for serial no. like YYYYMMDDxx eg. 2008031901 this not 
only gives you an idea when the file was updated but it is also an 
increasing no on the time scale.  If you are doing master/slave this is 
important for zone transfers.

In the same file

Not necessary to repeat the domain part for each host.  You have already 
done it on the SOA declaration.

This is the first time I have seen this format.  Usually the Network 
No./IP no. is sufficient i.e. no in-addr.arpa. string.

Suggest you first fix these and then report back your results.

Search the 'Net for basic BIND config tutorials.  This is a good place 
to start <http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/DNS-HOWTO.html>

humm ok. Its quite easy to find thin clients here for about ?98 or so,

Why would you want to do either of those if you are only implementing a

Tried sunbird/lightning/evolution with a caldav server? something

Ideally you should be using sieve on the mail servers, and a sieve
client plugin in thunderbird. (Sieve is a standard)

Tried IMAP? You probably are using a age-old pop3 account.

Hi All,
I am using sendmail via php mail function to send
emails. However few servers reject my mails with
the error 'Sender address rejected: Domain not

email@localhost.localdomain. How do I change this
to a valid domain name ? We only own a public IP.
we dont really have a domain name, is it possible

The only mainstream product that uses Sieve is Cyrus-imapd, pretty much 
every one else uses procmail

While on this subject, cyrus-imapd does also do shared folders and 
shared content. And I have seen atleast 1 hack that had webdav based 
ical support hacked in. Not sure if thats really out there in the wild 
as yet, if not - it cant be far away

Just adding my favorite mail client to this thread. GMAIL :). [yes you
can pop mails through gmail]

* As lightweight as it can get. Close to mutt.
* Shortcuts closer to VIM and mutt.
* Tagging instead of folders
* Search :)

I will swear by gmail any time. :P

ps:  I use mutt for my school id.

I could never get Gnus to work for me.
Everytime I try to make it work, I get lost in all the configuration minutiae.
I guess mere mortals like me have to stick with VM, which unfortunately is not
bundled with the standard GNU Emacs package. :)

does not quite work too well, with sketchy internet access ( eg. in a

   No sane server will accept mails from unresolvable servers.

   You will require a valid forward & reverse lookup if you need to send
   mails to internet.

forward lookup is usually sufficient. this very mailing list does not have 
reverse lookup on its server but it works. because of partly technical and 
partly administrative reasons, many providers in this part of the world are 
not in a position to provide reverse lookup. also, you can send mail out 
without working forward lookups also (at least for some time) using your isp's 
mail relay host. but what would be the point? if you dont have working forward 
lookup, people cant send mail to that address. why would you use a mail 
address to which people cant reply (unless you are spamming)?

etc etc. arun saab, what you really want to tell this fellow is that trailing 
dots have meaning in zone files - how with a trailing '.', the entry is taken 
as it is and without a trailing '.', the current $origin is appended. some sys 
admins use trailing dots, some dont. from the information given, it is not 
clear if the op or the web front end tool put those trailing dots in the file 
causing the problems.

err, that should be, you may be able to, not you can. depends on your service

sriram, your point well taken.  from the OP's post, I think it was 
webmin that created the files.  however, (if i am not mistaken) in this 
case had the OP left out the trailing "." the server field, in the SOA, 
would expand to linux05.pulsars.pulsars.lan. ($origin being 
pulsars.lan.).  from what I have read, the recommended method for the 
server field: it should be a fqdn ending with a period.

call me old fashioned - for DNS I have always created zone files the 
manual way.

unless you are very comfortable with sendmail config, may I suggest an 
alternative - postfix.  It is sendmail compatible i.e. you don't have 
to change other apps. that call sendmail.  It's configuration is 
simpler.

Well.. The question was 'most powerful' (though the majority of the
thread seems to be about 'most popular', with attributes like
'lightweight' thrown in :-) ), and not 'most user friendly'.. I agree
with you that gnus configuration is not that intuitive... The only
consolation though is that they have an excellent (and humorous as
well!) manual.. If you have the patience to read through it, I guess
you can cruise through.. :-)

I actually do use GMail primarily, and Gnus currently serves only my
local mail, from cron jobs like apticron. The only prick with Gnus is
that the HTML rendering (as w3 does it) is more like a spruced up text
web browser. GMail has an excellent UI, while Gnus has the power and
flexibility.. Trouble is, you only get to choose one...

You are correct Here. in Vodafone ( MUMBAI) GPRS also its working fine. i
have tried while travelling on bus and train as well. Connection is stable.
Vivek i can tell you something, GMAIL Mobile might be written specifically
for instable GPRS connections. So it may not be taken count as Mail client
as per the E-Mail Standard.

You have to have support for NTFS 3G driver under linux which can write
to an NTFS file system.

Then you can do what you want.

Hi Arun,

Thanks for your immediate response and the pointer to 
<http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/DNS-HOWTO.html>. Some I didn't get this page 
in my Google search for 'DNS tutorial'.

Anyway, I was little confused and inconsistent in that when I first 
installed the debian server I wanted to call my domain 'pulsars', and 
six months later, while I was configuring DNS I decided to call it 
'pulsars.lan'. Now finally I'll be calling it 'pulsars.lan' only and I 
shall correct the configuration files accordingly.

On top of it, today I thought I'll give one more try with nslookup and 
dig before making any modifications. Incidentally I restarted bind9. 
Surprisingly I got proper responses for 'mg-laptop.pulsars.lan' and 
'linux05.pulsars.lan' (192.168.0.104 and 71 respectively). Probably I 
did not restart bind9 yesterday. Sorry for raising a false alarm.

Once again thanks for your response. Sure I'll remember your Sys Admin 101

Regards Ganesh

Well, I guess I didn't have the patience then. :-)
VM's manual was far more simpler and easy to understand than Gnus'.
And I really wanted to believe that no gnus is good gnus, but the sheer size
of the manual left me with no choice. :-)

    No sane server will accept mails from unresolvable servers.

 forward lookup is usually sufficient. this very mailing list does not have
 reverse lookup on its server but it works. because of partly technical and
 partly administrative reasons, many providers in this part of the world are
 not in a position to provide reverse lookup. also, you can send mail out
 without working forward lookups also (at least for some time) using your isp's
 mail relay host.

   The general trend in anti spam policies is to block all servers without
   reverse lookup, or any ip address which falls into dynamic range, etc.
    
   I have seen many a servers reject mail without valid reverse lookup.

   In fact this mailing list final relay to internet is a valid one. This is
   what i have from the headers of this mail.

   DNS lookups for the server..

   $ host www.ae.iitm.ac.in
   www.ae.iitm.ac.in has address 203.199.213.51

   $ host 203.199.213.51
   51.213.199.203.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer www.ae.iitm.ac.in.

   There a whole lot of internal servers before this relay that can't be
   looked up.  May be a hosts entry is made to accommodate them.

hi everyone!

as someone really inexperience with these things, i would like to know:
so, what if India rejected the format? how could it affect us?

i would also like to know how true it is when saying "India rejected" rather than "BIS committee rejected" the format.

bye!

there is some licensing problem with OOXML format.(as always) So, open
source guys(us) arent entirely free to use it.
As far as i know, The format is taken before ISO for standardization. It has
to be approved by countries.

Any idea if it was created with Office 2007?  I believe OO has a plugin 
for Office2007 format - you will have to search for it.

Dear All,

Recently the no of top posting in our list is increased. It is not
recommanded for the mailing list and it affect the readability of the
list mails. So Plz avoid top posting, learn to reply in bottom posting
style and remove unnecessary text before replying to list.

<snip> From RFC 1855

- If you are sending a reply to a message or a posting be sure you
  summarize the original at the top of the message, or include just
  enough text of the original to give a context.  This will make
  sure readers understand when they start to read your response.
  Giving context helps everyone. But do NOT bindly include the entire 
  original!

- If you include a signature keep it short.  Rule of thumb is no 
  longer than 4 lines.

If you want to learn more about this, Plz read the "RFC 1855 - 
Netiquette Guidelines".

Bharathi,

Let us not be Netiquette nazis here. The problem with top and bottom 
posting is well debated. However, in lot of conversations, I find top 
posting easy to handle since it tells me the latest reply.

Bottom posting is really useful if all of us snip and summarize. 
However, without snipping, it makes it a very hard read.. Summarizing 
takes time and that is also at a premium.

Vaidhy

Nope, Office 2007 files open without a hitch in Oo.org-2.3 in ubuntu 7.10.
Though the new XML format can only be opened in read only mode.
Dhanagopal are you sure that the file is OK? And what do error you get
on opening it?

Configuration details are as follows

OS - Debian etch testing

Hard Disks configured in RAID 1 ( OS )  and RAID 5 ( Data  )

    I searched in net and got some tools but if you have experienced in

Hi,
     Please specify the following. 

1. What sound card do you have? Else at least specify the model number of
the motherboard you are using (if it's an integrated audio chip)
2. What Linux Distro are you using?

You can get the information about your motherboard/sound chip from the
manuals or from Windows if you have it installed :). Once we know this, we
can suggest what to do.

It is hard to figure out you have in mind (at least for me) just going 
by the title.  A one para. exec. summary would give us an idea of the 
article's objective.

You can do this and recover.

$ tr -d '\r' < file.exe > newfile.exe

under Cygwin on Windows.

Essentially what is done in ASCII mode FTP transfer is map the "\r\n" to
"\n" as Windows terminates newlines with CRLF and UNIX uses only LF.

The best thing to do would be to transfer it in bin mode once again.

When you are doing ASCII transfer of a binary file from Windows to UNIX,
then if the values 0d0a in hex occur nearby, then it will be replaced
with 0a since UNIX uses only newlines.

If you are too lazy to respect the feelings and rules of the list,

Hello all,
We are developing an embedded application in a customized Linux. When I boot
the customized linux, it shows all the hardware and other infos. I dont like
to show all this infos, after I switched on my machine. After I switched on
my machine, It should directly enter into desktop. I mean, hidden all
booting process in background, but in monitor should not show anything. How
can I do this. Any facilities are available in initrc?.

you might want to consier looking up the linux boot process, I'd guess
most of the info you are talking about is the linux kernel booting,
which is well before init kicks in.

one thing you can do is add the 'quiet' flag on the bootline, that will
reduce the noise by quite a lot.

Another alternative is to setup the kernels console to be /dev/ttyS0 -
if you have a serial port in the device - that way, you get zero chatter
on the default display, while if you have a problem, plugging into the
device over serial will give you all the chatter.

you can rewrite the init scripts to also suppress all the stuff ( but,
I'd recommend you look at 'rhgb' or something similar to give the user
some feedback on the process ).

I used kernel option "quiet" to hide this messages (I tried this
option to reduce the boot-up time). But after booting, you can see
those messages using the dmesg command.

ISO standards are determined by votes by different national level 
standards bodies. A country voting against a proposal reduces it's 
chances of being accepted as a ISO standard.

BIS Committee represents India at a national level in ISO standards.

EULA is not a "enemy". It depends on the content of the EULA. There are 
fairly good ones too. You probably need to specify more information if 
you want help.

Almost every student who install or use any proprietry/copyright software in his own PC or in college comes across  some kind of EULA agreement, and without reading through or understanding about those strict licenses, they start using the softwares (The most common example being Winzip, used by every windows user has a strict licensing terms)

In many of my awareness programme, many students have raised questions, why they need to bother about licensing, when they just need softwares for their use.

I have explained them,  the softwares they use follow very strict licensing terms, sometimes called as EULA and those softwares don't give them any freedom in use/copy/redistribute/modify.  As a student, they should be knowing about their rights when using softwares also, and the  General Public License (GPL) was created keeping this in mind and to know about the essentials of software freedom.

I strongly feel and realise that every student who use computer should really know about what is GPL and EULA licenses mean and it is even much more important than knowing Linux or other.

not necessarily... 

just take four freedoms to them and applying them they should arrive at 
knowledge of different licences.

i am not sure what stage you teach them the licenses, but if it is at the 
introduction level, the chances are that it might confuse them.

they are there to code ("not to sue & tussle"), and explaining them the 
benefits of having a free software at learning ("simply") would rather 
fascinate them and drive them easily to the free software world.

law students, yes EULA, GPL does make difference at the very beginning, not 
with others, I feel.

Debian GNU/Linux, and using XTerm and Mutt or pine, here's what I see
of the current subject of your mail:

Sorry, but that's the way it is. For any distribution, for people who
check their mail through text-mode, unless they get UTF-8 support for
text mode.

You might want to investigate how some distros e.g. Fedora, Ubuntu, 
openSUSE show a splash screen masking the boot messages and instead 
showing a progress bar of sorts.  Unfortunately, I do not know the 
technicalities of how to do it.

Read the GTK Document, which may be available in the
/usr/share/doc/gtk2-devel-XYZ folder of your PC.

Check this. It may help.

It may be a bug or some ncurses lib is missing. So just try the GUI
way 'make xconfig'

Hey folks -- Is there any reliable way to map PCI slot to device names in
Linux - that is given ethN I am trying to map it to phisical location in the
server - its been a long standing problem for me ..... especially if the
server has different varieties of chipsets installed (broadcom,intel,etc) --
i am looking for this to actually make sure the drivers are attaching
corrrectly .......

For example to do this in solaris - I would do a 'grep bgeNN
/etc/path_to_inst' #for the bge chipset and lookup the hardware adress in
sun site..........to identify the slot #

Thanks freinds for any help/hint you may render

Back home, I have Open Solaris, Ubuntu and Windows installed on my PC
(half way around the globe). I don't remember if I got Solaris' boot
loader (is that not GRUB?) to work. But since I had reinstalled Linux
after installing my Solaris, I just added the Solaris partition into
my Grub config. I am not able to choose between the three OSs. Am sure
you should be able to do it the otherway round also. But, by default
Linux/ Windows is not going to recognize Solaris/ vice versa. You have
to manually add it to the boot menu. But that is quite easy.

PS: In my mail Solaris = Open Solaris.

Cheers,
Natarajan

What could be the need for doing such a thing?

PCI has been a plug and play bus for years now. And newer versions viz
PCI-e and PCI-X are going to be even more easy.

Why do you want to manually figure out the PCI slot?

All that a driver needs in the PCI world are three things.

a) PCI device number
b) PCI function number
c) PCI bus number (Usually this is just 0)

Anyway to answer your question

#lspci -v -v |grep Ethernet

should get you what you want.

in what particular order the onbaord , pci nics are scanned in linux ....if
i have no physical access to the server and if someone tells me PCI slot 4
(labeled on the server) is connected to switch A....how can i figure out
which ethN  it is .....

to clarify my woes a bit further - if i add a new pci device (lets assume a
SCSI controller or even another NIC) ..the device names get reordered and/or
renamed  - so one has to redo the ifcfg-ethNN files ..check if the drivers
are attaching to the right NICs ...reconfigure
modules.conf/modprobe.conf(distro
specific).......

doing a search on the web , few folks have suggested to have a udev
rule(kernel version >=2.6.*) to bind mac adresss or device adresss to the
device logical name  -- hmm - there must be a simpler way to do this -
especially in 2.4 kernels .............

Just an observation, the OP fails to elaborate (which he should have in 
his first posting) when asked what is WinHTTP, instead some one else 
does it.

It makes me wonder whether his query is really serious or was he just 
fishing.

Long time back (2.4.x), in /etc/modules.conf one could force it like so
alias <driver1> eth0
alias <driver2> eth1

IIRC, some drivers took interrupt no. as an option to separate the NICs 
that used the same driver.

I have not done this on the 2.6.y kernel.

That is the right way for 2.6 kernels. What is not simple in it? Add
to udev rules (for example):

# PCI device 0x1317:0x0985 (tulip)
SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTRS{address}=="00:50:bf:99:ce:9e",
NAME="eth1"

For 2.4, you can use hotplug scripts:

Message-ID: <ca794bb80803242334o4ee0075cjf814a45adb1d1918@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Greetings guys !

I bought a new Compaq C738 TU laptop, i wanted to go for Ubuntu Linux in the
laptop instead of Pre installed Windows Vista in that laptop, i had
installed Ubuntu but i found that the Atheros Wireless client is not
working, i tried to install the drivers for that but even after a long try i
am unable to do it, i am not sure what to do now.

I dont want to go for dual boot in the same laptop with windows installed, i
want to use that with Ubunu only.

Can any one help me out in this?

R.Gobinath,

Presuming since this is a server (the need for multiple NIC) - how often 
do you change NICs in your systems?   If you come across a simpler 
solution please share it with this forum.

Sorry for late reply. I have not  opened my inbox since the time i
have sent the query mail yesterday

As said  by lawgon,  the WinHTTP i meant is given in
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa382925.aspx

Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) provides developers with an
HTTP client application programming interface (API)
 to send requests through the HTTP protocol to other HTTP servers.
WinHTTP supports desktop client applications, Windows services, and
Windows server-based applications.

I hope Apache is a web server application and not suitable for my requirement.

Please let me know if any more ideas.

Thanks

Message-ID: <47E8DB3C.2060804@bksys.co.in>

Hi,
        I am using the firefox version 2.0.0.3 . I have implemented the web interface
        in php5.2 version. In that interface, I am having the listview with more than 5000 records. The listview is implemented with the activewidgets2.0 version.

        When, i am selecting all the records in the listview (ie) clicking the check boxes, the page is giving the javascript alert that,

        "A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can

As someone said curl can do this.

a) curl
http://curl.haxx.se

wget can as well.

b) wget
www.gnu.org/software/wget/

And so can lftp.

c) lftp
http://lftp.yar.ru/

I have had to do this long long ago and I found curl to be quite useful.
You can even store and send the auth cookie in the header thereby
simulating a user's logged in session.

Look for curl's '-H', '-A' and '-b' switches.

curl is very powerful and you can write any application that uses HTTP,
FTP and several other protocols.

It also lends to easy scriptability.

Whereas tools like wget and lftp are geared towards end user.

Best of luck!

Can you provide more information about the chipset?
And also what steps/guides you followed, will be useful.

I could see that curl,wget are command line tools  that uses http, etc
 protocol.and are end user commands.

Please let me know the if my understanding is wrong.

The WinHTTP APIs in windows are given below.

WinHttpOpen
WinHttpOpen
WinHttpConnect
WinHttpOpenRequest
WinHttpSendRequest
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384257(VS.85).aspx

I need corresponding APIs in Linux  to develop my application.

I have also looked into 'wget source code'  and found that the http
requests are done with socket calls and ultimately read/write the data
stream from/to  fd.

Is this the  only method to work out ? if so, i have to develop my own
APIs and then work application Or else please let me know if any APIs
readily available.

Thanks

In that case use libcurl. libcurl is the library used by curl to do
all its HTTP connections. Its pretty easy to use if you spend some
time with the documentation.

Dear All,

When I was browsing Anna University website, I came across the page of
Laboratory Requirements
for CSE/IT/MCA Lab.

The link is

http://www.annauniv.edu/cai/links/LaboratoryRequirements0809/

The University has proposed the following softwares to be used in the
CSE/IT/MCA laboratory
for the academic year 2008-09 (almost all obselete proprietory
softwares/freewares have got entries. Don't get
surprised if you see PWS (Personal Web Server) in the IT Lab syllabus and no
mentioning about
Apache/Tomcat).

I have short listed the softwares recommended by the University and is
available below in PDF format

http://linuxbaskar.googlepages.com/be-cse-3-7sem-2008-09-lab-requiremen.pdf

Pl. through the list and you will know, why GNU/GPL/FOSS softwares hasn't
reached the shores of Indian Education

Your understanding will improve as and when you start understanding
UNIX philosophy and how UNIX tools are built.

It is not something that can be explained.

It is something you will feel instinctively over time...a few months or
years.

It is not like Windows in which you read up some API and get some job
done.

UNIX needs a lot of investment.

hi!

i dont think you should conclude regarding the entire Indian Education scenario from ur facts about anna university

as far as  some of the proprietary softwares are concerned  m$ and some other products are free for anna university and affiliated colleges as per some recent pact. so while preparing the syllabus those might have been in there for consideration, i guess

[but i do agree there is very little encouragement for open-source and non-windows products]

I have a strange problem for the past 24 hours.
I am using a BSNL broadband connection at Chennai.
I am unable to access any of the ubuntu related sites for more than 24
hours using any operating system (windows, linux) or browser through my
connection. These includes websites like ubuntu.com , kubuntu, xubuntu,
ubuntuforums, cannonical or even irc or update my ubuntu installation. 

I am however able to access most other websites i use normally like
google, yahoo, kernel.org and other sites. 

Does BSNL block some websites. If so  why would they block ubuntu
related sites? 

Am i the only person facing this? are others using bsnl in chennai or
elsewhere having this problem?

I have registered a complaint at the BSNL call center... can someone
email me if they are also facing it?
Regards
gunashekar

Well, I had mentioned about Apache, but read carefully - Its Apache -
HTTPClient for Java. Its the WinHTTP for the Java World. Apache has a
whole bunch of software available under its umbrella and it is not
restricted to Apache webserver, which is the main product of the
group.

Coming back to UNIX world, the equivalent that *I think* you might be
interested is (and has been echoed by a few others) LIB-CURL.

http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/
http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-tutorial.html

NB: 

1. You include the entire transcript of a digest mode message in your 
query - implying you just hit the "Reply" button on a message to 
compose your own "new" query - a NO NO.  This practice screws up 
message threading.  New query - compose new message.

2. You then top post; where the rest of the message (content of digest 
message) has *zero* relevance to your query - a NO NO.

3. Looks like you missed S. Bharathi's recent request to follow mailing 
list etiquette.

Going back to your query - run bind as a cacheing nameserver and remove 
your dependency on BSNL's DNS servers.  I have MTNL service (Mumbai) 
and did the same when I started encountering such problems.

Post a new message. It is possible that bsnl nameserver you are using

'typo' means spelling mistake. 'typos' is the plural. For an example  
of spelling mistake is to write 'u' instead of 'you'.

I believe that option is dependant on the BIOS. Check the BIOS setting,
if it supports such an operation.

It might be trying to sync the buffers.

Try this.

# sync && poweroff

Subject: [Ilugc] queue(3) macros for linked lists
Message-ID: <20080327092157.GA24976@saraswathy.madambakam.org>

Dear students and aspiring C programmers,

This is applicable even to C coders with a decade of experience.

All of us know that linked lists form the most important data
structure/building block in coding/design.

The kernel is full of linked list manipulations. Take the TCP/IP stack
for instance. All the packet queues are implemented using linked lists.

Issues like appending, deleting, reordering and so on occur all the
time.

And our IT industry is never tired of asking interview questions like

"How to reverse a linked list?"

Anyway I have been fortunate enough not to wrack my brains designing
doubly linked lists and solve other complex problems using linked lists.
For instance how to build an AVL tree of a red black tree using lists?

To answer all that nowadays we have queue(3) macros

You can find the implementation in /usr/include/sys/queue.h.

And using them is really trivial. ;)

Here is an example code attached.

And you can find the man page here.

http://sirsasana.org/misc/queue.pdf

-------------- next part --------------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/queue.h>

struct lines {
	char line[512];
	LIST_ENTRY(lines) next;
};

LIST_HEAD(, lines) linesh;


char po[] = "This is a long line\nThis is a short line\nand this is the third line";

int
print_lines()
{
	struct lines *tmp;

	LIST_FOREACH(tmp, &linesh, next)
		printf("[%s]\n", tmp->line);

}

int
girish_remove(struct lines *foo)
{
	LIST_REMOVE(foo, next);
	free(foo);

}
int
free_list()
{
	 while (!LIST_EMPTY(&linesh))
		girish_remove(LIST_FIRST(&linesh));
}

int 
main() 
{
	char *p1, *p2, *ba;
	LIST_INIT(&linesh);
	struct lines *boo, *tmp;

	ba = strdup(po);
	for (;;) {
		
		p2 = strsep(&ba, "\n");
		if (p2 == NULL)
			break;

		boo = (struct lines *)malloc(sizeof(struct lines));
		
		strlcpy(boo->line, p2, sizeof(boo->line));
		LIST_INSERT_HEAD(&linesh, boo, next);

You type it at the root prompt.

#

is the root prompt.

For bash, I guess it will be 

bash#

or something. ;)

You have to type these commands for switching off the PC.

bash# sync && poweroff

Try it.

Or you can type

bash# sync
bash# poweroff

Hi list,
After the incomprehensible "Elephant's Dream" that raised all sorts of
philosophical questions in my mind, heres another open movie but with an
understandable storyline
http://peach.blender.org/index.php/about/

The movie is called `Big Buck Bunny' and is part of the peach project
and used (and contributed back to) Blender during the production. The
apricot project works on an open game by the way and stars the same fat
bunny.

The site should be a great source of inspiration for people who want to
do something artistic with blender and foss tools as such. (I tried but
sucked at it)

Message-ID: <499114.51693.qm@web50808.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hello all
 i attempted to install slamd64 on a HP Proliant ML350. This uses CCISS compaq smart array for Linux Software Raid (RAID 1 - mirrored SCSI HDDs in my case)
On reboot , am sent into mode asking to login as root and repair the FS. 
Is there a total incompatibilty between a 32-bit Linux software RAID and 64-bit OS?

I see a possible resolution for XFS system, at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=285858

I am using ext3 as the filesystem. Is there an equivalent way of attempting the solution as per the above thread?

The hardware is certified to work with Linux 2.6.5+ kernels, so i fiugured it shld work. Centos x86_64 current runs fine on it.

Thanks and regards

devafree

Message-ID: <809586140803272050t360ee490l9830a668e28cd656@mail.gmail.com>

Hi luggies,

I am trying to install Websphere App. Server 5.1 (WAS 5.1) on CentOS
5. I have successfully installed on it (after installing libXP and
compact rpms). But, when I try to start the server it says
libthread.so not found.

After a bit of googling, I found that WAS 5.1 is built with
LinuxThreads and does not support NPTL. I also got from the release
notes of RHEL 4 that there will be no support for LinuxThreads from
RHEL 5. Even using LD_ASSUME_KERNEL will not work under RHEL/CentOs 5.

So, is there a solution to run old applications built using
LinuxThreads to work under RHEL/CentOs 5.

Please let me know.

Thanks,

V.Vishnu

Instead of accessing http://cb.vu/unixtoolbox.xhtml, i tried http://cb.vu/

See Karanbir's post - you may be out of luck on this issue.  Anyway, why 
are you using an age old distro like RH 9?

Dear Ganesh,
             Why don't you try disabling acpi and booting? Then you can know
if the problem is due to ACPI/not. Use option=noacpi as a kernel param in
your grub when you boot and try.

Hi,

I heard that the number of sub-folders / files in a linux directory should
not exceed 32,000 . There is not enough material available in the net.

I am maintaining a blogging server in my company, using Wordpress MU.  If
the sub-folders limit is true, then it will critically affect the
application that we are running.

We are using RHEL 4 with ext3 file system.

Can any one provide some details on this.

How?

To begin with, I have no experience/knowledge on this.

I only suppose that there is a limit on the number of inodes one can
have.

I think it is possible to raise the limit by changing a #define and
recompiling the kernel. Or there could be other file system specific
fixes.

As to possible choices between file systems under linux again I dunno
much. I would imagine that XFS is good.

Just a wild idea. If you have a problem with this, how about using some
kind of virtual machine? Say qemu or UML?

You could split up the load across them.

Xen is also a good choice.

Anyway already I am out of my province.

Best of luck!

Yes, you are right, it is not allowing to create more than 32000 subfolders.
This is what I tried
-bash-2.05b#  for ((  i = 0 ;  i <= 32001;  i++  )); do mkdir test$i; done
at the end around 3199x count i got the message,
"cannot create directory `last': Too many links"

I used http://linuxzoo.net/  Fedora image as my test machine,

I am using shared broadband connection in my Debian laptop at home. I am
having an annoying problem regarding my internet connection. My problem is:
after some times my connection is gone automatically. Sometimes it occurs
after 10 minutes & sometimes it occurs after 1/2 hours. Here, "connection
gone" means..."Destination Host unreachable". But, if i reboot my laptop, it
becomes ok again & same problem happens after some time. Reboot... ok...
again gone...reboot...ok... so on.

I am facing this problem in my home only, no problem at all in my office or

How can i get rid of such problem?

Subject: [Ilugc] Any solution to use LD_ASSUME_KERNEL in Centos 5
Message-ID: <434560.1585.qm@web50805.mail.re2.yahoo.com>


I am trying to install Websphere App. Server 5.1 (WAS 5.1) on CentOS
5. I have successfully installed on it (after installing libXP and
compact rpms). But, when I try to start the server it says
libthread.so not found.
After a bit of googling, I found that WAS 5.1 is built with
LinuxThreads and does not support NPTL. I also got from the release
notes of RHEL 4 that there will be no support for LinuxThreads from
RHEL 5. Even using LD_ASSUME_KERNEL will not work under RHEL/CentOs 5.

So, is there a solution to run old applications built using
LinuxThreads to work under RHEL/CentOs 5.

For mysql , there is workaround like this -> at http://bugs.mysql.com/2173
echo '/* Linuxthreads */' >> /usr/include/pthread.hHope it helps

regards,
devafree

This leads me to ask the question again. Does anyone know of a
reliable way by which one can use the GMail interface to bottom post?
The interface is so horribly biased towards top posting, and the irony
is that the top posters do not even realise that people who use "real"
mail clients have to see everything below, as GMail silently hides it.

Thanks.

unfortunately for all webmail, there seems to be no substitute for  
hard work - the few times I am forced to use webmail, I feel a lot of  
sympathy for people who top post ;-). I mark the part I want to  
quote, press 'reply' and the whole damn message comes up.

Is this a dial-up connection?
Possibly your network interface is going down for some reason.
When Internet is not accessible, are you able to ping the ip address
of your machine and the gateway?

run 'ifup eth0' in the terminal. (replace 'eth0' with the appropriate
interface).
this should bring your connection back.

Yes, it does take up considerable time and effort, which is why people
just tend to post it with a single "Reply" hit. "Better GMail" used to
work, but they haven't "ported" the bottom posting feature to the new
GMail version (or so I gather, from my glance at the program).

Thanks.

Is it the grub prompt ?
Use the following

If the boot partition is the first partition.

grub> root (hd0,0)
grub> root /dev/yourrootpartition kernel /vmlinuz
grub> boot

Message-ID: <c77544c50803301106r5903f54bu9fc1f644824c90cc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all
 I am using ubuntu7.10. When i loading some web sites with Firefox its not
at all showing the contents. They have clearly mentioned that this site will
work properly only with IE6.0 or above and also i have to get some java
applets to be loaded in my browser when i click a link in that particular
site. I have tried IE4rlinux but it was not possible to get that java
applets working in that too. even i have tried opera for that nothing
useful.

Can anyone suggest me any of browser just like IE but designed for
linux/ubuntu or can anyone guide to how to configure jvm for a ubuntu/linux
browser

Pls switch to root account
$ sudo su -

Then sudo will prompt you for  password, which will give you root-level
access

Message-ID: <289b5e200803302337h5cbe72a0l56474d32c8a1973c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have installed ubuntu 7.10, mandriva one and windows xp in a system (P
III/ 40GB/ 256mb RAM) multibooting with grub. All are working fine.

I wanted to remove mandriva one. So by running gparted I reformatted the
/dev/sda6 (10 Gb) ext3 as FAT32. Though the formatting was completed, when I
rebooted the system, ubuntu did not automount the partition (sda6). When
viewed through file browser, the capacity of sda6 partition size is shown as
2.5Gb instead of 10GB. Windows xp shows the partition as FAT32 of size 10
GB.

Any clues to solve this problem?

Dear Satheesh,
		    Few distros like Ubuntu do not assign a root password by
default and make the user a sudo-er. To execute any command as root prefix
it with sudo and enter your own user account password when prompted for one.
If you try to open some gnome apps (Say Synaptic), then also it asks for a
password. As Ubuntu uses gksudo, this is also your user password. To get to
a root shell type sudo -s and enter your own user a/c password. To set the
root password, type passwd in a root shell and enter the new password for
root. Hope this helps.

Regards,
Karthik Ramgopal

But honestly, 32000 subfolders in the same level sounds scary to
me.

That was a good one :) never thought of that. I always did a 'sudo
bash' when I am forced to work on a ubuntu box.

Hi,
     There are many ways you can reset the root password.In ubuntu initially
you donot have the root password set. So ,you can simply execute this
command by opening the terminal:
 sudo passwd

The shell will ask you for a new UNIX password and you get access to root
with this new passwd you set.

The account 'ubuntu' is actually an account for desktop user that you set
during installation and usually has all the administrative
previleges.Butwhenever you do tasks like accessing synaptic or change
system settings ,
you need to enter you password for 'ubuntu' account not the 'root' account.




Incase you forget the root password you have options to get it reset
it.Youcan get those options by checking other forums or just use any
of the two
methods mentioned below

1)first option is simple :use the ubuntu live disk and select the repair
option while in grub
2)second one is without the need of any repair disk. just when grub
appears.press e and then you will get some lines mentioning something like
root (hda0,0) and so on.
select the line strating with the keyword with kernel and add init=/bin/bash
at the end of the line and also replace an option ro to rw in the same line.
press enter and press b to boot
you will directly get a shell prompt bypassing ulogin .so just set the
password by typing passwd

restart the system and you have the root passwd reset for you.

I hope this helps you.

I hope, the limit is hardcoded in the FS header files.

$ grep 32000 /usr/include/linux/*

ext2_fs.h:#define EXT2_LINK_MAX 32000
