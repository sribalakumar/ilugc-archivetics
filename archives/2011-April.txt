User feedback on this model has been pretty bad. Especially with the
heating part.

What do you mean by Linux Chennai  address?

Hope you know that Linux is not a company or a place; it's an operating
system (To be more specific, it's a kernel). Please be clear about the
question.

          First, please start a new thread when you want to tell/ask
something that is not related to the thread that you are replying
to(It's called thread hijacking). And then, please do not top post(You
should use interleaved posting, trimming unwanted parts of the mail

both these acts(thread hijacking/top posting) violate the mailing list

         Linux as such is a kernel, and there are lots of
organisations/companies that create operating systems using the Linux
kernel and other software (from GNU, Mozilla, Apache etc.) .  The OS
is called GNU/Linux, and some prefer to call it just Linux.

Each one of those Linux+GNU+ others is called a distribution, or
distro for short.. Debian, Fedora are some examples. The choice of the
distro depends on the individual. So, when you say you want "linux os
cd", please be clear in what exactly you want. Thanks

Please go through the mailing list guidelines
(http://www.ilugc.in/content/mailinglist-guidelines) before you try
sending another email to the list. That should get you started with
the recommended etiquette.
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html is a very standard
article on how to ask smart questions. Welcome to ILUGC. :-)

If you are interested in having a personal conversation with anyone,
sending it only to that person instead of sending it to the list is a
better idea.

If you want to get a GNU/Linux distribution to try out, you could try
Ubuntu/Fedora imho. You can participate in the April 2011 ILUGC
meeting and copy the distros of your choice in your USB drive or empty
CDs/DVDs from the members who have them.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Ignore this message if I misunderstood your posting.

FOSS mailing list web forum culture is to ask question(s) in the
mailing list/web forum so that everyone benefits.  Commercial vendors
give personal and telephonic support.

As root user (or sudo in *buntu)

# netstat -nplt | egrep ":22"

list the output of above

also check if you have enabled any iptables (firewall) rules

# iptables --list

list the output of above.

Subject: [Ilugc] Mysql query issue
Message-ID: <AANLkTikcxvu6KzT=1jRVLCLcKe9uGuwYsLPEF2SZn7O9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I have a MySQL table and it contains around 20,000,00 records.
id(promary key and autogenerate),review(text),hash(int)) is the table
structure

There is a column called "hash",which has the hash value (generated
programatcally)
I am pretty sure that there is duplicate records in my table.Thats y i
generated a hash.
Now i would like to dedupe the table using hash.
This is the query i used for the said purpose

Positive : table name
id : auto generated id
hash : hash value
review : reviews

delete Positive
from Positive,
    (
        select MIN(id) minIdent, hash s
        from Positive m
        group by hash
        having count(1) > 1
    ) as derived
where Positive.hash= derived.s
and id > minIdent

The above dedupe query is working.I checked it in a tabel which contains
10,000 records.All the duplicate hash values are removed.
But my problem is while trying the same query in large table (20,000,00),it
takes too long.
On a test run the query runs 24 hours and not completed


Is there anything which is wrong. Because I am not that much expert in DB

this is a one-off query to clean the database. There is no point trying
to optimise it (IMHO). I had to do the same with a pg database, with a
few thousand records and it took an hour or two (old machine).

Your comas are misleading, how many records are you having?
20 million or 20 lakh records?

To retain only the first duplicate record and delete all later ones, try this:

ALTER IGNORE TABLE your_table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (hash);

This will create a primary key using your hash field, retain only the
first unique hash and delete everything else.

If this is too slow, the alternate method is to copy unique records
into a new table and delete the old table.


To view list of duplicates, run this query:

SELECT hash, COUNT(hash) AS duplicate_count FROM \
    your_table_name GROUP BY hash HAVING (COUNT(hash) > 1);

Ensure you have created an index for the "hash" field before running
above query, this will help avoiding table scans and give you fast
performance.


Needless to say, backup your tables before bulk updating.

Well this logic is not totally correct but well there is certainly a way.

You can find out the default router of the MODEM and ping its IP address.

Or look at the MODEM status LED.;)

It is MODEM dependent.

You can write an automated script for CLI or even web interface.

But all that is messy and hard.

Use simple ping. A website like yahoo.com has a bank of IPs so by
pinging it you can
 make your life simple.

Or ping google.com.

But finding whether the MODEM has connected to the default gateway on
the other side
 is not quite sufficient for Internet access.

Sometimes their RAS end or RSU as it is called might not route packets
and you won't have
 Internet access.

So it is best that you try pinging one of the public sites.

If you are referring the home ADSL modem as router, then you need to
refer modem manual to find out the default IP. Mostly it will be
192.168.1.1. So set your PC IP as (192.168.1.200) and thru browser
access the router using the URL: http://192.168.1.1/

Bye :)

4. Use [OT] for off-topic, non-technical discussions.
But, don't misuse this to start flame wars or to troll
in the mailing list.

5. Do not top-post:

Glad about your willingness to give a talk in the upcoming ILUGC meet.
Please follow the mailing list guidelines
(http://www.ilugc.in/content/mailinglist-guidelines) and avoid top

in this list.

I am not sure if this would work, but changing the user-agent to mimic
the obsolete browser may help. But the better option is to raise your
concern to your ISP and with a lot of voices, they could realize that
there is no sense in building browser-specific/dependent websites.

                        Network monitor gives enough data usage for
every usage ( present session only) in Ubuntu and debian. I am using
this, try it. If you are using BSNL Broad and, then try 'DataFox'
add-on. Very nice one. It displays usage on  bottom of the browser
with time graph.

You can try traceroute/tracepath command which will tell you the path
in which your
requests traverse(different routers and computers). The first computer the
request will be your local router. From there it will be passed on to different
computers. This way you will be able to find where exactly your request is
getting dropped.

if the command is missing in your distribution you might have to installing
it with your package manager like yum or apt-get. In this case if you
can tell your
distribution. I can guide you appropriately.

 I am with Hauwaei E180, it works like a charm without any
installation on my Ubuntu 10.10. You just need to add the mobile

I had to dig this mail to fulfill a promise I made at the start of
the world cup. The source code is hosted here:
https://github.com/openbala/rummy.openbala.com

For those who are reading this mail for the first time:
I developed a website called 'Rummy' - http://rummy.openbala.com as a
pet project. This was a cricket game based on World Cup 2011 matches.

It had its run, now I'm working on the site for IPL. The website was
developed on Ruby on Rails. This mail is to say that the source code
of the site is open and it is available in github. (And I'll keep
checking-in new code as and when I commit to Heroku for IPL)

And BTW, please checkout the website you have not done so already - it
has an anonymous login for browsing as well - no need to have a
Facebook or Twitter account.

Is this an HW RAID card?  Vendor/Model?

if (HW RAID  == true) {
read up on the diagnostics aspect of the driver
turn on verbose mode
look at the logs
}
else (SW RAID == true ) {
smartctl -a /dev/sdX  X == drive number
read up mdadm/dmraid
turn on verbose mode
look at the logs
}

> One of the HDD's LED is glowing in amber.

Are the disks in a RAID cage or an external/internal?

Without sufficient information it is hard to figure out your problem.

         I use http://www.data.bsnl.in/wps/portal to check my
broadband usage. That works well with Iceweasel and Chrome. So, it
should work well with firefox on ubuntu  as well. You need to login
with the credentials that they(BSNL) share with you when you initially
get the broadband connection. Thanks

Hi,

I was just wondering if there was a way to create zooming presentations
using completely open source. Is there an approach that anyone know of to
create one.

See: prezi.com (proprietary)
For an example of what can be done using zooming presentations, please watch
this video:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo&feature=player_embedded

It will be useful for a lot of people, I'm sure.

Back when I used BSNL connection, I used the datafox firefox addon to check
my usage. But those BSNL guys will often change their site design and datafox
stops working every now and then. I don't know about the status now.

Hi Karuppanna,

If the BSNL MODEM's lights show Internet connectivity then all you
have to do is
login as root in Fedora.

# dhclient eth0

Once this command succeeds if you are lucky Internet will work.

Do not top post.

Most probably you have a modem-cum-router through which you connect your
machine to internet. You have to port forward relevant ports in your router.
This is very simple. Open the router management page and add the relevant
port numbers to the forwarded ports list.

Subject: [Ilugc] Suggest a FOSS Ticketing System
Message-ID: <BANLkTinuFTNhNSB7fC_YmT5cS3z_BQFS+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

One of my friends is running a hardware service business.
He plans to scale the business to rural places all over tamilnadu.

He needs a good ticketing system to manage all the issues under a
single umbrella.

Can you suggest a better FOSS Ticketing System?

Following are the requirements.

It should be web based
Should be FOSS
Should be handle 1000s of users
Should handle 200-400 tickets daily
Fields should be customizable in UI.
Should provide various privileges for various users and group.
Various Reports should be generated

I suggested VtigerCRM.
But I never tested for the performance in these kind of large scale
implementation.

Please suggest the tools if you know any that suits for these requirements.

Thanks.

Try this:

I also had the same problem I solved it. Right click on your desktop and
click Change Desktop Background -> Visual Effects (4th Tab). Set it for
"None".

Hope It will solve.

Excellent.. i too heard from my friend that many take up freelancing in just
PHP itself and earning more than what they do in Office..

Is IT graduation really necessary to take up Open Source Jobs?


Today, so many Engineering Graduates are passing out of college, left in the
dark, without knowing what to do.   We need to guide them about these
freelancing options, and to update their required skillset.  I dont know if
such self-enterpreneurship guidance is given in FOSS workshops conducted in
colleges.  If NOT, we should include that, which will give confidence to the
students..

Any thoughts?

Internet connection using mobile is a cakewalk in Ubuntu.  Just connect your
mobile through a data cable, create a new broadband connection and then
select appropriate provider (BSNL, airtel, which are available
pre-configured).  After completion, ubuntu will automatically connect to the
internet.

i do this explicitly, again this is a very personal thing no matter how well
you guide ultimately it is the person who has to walk the path. i have seen
folks taking from few months to years to get that confidence of "yes i can
do it"  , more than confidence i think it has to do more with the belief
system. unlearn learn unlearn curves.

Then why should NOT we target the school students? I have been seeing many
people after completing +2, going for degree because they dont know anything
else..  also those who complete B.Sc, pursue MCA just because they dont get
any job or dont know what to do..

This has to be tacked right from schooling..  again, +1 & +2 has been a jail
for most students, with no time for learning..

I had downloaded googleearth 64 bit today.  And from the below thread,
I think, it has nothing to do with Phython. I Found no Phython scripts
in the installation.

The big question is who are the 'WE' you are mentioning? And how many physical volunteers we have?. We get few opportunites to do sessions, but even for that ask Shrini how he struggles to get volunteers.

Wubi is not the right way. Your Ubuntu sits inside Windows partition and 
if fragmented it will slow your Ubuntu. If Windows is curruot you wont 
be able to access Ubuntu. The best solution is go for fresh install and 
install in on separate partition. Then only you will reap benefits of 
GNU/Linux. Is LinuxMint an independent install?

Agree !!!

I like this idea. If you ask students like me, the common response would be
"if only, we had been exposed to this domain a little earlier".

+1 and +2 are a jail for students because in this period the students
overburden themselves with JEE and PMT preparations. Although only a few of
them take the track they choose. Most do not make it upto the institution of
their dream and most of those who reach there find it not to be a place for
them. eg We have IITians becoming writers today and we have AMITIANS
bitching about their college.

What attracts students and their parents towards IIT and PMT are high paying
jobs in America. If there is a way to lead a financially sound life then why
not introduce it before the students end up wasting 6 years of their life (2
years in school 4 years in B.Tech) ?

Have you looked at OSTicket and OTRS?  Both are PHP based.   OSTicket
is installable via Fantastico on my shared web hosting provider.  I
have installed it and I am trying to educate my clients to open
tickets through this system instead of emails.  I suspect other web
hosting providers also provide it.

rt is also good (bit of a pain to set up though). An org that I was
connected with has been using it for some years with good results.

Also mention ideo chipset.  I am presuming the connection is DSUB-15
(analog VGA connector).

Make sure your cable is good and connected tight at both ends.

The newer Xorg do an autodetect and seem to override xorg.conf if it
exists (from my observation).

You mention you have reconfigured xorg in your OP.  Can you tell us
what you reconfigured.  Did you set the ModeLines manually?

Request Tracker is available as a Debian package for quite a long time.
I had an RT setup supporting several hundred internal users and 3k tickets
daily.  RT customization has a steep learning curve, but it's well worth
the effort IMO.

Auto detection also depends on the Xorg video drivers.  I recently had a
problem with a LCD panel connected to an Nvidia Quadro FX card over
DVI.  The vesa driver detected the monitor resolution correctly, but the
proprietary nvidia driver had problems reading EDID info and showed
a blank screen (the end user needed CUDA, so proprietary drivers were
essential).  I finally had to dump the EDID data using Win7 and use it in Xorg.

By WE, i meant those who want to do something..  before we look for
volunteers, i find that we dont have any strategic plan or vision on what we
are going to do..  In my humble opinion, conducting one day workshops, would
only give a very basic level of introduction to the students..  but if they
are to develop their skill set, we should have a comprehensive plan..

We need not volunteer for everything.. but if we could plan things ahead, we
can establish a link b/w students and mentors where we can use remote tools
to guide them from where we are..

Again, its my theoritical proposition, and it may or may not work out..  at
my personal capacity, i have handled around 5 students so far in this
method..

Senthil

Why the cross post?

Ctrl-D is end of file , if you feel the need to invoke it manually
then something is wrong with your design/goal.

What do you really want?

Brussels, Belgium: We are pleased to announce The Muktware Manual 
Project. The aim of this project is to create comprehensive manuals/user 
guides for different Gnu/Linux-based operating systems.

The core focus of this project is to help users in installing and using 
GNU/Linux systems through extremely easy, step-by-step instructions.

The guides will feature images and videos to make it even easier for a 
novice to install & use their systems.

We have selected 6 distros for this project:

1. Ubuntu
2. Kubuntu
3. Linux Mint
4. Fedora
5. openSuse
6. Debian

Each project will be led by an editor. Each editor will be paid a 
renumeration of US $150 per project. The deadline to finish & submit the 
project is April 28th, 2011.

We are looking for editors who can commit to releasing the projects in 
time and ensure error free copies of the manuals/guides.

The Guides will be developed internally, but once finalized they will be 
released as open-source projects published under a creative commons 
license. The project will be open to be edited by anyone ? just like a wiki.

The Muktware Manual Project is our contribution to the development and 
growth of the free software technologies. The aim of this project is to 
create a comprehensive pool of information under a single roof which 
will benefit not just one distro, but GNU/Linux in general. I hope this 
project will help people to use GNU/Linux with greater ease.

We are inviting the applications for editors. If you think you have the 
time and skills to lead the project, apply now to become a project 
leader/editor.

Send applications to editor at muktware.com

Hi All,

  Indic typing booster(ITB) is a predictive text input method for indian
languages. Project is hosted at
https://fedorahosted.org/indic-typing-booster/ .
  Screen-cast of ITB input method is available in
1] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTYNVP7p-xY
2] http://blip.tv/file/4961440

  I think it can give better idea about the project. In screencast phonetic
ITB is used for demonstration. It is available in inscript as well. I think
Malayalam and Punjabi by this month end.

  If anyone want to contribute do subscribe to

Hi,


Since Fedora 14 has automatic display configuration, which works without xorg.conf. So, you can try deleting all xorg.conf and xorg.conf backup files. But make sure that you create a backup of a working xorg.conf. You can also try using system-config-display, as super user when you're in run-level 3 w/o a running X.

Hi,

I need some information on Linux SBCs available in India. I have done my
homework on the web:


   1. Beagle Board : 10,500/- and above
   2. Hawk Board : 6,000/- and above
   3. Friendly arm and clones / Mini 2440 with 3.5" LCD : 8,000/- and above
   4. Samsung ARM cores : 5,500/- and above (I don't want to build the
   Mother board for this)
   5. From abroad : Sheeva plug, a lot of others at around 99 USD.

Most of these boards are a bit of over kill for my application. I need a
linux SBC to do SSL connection over PPP on GPRS. I would have even settled
for an 8 bit micro, but SSL is too much for those devices.

Any suggestions or recommendations?

Arun

Dear all,
     Today, I have installed CentOS in a Xeon server for my school (Bhavan's Rajaji Vidyashram) for running a PHP application.
I also had a good discussion with my IP (Informatics Practices) teacher about implementing Linux in all the servers.

One another approach is to take a phone and run yor application on the
phone's processor. Most phones have a 120-150Mhz ARM processor and can
run all you need. Furthermore, phones come with good amounts of memory
too.

I remember seeing a BREW phone from BSNL at 6,500/=. I'm suggesting
this as you anyway need GPRS. Added advantage is that your appliance
will run on battery.

I'm certain you can get Android phones @$100 in China. Smartphones
start at $75. G'Five has a 3.5" screen smartphone retailing at 2,500/=
with a touchscreen in India. You cannot beat cellphone volumes and
they will come far cheaper than the options above due to the volumes
the industry has.

See if this works for you

Other places to search would be:

I have used  AT91RM9200 blue board from ngx technologies  ( Rs.3300/-) and 
interfaced with GSM modem and controlled the GPIO. It worked fine. The board 
came with Linux support. So I didn't do anything with linux.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=Nq9LB0RrxAUVQBWt0n8UCp7oGdg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a C program which generates a series of images and I wanted to make
them into a video file. While reading up ffmpeg documentation I came across
repeatedly that ffmpeg can take input from named pipes.

What I could not find anywhere is in what format the files given into the
pipe should be(jpeg, bmp, raw etc) and how the files are delimited. Can
anyone shed light on this?
I can't input the files through %d input mechanism because I do not want to
generate n image files and then call the ffmpeg. If I could feed images to
ffmpeg as and when it is generated I could save lot of space. :)

Thanks.

Friends

It seems that asciidoc is not supporting unicode characters.
or it is not working for me.

I am getting only characters like
"&#xbb5;&#xbc7;&#xba3;&#xbcd;&#xb9f;&#xbc1;&#xbae;&#xbcd;"
in the pdf generated by a2x for the text formatted in asciidoc with
tamil content.

Is it possible to work on unicode text with asciidoc?

Yeah in fact I had proposed this for a client for a different project. You
even get a camera attached!
But for this project, I need a SBC as this will eventually be productized.

I tried to convert an asciidoc UTF-8 file into HTML using Asciidoc 8.2.7. And it
works.

If we were to take asciidoc->xsltproc->fop route, we will have to embed the
Tamil font into the PDF document, and specify for which portions of text it has
to be used. The following page has some suggestions, but it is not for the faint
at heart.

I am quoting your original mail.
Hi,

I have a C program which generates a series of images and I wanted to make
them into a video file. While reading up ffmpeg documentation I came across
repeatedly that ffmpeg can take input from named pipes.

This is really simple with mplayer.

http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/menc-feat-enc-images.html

I have tried and it works nicely.

Alas. Google is no substitute for relevant domain knowledge.

In crypto PKCS12 is the standard for signatures and certificates.

And PEM is base64 encoded data. In order for this conversion to work
you require to
provide a private key to decrypt and re encrypt.

BIO stands for Basic I/O which is used by OpenSSL for all I/O operations.

You have to provide the private key using one of OpenSSL switches like
-key or something.

And you have to provide the password with which you encrypted your private key.

Usually private keys are encrypted.

OpenSSL is no joke as it contains all the aspects of crypto. It used
to be the only
free crypto tool till OpenSSH came along but even now OpenSSH does not
provide many things that OpenSSL provides. In fact it is built on top
of OpenSSL.

Subject: [Ilugc] pictures to video using mplayer
Message-ID: <BANLkTim+ncvM+_i5JKC1cRP0YNsJczXK1g@mail.gmail.com>

There are several things that trip the unwary.

This is the command that worked for me:

$ mencoder mf://out-*jpg -mf w=300:h=400:fps=2:type=jpg -ovc lavc
-lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:mbd=2:trell copy -oac copy -o f.avi

And before this I ensured that all pictures are of the same aspect
ratio. Obviously my pictures were of various aspect ratios.

You have to use ImageMagick like this:

$ convert i.jpg -resize !300x400 out-i.jpg

Only then the resizing will be done without minding about the aspect ratio.

You can create a video only using images of the same width and height.
Use the identify(1) command of ImageMagick
for ensuring this:

$ identify out-*
out-MadhubanBKWSUOmShantiBawan.jpg JPEG 300x400 300x400+0+0 8-bit
DirectClass 39.1kb
out-Navnath1.jpg[1] JPEG 300x400 300x400+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 46kb
out-Potala.jpg[2] JPEG 300x400 300x400+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 57kb


Do you see that they all are 300x400

Of course I wrote a script like this from the command line itself.

for i in *jpg
do
convert $i -resize !300x400 out-$i
done

Thanks Girish for your reply. Here, I just want to add something which may
help you all to get the actual picture of my error.
I am trying to convert my one pem file to pkcs12 format using the command,
but I am getting the error:

"No certificate matches private key"*
*
I am using the command:
*openssl pkcs12 -export -in *filename.pem* -inkey *
ds.server.info_privatekey.pem* -out *outfile.pkcs12* -name alias

*Here:   *1. filename.pem --> concatenated file of "certificate" and "RSA
private key"
           2. ds.server.info_privatekey.pem --> the privatekey file
           3. outfile.pkcs12 --> the desired output file. *

What should I do now?

But I don't want to save intermediate image files. I want to use named

Thanks. This is useful in transcoding a video file, but when I input images
(concatenated) through named pipe it messes up the video.

Hello All,

The two days Hands-on Workshop on FOSS was conducted by FSFTN with 
FOSSIS User Group of Kalasalingam University on 9th and 10th April 2011 
at Kalasalingam University.

It was nice session, as it was fully hands on it was more interactive. 
More freshers are recruited for the World of Open Source.

We also conducted Guest Lecture for 3rd Year IT Students on FOSS.

Finally the discussion session went on very nice and both the FSFTN 
Volunteers and FOSSIS members had good discussion.

Thanks for FSFTN Volunteers,

Message-ID: <BANLkTikucS1Ag5ZgX3uhg4g5q7e_w-Ww5A@mail.gmail.com>

The recent update to the flashplugin-installer package in Ubuntu
(10.04) Lucid Lynx has change how Adobe caches temporary downloaded
flash video (flv) for playback in browsers. Although there are many
software available to download the flash video but copying from /tmp
directory is the most easiest and convenient for me.

The solution for me is to downgrade the flashplugin-installer in my
Ubuntu machine so i can use back the feature.

   1. Run Synaptic Package Manager.
   2. Search for flashplugin-installer.
   3. Select the flashplugin-installer package.
   4. Goto Package > Force Version.
   5. Select 10.0.45.2ubuntu1 version.
   6. Hit Apply to downgrade the package version.
   7. After the downgrade, goto Package > Lock Version.

*First*: There are two ways to virtualize.

1 - Desktop applications used to virtualize: These basically install a
module (which plays the role of a hypervisor) into the running OS and pass
most calls to hardware using that module. These are quite effective for very
*small *business needs / *testing */ *personal *use etc.


2 - Bare metal: These are more like customized kernels combined along with a
Hypervisor and installed as an OS on the hardware. These are *Enterprise
Oriented* solutions.


Now for your question:

*VmWare* is I believe the longest running virtual enterprise solution
provider and considered most reliable for the same.
They provide both Desktop application as well as bare-metal virtualization
solutions. Both are really good/fast/(lot of features) in their respective
arenas.

*XenServer*: Considered next best. They introduced the concept of
para-virtualization. Newer solution compared to VMWare, however it is also
very effective.
XenServer comes as Baremetal solution. They have also tied up with various
companies like Redhat which release a customized Kernel with the Xen
Hypervisor.

*VirtualBox*: This is a desktop solution from SUN (now oracle). This is
fast, but I don't think it has as many features as VmWare desktop solution.
This is *not* a Bare Metal solution.

*Qemu*: Desktop solution. Very Very slow. You will find this, when you try
to install VMs using just Qemu, not kvm-qemu.
*
KVM*: This too is a desktop solution. Basically uses qemu to virtualize,
however, the qemu-kvm module is 100 times faster than just the qemu module.
Again not many features, but good solution.

*Virtio*: I dont know.

Ashish

Although KVM  can be deployed both on a server class as well as
desktop class sytems, most deployments are on server class systems.
Some of the big companies are betting their revenue stream on
solutions based on KVM.   Please visit the links in Rahul Sundaram's
post in this thread.  To me they look like mission critical
deployments.

> *Virtio*: I dont know.

This is the kernel driver to optimize disk and network I/O for KVM.
Comes native in Linux kernel.  Therefore, for Linux Guest OS, one can
have virtual disks and the NICs, with virtio drivers; it works out of
the box.  For Windows guest OS, you need to install the Windows virtio
drivers to be able to see the HDD devices (no personal experience
though).

Subject: [Ilugc] [ILUGC] INSTALLING UBUNTU ALONGSIDE AN EXISTING OS
Message-ID: <BANLkTimPfBcdr6rUSde8pkTsP0tFdvYuFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Friends,

I had installed ubuntu 10.10 on my windows PC (WUBI) inside windows. I had
to reinstall my windows so I installed the ubuntu directly onto the hard
disk using the option 'alongside the existing OS'. This asked me to select
whether to install on the whole disk or the largest partition on the disk. I
went on with the latter. After the installation, I could see the windows 7
on the boot options, but i cannot boot into it. I think the ubuntu has
changed the filesystem into ext3/ext4 for the whole disk instead of that
partition alone. This makes me now inaccessible to the windows 7. This seems
different from the previous installations of the ubuntu which never gave me
this problem. And the other problem now is, I cannot see the other
partitions from ubuntu. My hard disk is of 1TB memory. Now what ubuntu says
me is the whole disk is free(945GB). But i have almost of 700GB important
data in the drive.

I need some help in recovering this. Also in installing the ubuntu alongside
other OS.

Thanks and Regards,
Manoj Kumar

Hi manoj,

I think you have formatted the whole harddisk & installed ubuntu.

>This seems

>this problem.

First time you just installed ubuntu as a software in your windows machine
so no problem came to you, But next time you installed the ubuntu in your
harddisk (here you have formatted the whole hard disk into ext3/ ext4).

I dont know how to backup data from a formatted disk, someother here can
help you.

Balaji sivanath

Hi balaji, 

Thank you for the input. But I am sure that only the largest partition(131gb) was selected and formatted while installing. That is the option i selected too. 

I am as good as dead if i cannot recover the data. I thought ubuntu was going to behave the same way as it was behaving before. 

Any thoughts over this?

Thanks, 
Manoj kumar

       That page doesn't load for me. But looking at the URL and the
context, Kenneth is asking you not to top post. The proper way is to
do interleaved posting. Since you have been top-posting even in your
reply mails, Kenneth made the comment that you haven't read the
link(And it doesn't even load for me). Thanks

PS: If it doesn't load up for you, please try

http://blog.narendrasisodiya.com/2011/04/list-of-74-indian-colleges-from-indian.html

After 20 years, GNU/Linux is able to create a space in Indian Colleges.
Here is the list of 74 Indian Colleges, where we have GNU/Linux users and
FOSS activities.
I have a good network over colleges and students all over India. But this
list must be small and many colleges will be missing.

If you want to add your name or your college's name then Please let me know

You need to have NVidia / ATI card in the host which supports 3D rendering,
I guess.

     Please add Thiagarajar College of Engineering[1], Madurai(Tamil
Nadu) to the list. It's been using GNU/Linux for a long time now and
has it's own GLUG(Glugot[2]) that's been active for over 6-7 years.
Along with GLUG-Madurai, it has been celebrating the Software Freedom
day as FStival[3]. TCE has been predominantly using Debian[4]. And,
more recently it organised the FossConf'09. Thanks

Message-ID: <BANLkTimfF+c3HdLOYrzubF7m4tMZSVkgtA@mail.gmail.com>

One of my friends concern is planning to migrate to Ubuntu fully. They need
the following options

1. A Master os should be capable of the following things
   a. Monitoring the remote PC. ie able to see client window and control it.
   b. Install packages from server. ie something like synaptic to install
packages on client.
   c. Disable and Enable remote USB devices.

I need some help in finding the tools which perform the action below

As far now i found
iTalc for client desktop monitoring

But i am not able to find any solutions for b, c.

To disable pendrive, we can change permission of media drive or even we can
disable usb driver but how can we do this in remote. I need an automated
tool for these.

Please suggest me some...

Hi,
Y'day my old motherborad was burnt and I need to buy a new one. Can someone 
recommend a motherboard supporting LINUX and Windows versions. I was using Intel 
genuine 845GVSR. My processor is Intel P4 2.8GHz. and 1 GB RAM.

Apart from that, when I assemble new mother board to CPU, will my HDD contents 
will remain same? If not, is there a way to take backup of my 2 HDDs (40GB + 80 
GB) data?

Kindly suggest as I need to up the system asap.

Kind Regards,

The data in your existing HDD will be available if you use the same
hard disk. Changing the motherboard doesn't do anything to the data in
your hard disk.

Yes it used to be good. If it is still available you can buy it.

Generally Intel mobos are good. They last, under warranty apparently you can
get replacement and though their fan design is bad Intel is still good
from other
angles.

For UNIXes Intel is a good choice.

But then you need to also think about processor compatibility and
RAM(DDR3 and so on).

There are two issues with your reply - Your mail client is sending the
reply to a thread as a separate mail instead of as a part of the
original thread (maybe because it uses 'RE:' to mark replies instead
of the usual 'Re:' but I am not sure about it). The other thing is
you're not properly quoting the email before replying to it, when you
quote 2 lines, actually the quote symbol is present only in the first
line which will wrongly imply that you typed the second line as a part
of the reply. I request you to consider fixing these issues before
replying to emails. :)

I understand your question to be something like this:

You had both Ubuntu and Windows 7 installed, and you re-installed
windows 7(in the same partition as before). You are not able to boot
into GNU/Linux.

Assuming that's what you intended to ask, please have a look at [1]
which talks about recovering Ubuntu after installing windows.

And more importantly, please give as much information as possible when
you post a question to a mailing list. If you just ask how to restore
Ubuntu after installing Windows 7, how do we know what steps you took
to install win 7. What if you had erased the whole disk and installed
it? So, please be specific with the questions. You can read up this
link[2] on how to ask questions. Thanks

bhaskar, linux expert systems, should be able to add many more colleges --
especially the ones where he had set up FOSS Labs and/or conducted FOSS
programs.

i am also compiling a list -- though it has slightly different entries, with
lecturer focus than student contact. will get back to you, i hope, within a
week or ten days.
with best wishes
Srinivasan.

I have a feeling he copied the content, and sent a new mail to the list.
The message does not have the "References" header. Cannot blame the client,

This is more annoying to see this again and again. As soon as I saw your 
name I could guess that you are going to talk about mailing list 
Guidelines . Though mailing list ethics has to be followed , donot 
insist it everytime.

Subject: [Ilugc] SSH - Command
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=kcK1n3=Kt1ntw2mY2VV=ygRTTdg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am executing the below ssh command. It requires to run a specific script
on the remote host with sudo su. However the first prompt for password comes
by fine, however it automatically accepts some value for the second prompt,
i.e. for the sudo prompt.

$cat hostlist | while read hostnam; do ssh ashish@$hostnam sudo su -c
./comm1; done
ashish at 10.21.102.32's password:
Password:
Sorry, try again.
Password:
Sorry, try again.
Password:
Sorry, try again.
sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts


How do I make it to wait for my input? Moreover if I run just the command,
i.e. without the while loop it runs fine.


Regards,
Ashish

Answer is simple. Do passwordless public key login with ssh.

And you should never have password prompts in shell scripts unless
 you are setting a password or it is an interactive script.

uh!?

I know. Removing the context totally also makes it very difficult to
relate to the response. And this is a bottom post too. I wonder how a
response can neither be top posted  nor bottom posted. Or if it is a
joke that I spoilt, then forgive me.

interleaved posting - it is clearly described in the mailing list
guidelines. Or see here:

Hi,
 I'm using Ubuntu 10.10 and I have installed dnsmasq to resolve local domain
say www.example.com. In dnsmasq I have configured these settings.

address=/example.com/127.0.0.1
listen-address=192.168.0.3

The dnsserver is my laptop on which I have my xampp too. On my laptop I have
given 192.168.0.3 as default DNS and it works fine. when I type
www.example.com on Browser.

On my desktop I'm running Windows which is having 192.168.0.2 IP. But the
desktop is not resolving www.example.com
I have changed default DNS to 192.168.0.3 and these two machine are
connected via mtnl router and also I'm able to ping vise versa.

You have pointed example.com to localhost, on the Windows machine
example.com resolves to itself and not your Unbutu box.  Perhaps you
should be resolving example.com to 192.168.0.3 instead?


If you are using just 2 hosts and a single domain, it is easier to edit
/etc/hosts on the client machines.  Windows uses a Unix style hosts
file in c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts.


Please avoid cross posting.

Please web search for "mailman reply to". This leads to a web page
which discusses what you want, as well as the pros and cons of
implementing that change.

In the admin interface, under the section "Reply-To: header munging" just
change the option "Where are replies to list messages directed?" to "This
list".

This works fine for me. I didn't have to change any other setting.

I think, you should explain the problem a little bit more in detail.
What exactly is the server running on?

Apache is not a Java WebSerer, and so has nothing to do with JKS.

Tomcat, JBoss, etc... are all Java based webservers and require a JKS
for the security.

Subject: [Ilugc] Authentication Failure Issue
Message-ID: <BANLkTikE1wtiZFG1jN1bF-L2U3057dQCCQ@mail.gmail.com>

OS: Ubuntu 10.10 (Meerkat Maverick)

When i try to install any package via " Ubuntu Software Center " , it will
usually ask for Authentication for non-root users.

But now a days it doesn't wait for User Inputs and the Authentication window
appears and shakes itself and say authentication failure and i get some
messages like below:


" An error occurred while checking for authorizations:
Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include:
the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy
blocked the reply,
the reply timeout expired,or the network connection was broken.
You may report this as a bug. "

Note: Few days back i unknowingly changed the permission for /usr directory
using chmod command and then i solved that problem by using live cd and
logged in as root and changed the permission to 755.

Please can any one provide me the solution for my above problem?

Here is the original contact page.

I new to renew the cert of my server, which I renewed from CAcert.org. Here,
I want to add one that, java is there in that server anyway.
Now, I have new jks which consists of newer data and time and address of
this server. I have generated jks, now I need to deploy these jks there in
that server, may be I have to use "keytool" or something like that. I am not
sure.

My question is: I have those jks which consists of latest data,time, private
key of that domain and cert certificate. Now, I need to deploy this jks
there in that server ( which domain name has been renewed ). I am not sure
how can I do that, so any kind of help regarding "jks implementation" is
needed.

Check and change the permissions of /usr/bin/software-center.

Mine is as below.

ls -lh /usr/bin/software-center
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 40 2010-10-29 12:51 /usr/bin/software-center ->

rubbish - you were looking for some specific information about IEEE -

You should have properly tagged the email as OT and you are not
quoting the email properly and modifying the quoted text and the name
of the person you're replying to. You could have a look at the mailing

Well, I had replied to Zico on his ID alone, and then realized that
the group was not in copy. So, i forwarded the same mail, with a note

Subject: [Ilugc] How to find the source of packet loss
Message-ID: <BANLkTimSXHno2+yEGWw=-=35nzZZKbWFiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everybody

I am not sure if this is the correct forum to discuss this so kindly
ignore this email if you find the topic irrelevant for this forum.

Recently we have started facing issue in our network where in if we
initiate a Video Conference ( we use Video Nation Life Size VC
equipment ) we see packet loss which goes upto 40% and jitters which
goes upto 100ms . This packet loss is only on incoming packets. So the
voice and video quality is very bad at our end however the person at
the other end is able to see and hear us very clearly. If we look at
the VC statistics, we can see that we are uploading at around 1 mbps
however the download starts at 1 mbps but then drops down to 100kbps
within seconds . Same is the case with skype calls .

Now one of the reasons I am posting over here is that all our network
traffic goes via a debian box ( 5.0.4 ) which acts as the firewall.
The cpu utilization on the firewall is not high at all. This debian
box also acts as a vpn server and we have two VPN tunnel to connect to
our office in the UK . Also we use quagga ( ofpfd ) to route traffic
over the tunnels. Also I have checked statistics ( ethtool -S eth1 )
of eth1 ( which is our internet link ) and it shows no error either on
rx or tx . All our internal network are on various vlans on eth2 and
there are no errors on it too.

We have reported this issue to our ISP and they changed our route a
couple of times ( even the reverse route was changed ) however it did
not resolve the issue. Finally we bypassed our firewall and put the VC
equipment on a public IP ( its on a different subnet than our firewall
) and we are not facing the issue any more ( I still have to check
which route it follows to the Video Nation gateway and compare it with
the route our firewall follows ) .

Now I know that there has been no change in our network which could
have caused this issue. However now the ISP says that the issue might
be because of our firewall .

Can someone let me know if there are any tools which can help me
troubleshoot this issue. Something that can let me know the point at
which there are packet loss. Also please let me know if I should be
looking at .

Regards
Preetish

Is there any way to run a script when a usb is plugged into the system.

I am not asking about autorun. Whenever a usb is attempting to get mounted i
need to get an notification to mail or something else. Similar to that of
PAM any option is available to USB devices.

Similarly is there any script to enable and disable usb from server to
client.

Girish,

I do not have control over that setup, i.e. I cannot change the SSH
installation or functionality. So was looking for an alternative.

Good. ;)

Normally download speeds are higher.

There is not enough information in this mail albeit long.

And this is a complex issue.

Some ways to attack this are:

1) Try turning off connection tracking and other stuff in the Debian
box and see
 how the network performs

2) Try  a simple command line wget or something and find out what is
happening.

3) Monitor the bandwidth in the Debian box and afterwards. Find out if
something
goes wrong in between

There are 100 other ideas I can give.

But you have to do it.

1. paramiko is excellent.

2. expect   e.g. http://bash.cyberciti.biz/security/expect-ssh-login-script/

Use MTR. It combines traceroute and ping, gives you hop-by-hop
information as the packet travels, and most importantly packet loss at
each node.

I presume you may be aware that the CBSE Computer Science/IT syllabus has
been made vendor neutral. There were some training programs conducted in
this respect -- which your IT teacher might have attended.

CDAC participated in the master training program (held in Delhi) and is now
interacting with CBSE re IT enablement for science, maths and social
sciences.

could you please give the contact details -- yourself and IT teacher -- so
that we could discuss further re CDAC activities in this regard. you could
respond to my cdac id : srinivasans at cdac.in

Sorry couldn't provide much information. Was trying to keep the email
short ( I guess failed in that too :( ) . Well, we basically shut down
all the services which this box runs ( except VPN, quagga, iptables )
however it did not resolve the issue. I have enabled sysstat on the
system and will be monitoring it .

We do not have any issue with downloads, the problem is with the
incoming UDP packets ( voice and video ). I downloaded f14 iso
yesterday and was getting a speed of 1 mbps .

Thanks. I ran MTR and did see that there are packet loss on certain
hops ( outside our ISP's AS ) I have created a video and sent it to
the ISP. Lets see what they have to say.

1) what happens if you do video calls within your network? this should help
you
figure out if it an issue with ISP or internal issue.

2) sometimes there is bandwidth cap on the incoming data - imposed by
certain ISPs -
check if there any such with your ISP.

3) Does it happen only for video calls? what happens if you use wget ?

Your ISP will counter this through your own admission that if you remove
your debian firewall the problem is resolved.

Plus, problems outside your ISP's AS are beyond their control anyway. There
is little they can do about it.

I think you should investigate along the lines that your debian firewall is
broken.

Put the Life Size end point outside the firewall, but in the same public ip
subnet/gateway as your firewall. If it works okay, then your firewall is
definitely the issue. Ensure it's connected to the same CPE router and all
other WAN equipment.

Also suspect the CPE router hardware and config. What router are you using
if any?

Are you running the VC traffic through a VPN tunnel during production use?

A small network diagram would help understanding your setup.

You will need LDAP + Kerberos for SSO.

> 2. User Home directory in centralized server

This is possible with LDAP.

(a) On the openDS server, check if it is listening (netstat -nutlp),
(b) Check if there are any iptables rules preventing connection to the
LDAP server.
(c) try connecting to the LDAP server with queries like "ldapsearch"
from some other node in the network.
(d) Finally try "user auth"

Hello all,
I have connected my netbook (running
Debian 6) to my Nokia handset (BSNL 3G) for net browsing with
bluetooth.



Step 1: Connect phone to netbook
(follow steps in system &gt; Preferences &gt; Bluetooth &gt; setup
new device)



Step 2: Find Mac address of phone and
channel for Dial-up networking (DUN)
$ hcitool scan
$ sdptool browse  00:2B:1C:A1:DB:C4



Step 3: Ping mac address to see if
connected / alive
$l2ping 00:2B:1C:A1:DB:C4



Step 4: Create rfcomm0 in /dev/ by
editing preexisting file /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf



Step 5: Create configuration file for
establishing connection (edit prexisitng configuration file
/etc/ppp/peers/provider)



Step 6: Edit chatscript file
/etc/chatscripts/pap



Step 7: Restart netbook



Step 8: Start connection ?pon
provider?. Start internet browser.



Step 9: To disconnect ?poff provider?



I am facing problem at step 3. Whenever
I try to ping phone it aborts by saying ?Can't connect: host is
down?. I am unable to start conncetion with ?pon provider?.
Only after forcing netbook to connect / revive-the-connection with
phone (by sending a small file, with bluetooth to phone, when it
connects and transfers data successfully) I am able to ping
successfully / initiate conncetion with ?pon provider?. However,
once established, internet connection runs without hindrance. Any
repeat attempts to connect again have to go through the same ritual
of forcing netbook to revive the connection with phone.



Is there any way I can bring the
bluetooth conncetion to life without having having to send a small
dummy file from netbook to phone over and over again?

No. The reply was for OP. I quoted his mail and replied right? Still you got
confused. That is why you should read mailing list guidelines and follow
them! Do not top post. Do use punctuations. Go and read guidelines(
http://www.ilugc.in/content/mailinglist-guidelines) before replying to any
mail in future.

Hi,

I am trying to connect to the internet using an USB modem.
Tried with a Vodafone and Docomo SIMs, both which work in a mobile phone.
After authentication, it fails giving
*PCP: timeout sending Config-Requests*

Any pointers? The details are below...

Try changing:
Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","portalnmms"

This works for me.

Mine is Compaq Presario V6000 Series (AMD Athlon X2 64 TK-55), me too 
experienced some glitches with Ubuntu i386 (To be true, ubuntu really 
sucks you know..). Switched to Debian x86_64 (Testing) ~2 years before. 
Solid as it is.

But there are some minor things out there If you are using x86_64 
architecture.

1. Flash is the biggest problem, seems they stopped developing 
flashplayer for linux 64bit.

2. Google-earth, skype, googletalk-plugin don't have 64bit version. you 
can install it, but libc32 and lot of core 32bit libraries will be 
installed along with them. So, your system's 64bit purity will be gone.

I would suggest go for Mint LMDE x86_64.

Thanks,
Mohan R

Hello Alok,

I have been using my mobile phone in Ubuntu for over a year now. I hope this
solution will work for you. This solution instead of using "ping" to check
every time instead uses "bind" to perform pairing like thing. Kindly go
through the forum post of the link below.

Try changing portalnmms to www. If you're using Vodafone Mobile
Connect, this should work.

Thanks. It seems "portalnmms" is for mobile phones. "www" is for modems.
But it still is not working. I am also in touch with the modem supplier.
I will keep the list posted.

Afaik, portalnmms and www are used for different connections -
Vodafone live! and Vodafone Mobile Connect respectively. Since you're
trying to access internet from a computer, you must have the latter.
Hence the suggestion.

If it's going to shed any light on the matter, the folks at the
vodafone call center don't know what wvdial is. ;)

Hi,
   I think it would be a lot better if a forum was set up for ILUGC, rather
than this mailing list for doubts and queries. Most of the time, the reply
for a question would be 'Please read the mailing list guidelines', which is
really frustrating for most users. Or any other better substitution for this
mailing list?

Imho, "Please read the mailing list guidelines" is an essential
learning curve that we recommend all the members should go through. As
much as 'Please read the mailing list guidelines' is frustrating for
most of the n00b members of this list, constant abuse of the mailing
list guidelines by the members is as frustrating to the rest. So
please go through the mailing list guidelines, understand them fully
before trying to post on the list, so that you can spare everyone the
redundant "Please follow the mailing list guidelines" reminders.

Even a forum for a user group like ILUGC will have some guidelines to
be followed, which the members have to be aware of before posting. So
just already read and understand the mailing list guidelines and spare
us the effort to remind and yourselves the frustration of getting
reminded.

This is my Rs.1 to this discussion.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

I agree and I think mailing list guidelines are very imp in daily life 
as well. It teaches how to have an organised/structured communication. 
In my personal/editorial life I follow the same structure and it
makes life easier to understand what's going on.

Hi,
 this is a bad news for system administrators like me who are depend upon Amazon EC2 cloud environment. The service of N.Virginia region was down from yesterday. The status was reported at http://status.aws.amazon.com/.

For those who maintain multiple instance in multiple region through load balancer, this type of system crash is not a big issue. But for us who maintain a single instance creates a big problem.

Hi all,
Please suggest me a GNU/Linux distribution with following features:

1. After installing it with CD/DVD, most of packages available for it can
be installed from same or another CD/DVD. High speed Internet connection
should not be required for installing default packages available for it.

2. It should not be much resource consuming. Should work on an old system
such as P-IV with low amount of RAM such as 512MB.

3. Latest version of LAMP related packages should be available on it.

4. It should support Tata Indicom Photon Plus connection.

5. Codes of common audio and video format should be available on it by
default.

6. Upgradation process of it should be easy with the CD/DVD of current
version.

Best Regards ...

Choose a DVD distro. Nowadays there are many livecd distros for Linux.

Codecs? mplayer can play everything but Debian and mplayer do not get along.

I had trouble compiling the source. It was failing in some libavcodec
header file.

I wonder. If you can get some deb for it it will be good.

Upgrading?

Why?

Normally I just reinstall when a new release happens.

Most Linux distros are resource unfriendly.

Or I would say poor unfriendly.

Unfortunately linux which was meant to be resource
friendly as that was its raison d etre was diverted to
serve other interests by trying to be everything
for everybody.

At any rate I  believe you are wrong.

Mint is resource  hungry.

Like one of those Live distros.

Live  distros serve a completely different purpose than
  resource utilization on a low end machine.

The two should never be mixed and one cannot achieve both.

So Mint does a good job of out of box functionality on different hardware
 configurations.

You can't get low end hardware use with this as the goal.

What is your aversion to CLI tools if it gets the job done?   Most GUI

I don't thing that it is correct.

I have a CentOS server which run as a virtual machine( KVM) and it only
consume 12 MB of RAM.

It depends on us to choose the packages while OS installation. If you remove
unwanted default packages which you doesn't need while installation, you can
run Linux easily with low memory.

I am also using Debian Lenny (as base OS for Virtualization) and I didn't
install any X window component on it.

This Debian machine hardly consume 250 MB while no Virtual machine is
running on top of it.

If you outsource your infrastructure,  a certain level of lack of

you are left exposed.  Welcome to the cloud.

No, this is only bad news for sysadmin's who either don't understand the 
technology they are using ( does it surprise you that 'cloud' is still 
just a bunch of computers in a DC ?), or just failed to put in place 
safeguards that were needed ( if they were not needed, its no problem 
when services are down right ? )

Looking at stuff like this :

No..never..!! By mistake I have created only one node that is why I was facing that problem.

Now I have solved that problem by creating another instance after taking backup(snapshot) of root device(EBS) of old instance and creating new root device(EBS) for newly created instance.

The new instance is running now just like old instance with all old data.

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=POR7Zh0pihbJFO81pYSLwv-v2uw@mail.gmail.com>

This month, we had good talks about Scilab, MultiFlow and CollabNet
Subversion Edge.

Dhanushkodi [ dhanush AT techpassiontech DOT com ], CEO of TechPassion
(www.techpassiontech.com), demonstrated about SciLab.

Scilab is an open source, cross-platform numerical computational
package and a high-level, numerically oriented programming language.
It can be used for signal processing, statistical analysis, image
enhancement, fluid dynamics simulations, numerical optimization, and
modeling and simulation of explicit and implicit dynamical systems.
MATLAB code, which is similar in syntax, can be converted to Scilab.
Scilab is one of several open source alternatives to MATLAB.
Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scilab

He demonstrated on solving the maths equations, visualizing and its
engineering toolkits.
He explained how it can be used as alternate to MATLAB in the
organizations and colleges.
His organization uses SciLab heavily to solve the engineering problems.
TechPassion provides commercial support and training for SciLab.
Colleges can approach him for the SciLab Training.

Next,
Suki Venkat, [ suki.venkat AT gmail DOT com ], working in TNQ Books and Journals
Pvt Ltd, Chennai, demonstrated his Free Open Source Software "MuLTiFlow".

This XUL application can be used both as astandalone and as a Firefox addon.
The editor can handle Math (MathML) and Graphics (SVG) markup and also
has a input mechanism for UTN28 (modern version of TeX).
The editor has a locale switch for 11 languages.

The code can be downloaded from the following SourceForge URL:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/multiflow/

It is under GPL v3 license.

As the original author, Suki explained all the features.
Most of the WYSIWYG editors available in open source lack in unicode
font rendering.
As MuLTiFlow is based on Mozilla Firefox, it shows all the fonts as
shown in browser.
We can use this application, to design/develop the web pages and for publishing.


---

Then,
Jeyanthan, a Technical Engineer working for CollabNet, explained about
the Free Open Source Software "Subversion Edge" by CollabNet.

CollabNet Subversion Edge includes everything you need
to install, manage and operate a Subversion server.  It includes all
of the Subversion and  Apache binaries needed to run a Subversion
server.  It also integrates the popular ViewVC repository browsing
tool so that users can view repository history from a web browser.

CollabNet Subversion Edge also includes a powerful web-based
management console that makes it easy to configure and manage your
Apache server and Subversion repositories.

Link :  http://www.open.collab.net/go/csvne2_r2a/

video : http://www.open.collab.net/nonav/go/csvne2_r2a/watch-video.html?_=d


Jeyanthan explained the features of Subversion Edge. He showed the web
based user interface, creating users, managing repositories and giving
permissions.

His presentation is available here.

Hi All,

I am working with an NGO M S Swaminathan Research
Foundation<http://mssrf.org>who works to provide Information,
Education, Communication and Technology
for Rural India. They also work into other scientific solutions to
Agriculture, Bio-Diversity and Food Security.

They provide basic computer education to students(in vacation time) of some
rural areas of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Orissa and Maharashtra.

They are teaching Microsoft Potential Unlimited Program, Intel Learning
Program and one program designed by Azim Premzi Foundation.

As you know, most of the Indians living in rural areas. Are we, the Linux
community, already doing something, similar to that, in rural areas?

Thanks

         I remember Kenneth talking about creating scripts that would
detect top posts and then stop them even before they are delivered.
But I am not sure if he was suggesting it as an option or if he has
already started writing one. Thanks

My laptop has Debian 6.0 and mplayer binary works out of the box. You
should have following entry in /etc/apt/sources.list

deb http://mirrors.kernel.org/debian/ squeeze main non-free contrib

and

$ sudo aptitude install mplayer 

will do

It is an internship/Job opportunity for students, who has some FOSS
tool experience. So please don't go into that and ask what they are
going to do at their office.

True. Gmail is not all free software but no one is publicizing Gmail
or asking people to use Gmail on this list. But the post by the OP was
for an internship opportunity for students that wasn't even properly
tagged as per the mailing list guidelines. Normally 'proprietary
software' is decried on this list and advertising it on this mailing
list is bound to elicit questions of this nature. That is my Rs.1 to
this discussion and I stop here not to encourage extraneous
discussions.

P.S. Please follow the mailing list guidelines
(http://www.ilugc.in/content/mailinglist-guidelines) and avoid
over-quoting.

They did not advertise proprietary software on this list. No more than you
are advertising GMail. Infact, since you clearly mention @gmail.com id in
your mail signature, you are advertising proprietary software more than the
original post that leads you to a website which has a FAQ where proprietary
is mentioned.

I believe this is an extraneous discussion, initiated by you.

Hi,

My apologies for not following the mailing list guidelines.
I would like to answer the couple of questions that were raised
in regards to my previous mail.

" I see a statement in the FAQ that reads:
\"We use proprietary natural language processing algorithms to
determine sentiment.\"
So, I would like to know if this is an free open source venture or a
proprietary one. Also, please let us know what has this got to do with
GNU/Linux or Free software. "

Thanks for trawling our website yesterday. We hope you enjoyed it.
Yes, Its true that our NLP algorithms are proprietary, patent-pending,
result of 'n' years of cutting edge research and development, etc, etc.
and Yes, We expect people to pay in return for using our software.

But, the reason of my mail to this group was not to advertise the
technologies
that we work on. Which words in my mail conveyed that information to the
group?
All we wanted was to reach out to students who have strong exposure to
programming and are passionate about FOSS. These students will be
contributing to one
open source project that we are releasing this summer. The best part is that
they can
continue working on the project even when they go back to their colleges,
highly rewarding
jobs, etc, etc. You learn. We learn. Win-win. We use and contribute to few
FOSS tools in
our work, and hence we care about people contributing to open source.

Being inquisitive is part of human nature, but it does become tiresome
hearing/reading
these same questions over and over again. If one is interested in what we
do, just ask.
I would be more than happy to walk you through.

Thanks,
Devjyoti

there was no mention about any FOSS projects in the OPs email.

     Well, I am not sure how others on this will respond. But
patenting software has been one of the foremost that things that the
free software community has been against.

        You might have misunderstood a few things. Free software
doesn't mean free of cost. It is "Free" as in Freedom or Free speech.
No one stops you from making money with a free software. You can
expect people to pay money for the support that you offer for the
software.

        I was merely asking what has the internship got to do with
free software. But after Bharathi's reply, I decided not to press on
further. But the other mails in the thread made me do so :(

        If you had mentioned this one line in the original mail, the
whole thread would have been avoided. You did not mention the fact
that they would be working on an open source project.

         I am sorry that it caused some grievances, but which part of
my mail was bad ? I merely asked what the internship had got to do
with FOSS and mentioned that your site speaks of proprietary software.
It was a simple question that you could have answered. Thanks

Likewise, it is unlikely to find enterprises that are 100% FOSS.  Some
of the solutions may be 100% FOSS which the OP has clarified.
Tagging of the thread could have been appropriate which the OP has
also apologized for.

Also, +1 to Bharathi Subramanian's comment.

Hi,

Balachandran, I'm sorry if you felt that my email was harsh but these are
things that I needed to say. I agree that I should have been more vocal in
our advertisement for internship. I did not mention that they would be
working on an open source project because many of these students carry a
false notion of FOSS. Some think its equivalent of working with an NGO and
they will never make enough money ever. So we had decided to keep that
information under wraps till the time of the interviews.

We simply sell our software. Thats what our business model is. Thats how we
keep the Gods happy. And patenting the software is just to keep us safe from
the mammoths like IBM, MS, or SAP, who we compete with. But we also try to
give back to the FOSS community, that we have relied on so heavily till this
day.

We are starting another initiative where we are going to open our office on
the weekends for FOSS enthusiasts who want to meet like minded people
contribute to any open source project on Search/Data Mining/Machine Learning
(our areas of work, as the passion to learn is the only ROI here).

Best Regards,
Devjyoti

Please follow the mailing list guidelines
(http://www.ilugc.in/content/mailinglist-guidelines) and avoid top
posting. Interleaved, trimmed posting is the recommended style. This
is because the emails are archived in threads and there is no need to
preserve the context, albeit redundantly, in every reply. Also
interleaved, trimmed posting is more suited for conversations because
it follows the order in which people normally read text.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Hey

I'm pleased to announce that there are (at least) 17 selected GSoC
students from India!

Just to go down the memory lane, these are approximate figures off the
top of my head and to the best of my knowledge:
2007 -- 3
2008 -- 3
2009 -- 3
2010 -- 11
2011 -- 17
That looks good, doesn't it?

More so, my forensic analysis (which is rather inaccurate TBH) reveals
that we had at least about 49 applications from Indian candidates!

Akarsh

Thanks for the suggestions and sorry for the delay in my response. I
put the VC on a public IP in the same subnet and did not face any
issue. Then I connected the VC behind our firewall again and I am not
facing any issue. Even the skype works fine now. I have not made any
changes to our firewall so I assume that there was an issue at the
ISP's end or some other AS which the support engineers I was talking
to were not aware of and now that has been fixed. I would be
monitoring the VC which is presently behind the firewall again for the
next two days.

Please follow the mailing list guidelines
(http://www.ilugc.in/content/mailinglist-guidelines) and avoid bottom
posting. Interleaved, trimmed posting style is the recommended one on
this list. Trim the content irrelevant to your reply.

Subject: [fpug-c] SICP Lectures
To: damodaran.balaji at gmail.com


Has anybody out in the group gone through the book and/or video lecture series?

Here's the link for those who are new to SICP:
http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/
The book is a free download in pdf form.

I had this idea of screening the lecture videos in a projector?and
solving the coding exercises in a group. Sort of a hackathon.
The code is in Scheme - which is an ancestor of clojure & common lisp.
So any of these 3 languages should be straightforward. Hacking on any
other language is also welcome. Infact, it'd be interesting to compare
solutions from different languages.


If we have enough people showing interest in this, then we can meet
every 2 weeks or so to learn SICP. Let me know what you guys think.

Thanks,
Balaji

      I am not sure what you mean. But if you are talking about the
mails that ask people to follow mailing list guidelines, then I feel
that it is necessary. As all of us see, despite there being lots of
mails asking people to follow guidelines, a lot of people violate
them. Moreover, it is not policing. It is just that a member is
guiding a fellow member towards a better etiquette. And there is
nothing wrong in doing that. Thanks

in fact it is highly insulting and derogatory to use a term like
'policing' when some people try to enforce standards. Please appreciate
that those people are not jobless - they take the time and effort to
educate people on the list (and have to keep stomaching insults also).

Better not at all, than to speeching incorrectly.

PS - list admin, can we update the mailing list guidelines to ban
complaining about the mailing list guidelines, so that we can prevent
people from posting mails like this?

As per your statement there are lot of 'policing' mails these days. Why then
are people still flouting list rules? If they are not reading and following
the guidelines even after repeated mails then being told to do so is a small
price they have to pay. In fact they should be happy that repeat offenders
are not blocked for not taking time to follow rules and there by wasting
everybody else's time.

Nothing stifling in this, IMO

+1. While suggestions for new rules and discussions on list rules are
welcome; asking people not to enforce existing rules are not.

That is correct. I've given a link that had other links about the
online stuff. The whole idea was to watch the videos in a group and
code in a group.

If a person is not into group hacking or feels inclined towards
isolated learning then obviously this will be of no interest to that
person.
If the feeling is that the whole material is old and there is no need
to learn this stuff because MIT replaced the course with python - then
I don't agree on that one.

Here's what people in stackoverflow has to say about this:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/88619/what-do-you-think-about-the-loss-of-mits-6-001-sicp-course

Here's what Norvig says about the book:
http://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262011530&nodeID=&tag=&linkCode=

Infact, I could quote a lot of other sources about why SICP is gold
and not old (:p), but you get the drift.

Finally, if this is not obvious. It is not about learning a new
programming language. This is about learning how to program.

Reminding the rules is a good thing to do . While people do repeated 
mistakes , better send reminder offlist with cc to list admin. While 
repeated mistakes are done , ban them.

Discussing this in list , ruins the time.

When people repeat their mistakes again and again despite the
constant, irritating reminders it means that they aren't bothered
about the reminder to actually try to learn/understand what is being
said and why it is said. People are putting additional effort to
educate the ignorant members and if the offenders can't have the basic
courtesy to get enlightened, then they will have to put up with
repeated reminders to their repeated mistakes imho. And as for as the
OP's email, I would say that 'policing' is an extremely harsh and
unfair word to use for people trying to remind/enlighten the ignorant
about the guidelines; 'reminder' could have been a better and a
neutral word.

fwiw, I am quite pedantic about list policies etc - but I've found that 
most people react better to offlist notices than onlist bashing.

A lot depends on how its said and where its said. Many of these 'efforts 
to enlighten' are just really harsh dig's at people - and mostly dont 
come with an option. eg: one thing that I've found to be productive is 
to actually point out the issue:

'Your email client is not list friend, and is doing >insert problem 
here<. This is considered bad because >add details<. If you dont have 
the option to change your email behaviour, have you considered using a 
web forum like >url to forum< instead ?

9 times out of 10 that gets a result. Either they move to a web forum 
where this isnt that much of an issue ( sometimes ), or they move email 
clients, change behavior or do whats needed to make sure that the issue 
pointed out is fixed.

YES. People should learn from others reply like formatting and signature
styles. If they are NOT learning then there is NO point in being here.
And if we are NOT helping them to learn, then why are we here?

Sometime, few replies are harsh. But no other way :)

what I have noticed is that most people look at the reminder, see that
it has nothing to do with the question they have asked and ignore it. A
few people actually read and try to understand and implement - a lot of
those people contact me offlist for clarification.

I'm guessing this would mostly be applicable to people who are drive-by 
posting and not people who intend to actually drop anchor in the 
list(s). Surely once they have been around for a few weeks and been a 
part of a few threads, they will start to see the value in stuff like 
thread-sanity etc. If not, they really will be better off, more 
productive and cause lesser issues to web forum users; and imho, should 
be pointed in that direction

(sigh) that used to be the case before the advent of gmail - gmail
specialises in 'You Do Not See What You Get', so most gmail users are
not subject to many of the annoyances we face - for example if a guy
does not trim his post, gmail hides it - so no gmail user gets to see
the untrimmed part. In fact I am working on a thesis to show that one
cannot use gmail for a prolonged period of time without significant
brain damage.

You are right. I feel that people who uses the mail less frequent do not 
read all the mails . So they make mistakes. Since most people are using 
gmail, priority inbox do not give importance for replies , when the main 
content is unread.

So people using less frequent do not actually read messages , when the 
topic is not interested.So we must do some alternative to insist ethics 
, like specifying mistake tag in subject line or like.

When we really want ethics , we must remind them in some other means.

Arun Prakash

When a person posts on this list, I guess they will be reading the
replies in the thread they started/participated in, so that they can
get the answers for their question(s). So when someone tells tells the
person to use the correct posting style, I guess it would be read, as
it is a reply to *their* post. We try to remind people about the
mailing list guidelines so that they can learn from their mistakes,
instead of the ideal 'learn from others mistakes'.

One option would be to send personal mails to the person explaining in
detail. But when someone is using "priority inbox" which has its own
super-secret algorithm, how can one be sure that the email will be
read? That is why we remind people in the same thread so that there is
a better chance of people reading it, assuming that in the real world
people would want to read replies in the threads that they have
started/participated in. So in-thread reminders, monthly reminders and
listing the guidelines in the welcome mail are the best options imho
as of now. If you have better, feasible ways to do this and get better
results, do let us know. Till then, I don't think repeated efforts to
educate the ignorant members of the list will have to continue.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

I have been trying a lot, not to get into this thread. But here goes .... :-)

<Premise>
I use GMail, both through web, as well as through KMail. I am a member
of this group since 1998 or 99 albeit mostly silent.
</Premise>

I appreciate the efforts made by a few to have this list as clean as
possible and also educate the new joiners. Good work.

Having said this, I should also say that, it gets plain
boring/considered Spamming/ Irritating, to see the same reply of
"Follow the rules" in 10 different threads, on the same day!
Sometimes, out of personal experience, some people send such "follow
the rules" mails, without even reading the context or checking if the
mails are really following the guidelines.

When a newbie comes and asks a (stupid) question, we generally ask him
to go and search. --> This is GOOD.

When someone else, with not so good experience in moving with the
group, particularly when the language is not up to the mark, we ask
him more questions and help answer the same. Sometimes, the tone is
harsh, but its still acceptable, as we are still helping him/her.

When the same person (as described above), forgets to follow the
rules, we just jump on him/her and scare him/her from asking
questions. Or otherwise, we just irritate them. This IMHO, is not a
good idea.  The best option would be to leave that "policing" (for
want of a better word), to the person who is genuinely trying to
answer the question.


Scenarios:
A, B and C ask some stupid questions/ top posts
P, Q and R are the responders.

P sends a reply to all the 3 threads started by A, B and C, asking
them to follow the rules, without even reading the contents of the
email.

Q Sends a private email with the same "follow the rules"

R sends a genuine reply to the query sent by C, but also advices that
he will stop responding if C doesn't follow the rules in his/her
reply. R does not care about A and B.

In my personal opinion, I consider P as more of Spamming, Q a bit more
OK, but still a "Big Brother", while R to be a "good friend". And, I
think, "R"'s approach would be more healthy than P's. Q's approach is
less irritating to others, but, people have filters :-).

There is one more reason, why P's approach is a bad idea and in fact a
SPAM. When I search for similar queries before asking, I see this
thread X, with 1 reply (in a threaded view). I get excited and open
it, and only to find that it is a "follow the rules" mail. which is
really frustrating, amounting to trolling/spamming.

Now, there is a "D" who is a repeat offender. Kicking him/her out of
the list is a "good idea".

No personal offences meant. Request you to kindly take it in a healthy sense.

with regards,
Natarajan.

Agreed that it is the best option. But if someone's post goes
unanswered/unreplied for some reasonable amount of time, we should let
them know what they are doing wrong and how. Also we should suggest
them ways to do it correct the next time.

The truth is top posting and other things for which there are too many
reminders these days in this list are almost as annoying for a lot of
people, most of who just tolerate it. Most of the people who don't
follow the guidelines this, imho, are people who just follow their
threads, a few don't even follow theirs from what I understood from a
mail in this discussion. The best way to let those people know is to
tell them in the thread. But sadly, some people "follow" the
discussion, reply to it, make the same mistakes. :-(. The repeated
reminders (aka spam according to some of those on this list) is to
just give them a chance to learn, but judging by the volume of
reminders nowadays, I guess the people are filtering out emails or
refusing to learn. I remind people about the guidelines because I see
it as a chance to allow them to learn things not because I want to
police people on the mailing list guidelines and help save some time,
bandwidth and frustration.

I try to be very minimal (because being detailed isn't going to help
imho) and polite while requesting (with 'Please') people to read the
mailing list guidelines since I believe it is nowhere close to 'public
bashing' as mentioned somewhere in this discussion. :-)

> Now, there is a "D" who is a repeat offender. Kicking him/her out of

I don't think it may help as much as really educating the ignorant, imho :-)

> No personal offences meant. Request you to kindly take it in a healthy sense.

There is a lot of constructive feedback for both the parties to take
from your email. :-) My strategy from now on would be to wait for some
time till some
one with an answer to point out the mistakes if any. If there is no
feedback on the mistake for some reasonable amount of time, I will try
to send an off-list mail to the person, clearly and politely
explaining in full detail, helping him/her to learn. But if even that
goes into deaf ears, I will reply directly to the offender asking him
to read the mailing list guidelines and follow them. This should
definitely reduce the volume of reminders from my side, which I admit
has been huge in the recent past.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

This is already done and going on quiet well, we can also insist in 
welcome email.

This is not about the priority inbox, rather than people who committed 
the mistakes knows the error, tagging can help know the people who is 
not in the discussion.

The CentOS installer has options to use the two disks as part of
software RAID1.  A couple of trial installs should give you a pretty
good idea of what is involved.

how do you interpret this as trolling and extraneous to the topic? And
how is it inflammatory stuff? Plain fact: RMS is campaigning to keep
people off gmail. Another fact: we are discussing the defects of gmail
as far as mailing lists are concerned. Third fact: a bit of humour
always helps keep the discussion going.

Hi,
I had ubuntu 10.10,windows7,xp in my system. Due to some problem
reinstalled windows7, then i tried using live cd to recover ubuntu but
failed and it lead to damage of all loaders(when i boot system blank
screen only came). Then due to some urgent need of system, installed
ubuntu10.04 & now got grub loader with all os list.

Now what i need is a grub loader which enable me to get ubuntu
10.10,win7,xp. Now grub loader from ubuntu10.04 is used to boot my
system,how to make grub from 10.10 work?

        Does that mean you are able to boot into all installed
operating systems or do you mean that you just got a list of OSes, but
you are not able to boot into any of them ?

      Did you install 10.04 on a separate partition or did you over
write 10.10 ? May be a little more detail on what is the current
status of your 10.04 GRUB will help. Thanks

Hi,

I've done a bit of dev work in data processing, web apps and integration.

Work dealt mostly writing in different languages and learning protocols and
breaking things to integrate. I'm fairly knowledgeable in Linux systems.

Have been offered a SysAdmin trainee offer.

Any migration pointers?

Please follow the mailing list guidelines. There are 2 things wrong
with your mail.
a, When you're being sarcastic, do indicate that it is sarcasm with
html style tags or json like tags or even array braces. like <sarcasm>
blah blah blah </sarcasm>
b, When you quote from an external source, please specify that you're
quoting from an external source. The same rules apply. <quote> blah
blah blah </quote>.
c. I also need to check with list admins whether you can take quotes
from 1984 or not. Orwell's books are patented and we don't like
patents.

dear list admins, can we ban this person from our community before he
makes further incites or write a sooper-dooper script with our
favorite sooper-dooper language to filter such mails from reaching our
inboxes at all.
I think I'm Mr. P among Mr. P, Q and R. But its just peer pressure.
And it will not end.

This is good.    Above experience would help in your transition.

> Have been offered a SysAdmin trainee offer.

IMO, Developers tend to have a silo PoV v/s Sys/Net Admins need to
have a "wide angle" (almost 360 degree) view and good trouble shooting
skills.  Your users will report a symptom and you need to figure out
(very quickly) where in the Network/Host stack the problem could be.
Find a good mentor and don't let go of him/her.

know what the right hand is doing, an extra hand is hired to somehow
make all the separate pieces of junk work together as a bigger piece of

You can use mdadm .

After that you will need to install grub on the second disk and test
it by pulling out the the first disk.

10.10 & 10.04 in separate partition.

current grub is loaded from 10.04 partition(which i have installed at
last). I need to make grub from 10.10 to be used on booting. I dont
need 10.04,just to get rid of boot problem installed that in a
separate partition.

I think you can simply install grub2 to partition that contains 10.10 and
delete the 10.04 partition. Ensure you use the 10.04/10.10 iso/cd to install
grub2 or any version that ships grub2 and not grub legacy. Instructions to
reinstall grub2 can be found here -> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2.
Hope this helps!

how to install grub?

when using the following command
sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdX (used correct drive name)
i got error that "warn: Attempting to install GRUB to a partition
instead of the MBR.  This is a BAD idea..
/usr/sbin/grub-setup: warn: Embedding is not possible.  GRUB can only
be installed in this setup by using blocklists.  However, blocklists
are UNRELIABLE and their use is discouraged..
/usr/sbin/grub-setup: error: if you really want blocklists, use --force."

I used --force then message came as "Installation complete,No error
reported". But grub from 10.10 is not loaded.

Now just tell me a method to reinstall grub from 10.10, I can enter
into 10.10 os.

Are you giving /dev/sdX as something like /dev/sda which will
represent the whole hard disk and hence will install grub in the MBR
or something like /dev/sda1 which means the grub will be installed to
the partition specified. The former will make sure that grub is loaded
when you boot. For the latter to work, you must chainload the grub
installed to the partition from the one installed to MBR.

Rephrase: What is JBOSS?
JBOSS is one of the many implementations of a Java Application Server.
The Java Application Server is a "Open Standard" and there are many
implementations to the same. JBOSS, Glass Fish, TomCat, etc.. are a
few open source implementations, while WebSphere and WebLogic are
examples of a closed source implementation. If you know one, you
automatically know about 80% - 90% of the others.

> 1) Just wanna know if its worth doing the certification as of now. (I

Do you want to be a JBOSS administrator or do you want to be a JBOSS developer?
If you are a Developer, you need SCJP, SCWCD and SCBCD.
Either way, a certification without actual hands on, is worthless.
Having been in many interview panel my self, its very easy to
differentiate a person with a certificate created out of the "dumps"
and actually knowing nothing.

> 2) Which or who are the organizations and for what 'jboss' is used.
See my first answer. It doesn't matter if JBOSS is used or not. Your
expertise can be used in any organization where a Java Application
server is used.

> 3) How will the opportunities be once i have done the cert.
See my answer to 1.

We must schedule a later date as fedora releases only by 24 May.

Both Fedora and Ubuntu releases its Gnome3 version , so with my view
the appearance of both is merely the same.
Also regarding the features , it is more or less same other than packages.
Since Ubuntu stopped shipping free CD.
So this version of Ubuntu can determine the original users , rather
than people looking for Free CD.

      How to reduce the volume for system sounds like the default play of a

Tried reducing the sound level with the slider in system--> prefences-->
sound but on doing it that way the sound level for the music players like
RhythmBox and movieplayer goes down ! So is there a way to reduce the System
sounds alone ?

Yes i meant certification, sorry for not being specific on that.
I mentioned that because later someone should not ask me why i wanted to 
do the certification if at all its not worth it

Message-ID: <BANLkTinO3QJJJaYmmEdR2CRw5O7=c37omw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

              I would like to know if there is any recommended way of
handling PERM FAIL and TEMP FAIL returned by DKIM verification
failures. Also, if the PERM FAIL is due to unverifiable signature, can
we assume that the mail originated from a spammer ? Because, any
legitimate mailer that has DKIM configured in the DNS would have a
valid/verifiable DKIM signature. Given that the signature is not
verifiable(Let's say it has fields missing), is my assumption(that the
mail originated from a spammer) correct ? Thanks
