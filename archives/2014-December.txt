Hi kavin,

self learning is good option..

But if you need more knowledge on linux administration . you can prefer
redhat linux courses to study basic and later you can work any linux
distros with that concepts you learned ... i learned it and working in
debian... so this would be fine option...

Hi
Why don't you try to implement Computer Vision using opencv. Moreover lot
of research going on in this field already. If your are good in programming
and have knowledge of DSP/ Image processing then it will be added advantage.
Don't worry about which department it falls.

Irony is that, saying this from a gmail address. Firstly it's the US
private corporations like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Yahoo, Microsoft (this
isn't accident that American corporates have penetrated world-wide: Modern
Imperialism) are collecting data / metadata which is used by US Government
& when the government understood the benefits they are reaping out of mass
surveillance they encourages the activity by sanctioning projects and
funding for Private corporates.

Government controls the people (that's not democracy) and Corporates reaps
profits. The state of people in this picture?
I cannot and will not trust a government or political party backed by
Corporates.

We can stop the mass surveillance. Mass Surveillance is possible because of
two reasons.

   1. Plain data without Encryption. We should start to encrypt everything
   or atleast as far as possible (
   https://www.encrypteverything.ca/index.php?title=Main_Page) (
   https://ssd.eff.org/)
   2. Centralized Architecture: Corporations and governments are collecting
   large amounts of data because the centralized architecture allows to do so.
   We should evolve into De-centralized, community driven architecture much
   like Torrents and even something like Magnetic links. There is a discussion
   here, (
   http://discuss.fsftn.org/t/is-internets-centralized-architecture-a-problem/133).
   Also do take a look at this interesting conversation
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i85fX9-sKYo


The book "When Google met Wikileaks" unmasks the true nature of Corporates
like Google. When we speak about corporates, it is wholly the Executive
persons (Venture Capitalists, CEO, Chairman, etc.,) of that corporation
responsible for all of its activities since they are those who are enjoying
the profits. Audio book is available here for free
http://wikileaks.org/Transcript-Meeting-Assange-Schmidt

Also this talk on Tor provides a very good insight and counter-arguments
for those who claim anonymity is bad

Been away from the list for a while.

FWIW, command dirname will return the directory portion of a full

Message-ID: <CAJ=JFUn3Uz685BxKQU-JN6PH_75Y86DQ7O2CmO2oCsCJuYiKRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All..,

          I am having the network model as

                        Modem                                      N/w
Switch
    ISDN (Airtel) ----------->  Server(Centos) [Squid] ----------------->
Client Machines.

 Now I will plan to set the same host name(localdev.com) to all my windows
client machines.

 So I put an entry in windows "/etc/hosts" file as "192.168.2.42
localdev.com",but this setup is working fine in without squid proxy(direct
connection).

 While I am connecting through proxy.it doesn't work any more.,I changed
the settings in Server hostfile ("/etc/hosts").,that is working for single
machine.,but my requirement is to make the entire working environment (all
machines) with same hostname.

      What should be the changes I should made to make this as
successful..,please suggest me if you have any ideas..,


   "Thanks in Advance"

Message-ID: <CACqv84h6y4mEjUSw-RL927AaeG1yhv1nw17-D8qMABep9YyB_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Team,

Can some one help me on how to take a server inventory (list of running and
non-running) instance from AWS console.

Are there any tools available which can tell me the running and non-running
instance in an account (including all the regions)?

There is a CLI tool (ec2ds),but we have almost 30 accounts and each account
have more than 35 instance/region,taking a manual inventory will take at
least a week,which I don't want to do.

Please suggest.

Regards,

Message-ID: <CAND27953XZKzu2w=nz7sYXGP7E0RrEFZaEs71w8fHm_w4Amh1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Chennai is becoming the hub of events.

There are many tech communities, meetup groups, social friends group etc
conducting regular events.

Check the Event calendar of Chennai
https://chennaieventscalendar.wordpress.com/calendar/

All the weekends are filled with events.

Once meetup.com became free, there are groups started for most of the
software in the industry.

But, many groups cannot make the events as they could not find the venue.

Option A:
=======

Thinking a Hacker Space kind of venue, where any user group can conduct
their events.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace

The following are the ideas :

1. A small home in a accessible venue in chennai
2. Any user group can conduct the events for free


How to generate money?

1. Donations should be collected to give the rent
2. Startups/Individuals can be use this venue as co-working space in the
week days for a very lower cost
3. or one or two persons can stay there to share the major part of the
rent/expenses.
4. Paid workshops can be conducted with cheaper cost.



Option B :
=======

There may be some startups/organizations who may be willing to give free
space conducting events.

We can collect their details and share in a public site.
Any community that wants a venue can contact them and use the space.


Please share your inputs on this.

Great idea - one of the biggest challenges for anyone stepping out into 
the business world is dealing with your overheads.

Having the benefit of a cheap / low commitment work space might be of 
great benefit to start ups / people with ideas.

Hacker spaces elsewhere tend to be quite connected with the DIY 
electronics / make space - so I hope you would consider that
too?

I would be happy to contribute something.

Hi Gnana desigan,

It can be a place inside inside or nearby chennai. You can suggest a 
good place where you feel that our community will have a good time. I 
suggest we can go to Mahabalipuram. Kindly give your suggestions and 
your inputs regarding place, time and arrangements for tour.

Update:
After a quite long time, after detailed search (using google) and thinking,
finally I found out how to crack it by myself!!

The file is in binary format, coded as 32 bit float, with Little endian.
Data is represented by 4 bytes.

Thank you all

Subject: [Ilugc] Mysql SSL segmentation fault
Message-ID: <CAFHFDA=O34Ooc+TWBZtXgxYX9jgL6NisF8aeXrwxwLK3EEmPWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Has any one had success with configuring these from stalk.

Mysqld server which supports SSL on a Redhat box (Santiago) and then have
mysql client from a debian (Wheezy) connect in over SSL without any problem
?

When I tried doing it I ended up with Segmentation fault on my debian
machine.  However when I used another Redhat box(Santiago) for mysql client
I was successful in establishing the connection over SSL.  Could someone in
the group pour their SME opinion on this issue ?

I was under the impression that it was rolled only into their commercial
version.
