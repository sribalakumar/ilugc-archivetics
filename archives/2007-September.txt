Your collegue must've known your account's password (unless of
course, you had configured for password-less authentication which I
doubt was the case).

Look into the log files /var/log/secure (and /var/log/messages or
/var/log/debug if needed) for entries like the one below:

Aug 31 20:36:14 sphynx sshd[7026]: Accepted password for root from 
192.168.2.2 port 47811 ssh2

This should give you enough information about connections from remote
hosts and authorization information while using SSH protocol (scp
included).

Cheers!

I am planning to convert a Intel Core 2 Duo machine into a fileserver
using linux. The memory present in the machine is 1 GB. The hard disk
capacity is 160 GB. This machine was previously used as a desktop.
Will this config be suitable for a fileserver or do you need a full
blown server for builing a file serverWill this

This is exactly the issue. the complete translation is not done. The
original mail says the following :
"Next year's first Ubuntu Release is code named Hardy Heron", whereas
your translation is half baked and you can clearly see a
"Communication gap" :-)

I still dont understand why Mr. ShriRamadoss who I guess has a pretty
decent English knowledge cannot translate the same. Anyway, this will
be my last post in this topic, and Kenneth thanks for the translation.

Long live Tamil.

you can use a 486 with a 20 mb harddisk as a file server - all  
depends on what files you want to serve and to how many people and  
how fast.

To setup a fileserver, all you need is an excellent network through-put
and equally fast hard-disk. Its better to have some form of data
redundancy (RAID) and/or backup in place (depending on the criticality
of data being stored/served). The CPU speed shouldn't matter much.

happy to see thamizh words getting translated.. and a debate happens on its
correct  meaning..  just as it happens when we do the other way around..

thanks.. that should be our vision.  good applications developed in tamil
and people in UK and US translate it to English.. ;-)

???????  ????????  ???? ???????! ??????   ????? ????? ??????  ?????

It will be basically autocad files and other files. It will be serving
around 50 computers and at the maximum there maybe 20 computers
accessing the files at the same time.

software without restrictions :-)

yes.. ???  was one recommended by a renowned thamizh scholar ????.??

???  is a thamizh  word which co-incidentally sounds similar too "free"...
but among the other thamizh foss users ??????? was/ is familiar..

some feel ?????????? finds its root from sanskrit.  though there isn't an
issue in using it..  since its tamizised way back.. other possible options
are ?????? (the state of being liberated from any bindings) .. as we had
mukt.in in hyderabad.. & ??????? for which the meaning is obvious..

"????????" when split becomes "?????" (self) +  "????????" (magic),
which is _not_ the actually meaning of our freedom struggle. It was
fought with blood, lives, passion, and love for this country.

Many authors/media still misuse the word today. It is actually "?????????".

===== English =====

Hi,

NRCFOSS conducted a two-day GNU/Linux workshop at St.Joseph College of
Engineering, Chennai on August 30-31, 2007.

About thirty MCA students participated in it. Sanjeev, Vikram, Amachu
were the speakers in the workshop. Sessions were held with Debian
GNU/Linux. Students were quite enthusiastic about the workshop. The
arrangements in the college were made by Rajesh Khanna.

We would like to have more speakers come forward and do more workshops
like these for us.

Ponnusamy

there is no real difference between a server and desktop - just the  
components will be different. For a server you would not need X for  
example. And if you are accessing with doze boxen you would need samba.

as far as server is concerned - debian etch is the automatic choice -  
or, if you like to do things with a gui, Mandriva spring 2007

Hi Mahalingam,
 Can you be more specific ? Are you looking for help to install Perl GD 
Module ?  If so you can use the
CPAN shell.

$perl -MCPAN -e shell 

The above command will get you to cpan shell, then you can install Perl 
GD module,  you need to know the
exact name of the module,  you can find that by search www.cpan.org.
Good luck.

+1 to that. Also, to find otu which packages a CD contains, get the
.jigdo file for that CD or DVD. It is actually a gzipped list of debs
in that CD. You can get the jigdo files here:

http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/4.0_r1/i386/jigdo-cd/

This is *bad* idea.  Use ssh instead.  It is a good practice to disable 
allow root acces over the network.  You can always "su -" once your 
logged in as a regular user.  For Windows, you can use PuTTy or WinSCP 
to access your Linux box.

Hi,

Unless you know what you're doing, avoid using the telnet protocol
in the first case. The reason its not available by default is
because its insecure. Try and use SSH instead.

If you still *insist* on using telnet, edit the file /etc/securetty and
uncomment the lines having pts/0 through pts/9

In any case, you can login as a normal user and do a 'su -' to switch to
root user (in case you didn't know that).

Nice translation. We can use this one if we have a Tamil version of this
Ubuntu release. Otherwise we can always leave it as Hardy heron.

no charge - mail nrcfoss@au-kbc.in with your contact details and they  
will send it. (Your tax rupee at work). btw, please avoid bottom

Message-ID: <be4915c60709020043r423e967bsbfe4d6101d6b82c6@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all ILUGC members,

       We, Computer Society of MIT, are planning to celebrate SFD with
the following events.

1. Multiplayer Games running on GNU/Linux
2. Video presentations on FOSS
3. Lectures

We have also planned to have Computer Society's inauguration function
at 9:00 AM.

Unlike Carte Blanche, we would like to have more fun related events
than technical demos in this year's SFD so as to give anyone who
attends that day a feel for FOSS and its abilities.

We would like to have any suggestions from ilugc on this regard about
games to be included, videos and lectures and also on how the events
could be marketed so as to reach all students.

General suggestions on whether any event could be added or on how they
could be conducted, are most welcome.

In addition, we would also like to have volunteers form ILUGC who are
interested in giving lectures that day.

I personally invite all LUG members to be a part of the celebration at MIT.

Message-ID: <be4915c60709020059q3c16c31bo9b2e85487cd747b8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello experts,

         As part of FOSS activities and to help others with providing
distros, we, Team Computer Society, at MIT have started collecting
distro images on a USB harddisk so that whenever required they could
be burned on to CDs or DVDs. So far we have Debian Etch, Fedora 7,
Fedora 6 and Slackware.

Could you please suggest on which distros to be added to the
collection.. Based on their specific characteristic.. like debian is
good for servers, mandriva is nice with its gui or ubuntu is good for
beginners so that when someone requests a distro stating their exact
requirement it would be easy for us to provide them with what they
want..

Thanks in Advance,
Sivabalan,

There can still be technical demos. What matters is how you 'present' it:

Suggestion 1: Please read:
https://lists.tce.edu/pipermail/glugot/2007-August/001215.html

Suggestion 2: You can also try the concept of "musical chairs".
Instead of students explaining demos to the visitors, give the
visitors a 5-minute chance to sit before the computer in each stall
and let them try the demo. Keep some kinda buzzer so you can boot them
off the chair, else, everyone will not want to leave the 'gaming'
stall :)

Most lectures/BOFs are discussions. Moreover, this is already done in
user-group meetings. So, how different would your event be? Hands-on
experience to FOSS is what we would like the visitors to have, so they
can try it on their own. But, it is hard to get hands-on BOFs in India
because:

1. Not everyone has a laptop, and it is also quite hard to setup as
many computers as possible for the visitors to try them.

2. When you have a 'moving population' of visitors, it is hard to keep
them seated for a session.

3. Different people have different interests, so it is not good to
keep them locked down with fixed, timed lectures/sessions. Worst part
is that these sessions are held in parallel, and it is quite difficult
to pick your sessions.

All conferences/unconferences just copy each other and replicate the
same. But, if you want to showcase your uniqueness, you need to be
different every time you conduct an event, unless it is in a different
venue _and_ a new target audience.

Regarding monthly/weekly user group meetings, some of the
talks/discussions must be changed to hackfests. I understand that not
all have laptops. But, some make-shift trolleys need to be made at
these venues to easily transport users' computers.

Regards,

SK

Message-ID: <69621d830709021540h58851d1l3237992e42252c9a@mail.gmail.com>

I tried to setup PHP5 in my Debian box. But, what i become to know that, i
failed to do so.
The problem is: when i tries to open my "first.php" by double clicking, it
doesn't open in Epiphany or Firefox; rather it opens with editor by showing
the source code.

The steps which i followed at the time of setup of PHP5.

1. apt-get install php5
2. apache2 was installed before [ apache2 is running/ok ]
3  i followed the link:
http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_debian_etch_p6
4. I put my "first.php" in /var/www

And then... i tried to open my "first.php" with epiphany. But nothing
happens....

Waiting for your reply.

1. As Kumar replied, you need libapache2-mod-php5
2. Open your browser and try "http://localhost/first.php"

Suggestion: Instead of putting things into /var/www and trying it out,
use a VirtualHost to some location in your /home dir so you can just
work from there without worrying much about permissions or moving the
files to /var/www every time (and su'ing to do the same).

platforms. It is not necessary. I use only puTTY or WinSCP in Windows. Once
again i say thanks for ur replies.

Double clicking? Where exactly did you double click? That would
explain why it didn't work.

How did you try opening it with Epiphany? As a local file or  using a
http:// address?
Open http://localhost/first.php as mentioned by somebody else.

Sorry, if I misunderstood :)

Hello everyone,
i installed apache2, perl5.8.8 and i tried to install mod_perl2 . when  i
ran the  make test command, the  test report some error messages, i cant
interperate it. please do help me, let me wanna know where am i going wrong

}';

[warning] result:
[  error] You are running the test suite under user 'root'.
Apache cannot spawn child processes as 'root', therefore
we attempt to run the test suite with user 'nobody' (99:99).
The problem is that the path (including all parent directories):
  /root/mod_perl- 2.0.3/t
must be 'rwx' by user 'nobody', so Apache can read and write under that
path.

There are several ways to resolve this issue. One is to move and
rebuild the distribution to '/tmp/' and repeat the 'make test'
phase. The other is not to run 'make test' as root (i.e. building
under your /home/user directory).

You can test whether some directory is suitable for 'make test' under
'root', by running a simple test. For example to test a directory
'/root/mod_perl-2.0.3/t', run:

  % "/usr/bin/perl" -Mlib=/root/mod_perl-2.0.3/Apache-Test/lib
-MApache::TestRun -e 'eval { Apache::TestRun::run_root_fs_test(99, 99,
q[/root/mod_perl-2.0.3/t]) }';

Only if the test prints 'OK', the directory is suitable to be used for
testing.



Running the test suite is important to make sure that the module that
you are about to install works on your system. If you choose not to
run the test suite and you have a problem using this module, make sure
to return and run this test suite before reporting any problems to the
developers of this module.

Skip the test suite? [No]

You need process accounting for this. 'acct' is a gnu process
accounting system.
On debian the package details of acct is

Description: The GNU Accounting utilities for process and login
accounting
 The GNU Accounting utilities `ac', `accton', `last', `lastcomm', and
 `sa' add login and process accounting support to Debian GNU/Linux.
 "Login accounting" provides summaries of system resource usage based
 on connect time, and "process accounting" provides summaries based
on
 the commands executed on the system. The 'last' command is provided
by
 the Debian sysvinit package and not included here.

I am sure every other distro should have it

The above paragraph clearly explains the issue. You are trying
to do a 'make test' within a directory where the user 'nobody'
has no write permissions.

 From within your build directory, temporarily try the following command:
  chown -R nobody:nobody .

Then do a 'make test'

Check if this solves the issue.

Cheers!

Generally i don't recommend using telnet. Try using putty, it is free
and secure as you can use ssh using it.

Secondly it is even better not to enable root login via telnet. If you
still need to do it, edit the following

/etc/pam.d/remote (Red hat/Fedora/Centos systems. Not sure on Debian
alternatives.)

there will be a line that looks like this,

auth required pam_securetty.so

comment it & then try logging in as root.

I don't know how many people on this list agree with me, but i prefer
FreeBSD as file server. It is rock solid. 

Ubuntu is designed more to me a user friendly system, i did prefer to
use a server based system like Fedora(min install) or centos. You can go
for minimum installation & then install the file server packages
required for you. 

Fedora DVD was on LFY a month or two back...should be easy to lay hands
on.. might save you on the transport too.. ;)

I agree. NFS on Linux sucks big time. This is one area where you
should not listen to the fan boys. It's your data after all. Explore
alternatives like FreeBSD, OpenSolaris etc. At my place of work we
have recently wasted an enormous amount of time wrestling with NFS on
Linux.

But, IMO too cutting edge for some people.
A good distro to attract new users and show case
cutting edge softwares. But, it scares of some since
it's gentoo based.
Besides PC Linux OS and Linux Mint are good
distros to hand over to those who have limited
bandwidth and want decent amount of bundled
apps.
And having apt-on-cd around for ubuntu
repositories will be a good idea.

This is being used heavily in certain production environments also! (Even
though it is still in beta). Excellent support is available in the form of
mailing list. Be a member of this mailing list, you will know about this
good product.

Thank you very much for your valuable suggestions.. SK..

What my idea was that after the lectures.. there could be a quiz or
two.. based on the lectures and videos..

I would like to have more info or links regarding the videos please..

Any other change in plan of events is also welcome..

Thanks,

This article is a small story about the importance of getting source
code for the software we buy/ask people to create, from the software

Hi All,

I recently installed the deb lenny/sid. The total booting process
(console mode) takes nearly 1min. My PC is AMD XP 2000+ with 256MB.
All unwanted  services are stopped and kernel modules are
blacklisted.

Here is my bootchart: http://www.freeshell.in/~bharathi/bootchart.png

In the same machine, FC3 takes ~25s to give the prompt. Any tips to
reduce the boot time?

Bye :)

Great News! Hats off to all who worked hard for this.

"The five-month ballot process ended on 2 September and was open to
the IEC and ISO national member bodies from 104 countries, including
41 that are participating members of the joint ISO/IEC technical
committee, JTC 1, Information technology.

Approval requires at least 2/3 (i.e. 66.66 %) of the votes cast by
national bodies participating in ISO/IEC JTC 1 to be positive; and no
more than 1/4 (i.e. 25 %) of the total number of national body votes
cast negative. Neither of these criteria were achieved, with 53 % of
votes cast by national bodies participating in ISO/IEC JTC 1 being
positive and 26 % of national votes cast being negative."

Thanks ,it now works after trying for a week.
Now I can upgrade Sarge which I had in one partition
only to access BSNL portal through Opera 8.52 which
was the last Opera to masquerade as IE.

Message-ID: <46DE4E3E.5010301@gmail.com>

Hi all,

A lot of FOSS projects had made their proposals for participating in
Project Day at foss.in 2007 and the results are out for the selected
projects. This time, Debian-In and Ubuntu-In are joining hands for a
combined Debian/Ubuntu Project Day :)

The Project Day need to be and we plan it to be for aspiring
contributors to the projects, i.e. it should be aimed as a starting
point for users to get motivated to start contributing to their
favorite project, contribution not just as in code but in every way
possible.

- From Ubuntu-In side, we are planning to  get Jono Bacon and Daniel
Holbach to speak on this occassion. We have got a positive response
from Ubuntu/Canonical about helping us in making Debian/Ubuntu Project
Day a grand success.

We also welcome ideas for the Project Day from the community, so as to
make this endeavor really useful and achieve the aim of getting more
(few more rather) to contribute.

[foss.in] FOSS.IN/2007 Project Days sessions To: "FOSS.IN"
<foss-in@yahoogroups.com>
All: Here are the selected Project Days sessions, in alphabetical order:

* Debian/Ubuntu
* Fedora
* Gnome
* IndLinux
* KDE
* Mozilla
* OpenOffice.org
* OpenSolaris

These eight Project Days sessions will be part of the CfP that will be
published next week, and people will be able to submit talk proposals
for each of them (and the Main conference, of course). Congrats to the
eight projects, and my sympathies as well - having been selected, you
now carry the burden of ensuring that you produce many Indian
contributors. That means that your sessions have to be structured in
such a way that it is easy for people to get in at the ground floor
and the take the elevator up :)

That completes phase 1 of the process - next is the Call for
Participation, that will go out next week, after Team FOSS.IN meets
this Sunday. Cheerio! Atul

Not many services are running. You can turn off Network manager. other
than that, may be you can try recompiling the kernel. it roughly takes
3/4 of the boot time....

I would be quite interesting in seeing how you worked out that a typical linux 
machine takes 3/4th of its bootup time loading the kernel.

LJ Tech Tip on Taking Screenshots:

The method I prefer for creating screenshots under Linux is a little
more direct. Just install the Imagemagick program - under (k)Ubuntu
just do this:

  sudo apt-get install imagemagick

Then open a terminal and type:

   sleep 3 ; import screenshot.jpg

or for the .png fans:
  
   sleep 3 ; import screenshot.png

Adjust the timing for your particular needs then when the mouse turns
into a cross left-click and hold until the area is selected. Once you
release the mouse the screenshot is taken. If you want to look at the
shot quickly from the command line, simply do this:

display screenshot.png

HTH :)

it is a security feature inbuilt in browsers. you cant access the
addressbar. if you dont want to expose your url then use frames. but even
then people can find it out if they have to. if you want one more level of
abstraction, then create inline frames dynamically.

Then, what you'll need is the ability to setup URL rewriting
feature on your web server. Apache webserver comes with
mod_rewrite module to do this.

The official guide to mod_rewrite module can be found
at the following link:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/misc/rewriteguide.html

Also, search on google for keywords "Apache mod_rewrite
tutorial" and you'll come across a lot of websites that
teach you how to do it.

If you are good in JavaScript, DOM and AJAX, you can create
a new HTTP request using JavaScript on your webpage to a
different URL, fetch the web page, parse it and display on the
web browser.

Microsoft's Internet Explorer has the innerHTML method in
JavaScript that makes it easier, though its not DOM standard
and unlikely to work properly on other web browsers.

On the server-side, if you are using PHP, you can fetch a
different web-page by its URL using the 'file' or
'file_get_contents' function and print it.

Of course, the above technique are considered insecure
and makes your site look suspicious/non-trustworthy and
is best avoided unless you know what you're doing!

I have removed the confusion about payment and corrected few errors.

I would humbly request you to spare a few hours to go thro' the slides

Please note that this seminar is by no means an introductory one...

Looking forward to meeting you all.

Hi,

While it's always been easy getting the whole Debian repository on
DVD, nobody seems to be selling Ubuntu's.

I'm in Chennai. What's the easiest way to get everything (all four
components) on DVD?

I think he is talking about Ububtu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu and Edubuntu. For

Yes. we have decided to distribute CDs to all those who demand one from us.
we have already informed many people that Linux OS CDs will be available
with us on that day. we expect around 350 students to participate in SFD `07
celebrations. so it would be great if u could provide us ubuntu 7.04 (feisty
fawn) CDs.

Under windoze, what is the setup between the PC and the modem/router?  
Is it in bridge mode?  Is the PC connected to the modem/router using 
USB or Ethernet cable?

You need to provide such info so that we can understand your setup.

I think the OP is well aware of FOSS.in, but he clearly mentions
_Chennai_.

Message-ID: <20070906141030.GA9437@mrna.tn.nic.in>


Hi all,
I would like to know if i can implement directory restricted access using sudo ? 
something like a chrooted environment ? 

I have a group "dbusers" with following config 
%dbusers ALL= /bin/cp, /bin/mv, /etc/software
I presume that the users with group set to "dbusers" would not be able to traverse into other locations  and use those commands with which there are restricted.
But in contrast a the users of group "dbusers" are able to copy and move files in other locations say for example, /var (Which is what is not the purpose).

Is there a way to restrict further using sudo ? 

regards,
KM

 Why not do it in January 2008. We do not have nay FOSS conference
anywhere in India in January. As you want it to be an All India level
conference, why not have it when there is no other conference is
happening. It will also help you guys build an identity of the
conference.

Very good idea to spread the spirit of FOSS. Considering the Linux OS CDs
try to get as much distro's as you can for the event as " iso image " , so
that you could give the participants the distro that they need at the venue
itself.

I have few suggestions. 

1. Test it under different browsers. It should render
the same across all different browsers. (Test it on IE
as well!)

2. The menu on the top has a mouse-hover effect of
highlighting the menu and underlining it as well.
Highlighting the menu would be enough (no need to
underline it)

3. Looks like you have used tables for your layout. I
would recommend changing that to layouts using CSS.
There are loads of information on the web for creating
layouts with CSS. 

4. I may be asking for too much, but you could
consider a "Web 2.0" look too ;)

you are using tables for layout - that is a big no no. Also too many  
things flashing around which gives me a headache.

My initial thoughts ;-)

For me (from a personal view) to attend this conference in Chennai,

-- what is / shall be unique about it when compared to foss.in and
freed.in ; this has to be well thought / brainstormed and defined

-- timing of the conference; please bear in mind that conference
attendes would be looking at events outside the conference / workshop
as well; so, the timing of the event should be in-sync with that of
the Chennai weather so as to avoid the "Chennai HOT Summer" (no
negatives meant here, though I live in Bangalore now, 30 years of my
life has been spent in MADRAS, and I take pride in saying so)

1. Check under the Login tab, there is a small link for index.php. Why
is it hanging out there ?

2. -Tables +CSS

3. Don't have things flashing/moving/rapidly changing around in you
website, it distracts, sore for the eyes and drives people away.

Most of the conferences happen in non-Chennai locations and whenever I
used to be there I don't see many for TN (i.e. our LUG). Also, many
people might be ready to attend a local conference because the
expenses of attending one are less comparatively.

We have a comparatively bigger FOSS community  but not many of them
are exposed/acquainted with the rest of India. Think a Conference in
Chennai might make this possible, making us to interact with the rest
of the community in India. Plus we don't have much international FOSS
icons turning up at Chennai, other than occasional RMS visits ;)

At last, why shouldn't we have a conference at Chennai, why should we
be left behind ?

in that case, how do we support?

also we should take foss.in to other major cities to create awareness rather
than creating another conference.

We should create awarness of FOSS. It is can be foss.in or any other
conference. Multiple events by differnt organisations are welcome, as
emphais can be different. 

In my opinion we should target common people who use computer in the
Chennai conference. More specifically, education and small
business/traders/assemblers.

Grrr... Why am i being quoted for something which I haven't said. Some
issues with the quoting on the side of the poster ?

So as to reply, why should we move foss.in at all ? Why shouldn't we
have foss.chennai 2008 (lot of things in 2007 and less time, lets plan
it for 2008) ?

every place is different. Chennai lug is different from Delhi LUG or  
bangalore lug. So a conference in Chennai will be different. How  
different? We can find out only when conducting one.

as mentioned in my original post, we need to have the conference in  
2007. We have two months to do this without clashing with freedel or  
foss.in.

No, on Windows XP Pro, SP 2.

The sound comes while the page loads (alphabets are pronounced), but 
after that, hovering over the alphabets doesn't play any sound.

Error console says:

Error: thissound.Play is not a function
Source File: http://arichuvadi.nrcfosshelpline.in/web/ordered_alph/1/VO/
Line: 17

and Firefox crashed again... :(

Is this anything to do with having huge fonts, gradient backgrounds and

Message-ID: <69621d830709070118w26c28b6ag564b0dbd674f0ef4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I got a Acer Aspire 5600 some days ago. Vista Unlimited is pre-installed
there. Though, this laptop is going to another person, so i cannot remove
Vista right now. But, i want to check that laptop with Ubuntu. And when i
went for this, i failed to use internet. Though, each and every ip, gateway
and dns are ok. Moreover, when i put the line internet cable into  my
desktop, again the internet is ok.

How can i use internet with live cd there in that laptop.

Waiting for your reply.

Best,
Zico

I don't get it. It's just a web page with some javascript thrown in to 
play some audio files. Why should it be so dependent on the underlying OS??

Tried the link from Ubuntu 7.04 using Firefox 2.0.0.6. Firefox didn't crash
but no sound was played.

Definitely works better with Linux... ;)

lets give more weight to "what's gonna happen in conference?"
then we can come up with date. because content matters.

conference usually has the following
1. sessions
2. hands on demo
3. contests
4....

what do we do for the content? what the ultimate goal for the conference?
lets not say "creating awareness of FOSS". that is the ultimate goal we need
to reach. how do we achieve that goal by conducting this conference?

my suggestions
1. invite government of tamil nadu for the conference to let them know more
about FOSS influence in it
2. invite various schools and colleges to participate in it and get
benefited
3. distribute as much as FOSS packed cd-roms/dvd to the general public.
4. entry fee should not be there :-)
5. call major FOSS contributor across tamil nadu and india to speak about
their projects.

If you do a conference do it either just before or just after another one,
so that the non local (north india, or from abroad) speakers and attendees
for that event can just do the trips back to back. Much easier for them that
way.

Maybe the ilugc volunteers who helped elcot turn their desktops from
windoze to linux can give a presentation about their experience and
how was the response.

This is a good idea. The distro which is the most user-friendly should
be chosen for this so that end-users do not get scared.

This can be decided when the final budget is worked out.

You just described what happens at just about every foss conference .. but you can have far more focused conferences than that, you know, instead of wasting your time doing all that you described.

Let us do a short, focused one or two day event on something that Madras is well known for.  If you organize "yet another" FOSS conference of the sort you have gone and described, with everything from kernel hacking competitions to booths selling RHEL, nobody in particular will want to come to it, as you are going to be competing with a bunch of other, established FOSS conferences.  

What I said applies for sponsorship as well - the Indian branches of several FOSS companies have a limited budget, and a lot of it will be committed to other conferences / will have to be gained by you in competition with those other conferences.

You don?t need to measure the success of a conference by the crowd of people coming to it, the number of vendors putting up booths at the conference etc.  Some serious work can be done at such events.

Given the number of people fanatic about i18n and typing random list emails in tamil, you might want to do one focused on i18n (and invite people like CDAC, the Hyderabad Central University etc who are also doing i18n work), or given the work that ELCOT is doing in deploying FOSS in governments, and NRC-FOSS is doing in deploying FOSS in colleges, you could do some focused on that.

Yes, lets not waste one another conference on what all other
conference is doing. We have to do something which others' don't so
the community gains something by attending it. As SRS says, if we can
bring out something concrete out of this, it will be a success. As we
already have a huge students population under our hat, we have to
utilize them to get something done. May be an app, may be an
improvement/bug fix, may be a documentation, anything but something
which is what *normal* *other* conferences fail to do.

Can we have the theme/objective of the conference as spreading awareness
about FOSS development model and bring in more students/developers to work
on Open Source projects?

Can invite speakers from various open source projects, companies to talk
about the open source culture. The target can be

Engineering Students doing Computer Science
Software professionals working in multinationals
Start-ups doing overseas projects.

I think this is uber cool. "FOSS conference on Localisation". Most
conferences end up speaking on Linux kernel, server admin and stuff
but very little focus on localisation and knowledge management. Why
not have a conference focussed on Localisation and tools available. It
need not be restricted to Tamil but we could invite people from
various states various languages. Will be fun!! Several sessions and
"localisation hack sessions" can be conducted. A huge to do list can
be covered. I am personally game for such a one. Nice idea srs!!!!

Dream On!! A FOSS conference for Localisation.......

Reggies.

Beg to disagree. If I am not wrong, you are trying to validate a
currency and you have got an European client. In most parts of Europe,
DOT and COMMA are interchangeably used. Therefore, 1,000.00 is same as
1.000,00. My Visa entry had an entry with 35,00 meaning 35 Euros.

With this background, the RegEx ^[0-9.,]*(\,)[0-9]{2} will also
validate ",,...28.12" which is incorrect.

The following RegEx which I flicked out of Google searching for
"Regular Expression Currency Validation" and modifying it a little
gives me the following.

   ((\d{1,3}(\,\d{3})*(\.\d{2})?)|(\d{1,3}(\.\d{3})*(\,\d{2})?))

A couple of  problems though.  Just that it forces you to use the
thousand separator. It will not work for the Indian Number system
(comma after ten thousand).

HTH,

+1 on Firefox 2.0.0.6/Kubuntu FF. Plugin missing for .ogg files

On Konq, the sound was erratic. Doesn't always play. Sometimes, the
response is very late.

Message-ID: <be4915c60709071031o560ea8e8oabed7b2b152c1a47@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all ILUG-C members..
     The following topics have been decided upon for delivering talks
at Software Freedom Day at MIT on September 15th..

1. FOSS Philosophy

2. Why use FOSS in Education ?

3. FOSS activities in and around Chennai and Tamil Nadu

4. How one can contribute to FOSS ?

The audience that day would be mostly comprised of first timers and
beginners at Linux or any FOSS.. hence the choice of above topics...

I would like to invite all volunteers from our ILUG-C who would like
to give speeches on the
given topics... and also on any other topic on FOSS that they think
would be attractive for newbies..

Additionally hands on demos of FOSS games are also planned.

The talks would be in the afternoon session, Sep 15th, Saturday.

PS: thanks to Amachu for suggestions on topic selection.

Regards,
Sivabalan T,
General Secretary,
Computer Society of MIT.

+1. When you're starting off, it is better not to try to do everything. 
Though i8ln is not one of my interest areas, I would say it is a very 
interesting area to do a conference in. Since there are so many people 
motivated enough to do something about it, it's relatively easier to do.

I also agree with srs about holding a conference close to foss.in or 
other major conferences - for example, GNUnify happens about 2 weeks 
prior to LinuxAsia, so people normally check out the former, and proceed 
to the latter from there. The focus happens to be sufficiently different 
to be of interest to the same people. Just my 2 paise.

Message-ID: <446cb7260709071727u5185fd86v56262739d3ad4c9c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Is any one of our group aware of disaster recovery over SAN , my knowledge
in this issue is very minimal and i would appreciate any help(
Documentation, links to websites etc. )

I have already searched the web and the inital results from google  are not
really satisfactory.

I think perhaps this is not so pertaining to the mailing list but since we
will be using RHEL or Cent OS for the hosts, the idea is  that   any one
aware of DR and remote replications with this back ground might  be able to
help me .

Thank you for reading

Regards
Raj

The usual, remote / offsite backup data centers with databases, software
versions etc hot synced / replicated from production, backup and retrieval
procedures ..

Talk to your SAN vendor - either Netapp or EMC. They will probably sell you
a very complete, and very expensive solution for this.

Good DR doesn't come cheap.  And really doesn't have much to do with the OS
you run on your server .. would work on the same lines if you were using
windows server 2003.

A brief overview of the FOSS Tools used in research activities in the
fields of Bio Medical, Physics, Chemistry and the likes. Whats lacking
and what can be improved! whats there already in the repositiories.
How to start contributing etc. for eg Ubuntu has these list of science
packages neatly categorised. There is also a good amount of toDo stuff
that we (as part of the MOTU Science team of Ubuntu) keep adding on
this page.

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Teams/Science (The tiber server is down
and hence to know the package differences between ubuntu and debian
you can use this alternate link
http://laserjock.us/ubuntu/versions.html)

People in this domain who have already used some of the packages could
give demos. Some packages can be found here.
http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/science/ (Note: These are packages
that will go in gutsy, the next release of Ubuntu)

You can also mail up the "FOSS IN Science" mailing list  for more
tips. They seem to be doing a pretty decent job too.

Reggies.

Ubuntu seems to be the runaway winner .. 375 votes for it.  In contrast,
Fedora got just one vote, Redhat got 17, and all  the others (SuSE etc)

Not too many ideology fans I see .. just 13 votes for " Anyone that refuses

Why not save yourself so much work and find some yum
repository for beryl?
Or maybe there's one for compiz-fusion.
This might help for the white screen problem

hi,

after many years I tried out Koffice again - it rocks. It does odf.  
And you can finish writing an article in kword before openoffice even

Subject: [Ilugc] separating nation and language..
Message-ID: <200709081754.52179.shriramadhas@gmail.com>

this is something that has been haunting for a while..

few preliminary questions,

1) debian installer for debian & debian installer for ubuntu. how different 
are they?

now initially in the GUI installer that we use to install ubuntu once the live 
cd gets booted, the first choice is the language of installation and its 
clear. 

2) then comes the keyboard layout, where while most of kutti, tiny languages 
of world has seperate representation, major indian languages and their 
keyboard layout are messed up under "India". here non-nationalistic 
linguistic representation is needed.. need feedback here.. 

3) am using kde & it states clearly,

Unfortunately, if in a country, different users use different settings 
depending of the language, this cannot be correctly reflected in KDE. 

&

The directories in kdebase/l10n are for countries, not for languages, so the 
codes have a different meaning (even if for example the French language and 
the country France share a same code: fr). 

again in kde-settings, keyboard layout, India comes and languages are messed 
up in it. 

Now how abt suggestions to have linguistic needs seperated from national 
needs.

nation need not be messed up with language and can be confined to represent 
time zone.

language can be sepearted out independently.

I think this is enough of a faq that googling beryl white screen gives you a
ton of results

ATI drivers, bugs that may need you to use an older version of xserver-xgl,

I run both Windows XP and Fedora 7.

But somehow Pidgin(GAIM) doesnot work for yahoo,gtalk, or IRC
both in windows xp and fedora.

For gtalk i get
Connection Error

Write Error

For Yahoo it only shows "connecting..." but never connects.

for IRC, it shows nothing. and doesnt connect.

Howcome if yahoo messenger and gtalk client are working
then these services are not working through piding ?

Please be a little more verbose about your network environment. Are
you behind a HTTP proxy? Do you configure a HTTP proxy in your web
browser to access the internet?

If that is the case, then Yahoo Messenger support may not work (known
bug in Pidgin). But Google Talk support works if you use the Jabber
server as talk.google.com and port 443. Enable "Force Old SSL" as
well.

HTH.

many foreigners are under the impression that Indians speak a  
language called Indian - this includes the Ubuntu devels. I see in  
Mandriva and OSX, that under India, we get various languages - Hindi,  
Tamil etc and various keyboard layouts - Devanagiri, tamil etc. This  
is one reason why I stopped using Ubuntu - if they cant respect my  
country, why should I respect them? I have raised this question with  
the local Ubuntu fanbois, but they blame Xorg for this mess. Mandriva  
uses Xorg also, but they have taken the trouble to find out what  
language is spoken in India - and so has OSX, and quite possibly  
Redhat, Suse and others.

Dear Amit,
            In BITS Pilani we have a similar problem. The way we connect to
gtalk/yahoo from Linux/OS X via our proxy is by connecting to the actual ip
address of talk.google.com (obtained via nslookup) (same thing for yahoo),
and port 443 (secure http) and forcing Old SSL. You can also try the same.

Note: use ping talkx.l.google.com to get the ip address

similar impression was also expressed when i once asked why tamil 99 layout 
should go with scim and not made in the default keyboard settings itself.. 
just as tamil unicode etc., xkb doesn't support was the reply...

you have my heartfelt sympathies - if there is anything I can do to  
relieve your pain, do not hesitate to ask. btw, I just opened a OOo  
file in kword, edited it and saved it in OOo format - but the other  
guy couldnt open it in his OOo. I'll send it in odt and see if it works.

Hi,

Live CDs have a filesystem image they loop mount and boot. Jigdo is 
useful when you have individual packages right on the CD. It works only 
on the package level. So you cant't have jigdo image for Debian Live. 
You download it completely or create it from an installed Debian system. 
The packages for creating the CD should be in Ubuntu development 
repositories . You can try and build the CD from Ubuntu.

Regards,
Senthil

i tried a while back with ubuntu feisty, the graphical installer asks for
language first (thamizh chosen) and then two more steps ahead, it asks for
keyboard layout and i chose Tamil Unicode, where we have India on LHS, and
all available indian language layouts on the RHS.

From the live CD itself, System --> Preferences -->  Keyboard  takes to
Keyboard preferences. In  the Layout Tab it is possible to Add Tamil
Unicode.

So it is there.. Tamizh Unicode Layout, Tamizh (Remington?), TAB & TSCII are
available.

Need to check with Kubuntu Live. Now what is difficulty in adding Tamizh99
here ? and this brings the need for scim as far as phoenetic & tamizh99
layout. else the effort put in Scim is saved a lot. a lotttttt...

Hi Karthik.
   
  Your trick worked for GTalk. But I am unable to cofigure yahoo and IRC.
   
  can you tell me what exactly to ping for yahoo and IRC. i use irc.freenode.net
   
  Also there is no "Server/Port" in yahoo. There is one under Yahoo Japan, am i supposed to use that. And there is no "Force OLD SSL".
   
  I am behind a college firewall. The administrators use Cyberoam to restrict internet access.

If Tamizh Unicode Keyboard is familiar, then the Ubuntu/ Kubuntu Live

After installing Ubuntu, the keyboard layout was found to be
available, and one need to enable it specifically to activate.

Long ago I had written a program called killmyself.c that I have
attached here.

It is not great code but gets the job done.

If you want to generate a signal use kill(2).

Best,
Girish

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <sys/time.h>

extern char *__progname;

/* This program self destructs after a specified time */
int main(int argc, char **argv) {

	int ret;
	long minutes;
	struct timeval t, t2;
	pid_t child;
	if (argc < 3) {
		printf("Usage: %s <minutes> <mplayer arguments> \n",
				__progname);
		exit(128);
		/* NOT REACHED */
	}


	if ( (child =  fork()) != 0) {
		/* I am the parent process */
		minutes = strtol(argv[1], NULL, 10);
		sleep(60 * minutes);


		/* I am done! */
		kill(child, SIGINT);
		exit(0);

	} else {
		/* I am the child */
		execv("/usr/local/bin/mplayer", argv + 1);
				
		exit(0);
	}

I thoroughly enjoyed the two days and I should certainly thank ilugc for
inspiring me to come up with something like this.

It was a great learning experience for me interacting with brilliant
minds and getting to know several hackers and like minded people.

Overall the event was a great success as Mahadevan took excellent care
of food and other logistics. Food was much better than the seminar. :)

Bharathi ably supported with announcements, an intro to lug and various
other logistics.

I had the intention of involving the audience as much as possible and
this I believe made a big difference to the whole show.

Monologues and a rigid structure in such talks as originally conceived
by me do not actually reach the audience and might even cut the wrong
way with some people.

By involving the audience we make it a collaborative effort and this
makes people open up further to what you are saying.

I fervently wish more hackers come forward and share their knowledge. It
was great fun. :)

regards,
Girish

Have you tried RTF?  Sick standard as standards go but reasonably portable

Dear Amit,
             See we are using Pidgin only for Gtalk here. For yahoo,
there is another way to connect. Yahoo has an old version of their
messenger available for red hat 9, and that is what we use. You can try
downloading the same rpm. (If on a debian system, use alien to install)
That works great via the proxy. For irc, I use online CGI proxies :)

Karthik

Try this at the shell prompt (or add these lines into a
wrapper shell script):
    ./binaryfilename &
    PID=$!
    sleep 10 && kill $PID && echo "Killed process $PID"

For example say you need to kill a process after waiting for ten secs or
so... you can try pushing it into back ground something like this..

./binaryfile &
pid=$!
sleep 10
kill -9 $pid

Friends.

This Saturday and Sunday, Girish gave a wonderful seminar on Networking
Concepts. He covered very vast concepts and Topics.

The IIT ICSR hall is so capable of handling more people. We expected about
200 people. But first 87 and second day about 30.

He talked about tcp/ip, various protocols, crypto,email, spam etc.

Honestly saying, I can not understand them fully.
I simply watching what is going there.

Some students were so brilliant to follow him and ask doubts.

Mahadevan took care of Food, tea and snacks.
Barathi tooks care of whole thing.

Koushick and Noorul helped a lot.
But, we missed noorul today.

I dont know how others got the knowledge.
I got only less things.
I have to increase my level.

Girish. You did a wonderful thing man.
Two full days. Full talking.
Take care on your health man.

People gave a plenty of feedbacks.
I hope girish learned a lot from this presentation.

A lot of wishes for Girish.

Keep Going.

Here are some snaps.

I have no idea why there was such a low turnout for day II.

But the people who came were really keen on learning crypto. Perhaps the
first day scared them off with too much information overload...

There were very few students. Most people came with several years of
real industry experience. There were some professional trainers and real
hackers who asked and answered questions.

Yes, I am really indebted to everyone for making it such a smooth and grand
affair. 

I hope the participation levels increase in future.

This was the first time for us. Bharathi and I both got plenty of
experience and feedback. 

I invite more hackers to conduct events like this. Bharathi can help you
organize fun events like this.

We can even invite people from other places.

It is not necessary to learn everything; just whatever interests you
and what is relevant to you.

I covered what I knew based on my experience. We all have our interests and priorities.

Overall it was a great learning experience for everyone. Somehow God helped me bring
my one year old dream to fruition. And for the first attempt, this was
more than enough for me.

This would not have been possible but for the sweat and blood put in my
the whole team including but definitely not limited to

a) Prof. Ashok Jhunjhunwala
b) Bharathi
c) Chandrashekar Babu
d) Denny White
e) Koushik Narayanan
f) Mahadevan
g) Noorul Islam
h) Shrinivasan
i) Thanigai 
j) Venky Nakhate 

and many many others...

Kindly pardon my omissions.

warm regards,
Girish

Dear All

The seminar was very good. It gave me the understanding of things actually work , tho its something all internet users at all levels use all the time. Although I missed a few sessions, overall the main benefit for me was I now have an approach on how to learn more; before these concepts were only  haze in the background. 

And very practically, i won't use ssh clients to blindly connect to other servers [means will not trust the remote connection :) ]

BTW the second day head count was 52 not 30. 

I do not consider the head count very important; Girish sould count more on what went into the available heads :)

A very good week end .

Thanks to Girish.

Please do mail me Dr.Jhun's mail id , we are all indebted to him for enabling this seminar.

This Saturday and Sunday, Girish gave a wonderful seminar on Networking
Concepts. He covered very vast concepts and Topics.

The IIT ICSR hall is so capable of handling more people. We expected about
200 people. But first 87 and second day about 30.

He talked about tcp/ip, various protocols, crypto,email, spam etc.

Honestly saying, I can not understand them fully.
I simply watching what is going there.

Some students were so brilliant to follow him and ask doubts.

Mahadevan took care of Food, tea and snacks.
Barathi tooks care of whole thing.

Koushick and Noorul helped a lot.
But, we missed noorul today.

I dont know how others got the knowledge.
I got only less things.
I have to increase my level.

Girish. You did a wonderful thing man.
Two full days. Full talking.
Take care on your health man.

People gave a plenty of feedbacks.
I hope girish learned a lot from this presentation.

A lot of wishes for Girish.

Keep Going.

OK. Then web based IRC clients are one option,
but they're really bad when it comes to usability
IMO. Frequent disconnections and no auto

+1 to that. A better way would be to use a Jabber client, like Gajim,
and use an IRC transport to get onto IRC. Google to find out more, or
ask here and I'll help.

In any case, here's how we use Gajim to connect to Yahoo:

Message-ID: <289b5e200709100406u27f5d8ebj787c26afca431729@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have installed Ubuntu 7.04 in a system dual booting with Windows XP. While
browsing Yahoo mail page with Firefox 2.0.0.6, double clicking the mails
listed in the  inbox displays only header information and not the body of
the mails. And also I am not able to compose and send any mails.

At home I am having Mandriva 2005. In that the same version of Firefox is
working fine with yahoo mail. In either case I have not chosen yahoo beta.

I have googled a bit and did not find any solution.  Hope someone in ilugc
would have find a solution for this problem. Hope to hear from them.

Thanks

1. Does yahoo mail work in another browser (say konqueror, or IE on XP?)
2. Does your work access go through a firewall that does content inspection?
3. Does your firefox at work have adblock type plugins installed on it?
4. Do you have firefox setup to accept all cookies that yahoo mail sends?

I find that doing a Select all highlights the hidden text and the mail 
can be read. It is probably due to some extension which fiddles with the 
page's DOM.

Friends.

We are in a need of web based Document Management System.

please suggest one.

OWL is nice, but too clunky, too many options for a normal user.
We tested it.
The users click every button and often get various results.

We need a neat and nice DMS.
Any suggestions/

Thanks.

Hi,

You can try the following snippet:

  ( ./binaryfilename ; echo "Process completed" ) &
  PID=$!
  sleep 10 && kill $PID && echo "Killed process $PID"

Note the ( ) in the first line. This invokes your program within
a sub-shell and runs the same in the background, after which
the 'echo "Process complete"' statement gets to run.

However, I'd recommend a && pipeline instead of ; command
separator on the first line, i.e., if your program follows the
standard UNIX convention of 'return 0' on success.

Cheers!

That is even simpler... :)

./yourcmd

[ $? -eq 0 ] && echo success

the other syntax is useful if you want to kill a process if it is taking
too long.

Sometime alsa is muted. try increasing the volume and try to see if it
works... this is one of the common problem.

Surpising, Windows bundles Wordpad with every OS (not
sure of Vista) which can open RTF files.

Disable all extensions and restart firefox.  See how that helps.

Or start firefox in "safe mode"  - without extensions etc. Try that way.

So can word, so can several other word processors across various platforms.
RTF is an old standard, and a reasonably simple one to implement.

Buy a thinkpad R series.  Though - if you know someone in the states (or
even Singapore / Thailand / Malaysia) you might find a better model for that
rate than you would in India .. horrible tax / duty structure here.  

You can import one laptop duty free and so - for a comparable rate, you
could fly to Singapore or Bangkok on a low cost carrier like Tiger Airways,
Nok Air, Air India Express etc, land there early in the morning, buy your
laptop there (and roam around the city for a while), then come back home on
the night flight.

Would the cost of traveling to and fro along with
purchase of his laptop come within 50 K?

If you wait for late Oct / early Nov, Tiger Airways (www.tigerairways.com)
is selling tickets for $45 to $50 one way (that is < 2k one way) -
especially if you book your tickets now.  I guess Air India Express will
bring their fares down as well, when Tiger Airways starts operating flights
from Madras and Kochi to Singapore.

Taxes are fixed by the government and will remain approximately the same for
any airline - around Rs.6000.  Anyway that should bring your fare down to
around 10K or so round trip instead of 14k.

Thinkpad R and T series are less than 2500 sing dollars, for basic models.
Including tax that'd come to around 2600 sing dollars, and you can get a VAT
refund so about $25 or so of that comes right back to you.  Hmm.. 2600 sing
dollars is Rs.69K but thinkpads are worth the money, for sure. 

Note: Lenovo (which bought the Thinkpad line from IBM) has their own line of
notebooks, for rather cheaper -
http://www-07.ibm.com/lenovoinfo/sg/catalogue/?re=home_A_sg shows Lenovo
laptops starting at SG$1600 + tax, and SG$ 1600 is approximately 42K rupees)

kpresenter creates frames for each slide which doesn't exactly fit in
OOo. I had a tough time when I created the slides with kpresenter and
tried to present it with impress (I had to redo the presentation to
make it look somewhat OK).

One good thing with koffice is its ability to import PDF files, I have
not seen that capability in any other word processors. Sadly it
doesn't export to PDF (in my earlier case I could have done a pdf
presentation, if only it had supported it).

KDE printing allows you to set PDF as a virtual printer and makes this 
rather redundant to support in individual applications. For others, you 
can always install and use cups-pdf.

Openoffice exports to pdf just fine. Or you can set "pdf" as a virtual printer, as Rahul pointed out.

I think buying a thinkpad in either place ..more or less costs you the same.

Most R series are priced at around 2500+ SGD(with tax). Considering the
travel charges it'll turnout to be 75K+ INR.(65K INR +10K INR(to and fro)).
For the same price you can get a R series thinkpad in India.(almost same
configuration)

For Eg,
1) R61 89422A costs SGD 2478(with tax). . http://www.lenovo.com/sg/en/
2) R61 9458A17 costs INR 63,190(without tax)  http://www.lenovo.com/in/en/

Both have kind of same configuration.

IMO, Getting a thinkpad in US would be the best option.(Like if you know
someone
who could offer to carry a laptop for you when they come to india). It costs
around 30-35%
cheaper than India/SG and only in the US you can order a personally
customized laptop
suiting your needs.

If you know a IBM/Lenovo employee and if he is willing to get a laptop for
you, you get another
10% discount(not sure if this applicable in India...).

Let us hope lenovo offers things like personal cutomizations of
configurations, linux loaded laptops
etc.... in the near future for countries like India also.

Harish.

I tend to favour Dell as it is completely customisable. You can order an 
well stacked up Inspiron under 50K. Same weight as TP R series. Runs 
Ubuntu well. Dell is widescreen. Do not know if < 50K TPs have wide 
screen. Did not a while ago.

Lenovo might do that as well. At least, their blogs do

The OP can make a note of it and may be wait for few

Sure do - as long as the laptop includes IWS (International Warranty
Support).

There's a query page on lenovo.com you can access to find which countries
offer support for your model of laptop (enter the first 4 digits of your
laptop's model number - for example my X60s is an 1705CTO, so I would enter
1705).

Warning - not all laptop models (like, some of the brand new T or X 61
series) may have support in India till some months after their release.
That was the reason why I bought an X60s instead of an X61s in July, on a
trip to DC [had a friend buy it and keep it for me ..].

I have used the Indian helpdesk once in a while - and they do provide
support, but if it is anything complex you just might want a second opinion
from the Lenovo 1-800 number which is staffed by techs in Atlanta.  They
tend to be a lot more experienced at fixing stuff over the phone than the
Lenovo India techs (working out of Bangalore) are, in my limited experience.


I have had to call two or three times after a buggy release of thinkpad's
power manager started popping up bogus "battery errors" on my laptop - found
the ATL staff far more clueful than BLR, plus ATL is available 24x7, and
1800 numbers are free to call using skype.  

I guess after this experience I now know just why so many US types are
moaning about poor customer support when outsourced to India .. because it
IS poor, beyond a certain basic level of support / answering FAQ type
questions.  This is speaking as someone who has run customer support and
antispam support desks for the last 10 years now .. mostly in India, for
foreign customers.

With that one copy and paste don't work, you can only copy images. But
OOo PDF is excellent in that it has support for internal links ... and
you could copy texts from it.

The issue was my presentation didn't look the same in OOo. Making a
PDF from OOo doesn't help in this case, as I could have used it
directly if it was looking same (the core issue is the difference in
approach to ODP by OOo and Koffice). If Kpresenter had a PDF export I
could preserve the look and and feel.

Once you are using the print option you are locked to koffice (same
with OOo but it is much more popular)

Hi,

Amit Dey wrote:

Irrespective of Linux distributions that you work with,
I would recommend the following command-line tools
instead of graphical download managers:

 - GNU WGet
   http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/

 - cURL
   http://curl.haxx.se/

 - LFTP
   http://lftp.yar.ru/

 - NcFTP
   http://www.ncftp.com/ncftp/

These tools are proven to be stable and give you
more control (you can run them in background without
the need of GUI). You can configure your web browser
to invoke the above downloaders within an xterm or
better yet, within a GNU Screen session.

These tools are most likely to be included with major
Linux distributions to work almost out-of-the-box.
I haven't checked on FC 7 yet - but I guess it should
be bundled with it.

I've tried many graphical download managers/plugins
for web browsers and have found them to be at large,
un-reliable/buggy and they fail to give me enough
control.

Cheers!

Depends on your need. If you download small files too often and you
have unlimited bandwidth, then KGet/D4X is very good.

But if you are constrained by the timings given by BSNL (for lesser
beings like me), I prefer two CRON Jobs (1 to start, 2 to kill) and
WGET, when it comes to downloading HUGE files over night over a few
days.

If you have a good Internet connection, then you could use 'yum'
to download and install the packages along with their dependencies.

Download MPlayer from http://rpm.livna.org/ repositories. Infact,
you can download and install the "Fedora Core 7 repository RPM"
from their site, and use 'yum install mplayer' and you should be
ready to go.

I'd prefer downloading mplayer source tarball from one of the
mirrors listed at http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html
and build it. Its easily and works without much of a hassle.

For a good audio player with a GUI - download, build and install
audacious from this site:

   http://audacious-media-player.org/

You can also try 'yum install audacious' after adding the
rpm.livna.org to your yum repositories - if you dont want to
build from source on your own.

Cheers!

Dinamalar front page and their Latest News page are now in unicode. So if
you have any unicode font you should be able to read them. Kubuntu perhaps
has TSCuParanar and few other unicode fonts.

Dear Amit,
            In case you don't have good continuous net access, you can
compile mplayer off source. The source is pretty much complete in itself and
hence is very easy to compile.

1. Download the .tar.bz2 file from www.mplayerhq.hu
2. Untar it using tar -xjvf <filename>
3. cd Mplayer1.0-rc1
4. ./configure --enable-gui
5. make && make install (make install to be done as root)

For GUI, you need to download Mplayer skins and put them into the skins
directory in the .Mplayer folder in your home directory. For running command
line version, open a terminal, cd to the directory which contains the media,
and simply type mplayer <filename> , to start playing it. Other way is to
right click on a file in nautilus, say open with and type mplayer.

Karthik Ramgopal

mplayer rocks as a media player.

I can never praise it enough. You can do highly sophisticated stuff like
controlling with FIFO, LIRC remote, take screenshots every few frames
and so on. You can have transparent menus and what not.

It has got an extremely feature rich audio and video filter subsystem.
It also supports several audio and video output drivers.

$ mplayer -vo help

$ mplayer -ao help

$ mplayer -af help

$ mplayer -vf help

I admit it can take a little while to get comfortable with all its
options but its man page is really comprehensive.

By the way it can also play analog and digital television in addition to
all sorts of audio and video files. :)

Streaming, DVD, VCD... you know what I mean.

It is real dynamite packed in a neat command line.

Enjoy!

Girish

First thing you have to do is identify the chipset. 

It is based on Philips SAA7130/4 chipset?

Or bt878/bt848?

Is it supported under linux?

Read the Documentation directory under linux kernel source.

Look for tvtime or xawtv (not recommended). 

Also there are plenty of tuner and card options you may have to give
even after the driver recognizes the chip.

Best of luck!

ASCII text files I can understand, there's a difference in LF / CRLF use
that makes linux and ms-dos (well, windows) text files a bit incompatible.
That's why you have dos2unix / unix2dos and options in vim to save files as
dos or unix text.

I don't see how or why someone can't open an rtf file in windows. I've
created / edited rtf files in openoffice on linux, and then successfully
opened them using wordpad (aka "write")  and Word 2007 on XP.

You can install a tool called 'checkinstall' for this
purpose. Download and install the checkinstall
package from the following URL:
 
    http://www.asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/

Once installed, you can build the source by issuing
the following sequence of commands:
    ./configure
    make
    checkinstall
Note the 'checkinstall' command instead of 'make install'.

This command does a 'make install' on its own and also
updates your RPM package database with the files being
copied onto your system directories, with a newly
generated package name corresponding to the sources.

At a later point of time, when you wish to uninstall
the built-from-source package, just run the
'rpm -e packagename' command as usual.

This tool should work on most Linux distributions
based on RPM, DEB or TGZ package management.

Cheers!

Wordpress is a blog
Mediawiki is a wiki
Drupal is a CMS, as are Joomla, PHPNuke etc.

Drupal is a light-weight CMS when compared to Joomla. If
you are going to create a portal that is simple or a website
focussed more on content, articles, news, blogs, community
and so on... then Drupal should be the right pick.

For rapidly setting up large-scale e-commerce centric portals,
Joomla stands out. It offers way too many features out-of-the-box
targeting e-commerce centric requirements.

Wordpress and the likes are merely blog-hosting suite. Whatever you
pick, think of how you'd want to live with them in the long run.
Migrating from one suite to another (Drupal to Joomla or vice versa,
for instance) can be an arduous affair in my experience, once your
website has grown large enough.

What makes you think drupal is a cms suitable for simple portal or a
website ? Drupal websites have survived slashdot effect without any
hassle whereas most of the CMS have failed.

 E-commerce engine is a plugin for jhoomla and jhoomla is not
e-commerce centric solution. For e-commerce centric requirements have
a look at zen-cart which has a light weight cms built in. Zen cart
website http://www.zen-cart.com/ is an example of what zencart can do
(it uses no cms and whole website is built on zen cart engine).

You need to a make deinstall or make uninstall depending upon the 
Makefile.  Doing a make clean results in deleting the output of the 
build process in the source directory only.

You can use http://kde-redhat.sourceforge.net/. It should be available

We can add colors to warning and error using color-gcc, an add on to gcc.
Its available in Debian you can apt-install it, no idea about other distros.

I emphasized simplicity as in "light-weight", which of course
was one of the reasons that drupal should've survived the slashdot
effect. There was clearly a mention in my earlier post about
using drupal for content-intensive websites - its designed well
for such a purpose.

If your requirement of a website is based on simple layout and
targeted mainly for hosting articles, news and other such contents,
or focussed towards community oriented websites, drupal fits easier
to such requirements.

If you are going to deal with heavy customization and/or completely
non-conventional website layout/design - its not going to be easy
on drupal (unless you are an expert on PHP and internals of drupal).

I did mention about 'Joomla' (not 'jhoomla') if I was correct.

Let me rephrase it this way - Joomla *is* designed to be more
easier to rapidly integrate and deploy corporate sites, community
portals, and *also* e-commerce portals with minimal development
effort.

Most e-commerce portals simply wont do with merely a shopping
cart, which is just the technology aspect. There are other things
that demand higher priority when it comes to deploying e-commerce
portals. Some of which I can immediately think of are as below:
   - Customizability and ease of integration
   - Support for non-conventional layouts/web design
   - Fastest learning curve and developer resource availability
   - Effort involved in integration of site design/layout
   - Effort involved in deployment and maintenance
   - Proven stability and scalability (which is debatable)
   - Availability of easy integration plugins like Product Catalogue,
     Affiliate Marketing extensions, choice of payment processing
     engines, highly customizable virtual shopping mart extensions,
     auction modules, EDI extensions, forms and reviews modules,
     customer interactivity plugins and lots more.

Most of these features are available as plugins/extensions that can
be easily integrated into Joomla - which is why I mentioned Joomla
to be a good choice for 'e-commerce centric' websites/portals. As
such, I did *not* mention that Joomla itself as an e-commerce centric
solution.

Of course, you can deploy Joomla on a personal website for merely
hosting a blog, or deploy Zencart to host a large-scale e-commerce
portal - its just a matter of how much of time/resource you are willing
to waste.


Cheers!

Hi Mr.SRS

I tried all your above suggestions. Still I am not able to read yahoo mails
using firefox.

I also installed Epiphany browser in Ubuntu 7.04 and tried yahoo mail page.
It too behave in the same way not displaying body of the mails.

I wonder why the same firefox 2.0.0.6 is working fine in Mandriva 2005 and
not in Ubuntu 7.04 and Windows xp. Any more clues or suggestions?

 Says who ? When did you last tried to create a skin for drupal.
Drupal is the easiest to use  cms when it comes to creating heavy
customization and non-conventinal website layout/design. You need to
know little bit of php and i think thats much better than using some
custom scripting language. Secondly, most of the customization
requuire trivial usage of php.
 With drupal 6 you can have css only themes, now beat this.

 Quoting you from original message "For rapidly setting up large-scale
e-commerce centric portals, Joomla stands out"

 First of all the original poster did not mention that he needs an
e-commerce site, secondly you project Jhoomla to be used for e-cmmerce
site. Now what am I supposed to infer from these two statements.

Hello all,
     I just installed Apache2.2 in my Debian box and it is working
fine. I would like to have tips on how to solve the following
purpose..

My friend is connected to the net through a bsnl modem in doze(i dont
think doze matters)
I have my Apache running on my computer which is connected (via PPPoE)
behind a Airtel Modem.

What could I do to enable my friend to see my page running on my web server..?

I am glad to furnish any further details..

Thank you,

on windoze

I am not sure of this but you can run a wide array of software under the
Cygwin environment in Windows.

I have tried running Windowmaker and it runs quite well.

You could run screen savers under them. But I am not sure if this is
what you want...

if it is PPPoE, you can check what ip your webserver is running on by  
using ifconfig, and your friend can access your page on that ip -  
this will change everytime you reconnect to the internet.

192.168.1.33.. and also my system is in lan with the router having
private ip 192.168.1.1 (the gateway) and only its external ip changes
every time..

1. Install a dynamic DNS client like ezclient/ddclient on the web server 
and register a host in the free dynamic DNS service e.g DynDNS. Setup 
the client to update the DNS server every 5 minutes. Do not make it 
smaller as you might end up getting blacklisted for excessive traffic.
2. On the router, set up port forwarding on port 80 to 192.168.1.33.

Once this is done, your webserver can be accessed by the registered host 
name.

Well, its clearly to do with your perspective. From my point of view
and experience with training newbie web developers, I've always found
Joomla to fair better in terms of ease-of-use and understandability
by many who were new to concepts of PHP.

Again, I dont claim drupal is difficult... its purely a matter of
perspective. Your opinion is clearly different than mine - which
is perfectly okay - Drupal is good, and Joomla is good.

Let the OP explore, try his options and choose what's better for
him than freezing on a solution purely based on my opinion or yours :-)

Cheers!

        Umm. If you have the key, what is there to recover? Are you
 saying that you have forgotten the pass-phrase? If so, again, unless
 you can hack gnupg, there is no known way to recover it.

        Well. Brute-force is about the only way. Your brute-force search
 can be made smarter if you remember some fragment of your password, but
 if not, then it's going to take a long time.

        Of course, this would work for you, in case someone else got
 hold of your secret keyring, nad wanted to pretend to eb you.

well,

gpg --gen-key 

helped me to generate a key with, name, email-id, comment & pass phrase.. 
exported it to .bashrc of home directory.. encrypted a sample document sent, 
received a reply.. decrepted.. & read that too..

added it to kmail etc.,

here are the details,

<amachu.techie@gmail.com>

all that i did was in a pc which is no more... lost them..

now am in another PC, will i be able to get back it or regenerate it.. if 
having private key can do it, how about to achieve it?

to be used in my kmail now? the same key... 

am i missing something fundamentally on gpg? or making some silly question?

        If you no longer have the PC, and the hard drive that contained
 the private key, it is gone.

        Umm, no. If you could, so can a cracker -- I mean, where would
 the information about the large number that was your private key come
 from? 

> if having private key can do it, how about to achieve it?

        Well, even if you had your private key file, you would still
 need to have the pass phrase.  If you do not have your private key,
 there is no way to get it back.

> to be used in my kmail now? the same key...

        If you can some how get back your key out of thin air, why would
 I not be able to do the same?

> am i missing something fundamentally on gpg? or making some silly
> question?  please explain..

        Well, yes. I suggest you go back and read the manual to be found
 on the gnupg site.  The whole point of public key encryption is that
 there is no way to get the private key given the public key (and vice
 versa, of course).

        If the file either of these were stored in is gone, you have
 effectively lost the key. For ever and ever more.  If you had printed
 out your revocation certificate, now is the time to revoke your old
 key.

As a practical user, the answer would be a no. If this were possible,
we'd have hundreds of PGP/GPG users floating around with similar keys! :-)

I agreed i lost it and drowned it not going to come back :-(

Now in general,

Is there a way to get it, if one had the private key ? 

how to? 

am asking this just out of curiosity, so that i can backup my existing one in 
a proper way.. so that it's not gonna get lost due to some formatting etc., i 
can recover it later...

say i have my private key now.. or the probability is 2^{-64}

Any backup that is not lost due to formatting would mean that it would NOT
be stored physically on your drive. This would mean storing it in some
encrypted form on a public server. But, this is EXACTLY what we want to
avoid. Every system connected to a network is insecure inherently.
Furthermore, if the encyption was done by the server itself, the server
admin has some power over your private key. If it was done by you, you would
have to remember the password / decryption scheme. Where would you store
that?

What you can do, is maintain the private key on an external hard disk, which
you dont format very often.  Or go the old age way, of writing it down, and
keeping it in a place secure enough. :). (But most ppl, will disagree with
this writing down business. Leaves too much trail, and there is every chance
of noting down an error.)

--
Pranesh

P.S. - That is the whole point of the private key - it is unbreakable (by
brute force) in real world time. (And there is no way you are going to
remember some digits of that 1024 long string).  Security is the prime
issue.

        Is there a way to generate the private key if you had the
 private key? Is that what you are asking? I guess, you us cp.

        Id that is not what you are asking, what is "it" ?

        If you have your private key, you have your private key. What
 exactly would you be trying to get back?

        Err, no. If he has his private key, getting back his private key
 has a probability of 1, no?

	This is the case when he does not have the private key.  But he
 is posing the question that he has somehow retrieved the private key.
 In which case, he has the private key, and there is nothing the get
 back any more.

        I don't think we have a clear picture of what his real problem
 is.  Perhaps we need to shift this discussion into Tamil, and have some
 one translate?

No, I meant when he _didn't_ have the key and had to generate it
afresh.

Dear Friends ,

Please go through this  link http://www.thelinuxvault.net/wiki/Main_Page

This is a very good attempt at having  all the various Distros supported
under a single site.

 I do know of the earlier Linux documentation attempts TLDP etc. but this is
the first distro specific documentation.

One of the  weak points of India  is its numbers, Of late   India is
changing that in to its strength and here we can make  a strong contribution
and perhaps that might even  make the masses of this country adopt Linux.
More numbers mean more users -- who can contribute with documentation. we
need not move mountains, one sand grain at a time by our huge numbers
automatically move/make mountains.

Imagine a site  where you can simply download all the steps that a  Newbie
can just go, browse  copy - paste all the commands ,code, macros, whatever,
you need to  improve your productivity.

All of us  use different Distros, are in love with specific Distros,
Perhaps we already have our own favorite links for the documentation of
various tasks that we need to do, perhaps we have our own scripts, which can
be shared, perhaps our own shortcuts of various things to be done in various
desktops or window managers.  This is a good place to pool all these things
.

I can here skeptics  saying that it might make the would be user a parasite
and might not be a good move but remember   more market share implies more
bargaining power with hard ware vendors.

I do not know the mail id for the nrc foss  if some one can forward this to
their mail id it would be great.

if any body is interested  please do let me know  we can do this as a group.

Regards
Raj

Done this one too..

But now when i use the url of the registered host in my browser.. it
shows me my router settings page..

I had added port 80 in the NAT -- Virtual Servers page in my Airtel router.

Where am i going wrong..

Let me get this straight --- you have forwarded the port 80 in your router
and are trying to access the webserver with the public ip address of the
router like say  --- 20.13.14.250 ( assume that this is your router's
publlic ip address)

Then are you accessing it with  http://20.13.14.250:80 in your browser???

if that is the case then yes you will only see the web page of your router.

why -- your router has an embedded web server  which already is using the
port 80 for  its web page  or the so called GUI .

if this is your problem then  simply forward port 8080 for the
corrresponding private ip of your webserver and then try accesing the server
from a host out side your network using --  http://20.13.14.250:80 make sure
that the default fire wall in your router is disabled -- if such a feature
is present.. let me know the result.

Raj

        Ahhh.  If you had your private key still, that should be
 possible.  I'd have to look up kmail to see whether it wants the user
 to specify a keyid (probably), or if it wants to browse to the secret
 keyring (doubt that).

        To find out details of your keys, you would do something like:

        You can get more details aboutthe keys as well, if you cared;
 try gpg --help.

        I hope this helps.

I missed to web page on router quirk. Sorry.

Best way to check this out is to do a telnet to the router IP port 8080 
and see what you get. If you get a HTTP server response string, then the 
forwarding is ok.

Subject: [Ilugc] [Semi-commercial][Discussion] What should Microsoft do?
Message-ID: <014b01c7f686$60a69950$6401a8c0@JANANI>

Hi,

I would like to seek your views on something...

Microsoft is criticised much by the FOSS community -- one or the other 
aspect of it. Their software, their ways of doing business, their attitude, 
whatever. My belief is that whenever somebody criticises they will also have 
a potential solution in mind -- and I felt, why is it that the solution 
aspect is barely discussed wrt the Microsoft issue :-) So, I am throwing 
this question open to you...

"Is there some aspect of Microsoft that you do not like? If so, what? And 
more importantly, how do you think they can correct this flaw of theirs (if 
you think they can)?"

I would really appreciate it if you could share your views on this.

Look forward to your response.

-----------------------------------------
And before I end this email, some clarifications...

(a) I was actually discussing this subject off-list with some FOSS veterans 
and users, when a friend suggest that I "get out of the acquarium" and throw 
the question open to the LUG mailing lists. Sensible! So, some of you might 
have already received my query on this off-list. Apologies for the 
repetition.
(b) This post is not commercial because I am raising this discussion in an 
individual capacity. That said, it might end up commercial in the future... 
because if this discussion turns out very interesting, I wish to offer 
snippets to Linux For You for publication (with the permission of those I 
wish to quote, of course).
(c) I am posting this query on more than only ILUG mailing list BUT I shall 
make sure the summary of the entire discussion reaches all the LUGs. If I 
offer it for publication, it will be available (licensed under creative 
commons) on the Open Content section of LFY's website openitis.com, so it 
will be available for all to see. If not, I will post a summary on the LUG 
mailing lists.

I know that ports on which local services run are not forwarded by the

that is forwarded.

Message-ID: <727912d50709140332y6dc6e7d3k2c5161fe72af7c8e@mail.gmail.com>

While installing debian in a machine I had chosen the following options.
1) Standard System
2) File Server.

The above 2 got installed without any errors. But when I log in as
root and try to run the service command i get the message as command
not found. What could be the problem

There is no service command in debian .

Try to ls /etc/init.d and find the name of the service you need.
then
#/etc/init.d/sname start  will start the service
#/etc/init.d/sname stop will stop the service
 sname= service name

Are you accessing the "WAN" port from your LAN?  If so, your packet is 
being processed at the LAN port of your router.  You need to access 
the "WAN" port from another node on the `Net e.g. your 
friend/colleague.

Subject: [Ilugc] Fedora 8 Test 2 Released
Message-ID: <46EABF50.7030403@fedoraproject.org>

Hi,

Official Announcement

https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2007-September/msg00002.html

Download

http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora.html

Release Notes

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/F8Test2/ReleaseNotes

New in Fedora 8 Test 2

The following sections provide a brief overview of major changes from 
the last release of Fedora.

Spins

Fedora includes several different spins, which are variations of Fedora 
built from a specific set of software packages. Each spin has a 
combination of software to meet the requirements of a specific kind of 
end user. In addition to a very small boot.iso image for network 
installation, users have the following spin choices:

* A regular Fedora image for desktops, workstations and server users. 
This spin provides a good upgrade path and similar environment for users 
of previous releases of Fedora.

* Fedora Live (i686, x86_64, ppc) - A good general use Desktop live 
image that uses GNOME. i686 version fits on a CD

* Fedora KDE Live (i686, x86_64) - A Desktop based on the KDE software 
suite. i686 version fits on a CD

* Fedora Developer Live (i686) - A Live image designed for software 
developers.

* Fedora Electronic Lab (FEL) Live (i686) - A live image designed for 
engineers working on electronics. Fits on a CD

Remember that these Live images can be used on USB media via the 
'livecd-iso-to-disk' utility available in the livecd-tools package.

Desktop

* A brand new graphical firewall configuration tool, 
system-config-firewall replaces system-config-securitylevel

* Iced Tea, Free and open source Java environment from Red Hat and 
others derived from OpenJDK as well as a browser plugin based on GCJ 
that takes advantage of Iced Tea is available and installed by default.

* Preview of Compiz Fusion, the compositing window manager from the 
remerge of Compiz and Beryl is installed by default. You can easily 
enable in GNOME via the desktop effects preference option. There is 
ongoing long term Xorg work to enable Compiz by default.

* We now have a new look and feel for this release called Infinity from 
the Fedora Art team.

* This test release features GNOME 2.20 Release Candidate.

* Nodoka, a fresh new GNOME theme created specially for Fedora is 
available in this release.

* KDE 3.5.7 is included in this release.

System Level Changes

* Fedora 8 Test 2 features a 2.6.23 based kernel.

* PulseAudio is now installed and enabled by default. PulseAudio is an 
advanced sound server which is compatible with nearly all existing Linux 
sound systems and allows for hot-switching audio outputs, individual 
volume controls for each audio stream, networked audio, and more.

version. Fedora has some 6 keyboard layout for Tamizh which if debianised 
will be useful for others also. I asked in vain and to get only rpm. aliegn 
couldn't help make the difference.

Everything is available in public CVS and SRPMS are available in public 
mirrors. So you don't need any middle man. mc and file roller can expand 
SRPMS FYI.

These customized images is interesting. I'm curious to
know whether these are available for previous
versions? (Or just even Fedora 7?)

The Live image for developers would include?; Is there
a URL where I get a comprehensive list of tools that
the developers' LIVE CD would include?

No. As stated in the heading, all the features listed are new for Fedora 
8 Test 2. Custom spins and open tools to enable them are a key focus 
area in Fedora for the past couple of releases but these specific spins 
are new for this release. The long term goal is make customization of 
Fedora at the distribution level (packages, rebranding, patches etc) as 
easy as possible.

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/CustomSpins

I am working on a games spin in addition to the ones listed that is 
likely to be available by the next and final test release.

It is a Live DVD rather than a CD and this is ongoing work where many 
details need to be fine tuned. The current list of packages include 
Eclipse, Koji (Fedora build system), system tap, frysk, emacs, basic 
toolchain (gcc et all), debug info packages etc.  See the release notes 
and above link for more information.

Message-ID: <252791.83407.qm@web36811.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I have Fedora 7 installed on Compaq Presario v3139 AU.
   
  My problem is that my system hangs whenver i login as root user in GUI mode.
   
  I can login anytime to a non-root user
  i can login as root only at command-line.
  if i type "startx", the system logs in , dislplays wallpaper and then hangs.
  this happens only in root user.
   
  and i can use the "su" command.
   
  so what may be the problem. where can i see the error generated.

Hello all,
       Software Freedom Day Celebrations are scheduled to commence
here at MIT at 3:00 PM at AU-KBC Research Centre..

      The schedule includes talks on various topics relating to FOSS..
With Gaming on Linux being a major part of the events along with Q&A
Sessions..

      Mainly aimed at beginners and newbies to FOSS.. SFD at MIT is
more of a fun fete than a technical event..

      So on behalf of Computer Society of MIT, I invite all LUG
members to be a part of the celebration..

     For those who are not familiar about where exactly Madras
Institute Of Technology(MIT) is located.. It is right beside Chromepet
Railway station and Bus Stop..

  Route:

Have you selected the "Allow system administrator login" option under
security tab in gnome's login manager.. You can access it by pressing
F10..

 I dont know exactly why your system hangs when you enter GUI as
root.. It must actually throw an error saying that root is not allowed
login..

Hope this helps... Please do inform if it was some other error..

yes, and just because it runs without an error message, check the log  
to see if the service has really stopped or started.

Accepted. It was mentioned for package installations, but you are
right about the verbosity. I aplogize for overlooking this.

Dear friends,
Although I am a longtime user of Linux ,I log into win
98 for 2 reasons:
1. To access BSNL's portal -this used to recognise
only IE.Accessing BSNL from linux through wine and
IE(ies4linux) was really painful.

2. Listen to latest tamil songs from Raaga.com.

The 1st reason has been eliminated ,BSNL now knows
about Firefox.

The 2nd reason still exists.
I have seen some mails on how to do it in Linux ,but I
have never been able to it .
I have installed latest helixplayer from Real,made
entries in about:config of Firefox ,etc,but nothing
worked.
Can somebody give some clues and links.I am running
Debian-lenny(for reading mail of Amachu and
friends-Arch does not know tamil) and Archlinux,
updated weekly.

Thanking you.
TPD.

Hello all,
      Software Freedom Day was celebrated today at MIT in a simple but
joyous way with talks, snacks and games..

     The gathering of about 50 students from MIT had their first taste
of FOSS, through an introductory talk given by Mr.Raman, then followed
by Amachu who added a touch of humor to the proceedings with his talk
on FOSS in education.. Both Raman and Amachu explained what Software
Freedom Day was all about in their own unique way.

     Sudharsan from Andal Azhagar College of Engineering enlightened
the group on how one could contribute to FOSS while Sanjeev, Ponnusamy
and Prakash of NRCFOSS answered queries from curious students.

     The talks were followed by video presentations taken from the web
which brought out the uniqueness and power of GNU/Linux and FOSS.

     After snacks being served, the students were allowed to play with
open source through multiplayer games like open arena, frozen-bubble 2
and racing games such as vdrift and torcs. Additional games played
were pingus, tuxmath and blobby volley 2.

    A special thanks goes to Rajeev of NRCFOSS for helping out with
configuration and testing of the games.

   And I thank Dr.Srinivasan, NRCFOSS for providing the seminar hall
at AU-KBC for conducting the talks and presentations.

   Overall feedback from the students was overwhelming and that proved
the event a grand success in spreading the message of FOSS.

Sivabalan T,

 Hmm.. why do you think M$ is singled out? We have companies like IBM,
sun microsystems etc. respected by FOSS community. Those companies are
also doing business, writing software.

 So why not throw the question to M$, why they are not ready to accept others ?

BTW, cross posting and having discussion across multiple lists is a
very bad idea.

thank you.. i have port forwarded port 41286 in my router and it works
fine when accessed from outside..

can u please explain more on the LAN and WAN ports..

and also when the port is forwarded with UDP protocol,, my web server
is not accessible.. why??

and when i give the domain name separately.. like foo.foo.net/ it
displays a page with 'It works!'.. when i give it with
foo.foo.net/index.html only the page of my router settings is
displayed...

Can i take it that.. it's because of the fact that maybe in the
DirectoryIndex entry of conf file of micro_http runnin on the router..
some other file is given as the index page instead of index.html...
or am i simply complicating things..?

Also the 'It works' page comes only when i use foo.foo.net/ in the
addr line.. and the setting page only appears when i use my local lan
ip of the router or its external ip at that time.... So what is
exactly happening here??

Thanks,

In general, each app needs to sort based on sort order (collation)
defined in the locale (ta_IN, in this case).
Ideally, defining the appropriate locale in posgres or python
should work.

If you give foo.foo.net, you will land on the router and show the router 
page if administration access is enabled on the WAN port. If you give 
foo.foo.net:41286 then your packets will be forwarded.

Behaviour you have described looks weird. Have you missed telling us 
something else?

afaik unicode sort will just be by the numbers allotted to each  
letter. The tamil unicode chart more or less follows tamil  
aphabetical order with a few letters out of place:

 A simple but effective solution.
 Good work guys. Really this is one of the most innovative attempts I
have seen from India. One good example of interactive learning.

 The concept is good and execution of concept is equally good. But I
think the interface needs to be spiced up a bit. We need some more
interactivity in the interface.

 For example
http://arichuvadi.nrcfosshelpline.in/web/ordered_alph/1/CV/
 Content on afore mentioned page can be paginated for easy viewing.
Also, on mouse over you can show a larger image. Large image can show
stroke sequence like shown in this page on Chinese characters
http://www.sungwh.freeserve.co.uk/sapienti/bihua.htm
 Please notice how they use different colours to represent the
sequence of strokes.

 An interactive and thoughtfully done user interface experience will
not only ,  help in creating the learning environment, it will bring
back users to the site again and again.

 Found one more problem. In the above mentioned page, is it possible
to get rid of sms spk? You have 800x600 pixel resolution screen, use
it to properly. It does not make sense to have leg twisted language as
a medium for teaching another language.

Dear Kenneth,
		You can use service command in debian, by installing the
debian-helper-scripts deb package. Then its as easy as writing

service <servicename> start|stop|restart

Of course as root :).

This is exactly what I am seeing,

when i give the domain name separately.. like foo.foo.net/ it
  displays a page with 'It works!'.. when i give it with
  foo.foo.net/index.html only the page of my router settings is
  displayed...

  Please verify.. Is it because of the fact that maybe in the
DirectoryIndex entry of conf file of micro_http runnin on the router..
some other file is given as the index page instead of index.html...
or am i simply complicating things..?

Also the 'It works' page comes only when i use foo.foo.net/ in the
addr line..
      the router setting page appears only when i use my local lan
ip(192.168.1.1) of the router or its external ip(122.164.yyy.yyy) at
that time ....
     So what is exactly happening here??

Sorry if i am repeating my previous post but this is what happens.
If you are expecting something which I maybe missing please do ask about it.
I am glad to give more details.

Thanks,
Sivabalan T

Dear Kenneth,
      I just went through the lesson.. overall its an excellent work..
                I found minor problems in the text and sound..
               In "I am fine" part.. the wrt part has 'nanraga
irukkindraen' but amachu's voice says 'naanum nanraga irukkindraen'..
please check that.. also the spk part has 'nalla irukkaen' and thr
voice says 'naanum nalla irukkaen vaasuji'..
               In 'please have a seat..' section.. in the spk part
there is an extra 'sari sari' in the beginning of the voice.
               In 'Its fine'.. there is a 'ka' missing at end of
'nallapadia' in wrt and the 'irunthuthu' in wrt and spk parts must be
interchanged along with adding 'padia' to the 'nalla' text in spk
part.
               In the section abt the wife.. the voice is incomplete
both in wrt and spk sections.
               In 'hai' section.. spk part voice is incomplete..
               In coffee tea section.. in wrt part.. voice says
'irukkumae' for 'irupeerkal' in the text.. and also the 'tea' in the
text is left out in the voice.
               in spk part.. voice says 'vanakkamga' for 'vanakkam' in
the text.. and also the 'tea' in the text is left out here too.. for
'coffee' in the text voice says 'coffeeya'..
               In next section.. in the spk part there is an extra
'ellam' and 'konjam' in the voice....
               Last section.. in wrt part text says
'pesikondirukkavum' voice says 'pesikondirungal'.. also 'vidukiraen'
is text and voice tells 'vidukindraen'..
               in spk part text -- 'pesikkiturunga',, voice --
'pesittirunga'..

Some of these corrections maybe really trivial but maybe not so for an
absolute newbie to tamil.

Why is it not possible to hear a sound which is already played..
except for few sounds?
Is it meant to be like that.. or its just my browser?

I checked all this in iceweasel browser in debian etch..

Hope this helps,
Sivabalan T

        This is not a package that is in Debian; so this is not likely
 to help the OP unless you also mention where you got this package from.

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---

--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---

        Personally,  I would hesitate to recommend running, as root,
 commands from a package of unproven provenance on your machine.

You don't even need a PC, you can install it on a virtual machine. A
few months I tried out the OLPC iso a virtual box VM.

Did you extract the image to an existing Linux VM running on Virtual
Box or you booted from image directly?

Would you share please?

*SOFTWARE FREEDOM DAY `07*



Free Software/Open Source's have been silent achievers over the last few
years. They are gaining momentum now due to growing popularity and awareness
among individuals to start a drive against proprietary products. As a
commemoration to this ode, Jaya FOSS Club (JFC) celebrated *SOFTWARE FREEDOM
DAY *on September 14 th at Jaya Engineering college premises. More than 650
participants took part in various events conducted on that day.



*Richard M.Stallman, *Founder of GNU Project and Free Software Foundation *sent
the following message:*



*"The students of **Jaya** **Engineering** **College** are fortunate that
you are holding an event that will teach them about the ethics of free
software: about the freedoms that they and all software users are entitled
to.

Teaching the use of computers and the writing of programs is not enough: the
most important subject in computing is that of the freedom that users should
have.  Every citizen of cyberspace needs to appreciate and understand
freedom.  Every school should teach its students this, but most schools do
not.  By holding this event, you begin to fill this gap in the curriculum.
 In the future, the school should add this subject to the coursework, and
give every student
practical experience of living in freedom by migrating all the school's
computers to free software*



*Yours in freedom,
Richard Stallman.**" ***



 The event was presided over my *Prof. Dr.C.N.Krishnan*, Director, AU-KBC
Research Center & Coordinator NRCFOSS, MIT-Anna University. His valuable
address on the importance of freedom and applications being available on
open domain was an eye-opener to students. In order to involve greater
participation and inspiration, the proceedings of the day were kept open to
students from all departments and also from all colleges across the city.





Prior to this event banners were put up all over the college etching out
slogans in favor of Open source and also throwing light upon the basic
misconceptions that one perceives with regard to open source. With an aim to
propagate and also motivate students towards this realm, an array of events
were held ranging from Technical Talk to online quiz and banner design.



A very lively group discussion was also arranged for on the topic "Free
software vs. Proprietary products ". *T.Shrinivasan* of the ILUGC (Indian
Linux User Group-Chennai) also participated and shared their time and
thoughts with us.



We also plan to conduct a "FREE SOFTWARE DEMO DAY" during 1st & 2nd February
2008. We expect a similar support from ILUGC for making the event a grand
success.



Every participant was given a complimentary CD containing a few basic open
source applications. ISO image of many distributions were also available
with us which were given to those approached us. Students were awarded with
merit certificates and trophies alongside participation certificates to
encourage them.

I ran from the ISO directly. This page has the details:
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Build_images

The Live CD image:
http://olpc.download.redhat.com/olpc/streams/sdk/latest/livecd/olpc-redhat-stream-sdk-livecd.iso

Just download the live cd iso and boot from the image instead of CD
drive. That's a standard option in most virtualization products like
vmware or virtual box.

        Sounds like the failing tests were done with website is looking
 at the user agent and flaking out (since iceweasel _is_ firefox -- so
 the client side functionality is unlikely to be different).

        Again, that is not a package in Debian.  Adding in packages
 meant for another distribution  might lead to subtle breakage (I know
 of several cases where ubuntu packages hose Debian systems).

        Not something I would recommend.

This package doesn't do much. Just creates symbolic links.. that's all..
Makes life easier for an admin :).  So I don't think problems will be there.
We have it installed on Debian etch servers here. No problems till now.

 I need to receive alerts/pages  on handheld device 
(cellphones/pagers/blackberry)

I have been exploring various options to do the same,
Here are some,

1. Pagers - they are very rare in chennai, so are expensive than other 
options.

2. GPRS -  can anyone suggest me some application which sends 
alerts/beeps  when  I receive an email. ?
I have used nokia cell phone with symbion os + gmail mobile app  for 
receiving emails, but that doesnt give sms like alerts.

3. Blackberry - seems liek a good option, but is expensive than the 
rest.(  phone +  899 subscription charges per month)


If anyone is doing sysadmin job, they might have an idea about these 
kind of things.
Your inputs are welcome.

Hi All

I need to test a usb printer from my  user space test code. The test code
could do it well when i am a 'root user' but fails when i login as a 'normal
user'  .

When i do strace , i get the following permission issues:

open("/proc/bus/usb/004/025", O_RDWR)   = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
open("/proc/bus/usb/004/025", O_RDONLY) = 3

To get the info of the product
ioctl(3, USBDEVFS_CONTROL, 0xbffff1c0)  = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)

I am using 2.4.21-37.EL. and 'lsusb' works fine always.

Can anyone please give me some clue on this issue and let me know if any
other details required.

Thanks

thanks for the information. By writing sms?, I meant that the OP  
could use sms to send alerts to his mobile phone as many sysadmins do.

Thank you for enlightening me on SMS.  

Let me elaborate on my  requirements,

1. We have automated scripts which would send out EMAILS  to a specific 
address.  Most of these will be short messages , 1or 2 lines.
2. I need to receive these emails on my cellphone or alphanumeric pager. 
And i need to have alerts set for the same. I cant get up in the middle 
of the night and open
some application to check my emails. I need to receive some audible 
alerts as we do with sms.

Airtel, Hutch  and many such telcos had a email to sms service whereas 
you send an email to e.g.  <MY_NUMBER>@airtel.co.in  , and I would 
receive it on my cellphone.

These services are no longer available , atleast not that i know of.  if 
anyone knows if any telco providing this service, please let me know.

 In that case you need to tie up with some sms gateway. Then write a
program which uses the sms gateway API to send the sms.

In this case, the email->mobile gateway->sms option would be suitable.
http://www.smscountry.com/ is one such service provider.

> you need to send alerts from India to US, or from US to India?

from servers located in US+india   to cellphone in India . basically the 
alerts should go to email address  which will be received on my handheld 
device in India in turns.
Blackberry does the same,  so do alphanumeric pagers.  These are good 
enough to get the work done, but not most economicaly feasible.
I am looking  for the optimal solution.  'GPRS + email application  e.g 
gmail app ' is another solution, but in this case i dont get sms lke 
alerts. I need to open the application
and check for the emails every time. This wont work all the times as I 
would be getting time critical alerts.

I do believe that blackberry or such service would be more feasible in these cases. Thanks for your inputs though.

cheapest would be email from US to India, receive it on your machine  
here which would send sms to you in India. All you need to do is to  
buy an extra cellphone

Hi KG,
I am not able to hear the sound in firefox 1.5 and 2.0.

I have the required plugins to play ogg files and am able to hear
the text by manually copying the link in the address bar.

Though hovering over the link is a good option, you can link the
"Play" text to the sound files as a fallback.

Blackberry? I know this is an expensive option, but hey, if you have a

Message-ID: <69621d830709171414p43de73b0w7e020fbb4eba42da@mail.gmail.com>

I read this in one mailing list. This is nice. You should read it. 8-)


There's an old joke that begins like this: What if operating systems
were airlines?

   * Windows Airlines -- The terminal is pretty and colorful, with
friendly stewards, easy baggage check and boarding, and a smooth
take-off. After about 10 minutes in the air, the plane explodes with
no warning whatsoever.

   * Mac Airlines -- All the stewards, stewardesses, captains,
baggage handlers and ticket agents look the same, act the same, and
talk the same. Every time you ask questions about details, you are
told you don't need to know, don't want to know, and would you please
return to your seat and watch the movie.

   * Linux Airlines -- Disgruntled employees of all the other OS
airlines decide to start their own airline. They build the planes,
ticket counters, and pave the runways themselves. They charge a small
fee to cover the cost of printing the ticket, but you can also
download and print the ticket yourself. When you board the plane, you
are given a seat, four bolts, a wrench and a copy of the
seat-HOWTO.html. Once settled, the fully adjustable seat is very
comfortable, the plane leaves and arrives on time without a single
problem, the in-flight meal is wonderful. You try to tell customers of
the other airlines about the great trip, but all they can say is, 'You
had to do what with the seat?'



I took the joke from (http://www.desktoplinux.com/articles/AT3304051309.html
)

:)

What do you say? How is the joke?

Best,
Zico

Nokia N70 have such a facility. In Messaging you can configure to
download and send mails using POP3 and SMTP. It does beep also when
you get a mail. You need GPRS connection for this, ofcourse. Configure
to poll the POP3 server automatically.

The Mail2SMS service is stopped by most of the operators. Even if it
is running, most of the time, you will get the SMS with 5 to 10hrs of
delay :)

I heard, few operators are providing HTTP accounts for sending bulk
SMS. Try that.

Several cellphone providers that offer sms also provide an email to sms
gateway so sending to cellphone-number@provider.com usually sends an alert
to the cellphone.

Actually, I tried this option a while back - I don't know about other 
service providers, but it didn't work on Airtel-TN, at least.

I think phonenumber@airteltn.com should work - but mail.airteltn.com seems
to be dead slow at accepting emails ... I wouldn't bank on a very fast
receipt of any sms you send in this manner. Using a kannel gateway as
someone else suggested would be the way to go.

Kannel is not suitable for the new model phone with-out serial i/f. If
you can get SMSC SMPP account, then fine. But now a days, operators
are not welling open the SMPP i/f to external members and it is costly
too. 

Any bluetooth based solutions?

HI ,

I have been facing slow disk access in my system .

And any time I do any write activity and along side carry on my work.
The system becomes very unresponsive.Sometimes even changing focus takes 3+
seconds.
Memory usage is not high neither is cpu usage.

Suspecting something to be wrong with the I/O.

I ran various hdparm options to diagnose.

DMA is on,

I found that the buffered disk reads are very slow compared to what it
should be , in both the PATA and SATA disks.

solar:/home/solar# hdparm -tT /dev/hda

/dev/hda:
 Timing cached reads:   1260 MB in  2.00 seconds = 629.57 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   50 MB in  3.01 seconds =  16.61 MB/sec
solar:/home/solar# hdparm -tT /dev/sda

/dev/sda:
 Timing cached reads:   1238 MB in  2.00 seconds = 618.51 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  102 MB in  3.82 seconds =  26.67 MB/sec

Kindly help me fix this issue.

I am on debian lenny (64 bit)

AMD 64 2800+

The new libata library deprecates the old IDE layer.
The PATA devices would be exposed as /dev/sd* .
You have a /dev/hda - indicating that you are using older drivers.
Can you post the o/p of lspci -v   and lsmod ?

1. No bluetooth solutions exist on low end phones as services on handset 
is curtailed.
2. Kannel may be an overkill. Ubuntu comes with a SMS gateway package. 
Gnokii/Gammu/ Wammu can also be used.
3. Best option (given that your servers are remote) is to use a WebSMS 
interface with a web services/HTTP/ SMPP API. Look up links below. 
its4sms looks a better bet. I did explore them for an application that 
required a 2 way SMS interaction.
4. For kicks, you can connect on a serial port as a terminal to a phone 
and send SMS thro' AT commands.

Try booting with the kernel boot time parameters :
"combined_mode=libata" or "combined_mode=ide"

For more info, check this : http://linux-ata.org/faq.html
Also see if your IDE device has a new libata driver in the supported devices list, in the same site.

You can post the output from :-
$cat /proc/ide/drivers

The driver in OPENSuSE10.2 with 2.6.18.2-34 kernel is "ide-disk version 1.18
"
More specifically if possible post the /proc/ide/hd8/drivers output

Even with "old" IDE drivers (as others have suggested) you should see 
better performance than what you are getting.   I have experienced this 
a few times; the hdd were RIP'd in a few days/weeks.  The problem could 
be with the IDE channel or your hdd.

Check out your hardware and replace the failing device.

Gmail showed Karthik Ramgopal's mail as the first mail in the thread
and the subject didn't have "(was something else)" kind of tag. So how
would I know it is not entire thread?

look at the archives - the first mail asked about services, and the  
second mail mentioned that debian does it with /etc/init.d ... and  
then there was a mini flame war about using ubuntu debs in debian,  
and then you stepped in to state what everyone knew in the first place.

Isn't it obvious?

If you want a normal user to manipulate the device then try adding the
udev rules or manually do a chmod and try.

Thanks for your response.

With chmod, it works but its a temporary solution. if i restart or
re-connect the device , the permissions are again the default one.
I dont have /udev or /sys in my system.  Is udev available in
2.4.21-37.ELkernel.  Do i need to re-install or pl let me know if any
other option.

I need this bcoz i want to read usb device's configuration from the
testfile  and need to open the file in /proc/bus/usb/XXX/YYY as normal user
and not as an root user.

Only  read  permissions are available for the file  /proc/bus/usb/XXX/YYY
to the normal user and i want to have rw permissions.


thanks
ravi

AFAIK, PATA hasn't been totally removed from mainstream motherboards, for the reason that SATA optical devices haven't become popular yet.
So, if you buy a board with SATA, there's a fair chance that it will have at least a couple of PATA slots too.

outdated and they're now throwing it out but getting some PR from it.

Also, it is free in price, but still proprietary in terms if license,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0709191520220.1996-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

(1) TECH TIP: Debugging a core dump

If a program crashes with a core dump then, it is easy to debug and find
the last internal state of the program.  When we run multiple programs or
threads, then it is difficult to find which core was generated by which
process. To resolve this, there are a few settings  available in  /proc,
which will help us to add more detail in the core file name.

Support available from Kernel v2.4. Setting '1' to this file, will
generate a core file with PID. For example: core.1234
/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid

Support available from Kernel v2.5.  This file provides more control
to form the core file name. /proc/sys/kernel/core_patten

This is very similar to setting the core_uses_pid option.
echo "core.%p" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

By setting this value, core file will be generated with the following
details: executable filename, PID of the dumped process and number of
the signal causing the dump. 
echo "core.%e.%p.%s" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

More useful options are explained in the proc man page.

(2) TECH TIP: Keyword Search in Firefox

Firefox is a great browser, but you already knew that, right?
Firefox's keywords facility can be used for a neat search trick. It is
best used for a directed search engine that digs specific data-for
example, a Bugzilla search, IMDb search, LXR search or Marcel/wine
search http://www.wine-searcher.com, and so on. Here are the steps:

   1. Using Firefox, go to a site that offers a simple search 
      facility (for example, IMDb, LXR or your local Bugzilla).
   2. Place the cursor within the search box.
   3. Right-click, and select Add a Keyword for this Search.
   4. Give your new search shortcut a name.
   5. Give your new search shortcut a short keyword (for example, 
      I use bz for my Bugzilla search and lxr for LXR).

That's it.  To try out your new keyword search shortcut, open a new
tab (Ctrl-T), place the cursor at the location bar (Ctrl-L), type your
keyword followed by the search term(s)-for example, assuming you added
keyword bz for the search at http://bugzilla.mozilla.org, then typing
"bz 95849" in the location bar will show you this:  
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=95849.

This is an ideal way to use a search engine that digs through some
specific data.

HTH :)

IBM has tons of obsolete software suites, operating systems etc.

They are hoping to replicate what DEC did by opening up VAX/VMS I guess ..

This looks like Notes 8 without the collaboration parts. It is basically 
Eclipse which embeds OpenOffice inside it. Looks very pretty but rather 
slow.

I feel that my communication is not properly done in explaining the problem.
Let me tell again.

When i connect any usb device like printer or mp3 player, the permissions
for non-root user to the devices  are read only.
So i am not able to send any commands to the device as a non-root user from
test code which just tries to get the vendor and product IDs

I tried with changing mtab.fstab but failed.

 The test code works fine when i am root user. Pl let me know if any details
required.

thanks
ravi

I understood you the first time.

If your user is in the lp/lpadmin group you can access a printer when not
root. If your user is in group audio, you can tweak your speaker volume,
play mp3s etc. Clear now?

Well, in this case, Linus elaborates on why he feels the design and
implementation issues make him dislike C++, and how encapsulation also
often "hides" serious inefficiencies (and even bugs) in code.

Another person in support of his view also mentioned this:

string s = a + "/share/" + b + c;

One can't tell how many lines of code or how much memory this is going
to take.

Do read the discussion fully when you reach a PC. :-)

I read it - I am now on a fast link, but when I travel I use gprs  
(with a PC), and most of my work is through ssh which means each time

Reporting this here is unlikely to help. Contact the webmaster and 
inform them with some references what percentage of users they are 
likely to lose by non-standard features.  The error message says that 
Netscape Navigator is supported. Since the recent Netscape versions are 
themselves based on Firefox, there is unlikely to be many techical 
changes required. They probably just need to drop the explicit user 
agent check. You can verify this via the user agent switcher addon in 
Firefox.

https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/59

Alternatively report this website to Firefox team via help -> report 
broken website in Firefox. I have done that for you now.

Did you mean uploading images and then using them in the pages you want?
I guess you are missing upload image module in FCKeditor. I am not sure much
about FCkeditor.

But I completed similar functionality using Tinymce and Drupal upload
module.
TinyMCE works very well with Drupal.

hope this helps.

Hi,
    Whenever i try to upload files using either Firefox or Opera, it 
times out. I get "waiting for sitename.." for a long time, then Firefox 
says "400 Bad Request". Opera says it timed out. Using a different 
browser doesnt seem to resolve the problem. I`m using Feisty Fawn. Any 
idea why this is happening?

You could diagnose it with a bandwidth monitor like wmnet which I
regularly use. It is graphical and shows uploads in white and downloads
in red. It also informs the rate.

It is a WindowMaker applet.

There are several other alternatives too.

ifstat
iftop
bwmon

and so on.

It could even be a site problem and it might coincide with your usage of
a particular browser.

Best,

Thanks krishna..
 but i am not using.. drupal..
 actually i found the problem..
 it is the permission problem..
 when i am using it in the local .. i don't get this error.."you have no
permission to create folder error  "
but i do get this..when i upload it to my live server..
let me explain you....
 when i try to upload image using the "insert/edit image" button in the
FCKEditor

($Config['UserFilesPath'] = '/userfiles/') a "userfiles" folder is
created...

but this folder's owner is set to "apache" and rest of the floder's owner is
set to "xyz" who is one of the previleged user. who has (777) permission
now  i want to change the owner of the "userfiles" directory from  " apache
" user to "xyz"
 or set the permission as 777 to userfiles directory

any idea..where to change..?

hope this helps.

Am looking for a software which will open autocad files also. It was
mentioned in this thread that qcad does not open autocad dwg files.
There is no software called qtcad.

I`ve tried wmnet and ifstat - i think i lack the skill to make any sense 
of the data they display. Whenever i try  to upload a file, the  ifstat  
output goes like this:

The problem persists across multiple browsers and multiple sites too. I

This is a major area where free software is lacking. Perhaps we people at
IIT Madras can start a project for a free software replacement of AutoCAD?
The expertise of our departments in engineering, and in programming, should
be sufficient. Also, The central government will be willing to fund it.

Godrej SW (now Geometric SW Systems) had a package GCAD which is long 
dead. Licencing it under GPL and enhancing it would be a great move.

the central govt has funded a cad software made by NIC, it runs on  
linux and is made with freesoftware tools - but it is not free. It is  
very good - but the gov expects nic to sell it and make money from  
it. Ive forgotten the name, but we have a copy in nrc-foss

if you really want to do something, contribute to the development of  
blender-cad. That is the cad software of the future, as it's parent  
blender is competing with professional proprietary software in the 3d  
animation world.

Even after all these years the Govt still can't shake off the aura of

Can it read Autocad drawings?
Open office took off because it could read MS Office
docs.
Any foss CAD program can take off only if it can read
Auto cad files - this will ease transition for the
janata.

Message-ID: <20070922140344.GA9870@lakshmi.susmita.org>

Dear all,

     Please find the audio of the talk at http://nikegravel.com/seminar

     or use this direct link http://nikegravel.com/seminar/audio.html

     I have attached a readme for your reference.

     Kudos to Senthil Kumar of NMSworks for recording.

     Some sessions are missing. We were unable to process the files.
     Sorry about that!

     Should you have any questions please mail
     koushik.narayanan@gmail.com or girish1729@gmail.com

Best,
Girish

This is a document that explains what we did to  get the audio to you.

As always there is a great level of technical detail for those who
might want to do such a thing in future.

The original sound files recorded by Senthil Kumar of NMSWorks,
IIT using his mobile were in AMR (Adaptive MultiRate) format.

It is easier to convert them to uncompressed PCM (WAV) and then do
the processing or further conversion.

To convert AMR to WAV there are 3 possible ways (AFAIK)

1.) Use ffmpeg with amr_nb support 
2.) Use mplayer with amr support
3.) Use the decoder provided by 3gpp.

ffmpeg segfaults when decoding files with greater than a minute of
audio. The decoder provided by 3gpp is difficult to use. So the choice
is mplayer. The command will be:

mplayer -ao pcm:fast:file=filename.wav filename.amr

To convert all the files at once, the shell can be used:

#!/bin/sh
# Convert all amr files to wav
mkdir wav 
for i in *.amr 
do
	mplayer -ao pcm:fast:file=`basename $i .amr`.wav $i
done

Now that we have the wav files sophisticated post processing can be done. 
Here increasing volume is of prime importance as the audibility of 
most files are extremely low. Increasing volume
can be done with sox (-V) or with normalize. A batch normalization of
all files is done using the following command:

normalize -a 0.5 wav/*.wav

Then individual files are tested for audiblity. If required further
boosting is done using

normalize -a 1 wav/cracking-tools.wav

Once the processed audio is obtained, encoding to compressing formats
can be done. AAC,Ogg Vorbis and MP3 are the formats of choice. The
following script does the encoding with tagging.

To get an appropriate title tag for each file, each file was named
appropriately so that it can be extracted and used.

encode.sh:

#!/bin/bash

mkdir mp4-cover-art
mkdir mp4
mkdir ogg
mkdir mp3

album="Seminar on TCP/IP Networking,Cryptography and Spam Control"
artist="Girish Venkatachalam"
year=2007
comment="http://nikegravel.com/seminar/"

for i in *.wav
do
	name=`basename $i .wav`
	# mp4 without cover art
	faac -o mp4/$name.mp4 --title "$name" --year "$year" \
	--artist "$artist" --comment "$comment" --album "$album" $i
	# mp4 with cover art
	faac -o mp4-cover-art/$name.mp4 --title "$name" --year "$year"\
	--artist "$artist" --comment "$comment" --album "$album" \
	--cover-art seminarlogo.png $i
	# ogg
	oggenc -o ogg/$name.ogg  -t "$name" -a "$artist" -c "$comment" \
	-d "$year" -l "$album" $i
	# mp3
	lame --tt "$name" --ta "$artist" --ty "$year" --tc "$comment" \
	--tl "$album"  $i mp3/$name.mp3
done


Note that this also takes care of adding the appropriate ID tags.

Hi,

I'm using gutsy gibbon, and am using ftp.iitm.ac.in mirror for upgrades.

I almost always get some 404 errors about files not being found. I
then end up doing --fix-missing (which sort of screwed my kernel
recently).

Can this issue be fixed?

Thanks,

I have forwarded this query to Dr. Sriram, the admin of that
server. But my guess is that the Gutsy packages have not yet been
populated fully, though it'd be best to see what Dr. Sriram replies.

i dont know; the ubuntu master mirror seems to be slow in sending us
updates, especially the gutsy packages. the daily syncs which used to take
4-6 hrs are now taking > 24 hrs, which is obviously going to pose
problems.

This is called as thread-hijacking. When you have question which is
unrelated to any on going threads or earlier threads, please start a
new thread otherwise the entire purposes and threading is lost as your
query get posted in an entirely unrelated thread. People who are
interested in the hijacked thread might get pissed off seeing an
entirely unrelated posting into the thread. Similarly, some one who
might have answered your query might miss your query at all since he
might not read the hijacked thread or will prefer not to as you
hijacked some other thread.

Hi,

Creating a new thread because the original was hijacked.

Try this:

echo -e "foo\nar\nbaz\n&nbsp;\nbah\nblah\n&nbsp\n;jgei\n&;\n&\nfoo_bar;" | \
sed -n 's/&[a-z]\{1,\};/&/gpw nbsp'

You should see the output on your terminal window and it'll also be written to 
the file nbsp.

I didn't understand if you wanted the whole line or just the matched word 
written to the file. The above will write out only the matched word.

In case you want the whole line written out, look up O'Reilly's sed & awk. Its 
worth it. :)

HTH.

Hmm. I had deleted the mail initially, assuming it belonged to the `Free

you could do something like this assuming you give the input  filename(s) as 
arguments and output filename is resultfile .


open(RESULTFILE ,">resultfile") || die("Cannot Open File");
foreach(<>)
{

foreach  (split(/ /,$_))
{
	 print RESULTFILE  $1."\n" if(m/^&(\w+)$\;/)  
}

  
}

This is just a 2 min script to give you an idea.
Remember a line has been split into words so tat if there is more than 1 word 
in a line all of them get matched. ofcourse  you can try the m//g approach 
and avoid one inner loop .
You can optimize this further and yet make it a one liner

        I have found Planner to be more than good enough -- and it is
 free software to boot.

Hundreds in lug can help you with this but I will be the one to bell the
cat.

$ grep '&.*;' foo.txt 

seems to get you the relevant lines.

Now if you are interested in merely catching hold of the words like
&amp; then you will have to use the capture feature of regexes. Perl and
sed normally use '(' and ')' around the regex for this.

So you would do something like this.

Say you have a file foo.txt with the following

<foo.txt>

What is going on?

This line messed is up.

</foo.txt>

Now if you want to swap the words 'is' and 'messed' you can do this.

$ perl -pi -e 's/(messed).*(is)/\2 \1/' foo.txt

Here '\1' captures the first string within '(' ')' and '\2' captures
the second.

So you can play with them any way you like. But remember that regexes
work only for the match section, not for the substitute section.

Hopefully this will get you started with regexes.

In your case you will have an expression like this.
 
-e 's/(&.*;)/'

  But does planner open existing M$ Project files
since Projity does and is also so remarkably similar
to M$ Project. For those who cannot afford the
licensing of Project but have to use Project files,
seems like a good option.

        I have never tried.  I think there are some efforts in that
 regard, but I have no idea how complete they are.  But if all you want
 to do is project planning, there is a Linux tool that performs as well
 as the expensive, closed source MS offering.

        You know, this is a forum  for free software  -- so we can at
 least pretend to prefer free software -- when the functionality is the
 same in the free version.  I find projity to be far more expensive than
 planner -- too expensive for me.

I have  gone thru the link
http://piklab.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Port_connection_problems, and
tried as said in the link  "username is already member of many groups, such
as *audio, dip, video* and some others. Add in this field just *, lp* and
leave the system manager. "

i have run the redhat-config-users and played with adding new group , adding
username to lp.
Not sure what wrong i have done..after logging out and in..the results
changed with my test code and lsusb.

The output of lsusb is nil now:
$
$ lsusb
$
whereas earlier it is

$
$lsusb
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000

TECH TIP: Choose Graphics Formats Wisely

There's a reason so many different image file formats have been
developed: Not every format works well in every situation. If you have
solid text in an image that has not gradients, use the GIF format.
Because it uses only 8 bits per pixel, for color information, the GIF
format works well for images that have only a few colors (256 or less)
and strong contrast (as black text on a white background does). The
GIF format also provides lossless compression, which means it
compresses the images as much as it can without sacrificing image
quality. But skip the GIF format if you have photographs to display.

Photographs are better handled using the JPEG format, which was
specifically designed for photographs based upon how the human eye
perceives color. Using 24 bits (three 8-bit channels) to represent
each pixel, the JPEG format easily handles up to 16 million colors.
Unlike the GIF format, the JPEG format's compression is described as
lossy, which means (theoretically, at least) that by using it you are
throwing away data. The actual data loss is usually trivial, however,
and you can specify how much you want to compress an image, depending
on the degree of quality loss you are willing to accept. A bigger
disadvantage for some artists may be that the JPEG format doesn't
handle transparancy information. The GIF format does, but it can only
interpret transparency as either on or off for any given pixel,
leading to "stairsteps" in non rectangular regions of your image.

The PNG format, on the other hand, can handle various levels of
transparency and millions of colors. It also offers lossless
compression, so no data is sacrificed. Unfortunately, not all browsers
fully support the PNG format. For example, some recent versions of
Internet Explorer can't display PNG images if they contain
transparency information. If only all of our Website visitors used
Firefox!

Choose file formats wisely. Using JPEG images for every project just
isn't a good enough solution. And if you think choosing among these
choices is annoying, just wait until the Web (and all those browsers)
finally support vector images. Viva la SVG !

Message-ID: <139e14f00709262225y57cfcba5n4be9d4c8a05dbbf0@mail.gmail.com>

The modem comes with a installation CD. User Manual in pdf format has a
section for Linux. I tried it in SuSe Linux 10.2

1. Insert the Modem in USB port (USB drive is loaded and modem is
recognized)
2. run wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf to create the configuration script.
3. Edit the script to :
[Dialer Defaults]
Modem = /dev/ttyACM0
Baud = 460800
Init1 = ATZ
Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
Init3 = AT+CRM=1
ISDN = 0
Modem Type = Analog Modem
Phone = #777
Username = internet
Password = internet
stupid mode =1
4. run wvdial
--> Initializing modem.
--> Sending: ATZ
ATZ
OK
--> Sending: ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
OK
--> Sending: AT+CRM=1
AT+CRM=1
OK
--> Modem initialized.
--> Sending: ATDT#777
--> Waiting for carrier.
ATDT#777
CONNECT
--> Carrier detected.  Starting PPP immediately.
--> Starting pppd at Thu Sep 27 10:54:22 2007
--> pid of pppd: 8529
--> Using interface ppp0
--> pppd: dem Type
--> pppd: dem Type

5. Then nothing happens. The connection does not show up in /sbin/ifconfig
output and can not browse the net.

6. I tried using Network Manager in Yast. The settings are same as above.
When activated from KNetworkManager, the connection is shown in
/sbin/ifconfig but sill no luck communicating to internet.

7. Normally I connect to the net through BSNL broadband connected to our LAN
with Default Gateway set to 192.168.1.1. I tried disabling Default Gateway
setup to get PPP connection working without success.

Any help, please?

Which means you _should_ see an interface ppp0 in "/sbin/ifconfig -a" output.

Also check if DNS nameservers are updated in /etc/resolv.conf, or use

  nameserver 208.67.222.222
  nameserver 208.67.220.220

Ok, you have a connection. DNS is not updated. Update DNS as mentioned above.

Sorry, forgot to mention this. I am not even able to ping an external IP.
When connected using KNetworkManager, I get the following output for PPPD0.
======

=========
Not able to ping even 192.168.99.99

I already tried with a set of DNS servers for Tata Indicom in the
configuration (nameserver 203.197.12.30, nameserver 202.54.1.18). Changed
the DNS entries to the OpenDNS addresses give by you, still not working.

Could this be due to my network settings for LAN? Where should I look to
change the settings for working with ppp connection?

Thanks again.

        CPAL is not, as far as I can tell on doing some research, at all
 controversial; it has been approved by the OSI, and seems to be DFSG
 free.

        You know, having to eat crow twice in one day not good.  I
 stopped reading too soon; it turns out kamal was correct. CPAL is not
 DFSG free, and so the license is indeed controversial.


        Unfortunately, this means I am back to claiming that CPAL is not
 free -- where my definition of free is the DFSG.

        I had better shut up now qnd get some sleep.

No success so far. How to add a route to device modem? What should be the
Gateway? Should I get the Gateway address from TataIndicom?

Thanks.

Normally PPP will give the gateway IP. Anyway check with ISP, 

In the mean time, just try this,

If ppp0 interface is up then

1. Remove all route added by the ppp0
2. Add route entry for 192.168.99.0/24 dev ppp0
3. Add gateway as 192.168.99.1
4. Try to reach the gateway.

Bye :)

Thanks. I will try to get the information. Every time I call, to get past
"Click on Start -> Go To Control Panel" takes a few minutes :-)

If ppp0 interface is up then
>
> 1. Remove all route added by the ppp0


route del 192.168.99.99
route del -net 0.0.0.0

now modem0 does not have any entry in route

2. Add route entry for 192.168.99.0/24 dev ppp0


route add -net 192.168.99.0/24 modem0

3. Add gateway as 192.168.99.1

route add default gw 192.168.99.1 modem0

Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use

Hi,

If root user is able to play then the user you logged in might not be in the

        The troubling section are below. The discussion is still ongoing,
 but see http://bugs.debian.org/442032, and also
 http://people.debian.org/~terpstra/thread/20070915.072858.45ca5480.en.html#i20070915.072858.45ca5480

        The comments below might not apply t projity/openproj -- they
 are addressing what I find troubling about the license.
,----
|  14. ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION
|  (a) As  a modest attribution to  the organizer of  the development of
|      the  Original Code ("Original  Developer"), in the hope  that its
|      promotional  value may  help justify the  time, money  and effort
|      invested in writing the Original Code, the Original Developer may
|      include  in Exhibit  B ("Attribution Information")  a requirement
|      that each time an Executable  and Source Code or a Larger Work is
|      launched or initially  run (which includes initiating a session),
|       a  prominent display  of  the  Original Developer's  Attribution
|      Information  (as defined  below) must occur  on the  graphic user
|      interface  employed by the end  user to access  such Covered Code
|      (which may include display on a splash screen), if any.
`----
,----
|  The size of the graphic image should be consistent with the size of the
|  other elements of the Attribution Information. If the access by the end
|  user to the  Executable and Source Code does not  create a graphic user
|  interface for  access to  the Covered Code,  this obligation  shall not
|  apply. If the Original Code  displays such Attribution Information in a
|  particular form  (such as  in the  form of a  splash screen,  notice at
|  login,  an  "about" display,  or  dedicated  attribution  area on  user
|  interface  screens), continued use  of such  form for  that Attribution
|  Information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice.
|  (b) Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a                
|  brief phrase, graphic image and a URL ("Attribution Information") and             
|  is subject to the Attribution Limits as defined below. [...snip!]                 
`----
,----
|  15. ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE.                                                 
|  The  term  "External  Deployment"   means  the  use,  distribution,  or
|  communication of  the Original  Code or Modifications  in any  way such
|  that the  Original Code  or Modifications may  be used by  anyone other
|  than You, whether those works  are distributed or communicated to those
|  persons or  made available  as an application  intended for use  over a
|  network. As an  express condition for the grants  of license hereunder,
|  You must treat  any External Deployment by You of  the Original Code or
|  Modifications as a distribution under  section 3.1 and make Source Code
|  available under Section 3.2.
`----

        This means, if I even use one single function of the original
 work, in an a GUI environment, which creates, say, a button to use in
 the task bar (small button, think of the wm* packages -- wmweather et
 al), I either make the button hugish, or I have to code in a splash
 screen -- for every single button that uses any of the original
 source. So, if a user has a dozen or so of these buttons in their
 toolbar, they are faced with a dozen splash screens when they start
 their session.

        This seems enough of a reduction of freedom that this is
 unlikely to pass DFSG scrutiny.

I had to follow few steps.

1. Downloaded the upgraded alsa driver. alsa-1.0.14
2. Installed it from source
3. Reconfig the alsa driver with alsaconf
4. depmod -a
5.  modprobe snd_hda_intel
6. restarted the computer.

Thats all!!!

Bharathi, why don't we have a page in our wiki where people can add
their points. It will be easy for you to have them at one place and
easy for people to write their comments and look at what others feel.
You can also give it as a reference to  Mr.Umashankar :)

Hi,

First, do not post your query as an reply to Digest mode, Please read
list guidelines. Hence I marked it "Hijacked".

>From my little knowledge about what VB.Net is used for (Thanks to
FOSS, I had no clue other than guess with the word VB in it and esp to
WikiPedia), think you are looking for a development platform/toolkit
to develop GUI applications which can work with a Database backend ?

If so, being a KDE guy, will suggest you to have a look at Qt toolkit.
You can download Qt from http://trolltech.com/products/qt and have a
look at it. It has excellent documentation and community support such
that you will be able to learn the basics quickly (provided you have
the interest to keep working on it). The main Qt toolkit is
accompanied with

1. Qt Designer which is much like a VB environment where you can
pick-n-drop GUI objects and create signals-and-slots for them, as well
as
2. Qt Assistant which serves as a easy-to-browse documentation with an
excellent set of tutorials for you to practice, additional code cooks
to learn a bit real-time apps and finally excellent reference to the
Qt toolkit.

You can also have a look at Glade for Gtk based GUi development.

HTH :)

(If you are asking me whether you can develop VB apps using an FOSS
tool, my little world knowledge says NO!)

if you want user-friendly, point and click programming to do a  
project without really understanding what you are doing, VB.net is  
the best. There is nothing in the linux world like that. VB.net is  
meant for clueless morons mass producing third rate software without  
knowing what they are doing - and without caring about the final  
product.

If on the other hand you want to write standards compliant software,  
to understand what you are doing, to develop your skills in an all  
round way, come to the Free Software world. Choose a scripting  
language like python, learn the ins and outs - and then, use the GUI  
tools, understanding what they do.

But, what are the ping output messages that you are getting?

It doesn't say "not working" when you ping, does it?

This does not help you build .net application on linux but helps you 
deploy .net applications
on linux boxes. I haven't tried it yet. Let us know how it goes.

interestingly enough, the first and last time I used VB was in 1995.  
Anyway, the article bears out what I said - VB output looks good -  
but sux from all other viewpoints.

Absolute BS.
I am sure half of those morons can write better applications with VB and 
.NET than you can do with Python and Django.
Having seen some of your works, I know an average VB.Net guy can beat 
you hands down.

Needless and totally pointless arguments such as this should be avoided.
Also, why is that you think it is ok to attack Kg personally? If you had a

If 99.1 is the ppp i/f ip then the steps given by me is totally wrong.  
I thought, 99.1 is the gateway ip.

By looking for a VB.NET option on Linux, I presume that your primary
motivation is to get to use a tool which is very simple to pick up on.

There is a VB clone called Gambas:
http://gambas.sourceforge.net/

Lazarus is a Delphi clone.
http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/

If you insist on using a .NET type of tool, then look at developing on the
Mono framework.
http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page

One good option is to also consider Java as a development platform. Use
Netbeans 6 and the Matisse GUI Builder and you can create neat user
interfaces quite easily and also be able to run it on multiple platforms.
(Personally, this would be my choice)

Alternatively, you can look at PyGTK.

Other options include WxWidgets.

Please keep your personal attacks offline to the list please. Though
we welcome sound counter arguments, we do not want a personal attack
to take place, especially when one had not be personally attacked by

I waste a good part of my time trying to tweak sites to behave with  
IE or windows - for this site, I decided not to bother - a great  
weight off my mind. It will interest you to know that firefox with  
ogg plugin on mac also crashes. The only OS it works with is linux!

I am actually quite amazed that you don't. From your last comment asking
for feedback, it appears that you are even sincere about it, which is even
more amazing!

But I know that won't be the attitude of most people. I have seen that in
many discussion lists (especially in India) that discussions can get down
and dirty.. even to the personal level very quickly and the real issues
which were being discussed is forgotten and personalities are attacked.
Would like to see some of that avoided on this list.

A VB.NET equivalent for FOSS is actually a very interesting topic, but
that is  now forgotten with all the insults flying around. Thats pretty
sad.

PK

feedback is the most valuable thing a programmer can get. In India,  
to be polite, even if one thinks a site or code sucks bigtime, one  
makes some non-committal remark. Which is of no good to anybody. I  
much prefer if people ruthlessly dissect my work - that way I can  
improve it. And if they feel that they should attack me personally  
while doing it, no problem, as long as their criticisms are honest.  
For example, I have been very ruthless in criticising certain bad  
Tamil translations - and have been hauled up for 'discouraging'  
translations. Yes, shoddy, careless translations *should* be  
discouraged because in the end, they wind up misinforming and  
misleading people who dont know english. If the person takes it  
personally, that just shows lack of professionalism.

this list is very sane in that very few personal clashes take place.  
But one reason why Indians contribute more when they leave India is  
that they escape from this feudal atmosphere of being afraid to  
criticise and being more afraid of criticism.

it will come up again, but if you read the original post, the OP was  
looking for something easy to do - if you want easy, you will never  
amount to anything - especially in the FOSS world.

If you have criticised such translations using some upstream tools
(assuming these are related to a distribution and not to any document),
can you pass the links to me either on or off list ? Or, if you have a
list handy, passing them should be of immense help.

It is always best to collate feedback and strive to improve the
translations.

I did not say VB.net developers are morons. I said that VB.net is  
meant for morons. The whole philosophy of microsoft is to develop  
tools and applications that 'any fool can use to program'. The idea  
is to anticipate everything and provide a button for it. This results  
in less and less use of initiative and intelligence and more and more  
learning what the manual says. I know large numbers of intelligent  
and creative people are forced by circumstances to use vb.net - but I  
feel that this stifles them and does not help in developing their  
skills.

Message-ID: <3935b63b0709281234s3c415295y1c8843466181135b@mail.gmail.com>

 Greetings,

I'm writing a app that relies considerebly on C, cron jobs, and PHP.
I'm doing the logic/processing on the server in C, and the interface
/website to users is in PHP .

I need to maintain some CUSTOM properties that will be my app
configuration or meta data . I have an option to read/write these
properties in either c/shell or PHP. Hence the queries cited below in
[2 chunks] of thought...

[1] how can i set my own custom env variable ( available via php or
the shell ) ?

-SO rather than relying on storing in a flat file or in a sql table. i
was wondering how reliable/practical is to read/write these metadata
in a environmental variable.

on the PHP side can i add my own variables to PHP's $_SERVER and then
use getenv("property") or ini_set

on the os level, i'd want something like the $PATH variable. can't i
have my own customPATH or customBlah variables. i hear that
environment variables depend on their parent process ,and the reason
$PATH is accessable is because it's in the startup process.

then i read that u could try .rc files . it seems through .rc i can
execute scripts, but only on startup. but i want to be able to
read/write/store without depending on a startup. ( eg i found that use
.rc : gtk's rc files
http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/sec-ExampleRcFile.html , as well
as one at http://wiki.tcl.tk/13565) .

I'm still hoping that i don't have to rely on accessing some db or a flat file .
Is 'nt there a simple way to read/write/store custom env variables :
(a) without flat files , without sql , perhaps editing some magic lin
on apache's conf or php's ini (b) and that are persistent across
process's without depending on being called at startup

[2] so if not env variables , how do you usually manage your app
specific meta data/ configuration that can be accessable via the
shell/ php across process's ?

I think you should distinguish between a personal attack and a  
legitimate criticism. He has not attacked me personaly. He has  
questioned my credentials to make pronouncements of web programming,  
and his question is based on a review of my status/capabilities as  
web programmer. If I told Tendulkar that he doesnt know how to bat,  
he is quite legitimate in asking me how many runs I have scored in  
test cricket.

The question is: what comprises a good website? If good means more  
flash, more popups, more scrolling, more sexy widgets, more fancy  
menus - then the average VB.net guy would beat me hands down. But if  
it means standards compliance, that is another thing.

It is well known that there are two standards in the world - one,  
standards set by bodies like w3c and accepted world wide and, two,  
standards set by microsoft and forced down the throats of users world  
wide. Any non-VB programmer knows that website design is done in two  
phases - first phase is to build a standards compliant site, second  
phase is to tweak the site to work with IE without breaking the  
standards too much.

My contention is, apart from all it's other defects, VB.net is biased  
to produce code that complies only with microsoft's standards and the  
average VB.net programmer is totally unaware that such things as  
standards exist and as such, incapable of producing a good website.

My code is available - I dont say it is fully standards compliant,  
but I am getting there. As mentioned before, I welcome criticisms of it.

Which means 192.168.99.1 is not your gateway.
If you do whatever you did to get so far and just change the gateway to the 
right ip. It should work

        Sorry, that is indeed classic argumentum ad hominem.  Your
 credentials do not matter a whit if what you are saying is correct; he
 should attack the argument not the (credentials of) the man.

        In any case, the argument that only a seasoned practitioner
 can ever critique anything is in itself flawed: most movie critics are
 not held to the standard of having produced movies of equal or better
 quality.  The same goes for art critics, book reviewers ...

I am not sure I understand your requirment.
But if what I have understood is right . 
A message queing system can help you.
And you will need a system that will get the settings from the queue and then 
provide access to them in any order for all your application when requested.
I presume you want to avoid database and flat file for efficiency and want 
those values directly in memory.
About using environment variables to share across platforms , I haven tried 
before.

Please see libelektra and Gconf.

http://www.libelektra.org/Bindings

This problem is a bit thorny in your case because you have a web
application and a standard application/library needing to access the same
configuration parameters.

The problem is that neither Elektra nor Gconf have PHP bindings.
But there is apparently a python binding available for Elekra and Gconf.

MaSiva put me in touch with JayaTV Personal. We discussed for nearly
30 mins, but finally I am unable to give him a satisfiable topic
name in Tamil :( for the show, which should be understandable by
non-tech people(?!).

I *hope*, we can?t make this show on Oct 5th. Anyway plz give your
suggections(only in tamil), we can use that in future...

Some of the topics suggested by me...

1) &#32;&#2970;&#3009;&#2980;&#2984;&#3021;&#2980;&#3007;&#2992;

Almost in all the tutorials, screen / web casts that I've been through 
in my two years of being a ".net guy" (I prefer C#),
I've never seen any of those tutorial guys clicking or dragging and 
dropping something.
Good  programmers seem to favor typing. Be it on Windows or Gnu/Linux.

I urge people to refrain from talking things that they aren't aware of.

Mentioning 'Kanimozhi' in positive terms on Jaya TV can lead to the producer
losing his/her job ;-)

tamil)?

aha - you are a C# guy, you like writing programs rather than point  
and click? Then why are you fighting with me? we are on the same  
side. The OP wanted something 'easy to use' - I told him, forget  
easy, learn the ins and outs. Learn to type and debug. As for C# -  
there is a project called dotgnu which brings C# to the opensource  
world. Please check it out. Among other attractions, one of the lead  
developers of dotgnu is our very own V Gopal, who, in my opinion, is  
India's leading Open Source hacker.
