Hello,

I will be coming to IIT Chennai to run a 3 day workshop (3 - 6 Jan) on
Drupal as part of Shaastra. This is a beginner level workshop targeting
students who have not experienced Drupal. Welcome anybody who is interested
(and eligible) to attend.

http://www.zyxware.com/articles/4612/zyxware-to-conduct-drupal-workshop-at-iit-madras-as-part-of-shaastra-2015

Also if there are Free Software people who are going to be around in the
campus over these days, I would love to meet and put faces to names. I can
be reached at 09495969446.

Thanks
Anoop

Will it include contributing to the Drupal code-base via some bug fixing
drive or writing tests etc., or installation, setup and various other
existing components of Drupal ?

Hi,

The last time when I attended, we learned how to create modules. We also
had a few skype discussions too working on a common repository in github.

Thanks,
Avinash.

Message-ID: <96472081ac4d63d50171edd9201ea509@fsftn.org>

Dear Friends,

FSFTN is happy to announce a new initiative called SWIFT(SWIFT Women In 
Free Technologies) to encourage women's participation in learning and 
contributing to Free Software Technologies.

The initiative was launched with the aim of addressing the gender gap in 
the area of free software. This is especially relevant in Tamil Nadu 
where the restrictive educational environment can be a barrier to the 
involvement and contribution of women to technological advancement with 
a social perspective

While FSFTN has conducted workshops for women in Wikipedia and 
experimented with a Rails Girls initiative before, this marks a planned 
and systematic attempt at engaging with women students and 
professionals.

The first event of the initiative was attended by Chennai-based women 
FSFTN volunteers and women participants of previous FSFTN programmes. 
The two-day event saw the participants trying their hand at Python and 
Git and resolving to meet regularly to carry forward this initiative.

In the coming days, the SWIFT initiative will also engage FSFTN 
volunteers and interested students and professionals in other districts 
in order to spread this important cause.

If you would like to work for SWIFT, please mail:  swift at fsftn.org

The photos of the event and the logo of our initiative are here:

To: "chennairb at googlegroups.com" <chennairb at googlegroups.com>


Hello friends,
Best wishes for the new year.

Lets take a moment to rewind and see what happened over the last year. The
group remained active and many interesting things happened. More people
joined, many became regulars.

Meet-ups:
-------------
We had ten meet-ups over the year, one every month, missing only January
and September. (Those two were last moment cancellations.) We have reached
a comfortable style and and pace and will be able to continue like that in
foreseeable future.

Workshops:
----------------
There were two workshops - in August and November. Both were
over-subscribed, and volunteers participated with enthusiasm. We are still
experimenting with the content/procedures/format, but looks like we'll be
able to continue doing one every alternate month.

Chat:
-------
We experimented with IRC and Slack for chat, Slack worked. The chatroom
remains active, the only limitation being - the entry is invitation based.
We've tried to work around that by setting up a form on the Chennai-ruby
website. Please join if you haven't already.

What wasn't good:
------------------------
Participation of ladies was low. It is unfair to expect healthy numbers
here since we are ourselves a relatively nascent group, and the problem is
industry wide. We did try to make it a point to always stay women and
new-comer friendly, (esp. after some unfortunate discussions last year). We
did have some pleasant surprises though - there was an all girl team from
Kerala that attended the first workshop.

Person of the year: Steve Robinson.
------------------------------------------------
The amount of effort and goodwill Steve invested in the group was
inspirational. We were almost struggling to keep the group going before he
came along. A lot of good steps - meetup.com page, Slack for chat, were his
ideas. For a long time we considered his office (Spritle Software) as our
default venue. Thanks a ton Steve, its great to have you around.

If I had written a similar email last year, the name would have been Vysakh
Sreenivasan. Vysakh gave talks when we needed them the most, especially in
the few early meet-ups - he can give Ruby introduction talks *in his
sleep!* And
his celebrity status too helped us get participants to our events and
evangelize Ruby in general.

If I was allowed to take more name, I'd add Shanth, Gorav, Vijay, Murtza,
Hari, Selva, Shrikanth, Sudarshan, Kasinathan, Ravi, Geeth and a few more.
Thanks for being supportive, and thanks for being awesome.

Next up:
-----------
There are many interesting ideas, and quite a few plans. Though its best to
let them have a separate thread each, I'll give a short glimpse.

1. Projects: We'll start a few projects on Github and collaborate on them.
The projects will be simple Rails applications where newbies can also
contribute. And we'll use the code/apps for our activities (One such
example is the workshop app[1])

2. Conference: The idea of doing a conf. has been discussed on and off many
times. Since a conference is a sizable endeavor, some scrutiny was
necessary. We have a general sort of agreement now, so it stands in need of
initiative. I think this is the year we can pull it off.


Thanks for reading. Please add anything interesting I may have missed.
Happy new year once again.
See you at the next meet-up.
Regards,
Abhishek

I think foreman should be used instead of puppet dashboard for open source.

 Pirate Praveen started a discussion in Indian Pirates:

*Statement on Indian Government censorship of the Internet
<http://www.loomio.org/d/nqX18GOa/statement-on-indian-government-censorship-of-the-internet?utm_campaign=thread_mailer&utm_medium=email&utm_source=new_discussion>*

-- Draft statement, please comment, before 9th Jan 2015 --

Recently many sites have been blocked by many Internet Service Providers
(see http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/31/indian-government-censorsht/ for more
details). We, Indian Pirates, consider this as a violation of our
fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the
constitution. We don't expect this government will listen to any of us, to
uphold basic human rights. So we are left with only technical measures to
exercise our fundamental rights.

We recommend using censorship free DNS services like opennicproject.org and
dns.watch to continue browsing the internet without interruption.

We also anticipate more powerful censorship in the coming days, so we
recommend everyone to start using tor (torproject.org).

As a long term solution, we recommend getting involved in politics and stop
expecting career politicians to stand up for our rights. Support groups and
collectives that defend democracy and fight for human rights.

Indian Pirates is a collective fighting for human rights and civil
liberties. You can join us at pirates.org.in

Yeah, dashboard is available only in puppet enterprise. Foreman is the best
alternative for Puppet GUI

I am not an SME.   Is the MySQL server (RHEL) and client (Deb Wheezy)
the same version?   It should not matter though.  Anything related to
the segfault in the log files (Deb Wheezy)?   Alternately, setup the
Deb Wheezy MySQL server and see if client can connect w/o seg
faulting.

Nope, For Redhat server they only support 5.1.73, however debian client is
up on 5.4.x...

I tried using the same mysql client version on debian however even that
resulted in the same Segmentation Fault.

I did not see probably even with the verbose flag on the client side on the
terminal.

Hi All,

I am planning to develop a IP Location Database. As we have
www.ip2location.com

Any idea how do they create the database entries like collecting
information of each and every IP's right from Region, Latitude, Longitude,
Zip Code, Country and so on.

Thank you

Hmmm.   You mean mysql client version 5.1 on Wheezy?   Seg fault could
also be caused by corrupted files and/or bad memory.  apt-get purge
<mysql client> and reinstall.

mysqld (server) also writes log files in /var/lib/mysql.   Not sure
about the client but see if you find anything in /var/lib/mysql.

Creating your own DB might be something more than what you can handle.

There are services that maintain IP/region/City/ databased with APIs
to query and use them in your app.
Most provide a light version of their service/db.

I am not sure how these services handle IP allocated to mobile devices
though.  You may only get region info in such cases.

Keyword search "geo ip location service"

Please share your experience.

This is what the stock provides and it fails over SSL connection.
Redhat (Santiago) mysql-server version is 5.1.73
Debian Wheezy mysql client version is 5.4.xxxxx

Dear All,

I am using argp ecosystem for designing command line options for a c
program.
I have a question. How do I implement arguments that take multiple values -
i mean how do I parse those multiple strings linked to that argument ? I
have not seen any examples in the official documentation
http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argp.html.

Kindly let me know.

Thanks

Can you give an example?

You might want to look at Chapter 2 from 'Advanced Linux Programming':

I'd encourage you to read the book as well.

Like for example
$ myexecutable --iter 1 --inputfiles test1.dat test2.dat test3.dat
--random 1

Here --inputfiles option should be able to take up multiple values ( in
this case *.dat). This is the problem and I am trying to implement it using
argp (as it automates some options like --usage and --help).

Note that --iter and random options takes one value each and is straight
forward to implement.

Please let me know

You can:

#1 Pass these as arguments to the program without an option.

#2 Store the input filenames in a file, and pass the file as an argument.

#3 Use --inputfile multiple times during invocation for each file. For example:

  $ myexecutable --iter 1 --inputfiles test1.dat --inputfiles
test2.dat --inputfiles test3.dat
--random 1

An option is an option, and is in the *nix principle that it does only
one job, and does it well.

Okay finally figured out what the problem was.

Redhat mysql-server or mysql-client version 5.1.73 would work with PKCS#8,
However mysql-client-5.5 on debian wheezy would not work with PKCS#8 I had
to convert them to PKCS#1 for them to work as shown in [1].

openssl rsa -in key_in_pkcs1_or_pkcs8.pem -out key_in_pkcs1.pem

Sprints are something we should definitely try!

The idea is something like this:

* Identify a bunch of FOSS projects
* File issues, send patches, etc

This will, in my opinion help us build a stronger community and at the
same time, help out with some Open source work.

The Bangalore Python User Group has tried this as well and they seemed
to have had a great[1] response to it.

Hi All,

Few months ago, I read about blog where kernel developer workstations
and their workflow were presented. I personally found it inspiring to
understand the different tools / hardware used by developers.

For instance, I came to know that Torvalds uses a walking zombie desk. :-) :-D

I am a regular desktop user and feel even I have a quite a unique
setup. Am really curious to know what fellow LUG'ians are using.
Further, collecting this details would help us gather first hand
experience of different hardware and anyone looking.

I request you to share how you have set up your workstation @ home / work.

http://i.imgur.com/zY0zXui.jpg >> Workstation snap taken with my
#Jolla phone. If it isn't great, blame the guy who clicked.

-- Mint Box II >> A powerful compact PC size of router. Recently
fitted with SSD Samsung 840 EVO 120 GB . And needless to say, my
Cinnamon desktop boots in a jiffy now. Someone told me using HDD is
sticking to Black & White TV when we have Plasma and LED TVs.

-- Samsung 24 " monitor  >> I love it, can have multiple workspaces
with various windows opne. And Cinnamon allows me to tile and snap
windows to organize my work flow needs. Snapping is my favorite Mint
Cinnamon feature. ^2

-- JBL Flip Portable Bluetooth speaker >> Quality sound. Supports A2DP
and ideal for multimedia usage. Charge stands for few hours to finish
a movie!

-- Logitech Wireless Keyboard K330 (with Mouse combo but it failed on
me due to some h/w issue, I hate tangled wires so bought below one.)
*Solaar* application helps pairing multiple devices.

-- Dell Wireless Mouse

-- Am not married and (hence?) don't have kids yet have a stuffed
Penguin shoulder bag ^4 in my room next to my desktop. Surprised? At
least folks in ILUGC shouldn't be - as we adore the Tux Mascot :-) Use
it to stuff accessories like hard disk, extra mouse, etc

It is not only in Hyderabad but it is also there is Bangalore. It is ran by
some of the Mozilla Contributors.

Vineel Reddy is one of the awesome contributor from Mozilla India. He is
one of the community builder from India. Under his leadership Mozilla has
released Firefox OS launch successfully.

Thank you

Hi all,

Collab House is a space that was started in Bangalore and Hyderabad. The one in Bangalore is now officially a Mozilla Community Space. Now, the one in Hyderabad is Collab House. Every month a number of activities take place there ranging from Fx OS app development workshops to Toastmasters meet. 
It would be really nice to have a space as such in Chennai for community activities with the increasing number of communities and useful activities. Perhaps some source of crowd funding activities could be done to raise funds for the running/maintenance of the space as well.

Looking forward to seeing some progress on this.

Cheers

Message-ID: <CAFHFDAmmMUzZLw6h1Mnd4wnCxfBZTunNt-fB7sXc3hrd8BreCg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am confused by this Lan data speed.

I have two system A and B connected with a LAN cable.  Both of them were
made in the last one year so it does not matter if it is straight through
or cross over.

When I tried to issue a ethtool eth0 I see that both machine are capable of
supporting 1000baseT/Full.  However when I try to transfer file across them
it is capable of doing it only at 4MegaBytes per second max.  I expected to
see at least over a 100 MegaBytes per second.  Where am I going wrong ?

100MegaBytes of raw speed is what you can expect. Please try with UDP,
don't read data from hard disk, also the amount of data sent per transfer
can affect the output. Use iperf (with udp) to see the real hardware
capability.

Hope this helps,

The theoretical speed would be 1000Mbps/8 to get a 125 MBytes/sec
number.  However, when both are connected to a switch or a hub,
sharing the ethernet fabric with other nodes, then there is a lot of
collision between nodes when they broadcast ethernet frames.   With a
good switch like a HP Pro Curve, the max I have got is around 45 MB/s
for 1 Gb/s NICs.

You have not mentioned if A and B are connected to each directly i.e.
not through a switch/hub.  Try connecting the 2 systems directly with
a high quality short cable and see what's the max throughput  you get.

Hello,

My name is Jaswinder and I am going to work on a project called 'analysis of WLAN hamdover (handoff) '. Can anyone suggest me which software should I use for wireless LAN. I have heard that GNS3 works well for wired networks and same is with NS3 but They don't work for wireless LAN. 

I am badly stuck in my project. I would really appreciate if you can suggest me a software for this.

Thanks:
Jaswinder Kaur

Hi All,

We had four great talks with 24 people attending the ILUGC january meet. 
Most of them were new faces.

We had good talk by Shakthi Kannan talking about Nix OS. We then had 
another good talk by Shrayas about the dot files. Then we had a talk 
about tamil wikipedia by Siva Karthikeyan we had a wide discussion 
regarding the topic. Then we had a short and sweet talk by Prasanna.

We had a discussion about the events and activities to be organized this 
year. I will send another mail in this regard. At last we moved to 
Cafeteria.

Hi All,

In this monthly meet we discussed about the events and activities that 
can be conducted this year. As discussed the things that can be done are

  * Hackathons / Sprints
  * Workshops
  * Repository for ILUGC
  * Hardware setup such as a PC with files and OS for Community
  * Install FEST - 2015
  * Mini Meetups

1. Hackathons
     In Particular with Hackathons we discussed we can have events based 
on emerging SBC's like Raspberry Pi, Beagle bone and also on other 
emerging softwares.

2. Workshops
     We discussed that a workshop on wikipedia will be conducted. 
Depending on the response we can conduct other workshops.

3. Repository for ILUGC
     A repository for ILUGC will be maintained. FOSS files, projects and 
tutorials can be shared across community.

4. Hardware setup such as a PC with files and OS for Community
     We will setup a Hardware for the community. We need Hardware setup 
and maintenance to be done by the community people.

5. Install FEST - 2015
     This event will be conducted as like last year.

6. Mini meetups
     We have to start mini meetups eventually. This mini meetup helps 
people to interact with other people and it will not be a formal 
session. Mostly we can plan to meet in a public place and we can discuss 
about the upcoming projects and activities.


*Improvements to be made*

  * We need our website to be improved. I feel that we should have the
    blog, wiki, Forums to be integrated with the site.
  * As of now we need the Projects/Listing of projects to be mentioned
    in our community.


Kindly let us know if something we missed or anything to be added.

Hi All,

In this monthly meet we discussed about the events and activities that 
can be conducted this year. As discussed the things that can be done are

  * Hackathons / Sprints
  * Workshops
  * Repository for ILUGC
  * Hardware setup such as a PC with files and OS for Community
  * Install FEST - 2015
  * Mini Meetups

1. Hackathons
     In Particular with Hackathons we discussed we can have events based 
on emerging SBC's like Raspberry Pi, Beagle bone and also on other 
emerging softwares.

2. Workshops
     We discussed that a workshop on wikipedia will be conducted. 
Depending on the response we can conduct other workshops.

3. Repository for ILUGC
     A repository for ILUGC will be maintained. FOSS files, projects and 
tutorials can be shared across community.

4. Hardware setup such as a PC with files and OS for Community
     We will setup a Hardware for the community. We need Hardware setup 
and maintenance to be done by the community people.

5. Install FEST - 2015
     This event will be conducted as like last year.

6. Mini meetups
     We have to start mini meetups eventually. This mini meetup helps 
people to interact with other people and it will not be a formal 
session. Mostly we can plan to meet in a public place and we can discuss 
about the upcoming projects and activities.


*Improvements to be made*

  * We need our website to be improved. I feel that we should have the
    blog, wiki, Forums to be integrated with the site.
  * As of now we need the Projects/Listing of projects to be mentioned
    in our community.


Kindly let us know if something we missed or anything to be added.

I could not do UDP as I was mirroring a disk,  More over data read and
write happens at more than 20MBPS, then why would it result in that low 4MB
? Any way I did that painfully across 120GB over 6 hrs of time.

UDP does not have any overhead I think (not sure though). There can be
protocal over head. In case of SSH the data has to be encrypted,
transferred over network and decrypted in the destination, this hampers
performance a lot.

Hope this helps,

Message-ID: <CADtvZWAZEw=DBvyR5PQrb-bKFUvoqc7-KwJaA20Jfs6R=EYFkA@mail.gmail.com>

Rapid7, a security data and analytics firm found a serious bug in the
WebView component of Android 4.3 and below (it's an older bit of software
that lets apps view webpages without launching a separate app) that
potentially opens up affected phones to malicious hackers. Android 4.4 and
5.0 are unaffected by the bug.

Our team is moving the Tamil text processing package for python -
open-tamil - to support Python 3 in addition to Python 2.

Pass the word around, and if you like Python, Unicode and Tamil language
processing, take a look at our github repo, docs and examples at
http://bit.ly/1iTTJ5V  However our Python 3 port is still work in progress.

Open-Tamil is available via PIP only for Python 2 currently.

?yes that showed up on top of list while searching the web. The idea of

I'd encourage you all to meet up with other local ubuntu enthusiasts and be
a part of ubuntu global jam.

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam

One of the best activities you can do of course is help out by testing.
Fortunately there's a wonderful guide on the ubuntu global jam site to help
with this:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Jams/Testing

In addition, thanks to elfy, knome, sak and others the QATeam wiki has
gotten a fresh revamp making it easier to find help and get you started
with testing. For more information on holding a testing event, check out
UbuntuGlobalJam wiki, and don't forget you can request a jam pack of free
stuff to help your event!

http://mhall119.com/2015/01/ubuntu-loco-team-global-jam-packs/

Happy jamming and testing everyone!

Nicholas

Thankfully, ships to India.

One welcome movie is adopting community suggested open source file
system instead of industry standard proprietary solution for externarl

Hi All,

I feel that we can have INSTALLFEST scheduled on this day. But we need 
the make the arrangements made for this day. Please give your 
suggestions for conducting Install fest

  * We can have some stall kind of arrangement of our people explaining
    about Distros with their unique flavours.
  * We have to check whether we can conduct in our regular venue(IIT) or
    other place as people should feel easy to come to venue.
  * We should have volunteer names in online with the details of their
    name, area, Email and contact number.

It will be good for the participants to do some homework on which
distribution they want installed prior to the installfest. Or, if
there is a distro that is available and they would like to try it out
at the venue, they can do so.

There should be less talking and more hands-on work.

Why is this useful?

What will be useful is to identify the distributions that people would
like to try on their hardware on the day of the event, and we ensure
that DVDs/CDs/USB thumb drives are made available.

We could start a bit early, around 1300 IST and start with
installation and configuration. People can go home and play with the
systems and customize it to their needs, or ask this mailing list or
other forums for support.

The objective is to help bootstrap systems with a distribution. But,
people are welcome to play with their existing systems and
configuration.

My only concern with this is that it probably is too late to announce
this? I assume that the regulars to the LUG will already have a distro
running. Isn't an INSTALLFEST intended for an audience that isn't
majorly from the LUG?

How is the above related to the original subject?

If you do not have the time to compose a new message with a relevant
subject line, how do you expect others to devote their time to give
you suggestions?

Please follow list guide lines and do not "hijack" other discussions
with your queries.

Why do you think so? The only concern is obtaining permission.

\--

Not necessarily true. People may want to try a different setup on
their distribution, or may want to try out something new, or just come
to learn.

We are just a week away from the event, Maybe it isn't enough time to

If they already have 1 distro isn't it safe to assume that they can
install another one? Not trying to be negative here, just asking.

We should neither be interested in numbers nor expect a perfect event.
The objective is for people to meet, do hands-on work, and learn from
each other.

Whoever is interested is welcome to join in, and we can always have
more installfests, if needed in future.

The important thing, IMO, is to take the first step.

They are called "virtual machines".

Totally agree. What I meant is that if we plan this with 1 month gap
and announce it early enough, we'll have (i hope) a larger turnout. I
understand how these things work and don't expect a perfect event or
the like. It is all about a bunch of like minded people sharing ideas
and thought.

> They are called "virtual machines".

I might have miscommunicated. What I meant is that people who already
have installed 1 distro can pretty easily install another one. I
believe it should be more about getting other people to get started
with GNU/linux.

Though if the decision is to have an install fest, I am not against
it, just thinking out loud.

Traditionally, yes. But, since we do have people with different
experiences and needs, it will be good to keep the options open.

Cheers,

Hi

Which one would you recommend for playing youtube videos seamlessly ?

I see a lot of buzz around omxplayerGUI.  Is that what I should be going in
for ?
