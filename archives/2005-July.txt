To this, I'd like to add that you can use procmail to separate out
your mail into different folders automatically (like applying
labels). Procmail also adds a lot of value. I use it to separate mail
from various lists, remove the unsubscribe details appended to the end
of list messages and get rid of the Yahoo! ads which are appended to
messages sent by Y! users.

Then, use mutt to read the nicely separated messages.

Hi,

Infact Xine & Mplayer other multimedia appliactions
 are not working properly on FC4
which worked on FC3(I downloaded rpms for FC4)

Set the user-agent string in your browser to IE, I think there is some
extension for firefox which does that, or its probably possible in
about:config. In opera, goto Tools->Quick Preferences->Identify as
Internet Explorer. The site works just fine with Opera.

But I dont know you are supposed to what the total download is... weird..

My thoughts on CDs for distribution

1.Ubuntu may not be right choice, because it is not as popular as
fedora/mandrake/debian. So availability of local help might be a
problem.

2.It is not the number of CDs we can distribute, that matters.
 What matters is how many people we can teach?

3.To be effective we should have some way of helping them over next
two or three months. Otherwise we will be like politicians visiting
only during election time and distributing some dole.

4.We need volunteers in flesh and blood for teaching. In my
experience I found, since CDs are dead cheap, the users don't mind
making copies on their own.

5.Why so many people order for Ubuntu CDs which are shipped at cost,
and thus bleeding the project of its money, knowing well they don't
need that many numbers? 

6.In the last seminar in Dept.of Legal Studies at MU, over 50 cd sets
were distributed. I feel not one would been used for installing. I
request Ramanraj to comment on this, if he has any contrary
information.

If you are compiling from source code several programs would require 
code fixes to work with GCC 4. However RPMS from 
http://rpm.livna.org/fedora/4/ should work fine.

As root user,

rpm -ivh 
http://rpm.livna.org/fedora/4/i386/RPMS.lvn/livna-release-4-0.lvn.2.4.noarch.rpm

yum install totem-xine mplayer

hi,
In linux it works with Opera without any problem. Firefox it logs in
after tampering with user agent, but other links inside are not
working, so it is of no use. So u cannot see the usage.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT]: some problem with creating user with mysql
Message-ID: <e0900f3e050701031763b50da@mail.gmail.com>

I have some problem in configuring mysql.
I want to import a database to mysql.
Those databases are in XML and to convert them to sql and integrate, I have 
a software (BioWareHouse).
That software requires the username with its password and the database name 
to which the sql files should be imported as arguments.
So i created a new user with a password and gave full previleges for that 
user to that database.
Then, when i attempt to login that user with password in the command line 
with the following command:

[rajagopal@ramak3 ~]$ mysql -u biowareuser -p bioware
Enter password:
ERROR 1045: Access denied for user: 'biowareuser@localhost' (Using password: 
YES)

the above eror results.
When I login the user without a password, it gets logged in

[rajagopal@ramak3 ~]$ mysql -u biowareuser
Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 4 to server version: 3.23.58

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql>


then i tried to load the database to which i have given full access for that 
user:

mysql> use Warehouse
ERROR 1044: Access denied for user: '@localhost' to database 'Warehouse'

Then I tried to load the same database logging in as root so that i'll have 
full access. 

mysql> use Warehouse
Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

Database changed
mysql>

The two thing that I dont understand are:
1) Why doesnt that user biowareuser login when i use the password option? 
(but logs in without a password! I've created that user with a pasword 
only.)
2) Why doesn't that database get loaded for the user 'biowareuser' though i 
hav granted full previlege to him, using the grant command (the grant 
command was successful. but still shows some access denied when trying to 
load the database.)

A 'Gyan' that I got from elsewhere: Its not a good thing to change the
user  agent  because you  end  up  providing  false statistics  (false
positives for IE) and the company that is running the site might think
that firefox  needs no  support and it  will be the  firefox community
that will suffer at large in the long run.

Holy cow. I never thought I'll see ESR talking rationally. So the hell 
does freeze over, sometimes. Coming to point, I was never too 
comfortable about the 'viral' aspect of GPL. Yes, you let others play 
with your code. It's your privilege. But is it really ethical to force 
them to do the same? Just because they want to use the code you already 
gave away, should you bind them into giving their IP away? I don't think 
so.

Popular or not, BSD-style licencing is the true open-source, me thinks. 
Let the flames begin.

What do these queries:

select * from user where User = 'biowareuser';
select * from db where User = 'biowareuser';

give out, when run as root?

I think the author of the code has the right to decide what his code
came be turned into, so when he is releasing it for free, he can surely
impose that other who take his work should also help for development of
open source,
But as ESR says, if removing such an imposition helps in development of
opensource,,, then its good doing like that ,
As the sole ideology of open source is to promote its concept.
But not hanging over patenting laws....

It seems you have not set the password for biowareuser. 

mysql> grant all privileges on  *.* to 'biowareuser'@'localhost'
identified by 'bioware';

The above command would grant all privileges to that user when he logs
in from localhost. It would set his passoword as well. For further
details please refer mysql documentation.

Well., I think the Free Software movement would not have survived this
long had it not been for the copy-left. Ditching it now is not a good
idea. A person who is really concerned about his user's freedom., wont
hesitate to publish his source code out no matter where he derived it
from. Only people who have ideas of lifting community work for personal
gain would be threatened by the GPL. Now., these people obviously need
to be threatened and forced., coz thats the healthy way towards the
community.

I know that there are people bound by NDAs and other nonsense like that.
Those people should NOT use GPLed code in their projects. That ways.,
their respective companies will realize the loss they make by not using
available code and decide to give their source out as Free Software.
That should be the line of attack., not the other way around. 

This is the difference in the perspective of the Free-Software
movement., and the Open-Source movement. Free Software movement is
centered on the `Freedom` of the individual user., and making sure that
that freedom lasts. The Open-Source guys have different ideas. All they
are bothered about is `convenience` and `productivity`. These are merely
the side-effects of Free-Software. Too much concentration on them will
definitely side-track the whole movement. The Open-Source movement is
considered successful based on how many companies `use Open-Sourced
software` and how many companies support it. Have all those companies
given up the proprietary model completely?? No.. The Free-Software
movement wants all software to be Free (as in freedom). 

And., `Linus` did not `invent/discover/*` the distributed development
model. It has been around and used for quite a long time in the GNU
project.. way before even Linux came out (gcc, emacs, ..). 

And ESR., well.. I reserve my comments on him for some other post :)

Any ideas what makes those people nervous and who they

In an imperfect world, GPL is just perfect. And you
also have LGPL as an alternative.

When one uses free software and builds on that, he/she
spends useful man hours in creating extensible or more
productive software. These ideas, if released, will in
turn help generate more ideas amongst fellow
programmers. When a group of people continue to work
like this, it gives an ambience where people have the
freedom, and liberty to think differently. Everyone is
not alike. So, when you share ideas, you explore
different areas of the problem space for obtaining
multiple solutions to a given problem. Instead, if you
work on a free software and you provide an
extension/new feature and _not_ release it:

1. you will not get the useful man-hour testing from
the programmers of the community.

2. you will not know if there are better solutions or
methods in solving the problem.

3. you may have bugs that you or your team may never
know.

> As the sole ideology of open source is to promote

Unless there is collaboration, interactivity, and
freedom in exchanging ideas, there is no scope for
development or progress.

Just my thoughts,

I couldn't agree more. The BSD licenses and public domain in general has 
been around longer, but its the GPL that catalyzed the free-software / 
open source movement.

It makes sense .. if you're going to put effort into making something and 
give it away for free because you believe in certain principles, the 
last thing you want is some money-grabbing cheapskate to take it, convert 
it to a commercial product and then lock everybody else out of the source.

If you see the indignation that the developers of mplayer and pear pc 
felt when their code got lifted and used by unscrupulous companies, 
you'll realize its very unlikely that too many of them would've put in the 
effort in the first place without the protection of the GPL.

Nobody's being forced to use GPL'ed code. And if you're using code that's 
freely been given to you by someone else, there's nothing "unethical" 
about being expected to make your final product available under the same 
license. The only people who would object are people who want to use 
GPL'ed code to cut short their developmental cycle, and profit.

Free software authors write free software because they believe that 
end users should have certain rights - if you don't believe that, you 
shouldn't use free software sources in your program. If you think you 
deserve to be paid for your efforts, you should actually go and put in 
that effort and write code from scratch.

And I call BS on the funda that doing away with the GPL will help the open 
source movement get close to corporations. The open-source community 
doesn't benefit when companies start using GPL'ed software, they benefit 
when they start contributing back. Do you think IBM would contribute its 
changes back to the community if it were not for the GPL ? Even if it had 
altruistic managers who wanted to give back code out of the goodness of 
their heart, they would be innundated with shareholder lawsuits for 
letting go of a profit opportunity without good reason, and for giving 
away IP that could, in the absence of the protection of the GPL, be used 
by its own competitors.

> And ESR., well.. I reserve my comments on him for some other post :)

Heh. There's nothing new about ESR's opposition to the GPL. He's been bad 
mouthing Stallman and the GPL for a long time now. And it takes only a 
moment to compare their statures and the projects they've been involved in 
to decide whom to take seriously.

Face it people, its because of that long haired bearded geek that free 
software is what it is today. You may laugh every time he says GNU/Linux 
instead of just linux, but if it weren't for him, there'd be no free 
software community of significance today to discuss whether it needed the 
GPL or not.

Subject: [Ilugc] cisco vpn client on dataone
Message-ID: <4dc6c90405070108595d6d057b@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to use cisco vpn client on top of bsnl dataone. I am
facing a problem with the modem provided by bsnl. The modem i am using
is ut-300r2 adsl modem. The modem is configured as a gateway. The
pppoe userid/password is configured in the modem. The NAT/Firewall is
running in the modem. When, i try to run vpn client in my machine, it
reports

[bhuvan@bluestar vpnclient]$ ./vpnclient connect collab
Cisco Systems VPN Client Version 4.6.02 (0030)

[bhuvan@bluestar vpnclient]$

I have tried it on debian sid (2.6.11) and rh9.0 (2.4.20). The result is same.

When i debugged further, i found that since firewall is running in the
modem (it seems), it is preventing my client from establishing the
connection. ie.. it rejects udp 500. Due to this, i am unable to
establish the connection. I have disabled the firewall in the modem,
saved and restarted the modem, but still i am unable to run my vpn
client.

Anybody using bsnl broadband and cisco vpn to connect to a private network ?
Can you figure out whats going wrong here ?

The problem is not with cisco vpn client. I have referred cisco vpn
client documentation.
http://www.mcmaster.ca/cis/network/software/linuxguide.pdf . I have
adopted the steps described in the document. So, i am almost certain
that the problem is not with the vpn client.

Thankx.

The BSDL has a different background.
People who were (and who still are)working on BSDL Code were mostly from
the academia(MIT,UCB) and since these bodies are public "owned", it was
decided that whatever "product" comes out of these institutions should
also remain in the public domain.

The BSDL is not an alternative to the GPL.
FLOSS needs the GPL and there can be no compromise made on that.

Take Mac OS X for example, its built off the FreeBSD core.
Can you compare a Mac with FreeBSD as a desktop platform ?

Now under the same scenario, imagine Linux under the BSDL and see how
many Mac OS clones will come out from of RH,Novell,IBM.

What ESR thinks is not important,IMNSHO.

Hi Prashanth and others.
  I want to install gaim in my debian sarge. I have the first three
CDs of sarge which does not have many dependencies that are required
for gaim installation.  to name the required files... libgnutls11-dev
(>= 1.0.16-5), tcl8.4-dev, tk8.4-dev and some more. So i need those
CDs that have these packages. I would be happy if some one has debian
CDs that have gnome development packages.. which will have the above
required files.
Please let me know if some of u have these CDs.

btw.. Prashanth how do use gaim in debian ?

just do "apt-get install gaim" . The gaim package is there in the 3 cds 
i gave u (i dont remember which cd exactly). If u havent done so already 
add your cdrom to the apt-get sources.list file using the apt-cdrom command.

a mac is quite nice. and a freebsd with gnome 2.10 is also quite nice
but the rest of it - other than the really cool GUI - is pretty much a

I have a question. People here would agree that the advent of Linux
has revolutionized the whole computer industry, including the server
and supercomputer fields.

Now, Linux and *BSD started at around the same time. Why isn't it that
FreeBSD isn't as famous or popular as Linux his?

Now, I hear you say that popularity of *BSD and the license are
different. Well, if you are not going to gauge the usefulness of a
free software license with its flagship product, what would be its
yardstick?

If you say "FreeBSD deployment isn't low because of the license, it's
because of other problems like ..." it is precisely these problems
that led to NetBSD and, sunsequuently, OpenBSD. However, none of the
BSD's are as popular.

I am not a hacker, but I sure feel that the reason Linux emerged as
the most successful among these is because the GPL model ensured the
fast development of the kernel.

And, on the part "the belief that open source software is weak and
needs to be protected", I'd say any software is weak, and it's upto
the author to decide what protection is needed. The BSD license gives
little protection, and people who use it need not return anything. But
the protection provided by the GPL ensures that everyone is
benefitted. This isn't, in my view, too high a price for free
software.

Finally, ESR talks as though the GPL is the very reason why the
corporate has not accepted free software (or open-source). So, does it
mean that *BSD's have been embraced by the corporate world with open
arms and Linux is losing heavily because of the GPL? I don't think so.

Afterthought: I did have a lot of respect for ESR, but gradually, I
seem to be losing it, with good reason.

Really cool gui's aside,
what's more important for a desktop user is the "it-just-works"
experience.Sadly, *BSD do not gaurantee this for a desktop user when
compared to Mac OS X.

What I meant in the first place was that modifications done by a third
party to a OSS product will *never* be available to the community if the
project is licensed under the BSDL.

*BSD during its most crucial stage got bogged down by the BSD-I Vs AT&T
lawsuit which ensured that *almost no* commercial firm  showed interest
in the usage of BSD.This was around 1991-92.

By the time the lawsuit was settled and they managed to get 4.4 BSD
out(1994), linux had already established itself as the choice of the
hacker-hobbyist.The rest, is history..

this is bad practice.

you should do this

select count(1) from table3; and check for count. if it matches yours,
then there are that many records. other wise if u really like to see
the records use limit.

Then they should consider GPL and not BSDL, because BSDL allows
free source code to go into proprietary s/w.

That number is the DNS record's TTL - time to live - in seconds. As
time advances, the TTL goes down.

Once it goes down to zero, the DNS cache is supposed to query the
authorized server again for the record.

The BSDL was first adopted in ~1982.
There was no GPL(or it was in a very nascent stage) at that time.

BSDL is more akin to "public domain", a term which the common man
understood in the 1980's.

They(*BSD) have been following the BSDL for 23 years now and it has held
up against all odds, so there is no requirement to shift to the GPL.
It's the same with Linux, we have used the GPL for ~15 years now and
there is no need for a shift.Of course, the usage of the GPL as a
defense mechanism for Free/Open Source Software has decreased but it
will always remain as a deterrent for the developers.

ESR seems to be talk only about people who have been deterred by the
viral condition. But there might be developers who have opted to make
their src open because they needed to use GPL'd pieces in their
code...fine, agreed that they might not have done it wholeheartedly,
but still...it does leverage foss...after all, not everyone involved,
(like many companies), support foss for the sake of RMS...there are
financial motives as well, but I guess it is more of a symbiosis...

Vamsee, Arvind: I really don't know what a definition of Open Source
would be. I support the objectives as stated by RMS. I guess all this
movement is to give freedom to users, more than to developers. While a
BSD'ish licence will give the developer a choice between whether to
disclose his source or not, the user's rights to modify and use the
program the way he/she likes are not preserved. It takes a GPL to do
this. On a stronger note, how on earth is it ethical for a developer
to claim IP over code whose sizeable portion is not his/her own, and
is available freely. The baseline is, FOSS has revolved around 'You
take something from the community, you give back your best to the
same'. If you are selfish enough to think that you can siphon off
resources, never to give anything back to the community, this isn't
the place for you. IMHO, it really isn't an argument of whether FOSS
needs to be protected or otherwise. Even if the world, as we hope, has
only free software, I would still like GPL to be there around.

As a parting note, regarding what 'Open Source' really means, RMS in
the recent IIT talk said that he supports free software, not open
source. Anyone has ideas on what he really meant ?

it moves on...

I beg to differ. I think the main reason why it survived is because
people love to share and show off their work. It's also because when you
use somebody else's work, if you improve on it, you feel like giving it
back. Saying "hey, thank you, I learnt something, but this is better".
Of course, there are some people who like to steal & hoard. But copycats
never go too far. If a company has to steal code to compete in the
market place, I have serious doubts about its future.

So who'll pay the bills? Free Software has it's place. As does
open-source software. That doesn't mean proprietary software is bad (I 
know this view is not shared by free software people). A
company invests in people, resources and time in a product for a reason.
It's only fair that they should enjoy its fruits. You should not forget
that they also create jobs & prosperity. Can you deny the fact that the
legitimacy created by companies like IBM, Red Hat & HP creates jobs for
linux hackers? You're essentially being paid to do the thing you love to
do. Yes, we all love free software. Don't you love the sexiest laptop
available too? Who will pay for that?

Vamsee.

That improvments may belong to the author, but the program as a whole 
contains the IP of the original author, without which the improvements 
would mean nothing.

If the guy feels his improvements are significant and that the original 
program is not, he should rewrite the whole thing from scratch and do what 
he wishes with it.

Well, I think the people at Cygnus and Red Hat get to buy nice laptops 
too. Besides, Free Software is not about giving away software for free. 
Its about giving away source, whenever you give away the executable, no 
matter how much you charge for it.

I think the examples you quoted shows that free software can be 
profitable. IBM, Red Hat & HP are paying linux hackers to write code that 
are distributed under the terms of the GPL. Why ? Because, they need that 
code now for their platforms. They realize that it'd be wasteful to 
reinvent the wheel and that giving away the source of their improvements 
is a small price to pay for the benefit of using an existing code base.

They benefit despite giving away their improvements, because they're 
saving on time and money that they would need to invest to write an 
operating system from scratch.

So the GPL helps the company in the sense that it no longer needs to 
invest too much in people, resources and time. Companies (and activists) 
who support removing the "viral" nature of the GPL want the companies to 
have their cake and eat it too ie. benefit from lower investments because 
of the presence of GPL'ed code, and yet profit as much as before.

Give appropriate credits where it is due. Doesn't that solve the 
problem ? I understand, its easier said than done. And that's one
reason why open/free source  developers are so keen on the 
licenses they choose, lest others use their code in a manner they
don't approve of.

It is not necessary that success of a package/program be attributed 
to a single person/group. Packages evolve over time, mostly with
contributions from varied sources. Mark people's contribution,
give due recognition in source code through copyright notes. You
might distribute your s/w with improvements in form of patches 
( .. does makes life difficult though ..)

It is not unnatural for packages to embody IPs belonging to different
people.

Also, the original author should not feel that he is doing a favor on 
the person who builds upon his s/w. That's a kind of feeling that
proprietary s/w makers incubate.

You can not earn your bread and butter by just writing code
and giving it away under GPL. You need to build a support/
maintenance mechanism around your product to make users pay 
you for reliable support.

You might attach a price tag with with your GPLed product but one
customer and the second clause of GPL is enough to make sure
that you are paid only once. Correct me if i am wrong.

Yes you can, if you're writing it for a company that needs quality 
software on its platform fast. You can earn money writing a verilog 
synthesizer for a company that makes FPGAs. You benefit by cutting down on 
your development time by using Icarus Verilog, and the company pays you 
because it wants something which does place and route for their hardware.

You can earn money writing operating systems for new hardwares / servers. 
IBM pays you to write quality software because it helps their platform. 
They make hardware but don't want their customers to have to shell out 
extra money to buy IIS, which probably is quite crappy anyway. So they 
hire you to improve apache, mysql, etc.

You can earn money by writing compilers for different kinds of processors. 
You get to use gcc and not re-invent the wheel, the company gets a 
compiler which optimizes for their kind of hardware and gets to show of 
their superior products.

Not Necessarily. For example, if you're working as a contract programmer 
making software for a big company, you sell them your program and give the 
code with it. This does not automatically imply that they'll redistribute 
it on the net. And you benefit from having spent a lot less time in 
writing that code.

Ok, let's see this. You sell your GPLed product to this company.
This company likes your product. Why shouldn't this company put
your product on their ftp server for other's download pleasure 
and social service ? And when that happens, why should someone pay

On the other hand, if the company doesn't want any other entity
to use your s/w but only them (for reasons like maintaining an edge
in market, maintaining monopoly etc.), why should they accept you 
selling it to them under GPL ? Because then _you_ will be a threat
to them, because, as the author, you retain the right to distribute/
sell it to others too!

Same with the other examples.

In this particular case (the verilog synthesis tool), it would infact 
be giving it away with their hardware. The point is, you're still a 
software engineer, but your employer is a hardware company. Its employing 
you to keep customizing and improving the software (using the benefits of 
other free software that may be out there) for every iteration of their 
hardware product.

Say you work for IBM and are part of the team that works on the 
file-system drivers for linux. IBM _is_ going to give away that software 
for free, not out of the goodness of their heart, but because it 
strengthens their platform.

The compromise is between having to start from scratch to write software 
for your particular platform (which you're essentially trying to sell and 
is your main product) to using free-software code to get a kickstart, but 
then making the source available for improvements. And IBM _does_ do this, 
and still profits.

Err, no. They can insist you transfer the copyright to them, and keep it 
inhouse. Just because GPL'ed code exists doesn't mean it has to be given 
to everyone. All the GPL says is that you can't distribute the executable 
without also distributing the source, and giving further distribution 
rights to yor client.

Well., thats the reason why the Free Software has been expanding. The
GPL is the reason why it has still stayed together. But for the GPL.,
most of the hard work of the Free Software community would have been
used in proprietary code and hence the effort of `Free`ing the community
would have gone waste.

Well., this is generally called `code-reuse`. And., it is not a dirty
thing. What is dirty is using `community work` for personal benefit.
When you take something from the community you ought to give back to the
community. That is exactly what the GPL enforces. In an Ideal world.,
there wont be any grudges in doing this., because everyone would be glad
to share their software. But this is not an Ideal world., so there need
to be rules. That is exactly what the GPL enforces.

Most companies develop software for use in some other company. These
software are of no use to the community as such., as they are
specialized to some company. Though it would be `ideal` to give this
software out as Free Software, the FS community does not demand it. When
company `A` develops software for company `B`., then if the software is
under a restrictive license., only the employees of company `B` would
suffer. So., when A sells software to B., it should consider the moral
values and give the sources of the software to B under a non-restrictive
license. The company A need not release the source on the Internet. The
spirit of Software Freedom should be shared between the consumer and the
provider. When the consumer is general public in large., obviously you
need to publish the software on the Internet as it is the only easily
accessible means.

Now., this kind of software (the one developed by A for B) is what is
driving the software Industry. There are players such as Microsoft,
Adobe, Sun who write the latter kind of software (where the consumers
are the general public). These companies wont fall on the ground and
crash because they have given their software out as Free Software. They
still will survive (pretty well) because of the support requirement in
the market. Morover, they'll be able to make more money because many of
the bugfixes and software testing would be done by the public who have
free access to the source code.

The business model using Free Software is different and may not return
good rewards in _some_ cases. But what matters is ethics in business.

I guess the point being missed out in this discussion, as I pointed
out in my previous mail, is that Free Software (I shall leave out Open
Source...I'm still hazy about it) was created as a concept to empower
_users_, and not companies. Irrespective of whether an Adobe or a
Microsoft, or even IBM, make business if they start giving away the
source code or not; GPL was designed to ensure that an end user has
the flexibility to change the code if he/she is not happy with its
functionality. So, if you are able to make a living out of
customizing, and providing service for GPL'd products, good..you are
an example the FS community can use for promotion of GPL. If you are
not, that *doesn't* serve as an argument for discarding GPL...it
should still exist to serve the ideologies for which it was sketched
out. As far as GPL's viral condition is concerned, if it had not been
for it, we would have for sure had lesser GPL'd software around...and
that is not good for the FS community...and that's good enough reason
for it to stay.

If you still want to make software keeping only greater profits in
mind, and not the users, go ahead...nobody is stopping you...but don't
expect the FS community to help you out in any way...this is what the
GPL should ensure...and it does a good job at that...

Hi Ayan,

There are many ways of earning a living by writing softwares. I am
talking about a particular way of earning in which:

	- I* write a software
	- I release it under GPL
	- I am owner of the code
	- I want to earn money based on this s/w (not by donations)
	- and my core product in not the h/w on which this s/w runs
	  but the s/w itself

and the point I want to make is -

the GPLed s/w 'alone' would not bring you any money. You need to have 
some kind of a service/product around your GPLed s/w. That might be: 

	- support/maintenance services OR 
	- a hardware, which, as you say, which is your flagship product 
	  and on which your GPLed s/w is based

	  In this case, your good GPLed s/w product is a facilitator
	  to sales of your h/w. All your examples point to this case 
	           - the hardware company or IBM's h/w platform

	- OR ...

*'I' might as well be a group of people.

If we are talking about writing GPLed s/w, surrendering the copyright 
to someone else and earning a living, and letting him do whatever he
wants to do with it, then we are on different tracks and shouldn't 
continue.

Remember - not every s/w company have a h/w product to leverage on. 
This is very much  specific  in India  where  most  (should say all) 
companies provide 'solutions' and not sell h/w. 

Rest of the mail are replies to some of your points, which I have
summarized above.

Where does GPL come into the picture here ? 
	- You are an employee of that company

	- They define the license that the s/w should be released 
	  under. 

Where do _you_ touch GPL ? And where does it bring to _you_ all the 
GPL related issues ?

If that is the way our example-guy is earning a living, then he may 
not really be interested in the OpenSource movement at all! Because, 
he is not, in any way, bothered about giving his code to the *public* 
in general. I am _not_ talking about such a guy.

Let's come to the practical issue. From where will IBM pay me ? From 
money they earn from other business. That might be 
	- by providing support/maintenance of the same s/w that me 
	  and my team wrote
	- by selling more of the h/w that my s/w runs on, by the 
	  virtue that the combination is very stable, and as you said, 
	  by strengthening their platform

Does that mean that evey s/w company should start making h/w so that 
they can write GPL s/w for the h/w and sell more of the h/w, thus 
becoming a h/w company? 

The GPL s/w, in itself, is _not_ going to bring you any money. And 
that's what I am trying to say. You need to have services/products 
around your GPLed s/w. That might be support to customers, or a 
hardware to base on or something else.

Profit ? That's by selling the flagship product and not by making your 
GPLed code public. Ofcourse, as i said earlier, the code will always
be a facilitator.

 `---------

Transfering my copyright on a GPLed s/w to someone else so that he 
might turn it into a closed source product? Then why am I bothered 
about GPL at all in the first place ? And why this thread ?

I mean its OK to earn a living that way, but then i am not discussing 
that way of earning a living. I am talking about practical difficulties 
faced by a programmer who wants to ensure that his code remains GPL 
and he earns a living as well.

True. But my point is, that one does not need such a route to produce good 
software. As in, it is possible to have a world, where only free software 
exists - motivated by companies who earn their profits from the hardware 
on which the software runs or which it interfaces to, or as you said, from
support/writing manuals,etc.

And, such companies (hardware or support) can employ programmers who then 
can, if they so choose, feed their families and avoid a life of privation.

In GNU-centric world, it may not be possible for you to just write a 
program and start earning money off it directly. But this does not portend 
the end of programming and programmers, or of quality software. And, it 
ensures a world where users have "real freedom" with the software they 
buy, and open sharing of code means a lot less man-hours wasted on 
recoding the same thing in multiple closed-source projects.

And one more thing, there is a situation where you *could* make money in a 
write software release under GPL scenario,

        - I go ask big client (like say a bank) about what software they 
need.

	- I go charge money for the software. Since the program is 
completely customized for the particular company, it shall be willing to 
pay more. You give them the program under the terms of the GPL, ie. you 
give them the source. The question of them redistributing it doesn't arise 
because a) The program is customized for their needs. b) You've made 
enough money off it through this one sale, so you don't really care.

Of course, if you didn't GPL it, you could charge money everytime their 
system grew and they needed to make small changes to the software to 
facilitate this. But that's what the GPL is about -- the rights of the 
consumer. She's paid you for the program, now she should own it - 
executable AND source.

My aim was not to list the various ways of earning money by
giving away source code. It's not that I forgot that other ways 
exist.

My aim was to 'analyze' the way which I mentioned in the earlier
mail.

Hi,

I have a TataIndicom connection with phone LG-350T walky.
I am able to use this quite well on windows.

When i boot into linux(Redhat-9 and 2.4.20-8 kernel version) and try
to use it, the modem is not recognized.

This is a USB CDMA phone. So possibly the acm.o driver must be used.
kudzu detects this and shows the name as QualComm CDMA USB phone.
syslog shows
====

As per the lines mentioned in this text, my /proc/bus/usb/devices

I:  If#= 1 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=0a(data ) Sub=00 Prot=00 Driver=none

So possibly this phone modem is not recognized by the driver.
Pls do help me in configure this phone for Linux.
Will it help if i upgrade to FC2+?

What exactly is a C command line parser? Do you want a parser for the
command line, written in C? If yes, then all it takes is to have a
loop that walks over the argv[] array. The getopt() library function
does most of the work for you, if you want a short-circuit solution.

Again, like others I am not sure of what you want. But why don't you
try Bison or Yacc ? Will make things easier for you.

"C command line parser" - very ambiguous. I usually
use lex/yacc or flex/bison.

One Day One Command 
===================

su -- Run a shell with Substitute User 

Summary:

`su' allows one user to temporarily become another user.  It runs a
command with the Real & Effective user id, group id and supplemental
groups of a given user. If user not given, it will login as root.

Examples:

$ su -- Run a new shell with root user.

$ su user1 -- Run a new shell with user1.

$ su -c ls -- Run the command with substitute user.

$ su -f user1 -- Fast login (skips startup files).

$ su -p user1 -- Preserve the environment variables.

$ su -l user1 -- Unset all env variables, change Home dir and run 
                 shell startup files.

$ su -s /bin/csh -- Run csh shell instead of the user's default shell.

  I'm not sure exactly why, but almost all the Athlon family CPUs are
hard to find in good used condition in India. You can still get new, boxed
Athlon XP 2400s and Sempron 2800s, but they're expensive.

Message-ID: <37e348a705070406574ceee72c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
 I need a utility for opening a file of size 3GB.
 I tried  vim ,it doesn't help.
 I am trying 2 open the file in server (it doesn't have utils like
emacs or kwrite,etc. )
 Help me in this aspect.
 Why i need 2 do that is
 using Mysqldump I have created dumpfile.sql( a dumpformat of Mysqldump)
now i want 2 do some modifications in that sql file which is of 3GB size.
 I don't want 2 split because it will create some other problem.
 Thanks,

the seriousness of the gnulinuxclub to deal with practical,
implementational as well as theoretical issues that intrigue and amuse

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0507052102470.8836-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

Linux is included in 11th std Computer Science syllabus in Tamil Nadu.
Linux Users Groups should help the Teachers and Students to understand 
the Linux and FOSS concepts.

One Day One Command 
===================

eject -- Eject the removable media

Summary:

Eject allows removable media (like CD-ROM, Floppy, Tape, JAZ, ZIP) to
be ejected under software control. The command can also control some
multi-disc CD-ROM changers, the auto-eject feature supported by some
devices, and close the disc tray of some CD-ROM drives.

Examples:

$ eject -- Eject the default device, mostly CD.

$ eject -v -- Same as above and show more info.

$ eject /dev/cdrom -- Eject CD using device file name.

$ eject -t -- Close the drive tray.

$ eject -vt -- Same as above and show more info.

Read: man eject

Bye :)

Each mail is supposed to be distinct. The Message-ID is garbled when
you send it to more than one list. When people use Message-ID to look
for a particular message they get multiple emails, something an
automated tool may not know how to handle. Sometimes they complain
about duplicate emails, and even prevent a particular email to be
displayed (like in Gnus).

Though this seems trivial, people who are pedantic about
e-mail automation would not encourage posting to multiple groups simultaneously.

Tech Tip

Different people have different ways of training Spamassassin's
Bayesian filter. One of the easiest is to use Maildir mailboxes, and
simply move any spam you find in your inbox to your spambox and vice
versa. Then do this:

  find $SPAMBOX | xargs grep -l 'X-Spam-Status: No' | \
  xargs sa-learn --file --spam --showdots

  find $INBOX | xargs grep -l 'X-Spam-Status: Yes' | \
  xargs sa-learn --file --ham --showdots

That will re-train Spamassassin on any misclassified messages, without
interrupting normal training.

If you want to purge your spam mailbox of old stuff automatically, you
can use find for that, too:

  find $SPAMBOX/cur -mtime +2 | xargs rm -f

HTH :)

Vulnerability Flagged in Adobe Reader for Unix, Linux
By John MacKenna
July 6, 2005

Adobe Systems on Tuesday warned users of its Adobe Reader 5.0 for
Linux and Unix that a security vulnerability could leave their systems
open to remote hijacking.

The buffer overflow vulnerability is present in Versions 5.0.9 or
5.0.10 for Linux, Solaris, IBM-AIX and HP-UX, according to the
company's security alert. The Denmark-based security analyst company
Secunia rated the flaw as "highly critical," and Adobe advised users
to upgrade to more recent versions of Reader.

 My regard for the Communist Party of India greatly increased after
they shot down the software patents proposal a few months back. But
the manner in which they obstruct each and every proposal of the govt
am not very sure that they did it with the good of the society in mind
:-)

The strong support that the s/w patent proposal got from the IT
biggies in India (Infosys, TCS, etc) is worrying. So it makes sense to
be on guard lest it gets introduced sneakily - even without the Left's
knowledge!

Could the lawyer who frequents this list throw more light on how to be on guard?

But, software patents have already been stopped in
India, right?

The kernel has a packet-filter inbuilt into it (iptables, ebtables).
Look at it. Try to add any feature that is still missing in it. Check

With the communists in a fairly strong position now, I dont think 
this will happen while the Manmohan Singh govt lasts, at least

By which time I hope there's enough international precedent to bury 
this issue deep and forget it.

Message-ID: <79d5fd8005070705054cfae11a@mail.gmail.com>

Hai,

My friend has Redhat EL 3 WS - when he start sendmail it says "no mailer 
defined"

In the /etc/mail directory the size of the sendmial.cf
<http://sendmial.cf>is zero !? (i dont know why). and when i execute

m4 /etc/mail/sendmail.mc > /etc/mail/sendmail.cf

it says file missing /usr/share/sendmail-cf/m4/cf.m4
and i checked rpm -qa | sendmail it says sendmail-cf was missing (since i 
dont have the CD )
all i want to know is whether sendmail-cf is available in RHEL 3 WS and if 
there after installing it will the problem
get solved or there is something more what i am missing.

(Please urgent request)


Thanks & Regards
selvarajank

So you have overwritten your sendmail.cf with a 0 byte file

You can download the sendmail-cf rpm off any redhat FTP server

Assuming you have the sendmail.mc from which that sendmail.cf was 
built, and assuming some genius has not gone and edited sendmail.cf 
directly, and instead done what the sendmail people recommend - 
change sendmail.mc and then run m4 to generate sendmail.cf.

Some more hints for your friend -

RHEL 3 WS doesn't have this pkg.

You can download it from elsewhere - other redhat versions will have it.
Or you can download the sendmail source for that version from 
ftp.sendmail.org and then build a mc using the redhat supplied 
sendmail.mc [edit the path in sendmail.mc where it looks for include 
files though, first]

If the ilugc meetings would be atleast audio recorded and put up as an mp3 
file in the ilugc web or sent as attachment onhte mailinglist, it would be 
helpful for ilugc members who didn't attend the meetings. (Not everyone 
would attend eery meeting). Comments are awaited.

Subject: [Ilugc] sending mail from an arbitrary mail id using a local smtp
	server
Message-ID: <654433ee05070710476f2bcfd6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
     I am currently running Ubuntu 5.04 and using Postfix to send
mail. I have set up Evolution to use Postfix to send mail. I am pretty
new to using a local smtp server to send mail, so pardon me if I don't
know the concepts behind this too well.

I tried sending a mail to my yahoo address from a spoofed gmail
address such as foo@gmail.com - I was able to see to see and read this
mail fine in yahoo. When I tried sending the same mail to my gmail
address(with the spoofed foo@gmail.com) it worked fine - though the
mail appeared in my gmail inbox only after a bit of a delay... Isn't
this a problem (that I can spoof pretty much any address when I send a
mail) ??

In the headers shown in yahoo, I see the term domainkeys, what's that?
And in gmail there is a name, value pair as 'Received-SPF: neutral
(gmail.com: 59.92.43.77 is neither permitted nor denied by domain of
foo@gmail.com)', do these have something to do with verification of
the sender mail address? And why the 'X-Apparently-To' ??

These are headers as shown in yahoo mail:

Message-ID: <f6a0291a05070718091306efb3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Fedora Core 4 has problem with motherboards with Trident Drivers like
trident cyberbalde etc.
The screen goes blank. To solve this problem install FC4 in text 
mode. Then replace
/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/libvgahw.a  from fc3 or mandriva(mdk). I copied
from mandriva2005 & it works.

Another solution is replace driver "trident:"  with "vesa" in
xorg.conf. It will work with generic driver, but multimedia programs
like xine , mplayer will not work properly. This problem is listed in
fc4 bugzilla

no. it is just a feature of the smtp protocol

that said you really should be doing this when you run smtp servers

Oh ok... Well, it sure is a convenient feature. I am using BSNL
Broadband currently, and I happen to have a vsnl.net address which I
want to use. The problem is that vsnl.net server handling SMTP doesn't
allow me to send mail unless I have actually 'dialled-in' !! Which
needless to say is a real pain... And they dont seem to support SMTP
Auth either... I guess I cant really relay my mail through the vsnl
smtp servers either..
 
> that said you really should be doing this when you run smtp servers

This is certainly very interesting... 

By setting these like this(in main.cf), 

        myhostname = vsnl.net
	mydomain = vsnl.net
	myorigin = $mydomain

I should be able to eliminate the lines in the headers which say that
the mail was recieved from localhost.localdomain??, i.e

Message-ID: <BAY12-DAV2C8623AE48149AF4E471DF5DB0@phx.gbl>

Hi

With Mandriva LE 2005, I am able to connect to my VSNL dial up using KPPP as 
root without any problem. But when I am launching KPPP as a user, it stops 
with initiating modem and get terminating. Since it is working perfectly 
when launched as root, I am not suspecting any problem with modem, pppd or 
ISP. What could be the other cause? Was it due to any permission problem? If 
so how to solve it?

Any suggestion from members will be appreciated.

Thanks.

I do believe they have a mailserver for roaming users, that supports AUTH.

Or if you stick to your gmail account you can use gmail's smtp server

Who cares about the received headers?  Give your machine a proper 
hostname (maybe in the example.com domain, or get yourself dynamic 
dns using, say, tzo.com or dnsalias.com) - dont set up fake hostnames 
like that though

Change the name of your box to something other than 
localhost.localdomain anyway

We can simply send a Minutes of the Meeting.

An interesting thing to do would be to have a weekly
radio news/update. We can stream it or have it for
download. There are colleges where they do radio
broadcasting, like Anna University, Chennai, and Kongu
Engineering College, Erode. They can broadcast it too
over their network. Or if someone knows anyone in AIR,
we can try to start with a daily 10-minute program on
GNU/Linux updates. But, we must try to be
self-sustained as much as possible, than depend on
others for everything. 

We did have this discussion few months back, but, we
didn't continue thereafter.

We can cover the following:

1. weekly mailing list discussions (briefly)
2. news from slashdot.org and other online journals
3. GNU/Linux ads
4. Meeting/LUG activity announcements 
5. CDs availability announcements
6. GNU/Linux job announcements
7. Telephone interviews with industry people

We can use Audacity to do the sound recording and
editing.

We need radio jockeys! Maybe we can have the auditions
this LUG meeting! (Saturday, July 9, 2005).

Requirements: One only needs to have a GNU/Linux
system with sound card and an Internet connection - so
you can send in your track updates. This will be your
local studio.

We can also have a name for this project. Each
individual can take up one section. The editing team
can take care of editing all the tracks, and putting
them together. 

Of course, it depends on how many people are
interested in it. It doesn't have to be just Chennai
LUG. Contribution can come from different LUGs. It can
also be in regional languages.

Just my thoughts,

SK

i guess it has been there for quite some time...it even got a gmail

Message-ID: <bc3fff5205070800424f5376e8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Friends!
   
   I am using Mandrake 9.2 with KDE. yesterday i have tried to install 
fonts. 
  For that i copied required .ttf files to "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF" 
and i run the command "$mkfontdir" inside the TTF. 
  After that , fonts have worked untill the sytem shutdown but today
morning it didnt load the xserver. while startx... it shows the
following
error..

 First lot of Warning messages like this...

 " Warning : Symbol map for key<ESC> redefined 
             Using last definition for conflicting fields  "

 Finally it gives

 "  Errors from xkbcomp are not fatal to the X server
    Could not init font path element unix/:-1,removing from list!
   
    Fatal server error:
    could not open default font 'fixed' "


  I have searched in google but everyone give different solutions..
someone told its because of lack of disk space partition in /tmp .

That is also true i have less free space in root .
Can i delete the /tmp files? which files are all important in /tmp? 

And also i have very big log files. Shall i empty log file contents?

pls suggest me.

Thank You

Audio would be effective in linux advocacy, but when it goes technical,
I believe audio broadcasts would not serve the purpose.

I don't know for sure about all distributions, but I think that the
user must be a member some group which is authorized to spawn pppd. In
Debian, it is `dip'.

Could you tell me the error pppd gives when you click ``Details'' in
the KPPP error dialog box?

you should probably symlink that file to /etc/rc5.d folder, as say
S70xfs...or else you will need to do this everytime yous start your

Depends. It is probably the Swiss army knife of web developers, but to
me, it looked an overkill.

> Is there any problem due to deletion of tmp files?

A blanket rm -rf * .* as root in the init 3/5 stage is for sure
inviting trouble. Some applications, like orbit (most gnome apps need
it), xfs etc. may put their control sockets over there. You might face
problems with opening new applications. Well designed running
applications using tmp files shouldn't be affected by deletion, as it
is usually advised to keep the temp file open throughout the program.
Unix unlinking semantics ensure then that deleting the file doesn't
affect the program. Again, to be on the safer side, better not to do
it.

Most distros do clean up the tmp folder at boot time, and through a
cron script. If you really want to clean up your tmp manually, it is
usually safe to go to init 1 by using 'telinit' so that almost all
apps get closed, and then come back to init 3/5.

The solution I use is to have tmpfs mounted on /tmp. All files in a
tmpfs are stored in the kernel buffer cache (memory if possible, swap
otherwise), and hence all contents are automatically lost on a reboot.
Morever, it is likely to be faster, since it avoids the disk as much
as possible. Caveats: you lose anything that you store in /tmp (You
shouldn't be doing that anyway !). Secondly, ensure that you don't
allocate too much space for it (using size parameter in mount). If you
happen to fill up all of the space, and there is no virtual memory
left for other programs, your computer will lock. There is usually a
tmpfs mounted on /dev/shm to form with POSIX. If you don't want two
partitions, you will need to symlink /dev/shm to a folder in /tmp, or
vice versa...this might need hacking your init scripts.

Hope this answers your question :)

it moves on...

 Great idea!
If we implement this,surely it will create great change.
 Now a days most of the technical guys and students have the
awareness about linux and free soft (it also increase day by
day by mailgroups,meetings,school/college syllabus).
 But What about End users? (who is going to use the linux applications)
Now a days most of them started to computerized their (even small) 
business.In <http://business.In> town
sides,they only know computer as computer with MS Windows(mostly pirate ).
So atleast they should hear few words about linux and free soft. Then
only they think about linux side.
 To overcome this , surely the only way is radio . Because Radio is the 
easiest and popular media over middle class.
so please discuss 
about this.

Depending on which login manager you have installed xdm, gdm or kdm,
try /etc/init.d/kdm start.

That *should* work.

Otherwise, remove kde, use apt-cdrom add to get your CD recognized,
and reinstall x-window-system, kde etc.

I am a bit surprised that you've managed to get enough from CD 1. I
bet you'll start missing stuff almost immediately ...

I think we can create a portal like http://mohankumars.com 
this would be useful, if we wud put up audio files explaining various 
concepts of linux varying from those for newbies to experts.
And the same portal should have a radio streaming facility as that of 
mohankumars' live radio.
We shouldn't be strict about using unpatented or linux-only compatible 
encoding. Because we should attract windows users also to linux. If we put 
up the audio files in windows media player non-compatible format, then, 
windows users may not be interestedin downloading mplayer for windows and 
playing the files in command line mode. So we may lose some visitors. Our 
aim should be to provide knowledge to existing linux users and to attract 
windows users to the linux community.
Comments are welcome.

Message-ID: <9a9bfc170507080555d3efb5e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

A doubt regarding the usage of sha-bang in shell scripts. One problem
in specifying the interpreter is that we don't know the path of the
program when we want the program to be redistributable. sh can be
assumed to be on /bin/sh but this is not the case with other
interpreters. One solution suggested is to use env to find out the
executable using PATH. However, it turns out that the location of env
itself is not standard. I've seen systems with it being in /bin as
well as /usr/bin. Is their any good solution for this ?

it moves on...

Your /etc/X11/XF86Config should look like this: (in particular, 
"Protocol" must be "ImPS/2"):

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Configured Mouse"
        Driver          "mouse"
        Option          "CorePointer"

        Option          "Protocol"              "ImPS/2"

I vote for MOM. Just like somebody doesn't have time to attent every

Extracts from the announcement...

---------- Forwarded message ----------
From: Benj. Mako Hill <mako@ubuntu.com>
Date: Jul 8, 2005 3:44 PM
Subject: Announcing Launch of ($10m) Ubuntu Foundation
To: ubuntu-announce@lists.ubuntu.com

Mark Shuttleworth and Canonical Ltd, founders of the popular Ubuntu
Linux-based operating system, have today announced the creation of The
Ubuntu Foundation with an initial funding commitment of US$10m.

The Ubuntu Foundation will employ core Ubuntu community members to
ensure that Ubuntu (www.ubuntu.com) will remain fully supported for an
extended period of time, and continue to produce new releases of the
distribution. As a first step, the Foundation announces that Ubuntu
version 6.04, due for release in April 2006, will be supported for
three years on the desktop and five years on the server.

Ubuntu has quickly become a leading distribution in the free software
world, taking the #1 place in DistroWatch popularity rankings over all
timescales which are published. The distribution focuses on usability,
security and stability on desktops and servers, and on making free
software widely available for individuals and organisations who are
ready to switch from proprietary platforms, such as Microsoft Windows.

LONGER SERVER SUPPORT CYCLE

One driving factor behind the creation of the Foundation was the need
to ensure that an Ubuntu release can be deployed on servers, which
demand much slower release and upgrade cycles. "In order to support
the use of free software on database and other servers, we will be
offering security support for the Ubuntu base and major server
components for a full five years", said Matt Zimmerman, CTO of the
Ubuntu project.

KEEPING FREE SOFTWARE FREE

Both Canonical and the Ubuntu Foundation have made public
commitments that Ubuntu will always be freely available, without the
need for royalties or licence payments of any kind. "We include only
free and unencumbered applications, ensuring that users have the
ability to share and modify their software."

CONTINUED SUPPORT FROM CANONICAL LTD.

The establishment of the Ubuntu Foundation enhances the commercial
commitment already made to the Ubuntu project by Canonical, Ltd.
"Demand for the commercial services offered by Canonical to users of
Ubuntu continues to grow. We welcome the very large number of
companies that have announced support for Ubuntu both regionally and
globally, and expect to continue to create additional partnership,
certification and support programs in coming months," stated Jane
Silber, head of marketing at Canonical.

The Ubuntu Community Council will act as the advisory board of the
Foundation. Current members of that Council are Benjamin Mako Hill,
Colin Watson, James Troup and Mark Shuttleworth (Chairman).

Mr Benjamin!
Its not for some one who doesn't have time to attend the meeting, but for 
people who are from various cities other than chennai who can't come to the 
meeting. You can see from the past few mails on getting the T-Shirt through 
courier, that there are members for ilugc who stay outside chennai. These

Hi,
	I just got a dataone connection with the UT-300R2 modem. But i haven't been able to connect even once. 

I tried to connect using rp-pppoe in debian, but i get a CHAP failure even though the username and password are correct.

	pppd 2.4.2 started by root, uid 0
	pppd[3247]: Using interface ppp0
	pppd[3247]: not replacing default route to eth0 [192.168.1.1]
	pppd[3247]: local  IP address 10.64.64.64
	pppd[3247]: remote IP address 10.112.112.112

	pppoe[3264]: PPP session is 444
	pppd[3247]: CHAP authentication failed: The account or password is incorrect.
	pppd[3247]: Connection terminated.

Then, i configured the PPPOE connection in the modem itself through the web interface. I used vpi and vci values 0 and 35 respectively. The PPoE LED lights up but there's no connection. This is the system log of the modem firmware.

DSL Carrier is up

      The default gateway adress 10.112.112.112 gets assigned automatically. i dont know if its right.

Well, that looks fairly straightforward.  In some cases the bsnl side
might be having some problems; so do retry after a while if you think
your username/passwd combo is perfect.

Googling and some subsequent reading did not give me a satisfactory
response to your query. But if the location of the executables (more
importantly, the shell) across distros/Unix flavours itself is not
standardized, then it just might not be possible to have uber
portability. Using /bin/sh does guarantee portability, but could be at
the expense of functionality I guess.

I know this post does not answer your query, but I came across a few
interesting solutions to the problem. One was to do away with shebang
itself (http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/std/shebang/)

The Debian policy on scripts makes things pretty clear. Use /bin/sh
(which could be a link to a POSIX compliant shell) If you use
non-POSIX shell, add a approriate shebang line and make your script
dependent on the shell package.

Hi,

For the past two days, I haven' been able to connect
with BSNL DataOne. Has anyone else been having this
problem?

I have the power, LAN and WAN ports glowing, but, when
I connect using "adsl-start", I get a timed out. The
guy in the exchange is pretty nice so he does help
out. He checked the line and said all connections were
fine. I captured packets with "tcpdump" and it said
"My account has expired". WTF? 

My last option from my side is to test with a
different modem tomorrow.

Better, do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86. It goes through all
settings and lets dpkg maintain the configuration.

And, the file is XF86Config-4.

It has been disconnecting more often, and takes more retries of
adsl-start to reconnect. But another than that, it's OK and
the bandwidth is fine.

The suggesstions about MOM,audio,video recordings are very good. But
where is the volunteers to do all these?

We need atleast 4-5 student volunteers to maintain website, meeting
details,volunteering for events etc.

Earlier MOM was very regular with suraj volunteering for this task.
During 'suraj era' he was maintaining the web site also. 

We can act on suggesstions only when we have more people,
particularly students.

The Linux knoweledge I have today is from reading + stuffs people explained 
via forums, HOW-TOs, articles, email etc . For others I don't know. As for 
me, you are wrong. My Interest in Linux started after reading an article on 
Torvalds in Reader's Digest. I simply expressed my preference ( and wishes ) 
for MOM over Audio Recording of the meets which in no way should prevent 
ilugc from doing so. Meaning if both were avaiable, I 'll pick MOM. Btw, you 
can casually call me Benjamin (without the mr), I am just a kid here. If 
there's lack of man power to maintain both, may there should be a poll to 
decide.

It's called podcasting.
have a look at http://lugradio.org and,
http://radio.linuxquestions.org/linux/lq-podcasts/

Actually it's not a bad idea, provided we have a dedicated team for this.

Anyone interested in becoming a internet-radio superstar ?

ilugc meetings are composed of two parts,

* the technical talks
* the discussions after the talks

We can concentrate on the second point while creating the podcast.
The discussion usually lasts 15-20 minutes, this should be enough for a
podcast ogg/mp3 file.

The file can be around 8-10 MB so that even the dial-up ilugc members
can download it.

Any takers for the project ?

ohh, btw to know more about podcasting,

Subject: [Ilugc] [help] which TV Tuner card on linux ?
Message-ID: <42CF83BD.3050508@gmail.com>

Hi,

Has anyone played around with TV on Linux ?

I'm searching Ritchie Street for TV tuner cards for a PMR (personal
media recorder).
I find the Pinnacle brand of tv tuner cards really good and they seem to
be available at affordable rates.How is the driver support for these cards ?

This PMR will run MythTV mostly because of the time shifting that MyThTV
supports.Currently the best bet seems to be MyThKnoppix, Knoppix with
MythTV that works out of the box bypassing the MySQL setup hassles.

Any ideas/tips/feedback/suggestions/etc from the community are welcome.. :)

That was a nice article...however it is really hard to come up with
something as convenient as this mechanism. Even if I were to limit
myself to linux, it is still a problem when it comes to interpreters
like perl, python etc; even if you were to tie yourselves down with
/bin/sh for shell programming (being a zsh user, I know how limiting
it is). I guess the only solution for this would be for FHS to get env
in /bin. The problem with /usr/bin/env is that if it can be there, it
can also be in /usr/local/bin/env. There are no alternatives if you
can fix it to /bin/env. Linux with a 127 char limit ??!!
Well...yeah...I saw the source as well...that's disappointing...may be
the kernel developers have other reasons...

it moves on...

No.   In   Europe,  patents  are  governed  by   the  European 
Patent Convention,   as    amended   from   time   to    time  
since   1973.
http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/e/ar52.html#A52

Article 52

Patentable inventions

(1) European  patents shall be  granted for  any inventions  which are
    susceptible  of industrial  application, which  are new  and
which involve an inventive step.

(2) The following  in particular shall  not be regarded  as inventions
    within the meaning of paragraph 1:

(a) discoveries, scientific theories and mathematical methods;

(b) aesthetic creations;

(c) schemes, rules and  methods for  performing mental  acts,  playing
    games or doing business, and programs for computers;

(d) presentations of information.

(3) The provisions  of paragraph 2 shall exclude  patentability of the
    subject-matter or activities referred to in that provision only
to the  extent to  which a  European patent  application  or
European patent relates to such subject-matter or activities as
such.

(4) Methods for  treatment of the human  or animal body  by surgery or
    therapy and  diagnostic methods practised  on the human  or
animal body shall not be regarded  as inventions which are
susceptible of industrial  application within  the meaning  of
paragraph  1. This provision shall not apply to products, in
particular substances or compositions, for use in any of these
methods.

The above  is in accordance with  TRIPS Agreement, and as  we can
see, computer programs are  not patentable in Europe.  If  there are
any EU patents for  software, they are  merely invalid and ultra 
vires.  The whole problem is because a few mega corporations either
won't or can't see the  reasons behind these laws,  and keep
lobbying  every where to introduce patentability for software by
hook or crook.

It is illegal and unlawful to patent computer programs under the
TRIPS Agreement, that  came into  force 10 years  ago.  Patents 
granted for software in some  jurisdictions like US or other  select
countries are no longer  valid after the TRIPS  Agreement came into 
effect.  If any signatory  to  the  TRIPS  treaty  has laws  that 
allow  patents  for software,  then   such  nations  are   clearly 
in  breach   of  their international obligations,  and could  be
held liable  and answerable. The  home  for  "software  patents"  
is  the  US,  and  some  of  its corporations that  think this as an
 easy device to make  money out of thin air, have been lobbying in
Europe to give legitimacy to "software patents",  and   this  move 
has   been  defeated  recently   with  an overwhelming majority.

ffii.org leads the battle against  these moves in Europe. Nearly
1,934 companies  with   about  31,488  employees  and   annual 
turnover  of 3,258,164,082 EUR, have entrusted  the FFII to defend
their interests, which they define at

Now,  the US  is largely  isolated and  alone on  this  issue. 
FAREED ZAKARIA  has reviewed  the book  titled "THE  WORLD IS  FLAT:
 A Brief History  of  the Twenty-First  Century"  by  Thomas  L. 
Friedman  at:
http://query.nytimes.com/search/article-printpage.html?res=9D07E6DB1731F932A35756C0A9639C8B63

The  reviewer notes  that "China  and India  loom large  in
Friedman's story because they are the  two big countries benefiting
most from the flat world".  He further says:

<quote>
The ultimate challenge for America  -- and for Americans -- is
whether we are  prepared for  this flat world,  economic and 
political. While hierarchies  are being  eroded  and playing  fields
 leveled as  other countries  and  people  rise   in  importance 
and  ambition,  are  we conducting  ourselves  in  a  way   that 
will  succeed  in  this  new atmosphere? Or will it turn out that,
having globalized the world, the United States had forgotten to
globalize itself?

It is  most tragic  that the  US has been  deaf to  what RMS  has
been crusading and  campaigning for  the past many  years.  The 
freedom of people  to use  the digital  medium with  utmost liberty 
will largely determine the very  fate and future of nations. It is 
not too late to make  amends,  and  change  policies  towards 
having  sane  laws  and practices. HTH.

Nice  Poster! Some minor suggestions:

Tux has a white hairy outline.  Try to feather the selection of tux by
say 5 pixels and  invert-selection and clear-selection twice or thrice
until the white outline goes away.  That will fix it.

Why that "KDE" and  "GNOME"? :) Is this going to be  a demo of various
desktop software?

If you are  thinking of distributing this as  photocopies, then try to
change the  background to something thats  not dark. Try  to Design it
all  in gray  scale (with  not much  'shades' or  variations  of 'half
tones' in there).

How about someone with some digital recording device do this recording

Who the fsck are they to decide? I give a damn whether
they accept it or not. They can't even write good,
clean code. GNU/Linux and Unix are far, far better
than micro$oft winblow$.

That is what I had been telling now. You are right. It gives the listener 
the feeling that he didn't miss the meeting. He hears every word uttered 
during the meet.
I would be a volunteer and balachandar had also offered to be one.
Atleast if 2-3 more ppl volunteer, the job would become easy.

Subject: [Ilugc] Linux-Bangalore 2005 - Preparations started
Message-ID: <42D0F7EE.7010100@gmx.net>

Hi folks,

          As some of you might know, Linux-Bangalore is an yearly event 
conducted by Bangalore LUG (BLUG) which attracts thousands of techies 
from all over the world. I'm a regular there since last two years.

        The talks given are top-notch with speakers from all over the 
world (Miguel de Icaza, Nat Friedman, Harald Welte, Brian Behlendorf, 
Sirtaj Singh Kang to name a few). It's pretty much the only Linux event 
which remains refreshingly community-driven, rather than vendor-driven. 
The entry fee is around 500 rupees (lunch & snacks included), the event 
takes place across 3 days. I enjoyed the past 2 years, and I'm guessing 
it would be as enjoyable this time, if not more.

        I haven't seen much discussion about this in ILUGC, for 
whichever reason. Recently, Atul Chitnis, the organizer of the event, 
started off the dicussions on the linux-bangalore list, with a request 
for suggestions and announcement of confirmation of the venue (until 
last year, it used to happen in IISc., but has been discontinued from 
this year due to problems with the IISc authorities). I can heartily 
recommend this event, so please sign-up at:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/linux-bangalore-2005/

And participate in the discussions. The previous year's pictures, info, 
etc is available on:

http://linux-bangalore.org/

All the Indian LUGs are given a separate track to do their own talks, 
and Atul Chitnis will announce when they start accepting talk proposals.


Vamsee.

Umm.. there are others too. Have you tried linux asia?  It had an 
excellent set of speakers back in 2004, at Delhi. I don't know much 
about the 2005 event that happened some months back, though.

Then - for network admin (and a lot of systems security / dns content 
as well) I'd suggest SANOG - http://www.sanog.org .. the next SANOG 
is during late jan 2006, in Bombay

So, start planning your work. One can talk a whole day
about ideas, but, at the end if we don't see any
initiative or output/result, the discussion isn't
worth anything.

I don't know how many LUG members actually announce
LUG meetings or other events at work, in your office.
This is the simplest thing you can do to contribute to
the community, create more awareness and invite more
members. 

You can simply send an e-mail to your office employees
announcing about the meeting, venue etc. everytime
there is a meet. You can also put up a poster in
bulletin boards in the office for others to see. Or if
you have a forum running in the LAN, you can post the
same too.

Regards,

SK

I guess he was volunteering for creating the meeting podcasts to be put
up on the official site and not for becoming the city's town-cry on
behalf of ILUGC.

Subject: [Ilugc] Join the campaign against "software patents"
Message-ID: <42D1D680.4030000@gmail.com>

I had forwarded a cc to Holger Blasum, one of the maintainers at 
ffii.org, wishing them more victories on this front. He requests Indian 
entities also to join the campain against "software patents" by signing 
up  at http://www.economic-majority.com/  Please do so, as India or 
Europe being free from "software patents" is not sufficient, and soon 
enough the scene should shift to the US.  If you distribute your 
software in the US, then the campaign is immediately relevant to you.  
It is ironical that such a campaign has to be done in US, which was once 
upon a time, a model state for the ultimate in liberty and freedom, but 
today, it stands as a symbol for a shackled state with all its  
"Software Patents", DMCA, DRM and even more unconceivable things like 
corporate run "prisons" (California alone has 21 (yes, twenty-one) 
mostly corporate run prisons and more about this at: 
http://improbablevoices.net/intro_frameset.html ).  Digital anarchy and 
industrial prisons make a deadly and dangerous combination making it a 
serious concern to netizens.     Fortunately, these aberrations are very 
recent, and could be nipped in the bud. Your participation could make a 
big difference to the momentum of the movement, that may help in 
restoring sanity where it is most required.

It was only an additional suggestion that I gave. 

I never asked you to be a city's town-cry on behalf of
ILUGC, but, I only said as a member you can let people
know about ILUGC at _your_ work place, and invite them
over. Its not going to cost you anything sending an
e-mail to your colleagues, does it? I personally know
lot of industry folks in this mailing list. 

The one thing I disklike about certain people is they
talk on and on in the mailing list, but, can't put
anything in practice. Practice what you preach.
Everyone should ask themselves, what have you done in
the past one week that makes you feel that you have
contributed something to this community or atleast
helped another person wit GNU/Linux. I will be the
first person to be happy for you.

Period.

Hi,

I can't login in to GUI or CUI mode.  

When I tried to login Iam getting the following error.

No Directory /home/babu!
Logging in with home = "/".
-bash: /home/babu/.bash_profile: Permission denied

-bash-3.00$

But there is a home directory for babu /home/babu. and
all the .bash_* files exits. I check all permission.

I have used the gnome-sound-recorder program to convert old cassette
tapes  to audio files. I am pretty sure you can get reasonable quality
audio with it.  Never tried it with presentations - might not be easy
to capture discussions and questions from the audience.

Seems, the ownership or permission for your home directory and/or this
file has been changed. To address this, login as root and do 'chown
babu.users /home/babu/ -R'. Also ensure that the user babu has atleast
the read permission to .bash_profile file.

It was reportedly very commercial and sometimes crassly so. Not sure
about reports that some of the speakers were led to the stage by girls
- was it Linux Asia or some other event ? The last time I attended
BangLinux was in 2000 and it was pretty good then. Delhi is a bit far

If permissions are OK then Check the /etc/passwd file for the home dir

You can download the example code, and whole document

Well, as far as I know, it never happened. Must be LinuxAsia, because 
they're the ones who charge mega-bucks to attend some specialized tracks 
(like sysadmin tracks et al) so they can afford to add that glitter. 
Speakers at Linux-Bangalore bring their own laptops and whatever 
material they need. Only the net connectivity, projector & hall are 
provided by the organizers. They have a pretty strict talk-proposal 
screening system.

Linux-Bangalore is not permitted to be commercial and deliberately so - 
the sponsor/vendor stalls at the event are forbidden from selling 
anything because it attracts commercial tax and lot of hassles for the 
organizers. All hand-outs are free (CDs, stickers, t-shirts, etc). And, 
I can assure you that there are very, very few girls ;-) That too, when 
some company sends in its whole workforce in a bus or something.

BangLinux was a sponsored event - by Wrox Publishers, if I'm not wrong. 
It no longer exists. Linux-Bangalore is a different event, conducted by 
the Bangalore Linux community. Sorry if I sound like some canvasser for 
the event, but this is one of the few decent events we have, and we 
cannot let it die due to apathy from the community. Apart from some 
minor goof-ups (like late handing of delegate kits) it's a pretty 
well-organized,  enjoyable event (hey, you get a free t-shirt too!).

Vamsee.

i think u would have got this problem after reinstalling ur OS keeping ur 
/home partition intact. I faced the same problem when I did that. If yes, 
just delete all those hidden files from root and also delete the user and 
recreate the user with /home/babu as the home directory. This time all those 
files will be created again and you wont have any problem. In any case I 
think this should work.

Hi Sriaara,

Use the following command (in a single line). 

pppd /dev/ttyS0 115200 debug usepeerdns 
defaultroute noauth connect '/usr/sbin/chat 
-v "" at+crm=1 OK "atdt#777" CONNECT' user 
internet password internet

For convenience write this as a shell script 
and run it whenever you want. To disconnect

killall -9 pppd

Best regards,

Ma SivaKumar

You can use the mixer ( gnome-volume-control) to choose your audio
source, mute others etc. iirc, the files are in wav format, you should
be able to convert it to mp3s.

Hi,

I am looking for a Linux trainer in Chennai who can, apart from a a
few other topics,  handle a workshop based on "Linux from scratch" for
a batch of 15-20 Support Engineers.

This will be a 2 week assignment and the compensation would be
attractive. This is best suited for someone who has in-depth knowledge
of how Linux works and who has a couple of weeks of time to spare.

This workshop will be a part of a longer traning program for Technical
Support professionals working on Operatring Systems and Applications.

Successful completion of this assignment may lead to a longer term relationship.

Please mail me your profile and contact details.

While I haven't used wvdial for long, the standard debian way of doing
ppp works  wonderfully fine  for me. I  used to  run 'sid' and  now am
running unstable after managing to  find the courage to download 400MB
of stuff for the upgradation.

Tata indicom  is the  best of all  dialups, IMO. Absolutely  very very
little downtime and very reliable. However, the speeds aren't the best
- ~7K/s (good enough for a dialup).

standard way = pppd? (am not familiar with debian) ppd is actually the
coolest way.
wvdial comes with some (really eyebrowe raising) TODO stuff like getting
the phone on speaker mode and then dialing in etc., pppd is truly hands
free...

I have gotten upto 9K/s. Easy to carry your internet connection across
the city. Really good in terms of the technology if one is looking at
dialup kinda features.
I ran into trouble with their billing. Not that they billed extra. Their
schemes are not well planned (I can say this, esp as I footed fixed high
monthly charges). With my bill payment date at 21st of every month, the
service used to get disconnected on 6th and payment had to be made
immediately for restoration of services. Talk of downtime... well, this
is downtime too, isnt it?

er where?

nothing you can't set in wvdial.conf

I don't know about FC3 being slow - in my experience, it was pretty fast
in overall desktop responsiveness with a few minor tweaks:

1) Turn off all unnecessary system services.
2) Install 256 MB of RAM, instead of the bare minimum 128 MB.
3) Get rid of udev, hal, etc. and downgrade to a static /dev tree.
4) Downgrade to XFree86-4.3.0. (not really necessary).

With these fixes, FC3 runs great on a P3/700 Dell Inspiron notebook
as well as a number of other systems I use. It is rock stable, and
definitely superior to any other RedHat distribution on overall
reliability, with the possible exception of RedHat 6.2/7.3.

I've just got FC4 yesterday, and I'll be trying it out shortly - but
it is reported
to be significantly faster for most C++ code - that includes stuff like Qt, KDE,
Mozilla, Firefox, etc.

why?  i haven't found udev to be a significant performance hog

hald and dbus on the other hand .. well they aren't too bad but you 
might have a point there

None of them are really resource hogs and these are fundamental 
advancements which you cannot really downgrade without breaking a whole 
lot of user space apps sitting on top of it.  In fact for FC5 the whole

GCC 4 is not expected to be a big performance improvement at this point. 
The framework for optimization from Red Hat  is entirely new. see 
http://lwn.net/Articles/84888/. Taking advantage of this framework will 
be a part of the minor point releases like GCC 4.1.  FC4 improvements 
were as a result of other changes like boot code optimisation using 
programs like bootchart (http://bootchart.sf.net) along with other work 
which has happened upstream

Thanks. Looks like I do need to try fc4 somewhere instead of slackware.

One Day One Command 
===================

od -- Dump files in Octal and other formats.

Summary:

'od' (Octal Dump) writes an unambiguous representation of the file in
screen. Each line of output consists of the offset in the input,
followed by groups of data from the file.

Examples:

Create a 2 lines text file to test following examples.

$ od myfile -- Dump the content and Offset in Octal format.

$ od -a myfile -- Dump the content as named char.

$ od -b myfile -- Dump the content in octal bytes.

$ od -c myfile -- Dump the content in ASCII.

$ od -h myfile -- Dump the content in Short Hex.

$ od -w6 myfile -- Set output width to 6 Bytes. Default is 16.

$ od -j6 myfile -- Skip initial 6 Bytes.

$ od -N6 myfile -- Read only 6 Bytes.

$ od -Ad myfile -- Show Offset values in decimal.

$ od -Ax myfile -- Show Offset values in Hex.

$ od -An myfile -- Don't show the Offset.

Read: man od

Sounds like we need GNOME chart now ;-).  What system configuration is 
this? See if the following command helps.

gconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/metacity/general/reduced_resources true

Use system-config-services or ntsysv to turn off services/deamons you dont use. Make sure you have the relevant updates

Been there, done that - the gains are only marginal as far as the
performance of the GNOME apps  go.  GNOME apps on Ubuntu are on an
average a lot snappier - mind you, I don't have any hard numbers; it
is very clear that packaging of GNOME apps is done with lot of care by
the  Ubuntu folks.   Working with  Ubuntu restored my confidence in
GNOME.

Not trying to start anything, btw. Thanks for all your Fedora and

Cheap hardware. If you just want to use it for a year
or so, go ahead with it. 

Instead, you can spend a little more and get a good,
sturdy laptop that will help you in the long run.

I will recommend the Thinkpads.

An AMD AthlonXP 1800+ with 512MB RAM,
ASUS A7V400-MX motherboard and
NVidia GeForce2/MX video card (64 MB RAM).

There's another Pentium III 450 MHz,
256MB RAM and i440BX motherboard with
onboard S3 Trio3d video card (apparently,
an IBM 300GL desktop) on which GNOME
literally crawls.

The problem is mostly with responsiveness if
the following set of applications are open in
the default GNOME desktop:
    * mozilla/firefox/opera/epiphany
    * beep-media-player/xmms
    * xchat
    * A couple of terminal windows with emacs
      and/or zsh.

The above are being managed on 8 workspaces.
They work peacefully without a snag on
window-maker/enlightenment/openbox
(with ROX-Session).

My complaint is not against FC4, but rather against
GNOME itself. KDE is somewhat more responsive than
GNOME on my machines. It is usable on an old
Pentium II 266 MHz with 128MB RAM (Compaq
Deskpro 4000 i.e.) from a knoppix live CDROM.

However, changing the default gtk theme to something
lighter (ThinIce for instance) improves the speed
of GNOME, slightly.

I'll try this out.

I generally leave most services disabled (except
perhaps syslog, network, portmap, fam and a
few others).

FC4/RH is perhaps best suited for enterprise
servers/workstations (large memory+more CPU power),
where startup time and desktop responsiveness might
not matter the most.

For low resource constraints, there are alternatives.

CSB

acers are cheap and light - though a bit shoddily put together

ship with an antique version of linux on a 4 gb partition leaving the 
rest unpartitioned

most of the dealers will cheerfully offer to give you a pirated xp cd 
along with the laptop

anyway their service center is in a small and very bumpy, pitted road 
just behind valluvarkottam (near where all those metrowater tankers 
are parked) - if you can survive the drive there they seem quite ok.

compile with more and more gcc optimizations etc
you get a faster install but not necessarily a more stable one
careful about the tradeoff, I'd say

I might be deviating a bit but I guess it's still within the scope of
this thread..Does anyone know of any good links to show how effective
the P4/AMD64 specific optimizations (tuning, rather...they retain
compatibility) that distros like Fedora, Mandrake boast of, are. Of
late, I've been getting sceptical of these...that too, after recently
'converting' to Debian from Fedora (for the better, I still
believe)...people over here who use gentoo...is it really worthwhile
to go for a fully compiled setup at the cost of easy package
upgradation (by easy, I mean the time involved, I know it just takes
an emerge sync on gentoo)

it moves on...

On my P4 3 GHZ, 256 RAM system FC4 doesnt exhibit any performance issues 
into GNOME. Let me try dumbing down the GHZ value

Fedora isnt really targeted at any specific market.  There is a lot of 
desktop related work happening there too. GTK, Dbus, HAL, NetworkManager 
and so on.

Are you talking about compiler flags?.  This is recurring topic in 
Fedora-devel list

http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/release-notes/fc4/#id2497259
http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2004-September/msg01068.html

Benchmarks show that performance optimization at the compiler level  
beyond this point doesnt have any significant effect on this system 
while losing out compatibility with several class of processors and 
potentially introducing subtle bugs into the system due to the way GCC 
code optimization heuristics works. If there are speed differences 
between distributions, compiler flags arent really the answer

Yes. Its a step in the right direction. But I feel
there's still a long way to go before Fedora grows
up to be aesthetically pleasing desktop. I've been
more impressed with SuSE Personal Desktop, Mandriva,
SimplyMEPIS, Xandros and Ubuntu for desktop usage.
I've found it easier to introduce a newbie desktop
user onto any of the above mentioned distros than FC.

I've also found Slackware to be the best bet for
lean servers (old 486/Pentium machines with 32 MB RAM configured as a  
firewall/router). Fedora must improve
on this front too (lean resource/disk-space
requirements for minimal installation servers). There
are these old machines still lurking around with
520 MB hard disks and FC4 simply wont install on them
while Slackware 10.1 and Debian Sarge does so, without
problems.

I would agree with that. A large amount of work has been happening on 
the underlying frameworks rather than on end user polish. A couple of 
people are working on improving that.  I personally stick with the stock 
GNOME look in FC4/rawhide box but stuff like themes are largely 
subjective taste

Apples and Oranges - AFAIK, the Acer 5002 is the only 64-bit
notebook available in India now. No IBM Thinkpad or Dell uses an
AMD 64 CPU, so they're stuck at 32-bit for the foreseeable future.

All Thinkpads are now sourced from Lenovo - the much-vaunted
sturdiness is probably a thing of the past. The last Thinkpad which
was both sturdy and reliable was the 1996 Thinkpad 760xl, from 1996.
Present-day Thinkpad batteries seem to fail in less than a year, 
while the original battery from my 760xl is still chugging along at nearly
full capacity after 10 years.

Incidentally, I inspected an Acer 3002 (32-bit predecessor of the 5002)
closely, and the build quality was comparable to the Lenovo-built TP R50e.
In fact, the hinges were sturdier on the Acer than the Thinkpad.
My main complaint is that Acer chose an SiS chipset with UMA instead
of going with separate AGP graphics, for both the 3002 and 5002. I 
detest integrated shared-memory graphics - it rates only slightly better
than Winmodems and Rambus on a list of crappy hardware ideas foisted
by marketroids.

I think somebody should bell the cat, and at least check if Knoppix or
similar boots cleanly on the Acer 5002.

Hi People

I installed Fedora Core 4 yesterday on my machine which has 256 MB RAM and a
Celeron 1.7 Ghz Processor and i would say that its really good when compared
to Fedora Core 3 in terms of speed. Its really faster than FC3 but i faced a
problem in Fedora Core 4 with regards to Xorg. i.e. what happened was when
the X-Server is running and when i press Ctrl + Alt + F1 i just got a blank
screen and i was unable to access any of the terminals from F1-F6 and then i
tried searching it in Bugzilla and came to know that its a known bug so i
had to replace the file libvgahw.a with FC3's libvgahw.a and the problem got
solved.

People who are facing this problem could check out this
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=161242


Other than this i would say Fedora Core 4 is a real good distro..

Almost every notebook available in India comes with integrated
graphics with shared mem with very few exceptions. Of the Acer models
TM4002WLCi and TM4601WLMi come with discrete AGP (ATI Mobility Radeon
X700 with 64MB RAM).  They cost 65K and 72K respectively including a
copy of Win XP Pro. I wrote to Acer and got a response saying TM4601
is also available with Linux OS. Am waiting for the dealer to send me
the price of this. In other brands any model with a discrete AGP is
abv 1 lakh.

Interestingly, another Acer model, Aspire 5500 series (with abv
mentioned graphics card) and almost similar config is available in
Thailand for 50K INR (linux OS)! Considering that it costs just 14K
for a return ticket to Bangkok one can get a notebook and a holiday in
Bangkok for the same price :-)

You should permit the samba client to edit the file. You can configure
it in /etc/samba/smb.conf. You should set 'writable = yes' or
something alike. Dig into it for further details.

Hello there!
Ive written a doc, on writing Language Bindings for 
GNU Octave, and posted it here:
http://octave-gtk.sf.net/LanguageBindings/

You can download the example code, and whole document
from
http://octave-gtk.sf.net/LanguageBindings/LanguageBindings.tgz

Well, for the curious, all it takes is a click of a
button, to start building your Octave Ecosystem, on
the GNU/Linux platform, etc.

Flames and Feedback to yours truly.

my 2 cents,
Cheers

Well, as far as I know, it never happened. Must be LinuxAsia, because 
they're the ones who charge mega-bucks to attend some specialized tracks 
(like sysadmin tracks et al) so they can afford to add that glitter. 
Speakers at Linux-Bangalore bring their own laptops and whatever 
material they need. Only the net connectivity, projector & hall are 
provided by the organizers. They have a pretty strict talk-proposal 
screening system.

Linux-Bangalore is not permitted to be commercial and deliberately so - 
the sponsor/vendor stalls at the event are forbidden from selling 
anything because it attracts commercial tax and lot of hassles for the 
organizers. All hand-outs are free (CDs, stickers, t-shirts, etc). And, 
I can assure you that there are very, very few girls ;-) That too, when 
some company sends in its whole workforce in a bus or something.

BangLinux was a sponsored event - by Wrox Publishers, if I'm not wrong. 
It no longer exists. Linux-Bangalore is a different event, conducted by 
the Bangalore Linux community. Sorry if I sound like some canvasser for 
the event, but this is one of the few decent events we have, and we 
cannot let it die due to apathy from the community. Apart from some 
minor goof-ups (like late handing of delegate kits) it's a pretty 
well-organized,  enjoyable event (hey, you get a free t-shirt too!).

Vamsee.

i think u would have got this problem after reinstalling ur OS keeping ur 
/home partition intact. I faced the same problem when I did that. If yes, 
just delete all those hidden files from root and also delete the user and 
recreate the user with /home/babu as the home directory. This time all those 
files will be created again and you wont have any problem. In any case I 
think this should work.

Apples and Oranges - AFAIK, the Acer 5002 is the only 64-bit
notebook available in India now. No IBM Thinkpad or Dell uses an
AMD 64 CPU, so they're stuck at 32-bit for the foreseeable future.

All Thinkpads are now sourced from Lenovo - the much-vaunted
sturdiness is probably a thing of the past. The last Thinkpad which
was both sturdy and reliable was the 1996 Thinkpad 760xl, from 1996.
Present-day Thinkpad batteries seem to fail in less than a year, 
while the original battery from my 760xl is still chugging along at nearly
full capacity after 10 years.

Incidentally, I inspected an Acer 3002 (32-bit predecessor of the 5002)
closely, and the build quality was comparable to the Lenovo-built TP R50e.
In fact, the hinges were sturdier on the Acer than the Thinkpad.
My main complaint is that Acer chose an SiS chipset with UMA instead
of going with separate AGP graphics, for both the 3002 and 5002. I 
detest integrated shared-memory graphics - it rates only slightly better
than Winmodems and Rambus on a list of crappy hardware ideas foisted
by marketroids.

I think somebody should bell the cat, and at least check if Knoppix or
similar boots cleanly on the Acer 5002.

Hi People

I installed Fedora Core 4 yesterday on my machine which has 256 MB RAM and a
Celeron 1.7 Ghz Processor and i would say that its really good when compared
to Fedora Core 3 in terms of speed. Its really faster than FC3 but i faced a
problem in Fedora Core 4 with regards to Xorg. i.e. what happened was when
the X-Server is running and when i press Ctrl + Alt + F1 i just got a blank
screen and i was unable to access any of the terminals from F1-F6 and then i
tried searching it in Bugzilla and came to know that its a known bug so i
had to replace the file libvgahw.a with FC3's libvgahw.a and the problem got
solved.

People who are facing this problem could check out this
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=161242


Other than this i would say Fedora Core 4 is a real good distro..

Almost every notebook available in India comes with integrated
graphics with shared mem with very few exceptions. Of the Acer models
TM4002WLCi and TM4601WLMi come with discrete AGP (ATI Mobility Radeon
X700 with 64MB RAM).  They cost 65K and 72K respectively including a
copy of Win XP Pro. I wrote to Acer and got a response saying TM4601
is also available with Linux OS. Am waiting for the dealer to send me
the price of this. In other brands any model with a discrete AGP is
abv 1 lakh.

Interestingly, another Acer model, Aspire 5500 series (with abv
mentioned graphics card) and almost similar config is available in
Thailand for 50K INR (linux OS)! Considering that it costs just 14K
for a return ticket to Bangkok one can get a notebook and a holiday in
Bangkok for the same price :-)

You should permit the samba client to edit the file. You can configure
it in /etc/samba/smb.conf. You should set 'writable = yes' or
something alike. Dig into it for further details.

Present-day = from which year/month?

My IBM T41 is now 1 1/2 years old and batteries run
great. She is a sturdy laptop considering it has
travelled a lot in the US, and to different places in
Tamil Nadu.

that's frightening...I had got an Acer 3002NLC two months back...no
probs as of now except for the battery...i blame it on AMD more than
Acer...(well..it was not totally unexpected...i traded it off for the
speed coz i did not expect it to be used too much on battery)...they
had a screwed up ACPI DSDT which filled up my syslogs...but I got that
fixed...

There is one problem...Operations needing disk accesses tend to go a
bit slow at times...but I don't know if that's due to hardware, or my
kernel...like taking a second for an first time ls...could be due to
hardware, power management or even reiserfs....If anyone knows of a
similar situation, do tell me...

Well, as of now, just hoping that Shakthi was wrong... :)

it moves on...

Compile and install the cko patchset (-ck + -ac + a whole lot of other 
stuff) .. google will find it for you

My acer runs far better with that, I'd say - it also has vesafb-tng 
which I find really useful

Perl has in built in place text replacement facility:

$ find <folder> -type f -print0 | \
xargs perl -pi -e 's/<find>/<replace>/g'

If you need a backup of the files with name .bak use
$ find <folder> -type f -print0 | \
xargs perl -pi.bak -e 's/<find>/<replace>/g'

Goofed it up. I did not notice the print0 in the find command. -0 of
xargs and -print0 of find go hand in hand, I learnt from the xargs man
page.

i use 2.6.12rc3 with 2.6.11-ck8 and inotify...using 66 for mapped
watermark...i don't know much about -ac patches....what do they
generally address ? when I compiled last, -cko was slightly lagging
behind the vanilla, and so I decided to go with the above
configuration...may be I should recompile and check with the
2.6.12-cko...

just wondering if swsusp could be a problem...

it moves on...

if you dont need swsusp dont use it

definitely setup acpid, then cpufreqd

then laptop_mode (install the laptop_mode_tools package - google for it)

build a modular enough kernel

do all this and it should work quite smoothly for you

Message-ID: <495e4512050713022646feee63@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
       I have been using fc3 for a long time b4 i upgraded to fc4.
Ever since i upgraded to fc4 i have been unable to connect to the
internet. I have configured my broadband(BSNL's Dataone) connection to
start up during bootup. During bootup i get the message "Bringing up
ppp0 [ok]". Even in network system configuration shows ppp0 to be
active. By i am not able to  browse with firefox or mozilla or lynx.
During bootup there is a message that "Bringing up interface eth0
[failed]". But this has been the message even during FC3, but then i
was able to browse the web. Its able to connect to the internet from
the windows on the same machine. Mine is a Pentium III 500 MHz
machine.

Thank you,

with regards,
ashwin.

> if you dont need swsusp dont use it

well, I do need it...as a matter of fact, I am starting to forget that
there is something called shutdown...even my ACPI PWR button is bound
to suspend...may be I should try Software Suspend 2 and check if that
was the problem...one thing for sure...may be it is not a culprit, but
it atleast triggers those long delays...because all your cache gets
out on suspend...

> definitely setup acpid, then cpufreqd

acpid is set...and yeah...that reminds me of one more problem with
acer...I guess I should tell this for the potential Acer customers
here...the reason i don't use cpufreqd...whenever the cpu frequency
changes and I am in X, there seems to be a temporary freeze...I had
posted in cpufreq regarding this
(http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cpufreq/2941, see the
thread in http://news.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cpufreq ... it's in
the first page)...and it turned out that it is probably a motherboard
problem (mine is Acer Aspire 3002NLC, may be other models are better
off)...so I guess Riyaz should keep this in mind...Anyway, I am
doubtful if cpufreq should affect the problem I have...

> then laptop_mode (install the laptop_mode_tools package - google for it)

done already...

it moves on...

Is there any reason you want to implement the functionality yourself?
Though I have'nt used it the rdiff-backup package seems to be doing
just what you need.

And did you try googling before asking? I did, before answering and a
search like http://www.google.com/search?q=incremental+backups+linux
gave a lot of relevant info.

Daemons would generally log the messages in /var/log/messages. See if 
there are AVC denied messages in /var/log/audit.log as specified in 
http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/release-notes/fc4/#sn-audit-daemon. If so 
the SELinux policies might be preventing DHCP access if you using it. 
You can set disable SELinux protection for DHCP in 
system-config-securitylevel or set SELinux itself to permissive to check 
this issue

Message-ID: <c24555040507130515160e3d05@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
Consider the followinf situation:

One server and several clients connecting to it. All these clients
will typically access the server for VNC. Communication on this LAN is
only between clients and the server. There is no inter-client
communication as such like on normal LANs.

What I now need to do is to encrypt IP traffic between the server and
the clients. I tried out IPSec (openswan), but that does not seem to
be the solution since its most natural use is creation of tunnels
between two gateways(with a network behind them). Here I want to
encrypt IP traffic between two hosts that are directly connected.

Are there any other suggestions on this regard?
TIA.

Problem fixed. The account had been disabled in the
server! 

The guy in our area exchange, Mr. Subramani, is a very
nice guy, very hardworking too. 

I told him that I got the message "CHAP authentication
failed: The account has expired" and he said I
re-check the password. He apparently had tried
connecting from a windoze machine from the exchange
and he said he got some 691 error or something that
said "please check your password"! WTF. What has
account termination got to do with incorrect password?

When he checked with the server, somehow the account
had been disabled. He then asked them to reset it and
informs me that I was correct, what pppoe in GNU/Linux
said was absolutely correct. He is now eager to learn
to setup pppoe on GNU/Linux for better
troubleshooting!

SK

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0507132041340.869-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

International Open Source Network (IOSN) is released a detailed FOSS
Localization Guide to assists people in localizing FOSS applications.
URL: http://www.iosn.net/l10n/localization-guide/ (Thanks MadhanRaj)

One Day One Command 
===================

setfont -- Load EGA/VGA console screen font.

Summary:

The setfont command reads a font file and loads it into the EGA/VGA
character generator and optionally outputs the previous font.  It can
also load various mapping tables and output the previous versions. The
standard Linux font format is the PSF (PC Screen Format) font.

Examples:

$ setfont -- Load the default font.

$ setfont -v -- Load the default font with verbose output.

$ setfont iso01.14 -- Load the iso01 font (size=8x14).

/lib/kbd/consolefonts - Default Dir for console fonts.
/lib/kbd/unimaps      - Default Dir for Unicode maps.
/lib/kbd/consoletrans - Default Dir for screen mappings.
Read the ReadMe files available in the above locations to get more 
information about the font and maps.

TIP: Set your default console font in /etc/sysconfig/i18n file.

Read: man setfont

Well, I've been having trouble over the past two days too - it would
connect only after repeatedly trying to connect over a period of 45
minutes to an Hour... Today also, I managed to connect only after an
hour or so... When I spoke to a guy in the telephone exchange, he did
mention that their servers were getting overloaded now and then and
that it may not connect because of that... I however dont see any
proper error messages since the actual dialling is done by my router -
which only says - 'Unable to Connect to the Server'...  I should
probably look around for more detailed logs or some such on my
router's web interface...

IPSec can be configured for securing p2p links. Tunneling is just one
of IPSec's applications.

Hi,

    I have tried GPRS from both Airtel and BSNL. Now using DIAS from
BSNL and have plans to get Rconnect card or Rconnect through Reliance
postpaid phone.

    Anyone has any issues with the above mentioned two?  In terms of
stability, speed and compatibility with Linux.

    Yeah, I saw Airtel's ad today about their data-card. Its worthless
given the fact that I am not in a city - I would get only GPRS through
it.

Thank you.

SOP on account termination is usually to reset the password to

Acer will just be proud that its foot-soldiers are doing their job and
doing it well.

No. I want to complain to Acer's marketing department about the 
unethical marketing practices of their dealers

That has worked before, and it will work again

redhat 9 will not automount windows partition. You need to do it
manualy e.g. Mandrake will do this.

first create a suitable directory like /mnt/windows_c or any other
place you want.

mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows_c 

where /dev/hda1 is your C drive hda2 is D etc.

Look at man mount for more information.

Similaryly redhat 9 will not auto mount cds.First right click on
icon,
select mount and then try to access with double click.

Hello friends !
  I have done few changes in kde (mandrake 9.2) menu editor . After that kde 
functions goes wrong.
After restart i lost the kde. 
I find that because of space ( log files) i lost kde . 
I delete all unwanted logs.
but before that i delete the .kde files(i think this is the mistake done by 
me).
 Now i got the login prompt in gui but i cant able to login.
How to recover my kde?
is there any simple way? 
 If reinstall the kde is only way , how can i reinstall?
(i tried to install all the *kde* files from mandrake cds but it
 creates dependency problems.)
 Expecting ur solutions..

He just picked the wrong guy :-) It was I who was expecting a quote
from an Acer dealer in Chennai but he seems to have sent it to a
couple of people who are not interested. Anyway, thanks, Suresh, for
posting the said spam on this list. Now I know the price of a linux
version of TM4600.

ex delhi and with their version of octroi etc :)

i'd suggest going across to thailand as somebody else suggested - cheap 
air tickets, visa on arrival (1000 baht is like rs.1100, and airport tax 
of 500 baht on departure - 550 rupees).  Cheap hotels.  Great city.

And real cheap laptops (15..20k cheaper).

If you are looking for perfection:

There is no perfect encryption technique, till date. There are only
alternatives that seem to be better in today's computing environment.

IPSec uses one such alternative, and is good enough in my opinion.

Thanks to all for the time.
I'll try out openvpn. That seems to support a number of configurations
and will also research the p2p configs of openswan IPSec
implementation.

Be very happy. The last time I counted, thunderbird was eating around 
113MB of my RAM and firefox another 150MB! (I think it depends on the 
number of tabs open).

Try sylpheed if you are looking for a lean e-mail
client. Better yet, try mutt+range of helper tools
on the command line if you need an email client on
steroids.

Hi,

I find that when gmail is open, and it is trying to load something, or
it is refreshing the main inbox page, firefox takes up a steady 10 to
20% CPU. This seems to be noticeable only when the connection goes
down half way through the refresh and the refresh does not complete -
and hence the browser gets stuck permanently trying to refresh.
Perhaps its polling the socket or something during the XMLHTTP call?
Usually pressing the stop button and refreshing manually fixes the
problem... Its not too serious a problem considering that only 10 to
20% CPU is used up... atleast not much for a desktop user...

well, that link should be changed. aero.iitm.ernet.in is depracated and it 
should really be ae.iitm.ac.in; the old ernet name might work on and off, 
depending on the phase of the moon and such other variables.

There is no such thing called a "podder software".
You need to create normal mp3's and create XML enclosures for them and
have a RSS feed available online.

I suggest you first just create normal ogg/mp3 files and make it
available online(chennailug.org?)

We can implement the RSS feed in time.

Greetings!

I have received the transcript of the documentary
movie, "Revolution OS". The director, J. T. S. Moore,
has agreed for translations of the script, so the
movie can be used to reach out to a lot more people in
India. 

I do have a .pdf (131 KB) of the transcript. If anyone
is interested in doing a translation to any regional
language, tamil, malayalam, kannada, telugu, hindi,
marathi, bengali, or any other ... do let me know. 

Localization will help us reach every nook and corner
of our country.

Hello Sakthi,

Can i give a try and i will devote 6 days on it. I am interested in this area

Localiazation.

 I have translated a part of ESR's work "The cathedral and the bazzar"
in the tamil magazine "TAMIZH COMPUTER".The article was translated  by
me in tamil  and it was been edited by my editor "Mr. KA KA
JAYAKRISHNAN", finally we got a fair a good shape to that article. It
was a collective effort.

if you send me that copy, I can sincerely give a try to that project.


The problem with the Movie code is that i was not able to get a
confirmation from them. Though it is a CC copyright i am not sure in
am i entitled to translate on that movie .
I wrote a email but i have received a mail in a NON ENGLISH version
from the creator of that movie.



Cheers

Thyagarajan.S

BSNL has already started thinking about it and I believe we'll get it soon. The only thing that you can expect when you are doing business with BSNL is, you'll never get cheated. but as far as I know, it is not the case with the private cos.

   I don't dispute that udev, etc., are the way to go for the future. 
However, there are certain applications for which I prefer a static
/dev tree. Why do this? Some possible reasons:

1) Smaller memory footprint, better stability and performance - YMMV.
2) Dependencies from an old userland that require a static /dev/tree,
    for instance, Cryptoloop implementations that expect to find certain
    /dev/loop* entries.
3) For easy filesystem recovery using non-udev recovery CDs.
4) For kernel experimentation.
 
 On FC3, it is possible to downgrade to a static /dev tree without
breaking most of userland. YMMV - as always, perform a backup
before trying this out. You may have other dependencies
which I did not encounter:

1) Rebuild (from SRPM) and install the following RPMs (Google and obtain
them from previous Fedora/RedHat releases):

kudzu-1.1.36.3-1
kudzu-devel-1.1.36.3-1
hotplug_2004_04_01-1.1
hwdata-0.103.1-1

2) Downgrade to gnome-vfs2-2.6.0-8 (again, rebuild from SRPM):

# you can rebuild these later
rpm -e eel2 eog gedit

rpm -Uvh --oldpackage gnome-vfs2-2.6.0-8.386.rpm
     gnome-vfs2-devel-2.6.0-8,i386.rpm
     gnome-vfs2-smb-2.6.0-8.i386.rpm

3) Get rid of hal and udev:

rpm -e hal

# (stop udev)
rpm -e udev --nodeps

# reboot
rpm -Uvh --oldpackage dev-3.3.12.3-1.i386.rpm MAKEDEV-3.3.8-2.i386.rpm
# ignore lots of warnings

4) Adjust /etc/fstab and verify that everything still works OK.

Voila! You have an FC3 installation with a static /dev tree now.

(The main reason that I jumped through all these hoops was to downgrade
to a patched version of util-linux-2.11y-29 from FC1, which I needed to 
support Loop-Crypto using CryptoAPI transparently. )

Take it to the udev list. The assumption there is that there is zero use 
cases for a static /dev tree. You will notice that none of the 
distributions will support this in the near future.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] OpenLDAP + TLS
Message-ID: <MTEyMTQyNjM2Ny5tdXRodQ.1121426367@dissimulo.com>

Hello All:

 An year ago I had setup an OpenLDAP server and the server was basically
used as a centralized user management and as an authentication server for
the GNU/Linux and Sun Solaris boxes. While setting up the server I had
created a CA Certificate in the server for the purpose of using TLS/SSL
for communication between the server and the client. The certificate got
expired and I had created a new one (In the server) and replaced the old
one. But when I try to authenticate using one of the client (RedHat AS
2.1), I am getting "Access Denied" message. If I log into the client as
ROOT (The ROOT account is still in the "/etc/passwd" file) and execute
the "/usr/sbin/authconfig" command and remove the TLS option, then the
authentication works. The question is "Do I have to do any changes in the
client side for the TLS to work?". When setting up the client for the
first time (i.e. an year ago), I did not do any change on the client
machine except running the "authconfig" command and entering the relevant
details. Any suggestions or pointers would be appreciated. Thank You.

You probably need to regenerate all the client certificates from this new CA.

This is why you should use CAs that have lifetime of 10-20 years :)

Enable 'sound' and 'alsa' service for
your current runlevel. You could try
the following commands as root user on
the console/terminal:
  ln -s /etc/init.d/sound /etc/rc0.d/K69sound
  ln -s /etc/init.d/sound /etc/rc6.d/K69sound
  ln -s /etc/init.d/sound /etc/rc3.d/S18sound
  ln -s /etc/init.d/sound /etc/rc5.d/S18sound

  ln -s /etc/init.d/alsa /etc/rc0.d/K70alsa
  ln -s /etc/init.d/alsa /etc/rc6.d/K70alsa
  ln -s /etc/init.d/sound /etc/rc3.d/S17alsa
  ln -s /etc/init.d/sound /etc/rc5.d/S17alsa

Alternatively, there should be some gui-tool
on Mandrake that lets you automate this task
(enabling/disabling via checkbox).

Hope this solves the problem.

The most common possible reason is probably you forgot your root password.

Nope. Because we plan our work well in advance, we
can't inform people in such a short notice. 

Maybe next weekend? We'll need to check the

1. username 'root' may not exist.
2. password could have been changed.
3. securetty has incorrect/inappropriate entry.
4. one of the .dot files could have been 'hacked' by naughty users to
have logout or exit.
5. the passwd entry could have had an invalid shell


A dozen other reasons. Research a bit. Be a bit more clear. Provide us
error messages/log files.

Are you trying to telnet into the server? root logins on telnet
sessions are normally dis-allowed.

FWIW, one of the companies that builds Simputers (Vinay Deshpande's
Encore Computers) is also behind the Mobilis design, and I wouldn't
be surprised if it shared a common platform with the Simputer - AFAIK,
Mobilis is not x86-based, and does not have a hard disk. It's more like
a mobile thin-client or POS-terminal, aimed at industry verticals like
logistics, freight/package handling, etc. It's not a general-purpose, 
PC-architecture laptop.

If you want a general-purpose x86 laptop, there isn't a better deal than
the Acer Travelmate 2355 for Rs.27500 today - it's a very nice almost
fully-loaded 1.4 GHz Dothan Celeron M. If it's in a socket, there's no
reason it can't be upgraded to a Pentium M at 2 GHz or higher (the
Celeron M and the Pentium M are pin-compatible).

$showmount -e 
Export list for openplm_pc03:

Subject: [Ilugc] Partition plans
Message-ID: <42D8CFC4.3070403@gmail.com>

I have a 80G  hard disk and would like to set  up a multi boot system,
including FC4, Ubuntu, Mepis and keep some space free for others too.

What would be a neat and tidy partition plan?

The partitions used now are:
Filesystem             Size   Used  Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda1               66G    15G    48G  24% /mnt/hda1     =>Ubuntu
/dev/hda2               13G   8.1G   4.0G  68% /             =>FC4
/dev/shm                98M      0    98M   0% /dev/shm

FC4 / looks like this:
bin   dev  home  lost+found  misc  net  proc  sbin     srv  tftpboot  usr
boot  etc  lib   media       mnt   opt  root  selinux  sys  tmp       var

and Ubuntu /:
bin   cdrom  etc   initrd  lib32  lost+found  mnt   proc sbin  sys  
ubuntu386  
var   boot  dev    home  lib      lib64       media opt  root  srv  
tmp   usr

/etc, /bin, /sbin, /lib*, and /dev* and other os specific dirs are not
shareable across  the os'es,  and probably anything  from 1GB  to 12GB
could be set aside for each os.  What is the best plan for the others?

Partition   Size   Type             Mountpoint          Bootable
----------------------------------------------------------------
/dev/hda1     20MB  43 (PReP Boot)     (Not mounted)    yes
/dev/hda2    133MB  82 (Linux Swap)    (Not mounted)     -
/dev/hda3     ??GB  83 (Linux ext2)  / (Root partition)  -
/dev/hda4     ??GB  83 (Linux ext2)  /home               -
/dev/hda5     ??GB  83 (Linux ext2)  /usr/local
              ??                     ??

Thanks,
Ramanraj.

The directory /var/log/audit/ is empty. I think AVC is denied (from
dmesg cmd.) . dmesg cmd. throughs out a lot of text. Here i would like
to qoute the message thats in regards to the SElinux:

......
Security framework v1.0.0 initialised
SELinux: Initialising
SELinux: Starting in permissive mode
selinux_register_security: Registering secondary module capability
......
SELinux : Registering netfilter hooks

( and lots of lines like  this )

I think SElinux is diabled, thats what /etc/selinux/config tells.

It says:
(many comment lines)
SELINUX=Disabled
 (many comment lines)
SELINUX=targeted

i tried #setsebool dhcp_disable_trans=1
it returned "setsebool: SELinux is diabled"


Thank you,

If you are using redhat then change it in /etc/sysconfig/network there will 
be a parameter called
HOSTNAME=<yourhostname>

# etc/hostname and #etc/hosts but it didn't work.

Carrier? I thought you wanted help on ISP or backbone related stuff.

Anyway, all the best in your career. Hope you get a job soon. Look for
job sites on the Internet.

I also suggest you try using the spell checker in your MUA before
sending e-mails; especially when on the lokout for jobs. It sure helps
at times.

Yes, that is sufficient if you want the changes made temporarily. Just
make sure the services are restarted to see the effects of changes.
Simplest way is to just press Control-D (logout).

To make the changes permanent look for distribution specific
configuration files where 'HOSTNAME' or 'hostname' variables are
defined.

Running out of file handles? What is your kernel version? 2.4.X? Or
older? Upgrade!

But also try removing rmtab file, if you think it is not risky.
hint: are any other users using nfs now? risky = !your_answer

If you are running an RHL box you need to edit /etc/sysconfig/network file.
Add HOSTNAME=yourhostname

Contradictory requirements. But anyway, Redhat is better when it comes
to recognition worldwide.

Don't expect them to teach you. It almost never works that way. Be it
RHCE or any other course for that matter. Rely on good books and
online help.

Best regards.

Spell check wouldn't help. "Carrier" and "Career" both are right 
spelling...its the usage that is wrong. 

Having said that, please take the usage of right language seriously (avoid 
careless mistakes), as it might over shadow your good technical capability.

To change the hostname edit the following file /etc/sysconfig/network.
This file contains the hostname entry change it to suit your needs.

Yep, it certainly would. And which spellchecker did you say passed "lokout"?

For RHCE, The Chennai STG near anadh theather is best for teaching as
well as taking the test. It is one of the considerable cheap center
for test and teaching.

There are other Certain Exams like LPI Ceritifcations which is simple
and cost less exams. also famous in Eroupe.

Thanks and Regards,

Greetings!

I would like to thank the Tiruchirapalli MYSQL group
and CSE department faculty, students, and the
management of Saranathan College of Engineering,
Tiruchirapalli for giving me an opportunity to conduct
a one-day GNU/Linux workshop.

Thanks to Ramkumar L, S. Srinivasan, T. Shivakumar,
Arul Jeeva, and Lakshminarayanan of Tiruchirapalli
MYSQL group, http://www.harshainfotech.com/, and
http://www.rajaramsystems.com/. 

http://mysql.meetup.com/70/

Special thanks to Ramkumar L who has been working with
me in planning this event for the past two weeks.
Thanks to Prof. Venkatasubramanian, HOD, CSE
Department, Saranathan College of Engineering for
coordinating the sessions.

http://www.saranathan.ac.in/

The workshop was announced in the newspapers, The
Indian Express and The Hindu. The photos of the
workshop (and the trip) can be viewed from here:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album12

The MYSQL group is working on using LAMP on GNU/Linux
for the Pulivazham village cooperative society milk
center farmers. They require to keep track of
accounts, volume of milk stored in the facilities, and
general book-keeping activities. 

Ramkumar L: Regarding the contacts:

1. Sarvannan (Lucas-TVS) - told me during Raman's talk
on LTSP that they supply Linux drivers for their
printers. So, Pulivazham center printers should work
with GNU/Linux.

2. Gaurav - from http://www.gnulinuxclub.org is
interested in php, web admin. He should start building
a database of companies working/using LAMP in India
for career opportunities. You can let him know of
harshainfotech.com and your services.

3. Sivasankar Chander - told me at MIT, "Carte
Blanche" 2005 about 'Cascade Systems & Solutions',
Plaza center near Gemini circle, about HP E-Vectra
systems that are about Rs.5000/-. He runs FC on it.
So, for low-cost solutions, you might want to check
this out.

4. Bharathi S - and other networking gurus, might
provide some contacts/tips on line-of-sight solutions
for networking all the villages together. Folks, right
now they have a dial-up offer from BSNL at Rs.25/- per
hour :o.

Good luck to the Tiruchirapalli MYSQL team for this
project. Hopefully next time when we visit you guyz,
we will see Pulivazham farmers using GNU/Linux for
their day-to-day activities.

Thanking you all once again,

SK

How? What is your network setup?

> I/P :192.168.26.5

How is that dishnet is giving you a private IP
address?

GUI: Use YaST
Command line: Use "ifconfig" (as root)

# ifconfig eth0 192.168.26.5 netmask 230.230.230.0
gateway 192.168.90.5 

In your /etc/resolv.conf you can add your DNS servers
like this:

nameserver    202.90.230.9
nameserver    202.90.250.7

Post the output of:

/sbin/lsmod
/sbin/ifconfig -a
/sbin/route -n

Hi,

Have someone configured sender based routing in postfix with SMTP client
authentication ?
I have configured an intranet mail server in which the mails do not get
relayed since the
internet server authenticates based on the sender mail address.
If yes, pls let me know the config ...

Thanks,

I second him. Dont really expect people to teach you stuff like system
administration, Its really hands on time that helps. Thats also the
reason why people with Linux knowledge command so much respect - there
is no other way but to learn it yourself. At least as of now.

Please see if http://www.hserus.net/postfix.html doesnt help you here

But just trusting the from address as a means to relay cant be called 
authentication ..

Hi,

The link is useful if all the mail id's have common authentication,
but it does not help when each mail id's are validated same as
their POP3 user accounts.

I am planning to take RHCE at STG within a week..
I heard it was the best in chennai.

Rs 13200 for the course
we have an option of 3 months(2hr per day) or 2 months(3hr per day).

Rs 10000 for the exam. so total is around 23000..

they promise 96hrs of classes(all practical)
i do not know how they will make it to go to 3 months..

u do not have to write the exam immedietly after the course..
u can take ur own time..
but if u fail, Rs 10,000 is gone with the wind..

u should pay another 10,000 to write the exam again..

certification is current for 2 releases of RHEL
that is around 3 years from Feb 2005 if u write in RHEL 4.

if u are new to linux/unix, 96 hrs will help you cover only the basics. 
IMHO i do not think a newbie will be ready for RHCE just after
96 hrs of teaching..u can just get ur feet wet in 96 hrs.

if u are confortable with basics then go ahead..
if not, take a couple of months to learn RH linux.
once u learn the basics u will atleast be able to grasp what the tutor
means to say.


As far as teaching goes I guess it all depends on the person teaching
you.. if he is well versed, u should be ready to extract information
from him. not every one who knows unix is as nice as the people in this
forum. i know some unix/solaris/linux admins who never open their mouth
to share their knowledge.. they guard it as if it is their family secret.

a lot of people think LINUX = REDHAT. and lot of them happen to be
in the HR dept of some big companies.. So RHCE will work better than 
other linux certfications in India as far as employment is concerned.

If u plan to write the exam without training..
check out these links.

https://www.redhat.com/apps/training/assess/faq.html
https://www.redhat.com/apps/training/assess/

redhat says

-------------
Red Hat's Pre-assessment tests help prospective course participants 
determine whether they possess the knowledge taught in particular Red 
Hat courses so they can choose the appropriate class for their level of 
skill and knowledge.
---------------

so ... good luck...

if u r interested in STG i can give u the no of the person to contact
for more details...

if any one knows abt the pass/fail percentage in RHCE exam pls let me know.

Regards
Easwaran.K.V

Personally, I think both. And together it becomes a bit too much for a 'course.'

To prove that you know Linux you could a lot more than show a
certificate. Among other things 1) Projects, 2) Publications, 3) Work
experience, etc.

Deepan!
the redhat preassessment is good.
It tests u in almost all areas of linux administration.
then it gives a report of what all u are strong in and in wat u aren't.(and 
even the level to which u know each area).
Though it asks just 3 questions in each area, i personally feel that the way 
he assesses is good and that the report he gives about you is absolutely 
true.
Cheers!

You are right my friend, i agree :). but most people who sit
on the interview panel do not seem to share our views.

They(not all) are not qualified enough to test the linux skills of
the people who apply for jobs.they are mostly gurus in java or
some MS technology like VB or ASP.

say a company is hiring linux professionals(among others). in the 
interview panel of 3 to 6 usualy only one knows unix. but all 6 ask u 
questions regarding unix..

  Work experiences speak for themselves. i do not know how valuable 
others are pertaining to interview..

One of my friends is in linux customer support in a MNC.
one day he calls me and asks "what is mounting in linux"
then went on to ask what a filesystem is.

how do you think he got the job then.. probably the person who 
interviewed him did not know any thing in linux.

there is where RHCE comes in.  I do not think one will pass
RHCE if he is just lucky without knowing much. it helps(to some level)
in  understanding(from a HR preson's perspective) our skill..

I do agree with ur points :) but do they apply(practically) in our 
country??????


by the way anybody in this list have done RHCE in STG chennai..

just wanted to know about the experiance...

I think the numbers are par for the course. Have you checked the
prices of comparable certification from others recently? Like Cisco or
Juniper or Oracle or Sun? (Microsoft doesn't count :)

The RHCE is priced at $749 (exam alone) internationally; I find the
Indian prices cheap compared to that. And given the gruelling day long
hands-on exam, it is well worth the price.

I have been hiring Linux admins recently, and I find people tend to
lie about or over-enhance their roles in the three enumerated points
above. I am inclined to trust the certification under such
circumstances. I am sure others hiring in the field think like me.

Subject: SFD 2005: Request your sponsored SFD CDs and materials!
Date: Mon, 11 Jul 2005 01:01:27 -0400
Dear SFD Team Leaders,

In 2004, SFD was successful because many of your volunteer teams around
the world burned CDs and distributed them in celebration of Free and
Open Source Software.  2005 holds new promise for Software Freedom Day
because a primary sponsor (Canonical, Ltd.) has promised to donate up
to 100 professionally pressed and packaged SFD CDs[1] to each of the
first 150 SFD teams to register and request materials!

We don't yet have the final figures, but we will also be providing
a limited number of free SFD T-shirts, SFD balloons (you'll need your
own helium) and SFD temporary tattoos for the first teams to request
materials.

There are a few criteria for teams to qualify for sponsored supplies:

* Your team must be registered on our registration form (teams from
last year, please register again).

* Your team must have set up a wiki page with at least the basic
information about members and plans. The more detail, the better.
Please provide a URL.

* You must have made an initial forum post inviting others to join your
team.  (Go to http://softwarefreedomday.org, click "Forum" at the top
of the page.)

* Your team must have at least 3 members.  (More is better.)

* You must completely fill out the request form with a valid postal
address where we can ship your materials.

These and other details are discussed on the SFD Materials Request
Form, which is on our website.  (Go to http://softwarefreedomday.org,
click on "Get Materials" in the menu on the left side.)

Approximately 191 registered team leaders are receiving this email, so
you should meet the criteria and apply for sponsorship within the next
few days to ensure that your team receives the sponsored supplies.

We're very excited about the potential we have to impact the world
with Software Freedom Day 2005, and we hope you can take advantage of
our sponsor's generous offer in order to make your celebrations even
more successful.

Regards,
Matt Oquist, Software Freedom International

TODO: Request supplies at
http://softwarefreedomday.org/index.php?option=com_mosforms&mosform=2&Itemid=62

[1] This year's SFD CDs will be TheOpenCD 3.0, which is a single-disc
combination of an x86 Ubuntu LiveCD and TheOpenCD with updated
packages.

Did you try using konqueror. Konqueror has inbuilt support for smb and a
lot of other protocols.
Just open konqueror and try smb:///

Message-ID: <1121650363.18145.238650144@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hi,

Could some one give me a hint on what kind of broadband i am using? (I
know it is tata indicom :) )

This is what ipconfig says:

Windows 2000 IP Configuration
PPP adapter ADSL Easy Dial-up:
	Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . : 
	IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 210.211.179.17
	Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.255
	Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 210.211.179.17

How can the ip address and the default gateway be the same?? i really
dont get this, but it works perfectly fine in windows.

When i look into the properties it says ISDN-BIPAC 7000 usb wan adapter.
(ISDN???)

And the phone number is 0000000.. (???)

and the type of dialup server i am calling says PPP win 95,98,NT,2000,
Internet (now i am really confused...)

I am able to get the modem to work some times in linux (i.e. i succeed
in making the adsl light glow..my definition of success..ofcourse that
didnt come easy..thats another big story all together) but i dont  know
how to dial to the server. I dont see how is can user rp-pppoe as there
is no ethernet involved. 

should i use the kppp or something :S

God help me!!..i am really getting sick of configuring these modems and
broadband connections with linux just to find out that it wont work.

:)

A great way to go is to study for rhce yourself, pass the exam

It is not rocket science, and RHCE is more like an MCSE or a CCNA, fairly easy
to pass with practice.

The best way then is for them to use the remote smtp server, in their outlook
settings, rather than use your local smtp server which then forwards the email
on .. Postfix will not do this on a per sender basis.

I believe they also have a STG modules where they provide the same core for 
some thing less around 6500 to 8000 (if you join in numbers you can also 
bring down the cost). the difference is you wont get the official Red Hat 
books and accessories (you can make a xerox if you want to).

	Chapter 3.1 to 3.6 in the attachment
Message-ID: <ed2d3c00050717223762afc4c3@mail.gmail.com>

Dear members,

I have typed a part of +1 computer science Linux syllabus from chapter
3.1 to 3.6.
I am not too sure that i breached any copy rnorms, as we cannot quote
an external material as that might be a itch in scoring marks for the
students. our teachers and evaluvator of examination will be keen in
finding word by word answer for the question instead of the content.
I hope this material might be useful for any one who wants an
electronic copy of the text book.
I will soon upload the rest of the syllabus, hopefully if i never get
into any copyright itches from tamil nadu text book corporation.

Regards

Thyagarajan.

Hi Deepan,

I suggest that you can study your self.  Heard STG is teaching well,
but if you can put little more effort and more of practise, that will
do to clear the exam.  Get some good RHCE materials and practise all
the lab exercise.

Thanks
Rajan.

Hi,

   As far as RHCE is concerned its the leading certification in linux
though you have other line LPI and Novell's.

  I think there is two options available in STG. There own certificate
and course material for the course and Second is official Redhat. If
you are so much sure of taking RHCE then with RHCE certificate no one
bothers about what course certificate you have.

   If you are planning to take up RHCE after the course in STG but
after 2-3 months you make sure that you inform the manager you will
take a break and take the Night Labs before the exam which you are
entitled to.

  Also as far as the percentage of pass there is no restriction like
only this many no. can pass and others should be failed. If you need
the percentage (marks) then see the redhat website for latest
information.

  I would also like to tell those who take up RHCE to be good with all
the excercise in the Redhat Study material as with that you will able
to around 70% of marks. This i am telling through the experience and i
got my certification in june 2004.

  Also getting 100% in RHCE is not something too hard (Believe me as i
was able to get it) if you practice well and if you are clear about
concepts and read the questions in RHCE exam properly as they wont be
straight-forward but again wont be too much twisted.

  If you are a group who is practicing for RHCE then first prepare a
method which you are going to follow to get the best result. Team work
is always good. ( we were 6 in a group when we took the exam and we
all got certified in first attempt.).

 The most important thing in our case was we made the best use of the
infrastructure available in STG. Which again you can do.

 If you have any other clarification you can mail me or call me at 98407-46415.

good to see the syllabus in +1 class.... this will surely make the
younger generations work at ease on linux.
Rather than the mindset of Windows as a standard operating system.
I should appriciate state government of tamilnadu,
in my state(A.P) Inter board, really sucks... most dirtiest period of
education in life of a student.

One Day One Command 
===================

chkconfig -- Update/Show runlevel information for system services.

Summary:

'chkconfig' provides a simple command-line tool for maintaining the
/etc/rc[0-6].d directory hierarchy by relieving system administrators
of the task of directly manipulating the numerous symbolic links in
those directories.

A runlevel is a software configuration of the system which allows only
a selected group of processes to exist (man init).

Examples:

$ chkconfig --list -- List runlevel info for all system services.

$ chkconfig --list xinetd -- List runlevel info of xinetd service.

# chkconfig --add newser -- Add a new service for management.

# chkconfig --del oldser -- Remove this services symbolic links from 
                            all rc[0-6].d Dirs.

# chkconfig --level 35 xinetd on -- Start the xinetd service only in 
                                    runlevel 3 and 5.

Read: man chkconfig

Hi,
I also had soem idea of doing RH certification. When i
was enquiring with my friends, a few suggested that i
can do it on my own if i am really interested as a lot
of books and help are available. He also adivced to
get the help of ppl who have done it. But when i
bought the book for RHCE exam it said that i need
atleast a couple of systems running RHEL while i have
only a single system with RH9. Though i can get RHEL
or follow other methods prescribed when we dotn find
RHEL, but without another system i am not able to
practixe networking with mine. 
And also thee statistics say that the pass rate of 1st
timers is very low, infact the overall pass% itself is
only around 40%.

On debian,  there is  no chkconfig. Instead  one uses  the update-rc.d

rcconf on Debian is more close to chkconfig.

Please tell the following:

1. kernel version.
2. Identify NIC, with it's type, name, and version information.
3. Did you do anything like update kernel/module?
4. How is the network like? Quite large number of simultaneous users?

Hi!

    I was trying to install debian through the net-inst cd. I
installed it fine.  But kde and gnome are not getting installed.  And
so are some others like gedit.  The contrib and non-free folder in
 
 ftp.iitm.ac.in/debian/dists/testing
 
    is missing. Could this be a reason.

use apt-setup and configure the debian repository from iitm or from

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0507191059370.11105-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

Hi,

Red Hat has an opening for a Technical Translator for Tamil to be
based out of Pune.

The profile includes translation, development and editing of content
for software localisation, paper, multimedia or web-based
publications. Further on it also includes translation of message
catalogs into the native language for Red Hat and other selected Open
Source software. Participation in Quality Assurance activities
focussed on i18n and l10n are also an important job function. It also
includes carrying forward the existing corpus of work and adding to it
through best practices and community interaction.

Exposure to the local language, language standards, computing inputs
and prior experience of l10n would be an advantage.

Those interested may send in the CV in OpenOffice.org/HTML/ASCII text
format to sankar@redhat.com with [Technical Translator - Tamil] in the
subject line.

Hi!

  http://developer.kde.org/development-versions/kde-4.0-features.html

   Not much news in that slashdot link. But thought I would put it anyway. 
   Here's a mirror to a screenshot of Plasma. It took quite sometime
with the connection at IITM. So be careful before you click below.

    I hope KDE4 is not like as shown above. It's already too much of a
memory hog. I just couldn't work on it in my Celeron 633 MHz with
256MB RAM. Each application taking 15-20 seconds to load.

    The simplekde server seems to have crashed. From what I read the
KDE team has forked (unofficial)

   Its happy many are interested in doing certification. At the same
time what your friend said will work out if you can spend time
dedicated to practicing linux and there is someone who can help you
everytime you have a problem and most important teach you the basics.

It is true you need a network to practice as you need to simulate
certain senarios which might need atleast 2-3 systems.

   Can you please tell me where you got these statistics. Also never
believe in statistics fully as it depends on the persons who have
taken the statistics. Also if it is for the total amount who took up
the exam them you should also consider the practice the candidate
would have had.
   Never believe in statistics if they can bring your hopes down
instead of you taking it as a challenge.
   With right amount of practice and hard-work any exam is not tough
for even first timers.

Quite a lot of simulation can be done by one system with lots of disk
space/memory and something like VMWare.

Message-ID: <2a17aaee050719005727f06d91@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am using FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE-p28.

I logged in using Telnet and changed user to "root".
I installed jdk and added "JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/diablo-jdk1.3.1" and
"export JAVA_HOME" to the file "/root/.profile"
After doing this, I logged out and then logged in using Telnet and
changed user to "root".
Then now, the environment variable set is not taking effect. I typed
"echo $JAVA_HOME"

I have only Telnet access to the computer. My aim is to set the
environment variable. How should I do it? Please help me in the above
issue.

Thanks,

Dont use telnet, use ssh

And find out what shell you are using as root - freebsd uses /bin/sh, 
not bash, for root, by default

For most "Linux Only" simulations, User Mode Linux
(http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/)
should suffice.

Did you use 'su -' ? Doing 'su' alone
might not run your root account's .profile.

Yes, I used 'su' to login to 'root' account. 

Is there any way to run the root account's .profile, without
restarting the computer?

Try the following command:

[Note the . followed by a space and then

Instead of having:

export FOO=bar

in your .profile, try:

FOO=bar; export FOO

Yes there was some problem. I deleted that file restored from my
backup and now the file looks like the following,

#
# .profile
#
JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/diablo-jdk1.3.1
PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/www/bin

Well well, you'll need to add your environment
variables into /root/.cshrc file rather. The
.profile will not be executed by tcsh shell.

The syntax of (t)csh scripts are a lot
different from (ba|k)sh scripts. Anyways,
here's something that you might want to
try out. Edit /root/.cshrc file and add
the following line:
  set JAVA_HOME /usr/local/diablo-jdk1.3.1

'man csh' to learn more about csh.

If you aren't comfortable with csh, you
can change your default shell to /bin/sh
  (or your favourite shell) by running
the chsh command.

I typed "setenv JAVA_HOME /usr/local/diablo-jdk1.3.1" in the file "/root/.cshrc"

Thanks for all. You have helped me very patiently.

It depends on what you wish to do with it. I remember
using user-mode-linux on a Pentium III 550 MHz with
128 MB RAM running 5 user-mode-linux sessions and
an X Server + lean desktop running on the host.
The 5 uml sessions were setup with a virtual
network connection and one of them were running
apache web server accessible via other sessions
simultaneously via text-mode web browsers. Each
session would add an overhead of about 16 MB memory
(excluding any startup services/programs that you
might want to keep running in that session).

What you need in excess in disk-space to create
image file for each session. This image file
would be mounted via loopback and accessed as the
rootfs by a uml session. But with 40-80 GB hard
disks in vogue today, this shouldn't pose a
constraint.

To summarise, you can setup UML on a desktop class
machine for testing/learning purpose without much
issues.

Gipi, a console based jumble like puzzle game is developed by

One Day One Command 
===================

fsck -- Linux File System Check and Repair Tool.

Summary:

'fsck' is used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux file
systems. If no file-systems are specified on the command line, fsck
will default to checking file-systems in /etc/fstab file.

In actuality, fsck is simply a front-end for the various file system
checkers (fsck.cramfs, fsck.ext2, fsck.ext3, fsck.jfs, fsck.msdos,
fsck.reiserfs, fsck.vfat, ...) available under GNU/Linux OS.

Examples:

# fsck -- Check all file systems available in /etc/fstab.

$ fsck -N -- Don't execute. Just show what would be done.

# fsck -V -- Show detailed output, including all file system-specific
             commands that are executed.

# fsck -a -- Automatically repair the file system without asking for
             confirmations. (By default, ask for conformation).

# fsck /dev/hda2 -- Check the HDA2 device/partition.

# fsck /usr/local -- Check the /usr/local mount point.

# fsck LABEL=usr -- Check file-system, which has a label matching 
                    to "usr".

Read: man fsck

Bye :)

Hello Friends,
I have a suggestion after seeing many friends like me
are interested in preparing for RHCE and would like to
have the help from the group. Think we can have some
kind-of support beign established for the poeple who
would like to take up RHCE and others. We can plan to
help each other and prepare for the same, also if
possible ourselves arrange some mock lab, workshops
and practise sessions where experienced ppl who hv got
their certifications can help the learners and also
support them. 
I herbery leave my suggestion to your consideration :)

Life is to live ! Enjoy living it !

id also. I'll make sure that you get it ASAP.

The site works with Opera, with the User Agent set to Internet

If your fs is Ext2, then you can retrieve the files (use midnight
commander). If it is Ext3, No.

See a lot of posts in this list openly abusing copyrighted material.
Pls remember that the GPL itself is held in place by the copyright
laws. If we are to preach linux (and the GPL) with any sense of moral
authority, for heavens sake, start respecting copyright laws (and
other laws too).

Spend that few hundred ruppees to 'buy' books. Reading from a book is
a lot less strain on the eyes than reading soft copies and you can
read it anywhere - dinner table, bathroom, bus, train etc. And it is
less messy than handling photostat copies. In fact I wouldnt be
surprised if the cost of photostat is almost the same as the cost of
the book - and it will last longer!

Off late we see lot posts which are against copyright laws like
books, request for RHEL cds etc.

I request all to stop posting/requesting materials which do not
permit copying.

Message-ID: <OFBC3FB002.365D3FF4-ON65257044.002D901C-65257044.002EA56D@notes.caritor.com>

Hi,

Yesterday I installed Fedora Code 4 on my Laptop (IBM ThinkPad R52 
(1860AQ1)) which has inbuilt Intel 915GM Graphics Accelarator with 128MB 
shared video memory.

In the begining X was not working properly. It showed only corrupted 
display. My LCD monitor supports 1400x1050 maximum resolution in Windows 
OS. The driver used by Linux is generic VESA. 

Actually I googled a lot regarding 915G chipset before starting the 
installation. But I couldn't find much help. In reading about this I also 
found this: http://www.geocities.com/stomljen/ which contains 
915resolution (from 855resolution) which is supposed to add a VESA mode 
for 1400x1050. I haven't attempted to use that, but some people have 
reported success. Rather you can say that I am afraid to run that program. 
You can see that the program modifies the some information @VBIOS.

I thought of changing X configuration. So I backed up my 
/etc/X11/xorg.conf and modified it. After lots of trial and error the 
following configuration helped me to bring X up.

1) commenting the following entries in "Monitor" section. 

        HorizSync   15.0 - 35.0
        VertRefresh 50.0 - 75.0

   I did this becuase the log says that refresh rate is not matching for 
the mode 1280x1020 while probing this mode. It was not even trying to 
probe 1400x1050.

2) In "Screen" section
 
   I changed the existing lines to look like this.

        DefaultDepth     24
        Subsection "Display"
                Depth    24
                Modes    "1400x1050"
                ViewPort 0 0
        EndSubsection

Now when I started X it worked. Well I am confused how it worked, because 
I commented out the HorizSync and VertRefresh entries, I think which are 
very much important. I wonder how it used 1400x1050 resolution which is 
not even probed by X while trying to choose the apt mode. 

In GNOME, it says that the resolution is 1400x1050 and the refresh rate as 
0Hz. Is this something dangeros? Well the X works fine. Windows says that 
refresh rate is 60Hz. Does anyone come across something like this? This 
0Hz is really bothering me to continue using X.


Cheers,
Noorul

Am not a hardware guy, but is not the sync rate concept specific to
CRT and electron beams!! Maybe the LCD monitors do not use line by

Just remove the content from the Rapidshar site, that is enough. And 
Don't use ILUGC List for sharing the copyrighted contents.

Is RHEL copyrighted as such? Doesn't Red Hat just charge for support? If
that is the scenario, wouldn't RHEL clones like CentOS also be
infringing copyright laws?

RHEL is copyrighted and CANNOT be shared with others. RHEL clones like
CentOS are built using SRPMS (source) which does not violate any
license.

It more about Redhat Trademark. They don't want distribution of their
trade mark material without their consent. CentOS,whitbox etc though
built on RHEL srpms, do not refer to redhat in any place in the
software.

What do you mean by being "copyrighted"? Doesnt being under the GPL mean
that it can be distributed (since the kernel is under GPL) or does it
mean that they have to give out the source alone?

Message-ID: <bc3fff5205072007053b5b6b05@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Friends!

   I am very happy about the linux certification conversations.
Because i too planned to take any Linux certification.
 There may be a good training center in chennai.. But i just wish 
to say my suggestion....

 Reading ourself is good but linux administration is not like 
any programming language. Because in case of programming languages
reading some basic concepts and some depth books are enough 
to get proficient.

 But in case of linux admin you must gather wider knowledge.
and you must know all the basic concepts.Then only you can understand the 
problems.( pls dont take it as degrading ur interest ,linux admin is really
very interest to learn).

 You can learn everything yourself but it take some more time...

  And... starting itself dont prepare specifically for redhat
distributions (GUI)...
just prepare for linux in command line.
     If you learn to handle the configuration files directly (from
command line),surely you can work with any distributions (slightly
differ but it doesnt matter) and also
you can easily work with any GUI tools.

 Actually i have trained by Mr.Chandrashekar babu...
       He is above nine years experienced linuxian . He is taking LAMP
course, Linux Admin , Python ,Perl ,Device Driver, ....Everything
related to linux.
      Not only linux , i have get real time problem situations and
wide knowledge from him.
      He is taking everything in command line ( GUI also) . so  you can 
easily adopt with any distributions.....

Now i need any certifications for HR persons... ;-) so i am looking
for certifications..

This is his website ... have a look...

http://www.chandrashekar.info/

All the best...Continue your suggestions....

Bye

One Day One Command 
===================

umount -- UnMount File System

Summary:

The umount command detaches the file system(s) mentioned from the file
hierarchy. A file system cannot be unmounted when it is `busy', For
example, when there are open files on it, or when some process has its
working directory there, or when a swap file on it is in use.

Examples:

# umount /mnt/cdrom -- Unmount the CDROM, using mount point.

# umount -v /dev/cdrom -- Unmount the CDROM, using device file and 
                          show verbose messages.

# umount -f /nfs/home -- Force unmount (Useful in case of an
                         unreachable NFS system).

# umount -l /media/floppy -- Lazy unmount (I don't care, why the
                             device is busy).

# umount -n /mnt/cdrom -- Unmount, with-out updating the /etc/mtab,
                  which contains the list of currently mounted FSs.

Read: man umount

Tech Tip from Linux Journal:

If you're editing a Web page and want to match a color on another site
or in another application, use Muhammad A. Muquit's "grabc" program.
When you run it from the shell, your X pointer turns into a crosshairs
symbol. Move the crosshairs over the color you want and click, and
grabc gives you the color in hex and decimal.

Subject: [Ilugc] Re-Linux Certifications
Message-ID: <dd680c2b050721001611690403@mail.gmail.com>

friends.
 we r forking many discussions on linux certifications.
Redhat is creating Monopoly by their RHCE,... just like Microsoft MCSE 
series.
It is not advisible to depend only on RH.
 Recently, one of my friend attended RHCE course at chennai.
I called him a slackware box which runs only on CLI,XFCE.
No KDE,No GNOME.
 He refused to work on it and to configure it.
He simply says, reinstall RH. it will give u nice desktop.
 Ha. Ha. see how the RHCE made him?
 so, people. plz learn linux. Not a Redhat Product only.
 Plz collect the list of Trainers and Training Institutes in chennai.
Select a best trainer or center who covers only linux, not a product.
 Here, I too proud to say that I am also a student of Mr. Chandrashekar 
Babu.
We learnt the true Linux on CLI.
I am proud that i can work on any distro/flavour.
 Eventhough did not get any XXXX certification, I am satisfied with my 
knowledge.
I dont want to get some big cardboard sheets to certify me that i know 
something called RedHat Linux.
 I hope, in our group, a lot of Linux gurus r there. are all of them 
certified by a company?
I hope, even linus torvolds too does not have any certifications.
 But, nowadays, Companies needs some recognision for knowledge.
for getting a job only, these certficates are needed.
But, Life is not stopping on getting job only. It still has to continue...
The knowledge should be wide and deep. Then only we can shine at job. isn't 
it?
 In my personal experience, After finising my B.E, as a fresher, the job was 
only a dream for me.
All my friends, went for some courses. MCSE, CCNA, RHCE, Mainframe, Testing, 
J2EE, Multimedia, Oracle, DotNet... The studies we done at college does not 
efficient to get a job. ome extra course is needed. This is the real sad 
fact in the industery. 
 Even, choosing the course is big problem. The course only has to put a tag 
on me 
as a Java guy, MS guy, RH guy....
What to choose? Where to study? whether it will give me job it not?
because, i have to invest heavily on that. The fees is as my B.E 1 year 
fees.
so, it should be worthy. it shold give me job.
 So only, some certification is needed. But I am sure that The institutes 
does not give the students full knowledge. They simply prepare them for 
exams. This happens as just what happens at our schools and colleges.
 Please be careful on choosing the certification courses. On linux side, 
There a more certifications growing. RH series. LPI, Novell, and tomorrow a 
new one will come. even mysql, apache, may 2moro give certifications, just 
for their earnings. who knows? KDE n GNOME may conduct exams and give 
certificates. 
 My sugession is First know the core linux. start from bash, script, the 
basic *nix concepts like user management, process management etc. then dig 
into deep upto kernel compliation, etc. Then start on applications like 
webserver, database server,mail server, proxy servers,firewalls etc.
 Now u r a growing Linux Administrator. These things are in all distros. 
start on ur favourite one.
eventhough u have no certificates, u can do wonders with linux.
 Now, let me talk on job.
Most people prefer to certificates, and there are really some people who 
looks only for knowledge. 
Keep trying until u reach them. surely u can placed well.
 But, if decided to get certified, now too, the knowledge of full linux, not 
a product, is needed.
so, if started to study on own, congrads.The sea of knowledge welcomes. Dig 
urself and get prepared. face the exam and get certified. as u ra self 
learner, u can not stop learning. U can reach the peaks.
 If decided to attend classes. Good. Wishes to find a really skilled 
teacher. Not a guy who repeated the matter which is in the study meterials. 
But, the sad fact is most staff r like this only.they can prepare u for 
exams, they wont give a fire of knowledge. But, really nice staff r there. 
we have to find it.
I hope this group will identify those nice people to all.
 I remember, some long-talk was going here for advertising a training 
center.
Don't make this like that.
 The problem is A lot of fresh students are joining in Linux community.
They need a proper guidence. Not all have PCs at home to prepare manually 
and Not all are self-learners. So, we only have to guide them to get real 
knowledge, not only a product.
 so, dear friends. Here I start the discussions for Linux trainers and 
Centers.
My suggestion is to reach Mr.Chandrashekar Babu. He showed me the real 
Linux. 
I am not certified for any product. But, if i want, i can get it within some 
weeks self preparation.
 There may be a lot of trainers. if u know any one or any nice institute, 
plz mail the details.
because, a lot of my juniors, even my classmates ask me what course to do?
I surely dont show any onther but Linux.
Then where to study? whether they will give assistance for job?
I have to answer the questions. I hope not only me. We only have to show the 
path for jobs on linux and guide them to get not only job, but the treu 
Linux Knowledge.
 There may a rule in our group. No advertisements should be here. Good.
But, students need good guidence. plz consider them.
 Forgive me, if i made any mistakes. Plz Don't top post or create flame war 
on this.
Realise the truth and show the correct way to the student community.
 Thank you all.
 dear,
T.Shrinivasan.

Hello

updating to x.org was a real breeze, but i am facing some problems
(probably will be solved later since it just got into unstable). When i
shift from F1 terminal (console) to F7 terminal (GUI) it starts
flickering slightly also the screen is tilted a bit.

I hear that X.org renders images faster, though i see no perceptible change.

Hello

I use Debian (the unstable branch). How do i get many applications to
use the sound card at the same time? i.e. for 2 applications to use the
sound card, one app waits for the other to finish. This was configured
by default in Gentoo, but in Debian and FC it is not the case.

Perhaps you need to run esd or aRTs daemon and
configure your players/apps to use sound output
via esd/aRTs ?

Hi!

  Mee too. I installed debian recently and I installed xserver-xorg
straight away without xfree86.  I'm too not able to see any diff at
all.

Bye!

1. Make sure you have kernel version 2.6.9 or above.
2. Compile pl2303 (as built-in or as module), and modprobe it
3. modprobe'ing pl2303 with the cable in place should show your phone
as a USB dev accessible at /dev/tts/USB0 (could be different if you
have a not-so-common setup, you can see which one through dmesg
ofcourse, or /var/log/messages depending on your logging preferences.)
4. You can use wvdial or something similar.

Use these in your init commands after ATZ:

'AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","airtelgprs",,0,0'
'AT+CGQREQ=1,0,0,0,0,0'
'AT+CGQMIN=1,0,0,0,0,0'

To dial: '
ATD*99***1#'


Ofcourse, the 1 above in the previous line and the CGDCONT 1 should
match, they are the configuration setting index in your phone. If you
have just one setting, the above should suffice. If you have debugged
earlier you are bould to have more than one settings, in that case
either delete all of them and use 1 or specify which (1, 2, 3 4, or..
whatever) configuration is to be used.

I used k700i for airtel gprs about an year back, and i used IrDA. If
you can not proceed, reply with your questions with a clear list of
the steps you had taken to try and get it to work so I can help you
out.

Thanks and regards,

Also check if 'lock' stuff is enabled in either of the applications
that are trying to use the sound. I remember a few years back I had a
similar problem due to locking.

Could you identify your video device? I have no problems with my Xorg.
Mine is an 855GM with 8mb memory for a 15" LCD.

My DRM is i915, XvMC enabled.

It is supposed to be faster because it is a lot more slimmer compared
to the earlier beast. Support for various devices is fast catching up.
But ofcourse, there are other factors that influence the rendering
speed, efficiency and clarity than just this one, though major,
component.

   This is a known issue - the workaround is:

export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5

<or>

export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1

Then rebuild the rpmdb:

rpm --rebuilddb

The longer term fix is to upgrade to rpm-4.3, but you
may have to jump through a lot of dependency hoops, including
glibc-2.3.3, to do that.

And that is the appropriate way, unless the intention is to just
'avoid' the current problem's side-effects.

Depending on the severity of the situation it may not be the best or
even a candidate solution if stability is of concern.

And clearly, snubbing dependencies for a kernel is not something one
should do unless it was a personal computer used predominantly for
checking emails and surfing the web.

Locking is a mechanism to mandate exclusive access to the sound
device. Possibly your applications are accessing the audio device
directly, that simply can not happen.

Sound servers are present nowadays that overcome this problem by
acting as a mux/demux for all audio applications and the single audio
device.

Please tell the error message you get and from which specific
application if any, if applicable.

Also, http://alsa.opensrc.org/ should help.

There is a software mixer in ALSA named "dmix". It can do mixing so
you dont need arts/esd.

Why? What are you trying to do actually?

What is that?

You should never update mtab, it is done by the kernel. Only play with fstab.

For permission denied, are you trying to write the CD as root or normal user?

> can i chang cdwriter /dev/scd0 to /dev/hdd.

hdd will have the major,minor pointing to a ide driver. scd* has
major,minor to a scsi driver.

Depending on your [u]dev[fs] settings, your requirements can not be
met with out some fiddling.

Good, use k3b or something similar, and please have a look at

Hi,

Anyone here used Rconnect over IrDA? Or do you know any phone that
supports it over bluetooth?

If you have had success with Rconnect (over USB, IrDA, Bluetooth,
Serial) please let me know, I would to discuss a few issues off the
list.

Specifically, I am interested in knowing this:

1. Compatibility of the drivers provided. Is it ok with Linux/BSD?
2. Any limitations you faced while using the alternatives (bt, irda, usb, 8250)
3. Outages, and the like.
4. Availability and Reachability while on the move.
5. Total cost of investment for you.

Thanks a lot!

I hope this solves your problem. pgrep comes with the procps package (the

Hi,
   I am using a system which is under a proxy server(
in college) . The local ip of proxy server is 10.1.1.1
and nmap from inside the network say all ping probes
are blocked. The global ip of the proxy server is
203.197.138.163

nmap of this global ip from a system inside network
gave the following output.

$nmap 203.197.138.163
nmap 3.50 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ ) at
2005-07-22 13:21 IST
Interesting ports on ns.annauniv.edu
(203.197.138.163):
(The 1657 ports scanned but not shown below are in
state: filtered)
PORT    STATE  SERVICE
80/tcp  open   http
523/tcp closed ibm-db2

Nmap run completed -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned
in 72.702 seconds.

Now i want to connect to  a system outside this
network which has a global ip (to my home computer). I
have all privilages at the home computer and the a
machine that is behind the proxy server. I am running
sshd at 80,22,53,443 ports. i am not able to connect
through any port through sshd from my college to
house. 

What way should i tunnel?

Dear Members,

Warm greets, I am facing the display problem when i browse any tamil
unicode content site.
My config

RH  9.0 operating system
Mozilla

When i set the character  encoding to  UTF-8 in the font section,even
then i am getting some [] box characters. In the language section
under character encoding  i can find some languages except tamil. I
tried of Tamizha mozilla web browser still the [] box problem
persists.I tried with  konquerer still the box problem persists. I
downloaded RRJanatamil from c-dac site and installed on  the machine
and installed by doing a sequence of step mentioned in another web
site. I am having a [] boxing day with this [] box problem. Any 
pointers to solve this . Thanks in advance.

This is the reason software like http://transconnect.sourceforge.net exists. :)

Are you able to SSH to your home machine from anywhere else ?

Did you try nmap on your home machine from your college machine which
is behind the proxy ?

not so uncommon. I have seen even more silly settings on an LG 3100
phone. I used to get an IP address of 255.255.255.255. Yeah, IP
address. And that also was my gateway IP.

It happens when you have hardware that depends more on software for
any use. Usually the higher end models have more capable devices.
Nokia/SE models never have these problems. And usually the case is,
these devices fail under Linux - I had no way of getting my LG 3100
transfer data under Linux. I even hacked ppp code in kernel mode to
force accepting the settings and send the packets nevertheless on that
serial port. It didn't succeed in sending the packets even though my
hack on establishing the link succeeded.

It turns out that they depend heavily on the host operating system and
its 'device driver' which is the (software) modem.

Not sure about this ADSL and Rconnect thing. Could be of a similar
type. Are you able to get it work under Linux? I think reliance
provides drivers for Linux, no?

Yes I can connect to deepan's comp.
Mine is a global IP.
The proxy server at college is only blocking that.

If you do not have the permission to change it, then I think it is not

If you have shell elsewhere and you really want to connect to your
home PC you can try SSH Tunnelling - Putty should help you in Dynamic
Tunneling.

But as Arvind mentioned it might not be a good idea to evade security
setup done by your college or whom so ever it may be.

AFAIK the anna univ proxy server allows the 3128 port alone (apart from
the 80 port). This is also the reason you cant use GAIM.

You will need to upgrade to KDE 3.2
for Tamil to work in KDE apps.
(the default KDE for RH 9 is <3.2)
You will also need xft enabled Mozilla binaries
for Tamil to display in Mozilla.

Debian + ALSA + dmix is a very easy setup.
Here's an article that details *every* that's required to setup dmix.

Subject: [Ilugc] Interoperability- Any Linux equivalent of AUTOCAD?
Message-ID: <000c01c58faf$5c98e560$0201a8c0@DATAONE>

Hi all,

I posted this query some time back.

A major stumbling block to conversion to Linux at Office is the lack of
AUTOCAD equivalent in Linux.

Usually when we prepare technical reports, we keep open word processor,
presentation software and AUTOCAD also. Our colleagues send us Autocad
Drawings in .dwg format. We flit seamlessly between the three apps to make a
report, a presentation and for distribution, we open it in Openoffice and
make pdf also.

We are forced to do all this in Windows. There are youngsters who are
willing to experiment, but the above is the stumbling block.

Is there any app which can read .dwg format drawings and work with it? We
cannot force others to send us drawings in other formats. But if we are able
to do it ourselves with any other app, it will help.

Any pointers please?

NS Srikanth

Though I've never tried them, both of em have received good reviews.

Argh. Missed the bad URL. It should be

I do not see a /join.php on chennailug.org as an hyperlink.

QCAD I think has commands compatible with Autocad. I remember
compiling it once was a pain. But that was long ago.. no idea how it
is now.

Greetings!

I would like to thank the Correspondent, Dr. (Tmt.)
Umayal Ramanathan, the Registrar, Mr. Dhandapani, CSE
HOD, Dr. S. Sakthivel, Alagappa University, Karaikudi
for providing me with an opportunity to conduct a
GNU/Linux workshop for the MCA students on Saturday,
July 23, 2005.

The photos taken during the presentation (and the
trip) can be viewed from:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album13

The labs already had Red Hat, but, it was used at a
basic programming (bash scripting, desktop usage)
level. The sessions included the career opportunities
with GNU/Linux, and on the free software available for
engineers. 

Unfortunately, the download speeds are are not that
high. I gave them Knoppix 3.6, Fedora Core 3,
The.Code.Linux.avi, C-DAC tamil fonts, and the
presentation slides in CDs. BSNL are the ones who
provide some Internet connection facilities. Sify has
netcafe centers in the city, which have much better
download speeds. Most of them have a computer at home.
I've told them to send e-mails if they require any
CDs, and we can simply send the CDs to them through
courier. 

The students were very much interested in GNU/Linux. 
You should have seen their eyes, the eagerness and
willingness to really learn, to understand the
fundamental concepts of computer science, to really
put theory into practice, as opposed to ...

I definitely said I will come again, and do a much
longer workshop for the students.

Regards,

SK

Dear Friends,

Last Friday, Jul 22 2005, i have taken a session on gnu/linux at
Velammal Engg. College, Chennai for their ECE third year students.
Around 120 students have participated. It lasted for 1hr.

It was all about the following:

1) Why GNU/Linux ?
2) GNU/Linux for Engineers
3) Info about various GNU/Linux distributions
4) Intro about Perl/PHP scripting
5) Q/A

In general, it went fine. It was interactive to some extent. Please

Hi all,

        Recently I installed FC4 on my IBM ThinkPad. While booting I gets 
this message.

ide0: I/O resource 0x1F0-0x1F7 not free.
ide0: ports already in use, skipping probe

Initially I didn't really notice that. But later I found out that SATA 
driver is being used by the kernel. And my hard disk device files are 
/dev/sda* not /dev/hd*. Does anyone experienced something similar to 
this?. Is it ok to work with this driver? Is there anyway to resolve this 
problem?

Cheers,
Noorul

hi,
      i am running HTS (http tunneling server) in
bioinformatics.org and HTC in my computer. the command
for HTC is
$htc -F 8888 bioinformatics.org:80
When i  tried 
$telnet  localhost 8888 
.. it said 
connected to localhost.localdomain(127.0.0.1) 
 Escape character ^] 
 connection closed by foreign host 
>From the netstat output i see 
" tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8888

I dont undestand why htc should go to time wait state.



and tcpdump does not dump any traffic at port 80. so
it means the HTC has not forwarded my request at
all... can anyone undestand why it says connection

Hi!

Its been quite sometime since we all met and had a
discussion. Is anyone interested in giving a talk this
Saturday, July 30, 2005? We can have it at Ma Foi
Academy, will confirm with Asokan Pichai. 

I would like to shed some light on what Tiruchirapalli
MYSQL group is working on, and our future
collaboration projects with them. Also have added lot
of companies to our GNU/Linux database. I need to
discuss on that too. 

So, let me know folks, we can meet this Saturday.

Anytime. No formalities. 

I forgot to add in my previous e-mail about my laptop
on the trip to Alagappa University:

We earlier had a discussion on the sturdiness of
laptops. With respect to this trip I want you guyz to
know that my IBM T41 travelled from Tiruchirapalli to
Karaikudi in the bus on our bumpy highways. I did have
it inside a Targus notebook case, which, was kept
inside a trolley cabin case. I had kept the cabin case
under the seat.

On the way back, from Karaikudi to Tiruchirapalli, it
was lying in the trunk of an Ambassador car. I don't
think you need any other example to show that this IBM
T41 is really sturdy. Of course, this baby shipped
from Hong Kong to the US. I don't know how different
the Thinkpads sold in India are :)

Actually, we should aim at getting laptops running
GNU/Linux for _everyone_.

In US universities, each and every student owns a
laptop, which they bring to class, take notes with it,
do their homework with it. They work on it in the
outdoors, in the labs, in the classrooms, just
anywhere on/off-campus. Of course, you have a laptop
which you used during your under-graduate study in
college. But, how many people can afford this? Like
how mobile phones are owned by every individual,
laptops should be owned by every one in India. When
will this happen?

There are now portable systems in India, like mobilis,
 that cost about Rs.10,000/-? But again how many
people can afford that in rural places? If we have to
take technology to every nook and corner of the world,
hardware prices should come down. Brazil, a happening
place for GNU/Linux, has a tie-up with Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge on bringing a
 USD100 (INR 5,000) laptop, of course, running
GNU/Linux. 

http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/americas/06/30/brazil.laptop.ap/index.html

There are so many schools and colleges who still do
paper-work. It is extrememly simply to setup a network
running GNU/Linux machines and do all their
administration, communication etc. at an economical
price. People are just ignorant.

  I tried FC3 recently on the same motherboard which I brought
recently. I had no probs. Why? Is your hard-disk a SATA one or the ATA
one. Mine was a 120GB SATA. Debian installation requires you to have
the linux 2.6 kernel. But FC3, I never knew what it did (Rather I
didn't care.. I could have found out easily though.)  But now I have
debian. I know two of my other friends who brought the same
motherboard some time ago had installed FC3 without any hassles.

I have not used any USB floppy but here are a few questions which may help 
you to solve the problem

Did u create any file-system on the floppy ( using mkfs kind of utilities) ?
Are sure /dev/sda refers to the device having the file system. (it might be 
something like /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2 etc)?

What does the output of "dmesg|egrep '(floppy|sda|fd)'" say.?

rpm -Uvh will remove older version and install the

rpm -Fvh ?.

Even if the older version does not exist, -U installs the package for you.

The existence of the old version of the package is mandatory for the -F option.

"man rpm" has the necessary details :-)

rpm -Uvh will upgrade the package if older one exist or will install
the new one.
rpm -Fvh will upgrade the package only if older one exist and will not
install if older one not found.

let see this with example.

you have a 100+ rpm files in a directory which consist of GNOME & KDE
upgrades. You are a GNOME user you want to upgrade only the newer
GNOME packages. if you did rpm -Uvh *.rpm it will upgrade GNOME
packages as well as install the new KDE packages. Where if you did rpm
-Fvh *.rpm it only upgrade already installed packages.

Hi,
I would like to view specific lines
(range given in command line) of a file.

Say for example, I want to view line numbers
27 to 39 of file file.txt.

Is there any command to do that.? I do not like
to use sed or awk or any editors like vi.

Thoughts/idea are welcome.

Thanks and Regards,

Use Head and Tail

$ head -n 39 file.txt | tail -n 12 

39 - 27 = 12.

HTH :)

You better like sed atleast for this requirement of yours. It does
exactly what you want.

$ sed -n 27,39p <file>

Hi Bharathi,

Thanks for the neat workaround.

If you come to know any other utility like cat,grep,egrep,fgrep
more,less etc which can do the same functionality please let me know.

All you folks who are using deb based systems and
trying out apt-get might also want to check out
apt-cache...

And for those who love a GUI for apt-get synaptic
offers a pretty good interface.

Hi All,
I have recently got BSNL Dataone broadband connection . I facing a
strange problem.

My websites http://thamizha.com and http://mugunth.tamilblogs.com are
not accessible thro Dataone broadband.  They give timeout errors
always.
But the same URLs are accessible thro Sify and other isps.

I have reported this problem to BSNL Broadband tech support and so far
they are not able resolve it.

I heard Dataone broadband has some DNS issue due to that some URLs are
not accessble thro Dataone broadband.

Had anyone in this group faced similar issue?

Regards,
Mugunth

Yes. It might take time for DNS Cache to get updated in BSNL DC

You might be right. I checked KPPP configuration as
user and found all the
coloumns in the
modem commands box were empty. So I launched KPPP as
root and copied all the
contents in the modem commands box. Now when I launch
KPPP as user it is 
working
fine. I did not have this problem when I was using
Mandrake 10.1.

Thanks for all those goa luggies who have replied.

Dear Mr. Balachander , Mr Mugunth raj and  friends,

I also faced a similiar problem with  my clients website
www.rscomptech.org. I was using windows platform as the operating
system. I was and I am using tata indicom telephone cdma service. I
was unable to access my client website  and the access pattern happend
to be discrete. some time i was able to access and some time i am not.
when i checked with the other isp Touchtel in a browsing center, the
webpage was browsing without any problem.

I nail down my problem with a tool 

www.megaproxy.com  through which in my machine i was able to browse
the troubled website and that the same cannot be browsed through my IE
browser and the same period (with a lag of 5 mins) and came to
conclusion that some malicious code was closing and opening the dns
door (for resolving) on and off discretely to the concerned web
site.other than
that i was unable to ping my website , but through megaproxy.com i can
able to browse my website through their dns support.

I see similarity in this issue, i would suggest you to back up your
data  and format your hard drive. I divorced windows and with linux
now living peacefully.

I am not running down to the conclusion saying that we both had the
same problem,you might check the same with www.megaproxy.com web site
and let me know.

I am a bit sure that this is not a propogational delay problem.

Let me know your response,

cheers

Thyagarajan.

you are able to browser that means their   dns caches faster than bsnl.

i registered a domain and that domain is accessible outside from my
home but is not accessible from my home for more than 3 days. you know
if u register a domain you see within 48hours. but i can able ping the
domain in a browsing centre. at home i am not able to ping it. i am
not using windows. i am also using Mdk 10.1 linux. i browse, play,
learn thro it. what do you say about this?? does this is due to
malicious code???

Hi Thyagu,
I am able to browse thamizha.com using www.megaproxy.com website.

It means the dns at Dataone end is not able to pick up thamizha.com site. 
Also thamizha.com is not a newly registered site, it has been there
for more than 2 years.

What can be done for resolving this.

Mugunth

Dear friends,

The same has happened for me also, When i reported  it to my ISP (Tata
indicom CDMA) they where helpless. At a same point of time my isp and
myself where pinging my troubled website, my isp was able to ping it
but not me.in my opinion You cannot blame it on your isp (try with
dataone connection elsewhere at the same point of time ,try to ping 
it). So the question of Dns cache propogational delays is ruled out. I
understood the problem was at my end. So i reformatted my computer and
the problem was fixed. So at this point of time, i would request you
to try with a alternate computer (if you have one) to ping in the same
connection. The malicious code (which i faced) was targetting the web
site publishing system.

Kindly do the same and let me know,(i mean either a format option on
your system  or a alternate machine to ping the website).Kindly let me
know your operating system and software configuration.

Thanking you

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

One Day One Command 
===================

apt-cache -- Debian APT (Advanced Package Tool) package handling
             utility.

Summary:

apt-cache performs a variety of operations on APT's package cache.  
apt-cache does  not  manipulate the state of the system, but does
provide operations to search and generate interesting output from 
the package meta-data (/var/lib/apt/lists).

Examples:

$ apt-cache search xfree86 -- Show package info and descriptions for 
                              the search-string (xfree86).

$ apt-cache policy gcc -- Show version and priorities of the available 
                          Packages.

$ apt-cache show postgresql -- Show detailed description of postgresql
                               package.

$ apt-cache showpkg mozilla -- Show all kind of dependencies for the 
                               Mozilla package.

$ apt-cache depends mozilla -- List the packages needed by Mozilla.

$ apt-cache rdepends kde -- List all packages that needs KDE.

Tech Tip from Linux Journal:

If you're formatting C code with "indent" and you have really awful
tricky parts that you want to leave with your own indenting, you can
make indent leave them alone by putting:

/* *INDENT-OFF* */  before each "special" chunk of code, and

/* *INDENT-ON* */   after it.

It is his office server and he wants to do this (presumably) with
senior management's blessing.

Having said that, the only way to fiddle around with relayed emails is
Milter. It is not going to be easy to setup, though.

You will not receive bounced emails unless there is a machine on your
network sending out these emails in the first place. It seems to me that
you might have a trojaned machine on your network which is sending out
spam emails. Your best bet is to update virus signatures on all machines
on the network and run a full test to determine if there are trojans.

If this does not isolate the machine sending out the spam, then you can
setup a network sniffer which will pinpoint the machines on the network
sending out these packets. Once you have identified this machine, you can
resolve the problem by perhaps formatting and reinstalling the OS and
other software.

To answer your question about setting up Sendmail to make a copy of each
mail, yes - this is indeed possible. Please look at the Sendmail docs for
an explanation; one option is you can setup a default email id to which
all outgoing emails are copied automatically by your sendmail server - but
this does not in itself handle the case of documents leaving your network
without your permission because it is possible to use a separate SMTP
server other than your sendmail server to send out emails. Additionally,
documents can be sent over Yahoo! messenger, MSN and other IMs.

One point to Joe Steeve - you are not automatically guaranteed the right
to privacy on a corporate network. The computers you might use on your
corporate network are not considered your private space / private property
and what you do on those machines can be monitored and tracked. This
applies even to emails, your chat sessions, your browsing habits and so
on. This is true in the west and this is particularly true in India since
we don't have any strong privacy laws unlike in the West.

It is unlikely that this is due to a malicious software installed on your
machine. It seems to me that your home machine is pointing to a DNS server
which has not yet resolved the domain to the IP address. I understand that
you are running Linux at home.

Do you have a DNS server installed and running on your machine and are you
using this as your primary DNS server? If so, please consider using your
ISP's dns server.

It can't be the problem coz... if malicious software is installed on
the machine...then it will not be possible for him to browse anyother
site... but the problem exists only with a couple of site hosted on
the same server. so the dns in the client computer is configured
properly...

i have been using debian for quite a long time.. and i knew nothign

the online update features of

and other prominent distros.

ofcourse i did a google, and found yum.. but iam not much lucky with
other distros. And if there is any possibility of getting the updates
by anyother means like cds too let me know since iam trying to update
some systems which dont have net connection.

Well, its been a while since I used these, but as I remember there is
a 'port' (?) of apt-get to  these rpm based distros - called apt4rpm
or something - this has probably changed now, its been a while since I
used these distros.
 
> and other prominent distros.

For Slackware, u can use swaret to do updates and upgrades - I've used
it extensively, and its pretty good. There is also something called
slaptget, but I havent used it, but is supposed to be pretty OK.
Swaret is the most popular for slack though...

uclibc - http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/

  uClibc (aka ?Clibc/pronounced yew-see-lib-see) is a C library for
  developing embedded Linux systems. It is much smaller than the GNU C
  Library, but nearly all applications supported by glibc also work
  perfectly with uClibc. Porting applications from glibc to uClibc
  typically involves just recompiling the source code. uClibc even
  supports shared libraries and threading. It currently runs on
  standard Linux and MMU-less (also known as ?Clinux) systems with
  support for alpha, ARM, cris, i386, i960, h8300, m68k, mips/mipsel,
  PowerPC, SH, SPARC, and v850 processors.

newlib - ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/newlib/index.html

  Newlib is a C library intended for use on embedded systems. It is a
  conglomeration of several library parts, all under free software
  licenses that make them easily usable on embedded products.

Fedora comes with yum pre-installed. It also has up2date. I generally
use to update. U can use
#yum update 
to update all installed software to the current version.
up2date has GUI based interface which means just select check-boxes & click.

did you try $ping 68.142.226.37 (its the IP addr. of Yahoo server)
If this did not work then probably the problem is on the Linux side.

Message-ID: <42E86267.6020903@gmail.com>

Hi all,

We all know IE still hold 85% users around the world. Though the % may 
have shrunk a bit after firefox but it is still substantial.

Are you guys aware of any effort that is been carried out in open source 
world to generate a tool that can automatically migrate html pages that 
run only on IE to mozilla compatible ones? Also, is mozilla planning to 
support few of the dhtml that only IE currently supports like right 
click, drag and drop etc?

 From my own project, we have developed web portal that currently open 
on in IE. We would like to make them mozilla compatible but since will 
involve lot of manual work (therefore resources, thereofre money..) it 
is been shelved for now.

shall we all start one if nothing is currently done ;) ?

You need to look at the libc sources - glibc, or if it is too much of
a download then dietlibc or uclibc.

Remember that itoa() is NOT part of standard library. atoi() is, though.

HTML pages do not "run". HTML is a text markup system. They are
rendered by the browser, and I expect all browsers currently render
HTML just fine.

Firefox does drag and drop etc. Go to http://www.google.com/ig in
Firefox, sign in and customise the page.

Hi All,

I am planning to bring one of these to Chennai next month:

http://tinyurl.com/654h5

It works great with BT in UK and a couple of other guys I have tried
it with; is anyone using it with any of the ISPs in Chennai? I am on
Tata Indicom broadband in Chennai (earlier VSNL broadband, still
earlier Dishnet DSL).

The main idea is to roam around the house with my laptop, but there is
also a low-end PC at home. I intend to hook up the PC with an ethernet
card to this box. The PC is some sort of Celeron with 256MB RAM,
running Win2k Pro and FC3 (which I'll upgrade to FC4). Does anyone
have any suggestions for a decent cheap linux-compatible ethernet card
for this PC?

Thanks,

Binand

I'm not sure if you can use ADSL modem which comes with the router,
most the ISP's in india prefer using motorola ADSL modem because they
are kind of outdated in west.
You can use the wireless and router feature, I have tried it with a
SMC wireless router, works perfect :)-.

Is anyone interested in giving a talk on writing Emacs modes? Maybe
split it into two talks: one on ELisp and one on programming Emacs. I
remember Karra giving a talk on this in 2002. So maybe he would be
interested in going for a sequel now. Sriram if you are on this list,
I'd like to discuss some ideas before you prepare your talk.

And while we are on this, while it is fun to have 'general' talks in
the meetings, maybe we can add some more meatier topics to keep
fatties like me happy.

I too noticed similar problem with Fireofx when i
updated from 1.04 to 1.06, esp with Gmail. It has
started taking too much time for logging in and inbox
to be displayed than it was with earlier version.

You can use this as a server. It does depend on what
servers you want to run.

This you should use it for development, browsing.
 
You never mentioned on how you connect to the
Internet.   Depending on that you can design your LAN.

DAX at Ritchie Street costs between Rs.350-Rs.400.
Works great with GNU/Linux. I am using the 8139too

Dear all -

There is requirement for web developers with good/medium expertise in LAMP
for developing an e-commerce solution. Experience in any Open Source
Commerce suite is a sort of mandatory. Good knowledge of Drupal or any
other Open Source CMS is an added advantage. Interested persons please
send your resume to praveen@symonds.net and/or babu@linare.com (preferably

  I would recommend using the ISP-supplied ADSL modem, and
getting a Linksys WRT54G instead for the WiFi/Routing portion.
The main advantage is that the Linksys has alternative Linux-based
images/routing distros available for customizing it.

   I've been having great luck with used 3Com 3c905 and Intel 82557/8/9
cards available from electronic scrap dealers for ~Rs.100 each. Both can
deliver close to the rated 100 Mbps with minimal interrupt overhead on the
CPU. Avoid Realtek like the plague - that seems to be the only chipset
on new cards available locally, but the CPU overhead is too high for serious
routing applications, and it costs 4x the cards I referenced earlier. 

Early Realteks had a serious bug related to the use of an in-band non-
escaped data-pattern as some kind of state machine reset on the MAC (this
may have been fixed on the 8139c, but I'm taking no chances. Anybody
who designed that kind of crap would have left other undetected crap 
floating around as well.)

Stick with Intel 82557/8/9, DEC/Intel 2114x (Tulip), AMD PCnet or 3Com,
and you'll have no problems. Use Realtek as a last resort, and only on client
desktops.

The ADSL Modem you have uses PPPoE. It should technically work with any
ISP that provides DSL over PPPoE. Touchtel for instance, does PPPoA and so
your gizmo won't work with their service (the modem part). I recently
bought a modem in the US that can handle PPPoA and worked without any
problem. Of course, you can just buy /rent a modem here and use this as a
router / FW. The router / FW of course are independent of service / IP
protocol and the like.

Hi all,

Has anyone spotted a book on MIPS in any of the bookshops
here(Chennai)? Does anyone on the list own any MIPS book they are
planning to kindly sell/share? MIPS is used so much in embedded
systems, but few books are available.

As an aside I did manage to get a good book on ARM - "ARM System
developer's guide" from Landmark. I was surprised to find an Indian
edition there, I just grabbed it.

Please help me out on this!

The definitive book for embedded mips programming is Dominic
Sweetman's 'See MIPS Run'.  It is a brilliantly written book and is a
standard reference in many commercial embedded software shops.  I am
not sure if there is an Indian edition available... but I am sure
someone like Eswar or Landmark will be able to order the US edition
for you.  If you are a professional MIPS programmer, it's worth every
bit of its $40 price tag.

Apart from detailed info about the MIPS architecture, the book also
has very clear discussions about many general programming topics, like
compiler optimizations, portability, endian issues (which is the
clearest and most comprehensive treatment of the subject I have come
across anywhere) and such.

I am using FC3-x86_64 edition on Athlon 64 for quite some time and so
far have not encountered any problems.

Previously I had FC1_i386 edition on the same machine and didn't faced
any issues.

BTW, is the 64bit processor an Intel Itanium? I think the itanium is
based on the IA-64 architecture and so the above builds dont work on
them. (Can some one on the list provide more thoughts on this).

Hi,
After some struggle I have convinced people here that
version control systems is essential and will help a
lot in maintaining source code.

When I mentioned "subversion" as the option, they want
to use cvs as they feel it is well proven, is much of
standards like stuffs etc.,

The problem is like this. Right now, there is a server
(hp-ux)and around 10 developers are working on their codes
currently in different directories. The problem is there
is only one account/username shared by all the users and we
cannot get individual account in the server for each and
every person. I heard something like cvs will identify
the commits based on the login name. If that is the case,
in the above scenario there will be problem.

Is there any way to share the same account and still
maintain code efficiently by different developers without
any problem.

I have started reading documentation and started to lay
my hands on cvs on unix.

Since I have only worked on wincvs(by blindly checking in
and check out wihtout knowing what is happening internally),
that too 3 years ago, I dont know much.

Any suggestion from the experts are most welcome.

Thanks and Regards,

As far as I know subversion is also quite stable, though I do not
have personal knowledge.

cvs has password server concept called pserver. We can have
non-system users commit/checkout by maintaining separate password
file in cvs repository

Hi all,

Has anyone spotted a book on MIPS in any of the bookshops
here(Chennai)? Does anyone on the list own any MIPS book they are
planning to kindly sell/share? MIPS is used so much in embedded
systems, but few books are available.

As an aside I did manage to get a good book on ARM - "ARM System
developer's guide" from Landmark. I was surprised to find an Indian
edition there, I just grabbed it.

Please help me out on this!

Subversion is also proven - Mono, KDE, GCC have all gone the SVN way. 
SVN is five years old and quite stable. Check out the testimonials and
CVS comparison sections on subversion.tigris.org.

With SVN you don't have to cache your auth info and can supply it when
executing a svn command.

I have heard of some HP-UX specific issues with SVN - If after some
research you find that it's not serious, SVN would be a better choice.

ILUGC list is the best place place to get SVN advice - I suspect one
or two folks who work on SVN hang out here ;-)

Subversion is a best choice. CVS is also good. Subversion developers
are consiously developing it to overcome the difficulties of CVS.

   Use TIFF format.  TIFF is a platform independent image format. Its more or
   less equivalent to PSD format in terms of features.

Using bash? Try this:

ulimit -c 253625424
xine 2> Xine.err

Now after the X restart, see if you have a file called core[.*] and
also see `less Xine.err` content.

Try debugging with that, using gdb.

If no success kindly get back with what you saw there. i.e., send the
Xine.err content and also the output of : $ gdb `which xine` coreFile
, then type 'bt' send us that.


Also tell me this:
1. Have you had success earlier?
2. Does this happen only for a particular (or a set of) video files?
3. Do you see /etc/X11/XvMCConfig file? If yes, what is inside it?
4. What is your kernel and DRM version?
5. You sure you have the necessary codecs for that DVD/VCD/whatever installed?

Thanks and regards,
