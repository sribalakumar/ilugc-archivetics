some use windows - although usually with openoffice and thunderbird. There is no

Is there a particular reason for this Windows dependency?

some of the nrc-foss people wear several hats and need to use windows for 
other things they are working on. AU-KBC centre which also runs NRC-FOSS is a 
research centre primarily focussed on proprietary software, patents, royalties 
etc. They also do some foss, the wireless department works with both atheros 
and OLPC and the NLP department releases some of it's work as open source and 
uses a lot of foss tools, as does the bioninformatics department. Incidently 
there is a significant number of people who develop FOSS but work on windows 
(or Mac). It is not the tools that are important, what is important is that 
the code is free - a good example is the potlatch editor for Openstreetmap, 
written in flash and developed on doze. Compare that to the 'foss' software 
developed by the Kerala government and endorsed by the fsf - uses linux and 
lamp stack, but the code is proprietary. What use is it?

As far as AU-KBC is concerned all the servers are linux - a lot of the 
desktops are also linux, but the majority of them are windows. AFAIK it is 
left to the individual to choose his/her OS. There are even some MSDOS 
machines which control some of the older equipment.

You claim that the FSF has endorsed proprietary code. Any explicit
links to corroboration of this assertion?

In principle, this is a sensible point of view.

One question which is worth asking in such mixed environments is:
 Who helps to manage the machines?

Typically, if you buy a product then you are entitled to support for
that product, so the burden of support for Windows machines *must* be
passed on to the vendor you bought them from (or MicroSoft). It *is*
harmful to FOSS if FOSS developers spend a lot of their time making
such machines work instead of completing their FOSS projects.

Regards,

Kapil.

RMS released the booklet describing the all the wonderful 'foss' projects of 
the government of Kerala. The booklet was financed by FSFI. It describes 5 or 6 
'foss' projects of govt of kerala - no links to the code. I am sure that if 
you google you can find it - I am traveling with only intermittent internet 
access. Possibly space kerala website may have the info. We have dead trees 
copies of the booklet in our Chennai office.

This would have been a valid point in GNU's nascent days.
Now that we have a complete and functional free desktop environment,
the point is moot.

I think the point is as an organization , we have to focus on productivity
also.

 As an individual I was able to migrate to Linux slowly .Even then it took
me about an year to be completely independent of proprietary software . It
was my own initiative.It was not easy though I am very happy I was able to
do now.

But when it come to work , I still need a windows machine  for some reason
or other. Webex was not supported properly till few months ago in Linux till
Cisco took over and did something about it. We are dependent on windows
environment for something or other. In India digital certificate and company
formation etc are still depending on windows and IE !  This is mainly
because of individuals resisting change since they do not want to learn
something new or lose control over others - nothing technical about it .

With SAAS picking up , 100% independence will happen but we have to patient
and worked towards it. And in the mean time we have to live with mixed
environment and make sure we are productive and efficient.

Fair enough. But it still seems a tad funny to include 'FOSS' as part of the
organization's name and use a non-free OS internally. :)

you mean that code released under the GPL but developed on windoze is not 
FOSS? Or apps developed *for* windoze and on windoze and released under GPL is 
not FOSS?

See first thing is its done with microsoft word not even open office... The
format is in "ppt" well i know we can save as ppt in open office but i
wonder (why?).

If you have looked at the foss conference website..They allowed to upload
only those open document formats...I wonder how this thing got in there?

They should have at least removed the windoze part before presenting
..........

This is really a shame...no matter what the explanation is......At least
don't make this happen in future..

I don't understand how digital certificates are dependent on any
perticular O/S. In fact, I would be equally surprised if you told me
that digital certificates can only be managed on Linux or Solaris.

Could you please explain this statement?

Nope, I haven't said any of that. :)
And I agree with you to a certain extent, since Emacs is available
for windows after all. :)

But you do seem to disdain Windows, by referring it to it as 'windoze'.
And IMO, we have achieved feature parity with Windows - meaning there is
really no need to cling on to it. So maybe, all that is needed here is a
little education and imparting of some hardcore GNU theory to the 'doze' users. :)

Hi !

I am not very sure. It is not the digital certificate but the site of
ministry of corporate affairs.
I think it is  managed by Tatas and not very Linux friendly.
The site is http://www.mca.gov.in/ and I had posted this many e-governance
forums.
I will try to get hold of the reference to those postings.

In TN due to efforts of Mr.Umashankar , they made it work to an extent I
guess.

Hello,

On reading the mails from KG and VN:

Some kinds of e-legal work:

currently depends on the use of proprietary software (usually Windows)
in the Indian environment.

As VN has said we should be aware that technical solutions will
not be enough. What if the majority of students demand training in
proprietary platforms? What if the majority of people who submit tax
returns do them using windows? In such cases, technical solutions
alone will not carry the day.

However, it would be nice if NRC-FOSS created a "FOSS usability bug
list" which detailed each of these problems (i.e. unavailibility of
FOSS solutions) in the area of e-legal, e-gov and e-commerce.

Then people who have knowledge of FOSS solutions can try to write the
necessary configuration and documentation to make these solutions
available as alternatives to the proprietary ones that are currently
in vogue. Those who are insiders in law/gov/business can make the
reuirements more specific so that solutions can be found.

There will need to be give and take from both sides in order to work
out good solutions.

Perhaps such a list is already in place. In that case it would be
nice if the URL is posted.

Regards,

Kapil.

It is quite likely that to get registered as a level-1 Certifying
Authority you need to be a large government or corporate body with
some kind of permanence. The official who supervises the IT operations
in such a large organisation is very unlikely to be clueful about
FOSS (in general). So it is possible that these level-1 CA's in India
are not particularly FOSS friendly.

So perhaps one needs to start low and get (by using Windows if
necessary!) registered as a level-2 or level-3 Certifying Authority.
Then, by providing certificates to other businesses using a FOSS-based
system way one can get a toe-hold and build a case for getting a
higher level certification. This way FOSS business-es would
eventually have an alternative to avoid using Windows to get
digital certificates.

Regards,

Kapil.

1) Do you realize that that still may be open source. Afaik, it is ok if the

Mr. Kenneth, I would appreciate it if you called it
Microsoft Windows
and not
MicroShaft or Microshit WINDOZE or WINBLOWS

I am a F/OSS enthusiast. But I most certainly prefer referring to products
by their
right name. After all, Micorsoft is not Lord Voldemort (Pardon the old love
for Harry
Potter) to be called That-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named

If your dislike for Microsoft actually is so high that typing the right name
out hurts,
you should take the pain of shifting all your work to Free Software
machines. How did
we all like it when Tuomov Valkonen(Creator of ion wm) call us lusers (linux
users).

The very fact that you involve yourself in too much of policing of this
mailing list wastes
some time that you can spend constructively in developing the missing links
that construe
this dependency on proprietary products.

I may be wrong in saying that policing is bad. But the phrases  "M$ Windoze"
and "Dont
Top/Bottom/Left/Right/Centre/Next-Dimension Post" are a bigger eye-sore and
take
more time filtering away than the actually top post that most modern mail
clients cleverly
fold away

I am a little confused here. Who is 'we'? And why would any sane person strive 
to achieve 'feature parity' with doze? And what is GNU theory? AFAIK hurd is 
still not usable. I personally found linux far easier to use than doze back in 
1995 - and as for 'feature parity' I was under the impression that doze is 
striving for that vis-a-vis linux. In fact, the other day I heard someone say 
that the latest IE is almost as good as firefox!

you are entitled to your opinion, but you are also expected to follow list 
rules. For example you may be of the opinion that we should drive on the right 
side of the road like most of rest of the world - but you are not entitled to 
drive on the right side until such a rule comes into place. Top posting 
interrupts the thread of discussion and is irritating and also against the 
list rules - so I will continue to fight against it.

I certainly agree. Even i don't like windows that much. But I think
instead of doing such things, we can concentrate on a better thing
that is at hand.. Linux.. If we go out and fight with Microsoft or any
other person who thinks high of Windows, we're making a mistake.
There'll be no difference between us and them. We use better Operating
System(s) and we know it. But others may not think so. So we'll be
hurting them in the process of using funny names. Almost all linux
users use linux cuz they've had problems with Windows.. It applies at
least to people i know.. So let us try and educate ppl about linux
instead of cursing microsoft..

It is a first draft and needs improvement --- probably starting with

Hello everyone ,

seems to be another flame in the making........ anyway just wanted to
make it clear that ..... Microsoft Windows( or it being bad) is not
the main reason why "we" use linux( atleast not me, I have never used
windows). So microsoft is not our agenda,  ... as was said in a mail
on the list a month ago, we should talk about FOSS/Linux , rather than
defacing Ms windows.

This is not to suppose that using altered names is defacing. It might
hurt someone's feelings, but mind you it is a common practice on the
web to use altered names to imply sarcasm. So this discussion on
personal conventions/styles seems to be as worthless ( as my reply to
it :-), no hard feelings for anyone !)......

Cheers
Satish

you have been frequently requested to add a brief one liner describing the 
content in english when posting in Tamil. Why are you not doing this? You know 
very well that this list has people from all over the world, and it is very

'We' as in Linux users. Isn't missing applications one of the excuses to use Windows ?
My point was - that is no longer true since Linux has pretty much a complete application
stack.

I don't think we are even arguing here. You do acknowledge that Linux is far superior
to 'doze', but as for HURD, imo, that's a lost cause. :)

Hi 2 all,


           I sincerely thank all the Luggies for their kind support for my
project and nearly half of the project is completed. Now in my project i
have to get the screen co-ordinates/pixel position of image in order to
compare newly entered image from the images in database for redundancy. If
the thumb image is already in database then the new thumb image should not
be accepted and error message should be displayed and if the thumb image is
not in the database then it should be accepted and stored in the database.


           I apologize for any grammatical mistakes and if further details
need to be furnished then please let me know.

Dear luggies,
The fossconf-09 at TCE,Madurai, was successfully conducted.
Highlights
a.Visitors: about 1300 excluding tce students (which may about 500)
b.All talks were well received good attendance(good by our standards >10)
c. Demo stalls this time have upstaged all the previous demo's we have
   conducted. About 10 topics including gcc, shell scripting and commands
   were done by school students  i.e 9th and 11th standard. Two schools
   were involved TVS matriculation school and Srividhyalam Matriculation
   school, Madurai.
   These students performed exceedingly well. 

We slightly changed the prizes that we planned. Here is what we awarded

a.Best project: Tamil spell checker by Selva & team from Jaya Engg College.
                Rs.2000/-
b.Best student speaker: Mr.Anirudh of VIT for talk on virtualisation
                Rs.2000/-
c.Best demo stall to TVS and Srividhyalam Schools. Since TVS school had
   more stalls we awarded
            TVS Matriculation School : Rs.2000
            Srividhyalam School      : Rs.1000
d.An appreciation award (a.k.a party fund) to the TCE organising team
                      Rs.2000

Bharathi will post the contributors to the prize money.

On the whole it was statisfactory, much better organised than last year.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank the management, principal,staff and students of tce for the excellent work they have done. A special thanks to Prof.Shalinie, HOD of CSE TCE.
 
I thank Jaya Engg College - Prof.Kumaran and Students- for major participation - in projects and demo.

I extend thanks to fellow ILUGC members and NRCFOSS team for the success.

Message-ID: <942853.79395.qm@web94615.mail.in2.yahoo.com>


Dear luggies

FossConf-09 is over. Here are somethings I felt bad

a.Powerpoint and Windows based slide show from NRCFOSS. 
b.WiMAX from Bannariamman College. This was on non-free licence. We asked
  them to stop demoing and only talk about concept.
c.Online Insurance from SACS Engg college Madurai, which was on Websphere and DB2. 
  I didn't want to create a scene by asking the (b) and (c) to get out,
as they were innocent students, who really didn't realise the nuances of FOSS. We politely told them to talk about the design, concept, alogorithm etc, duly avoiding the software side.

I apologize for the mistakes. We should have taken more care. We passed on the responsibility to the students team, as TCE team is well aware of FOSS and its philosophy. Anyway no point in blame game, the mistake is a mistake.. Let me accept it. We will be stricter next time. 

However, what pained me most was the NRCFOSS slide thing, and unjustifiable reply on this aspect going on in mailing list. We should learn to come with the right hat for right show. 
Learning to accept our mistakes, introspecting on them will avoid future mistakes. Justifying them will never help.

Once again I apologize,

Raman.P

One suggestion,you could also paste the same in the comments section of the
blog.
The reason i am saying is, there exists a chance that the author may not be

Great slides.  Thanks for putting them up.

I don't maintain the blog but I have a few suggestions:
1. Actively support teams in all States of India in promoting FOSS.
Support would
cover resources to train teachers, providing a
platform(university-level meetings etc)
where we can meet the concerned teachers and convince them.
2. Training of teachers in multiple phases. One time is NOT sufficient.
3. Ensuring that colleges have adequate facilities to implement the subject.
4. For FOSS to develop the local economy must directly be benefited.
This can be
made possible by encouraging newer entrepreneurs and not just already
established ones.
5. Discuss NRCFOSS's plan of action with people doing ground work not just
on the mailing list as the mailing list is only a tool for coordination.
6. NRCFOSS should work as a catalyst keeping the promotion of FOSS as
the primary goal.

In Karnataka we had a "Say NO to VTU-M$ tie-up". It would have been good
had NRCFOSS been an actual signatory apart from verbal support.
We shall be continuing this campaign again and I hope that NRCFOSS will play an
active role.

Nice to hear that, FOSSConf finished successfully. But what I felt bad is, I
could not attend this geat event this time. I congrats all the Linux and
Open Source enthusiasts. I hope the Open Source is moving ahead.

I really disappointed this word from Raman. The motivation of FOSSConf is
not to concentrate like this. I dont know, why you mentioned this issue in
the first. Want to create a big issue? or do you feel this slide hurt you
more?. FYI, The author of this topic, Geetha joined with NRCFOSS recently.
She is not an regular employee of NRCFOSS, as of now and i thing this is the
first talk for her, after she joined with NRCFOSS. None of the regular
NRCFOSS employee are familar with her; Even she did not took a talk for
local people too. I dont like to insist here like, she is correct. Let her
to learn it from her mistake and avoid in future. Otherwise, we will
discourage a beginner/resource person on Ruby from this community. And there
is no use we are discussing about it here, instead of inform it to her. Any
body send a mail to her reg this issue?.

I have few queries here. Suppose a person is interested in a open source
topic, say example Python. She/he dont bother about whether she/he is going
to work in Linux or Windows. Will this open source world accept her/his
work?. Or you will denied?. This is wrong?.

If you say, ya she/he is wrong, then why this open source world allowed to
work all our open source tools in Windows platform like GIMP, Open
Office,.etc?.

And you decided that this is [(a)] big -ve point and mentioned in first. Why
you accepted this topic when she uploaded her .ppt file when she
registered?. You had the option to go through the files/content of the
author's slides before she/he is going to take that topic. But you did not.
A administrator can restrict these issues and the topics Wimax,.etc. Why we
did not restrict them before we prepared the schedule?. I am sure, we did
not yet defined our proper terms & conditions for Projects/demos/talks. Its
some thing like our Administration fault. Not the speaker's mistake.

Personally, I dont thing these are the -ve side. Till now, we people are
doing mistakes and learn it from them. FOSSConf's target audience are very
beginners. There is no meaning, we can expect them immediatly. This is may
be the chance to share their knowledge on technologies side. Who knows, may
be some one can interested to develop a open source equvalent to WiMax,
learn from a non-free license like WiMax.

Apologize is not the solution for -ve points. We have to recetify it. In the
next Fossconf, defined the terms and conditions for Speakers section and add
like should upload the slides in .odp/pdf format. Talks and the contents
should be related to open source.

What about the source code for all project demonstrations? If they upload it
before they attend the fossconf, then I suggest you to add this point into
+ve side and post that link here.
If not, please mention this point as a first point in the -ve side. I have
few T&C in my mind as of now.

My proposed T&C
==============
Project Demos:
* Should be a Open Source license.
* Source code should be available in the internet before participate in
Fossconf and provide that link, while a participant register for project
demo.
* Keep the copy of the source code of that project in project demo.
* What is your discusiion media: IRC/FORUM/MAILING LIST/Others. Please
mention.
* Did you got any internship/sponsers from any company/govern.org/college?.
Mention.
* Already particiapted projects will not be allowed to particiapte again.
They can apply for "Demo stall".
*...

Talks:
=====
* Your talk should be related to open source [I am not sure about it.]
* Your slides should be in .odp or pdf format while you upload.
* Content of the slides should be  from open source environment/tools..
* Define your target audience : Beginners/Intermediates/Experts. So that we
can segregrate them and mentioned about this topic to the audience. I
remember in Fossconf 2008, lots of advanced topics was there.
*...

Demo stall:
=========
* Description of the demonsration.
* Keep the copy of the content of that demonstration like Ubuntu CD
distribtuions.
* What is your discusiion media: IRC/FORUM/MAILING LIST/Others. Please
mention.
* Your demo is like a project/product/open source tools and it is a
sponsered demo?. Mention.
*...

Hello,

I use a CentOS desktop machine with BSNL (DataOne) to access Internet.
I am trying to set up a LAN in my home so that I can access Internet
from my Laptop which runs on Ubuntu 8.10.

But even then, I am not able to ping any outside ip from my laptop. I

FYI, I have regular Redhat Firewall enabled in my CentOS machine. Not
sure if that is creating any problem. Please help.

If you are in a Python Conference, they really don't care whether it is 
.ppt or .pdf (unless they themselves insist on some format). But it 
happened during **fossconf** and the format of the presentation was not 
an acceptable one in that situation.

Well the problem is not using a Windows machine actually, the problem is 
the slide show was made using MS Power Point. This is why wise men make 
their presentations as PDF at least to avoid embarrassment.

If am not wrong, Raman apologized for not taking care of this. Am sure, 
even the person in question might fail to take their lesson but senior 
members would be careful next time.

Well the blame game is going to take us nowhere. As Raman said, mistake 
has been done, lessons learnt and everything will be kept in mind from 
now on.

An apology is way to show that you care and it indeed means a lot for 
you, though it got missed/messed. Instead of passing the ball around he 
has taken the responsibility and apologized. It's done and let's 
appreciate it and move on.

No even disabling the firewall does not help. And, I have kept selinux

Yes. I also agree that, in fossconf it wont accept from the speaker. But we
accepted them to uploaded their .ppt slides. This issue claims that the
mistake is also from our side. Allowed them and finally blamed only them is
meaning less.

I have no more words here for why she uploaded .ppt files here. Instead, I
interested to know about WHY THIS OPEN SOURCE WORLD ALLOWED TO EXECUTE ALL
OUR OPEN TOOLS IN WINDOWS PLATFORM INSTEAD OF ONLY IN LINUX & GIVING OPTION
TO WORK ALSO IN WINDOWS?.
So that, we can pass the info like dont use WAMP; Use only LAMP,.etc.

You probably used tabs instead of spaces! As it turns out it may not
matter.

This output shows that it is "ppp0" which is your WAN port. This
seems likely since PPP-over-Ethernet is the way in which most BSNL
DataOne links work.

This means that your outgoing port is ppp0 *not* eth0. 

Secondly, (but less importantly) how did you pick 192.52.x.x as your LAN
IP address? I don't think this is a good idea. What if there is a
machine on the internet with an address in this range to which you
want to connect? You should only use the "LAN only" IP addresses like
192.168.x.x for your lan. Something like 192.168.7.x/255.255.255.0
should be adequate for your LAN.

Kapil.

First, I was no way involved with the conference, so I can't speak for 
somebody who was responsible. But, remember someone has come forward, 
accepted the responsibility and even apologized for it.

Second, nobody is blaming anyone here. He just took the liberty to 
mention the mistakes, which was actually done on the organizers end, 
just to let people know what needs to be kept in mind the next time.

I would kindly request you not to shout in the mailing list, even if you 
wanted to stress on something very much.

Secondly, there is a transition process for people who are for years 
used to working with proprietary OS and Softwares. The process is you 
first give them tools you use in day-to-day life and once they're 
comfortable with it, you change the OS on which they work. This helps 
them not being thrown into too much of wilderness.

Secondly, we respect the freedom of choice by people. They might be 
interested in using FOSS softwares but due to certain reasons might be 
pinned down to a proprietary OS for time being. Neglecting such users 
completely serves no purpose of letting them appreciate the benefits of 
FOSS. Thus, a lot of FOSS softwares also have support for Windows and Mac.

Thirdly, which is much similar to the first point, people might like to 
have an idea of how good FOSS softwares are before they move away from a 
Proprietary OS and Software completely. Under such cases, having FOSS 
softwares serves the purpose of giving them a taste of freedom without 
getting  them into too much uncomfortable environment.

Again, I would like to remind that the problem was using both a 
proprietary format using a proprietary software as well as using 
proprietary operating system (and not just the latter one).

 I would also like to reiterate, having been in NRCFOSS myself, that 
they need to have an internal awareness program for new people joining 
NRCFOSS as many of them tend to be not from a FOSS background and 
occasionally with no clue of FOSS. (Well, said in the best interests of 
NRCFOSS).

Your are forgetting very important point i.e NRCFOSS.
It is National Resource Centre for Free and Open Source Software
paid out of taxpayers money, to promote FOSS not individuals.
It is acceptable even if an ILUGC volunteer has done it, because 
it is only voluntary. Whereas anything from NRCFOSS has a duty I repeat DUTY to promote FOSS, not just interest in technical subject.

I think that ensuring that Universities are convinced of the necessity of FOSS
should be a mandate of NRCFOSS. In Karnataka, we have a situation where
we need to convince VTU to implement  FOSS in education. This requires the
training of teachers. The training of teachers would come under the category
of 'human resource development'. How can NRCFOSS help us with this?

You need to install the apache2-xxx-dev package with xxx replaced by
"prefork" or "threaded" according as which apache2 version you have
installed on your system.

A useful tool to find packages containing files is "apt-file" or the
online version at packages.debian.org. (The second search field).

Of course, these tools would not work directly for you since the
available binary is called /usr/bin/apxs2 since it is for apache2.
(After the package is installed it probably creates a link called
/usr/bin/apxs; this could be considered a bug in apt-file or p.d.org).

Kapil.

You need the "apache-dev" deb installed.  Note apache-dev places
this file in /usr/bin, and not /usr/sbin.

You can search deb package listings using the search
facility on the bottom of this page:

You can use gcc for ARM.

Choose the target hardware first. The products usually ship with

I think that you should not come to these conclusions just from your
interactions with a
couple of people on online groups and/or by attending the recent
meeting at Bangalore.
The Free Software Movement or FOSS movement in Karnataka has been
making a lot of
progress and much before my tenure at NRCFOSS.

This needs further assessment.

That is right. But do I need to mention anything for this in my LAN
machine? Currently I have set the gateway of LAN machine(s) as the LAN
ip of my gateway machine.

Yes that was a mistake. Somehow I thought 192.52.* is also a private
IP address! Now I have changed the LAN IP as 10.0.0.1. Actually in
this context it is little complex. My CentOS desktop has two private
addresses. eth0 is connected to the BSNL modem which creates the
network 192.168.1.* and eth1 is connected to LAN with the network
10.0.0.*. But when I start the pppd daemon, bsnl assigns another
dynamic public ip to eth0. So essentially eth0 will have two ip
addresses when Internet is up. But even now I am not able to solve
this problem.

Thank you for your kind response.

Hi,

There are 2 solutions apart from iptables:

1. Hardware solution: Buy a hub (~ Rs. 600 for 8 port I think - dont remember exactly but very cheap) and connect both machines to this. You will have to set them to DHCP and they will get LAN IPs from hub. This way you can add more machines and also will not have issues with any protocol.
You can also buy a wireless router which you can plug either to your BSNL modem or the (new) hub - that will give you wireless internet.
I have BSNL in my house and they have given me a wireless router - we use 2 laptops(wifi) and a desktop(Lan cable) in our house.

2. Software solution: Run squid on CentOS. It is a fairly easy install and will also provide caching - this will improve your browsing experience.
If you are able to ping the Internet from CentOS, just load and configure squid (~1-2 steps) and configure the proxy in your Ubuntu.
Squid will also help in terms of content filtering, access control, log of sites visited.....
Squid will not help with ftp - there used to be a ftp-proxy sometime back. You might have to configure ftp in iptables - which is again a pain.

Let me know if you run into issues.

I wouldn't recommend iptables as they are pretty complicated even for experienced admins.

I do not see any change of topic from Raaman's reply. I even requested to

That is different calling for suggestion. Well I have given many already to
him, even during fossconf-09.

But still NRCFOSS as a team doesn't seem to realise the folly and with this attitude  the public money pumped may become waste.

The motivation of Fossconf ( though I could not attend it ) is to
enocurage people to use FOSS and obviously a presentation made on a
proprietary software is not acceptable. I agree that it be conveyed to
the person who did the presentation and be rectified. I have no idea ,
why you are taking an apology mail from raman to a personal level(
which is clearly visible in the above section_), please don do this.

As it has already mentioned , it is not a conference related to a
technology which is platform neutral ( like python), ... rather it has
been named "FOSSCONF" ( if you could read).

You are confusing yourselves and probably other newbies on the list
with two entirely different aspects. FOSSCONF is different , it is a
"conference for FOSS.", where as providing windows compatible open
source software is entirely different. Please understand this ...

Raman did not say it is the speaker's mistake , he was talking about
entirely different things, again don't take it personally, .......

 yes agree that apologizing is not the "only" solution, I really
appreciate the tips you have given. But we should on the list
appreciate the fact that Raman came out to apoligize for the mishaps
and took responsibility for them. Couldn't you have given the tips in
a more plainer language ??

I clearly missed your point here ( there must be something very

crap , you don't really understand FOSS or the Open Source principles
is it ??, Windows or Linux is immaterial to the use of the *AMP stack,

Do you have prior experience in Programming hardware? Else I would
suggest you start with smaller MicroController and get used to
programming hardware first and gradually go up the ladder. Starting
with ARM is not exactly something I would recommend/suggest.

Sample code? There is always the standard Hello World that you can
write and try it out to see your setup is working fine. Limitations of
the compiler is very abstract thing. It depends on a lot of factors
and unless you want to dig deep into tool chain development and stuff,
I don't think one generally need to worry at this factor (especially
if you are just beginning to do embedded development)

You can check out http://fpga4u.epfl.ch/wiki/FPGA4U_Description (it
costs about 4500 INR and also with additional cost of say 1000 INR you
get an ARM board extension) You can do a lot of stuff with this
student board. Not a promotion, but I can try to get one down if you
need it when I come to India (I am not confirming it though as I need
to check with a lot of folks)

Please find correction below.....



Hi,

There are 2 solutions apart from iptables:

1. Hardware solution: Buy a hub (~ Rs. 600 for 8 port I think - dont remember exactly but very cheap) and connect both machines to this. You will have to set them to DHCP and they will get LAN IPs from hub. This way you can add more machines and also will not have issues with any protocol.
You can also buy a wireless router which you can plug either to your BSNL modem or the (new) hub - that will give you wireless internet.
I have BSNL in my house and they have given me a wireless router - we use 2 laptops(wifi) and a desktop(Lan cable) in our house.

Correction: You don't get the LAN IPs from hub - what I meant was that you will get the IPs from modem but connecting via hub is equivalent to connecting directly to modem.

Having not attended the lecture (or followed any earlier communication about

you explain in a few sentences what the talk was about?

Hi,
I gave my feedback in http://www.fossconf.in/feedback, I stated something
like "some people in NRC foss used proprietary ppt slides".

After 10 minutes i got a private mail from Mr.Kenneth Gonsalves
asking that "how many of the numerous nrcfoss people's slides were in ppt
format?"


Then i replied "As far as i know its 1"

Again in 10 mins i got another mail from Mr.kenneth Gonsalves

"wow! you know how to count?? do you also know that 'people' is plural? So
when
you said nrcfoss people are producing proprietary slides you are telling
lies?
yes or no? or *has someone paid you to do propaganda*?"

Then i apologized for using plural there "some people"  and sent him a mail.

"Well, i apologize for the plural.

Why don't you accept and apologize for using a silde which is in proprietary
format?
Your are a really sick person.who has to pay me to expose something bad?
Is NRCFOSS worth it?"

He kept spamming me until i stopped :(

Is this a way they accept feedback? These guys are out of control.
They have not no culture, they dont even have the courage to apologize.
So if you people send any feedback there dont criticise NRC-FOSS, otherwise
Mr.Kenneth Gonsalves will spam you in private.

Regards
Arun SAG

I am curious to know how much copies of microsoft powerpoint bought by
NRCFOSS till this day. Probably obtaining this answer may be helpful in
giving a ball pot  of how many slides would have been produced [It is not a
good assumption that having bought say X=(assuming 5) copies of microsoft
office  to produce one slide presentation].Again approaching the issue
instead of taking it personal is  much appreciated.

Actually this solved the problem. I just replaced all eth0 with ppp0
in my previous commands. And it started working. I had to make the LAN
interface as trusted device in the gateway machine though. For some
strange reason "Trusted devices" option has been disappeared from
"System -> Administration -> Security Level and Firewall" in CentOS 5.
Fortunately this particular option was available in the text mode
equivalent (system-config-securitylevel-tui). I can now connect to
Internet from my laptop with other regular firewalls being enabled.
Thank you very much for your help.

Thank you for your suggestion. As I have already posted in the other
thread that I could finally make it work. So I'll perhaps keep this
experiment in abeyance for some time. But yes your ideas seem to be
interesting. Maybe I'll try it sometime.

Thank you.

It addresses the "essence" or basic concepts in embedded systems in a

Huh,

There is a possibility that the presenter would have prepared the
presentation using OO but saved it as ppt for inter-compatibility
reasons.

Still that could have avoided.

zero copies.  (of course,  au-kbc has its own MS Office copies).

Yes. Mr.Thyagarajan. He mentioned about the importance and duty of NRCFOSS.
Sorry, I did not defined the importance and duty of NRCFOSS. The right
person is here,
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2009-March/046701.html

I guess, you are the person asked the RTI for NRCFOSS activities, early?.
May be 6 months back i think. I am not sure. Its somthing like, you are
knocking the door for oppertunity. Whenever the door opened, no one is come
in-front for discussion. This time also he replied. I am eagerly waiting for
how many people will response for his reply. Coz this March, NRCFOSS going
to switch over into 2nd phase. I hope, FOSS will helpful to improve our
education here. I am seeing, a ITI fellow learnt a single subject and
creating a workshop by his own. But a engineering student learning 57
subjects in 4 years and finally he cant able to create a single job for him.
Finally he is ready to work without salary also.

Reg the blog, I accept all your thoughts. if his/her thought is right, then
he/she should disclose her/his name first. No need to reply for any
annoynomus blogs. In India, every Indian have the rights to ask questions.
Because as Raman told, we [include me] paid our TAX money and NRCFOSS
running by our tax money. Any one can apply for RTI. If ILUG is feel we did
not nothing; Then you can come here & discuss about how we can do further
reg the FOSS promotion. Prof is ready to discuss. But no one is ready here.

as a member of NRCFOSS , and presumably with some responsibility for our
team, I apologise for the use of powerpoint in geetha's presentation.

attn.: prakash : i agree with your statement that she is new to our team,
but the collective responsibility is ours. i don't think your long
justification/argument is necessary. i am sorry that i am saying so in a
public mailing list. we are working in an open source environment where the
bugs could be pointed out, accepted that they exist, and weeded out. Let us
take into our stride the periodic comments about tax payers' money and
responsibility, etc. We have to take the correct path -- not because of we
are "bonded" to FOSS as members of NRCFOSS, but because we are committed to
FOSS as much as any other FOSS enthusiast. It is a matter of freedom and
responsibility.

Each of us may have our own views and methodologies about FOSS promotion,
and use of proprietary software. The point here is, the occasion is fossconf
-- our own event to show case FOSS. Can't we say what we want to say with
FOSS tools alone?

Srinivasan, NRCFOSS.

 I have already posted about this topic before FOSSconf. And in a thread I
remember that, the project demonstration should be available in the internet
for public access. My intention is, if the project will be available to
download for public, other students and enthusiast can utilize the code and
enhance the projects.

Yes. Its our choice. She selected the WAMP and took some screen shots and
added it her slides. We cant say dont use WAMP; Instead we could not allowed
the author to take/continue the talk.
We can start a another thread and argue, whether I under stand the concept

The tutorial at http://www.bravegnu.org/arm-prog/arm-prog.html describes ARM
programming with the GNU Toolchain. The tutorial also shows how the programs can
be tested in an ARM system simulated using Qemu. Note that the tutorial is under
development and this is just a draft version.

Dear Mr.Prakash,

>>I guess, you are the person asked the RTI for NRCFOSS activities, early?.
May be 6 months back i think. I am not sure. Its somthing like, you are
knocking the door for oppertunity.

Yes, i am the same person, I who  wrote mail to Prof.CNK. I expressed my
Anguish with Prof. CNK by then. I do agree and apologize , i cant find time
in pursing in RTI intention .

>> Whenever the door opened, no one is come in-front for discussion.

You must be aware we are doing foss activity as a voluntary gesture not a
commitment duty which is assigned to you, i would further reiterate that you
have the moral responsibility in reaching us, rather than expecting us to
reach your desk because  we are confined by paramaters like 'time' .IMO,  A
common ground to discuss this will be across the table in the canteen of IIT
after our monthly meet, more friendlier and open hearted discussion. After
all we are fellow fossians and not enemies..

>>From Arun: If you keep irritating people with bad questions like this for
pointing out something bad Who will come forward and disclose his/her name?
First i am asking you can you answer publicly what he/her mentioned on that
blog?

I understand the above point by corroborating with my past and hope many in
the list will agree with me that when luggers question NRCFOSS, i see a
state of denial from the TEAM NRCFOSS, and instead of talking about the
issue, we are vehimently targetted personally.So, my life proceeds doing
FOSS activity by making the first and foremost condition that all my
activity will have no association with NRCFOSS unless i see a visible change
in the  team's attitude.

>>From Srinivasn Soundrarajan ...as a member of NRCFOSS , and presumably
with some responsibility for our team, I apologise for the use of powerpoint
in geetha's presentation.

i read a quote some where
"An apology is a good way to have the last word".  ~Author Unknown

There were 8 talks by NRC-FOSS people at the conference. *One* talk had ppt 
slides. *All* the others used foss tools for presentation. Yet the accusations 
on the list are 'NRC-FOSS people are using proprietary tools for 
presentation'. One person != people. If it had been correctly stated that 
*one* person had used ppt, I would have immedietly apologised on behalf of 
NRC-FOSS and the matter would have been closed. But when people knowing that 
only one person did this still distort facts by using the plural, I am 
entitled to read some ulterior motive in this.

Does it makes any sense in recruiting peoples who has no FOSS background for
FOSS development ?

NRCFOSS has been promoting FOSS for a long while among the colleges isn't
it ? why don't they recruit students who are well trained in FOSS ?

because the budget is not enough to pay the salaries that they can get outside 
- and even the people we train leave the moment they get a good job. And they 
all get good jobs as there is a good market for people well trained in FOSS. 
In the new phase we have some more budget for salaries, so we hope to get 
better people.

if you don't want your settings, you can try renaming ~/.mozilla to
something else. if the problem was with your profile, this would fix it

I agree with you, sir. We have to instruct them before they uploaded the
presentation.  I discussed with her reg this issue. She prepared her in OO;
But saved as a ppt format.
And upto my knowledge, in NRCFOSS we dont have any interaction with new
comers reg how to follow the FOSS culture. I discussed with her reg this
issue. She prepared her in OO; But saved as a ppt format. I would like to
clear them that, we dont have any idea to irritate the FOSS culture and
FOSSConf objectives.

I have been with NRCFOSS since 2006 April. Till now we did not discuraged
any LUG communities in FOSS promotion and we would also like to interact
with them reg the FOSS promotion. We are always like to interact with LUG in
all the workshop. Raman & Bharathi know well about it. But I am seeing, for
last 2 years, whenever we participated & doing some workshops along with
ILUG-C communitiy people, they are always talking about TAX and irrtate
NRCFOSS members. I have noted down this activity from Raman itself, in
Trichy, Anna university, trip. This activites wont helpful for us to
encarage the FOSS promotion along with ILUGC. I dont know, why they are
targetting NRCFOSS members instead of NRCFOSS org?.

Upgrading Firefox to stable version may solve the problem.

I generally avoid reading too much meaning in honest and frank comments.
However, doesn't one get a feeling that a volunteer is "free" and the
employee is "bonded" and should "report"?

Which issues have been avoided? There can be and will be difference of
opinion how one contributes to FOSS. Can you please elaborate on the "state
of denial from the TEAM NRCFOSS"? I do recall that one issue you had raised
was given a response -- not a denial but statement of facts.

As to the "targetted personally" -- why are you attributing to "Team
NRCFOSS"? haven't we seen enough flame wars and nasty comments, and
considered them as coming from individuals rather than "Team LUG"?

So, my life proceeds doing

You are entitled to your personal opinion and judgement. My personal feeling
is that you are wrong in your judgement -- most likely due to insufficient
data at your disposal. As for lack of "time", everyone has one's own time
constraints.

thanks -- of course, the apology has to be sincere, and I do hope you take

Here, the individual has no unlimited freedom. You are representing an organisation. You should abide by the motive of the organisation. Had she simply prsented as Ms.X, the issue is different, but she represents NRCFOSS and NRCFOSS is part of the organisors. There is no use in preaching without practicing. 

We didn't stop her or ask her to get out, as we are still civilised people.

thanks a bunch for giving ammunition to "NRCFOSS" bashers. Again, I suppose,
the fault is mine. I presume we are in a collaborative and interactive mode
of working -- unfortunately, there seems to be a need for "guided"
collaboration.

You and I are members of ILUG-C. We are as much LUGgies as anybody else. As
part of our official NRCFOSS duties, we organize events where we involve
members from FOSS Community (includes LUGs across the country, FOSS experts
/ users who are not LUG members, and others). Eventually, it boils down to
the efforts of the individual who has taken the responsibility of
coordinating a particular event -- be it Raman or Srinivasan or Prakash --
to reach out to potential collaborators and get things going.

As I pointed out in my earlier mail, I wouldn't like to attribute adverse
comments or acts of errots from individuals to the entire group. Of course,
we all have "freedom" to think in our own way.

Srinivasan.

You mean, a person cant work for FOSS development suppose he/she dont have
any FOSS background before he/she entered into a org?.

Why not?

Pros:
1. No one searching for help on a particular Win(dows|doze|blows) issue
will have to selectively filter out the ilugc archives.

Cons:
1. None! It is easy to see that it's Micro(soft|shaft|shit) and its
products that are being referred to.
2. None! Operating Systems don't have feelings.

Seems to me Kenneth is preserving signal-to-noise.

Dear Mr.Srinivasan Soundrarajan


>>Which issues have been avoided? There can be and will be difference of
opinion how one contributes to FOSS. Can you please elaborate on the "state
of denial from the TEAM NRCFOSS"? I do recall that one issue you had raised
was given a response -- not a denial but statement of facts.

So i can expect some facts as well to
http://annauniv-tamilnadu.blogspot.com/2009/01/nrcfoss-are-you-there_30.htmlfrom
your NRCFOSS capacity , open discussion in this mail.

ARUN , myself and many others here  are seeking an answer, for our knowledge
sake , please dont throw this mail because of the anonimity of the author

Because the "students" you mentioned are more interested in securing a 
job in one of the big IT MNCs or going abroad than working in NRCFOSS. I 
had never seen an application from the "student" you mentioned above 
till I was in NRCFOSS. Have you applied there? Are you ready to work 
there? Look at a mirror and answer the question yourselves before asking 
it to others.

That is the whole trouble, people like you and others work for a short time 
for 10-12 K per month and then go off to earn lakhs ;-) I know of only two 
people who willingly worked for lesser pay because of their dedication to 
FOSS. And even they could not sustain.

dear friend:
0. am not sure how much you are into FOSS and how much knowledgeable you are
about mailing group etiquettes.

before you are flamed about trying to hijack a thread (unless somebody had
already done so), please allow me to make a few comments :
1. you could have started a new mail thread -- request for BOSS DVD.
2. I am often told that BOSS (and its "originator" C-DAC) are not exactly in
the good books of many of LUG and FOSS members.
3. anyway, you could have done a google search (or even now search for CDAC
or visit http://nrcfoss.org.in ) and get to know what you want (hence my
comment '0' above).
4. of course, I can give you the possible contact  point, but I am not
giving it in this mail for two reasons
    a) i hope you will be careful in future about hijacking threads -- apart
from the emotions involved, there is a practical aspect : people who could
have answered might have missed the mail because of wrong header.
    b) i can give you a better answer if you let me know which is your
geographical location.

please send a mail to srini DOT it AT gmail DOT com   so that I can respond
to you.

with best wishes, Srinivasan.

LinuXpert Systems too has taken huge efforts in promoting FOSS in education (especially in colleges)
since 2003 and also seen good results in foss promotion.

Since the attitude (especially in the current thread) seems to be "We the
LUG againt You the NRCFOSS", I don't think it make sense for me to open
discussion in my NRCFOSS capacity.

The thread could well be named  *nrcfoss - negative side* instead of*
**fossconf-09-negative
side*. I don't think the vociferous members have understood the feelings of
Prakash and others who happen to be working at NRCFOSS.  If they come out of
NRCFOSS, will they become "purified"?

I disagree with Raman : simply being a volunteer doesn't absolve one from
the responsibilities nor does working for an organization "funded by tax
payers" (sic)  thrusts a load of  absolute responsibilities on the
individual. In reality, it depends on the individual, his/her status /
involvement in the organisation and other related factors. A faux pas by
Raman or Thiagarajan  will have more adverse impact on the perception about
Chennai LUG than an ordinary LUG member -- though all of them are only
volunteers.

Some (of I hope not many) will also be looking askance at me -- not only I
am from NRCFOSS, I am now going off from AU-KBC to join C-DAC Chennai. Does
it going to change my attitude towards FOSS? It might, of course, have an
impact on the type of FOSS activities I undertake. However, by the tone of
the exchanges in this group, I shouldn't be surprised if I become an outcast
in the eyes of some of you -- not that the number was non-zero. (do we
remember Prashant Mohan, GoSc ?).  Not that I claim to be in their league,
but we have many active members contributing to FOSS who have jobs at
proprietary companies.

In response to the blog, Kenneth had given a msg on behalf of Prof CNK --
which you guys don't seem to care much about.

Some of the points -- I had raised before joining NRCFOSS (when I knew
pretty litle about FOSS). But you seem to think that NRCFOSS is a wizard who
could change things by a wave of wand. I do have some comments and
suggestions, and even queries -- will put them out in a day or two (before I
take up my new posting!!!).

I think you are wrong in saying that no college opt for FOSS as Jaya
College has been taking up that elective last few years and now
Rajalakshmi Engg. College has 130 students who have taken up this
elective.



Adopting FOSS is equivalent to telling a smoking person to leave
smoking habit which is difficult but not impossible. Change will occur
gradually.



> why don't they(NRCFOSS) recruit students who are well trained in FOSS?

I think Dr. Srinivasan will be better person to answer this.

That is why I tendered apology from organising side. I never blamed NRCFOSS, I was only pained. 
But the tone from both KG and Prakash set the thread unnecessarily personal, instead of tackling issue at large. Even now I have nothing against any individual. It is my wish that NRCFOSS achieves its slated objective - which is similar to that of any LUG.

And I stop here.

      Yes, we have the  Thiagarajar College of Engg.as well. And FOSS
is a part of curriculum at TCE.

Myself interested in the following things in future:

[1] Avoid to talk about NRCFOSS activities, duties and all about its
official issues to any one of NRCFOSS member in future. But any one can ask
about NRCFOSS progress to our Project co-ordinator. He is ready to answer
for you. Hope all you got this mail,
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2009-March/046701.html
[2] Do not irritate NRCFOSS members at any workshops while we/you organize a
workshop in future.
[3] After the LUG & nrcofss organized/conducted workshop, please dont say
NRCFOSS did nothing.
[4] Still you have controversy with NRCFOSS, please arrange a face-to-face
discussion and plan according to that. Personally, I am not interested to
any type of controversy with any one.

I am also stop here.

Hi all,

IMHO most of the curriculum offered as FOSS is counter productive
based on a outdated syllabus.It didnt help in moving people to Linux
and for even people who were introduced to Linux it was tiresome.

In this regard Government of tamilnadu has introduced some basic linux
course as part of 11 , 12 class computer science. What i learnt from
some of the students studying it they havent seen a linux machine.They
just have a perception that linux is a black console where you can
execute commands such as ls ,cp.
With the minimal thrust given by school in teaching computers (as they
are not counted for the cut off) it is better to be ignorant rather
than misinformed :) .

P.S :I managed to show them my personal Linux box to few students more
than that the faculty are also ignorant in this regard .

The elective mode, in a sense, came due to the university regulations --if i
remember correctly, in Anna University, a new subject has to be introduced
first as an elective.

The first FOSS elective CS1023 Free/Open Source Software was introduced in
2005-06. It has been widely agreed that it needs significant revision.

The second elective "CS1024 Enterprise Application Development using FOSS"  has
been found to be more acceptable.

The two autonomous colleges -- TCE and PSG have come up with their own
versions of FOSS electives. The syllabus, course materials, etc. are
available at :
http://nrcfoss.org.in/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=38&Itemid=69

Please visit http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/FossElectives
or http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/FossElectivesSyllabus
to give your comments / suggestions re updation of the two Anna Univ
electives.

Do we have any chance to make this paper as a compulsory?

I got the syllabus from IT Dept HOD, CSI polytechnic, Salem. They have one
compulsory paper on open source includes php, Mysql, Apache and they have a
separate lab includes C programming, Shell programming and some linux system
calls. The HOD told, their university planing to convert all the proprietary
s/w into open source.

FOSS and GNU/Linux are two lessons for 9th std in our school for the past 4
year. [ max of 6 classes, how is it sufficient ? ]
Also it is part of 11th Std. syllabus.
Difficult to depart "Windows" from them. [ Why to Depart ? let them learn
basic concepts on their known/easy/simple way ]


When I visited few governments school, students are using OpenOffice, Games
and fascinated by nice Screen Savers. Few of them try Shell commands too. 

Do you know, if the Physics , Chemistry and Maths teachers want to conduct
Special classes for the students, they request Computer teachers to announce
a "Special Class". You can expect more than 90% attendance. Then start with
"Physic/ chemistry / maths " special classes, after that they move to
computer science special classes. [the rural schools ]

The awareness on GNU/linux among the Matriculation and City based schools
are considerable. 


We can analyze many points on education system, interest, etc..

Let us continue to project the message  "freedom in software" clearly to the
students community.

A sincere Thanks to all the members of this list, which helps me to continue
my learning

> It is my wish that NRCFOSS achieves its slated objective - which is similar

this is the root of the confusion. The objective of NRC-FOSS is far more 
limited than the objective of a LUG. For example, a LUG can agitate against or 
object to a University signing an MOU with a proprietary software company, 
NRC-FOSS cannot. A LUG can oppose software patents, NRC-FOSS cannot. The list 
is endless. 

the second point that is to be noted that in the 1st Phase of MRC-FOSS, there 
were 2 organisations involved - CDAC, Chennai and AU-KBC Chromepet. The tasks, 
method of functioning etc were different. In the 2nd phase, there are *eight* 
organisations involved. Please keep that in mind when talking about NRC-FOSS.

thirdly, in the mail that started this thread it was stated that 'NRC-FOSS 
made a powerpoint presentation'. This is not correct, and please note for 
future reference, only Professor Krishnan officially represents NRC-FOSS at AU-
KBC - all other presentations are made by individual NRC-FOSS employees. This 
is a fact well known to leading members of ILUGC. If Mr Raman had stated that 
'an employee of NRC-FOSS presented a power point presentation' it would have 
been ok. 

fourthly, the slides were in ppt format and presumably being shown using 
openoffice - all the organisers had to do was to spend 10 seconds to convert the 
same to an open format. And spend 1 minute educating a newbie to foss about 
open formats. Did anyone do this? Or did anyone contact the large number of 
NRC-FOSS employees present - including me, prof Srinivasan and the Coordinator 
Professor Krishnan regarding this?

Prof Srinivasan has apologised - but I do not think he was right in doing so. 
This was a small mistake made by a newbie to FOSS - not an attack by $bill. I 
do not apologise for this. I feel that this is being used as a stick by people 
to beat up on NRC-FOSS.

The next point is: what is FOSS? In my opinion, if the code passes the test of 
4 freedoms, it is FOSS regardless of platform, programming language and media 
of presentation. If you look at the presentations made in linux.conf.au for 
example, you will find that at least 1/3rd of them are made with Mac or doze. I 
have given 2 talks in Ilugc meets, one talk in fossconf08 and many talks 
across the country using Mac. Mr Raman attended both my talks at ilugc - he 
did not object.

And this RTI bullshit. Thiagarajan and his friends keep sending mails here 
accusing NRC-FOSS of various things. They have no time to substantiate their 
idiotic allegations and no time or money to petition the RTI folks. They also 
cannot afford the bus fare to Chromepet to come and inspect the records. They 
are free to come anytime and check out everything, But they have to pay for 
the bus/train fare.

and as for Mr Raman's statement that he is 'pained' - NRC-FOSS does not have a 
medical unit - but usually aspirin relieves pain.

not suprising a reply from your end in your own language. Whether we have

can you please give a vivid explanation to that anna -university blog..
that blog echoes much of a foss loving guyz sentiments.

I  never expect any sponsorship from NRCFOSS nor any government

Hi !

True !

When the discussions  is about a plate being half full or half empty , then
there is no end to it !
Because both are right !

I wish ....

1) NRC FOSS staff could have avoided the issue .It is like serving mutton
biriyani for poor on Gandhi jayanthi . Good intentions but badly done.
2) LUGC members could have taken it in the stride - mentioned it but not
make an issue of it .
3) NRC FOSS representatives could have accepted the slip and assured that
they will take such things.
4)LUGC members could have avoided playing one-up on each other and convert
it to a flame war.

   Exactly. Even in the previous FOSSConf, a few talks(though not
NRC-FOSS) used Windows and Powerpoint. But no one took serious
exceptions to that. I don't know why people give so much importance to
this. The main purpose of identifying the negatives should be for
improving ourselves; not  to indulge in flaming.

I reckon this would be the one of the right places to start.

When a ignorant n00b starts to learn a bit of programming, some colleges
show them tc as the sole place to try out.

He/She remains ignorant of the other wonderful alternatives.

Exposing them to FOSS while they are young in academics tends to be more
productive.

I've long been stumped by this question when I try to talk
students into FOSS.

How does a career in FOSS fare holistically?

The other day amachu told me about entrepreneurship.

Thought I could do with more gyaan.

Could someone please enlighten me?

Free in Free Software is primarily 'free' as in 'freedom' and not
always 'free beer'. :-). So the question of 'jail of paid software'
may not always be appropriate. There are free softwares that you need
to pay for. We need to congratulate the effort to give people all the
freedom with softwares.

the problem could have been solved in 1 minute - stop the talk, click 'file', 
click 'save as', click on fileype and select an open format, click 'ok' and 
restart the talk. Inside of beating our breasts and apologising, all we need 
to do is note this point down and see that the hall marshalls follow the 
procedure next time.

Putting an Eligibilty criteria in a Government body that only those

discrimination.

Private bodies can do such things saying IIT/ REC geeks can only apply etc.,

whereever I can I will, else I request others to tolerate.. It is not
my inbound duty..

People joining this list beware that posts will also be Tamil, the
language of the state of Tamilnadu and tolerate and co-operate or
learn Tamil.

I appeal all Tamil people, also to post in Tamil.  Yesterday I was
alone and Padhu, Thanigai, Arun and few more have joined now :-)

I expect more and more people join this initiative so that  ten-twenty
five years down the line we can dream the other way..

A decade back the situation was different and now its totally different..

At the risk of sounding pessimistic, have you made an effort of
counting the number of people you are ignoring/alienating on the list
by this? Please don't misconstrue this as my lack of affinity for my
mother tongue, but it is just that forcing it on people doesn't sound
right to me. Of course, you are entitled to your view, so you needn't
really care about mine.

If, you are using the list to carry forward any agenda other than
FOSS, I wish to protest, though I can't stop or prevent you from doing
this.

GLUG of TCE trained thous school students show some of the FOSS
Softwares to public. The TVS Students are trained to show Blender and
Shell Scripting. Sri Vidyalam students are trained to show GCC.  They
all started just 3 Days before the conference. But with-in the period,
they are able to show live demo of 4 to 5 samples in each topic.

During valedictory function, students requested us to make the
FossConf into 4 days. But we are thinking of making it into 2 Days :)

As a old-students of one of school, Plz send an appreciation letter to
your school about this activity. I hope, this will give some kind
enthu to management to continue this kind of efforts.

Bye :)

I actually felt like saying "language fanaticism out of this list" :|

We welcome someone asking a question in Tamil if he feels (s)he can 
express his/her problem better that way (and somebody will translate it 
in English for him/her). That doesn't mean you can use Tamil as the 
language of this mailing list, it is still English and I hope it 
continues to do so.

Thanks VN :)

I feel, this discussion is going away from the interest of the ILUGC.
Now there is no point in fighting/discussing about the mistake, which
is already happened, and asking how it happened, why, and explaining
what happened, etc., This is an opportunity to understand and correct
OUR mistakes. Move on...

STOP. Don't reply to this thread.

Another request is not to criss cross between languages as it never conveys
the right message to even people knowing both the languages. " IIT 'Komban*'
* " for example.

I never thought you intended to mean a geek with word 'Komban'. IMO 'Komban'
is rude and geek is not. Its upto tam-team for finding a right word for
geek.

did you really ask the students to stop demoing and even thought of asking them to leave? that is very unfortunate unless there were strict guidelines that was previously communicated to the speakers. When you say 'civilized' that includes treating guest speakers with respect and dignity. I don't suppose we need a linux moral police :-)

[Ilugc] fossconf-09-negative side

Dear luggies

FossConf-09 is over. Here are somethings I felt bad

a.Powerpoint and Windows based slide show from NRCFOSS. 
b.WiMAX from Bannariamman College. This was on non-free licence. We asked
  them to stop demoing and only talk about concept.
c.Online Insurance from SACS Engg college Madurai, which was on Websphere and DB2. 
  I didn't want to create a scene by asking the (b) and (c) to get out,
as they were innocent students, who really didn't realise the nuances of FOSS. We politely told them to talk about the design, concept, alogorithm etc, duly avoiding the software side.

I apologize for the mistakes. We should have taken more care. We passed on the responsibility to the students team, as TCE team is well aware of FOSS and its philosophy. Anyway no point in blame game, the mistake is a mistake.. Let me accept it. We will be stricter next time.

Please re-read my mail.  We have clearly communicated at the time of registration. Also the students of tce spoke to each demoers and asked them about the project. Everybody said that their project is on open source. Probably they that anything that can be downloaded is foss.

Well it is not moral policing, this is foss promotion event.

this is not the Linux Users Group of the State of Tamilnadu. It is the Chennai 
chapter of the Indian Linux Users Group. India is a country with around 35 
major languages and hundreds of minor languages. And, except for a few 
fanatics in a few cities, a country which enjoys this linguistic diversity and 
is very tolerant of other languages. Tamilnadu in general and Chennai is 
particular has always been known for this tolerance. I am unable to recall a 
single instance or language riots and agitations (apart from the anti-hindi 
agitation, which was not targetted against hindi speaking people, but against 
certain policies of the central government.

People adopt to a different strategy to teach swimming  to their kids,
somebody would push their child  into the water, and  they stay back & watch
the kids to start swim in order order to come of the water (a shock
treatment). Why cant you take it in such a way. If the parent through their
child  in the water it mean they are trying  kill them.

It's all about our own perception. Similar to that  practising WindXXXX/
non-FOSS in a fossconf is prohibited. They did the same. so that it could be
a lesson for somebody in mere future.

Why cant you unintall/remove the existing firefox from you system and go for
recent one form firefox website. So that it would be the latest and  more

Restricting to software alone? Geekness is more generic to at least science
/ technology i guess.

??????? is right.

Geek is not about cleverness if am right. I thought it was about excessive
obsession towards science / technology in general.

I have read in most forums about this problem and tried every possible
solution and the changes i see is various types of error messages but cant
find a solution to boot windows.

I know that this is a community for Open Source so i apologise but as i am a
newbie to FOSS and also a student so i am little dependent on Windows.


So please Luggies help me to sort this problem as if i had to reinstall OS
then first i need to remove fedora and then reinstall windows and again had
to install fedora which takes much longer time.


Thanks in advance.

   Let the moderator/ ILUG  Coordinator make this statement.  Humble request
to people to please not bring any language/regional/religion/ caste into
this mailing list
 They can better join some regional political party.

 Have a separate Tamil LUG because its Indian Linux User Group  and India is
not part of TamilNadu and we must understand that its other way round. So
please grow up and think at national level than regional level.  You can
separately have a  TLUG .

IMO, 'komban' sounds good and pretty apt too. The colloquial
connotation is not rude... rather sarcastic or 'in-your-face' -
hubris, as Larry Wall would call it?

As for the use of Tamil, this list is to convey ideas regarding
technology and linux and open source. If you try to inject your
bigoted opinions into this then you are actually hijacking the very
purpose of this thread. I feel the very idea that this is a 'Tamil
Nadu' based list is retrograde. This is the web... _THE WEB_   meaning
no boundaries. So, if you want to erect artificial boundaries.... you
are free to do it... but more liberal minded among us will see to that
this parochialism does not succeed.

We only ask you to prefix the subject with the word 'TAMIL' so that
non tamil users can easliy filter it. But your stubborn refusal to do
that only means your agenda is at cross purposes with this lists'. But
then... we can only request you to follow the policies. Being a jerk
is not against the law!

People adopt to a different strategy to teach swimming  to their kids,
somebody would push their child  into the water, and  they stay back & watch
the kids to start swim in order order to come of the water (a shock
treatment). Why cant you take it in such a way. If the parent through their
child  in the water it mean they are trying  kill them.

Can you please provide more about the apology for what, to whom,.etc?:
* .ppt used by nrcfoss employee?.
* Allowed by fossconf organizer?
* Irritate NRCFOSS members by ILUGC people?
* ILUGC always talking about the TAX payers and about NRCFOSS activities?
* Inability to find the time for file d RTI or/and face-to-face discussion?
* For the past 2 days, we discussed a lot and invested our valuable time for
this topic here. This community only talking about more and finally come-up
with nothing?.
* and many....

The .ppt issue is nothing. Every one knows here. No idea about you. The
actual problem is different. It has been started few years back. My personal
opinion is, Please end-up with a +ve conclusion for both. Otherwise it wont
stop and we cant expect any good relations between ILUC & NRCFOSS in future.
I dont like to stop this thread just like that. Upto my knowledge, there is
a person can possibly stop this thread with +ve conclusion here -

+1. Not because I care whether this list will be full of Tamil or 
because I won't be able to read it (the pragmatic people will just move 
to other lists), but just for the reason that I distrust fanatics of all 
persuasions and my automatic reaction to such regionalism and similar 
divisive, exclusionary attitudes is to throw up my middle finger. So, 
sue me.

Looks like you have installed WinXP on a logical partition.  IIRC, all 
MS OSs likes to install on the first partition of the first disk and 
that partition has to be a primary partition.   I think this has to do 
with the way DOS used to assign partition labels C: D: etc ...

You can try hiding the other partitions and see if it helps.

For what purpose you need firewall?


> Here using workgroup not for Domain

Firewall does not worry about your windows domain or workgroup.

See this link for setting up Firewall using iptables.

I have a NSLU-2 based music system that forms an interesting demo.

Unfortunately, I have a visitor here at IMSc that week so I will not
be able to go. If someone from ILUG-C wants to borrow the system and
play with it *and* demo it at the booth then they can do so.

Note that the playing is conditional on the demo-ing!

Kapil.

Very safe volunteer :) We need people on 12th & 13th on half a day

Way back in time, there was a general agreement that "TAMIL" or "TAMIZ" 
(excuse me if I got it wrong) would be *prefixed* in the subject line, 
for discussions that were to be in Tamil.  For a while it worked.  
Ironically, it is less than a handful of members who are not following 
it.  

The worst scenario is hijacking a thread started in English - IMO no 
excuses for that.  

I am also on the mailing list of other regional ILUGs and have not come 
across this kind of attitude.

Since you are using "workgroup" you must have installed the samba 
package(s).  You need to setup samba as a domain controller.  There are 
many fine docs on how to do this, you can start with Docs and FAQs @ 
www.samba.org.

Go to the network settings panel and look around for firewall settings.

People in ILUGC who are also  member of  Mumbai, Delhi, other metro and
major cities' linux user groups kindly shed light on this. We can get to
know whether people  are allowed to post in their state language or English
or their own mother tongue(those which are spoken by minimum people and the
state language is different). And how they handle such threads.

Yes all indians respect each others' language.

Here I am +1


so non Tamil people are not supposed to post in Tamil???



If they have such an interest towards the language tamil which has the
second oldest grammar in Indian languages(Ofcouse tholkappiam's date may be
even older) let them convert from beschi to
veeramamunivar<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constanzo_Beschi>.
We aren't forcing anyone.

If there is any suggested way to post in Tamil or English let everyone
follow it.

To my knowledge there are people who are not able to post properly in
english get some sarcastic comments here. We can allow them to ask their
questions in the state language(here tamil).

*Solution for this issue : *
*Thread specific:*
*Thread strarting : *Let the thread starter post in the language he knows
more - tamil or english. If he knows both lang(eng & tam) let him add the
translation or else some one who is proficient in both languages post
translation.
*Thread replies :* Replies can be both in English and tamil. If the
translation from tamil to english or english to tamil is needed, whoever has
free time can post replies in the thread with translations(I dont know
whether this will be feasible).

*Achievements:* Everyone gets answer/suggestion here. Even in archives there
is answer for all questions. We can avoid this thread which gets started
every 3 months...
*Disadvantage:  *Threads become big in size(twice or more. I know list admin
wont allow this method). Some confusions may arise.

Adding Thamizh or Tamil or Tamiz in the subject is needed when someone types
tamil words with english alphabets. If the subject is in  thamizh alphabets
why ask some one to add Thamizh or Tamil or Tamiz in the subject.

If so there will be a need for subject additions(If we all respect each
other):
Kannadam
Malayalam
Urudu
Telugu
....etc., in all linux user groups.

I posted the above to come to a conclusion let us not start a war from here.

While installing Centos it should have asked options for both SELinux
and Firewall.

Else you can, enable/ disable

 System --> Administration --> Security Level and Firewall

Please realize the people who object to your actions are not doing so
because they have no other option. They can just filter _ALL_ posts
from you. They are protesting because they still want to hear what you
have to say - as long as you say it in a language they understand.

If you dont want them to hear you out... which ever language.... you
are the loser.  I think you are doing a lot of work in Tamil
computing. Highly commendable. But unfortunately, your intransigence
is only making you lose an audience who might appreciate it and even
contribute to it.

> Excuse me on that!

I dont have to! I can only feel sorry for you.

Yes, it is almost true, many ilugc members who can speak/write in tamil well, are not able to post properly in english
fearing of comments and never post their questions/problems at all.  So, they should
be allowed to ask their questions in the state language (as said tamil here).

Really an excellent idea and this would allow so many newbies to think
about posting their problems/doubts of any kind without worrying about language problem.

Initially people should help in translating the thread to english.

Filtering to trash is what I do, so it is quite annoying when, 1.  the
OP changed his email address, and 2. everyone rehashes a discussion
which has already taken place, and it was decided on to allow mails in
Tamil.

PS:  Ramadas, nothing against you, but I can't read Tamil, so it's
just a matter of convenience for me to filter you and a few others on
the list.  Please do continue though, I'm sure your posts are
meaningful to those who can read Tamil.

Being a senior person I think that such rash comments should be avoided.
Amachu is not a fanatic. He just loves to communicate in his mother tongue
more than others. Linguistic fanatics are people who promote language for
the sake of language and without any scientific understanding of the
historical perspective of language.
The mother tongue is the first language that one comes in contact the day
one is born and scientists have also shown that one learns best in the mother
tongue and not in an alien language, example English.
It is ideal to ensure that all knowledge is available in ones mother tongue to
ensure that strong local economies are built. This also ensures that
monopolies are not possible which is very important for healthy competition.
If people are comfortable posting in the mother tongue then let them.
If one want to mark such mail as spam then go ahead. That is a freedom that
one has.

What you are writing is "panni" tamil.


People substitute english words for most significant concepts in a sentence
(nouns and verbs) and the only Tamil words left are pronouns and the word
"pannu" or "panni" or some simple Tamila action verbs such as vaa and po.
* Examples of panni Tamil: *
Naan Madras-kku travel panninen neththu.
Indha book-ai-p borrow panninadhu yaru?
Indha document-ai-k correct pannik kudunaga.
Thanks sollu.
Indha movie paththiya?

Personal attacks are no less despicable than fanaticism. And I think
this is not the first time you are indulging in it! You have the same

        Do we have a moderation policy in ilug-c ? For sometime now,
there has been too much of personal attacks.

Hi !

Yes. In very bad taste too.

Sadly ,somewhere down the road ,professionalism , tolerance , magnanimity
and respect for others were all lost !

Instead of adding another dose of noise, I take this opportunity to 
request the admins to wake up. Time to tighten up the noose as things 
are getting out of our hands. 3 threads of nothing but personal attacks 
and meaningless debates, going on and on. I haven't been getting 
anything else for the past few days. I feel it's better to have some 
moderation policy when things get out of hands and people start 
attacking each other personally, as well as value less trolls. I would 
like them to be kicked out of the list.

Secondly, the mailman listinfo states that the language of message to be 
displayed is English and I would like that to be declared primary 
language of communication in this list. This will avoid unnecessary 
noise in the list regarding language to be used in the list. Only 
exception can be that the OP is not able to express his question clearly 
in English and chooses to do the same in Tamil, in which case a member 
in the list can volunteer to translate if in English for other members 
to reply to the query and if required back to Tamil so the OP can 
understand. We expect such occasions to be very rare and hence permissible.

Aren't we flaming over a trivial issue which primarily boils down to one
person's ego? Requesting moderator(s) to step up and put this nonsense to an
end.

I am not sure if moderators have sufficient bandwidth in their hands to
moderate this group.  If yes, then here is my suggestion : Setup a group of
moderators, decided based on the vote by ILUGC members. Revise(read tighten)
rules (again voted to approve) and ruthlessly follow them so we have a good
sane discussion going on.

For the person to nominate as moderator, he/she should have good knowledge
of Open Source Software and it's philosophy. The moderator team could be a
mix - some have good knowledge on BSD, Linux, yada yada... Atleast this
would bring some diversity in the group.

Moderators can swap, say in every six months, or to any exigency(any
pressing issues in their work/home). Rules can be changed every three/six
months or so.

Any takers?

Dear List,

I attempted to translate parts of the mail, for others' benefit.
However, my lack of working knowledge of Tamil (it is my mother
tongue, but I did not grow up in Tamil Nadu and thus, have not studied
it formally), it is a very crude translation and requires much effort
on my part, and I still end up with several question marks. If others
help out, then maybe we can decipher the mails.

I got the pictures from the "Theniyaar" (people from Theni?). You can
also share your thoughts on the programme via e-mail in Tamil!

> ??????? ??? ?????? ?????????????????? ?????????????. ??????? ???????

Since I was weary due to travel, I rested for two days, and this was
why I could not share my experiences with you earlier.

> ????????? ?????? 11 ??????? ??????????????. ?????????? ???? ?????
> ??????? ??????????? ????? ??????.

The programme began at 11 AM. Some people found it difficult to find
the location within the campus/complex.

The "Aandavar" (Principal?) of Pachayappa's College had brought eight
of his students. I think the names are with Chandra. Chandra came
exactly at 10:59! "Ogai" Natarajan came with him. That apart, Theni
Yuvaraj, Dev also came.

> ????????????? ?????? ???? ?????????????? ????????? ?????????? ????
> ?????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ??????? ?????? ????????????
> ???????? ???????????????? ????????????. ????????????? ???? ?????????
> ???????? ????????.

Amachu had some sudden work, so he went ahead of time and prepared the
laptop/projector and informed me and left. He rejoined the programme a
while later.

> ?????????? ???? ???????? ????????? ?????? ??? ????????? ??????????.
> ??????? ??? ????????. ???? ??????????? ???? ?????? ???.
> ??????? ??? ??????????? ????? ?????? ??????? ????? ???????? ?????????.
> ????????????????? ?????? ?????? (?????? ??????!) ?????? ?????????????.
> ???????? ???????? ?????? ????????? ????? ?????? ???????? ????????
> ????????.

After singing the "Tamil Thaai Vaazhthu", the students introduced
themselves. Then Chandra spoke briefly, and the talk ended with a
discussion on why digitization (I think) was needed. A magic box was
made for this, and shown to all. Everyone tried using the camera and
familiarized themselves with the controls.

> ?????? ???????? ??? ???? ???????? 30 ????????? ?????????????????. ???
> ???? ??? ?????? ???? ???????? ?? ????????? ????????????????.
> ??????? ?????? ?????????????? ?????? ???? ??????? ?????????? ?????
> ??????? ??????? ????? ????? ?????? ?????????????.

30 pages of "Sandhadi Sakku" (correct?) were digitized. Other than
that, several pages of "Hari Vamsam" were also digitized. The pages
were then projected onto the projector and it was shown how clear the
display was visible.

> ?????? 1 ??????? ??????? ??????????? ????????. ?????? ????? ?????????
> ??? ??????? ???????????????. ??????? ?????? ????????, ??????
> ????????????? ?????? ??????? ?????? ???? ?????????????.
> ?????? 1 ??? 30 ????????????? ????????? ???????????.

It was planned that the programme should go on for about an hour. So,
the computer processing involved was not shown in detail. Conversion
to black and white and rotating to make the page straight were shown.
The programme concluded in about 1 1/2 hours.

> ?????????????? ?????????????? ???? ????????? ???? ??????????? ???????
> ?????????, ??? ???? ???? ???????? ???????? ????????. ??????????
> ?????????? ????????? ????? ??????????????? ??????? ????? ?????????.

Just as the participants' thirst for knowledge was quenched, their
hunger could not be satisfied. They had come from places as far as
Ambathur and Mugapair.

> ??????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ? ??????????? ?? ???????
> ?????????? ?????? ??????????? ????????? ??????? ?????? ????????????.

The "Aandavar" (principal?) remarked that in Pachayappa's College,
several books were damaged during shifting them once because due
precautions were not taken.

> ??????? ??????? ?????????? ???? ???????? ?????? ??????? ???? ??????????.
> ???? ??????? ?? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ?????? ????? ???????????.

I think we can carry forward this concept to more colleges, one at a
time. However, I guess it would be difficult to find both a place for
the demonstration as well as sufficiently interested people.

> ???? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ???????????? ?????? ??????
> ???????????! ??????? ????????. ???? ?????? ????? ???????????! :-)

I have been told that the "Theni petti" (?) will be looked after and
improved. The elections are coming up, so I don't know which petti
(box) was being referred to!

Affectionately,
Diva

Hope this helps.

Thamizh words written with English alphabets seem difficult to read and
people who don't know to read thamizh need not think them as English words
and read them.

No need for translating? Well, I still do think there is a need for
this. If you mean as more people start posting translations, that is a
different matter.

I can try translating whenever I have time. But, I'd appreciate it if
you could do it yourself or others help me in the task.

Thanks.

Translation of other members mail can be done when the poster does not
know english. If the poster does know english but still does not post
an english version of his native language posts, then he/she is the
loser..... less audience for his views. Others need not be their
clerical staff.

Attention is a scarce commodity. It has to be sought and nurtured. If
the idea is to antagonize the audience, they would soon not have
anyone even to antagonize.

Mapping will not work since you have only one hard disk.

title Windows XP Professional
rootnoverify (hd0,4)
savedefault
makeactive
chainloader +1

Check out "rootnoverify". This should work.

Amachu says: "Many people call me up and ask me how to get internet
working, how to listen to music and several other questions (in
Tamil). In those situations, it is very clear what the language in
which the explanation is asked for."

"Imposing restrictions like you must frame your mails like this,
subjects like this etc. seem to impose a unneeded challenge on those
who find it difficult to express themselves clearly in English, and it
is hurtful to them. That is what seems strange to me".

"Expect more mails from me, and it is natural that the mails will be in Tamil".

Translation: I apologise, but this is incorrect. Most of the people
who read mails on this forum know English and use it on a daily basis.
Moreover, several people do not know Tamil. To claim that you will
share your mails with them only if they learn Tamil is plain wrong,
and it saddens me that this is your stand.

If, after so much of requesting and explanation, if you are going to
stick to your stand, then I have nothing more to say. I can only
conclude that you are unwilling to share your knowledge with people
who do not know Tamil.

Thank you.

One point, Amachu must understand that, Is it that Q is asked in pure
Tamil?  The true ans is NO. As of now, we are not in position to speak
in pure Tamil. Because of the whole system. For example, I studied in
vernacular (Tamil) medium for nearly 12yrs. Suddenly after that, I was
forced to read, write and talk in English. English is must for a 
'common' Indian techie to survive in the world.

And Writing in Tamil in this list is NOT GOING TO HELP ANYWAY in to 
improve our language.

"If Tamil is forced, then it will die soon" - Rough translation of
MahaKavi Bharathiyar's statement.

I don't have any server where I can setup this gallery because the space in
fossconf.in is very small and cannot accommodate so many pictures. If anyone is
ready to give the space and gallery2 setup I am +1 to push the pics to them so
that they can put it up in their FOSS based server, from where I can link it to
fossconf.in. I personally feel this is not a bad option either.

Thank You.

Looks like fedora packaged a beta version :(
The best thing you can do is to start fresh by  removing .mozilla directory
and installing firefox new
$cd
$rm -rf .mozilla

You will loose all your profile information and plugins :(

Anyways the current stable version is 3.0.7 . You can also try 3.1 beta 2 (
my choice as 3.1 has new features )
They are all available at http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all.html

 Disclaimer : before you guys scold me for giving such a lame advice , guys
IT WORKS !!

I am ready to volunteer my web space. I already have a gallery 2
installation with lot of space.
http://pavithran.org/pics/ is my collection of photos .

I can also install gallery2 on some other place if you want . We can  then
customise the album template to have fossconf logo :) ( pure foss style )
Any other suggestions?

Translation:

Mr. Ramdas,

After much discussion in this list it was agreed that the word 'TAMIL'
would be appended in the subject, if the post was in Tamil. Even if
you do not accept that as the right solution, it is expected that you
will follow it. Thats the democratic way! Your stubborn refusal to do
so cannot be construed as 'natural'. To me it only seems
subversive/defiant.

I was trying to convince you that your views should reach as many
people as possible. But you are of the opinion that those who want to
know your views should learn tamil! In a world where everyone is
eagerly looking for people who will give them their attention, your
attitude is strange. The loss is yours.

That is weird. I can't recall a single instance before in ILUGC where 
people were less courteous or were reluctant to share info just because 
the question was posed in less-than-stellar English. In fact, most 
people are more than willing to assume what the OP might have meant and 
give several solutions that might solve his/her problem.

You are going to have to learn how to communicate in English sooner or 
later. You might as well start in a place where you're almost anonymous, 
and people are eager to help you in spite of your limitations. Honestly, 
I can't think of a better way to improve your technical communication 
skills than try to express your problem in a technical forum. We all had 
to face some embarrassment while learning a new language, right? I try 
to speak in Tamil as much as I can, in spite of knowing that my maid 
starts laughing when I do so. So what's the big deal?

Or you can simply apply all the security updates and get the latest
version without breaking all the other software which depends on gecko.
Fedora 9 and 10 have 3.06 in their updates and will get 3.07 in a few
days.

As of now only 30,000 words are there .I am yet to push the latest code
which contains 4.8 lakh words (whose size is around 20 MB) to launchpad
project repository ,as i am accessing internet using my mobile GPRS .So i
can not upload the latest code and corpus collection.Please wait for a while
to get the latest code.

i had seen most of the fresh men failed to select X while they install Linux
for the very first time, I belive it might be the cause in your case too.

Please get into terminal type 'tasksel' from the popup installer select the
X - window system and enjoy the Happy Linux after  the installation.

Hello,

Would this apply to replies also? I think you have omitted the word TAMIL in your reply. And so have I :), as there isnt a Tamil word in this reply.

I think its a reasonable rule, that can be followed by everyone with no difficulty at all.

That being said, I express my appreciation for those working for regionalization and migration of Linux / FOSS to vernacular languages. I think it is a very important contribution.

Because it says so...
"National Resource Centre for Free/Open Source Software (NRCFOSS) aims
to contribute to the growth of FOSS in India through Research and
Development, Human Resource Development, Networking and
Entrepreneurship Development, as well as serve as the reference point
for all FOSS related activities in the country including the creation

You could have meant
1) The distro(or absence of it) Linux from Scratch which is what Mr Bharathi
pointed
you to.

2) The Linux kernel from scratch: For this, have a look at:
- http://www.makelinux.net/kernel_map to help you learn basic dependencies
- http://kernelnewbies.org/ to be a guide throughout your journey
- http://lxr.linux.no/ Use an offline version of the kernel source from
kernel.org and
ctags or something like it in gvim/emacs. This can however serve as a quick
ref.
- http://darwish-07.blogspot.com/2008/02/howto-lxrng-on-ubuntu-710.html can
help
you set up an offline lxr.
- Misc:
-- I also found linux 0.01 source as a useful starter
http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Dusting_Off_the_0.01_Kernel
-- The xinu kernel is also good to read.
http://www.dmi.unict.it/~pappalar/lab3/xinuhome.html

3) You might have meant using linux/learning the stuff you said you know (
wanted to know?)
C is learnt from real code. You have plenty of it. Learn NCurses
C++ can be learnt from Bruce Eckel. Learn the standard C++ and not <conio.h>
C++ without namespaces. Learn the STL
http://www2.roguewave.com/support/docs/sourcepro/edition9/html/stdlibref/index.html
Try using the boost library too
Shell Scripting: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/
Makefiles http://www.makelinux.net/books/autobook-1.5/autobook.html
Finally learn perl/python/lua/ruby (For scripting ofcourse. But this can
come later)
and a GUI toolkit. gtkmm or wx...

People to approach for help
- This channel
- Your distro channel for Linux e.g. #fedora or #archlinux on
irc.freenode.net
- The C and C++ channels on Freenode ##C++ (Note, do your homework. People
in this channel often give people rtfms)
- Other channels #ruby-lang #python
- People you meet at the lug meets every first saturday of the month

To Mr. Ramadoss,

I am working in a company where people from all corners(read people from
North and West of India, primarily) work. I have seen Hindi-speaking people
getting frustrated all the while since the "native" people start the
conversation in English, but gravitate to Tamil - which is completely alien
to them.  They feel let out, feel "unwanted" in the group - this is the seed
for the growing resentment against us.  I am not going to ponder the reason
why we have this situation - this is not the appropriate group. Long story
short - English remains our(read Tamil Nadu) link language to the rest of
the world.

If you wanna talk in Tamil, please create a group of your own and have your
conversation. But - please do have the courtesy to have the conversation in
English. Is this so difficult?

-- 
Thanks,
Read me back (RMB).

Which distribution and version?

Was OOo2 installed as part of the OS install i.e. native packages 
included in the OS *or* did you install it from the tar balls?

If packages are from the OS then use then see if that version is 
offering upgrades.  Alternately, uninstall OOo2 and install OOo3.

Can't we create some kind of Wiki for the 'newbie" questions - with pointers
to various sites. I am pretty sure some newbie would ask the same question
again( Count me in too since I am new to Open Source) at later point of time
...

Yes I agree with vikram , the free software movement in karnataka was strong
and was one of the major driving force for me to embrace free software .

Hi,

This mail is intended to clear this issue out of our list(may be we can lay
an example for such lists that have language diversity issues - rather than
suppressing one group of people) and not bring in new fights.

One good example is  Linux users groups in France  that are giving more
importance to their native language - French(minimum English and maximum
French)
http://www.linux.org/groups/france.html
We can't apply the same directly to Indian Linux users Groups  as such
because we have more than 20 official languages(think so). But, the official
languages of the region in which the LUG is operating can be allowed to be
used in it.

Is this the scenario where  some one suddenly comes here and asks not to use
English in this list and use Thamizh instead of English.  If someone did say
that then they can be treated differently. But, People are questioned
inappropriately just because their  post  is in Thamizh. In despair they
reciprocate with some content that leads to a 50 post thread.

We(all) can comment each other easily and find/get some short term enjoyment
out of it.  This thread won't stop and if it stops it is a small pause for
another storm of messages in a similar thread where someone write in
Thamizh.

Let us put a final and strong stop for these threads(selection of
communication language) with correct rectifications in mail list rules.
List administrator can decide upon this(He can have a online meeting or
offline meeting with list members) and send a final mail containing list of
change to be made in our list with respect to different languages in posts.

The delay between my last post and this one is due to some digging work done
in earlier threads of same offensive nature.

*We would be able to conclude considering the two factors that caused this
issue :*

   1. A General Classification of people here as members and will be as
members in future(This categorization is not for segregation of any kind it
is just for the sake of grouping people based on the languages they know &
where they reside.)
   2. Ideology of people under each category.


*Let me categorize the people who have posted here or a member of our list(*
* based on member types in ideology perspective**):*

   1. One who knows Thamizh well - ie.,  proficient in reading and writing
(even if his mother tongue may or may not be  Thamizh ; His mother tongue
could be one among the 22 languages or so; He could have been in Chennai/any
Thamizh speaking community in a certain period of time & learnt it with love
towards it) but is not familiar with English( he may or may not have the
willingness to learn and use English) or can't read & write in English as of
now.
   2. One who is proficient in Thamizh and English or at least who knows to
read and write in both languages & able to contribute in the translation
effort here(translation of threads).
   3. One who knows only English( &  ~Thamizh).


*Reasons favoring people in category 1:*

   1. He/She should be given chance here to interact freely in Thamizh.(
This list describes itself as Indian Linux Users Group - Chennai), Chennai
is the capital of Tamilnadu. Most people here would be from tamilnadu(
ofcouse it has global members - but they have their own regional groups -
almost all major cities in India and cities/towns/villages around the
World). People  stated that there can be TLUGC(Tamil Linux Users Group
Chennai) then this list should have been ELUGC(English Linux Users Group
Chennai). I am not mocking anyone nor the list but to bring out that such
things are not actual solutions for this thread(It kindles new arguments).
         1. Many members of ILUGC are here because they were/are residing in
chennai for a period of time(past or present).
         2.  And a considerable amount of  people here are the residents of
Tamil Nadu(a major portion of whom may not know English but can/will turn
out to be great contibutors of Linux/Opensource/Free Softwares not only in
Translation  but programming,testing, designing, concepts, etc.,).
   2. My view is  - He/She  should be allowed to post in the regional
language without separate rules while posting(India's constitution acts
state that each Non-Hindi  state has the right to practise/use its regional
language and English. In non-Hindi states it would be Hindi instead of
English - not another cold war from here  )
   3. Based on the Indian Constitution acts and rights we have this
situation where at least a single person (will be)/(is ) a member of this
list who may not use English in his/her workplace or education system or
home - in such case even if he would have learnt English it would have
diminished in due course of time - Category 2 &3  people need English in
some or one of the three reasons so we are able to keep English in out
mind.   Non-Hindi states - states where Hindi is not a mandatory language
can use/practise their regional language along with English.  Even central
government activities/transaction/business can be carried out with the help
of authentic region language to English translators. So, there are more
chances that there are people who only know Thamizh are here and want to be
part of ILUGC. They would not have been a part of EILUGC or ILUGCE. But they
want to be part of ILUGC.

*Reasons favoring people in category 2:*

   1. These people have the responsibility here(in this list) to bind
category 1 and category 3. They have the whole responsibility.
   2. They have the ultimate responsibility to bring down this issue
         1. selection of communication languages - English & Thamizh.
         2. Effects of choosing two languages simultaneously in a list - we
may be a global example of a list to have two extremely different language
in a single list - and proof for other future or present mailing lists for
language coexistence without fights.
         3. Surely there are problems and overheads - extra threads or at
least posts will circulate than before. We must think to overcome problems
by creating new rules. Change is necessary now. These new rules must get
into our list rules and be added in the monthly reminder.
         4. how to make all threads readable by other 2 categories
         5. Manual translations  or automated translations can be opted. An
automatic tool can find each untranslated Thamizh mail in the list,
translate them to English and then can send it as a single merged post or as
multiple translated posts to the list.
   3. If such an option is available then one who don't know English
translation(or not willing to do) can go ahead by choosing just Thamizh.
Everyone must give credit to the translation effort and time spent by the
individuals or groups of people who do it - A single paragraph with less
than 200 words can be posted with translation by the thread starter
itself(if they are Category 2 people). If the posted content exceeds 1000
words(or if he posts often) it will be really tough for him and in the due
course he may not post fearing the translation  and mainly the sort of
insulation and mocking done by some or many) . Remember people this is a
public list that gets mirrored to known and unknown hosts(may). I have
chosen my words.Kindly choose Your words before posting. i.e.,  anyone can
read our posts  regardless of any time period(mirrored - can be read now and
also in future even generations after).
   4. We - "category 2" people are product of state's decision on regional
language - Thamizh & English. ie., People who know  both of these in
Tamilnadu.

*Reasons favoring people in category 3:*

   1. These people can be Tamilnadu people who settled in various other
states of India or other countries(whose home/workplace/education was/is
independent of Tamil & mostly dependent on English)
   2. People from various other states of India who had no chance/no need
to learn Tamil.
   3. Others are the global members - members who are aliens(who are English
speaking non-citizen of India)
   4. We can't loose category 3 people But, Kindly remember that people who
belong to category 1 have only this place where they can get clarification,
do their service, participate in events,etc.,   I value this list to be the
most active and informative one that I am member of .Can we deny knowledge
to   people in their own state for not knowing a language - aren't
we(Linux,FSF,OSS,GNU enthusiasits) beyond linguistic barriers. ILUGC has the
need to address this issue. And ILUGC's main events are in Chennai(may have
global events) but, It is here to serve the Chennai people(who resided/are
residing in Chennai  or at least the region around it).


So, We need some sort of pleasing end for this language issue. We can be in
any one of these categories but we must try to understand the problems faced
by people in other categories.
*
My Suggestions:*

   1. First and foremost the "TAMIL" word in Subject line need not be
mandatory(can be a suggestion) - It may be left over accidentally which may
lead to a big word war.
   2. Let each language be denoted in its own script(with its own
representation - letters,numerals,punctuations,etc.,). Let us standardize
Thamizh topics & conversations to be in UTF-8. So that people will be able
to understand whether it is English or Thamizh. ie., don't represent English
words with Thamizh letters and Thamizh words with English letters(This is
the major cause of confusion & it affects the readability of the message -
and it was the source for the storm of messages in an earlier case some
months back). At least we know this feasible because both language belong to
different scripting(can be easily differentiate).
   3. A separate translation thread with prefix -[TRANSLATED TAM - ENG]  by
the the thread starter or category 2  people with willingness  will be
available. Immediate/late availability of such  separate threads depends  on
whether it will be of use to others(a new concept, technical study,technical
solution - now or in future) will be started immediately alongside with the
first original posting. If not a translated thread will be posted  after the
original thread gets solved. It will be available with subject line prefixed
with [RESOLVED : TRANSLATED TAM - ENG] . If manual translation doesn't make
sense We can opt automated translation . A new project from scratch (may be
incorporating existing modules from other like minded open source projects)
can be started.
   4. If You are going to neglect a post don't say here that you move it to
Trash/Recycle bin/Spam folder/Scam folder/anything of that sort. Do it -
don't say that here. It hurts others who contribute here.
   5. I respect those who are reading ,posting in this thread and feel the
responsibility to solve this problem. Let us put a full stop for this issue
once for all.
   6. The above holds good for threads which are started in English and
contain some posts in Thamizh(A manual or automatic translation would
certainly help).


In other words We(the one who were and are translating - because I have
joined them) will do it forever.


To my knowledge We must allow both English and Thamizh to coexist here  in
ILUGC. Its up to the great people who frame additional rules here other than
the ones specified in RFCs and moderators of this community to take action.


We(ILUGC) need all people with willingness to contribute to FOSS and at the
same time language contribution to FOSS comes from the regional people(Most
of the time)

I had that on an old subdomain at hostrator. Their subdomains
started to really suck. However links on shakti's site
http://www.shakthimaan.com/
and on http://www.makelinux.net/resources are some of the links
I am frequenting of late.

Use the SIGs.

Most common apps can be found on the official Fedora repos. rpmfusion
can be used for non-free and at times, rarely used rpms...
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs is used for special needs

Hello,

Part of doing FOSS is to learn to *communicate* --- as a writer *and*
as a reader.

While writing, one should make one's best attempt to say things as
clearly, logically and briefly as possible. Punctuation and formatting
are important as well. The writer should be trying to reach the
reader.

As readers, we should make an effort to try and understand what is
being said. In particular, this means that we should forgive all
errors of the above type---if we can get the meaning. The reader
should be trying to read the mind of the writer.

In both cases, we need to spend more *time* to read and to write. The
writer should use the "save as draft" key until you have time to put
in the effort. The reader should use the "next" key until you have the
time to read carefully.

In brief, if you don't have anything to say, don't say it, if you
don't like what is written just ignore/delete it.

Instead of spending so much energy on deciding which *language* we
can communicate in, we should spend some time on communicating!

Regards,

Kapil.

People who really care do. If you don't read it, you don't have to say it out

Well I just now realized i missed a +1 before my statement. What i meant 
was the 1945 words that Roshan took pains counting and letting us know

It is to be noted that the candidate will not be tested in programming 
skills per se, but only in his/her capability of deploying a FOSS web 
application in production.
</quote>

IMO, it boils down to admin activity and thus I do not see much 
difference between this certification other certifications for example 
LPI or RHCE.

Also, the rest of the material is too high level, please put in 
specifics so that interested candidates know what they are getting 
into; ditto for employers when they interview candidates with this 
cert.

Generally, mixing repositories would lead to conflicts. Other than livna 
  + rpmfusion - free/non-free repositories, many of them are not 
compatible with Fedora completely or replace packages leading to many

Is the upgrade is essential?
Why not a fresh install of new version?

Fedora 2 is very old to use.

If there is no important data, or very little data, back up them.

Do a fresh install of Fedora 9.

This will make your life easier.

Fedora 10 already come.

Go for a latest one always.

actually it is always advisable to go for the second latest - not only in 
software, but for everything you acquire.

Not always, think about hardware specs and then upgrade.

Newer versions generally assume more ram and cpu power.

I second it, atleast for fedora.
In the desire for cutting edge, some crucial subSytems could come out  with bugs unsurmountable at the start.
But also, fedora releases get obsoleted qucik too. Give a good read of fc10 known issues before taking a call!

my question to prasath is, why Fedora not Debian? since you used Fedora for
long run it time to taste something different. Try  Debian Etch/Lenny.

Not necessarily. with Eric S Raymonds explanation of Zen enlightenment

a simple  " wc -w foo.txt" is enough :).

When someone shows interest to count the number of words (whatever the
method), he _can_ read it and he _should_ read it before making
comments. :-). That post was kind of suggesting people not to read it
because it was so much words long and was trying to dilute the issue
being mentioned. :-).

P.S. These are only my personal opinions and not intended to offend anyone. :-)

Use programs which use more than 640MB of memory. Idle swap is good 
since it means you have enough memory for your workloads.

Don't think that is possible under X Window System.

Swap memory is your virtual memory. When your linux box run out of primary
memory (RAM) then it started using swap partition (area ).

If you system is not using the swap area, it really good, since it show you
have enough RAM on board.

Utilizing the swap partition for your graphics memory is not an ideal
option. Swap partition grows on your secondary memory (HDD), is
comparatively very very slow to the RAM.

Its no way possible to used swap as per you mentioned in post.

Swap space is just space on your hard-drive set up to compensate for
when you run out of RAM. Accessing that is as slow as accessing your
hard drive, so less swap used is better.

I do not think any graphics card currently available can use hard-drive
space to augment VRAM, and besides that isn't a very good idea at all.
On the Intel 845 board, you should be able to increase the amount of
main RAM that is allocated to your on-board graphics in the BIOS.

Out of curiosity more than anything please quote that Bharathi's line

Just wanna know, where and when he uttered those words? Being his

If this is the phrase, then read it completely and understand what

Hi all,

I need to recover data from a SCO Open Server 5.0 harddisk which uses EAFS/HTFS (not NTFS) filesystem.  I didn't find any linux distro which supports this kind of filesystem to mount from linux. 

Any pointers would be helpful.

Using Debian lenny on the Acer Aspire One
I just tested:

 # get module assistant to get, build and install the alsa modules
 m-a a-i alsa
 # unload the older alsa modules from kernel
 rmmod $(lsmod | grep snd | cut -f1 -d' ')
 # load the newly built modules --- note model=acer!
 modprobe snd-hda-intel model=acer
 # record 10 seconds of CD quality audio
 arecord -f cd -v -d 10 > /tmp/test.wav
 # play it
 aplay /tmp/test.wav

And it worked! So perhaps some recent changes to the alsa-source
package in lenny made it work or my tests earlier were buggy!

Kapil.

If you plug-in headphones or a mic do they work as expected?

On WinXP atleast, whenever I plug in headphones, I need to ensure
the acer audio mixer app is running for the sound to be routed to the
headphones.  Not running this app causes the sound to be played
back through the built-in speakers even though I have the headphones
plugged in.


I have one more issue -- at the lowest screen brightness, the screen
flickers every time the HDD reads/writes data.  This happens all the
time, even when the laptop is on AC or battery power.  I'm not sure
if this is a hardware of software glitch, do you notice the same problem
using X.org servers?


Thanks for all your inputs!

Yes. There is a mixer setting which toggles between internal mic and

I haven't noticed anything specific like this. I have not tried to
do anything disk intensive while having a video or GL graphic
running, so that needs to be tried.

Message-ID: <dcfc32ef0903072143j355b1c30r528e6646556e0303@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have an Internet Leased Line Connecvitity at my work spot.

My router has a public IP from which I have connected to a machine which is
acting as a firewall (Microsoft ISA). The Server has two Interfaces (One
configured to connect and configured with Public IP - for Internet
Connectivity and the other Interface to share the Internet bandwidth to my
LAN).

I have few more public IPs and I have configured one of them on a Linux
Machine acting as a VOIP server.

I have installed and configured the same Linux machine with MRTG and I am
able to successfully get the MRTG graph for the Public IP. The cfgmaker on
my machine is as follows:

cfgmaker --output /home/mrtg/cfg/mrtg.cfg --ifdesc=ip --ifref=descr --global
"WorkDir: /home/httpd/mrtg" --global "Options[_]: bits,growright"
public@vector-voip

I am trying to execute the cfgmaker for my router which gets the actual
bandwidth.

Request to suggest the process to see MRTG for my router.

Thanks in advance.

You need to enable SNMP on your router, and ask MRTG to
poll the necessary interface.

A Google search for "snmp mrtg" provides plenty of useful
documentation on the first page itself.  I suggest you try
it out and get back if you hit any specific issues.


If you find manual SNMP/MRTG configuration difficult, I
suggest you try Cacti (cactiusers.org).  It's a point and
click way to add and monitor devices in your network.

Hi,

I'm building a small collection of old hardware.
If someone has old, pre-Pentium era machines like 286, 386 or 486 for sale
or as free give-aways
please let me know/contact me off list. I will be very grateful(will
remember you in my prayers) and
will also take care of the oldies well.

I'm kind of convinced no one sells pre-Pentium hardware anymore (it was
common 8-10 years ago),
but if someone knows anyone who does, please let me know.

Thanks in advance.

they are also keen to have students / staff to attend the sessions. some of
you might have registered and got passes on individual basis.

however, you could come as  a group -- ask your staff member to send a mail
to the organizer with the list of student names (and possibly the sessions /
time you would like to attend). When you reach the venue, the group will be
given the necessary passes so that they could attend the sessions. They
feel, the sessions on FOSS for everyone should be of interest -- not just
CSE/IT, but stduents from all branches of engg., science, etc.

Subject: [Ilugc] Recover file with filename from ext2/ext3 filesystems.
Message-ID: <gp7sq5$tjp$1@ger.gmane.org>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all,

One of my friend in IIT somehow deleted his old thesis directory
contains important files.

He maintained a tab seperated .txt files as plot inputs. He mapped those
.txt files with his Tex/LateX or some other tool to draw graph. The
filenames are used to indicate what type of plot to draw with the
contents as inputs.

He is using openSuSE with 95GB ext3 partition. Using 'photorec' I
recovered files with .txt, .odt, .sxw, .pdf and lot of extensions. But
the problem is, I recovered the plot input .txt files with filenames
like 'f1102345642.txt'. Original filename was lost.

Google points me to photorec, ext3undel, foremost. But they are all
recovering the contents of the file, but not the filenames. Is there any
way to recover files including filenames?

Thanks,
Mohan.

You need to search for inodes that contain directory information. I
recall that "debugfs" allows you to recover directory inodes as
files. Running "strings" on this data will get you the file names ---
but it will not tell you which file is which. For that you will need
to read the directory data structure and I do not know any tool which
does that.

Perhaps you should be looking for an out-of-band solution like
generating plots from the data without worrying about matching the
files. By comparing the plots with earlier printed copies you should
be able to identify which plot is associated with which data set.

All the best,

Kapil.

Message-ID: <b89799040903111818i35f84748q53b9b5022eb3f511@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a file with 2 columns. First lists the space of the folder and the
second the folder name. Sample below:

2.1M    test1
220K    test2
2.2G    test3
2.2M    test4
22M     test5
22M     test6
2.2M    test7
230M    test8
232K    test9
I want to sort the file based on the space usage. Currently it is just
sorting based on the number. Is there a way to sort it the other way round.
Like making a stream editor first read each line upto a point it reaches a
non-numeric character then if the following character is K then divide by
1024, if it is G multiply by 1024 and so on and then sort the file. Is this
possible. I do not know to work well with stream editors and regexs'. Please
advise.

Ashish

Well, you should! Or you should learn perl which can be used to
combine everything.

Here is a solution using sed and cut. Let list be the file
that contains the data.

cat list | \
 sed -e's/^/0 \1/' \
     -e's/^0 \([0-9\.]*G\)/3 \1/' \
     -e's/^0 \([0-9\.]*M\)/2 \1/' \
     -e's/^0 \([0-9\.]*K\)/1 \1/' | \
 sort -n | cut -f2- -d' '

The sed expression adds a "rank" at the top of each the line depending
on whether it is nothing or "G", "M" or "K" that is attached to the
number. The ordinary "sort -n" then works. At the end "cut" is used to
cut out the extra junk.

Regards,

Kapil.

Friends.

We wish to buy HP Compaq dx2480 Microtower PC.

We need to know that whether Debian 64 bit is supported for this PC.

If you are getting the PC with a Core 2 Duo or Quad it supports 64 bit OS.
For Pentium Dual Core or Celeron you will need to check Intel's website.
As for other hardware in the system I have no idea about their Linux
compatibility.

Debian's AMD 64 version would be appropriate.

Hi !

I dont know if you are serious ... but

....Called "the world's greatest tech humour site" by The Register, BBspot
creates entertainment for the geekier side of the world. BBspot produces a
variety of features like fake news stories satirizing the tech and political
worlds, the BBspot Mailbag which pokes fun at the Believers (people who
believe our fake news) and much more.
:-)) did you fall for it ?

Cheers

Hi,
I run Arch and Ubuntu parallely.
Both have GNOME as the DE.
I have a fedora 10-x86-kde live cd.
I want to install kde on arch. kdemod and dependencies weigh in at an
excess of 575 MB which makes the process time consuming. I just wanted
to know if there is any way to install just KDE 4.1 from fedora onto
my arch system. If there is no way, I'll download it any way.
Thanks.

The RPMs can be extracted, but I doubt it would work without a lot
of mucking around. And even if it does work, your upgrade path is
screwed. I would suggest to just use kdemod.

Hi Ilugc,

I set up a Facebook profile where I can post my pictures, videos and events and I want to add you as a friend so you can see it. First, you need to join Facebook! Once you join, you can also create your own profile.

Thanks,

Bhargav,
rpmunpack does exist as a package in AUR. That extracts rpms. But I would
advise
you not do do it.

Subject: [Ilugc] [commercial?] NRC-FOSS needs engineers
Message-ID: <200903130851.25147.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

for it's second phase commencing in April NRC-FOSS is looking to recruit 
bright young engineers. Please note that NRC-FOSS is a project with a lifetime 
of 3 years, so it is not a career option. Pay will be in the 15-20K a month 
range. We are looking for people who would like to spend a couple of years 
doing what they love - FOSS. Also the parent organisation AU-KBC centre also 
offers MS by research and encourages NRC-FOSS employees to enroll for this. 
Even otherwise all employees are encouraged to work in any FOSS area of 
interest to them. Interested people may contact me offlist.. And even though the 
financial rewards are not all that great, a couple of years at NRC-FOSS at AU-
KBC looks very good on a resume.

Note: 'young' refers to outlook and not to age in years.

The "gobby" program allows users of different systems to chat and
edit a file at the same time. It is available for all platforms.

If you want a solution which is based on an external server, then
look at the various user agents for IRC or IM like irssi or pidgin.

Message-ID: <44b246280903130655w3f55a29eu31b857f71657fe84@mail.gmail.com>

Hello there!
I'm a 12th standard CS student of Vidya Mandir (Mylapore), a bit of a crack,
CEGLUG member and ArchLinux user.
I read of OSI Tech Days in the Hindu yesterday (because my internet
connection has been cut). I visited the website (www.osidays.com) from my
uncle's house and found that the 500 member limit for the Silver passes has
already been reached. However, I and a couple of friends are very eager to
visit this event.

Would anyone know anything about this?
Will I be disallowed without a pass?
What do I do?

Regards,
Rishabh

How is your DNS server response?
How much cache space did you assign?
how is your Disk IO/CPU stat?
R u hitting any max open files limits? if on a home PC, i would doubt this.

you might have to dig in a bit more to find out the cause for slow response.

Dear Friends,

Iam new to the area of virtualization of OS. I have fedora 8 installed with Xen kernel. The ultimate aim is to show students live migration. I have some problems with it.

1. Could not install any OS in DomU (Tried CentOS and others through internet) but in vain. 

2. How can we do it using DVD? 

3. Can we run two virtual machines in Xen-qemu at the same time?

I have been able to install openSuse and BOSS in two virtual machines in Xen-qemu(Fedora 8) but still Iam not able to run both at same time. Thats why I have posed you all the 3rd question.

Benedict

What does yum repolist tell you? Check whether you have the updates repo
enabled in /etc/yum.repos.d

I suppose you already had the following line also:
 deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian etch main contrib

Looks like this library which is part of opsview-perl package is
compiled for a different base system than what you have.

You must install a domU as a virtual machine in a host running as
dom0. The dom0 system must be booted with the Xen hypervisor (this
needs grub to load the hypervisor instead of loading the kernel
directly).

> 2. How can we do it using DVD? 

You can give the domU access to the DVD drive or if you have an image
of the DVD then you can give the domU access to that image.

> 3. Can we run two virtual machines in Xen-qemu at the same time?

Certainly. You must make sure that there is enough memory to allocate
to the virtual machine and you must allocate distinct write-able
block devices to each virtual machine.

By the way, Xen and qemu are distinct approaches so I am bit confused
that you are calling it Xen-qemu.

Hi,

http://news.rediff.com/report/2009/mar/14/loksabhapoll-bjp-to-promote-free-open-software.htm

While i do not want to bring politics here, i would like to highlight the
amount of awareness that the above news could bring in.  If other political
parties follow the same announcement, then open source will get a boost.

Already some of the political leaders are using open source to great
extent.  For example, in www.lkadvani.in joomla and  wordpress is used.  And
they are using phplist for the mailing list too.

Do any one have info on how other political leaders are using open source?

Friends.

I attended the last two days of OSI Days.

The events were fine and found many college students.

ChennaiLUG stall got so many queries and many people wondered
about our activities.

Today we had a talk on collaborative learning by Baskar, Distro War by
LUG members,
Activities of ChennaiLUG by bharathi, KDE by akash and a panel
discussion on Career Trends.

Ashok Krish explained the FOSS usage at TCS.

Redhuan Daniel Oon, Malaysia, explained on his Open Source ERP  "ADempiere".
He requested India to provide contribution.

Here are some snaps.

What did you do with CentOS? I run Windows XP (Licensed) and Ubuntu on
top of it?

Hi !

Here is another hiccup when trying to user Open source for business.

Has anyone successfully  implemented dual screen in Ubuntu ?
I am trying to bring up a teleconferencing solution .A laptop running Ubuntu
connected to 60" TV through s-video.
Xp with ATi drivers has no problem though.
I see lot of postings in Ubuntu forums . But not able to succeed mainly
because of my incapacity.
 But would like to know about some first hand experience here.

Hi !

I dont get it ?

What is the problem in running windows XP inside ANY  Linux distro using
ANY  virtualisation package like vmware , virtual box , win4lin ?

So long as XP is a legal , licensed copy ? We have been selling
virtualisation software since 2003 !

You could use the yum package manager to install new packages and fedora 10
KDE has got kpackagekit which automatically gets updates for existing
packages installed. For more information on yum and packagekit you could
read through the yum and packagekit manuals.

If there was any then companies with Virtualization products would be 
taken to courts.  You can run any guest OS supported by the 
Virtualization product.

Well, this one isn't even released yet. They only come out end-March or
early-April. Interestingly, it seems that it's much better to buy them
in pairs because that cuts shipping costs by some 40% ($28 for one, $35
for two, to India at least). Is anyone here planning on getting one? It
sounds pretty neat.

With any release-oriented distro(Fedora/Ubuntu/(Debian?)...), there is
feature freeze.
AFAIK, 2.6.25 might be the final kernel release for Fedora 9. You cannot
install any
newer version unless you build the kernel yourself. Similarly 2.6.27 is the
latest for
F10. 2.6.28/29 may find its way into F11.
The reason for the feature freeze is to start focussing more on bug fixes.

There must be some location where they keep their distro specific kernels.

I recommend you read the entire thread before replying. He wants to use the
rpms
on Archlinux. Archlinux uses a home-bred package manager called pacman which
works on tar.gz style archives..

@Bhargav:
I seriously recommend you stay awake one night and use your night time to
download
kdemod on Archlinux. It is widely acknowledged to be the best package for
kde. It is both
highly modular and also optimized to a great extent.

better
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/updates/9/x86_64.newkey/

It seems to have kernel 2.6.27

Yep.

The mirror thats best reachable at the time of query is chosen
automatically, unless one overides them by physically editing the
appropriate files.

Base URLs being:

http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/releases/
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/updates/

Whats the entry in /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-updates.repo?

The article makes no mention of Exchange.  It only mentions that
Outlook Express was used as the MUA.


All the FUD spun by Microsoft is sufficient.  No need to add to it.

I do not currently have access to the file. However it is the default file
that came with fedora. I have not made any changes to it.

Now I intend on getting the entire 9 directory on the site mentioned by
Ashok and maitain a local repo.

Some machines inside Redhat were compromised around September last year.
Because of thet Redhat and Fedora had to re-sign all the rpms using a new
signing key. They also changed the update urls to reflect that. So the
default yum config from the DVD is out of date. That is why you have the
i386.newkey and x86_64.newkey repositories.

It took them 3 months to even realise that they had a problem.

Thinking is obviously not so easy for them.

Squirrelmail is a web based email client (MUA).

Hi !

I see that there is a lot of confusion here. Terminology is being used very
loosely.

1) Squirrelmail is an application wriiten in php. So it needs a web server
with PHP 4 installed.
2) You need a  IMAP4  server (e.g. uw-imap, courier-imap, cyrus-imap,
[hMailServer] <http://www.hmailserver.com/>, Binc IMAP,
CommuniGate<http://www.squirrelmail.org/wiki/CommuniGate>,
MS Exchange Server <http://www.debianhelp.co.uk/webmail.htm#>,
MercuryMail<http://www.squirrelmail.org/wiki/MercuryMail>32,
[Dovecot] <http://www.dovecot.org/>) for it to work.
3)  You need a web browser and when you point to the web server it renders
your web mail and has all the functionality you would want from an email
client, including strong MIME support, address books, and folder
manipulation.

So functionally it is a mail client but it is a php application sitting on a
web server and gets mail from IMAP mail servers !

refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquirrelMail

It actually makes sense to use something like Squirrel Mail instead of a
desktop app like Thunderbird. All the emails will remain on the server and
this will help from the perspective of keeping backups, ensuring that the
emails don't land up in the wrong hands if the laptops are lost etc.

I would have suggested something like Zimbra though - it will be easier to
use than Squirrelmail and have better support for collaboration.

Thanks,

Even with thunderbird (or any other IMAP client), the mail can be
kept on the server by (simple) configuration choices.

This is much more serious. However, considering that they used Windows
in a way which allowed the computers to acquire viruses, I would say
that it requires educating the users some more as well!  

For example, configuring the browser to clear cookie cache and form
data; to keep all passwords locked with a master password or in a
password safe; to logout or lock screen while suspending the machine
etc.

Being in charge of security for big-wigs nowadays is no picnic. The
natural responses of most senior people belong to a time when the
world was a safer place. Are they willing (esp. in India) to follow
someone else's (usually a junior person's) directions (usually more
inconvenient than the "obvious" way) on how things must be done?

Regards,

Kapil.

Friends.

We are always telling our website, www.chennailug.org as a single
point of contact.

My friends found that its difficult to find the link for joining mailing list.

Most people join in the Drupal system and complaining that no mails are coming.

So, we need to focus on "Join Mailinglist" link.

The link should be in top, bold, eye-caching, and focussed.

Please do the needful.

Thanks.

friends to join the mailing list they registered themselves in
http://chennailug.org/user/register instead of mailing list.

I found one reference to "open source" (page 3/40 )

"@ Government of India to standardise on 'open standard' and 'open source'
software. An IT standards-setting body would be spun out of BIS
(Bureau of Indian Standards)"

and  another reference to "open-source" (with a hyphen on page 23/40)

"The dream of a Rs.10,000-laptop cannot be realised with pre-loaded costly
commercial software. Therefore, our Government will actively promote free
open-source software, including the operating system, which would also
introduce the habit of innovation ('tinkering') in the student community."

Hello Guys ,

               I'm doing programming with PHP and I came across a difficult
situation where i couldn't get the exact logic of  Type conversion of  PHP
language . So expecting some  valuable  comments from you people..


The Code which laughed at me :

*<?php
echo (int)((0.1+0.7)*10);
?>*

As per the logic  *ANSWER should be "8" but i'm getting only "7"*.. why it
is so ???

if the code is written as

*echo ((0.1+0.7)*10); *
//or
*echo (float) ((0.1+0.7)*10);*

then no issues in getting the answer "8"..

In a Python REPL:

>>> 0.7 + 0.1
0.79999999999999993
>>> _ * 10
7.9999999999999991

Thanks a lot  Roshan , Ya i do agree with you and the same thing should
happen in php as well i guess but if it is so then

*echo (float) ((0.1+0.7)*10);
*
should print the value as "7.99999993" instead of "8".. so getting confused
here again..

Why python gives 7.99999993 instead of 8..wat was the logic behind that???

IMO, it is more than that - they loose control and this they are not

Yes, but I don't know how PHP works.  Should be easy to check up online.

Warning*

Never cast an unknown fraction to integer 
<http://phpbuilder.com/manual/en/language.types.integer.php>, as this 
can sometimes lead to unexpected results.

| <?php
echo (int) ( (0.1+0.7) * 10 ); // echoes 7!
?>|

(From: http://phpbuilder.com/manual/en/language.types.float.php)

It is typical that simple decimal fractions like /0.1/ or /0.7/ cannot 
be converted into their internal binary counterparts without a small 
loss of precision. This can lead to confusing results: for example, 
/floor((0.1+0.7)*10)/ will usually return /7/ instead of the expected 
/8/, since the internal representation will be something like /7.9/.

True. I was using thunderbird with an IMAP server for a while. The problem
will be if the laptop is stolen in which case all the emails could get

Install a web proxy like Squid and you can control the web
sites your users can access.

Squid plugins -- Dansguardian or Squid Guard are also
good options to try out.

Am just curious about why ELCOT supplies laptops with 3 different database
services
running.... IMHO, MySQL exor Postgres would suffice for schools.
I am kinda unsure as to what the tool is in SuSe. In fedora, the tool is
ntsysv. You can
use it to tune the startup process. You can use
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=89491
as a guide.

Use top to find what takes up the most cpu time. If you find it unnecessary,
nip it!

Also, as an extreme (is it?) step, you can install a lighter distro on it. I
hope that
doesnt  nullify the warranty. It should not.... For this, try the Fedora
Xfce spin. I found it
very usable. Or probably even Archlinux (takes some time setting up.
Installing core
takes 10 minutes. Then you have to install xorg and <DE/WM of your choice>).
It
starts with just core apps an you may then use it as a meta-distro. It is
very fast too.

If you are using a laptop, you should definitely look at using disk
encryption. Most recent mainstream distributions support this.

Dear LUGs,
                   ELCOT supplied acer laptops to schools. It is very slow
in performance. I stopped PostgreSQL, Mysql and oracle Database service and
bind etc. eventhough the system performance is slow.

Guidelines are needed to fine tune the system performence

Pollachi.

-----------------------------


Hi Padhu,

Performance varies according to hardware configuration.  Please note the following tips:


    * Be sure the swap partition size is double of RAM.
    * Use the 'top' command to view which processes consume more CPU power.
    * If you are not using samba, disable 'nmb' and 'smb' services.
    * Disable print services
    * Disable smart card and bluetooth services whenever not in use.

Best Regards,

R Rajendhran

M$ will never stop trying (LOL)
M$ might have realised that SME 's are going fastly towards FOSS to cut down
costs expecially in this recession environment . This might  be one step to
get their businesses back, hope they wont succeed ;)

People from Microsoft approach government and do whatever (one could
tag it as lobby, persuade, sell, bribe, market etc.,) for their
products.

Was there an attempt from people from the Community/ FOSSY corporates
to meet the government officials. politicians, identifying the right
person to get FOSS done at the government level?

Was there an attempt of this kind? If not it is likely that M$ will
push and rush through.

If you mean an internal DVD writer that connects over the IDE interface
I use an LG GH22 with no trouble. Be aware that you need an 80-wire ATA
cable though, using a 40-wire cable gave me I/O errors.

Frankly, I've never heard of an internal DVD drive that didn't work with
Ubuntu. If you were looking for a USB DVD writer, then ignore this
reply.

It depends on your budget!  SATA Samsung/LG/Sony all of them are equally 
good.

The main thing you have to check is whether your motherboard's IDE/SATA 
chipset is supported by the 8.10 Ubuntu Linux kernel.

yes (i guess),

But personally i feel this isn't enough, we should have opposed/protested

I remember one mail in the list about Microsoft's open source web
page. I think they're gonna use it as a front-end in their effort to
woo companies to choose MS for FOSS. Politicians (many of them) may
not know a heck about FOSS. But entrepreneurs will always have a good
idea. Someone please talk to the politicians and educate them first!!
:)

Coming back to the 'open source' page, it looks really flattering. :)

Hi Bharathi,
I am willing to give a talk on SNORT - Open Source Intrusion
Detection/Prevention System. I have been contacted by one of the colleges
for a guest lecture on 28th.

If it is not possible to give a talk this month, I can surely give a talk on
SNORT next month meeting.

Give me a couple of days, I shall get back to you on my availability on
28th.

Have a Great Day.

Regards,
Lakshmi Narayanan N

Hi,
My institute is planning to conduct an online exam on our intranet. I
installed an LMS (Moodle) and used the quiz plug-in to create an online
test. Unfortunately I hadn't found a way to display integrals,
differentials, algebraic expressions etc. in the questions and
answer-choices.
I also think that moodle is an overkill for just a quiz. Any other options?
Let me know if there is a way to incorporate subscripts, superscripts,
integrals, Greek alphabet etc. in Moodle.

No idea about creating quizzes in Moodle but see if the low tech method 
below solves your need.

Does the quiz module allow pictures in the quiz?  If so, you could 
create the math expressions in OOo (or hand written), saved as PNG/JPG 
files and insert those files into the quiz questions.

Subject: [Ambassadors] Summer of Code at Fedora -- recruit; mentor a
developer; improve success
To: fedora-ambassadors-list@redhat.com


Fellow Ambassadors:

You are probably all familiar with the Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
Fedora has been a participant for several years, with each year
bringing more quality and quantity of student projects.

As of today's announced list, the Fedora Project is again a mentoring
organization for GSoC.  We are honored to have this distinction.
Google has scaled the program back in resources and budget in light of
the global economy; there is less to go around.  I am confident
Fedora's record in GSoC helped us to be selected again.

There are two ways I am asking for your help:

1. The timeline is short for students to propose projects.  (The
  application period opens 23 March, application deadline is 03
  April.)  We need your help finding students and ... most
  importantly ... identifying passionate students who understand the
  commitment they are making.

  The Summer of Code is a *full time job*, a minimum of 40 hours a
  week for a few months of the Summer term.

  The project is real work on real open source.

2. Do you have ideas you want to mentor a student to work on?  You do
  not have to be a coder to mentor a student.  You need to get the
  student connected to the right resources.

  For example, I am not a programmer and I mentored Dimitris Glezos
  two years ago for GSoC when he developed the first version of
  Transifex and https://translate.fedoraproject.org.  Last year
  Dimitris mentored another student to work on additions to
  Transifex.  (This year Dimitris formed a company around
  Transifex, http://indifex.com.)

  Now, I was fortunate -- Dimitris was an easy student to mentor,
  partially because he was already involved in the Fedora community.
  Perhaps your student could already be a Fedora participant or
  contributor?

To help with #1, point students at:

http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/redhat

To help with #2, start with this page -- use the mentor request form:

http://groups.google.com/group/redhat-summer-mentors

If you have ideas, put them on this page as soon as possible:

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_coding_2009

... and join us on the Google group 'redhat-summer-mentors' to discuss
how you can participate.

Thanks - Karsten

I too had a similar requirement and tried
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcexam , but I had issues with LDAP
integeration eventually used Drupal with quiz module. I know even that is
overkill for quiz.

If you know LaTeX/TeX you can use the "exam" style to create pdf
forms.

If you need to convert this to HTML (with or without JS). You can
use "TeX4HT" or "HeVeA" for that.

There are other ways. For example "asciidoc" allows you to convert
LaTeX/TeX math into (X)HTML+"jsmath" which displays quite nicely on a
capable browser with the jsmath fonts.

I have looked at "moodle" but not used it. Isn't there a plugin for
LaTeX/TeX?

Regards,

Kapil.

Hi,

Try eXe(eLearning XHTML editor).

exe helps in the design, development and publishing of web-based learning
and teaching materials *without the need to become proficient in HTML or
complicated web-publishing applications.

*Using exe you can easily create quiz.  After creating, it can imported into
the LMS(Moodle).

For installing eXe refer

They are already using open source in their portal..  The company that 
is handling their IT operation is Tetra (tetrain.com)  which is doing 
business on open source consulting.

Regarding their IT Vision, the following points are appreciated..

* 2 MBPS Internet connection at every village.  (its possible, 
considering the fact that EVDO provides up to 2.4 MBPS even in smaller 
towns)..
*  To standardise open standard and open source.
* Promotion of IT in Indian Languages..  -- i think, if they implement 
this, its a boost for more penetration of open source to our people, who 
dont know english..

any way.. if other political parties also follow this, then the open 
source concept will spread to people through election..  (people will 
atleast want know what open source is)

Message-ID: <c9ea6e770903191157g71177d25pb9e41659bcb1aa4e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

i have 4 older system (200 to 500 mhz) with me, and would like to use that
as thin client for the computer center that i propose to set in my village.
I am planning to use Ubuntu Server for this.  I am doing this in my village,
to set it as a small village information center (with internet), and also as
a center for teaching basics of open source to the school students.  (few
college going students are also there).

Since i dont have experience in setting up think client, i would like to
know, if we can run GUI applications in the thin client, or whether we can
use only command line interface.  Is it possible to run Mozilla browser?  If
so,can we install Ubuntu Desktop in those thin clients?

If any of you have any suggestions on other ways we can use this thin client
setup, its welcome.

I am doing this as pilot project with hardwardes available with me..  Based
on the outcome, i am planning to setup such a lab in the primary goverrnment
school in my village.

Whatever it is, I'm certain that political parties aren't trying to
woo us to vote for them! :)
Yes. It would be really wonderful to have a country up and running on FOSS..

I remember reading somewhere, ZDNet i think, that this will draw flak
from the proprietary software community and that there'll be lots of
obstacles and hindrances from 'enemies', Microsoft topping the list..
I won't be surprised of Microsoft agrees to develop a basic open
source OS for the smartphones which the BJP plans to distribute if
they come to power. :)

Recently, i heard from my neighbour that microsoft is selecting students
from various engineering colleges for training abroad..  my neighbour's
daughter  also got selected, and they were so thrilled upon this..

While i could understand the tactics of microsoft, i could not explain it to
them as they might not understand..  Microsoft is canvassing by the lure of
travel abroad and also creating a hype..

Although am not a Ubuntu user, but I guess installing packages from
non-official-ubuntu source most of the times give you that caution msg.
This is because the system is unable to verify the pkg signature as
authentic or not. Maybe others can through some light on how to add the
pkg signing key in Ubuntu/Debian.

Dear Senthil,

Your option of using thin clients is viable.  No OS will be running at the client and all the processing and video rendering will be done at the server level as in this link:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuLTSP/LTSPWiring



There is a good documentation for Linux Terminal Services Project under Ubuntu in this link:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuLTSP

Hi Senthil,

Great initiative on your part.  Wish you success in the project.

You can take two approaches, both will require a "desktop" installation 
to act as a server for the thin clients.

See my response below.

There is no need to install Ubuntu Server, instead you need a "central 
desktop server".  Install Ubuntu desktop with all the possible 
applications that you think will be useful.  This will act as 
the "desktop server" for your thin clients.

There is no need for a Ubuntu desktop on the thin client - the desktop 
on the thin client is a remote display of the desktop running on 
the "desktop server" with the Ubuntu desktop.

The two approaches for thin clients:

a) The thin client boots off of the network card - PXE boot.  The 
Ubuntu "desktop server" is also configured to respond to thin clients 
and bring up the desktop on thin client display.  For more info see the 
LTSP website www.ltsp.org.  Ubuntu has the LTSP packages.  I have not 
had much success with this method but IIRC, some members on this list 
have implemented such a solution.

b) The thin client has a small Linux installation loaded on a compact 
flash or usb disk or cdrom.  The client boots off this image with the 
necessary network, X display software.  It can then remote a display 
from the "desktop server" via X, TightVNC etc.  Read more at 
http://www.thinstation.org.

Figure cost (include time to deploy) v/s functionality and choose.

I agree with it..  Ramadoss may not be understanding what kenneth 
says..  but he wants to bring about a change..  i had known him and 
although i dont agree with what he says, calling him fanatic may be rude..

I request ramadoss to be flexible and understand the larger context of 
the environment we are working in..  tamil cannot be brought in this way 
by sending mails in tamil to a list which comprises of all people..

If ramadoss could show some flexibility, we can promote localisation 
through this group itself using english as common meduim..

It is possible. However Kenneth Gonsalves has said previously that the

1) In SuSE most of the common admin tasks are done through YAST
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux uses the more common 1 thing for a task
and that done well - Unix philosophy

2) SuSE is known to provide proprietary codecs for which they end up in
deals with companies like Real Networks (for mp3 ripping)
    Red Hat firmly believes in its F/OSS roots and does not do this.

3) Both look good. SuSE is KDE/Gnome while RHEL is Gnome/KDE

4)

might help too

Both have done a lot for the F/OSS community. SuSE has given us
Beagle, helped XGL/Compiz and Mono
Red Hat on the other hand also employs many kernel and gnome developers,
provides lots of system-config-* tools. They are also developing packagekit
now to provide a uniform interface among distros for package management

The reason why distributions setup signed package repositories is
that in the big-bad internet there are people who will try to inject
buggy packages "just for fun" and sometimes for money!

This risk is potentially as great as that of viruses in Windows. Let
me say that again --- as that of viruses in Windows.

In addition to what is written below you may want to read what Wouter
Verhelst has to say:
 http://www.grep.be/blog/en/computer/debian/apt-gpg

So how does one go about verifying packages that are not "known"
repositories:

1. Setup a basic Web of Trust. Get together with a collection of
friends and generate individual keys and sign each other's keys.

2. Whenever you verify that a certain package source is dependable,
(this means you should either know and trust the author not to inject
malicious code or have looked at the source to check it) sign
that repository gpg key.

3. When adding a new repository get the repository key and check it's
signatures and validity values. If the validity value is already 1
then you can use the repo. If not see if there are signatures there
that you know and trust. In the second case you can probably use the
repo with some care.

Note that (1) and (2) are essentially the only way that (3) will work
in the long run.

Regards,

Kapil.

egroupware (www.egroupware.org) - it has many more modules but no 
accounts, you can turn on/off specific modules on an user basis.

We are happy with egroupware.

What kind of accounts? dotproject can calculate costs based on time
and division of work.

Hello,
   I have Sun Sparc v210 server in my college. That machine does not have
any CD ROM drive. I need to install Ubuntu in it using NetBoot. Will Ubuntu
install in Sun Sparc v210. Please provide me directions on how to install
Ubuntu in it. I tried netbooting almost ten times but in vain. Is Ubuntu
well supported on Sun or shall I try out someother distributions. If so then
which distro will be the best. I also need to install linux on Sun Blade
1500 machines. Please provide me directions for that also.

It is not really about one party or the other, I guess. There seems to be a
good level awareness among Government officials about need for open
standards.

Have a look at this tender document for developing and maintaining website
for Income Tax  Department.
http://incometaxindia.gov.in/archive/TenderWebMaster.zip

It talks about Non-proprietory Document Formats, Accessibility Issues, CSS
based design and sets the eligibility criteria quite low (at Rs 50 lakh per
annum turnover for 3 years).

The requirements look designed for a open source solution provider to bid
low enough and win the contract. Any proprietary software based bid does not
stand a chance, if (a big IF) an open source bids goes through the first
rounds.

Best regards,

Ma Sivakumar

Hi,

I want to make a connection from a FC10 machine to a vpn box. I currently
connect to the box from a Windows Machine using "VPN Client" (this is the

Can you install NetworkManager-vpnc and check if you can add this VPN

By the way, it is Fedora10 and not FedoraCore/FC10 :)

Ramadoss is one of the few people I have total respect for. He is passionate, 
he works hard and he inspires people. Unfortunately he is also a tamil 
fanatic. The common man cannot understand his language - and FOSS suffers.

NetworkManager-vpnc has been installed, however how do I load the .pcf file

If NetworkManager is running, then a left-click should allow you to do
VPN Connections -> Configure VPN and, thereon Add a configuration
file.

Run "perl -V" and see the contents of the @INC array.  This lists all include
paths where perl looks for additional modules.

Note that you can make perl look into additional folders by specifying the
-I flag or manipulating the @INC variable.

The installation procedure is different if you want to install the
package for yourself (eg on a shared hosting provider), or for
all users (eg on your own box).  There are some distro specific
ways of doing this too.

These CPAN instructions should get you started:
http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#How_install_Perl_modules

Running "perldoc perlmodinstall" should also get you the details.

ps does not give you the whole story.  A process may be sharing
libraries with several other processes, have memory mapped
files, etc.

pmap gives you the exact break up.

The above machine has a Sun Ultra Sparc CPU.  Ubuntu does not have a 
release for Sparc CPU.

Your best bet is Debian 
<http://mirrors.kernel.org/debian-cd/current/sparc/>

IIRC, most major Linux distros have dropped support for Sparc CPU.

Please do your home work - find out the CPU in these boxes.  Again your 
best bet might be to stick with Debian and find the appropriate iso 
image for the CPU in these boxes.

You can do a top -p <pid> once you get the pid of the process (from
ps). Also, if you're running a recent version of top, hitting 'H' will
toggle between displaying individual thread statistics and a
consolidated view (if it's a multi-threaded process)

Have you gotten it installed or are you trying to use it as a live cd?

If live cd: give it some time to load.

If installed: try to login into a command line, use ctrl+alt+F2 when
it asks for you username and password and check for Xserver errors in
/etc/X11/  folder.

Hello,

Did you do anything different each time? I have a method which you
may find useful.

Whenever, I start *anything* new I take a small notebook and a pencil
and write down each step so that I will know each thing which I tried
and when it worked and when it failed.

This is particularly useful with computers since they are (more than
any other gadget!) required to the produce the same output in response
to the same input.

> It opens till the desktop like screen,but later *it hangs

What does "hang" mean? Does the keyboard not give any sign of
working? When you press CapsLock or NumLock key do the relevant lights
go on/off on the keyboard/computer?  Does the mouse not give any sign
of moving the pointer on the screen? Have you tried Ctrl-Alt-F1 to
switch to the text console?

In fact, to help you it would help if you clearly spell out what you
mean by Ubuntu 8.10. Did you use the Live CD? Did you install to Hard
disk?

Regards,

Kapil.

P.S. "2" is not a word in English or any other language! The word is
"to" or "two".

Friends.

I want to know how much memory does a process takes.

How to know this?

Redmine indeed is a good project management tool. We've stopped using it 
in favor of a web-based product maybe an year back (after the sysadmin 
overhead on maintaining so many apps got to me and we went all-cloud), 
but it never disappointed me.

ActiveCollab was a fairly popular open source rip-off of Basecamp (the 
big-daddy of project management web products, which I don't like all 
that much) but seems like they've gone closed-source recently. Here's an 
open-source fork, you might like this if you want a PHP alternative:

Use DBI for Oracle to fetch table data. Use Spreadsheet::Write to create the csv file.
 Spreadsheet::Write  help is at 
http://search.cpan.org/~amaltsev/Spreadsheet-Write-0.03/lib/Spreadsheet/Write.pm

Or even simpler may be using Spreadsheet-Writeexcel-fromdbquery. See at

Subject: [Ilugc] ROBOX - 09 Event Report
Message-ID: <ed2d3c000903202117p64a160c1i48cdf1eaaa83a5a1@mail.gmail.com>

Hello luggies,

ROBOX - 09 is the annual event on Robotics conducted  between 19-21 MARCH
2009 by the "cyborg engineers"(a tech club)  comprised of staff and students
of Kamban Engg College, Thiruvanamalai .The event showcased about 20
exhibits of Robo/automation module. The highlight of this event is most of
the modules are build upon arduino development kit.More info on arduino ref
www.arduino.cc. The arduino development kit is used for programming atmel
mega8 mcu.  To my knowledge majority of the contributors build the circuits
all by themselves, coded the softwares, integrated them and exhibited. It is
really fun and interesting to work with the team of Kamban Engg college, to
add here, let me mention the vision and support of HOD of Dept of CSE
Mr.Jyothish Kumar, and to mention  the workmenship of the students  who made
the dream into reality.

There were exhibits of "water tank automation module", which will take
roughly Rs 200/- make your overhead head tank keeping it full by automating
your pump. The exhibit is more like a production module. There were many
exhibits on robots, some of them to mention here is a balancing robo, which
has 2 wheels and stands upright with the help of  mcu board and a ping ultra
sound sensor. The next exhibit is to mention is the ardrumo project,taking
notes from (http://www.tinker.it/en/Tutorials/Ardrumo), The software were
programmed by taking the signals from 6 peizo transducers and by polling
method it is made to play a mp3 files(with different drums sounds). Though
it performed, the student were advised to make a DBUS way of communication
for better result instead of polling method. There were exhibits on traffic
light automations.

Raman and myself addressed the gathering, where Raaman took a class on
Principles of "Free and Open source software ". Arulalan (ilugc) , engineers
of Arunai engineering and myself worked on RAD, the ruby lang way of coding
a micro processor(ref for RAD at http://rad.rubyforge.org). Arulalan made
the tutorial on how to install Rad on ubuntu 8.04(he will be posting the
document to the mailing list later).

I wholeheartedly thank the college administration, students of kamban
engineering college(one of them to note is Siva moorthy who is a ilugc
member),Ramaan ,Arulalan(ilugc), Engineering community from Jaya Engg
College, IFT college, Arunai Engg college) to make event a mega success.
Last but not the least a big thanks to support from Aanjhan who gave is
support in chat for all the question which i raised.

"Jai Ho" arduino.
"jai Ho" Foss

thanks and regards
Thyagarajan Shanmugham

updated to this thread by the end of the day).

Message-ID: <5526f5a10903210503w41e84534maa5a836a987e0721@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

One of my friends was asking me to suggest a good Asset management tool. His
requirement is

1. Maintenance of asset details (configurations, locations, numbers to call
for service, escalation matrix etc.)

2. Service History (parts replaced, defects rectified etc.)

3. Status (Working; Not working - service call booked, escalated, service
visit completed but problem not rectified, awaiting replacement of failed
parts etc.) Online ping is not very important as most machines would not be
constantly connected.
4. Must be web-enabled

The challenge is that he has deployed systems, printers and other
peripherals at 186 locations and these are not interconnected. There will be
some people who will be updating the records.

Apart from this, he has got lot of machines under Annual Maintenance
Contract. So, he needs to know about these machines and also he wants to
integrate it to Trouble Ticketing ( Great - if you people suggest Ticketing
system also which has integrated Asset Management tool also)

Thanks in Advance

i dont know if kenneth said that, but in any case, this is not quite true. 
this mail server hosts things other than this mailing list. because of that, 
it is not possible for the list admin (who is also sys admin) to filter out 
faniq, hi5 whatever at the server level. actually, the subject of this mail 
poses the correct question - if anyone is aware of any way to get mailman to 
do this, i will be happy to implement it. the quote attributed to kenneth is 
right in the sense that i really dont have time to write code that will add 
this functionality to mailman.

One of the possibilities is to go to

 http://<hostname>/cgi-bin/mailman/admin/<listname>/privacy/sender

Here you will find the form entry

 List of non-member addresses whose postings will be automatically discarded. 

This entry can take a regular expression and so can be used to match
an address like '^[^@]*@bad.sending.domain.com'

I'm not sure if this would work if the se domains use "genuine"
sender addresses.

Kapil.

Am afraid what the social networking sites do is use the email id of the 
member, who has compromised his email account's address book, to send 
the emails rather using an email id containing it's domain. Hence it is 
not possible to filter out the mail as it comes from a genuine email id, 
which unfortunately is also the email id that the member has registered 
to this list.

Hello Friends,

Currently i am doing my B.E final year project in MAEMO ( Mobile
Application Platform for Nokia internet tablets) embedded linux
development. To start with this platform i have chosen to create an
scientific calculator and successfully came through the GTK+/ C. I
have created GUI with enough signals to perform the operations. Now i
have to convert my source ( In C ) into an debian package. As i have
searched many times i could not come across the steps and cant get it.
Please can anyone know it means kindly help me to complete it.

In this particular case, the From header showed 
'"Lakshmi M" <noreply@ci.faniq.com>'  I have found this to be the case 
in most of the invites from such sites and hence I have posed the 
question.

I just re read your question. You dont "convert" your C source to a debian
package.
You compile it into a binary (some tool, I presume dh-make, will do this).
All you have
to do is to write the recepie.

There are two types of "from" headers in a mail --- the envelope
"From " header and the "From:" header. 

The first header is the one seen by the mail server.

The second one is seen by your mail reading/writing software. (As far
as the mail server is concerned it is part of the content of the
mail).

With most sites adopting SPF records[*], the faking of the first header
is generally avoided by most mail servers. However, I haven't checked
what these social networking sites do.

The faking of the second is almost legitimate since almost no one
bothers to digitally sign e-mail anyway. :-(

So this at least _can_ be filtered. So can most sites that conform
with SPF (or reverse MX records).

Regards,

Kapil.

[*] SPF records means that a domain (say imsc.res.in) provides (via
DNS) a list of hosts (say math.tifr.res.in, mail.imsc.res.in) which
are authorized to send mail with an envelope "From " address like
"user@imsc.res.in". Any mail receiving server which received mail
with such a "From " address from any *other* server can legitimately
reject it. (Or even if they don't reject it they can use it to
increase the spam score).

Hi,

         CentOS is one of the best choice. Because it is derived from 'Red
Hat Enterprise Edition 5'
which is a leading server Linux OS.

Welcome to packaging for Debian!

Depending on the complexity of your program you probably already have
a chain like "configure, make, make install".

At all points of time you should be reading the Debian Maintainer's
Guide (also "maint-guide" as a Debian package).  At most points of
time you can ask for help on the Debian mailing list debian-mentors or
on the IRC channel #debian-mentors on irc.debian.org.

The basic structure of a debian source package is:
 1. Upstream source (in your case your own source) which is 
    packed as pkgname_a.b.orig.tar.gz where a.b. is the version
    number
 2. A pngname_a.b-c.diff.gz which contains the stuff you add
    to the upstream source for packaging requirements.
 3. A "signature" file pkgname_a.b-c.dsc which contains signatures
    of these two files authenticated by the person making the
    package.
You will not in general create these "by hand" --- except the first
which you have anyway created. :-)

The tools to build packages in debian begin with "build-essential"
which you must install. Other such packages are mentioned below.

When you unpack these source packages (download any typical small
source package with "apt-get source pkgname" to have a look), you will
get a directory of the form pkgname-a.b which contains the original
upstream source with the patch in the diff.gz applied. In particular,
there will be a sub-directory of pkgname-a.b called "debian/" which
contains the Debian packaging information. (In fact, many .diff.gz's
only contain this subdirectory).

The program "dh-make" will help you to create a typical "debian/"
directory which uses "debhelper" toolkit for packaging. Other
alternatives are possible.

This much should be enough to get you started (and it is getting late
as well!). As I said above, read the documentation and don't hesitate
to ask on the appropriate forums.

Regards,

Kapil.

Choose any distro. Spend some time learning the tools you actually
want to use like apache, mysql, php and svn.

Go for Debian.
The GOD of Linux.

Ubuntu also fine.

Redhat and CentOS have marketed fame.

There is no big difference between the Distros to worry about the server
setup.

Has anyone done such a setup sing the sw raid on any Linux distro?

A as ILUGC member I was given a chance to speak in the inaugural function about the FOSS. After this I took a 3 hour session on introduction to FOSS and installation, usage etc to about 40 students. The response was good.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank the management,staff and students of LCR college..

I thank Prof.Kumaran of Jaya Engg college for taking the initiative in promoting FOSS and also giving us an opportunity.

If you are comfortable with Red Hat Package Management use CentOS.
Or else Debian is perfect.

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "you can't get it", could you elaborate?

Setting up your project to use automake has always seemed a bit arcane to me.
Here is a good tutorial on it:

Subject: [Ilugc] Debian5.0 - Unable to write to NTFS partition!
Message-ID: <1237696791.3352.6.camel@debian>

Hi All,

I use a dual boot system (Win XP + Debian 5.0). Win XP has NTFS.
I tried moving some Debian CD image files to WIndows partiton  to
free up some space in Linux partition.

Even as root , I was unable to move these iso files to windows
partition, with error message that permission is denied!

My /etc/fstab file is given below:
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0

/dev/sda10      none            swap    sw              0       0
/dev/hda        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0

/dev/sda6       /media/wine     ntfs    rw,user,auto        2    2
/dev/sda7       /media/winf     ntfs    rw,user,auto         3    3
/dev/sda8       /media/wing     ntfs    rw,user,auto        4    4

I thought read / write support to NTFS is enabled in DEbian a long time
ago!
What is to be done to enable me to write to NTFS partiton?

Have a look at /usr/share/doc/autotools-dev/README.Debian.gz. Even
though it is specific for Debian packaging, I found it very useful.

Hi !

I am bringing up a Debian system. I would like to know which is the best
method for auto log in ( both as root and as non-root user).

This a small dedicated system with very limited resources and so there is no

The easiest way is to use KDevelop and create a automake based project.

Start with Makefile tutorials. For example:

http://oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu/~bhumphre/makefile.html

Then read:
http://markuskimius.wikidot.com/programming:tut:autotools

Next read:
http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/autotools.html

And finally try to write your own configure.ac, Makefile.am for a
simple .c source file and test it.

Kindly confirm the status, as otherwise this would mean a problem in

Is the following ftp site the mirror? http://ftp.iitm.ac.in/ubuntu/

I can access it and downloading packages from there works fine.

Edit your /etc/inittab and get mingetty to auto login or spawn
your shell directly.

I believe mingetty --autologin option is what you are looking for.

If you run into any issues auto logging as root, use the
--loginprog option to start a different shell script or program
instead of the default /bin/login.

inittab/mingetty is highly configurable, so you can also for
example setup mingetty to ask for password on console, but
auto login on serial console.

I had similar setups a few years ago when Linux did not have
native raid10 support.  So I had to create two raid1 devices
and then stripe them with a raid0 device on top.

My setup worked well enough for me to put into production use,
and I think they are still running.

Instead of layering multiple raid levels, new Linux kernels offer
native raid10 support.  I have not used this, it would be good
to research this further before making a decision.

Do not do it this way.  If a single disk fails, the rebuild will take
too long.  Better way to setup is like this:

md0 = raid1 sda+sdc
md1 = raid1 sdb+sdd
md2 = raid0 md0+md1
mkfs on md2

In case of sda failure, only sda+sdc need to be re-synced.

Doing it your way will mean that md0 and md1 need to be
re-synced and will take double the time.


Note that as long as you are not doing RAID parity computation,
as in RAID5/6, SW raid has absolutely no CPU hit.  SW RAID0/1
are all good in my book.

I was able to load the pcf file. However, how do I start the communication
to the vpn server. I mean in Windows, there is another device created for
the VPN connection. How does it work here. How do I route traffic for the
specific IP addresses to the VPN box.

Did you click on the VPN Connection as seen from the VPN Connections
and check if it asks you for details that will enable you to connect
to the vpn server ?

Hi to all,

           I have downloaded ImageMagick for comparing images in the
database. But while trying to install rpm package of ImageMagick it gives
the following error:

        [root@localhost Desktop]# rpm -Uvh ImageMagick-6.5.0-5.i586.rpm
        error: Failed dependencies:

        rpmlib(FileDigests) <= 4.6.0-1 is needed by ImageMagick-6.5.0-5.i586


Please tell me where could i find all those files which are needed by
ImageMagick to install and whether those files are necessary for ImageMagick
to function properly.

it looks like you are using the wrong rpm package for your distro. Why do you 
not use yum?

While using yum i get this

[root@localhost Desktop]# yum install imagemagick
Loading "installonlyn" plugin
Setting up Install Process
Parsing package install arguments
Nothing to do


I think i have ImageMagick installed but it is an older version ImageMagick
6.2.9 but i need the latest version because MagickWand supports ImageMagick
6.3.5 or greater. So please tell me how to upgrade existing installation or
install a fresh package.

Manually download the packages from sites like:
http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=libIex.so.6
http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/3/srodzaj/1/search/libIex.so.6

and then install them.

No,It implies that they are available in package repository and can be
installed.

To find out whether a package is installed or not try
"rpm -qil <packagename>"

example:"rpm -qil  ImageMagick"

I don't see a problem. You searched for imagemagick and it shows that it
is available in the repository.  Your version of Fedora is EOL'ed and
won't get security updates though and you should look at upgrading to a
current maintained version, either Fedora 9 or 10. Yum in recent
versions is a little more smarter.

Now i removed existing ImageMagick and tried installing a fresh copy of it
thro the use of yum....  But it shows that ImageMagick 6.3.2.9-3.fc7 is
available for download. I need the latest package to install so that it
supports MagickWand and when i downloaded ImageMagick form its site and
tried to install it shows that the following packages are needed


*Missing Dependency: libImath.so.6 is needed by package ImageMagick
Missing Dependency: libHalf.so.6 is needed by package ImageMagick
Missing Dependency: libdjvulibre.so.21 is needed by package ImageMagick
Missing Dependency: libltdl.so.7 is needed by package ImageMagick
Missing Dependency: libIex.so.6 is needed by package ImageMagick
Missing Dependency: libIlmThread.so.6 is needed by package ImageMagick
Missing Dependency: libIlmImf.so.6 is needed by package ImageMagick*


Where can i find all those files or is there any other alternative to
install fresh copy of ImageMagick.

simplest thing is upgrade to FC10 - otherwise you are going to get into a

Upgrading should not be the default solution.

Of course, if you need to support the latest hardware or have the
newest features of some software then there may be no other option.

However, there _should_ be the option of testing newer software
without having to install/upgrade a working system.

For Debian, there is debootstrap. I believe that for Fedora there is
"mock" --- but I haven't learnt to use it yet. (TODO!)

Sure but if you want to actually use the latest software in many cases,
you do have to upgrade.

mock is for building packages in a chroot (somewhat like pbuilder in
Debian) and more targeted towards developers. The equivalent of
debootstrap is febootstrap.

Hi All,

Many have sent a mail regarding the chennailug.org site that it is not
functioning as expected. login fails. cannot change pwd... etc

we are trying to get the control panel from the person who owns this domain.


once we get that, we should be able to fix it. we are hoping to fix this by
week.

after the fix, you will see lots of improvements to the website.

also suggest things if you have any thing.

chennailug.org currently uses CivicCRM + Drupal + MediaWiki.

It is called php-magickwand in Fedora.

please help me to get out of this problem.

I tried to install MagickWand manually in Fedora10 but the installation
steps are difficult for me to understand which are as shown.


MagickWand Extension for PHP :: Installation Instructions

** REQUIRED **  ImageMagick version :: 6.3.5-9
Last-known-good ImageMagick version :: 6.3.5-9


Installation Steps

1) Either install the required ImageMagick version or make sure that it
   is installed (running "Wand-config --version" should give you the
   required information).

2) Extract the contents of the archive this file was in, or copy the
   entire directory the this file is in (make sure that it is still called
   "magickwand") to the "ext" directory in the PHP source folder. So, if
   your PHP source folder is called "PHP_SRC_DIR", you should end up with
   a directory structure like the following:

   PHP_SRC_DIR/ext/magickwand/

3) Go into the "PHP_SRC_DIR/ext/magickwand/" directory, and run "phpize".
   (A note: if this is the first time PHP is being installed, you have to
   install PHP without MagickWand, because "phpize" is a part of the PHP
   distribution.)

4) Go back to the main PHP source directory (from the example above, it
   would be "PHP_SRC_DIR", and run:

   rm ./configure

   and then

   ./buildconf --force

   to remove and rebuild the PHP configure script.

5) Follow the PHP installation instructions, but add

   --with-magickwand=IMG_MGCK_DIR

   to your ./configure command, replacing "IMG_MGCK_DIR" with the full path
   of the directory where ImageMagick is installed (in most cases "/usr").


I couldnt get the source directory of php and also cannot run phpize command
as it shows invalid command. Please luggies, explain these steps in a clear
way.........




Thanks in advance.

Most packages come with a "install" or a "readme" file.  It typically 
has instructions, if the packages needs some special setting.   These 
files are in the /usr/share/doc path.

There must be such a file for the magickwand package.  Have you searched 
for such instructions?

Hi Rajesh,

From

I would suggest filing an error report so the developers can work on this.

The best way to have problems such as this evaluated is to file an
issue. Issued are used to both report defects in the software and to
propose that new features be added. For instructions on how to file an
issue please see:

<http://openoffice.peschtra.com/tips/ooott_web_iz_file_issue.html>

Thanks for bringing this to our attention. It is important that you
file the issue to ensure reproducibility with your examples.

You have to file a case for open office developers with the details of
how to reproduce it.

This might be hard to believe . But looks like all major political parties
are using/promoting FOSS !
Congress:
Has no special agenda for FOSS .
Uses PHP for it's webpage http://www.aicc.org.in . The site according to an
article in globalvoicesonline is still in web 1.0
 But it's recent andhra pradesh site http://votecong.com/ also uses PHP and
runs Joomla content Management site on it . This site has some blogs of
political  leaders but doesn't allow users to comment on it !

BJP:
released a special agenda for FOSS .
http://www.lkadvani.in/eng/images/stories/it-vision.pdf
Uses foss on it's site www.bjp.org .BJP  has pledged to use open source
software and support open standards .
BJP used FOSS for cutting down costs , whats more innovative from BJP is
using a open source repository management (eprints ) for it's documents .
Appointed special IT incharge for every loksabha seat ( surprise )

CPIM:
uses mailman , in it's manifesto http://cpim.org/manifesto.pdf clearly
states that " Promoting free software and other such new technologies, which
are free from monopoly ownership through copyrights or patents; ?knowledge
commons? should be promoted across disciplines, like
biotechnology and drug discovery"
The new election site http://vote.cpim.org/ runs on drupal . The website
they state is done enttirely on free software and is contributed by
volunteers from Kochi free software notably also states that it has a " Free
software and Research team "

 DMK: I can't understand the site www.dmk.in much but it looks pretty
old "Viewed
best with IE 4.0 & Netscape 4.0 and Above with 800x600 screen resolution "
LOL , it makes me download a tamil font ,which I am not sure is a free font
? (amachu do check it ;) )

AIADMK: couldn't find a official website :(

All said and done check
http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/03/22/indias-first-digital-elections/

So what do we observe, three main political parties using FOSS , though
little they ARE somehow dependent on FOSS . Other than kerala we haven't
seen much of government support in FOSS.
Suddenly Microsoft comes and tells that it is cutting down costs for
governement and these people go and sign a MOU with it .
What I would like to tell is FOSS is not a cheap software for cutting costs
, it is quality software for which code has been contributed and tested by
lot of volunteers :)
Finally I just wish BOSS was properly designed and implemented in all the
governement offices all over India .

Regards,
Pavithran

Hi !

Thanks !

following this idea I googled and got some resources... and this worked

===========================================================

First you need to edit the /etc/inittab file

#nano /etc/inittab

look for the following line

1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1

and commentout

#1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1

add the following line

1:2345:respawn:/bin/login -f YOUR_USER_NAME tty1 </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1

Save and exit the file

Now you need to edit .bash_profile and at the bottom add  the following
command and save

startx "

=============================================================

Now after booting it executes a program which added in .xinitrc .

Perfect !


Now I need a bootsplash  to complete the project ! Any Ideas ?

Cheers

Thanks much for sharing your experience on nested raid.  I found the 
following discussion also very useful.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_RAID_levels>

There is no doubt, it needs to be planned out and then implemented.

The main motivation for considering RAID, I want to implement VMs with 
the virtual disks on RAID to take advantage of striping.

I am wondering if is there any significant advantage of doing sw RAID 
1+0 (4 disks) v/s sw RAID5 (3 disks).

Thanks again.

Avoid sw RAID 5 like the plague!

RAID 10 has following advantages:

1. far less computational overhead on CPU.  If you run sw RAID5,
the CPU does the parity computation.  This has the bad side effect
of flushing the CPU cache on every write and results in terrible
performance.


2. even hardware RAID5 is to be avoided for write intensive workloads.
This is because if you write less than a full RAID5 stripe width, you
incur the read-modify-write penalty.  You end up doing 3 x more IO
for every write and performance is terrible.  Even higher end SAN
arrays have this limitation.  The way they solve it is by having huge
battery backed RAM caches, and tuning the RAID stripe width
according to application IO.

RAID1 has no such issues.

Note: check out ZFS -- RAIDZ always does full stripe writes and thus
has no issues with read-modify-write.  ZFS also has other nice
features.


3. 4 HDDs instead of 3 HDDs will give you better performance.


4. RAID10 recovery is much easier and faster.  In a large RAID5 set,
if a disk fails, the entire set needs to be read for rebuilding the failed
disk.  In large TB sized raid groups, rebuild can take 8hrs or more.
RAID6, etc with dual parity can overcome this issue.

Rebuild of RAID10 is much faster as only 2 disks need to be read
for a rebuild.


I also suggest that you consult the Best Practices documents of
you VM vendor.  VMWare, Citrix Xen and Microsoft Hyper-V
websites have excellent documentation on how the IO subsystem
needs to be configured for optimal working of their solutions.

MagickWand for PHP

*******************************************************************************

MagickWand for PHP is a native PHP interface to the new ImageMagick
MagickWand
API.

It is an almost complete port of the ImageMagick C API, excluding some
X-Server
related functionality, and progress monitoring.

The functionality of the MagickWand API is pretty much unparalelled in the
PHP
imaging world, allowing the PHP programmer read/write/manipulate access to
multiple image formats, along with vector drawing, pixel-level manipulation,
and special effects capabilities and more.

*******************************************************************************

ImageMagick (in general) has a fairly high learning curve, but the new
MagickWand API, on which this extension is based, is a thousand times
clearer,
and as a result, easier to understand and manipulate.

It is still complex, to a degree, but it it is capable of some amazing
stuff,
so it is well worth the time and effort to learn it.

However, it is in many ways still beta software. Both the ImageMagick
MagickWand C API, and MagickWand for PHP are apparently stable, but they
still
need testing, so take that into account.

MagickWand for PHP tries to stay up to date with the latest releases of
ImageMagick, so if your PHP compilation fails with an error in some "zif_"
function about references to a function that can't be found, you most likely
need to update your ImageMagick to the last version MagickWand is known to
have successfully compiled against (see INSTALL in this directory for that
information).

The last-known-good ImageMagick version, as well as the required ImageMagick
version, will always be indicated at the top of the INSTALL file in this
directory, and notations will be put in the ChangeLog file as well.

*******************************************************************************

Check the ChangeLog and INSTALL files for more necessary information.

The ./docs folder contains the manual.

The ./demo folder contains 3 files (so far):
  demo.gif   : an example script-generated animated GIF file
  demo.php   : the script which generates the demo.gif file
  demo_c.php : the same script with very detailed comments

*******************************************************************************

So, intrepid traveller, forth, to the journey!



Here it is not mentioned anything about configuring magickwand. I want to
run MagickWand codes in php to compare images. Please suggest any other
alternative.

Is their any way by which I can identify which process uses the swap

compared to other process. It would be better if any open source tool
can let us know 

the process and associated libraries uses most of the swap memory.

The INSTALL file of MagickWand is shown below


MagickWand Extension for PHP :: Installation Instructions

** REQUIRED **  ImageMagick version :: 6.3.5-9
Last-known-good ImageMagick version :: 6.3.5-9


Installation Steps


1) Either install the required ImageMagick version or make sure that it
   is installed (running "Wand-config --version" should give you the
   required information).

2) Extract the contents of the archive this file was in, or copy the

   entire directory the this file is in (make sure that it is still called
   "magickwand") to the "ext" directory in the PHP source folder. So, if
   your PHP source folder is called "PHP_SRC_DIR", you should end up with

   a directory structure like the following:

   PHP_SRC_DIR/ext/magickwand/

3) Go into the "PHP_SRC_DIR/ext/magickwand/" directory, and run "phpize".
   (A note: if this is the first time PHP is being installed, you have to

   install PHP without MagickWand, because "phpize" is a part of the PHP
   distribution.)

4) Go back to the main PHP source directory (from the example above, it
   would be "PHP_SRC_DIR", and run:


   rm ./configure

   and then

   ./buildconf --force

   to remove and rebuild the PHP configure script.

5) Follow the PHP installation instructions, but add

   --with-magickwand=IMG_MGCK_DIR


   to your ./configure command, replacing "IMG_MGCK_DIR" with the full path
   of the directory where ImageMagick is installed (in most cases "/usr").


But i dont know the location of php source directory and i installed
magickwand thro 'yum'.
I didnt know exactly where yum has placed the files of MagickWand.

AFAIK, there is no single tool, which can tell the swap useage of a
process. Use ps, top, vmstat, lsof to find the result and look into
/proc/PID/ files also.

True..

I have one suggestion though... it is very advantageous if you can use a
RAID card instead of using the CPU for RAID..

Hard ware Raid is much advised if you are planning a server with high IO..
Many adaptec cards are now having exzcellent support with Linux and other
open source operating systems.

I agree too, but for now it is out of my budget.  I'd rather buy the 
extra hard disk than spend $150+ on an decent entry level SATA RAID 
card.

This particular server, is for our own office; don't anticipate disk IO 
as an issue w.r.t software RAID.

On the hardware RAID, I prefer the LSI cards (Megaraid, Symbios/NCR); 
costs are comparable to Adaptec, and they supported open source drivers 
from way back circa 1995 IIRC.  Whereas, Adaptec has been a convert the 
last few years.  Just my opinion :)

Hello Siva,

During one of our load test we noticed nearly 40% of memory was utilized
by swap. But we couldn't confirm the process responsible for swap
utilization. As everybody aware that swap utilization will have an
adverse effect on the application performance. We experimented few tools
and 
1. Top command doesn't provide the utilization by process. 
2. To use pmap we need to provide the process id of each process.

I found a tool exmap which gives a clear picture of what happens during
a 
load test means the swap utilization and the process and shared
libraries 
Responsible for that unfortunately we aren't able to build the tool for
Redhat. Exmap libraries are created mostly for debian and ubuntu
distros.

Exmap:

Thanks

How do you expect anyone to solve your problem if you don't provide

Hi Sharukh,

It is great that you are making an effort to embrace FOSS.  

However, there are a few things that you will need to do before you are 
upto speed on any Linux distribution.

From this thread and your past postings, I think you need to work on the 
following points. 

1. Build up basic knowledge of the package manager that distribution 
uses (deb, rpm, tar.gz etc.).  Specifically to Fedora, rpm is the 
package manager rpm --help will give all the options.  Experiment with 
each option and analyze the output.  Likewise, read up on yum for 
Redhat/Fedora, zypper for openSUSE, the set of apt commands for Debian 
based distributions. 

2. Build up basic knowledge of networking - not the kernel IP stack but 
how networks are put together.  Most developers I have come across are 
clueless about networking.  Again, this will make you a better 
developer because you will understand how the application you are 
writing must work in a networked environment.  

3. Build up basic knowledge of System Admin.  IMO, every developer must 
know basic sys admin.  With admin knowledge you will be a better 
developer and think about writing secure applications from ground up 
and not an afterthought.  You will also be able to install/remove 
packages without going through rounds of questions on the mailing list.

Each distribution comes with documentation about itself.  Please start 
reading them up. 

At a minimum create a list of the installed packages:

a. rpm -qa --pipe=sort > installed_rpms whenever you install/delete 
packages.  Want to know if a package is installed? 
egrep -i "package_name" installed_rpms!

b. Install find-utils or equivalent and use the "locate -i " to search 
for files.  Also run updatedb whenever you install/delete packages, 
this will update the db for the locate command.

c. when you know the file name and want to know the package it belongs 
to do "rpm -qf /path/to/filename"

d. read up on --queryformat option of rpm and start creating customized 
reports of your installation.


IMO, the above will help you "help yourself"

This is not enough information for anyone to help you over a mailing
list. 

Some sample questions of the type you should answer:

1. Are you using text-mode console or GUI when the system hangs?

2. After the "hang" and before pressing reset button have you tried any
   of the following?
    (a) Ctrl+Alt+F1 --> should give text-mode console
    (b) Alt+Sysrq+K --> should kill the X server or the current login
    (c) Num Lock/Caps Lock --> Appropriate led's should come on or
        off.

3. 5 minutes is enough for you to record your dmesg output and/or the
   output of lspci -v and/or the output of acpitool. Can you provide
   these outputs?

If you really want to debug the FC10 crash you need to answer
questions like those above.

As far as I understand it, Fedora Core is a distribution aimed
at "developers" --- in particular, this means that you should be
interested in debugging problems with your system (at least to the
extent of filing complete bug reports) if you run FC. The same applies
to Debian "testing" or Ubuntu six-monthly releases.

For a system aimed at "users" you should look towards RHEL/CentOS or
Debian stable or Ubuntu LTS or ... . Of course, on such a system you
will not get the "latesht" software by default but you will not have
to debug problems with such software either! If you need to run such
software it is safer and better to use some form of virtualisation to
run it so that crashes will not affect your system as a whole. For
example, FC10 will probably run quite well in kvm or qemu or
virtualbox. Setting up such a virtual system takes less time and
eventually involves less pain than debugging hardware issues.

Regards,

Kapil.
P.S. Note that "developers" and "users" are within quotes since I
think that it is not a black-and-white classification.

need to insist(!) that you do not want to have the Windows model).

Is it available as a module in the mainstream distros?  Google search 
showed me blogs of fuse-ZFS experience in Linux.

Thanks for confirming my own conclusion.

What is your opinion vis-a-vis performance of Filesystem on LVM on top 
of RAID 10 v/s Filesystem on the RAID devices. Any experience with such 
a setup?  

I think creating separate partitions for data and virtual disks might be 
the way to go.  The partitions for data can be on LVM and the 
partitions for virtual disks w/o LVM i.e. fs created on the raid 
device.

The solutions under consideration are openVZ, kvm, and xen.  I have not 
made my mind yet.  I have also looked at parallels and it looks pretty 
interesting.

Please be aware that LUG members are not "know all or be all" of 
everything under the FOSS umbrella; even collectively IMO :)

A quick Google search leads me to believe that magickwand is an 
extension/API of ImageMagick.

If I were in your place, I would join the ImageMagick forums/mailing 
lists and discuss my problems there; the ImageMagick/MagickWand gurus 
are likely to hang around there and answer user queries.  Check out

Quoting from the "Overview" document at Fedora Project.

  Our Method

   Fedora is a center for innovation in free and open source software,
   and creates a community where developers and free software and open
   source enthusiasts come together to advance the ecosystem for the
   benefit of everybody.

It says developers *and* enthusiasts. My translation of this is that
those who write the code and those who help to debug it by using it. I
put these under the "umbrella" term of developers which was wrong.

Regards,

Kapil.

that's the community that develops it - the distro is meant to be used by 
users - like you (a professional developer), me (an amateur developer) and our 
respective aunties (who use it to surf, check email and process words). RHEL 
is meant for corporates who want paid support - and I have no idea for whom 
CentOS is meant.

There are a few alternatives listed at the bottom. Or, you could go for

If you want production quality ZFS, you need Solaris or Open Solaris.
FreeBSD 7.0 has ZFS natively, but it's not production quality, neither is
the Mac OSX ZFS port.

There's no measurable performance impact due to LVM.  But it does
add one layer of complexity during recovery etc, so I ended up not
using it in my setups.

The only advantage I saw with LVM was file system snapshots.  However
as I recently found out, LVM based snapshots are terribly slow, and
performance suffers is you enable them.

The IO requirements and best practices hold good across all virtualization
implementations.  Best you read all the recommendations before arriving
at a conclusion.

If by "any OS" you mean different versions of GNU/Linux, then
installing the OS is as easy as for any laptop. In fact, since
most manufacturers of netbooks are supplying models with GNU/Linux
pre-installed, the hardware of those models is *more* compatible with
Linux than a generic laptop.

One difference is that there is no CD drive so your OS must be
installed from a USB stick.

Any clues.

I have already configured auth which seems similar to what is mentioned in

.htaccess file. Yet, I am facing the issue or continuous prompts.

uh, corporates who dont care for paid support, but want the distro to remain 
fully functional? fedora is not suitable for production servers (like the one 
serving this list). why? this very server has suffered an outage because a set 
of updates resulted in a documented "yp is broken with this set of updates".

we have got one more from faniq this morning, so i waded through the mail logs 
to see what was there. the envelope sender matches the domain (faniq), so the 
server has no issues with this mail and spf is of no help.

how? i am using the web front end for reading the mails on this list, so i 
really cant see what is in the headers. it appears to be html. i am guessing 
that the legitimate subscribed user address is there somewhere (since mailman 
is not treating the mail as being from non-subscribed address) but there is 
some html mailto pointing to noreply@faniq.com which is what the html archived 
mail shows. if a kindly user using standard mail delivery mode on this list 
will forward todays faniq - giridhar mail with full headers to me (not to the 
list), i can look over it to see what is there and see if any filtering would 
be possible.

Ditto.  

CentOS is binary compatible with upstream (RHEL).  Third party product 
certified on upstream is also compatible with CentOS. Upstream fixes 
are available on CentOS w/o any paid subscription.  Of course, that 
does not remove the onus of due diligence on the consumer's part.  

The CentOS team does not just build the binaries.  It goes through it's 
own QA e.g. CentOS 5.3 I believe is going through QA even though RHEL 
5.3 has been in the market for a few weeks now.  Perhaps, Karanbir can 
shed more info on this.

thanks.

unfortunately, it is of no help. i dont know what exactly i am looking 
for, but it is not there in the attachment - the from header is containing 
only the giridhar name and faniq mail id, which cannot be correct. mailman 
is seeing the legit gmail id of the user somewhere, else it will not get 
posted to the list (list is set to discard posts from non members).

I tried that first, I even tried placing the file in different locations.
Changing the permissions and ownership. It just doesn't seem to work.

Can someone using fedora10, try this and see if this issue occurs for them
upon accessing rhl4 directory.

#htpasswd -c /mount/repositories/av1984_apache_authfile ashish
*/*use password as password*/*

#cat /mount/repositories/av1984_apache_authfile

Please take the time to read the std out/err.  IMO, the application is 
giving you enough information on the console as to what is wrong.

Suggest you rename it to .av1984_apache_authfile otherwise to prevent 
others gaining access to this file by giving the full path.

Aren't these parameter required when using .htaccess file. Are these
required when the access is controlled from the httpd.conf file also. The
above configuration works in Fedora9. Am not sure, but this may either be
change in functioning of Apache or a bug.

I think the thread got a bit confusing, the above remarks about SPF
was to clarify "spoofed senders".

I didn't want to suggest that SPF be used for mailman filtering. Sorry
for the confusion.

What I tried to suggest is that mailman *can* filter mail since these
sites are unlikely to spoof enveleope senders in a way that violates SPF.

Whether this can be done by using mailman's sender filters or by
using procmail before mailman needs to be checked.

Kapil.

What method are you referring to besides .htaccess?  How are doing 
access control from the httpd.conf?

Have you tried the above and verified whether it works or not?

BTW, looks like you are running your own server and thus I would suggest 
to changes perms to 400 and ownership to the uid of the apache user, on 
the passwd and the .htaccess (if any) file(s).

Here's something from my blog -
http://techlog.mehulved.com/http:/techlog.mehulved.com/uncategorized/installing-maradns
Once the basic installation is done, check
http://www.maradns.org/tutorial/tutorial.html for guides, man pages,
etc.
And please don't top post.

The best way to get your problems with FC10 problems solved is to
test it and submit accurate bug reports. Who knows, in the process of
investigating the bug clearly you may solve it yourself!

If you want security now and in future, it's best to stick with distro
provided apps and packages.  Staying within distro packages means
that there is official support for bug fixes, and any updates are a simple
yum/apt update away.  You can also take advantage of the quality
testing that distros put together.

If you install 3rd party packages, how will you ensure that you
stay current with future bug fixes and who's providing you the
quality assurance?

After all isn't this why you are paying Red Hat?


I've used djbdns, etc briefly, but never saw the appeal.  I run bind9 on
CentOS today without any issues.  bind is the defacto DNS server out
there, it's widely available on several unix platforms, it's well supported,
and exceptionally well documented.

RHEL 5 supports bind9.  I suggest you try it before you switch.

Hello all,
Can anyone explain the economics of a typical FOSS based business...
Say for example, if we take a FOSS company like Mozilla, what is its exact business model ?
Since Mozilla software is free to download, where does the company actually making money ?

This economic side of FOSS is still vague in many of our minds in this mailing list including me.

I cannot see what you mean by that. How can 40% of memory be used by the

Play around with ps -x or pmap
might be what you need. It maps the current process list to pmap

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=foss+business+models will help. In the specific
case of Firefox, search engines like Google and Yahoo share revenue
based on the number of ad clicks they get via people using Firefox.

Here is an article that will help you to get more confused. :-) [*]

http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3809221/Bruce-Perens-Is-Open-Source-Capitalist-or-Communist.htm

[*] As many great thinkers have said:

  Great confusion precedes true understanding

By providing the auth configs in the <Directory> context in the httpd.conf
file. This is supposed to be more secure than .htaccess method.

I have tried this method also and still it doesn't seem to work.

Are you running Fedora, if yes, can you try the above configs on your system
and see if works for you.

This economic side of FOSS is still vague in many of our minds in this
mailing list including me.



We just saw sun being valued  for 6 Billion USD.  According to market cap
and revene data, I would say Redhat should be valued little less than Sun.
 Together Sun and Redhat are the two most important and successful FOSS
companies out in todays industry.

PS: I don't answer your question. But I guess these data are relevant.

Moreover, can you give us an idea of the difference in their respective

Hi Friends,

Now i am going to finish my B.E.Final year Engineering within two months. I
am really interested to work with open source. And i have fairly knowledge
in that too.
I have attended the OSI tech days at chennai. Then i came to know that Ruby
on rails, Django and LAMP. Which one i choose to learn and continue with
that career and also I done my Final year project in Maemo-Mobile
Application Development.
Now really Confused with these things whether to continue the same mobile
application development jobs or to start with new career. Can you give me a
guidance please.

Regards,
Nithi

Since you have invested some time in Maemo , there is a question to be
asked at this point in time why you want to leave that ? have you
tried applying for a Job with Nokia showing interest in working on
Maemo if you have contributed something to it half of your job  is
already secured , talk to the right project leads or owners for a day
job or intern ship to begin with.

Coming to the question of scripting languages they come handy in your
day to day activities , i call them transferable skills through jobs ,
so it will help and does not hurt learning few scripting languages
when you are idling around.

So coming back to the basic question of Mobile Maemo/Android/Symbian
etc VS Web Applications at some point they meet in certain
applications so it will be a Handy skill to have . An employer will
prefer a Guy who is focussed on a product or platform if there focus
in Product development and if they are service oriented they generally
prefer a person with multiple skills.

so it all boils down to where you want to go Product company or
Service company or want to create a Service or Product company of your
own!!!

AMD is a company name. Platform names would be either x86 or x86_64. You
can get both (including PPC) at http://get.fedoraproject.org.

That's the default option in http://get.fedoraproject.org. AMD and Intel
share the same base instruction set and Fedora x86 would work on both,
of course.

Hi Luggies,

I am unable to allow a particular site to a particular person.
For example, ceo is unable to access mail-sites since it is already blocked by squidGurad.

The ceo user can browse other sites . But not gmail,eventhough I have allowed gmail.com? in /etc/squid/allowedsites.txt with proper permissions.

These are all my ACL in my squid.conf,

acl our_networks src 192.168.1.0/24
acl ceo src 192.168.1.8
acl normal_users src? 192.168.1.59 192.168.1.60 192.168.1.61 192.168.1.62
acl allowedsites url_regex -i "/etc/squid/allowedsites.txt"
http_access allow ceo allowed_sites
http_access deny !normal_users
http_access allow localhost
http_access deny all

Please point me where I did mistake?

Thanks & Regards

I wish to share my experience so far with Multi-seat Linux using mdm display manager in this meet, though I may not be able to demonstrate.

Message-ID: <1ab425940903260420y7da58ed5gc762d26f5d662325@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Luggies;

I have installed php-magickwand successfully and ran the sample codes
available in some sites. I have modified the code to compare two images
located in the same folder. But i dont know what is the output of the
compare function. I have pasted the code of my program


$resource = NewMagickWand();
MagickReadImage( $resource, 'testpic.jpg' );

$resource2 = NewMagickWand();
MagickReadImage( $resource2, 'image_1.jpg' );

MagickCompareImages( $resource, $resource2, MW_MeanSquaredErrorMetric);


Please tell me how to compare images using this function so that if both
images are the same then an error message can be displayed otherwise the
image should be stored in the database. I have the codings of storing images
in database but to implement it i need to know the output of the image
compare function.


Thanks in advance.............

Comparing images is not so easy.  I could take a JPG image and save it
in PNG format.  The images are the same to a human observer, but the
bit patterns on disk are totally different.

Further, I can take an image and change contrast, brightness, color,
move, crop, scale, sharpen, blurr, etc and humans will still say the
images are same.

Getting a computer to do this is not so easy.  And there's no magic
strcmp like command which can tell you with absolute confidence if
two images "are the same".

Try reading www.imagemagick.org/Usage/compare/ and understand
what the compare command does to your data set.  Try it with different
photos and understand how the different comparison algorithms work.
After you do this, you can then think of coding it in php.

Repeatedly pleading for help with your project is not a good way to
complete your project.  At this rate, it looks like most your assignment
is done by the luggies!  Suggest you approach your project mentor
(you have one don't you?) for advice.

Searching for this task, i hit upon the following

Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a way to index or find a similarity
between images in a multimedia database. There are methods such as Fourier
Transform, Hough Transform, Wavelet Transform, Gabor Transform, and Hadamard
transform coefficients to be used as the engine in the CBIR system.
Retrieval by image content has received great attention in the last decades.
Several techniques have been proposed to solve the problem of finding or
indexing images based on their contents.

Hi All,

After several months (possibly years) of efforts, LinuXpert Systems has
developed a
complete FOSS Lab server to meet the demand of Academic institutions to
teach FOSS
using all the latest FOSS software collections available on the internet
including several new GNU/Linux distribuions,
linux kernel source code, 300+ foss softwares for windows, 15000+ cpan
archives, complete wikipedia,
extensive documentation like TLDP, GNU docs and other software manuals
(in Text, HTML, PS, PDF formats) with several pre-built features required
for academic institutions while teaching FOSS.

For Complete details about the foss lab server

What kind of certification course is that ? Your being desperate or
being drowning will definitely not help you getting job, on the
contrary a search can http://tinyurl.com/dxvrkr ?

I do not have numbers or surveys to  back but Admin Jobs are the easy
ones to come by and the companies are also accepting the  right
candidates with right attitude.

Job
1.Start learning and Teaching mailing list is great place to start.
2.Blog your experiences seen people making decent money  through blog posts.
3.No matter what you do it all boils down to Mindset link and network

The whole setup including hardware costs Rs.75k (including our commercial thinclient software).

The hardware box:

Intel Atom processor+MB
2GB RAM
1TB HDD
UMPC Cabinet
1 Onboard VGA, Ethernet, 6 USB Ports, 2 PS2 Ports

For academic institutions two days of free training (for teaching / non-teaching staffs) about FOSS software development.

Apart from organizing meetings every month, I think we should all
start spreading the word even more.. Linux is something most people in
the world don't know about, If they're told the advantages and if they
can see it, they'll surely switch. Yes. i'm talking about people with
a reasonably good understanding of computer. Just like I convinced my
dad after 5 months of endless discussions.. :D

Why don't we organize an event where we'll go to various
colleges/institutions and promote linux? Of course, the time
constraint is there. But we're a good number, aren't we? At least, we
can try and make it a point to convince atleast 1 person every two
weeks or so.. :)

Are you new to the list? Do you read archives?

The above are just in the month of march 2009 I managed to dig out :-)
Plus there are several un reported events being carried on by various
ILUGC people. So may I humbly ask, what is the point you are trying to
make here?

Thanks.

I'm not new to the list.. I'm only saying we should organize something
large-scale.. so that everyone can get to know what linux is.
Something like OSI tech days, without much of tech, concentrating on
why ppl should use linux..

Message-ID: <69a14f6e0903261128t172c35capb6a31c298c0fc7ad@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a open Suse 10.0 Machine and been comfortable and happy for 3 years
now. But had to resort to WinP to "work from home" primarily bcoz' of
internet connectivity issues. Now I've over come that and wish to use
Bluefish/Quanta ++ .
Now the problem is I tried using Yast with rpm and tarballs. The dependency
is unresolved, I've over 2 yrs worth of emails in evolution and the option
given by Yast is to remove evolution coz its dependency is not met by GTK
2.1.x but only on 2.0.x, where as Quanta needs a minimum of GTK 2.1.2...

plz suggest a roundabout (plz do not suggest me to archive the mails and
redeploy them)

But already a FOSS Lab Server is available  which caters to the demands of
Academic Institutions and was displayed at OSI Techdays.
How this is different from that? or its just reinventing the same wheel
which I suppose might not be a good idea.

You should not be downloading the latest rpm's for Bluefish and trying to
install them on an older Suse. Search for an rpm of Bluefish that is
compatible with Suse 10.

If you cannot get Bluefish for Suse 10 or insist on installing a more
recent version of Bluefish than, my "universal" solution to such
problems is to use a chroot/fakechroot created with the idea of using
Bluefish/Quanta++.

  Its Last month ILUG-C and NRCFOSS  along with the TCE -Madurai had
organized the FOSSCONF  an open source event, which was even bigger than OSI
tech days. May i know by that time where, where you are ???


so that everyone can get to know what linux is.
> Something like OSI tech days,

OSI tech days is on the another hand, is  an promotional activity by a
compnay to increase  its circulation [1].

[1] The above point is my opinion, not to hurt or pin point any
body/organization.

Does NRC-FOSS commercially providing the setup for institutions alongwith the hardware box or has any 
institutions already using your foss lab server.  

just require for information purpose only.

Interesting to note that both the flyer[1] that was linked by Baskar
of Linuxpert and the contents of the wiki page are identical. I am not
sure whether LinuxPert academy was involved in the NRCFOSS - Deeproot
FOSS Server thing, but going from the kind of info Baskar has asked,
looks like something is wrong :-)

dear baskar:
i am curious about your queries -- it looks as though you are absolutely
unaware of FOSS Lab Server from NRCFOSS.

FOSS Lab Server was demonstrated at FOSS.IN 2006, and later set up at a few
colleges by NRCFOSS team. Mr. Abhas Abhinav of Deep Root had set it up in
some more places. The info about FOSS Lab Server had been put up in nrcfoss
official web site and helpline website.

For the past six months, I have been discussing with you and a few others
about offering to the colleges in an effective manner and providing
necessary support services. In fact, I had clarified to you that while Abhas
was involved in the developement, he was not expected to be the sole service
provider.

I do hope that you can fix up with Prof CNK to meet him and to discuss --
primarily about your interest in associating with NRCFOSS re interactions
with academic institutions, and could also discuss about your views re FOSS
Lab Server.

with best wishes

dear prakash:
Baskar has come up with a version of FOSS Lab Server -- as he felt that the
colleges has a need for it.  He had also asked me about NRCFOSS FOSS
electives and I presume he had picked up the info from the relevant web
pages.

Just as there are many linux distros, some of us could come up with
different ways of providing material to colleges. Of course, the perspective
might differ.

the one thing we have in common with him is the understanding that "download
from net" may not be viable option at many places.

we are working in the realm of free/open source software. anybody could
build afresh or from existing material.

from my point of view, the USP of Baskar is that he could reach out to
colleges. In fact, we had briefly discussed about how NRCFOSS could support
his visits. Since we have been in a transition stage, the discussions were
ongoing and I suggested that he should also meet up with Prof CNK. [the fact
that I was moving off to C-DAC was also a minor factor].

we have to seek collaboration, not collision.

with best wishes
Srinivasan.

Am afraid what Aanjhan actually pondered about was the similarity of
the contents describing the same product, claimed to be made by two
different parties where one is interested in installing it in
educational institutions, if am not wrong free of cost if the
interested organization is able to provide the required hardware on
their own costs, while the other party provided it free only for a
day's evaluation.

Although the FOSS Lab Server developed by DeepRoot Linux for NRCFOSS
has been released under GPL, and hence others can make copies of it
and distribute it for money, the question being raised is how similar
or how connected are these two products of the same purpose and same
name? Also the content of the flier by Linuxpert system is almost an
exact copy of the one by NRCFOSS, which am not sure about the license
under which it is published, except the paragraph reading,

""'The FOSS Lab Server has been developed for NRCFOSS by DeepRoot
Linux, Bangalore, and has been released under GPL. """

has been replaced by,

"""
-- The FOSS Lab Server has been developed by LinuXpert Systems,
Chennai, a reputed
organization who have been providing FOSS support and solutions for academic
institutions since 2003 and most of the softwares provided in the FOSS
Lab Server are
compliance with GNU GPL or Other Open Source compatible licenses.

Note: The FOSS Lab server is provided one day free for evaluation purposes.
        (for academic institutions only)
"""
which for ordinary eyes looks like a blatant plagiarism unless the
former content has been available under a license which allows such
copies and modification.

As I myself had witnessed the effort that DeepRoot had put in this
product, during my tenure at NRCFOSS, I myself stand for the fact that
the FOSS Lab Server from DeepRoot is original and not copied from
somebody else. What we are wondering about is another product of the
same purpose, same name but being claimed to have developed from
somebody else who have also used the same content describing the
product.

I agree that, the open source world allowed to recreate/modify or come up
with own idea. There is no controversy on his idea/work what he achieved.
The thing is, cant accept he is not aware of NRCFOSS's FOSSLab server.

After this thread I discussed with our colleague and he confirmed that he
visited; specifically asked FOSSLab server flyer and got it from our stall.

Personally, my mind could not accept your creditability reg his(?) fosslab
server work.

Yes, we have built our own FOSS Lab server realizing the need for it after a lot of
interaction with many technical institutions in Tamilnadu (nearly 300 institutions in the past 6 years)

Again yes, some of the info has been picked up from NRC-FOSS pages. If Mr. Prakash feels for
that, then I apologize for using that info.

Over the period of  8 years, I have collected these software mainly providing for 
educational purpose and also I have distributed more than few thousands CD/DVDs freely
for many academic institutions, whereever I used to go. 

I download nearly 4GB per day, and now we have about 5TB of FOSS software collections, 
including the latest release of LInux kernel 2.6.29 and all top distributions listed in
www.distrowatch.com

Many organizations/institutions/individuals contact us, after visiting the following URL

>the one thing we have in common with him is the understanding that "download

That's the main reason behind developing our own FOSS Lab Server.

The FOSS Lab Server has been demonstrated to more than 20 colleges as of now
in the past 3 months and also received few orders for them. (our FOSS Lab Server
is backed with commercial support for 3 years including updates).

Since we have been in a transition stage, the discussions were

I had already discussed with Prof. CNK in his office and showed our product
to him and explained about the features in it.

>we have to seek collaboration, not collision.

We do seek collaboration and not collision.

To Mr. Prakash A.S
----------------------------

LinuXpert Systems has been providing FOSS solutions/support for educational institutions  since 2003 
(even before NRC-FOSS, which was started in 2005) and we have already developed many products for 
educational needs and now the FOSS Lab Server is one among them.

Hi,

As others have said, comparing images for similarity is really hard.
However, if your object is simply to check if an image is identical
(completely the same), you could simply check the MD5 hashes of the two
images.

I know about fossconf. and I was very much in chennai at that time.. :)
I'm talking about the reach OSI Tech Days had.. Of course, it ain't
easy to organize one..
I'm sure OSI Tech Days was organized pretty well.. Not that fossconf
wasn't. But if we have to get the message through, we need to organize
something better than OSI.. Even if its going to be once in two

The problem with  'WE' in 'we have to organise' is  how many WE are available physically, how many WE can get sponsors, how many WE have contacts in media etc. Also OSI type events are very costly and in my opinion Rupee/visitor ratio is very expensive.

We (I mean ILUGC) being an informal organisation the best is to do
a.College seminar/workshop etc. So far we are doing mostly in engg
  colleges. We should catch Science and polytechnics also.
b.LDD the way we did at MIT, Asan and Planetarium.
c.Each member does something in his sphere of influence.
d.Try to contact other professional bodies like CSI, IEEE etc
   and do awarness campaigns.
e.We should identiy, motivate (if needed support financially)
  talented students like sudharshan, sivaj, selva etc, so that
  India contributes to FOSS, instead of just a consumer.
f.Schools require some attention from us. There are lot educational
  tools in FOSS unutilised by us. Based on fossconf experience where
  two schools did exceedingly well, I feel we should focus here.

Of course, there is no point in planning, thinking, collecting idea, discussing future .... etc, there are have  no meaning if we don't do.
And we cannot do, if we do not have enough physically present volunteers.

So please volunteer to the events. 

Bhargav, I think you are a student, can you please try something in your college?

I think it is only in a maximally free market economy like the USA
that people would think of a "public good" as something to be created
by "market forces". Software grew in the USA and so it has acquired
the economics of that country!

It's almost true that most of the seminar/workshop programs is being done only in engg. colleges.  Last week
monday, I went to a Arts and Science college near Arcot to meet the CS HOD (who is also my well wisher).

He requested me to give a talk about FOSS and its importance to their PG students (M.C.A, M.Sc. IT).
When I expressed my willingness, within less than 10 minutes he gathered around 50-55 students and informed
about the activities of me and company and after that, I gave a talk about one hour in the class room and also
showed some demonstration on FOSS tools to students and staffs. Finally, HOD introduced me to the principal
and the principal was inspired to know about the benefits of FOSS and questioned HOD, when everything is available 
freely, then why they are purchasing proprietary softwares and also assured to use FOSS tools from the next academic year.

The sys. admin of the college installed codeblocks with GCC for windows (replacing Turbo-C) and MySQL for windows in few machines, when I was there.

So, as Mr. Raman says, more importance has to be given for Science colleges and Polytechnics.  Many of my
programs were also in Arts, Science colleges and Polytechnics (and especially in many rural areas).

http://linuxbaskar.googlepages.com

>c.Each member does something in his sphere of influence.

For doing a single day program for just 6 hrs in Ramnad, our ILUGC member Mr Ravi Jaya travel
about nearly 1000 km from Bangalore to Ramnad and back. (Thanks Ravi)

I am sure that, FOSS has reached many colleges here than any other state in INDIA.

All our programs were not just showcases about FOSS, but also to identify, motivate young
talented students to contribute to FOSS.

Many times in this list, we see ideas/discussions/thinking/planning from many people and when I post a request for

How this tool differs from acpitool?

* Please initialize your global variables. Pointer variables need to
be initialized to NULL.

* Don't use magic numbers like "/proc/acpi/battery". Please #define
them before you use them.

* What happens if /proc is not mounted or not available on a system?
Recent distros use sysfs.

* You need to check return status of function calls before you use them!

* Your coding style needs to be consistent. Please try to follow one.

* You put comments in webattery.h file, but, there are no comments in
webattery.c! Atleast put a comment line before each function stating
what it does.

* You need to have autotools sources (configure.ac, Makefile.am) in
your sources directory. It needs to check for presence of header,
library files, gcc etc.

* Your install target in your Makefile requires sudo for "cp -f
webattery /bin/". The same for linking that you do.

* You also need an uninstall target in your Makefile.

* README, and INSTALL files don't require a license header. You
already have put a LICENSE file in your sources directory.

* It is good to keep code within 80x25, for readability reasons.

* In future, before you do a project please do check if any such FOSS
tool exists. Re-inventing the wheel is not encouraged.

Adding to the list of reading material suggested by others:

Introduction to Economic Analysis by Preston McAfee. Its available at
http://www.introecon.com

Its hard core economics book which I hear (no, I have not read it )
covers the economics of abundance - the underlying philosophy of free
stuff - in contrast with the economics of scarcity - on which
philosophy much of today's laws and business models are framed.

Do tell us if you find it worthwhile :-)

Hi !

I saw some posts regarding LUGC meeting and cost of conference halls etc.

I am just wondering why should not be possible to have a  web based ILUGC
conference ?

So that everybody can participate ? With so many geeks around  it should not
be a difficult task .

I would like to examine what is involved in order to achieve this .... at
least as an academic exercise .

$ acpitool


Sorry for this. I dont know about acpitool. I wrote webattery for my
personnel use as it become popular with my friends circle, I thought it
will be use full to everyone. So I planned to release it as a project.


  


Webattery is taking its neccessary details from
/proc/acpi/battery/*/{info,state}. and webattery output will be little
different than acpitool.


  


You can expect additional features in short period.

Mr.Baskar,

Just curious.

Today's h/w box cost at www.deltapage.com:
 Intel Atom processor+MB  - 3500 /-
+
2GB RAM - 1000 /-
+
1TB HDD   5000/-
+
 UMPC Cabinet  1500/-

= 11000 /-

So does your s/w cost 75k - 11k = 64k !!!!!

Is the source code of the lab server available free?

Your calculation is right.  But, downloaded 1TB of all latest distros, documentations, source code
from various websites/repositories, organized for easy access, configuration of mail server, mailing list, mediawiki,
wordpress, automatic single click remote installation of distros and several other features and backed
with 3 years of support adds that another 64K. (plus our commercial thinclient which is widely
used by many educational institutions (which helped them saving several lakhs of rupees spent for costly hardware upgrades and maintenance for years) itself worth that 64k)

If curious, you can see the demo in our office and really you would get excited.

All the source code is part of the lab server and available free only.

What software (server) will you use for A/V conference?  Who will host 
the conferencing server?  Does the host have the bandwidth to support 
simultaneous client connection @ 640x480 res. to say 10 "centres" where 
geeks can congregate?

I remember a story where an ex-employee is called to fix a machine that was
troubling folks for a long time in a factory. He came in, turned a few bolts
and it was all up and running smoothly. He sends a bill for $1000 and the
manager scoffs asking a question " $1000 to turn a few bolts?". The guy
replies "No. $10 for turning the bolts and $990 for knowing which ones to
turn and by how much."

It is always an issue when one has to price knowhow. It does take a
significant amount of time, resources, commitment and drive to get to a
position where one can do things easily. I used to run a similar business 12
years ago. I used to price my services at 50% of the licence cost of an
equivalent M$ solution. I had a fledging business then before I moved on.

am not sure about the host .....may be have to look at commercial hosting ?

Common Man - Kilpauk Kandaswamy,

Allow me the liberty of answering your question. I am not sure whether Mr.
Baskar offers the source for free to everyone. If he does, that shows his
generosity.

To follow licence terms of open source software, he just needs to provide
source code to those *who bought his server. *Not to everyone.

I admire Baskar for the persistent efforts his company has been making to
bring Open Source options to educational institutions. As he had pointed
out, he has been doing it for over 5 years.

Efforts by Linux User Groups should be complimented by commercial offers
such as Linuxpert Academy for open source to thrive.

Disclaimer : I have met Baskar only once in a Linux Demo Day and just said
hello. I do not recall any other personal or professional communication with
him.

Best regards,

Ma Sivakumar

Hi !

There is discussion going on about economics of open source in this forum.

Please go through the discussions and enlighten yourself !

Thanks.  Looks very interesting.

Bandwidth is the main thing to be considered.  Putting this of the top 
of my head - for A/V each "client" you will need about 256Kbps 
upstream/downstream.  The server will have to support the stream for 
all the conference clients - the b/w requirement grows.

I am not sure if any commercial hosting will support such an 
application.

Hi !

Why not ? it is just $$$$ !

You can get dedicated hosting with root access and any amount of traffic !
It costs lot of money that is all !

Anyone can get the source for free, possibly on Sundays @ my office (pl. bring external storage
devices for getting them and don't request on optical media)

For those who buy the server, they get everything as per the open source software licenses.
(softwares, source code, documentation).  I remember that RMS did this way when he started GNU project
by selling emacs on tapes for a few dollars. (RMS essays on Free Software, Free Society is included in the server)

Every successful FOSS business, whether it's small/big thrives this way only.

Who is footing the bill?  This thread started with the proposal to have

Please ask them if you can host a web conferencing package.  All 
the "unlimited" packages have a hidden cap, you find out only after 
heavy usage of their resources!

Yes  , I asked them and they just go by the bandwidth. It is pretty
expensive though !

But DIMDIM hosted version is okay. Something affordable say $99 per year
for 20 member size meetings.

Dear Mr.Baskar,

Just curious.You have not explicitly mentioned the License under which
your so called
 "FOSS Webstore Server" is distributed. You just mentioned the license
of the s/w's present in "FOSS Webstore Server", not about the
"Server"'s license.Could you please elaborate?

Hello,

I appreciate the efforts of everyone who tries to set up a
software business given the way in which the entire expectation of
manufacturers, users and the public is skewed by the way in which this
has been done over the last 20 years or so. However, corrections are
required!

That is not what the GPLv2 says. Quoting from section 3.

     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

(Emphasis provided by me.) This is why the customisation provided by
RedHat (which is extensive!) is available to the people who
distribute CentOS --- all that is not available is the branding.

Kapil H. Paranjape.

Sorry for the top post.


Somewhere in your config you need to mention which domains can be
considered local and which ones are remote.  I don't see this in your
config below.

After this step, you'll also need to configure your server to permit
mail relaying. This ensures that clients can send mail to non-local
domains by using your smtp server as a relay host.

HTH.

--------- Forwarded Content --------------

I will try to keep this brief and to the point. This message has been
cross posted to several lists which will explain why you might get
more than one copy. I hope you find it informative too. Send all
flames to me, not to the lists.

I'm taking off the other hats I wear for a moment to ask for you or
your company's support of Freenode [1] (technically the Peer-Directed
Projects Center or PDPC) now based in the United Kingdom. For those
that don't know, Freenode is an IRC [2] network supporting Open Source
and Free Software communities globally. Another PDPC activity is the
annual FOSSCON conference in the fall. PDPC is specifically [3]
raising funds in order to be recognized by the UK as an official
charitable organization. This status has many benefits, however they
need to raise a certain amount of money by March, 2009. There are
just a few days left in the fundraising campaign.

Canonical Ltd. (the company created by Mark Shuttleworth that drives
Ubuntu Linux) has graciously stepped forward to provide dollar for
dollar matching, magnifying the impact of your donations to PDPC. The
fund raising goal has almost been reached but your contribution is
needed. Brainstorming by the PDPC board of directors for how to use
any funds not used for operations includes hosting live conference
events in Europe and the US, extending current services and improving
the reliability of the freenode network by hosting a few of their own
hubs and backup systems. Freenode is growing rapidly [4] supporting
up to 57,000 concurrent users up from a maximum of about 40,000 18
months ago.

Some people may not be aware that IRC is used by a huge array of Open
Source and Free Software projects. The list of groups [5] Freenode
works with is truly impressive. I feel it is not at all hyperbole to
say that the work done over freenode and OFTC [6] are the real-time
backbone of open source collaboration throughout the world, Coders
use the IRC network to develop applications used by millions of people
every day and provide *end user support*. If you use any open source
software you may be an indirect beneficiary of the services Freenode
provides. I encourage those who are interested to try launching an
IRC client such as Pidgin [7] and see for yourself. You won't be
sorry you did.

While I have used Freenode for many years, this year I too became a
contributor for the first time. For a one time contribution
http://freenode.net/pdpc_donations.shtml of as little as $8 you can
join me in supporting Freenode and the many Open Source
projects they serve.

Thanks for your consideration,

Now OpenBSD 4.4 for i386 with repository is part of it and thanks for pointing that.

ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.4/i386/
ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.4/packages/i386/

and also including amd64 with base packages only.  Any specific request including documentation will also be appreciated,
since The "FOSS Webstore Server" focus more on documentation than software binaries and sources.

Shall we go with PCBSD 7.0.2 also?

Note that there are many custom variants (spins) of Fedora at
http://spins.fedoraproject.org. LTSP and Fedora Electronics Lab spins
are quite popular in India. You might want to include the ones that will
be useful for students.

Dear Baskar,

You have not still elaborated on my query regarding the license of
your "FOSS Webstore Server". I find no info in your flier regarding
the license under which your "Server" is distributed.

Trying to understand better.

*Accompany it with a written offer*

What does it refer to? Who gets the offer?

My understanding is that, recipient of your software (derivative of GPLed
software) gets the offer of Free Source Code. *not everyone.  *Correct me if
I am wrong.

Just to clarify, the source code is available publicly to everyone and
CentOS and many many rebuilders and users pick it from the public ftp
servers.

If you distribute under clause b, you are obligated to give source code
to anybody who asks. Only under clause a, can you give the source code
only to the people who you give binaries to which they are allowed to
redistribute to anybody else freely.

The "FOSS Webstore Server" is filled with plenty of foss softwares which is being
distributed under different licenses, Ex. GNU/Linux distributions under GPL compatible licenses.
and BSD distributions under BSD licenses and so on.

Since our server is loaded with various kind of foss softwares/sources for multiple platforms (which is mainly for educational purposes), we don't put our own licenses into that.  

To keep things simple to understand, instead of giving all the softwares/sources/documents in several multiple CD/DVDs, we are putting altogether in a hardware box and distributing them.

Dear Baskar,

In short "No License" at all. I remember reading somewhere that a FOSS
Business Model based on "No" license is a "bigger evil" than EULA.

Dear Mr.Baskar,

Could you clarify what this 3 years updates mean.Does it mean H/W
updates(are you going to upgrade the obsolete hardware for free) or
s/w updates.

I think it would be nice to stop this thread at this stage with my last reply to the above.

Since we are a solution provider, providing solutions/support to the educational institutions is the only business model we follow and not engaged in any other kind of development in this product and we are not interested to put our own licenses into that and confuse others.

Instead of giving tons of DVDs to these institutions freely (earlier I was doing this way), we put altogether and giving them in a box and providing support for that box in case of any hardware problems.

I am not sure whether this info. helps you and also request you not to reply to this list and if you need more info, pl. send a private mail to linuxbaskar@gmail.com

criticism and suggestions.

Thanks for your compliment. However, I feel my class was really boring
because I spoke about multi-seat, which you understood to be multitasking. I think I need to improve my teaching skills.

Anyway here are some links about multi-seat linux

Subject: [Ilugc] Creating FOSS distributions
Message-ID: <20090329103535.GA19663@imsc.res.in>

Hello,

Since there was a big thread on the FOSS Lab server, on BOSS before
that, and because of my experience with the Linpus Lite on Acer Aspire
One, I have formulated some guidelines. (There are similar pages
for the Fedora Spins and for Debian Pure Blends; see the links on
http://wiki.debian.org/DebianPureBlends).

If you are creating your own FOSS distributions (in order to
distribute to others!) here are some guidelines:

1. All distributions involve some amount of configuration and
customisation. Decide on a license for the distribution of this c&c
work (your work!), and ensure that it is compatible with everything
else which you are distributing. (Typically, GPL v2 or v3 should be
fine).

2. Every bit of software (and this includes documentation!) will have
bugs (which can include features desired by users but not yet
present). So be prepared to provide support (bug lists, mailing lists
etc.) for your distribution and (eventually) updates for the software
which you wrote.

3. A substantial part of your distribution will be based on the work
of other developers. Do not forget to give credit where it is due.
There are places where such attribution is not required legally but
you should act in a manner which is morally correct.

4. You may decide to include, as part of your distribution, large
amounts of documentation or other packaged software _as_ data. Ensure
that you have a license to distribute this material as is. 

5. You may decide to bundle your distribution along with certain
hardware for which the software is customised. It should be possible
for anyone to obtain the software without purchasing the hardware.

As a customiser and distributor of FOSS you are doing a service to
the community at large. This is greatly appreciated by everyone; no
contribution is too small! The above guidelines are meant to ensure
that you will not lead your users astray by accident.

Regards,

Kapil.

In the modern world, where most people use a single-user terminal,
people could be excused for confusing multi-tasking with multi-user
and even multi-seat installations! To understand the confusion
amongst common people, just talk to people who use only MS Windows
and you will see.

I agree - one guy is making money from foss - and spreading foss and everyone 
is criticising him. What is wrong with what he is doing?? OK, he may not 
understand GPL, but only 2 people in the world understand GPL - and they

Hi !

Not everyone. I fully understand and appreciate what he is doing. And this
is the only way FOSS survives and will survive.
Training , support and services are the only sources of revenue for FOSS
companies as the product itself is free.
FOSS economy is taught as a full time course in universities here and I dont
think we can convince this guy with few posts in a forum.

AFAIK, that magic number refers to an ACPI device. The line in dmesg

I had this problem, and I don't quite remember what I did. I think I
used aptitude and that worked. Give it a shot.

Hello,

Usually, this indicates a goof --- either on the part of the system
administrator (you!) or on the part of the person who created the .deb
package which you are using.

Explanation:
For each .deb package there are four scripts that can be found in
/var/lib/dpkg/info/ with the names
  pkgname.{preinst,postinst,prerm,postrm}
These scripts are run at the appropriate times during package
installation and removal.

Solutions:
1. There may be an update of mysql-server-5.0 (for your current
version of the O/S) which fixes this but. You can try to install
that. You might might get some warning about the prerm script but
it should go through.

2. You can look at the prerm script and see if you can fix
it. After fixing the script you can run 
   apt-get --purge remove mysql-server-5.0

3. If you can't fix the script, then put an "exit 0" close to the top
of the script. Warning: This will probably leave files on your system
which may cause problems with future installations of
mysql-server.

Regards,

Kapil.

That should be "bug" not "but".

I should have also said that after installing the fixed package (from
8.10 updates) you can remove it as well. It may seem
counter-intuitive that you need to update a package in order to
remove it, but when package-management scripts break that is the
"right way"(TM).

Great work!

The BSDs have long been proud of the fact that they ship an entire
operating system -- unlike Linux which is only a kernel with a GNU
user land.  BSD source code has great structure, and is also well
documented, and can serve students as an excellent example of
good programming practices.  Students can also  try compiling the
entire OS from scratch (make world) and thus make their own OS.

For these reasons, can you also include the source trees for some
of the BSDs?

Further including a source code browser/indexer like cvsweb/lxr
will make it trivial for beginners access the source code using a
familiar web browser.  This works even better if it's pre-configured
and works out of the box on the FOSS server.

Cross referenced source:
http://lxr.linux.no/
http://fxr.watson.org/

CVS web interface:
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/

Please let me know if you require any help in putting this
together.


> Shall we go with PCBSD 7.0.2 also?

PC BSD is not as main stream as the other BSDs.  I suggest
that you leave it out for now.

I remember facing a similar situation. In the prerm script, there was
a code which was trying to stop mysql server before removing it. I had
to comment out that part, after which the removal process went
smoothly. And all the files were removed too.

Dear Mr.Mathews,

Thanks for your very intelligent and civilized comment. Aren't you
ignoring the fact that my 4-lettered vocabulary might be more
extensive than yours !

Is your civility, as evident by your posting, representative of the

What is your system name, DNS name?

How can you ping a Domain name?

I think you have to redesign your naming system.

did you follow any guide?

if not, come here.

 Hi,

What qualifies a system to be in a domain?
How do we say that a system is in X domain?
Does its host name being x.y.com put it in y domain? or
Does the system having a entry in the DNS for a domain put it in that
domain?
 Can one system be in multiple domains?
If yes, how does it help / make a difference?

A FQDN is supposed to be a concatenation of hostname and domain.
 Say I have a system with IP 10.0.0.1.
hostname command shows
*server.myowndomain.net*

In My DNS I have an entry (my DNS is for domain serverpool.net)
*10.0.0.1          IN  A          dhcpserver*

now what is my FQDN?

Further my system is going to be referred to by other systems by what ever
name is in the DNS. Then what is the user of hostname mentioned locally.

Then there is NIS domain etc!!! All this confuses me. Someone please
clarify.

Since other machines will be referring to this machine using domain
name, setting up a local DNS server would be the best way in my
opinion.

Message-ID: <892536.70072.qm@web33105.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I was planning to get my firm registered with the STPI and noticed a very curious pattern. 
Most downloads from STPI are in MS formats (doc, xls...)- http://www.hyd.stpi.in/downloads/download.html

Also STPI is asking exclusively for power-point presentations.

I was wondering if there is any group in India which will take this up. Will FSF India be interested? If there is nobody to do this, I might have to start something myself - am open to ideas.
I think we need a signature/letter campaign with participation from profs/HODs of major Educational institutes and CEOs'/mgmt. of as many IT firms as we can. If these firms are already registered with STPI, it will be even better.

Thanks,
kc

Update on the progress

1. I was not able to get the control panel access and hence it is difficult
to backup everything and dumping
2. db size is around 3 GB because of the spam in mediawiki db table "Old"
3. truncated the entire Old table and took the backup of the db.

TODO
1. install new mediawiki with effective spam control and move the data to
it. (Please suggest if you know any plugins or useful extn for it we can
use)
2. upgrade civicrm drupal
3. install a new theme for drupal (please suggest possible themes)

If you guys like any other stuff, please let me know.

if you agree to move the wiki to trac, I can guarantee zero spam - I volunteer

Hi bala,

Thanks for your efforts.

Can we  integrate the ilugc mailing list and the drupal system?

Often, people confuse as they create a login in drupal and complain
that there is no mail coming.

planet is a nice requirement.

Let us see how our site evolves.

Thanks again.

I don't understand "control panel access". Can't you ssh to the
machine and/or run "mysqldump".

1. mediawiki-math for including small LaTeX snippets would be useful.

2. blogspam.net for spam control

3. a different approach to spam control is to require login or openid
   for changes.

'trac' is a very good suggestion. Trac combines wiki's with roadmaps
for code development. It uses standard version control systems.

As far as I know it allows one to have different VCS's like git,
mercurial and darcs in addition to the default svn.

sure, and I kept wondering how I have missed out lxr, fxr so far, and surely
this would help the beginners to access the source code using a web interface.
(Now, really got the answer for the students who ask, "how can I see the kernel source code Sir")

I have downloaded lxs-0.9.6 and let me try myself and when I am in need of help,
will get back to you.

What does that mean? CDDL is a free and open source license.

Dear common man,

If you think Linuxpert is not adhering to open source licences, please
state what action of theirs is transgressing the line. From your
statements, and the fact that you are using a pseudonym, makes me
(many of us?) think you are more bothered that he is making way too
much money than the value he is providing! The best way you can
counter this is to provide the same value at whatever price you think
is reasonable. In no time you will build a more successful business
than his - what better way to get even!!

Just mudslinging using a false name only means you are a mercenary who
wants the spoils of war without the attendant responsibilities. If you
think you have truth on your side, why hide behind a facade?

regds,
mano

kenneth,
few reasons why we should not use trac for chennailug.org
1. trac cannot be used because trac is meant for Project management and
bug/issue tracking. whereas mediawiki is meant for creating collaborative
content websites. earlier ilugc members used our mediawiki for various
purposes like CD's for Grab etc.
2. our aim in maintaining wiki is to enable all of us to access and
collaborate the events and happenings in ilugc. hence wiki is the suitable
one.
3. we are not going to develop anything using ilugc website. hence trac is
not needed.

regarding control panel sh$t....
majority of hosting business is going because of that sh$t which you cannot
disagree.

regarding your 3 yrs and no spam trac code,
how many people access it per day, per week, per month? spam occurs where
there are lots of people. chennailug.org is being affected because 2k+
people have registered with site.

shrinivasan,
yes i know the issue. mailing list and drupal integration should be done. i
will look for it.

kapil,
1. if i am asking for control panel access rather than ssh, you should think
why i am asking for that. there were issues for which ssh wont be the right
think. a table in ilugc db consumed 3 GB of data for which if i do select
query it wont display properly. my aim is to not learn ssh or mysql. for me
data is important and my aim is to fix the site ASAP. hence i was looking
for control panel access.
2. thanks for your suggestions on spam extn/plugins. i will try to use it.

Now, same thing started for installation. Removal was ok, but when it goes
for installation, at the time of starting mysqld... it cannot start itself
and the result is, mysql is not installing!!!

Hmm. I don't see why we can't just use the wiki part of Trac. That said, 
here's an even more extreme suggestion - how about we just use html 
pages? We all know how to code html & css, somebody can make/lift a 
basic template, and put it up as a project on google code, we can all 
check it out, and commit/send patches. Somebody can pull/aggregate these 
commits/patches and deploy them to chennailug.org. Perhaps we can have 
multiple project maintainers so this load too is distributed.

Pretty much everything, including events can be put up this way. We can 
setup a basic site structure, and make changes as we go if need be. If 
something needs to be discussed, commented upon, they can post the link 
here on the list and carry it forward. Something like Planet otoh, can 
be setup on a different vhost and we can use the appropriate software 
for that.

Is it your contention that the more people on the site the more spam? This is 
wrong. There are sites that are completely inactive and full of spam. Spammers 
do not look to size of the site - they are mainly bots anyway and all they do 
is exploit vulnerabilities.

look at this wiki - lakhs of people are using it, and no spam. It is no big 
deal, just link trac with akismet and you are done!

http://code.djangoproject.com/

and the wiki at http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/ is not used for managing 
projects, but is used in a very similar manner to what chennai lug needs. 
Since we allow anonymous editing, I have no idea how many people are accessing 
it, but it is relatively spam free.

PowerMail - a quick google search shows it is hosted out of Freshmeat.  
A link to "More information" on it's Freshmeat "home page" goes to 
<http://www.powerdns.com/powermail/>  which does not exist!  
Apparently, it was developed by the same co. as that of powerdns but 
probably discontinued.

domains: powermail.com is a calling card co., powermail.net goes to a 
domain listing site, powermail.biz translates to 67.215.66.132 reverse 
mapping points to opendns domain.

Have I missed anything?

Before installing any package, I would suggest do due diligence to find 
out how active the product is; even if the development is not active, 
does it have an active support forum/wiki/mailing list at least?

IMO, the package's support forum is the best place to get answers 
specific to that package based on the assumption that it's power users 
and developers hang out there.  If the software package does not have a 
support forum, be it FOSS or proprietary, who do you go to get answers 
to your problem?

Hi Roshan,

     As suggested i have compared the MD5 hashes of two images located in
the same directory and it worked perfectly. But applying the same to
database doesnt yield any results. Please explain the concept for database
image comparing. I have tried every possible thing in the past 1week but
could not sort it out.

Hello,

If you read my original mail, I was asking what "control panel access"
is. I have no idea what it is so I have no basis for comparison. If
you tell me that it (CPA) is easier for you than typing commands from
the shell then I have to believe you.

Here is what I learned about recovering data that is stored in a mysql
data base. (Note: I have only recently started using mysql since we
are testing drupal for some internal operations at IMSc.)

A command like:

 mysqldump --add-drop-tables --defaults-file=./mysql.cnf \
     {name_of_db} | gzip -9 > output.sql.gz

will allow you to dump the entire sql command set to create the data
base to output.sql. The "mysql.cnf" file should specify the name of
the database server and the user/password for accessing the database
name_of_db on the server. So as long as you have sufficient _local_
disk space and reasonable bandwidth between your local machine and the
db server you can get your data.

Using ssh and standard shell commands you can also login from machine
A to dump the database from server B and send the output to machine
C.

Regards,

Kapil.

P.S. I suppose one can do a lot of work in FOSS without learning mysql
but I really doubt that doing remote FOSS site management without
learning ssh is a good idea. People should really learn to use ssh
well --- almost immediately after learning '(ba)sh' well! :-) It only
takes 15-30 minutes to follow one of the many tutorials on ssh.

Hi to all,

     Is there a way to store the location of a file while we are going to
upload it. For eg: If i am trying to upload an image then including the
image the location (url) of the image should also be stored in the database.
Since i think the MD5 hash function compares images only at a particular
location, it does not compare images directly in database. So please Luggies
help me to solve this issue.

If a frontend is required only for MySQL, there's phpmyadmin[4] too,
if that's what he wants to use.

Common Man,

75k-11k=64k

if  (64k > (Office rent + asset installment EMI + electricity + loan
interest
               + transport + salaries + taxes + official bribes + politician
donation
               + employee advances + marketing + incentive + client kickback
               + office consumables + tea/coffee))
then profit //survive
else loss //perish

Very funny the way you questioned the price!
Congrats to Baskar... I could not get the courage to go FOSS for my
business.

Arun.

in the hosting food chain, control panel access is at the bottom. It is a gui 
for admining the site - it contains things like phpmyadmin, mail admin etc. 
File upload in these sites are done by FTP. There is no shell access. As a 
result, fine-tuning, trouble shooting and securing the site are very difficult. 
If the tool is available, you can do the job. If not - not. Since this is 
shared hosting, there is every possibility of some other clueless site owner 
b0rking the whole server. Also most of the people who run these servers are 
also totally dependent on gui admin ...

Hi,
We did  remote installation with Mr.Baskar's equipment one month back
in our college. 140 systems in 6 hours. :-)

And one suggestion please add  backtrack  if possible, Backtrack is a wonder
full distribution for security and penetration testing.. Will be help full
for security freak students :D..

Hi friends,

I am new to this list and the circle.

One of my friend is running a big forum ( first in his country) and running
it in Apache web server, the concurrent connections may be around 1000+ and
video download is allowed in that site.

What happens  is Apache hangs frequently and the site is not showing, this
is not picked up by downtime monitors since Apache is not down but it only
hangs.

What will be reason for this and how to solve this, any Apache Guru is there
in this link or circle?

You should probably provide some more information if you want use to
help you.

1. What does "hang" mean? For example, it could mean that the client
cannot open a connection to the server. It could mean that the server
does not see an incoming connection from the client. In both these
cases the problem is not with Apache but with the network.

2. If the apache server is seeing the connection and not responding
what is the load level of the machine running the server? Are there
are lot of scripts being run by apache. Perhaps you need to optimise
those scripts.

3. What is the version of various software that you are running? What
version of Apache? What version of Linux? This is only relevant if
the previous two queries have been resolved.

Regards,

Kapil.

Though Kapil has replied to most of the above points, I think it would
be useful to add my "gyan" or experience in administering the Ubuntu
India LoCo server for over 2 years now.

1. ?We use Mediawiki there. And I must say it just works. Disabling
Anonymous edit and adding a math captcha during registration reduced
hella lot of spam attacks. And ofcourse if we integrate some spam
filter also, it will be almost nill. Though I rarely remember seeing a
spam bot attack after I added the match captcha.

2. We dont use cPanel (if thats what you are talking as Control
Panel), and taking backups has been a breeze. Kapil already gave the
mysql command too and it really helped when we moved from one server
to another a year back. Every admin task is being done over ssh and we
feel we have complete control. I also use cPanel for my own personal
site and it isnt a easy thing as you have already mentioned about
getting control etc.

3. I dont think we (ilugc) need fancy stuff like calendar, polls, ?etc
etc. Just plain wiki with info. Since in wiki every registered user
will have access, its upto the community to keep it updated. 9ofcourse
with a few pages protected)

4. For monitoring the changes, I (I dont know the other three admins
what they use) use the RSS feed of the RecentChanges page and
constantly monitor them using Google reader. Works good to keep track
of who is changing what just like reading blog feeds.

I just want to say say "Dont break your head with lot of things and
features, use something that just works and is Free(dom)"

I think the list is being nice since you are a newcomer. Please do not reply
to digest mails. If at all you do, please have the courtesy to prune the
mail. That is assuming you want your mails to be replied to. Ideal is to
start a new mail with a proper subject line as indicated above.

There is no clue on what you are working.

mediawiki with captcha support doesnt work with php4. earlier some time
back, chennailug.org is under some hosting (dont know who actually owns and
pays for all these) which has only PHP4. i wasnt able to install captcha
with mediawiki. and the new version of mediawiki dropped PHP4 support as far
as i have tried during last revamp.

kapil, thanks for those mysql commands. even though i have tried all those
possible commands to back up huge spam data from mediawiki tables which is
around 3GB. and dumping that way as u suggested(which i have already tried)
stopped at some point because of hosting space quota.
all these days i was doing admin task via ssh and i love to do always that
way. reason for control panel(cPanel) is that, i want to make it organise
with proper sub domains and few other initiatives which i have planned to
do. another thing why i needed is that, to view non-spam data just to make
sure that all are fine.

calendar , polls are kept not for fancy but to be organized. i have seen
that members have used it extensively to publish details about any events
etc. people also have conducted polls. community means it should be
collaborative and engaging. you cant do all that with just plain wiki. CDs
for Grab is the most popular wiki i liked in our chennailug wiki because it
helped people to share their information.

I am not breaking my head with lots of things and features. i am trying to
get the existing stuff working.
Leave it to me guys, i will make the right one so that we all collaborate
easily.

Even I had a similar rush towards the same issue.
I use totally linux & java in my laptop and when downloading some applications etc most of the websites only have MS Doc format downloads and there is no PDF or atleast HTML or atleast plain text format.

Thanks & I assure my participation towards this.

Hi all,

I was planning to get my firm registered with the STPI and noticed a very curious pattern. 
Most downloads from STPI are in MS formats (doc, xls...)- http://www.hyd.stpi.in/downloads/download.html

Also STPI is asking exclusively for power-point presentations.

I was wondering if there is any group in India which will take this up. Will FSF India be interested? If there is nobody to do this, I might have to start something myself - am open to ideas.
I think we need a signature/letter campaign with participation from profs/HODs of major Educational institutes and CEOs'/mgmt. of as many IT firms as we can. If these firms are already registered with STPI, it will be even better.

Thanks,
