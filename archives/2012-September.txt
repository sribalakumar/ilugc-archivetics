Dear Sir,

last year when I was in mumbai, I got some posters (made by IIT, Mumbai)
for SFD, and posted in some places.  Got good response from Kendriya
Vidyalaya, Bhandup.  They perennially had problems (around 20-25) at one of
the computer labs, always affected by virus - (of course, all were win XP).
So the principal had personally asked the computer lab incharge to attend
the SFD, and the lab incharge spent the whole day at the SFD.  And I
believe now all the computers in the lab are now in dual-booting (Ubuntu &
Edubuntu), and the kids are finding  both very simple.

Is there anyway we can do similarly here.  please let me know.

thanks

with warm regards

Message-ID: <CANc+2y75DDxaRngCOfygPWMo0OWKEQwavmkVN7D6ng6haGZCsw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am in need of a good stock quote application for Linux. I am not
able to find any such application. Jstock is good but I am not
interested in applications based on Java as it is slow and takes up
huge RAM in my machine. Is there any similar or better application?

Thanks and Regards,

I would like to register a domain for my high school; something like

<hs_name>.ed.in

(akin to hs_name.edu but with an IN flavor)

I am aware of:

co.in
ac.in
res.in
mil.in

A visit to <http://www.registry.in>; I could not find the "official"
sanctioned sub domains under .IN TLD.

If ac.in is the only option; any suggestion of registrars that handle
ac.in would be welcome.

TIA,

AFAIK .edu is limited to colleges/universities in the US alone now. (And
registration used to free based on providing proof/documents, I'd helped
register one in the 90s when they were more lax and allowed everyone to
register)

Rules must be similar for ac.in

Schools in the US use k12.2-letter-state-code.us subdomain. I don't think
there's an equivalent for that in India.

only few were able to make it possible. mandrake, ubuntu - i feel good for
end users. but again, in terms of overall support from neighbourhood, linux
is far far away. but usage of oss like open office, mozilla firefox, gimp
etc and many more even in windows have increased.

Geeks may all use it in desktop, but adoption in various sectors is
already very high. It is difficult to see the extent of adoption as
market statistics is not related to adoption.

Google for example uses *buntu in its desktops.

Desktops like kde, gnome and others have been very usable since 2000+ or so.
Users have not been required to use CLI tools to run them.

Anyway the discussion was about machinations of a saboteur.

Hello Mr.Shrinivasan T,
Greetings from Team Technozion - NIT,Warangal!

National Institute of Technology (NIT), Warangal has its annual
International Students' Technical Symposium ? TECHNOZION scheduled to
be organized during the 28th ? 30th of September 2012.

One of the hallmarks of Technozion has always been the presence of
notable luminaries gracing the Institute portals, delivering inspiring
lectures, video conferencing and conducting interactive workshops for
the benefit of the student community.

We have taken up the theme "Gandhian engineering" (Frugal engineering)
for this version which embraces the idea of value for many. The term
being coined by Dr. Ragunath Mashelkar, we are trying to spread the
message among the young engineers to take up sustainable innovation
through this theme. Gandhi ji, our nation?s prime freedom fighter, is
well known for his simplicity, asceticism and frugal lifestyle. He
fought for freedom and right. We strongly believe technology is
freedom and right.

For the first time, Technozion is conducting a FOSS Meet during the
symposium. The FOSS Meet includes 4 Guest Talks,2 Hands-on workshops,A
video conference and a hack-a-thon. The FOSS Meet is scheduled for
28th to 30th of September 2012.
Event Schedule :
Day1 : On 28th September, Mr.Atul Chitnis, Founder of FOSS.IN will
give a keynote speech and inaugurate the FOSS Meet. It will be
followed by student presentations and Hack-a-thon
Day2:
On the 29th September, Pradeepto Bhattacharya - a KDE contributor is
giving a talk and Hands-on Workshop on KDE,GIT and Qt

Day3:
On the 30th September, Mr.Sashank Dara, Sr.Software Engineer, CISCO
Systems is going to present a tech talk on Security Science and
Engineering - FOSS Landscape
It will be followed by a Video Conference by Mr.Micheal de Raadt,
MOODLE.ORG presenting a talk on "Moodle as a Open Source Software and
FOSS Culture"
The final Session will be a Tech Talk,followed by Hands On Workshop by
Mr.Pramode CE on GNU/LINUX and Embedded Systems.


The FOSS Meet is the inception of Open Source Community at
NIT-Warangal. It will be a boost for the budding contributors to hear
an experienced Open Source Contributor.


We, on behalf of Technozion, cordially request you to please share
this event with your LUG and help us in promoting FOSS Culture.
Looking forward for a Long-Term Association with you.

Anticipating an affirmative response.

Thanks a lot!

To what stage the connection is progressing in FileZilla?
Is it connecting at all? or does it go up to the login stage and then stop?

Which cloud server? What steps did you take to enable FTP on the cloud
infrastructure? It usually isn't as straightforward to get FTP working
on cloud hosting.
Alternatively, if you just need access to transfer files, consider sftp.

Have you opened the port in the firewall? See

To: Wikimedia developers <wikitech-l at lists.wikimedia.org>


Greetings Wikitech Members,

The official release of the WLM Android App has been published on the
Google Play store!

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia.wlm

Now is the time to download the app from Google Play and tell us if
there are any issues before the contest starts on September 1st. All
uploads go to Commons, so send photos that you want the world to see.

In just a few days we've seen some amazing uploads including:

*
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Torre_de_H%C3%A9rcules_(taken_on_30Aug2012_15hrs26mins40secs).jpg
*
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Union_Square_(taken_on_27Aug2012_13hrs36mins9secs).jpg
*
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Southern_Pacific_Railroad_Locomotive_No-_1673_(taken_on_25Aug2012_10hrs6mins28secs).jpg

and you can see all of our mobile uploads below:

http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Uploaded_with_Android_WLM_App

For those of you in San Francsico, come by to the third floor to see a
visualization of all the mobile uploads on the big screen in admin
alley. If your not with us then you can load:
http://jonrobson.me.uk/wlm/to see the same. We took the majority of
these photos on Monday when the
team took a break from development and wandered San Francisco, Tucson, and
Chicago to field test our app. This was one of the best ways that we could
test our app. Since Monday we've seen amazing photos from Pittsburgh, South
Dakota, Mexico, and Spain from Wikipedians that we know and numerous that
we don't. We love when this happens!

Please write to us with any comments so that we can make the app even
better.

Thank you for your cooperation and support, and let's make 2012 the
best year ever!


Best regards,

The WMF Mobile Team

Look for a card that has the bttv chip set and it should work fine in
Linux.  About 18 months I got a a WinTV (PCI) card that works fine.
It might be hard to get in the retail channels.  Try ebay.in  and
search for Hauppauge or WinTV

Message-ID: <CAHhM8gBsEQOpOF1kxs-iBRnB=OZhi4ErLrLKsi-HhGuF6tixPA@mail.gmail.com>

The unthinkable happened.

One of my junior engineer did a

                           dd_rescue <some_iso_image>  /dev/sdc

(instead of /dev/sdd) in a moment of haste

/dev/sdc happens to be a 1TB HDD that held an ext4 partition and all
my archives (~650GB) were on it.

The ISO image is about 685MB.   Although the partition table and upto
685MB has been clobbered, I am hoping the files in the remainder are
recoverable.
(I realize some files may not be recoverable at all).

At present, I am running 'testdrive'  (from the author of photorec) to
see what it recognizes.

Any other suggestions welcome.

Yes, I meant testdisk and not testdrive.  Thanks for pointing it out.

I have used it to recover partition tables with success but in those
cases the FS on the partitions had been untouched

In this case, it does not look good.  It was able to recognize that
there was an ext4 partition and restored the partition /dev/sdc1 with
an ext3 signature.

However, it would not mount "Unknown fstype, bad Superblock"

Tried to fix the FS
fsck.ext4 /dev/sdc1 showed a lot of errors.   I did not have much
option but to answer 'y' to all the questions.   There were 33 files
in lost+found and pretty much useless.

BTW, please do not top post.

Thanks,

Am sorry, am mailing from mobile, those texts gets included
automatically.. Recovering files is kinda possible, but that will take
almost a week or two, specially this huge amount me data.. I took
almost a week to recover 500gb. And yea, can you try make ext4 in that
partition without formatting it, fsck or e2fsck (i think -p was the
one to give yes to all queries), it should work unless the hard disk
is failing!

Message-ID: <20120904015734.GC7029@narnia.kingsly.net>

Hi

Does anyone have a Lite-on bluetooth device working?(Mine is on an Asus X53U)

in lsusb:

Bus 004 Device 002: ID 04ca:3002 Lite-On Technology Corp. 

# hciconfig 
hci0:   Type: BR/EDR  Bus: USB
        BD Address: 00:00:00:00:00:00  ACL MTU: 0:0  SCO MTU: 0:0
        DOWN 
        RX bytes:0 acl:0 sco:0 events:0 errors:0
        TX bytes:9 acl:0 sco:0 commands:3 errors:0

but when I try to bring it up

# hciconfig hci0 up
Can't init device hci0: Connection timed out (110)

Googling seems to suggest that the device is somehow powered off and booting
into Windows and then warm booting into Linux makes it work. (but that's not
an option here.)

Anyone know a way to make it work?

Council(IGC) of FSFTN will be formed.

The vision behind the IGC is a collective of students and free
software enthusiasts from across the State who will initiate the
building of the most precious commodity for any free software movement
- a strong and vibrant community. This is especially relevant in the
context of the massive increase in the number of people having access
to technology in the State through the free laptop scheme.

The IGC will have representatives from all GLUGs/FOSS clubs in
colleges from across the State and will work closely with Free
Software activists outside the academia.

To be part of the IGC you can register your college/group through the
following registration form.
http://fsftn.org/content/igc-registration-form

Registered colleges/organizations would be contacted by volunteers
within 24 hours and informed about the procedure to take part in
formation of IGC, which is schedule to be held on 22nd September 2012,
at Vivekananda Auditorium, College of Engineering Guindy(CEG), Anna
University Main Campus, Chennai.

More details on Cheif Guests and entire event plan would be announced
shortly. For any clarifications please contact ask at fsftn.org

We can think of this later,as we cannot tell him that to solve this problem

This is the best http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/, I came
across. But there might be others. Keep looking. Most other documents
available online are brief. Also there is this book
http://www.amazon.com/Pulling-Strings-Puppet-Configuration-Management/dp/1590599780.

And http://forge.puppetlabs.com/ is an excellent place to look for
reusable snippets. Personally I like this resource
https://github.com/jwiegley/puppet-config.

There will be initial blocks but once you overcome that puppet is an
excellent tool.

Thanks and Regards

Mohan,

You are right, they has not mentioned anything about the power input.

It probably can. Many boards with this SoC have the same power management
IC and it looks like they can be powered
by USB otg, or power adapter.

If I understand correctly, you loose data when you have simultaneous
users. If that is so, then, please check if you have any static
classes / singleton objects / Enum Singletoms? It might not be a MySQL
problem, but a Java coding issue.

Hi Noorul,

Thanks  I am not sure if you are probably using this, if you are using this
and if you are attending ILUG-C meeting is it possible for you to give a
small demo or take a small session  on the same?

I am going through the links which you gave me.

Hi everyone,

I've just read the Samsung Smart TV Guide and Dev Tools specs:
http://samsungdforum.com/
So it's Linux and HTML5, which sounds rather familiar: is this going to be
merged with Tizen ?

Kind regards,

Nice initiative . Keep it as "open" as possible and give out multiple
formats . The most important thing would be having a great designer as
many here write blogs/articles I am guessing content wouldnt be an
issue but presentation would be .

Have you tried the docs on puppet?   Anything lacking there that you
are looking for video tutorials?

My method of self training  -- try it on a couple of VMs, post errors
in the respective mailing lists and get the solutions from the guru's
keyboard :)

I have neither used puppet nor chef, comments are based upon sessions I attended
@ gnuNify 2012 (SICSR, Pune) earlier this year.

The talks on puppet and chef were given by senior sys admins, so it
was not fluff material.   Both presenters handled the Q&A part very
well answering technical questions given the time constraints of
clearing the room for the next event :(

My *personal impression* (do intend to start emacs/vi type discussion
here):  chef appeared to have an edge over puppet.  Of course, in the
FOSS world this keeps changing with the new releases of the respective
suites.  A Google search for 'puppet chef sysadmin' brings up quite a
few postings on both.

I would suggest that (from a career point of view)  you look @ both
puppet and chef as arsenal in your resume.  Both are powerful tools
for automating sys admin activities in a data center like scenario.

Best,
-- Arun Khan

I have used both, Puppet and Opscode Chef, for over two years now to
automate complex clustered setups. I started with Puppet, and then moved to
Chef, and never looked back. Puppet uses declarative language, which is
easier to learn for beginners, however in comparison to Chef has multitude
of useful features which make it more attractive. It has many advantages
over Puppet, offers more features such as attributes overriding,
environments, data bags, solr search, knife client, support for
bootstrapping on cloud as well as bare metal. From my experience chef  is
more stable and has predictable behavior  which helps in debugging.   So my
advise to you is, if you are starting with Configuration Management System,
start with Opscode Chef.  Its a little more complex than Puppet is to
learn, but take my words, you wont regret going that way.


Here is one  the example works I could achieve with Chef. This is using
bash script with Chef cookbooks. I have setup a mechanism to bootstrap a
Big Data cluster on ec2  with multitude of inter-dependent services such
as  Apache Zookeeper, Hadoop, Hbase, Kafka, Apache Pig, Hive, Apache Solr
Cloud  integrated and configured to talk to each other.

The end product is a script which takes arguments in the form of number of
instances of each type to be launched. Script uses ec2 api calls and Chef's
bootstrap mechanism and a few api calls to,

1. Launch ec2 Instances
2. Bootstrap Chef (Install and configure chef client)
3. Configure services as per roles (e.g. zookeeper, hadoop namende, hbase
master, hadoop slave, solr etc. )
4. Configure each service to find other services and manage dependencies.
E.g. Hadoop needs to know where to find zookeeper, and has its IP address
configured in its configurations.
5. Override config parameters to customize setup.

All you need to do is run the bash script with a few arguments, and after a
few minutes, you have your big data cluster setup and configured,
magically...

Hi All,

I am using Redhat 5.4 server, in there am using some java application.
My question is, is there any possible to change the process starting time.

This is my output:

# ps -eaf | grep java

root     12535     1  0 *Sep04 ? *       00:09:14 java -jar xxxxxx.jar

root     19406     1  1 13:29 pts/9    00:00:55 java -jar xxxx.jar

**Is possible to change the 1st process time from *Sep04* to *Aug10*


Thanks in advance.

Please explain your reason for wanting to do so!

IMO, it goes against the principle of systems operation and it's
integrity whatever that jar file is doing.

Hi Folks,

A long ago I was using *DLink DWA 510 Wireless G Network Adapter* in my

10.04 LTS in it. Now ubuntu can't recognize my network adapter. Previously
it was working fine after installing third party driver. But now i can't
find driver for that adapter in ubuntu's *Hardware Drivers*. Even i have
googled, since i can't find driver for ubuntu. pls help me to use the
network adapter in my ubuntu machine.

Message-ID: <CAND2797+-8Ls7bG5qFW7Yk62-GQZwaQs7petF2peL-5MPcE41A@mail.gmail.com>

Fedora packages for scribus with indic support are released.

http://lists.scribus.net/pipermail/scribus/2012-August/047288.html

Can some fedora users install the rpm packs and review the indic support?

Thanks for you candor.

I will reiterate my original posture

<quote>

IMO, it goes against the principle of systems operation and it's
integrity whatever that jar file is doing.

Technically I don't think it can be done; imagine the havoc the
"rogue" sysadmins could unleash.

This makes it difficult to answer on an open mailing list. You need to
look for paid support who will be ready to accept NDAs.

When in doubt *always* read the "Release Notes" issued by the software
author/vendor; in this case it is Oracle/Java.  Typically, it will
contain a list of all the bug fixes; you should *not* accept the word
of a third party for such issues.

Also, do *not* top post and *trim* your quotation.

Simple answer: It cannot be done.

Its like changing your date of birth! The Linux kernel is designed not to 
allow such things.

It kind of implies that process time can be changed, perhaps with some
"backdoor" proprietary tool (i.e. NDA).

==================

Dear Sir/Madam,

Indian Linux Users Group, Chennai(ILUGC), and Free Software Foundation
Tamil Nadu(FSFTN), invite the faculty members and students of your college
to the Software Freedom Day celebration.

Software Freedom Day (SFD) is an annual worldwide celebration of Free
Software. SFD is a public education effort with the aim of increasing
awareness of Free Software and its virtues, and encouraging its use and
giving back to the community by taking it to the streets and into our
everyday lives. GNU/Linux is a Free operating system. It is very stable and
Virus Free. We also get tons of software which are equivalent to and better
than proprietary software which are also totally free of cost.

The purpose of Software Freedom Day is to raise awareness among the
students, professionals, policy makers, and general public.

This year, we are planning a week-long celebration in different parts of
the State which kicks off in Chennai on Saturday, Sept 15th from 9:30am to
5pm at DG Vaishnav College, Arumbakkam, Chennai. Following various events
in parts of the State, the concluding programme will be on September 22nd
at College of Engineering, Guindy ? Anna University.

This event is open to the public and entry is free. Anyone interested to
know about Free Software can attend this event. In this event, volunteers
from ILUGC and FSFTN and students from various colleges, will demonstrate
various Free Software, give tutorials (in Tamil and English) to cover the
common tools like Office, Image Editing Tools,Audio/Video Editing Tools,
Games, Programming Languages like Python, PHP etc. Content Management
Systems like Drupal and Joomla, Virtualization Tools and a session to show
?How to install Linux??. For full stalls list, please visit
http://wiki.ilugc.in/index.php?title=Sfd2012

Free Software refers to software which allows freedom of use, distribute
and freedom to change and distribute the modified versions of software
without any infringement of copyrights. Most of the Free Software also
happens to be free of cost, and the licensing model offers developing
countries like India an alternative to expensive proprietary licensing
models which limit the ability of the customers/users to change, upgrade
and modify the programmes.

There is a range of free software available for different purposes, from
Mozilla Firefox for browsing the Internet, VLC for media, to the GNU/Linux
Operating System, and the Open Office productivity application, Games,
Development Tools, Programming Languages, Multimedia and Education tools at
no cost.

Indian Linux User Group, Chennai and Free Software Foundation Tamil Nadu (a
part of Free Software Movement of India) are organisations which have been
working towards spreading awareness of Free Software throughout the State
through workshops, seminars and such projects.

In addition to this, with Kaniyam we have announced an Technical Essay
writing competition in Tamil to bring out highly specific, research
oriented quality creations in Tamil related to Free Software. Further
details of this can be read from:
http://www.kaniyam.com/essay-competitionWe request that you take this
to your staff members, students & others
interested and ask them to participate in this competition.

Discover Free Software and what it can do for you in SFD, on Sat Sept 15!

Date : September 15, 2012

Place : DG Vaishnav College, Arumbakkam, Chennai - 106

Time : 9:30am to 5pm

Contact: Shrinivasan(9841795468), Arun(9488000707)

Thanking you,

Executive Committee,
Free Software Foundation Tamil Nadu

There's no bluetooth specific key. All the other keys work. 

The one with the wireless icon is the only one that doesn't do anything.

On my Dell m/c, the wireless icon key toggles on/off both BT and Wifi

One small correction - Arumbakkam is spelt as Arambakkam (which is a
different place [1]). Is it possible to correct it and upload?

To: "Indian FOSS Community Network list" <network at lists.fosscom.in>

Hi,

I've started an open source project called Tally Wrapper at
https://github.com/venkatmangudi/tally-wrapper The project is to create a
web application that will provide a store and transmit method to send
transactions to Tally. It would be great if you could join the project and
contribute in any way you can.

While it might be a great idea to rid the Indian users of Tally by
educating and helping them to use applications such as front accounting and
SQL Ledger, the users are dependent on the accountants and auditors who
might not want to work on apps other than Tally. If we cannot make them
replace Tally completely, this application will at least give the users a
way of using other applications and letting the accounting world use Tally.

Hi,

     It would be really nice if we can switch from Tally altogether.
Does anyone know a tool that can transfer data from Tally to GNUCash?

     IMO, GNUCash has more features than Tally has. It accomodates
well with the Indian Double Book Accounting system. And it has a price
that is hard to beat.

openSUSE 12.2 is ready for you.

<quote>
Dear users, developers, and Geekos around the world - openSUSE 12.2 is
ready for you! Two months of extra stabilization work have resulted
into a stellar release, chock-full of goodies, yet stable as you all
like it.

The latest release of the world's most powerful and flexible Linux
Distribution brings you speed-ups across the board with a faster
storage layer in Linux 3.4 and accelerated functions in glibc and Qt,
giving a more fluid and responsive desktop. The infrastructure below
openSUSE has evolved, bringing in newly matured technologies like
GRUB2 and Plymouth and the first steps in the direction of a revised
and simplified UNIX file system hierarchy. Users will also notice the
added polish to existing features bringing an improved user experience
all over. The novel Btrfs file system comes with improved error
handling and recovery tools, GNOME 3.4, developing rapidly, brings
smooth scrolling to all applications and features a reworked System
Settings and Contacts manager while XFCE has an enhanced application
finder.

"We're proud of this release, maintaining the usual high openSUSE
quality standards." said Andrew Wafaa from the openSUSE Board. "The
delay in the schedule caused by our growth in the last two years means
we have to work on scaling our processes. Now this release is out and
with the upcoming openSUSE conference in October in Prague, the
community has time and opportunity to work on that."

Not sure what you mean by "dialer". I'm assuming you want to be able to use
your 3G USB modem to connect to your mobile provider's data plan. This,
Ubuntu (and I'm assuming mint too) will do automagically if you're using
the desktop release. The network manager applet can't do all of what you've
asked for. But the good news is there is a separate software to let you do
all of what you want: Gammu. http://www.mwiacek.com/www/?q=gammu

You can do sms send through gammu. There is a separate smsd to receive sms.

 This depends on your service provider. For instance, Airtel may require us
to interact through certain service commands, like "*123#10" to know
balance. Some others may use an SMS interface. That said, the service
commands part is interesting and I haven't tried executing such service
commands using gammu. I will benefit if other members on the list can
clarify/explain.

my modem is unlocked Huawei 303s and it is un locked and it starting auto

I too have a Huawei 303s. But the "auto run program" I've not experienced.
But this should be largely irrelevant since Network manager will let you
use the modem without a trouble. Use the network manager applet ("wireless
indicator" applet on the panel) to view and select your ISP.

Subject: [Ilugc] Some perl tricks
Message-ID: <CALDskywjSnFeapt6B9qcM2E7T55vaBi-SJKmztXnXQiQ+cRGrA@mail.gmail.com>

We will look at some perl tricks.

# perl -MCPAN -e 'install Foo::Bar;'

will install the module you want.

In certain OSes perl modules are distributed as packages. In such
cases you can install using
 the package management tool.

Perl comes built with several modules like Tie::File, Sys::Syslog and
so on that need not be installed
 separately.

Perl allows a lot of tricks to be performed on files, I/O, sockets and pipes.

You can read and write to a UNIX command whose output or input is
obtained from a pipe using
 the same old open() call used in perl to read or write to files.

For example,

$ cat i.pl
open F, "|netstat -rn";

while (<F>) {
        print;
}

close F;

will read the output of netstat -rn.

You could also read from an input like this:

$ cat i.pl
open F, "tr a-z A-Z|";

while (<F>) {
        print;
}

close F;

You have to type text followed by "Ctrl-D" like this.

girish is here
GIRISH IS HERE

You can read password from the terminal like this:

$ cat i.pl

 use Term::ReadPassword;
         while (1) {
           my $password = read_password('password: ');
           redo unless defined $password;
           if ($password eq 'flubber') {
             print "Access granted.\n";
             last;
           } else {
             print "Access denied.\n";
             redo;
           }
         }

You can learn a lot of nice things you can do on UNIX just by learning
Perl and reading
 the man pages of various CPAN modules.

Which have lot of code samples for you to try.

GNUCash cannot be used in the business because, there is no local tech
support. whereas, Tally is supported by a company which provides it.

If GNUCash can be supported by a company, it can be usable. Let me know who
supports GNUCash in terms of tech support, training etc

There are many. LedgerSMB, OpenERP, OrangeHRM and so on and so forth.

I read somewhere (and often concur based on my own observations)  that
most ERP project ~80% are abandoned after a initial phase as Down the
line, people on the floor have practical issues with it. Often the
implementer is, justifiably, chasing imaginary milestones and raised
invoices with payment looking like a chimera.

There are plenty of articles describing how it should be approached
and few of articles on the web describing failures. No organisation
will easily, boldly acknowledge its shelved projects.

Now I support Tally as it is the only "True" software product of
India. Though I do not like the fact that they went bak on thier word
on linux version which they announced circa 2006.

The beancounters as it is are secretive and don't care for bottomline.
Often an IT equipment purchase proposal gets a not immediately when it
comes from Accounts or Sales department: they know how to sell their
case to management. And more importantly, beancounters have the
financial scrotum of their "management" handy. Add to that, even when
a company locks out, it is the accountants and lawyers who are there
to collect their part of the leftover flesh.

So they don't care about the amount of money being spent.

It is then jarring to the ears of in accountant if you tell them that
their application is open-source. It is like the turn-off a free
software follower feels when patented software bit is mentioned.

It is then the issue of rephrasing/reframing the question: How can
open source enthusiast get the accountant to adopt open source
solution by explaining to them that their Data is perfectly safe when
encrypted and web/network traffic can be encrypted too.

Any automated sales-talk generator software out there?

Above IMHO.

Only if you have a licensed version and  it is *not* free.   This is
the model for most consumer oriented proprietary software - support is
per incident or time and material.

This is a blanket statement and applicable to many a package,
proprietary or FOSS.

Have you tried the GNUCash documentation/FAQ and/or their forums/mailing lists?

Hi,

     I do agree that there are many Open Source alternatives to Tally
and GNUCash. I would recommend GNU Cash for SMEs and larger
enterprises should use the server based ones like OpenERP.

     Most of the failiures with ERP implementation is because of
practical problems, which often result due to the laziness of the
people who are using it. Yes it can do wonders. People in accounting
department of most places, don't like changing their way of working.
And since they handle cash, no body wants any delays from / because of
them.

     The problem with Tally, IMO is that it is not open source. If it
was, then not having a GNU/Linux version wouldn't be much of a problem
as anyone can easily port it to GNU/Linux.

    Tally because of its closed source nature cannot be as secure as
GNUCash or OpenERP or the other OSS alternatives. This is a situation
where the concern is not about the money being spent. But it is more
about security and ease of use.

     Again the data being encrypted doesn't depend on the software,
but on the tunneling. SSH can come to the rescue here.

    Ultimately, we need companies that give guarenteed implementation,
maintance and 24/7 support for Open Source ERPs like OpenERP and GNU
Cash.

Hi,

In my office we are using checkpoint as firewall and for VPN connectivity.

They provide me a exe file to install vpn client , but I am using ubuntu in
my residence.

Is that possible to install checkpoint client in linux.

I tried to install snx which is successful in installation & when I tried
to load the application as $sudo snx -s XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX -u username it
gives an error

" snx: error while loading shared libraries: libpam.so.0: wrong ELF class:
ELFCLASS64".

My ubuntu is 12.04 64bit version.

To overcome the above error When i try to enter the command $ldd
/usr/bin/snx, the library file libpam.so.0 was not loaded "libpam.so.0 =>
not found"

But the library file is available in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpam.so.0. I
don't know how to link this with the snx application.

Has anybody in our ilugc was successful in the checkpoint VPN for ubuntu
64bit version.

Hi,

     Is the check point client actually needed for the VPN
configuration? I think using openVPN client would be better. It works
well with untangle firewall.

It is likely that the program is 32 bit and is
dependent on a 32 bit version of PAM library.

Try installing the 64 bit version of the program
or install 32 bit version of PAM library (though
I doubt that the latter solution is straight forward).

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

Hi Shrini,

If possible could you please make a small screencasting of how to join, as
there are lot of people including I who wish to know how to join the IRC.
It is much easier to watch and learn than to read the web and learn.

Hi all,
One of my friends has installed Linux Mint in his system. After a recent

of weeks back), he could not get into his system.

Here is a brief explanation of his observations (which has recurred at all

When switching on the System, the computer boots till he sees the login
screen. In the login screen too, he could enter his login credentials and
get in. (He could hear the login sound too..)
But after that instance, everything comes to a standstill.
All that he could see is a BLACK SCREEN.

A few minutes later, a window pops up displaying the error message: "Failed
to Load Session- GNOME"

After trying many times, he has formatted his PC and installed Linux Mint
again. But, immediately after the update, the same phenomena continues to
occur.

Is there anyway out?
I request the luggies to kindly look into the issue and provide us a
solution!

Thank you in advance!

Hi All,

  I have a Windows XP PC used for sharing files,documents etc over my
network. Since the number of network users increased the sharing wont
possible. I mean more than 10 sessions not possible ( XP supports maximum
10 sessions). So I am planning to move to a linux based file server or a
linux based NAS (FreeNAS). My requirements are


   - A common location to share data / add data / delete data.


   - AD (Active directory) based authentication.All windows clients can
   access the share.


   - Backup option

   So I would like to go head with FreeNAS. Also I would like to hear your
suggestion.

Dear luggies

Yesterday Shrini and myself met the HOD of CS of Vaishnav College.

He is very dynamic and want the event to have big impact among students. He has done excellent arrangements. We are hopeful of getting good media (tv and print) coverage this time.

We are hoping an attendance of not less than 2000. 

I request all members to come and participate in the event. We need more stalls. Stalls by members with real life working experience will go a long way in driving the software freedom message well.

We are getting two halls for lectures also. We need speakers to talk on FOSS. Please volunteer by mailing to Shrini or list.

I have no idea about FreeNAS but I am familiar with a setup which uses
Samba coupled to MS AD and NetApp volumes. I assume that FreeNAS is a
free alternative to NetApp.

Hi Karthik,

Seeing that they have given you an EXE file, I believe it is a IPSEC VPN 
client(Correct me if i am wrong).

Ubuntu has a built-in VPN client and i think use it as an alternative to 
the check point provided client.

All you need is the gateway address and the user name/password.

I think the following link will be helpful:

http://askubuntu.com/questions/145330/how-to-get-a-vpn-for-ubuntu

Please let me know if it was helpful.

Thank You,

Raghavendran

FreeNAS is based on FreeBSD.   openfiler is a Linux based alternative.
 Both appliances have a Web UI for managing the disk volumes.  open-e
is a commercial product but there is a free "as in beer" version as
well.

IMO, you can't go wrong with any of them.

Consider installing the appliance on a DoM (Disk on Module); this will
allow you to keep all your hard drives for storage capacity.

While getting a board with DOM may be an issue, I think using a low
capacity USB stick on a USB boot supported system would be a good
alternative.

<http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Job_openings> has a reasonable
number of frequently updated developer opportunities.

As an aside, it is probably a good idea to take time to spell out the
names correctly (I notice that you have mangled Jimmy Wales and Bill
Gates).

Pluggable IDE/SATA DOMs are available from vendors who specialize in
server grade systems.   I am sure Chennai has a vibrant server vendor
channel.

IMO, USB sticks are OK for end user consumer type solutions [1], they
are slow and failure rate is high.   For a file server I would not
recommend USB stick.

[1] I use USB sticks for my Atom based desktop clients.

Make sure your hardware is in it's HCL.  Autumn of 2009, I wanted to a
migrate a file server to FreeNAS and found that it did not have good

The recommended way to deploy rails application is to use phusion
passenger (aka mod_rails)[1].

The official mod_rails documentation[2] for setting it up might be a
good place to start looking to.

[1] - http://rubyonrails.org/deploy
[2] - http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html

If you face any difficulty in setting this up, get back with the details
of what you did and the issues faced.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Dear Karthik,

Please dont say like this.
They are donating the venue for free for the event.

WiFi is not an essential stuff such event.
You can have a stall on Rails even without WiFi.

If you dont have time for reading mails,
please keep silent.

Dont spend words without knowing what is going there in the emails.

Let us stop the discussion here.

Thanks.

no one asks you to read all the mails. But atleast know what is going on or
what is said before replying to a mail.
Just dont waste others time, who are really reading the mails.

   There is already a stall on Ruby on Rails. So try to put a stall on
something else. But be sure to checkout the list of stalls before deciding
on it. And here is the list of stalls

No, the fact is we need Internet for Rails 3+ project, every time you 
want to show a demo, you run a command that creates a project Rails 
fetches stuff from internet. If laying wires is stuff, they can hook the 
net to wi-fi router.

OK, agreed that u all read all emails word by word :-) So there are some 
politicians here.

The fact is this, u simply can't run a petrol car without petrol.

Y? shouldn't we have duplicate stalls or something? OK, then a stall on 
Ruby, any way I must think 10 times b4 I can be sure. Plus Ruby does not 
need internet connection (to work). But are u sure that every 1 who has 
put their names in there will turn up?

You can also use something like a DNS343 (dlink). Storage and AD work out
of box. You can set up linux to run on it for more control.

   Okay why do you think of having duplicate stalls? Its nice to have a
stall on Ruby.
   And you no need to worry about whether the people who have registered
will come or not.  You can proceed with what you are interested to do for
the community and if you want internet connection try to make arrangements
for your own. That would be great.

https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/09/its-opus-it-rocks-and-now-its-an-audio-codec-standard/


\quote

In a great victory for open standards, the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) has just standardized Opus as RFC 6716.

Opus is the first state of the art, free audio codec to be
standardized. We think this will help us achieve wider adoption than
prior royalty-free codecs like Speex and Vorbis. This spells the
beginning of the end for proprietary formats, and we are now working
on doing the same thing for video.


...........


Unlike previous audio codecs, which have typically focused on a narrow
set of applications (either voice or music, in a narrow range of
bitrates, for either real-time or storage applications), Opus is
highly flexible. It can adaptively switch among:

    Bitrates from 6 kb/s to 512 kb/s
    Voice and music
    Mono and stereo
    Narrowband (8 kHz) to Fullband (48 kHz)
    Frame sizes from 2.5 ms to 60 ms

Most importantly, it can adapt seamlessly within these operating
points. Doing all of this with proprietary codecs would require at
least six different codecs. Opus replaces all of them, with better
quality.

Today OP's need is CIFS file sharing, in future it may include other
file sharing formats.

FreeNAS is an appliance based on FreeBSD (www.freenas.org).   It does
*samba* plus a whole lot more in an image size that is smaller than an
Ubuntu server install.  Plus it comes with a Web UI management.

You need a network alright. I thought intranet was not just for demo purpose.

If your application can't run on intranet, I wonder what it does and
if it really is worth anything.

This is a misconception....
A petrol engine implies a Spark Ignition Engine...

*We can smoothly run a petrol car with LPG, CNG or biofuels with no or
hardly few modifications!!*
Hence, We CAN run a petrol car without petrol!

Software Freedom Day (SFD) is an annual worldwide celebration of Free
Software. SFD is a public education effort with the aim of increasing
awareness of Free Software and its virtues, and encouraging its use
and giving back to the community. GNU/Linux is a Free operating
system. We also get tons of software which are equivalent to and
better than proprietary software.

This year, the Free Software Movement of India (FSMI) is celebrating
this occasion as Internet Freedom Fortnight where the various policies
and developments that have posed a threat to the freedom of expression
online ? from the problematic clauses in the Information Technology
Rules, 2011 to the acts of outright censorship and intolerance of
opinions. Throughout the celebrations, attempts will be made to raise
awareness among students, professionals, policy makers, and general
public of these issues.

This year, FSFTN is organising a fortnight-long series of programmes.
On September 15, FSFTN and ILUGC will organise Software Freedom Day in
DG Vaishnav College, Arumbakkam, Chennai.

This event is open to the public and entry is free.. In this event,
volunteers from ILUGC and FSFTN and students from various colleges,
will demonstrate various Free Software, give tutorials (in Tamil and
English) to cover the common tools like Office, Image Editing
Tools,Audio/Video Editing Tools, Games, Programming Languages like
Python, PHP etc. Content Management Systems like Drupal and Joomla,
Virtualization Tools and a session to show ?How to install Linux??.
Similarly on the September 16, FSFTN in association with PUDUVAILUG,
will be organizing Software Freedom Day in Puducherry.

On September 22, the programmes will culminate in Vivekananda
Auditorium, College of Engineering, Guindy where alongside stalls on
technology, talks and lectures on various technical issues will also
be held and FSFTN's Interim General Council will be inaugurated.

For the formation of Interim General Council, the registration is open
and if you want your college to be part of it, register at

You can do some of the expenditure yourself like printing labels or paying for coffee/lunch etc.

The place to get printed is "printfaast", 54, velacherry main road (near to
police station), velacherry, chennai - 42.
Mr. Ramanan  - 22552767 / 43037393.
email : printfaast at gmail.com

roughly costs 2" x 2" - will be around Rs. 1/- - if printed around 1,000
stickers.

with warm regards
s.sivakumar

Not necessarily true. You can always setup an offline Rails project,
and use it for demo purposes. Rails does come with a built-in web
server. Or you can also set it up with a web server on localhost.

Many do have Internet connectivity on their mobile phones, and if
required, it can be shared to the laptop for Internet usage.

It all comes down to attitude.

changing the topic, as its deviating from original intention.

We in-fact applied & got it rejected. ;-)

Went for hearings with the appropriate department;s Commissioner & co.

cited him all appropriate reasons, similar foundations overseas, grant of 80G for FSF India.

at times they were wondering, software being such a wealthy profitable industry, why do these people raise funds like sectors

I felt, at last he realised the importance, but didn't want to take risk under him.

the application was rejected. these things rest solely on the discretion of the deciding authority. I am sure he personally understood the cause.

need to start back the whole process again.

Normally people use mailman and postfix

Qmail is a pain though it may be enticing at first.

Your choice.

----------------------------
Thank you for the opportunity to present Open Source Telephony on this SFD.

It was the first time we have setup such a stall. It was personally a good and enriching experience to interact with the community at Chennai and students / visitors who visited the stalls.

I look forward to participating more actively in the open source community activities of Chennai in the near future. 

We have a list of the visitors who requested more information and expressed interest in learning more about software freedom in general and FOSS projects specifically. We will be contacting them with further information.

The primary content of our presentation was derived from www.voip-info.org , a great wiki for all things telephony. Our demonstration was on Asterisk (www.asterisk.org) and the Vicidial Call Center Suite (www.vicidial.org). 

We showed 
a hardware telephone gateway, Audiocodes 24 port analog gw (not connected really) 
an end-point Grandstream IP phone (not connected)
a software phone, Twinkle, running on the Ubuntu desktop and 
IAX2client, a mobile (IP phone) client app on android,
?
along with live demonstrations of calls over Asterisk to an ASR(automatic speech recognition) and DTMF enabled IVR. 

The presentations were done on Ubuntu Server running gnome and OO. The demo was with Twinkle a SIP phone registered to a remote asterisk server on a public IP, conectivity over Tata Photon. The photon was working ok in the first half, but often dropped to zero signal in the afternoon session or had too high latency / jitters for VoIP demo, so there were no live demos in the second half. Since we were forewarned about power outages and we were not using a laptop, we had a one hour UPS backup, which served us well.

I would like to put together an introduction to FOSS and an invitation to join ILUGC for the above mentioned list of visitors. Of course, we will add open source telephony links. Please let me have any information that you have ready-made.

Thanks again,

Regards,

Before you venture into your own mailing list + the underlying
infrastructure, I would suggest answer the following to yourself.

What is the size of the membership of this mailing list?
What is the expected traffic of this mailing list?
How many people do you have to monitor the server and take care of
spammers and follow up with real time blacklist lists (in case you get
blacklisted)?

Also consider *free* (as in beer) options like Yahoo! and Google groups.

Thats nice to hear...
I have hardly seen any faculties showing interest in Open Source!!  If they
realise the fact, it will be a good awareness.

Is FSF, India under the non profit/NGO category?  Perhaps that might
help the babus understand the issue better.

For NASSCOM, I found this and perhaps it might help FSF's cause i.e.
Free Software for Free Computers under NASSCOM's program :)

Found out what the problem was I had "chromium-browser" installed and
"google-chrome" was getting updated on a frequent basis.  The reason why
chromium-browser did not get upgraded is because these two PPA's were
missing on my /etc/apt/sources.list

deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/chromium-daily/ppa/ubuntu lucid main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/chromium-daily/ppa/ubuntu lucid main

So for the next question of what is the difference between Chromium and
chrome I found these two url helpful, if at all any one is interested in it.

      Not a problem, right ? :) You can try out both and decide which
one suits you better. If you specifically want python, then Ansible is
a must, IMHO. But even otherwise, be sure to try it out. You might
like it :) Thanks

It looks like this has no requirement like puppet ssl hand shaking.
This might make automation more simple.

Subject: [FSFTN] Software Freedom Day at Pondicherry
To: mailinglist at fsftn.org


Pondicherry witnessed the first software freedom day celebration yesterday.
PuduvaiLUG organized the event at Petit Seminaire school.The venue, and
some of the later events brought out the significance of introducing Free
Software in schools

Mr.Prasanna Venkatesh and his team were hospitable and made arrangements
for FSFTN to set up a stall on "Free Software Philosophy" which was run by
PuduvaiLUG and FSFTN members. Mr. Prakash and Mr.Deepak Johnson chipped in
their artistic skills and and created a collection of uber cool Free
software logos in a matter of minutes. There were stalls on a variety of
languages and applications such as LISP,Python,Android,Virtual
box,Stellarium etc. Professionals from BlueLight technologies gave a
demonstration of booting the OS from a server through LAN and also
explained how and why Linux made the system more secure.

A lot of people were attracted to the stall on Stellarium, a free software
that models space. The volunteers at Free Software stall did a great job
and gave a clear overview of Free Software in general, and Pinguy OS and
Wikpedia in particular. Mr. Yogesh Girikumar talked on Free Software
philosophy and extended the concepts of openness. He held the audience
spell-bound and was kept busy by eager students throughout the day, who
approached him to clarify their doubts.

There were some shortcomings.
1. Some stalls demonstrated free software applications on a closed,non-free
Operating System. This defeated the purpose of using Free Software
2. Practical demonstration of certain concepts was missing. The demos
 required very little effort and would have made the concepts much more
understandable
3. Freedoms were  numbered starting from 1.

The Deputy Inspector of Schools paid a visit and expressed her strong
desire to introduce FOSS to students from the elementary level. Her
enthusiasm and encouragement was motivational.

Mr.Bala and Mr.Amachu spoke on the scope of FOSS and the reasons for using
it. Mr.Bala put forth thought-provoking questions which made us ponder on
the positive impact of FOSS in India. Mr. Welkin gave suggestions for
building on the community base established today. Many of the participants
agreed to visit Chennai on 22nd September to celebrate Software Freedom at
College Of Engineering, Guindy. Kudos to PuduvaiLUG for their initiative.

I don't know much about him, but its evident that he truly believed in 
free software and worked for its principles. I think he deserves much 
more than a wordpress page. Why can't we have a wikipedia page for him. 
If possible a Kenneth prize for those who have done best contribution 
for free software in India / Tamilnadu.

What I say here may not be easy to achieve, but I feel we must try for 
fellow comrade it doesn't matter if we fail or succeed.

> Why can't we have a wikipedia page for him.

Yes I even thought of creating a wikipedia page and moving the content
of  http://ilugcbe.org.in/index.php?title=Kenneth_Gonsalvas to
wikipedia .

Wikipedia does have some policy for creating pages and those who
create it must be well aware of the rules at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biography

I am sure some of the list members have some experience , it would be
sad to see someone creating the page and it being deleted because of
wikipedia policy XYZ .

Pavithran

Thinking of sending this to a friend who is good in website designing. Is
it apt?
What are the requirements for designers?

To the best of my knowledge, clicking L and R buttons together is
equivalent to middle mouse button.

I am not sure if it will help you.

Greetings,

I know many in this list would be very much aware of the following,
Still I am posting hoping that our NexGen[xyzXYZ] might develop
interest in this interesting and challanging field.

I hope this interests somebody
www.ted.com/talks/andrew_blum_what_is_the_internet_really.html

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone

http://wikibon.org/blog/inside-ten-of-the-worlds-largest-data-centers/

http://www.flickr.com/groups/datacentercentral/pool/

I hope it widens at least some people's vision beyond latest phones,
laptops and desktops.

As an aside, this is where we find a *huge* majority of free/open
source software usage.

And an opportunity for immensely satisfying work knowledge, skill and
experience.

BTW, nobody is allowed with any kind of storage/camera phone inside a
datacenter without getting legal authorisation.

Cheers!

Today I got a message from Twitter that it included Tamil in their
list of languages to translate into. (Thanks to all those who read my
previous mail and voted for Tamil to be included.)

The url is:

I see some 5 or 6 people there started translating already. Please
join us and translate the glossary or atleast vote on other people's
translations.

Thank You,

"Twitter *owns the rights* to the translations you provide. You are
*giving*them to us so that we can use them however we want."

"You acknowledge and agree that Twitter owns all legal right, title, and
interest in and to the text strings, including any intellectual property or
other proprietary rights which may subsist in the text strings translated
or the resulting translations (whether those rights happen to be registered
or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). To the extent
Twitter does not own all such right, title and interest, you hereby assign
such rights, title, and interest to Twitter. You therefore acknowledge that
you have no intellectual property or other proprietary rights in such text
strings translated or the resulting translations."

I am not interested in getting a IPR. But, why should I spend my time to
translate something that will never be open to all?

Why not they hire people and do the job?

They want things to be done at our cost and time so that they will enjoy
the fruit. Why should I spend my time?

Hi,

We decided to develop a basic voting system that will be uses by all the
WLM countries for their voting process.

Because we don't really have the time, and we need this system ASAP, and
until now we didn't found a volunteer from our community who is able to do
it on his free time - we are willing to pay at modest cost for having this
system working as soon as possible for the chapters.

Draft of the specification we looking for is here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dBhgIyCvE8x1R6O0f-67136VBKGK8eAEq9_oe108DnQ/edit

I'll be happy to hear advise on this, and if you know someone who can do
it, please send him to me, itzik at wikimedia.org.il


Thanks,
Itzik

few weeks ago, i attended a two days workshop on Tamil computing and open
source at Anna university.

here are some of my views on the event.

it is a good move to have such events regularly. thanks for Anna university
and infitt group for this.

we need more computer professionals to learn linguistic skills. Tamil needs
lot of tools like corpus, spell checkers, grammar checker, morphological,
lexican analyzer etc.
we have to create these tools and release them as free open source software.

i thought this event Will be fully hands on and it Will teach of to create
these software. but the event has more theory and very little hands on that
too in a in house, non free open source software.

there were lot English talks. though all the participants know Tamil, the
speakers loved to talk only in English. very few talked in Tamil.

they teach using theory slides. very less demos.

they compare with English which has many free open source tools on
linguistic. they asked to create more software for Tamil.

the sad part is many of them showed their own products like spell checkers
and corpus etc. but they only sell the binaries. they wont give source. but
they are waiting for someone to do open source projects for Tamil.

even in Anna university, there is a Tamil computing lab, named tacola. they
created a Tamil word analyzer, Tamil dictionary, search engine. but they
are not open source. though these products are funded by government, they
cant release the source for public.

Tamil virtual university also funds for many Tamil software. but they also
non free open source.

they are ready to talk a lot about Tamil and their own software. but they
are not ready to give the code.

frustrated to know these things.

decided to work on more free open source Tamil computing software.

we only have to give freedom to Tamil computing from these business people.

Will plan and call for volunteers to workshops, hackathon etc. let us join
together to do more.

The issue is not limited to Tamil. Almost all the Indian languages
require these. The awkward part is that these are long running
"research" projects at various academic institutions and so there
hasn't been a strong effort to turn the codebase into working
products/prototypes. For example, the LTRC at IIIT-HYD,
<http://web2py.iiit.ac.in/research_centres/default/view_area/3> does a
lot such work as does CVPR, ISI Kolkata and IIT-Kharagpur.

many people in this forum might not like it. The tamil computing, as
envisaged by govt & TVU, might have to come up in two stages :
free software -- not in the sense of RMS, but freely downloadable. no
source code, developed and approved in cathedral model. the plus point here
is that the various departments will start using it. our efforts could be
to infuse as many FOSS tools as possible into developing the system, and
the package SHOULD run on linux platform. [I wouldn't risk talking about
BSD and other variants. Anyway, Apple Mac is also not in the picture!]

alongwith, FOSS developed in Bazaar model could be attempted -- possibly
dual licensing mode. It is a long and tedioud process. As Sankarshan says
it is the same status in all indian languages. political & approval
committee changes also add to the chaos. but we could strive.

Hi

Is there any easy tool like  google tamil transliteration IME, which could
be used in Ubuntu 12.04 for off-line tamil typing.
I find other tamil typing tools/methods available for Linux difficult for
novice.

Thanks.

Source: http://cloudstory.in/2012/07/what-is-common-between-mumbai-dabbawalas-and-apache-hadoop/

<quote>
Let me start by setting the context ? who is a Mumbai Dabbawala?
?Dabba? literally means a box and a Dabbawala is a person who carries
the box. Everyday, thousands of Mumbaikars (a slang that refers to the
residents of Mumbai, the financial capital of India) rely on the
Dabbawalas to deliver their lunch boxes carrying the homemade food to
their work places. Given the increased cost of living in India and the
reluctance to have junk food for everyday meal, many households depend
on the network of Dabbawalas. Mumbai is one of the largest cities in
the world and an average working professional will have to leave home
pretty early in the day to take the local train to commute to the
work. The packed food carried from home will lose its freshness by
noon. Mumbai Dabbawalas pick up the lunch box much later and manage to
deliver it just in time for lunch preserving the warmth of the home
food. The whole process repeats in the evening when they collect the
empty boxes to drop them back at the respective households. So, what
is special about it and how is this related to Apache Hadoop? Keep
reading!

Hi Friends,

After long time back again I started One Day One Application (OAOD)
service. Sorry for the break.


Application: GLX-Dock (Cairo-Dock with OpenGL)

What it is:

Cairo-Dock is a pretty, light and convenient interface to your
desktop, able to replace advantageously your system panel! It features
multi-docks, taskbar, launchers and a lot of useful applets. Applets
can be detached from the dock to act as desktop widgets. Numerous
ready-to-use themes are downloadable in 1 click, and can be easily
customized at your convenience. It can use hardware acceleration to be
very fast and low on CPU.

Screenshots:

http://www.glx-dock.org/mc_album.php?a=3

To know more about it:

http://www.glx-dock.org/index.php

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install cairo-dock cairo-dock-plug-ins

Documentation:

Hi,

For a remote data acquisition project, I need a Linux box connected to the
internet through 3G. I have gone through list archives, but the threads are
over a year old and want some current information. Is there any 3G service
provider with:

   - A modem which simply works out of the box. I will be
   installing Debian base with no X and hence cannot use any GUI based
   configuration tool which they might provide.
   - Good upload speeds (at least 800 kbps)

If yes, could use a 3G router and get away with lesser pain, Imho..

This is a really good option.
But for the current project, I need to bundle all the hardware into a
mini-itx cabinet. This might be a hassle if I use a 3G router. But I will
use this as a final fall back. Thanks!

Can you not install one of the 3G data USB data cards?  I believe most
of them work out of the box with wvdial (i.e. no GUI).  What works on
a laptop should also work on a desktop USB port.

I suspect most 3G data providers have a much lower "upload" speeds
since the services are consumer oriented i.e. upstream packets are
mostly http url strings.   I do not have a 3G USB dongle so no
personal experience with upload speeds.

@ members of the ILUG-Chennai list    can you share your speed test
results from (traffic going over USB data cards)

Yes I use Reliance Netconnect Huawei EC1262
It works out of the box with wvdial.
But it is Broadband+ service. I need to check it out with a 3G connection.
I am going to check a friend's Tata Photon this afternoon.

This is a big problem with ADSL connections. But 3G is much better. I have
seen upload speeds of 1.2 Mbps against download speed of 3 Mbps in an
Airtel 3G connection. My home ADSL 2 Mbps (BSNL) connection which gives
0.35 Mbps upload and 1.2 Mbps download speeds.

Hi

All of a sudden the key board & mouse were not working with machine loaded with CENTOS 6.0. I had checked with bios settings while booting and could not find any fault with factory settings.
could anybody guide further to find a solution to this? The machine is DELL OPTIPLEX GX620.

with thanks in advance

If the problem only occurs in runlevel 5 (GUI), try booting in
runlevel 3 or single mode mode, and check whether keyboard gets
detected.

Did you update xorg-server?It seems like a problem with Xorg. The newer X
have the feature of hotplug support of adding input devices.Please switch
to single user mode and check any /dev/input/event files present.If the
files are there, post the contents of /var/log/Xorg.log in pastebin site
and send the link to list.Please dont paste the log in list

Hi 

sorry to say that the default machine is not accessible through N/W. However, booting through run level 1, I could check the contents displayed using "lsusb" command as follows, 

Bus 002 Device 002: ID 413C:2003 Dell Computer Corp. keyboard
Bus 002 Device 003: ID 413C:3010 Dell Computer Corp. Optical Wheel Mouse

with thanx

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEN4XNth61o&feature=em-uploademail-new  The
open-source world has learned to deal with a flood of new, oftentimes
divergent, ideas using hosting services like GitHub -- so why can't
governments? In this rousing talk Clay Shirky shows how democracies can
take a lesson from the Internet, to be not just transparent but also to
draw on the knowledge of all their citizens.

<quote>
Blender movies have always amazed us all with its interesting little
stories and sophisticated visual graphics. While Elephants Dream was
of sci-fi kind with mind-bending ideas and graphics, Bug Buck Bunny
was a light-hearted comedy. The third one, Sintel, also had splendid
graphics to back-up its unique storyline. Tears of Steel is different
though. It is not a full-fledged end-to-end animation movie per se
like its predecessors. Tears of Steel is more like a normal movie with
impressive visual effects.

Hi,

I practice Training as my job,

>>thanks for your interest.

>>it is nice to give the support from ilugc as a team.

I do not mind to do the job with ILUGC, without ILUGC or in spite of ILUGC.

If you believe the list is 'open' and if you appreciate a healthy delivery
of Training  and a fair competition , please let me know the contact detail.

regards

I dont know how to respond to this answer :-(

I am collecting the list of trainers for the sessions there.
We have to fix the schedule as a team.

> without ILUGC or in spite of ILUGC.

If you like to handle the sessions, individually, please goto the
college in person and meet him for further discussions.

No harm in being "open" by sharing the details.
But, then more people will be contacting the college in the name of ILUGC,
even without the knowledge of any of us.

How can we prevent this?

I dont want some X to use the name of ILUGC to make their business,
without our knowledge.

You are already in our list of trainers.
I am getting some more personal mails with the profiles of trainers
from chennai and banglore.

Will wait for some more days and then call for a IRC meeting to fix
the schedule.

Thanks for understanding.

Did you update xorg-server?It seems like a problem with Xorg. The newer X
have the feature of hotplug support of adding input devices.Please switch
to single user mode and check any /dev/input/event files present.If the
files are there, post the contents of /var/log/Xorg.log in pastebin site
and send the link to list.Please dont paste the log in list

I was curious to see the 0.35 Mbps limit. Coincidentally I have been facing
it on BSNL 3G offlate, so it might mostly be something to do with BSNL
throttling uploads rather than ADSL limits. Even on Airtel 3G I got only
0.7 Mbps upload speed against 4.25 Mbps download speed.  I used to have
FTTH a while back and I used to get 1:1 download/upload speeds then.

Hi,


>without ILUGC or in spite of ILUGC.
>>If you like to handle the sessions, individually, please goto the

I had done in the past. Thanks for your suggestion.

In the past, the earlier list guidelines , one of it was saying that "a
training programme is left to the party and the resource to fix up the
modalities". This guideline is not there in the present one.

Sorry if i am blunt, "was it conveniently ignored"!.


>>No harm in being "open" by sharing the details.

mail the trainers off the list.
will it not help?

In the present case the HOD wants it to be jointly organised by ILUGC and his college. It will be some thing like 'DG Vaishnav College and Indian Linux Users Group, Chennai will conduct the certificate program'.

The technical responsibility of providing trainers lies with us, they will take care of organisational things.  That is why we need a pool of trainers, just in case someone could not make it on any day, an alternative can be aranged.

Hi


>>In the present case the HOD wants it to be jointly organised by ILUGC and
his college. It will be some thing like 'DG Vaishnav College and Indian
Linux Users Group, Chennai will conduct the certificate program'.

Kindly prefix the above content in such deals in future.
It helps a person like me to understand it is regulated by a set of people.
I can stay off the race.


>>The technical responsibility of providing trainers lies with us, they
will take care of organisational things.  That is why we need a pool of

I have done many workshops in the past and have seen many situations like
absence of the trainer, tsunami and etc still delivered successful pro
grammes.

Hi,

"I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death
your right to say it. - Voltaire."

Getting the contact details of the HOD, DG Vaishnav, an alternative
training plan can be given and let the HOD take a call after hearing other
perspectives.
Nothing stops in giving contact details of the HOD.

To me, It is appearing like "My way or high way".
Thanks for hearing my arguments patiently. I close with this.

regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Application: Battle for Wesnoth

What it is: A fantasy turn-based strategy game

This package depends on the complete set of packages built from the
wesnoth source package but the server (which can be found in the
wesnoth-1.10-server package), most helpful if you always want to have
all the official campaigns installed. If you only want to play over
the network with other players or want to play only a few campaigns
you just need to install the wesnoth-1.10-core package and the wanted
campaign packages.

Battle for control of villages, using variety of units which have
advantages and disadvantages in different types of terrains and
against different types of attacks. Units gain experience and advance
levels, and are carried over from one scenario to the next in a
campaign.

Stating that the training requirement is for DG Vaishnav, Chennai
itself is revealing the identity. Now it is open for anyone to contact
the HOD and put forth their training plan and act accordingly.

If its so revealing hen why not give the contact details of HOD for fair 
competition. when you distribute binaries of free software, you must do 
it with source. ;-)

Hi

I have installed phonetic (m17n) as input method and tried typing tamil
(libreoffice in Ubuntu 12.04 ). It is working. But for typing certain
characters and to correct spellings, I find it difficult. Is there any
manual or virtual keyboard available for this as in google IME for
windows?. Any easy tool for typing in tamil for those who don't know tamil
keyboard? I shall appreciate any help.

Thanks

You are welcome to accompany ilugc in their events and contact them as
ilugc and do whatever you want, than going there personally and meeting
them as an individual (though you have the freedom to do). Avoiding to give
the details viz phone number of contact person can even be due to the
personal request of the contact person.
Why can't you take Shrinivasan as the convenor for this program and join
hands with him instead of talking about fair competition

Thanks

No, I'm not interested in training now. In-fact I support ILUGC 
leadership. But I also feel that if some one wants to compete, we must 
give a fair chance. Putting out contact details on a forum  may not be 
appropriate, but with the permission of HOD of the college you can gives 
his contacts to the possible competitor so that the students will 
benefit the best.

Revealing source code is different from revealing data. The source code viz HOD,Computer Science DG Vaishnav college has already been revealed. His personal data like phone number need not be revealed in public forum. Even if were to be done we need his consent. 

We don't need hubble telescope to discover his contact details through other means.

Besides RBL, some sites (e.g. AOL) also require the PTR record (of the
IP number) pointing back to the same domain name of the MX record.

Yes.. iBus is pretty easy!!

Mostly, iBus will be installed by default. Check in Dash (it has an icon
'i')
Else, Download from Ubuntu Software Centre and installl!

You can select the required  input method (Phonetic in your case) by going
to iBus--> Preferences -->

To enable iBus, go to System Settings --> Lanugages and Change the option
in Keyboard Input Method to iBus

A manual Keymap (For Phonetic) can be found in this Page:

http://help.keymandesktop.com/keyboards/Keyboard_ekwunitamil.php?language=tam

Any easy tool for typing in tamil for those who don't know tamil keyboard?



I would recommend you try *Tamil 99*..
Keyboard Mapping:  http://blog.ravidreams.net/tamil99/
It is very simple and Easy to learn and adapt....

Personally,  I would not recommend learning phonetic keyboard. It kills our
Language Tamil and makes us type in Tanglish!!
Just imagine...
It is horrible to type as "wEngka thamiz pEsupavarA?" for " ????? ?????
?????????"

Hope I helped you!!

This is a common problem when running our own mail server. Each
blacklist removal is different.

But not to figure on any blacklist we have to have reverse PTR but
that is something that even Postfix enforces, we should not be running
an open relay(again enforced by Postfix) and we should run an up to
date version of virus scanner on all windows machines in the network.

Or you could even block port 25 on your firewall and allow it only in
the mail server.

The challenge in running one's own mail server is actually to not
appear on any worldwide blacklist.

It is not easy.

And lot of people watch out for what your mail server does all the time. ;)

But it is not uncommon, so don't worry!

Hello guyz,

I thought of closing the conversation, however the previous mails mandates
me to respond.

Serving ilugc as for quite some time in the past,arranging
meetings,seminars and expo's thought this list will be reciprocating in
understanding my prerogative of doing program alone or ganging up with a
set of people.

While contact details like phone number cannot be given on the list, for
those people who contributed to FOSS through ilugc or to any fossians, the
details can be given off the list. my plea would be, please give the *email
id* of the HOD in the mailing list, it facilitates many to access the
opportunity.

If you are on broadband with one of these ISP BSNL or Airtel you will not
be able to, because as soon as you try to send an email, the google server
or hotmail server would come back telling that this is not the designated
IP for sending email for xxx.xxxx.xxx.xx.airtel.in or yyy.yy.yyy.yyy.bsnl.in
.

Please let us know what is the ISP you have and do you have a static IP.
If you have a static IP then you have a better chance or getting delisted
from RBL.

Boss,

Without static IP you cannot run a mail server.

It is better to have a mail relay service provider to send all mails to the
cloud that are originating from our mail server. It might be one of the way
to protect our server.
