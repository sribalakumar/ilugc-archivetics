Hi All,
After we search for something in vim using
/searchterm .. how does one undo the search
highlighting. I don't want to set the
hightlighting off. I just want to turn off the
highlighting of current matches. I generally
search for some garbage word which would return no
matches to get around.

have you defined in /etc/fstab to mount /dev/sda6 during boot?

What does fdisk -l /dev/sda show?
mount the partition and check df -h

Subject: [Ilugc] how to connect a database to a map and show through google

Message-ID: <1207023269.3536.105.camel@laptop.censusindia.net>

Hello,

I have information in a database. The information is :
Village-district-city names and some numbers (of members of a social
organisation) related to that.

I want to show these numbers by clicking on the Village-district-city
name and then connect them to google-maps and show them at exact
location.
Also need to show the India-map with some dots/mark showing locations
that have the numbers as distinct from those that don't have the
numbers.
The beginning would be a map of india showing some marks where the
numbers are. Additionally, there can be a table on a side showing the
locations by name. One can click on any of these locations in the map or
table and reach the exact location and see the detailed numbers on that
location.

What all needs to be used to be able to show these finally with the help
of google-maps ?

Thanks.

Peace, Force & Joy!   Sudhir Gandotra.  98-101-20918

Google maps has a API you have to just map a API call passing the parameters.

I get this

http://search.cpan.org/search?query=minicom&mode=all

but I have not spent much time on it.

There may be a speed setting problem in minicom or you might be using
hardware flow control.

Inside minicom type Ctrl-A O and fix those problems.

Minicom itself can log commands I think.

You can also use an interactive command like tip(1) or cu(1) for this
purpose.

Best of luck.

Searching for a non existent string (garbage) is what I used to do until

Hi,

http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS6229131777.html

So, while Linux does have a substantial contribution being made to it by 
amateurs, the vast bulk of it is being written by corporate programmers. 
The companies that are building Linux, in order of their contributions 
to the kernel, are:

       1) Red Hat, 11.2 percent
       2) Novell, 8.9 percent
       3) IBM, 8.3 percent
       4) Intel, 4.1 percent
       5) LF, 3.5 percent
       6) SGI, 2.0 percent
       7) MIPS Technology, 1.6 percent
       8) Oracle, 1.3 percent
       9) MontaVista, 1.2 percent
       10) Lintronix, 1.0 percent.


In addition, consultants' efforts have counted for 2.5 percent of the 
total work on Linux.

Eh?

vi and vim are two different things on UNIX. Alas most linux distros
make it an alias.

But one need not delete the .vimrc file. vim supports the -C option
which makes vim vi compatible.

I changed my motherboard to intel DG33FB and clearly it was the worst
decision I made.
Now I have a SCSI DVD writer and 2 IDE hard disks 80gig and 250gig
My FreeBSD install was unable to use the hard disks since the IDE
controllers were unrecognized.
My gentoo CD couldnt boot because it couldn't find the Sata CD. When I
changed the bios to identify it as AHCI, it recognized the CD, but the dear
ol hard disks were not recognized.
My new adventure into the world of the Hurd OS got spoilt because of the
same
Luckily my distro of choice Arch, ran smoothly. :(

Is there anyone out there with fixes to it?
Of course I understand that only Arch and Ubuntu had enough modules built
into the kernel to recognize this odd combo

It is clear that they have manipulated and won an important round. Now,
the only way is to make some Government/s appeal in the matter within 60

It may be worth trying an effort (in the form of a strong-focused

and educate various Governments. It will be a worthy cause to make this
effort and also we test the strength of the community (with a view to
improve it further as a result of this test).
We need our world to be ours and we need to take it away from the

Microsoft wins battle for OOXML approval
http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39378350,00.htm 


The International Organization for Standardization has officially
approved Microsoft's OOXML specification as a standard.

The news confirms documents leaked on Tuesday were genuine.
Three-quarters of the "Principal Countries" involved in the vote gave
their approval (at least two-thirds were needed) and just 14 percent of
participating members of ISO and the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) disapproved (under a quarter was needed).

According to ISO's Wednesday statement: "Subject to there being no
formal appeals from ISO/IEC national bodies in the next two months, the
International Standard will accordingly proceed to publication."

Although there have been allegations of voting irregularities within
some of the national standards bodies that in turn participated in the
ISO vote, no national body has yet made a formal appeal to ISO.

One prominent example had been an objection from Steve Pepper, the
chairman of Standard Norge's joint technical committee, which he faxed
directly to the ISO. In the letter, he claimed that 80 percent of the
committee had been against the OOXML standard being passed ? Norway
officially recorded a vote of approval.

However, a spokesperson for Standard Norge told ZDNet.co.uk on Wednesday
that the organisation had not made a formal appeal to ISO, and did not
intend to do so. "One of the committee members sent a fax to ISO about
this matter, but he did that directly and not through us," the
spokesperson said.

A spokesperson for ISO confirmed on Wednesday that it had not yet
received any formal objections to the OOXML voting process, and refused
to comment on the reports of voting irregularities within national
bodies.

Hmm.. one of my friend asked me about this issue some days ago. He just
asked me... "Why programmers are working for linux? What is their *actual*
motto?" He also asked me, "Does they only works for *open source
mentality*??, How about money??"

And .. i said..."yea...may be ..."

The dichotomy between working for "open source mentality" vs "money" is 
frequently a false one. Many people with a passion for Free software and 
money is a means to pursue that passion.

If you find it difficult to type the above command, just map keys to do the job

* Press Space to turn off highlighting and blank message.
:noremap <silent> <Space> :silent noh<bar>:echo ""<CR>

* Press Ctrl-N to turn off highlighting.
:noremap <silent> <C-N> :silent noh<CR>

My gentoo CD couldnt boot because it couldn't find the Sata CD. When I
changed the bios to identify it as AHCI, it recognized the CD, but the dear
ol hard disks were not recognized.

I think the problem is becoz of the recognition of the DVD drive is notfrom the MB drivers (chipset), the drive on these new boards are connected differently. I have run into this prob, but forget exactlywhat. I will post when I remember it. I can't recall the MB model too .

But I installed  Linux, (I think FC 6 / Slackware 12 , again cannotrecall, ) with a USB CD drive, and the OS works fine. It recognises theDVD drive and the HDDs , no prob there.

I know the reply is quite unhelpful in specific, but i mean to say, if the OS is installed , it may be OK thereafter.

devafree

What specific external patch made Arch work properly ?
With all the noise about the kernel package not conforming to 'The Arch Way',
you might want to jump into the flamewar taking place in arch-dev-public. :)

please include quotes when you are quoting material. When I read this  
I thought you had written it. Only after checking the link I find it  
is just a quote.

Qmail has something called qmailtoaster, a CentOS based ISO I think.

The better option would be to install postfix.

http://www.postfix.org

As to spam and virus filtering, there are many options.

You have a million readmes on the Internet on these matters.

clamav for virus filtering and Vipul's razor for spam control come to
mind.

But spam control involves a lot more. Like tarpitting, greylisting, RBL
checks, SPF and so on.

My del.icio might have some of them. But google is your best friend.

There's lots of solutions out there. I am not familiar enough with all
of them to recommend one as per your needs.

> (Including spam filter and virus scanner).

How about spamassassin for filtering spam and clamavisd for virus
scanning.

> OS is Centos 5.1 or FC 8

They should have the above mentioned packages so not much of a problem.

Dear Sujith,
			Alas, this is one of the problems when you go in for bleeding edge hardware 
on Linux/Other non-MS OS's. Driver development unfortunately is not as fast as 
for windows, and is often plagued by bugs in the start stages. I still 
remember the time when I had bought my nforce 430/Geforce 6150 motherboard 
(Dec 2005). Fedora Core 4, wouldnt detect the SATA controller (My hard disk 
is SATA), no audio, no LAN and even no graphics. FC5 enabled graphics (2d via 
the nv driver), SATA. Finally Nvidia released some rpms for LAN and audio and 
proper 3D drivers for the integrated graphics chipset. It was only in FC6 
(released after abt a yr, circa oct 2006), that everything worked out of the 
box (Infact everything worked from 2.6.17 kernel). So I guess with time your 
problems will stabilize. :) You can try Debian now. Maybe you can pickup the 
2.6.24.4 kernel from Sid(unstable) and see if your problems get resolved.

For the jobs described below, GNU/Linux is a key minimum requirement.
If you're qualified and strongly interested, please email me your resume
at
	caiqs.jobs@citi.com

If you use a subject line of the following form, it would help to
simplify my life, and would be greatly appreciated :-)

    "ILUGC - $(grep ^`whoami`: | tr : \\n | head -5 | tail -1)"

Also, if you're really bright but your academic background does'nt show
it, you could be considered as well.   And now please read on:



One of the world's largest financial organisations has constituted a
highly-focussed internal business group which seeks to exploit advanced
technologies in computation, data and finance for the purpose of
out-performing in the global securities marketplace.   The group is
envisioned to be small and closely-knit with 2 main centers of
operation, New York and Chennai, along with additional operational
footprint in Europe and Far East.

For the nascent Chennai center, we are seeking smart people with very
strong pragmatic computing skills and a solid engineering/science
academic background.

For computational requirements, candidates would have demonstrable
experience on GNU/Linux, on which platform they would have written
significant Python/Perl code with database interaction, or they would
have coded multithreaded C/C++.

The selected candidates would be extremely hard-working and driven to
excel.  They would be able to work well with other (including
geographically remote) team members.  All hires will gain expertise in
understanding and manipulating data.  They will also be ensuring the
optimal and highly-performant operation of a multitude of interdependent
streams of data manipulation and processing - activities that are
deployed within the group's execution/data centers which are colocated
at the world's major securities trading hubs.

All hires, regardless of background or focus will directly integrate and
report into this global team.  Due to the group's points of trading
presence in different time-zones, work at international hours will often
be required.   Work will be challenging and individuals will be
encouraged and mentored to grow in related subject areas that will have
long-term benefit to the group.

Compensation will be superior, will recognize individual contributions
and commitment, and will reflect the group's success.

I suggest you look into DeepOfix (http://www.deeproot.co.in/deepofix). It's
created by a company out of b'lore and seems pretty stable and
straightforward (I used it for a short while when they first released about
2 yrs back). Might save you a lot of admin headache, and you'll also be
supporting a local linux company :)

Subject: [Ilugc] reg SIGSERV in pThreads
Message-ID: <659732.29689.qm@web8402.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hi,

Background :
I am running a simple program (analogous to a server) which keeps running and accepts connection via socket for every request coming into the system and spawns a thread to process the request. This is using pthreads. The system seems to perform well till it reaches the magical number of 4096 - when the 4096th request comes in (all claps!!) the system seg faults(eternal damnation!!).

Debugging / Observations :
Debugging using gdb was of no avail , as i am still unable to spot the problem.  gdb spewed the following after the 4096th request:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. 
[Switching toThread -1212548176 (LWP 18931)] 
0x009a1977 in__gnu_cxx::__pool<true>::_M_get_thread_id () from /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6    

I was unable to continue with gdb after this as it started spewing some unrelated messages when i tried to access the variables at that instant - googling which didnt help me :(

I did notice that the RES and VIRT (obtained by 'top' cmd) kept on increasing when the program was running. 

Environment :
g++, gdb with pthreads on RHEL (language : cpp)

Questions :
a) Fix for the above problem or atleast the hints.
b) How do i know the the number of threads spawned by a process in Linux - either programatically or via cmds?
c) How do i know the mem/resource allocated for each of the threads spawned? (read 'threads' and not 'processes')
 
Cheers,
Venkat

KDE 4.0.3 is out for a day now. I am not sure if your distribution 
development version has it. If it does, you should probably update asap. 
KDE 4.0 was a very early (and somewhat premature) release and number of 
nasty bugs have been fixed in these minor updates.

Server side controls in Zimbra are not good enough. Scalix performs  
better on that front.

The memory usage reported by top is highly ambiguous.
To know the exact memory usage of your application, you have to use something else.
'pmap' comes to mind. See the manpage of pmap.

Also, you can look at the contents of /proc/<pid>/smaps.
A perl tool to parse it and display in a readable format is present here:
http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/%7Ebmaurer/memory/smem.pl.
This script depends on this package: http://search.cpan.org/%7Eopi/Linux-Smaps-0.01/
Or you can run a full-fledged memory profiler. I would suggest Valgrind.

To see the threads an app has spawned, I usually use 'pstree -p'.
Threads are contained in curly braces.

And finally, gdb is very much capable of debugging threads.
See: http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_5.html#SEC27

Are you checking the return value of all pthread_* functions - in particular

KDE 4 packages are currently in the experimental branch of debian  and are
not intended to be installed on a production system.
Check http://pkg-kde.alioth.debian.org/kde4.html

My suggestion is .. do a console login and upgrade your packages :)

My default desktop is xfce and no problems with that. KDE 4.0 I
installed after being impressed with the eye candy. Though it had lot
of basic problem like, unable to create a custom icon in the desktop,
it looked cool. For two days I was showing off with KDE and trying to
lure people from Vista.  After the crash coming back to xfce was bit
of a turn off for me. Guess I have wait for the experimental branch to
upgrade to KDE 4.0.3.

I had the same problem but figured out a round about way to create
custom icons in Desktop as well as on the panel. First you have to add
it to the menu, right click on the KDE menu and chose KmenuEdit. After
you have it in the menu, just right click on it and select sent to
favorites, panel or desktop as you wish.

I moved to KDE svn trunk after trying 4.0.2 from experimental.

Cheers

Keep KDE 3.5.x and install KDE 4 separately. Its getting better day after
day.

Upgrade KDE4 separately.

You can choose to toggle between the two.

Thanks for the tip. I will try it. How can I check what KDE version is
installed in my system? My system is Debian Lenny.

   hi,

   I am trying to access a Canon Powershot SX100 IS in Fedora 8, but i am not
   able to access it. I tried using F-spot & digi kam. Both of them are not

   tried using Generic drivers, but no avail. I also tried using different
   camera models from Canon, that doesn't help either.

   any idea what these errors mean?  Tried searching on internet, but hardly

   Anybody has a previous experience on these sort of errors before, either
   with Camera's or any other USB devices?

Is this all you get in the logs?

I have only one question. Does it report as ugen0? 

If it does that then you are in trouble.

If instead it creates a storage device then you are safe.


Please send the complete log.

If this is the complete log well then your kernel doesn't support it.

ugen0 devices are unsupported. The way USB device probing works is -
there is a probing for a specific device type, then device class, if it
does not find anything it already knows then it creates a generic class
device. 

Which is another way of USB telling you "I know nothing about this."

It's a bad advice but try masking as IE 6. I don't know if such a thing
is available for Firefox, but opera sure has it.

Firefox has a useragent switcher addon. Get that and change the user
agent to IE6

Generally cameras have 2 modes of connectivity to the PC.
1. PTP mode  - Photo transfer protocol
2. Proprietary mode/ in some other cameras - USB mass storage mode

I have never owned a Cannon camera, but its worth while for you to
check, if your camera supports a PTP mode (try the USB/Connectivity
mode under the settings menu).

With PTP mode, your camera should work out of the box. If your camera
supports a USB mass storage mode, it should have been detected by now
using DigiKam/gphoto/... something similar.


HTH,

Open any KDE application . Go to Help -> About KDE   will give you  the
version of the KDE. If its a svn compile it gives the date of the checkout

        Try: dpkg -l kde\*

        This will show the version number of major kde components
 installed on the system.

Hi,
I installed SCIM for GNOME on Debian Etch, and am able to type Telugu
using Rice Transliteration Scheme (RTS) in gedit and Evolution. I
understand that OpenOffice is not a GNOME app and hence wouldn't let me
use SCIM. 

I get perfectly rendered Telugu in OpenOffice when I copy-paste text
from Evolution; but get a lot of garbage when I copy from gedit. I want
to understand this behaviour. Can someone refer me to sources that
explain what happens behind the monitor to display text and fonts the
way I see them?

Thank you,

Message-ID: <406f1f3f0804071051h72289882nbdac2d22629831d5@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

A GNU/Linux Installation fest is being arranged on 12th April, 2008 in
the heart of Trivandrum  City, by GNU/Linux Users
Group(www.ilug-tvm.org), Trivandrum and FSF India(www.fsf.org.in), in
collaboration with Zyxware Technologies(www.zyxware.com) and
SPACE(www.space-kerala.org). This fest is being organized as a part of
Dishaa '08, an event by the students of Sree Chithira Thirunal College
of Engineering, one of the pioneer engineering colleges in the city.

You can check the site of Dishaa '08 at http://www.dishaa08.com and
the page for GNU/Linux Installation Fest -
http://dishaa08.com/tech/linux/ . More details on the same can be
found in the website of GNU/Linux User Group, Trivandrum -
http://www.ilug-tvm.org/ and also in Zyxware's website -
http://www.zyxware.com/articles/2008/04/07/first-gnu-linux-install-fest-in-kerala-for-the-general-public

It is for the first time that an event of this scale, is being
organized in Trivandrum and for that matter, in Kerala. All major
press and television media have been contacted and have already
started providing coverage regarding the installation fest. We are
expecting at least 500 visitors to the stall. As part of the fest, we
will be offering Ubuntu as the primary choice
 of distro and we will distribute Ubuntu CDs to all who show interest.
Visitors will also be able to get any other GNU/Linux distro(any from
the list available at (http://www.zyxware.com/requestcd/urllist)
installed instead of Ubuntu.

We have about 12 volunteers for that day and we hope to do atleast 100
installations during the day. All those who do not bring their systems
to the fest, will get an option to register for a free installation at
a later period by Zyxware employees or ilug-tvm volunteers. A similar
program has been running successfully at Zyxware as part of our Ubuntu
Services(http://www.zyxware.com/articles/2008/01/29/get-ubuntu-installed-on-your-laptop-for-free).
Additionally we will also be providing Ubuntu bootable pen drives
during the fest(http://www.zyxware.com/articles/2008/03/26/ubuntu-live-usb-pen-drives-order-online).

We are looking forward to all the support we can get from the
community in terms of publicizing this event.

Cheers
Anoop

Hi,
Even i faced a similar kind of problem but not in ubuntu but on fedora 7
when i installed solaris express edition after linux installation.What i did
was I copied the solaris grub entry

title Solaris 10 1/06
        root (hd0,2,d)
        kernel /platform/i86pc/multiboot
        module /platform/i86pc/boot_archive
the (hd0,2,d) part can vary.I copied this in /boot/grub/menu.lst and
rebooted.

Hope This works for you

I think, you can go for any configuration now. Cause, modern linux distros
are much familiar with most of the hardwares. Plus, personally i think that
it is ok to get some non-compatible  hardwares for linux. Believe me, you
will learn a lot from this issue.

"How and where to get through Net" ?
It took me about 3 seconds extra to type complete words. :)

To answer your question, you should have root permissions to access commands
in /sbin. You can either switch to root using 'su' or use 'sudo' if the
proper permissions have been set for your user.

Thats a lot of money for 1 PC! I would suggest that you spend 15K on a
m/c that you can use to tinker with and another 20k on one that is for
your regular use - to be able to browse on and fix the one you have
tinkered too much :-)

6th April 2008

This letter is to express our deep disappointment over your open
support to the OOXML format forced through ISO by Microsoft. Being the
top IT giants and thus the representatives of the IT industry in the
country, it is a great shock to us that you do not stand with academia
of the country and its representatives like the IITs, IIMs and IISc in
supporting the Open Document Format (ODF) which is a true Free and
Open Standard already recognised as an ISO Standard. Considering that
a major portion of your employees come from such institutions, it is a
wonder to us that you have decided to go ahead with this decisions. We
would like to hear your explanation with respect to these points
:-(quoted from www.noooxml.org/petition)

1. There is already a standard ISO26300 named Open Document Format
(ODF): a dual standard adds costs, uncertainty and confusion to
industry, government and citizens;

2. There is no provable implementation of the OOXML specification:
Microsoft Office 2007 produces a special version of OOXML, not a file
format which complies with the OOXML specification;

3. There is information missing from the specification document, for
example how to do a ?autoSpaceLikeWord95? or
?useWord97LineBreakRules?;

4. More than 10% of the examples mentioned in the proposed standard do
not validate as XML;

5. There is no guarantee that anybody can write software that fully or
partially implements the OOXML specification without being liable to
patent lawsuits or patent license fees by Microsoft;

6. This format conflicts with existing ISO standards, such as ISO 8601
(Representation of dates and times), ISO 639 (Codes for the
Representation of Names and Languages) or ISO/IEC 10118-3
(cryptographic hash);

7. There is a bug in the spreadsheet file format which forbids any
date before the year 1900: such bugs affect the OOXML specification as
well as software applications like Microsoft Excel 2000, XP, 2003 and
2007.

8. This standard proposal was not created by bringing together the
experience and expertise of all interested parties (such as the
producers, sellers, buyers, users and regulators), but by Microsoft
alone.

With this decision, the impression you are making on your future
employees in the academia is not a very pretty one. In fact, the
development of OOXML receiving ISO?s approval has devalued our
confidence in the standards setting process itself. We hope that you
will put self-profit behind our country?s needs, change your decision,
and stand with the rest of the country on this issue.


PS:
Please forward this to the groups you are in...

Man,

You send 3 talks and say "hope this helps". ;)

It is going to be great fun and interesting how people sit thro' 3
disparate topics that have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with 
one another. ;)

Have fun. ;)

Can't you think of splitting them or doing it next month or something?

When its obvious that all their concern is to double their next quarter's
turn-over, their decision on OOXML is on expected lines. Why let NASSCOM
out?

The CTS chief had just departed from it top position.

You seem to be one of those great personalities that exist in all times of
history to do the back-stabbing of the efforts of selfless people. Just like
them, your efforts may well find you a place in history - just keep up with
your efforts.
However, I will try to clarify some points that I thaink matter here :

> of IIT, IIM and IISc have contributed to development of any world standards!
> If so called 'academicians' of these three institutes truly believe that

The trouble, that goes in favour of people like you and companies like the m$
and these 4 big ones is : No one cares for the country, no one cares for the
world - all are bothered about their pockets alone. And, in that priority,
everything like the society, the good of the world, the country, the family -
just everything other than the bank-balance, are lost. So is the case of most
of the peple at these institutions who start counting their bank balance even
before completing theier studies.In such circumstances, whet is the worth of
selfless acts of a few who care for the world ?

Arguments are arguments and a better lawyer can win even againat the perfect
case by just the right point of argument. So, let;s leave them at that.
Its a known fact of history how ISO was created and how it killed (with 
the help
of corrupt politicians and industrialists) the established standards (remember
the good old ISI mark ?). So, everything that the ISO does can only be seen
with doubts (in the best case).
And, to whom should one make the case to ? To the bodies headed by corrupt
politicians or to their paid chamchas who head various bodies ?

Yes, talking about the good of the world, about the god of the country, about
the good of the people around, is all jingoism and let this not bother the
great soul like yours.
An infortunate reminder is that the ODF remains supported by not just the BIS
but by many others who remains un-corrupted - the rare couragious lot.
Regarding the 3 or 4 companies : let's not forget that they have "great
alliances" with the microsoft and this means huge income for them and 
companies
being companies, they look just at their balance-sheets. In these
balance-sheets, there is no head calld "country", "society", "selfless 
action",
"good fo the others" and hence, they see only what is there.
Rare are the companies who also care, truely care for their environments.

Oh my! where is the merit in which you have to go ?
The world, the country, the others, the family, the friends --- all 
these terms
are not part of your bank balance, so they don't deserver your attention.
Just one suggestion: Who are you bothered about all this ? And who was 
making a
petition to you that you had to reject it ?
spend your time in earning for yourself - don't expect any support from others
when you will need it - just live for yourself and try to be happy, and if you
can do that, the world will be a better place anyway. I wonder if it needs
people like you messing up with it more !

why not? that is the thrill of FOSS. In fact in all the LUG meetings  
I have attended, the talks have nothing to do with each other. In  
fact the first LUG meet I attended there was a talk on closed source  
Kalkulate followed by a talk on the benefits of using a scripting  
language in open source programming! The beauty of FOSS is the  
ability to multitask and do several different things at the same  
time. Long live diversity!

Message-ID: <c24555040804100024tede49c5v508c62c13f61a49d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm planning to make some embedded Linux/Microcontroller boards. Does
anyone know companies that will etch PCBs in small numbers? These will
be single sided, simple boards. I will be able to provide the
gEda/Eagle files. Since I will be requiring only 2-3 pieces, I am
wondering if someone will be ready to do this stuff.

TIA,

Sir,
    How many PCBs you want. Are you have PCB Layout?
Are you an Electronics hobbiest?

If you want 1 or 2, it is best to make it yourself. which is more
interesting also. PCB layout designing also possible in Linux.

None of the reasons quoted above are valid reasons for considering ODF
over OOXML. These companies cannot be expected to consider one format over
another because some of their employees come from some institute which may
prefer that format.

However, the reasons you have quoted from www.noooxml.org are all valid.

From: sudhir@openlx.com:

ISO is an organization comprised of academicians and industry. There is
nothing "selfless" about working in ISO or forming a standard. Also, this
is not about personalities.

One of the reasons for having a standard is to aid interoperability. It
just so happens that this time around OOXML was adopted as a standard -
and this is not the first time an inferior format has been adopted as the
standard by the ISO.

You are implying that these companies got paid off by MS for supporting
OOXML. That is a serious allegation to make without any evidence. Also, I
don't think there is anything selfless about forming a standard.

Also, I think we are making too much about these standards in anycase and
particularly so in the Indian context.

How does the standardization by ISO affect us in any case? Can the
government mandate that all organizations shift to using MS software? and
even if they did, will all organizations comply?

I could be wrong, but I don't think it will make much of a difference.

PK

Yes, I am an electronics hobbyist. I etch my own PCBs and have all the
necessary tools. But there are some SMD components involved. I'd like
to have it professionally etched. I'll also try the widely known laser
printer method, if possible.

Yeah. gEDA is pretty popular with Linux.

I dont know if there is any such direct converter available
But my solution will be to exploit IDL of CORBA

Steps are
1. C -> IDL
2. IDL -> Java

idlj compiler is an  IDL-to-Java Compiler which is part of SUN Java SDK
GCC does not have IDL support presently.
I dont know what is the software for converting C to IDL
We have to find an ORB which comes with a C to IDL conversion facility.

IMO C to Java conversion using software is bad.

Completely in agreement with you. I think some overzealous open source
enthusiasts are going overboard regarding the whole issue.

If the standard does not work well, it will just die off! Just getting
it approved by some org might give a temporary advantage but the
market is too smart for such manipulation!

Though theoretically possible, but what will we achieve by converting
a code written in C, optimized for faster execution/maintainability in
C into a OOP platform? My personal experience is that, it is hard to
debug/maintain software generated code. Infact, i have found it
difficult to debug a "reverse engineered" source code in Java. The
original version was written by me.

Cheers,

wikipedia says there may be mapping issues because of java's exception
handling etc
dunno what will be the effects  until we try and see

To set root password, use

$ sudo passwd root

This will fist ask you for the logged in user's password. Later you
are prompted to enter and confirm the root user's password. But as
mentioned earlier, use "sudo" rather than logging in as root.

This won't work. IDL-to-Java compiler is used for generating C++ code from
IDL descriptors. IDL is a language independent way of describing
interfaces exposed by a CORBA server.

If you want to know something about CORBA and IDL, please see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language

Read up a little about RMI - that will give you some idea.

For converting C code to Java, you will most likely need to do it by hand.

Thanks,
PK

Correction:

IDL-to-Java compiler is used for generating *Java* code and not C++ code
from IDL descriptors.

I dint mean the procedure will lead to a complete Java code.
I do know that CORBA is used for distributed computing, making different
software components on possibly different platform to communicate to each
other

For converting C code to Java, you will most likely need to do it by hand.
>

let me be more specific.
C language to IDL conversion will generate IDL module with interfaces.
idlj will create Interface and Implementation skeleton classes.
now we have to implement the interfaces in appropriate classes.
here i am not using the CORBA packages nor registering any references, but
just exploiting the IDL feature.

hope i am clear :)

Are you sure this problem is related to your laptop? You Internet
connection might be to blame as well. Line noise will sever the
connection and the DSL router will try to reconnect on its own. In the
time that you are rebooting you laptop, it might be reconnecting back.
Watch the LEDs on the modem and make sure the LED representing the
remote side of the connection is behaving as expected.

Thanks bro. Yes, the problem was in their ( ISP ) side. Their *full*
backbone is *only* 1Mbps!!! Can you believe that? So, if i went for any
medium type of download or if i tried to load any webpage which is full of
flashes.... line went into grave!!!
Now, i have changed my ISP.

Message-ID: <92f9a9560804130319h6fdd8278t36cc803b44570ee0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have a few PC Engines WRAP x86 boards for sale.  The
hardware is the size of a CDROM, and runs a variety of
unmodified Linux 386 distros (no cross-compilation
necessary).  Ideally suited for Linux based embedded
network servers, data loggers, and other special
applications.

The devices have no moving parts or fans, are exceptionally
reliable and consume 3-5W of power.  These boards are
completely unused and still in their original packaging.

The boards include:
  * 233Mhz AMD Geode SC1100 x86 CPU
  * 128MB RAM
  * Storage using CF card (supports any CF card upto 2GB)
  * 100BT NIC (with Power over Ethernet support)
  * RS232 serial port
  * NO video support, the boards are headless

  * 12-18V DC power supply and CF card not included
     You can get these at your fav Ritchie St. vendor.

More hardware details here:
    http://www.pcengines.ch/wrap.htm

Please contact me *off list* in case you are interested.

I can make special allowances for anyone who will use
this hardware to develop open source applications.

Thanks!

- Raja

This is an update regarding the install fest.

You can see our report at the following URL
<http://www.ilug-tvm.org/content/unofficial-report-gnu-linux-install-fest>

Following is the link to the news article published in Hindu regarding the fest.
<http://www.hindu.com/2008/04/13/stories/2008041352810300.htm>

The response from public was wonderful and the media did their share
to promote the event.

In all it was a grand success and we have been really motivated by the
turnout at the event and the media support.

Cheers
Anoop

	15th April: Candle light vigil for Document Freedom
Message-ID: <3f2beab60804132116t6e80cad0wd9ff68647756d094@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

Recently International Standardisation Organisation (ISO) is approved
Microsoft's broken standard OOXML( with 1000s of Technical Flaws) also
as a Document standard. India's Vote was No to this standard that
creates vendor lock-in and prevents interoperability. Micro$oft played
a lot of nasty games to get the approval from member countries. In this
context we are Conducting a Candle Light Vigil for Document Freedom
Demanding bureau of indian standard (BIS) to appeal ISO's Decision of
approving the banana standard OOXML

Venue : In Front of Townhall, Corporation Circle , Bangalore
Date : 15th April 6.00pm

The programme is planned as a starting point for
various events & awareness campaigns on  Document freedom .

Please use   following wiki page for organising the programme
http://fci.wikia.com/wiki/Campaign_for_Document_Freedom

Also add your name on campaigners section

Why Document Freedom?

We live in an age in which paper documents increasingly get replaced
by electronic records. Document freedom is fundamental for your
documents to outlive the application you are currently using and
allows you to choose and change applications freely.

Previous proprietary document formats have become difficult or
impossible to read within little more than a decade. There is no
reason to believe this trend will not continue if allowed so to do.
Without open standards for our documents we are likely to inflict a
'digital dark-age' on our descendants when they discover that they are
unable to read any of the sources for their history, such as
Government records, acts of Parliament, property title deeds,
scientific research papers, and family histories. They will not
forgive us if we fail to act to protect them now, but instead allow
another generation of poorly specified proprietary standards to become
widely adopted.

Document Freedom and Democracy

Electronic records kept today include records of your government, such
as tax and legal records or minutes of parliamentary proceedings.
Making sure that such records remain in the control of the government
is essential for a functioning democracy. The same is true for all
interactions between citizens and their government, which should never
depend on monopolies or on the proprietary product of a single company.

How to achieve Document Freedom?

Make a stand by saving your documents in ODF today. If your application
does not support ODF, get one of the ODF supported applications like
OpenOffice.org, Staroffice, NeoOffice, KOffice, AbiWord, Google Docs,
IBM Lotus Symphony etc

We request all users to

  1. not send attachments in proprietary formats like .doc, .xls, .ppt
  2. not pollute their friends computers and the internet with
unethically encoded documents.
  3. inform the users that they do not have right to decode the
documents they themselves have written, if they use proprietary
software
  4. distribute open office cds, containing apps with source code for windows.
  5. distribute live cds.

Regards
Praveen

Message-ID: <3f2beab60804142030o40e29946o3099080e04f1625b@mail.gmail.com>

Today's Hindu has a report on Candle Light Vigil and Campaign for
Document Freedom.

BANGALORE: Ever since the International Standardisation Organisation
(ISO) vote on April 2 adopted Microsoft's Office Open XML (OOXML) as a
document standard, techie blogs and websites have been inundated with
posts and articles voicing their opposition to proprietary software
and technical issues with the new standard.

Organisations and online communities ? such as the Free Software User
Group and the Free and Open Source Software ? are looking to raise the
issue more aggressively in the public domain. "We call the OOXML
format a "banana standard." Besides raising awareness, we want the
Government to formulate a policy supporting Open Software and also
appeal the ISO mandate," said Anivar Aravind, a software consultant
who will participate in a rally in front of the Town Hall on Tuesday
to raise awareness about Open Document formats and demand a national
policy on standardisation and use of Open Software.

In simple words, the problem is one of compatibility, an important
issue in this digital world. For example, take the much hyped
e-governance. If the Government maintains its land records in a
certain digital format, and the documentation uses a proprietary
format, then a user will have to keep upgrading his operating system
to access the record. Proponents of Free Software argue that even with
Microsoft's old document format (.doc), a file created seven to eight
years ago may not be recognised by a modern operating systems such as
XP. "This is like being sold a house without being given the key to
it. We need public support to take it to the policy level," says
Venkatesh Hariharan, who was part of a Bureau of Indian Standards
(BIS) committee.

The BIS, which represents India at ISO, had 19 members of which 13
voted against Microsoft's OOXML. Many academics and colleges
(NIT-Calicut among others) have written open letters to TCS, Infosys,
NASSCOM, Wipro (that voted to abstain) and Microsoft (voted in favour
of OOXML). There is a rising fear among academics and advocates of
free software standards that BIS will come under pressure in the
absence of any national policy. Tamil Nadu and Kerala are the only two
States who have a policy in place.

"Very big voices like NASSCOM and Infosys that have not participated
in even one meeting have voted irresponsibly. We fear that if such
lobbying continues, academics and individuals like us will be put on
the defensive, unless there is a policy in place," said Nagarjuna G.,
professor at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, who was part
of the technical committee of BIS. This committee alone identified
200-odd technical flaws in OOXML's 7,000 page document ? the Open
Document Format is 600 pages ? and more than 1,000 others were
identified internationally.

The National Knowledge Commission Report 2006 and the Eleventh Five
Year plan for Information Technology recommend Free Software.

Another classic example of some journalist who knows a little bit about
the issue but not enough to write intelligently on the subject.

How is any file format "not recognized" by a "modern operating system"?
The file format may be tied to versions of the MS Office Suite, but it has
no bearing on the operating system.

Also, the .DOC format is different from the OOXML format.

Hi,

AU-KBC Centre at MIT requires a concern experienced in setting up and  
maintaining LANs to configure it's network and maintain the same. The  
network comprises 175 machines, mixed Linux and windows. There are  
three ISPs for internet connection, firewall server, dhcp server,  
file server, mail server and dns server. These are to be configured  
to route the internet connection with load balancing and failover.  
There are several servers that are running web services on the LAN  
and these are to be forwarded to the internet for external access.  
VPN has also to be set up.

Once configured and set up, there is in house support for day to day  
running of the network under external supervision, but the concern  
would have to give support for one year at the initial period.  
Needless to say, all servers would run linux and free software.

We will pay commercial rates for this. Interested persons may contact  
me offlist.

Another classical Indian. Thanks. How about coming up with something
that common people can understand?

We are at least lighting a candle, think what you are doing?

Both are proprietary formats controlled by Microosft, now the latter
got blessed by ISO, that is the problem here.

Only Microsoft can implement doc format perfectly since only they have
the specs. Similar is the case with OOXML - but even though you have a
spec out there, that is insufficient and you need to pay up Microsoft.

If you are going to write in Tamil, you might want to seriously consider 
writing a column for a Tamil magazine or newspapers that covers the 
subject in more detail. if you aren't aware of all the details, you can 
just ask.

strange - not a single reply. Does this mean that

a. There is no concern in Chennai that does linux network  
installation and maintenance?
or
b. There are such people, but they do not watch this list?
or
c. This is too complicated for anyone in Chennai to do?

Anyway, this offer extends to individuals also - anyone?

1. Find contact numbers of resellers from RedHat India site
2. Speak to them, find out price and other terms, get offer
3. Pay money
4. Take delivery

You are perhaps motivated to do these things. I am not. But I do know
enough about these formats and the discussions behind it to give some
input. I don't think my input is valid only if I hold a candle.

I see a lot of discussions about the OOXML vs ODF in India and most of it
is pretty misinformed.

This is not true. One of the conditions for a format to be standardized is
that it should conform to the Open Specification Promise (OSP) which
allows for products to use this format without any patent disputes arising
from it and without the payment of royalties to MS.

I suggest that you verify this for yourself by looking at the information
about OOXML on the web.

M$ have promised not to sue. But there are two problems here. One is  
that they havent given the list of patents (assuming they have a  
list) and secondly a promise not backed by consideration is not  
enforceable in law. In other words, there is nothing to prevent them  
from breaking their promise and suing

I just bought a 12" Dell Vostro 1200 for my organization. The configs 
fit in your requirement and the cost will fall into some where near mid 
of the  range that you have specified. IMHO dell is value for money.

The difference is that the OSP is effectively a sublicensing of MS patents.

While it is a one-sided Patent promise and while it is true that a promise
without a backing consideration is not enforceable under law, it is
interesting to note that the OpenDocument Format (ODF) is also a one-sided
patent promise from Sun on the same terms:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Specification_Promise

Perhaps I am missing something - I am not a lawyer and since you are,
perhaps you can throw some light on this subject as the licensing terms
from Sun (for OpenDocument) and from MS (for OOXML) seem pretty similar?

Hard disk controller -- ls 1064e

               while we are trying to install open source linux (centos

rhel 5 is supporting. But we are not interest in buy the enterprise edition,
so can you give me a suggestion to install open source with an raid or raid

What raid controller is that ?

Do you perhaps mean an LSI 1064e ? That one is supported in CentOS-5 
just fine.  You need to use the same drivers disk published for RHEL, 
and that will work fine.

Well, consider this - I dont have a machine with that raid card sitting 
here with me. Do you think the info you gave is enough for me to work 
out what is not working ?

I *know* that this card works with CentOS-5 since a few people have 
reported that it does work. If you have reason to assume otherwise, I'd 
be happy to see the steps you took to reproduce the install effort and 
how it failed at what stage. URL's to the downloaded drivers image would 
also help.

sure, send me the server and I can take a look.

I am actually in Chennai. I may not be able to come to Bangalore to speak
on the subject. However, I can post information about OOXML (pros and
cons) on ilugc.

About my own stand on the topic - I believe ODF is a better format and
should have been selected by ISO instead of OOXML. However, the reasons
quoted against OOXML being selected aren't always based on fact. My desire
is to point out these problems.

There are many good reasons why OOXML is an inferior format and shouldn't
have been selected. It is important for those campaigning against OOXML to
get these facts right about both ODF and OOXML and fight OOXML on the
facts rather than being led by emotion or by an irrational/rational hatred
of MS which is common among Linux users.

I think it is also pertinent to look at how this affects India - because
the way things work here in India is quite different from how things get
done in the EU, US etc.

Why are there two different formats: Because Man was developed for BSD at
UC Berkeley, whereas Info was developed for GNU at MIT.

Also: I recommend running info from within Emacs: "emacs -f info", mainly
because it colorizes the headings.

1. Is there any way to colorize the headings without Emacs?

2. How can I tell Emacs to show the Emacs Info page, from the command line?
   "emacs -f 'info emacs'" does not work :-(

Umm. ODF has already been a ISO standard for a few years now.

Given the hubris of hackerdom, and the fact that absolutely everything

a daily Unix Command blog with RSS feed.

Add this to your daily RSS feed aggregator (yahoo widget, gnusticker,

btw, it just struck me that you mentioned RHEL5 while you are trying the 
drivers with CentOS5.1 - you might want to try installing CENTOS5.0 that 
matches RHEL5's installer and kernel. You can get CentOS5 from

From: Rahul Sundaram <sundaram@fedoraproject.org>

>Umm. ODF has already been a ISO standard for a few years now.

yes, I realize that. But though ISO can set standards and ODF is a
standard, whether a format is accepted as a standard in reality by users
(that is, whether it is adopted widely) is dependent on if there is enough
ground swell of support for the format from actual users.

The implication of OOXML standardisation is that it could force
organizations (especially in the US and EU member states) to use OOXML as
a format when dealing with government projects and this will force down
the usage of ODF.

When ISO accepted OOXML as a standard, they did, in a sense, dilute ODF's
chance of becoming a "real" standard. Which is why, if you have noticed
the discussions on the topic, you will notice that the current debate
about the ISO standardization of OOXML is projected primarily as a OOXML
vs ODF competition.

Standardization is not just dependent on grass root support. It depends 
on what Governments choose and that is what people dealing with standard 
bodies are focused on. Too early to speculate on the impact of ISO 
approving two competing specifications but keep a eye on

I just ran into a an example where the 32k limit cause a real-world problem.
Turns out the Ubuntu LoCo Wiki (which runs MoinMoin, which stores files and
folders for each page in the filesystem, rather than in a database) hit this
ceiling, and this prevented any new pages from being created.

I'm curious about why this limit still exists in the 2.6 kernel - it seems
like this is a throwback to some older space-saving mechanism, at least at
first glance. AFAICT all other modern OS's have

I'm going to also hit this limit soon with a media server I'm administering,
and I'm wondering if there are ways around this that people have actually
tried (anything from resetting the limit in the kernel and recompiling, to
hacks in the procfs). Any ideas?

Thanks much.

All you had to do was google for "linux kernel module" and the first few
results would have taken you to:

See the analysis done by lawyers at Software Freedom Law Center
http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/osp-gpl.pdf

They are the authoritative legal opinion of the Free Software
community and they have concluded that you can't rely on osp for a
free software implementation.

Also see their analysis of odf's patent promise to see the difference

If you have any doubt about their bias against Microosft, their
approval of usage of samba/file sharing protocol related documentation
provided by Microsoft for Free Software implementations would clear
that.

I did not say that and in fact I asked you to help the campaign by
helping us create explanations that common man can understand about
the issue. So please help us educate people about this issue, as you
also obeserved the lack of correct information by many.

It is not an easy thing to understand the whole issue, it requires
reading a lot of things and discuss it with others. So please help us
clear the misinformation by creating small fact sheets about ODF vs
OOXML as you seemed to know about the issue. We can discuss those
points here.

This campaign is about educating users about the importance of
document freedom and lighting candle is simbolic and only the
beginning. There is a lot to do and we need all the help possible. It
is a community campaign and every bit counts.

as far as I am concerned, the question is simply: which is better? I  
am not in the business of writing office applications, but am in the  
business of writing web pages - to write a web page, there are two  
phases:
1. write it according to standards
2. break the standards so that IE can read it
3. work around the breaks so that standards compliant browsers can  
read it.

simple

but it would be simpler if steps 2 and 3 could be avoided. But then  
web design might become easy, and people will stop paying web  
designers. Look at this:


Format	Text Color	Text Alignment
OOXML Text	<w:color w:val="FF0000"/>	<w:jc w:val="right"/>
OOXML Sheet	<color rgb="FFFF0000"/>	<alignment horizontal="right"/>
OOXML Presentation	<a:srgbClr val="FF0000"/>	<a:pPr algn="r"/>
ODF Text	<style:text-properties fo:color="#FF0000"/>	<style:paragraph- 
properties fo:text-align="end" />
ODF Sheet	<style:text-properties fo:color="#FF0000"/>	 
<style:paragraph-properties fo:text-align="end"/>
ODF Presentation	<style:text-properties fo:color="#FF0000"/>	 
<style:paragraph-properties fo:text-align="end"/>

as you can see, M$ uses three different syntaxes for text alignment:  
'w:jc', 'alignment' and 'algn' whereas ODF just uses 'align'.  
Similarly with colour. So, as a designer I would definetly go for  
OOXML, because only a real expert can use it, so I get paid more.  
This analysis is taken from here:
http://www.robweir.com/blog/2008/03/disharmony-of-ooxml.html

or take dates: for the last 400 years or so it has been a standard  
that 1900 is not a leap year. Until 00XML came around and created  
1900-2-29 - a non-existent date that needs to be 'pretended' to exist  
for date arithmetic to work. Details here:

http://www.robweir.com/blog/2006/10/leap-back.html

again, as a coder, I would prefer OOXML - more work for me, more pay.

I understand what you are getting at, but the intent in creating a
document standard is not to make it possible for people to create these
documents using just a text editor.

The intent of a standard is interoperability; that is, it should be
possible for software vendors to develop products which can be used to
view, create or modify documents which conform exactly to the
specification that has been standardized.

This is true for other formats as well: Postscript, PDF, SVG or any number
of image formats.. it is very difficult though possible to create
documents conforming to these standards using a simple text editor instead
of a specialized tool, however, that is not the recommended way to
generate these documents.

What makes OOXML more problematic is that some embedded content can be in
patent encumbered formats such as VML etc.

Also, the standard should ensure tool independence - that is, a document
generated using one tool should be 100% usable in another tool which
understands that specification. Here there are issues with OOXML because
of some undefined tags which only MS Office will truly understand or use.

There is this additional problem of binary blobs which are more difficult
to solve. This also makes it difficult to convert documents generated in
legacy formats like .DOC for usage on platforms other than MS Windows. I
will cover this in another email.

PK

Thanks Sundar. I will check with UC Guys and try to include ODOC
also into that.

To tell you the truth, I am quite confused about this stuff because there
are completely contrary legal opinions on this subject. I quote wikipedia
below: (Please see the quote from a lawyer from the Software Freedom Law
Centre who seems to give a completely different take on the subject from
the link that you sent me)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML

<---- Start quote ---->

Several standards and OSS licensing experts expressed support in 2006 of
the OSP. A 2006 article in Cover Pages quotes Lawrence Rosen, an attorney
and lecturer at Stanford Law School, as saying,

"I'm pleased that this OSP is compatible with free and open source licenses."

In 2006, Mark Webbink; a lawyer and member of the board of the Software
Freedom Law Center, and former employee of Linux vendor Red Hat; has said,

"Red Hat believes that the text of the OSP gives sufficient flexibility to
implement the listed specifications in software licensed under free and
open source licenses. We commend Microsoft?s efforts to reach out to
representatives from the open source community and solicit their feedback
on this text, and Microsoft's willingness to make modifications in
response to our comments."

Standards lawyer Andy Updegrove said in 2006 the Open Specification
Promise was

"what I consider to be a highly desirable tool for facilitating the
implementation of open standards, in particular where those standards are
of interest to the open source community."

<---- End quote ---->

So as you can see, the subject is not nearly as clearly defined as either
side of the debate would like us to believe.

PK

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

echo - Display a line of text on the screen

Summary: 

Echo is used to show a line of text on the screen with limited Esc
sequence (BELL, Backspace, H-Tab, V-Tab,...) handling capabilities.

Example:

$ echo  -- Display a empty line

$ echo $HOME -- Display the env variable value.

$ echo -n "No new line" -- Display with-out trailing newline.

$ echo "Bharathi\nILUGC" -- Display the line, as it is.

$ echo -e "Bharathi\n\tILUGC" -- Interpret and show the line

$ echo -e "\033[1;34m ILUGC \033[0m" -- Display with color.

Read: man echo

Well, yes - am really confused! And have no intentions of starting a flame
war - any personal experiences or useful links would be of immense help.

This is my first foray into web-development using Open Source frameworks and
tools and am just not able to decide on the course of action that i need to
take. I did have a brief stint with RoR and like it , but at the same time
TG seems to work fine with business layer (which is primarily in Python);
and I havent tried Django. I havent seen any actual web app written in any
of these(Tg/Django) experiencing a huge load and still remain stable. But it
looks like Guido van Rossum prefers Django (

Hello guys,

I have an idea of creating a forum or some neat website for the linux users
in India to provide information on usage, and other issues related to Linux,
can any one join me in this, any idea on this is invited.

Even if some sites are there i need to make a neat site with all necessary
features so that if some one needs to use Linux in India he should visit
this site.

Use the framework whose programming language you are comfortable with.
If you are comfortable with Ruby use Rails with Python use either of the two.
Knowing the programming language well can help utilize the full functionaility
of the framework. Don't just use any framework because some one prefers it. Use
the one that you are comfortable with.
Fedora uses TG for all their webapps.
Tabblo, Curse Gaming, Washington Post use Django and are very large apps.

If you are planning to go for concurrent users and require transaction
support then
none of the three will fit your bill. And MySQL will not help your situation.
My 2 cents, if a framework bundles a JS Library along with it, I consider it a
deficiency because the user will not have the freedom of choice.

>From my experience of having used Django, I have found it really good.
The documentation
is excellent, the community is helpful and the developers believe in
perfection and
conceptual integrity.

I can't comment on the rest two because I have not used them.

The choice is yours, make use of it judiciously and not on loose talk.

if you have the hardware, django with memcached and perbal can handle  
anything you throw at it. Check this out, especially the portion on  
'scaling'

Thanks for the link. I find "Figure 20-5. An example large-scale Django
setup." in the link to be the fundamental deficiency in the current
architectures. The 'layered' approach or the 'multi-tier' approach is an
architecture thats around for quite some time and does not support linear
scaling.

Thats a good idea, we can have it grouped by distros I suppose.

And for a start we can link to the ilugc archives. Maybe someone (I hope not me) can even index the archives by topic, it will be a pretty good knowledge base I think.

And maybe a Commercial section too, where our members can earn a lots of moneys :)

Even if you manage to fix the issue today by increasing the limit,
you still will come back to the same point when you hit the
new-limit.

You'll have to fix the application and make it split them up into
multiple sub-folders.

If you have 32k entries in a single directory, each 'open file'
would have to iterate through 32k entries. If your media-server is
serving a large base, this could be a problem because the
media-server application has to open these media files quite
frequently.

None of the three frameworks provide true transaction support. They
only try to emulate it (fake it).

For proper transaction support, something similar to J2EE will be useful.

Though in most cases the transaction support shouldn't be a problem.

I guess he mentioned so because of the lack of transaction
support. But, even that I hear is available lately.

even facebook uses this approach and keeps its whole database in  
memory - about 6 months ago that was 200 16gb servers = 3.2 tb of RAM

All the three frameworks do not have true transaction support. They only emulate
them. For true transaction support, probably J2EE is the choice (sic).

But I don't think it should make a difference to most of the projects.

MySQL is not ACID compliant. True it might support transactions lately
through InnoDB but it still lags behind in features like Stored Procs,
sub-queries, triggers etc.

In the queue, there was a delay in his application because of his
Application Manager being busy for an extended duration of time.

I am sure he will get his account in the next run.

Hi,
??? I want to edit encrypted files (gpg files) using xemacs.? I added below line to custom.el file.

(setq crypt-encryption-type 'gpg)

Now, when i create a new file, xemacs asks for Encryption key, before saving the file.? I tried "cat" on the file name and its encrypted.? When i try to edit the same file, xemacs asks for Encryption key, but the buffer is empty without decrypted message.? What have i done wrong?? Or is this expected behavior?? If so, how can i read that encrypted file?


Thanks,

Which is why I'm curious about the reason for the 32k limit - why is this a
hard-coded limit? If it's a type limit (say int16) then it should be a power
of 2, not a nice round number. And if it can be increased, why is it set to
a lower number (a quick test shows me that I can compile a kernel with this
value set to 65k and it works. I have not tried higher since I don't
understand what this limit refers to and what the dependencies are - I'm
just holding off rolling up my sleeves and following the variable in the
kernel).

Also this limit seems to be limited to ext3. My tests on my other hosts [UFS
(on my FreeBSD box), HFS (OSX), NTFS (WinXPPro), ZFS (FreeBSD)]  don't have
this limit, and I'm wondering why other FSs have been able to get around
this problem but not EXT3. Also, the EXT4 header file has the same limit (at
least according to ext4_fs.h).

I've done a bunch of google searches and I can't seem to find any reason why
this limit exists outside of historical space-saving (there was one
reference to the inode count being an int16).

With modern needs (specifically multimedia) these limits seem a bit archaic.
But I'm sure there are good reasons which I just don't know. Perhaps someone
could enlighten me, or at least help me go down the correct rabbit hole?

Are you looking for a alternative Windows GUI frontend to a alternative 
source code management tool?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TortoiseSVN might be useful.

Your question isn't very clear.

So what exactly do you mean by alternative to VSS? A source management 
tool? A GUI? Some kind of IDE integration?

Eclipse has plugins for many SCM's.

Two different kind of SCM's exist. VSS is centralized. Alternatives are:

Centralized
-----------

CVS
Subversion
...

Distributed
-----------

Git
Mercurial
Bazaar
...

Too vague of a rrequirement. You need to tell us what exactly you are

 Comfortable with programing and building a large applications are two
different worlds (or galaxies as I would like to put in). Builiding,
deploying and maintaining large applications requires *lot* of
experiece, patience, an eye for detail and intelligence. Frameworks
normalyy fail to provide the kind of control you need to achieve the
goals.

 Ajax, Mysql , ORM.... looks like you are more interested in building
a buzzword compliant language than an application which works.

>
>  Any 'sincere' advice or hints would be great :)

Ok I have following sincere advices

1) Requirements posted by you are too vague and you can only expect
vague replies. Given the current requirements posted even PHP can
fullfill your requirements.

2) Coming to frameworks you mentioned
 2.1) R0R :- provides you with speed, lots of libraries, completely
buzzword compliant and comes with lots of goodies. Overall one of the
most useless framework I have ever used. Gives you an illusion of
speed of development. Most of the applications Ihave seen developed
using R0R fail to match even the performance of J2EE. R0R eats (or I
shoudl say wastes) lot of resources and forget about distributed
applications.
 2.2) Django :- Very usefull framework when you have requirements
clearly defined. If your requriements or datamodel changes frequently
then not that great of a framework to touch upon. One of the best
frameworks around, if you are buliding application for mature
processes like that of Washington Post. Down side of django is the
over dependancy on ORM. Not only django uses a non standard ORM, it is
next to impposible to make that ORM talk to a distributed db. Another
problem with django might be load balancing, I am not sure if the
chilidish django webserver can handle load balancing. Overall, django
is good for cloased site and monolithic servers. :)
 2.3) TG :- So far so good. TG has some scaling issues reason being
the over dependancy on ORM and some wrong archietectural decisions.
TG is planing to move away fom cherrypy  and go to python paste as the
webserver, saying that porting to cherrypy3 is too much of work for
them. So in the migration to paste, I am sure TG will end up loosing
load balancing capabilities too.

3) Dude, do some research... What you are trying to achive cant be
achieved with one framework or one language. Be ready to use more than
one programing language.

4) Libraries are better than frameworks

5) Postgres is fast enough, standard compliant database, with 20 years
of development behind it.

6) Builiding your own platform is sometimes more useful than using OTSS.

7) Cherrypy 3 is good with load balancing, scales, works with any
database, any tempalting engine and any ORM. Allows lot of flexibility
by allowing you hooks for custom processing.

8) 99.9% ORMs are crap.

9) Ask for more...

 Which transaction are you referring to ? Database transactions have
nothing to do with language and so called bussiness transactions are
nothing more than a workable locking system. Both can be achieved with
any programing language.

the 'childish' django webserver is meant for development. As it can  
only handle one user at a time, only an idiot will use it for  
production. Production sites run on apache, lighty, nginx and what  
have you - load  balancing is done using memcached and perlbal.

  ^^^^^^^

With perl entering the discussion why not consider catalyst framework?

http://www.catalystframework.org/

Disclaimer: I do not have experience in any of the frameworks. However, I am considering catalyst.

I have not programmed with catalyst, but deepofix uses catalyst and  
deepofix has a proven track record. Perl is great, but does not IMHO  
lend itself to collaborative programming where the programmers are of  
different skill levels.

 hehe, do oyu need any other proof of lack of muscle pwer in django. A

my friend, django is a web framework. It is not a web server. It is a  
web framework using LAMP stack. It is not a server. It uses as a  
database backend server, postgres, mysql, sqlite, oracle ... none of  
which are written in python. As webserver it can use apache, nginx,  
lighty - or all three of them, either alone or backed by memcached  
and/or perlbal - none of these are written in python. It uses html,  
css and javascript - again nothing to do with python. It also uses  
operating systems like Linux, *bsd, OSX and windows - again none of  
them written in python. Remember again it is a *framework* which is  
just to use all the elements of a LAMP stack in a more efficient  
manner. Of course, if you are writing a webapp that will only be used  
by one person at a time you can use the django run server which is  
written in python. It is totally flexible in that it can use  
practically any templating language and any ORM, including  
SQLAlchemy. And for version control it can use subversion or git or  
even mercurial (although that is in python). In fact for deployment I  
know a lot of people use that Rails thingie (forgot it's name)  
written in Ruby. And I am quite sure a lot of people also use puppet  
to configure and maintain their servers on which they run their  
django apps. And yes, there are people who use phppgadmin and  
phpmyadmin to look after the databases they run with django (shocking  
isnt it, a python application that uses php to maintain the rdbms!)

If the intention is to later publish it as a regular book also then
consider docbook format. Once done in docbook you can use Norman
Walsh's excellent XSLs to publish it on the web as HTML and also as a
pdf/ps doc using something like Fop.

 I dont want to start a flame war here, so i will limit my response to
two points

1) Going by your answer please differentiate between a "web framework"
and a library ? (and notice the word web here)

2) django provides a way to handle rdbms and people use phpmyadmin etc
instead of built in admin panel out of choice or ease. But django is
not dependednt on phpmyadmin (or any other php  application) to
provide basic services. Databases have native interfaces too which can
be used. OTOH perlbal is something django "needs" to ensure decent
availability (please see I haven't used hig-availability yet).

Subject: [Ilugc] pxe server for multiple machines to boot
Message-ID: <1208610834.3659.77.camel@laptop.censusindia.net>

Hello,

I want to create a pxe-server.
This server will need to store 10 unique configurations for 10 different
machines. Let's say each configuration is in a separate directory on the
server.

I want each machine to pxe-boot from the pxe-server and get the
configuration from its unique directory from the server and accordingly
to get the configured and then the go for the data of the machine.
Getting data can be easily done as the next stage through a script and
that part is fine.

When I have just one config stored on the server, everything is fine,
but cannot get the way for storing and reaching to a unique separate
configuration as per each machine.

Any pointers on how to do that ?

Thanks.

kindly point out frameworks that dont need/use something like  
memcached/perlbal to ensure decent availability. Afaik facebook and  
livejournal also use it.

oops, I did not notice this. This is pure BS. Django has absolutely  
*no* functionality for handling RDBMS. The django admin app is purely  
for entering data. The responsibility for creating and maintaining  
the rdbms lies with the administrator. Django will not create a  
database. Django will not vacuum it. Django will not finetune it.  
Django has some limited functionality for creating tables - but  
preserving the integrity of the data is purely in the hands of the db  
admin.

Same with apache - finetuning and tweaking of apache is again upto  
the admin. Django doesnt do it. Same with the OS - django will not  
tweak the OS.

You may have to look at dhcpd.conf file and tweak
a) option root-path : This tells the server and root file system
                      e.g pxeserver.com:/pxefiles/server1
b) option filename  : this gives the exact pxe file fetch by
                      the client.
                      e.g /tftpboot/pxelinux.0

These can be setup on per client basis using MAC address.

transactional support in the db/sql layer has been available on MySQL for years 
now. I'd agree with you only if your value proposition for 'lately' stretched 
about 7+ years :D

w.r.t Sub-queries, which decade are you living in ?

w.r.t triggers, yea - mysql does not have usable stable released code that does 
do triggers. however, having said that - if you read the OP's email - he 
mentioned a replicated clustered mysql instance for the backend db. Only crazy ( 
or very talented ? ) people use triggers in such an environment. Its very very 
very hard to generate a sane db state if you do. You'll end up building so much 
janitorial code that the whole point of doing a replicated multi head db will 
come into question.

also, your specifics are generic enough to merit building the entire app base on

PXE is only a mechanism to get a tftp boot loop going, which is handled by the 
MAC address of the requesting device. Thats what you need to be looking at.

 Not much, the biggest problem was the long code paths and the app was
consuming double the amount of RAM than current app (written from
scratch in python using cherrypy, dejavu and mako).

Message-ID: <289b5e200804200926k57bacc82h111bb9a8c37065fb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am having a system with 40 GB PATA HDD dual booting with windows xp and
Ubuntu 7.04 using grub installed in its mbr (hd0,0). Now I added a 160 gb
SATA drive and installed ubuntu 7.10 and windows xp in it. By oversight  I
choose the default options, and the grub is overwritten into the PATA disk.
Hence when I boot from the SATA HDD, only windows xp is available. My
intention is not distrub the PATA HDD and to use the BIOS settings to boot
one or the other. Is there a way to move/copy/reload GRUB to the SATA drive
without having to reinstall Ubuntu 7.10? I think it could be done booting
from Live ubuntu CD. I will be glad if someone guides me with the
steps/precautions to follow.

Thanks.

MBR or root partition? MBR would be hd0 and root partition would be
hd0,0

Recently while I was helping out my friend's company that works with
huge databases (the one that I helped him out was 1.5Gigs) that used
MySQL 5.0 with the MyISAM engine, I faced too many issues.

They use MyISAM engine because their work is based heavily on SELECTs
with very few INSERTs. MyISAM has only table-level locking and this
can be a problem occasionally(as I realized during the period). InnoDB
provides ACID-compliance and row-level locking but can be very very
very slow in such a situation.

>  w.r.t Sub-queries, which decade are you living in ?

2008 :) Just try using MySQL with subqueries and see the difference in
performance. While I was trying subqueries on that huge database, it
sometimes took hours for a sub-select to complete when it was taking
minutes as an individual select. So personally, this feature is almost
non-existent!!! Even for smaller databases of the order of 25,000
records, it was taking 8 to 9 seconds. Falcon seems to have a very
neat solution and am looking forward to using it soon.

All major ORMs support sub-queries and they are a real useful feature.
http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/04/sqlexpression.html#sql_everythingelse_correlated
http://www.sqlobject.org/SQLObject.html#subqueries-subselects

Infact, performance wise a sub-query is better than a join.

I personally love to off-load as much to the database than code it in
the web-app. It reduces the head-ache of coding that in your web-app.
Triggers play a very important role (esp in my case, and yes I am
neither crazy nor talented :). MySQL's triggers are still not upto the
level where they can really be useful. Haven't used clustered mysql
instance so can't talk about it.

I am looking forward to MySQL 6.0 which will make MySQL very
attractive. Till then, I am happy with Postgres.

Having built web-apps that deal with large data, I was just giving my
opinion. Before choosing any software esp for a corporates a thorough
study has to be done. A mailing list can only act as a guidance
(sometimes can also have adverse effect).

Forgive me if I any of my remarks have offended you :) And yes, I am
not going to get drawn further into this discussion.

You could try the install CD instead of the live CD. I don't think
the install CD insists on 256MB RAM.

Alternatively, use the Debian etch netinst CD.

# cat /boot/config-2.6.18-6-686 | grep -i netfilter

if the o/p lists CONFIG_NETFILTER=y ... then you  have iptables enabled...

and Debian Etch is having it enabled for standard installation...

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

alias - Create alias name for a command.

Summary: 

alias is Bash build-in command. This is very useful to create a simple
alias for a complex/long/frequent commands. Once alias created, you
can use alias to call the original command. This alias are deleted
after closing the shell session. For the next session, you have create
it again. So to avoid this problem, you add it in your .bashrc file.

Example:

$ alias  -- Prints all alias commands

$ alias cls=clear -- Alias for new user from DOS world.

$ alias ls="ls -F --color=always" -- Alias long ls command.

$ alias mycd='cd a/b/c/d/e/f/h' -- Shortcut for long CD.

$ alias ls -- Print the alias' original command.

$ \ls -- Skip alias and run the original command.

Read: man bash or help alias

Hi,
     You have 2 options.

1. Install GRUB to the MBR of your SATA disk

	a)Boot into the Gutsy Live CD
	b)Fire up a terminal and switch to a root shell, sudo -s
	c)grub-install /dev/sda

2. Change the option in your BIOS to boot from PATA
<You can find it in Hard disk Boot priority under Boot preferences in most
common BIOS setup programs>

Hi, 

Has anyone implemented O/S ticket management system for any companies? 
I am looking for RT [Request tracker] kind of solution which has little
bit of CRM in it. I need some help from fellows who has done this
earlier or 
Passionate to do this kind of project. 

If anyone interested to do customization and integration of RT with
sugarcrm 
 Or use any open source product to fulfill the requirements can contact
me directly. Of course this comes with perks and certificate from the
company.

so, you had issues because you did not know what you were doing ? I am 
responsible for a fair number of lage mysqldb installations ( large by mysql 
terms - in the region of 150 - 180 GB ), and dont have 'too many issues'.

I dont see how that disqualifies innodb as an engine type ?

Thats fud. Innodb for larger sized db's can actually show massive performance 
improvements over myisam, even in read intensive situations. The fact that you 
can tune the innodb resources and index's is in itself a massive advantage 
because you can get it to behave in a manner most suited to your workload and data.

Sounds, to me, like a db schema not done right and/or no optimisation. I can run 
multiple levels of selects from either within proc or on the mysql cli with 
subsecond response times on large'ish db with no issues ( 180GB, in one db 300 
odd tables )

rubbish. sub-q and joins have a small functional interset, you cant just 
generalise something like that.

No, thats fine - your comments dont offend me, Its just that all your opinion 
and most of your comments are incorrect and based on the fact that you dont seem 
to either know much about mysql or use it. You are obviously a pgsql fan, and 
while that is fine - that should be no reason to slag off something else.

I have never tried RHEL, but if it does possess a rescue feature like
Fedora, then I guess it has to be either booting with a Rescue CD or
booting with the first CD with "linux rescue" at the boot prompt,
following which the detected system is mounted in /mnt/sysimage for
you to fix, either by fiddling around in it, or by chrooting in there
and running the commands you want.

HTH. I am not sure if this will work in RHEL, though.

ideally, you should also be raising a support ticket.

http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-5-manual/Installation_Guide-en-US/pt-rescue-mode.html

and

It does. Fedora is upstream for RHEL.

Thought so, but just added a rider since I haven't tried it myself on
RHEL.

This is a generalized question. What if the system crashes suddenly? A
friend of mine called me who is from Windows background and asking me how to
bring back his RHEL Server 5 (His linux admin was on leave that day) ?

He wants to know what is the equivalent of "Last Known Good menu
configuration" in Linux?

I guided him how to do it with the rescue CD but would be willing to learn
if any simple ways are there to accomplish this.

Subject: [Ilugc] Interview with Debian Devleoper from IITM Varun Hiremath
Message-ID: <3f2beab60804220449k33ecf85fq6defb7cf3979aa11@mail.gmail.com>

Which project do you currently contribute to?

I am a Debian Developer and I am currently maintaining about 135
packages in Debian. This is my Debian QA page where you will find the
list of packages I am currently maintaining in Debian:

http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=Varun+Hiremath

Apart from Debian I have been contributing to many open source projects:

1) I am author of open source project python-gastables: python modules
for compressible gas flow calculations: Homepage:
code.google.com/p/python-gastables

2) I am also author of Krickscore - KDE applet for cricket scores.
http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Desktop-Environment/KDE/krickscore-25612.shtml

Homepage: http://varun.travisbsd.org/krickscore.php

3) I have been contributing to Jajuk - Advanced Juke box project,
where I am working as a Developer and Debian package maintainer.
Homepage: http://jajuk.info/index.php/Main_Page

4) I am also currently maintaing pidgin-festival ( formerly knows as
festival-gaim). I rewrote festival-gaim to make it work with the new
pidgin API. Homepage: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pidgin-festival/

How does it feels to have two DDs from neighbouring rooms?

(Kumar Appaiah stays next to my room)

It is a big advantage having him next door because we get to learn a
lot from each other. Usually there is a lot of activity going on in
Debian, and it becomes very difficult to keep track of things; having
another DD next door really helps a lot to catch up with action.

Link to GSoC page? Or to the page where Anant Narayanan and Vivek
Khurana's name have been mentioned?
GSoC - http://code.google.com/soc
Anant Narayanan's name is under PHP and Vivek Khurana's name is under
The Perl Project.
Congrats to all those who made it to this year's SoC.

Fantastic detective work. Unfortunately kg and goldgod are working
in the same organisation in the same team. So nothing unusual in the
the answer by kg.

Like the the time you spent on this work, please also spend few seconds on
a.Giving proper subject line
b.Pruning unnecessary portions in your mail. You are wasting everybodys
  bandwidth

Hi,

I have 2 folders A and B, where B is a backed up folder and both A and
B has the same folder structure. Now at B has received changes over
time and so do A. But majority of files and folders in both A and B
are the same. Now I want to sync these two folders and bring them
identical. If it is between remote machines I can use rsync, but to do
it locally in the same machine is there any commands?

I managed to sync using "rsync -avz -e ssh
stylesen@localhost:/root/A/* .", but curious to know whether some
other command exists :)

What about iso CD?  I have a similar problem with my DVD-RW.  It can 
read any DVD/CD, boot from a bootable CD but will not boot from a 
bootable DVD.

Friends.

I want to create screencasts using linux.

I want to zoom some portions of the screen when required.

For example, see the screencast of "Seek" plugin for thunderbird here,

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

tac -- Concatenate and Print files in reverse order.

Summary:

`tac' copies each file to standard output, reversing the records
(lines by default) in each separately. It is doing the reverse
function of the CAT (TAC) command.

Example:

$ tac myfile -- Print the file (Line by Line) in reverse order.

$ tac -r -s '[^a-zA-z0-9\-]' myfile -- Print the file (Word by Word)  
                 in reverse order, by passing the Regular expression.

$ tac -r -s '.\|' myfile -- Print the file (Char by Char) in reverse 
                            order.

Read: man tac

The subject says it all. But let me provide a little more detail on my
current position. Being a DD is not my goal. But I do want to contribute to
the FOSS world from which I have been borrowing so heavily.

I have been using GNU/Linux for ages now.  I primarily run Xubuntu
Development (Beta), ArchLinux, and I am installing Foresight this weekend. I
am quite good at Ruby, C, and Java. For ages, I have wanted to contribute
and I keep searching for ways to. But ... err ... that is where it ends. Of
late I have chipped in a very small bit. I have started contributing bug
reports for xubuntu. But somehow, doing that alone does not satisfy. I am
entering my third year of Coll this June. so I have ample time ahead of me
to do something concrete. Can some one suggest a way in which I can
contribute?

Good Idea. I suppose tac will be used in places where the first few lines of
a huge file are more significant and you are too lazy to use less ;)

Message-ID: <481021ED.2080802@sifycorp.com>

   Hi ILUGCs,

   I need help in booting from a Live CD Image file which is available in my
   local Hard disk.
   I tried the same way for Linux Installation Image file ( .iso )

   wherein we've to
       -   mount the file into a location
       -   copy the vmlinuz and initrd files to the /boot/ folder
       -   edit the grub.conf file to boot from this boot image
   but in vein. It say no OS is available and temporarily puts me in to a
   shell like prompt. please help me.

   My doubt is, is this process applicable for booting the machine with a
   Live CD Image file ( .iso ) in the hard-disk. If yes, how does it differs
   from the previous one?

   Thanks a lot in advance.

Not really. "head" is good enough in that case.

"tac" is really useful only when you actually need the lines in
reverse order.

The first bug report is not everything. There are follow-ups and
patches, further testing, resolving the report.

Then there is documentation --- lack of which is often a serious bug!

My monitor script will blindly append (>>) the logs to the log-file.
But I have to process logs in reverse order. So just before
processing, i used tac to reverse it.

Hi,

>> doing that alone does not satisfy.
>>     
I really wonder what you mean by "contributing bug reports"? If you mean 
"filing bug reports" then it is not even a full first step contribution. 
Lot of people file bugs, but never file them good enough. A simple check 
would have shown them that similar bugs exist, may be even a fix is 
mentioned. We face a lot of duplicate bugs and a major chunk of bug 
squad's job goes in clearing the duplicates.

Secondly, filing a bug is not important if you are not following it up. 
If you file a bug and leave it, hoping some will look into it, then it 
might not just happen. Often additional information are asked and when 
the reported doesn't respond, it negates the entire purpose of filing 
bugs and eventually you bug becomes invalid without a response.

If you are already doing things right by checking existing bugs before 
filing one, providing as much information as possible, following your 
bugs, etc. then feel free to move to the next level and help out the bug 
squad. We really need more hands to handle bugs from our ever 
increasing  (in size) community. And of course, trying to fix issues and 
offer solutions is another level ;)

Good to hear, I suffered once because of this, my card got charged but the ticket did not get booked. I had to get the money charged back, and go to their counter to book my tickets.

the whole site is badly coded - but it screws up IE as well as  
firefox. In fact this morning first a javascript popup came and I got  
a timed out error. I waited for 30 minutes and found that my 'booked  
tickets' page was blank and that the seat I had tried to book was  
still available. The second time, after entering all details, I got a  
new form from the portal. I clikced on 'help' and again the whole  
thing crashed - but after 5 minutes I got the confirmation mail.

The Skype protocol was never published.  Many have tried reverse
engineering it, and have various levels of success.  Some Skype
plugins exist that can record calls, but most plugins are primarily
Windows only.  Check the plugins section of Skype.com.

A simple work around is to use audacity and grab everything coming
out/in of your speakers/mic.

Call Graph is a program that lets you record Skype calls. It's currently
available for Windows only, but there's a Linux version being developed.

http://callgraph.in/

If you're interested, you can request a preview version of the Linux version
by contacting them through this page: http://callgraph.in/contactus.php

Otherwise, you can use Audacity to record Skype calls. There's a guide over
here, but I'm not sure if the methods mentioned work:

I was about to suggest this. But right now, I do not have access to
any Linux box and so couldn't tell you the steps. I will be installing
Kubuntu HH tomorrow. So, i will be able to give you the exact sequence
of steps over the weekend.

Yay..Thanks everyone! The fun part of actually coding the stuff still
lies ahead.

Big congrats to everyone else who made it. Guess it would be really
wonderful if the other SoC'ers turn up at the next ILUGC meet and
describe what their project is all about. (and of course, sponsor us the
usual maggi and cold coffee)

Hi, I am using RHEL 4 Update 5, the server has 16GB memory and 32GB
Swap. The problem is the system is consuming 95% of the memory, when I
checked the application the total usage was around 7GB, I used the pmap
-x <pid> command to check the memory utilization of each process and the
total was aroung 9GB. I am not sure what happen to the remaining 7GB. I
tried vmstat cmd and found that around 5.8GB was in inactive and 8.9GB
in active mode and only 720MB is free. 
 
What is the inactive memory and how to reclaim this memory.

Linux uses the free memory to create IO/File buffers.. As long as the 
swap is not not being used, you are not exceeding the amount of memory 
present.

Hi Vaidhy,
			Thanks for reply, the problem is the application
users are trying to add some functionalities but they are unable to do
because of the unavailablity of memory. The application checks for
available free memory before installtion. My swap is 0% utilized. But
why should the OS hold 5.8GB memory in inactive state.

I don't believe this. Do you mean to say that people are willing to  
let other people answer on their behalf? I do not think any  
mailserver would have this option. However the simplest way is either  
to give the password to the other guy, or forward all mail to the  
other guy leaving a copy in the original guy's inbox.

These two are not the same thing:
 a. Send a mail as someone else (SMTP Auth)
 b. Read mail sent to someone else (IMAP Auth)

As far as I know mail servers like exim4/postfix for SMTP
and dovecot/cyrus for IMAP support SASL for Authentication.

SASL authentication allows user A to be authenticated and then
authorized as user B. 

You can think of it like "sudo" where user A gives user A's password
to sudo and is thus permitted to do some work as user B (usually B is
root!).

I can't help you more since I have never used SASL myself! :-(

Regards,

Kapil.

No Some critical situations there.. !!!
The Admin delegates some of his responsibility to other administrators. Or
the manager wants his assistant to screen his email and handle routine
items,

due to my knowledge the MsExchange will do (sorry to highlight M$ here, but
i would like to make it in Linux)

Subject: [Ilugc] how to access  two webservers behind firewall ?
Message-ID: <930221.64156.qm@web7604.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hi Luggies,

Is it possible to  access externally two web servers which are running different nodes behind the firewall ?

I am using shorewall.In this I can DNAT only one webserver,
For this the code is as follows,
DNAT       net   loc:192.168.0.20:80  tcp     80
DNAT net      loc:192.168.0.20 tcp     www

To access the webserver which is running on other node (192.168.0.1),

I tried as  follows 
DNAT       net   loc:192.168.0.1-192.168.0.20:80  tcp     80
DNAT     net      loc:192.168.0.1-192.168.0.20 tcp     www
but in vain.

I also tried with one webserver's port as 81
For this the code is as follows,
 DNAT       net   loc:192.168.0.1:81  tcp     80

Could you give a suggesstion please ?

 

Thanks & Regards
MThanigairajan

how about using a Reverse proxy on a thrid webserver??? You can use
Apache HTTPD as a reverse proxy.

All your requests will now be routed through the third webserver.

PS: May be I am replying at a different level. Am talking at
Application layer level and your question was at Network layer level.

Forgot to mention: All single sign on middlewares such as Access
Managers (Tivoli access manager, SiteMinder, etc...) also work as
reverse proxies. So you can implement better application security
using a Reverse Proxy, in addition to the network security....

Will not work unless you've DNAT round robin/ load balancing. Some  
routers support this. However, this assumes all webservers are running  
the same site else one would get sites at random.

This will redirect all calls on port 81 on the public side to port 80  
on the .1 server. The user must give the url http://host.domain:81

Check contents of /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes.  This file
lists the size of "free" memory the system must always preserve
in case RAM is needed urgently (think device driver buffers).

Setting it to a higher value will "free" up more RAM so you
can install your application.  Eg. to free up 2G of RAM use:

echo `expr 2048 \* 1024` > /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes

Do **not** make this setting permanent on a production box.

Do **not** set a very high value for this setting as it may cause
out of memory errors and kill running processes (esp mysql).

Needless to say, don't run this on a production box without
careful analysis.


Unused memory is wasted memory, so Linux uses nearly all
unused memory to buffer various things (files, VM pages, etc).
The kernel automatically reduces the size of the buffer cache
whenever applications require additional RAM.  A few MB of
memory is typically kept free to ensure that urgent demands
of RAM by device drivers during DMA operations, etc can
be serviced immediately.

See the contents of /proc/sys/vm/* for how you can tune your
VM behavior.


This test for free memory in your application installer is legacy
behavior and will fail on nearly all modern OSes.  It's time
to file this as a bug report with your software vendor.

I am using wordpress MU and in that for each blog, there is a new
sub-directory created..

I wish, Linux should remove this limit just like we can have any number of
files in a folder..

Today, with surging storage space, this 32k limit is very restricting.

Hi,

I was considering such FOSS lab in my village.  We ran a computer shop 10
years before, and we now have around 3-4 P2 PC's.

I enquired with some persons, and found that there is a Think Client PCI
card, which we can use in old PC's to make it a thin client.

Some interesting fact (although not verified) was proposed.

   the old pc contained 3 PCI slot, and hence the person told, we can create
three thin client machines, with one old PC and 3 monitors using that PCI
card.

Now i have the following question?
1. If we are buying new machines, why should we go for Thin client, as
hard-disk costs only 2000 now.
2. IF we go for thin client, do we need any special hardware apart from the
PC's?
3. Is it really possible to establish thin client by sing the PCI card?
4. Is it possible to setup three thin clients, in the same PC?

Regards,
Senthil Raja

I had an interesting experience to share.  i was very enthusiastic and
proposed setting a computer center for the labourer's nearby.  But the
sponsors raised the following question.

1. The purpose of the training center is to make the people employeable.
Will training on open source source softwares like openoffice create any
employment for them?
2. They are not going to learn technical stuf.. They will learn what is
required in the market..


I have no answer for this, as i am sure, none of the business offices use
open source softwares.

Just wanted to share with you all.

1. The purpose of the training center is to make the people employeable.
Will training on open source source softwares like openoffice create any

In linux this is called multi-seat. Put PCI-VGA card for monitor out, add usb keyboard and mouse for every additional set. No special hardware is required.

However, on old hardware performance may not be good.

It is not only hard-disk cost. If you setup LTSP(Linux Terminal server project), the benefits are
a) No hdd cost
b) Low power cpu on clients - celereon
c) If pxe booting is supported by mother board, no need for
    cd drive, fdd etc
d) Less maintenance, HDD, cd-rom failure are very common
e) Less RAM on client
But you need one decent PC with atleast 512MB of RAM.

With ltsp you don't need anything special.

Yes, it is called multi-seat in linux.

I am using a P-100 purchased in 1997 as thin client even today.

For more details look at ltsp.org, multi-seat page in wikipedia.org

I used to be active around here, attend meetings, grab goodies, have
endless hours of fun installing Debian 'potato' and flaming innocent
people for having used the term 'Linux' instead of GNU/Linux. ;)

Thought i'd drop back in and 'catch up' with  ILUGC and say a general
off-topic 're-hi' to all the folks that might be able to recollect me
and a hi to all those who are totally unclued about what this mail is
all about :)

Glad to see (from the archives) the meetings still happen at IITM.
Even if I don't happen to have anything useful to add, I'd like to
drop in sometime for my own selfish nostalgia's sake :) Or, wait...
I'm sure things haven't changed so much that I'm not allowed to hire
for Yahoo!, is it? :)

A request to the webmaster:

http://www.chennailug.org/rms-chennai.txt now throws a 404. This used
to be the Transcript of the speech given by RMS at MIT, Chromepet. Can
you please put it back? You can find a copy of it here:
http://www.mksarav.org/rms-mit-chennai-13mar2002.txt .

... oh and the FAQ is mighty out-dated. Who uses SiS 6324 cards these
days, anyway? :)

Speaking from my experience as running a company, it is very, very
unlikely that I will consider anyone for a job just because they know
openoffice. There are literally thousands of unemployed degree holders out
there who are always applying for work.

I am not trying to discourage you, but you should perhaps think a bit more
about the type of work that you are preparing these people for. I have
done a bit on my own along similar lines and therefore I include my
thoughts below:

You need to decide what type of jobs you are going to be preparing these
people for. If it is secretarial type of work, then you need to teach
them:

a) English - most places will require this
b) How to answer the phone professionally
c) How to welcome people in the office and behave professionally in an
office environment
d) How to dress professionally
e) Handle people coming in for appointments or seeking appointments etc..
f) How to write a professional letter
g) Usage of fax, email, usage of yellow pages etc
h) Fast typing
i) Basic accounting
j) How to find information on the web
k) .... and many more.

Knowledge of openoffice or MSOffice will be essential but you will need to
see this within the context of all the responsibilities a job like this
would entail. Preparing someone to use a computer is only a very small
part of the job.

Also, it really helps to have these labourers join an open university to
start on some degree as most places these days will require that. Also, it
will help if someone can start a bank account in their name for them so
that they can get used to using a bank account, an ATM card, saving money
etc.

It is a real uphill battle for the poor to join the mainstream. They will
need all the help they can get. I thank you for starting this initiative.

Regards,
PK

Since Firefox 3.0 requires GTK 2.10, it will not run on Debian Etch
<http://www.captain.at/howto-run-firefox-3-debian-etch.php>. So, I have
downloaded and shared Firefox 3.0 and its Debian Etch dependencies at
<http://10.94.15.194/firefox-3.0/>.

But after installing GLib with a prefix, when I try to install Pango, it is
unable to locate GLib. How do I tell Pango the location of GLib?

Here is a short write-up on how to run the latest unstable software
under Debian stable w/o disturbing the existing configuration.

(I don't know if Firefox 3 is in unstable or experimental or even in
Debian at all, so YMMV!)

Hi! all

 I managed to get hold of India specific stats for GSOC 08 and updated
the list at http://fci.wikia.com/wiki/SoC/2008 . This is student stats
only and mentor stats are not clear yet as some mentors are backup

 In case you have visited the above link, please visit again for the

Forgot to mention, the above address is intranet-only and is not accessible

You can encrypt the secret part of the mail using the PGP/GPG key of
the person who is supposed see that part.

The other person may object to your filling the mail with unreadable
junk.

If /boot is a separate partition then you have to delete it also.

You can install by choosing the partition on which mandrake was installed - in which case you need not delete. If /boot is separate and if you didn't remove it you may have to edit menu.lst file of grub - /boot/grub/menu.lst to remove mandrake entries.

you are mentioning it to be labourers. so they are already employed.

we train people to use free softwares which will in turn increase the
efficiency of their existing business/ work or what it may be. it need not
necessarily generate employment just as learning to ride a bike, car do not.

i learnt to drive a bike not to charge everyone whom i give lift but to take
to me from t nagar to royapettah etc., etc.,

Subject: [Ilugc] Bringing FLOSS to Everyday Academic Life
Message-ID: <c9ea6e770804261107y2a6b443dgb3522a6d47d668f2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I had this idea of Bringing FLOSS software to every day life of colleges.

Most of the engineering colleges dont even have a mail server, and there are
not proper IT staff to guide the college management.

When some of my cousins recently approached me for some academic project, i
was little bit confused, on how to guide them.  They dont know even what a
web server was..

So, i enquired about some details like, individual computers for their
staff,  mail servers, Internet connection etc.

I proposed some very simple projects to them, which i have listed below.

1. Setup a mail server, and configure the mail client to use it.  Then
demonstrate to college management, and finally setup this for them to use.

2. Use blogs (wordpress) for college communication, from principals &
HOD's.  Blogs is a powerful medium, and important announcements, circulars,
communications can be posted on the internal blogs.

3. To setup a Wiki, to manage information, and documents.  (Media wiki is
under consideration as of now).  This will act as a central place for all
informations, like department schedules, syllabus, subject contents etc.
Any information could be managed in wiki.  Usage is limited to imagination.

4. An online course management software.

The purpose behind is to make the academic people to realise how FLOSS
softwares can be used in their daily life to easily manage things.
Once they tasted the benefits of these softwares, then there will be more
curiosity to manage other activities through intranet.

For example, issue management, leave management, etc.  The students will
have the practical knowledge of these softwares.

This would ultimately empower both the staffs and students to customize
these softwares to their requiremnts.

The motto is that only if we bring FLOSS to daily use, not only in personal
life, but in our work and academic environment, we would have the inherent
vision to further take it to next level.

By next level, i mean, setting up data centr, taking up internal project
using the students etc.

Imagine, if atleast half of the colleges can setup data centre, it will
usher a new wave of IT revolution..

Note:
Since its exam time, i could not start this initiative.  Once its over by
mid of may, i will start teaching them the basics of FLOSS, and train them
in technologis like Apache configuration, MySQL, PHP etc, that they would
practically put in to use.  I thought of going for java j2ee, but, i
thought, when they dont even know what a webserver is, it would be difficult
for them to grasp higher concepts.  So, PHP would be simple and good start
for them.

Depending on the outcome, i plan to form a team in their colleges,
comprising of students from 2nd year to final year, so that any project they
take, would have the continuity, as new batches would join, when the final
year batches go out.

Please share your opinions on this.

Regards,
Senthil Raja

My vote would be to make this '1' (assuming you ordered them by priority).

I think they can easily grasp simple programming concepts and it is
definitely good to introduce them to programming. Once they start
programming, they tend to develop the inquisitiveness to find out how
all the applications that they work with are built. So, IMO, getting
them started on programming is important. I'd definitely vote against
PHP :) Its a bad way to start programming ;)

 I think the total number of Indian GSoC students this year, is
between 75-80 but as I mentioned earlier some students did not mention
the location properly or some students did not mark the location on
the map, making it difficult to judge if the student is Indian or not.
But we are waiting for official stats from google.

Message-ID: <72288b670804262254m136ba3aauf23b9bcf380dc6c7@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

My box (AMD Athlon 3200+ 64-bit; Asus A8V-MX; 80 GB SATA HDD) was running
Gutsy. I downloaded the Hardy alternate-cd iso and loop mounted it to
/media/cdrom0. I then did, gksu sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade.

The update manager finished the update successfully and I was to restart.

However, on restart I got a (initramfs) prompt. I looked up this problem on
ubuntu forums and found that i had to add pci=nomsi as a boot option. This
works fine and I'm typing this mail from Hardy.

My question is, can someone explain what pci=nomsi does? I did try google,
but in vain. Besides, why did I have to add it if it wasn't required by
Gutsy?

Thanks,

Our Engineering colleges are not like companies/industries to get advice/support from a IT staff.  The
colleges IT infrastructure is almost maintained or in control of IT vendors / suppliers who don't
let anything to be installed apart from the regularly used copyright softwares 
(This is the every day life of colleges I am seeing in the engineering colleges).

My experience with engineering college students was even worse, many of them have never seen
Linux GUI desktop at all and almost all of them have used linux in their colleges in one of their Semesters.  

This is how they use Linux in colleges.  

Boot using M$ Windows OS -> Run Telnet <ip> -> Connect to Linux Server -> Get Black Window -> Open Vi Editor -> Compile using cc -> Run Linux Programs = Linux in Engineering College Labs).

What they all know about in Linux?

* A Windows machine with Telnet command is required to connect a Linux server
* Login with given user name and password
* Get into some shell (not worried whether it is /bash or /sh)
* Open Vi editor
* Use cc to compile the `C' program (look, not gcc)
* Execute and see the output of the program

This is the situation at present we can see in many engineering colleges how the students have been using Linux.

All the above ideas looks really great, but practically it would be very hard to 
explain these things to college managementt and make use of these FOSS tools for effective use.

In the past recent months, I have started discussing with few Engg. college HODs, Principal, Secretary,
Directors, Chairman and Management people about the importance of emerging FOSS technologies and its
wider usage in industries and governments increasing day-by-day and if academia fails to implements these things
in education, then a wider gap would exist between Academic and Industry.  After long and 
strong discussions  I have got some positive reponses from them.  Now few engineering colleges have
accepted our proposal to setup a complete Free / Open Source Software Lab (we have already setup 2 labs in Polytechnics this April) which could be used by students/staffs effectively in learning the new FOSS technologies in time.

We are looking for similar minded people who can join in our initiative to promote FOSS in education.

Why do they need support from outside? Most academic places where
GNU/Linux is extensively deployed depend on the competence of their
own staff.

Here are two possible reasons why they depend on external sources:
 a. The academic people are not interested. They see no added value
    from learning about managing systems.
 b. The students are not trusted by the authorities to help with the
    IT infrastructure.
The LUG can do very little about (b) but it will help if we can do
educate people about the value of learning about systems.

Which is not to say that they are very competent with the proprietary
software packages which they install!

Hey! Don't knock this method of learning. I learnt things this
way. Except that I used DOS rather than Windows. In those days most
machines were XT's and could only act as dumb terminals to the *one*
386 we had running GNU/Linux. (Yes! I am that old!)

I think the original poster's ideas are good as long as they don't
forget the hands-on instructional component.

Even in IMSc, which is virtually a complete GNU/Linux environment, we
continually face pressure to "let the vendors handle it" and we know
what that means.

Kapil.

Isn't this more a sysadmin / network admin job than
being a project? Sure, they'll learn a lot in this,
but don't colleges appoint admins for their networks?
If they do, won't there be a resistance to switch to
FLOSS, assuming, their current setup is under Windows?

This sounds to be a fantastic idea. But, there'll
probably be more mis-use of it.

Supplements the second idea.

Will this be used?

True. But one needs to get opinions (and acceptance)
from in-house governing members within a college.
Strong affinity towards a change in use of computer
software from students of the college, is a more
important aspect.

A lot of whom I have met in the FOSS community (not
many) recommend Python over most other languages.
Python tends to enforce some standard practices
(comments, indentation, etc.) and therefore, is
probably considered to be good for beginners. However,
I have been used to the typical (if so-called)
learning of C -> C++ and then to Java. 

(Though I don't really think about C++ after being
into Java; and C is something, that I usually
recommend, though it may not be suitable for
beginners)

> Please share your opinions on this.

I would like to add a case study (not significant
enough, though) which I consider a small achievement. 

Our course content demanded that practical be
conducted using the GCC compiler, along with a custom
supplied Library (called shmlib.h) for Parallel
Programming, typically illustrating Shared Memory
Programming. 

I managed to pull in a few guys to get started (since
we did not have instructors for the practical
sessions) with programming under a Linux distribution.
Unfortunately, we didn't have machines installed with
a distro. I had to request my course co-ordinator to
install some Linux distribution so that we could
begin. Some were configured without the X-window
system, and some were with the X-window system (more
aplty, X.org). Though I thought of recommending
K/Ubuntu, I knew most of them don't come pre-installed
with GCC, and acquiring an internet connection on a
computer was more difficult, since most mis-use
bandwidth.

When a few of us managed to start programming, other
students (who were /supposed/ to perform the
practical) also joined us. My course co-ordinator
noticed this, and asked me if I wanted more computers
installed with Linux distributions for practising. 

Later, we had a mini-lab setup with four computers
(without internet, for obvious reasons) with Mandriva
Linux 10.1 with KDE 3.3.x and ICEWM setup as window
managers / DE. 

In short, it is almost like a 60-40 of investment of
resources from students-collegestaff to take FLOSS to
the next level.

I assume, NRCFOSS has done quite a bit in Chennai,
West Bengal and Rajasthan for introducing FLOSS in
academics. You might want to co-ordinate and help them
in their efforts.

Subject: [Ilugc] xwindows applications through putty?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0804271630050.8150@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,
I have access to Linux server and xapplications.
I need to access them through MS-windows-XP machine(no advises to use
Linux as this is the way my office works)  ;)

I tried in google for open source tools  and the results were not
satisfactory. Either, size is too large or comes with pricetag.

The question is,
Through putty(using X11-forwading option) can I access the x-applications
in the Linux server(without additional softwares)?. This will I be able to
do, without any additional software like hummingbird or x-manager like applications.?

If not so, is there some small open source application(s) which I can use
for accessing these x-applications.?

Thanks & Regards,
carti

You need to have some kind of X server running on your Windows
machine if you want to run X applications remotely.

Here is an alternative approach.

1. Start a vncserver on the GNU/Linux side. This will give you
   a port number like 59xx in its output. 

   This is a virtual X server which "draws" to memory and outputs
   this drawing to port 59xx. It also accepts vncevents over the port
   and converts them to Xevents for the server.

2. use putty to connect to the GNU/Linux machine and forward 
   a port something like
   	local port: 5901
   	remotehost: localhost (this is localhost at the remote end!)
   	remoteport: 59xx (same as above) 

   This is just a tunnel connecting your machine to the GNU/Linux
   machine. This step is only required for security of the data
   being sent.

3. Download and install a vnc viewer for windows and start it. When
   it prompts for a port and host give 5901 and localhost.

   The viewer takes the data coming from this port and draws it. It
   also converts local keyboard and mouse activity to vncevents and
   sends them over the port.

This should work reasonably though it may feel like watching a badly
recorded VCD at times.

Regards,

Kapil.

Sorry, but this is OT. you might want to as the Indian TeX users'
group at tugindia@tug.org [1]

But, in any case, MiKTeX is what you want [2]. Did you try it?

This is truly sad!

It is partly based on mis-information. How does one find a person who
can maintain a "MicroSoft solution for mailserver" *properly* but
cannot maintain a "Linux Mailserver". It is like saying this mechanic
can only fix punctures on Fiats and not Ambassadors! (I use that
analogy since that is the amount of maintainence that a mail server
requires---some periodic puncture-fixing).

Of course, it may be true that *setting up* the mailserver under
Linux *used to* require more work than the click-clack-cluck under MS.
However, can one really trust one's mail to a person who cannot
read/understand/edit configuration files?!

Apparently most IIT students are also no longer interested in
"hacking" (as in tinkering with computers), they just want the latest
video game/mobile gadget and be cool! Ah, the good old days! (/me ducks) ;-)

Regards,

Kapil.

they have an AMC with some company to maintain the mailserver - from  
a recent experience of mine, I can certify that there is no company  
in Chennai that has the pre-qualifications to bid for an AMC to  
support a mailserver - or to support any type of linux server/ 
networking solution. This is a huge opportunity for any company  
courageous enough to try this out. It may be noted that Bangalore and  
Mumbai have several companies who can do this.

This is only partly true. The faculty mail service as well as the
proxy authentication server is Windows based. However, student mail
services are based on GNU/Linux (who wants to spend lakhs or crores
for the huge number of students?). And, I daresay, student e-mail
services are quite adequate and useful, though most people use GMail
addresses.

I think it has to do more with the institute not being able to recruit
talented sysadmins, especially given that the payscales are far from
attractive.

Untrue, at least as a generalization. There have been several attempts
by students to get neat stuff going wherever possible; for example,
some second-third year students have made wonderful new websites for
some clubs in IITM [1], [2]. But all this has been done after several
requests to the CC to install requisite software on systems
etc. Students are not entrusted with administrative tasks for fear of
misuse of rights (justified to an extent), so even though students may
be there to help, it really doesn't happen...

Sorry. No simple Projects. We will do only IEEE Project in 2 months.  
(bcoz that is only available as the off-the-shelf product) ;)

Actual issues are 

1. Chicken and Egg problem. Staff wants management to take decision.  
So that for any issues they can blame management and Esc. Management
thinks in another way. So legacy continues ...

2. Most of engg colleges are having huge money and thinking of buying

$ watch -n 6 who -- Every 6Sec 'who' run and list the current users

$ watch -d date -- Highlight the difference b/w successive updates

$ watch /sbin/ifconfig eth0 -- Watch the traffic on eth0 interface.

$ watch "/sbin/ifconfig eth0 | grep bytes" -- Watch RX/TX bytes.

$ watch "/sbin/ifconfig; date" -- Watch multiple commands.

This is the trend. No one sets up their own data services anymore.

	Mail server	GMAIL et al.
	Web server	Myspace et al.

	Documents	Google docs et al.
	Software	Sourceforge, Alioth, et al.
	....
	Life		Second Life
(OK! So the last is a joke. :-))

It is not clear that this is necessarily a bad thing from the point
of view of wide adoption of FLOSS.

After all, if this is all that people need from the computer, then any
networked device will do just fine, so embedded devices with Linux
under the hood will do just fine. Look at the success of the EEE Pc.

However, it may[*] be bad from the point of view of getting people to
start thinking (about what goes on) inside their boxes.

It is also bad from the point of view that people should have *more*
control over their own data in order to be free.

its warranty --- quite unlike an iPhone!

I understand that the software would need to learn my pronunciation and

All I find if I do a web search is software that has been discontinued.
  Any pointers would be appreciated.

There is work going on the Sharika project. It won't do all the fancy
stuff yet. It just can currently  recognize some command and perform
actions based on that.

  I feel, this trend is not welcome..  Academics are not consumers..  They
need to do research and pioneer in key technologies..  How can we be self
reliant on technology, if we outsource everything to google, blogspot etc.

I think, it damages the skills availability of FLOSS in india..  Already, we
are just consumers of FLOSS..

A car that we make from our own effort in our backyard is thousand times
worth than benz..


I strongly, feel, that as long as we take an independant track, we would be
only consumers of technology for ever..

How can the students learn all these, if everything is outsourced.  Atleast
there should be some pilot project, involving the students guided by the
staffs..

I am surprised, if its teh case even in Anna University, the situation would
be far worse in other engineering colleges..

What is the use of knowledge obtained in colleges in universities, if it
cannot be applied for their own requirement?

There is something wrong with our setup itself.

people should be willing to learn - for example you are not willing  
to learn list etiquette and keep top posting. It is the same with  
these other people, they do not want to do new things. They simply  
continue to do what they have done before.

I was about to suggest sphinx also.

For commercial apps, you may consider LumenVox, they are reputed to be good. i myself am going to get a few licenses from them very soon.

Cygwin has both ssh client and an X server available. Just select ssh and X
server in the Cygwin installation. Log in to the Linux machine with the "-X"
option specified on the ssh command line. Make sure the Cygwin X server is
running on your Windows machine. Enjoy.

actually cygwin is a big software.....actually intended for emulation.
If you just want to tunnel X11 connections...use Xming with putty......very
light weight and works perfectly...

In such situations, I have successfully survived with Cygwin and its X 
port / package.

Download cygwin, install it and then start X and then ssh to your box 
and start your X app.

It doesn't look like Lumenvox would work for what I want to do. 
Dictation is specifically called out as not optimized.

http://www.lumenvox.com/resources/tips/HowLVsoftwareUsed.aspx

Now, let?s discuss the applications that LumenVox speech technology is 
not optimized for:

Dictation Software

Dictation software allows a user to speak or ?dictate? text directly 
into an application (ex. Microsoft Word, etc.). Often times the voice 
input is through a microphone connected to a PC, but sometimes dictation 
applications can occur via the telephone.

One common use of dictation software is medical transcription. Doctors, 
nurses and medical personnel can dictate their notes and have them 
transcribed using speech recognition technology into text. This removes 
the need of a human transcriber, and saves time and money for a doctor?s 
office. This software also addresses the ?bad handwriting? liability 
that many medical personnel face.

Dictation software improves in accuracy by having a trained user and 
also after ?learning? the user?s voice and pronunciations of certain words.

Desktop Software

This type of software enables PC users to navigate their computer by 
using their voice, instead of the keyboard. This software can be 
especially useful for the blind or people with repetitive strain 
injuries that prevent them from using a keyboard. However, anyone can 
use this software, as speech truly is the most natural interface for 
many useful devices.

I'm still a bit amazed that the jury could return a verdict of
premeditated murder in case where it isn't yet proven that
the victim is dead, and there was little evidence of
premeditation other than some emailed threats (not
unlike Usenet flames).

Hans Reiser must look like an utterly disagreeable person
to most reasonable persons, regardless of whether he
comitted the murder or not - though my instinct tells me
that he committed an impulsive murder (not premeditated),
and then bumbled around looking for ways to dispose off
the body, finally strapping it to his car seat and dumping
it in a lake or reservoir somewhere, then came back and
tried to erase any evidence of his actions.

P.S. There's no death penalty in California for this
conviction, but he's effectively out of circulation for
good.

You seem to be using a age-old distribution, RH 9.0
and I would recommend switching to a higher version. 

If the hardware limits the upgrade, you can look on
freshrpms.net or http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/ to get
rpms. I'm not sure, yum will work on RH 9.0 as
intended.

Not really. Only a specific few pages have been messed around with.
There is a lot of valuable stuff (tips, etc.,.) which are untouched.
These do sometimes show up on web searches and I'd prefer to have the
wiki cleaned up (semi-automatically + volunteers doing the rest of the
job) to being deleted.

Hi,

Thank you very much. When compared to cygwin and other options, I found
the xming + putty option to better suit my need(small memory footprint and smaller size in installation).

Note that "df /mountpoint" and "df /mountpoint/subdir"
will always give the same output since "df" is for "disk free"
and not "disk usage". If you want to know actual usage of 
/mountpoit/subdir you should use "du /mountpoint/subdir"

server and even after rebooting, after two days, the memory consumption
was 95%, still the application usage was only 2GB out of 16GB. Is there
any buffer overflow or some kind of issue.
The kernel is 
[root@linux ~]# uname -a
Linux linux 2.6.9-55.ELsmp #1 SMP Fri Apr 20 16:36:54 EDT 2007 x86_64
x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Can you explain a bit about the inactive memory in "vmstat -a -S M"
output. Why should the OS keep it inactive. When the application usage
itself is only 2GB what is the OS doing with the remaining memory.

Any suggestions on fixing the issue.

Check contents of /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes.  This file lists the
size of "free" memory the system must always preserve in case RAM is
needed urgently (think device driver buffers).

Setting it to a higher value will "free" up more RAM so you can install
your application.  Eg. to free up 2G of RAM use:

echo `expr 2048 \* 1024` > /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes
