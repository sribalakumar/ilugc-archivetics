Awesome person I met at the Kovai Geeks Mediawiki workshop a while

For the past one and a half months, I am with the MediaWiki. I try
solving bugs, I used to learn, collect information, talk to people in
Wikimedia and I be with Mediawiki for about 10 hours everyday.I used
to read the appeals form Wikipedia authors about the donation.
Everyday i used to read and close it. I did not contribute anything
from my part. Few minutes back while working, something made me to
think why I still haven't done anything to Wikimedia Foundation even
though I am so much interested in this. Next minute I clicked the
donation amount of Rs. 500 and contributed to Wikimedia Foundation. We
spend so much each and everyday, why don't we contribute something to
Wikimedia when we gain something useful from it. Think about it and do
your part :-)

Iswariya Ramesh.

Exactly. Whatever be the reason, Microsoft has a really good office suit.
Or in other terms, most people have grown accustomed to it. If they make a
linux version and make it a Pay App at the Ubuntu Software Centre, I think
Microsoft has got themselves a piracy proof method to sell software.

It is not. But atleast more people will be willing to pay for it.

@Kenneth,

I find it surprising because, there are lots of people ( who would
otherwise switch to linux)  stuck with Windows just because they can't
run office on Linux. Mac is expensive. Linux alternatives are not good
enough for them due to their familiarity with MS software. Would this
not be a major blow to Microsoft OSes?

the future is in mobile and the tablet market - and most devices have
already ditched microsoft. Linux adoption (especially in the government
and - corporate sectors - which are the only sectors that pay for
software) is growing. To survive, microsoft needs to have a go at this
market.

Why Not? Apple's app signing is a good example for piracy proof way of
using a AppStore to distribute software. If Ubuntu goes the same way with
its paid apps, why can't MS get a piracy proof method?

http://developer.ubuntu.com/publish/licence-key-infrastructure/ -> tells me
there already a License infra to felicitate this.

Dear Wikipedians.

Wish you all a great and joyous 2012.

The new year is probably a good time to kick off a new initiative around
GLAM (Museums).
Initiative Context

Museums are important cultural institutions for GLAM initiatives. There is
no complete and reliable list Museums across India. This is due to various
reasons like geographical distribution and jurisdiction. These institutions
have a wealth of cultural knowledge and artifacts and therefore are key to
partner with.

Some of the incredible artifacts they house are not widely known to the
general public. As an example Mysore museums house the Halmidi inscription
has the oldest kannada inscriptions that go back to 400-500 AD.

Museums can come under various jurisdictions like the following:

   - Archaeological survey of India
   - Central ministries - Culture, Rail, etc
   - State archaeology departments
   - Run by public sectors
   - Private ownership
   - Run by Trusts or NGOs

Museums can cover various themes:

   - Heritage
   - Archaeological
   - Art and Crafts
   - Folk forms/culture
   - Science
   - and more...

What needs to be done?

Catalog and compile a reliable list of Museums for each of the states and
UTs in the country. This will need to done by reviewing various sources
online, state and central departments.

Subsequently a subset of these could be chosen for specific initiatives.
Call for volunteers

This is a for volunteers to assist with this compilation. We need one
volunteer for each of the states.

Please volunteer here: http://wiki.wikimedia.in/List_of_Museums_in_India

Starting point for GLAM initiatives: http://wiki.wikimedia.in/GLAM_India

Look forward to your active participation. Thank you!

regards

Arun

Hi we are doing a project on integration of clustering(X-means) and
classification(J48). So we need to know how to add a new attribute along
with the original dataset based on the clusters obtained from X-means, to
each instance which it belongs to.

Hi,

Happy to know that you are into clustering.
But, to answer your question, we need some more information.

The keywords X-means, J48, attribute,dataset,instance are looking as jargons,
as most people here are not into clustering.

A few people may answer the question, but for them you have to explain
more about your project.

As there are many types of clustering, explain what type you are trying.
Give some links that you follow to setup the cluster.
It will help us to know more on what you are trying to do and someone
may answer you.

Wishes.

Is it HPC or HA cluster?

If it is HA cluster, I would be able to help.

Interest in web based presentation tool is quite encouraging.
Well actually there _are_ web based presentation tool already
available and ubiquitous, take for example google docs. But
they mostly ape Desktop apps like MS PPT inside the browser.

It would be cool to have a presentation tool that is
key-board based as opposed to GUI based, to create presentations.
In other words, a presentation tool that is to PPT what wiki is to MS-WORD.

I have written a wiki processor eazytext to translate wiki-text
to HTML whose rendering, look and feel, is fully customisable with CSS skins.
I was kind of wondering, if we apply both JS and CSS, as a theme, on the
generated HTML can we make the HTML to behave like a presentation.

OP IS talking about data clustering :)
J48 is a decision tree algorithm

The correct answer to OP's question:

LaTex very good example for creating rich document using simple text markups. On
the other hand it has steeper learning curve and higher noise level,
markup-characters / content-characters, when compared to wiki based
text. Thanks for
the pointer.

Application: Hugin

What it is:

Hugin is a panorama photo stitching program. Essentially, Hugin is a
GUI frontend for Panorama Tools. Stitching is accomplished by using
several overlapping photos taken from the same location, and using
control points to align and transform the photos so that they can be
blended together to form a larger image. Hugin allows for the easy
creation of control points between two images, optimization of the
image transforms, and much more.

To know more about:
http://hugin.sourceforge.net/

To install in Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install hugin

Hey thanks for the pointer. I am happy, atleast thus far, to use eazytext
for all my documentation needs. I was only wondering how good can it be if I
apply JS and CSS presentation theme on top of eazytext generated html. Ofcourse
Tiddly wiki does wiki->HTML inside the browser, using JS, but I don't have that
requirement right now. Anyway I will remember give it a try when such
requirements
crop up. Thanks for the suggestion.

Subject: [Ilugc] Building RPMs in Ubuntu
Message-ID: <CACbtZwR4JJ=11JUji3UhLBvpAfBVGHnALL4AomVE8HSNGSOGEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have been using Ubuntu (debian) system all through the Linux life.
Recently I got into a situation where I am required to package a software
for a RPM system (CentOS). There are rpm build tools available in the
Ubuntu repos, but I my reading through the forums suggest that its always
better to build rpms in a rpm based system.

Considering we will be specifying the dependencies in the
packaging configuration file and we will be packaging compiled
binaries, How far does it hold good?.

Has anyone packaged RPM things on Ubuntu or any other debian system? What
are the issues you ran into? Is there really any compatibility issues?

P.S: I am asking all this to avoid another OS installation and dev
environment setup procedure. (Pardon my laziness here)

This is the right approach.

Dependencies you specify solve only part of the packaging problem. You 
*might* face issues in resolving other shared library dependencies that 
your binary uses or it just so happens at times that the configuration 
files you depend on lie in a different location. Also, Since CentOS/RHEL 
is targeted at better stability, they might be behind in many areas. 
Also, not to mention the human error, it is better if you test/install 
the package yourself on CentOS before giving it to someone else.

+1.

Wordpress is obviously the most intuitive CMS out there. Also, new web
standards like CSS3 are embraced more by wordpress and its community than
any other, AFAIK.

Creating pages/posts and publishing is a very straight forward thing in WP.
Unless the site will be having highly dynamic content or a web portal,
wordpress would be my clear choice.

I don't think they will. Because to build a Linux version and offer it to
people, they need to release the source code as well. Which they will not
do.

crap.

All religions are devoid of reason and reek of whimsical decision making.
The author does not seem to be qualified in religious studies or
philosophy either.

CRAP

You don't anything about Religion.

Please read "The heathen in his blindness" by Prof. Balagangadhara,
University of Ghent, Belgium, before using the word "religion".

Anyway this is off topic.

No, I know a lot about religion, nature of knowledge and philosophy of
various Indian texts and more.
What the author has written does not reflect well on his competence.

Can you explain why source code should be released?
To my knowledge, code signing does not require source code to be
submitted...

Hi,
Koha is overkill for a single user collection.
Installing and starting is not simple if you are not on Debian.
Needs knowledge about MARC standards.
Dealing with anything other than books and serials means more work.

we have already had a thread that open source is nothing but communism.
Actually if one looks at the tenets of christianity, one sees that 'help
your neighbour' is the key, and anyone who has read Stallman will find
that it is one of his favourite quotes - this coupled with the fact that
there are a huge number of Christian distros (each with it's own BDFL -
which most hindu distros do not have) it is clear that open source is
Christian.

Message-ID: <CAJKKQ=_MZVgiU+uu9n4sH7Eixsr05OWWvMA8bdr4Gk01xZOiQw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Friends,

How fsck runs after power failure in Linux?


Unmounting a file system during a standard shutdown sets the clean bit in
the file system header, indicating that the file system was cleanly
umounted and is consistent. If the Linux system is not properly shut down
such as on power failure or on system crashes, the clean bit in file system
header is not set which indicates that the file system is not clean and
need to be cleaned by utilities like fsck/e2fsck in order to make them
usable again.

Sekar: This is a view which denies religions.? Had one gone through the practices of Hinduism the response would concur with the author.? The author's article is not really crap, but reminds one of the open nature of the religion.

?
Sekar: Richard Stallman when he came to India equated Open source Freedom to Swatantra.? 
Of course Swatantra means much more than freedom.? Help your neighbour concurs with? Hinduism's grand vision of Vasudeva Kutumbakam - Entire Universe is one family.?? Hope this explains.

Is that really necessary to release source code? If so how skype messenger,
some propitiatory games like Penumbra Black plague, Braid, Osmos are
released for Linux without source code?

it is not necessary - only distros like Fedora or debian will not
distribute the software or put it in their repos. Some other distros are
not so particular.

However they may be, denial of existence of god or atheism is still 
Hinduism [1]. Not to mention, In 1995 Supreme Court [2] came up with the 
following ruling,

"(29). When we think of the Hindu religion, we find it difficult, if not 
impossible, to define Hindu religion or even adequately describe it. 
Unlike other religions in the world, the Hindu religion does not claim 
any one prophet; it does not worship any one God; it does not subscribe 
to any one dogma; it does not believe in any one philosophic concept; it 
does not follow any one set of religious rites or performances; in fact, 
it does not appear to satisfy the narrow traditional features of any 
religion of creed. It may broadly be described as a way of life and 
nothing more."

I am no religious fanatic and I think the article was an interesting 
comparison of Hinduism and Open Source. They are both vast and diverse.

Lol, An interesting argument. As true as it is, at least the idea of 
open source can be related to Hinduism, from the perspective of being 
open and letting anyone modify the original work.

The Pinnacle PCTV Pro with the bt878 chipset works fine using bttv. I've
used it a few years ago.

I have used this official tutorial on how to publish mercurial
repositories using hgwebdir -
http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/HgWebDirStepByStep and got it
working on Debian. Ubuntu.

now to add some ghee to the flame - as many of you will know the GSOC
mentor's list has a hot discussion going regarding widespread cheating
in GC-IN - including the interesting information that 80% of the
cheaters are Indians. There have even been suggestions that *all*
Indians be banned from GC-IN and GSOC too. So what does this suggest to
us about our culture and our understanding of open source culture?

afaik there is no such thing as a mercurial server. Every mercurial
repository is independent and can be accessed as a file on a local
machine, or over ssh/http/ etc on a remote machine.

Read the full document before you try it out. Also, check your
firewall, selinux settings as mentioned.

You might also want to try the official documentation mentioned by Guruprasad.

You don't have to release the source code. I don't see point of pushing

sftp is part of openssh package.

You can download packages for Solaris from their open source repository.

All GNU packages are ported to Sun Solaris.

It is ages since I worked on this platform.

       I am not very sure if I get your question right. But which
version of Solaris are you running ? Is it the OpenSolaris(Open
Indiana) or the commercial edition from Sun/Oracle ? If it is Open
Indiana, it is as good as any GNU/Linux distro. You get gcc/g++, and
openssh. You can do pkg install <pkg_name> to install any package.
They also have a synaptic like UI to install software. But, we can
help only if you explain what eactly you are doing. When you say sftp
using C++, do you mean to say you are implementing the SFTP protocol ?
sftp client and server? Please explain. Thanks

Why ? are you uncomfortable talking about religion ?

Although, imho - thinking of open source as religion is pointless. Its
about the alternative - not a path or way. heck, its not even a mindset.

Indians cheating ? Nay sir, they are just damn too smart for rest of the world.
Whoever said being competitive is directly proportional to working hard.

> So what does this suggest to

History can throw some light on that.

So I was reading this book, "Alcatraz versus the evil librarians",
(yep I still read
children's books), here the protagonist and his friend (a 13 year old
ninja girl)
will be in a tight situation inside a library built by evil
librarians. Now to avoid
being surrounded by librarian thugs our protagonist had to distract them
somehow. And then he remember seeing a bunch of speaking dinosaurs, speaking
with British accent and only as tall as a human being, captivated inside a cell.
He runs back to the cell followed by his puzzled ninja girl-friend, and
immediately breaks open the cell, releasing all the dinosaurs. And explains
to his ninja girl, who by now is more puzzled about our protagonist's motive,
that, dinosaurs even if human sized ought to run around rampaging the library
floors, thus creating a rocus distracting the librarian thugs. The
ninja girl gets
thoroughly irritated and replies "Didn't you notice ? they are British
dinosaurs !!
and everyone knows, all British are refined, calm, and well mannered,
even if they
are a bunch of dinosaurs". And to his horror, our protagonist was watching the
dinosaurs leave the cell one by one politely thanking him and
strolling gracefully
down the corridor.

Okay now we know how and who of Brits. Let us move on to our quintessential
Indian.

So there was this quintessential Indian, let us call him Ihdang, who
by some cruck
of luck happen to land on London. Tragedy befell the British Empire - an empire,
in those days, where sun never sets. And soon he could grasp what
Alcatraz grasped
belatedly, that the British are refined, calm and well mannered, even
if they are a bunch
of dinosaurs. And out of nowhere he decided to play "political saint", pulling
together the likes of Alrib for funding and the likes of Urhen and
Letap for mass, and
all the while forcing the Brits to be, well a refined, calm and well
mannered Brit.
Call for a total boycott until the colonial machinery comes to stand still and
when the Brits mount their guns, walk back to work as if nothing has happened.
Declare fast until death only to drink a cup of juice once the Brits
blink due to nervous
exhaustion.

One can only describe the situation better through the words of Joker
from Darknight

   "What happens when an unstoppable force meet an immovable object ?"

The Brits could take it no more. They left India to quintessential Indians.

Did you read this far because you got a hint that it is about
historical facts ? Okay,
history is something that I write when I get bored writing programs. And as a
cultural fact, all my folks can teach history even if they don't know
how to read or
write. Anyone still around ?

Thanks for the interest.
We need in person training in chennai.

May be we can have some training in IRC.
If you are happy with IRC training, we can proceed for that too.

Share your thoughts.

I'm sorry, but I do not recall. I suspect I bought it second-hand from a
guy who bought it in Mumbai. However, I do remember that it was
available at that time here.

If all the diverse belief and non-belief systems of India can be 'grouped'
into one named religion / "one way of life" called Hinduism, then it is
akin to grouping all kinds of software, whether free or copy righted or
patented, under a single label. In this sense, I must agree with the author
that the term "Open Source" is quite similar to the term "Hinduism" -
arbitrary, open to interpretation and confusing to the uninitiated.

The term "Open Source" only refers to software whose source is available,
not on whether we have the rights to use it, maintain it and distribute it
freely as a community.

Which is why, to refer to software that is By the people, For the people
and Of the people the term "Free Software" is better than "Open Source".
Not using the term "Open Source" would have completely eliminated this
thread ;)

Wow! This is awesome. For astronomy hobbyist who can also code, this is a
dream come true.
Hats of to NASA. They were pretty much open source "minded" with the
scientific data they produced too. All the spectacular images and graphics
published in NASA and NASA associated websites are in public domain.

unfortunately it is a closed list. But basically what happened is that
Indian students were using google translate and trying to earn money
(like a guy from Bhopal doing a translation to Siberian!) Now I wonder
how many of our GSOC people cheat?

A web search would have given you the link right away :)  It is a
command line tool(and a library) for data transfer. Thanks

And, Please trim your posts properly before sending. Don't include the

It's important for programmers to challenge themselves.

Creative and technical stagnation is the only alternative.

In the spirit of the new year, I've compiled twelve month-sized resolutions.

Each month is an annually renewable technical or personal challenge:

    Go analog.
    Stay healthy.
    Embrace the uncomfortable.
    Learn a new programming language.
    Automate.
    Learn more mathematics.
    Focus on security.
    Back up your data.
    Learn more theory.
    Engage the arts and humanities.
    Learn new software.
    Complete a personal project.

Read on for my suggestions.

It is good to hear that you are going to conduct a FOSS workshop but you 
should not hijack an existing thread in the mailing list i.e, replying 
to a email in an intent to create a new topic.

Please resend your email with appropriate subject and create a new 
thread, ie., don't reply to an email and change subject but instead 
compose a new email.

Happened 3 days back:
Guy from reputed engineering college walks into my office. He actually
comes here with my friend's reference. He wants to do an internship. Asked
him about his project thinking he wants to do it here. He says it's being
done by HCL career development center. Rs6,500/- per person, 3 in a team.
They will explain the project and the project report to them too at the
same cost. Asked him why he wants to work here if he was not interested
even in doing his own project. He says that he is already 'campus selected'
by Infosys and Wipro. Then again I ask him why then he wants to do an
internship. He says his friends scared him saying that he will be kicked
out of Infosys and Wipro after training if he does not know about work
ethics and other stuff.

Awesomeness - The guy, HCL CDS, Infosys and Wipro.
India, the IT power house!!!! We will be the greatest.

Arun

I sympathize.

This narrow, skewed work-ethics is, IMO, due to something uniquely indian
by nature - one is perceived to be 'better off' by society if they're found
to be in a good position and it is also expected that people in good
positions 'know' what they're doing. Both combined, results in people not
accepting what they don't know and in racing to 'climb the ladder' for this
mysterious religion called 'growth', this strategy by itself is quite
harmful to one's career... above it, when we play out a game of such
similar strategies, there is a run away phenomenon that ends up lowering
the entire company's bar. The bad hire the worse and it quickly turns into
a hell hole.

... but nothing is black and white. I've found good people from
Infosys/TCS-types as well or even people with completely irrelevant
backgrounds shining. I guess the differentiating variable is "Passion".

When we got 700,000 "engineers" graduating every year from India and
countless more other 'graduates', most of them confused because their view
of the world states that they must first get a well paying, "dignified"
job. With such a scenario, such sweat shops are but inevitable? It is
perhaps still cost effective to keep 4 guys to do each of coding, testiing,
documenting and releasing 3 lines of code per day. Money beats Logic.

A cousin of mine was happy because his BPO company offered him the title of
"Executive Officer". Hmmm?

cheers,

This is fantastic. Can you share how you got that done ? If you think
sharing that information might hamper your business, excuse me for
asking the question.

I was excited because there are so many things we can do with such
a large collection of repositories.

It is more a case of having got used to MS Office. I find LibreOffice
to be quite easy to use and visually appealing as well.

         You have far better options than that. Read the thread on
Impress.js for an example. LaTeX beamer is another. And Lyx is a
WYSIWYG that supports beamer

           MS Exchange is not part of the office suite. And so even if
Office is released for linux(We know that the story was fake), they
need not release MS Exchange. And taking just Outlook into
consideration, I find both Evolution and Thunderbird to be better.

I havn't setup up mercurial repositories to be accessed via http. So this
is my wild guess.

It is true that mercurial is a distributed VCS and that
all the version control information is stored inside the directory called
.hg/ under repository root, and the working tree is simply a checkout
of .hg/

Now to access mercurial repository it is enough to have the
file path or file url. And because of this ssh becomes quite convenient
to access remote file-paths, since ssh server naturally understands
unix file tree.

But HTTP server is a different beast. It requires configuration to map
HTTP urls to file path. And I guess OP is requesting information on
that.

To: mediawiki-l at lists.wikimedia.org


Greetings!

Utilizing the model set by Wikimedia staff IRC office hours,
MediaWiki.org's WikiProject Extensions is presenting our first
MediaWiki Workshops for developers (volunteer and staff). ?Preparing
extensions for MediaWiki 1.19 will be held on 13 January, 2012 at
19:00 UTC in IRC (#wikimedia-dev).

This IRC workshop will be an opportunity to find out about changes in
MediaWiki 1.19 that may require revisions to extensions or skins. Also
an opportunity to ask MediaWiki developers questions regarding
extension development.

Everyone is invited to attend. ?Developers interested in serving as
"extensions" or "MediaWiki 1.19" experts are encouraged to signup as
participants at:
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:WikiProject_Extensions/MediaWiki_Workshops#MediaWiki_1.19_Experts

If there's continued interest / demand, MediaWiki Workshops will
typically last one hour, and happen no more than twice a month to
present trainings, hold discussions and collaborate on community or
WikiProject Extensions projects. Facilitators host the session to
introduce any presenters, determine the order of questions, and
generally helps to keep things going. Time of day will vary in order
to offer people in different parts of the world the opportunity to
participate. Future topics will likely include MediaWiki.org
documentation, ResourceLouder orientation and workshops similar to our
inaugural chat to prepare for each MediaWiki release.

More information:
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:WikiProject_Extensions/MediaWiki_Workshops

MediaWiki.org's WikiProject SysAdmins will also likely host similar
MediaWiki Workshops to help third-party wiki system administrators.
Stay tuned for more information, and chime in at:
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:WikiProject_SysAdmins/Ideas

Look forward to seeing folks next Friday! ?Please feel free to forward
this along to any interested folks.

I find it appealing too.. But those who have been using ribbons and
stuff on MS will not find it as appealing or easy to use.. I've tried
MS word and I must say most tools are handy. They are easier to access
than they are in LibreOffice. But I love LibreOffice for several other
reasons impertinent to a MS user.

Bad learning curve. No one wants to unlearn what they've already
learnt and learn something new. I'm sure many have neither the time
nor the inclination to do that. Beamer is brilliant I agree. But do
you really expect people to learn it and use it? People want to use
the mouse to click and move stuff and get their work done. Beamer is
for pros, mathematicians and enthusiasts. Atleast IMO.

Yes. I meant that most enterprises use Exchange server and Outlook
does a good job of integrating with it. I know Thunderbird has a
plugin to do that and Evolution can handle it by default. But still,
I'm pointing out why MS Office in Linux might be exciting to some
people and enterprises.

That said, I really do hope LibreOffice (and LaTeX and Thunderbird) is
improved and people start using it big time. I do, really ! :)

Dear Friends,

The workshop venue has been changed to,

ICSA Programme Centre,
Pantheon Road,
Opposite to Connemara Library (or) National Museum,
Egmore.

We are regret to inform you that we would be charging 100 Rs. as
registration fee.

Unfortunately the University of Madras venue(which was free) has been
changed due to its internal university events to this new venue(which
is paid).

Hi,

Am looking for a small form factor device which I plan to install in
clients premises and maintain through SSH over the internet. It should have
4GB RAM and 500GB HDD and a decent CPU.

Has anyone here bought / assembled a mini ITX based system? Are the
components available in Chennai?

Ideas most welcome.

thanks,

A few years back I read an article that said MS Office is the biggest money
spinner for Microsoft and every other product (including Windows) were
being subsidized by it to create the lock in. The article claimed that was
the reason MS only publishes consolidated revenues and never product wise
breakups.

So, who knows, Now that MS Office is no longer shackled, maybe it'll earn
them more money now.

I guess, in the course of many mails people didn't realise/forgot that the

Pardon my ignorance. What do you mean by language model ? And by
Tamil-corpus do you mean a large collection of tamil text ?

You need to define "Decent CPU". For what? Will people compile code and/or
run CPU heavy applications?  Are they just workers using web applications
and simple desktop applications (such as libreoffice) most of the time?

I just went through the exercise of setting up a lab infrastructure built
up of 15 thin clients and a decent server setup. I assembled my rig afer
evaluating ready-made alternatives in the market. The reason I chose my rig
was primarily limited by budget and the need to be low on power consumption
just so I save myself from rising energy prices.

I documented my experience at ILUGC here:

1. Initial email asking for suggestions from the list:
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc/73079
2. What I chose (and why) and associated experience:
http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc/73548

I did not end up with a mini-ITX "sized" cabinet but it was atleast thin
and allows me to keep it horizontal and the display on top of it. If you're
willing to invest a bit more, check out http://www.disklessworkstations.com/

Pardon my ignorance. What do you mean by language model ?



A language model is a statistical model which populate from a data set.
Here I think OP is taling about creating language model for Speech
Processing. N-Gram is a kind of language model
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram

And by
> Tamil-corpus do you mean a large collection of tamil text ?

Corpus in the context of Natural Language Processing is:
A large collection of text .

There are different types of corpus such as Text Corpus, Speech Corpus,
Image corpus etc..

Here OP requires a text corpus. I think he can use the Tamil Wikipedia dump
as corpus for his research purpose. Or he can populate a corpus from
newspaper RSS feeds and Tamil blog feeds too.

All these facilities are available in OpenOffice.org/ LibreOffice.
If you want some thing more than that you can try Lotus Symphey from IBM
too .

The visual appeal VBA Macros, in Document, Spreadsheet etc are available in
OpenOffice.org, LibreOffice and Lotus Symphoney .
There are wonderful FOSS alternatives for Outlook like Thunderbird .

So there is no point in your "four points"

I think as of now nobody is providing Speech corpus in Open Domain. There
was something available in this site http://www.nrcfosshelpline.in/. But is
it is not working now.
The better solution is Go to AIR website they may be publishing the daily
AIR Tamil news audio files. I am not sure . Just check . But there will be
lot of noise in those recording.

Wukan in Context

 The Arab Spring...followed by the Bersih 2.0 movement in
Malaysia...followed by the Indignado movement in Spain.. followed by
the Occupy Protests in the United States... followed by the protests
against electoral malpractice and more in Russia ...and now protests
in the Wukan village in China? It is easy to make a comparative
assessment of the incidents in Wukan village in Guandong province in
China with the other protests against power in various parts of the
world and say that this is just a re-enactment against authority.
Authority could be differentiated - be it dictatorship in the Arab
world, oligarchy in Malaysia, two-party duopoly in Spain, financial
capital and plutocracy in the United States, atypical Kremlinology of
the Putin variety in Russia, but there are commonalities - the pursuit
of policies that are skewed in the interests of capitalists,
speculators, the rich and against common people. So is Wukan on
similar lines?

In the case of the Wukan protests - directed at local communist party
and government officials over a land deal - it seems that the higher
leadership of the Communist Party effected an immediate reprisal over
corrupt officials in accordance with the villagers? wishes. The
controversial land deal has also been cancelled. It seems to be a case
of the ruling party pre-empting the burgeoning of the protests against
its authority in general. But questions arise if this can be
replicated elsewhere and whether the apparatuses of the Communist
Party ruled state are democratic and robust enough to address peoples'
concerns about displacement and loss of livelihoods.

This article in the Diplomat  has an interesting drift - the party?s
attempts to bring about a reasonable denouement in favour of the
aggrieved people in Wukan cannot be generalised, as the outcomes in
Wukan were more due to inner party dynamics. Wang Yang, the secretary
of the Guandong provincial committee of the CPC, played a vital role
in the peaceful outcome in Wukan, by sympathizing with the protesting
villagers. This solidified his claims to be incorporated in the CPC?s
politburo standing committee in the forthcoming Congress. Other high
profile CPC leaders like Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai have also
adopted a similar route towards acquiring popularity. He is credited
for launching a serious crackdown on organised crime in Chongqing in
2009, arresting over 2000 gangsters. Wang Yang was Bo Xilai?s
predecessor in Chongqing.

But protests in China are rising. There is a lot of discontent with
the model of growth in China, which while bringing economic prosperity
during the reform period, has also involved rising inequality among
social classes and between urban and rural areas. Thousands of popular
protests take place in China every year, mostly against land grab by
corrupted party officials. Real estate is a major component of China?s
growth story, and there is widespread apprehension about a real estate
bubble.

To maintain its legitimacy, the CPC often punishes its own party
officials in order to distance itself from corruption. For instance,
Chen Liangyu was dismissed as party secretary of the Shanghai
municipal committee in 2006 and jailed for his involvement in
siphoning off money from the social security fund. Xi Jinping, who
took over as the Shanghai party chief following the scandal, went on
to become a Politburo Standing Committee member and is expected to
succeed Hu Jintao as Party chief and head of state later this year.
Earlier, in 1995, Beijing mayor Chen Xitong was also dismissed and
jailed for corruption. But skeptics maintain that these punishments
merely amount to scratching the surface.

While the Communist Party seems to be cognisant about the problems of
corruption and rising discontent against land grab
(http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90882/7693306.html ), it still
remains to be seen if there would be a definite shift in the policies
of the CPC and the Chinese government - from an export driven, state
capitalist model of growth to a truer socialist vision as its
Constitution claims. And whether indeed there is a truer
democratisation within the Communist party as it is besieged by
complaints of sleaze and graft at various levels of leadership.

Are you contributing to Linux kernel? Most of the people in India write
software for money (it is a sad truth and I want that to change). If you
could help people get started many will come forward and do help in
improving Linux (this includes me).

How is this relevant to ILUGC? I believe it is out of place even with an
OT tag.

Velmurugan,

Anyone who is interested in FOSS can participate. There is no official
membership in LUGs, at least in ILUGC. You are a member of ILUGC :)

I am using GNU/Linux  (fedora) for more than 7 years . Now I am working as
a Senior Staff to a Multinational Company. Handles lots of document than
code . Still I am using OpenOffice.org / LibreOffice and Lotus Symphony for
read write and send documents clients across the glob. Still I don't have
any issues with it. With this experience I dare put forward my argument .

IMHO building a language model out of Tamil Wikipedia is a bad idea..
It has lots of colloquial terms and modern/mixed words.. And sentences
are similar to everyday conversations.

That is exactly what I mean. You are using Linux for more than 7
years. You are used to it. Even I like LibreOffice. Try and look at
things from the perspective of a long time MS office user and you'll
understand what I mean. I myself use LibreOffice / Claws mail /
Thunderbird. I'm speaking about normal users, you know? Those who
don't care about FOSS and stuff. People who just want to get their
work done, and fast.

I would like to suggest some thing you may not like: try googling
something like, "openoffice sucks" or "why I hate openoffice" or
something similar. I know that most are mere nonsensical rants and
that many problems stated would have already been fixed in
LibreOffice. But then, see what they mean when they say usability /
ease - of -use / interface etc. I find LibreOffice pretty usable for
myself. Convincing people is a nightmare and I'm trying to do just
that.

Op requires the same type of stuff . If colloquial words are there that
will be an added advantage for building Speech Systems for Tamil language.
Note that there is NO FOSS corpus for Tamil Language or any Indian Language

This reason is quite simple. Things purchased by paying or stolen for
personal use are always sweet for the user. That siw hy ardent M$ product
users hate Free/Libre things.
It is human tendency to blame free things.
If a user is rich and willing to spend, and balme others that is his/her
will. But think of a day when you are not able read the first love letter
prepared in your computer using M$ product is not readable in your old days.

If you are looking for the work to be done that is possible in OOo and
LibreOffice

My requirement is to run a web app on the h/w. It need not have a monitor
and keyboard connected to it. It only needs to connect to the customers
network switch/router.

A HDD is essential. As for the processor, I would prefer Core i3 but a Core
2 Duo should suffice.

I did follow your earlier informative posts. Will go through it again.

thanks,

simple question - how much does that fancy office cost? is it still
appealing when you dip into your pocket to pay for it (especially the
professional version that you love?)

here we go again. Who is the normal user? He is a myth. Like the common
man. Everyone speaks of the common man - but no one admits that he is
the common man. Please do not speak of the normal user. Speak for

With my personal experience i'm sure that they are not good at software
side(particularly in areas other than chennai ).But they are very strong in
the hardware side such as A+,N+,CCNA and other hardware and networking
stuffs.They are also doing their best to place their candidates in
companies(especially hardware and networking that too not in software!!!!).

Graphics

>From Linux 3.2 onwards, the DRM/KMS driver for Intel GPUs will enable
the very efficient and Intel-specific RC6 graphics power-saving
feature by default (1, 2). That change also enabled the Intel-specific
technique on Intel's current "Sandy Bridge" by default; unfortunately,
soon after the changes were made further problems were found with the
"Sandy Bridge" implementation and the kernel developers have disabled
"Sandy Bridge" support by default (1, 2) again. Since RC6 lowers the
power consumption of many Sandy Bridge systems with Intel graphics by
a few watts, it is especially interesting for notebooks as it can
significantly extend the battery life. It can be activated on older
kernels with the boot parameter i915.i915_enable_rc6=1, but those
versions lack fixes for some problems surrounding the use of RC6,
which have been included in Linux 3.2.

The Nouveau driver now uses the acceleration functions that are
available with the auto-generated firmware on the Fermi graphic cores
NVC1 (GeForce GT 415M, 420, 420M, 425M, 430, 435M, 525M, 530, 540M,
550M and 555, as well as Quadro 600 and 1000M), NVC8 (GeForce GTX 560
Ti OEM, 570, 580 and 590 as well as Quadro 3000M, 4000M and 5010M) and
NVCF (GeForce GTX 550 Ti and 560M) chips; Linux 3.2 will be the first
kernel version to support the latter graphics chips.} \unquote

Ok, wrong terminology, 'normal user' is not the word that I intended.
What I meant was people who use Windows just to use MS Office. And the
cost of MS office that most of my friends use is about Rs. 50 (inclusive
of the cost of CD and CD burning charges ;)

For serious users who do not want to pirate, like companies and
enterprises, the prices don't seem to matter much. Even for Linux,
they'll be willing to spend about the same amount to BUY MS office for
Linux. I can't speak for myself because I am, and have been a Linux user
for a few years now and I've been quite comfortable using FOSS
applications. Believe me when I say, it's a myth that people go for FOSS
because it's 'free of cost'. Most people I know, are using Linux for
it's obvious technical advantages, some for the freedom and the rest for
pure fun.

The few that are running MS Windows are refusing to switch to Linux
because of two reasons, GAMES and MS Office. I can show them cool games
for Linux like 0AD, etc. But if it so happens that MS office is
available for Linux as well, I'm positive there'll be atleast a few
hundred machines switching to Linux in my home town. You can simply not
speak about software freedom and philosophies of free software to them.
'Virus free' is the ONLY part they like about it.

WTF was that. What do you mean by asking me 'Define Linux' this is a forum
where we exchange views. Not to satisfy ones ego. I am afraid that you are
subscribed to the mailing list and do not have any knowledge about the
legality associated with Linux. Check that out first.

Now you Define Linux and above all Define Open Source.

@Krishnan
Be cool and patient. This is a public forum. Be gentile as much as
possible.
The name/term Linux refers to kernal of Operating System.
A distribution is called as GNU/Linux distribution such as Debian .
That is all . There is nothing to be panic. Just be open minded

LOL. :D This is getting hilarious. Anyway, calm down & read what others
have said in previous mails and may be wikipedia entries to learn how
things work. Linux is just a kernel. The 'Linux' you say are distributions
& are entirely different matter. Distos like Linux Mint, Mandriva Linux
comes with closed source stuff like Adobe Flash, graphics drivers etc
pre-installed (need not install 'later on').

      Never shoot a mail in haste. Now this is recorded for ever than
you replied in a hurry without understanding the question.

     Now, well, I don't know the legalities associated with Linux. I
don't even know what "legalities associated with Linux" means. Can you
explain that ?  And when you said, they do not come with Linux, what
did you mean ? Even stuff like gcc, bash and firefox do not come with
linux, of that's what you mean. And this is exactly what Akilan asked
you when he said define linux.

          And above everything, please read the list guidelines. Don't
top post. It is a horrible thing to do. Thanks

If its an app the customer will use from their own premises locally and if
you think the app will not see more than a request every second and your
app is light weight then an Atom processor will just do. The advantage with
Atom is that it will fit your form-factor requirements much more easily
than conventional CPUs that require cooling fans. You can check out
ready-made atom-based HTPCs such as from http://panache.co.in/ or even just
buy their small form factor HTPC case and DIY the rest.

and possibly creating a nightmare for yourself.

It would be best to build the RPM in an environment where it will be
used including it's specific version i.e. CentOS.

With Virtual Box, it is quite easy to setup a VM with CentOS guest and
carry on your RPM build process in it.

Subject: [chennaipy 1190] Python learning resources.
To: <chennaipy at googlegroups.com>, "Bangalore Python Users Group - India" <
bangpypers at python.org>

Saw this mail in MumPy user group.

------------

I am not sure of any institutes, however I also doubt if there are any.
But, there are a lot of online resources:
http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/index.html
http://www.learnpythonthehardway.org/
http://www.learnpython.org/
http://www.spoken-tutorials.org
http://inventwithpython.com/
Google !
Also, some very good books for beginners are: Head First Python and
Head First Programming. You can then read Learning Python and
Programming Python, which offer in-depth coverage of the language. And
the Python Essential Reference by David Beazley is always a good book
to have.

Happy learning !

Ouch ! Sharp fangs :) My English sucks big time.. Ok, what I really
meant was people who are stuck with Windows because they can run MS
office only on Windows and they are stuck with MS office for some reason..

And I don't know what you mean by 'we'. And why you 'do not want' such
people to use Linux. That opinion is yours and everyone else seems to be
OK with anyone who wants to use Linux for any reason to use Linux for
any reason.

Do you think that M$ will give this freedom by releasing a GNU/Linux
version of M$ Office ?

Friends.


Please note the following things.

Microsoft may or may not give MS office linux version
People may buy it or not.

It is up to the company and the users.

We can not conclude anything on this.

Only thing we can do is to promote the use of LibreOffice.

Unless we contribute to LibreOffice, we can not do anything
productively in the long running discussions.


Do we have any LibreOffice code contributors?

http://www.libreoffice.org/get-involved/
http://www.libreoffice.org/get-involved/developers/

Is it possible to have a workshop or hack-day for libreoffice development here?

Neither am I. But no one can do anything about it. I'm just saying
that's what happens. Current state of affairs. I'm not giving software
piracy my approval. I'm merely stating things as they are.

Of course not. I know it won't.

Hi Friends,

i tried to install Mplayer on my ubuntu 11.10 verison...

There seems to be a programming error in aptdaemon, the software that allows
you to install/remove software and to perform other package management

kindly check this above error .. and kindle give your comments to resolve

Adding to this,

sudo apt-get purge mplayer

will physically remove the package from your machine, along with

Subject: [ILUG-Cochin.org] What&apos;s New in Linux 3.2?
To: <mailinglist at ilug-cochin.org>

What better way to kick off the new year than with a brand new kernel,
fresh out of Kernel.org? Linus Torvalds released the 3.2 kernel on January
4th, with improvements in the Ext4 and Btrfs filesystems, thin provisioning
features, a new architecture, and CPU bandwidth control.

The last major kernel release was in late October of last year. That
release, if you recall, included support for OpenRISC, Near-Field
Communications, and the cpupowerutils project.

Hi,

I am trying to write a program to split Tamil characters in a word.
When I use this function,
*preg_match_all('/./u', $str, $results)*

I get this output
*array(5) { [0]=> string(3) "?" [1]=> string(3) "?" [2]=> string(3) "?"
[3]=> string(3) "?" [4]=> string(3) "?" } *

But I have to get each characters ? ?? ??, not ? ? ? ? ?

so anyone can help me to correct this program.

Thank you.



Regards,
Priya.

You can have a list of characters that are to be attached to previous
character (like ?, ?). There must be better methods but this is what I know.

Subject: [fosscomm] Open document standards mandatory in Hungary government
To: "Fosscom Network" <network at fosscom.in>

**

Hungary's public administrations will by default use open document
standards for their electronic documents, as of April this year, the
government ministers agreed on 23 December, and all public organisations
are encouraged to move to open source office tools. *Hungary's government
also in December decided to cancel the funding of proprietary office
suite licences for all schools.*

The minister's decision on open standards instructs public
administrations to save their documents, spreadsheets and presentations
only in standard formats that are accepted by international standard
organisations. Public administrations are required to be able to receive
and handle documents sent to them, and all official documents must be
made available in a open standard format.

Except for the ministry of Defense, all ministries must complete the
transition to using open standards before the end of March, the IT news
site HWSW reported on Monday. Vilmos V?lyi-Nagy, Deputy State Secretary
of IT, quoted by IT news site IT Cafe, explained that the institutions
have been told of the decision months before and that many are already
preparing for the changes.

The government now recommends that public organisations switch to using
open source office suites, reports HWSW. If not, the institutes will
have to explain the technical and economic reasons why they depend on
proprietary office tools.

School licences
The government in December also decided not to renew a proprietary
office software licence deal for all of the country's schools. In a
statement on Tisztaszoftver (Legal Software), a web site aiming to
reduce the use of unlicensed software, the ministry of Education
explains that the measure is intended to boost competition in this area.
"The ministry is convinced that the needs of the educational
institutions can be satisfied by using free and open source software."

The current proprietary licence contract will run out on 1 March.

The cancellation of the funding of proprietary office licences had been
discussed by the government when the contract ran out in March 2011. At
that time the ministry decided to extend the licence deal for one more
year.

Based on the information in the screenshot, the native battery monitor
applets that come with the destkops (KDE, XFce, Gnome) give about the
same information.

'we' means those of us who do not approve of using stolen software. And
if people who are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong come to
the open source community, they will give the community a bad name.

They are stuck with M$ Widows because they don't want to look at 
options, because they don't want to change anything around them. Linux 
won't do anything to such 'idiot' users. Yes, I am deliberately using 
the world idiot because I help people migrate and once in a while I come 
across such people who actually don't even need windows -- all they need 
is a browser to Faceboook. But, they don't want Linux. If you give them 
Linux they will complain about something else. They will want WMP, IE, 
and then be able to install .exe viruses. Linux users are like organic 
food buyers, clean water drinkers -- they make a conscious decision to 
use Linux because of its technical, social and political merits.

I wonder why we need non-free Microsoft products at all given their 
stand on competition and openness. Fortunately, we have projects like 
LibreOffice. We must boost LibreOffice and help polish it further 
instead of wasting time in discussing Microsoft's crapware. Buying M$ 
Widows copy for Linux is like feeding a shark only to come back and 
attack us.

Thomas Penfield Jackson, the presiding judge in U.S. v. Microsoft, said: 
"Most harmful of all is the message that Microsoft's actions have 
conveyed to every enterprise with the potential to innovate in the 
computer industry. Through its conduct toward Netscape, IBM, Compaq, 
Intel, and others, Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its 
prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm that 
insists on pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against 
one of Microsoft's core products. Microsoft's past success in hurting 
such companies and stifling innovation deters investment in technologies 
and businesses that exhibit the potential to threaten Microsoft. The 
ultimate result is that some innovations that would truly benefit 
consumers never occur for the sole reason that they do not coincide with 
Microsoft's self-interest."

I am afraid you have not understood the issue. A few points:

1. Most users do not own the computers they work on. They operate
computers owned by their employers. So they do not have a choice over
the software. If they are lucky to work with TNEB, they get to use
linux. This covers the vast majority of students and employees in bigger
enterprises. It also covers the vast majority of programmers. (and
probably most of the members of this list). For these people, the
software is paid for, so 'piracy' is not an issue.

2. Some people have computers of their own. The vast majority are not
aware that they have a choice of operating systems. This ignorance is
created by a carefully planned and well financed campaign by Microsoft.
Microsoft realises that this sector is not the main revenue generating
sector for it and so it encourages piracy. In their view it is better if
the users use pirated windows than use linux. All dealers are instructed
to try and sell legal software, failing which they are told to install
450 rupees windows. I recently bought a laptop which came with linpus
linux, and had to fight with the dealer to prevent him from installing a
'real' OS for 450 rupees. Microsoft does not raid individuals and
concerns below a certain size. It also turns a blind eye to smaller
training institutes. Most people are not even aware that they are using
illegal software.

3. There are a few people who are aware that they are using illegal
software. They belong in jail. (they are also the loudest proponents of
the idea that windows is better than linux).

Your query is ambiguous.   Most Linux distros are available as
templates by cloud computing service providers.

One such example:
<http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/servers/>
read the supported OS section

(I have no affiliation to rackspace)

OR

Is it that you want to implement a "private" cloud using centOS as
your base platform?

Ok, forgot to update. I have setup my VMware with CentOS and the

Message-ID: <CAFe1oo+JWij2sZOkK1w8iNe5Ri8Jtvs2SdkiVTT8gxtkCws5Og@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have an ARM based Linux SBC (Chumby hacker board,
http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10106).

For a personal project related to astronomy-imaging, I need to connect a
specific webcam (Philips SPC900) to it. The webcam will be placed inside a
telescope. The reason for choosing this out of production webcam (paying a
premium for it in ebay) is because it is one of the very few cameras that
support manual exposure time setting. We need long exposure for imaging
stars. The camera has a good linux driver (pwc.ko) for this. The problem is
that the SBC does not have a pre compiled binary for this. It would be
practically impossible for me to compile this driver from source because of
the dependencies and requirement of the kernel source code and all.

Any suggestion and help would be great!

It is difficult to use a regular x86 based PC for this because the entire
contraption is going to be placed on a remote location 80 kms from Chennai
in a farm with only a watchman. This is because I require dark skies. Power
consumption and reliability is of high priority. An Atom based PC booting
out of a pen drive will be my last option, though the simplest.

Regards,
Arun

<quote>

I think you should be able to use the grapheme_extract [1] function to
iterate over the combined characters (which are technically called
"grapheme clusters").

Alternatively, if you prefer the regex approach, I think you can use this:

preg_match_all('/\pL\pM*|./u', $str, $results)

where \pL means a Unicode "letter", and \pM means a Unicode "mark".

If possible try to cross compile kernel and drivers for ARM. If you compile
a new kernel it will not affect any user land applications. The best option
will be this.

Yes.  Don't you think it would help enterprises to have MS Office work on
Linux ? They might all migrate to Linux to reduce operational expenditure.
Windows licenses will expire in a few months anyway. So would they not
consider switching to Linux? And if they do, would that not be a good thing
for Free Software and Linux as a whole? I'm curious how this will pan out.

Agreed. Which is why Crysis works only on Windows.. Dang !!

I'm pretty sure that MS is deliberately turning a blind eye towards this
issue. Piracy is high in India. And if it becomes tough to pirate stuff,
there is no doubt that people will switch to  Linux and Free software.

People have choices, you know? They can basically do what they want to do.
I do not know of many 'idiots' that you speak of. Last time I wanted
someone to switch to Linux, he wanted to know if 3D games like Crysis, Half
Life, etc. Some one else had problems with his G-Force graphics card. And
people just want to get stuff done. They don't care about social, political

Again, people don't care. Not everyone is us. People have differing

Not everyone plays Crysis. Then you need very good hardware for Crysis. 
I have a GTX 470 with 8Gig RAM. I love Crysis and play it every time a 
new version comes out. I buy a copy from Amazon and finish it in 3-4 
hours. That's all I need Windows for "only 3-4 hours every year". For 
everything else I use GNU/Linux. The merits that I get from GNU/Linux 
outside gaming is unmatched. I have converted a lot of users from Windows.

This is one such user:
http://www.muktware.com/blogs/2773

When you talk about, gamers they are a minority in the PC world. 80% 
desktop users don't play such games. Most hard-core games have consoles.

Additionally, Crysis is not for Mac as well. No. In fact a lot of 
Windows apps are not available for Mac. Are Mac using turning into 
Windows users? No, the tide is going the other way round. So, that's not 
a valid reason.

However, people don't care doesn't mean those who care will stop caring. 
People in India don't care about personal hygene, clean drinking water. 
Does that mean no one should care? The protest for Lokpal Bill shows 
people DO care. But we shy away from our responsibility of educating 
them by saying 'who cares'.

In that case its even more important to invest our resources in changing 
their opinion instead of asking M$ to port M$Office to Linux.

What's the point of migrating to Linux when in the end you are going to 
use the product of a monopoly. It will only kill the efforts like 
LibreOffice and then the argument will be when all you are going to use 
is a Microsoft product then why don't just use Windows?

+1.

That's why RMS has been insisting on giving importance to *freedom* than
the other technical aspects. Now we are in a sorry state that even a "FOSS
enthusiast" in a LUG has forgotten the whole point of Free software and is
advocating for using M$ product on "Linux".

I have been holding my hands not to reply to this pointless conversation
started by an 'April fools day joke', but the previous arguments made me
reply.

Can we stop this pointless discussion and move on to something useful?

I don't think *freedom* means anti-proprietary. Even though it might 
advocate the use of free software over proprietary software, I don't 
think it intends to ban the usage of proprietary software. To give an 
example, NVIDIA provides its proprietary drivers for Linux and I use it 
because it works best for my hardware. So, the first thing I do after 
installation is nuke nouveau. This does not mean I have forgotten the 
point of free software.

IMHO, If someone wants to use a proprietary product with FOSS, so be it, 
denying this right to him/her would indeed be against the FOSS philosophy.

Yes, if you are not talking about *software* freedom.

No one is banning the usage of proprietary software here. Rather, the
companies that make proprietary software play cheap tricks to ensure that
computers are not usable without those proprietary software. And the
intention of the free software movement is to protect users from such a
lock, by developing free software equivalents.

There is no single thing called FOSS philosophy, there is *Free software
philosophy* and *Open source philosophy* which are very different, though
the technical definitions sound almost the same. If you really want to
understand the difference, read this quite long story [1].

Hi Arun,

It seems to me that your project is intriguing,
and it might be fun to improve a telescope's
useful resolution with an algorithm like lucky
imaging.

I do not have an answer to your reasonable
question, but it occurred to me that the IRC
channel ##astronomy on freenode might interest
you.

Good luck,
~K

Thanks for the information! I will try this. This is really interesting
because when we work with webcams, the resolution of the webcam itself is
extremely low and the seeing effects create a huge anomalies.

Dear all,

Myself conducted a one day Seminar on FOSS in Tagore engineering
college, Near vandalur on 09/01/12, for the 3rd year IT students.

Around 100+ students participated in the workshop.

Great but I think you are missing one piece of the puzzle.   You have
not mentioned any POP3/IMAP server above; without the POP3/IMAP server
how did you get Squirrelmail to work?

> ?but now my college want me to make it live

Hosting an email server is *not* trivial.  I am not referring to the
setup but to the ongoing admin support you will have to provide.

Request  your college to buy you bottles of antacid and pain relief
medicines.   A small oops somewhere on your part will land in the
DNSBL (aka RBL) lists <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL>.

Some of us have gone through this exercise at some point in our career
and have concluded that it is best to out source this function.

May I ask what is the objective of this?

> ?guys , i need your guideline for that
>
> ?what should i do for that , do i need to buy domain and live ip or both ??

Domain - yes.

Static IP - yes.

DNS hosting - yes  (read up on BIND and how to setup DNS records SOA,
NS, MX, A).  Alternately, you can avail of free DNS hosting.  Search
this list archive - it has been discussed at least a couple of times
in the past IIRC.

CentOS is a good platform for an email server.

Read up on:

SASL Auth
openSSL for certificates (to allow encrypted connections)
open email relays
How to remove your IP from DNSBL (RBL).
Grey/White listing.

Besides the above, some sites require that both forward and reverse IP
match to the same FQDN otherwise they do not accept messages from your
site.   You will have to work with your ISP to create PTR record for
the range of IPs you buy.

Sounds like fun?

Post your experience if you decide to go ahead with it.

Otherwise buy  a web hosting plan that allows unlimited (or close to
it) email addresses.

Best,
-- Arun Khan

not necessarily. Setting up postfix+dovecot+everything else is a pain.
But once set up it is dead easy to host any number of virtual domains
and users and have complete control.

Try ZCS community version.  The setup is not too complex provided you answer
a few questions correctly at install time.
You still need the DNS infra in place which the OP may not be aware of.

Each to his own.

I did mention "some of us" and not "all of us"

How many times have had to get your IP number delisted from some RBL
or the other?

         I guess, by "Out source", he meant "leaving it in the hands
of people who know these things well". Though it is easy to host all
that, it is definitely not easy to maintain it. You need to be careful
and have anti-spam techniques enabled to fight spam. Otherwise, we
will end up being black listed. Thanks.

Do you mean you want to use Centos on the host and any other OS as the guest

or

you just want a centos instance in a cloud?

In the first case (which implies you want the cloud to be hosted and
controlled by you), serious infrastructure (supporting KVM) and work
on KVM and other virtualization is required. The host OS should
necessarily be 64 bit.

Not to mention the HA for VM migration and that implies external storage.

You will also need to do some real work on networking (storage, HA and data).

If you want support, you may want to look at RHEV.

In second case, all you need is just to clone Centos (preferably)

In any case go with Centos 6.2

         What about bounce addresses?. For eg., If I get hold of some
open relay and send hundreds of mails with imagined RCPT TOs, with
MAIL FROM set to yourid at yourdomain, unless you have some mechanism
like SPF and Bounce address validation(BATV) the users are going to
suffer a lot. Thanks

is setting that up a big problem? In the old days domains used to be
blacklisted without much evidence. Nowadays I see that if a mailserver
gets a mail purporting to be from my domain, it verifies to see whether
the said mail *actually* comes from the IP of my domain.

        Yes, they use stuff like SPF, DKIM etc. Setting them up is not
a big problem. But neither is it trivial.

        You need to know what problem you are trying to solve to
decide on the technology to use. If you just want to check the
ip/domain thing that you mentioned above, you need to use SPF. But if
the spammer sends to a domain that doesn't check for SPF/DKIM, and the
RCPT TO sent by the spammer doesn't exist(very likely), you will
receive a bounce mail. And if the spammer had done say 20 invalid RCPT
TOs, you will receive as many bounces. When you run your own servers,
you need to take care of all these scenarios.

        The bigger problem is that the adoption of such techniques is
not high. And a few claim that these techniques are controversial as
well. But may be, I am going off topic with this whole bunch of mails.
Sorry :( Thanks

To answer the OP, have you looked at CrossOver 
(http://www.codeweavers.com/)? I know of people who run licensed MS 
Office using CrossOver in CentOS and it works pretty well.

This only solves the problem partially.   Other users on a  shared
host may get your IP listed in RBL.

My point to the OP was simple - he needs to understand what is
involved in administering an email server before he jumps into putting
it up on the Internet.

You may have the experience and the time to host and administer an
email server on the Internet; from his post it does not appear that he
has.

Subject: [chennai.rb] [semi-commercial] Looking for article contributions
to techbot (www.techbot.in)
To: <chennairb at googlegroups.com>

We (techbot.in) are planning to launch a free weekly technical newspaper
(hybrid* - in print as well as digital form). We are primarily targeting
the print version at tech parks, educational institutes and conferences. I
am looking for articles that would be of interest to the general audience.

To give you some idea of what I have in mind here are few possible sections
(open to suggestions):

   - *Cheat sheets*: Regular cheat sheets for the general audience,
   - *Language/framework special *: Info graphic style description of
   unique features of a language or framework. eg, mechanism & utility of
   message passing in Erlang,
   - *Inside a XXXX*: How does a particular system work, how to build your
   own, architecture of OSS eg, web server, web framework, parser, compiler,
   device driver, DBMS.
   - *Exotic systems and concepts*: Something that not everyone gets to see
   in their everyday life, something that have their own unique challenges :
   Telecom systems, real time systems, embedded systems, travel reservation
   systems/financial systems.
   - *Others*: of interest "inside a Kinect", "inside a set-top box"

If you have neat ideas or articles but need some help with laying it out or
represent it graphically, we would be glad to take your notes and turn it
into articles.

A link to our temporary page : www.techbot.in

* PS*: The intention of this paper is to close the gap between students,
engineers, techies, industries and startups - and to help them find each
other. Though this is not a IT specific paper, a substantial number of
sections cover CS/IT, as the target group is expected to find this the most
useful.
Also we would be glad to take commercial advertisements, it would be
particularly effective for Job ads to reach out to a wide group who are not
exactly scourging monster or naukri for their next job.. Though more
expensive than posting on naukri (half or quarter page Ads), it is a lot
more effective and saves days of effort spent on interviews particularly
when you plan on a 'big'  ramp up but don't get the 'right' talent. Equally
true for those of you looking to advertise your products and don't want to
wait for months to reach the minimum user base.

**hybrid* - We plan to use the print version to reach out and to keep the
fire burning but expect the bulk of the readership to shift to the digital
version.

Message-ID: <4F0DB2EC.1000108@madtechsupport.com>

This role is suitable for someone looking to work in a small consultancy 
firm visiting numerous high profile customers across Chennai and 
representing the "Google" brand.  The right candidate will possess not 
only the required technical skills but also the right non-technical 
skills such as good English, neat presentation and most importantly a 
positive attitude towards work and life.

This is an excellent opportunity for someone with around 5 years 
experience who is in a job where they feel that that have pretty much 
learned everything about the role.  If you are interested in breaking 
out of your office and seeing more of Chennai then please visit :

Open source and free software derives its value from pedagogy, at
least that is my take on them. But then the learning curve on
linux-distros are quite steep and fortunately distros like Ubuntu and
programming environments like python are making it little bit easier.
Still for those who want to know the _machine_ better nothing like
having a Turbo-C  / DOS environment ;)

Let me try to provide some of the projects I am working on. All of
them programmed in python, tested and released for linux (more
specifically ubuntu), under GPLv3 license, and the context of
development is Web-Technology.

Eazytext : A wiki processor. It defines a wiki markup similar to the
popular ones, with pluggable macros and extensions.  Web is all about
content and wiki is the easiest way to generate rich content.
http://eazytext.pluggdapps.com/.

Tayra : A web templating lanugage. Incorporates the best of HAML (in
ruby) and Mako (in python), it helps developers to develop, package
and distribute their templates as plugins. It also embodies some
interesting ideas related to web templating.
http://tayra.pluggdapps.com/

Tayra Styles : CSS scripting language similar to SCSS (or SASS). Goes
hand in hand with Tayra's pluggable templates. Yet to be released.

For students and programmers who want to learn parsing techniques, AST
transformations, stack machines etc. eazytext, tayra and tayra-styles
can be nice introductions.

I am aware of that. And there is also 'playonlinux' which is more popular
when running MS Office. But they are not without glitches.

Subject: [Ilugc] torque unable to copy error on nfs
Message-ID: <CAPV1RAB=0UpUZzTix0YyG15E_Jk6FStbbO=VAh0hk3iG7YUu1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I am using torque and maui set up on a custom cluster.
But when i run a qsub job, it exits and completes the job with no log files.

qstat -f  spews this error:

Unable to copy file:
/var/spool/torque/spool/132.myhost.OU  to /clstr/work/myjob.pbs.132

I have checked my torque cluster setup and  I have bidirectional access -
to and fro  between  masternode  and cluster nodes without a password.
The same user account with identical uid/gid is also on all the compute
nodes.
I am running jobs on a a nfs mounted partition (/clstr) visible across all
compute nodes. pbsnodes -l shows all the compute nodes in free state.
looks like this is an issue with torque  unable to write to
/var/spool/torque/spool. This dir has 2777 permission and I could manually
copy to this dir.

Am I missing something  in the configuration ? please let me know.

Regards,
KM

Hi,

If the proxy works and you can't able to install software from apt-get try 
to rename the folder lists to lists.old. path= /var/lib/apt/lists.

Then run the command sudo apt-get update.

Then try to install the software from sudo apt-get install.

Thanks,
V. Karthick

Yes. It can also be an existing software or language which you have used
and think that will be useful to others. You can demonstrate how to set up
the particular software and how to to use it and other related stuff.

David,

There are no good institutes. However to get a software job you don't
require all that.

An academic background in one of the core branches is desirable but
certainly not a must.

Ask him to do some self learning, use the Internet, browse and learn on his own.

The US Govt has laws that help it to get more info than 'is
provided'/'is not provided' to other countries as per the
'fake/not-fake memos'.

Skype, of course freely provides all the info to all the Govts.

http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-20019011-83.html also says something.

Message-ID: <4F0F6B5B.1010707@gmail.com>

I hope this is not off-topic for this Linux mailing list. I would like
some help for Kile.
I run Kile 2.1 Beta on a Suse Linux 11.3 using KDE. I do not get the
log-messages window when I start Kile. How do I activate the
log-messages window so that I can see my errors (I make many errors) as
my soyrce is compiled ? Can someone guide me please ?

Or, is there some way to read the log file from within Kile ?

Thanks a lot,

partha

Hello everyone!

There's a Wikipedia Hackathon being planned in Chennai on March 17th,
2012. It's a 'Wikipedia'/WikiProjects hackathon, rather than a
MediaWiki hackathon - hacks of various types utilizing the Wikipedia
API/Data are what we are looking at.

You can find more details here:
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Chennai_Hackathon_March_2012

Suggestions for hacks that the community would find useful are
welcome. Registrations are open, so please do sign up if you are
interested!

Note: This is *not* an official WMF sponsored workshop, just something
the a few of us are putting up (me, Srikanth Lakshmanan and the
members of the Chennai Geeks community).

This should not happen. MS can monopoly over user (and OEMs). This should
change or some way to remove the feature (or replace UEFI with custom boot
firmware like CoreBoot must be created as a worst case step).

not sure how many people will want to be contacted like this ( I prefer
to see something in an open forum / list rather than over personal emails )

Even if there is such an institute, I'd recommend spending a month or so
trying to learn the basic stuff from the Internet. This would greatly
accelerate learning later on.

he wants to ensure that the lecturers are good.


Lectures are useless. hands-on is the only thing that helps.

In short none of the institutes are any good , In fact I can say with some
experience that they are quite bad.

There is the odd chance that you may find a good lecturer  at a College or
one of the Institutes , but they are few and very rare.

My recommendation: Get help from friends and Internet is also a Very Good
friends when learning Coding .
There are also some special Friend like Mailing Lists (ILUGC) , and sites
like http://stackoverflow.com/ which also help a lot .

Vow ! Never knew that such queries are possible with GitHub, not that
I am a git-user but kind of fascinated with its idea anyway. Now,
wouldn't it be nice for programmers to shed their humility or come off
their stealth mode and brandise their programming prowess ?

After a quick look, I can spot 2 projects, one hyde which seem to have
a clean code base, and the other called Clay programming language
which is a brave attempt to crop a new systems language.

Depends on what you mean by that - emailing those people would, imho, be
a case of Unsolicited Contact. If you were to personalise it about their
work or comment on specific projects - its all good.

But sending an email to everyone on github who identifies themselves as
being in Chennai with a 'I added you to a list' is a bit naughty.

Given the fact that there are many programmers in this part of the
world associated with so many projects, I am requesting them to come
out on this mailing-list and brag about their project.

this is not a very good indicator as many teams writing proprietary
software use github.

different people learn things in different ways. You are entitled to
express your opinion on what works for you. You are not entitled to
rubbish what works for others. 90% of people, if asked, will point to
someone who has taught and inspired them. I have never watched a video
tutorial for more than a few seconds - but I know people who are
incapable of learning something without a video tutorial.

Because a lot of people uses trains to travel to work and back, does not
make train travel a business only mode of transport.

I made this remark because it shows a large number of people from
Chennai are members of github, and if an all India search is done, it
will show a huge number from India. Of these users, in my opinion, less
than 5% are contributors to open source. I recognise many names in the
list - some of them are the real good contributors, and most of them are
on this mailing list. I also recognise quite a few guys from firms that
require every developer to get a github id. Therefore the best place to
search for contributors from Chennai is this mailing list. The problem
is to get them to come forward and brag. This is difficult because
except for a few who have made really huge or significant contributions,
the rest of us feel that what we have done or are doing is no big deal.
The only solution is for friends of those who contribute to come forward
with the info.

As for your analogy, if you want to know the number of people who travel
by train to go bird watching, it is foolish to watch the trains and try
to identify the 0.0001 percentage of the travelers who are going to
watch birds - it is far easier to go to the bird sanctuary and find out
the number of people there who commute by train.

Well said. Although, I don't think there is one place where we can find 
open source contributors. May be, what we need first is to compile a 
list of reliable sources where one can find such contributors.

this is the best place (and chennaipy and chennai ruby group). I will
start the ball rolling:

Jaganad H has made good contributions to NLP
Kumar Appaiah - debian
Yuvi Panda - OSM and python stuff
Shakthi Kannan - a one man army of myriad contributions
Girish - spam cheetah
Raman - he is in cpan
Srinivasan's brother (I forget his name) 

there are many more - will add them as and when I remember.

That's exactly we are working on. But we do need active support from the 
community to recommend contributors. We are very ambitious with this 
project. Have been planning for ever but now started executing after 
analyzing everything. If you are a contributor please do add your profile.

I believe all the main rooms are being video'd again this year ( more
than were last year ) and should be on the Fosdem website a few days later.

I've been there every year for about 8 years not, except for the one
year when they decided it would be funny to change the date so as to
have it ON the day i was getting married!.... anyway, the big thing
about Fosdem is that commercial vendors, other than the few sponsors,
are left out and there are massive opportunities to network face to face
and talk to people about ideas and where open source as a while is
going. The flip side is that this also means that very few companies
will sponsor people over. The ones that do are the ones who are
themselves active in the open source arena ( and apart from the big
linux distros ) are people who dont represent the IT industry itself!

nutshell : if you can, get there, it might not further your job
prospects any, but it would sure be a fantastic learning experience -
and dont worry, too much, about the talks, focus on the social events
thats where the real open source conversations take place.

Yes. I am in touch with their Press team and they will be recording it. 
We missed last year's event as we were moving to Brussels and arrived 
there a week later.

Will look forward to meet you there then. Your interview with us is

re-read my original reply, I recommended that as a place to start from -
not an exhaustive list, of people who might be local. Also, the
advantage of a github lookup is that it allows you to look at the code
these people are working with, which then gives people the advantage of
considering what these people are doing and also create a route of contact.

You might respond best to random requests, but I tend to prefer spending
time working with people who have already seen what I am doing and come
through with either a patch of a feature conversation that is relevant
to me.

step,1 however, would be having a positive outlook and the willingness
to actually do something. Open Source is driven by people who come from
two very specific mindets : (a) those who are either sponsored to do so,
or people who are working on open source as a part of their job and (b)
people who are looking to solve and resolve specific issues that *they*
have run into or inherited, either for work for otherwise. There are a
lot of other people who contribute as well. But code resilience and
drive comes almost exclusively from these two sets of people.

(a) is easy to work with, find a relevant job.
(b) is harder, and the effort into that needs to come from the ecosystem
around the code, not the one guy/girl who happens to be working flat out
day/night doing that he/she needs and in a way that makes him/her happy.
Make this easier and the 'everyone else' will beat a path when and how
they need to.

And finally, open source isnt just about Code, its also about the entire
ecosystem that facilities this code exchange, use, feedback and
communities. Lots of the 'people' involved at various levels are solving
their own specific issues, join them with constructive feedback and make
it easy for people to bridge the gap from user to abuser to contributor,
and we all win. Create silo's and everyone loses.

I wasent, just as the OP, looking for your opinion. that link points to
a set of people who's code ( or lack of ) is very visible. Look at it,
treat it as you will and move on. Your opinion is a bit redundant here.

Sure, and you will find them as they get off the train at the sanctuary
entrance. Did you confuse yourself a bit trying to come up with an
analogy  ?

and all I said is the best place to start with are the bird sanctuaries
like ilugc and chennaipy.

you have much more experience in this area - but as far as India is
concerned, the people in 'a' only contribute as long as the money is
available.

this very true - unfortunately in India a few people have misunderstood
linus's 'show me the code' quote and a lot of their clueless followers
still believe that only those who write code are contributing to open
source.

what are you getting uptight about? You stated an opinion. I stated an

Message-ID: <CANc+2y7=V2YryztYz9A071anUOu=7XhTdUE=QuSuwv8LuGbhGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using Linux Mint 12 (which is based on Ubuntu 11.10). I am getting
artifacts in screen while doing casual work. This happens when using compiz
(unity) or gnome 3 (both use OpenGL). When using gnome 2 without compiz (3D
effects) things are fine. I raised a bug in Ubuntu and Mint but no
response. Can anyone help in resolving this? I am using Intel 82945G
graphics card (i915 driver). I have tried Linux kernel 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 all
have the same issues. Running Mesa 7.11.

Here is the screen-shot "
https://launchpadlibrarian.net/86979473/Screenshot%20at%202011-12-08%2022%3A40%3A32.png".
I have just opened a file manager and ran glxgears. The screen is
completely filled with some random junk. When I pressed "print screen" some
part got cleared and you can see it.

Please feel free to ask for more info if needed.

Thanks,
Prasanna Kumar T S M

EFYTimes are clueless. Initially they mislead readers about it being the 
best tablet and then bashed it for being bad. Please don't quote such 
irresponsible media. They are polly run by a bunch of trainees.

When I talked to Linus Torvalds he said that Secure Boot is a good 
thing, but can be used in a bad ways. That's proving to be true.

When Microsoft published The Certification Requirements for Windows 8 it 
was evident that the company wanted to use the secure boot to lock Linux 
out of such hardware, thus creating a Windows only hardware. The 
discovery lead to a strong protest from the FLOSS community. Microsoft 
allowed the non-ARM hardware to be able to run Linux if the hardware 
vendors chooses to allow that. But as we saw the arrival of ARM on 
desktop Microsoft "wasted no time in revising its Windows Hardware 
Certification Requirements to effectively ban most alternative operating 
systems on ARM-based devices that ship with Windows 8."

Please substantiate. I don't seem to find the article that says it was
the best tablet. To me, it appears that you don't have a balanced view
of ANYTHING at all. All this from the editor of a reputed free-software
site. Off topic: Do all the people who do not use free software appear
to be retards in your view?? Just curious..

IMHO email, mailing-list and source repositories are the main ways to
propagate thoughts and programs, and by tracking them it is possible
to track people behind them. If I were you, I would go about doing the
following things,

* Pull any many threads as possible from relevant mailing lists.
* Pull repositories for software under Ubuntu, PyPi, CPAN and relevant
package stores.
* Start curing the information and populate them in your data-store.
* Expose cured information via web-application, media articles etc ...

Of course others have already solved these problems, but if you are
serious enough it should not be a deterant here. Do share your
strategies with us, that way you might gain better traction.

All in all it is a good initiative.

Is this forward illegitimate (as per the note) ? Every one makes 
mistakes which is fine but just to understand the legal perspective, is 
that an accurate note which should be followed or is it just a paranoid 
original poster ?

Happy Pongal everyone.

Thanks. I am either way conducting interviews of such people so that I 
can also understand and talk about what they are doing and then invite 
then to enter data about themselves. This way they get aware of the list 
and I get more info about them and their work which we can tell the 
world through articles.

Thanks for your pointers, will work on those as well.

Dear all

Past few months have been hectic learning phase for me - html,js,tt,perl-dancer framework, ngnix, starman etc on IT side and Tamil Epigraphy(highly perlish) on the hobby side.  

Based on this I have written a small js+html tool to convert numbers in the present form into ancient tamil form. You can download it here

https://github.com/downloads/raaman/Tamil-Numeral/tamilnumbers.html

I am intending to enlarge to project.

To understand how numbers were written till 19th Century you can read

You have to update (or add) your ip address to the domain name. You can get
info for those from the domain name vendor itself. Once this is done after
a one day hitting your domain will give your page properly.

You are not going to do port forwarding. You should configure a DMZ host.

You can buy a domain from www.net4.in for around 500/- a year or
 you could buy from someone else and point your static to it.

Registering the domain name is only for ownership. You have to specify 
the name servers which can resolve your domain name. In many cases, the 
registrar themselves provide DNS services using which you can specify 
the A record to resolve to an IP.

If your registrar don't provide DNS services, you might have to get a 
DNS solution elsewhere or setup one yourself. Once you know the 
IP/hostname of the nameserver (DNS server), you can update it with the 
registrar.

On a side note, You don't necessarily need a static ip if you can live 
with 2 mins downtime/day in case of a dynamic ip.

I hope you have tested your setup by connecting with the IP directly 
before purchasing the domain.

Sugar, the OLPC UI and the code around it is open source, so the new
upgraded 700Mhz AaKash should be able to run it anyway ? if its a s/w
issue, its easily fixed down that route.

Does anyone know what the reasons to drop Aakash really are/where ? it
looks, from this end, that politics got in the way.

The production costs are still less.

Message-ID: <4F143C6B.8030004@gmail.com>

http://www.muktware.com/news/3217/did-microsoft-just-kill-ubuntu-tablets

There is no doubt that Canonical is looking at the ARM based hardware 
for its tablets. But Microsoft seemed to have nipped Ubuntu's Tablet in 
the bud. The company tweaked its Windows Hardware Certification 
Requirements to effectively ban most alternative operating systems on 
ARM-based devices that ship with Windows 8.

On page 116 of Microsoft's The Certification Requirements, there is a 
clear instructions for hardware vendors that under no circumstance 
should the installation of another OS be permitted.

     MANDATORY: Disabling Secure MUST NOT be possible on ARM systems.

This is assumingly the platform Ubuntu was looking for. So, does that 
mean Microsoft just killed all the possibilities of ARM-based Ubuntu 
Tablets?

The question is: Why would  ARM PC manufacturers pay any value to Microsoft's certification? I feel they have no special incentive. If the ARM PCs support Linux, so much the better for the sales of that platform. Unlike the Wintel platform, ARM mfrs IMHO do not need the label of Microsot to sell themselves.

Of course they do.  It is foolish that Microsoft will not become
relevant for ARM soon. Not in the same level obviously but hardware
manufacturers are certainly not ignoring the requirements.  There
already is hardware being released that is certified.

ctrl+'L' works fine for me .

Try checking the keyboard shortcuts on the terminal you are using and
also check the profile preferences in the tab Compatibility.

You should try using the default settings.

Application: AutoWifi

What it is:

AutoWifi is a useful application that allows Linux users to login
automatically to free WiFi hotspots that require web-based
authentication. Working in the systray, AutoWifi will login securely
to a hotspot once an SSID is matched.

This will make you avoid the hassle of web-based authentications for
free hotspots and make your connection longer as if you are connecting
via a LAN.

To know more about:

http://www.manatlan.com/page/autowifi

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install python-distutils-extra
wget -O autowifi_0.1-public29_all.deb http://goo.gl/GjfXL
sudo dpkg -i autowifi_0.1-public29_all.deb

Use the Unity Dash to start AutoWifi.

         By any chance are you using vi key bindings ? If so, press
the ESC key and then do Ctrl + L. You need to press 'i' again to start
typing :). Otherwise, if you are comfortable enough with the default
key bindings(emacs), then do

set -o emacs

 in your bashrc file. That would solve the problem. Thanks

It is most likely something to do with the terminal type you have set, 
What is your current terminal type ?

echo $TERM

Find a exact same model from some junkyard.

Yank the controller board on the HDD.

If it spins, you are lucky.

If it doesn't, it needs an equivalent of brain surgery like replacing
the spindle motor and the such which are best left to the expensive
data recovery specialists.

I tried wordpress. its really nice and easy to use.  I developed the
website in few days.
Are they any such framework which just use php  alone (without
mysql),html,stylesheet.
Because my website doesnt require mysql (no database related activity) ,
Also  hosting cost is high with database support.
(For ex: without mysql support, just 500Rs per year(approx). with mysql
support 1600Rs per year(approx)).

Please share your suggestions.

Thanks
suresh.

I have issues accessing wordpress from another machine than the one on
which it is installed.

It is not showing the same homepage.

Does wordpress require a resolvable FQDN on the internet or from a Local Server.

Any help appriciated.

TIA

There is a recovery service place at Vijayanagar Velachery. Opposite the
bus terminus. If you have valuable data, just take it there and see what
can be done.

Anecdote:  I've had the same problem quite long ago and all hopes were lost
of recovering anything from it. One of my friends jokingly tapped the
hard-disk against the wall saying "work, you piece of crap! work!". It
worked ! :) As a last ditch effort I tried attaching the disk and it
started spinning. We could recover only (atleast) some data. But I'd
recommend against trying anything of that sort before you have given the
recovery service a shot..

Try having a bigger swap (4 GB). I remember reading some where that you
need good amount of swap.

another way to try is to seal it in a waterproof bag and freeze for 12
hours. Then thaw and try - make absolutely sure nothing inside gets wet.

If you put it in the freezer, there will be condensation INSIDE the hard
disk. No?

And since Android, iOS and Linux still form majority of ARM based
devices, I wonder if any manufacturer would be brave(stupid?) enough
to lock these OS's out.

If that is so, let manufacturers sell devices with pre-installed
Windows, which have this feature. You would anyway not want to pay

Dear Friends,

The Free Software Foundation, Tamil Nadu(FSFTN) is proud to announce

to spread awareness of the importance and advantages of free software
in various fields such as education, public policy and health care.
Our activities include workshops, community computing centres and
partnerships with institutions in the use and promotion of free
software. It is in this context that we are honoured to host such a
famous figure.

This would be an ideal opportunity to like-minded groups,
organizations, technical groups, users groups, and its members in and
around Chennai to join hands and utilize this opportunity to spread
the knowledge on Free Software to as many people as we can. If you as
an individual feel you can help us in any possible means, we would be
happy to have you with us.

Hi Sir !
This is Dwaraka Nath from Mozilla India. We've met during the SFD 2011 @ MIT, Chennai. Hope you remember me ! 
Stallman's visit is truly a great opportunity to meet him. We'll be very happy to assist you for the event preparations. As for the sponsorship of the Event, I'll have to ask people up the hierarchy on what can be done, if that is possible. Please share the details of event on what is to be done, how Mozilla can be of any help, so I can make some move officially. 
Even if sponsoring the event is not possible, we would be happy to have some kind of stall or help you in organizing the event. 
Feel free to ask for help :)
Thanks, Dwaraka.

arun,

we have to encourage the new people when the come forward to help on such
events.

mozilla can help or not. how can we judge it?

though fsftn organizes the event, we are part of the event. any one can
reply in our mailing list to help such events.

we welcome volunteers always.

thanks.

Subject: [Ilugc] openSUSE Going On SOPA Strike, Who Else?
Message-ID: <4F15FCFD.2060909@gmail.com>

http://www.muktware.com/news/3224/opensuse-going-sopa-strike

It's great to see that the openSUSE community (I started using openSUSE 
once Novell took its last breath) has taken a stand against SOPA/PIPA.

The Open Source/Free Software community is going on strike on 18th Jan, 
2012, to protest against the dangerous SOPA and PIPA bills.

But ain't SOPA Dead?
SOPA has been put on the back burner for a while amid all these online 
protests. But the war is not over yet. The bill may be pulled out once 
the politicians gets something better to distract citizens. The chances 
are that the congressmen may try to slip the provisions of SOPA in some 
anti-terrorism bill. The 'Little Boy' PIPA is still kicking and the 
'corporate' politicians may try to pass it this week.

openSUSE team has announced a one day strike to protest against SOPA. 
The openSUSE website says, "We hope the decision to blackout 
openSUSE.org will educate people around the world about this issue that 
threatens the basics of the Internet, will make some US based 
contributors, friends and users contact their representatives in 
congress and inspire others to join the strike."

Muktware.com will be protesting against SOPA and PIPA in a unique way.

Try to isolate the problem, check whether the behavior is similar on all 
applications on the terminal such as on vi/emacs. Also, try typing 
CTRL-V CTRL-L on bash prompt, you should see ^L output on the terminal.

what terminal emulator are you using gnome-terminal or xterm or (?).

Try setting the terminal type as linux using the following command and 
see if it works,

$ TERM=linux bash

Message-ID: <4F168484.9070007@0throot.com>


I don't get it, why did wikipedia decide to do a partial blackout ? I 
was under the impression that they will take the domain offline or 
something more serious. This SOPA overlay seems more like a child's play 
(technically) than anything else.

If you haven't noticed, the following div is added to the end of the 
wikipedia pages which of course one can stop from loading by just 
pressing ESC.

<div id="mw-sopaOverlay">
   <div id="mw-sopaColumn">
     <div id="mw-sopaHeadline">
     <div id="mw-sopaText">
     <div id="mw-sopaAction">
   </div>
</div>

I am sure there is a reason behind it, but just can't seem to figure it 
out..

I am sure there are several other websites where one can find such 
stuff, it may not be as organised or ad-free as wikipedia but they 
should be able to manage for one day.

I also thought at a similar angle but don't find it compelling enough.

Subject: [Ilugc] Microsoft, Apple Protest SOPA?
Message-ID: <4F16948F.6080002@gmail.com>

It's humor piece to mock supporters of SOPA/PIPA.

To protest against SOPA/PIPA, Apple is announcing two models of the 
iPhone and the iPad with jet black back and STOP SOPA/PIPA engraved on 
it. The devices are available immediately and the $100 extra ($100 + the 
original price) that you will pay for each device will be donated to 
Apple's internal law enforcement department which fights the patent and 
copyright cases.

Read story here: http://www.muktware.com/blogs/3226/apple-joins-sopa-protest

The technical team of Microsoft came up with a solution. "We did not 
have to do much and it will have deeper impact than Wikileak's blackout. 
According to our funded survey 10 people visit Wikipedia every 30 
seconds compare that with Windows BSoD (Blue Screen of Death). There are 
30 BSoDs every 10 seconds, around the globle. This is a massive power 
and we can exploit it."

websites. Here are the top 5 open source communities protesting SOPA and 
PIPA

Distros include: Fedora, openSUSE, Mageia. Interestingly Ubuntu is

The link to Fedora has been pointing to fedora.org (a private site)

Dear 0;
Tried Ctl+v-returns v.
Tried Ctl+l-3 times in a row, clears screen on the 3rd or 4th attempt.
I was using the consonle mode, problem exists in the GUI as well, instead of Ctl+Alt+F1, returns
Alt+F1/F2 etc; find I have to log out to get the console.
Set TERM=linux bash as you suggested, no change.
Tried vi; Ctl+R which is used to recycle between windows does not respond!
Maybe the Ctl key is defective; will try a new keyboard!
   Thanks

I've spent some time with python; mostly with django (developed few
production ready sites ). However I want to explore more possibilities with
python( especially network programming; heard a lot about twisted).
I'm looking for a personal guide who is passionate about python and would
help me get passionate too.
I'm hungry for only one thing; real KNOWLEDGE!

a fun way of learning a language is by trying out projecteuler.net. I
have only reached no 11, but my python skills have increased manifold.

        Being related to the Internet, my understanding is that it
would impact every one equally. Correct me if I am wrong. Thanks

Hi,

A friend needs guidance in migrating their MS Windows based office systems
to a Ubuntu based one. There are 20-30 systems involved. They have the
resources to do the grunt work (like installing, configuring, etc). But
they need an experienced hand who can guide them on the right way to do
things ex. data backup strategy, the process, system updates etc.

It's a paid short term assignment and they want it done yesterday (who
doesn't?).

Pls respond to my mail id.

thanks,
mano

IMO, the consequences of our govt legal threats to Google, Facebook et al,
disregarding Safe Harbour policies is much more damaging than SOPA/PIPA!

Being a large and diverse country it is natural that every piece of content
on the web will displease a few thousand people. If all these content have
to be taken down there will be no need for any search engine - there will
be no content except for bland govt sites!

I think the govt (in fact the whole 'establishment') wants to undermine the
power of the internet to prevent Anna Hazare, Arab Spring kind of
movements  before it starts shaking the foundations of their (the
establishment's) charmed existence.

Similar to how TV was once considered or is considered as an 
interference in one's education (morally/culturally/etc..). Internet is 
also a major interference for the younger generation. In a country where 
all of public broadcasting is PG-13, it is only expected that internet 
will eventually be regulated. The important question is how this 
happens. IMO, the public internet at large should be kept open but the 
individual residences should be able to decide on the package they need, 
this is currently not possible. Also, how does one incorporate such 
diverse views of the population ? All the firewall and other solutions 
out there are very local and don't work at a large scale considering 
internet is now present everywhere phones, laptops, TV etc..

Hi Warren,

Look like you have experience in setting up asterix for PSTN Line
also. Can you please clarify my doubts.

My requirements are below.

1. I have 2 PSTN Lines which needs to be terminated in asterixpbx. [
So Which Card should I need to buy]
2. I need minimum 2 GSM Sim needs to be connected to asterixpbx [ So
Which Car Should I need to buy].

I am very new to setting up asterix with pstn/gsm cards, but worked
sometime back on just sip solution for small office.
Also this setup is not for Call Center and just for small office setup.

Any recommedations on Cheap SIP Phone Hardware in india?

1) Sangoma is the best option, although you can use Digium cards.

& Academicians benefit by Creating, Configuring (with themes, background
etc) ,Sharing with Social networking  sites, Online ticketing & Managing
user registrations via My Dashboard their events like Seminars,
Symposiums,Culturals,Workshops,Conference etc. You can have a look at
http://www.allsymposium.com



*Speaker Profile: Senthil kumar*



Before moving in to Open Source Applications & technologies, he has worked
in Several Industries and on various Proprietary Enterprise Applications
for over a decade. Have Implemented large Scale projects across the Globe

Application: View Your Mind (vym)

What it is:

Vym is a mind mapping program. It is useful to organize thoughts and
do structure work. In addition to that it has a lot of helpful
shortcuts.

A mindmap is a multicolored and image centered radial diagram that
represents semantic or other connections between portions of learned
material.  For example, it can graphically illustrate the structure
of a thesis outline, a project plan, or the government institutions
in a state.  Mindmaps have many applications in personal, family,
educational, and business situations.  Possibilities include
note-taking, brainstorming, summarizing, revising and general
clarifying of thoughts.

Topic:  Introduction to Regular Expressions


In computing, a regular expression provides a concise and flexible means
for "matching" (specifying and recognizing) strings of text, such as
particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. Abbreviations for
"regular expression" include "regex" and "regexp". The concept of regular
expressions was first popularized by utilities provided by Unix
distributions, in particular the editor ed and the filter grep.[citation
needed] A regular expression is written in a formal language that can be
interpreted by a regular expression processor, which is a program that
either serves as a parser generator or examines text and identifies parts
that match the provided specification. Historically, the concept of regular
expressions is associated with Kleene's formalism of regular sets,
introduced in the 1950s.

Description:

The Wikimedia India Chapter (Registered Name: Wikimedia Chapter) is an

educate the general Indian public about the availability and use of free
and open educational content, which includes the ability to access, develop
and contribute to encyclopaedias, dictionaries, books, images, etc. It is

from within the community and enable volunteers to take their work beyond
what they can do individually, besides providing the benefit of a formal
organisational set-up. While independent, chapters are recognised by the
Wikimedia Foundation.

Wikimedia India was formally approved by the Board of Trustees, Wikimedia
Foundation after the recommendation of the Chapters Committee in June 2010
and India became the 29th country to host a Wikimedia Chapter. The
Wikimedia Chapter was formally registered as a Non-profit Society vide
Registrar of Societies, Bangalore Urban District on 03 Jan 2011.

Hi all,
         Based on my conversations with many others, I realized that many
people are not aware of the existence of different Wikimedia India/ India
related mailing lists.

A consolidated list of all known mailing lists ( India related) is made
here.

http://wiki.wikimedia.in/Mailing_Lists

This info page was originally curated by Arun Ram, I have updated it with
latest information.

Feel free to share this information with others and also join the mailing
lists of your interest.

Message-ID: <CA+xw+Kiw7QWRdjdsXd1h+L1ySD3QsEex9XLQRGjaRey--9xgpQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Are there places on the web where FOSS projects that need volunteers can
post their requirements?
I've come across http://sourceforge.net/people/helpwanted-latest.php but it
seems to be a very small list and mentions only SF projects.

Is there some online directory that lists such projects across multiple
source code hosts?

List comprehension
Dictionary comprehension, Set comprehension
Anonymous functions
Iterators, Generators, Co-routines
Class properties, Property descriptors
Metaclassing
Object introspection, Docstring instrospection
How to apply arguments on function evaluation.
How to hitch functions as class methods
Currying in python

Some of the things that come to my mind. I am sure there are many others.

If you have time do take a look into functional programming as well.

Application: TaskJuggler

What it is:

TaskJuggler is a project management tool for Linux and UNIX based
operating systems. Whether you want to plan your college's shifts for
the next month or want to build a skyscraper - TaskJuggler is the tool
for you.

Instead of clicking painfully through hundreds of dialog boxes you
specify your TaskJuggler project in a simple text format. You simply
list all your tasks and their dependencies. The information is sent
through TaskJuggler and you will get all sorts of reports in HTML or
XML format.

TaskJuggler not only honors the task interdependencies but also takes
resource constraints into account. Using TaskJuggler's powerful
filtering and reporting algorithms you can create task lists, resource
usage tables, status reports, project calendars, and project accounting
statements.

To know more about:

http://www.taskjuggler.org/

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install taskjuggler

Dear Vijay,

For two PSTN lines you will need to look at the range of analog cards 
available : 
http://sangoma.com/products/hardware_products/analog_telephony.html.

Also read up and get comfortable with the terms FXS and FXO.  A 2-Port 
FXO like this 
http://sangoma.com/products/hardware_products/analog_telephony/usb_fxo.html 
may do fine for you.

Regarding the GSM sim adapter, the only time I used something like this 
was with imported hardware, so you may need to search for a while to 
find what you need.  But it does work and it can be made to work with 
Linux.  My only advice is to be very careful about setting up your 
computer to automatically reply to SMS's - we did that by mistake and 
Hutch spammed us with some cricket promotion and we ended up with a huge 
bill.  So don't automatically reply to SMS's.

Regards,


Warren.

Two lessons from the Megaupload seizure
By Glenn Greenwald

"Two events this week produced some serious cognitive dissonance.
First, Congressional leaders sheepishly announced that they were
withdrawing (at least for the time being) two bills heavily backed by
the entertainment industry ? the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) in the Senate
and Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in the House ?  in the wake of vocal
online citizen protests (and, more significantly, coordinated
opposition from the powerful Silicon Valley industry). Critics
insisted that these bills were dangerous because they empowered the
U.S. Government, based on mere accusations of piracy and copyright
infringement, to shut down websites without any real due process. But
just as the celebrations began over the saving of Internet Freedom,
something else happened: the U.S. Justice Department not only indicted
the owners of one of the world?s largest websites, the file-sharing
site Megaupload, but also seized and shut down that site, and also
seized or froze millions of dollars of its assets ? all based on the
unproved accusations, set forth in an indictment, that the site
deliberately aided copyright infringement."

fwiw, news on the grapevine is that the GoI has nominated 2 different
agencies to source, eval and report on the feasibility and needed policy
+ resource changes needed to make this sort of filtering possible...

Another option, one that I like to pimp often - as some of you might
already have realised : is to find projects you care about the most and
things that make your life easier. And then reach out to the developers
of those project with ideas that would help you most, or make it easier
for other people to use the same projects. Depending on feedback,
consider posting patches.

That way you not only help contribute and make the entire ecosystem
grow, but you also already have some level of stake ownership in the
contributed code ( in that you use the base that its being built on )

It is necessary to understand the quality of laws. Even people working
on FOSS projects may be brutalised at the behest of some "IP/patent
troll" lobby.

Message-ID: <CALJ7LH_ePkFtBABzkCx=Jn3ivUe_4yadQ5DyJXOO-Sz9BsUwQw@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Eat The Whistle

What it is:

Eat The Whistle is an arcade soccer game similar to famous Amiga titles such
as Kick Off or Sensible Soccer. It features several game modes where you can
play either as the whole team or as a single player, and you can also manage
teams that take part in cups and leagues. There is even an arcade mode with
powerups and bonuses, like in the game SpeedBall 2.

Eat The Whistle features 30 different field types and numerous sound effects.
The game is viewed from the side and can be controlled with either a joystick
or the keyboard.

Most in-game settings are configurable, such as the pitch, weather and game
daytime, which will impact on the gameplay. There is a replay mode that lets
you load and save best moments, a game tactics editor, and teams from the
game Sensible World of Soccer can be directly imported.

+1

I am totally disappointed why even FOSS lovers confuse Freedom with Gratis. As long as it is FOSS related, I feel there need not be any tags to start a thread on this forum.

This [Commercial] tag is bullshit, IMO. There is nothing like Free Lunch or Free Beer.

Readers who are genuinely interested in the topics or offers i nthis list can apply their mind and decide whether to pay or not.

Same opinion here.

I understand your point but it is not bullshit. It is required so that 
one can quickly understand the subject of the topic. In this particular 
case there was a effort to distinguish this thread with [OT] so I am not 
going to complain even though [Commercial] is more apt here.

I don't think this is illegal. If you route VOIP [ External] calls to
Landline/Mobile phone then it's illegal.
But we are not using for VOIP [ External]. We are going to have SIP
soft/hardware phone and going to use asterisk to route pstn lines to
sip phones.

list rules my friend. Putting a [commercial] tag does not imply that it
is shady or underground activity. It is perfectly legitimate to charge
for what you do. However the [commercial] tag prevents people from
asking 'why not free?'.

I was also looking at  ATA to use analog phones with a VoIP provider.

Take a look at <http://www.matrixcomsec.com/>.    They are based out of Baroda.

I came across them @ InterOp 2011 in Mumbai last year.  Product line
up looks good although I do not know if they have the combinations
you are looking for.

I am considering their ATA1S and ATA211 boxes.

Please share your experience with whatever hardware you end up buying.

This is primarily a volunteer driven list, where people are passionate
about what they do, help each other out when possible, and give
valuable advice/guidance in their free time, and money is not
necessarily a motivation factor.

People do make lot of money using F/OSS, and if they want to make use

Subject: [Ilugc] Python error starting OpenERP 6.1 RC1 on Centos 6.2
Message-ID: <loom.20120124T012326-74@post.gmane.org>

Hi,

Request for help from Pythonistas and/or OpenERP users. I'm trying to install
OpenERP 6.1RC1 (http://nightly.openerp.com/6.1/release/openerp-6.1rc1.tar.gz) on
Centos 6.2 using Python 2.6 and get this very weird error:

python: Python/compile.c:3437: stackdepth_walk: Assertion `depth >= 0' failed.
Aborted

I've posted more details in the OpenERP forum:
http://www.openerp.com/forum/topic30304.html

It looks like there is a problem with openerp/addons/base/ir/ir_model.py, but
adding:

import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

to that file did not give more details about the offending line(s). Trying:

python openerp/addons/base/ir/ir_model.py

didn't work either since I'm not able to set PYTHONPATH correctly to import the
openerp module. There is no openerp.py - maybe the __init__.py or something else
in the openerp directory creates it automagically? But, adding that directory to
PYTHONPATH didn't seem to help.

There is a rumour that OpenERP's setup.py can be used to find and install the
needed dependencies as well. I tried installing them from EPEL rpms, but am
unsure if pip or easy_install would be better. Uninstalling the rpms and running 

setup.py --dry-run install

didn't do the trick as I'd been told.

Any pointers?

Regards,
Sameer

friends.

Foss is becoming as a part of college syllabus nowadays.

college staff approach us to cover the syllabus. we also handle the session.

but it seems continuing always.
the staff call us every year to cover the syllabus. instead of the staff
learning Foss stuff, they use us.

this should be changed. the college staff should learn the Foss subjects
and they should start teaching the subjects themselves.

please share your thoughts on how to handle this.

thanks.

Every individuals capabilities are different so we cannot say for sure a 
person with one year of experience in FOSS is eligible to teach 
students. Which is one of the reasons why they have certifications. So, 
the question is how does one know whether they are ready to teach FOSS 
subjects. Certifications seems to be the simple answer but, IMO, they 
are no good as well.

I think, self confidence is probably the most important factor to get 
someone to teach FOSS subjects, I am not sure of any common solution 
which can help everyone build that.

forget it. The only way of learning foss (or anything) is by doing it.
College staff have no incentive to do either programming or sysadmin. If
they could do either of those things they would not be college staff. So
let us continue to reach out to the students.

I think you have misunderstood - only those students that are fit for

However outrageous such a statement may sound to many, I tend to agree
with Kenneth here. During my engineering under-graduation course I
have seen teachers who didn't know to use a calculator and teachers
who typed a c program in emacs and tried pressing Ctrl+F9 (of Turbo C
fame) to compile and run a program, though the latter are far better.

Thanks & Regards,

I forgot to add, there are those rare people for whom teaching is a
vocation - if they can be identified, they are worth teaching. I have
only come across about 10-15 of these people in the last 6 years. And
actually they do not need to be taught at all - they learn by
themselves.

Repeating what I wrote in http://www.openerp.com/forum/post99425.html#p99425:

The problem seems to be in openerp/addons/base/ir/ir_model.py:

def _get_fields_type(self, cr, uid, context=None):
    return sorted([(k,k) for k,v in fields.__dict__.iteritems()
                      if type(v) == types.TypeType
                      if issubclass(v, fields._column)
                      if v != fields._column
                      if not v._deprecated
                      if not issubclass(v, fields.function)])

if the last line is commented out:

def _get_fields_type(self, cr, uid, context=None):
    return sorted([(k,k) for k,v in fields.__dict__.iteritems()
                      if type(v) == types.TypeType
                      if issubclass(v, fields._column)
                      if v != fields._column
                      if not v._deprecated])
                      #if not issubclass(v, fields.function)])

the compilation goes through. Obviously, my fix has broken some functionality,
but I hope somebody can use this investigation to give insight into the
underlying issue.

Sameer

I honestly don't know the code and am operating at a syntactic-correctness level
rather than semantic-correctness level.

But, yes, return (k,k) does seem to be throwing away the value part of the
dictionary after iterating through it.

The return value of _get_fields_type() is used thus:

class ir_model_fields(osv.osv):
  ...
  _columns = {
  ...
    'ttype': fields.selection(_get_fields_type, 'Field Type',size=64,
required=True),
  ...

and a sample use of ttype in turn is:

if vals.get('ttype', False) == 'selection':

Not sure if that gives any clues?

An older version of _get_fields_type() has:

cr.execute('select distinct ttype,ttype from ir_model_fields')

so maybe return (k,k) is OK?

Thanks,
Sameer

Also, changing to (k,v) and uncommenting the code still gave:

In my opinion even if u reach the students, the same thing as of staff
applies to them too. only those who are interested will learn it. others
will be trying only to get the minimum pass marks. I think if u really want
the staff members to learn a little atleast in the syllabus completion
perspective, contact their Head of departments and offer them to conduct
training sessions for their staff members. this training may be based on
the syllabus. this is what i think will help u avoid the situation. but if
u want the staff members to be experts or something similar to that, i hope
u will most probably fail.


Being a staff member, my feedback on the comments that are made in this
mailing list. It is not necessary that a staff should know everything. In
my experience i have seen that the intelligent always goes to the industry
sector. then how do expect the staff to be very bright and know everything.
The same question can be directed on you. if you want very brilliant staff
members, why didnt u study well and go to IIT or any other premier
institutes. Also students always want experienced faculty to teach them.
what if no companies recruit freshers? what will be the situation then. I
agree that the staff members are not up to the mark to feed the needs of
the students. But this does not rest with the individual person alone.

Sorry to say this, i dis-agree with all your comments. Being a
mathematics faculty, i comment something below,

 In our autonomous institution we include the FOSS  like LaTex and
Scilab in our syllabus of PG and UG respectively. i use both for past
6 years. i take the effort to teach both for the staff members who are
interested, by doing Workshops for past two years in our campus and
out of campus. i get good responds like number of participants,
encouraging words, other state participants etc... the feed back of
the participants is that "there is no such workshops to learn LaTeX".
For you information more than 16 participants in and around chennai
were participated in last workshop "advanced workshop on Latex" during
1-3 dec, 2011 in tiruchengode. Also, i give special lectures on LaTeX
in various institutions. In every institution i get good responds.

>From my experience, i felt that in any educational institution there
are some good and bad students as well as staff members. Even they
know FOSS good for education but they need some easiest way to learn
those things.

Also there is no need to get the complete idea about the any software
to teach. No one can learn or teach any software completely. there are
plenty of FOSS but some group of people use it for their particular
work. they never ready to learn some extra features even though they
are good teachers or industrialist .

"My suggestion is do some 2 day or 3 day workshops in a region where
did you go to cover the syllabus as you mentioned. otherwise ask the
people to arrange such workshops that cover the syllabus of the
institution  as well as it fullfill the needs and help to learn FOSS
for the near by faculty members those are interested.

Comment on that. Thank you.

Not all staff members a re sincere and dedicated. But this is the scenario
in all industries. If u think Education is a industry where every one
should be dedicated, i am sorry. that decade is long gone. but i have seen
few staff members still trying to bring that back.

I am sorry not all colleges have professors. just make a study about how
many colleges in tamilnadu have professors. Also if u dont want people who
r not interested in teaching, i am sorry to say this 75% of teaching staff
will have to resign.


      No one always wants experienced staff. All we want is people

Accepted, but given the current trend of who gets into teaching, i am sorry
that will be a long lost dream.

IMO, This is a very idealistic view. I haven't seen in any kind of work 
where everyone is dedicated. Majority of the people are dedicated to 
their family, a small number are dedicated to work and only a very small 
number find the balance between the two.

Most colleges will not have any professors if they have such 
restrictions. AFAIK, It is hard to find good professors for the provided 
compensation.

All,

You all forgot the basics. No point discussing.
Pay the staff on par with industry and you get quality staff. Universities in the west have quality teachers because they are paid on par with industry.

Can you provide a link to your presentations/teaching material (under
a free/open source software license) that others can benefit from?

Do you have any event reports/pictures from the workshops you have
conducted so far?

Most members of this list (at least the vociferous ones) have the
view : staff is no good and we will reach out only to students. Much
as I disagree with  this*, what i consider dogmatic, view , I have not
intention of starting a flame war or discussion how to correct the
situation -- especially from staff end. [* in my short stint in a
college, i could get to know what travails the teachers go through,
especially the ones who want to do something worthwhile]

However, I request the members to consider one point : while the
students are transient, the staff provide a semblance of continuity.
Wouldn't you consider Kumarans and Benedicts have made the existence
and escalation of FOSS their colleges? Sudhan brought Andal Alagar
College into FOSS fold. Once he left, the flame was dying down. Now
the new set of lecturers are interested and we have to help them out.
Of course, Sudhan has lit the flame in the new environment he is in.
Hence some attention have to be given to them. As Bhaskar does, giving
the names of staff in charge and also the HoD in the reports on
workshops/installations will make them feel more committed. Will try
from NRCFOSS end to keep the FOSS active colleges name in the
limelight. Sathyakaam and many FOSS members are doing it in different
ways.

Re Shakthi's suggestion, can keep the slides/presentations on ILUG
portals and also NRCFOSS portal. Shrini and Raman can suggest to Prof
CNK that Anna University site could hold the materials too. Period
workshops will help, but will have to coax the colleges / Anna Univ to
organize them.

I fully agree with the sentiment that the LUG/FOSS volunteers will be
sought out to do the training and other dog works, with the staff
"apparantly" doing nothing. I hope the FOSS enabled staff members in
this list will help out to volunteer and expand the "volunteer" group
by involving their colleagues and interested students.

dispalys "Disk has many bad sectors". I already send it to seagate for
warranty they returned it with "No fault found tested OK" report. But when
I install fedora 14 and above it dispalys the same warning. I tested it
with more than 3 HDD from Seagate. Does anybody has idea why this error

Yes, I know that people like you are aware of the exceptions. May be
15 in your case, and 50 in my case.

I just wanted the members to be a bit more inclusive regarding the
staff. I am also trying to figure out how to bring the 50 FOSS
specialists to lend their services to other colleges, given the
various hangups and other avoidable/unavoidable handicaps.

I am sure Coimbatore Glug should be a good forum, since the colleges
there had joined together in many activities like common recruitment
melas, etc. When Raman, Parthan and I had gone 5-6 years back to Sri
Ramakrishna Engg College to conduct a FOSS workshop for their
students, we requested them to arrange a separate (parallel) session
for HoDs/Sr. Lecturers from other colleges to create FOSS awareness.
SREC was able to arrange one. [By the way, you might have got an
invite from Prof Madhumathi of that college to inaugurate their FOSS
club].

Srinivasan.

         15 or 50, it is still much lesser than desired. Assuming we
have about 500 colleges, we should have at least 1000 staff ? I am
assuming a reasonable figure of 2 per college. And I am afraid we
might not have that.

        GLUGOT[0], the GLUG of Thiagarajar College of Engg,Madurai has
been doing a lot of these stuff from about 2004 or so. But what we are
talking about is, having staff who are really good at what ever they
are handing. For that, these workshops can act only as a trigger. It's
the self-interest of the staff that would take it further from there.
The staff should pick from where the workshop left and develop his/her
knowledge/expertise.

For eg., a staff handling compiler design, should be able to guide
his/her students in implementing a small compiler as a semester
project. And to do that, the staff should know the tools available,
and a basic knowledge of how to handle those tools. A workshop can
introduce the staff to tools like bison/antlr/llvm etc etc. But until
the staff tries using the tools, it wouldn't be of any help and in
that case, I would not call such a staff a competent one. The students
are the ones who will suffer there. Thanks

use a live cd to run fsck to check and fix the errors.

sudo fsck -y /dev/sdaX

replace X with partition number.

run this for all partitions.

share the results here.

       After reading Kenneth's comment about "including neighboring
colleges, I thought I should clarify. This workshop is not just for
staff of Thiagarajar College of Engg . It is for staff and students
from across TN. And we did have people from ilugc for a few of the
sessions. So, that included people from all colleges :) Thanks

I was trying to run openerp-server from the extracted folder first and the error
came up. Install also failed since the .py files are "compiled" first before
being copied over.

Thanks to Florent X., the problem has been isolated to specific versions of
Python, and maybe CentOS
(https://answers.launchpad.net/openerp/+question/185679). I suspect a difference
in Python build settings since on CentOS 5.5, Python 2.4.3 works ok while 2.6.5
doesn't. On CentOS 6.2, packaged Python 2.6.6 doesn't work, but a vanilla
configure&make build of 2.6.7 works OK.

<rant>
Compared to Perl's CPAN, Python package management is still a work in progress.
And compared to apt-get, so is yum and rpm. Forget about users, even major
Python app. developers seem to have no clue whether to use easy_install or pip.
It doesn't help that easy_install gives useful details but doesn't uninstall
(true to its name), while pip uninstalls but its verbose option is hardly that.
And neither cares that python-dateutil 2.0 needs Python 3.0 and should not be
installed into a Python 2.x site-package area. These are all solved problems in
the Perl world. And the less said about CentOS's lack of "stock" SRPMs the
better. I haven't had to use rpmfind for years to look for packages.
</rant>

Sameer

Oh, that means I don't understand the data contained in the dictionary/object
and only know that "something" is causing a valid Python statement to be
interpreted as a problem by the Python interpreter.

In this case, it may make sense for a 2-element tuple (list?) containing 2
instances of the same data to be returned.

As it turns out, the problem was with a particular version of the Python
interpreter, and maybe the CentOS build environment. So, while the statement is
semantically correct, it was misinterpreted as a syntax error :)

Sameer

Fedora reads your SMART data and reports that. It is the case that your
hard disk may have started failing (and will fail soon) due to old age or
some reason but works properly as of now. Check for that first using
smartmontools or palimpset-gtk (disk utility). If that is the case it is a
early warning and you can back up all your data and buy a new one (This is
what my hard disk condition - I have backed up all data and waiting for it
to die). Getting informed is not a bad thing this is really a good thing.

Subject: [Ilugc] HDD error in Fedora

Dear all,

I am using Seagate 500GB SATA HDD. When I install Windows & Ubuntu it
didn't find "BAD sector", but when I install fedora in the same HDD it
dispalys "Disk has many bad sectors". I already send it to seagate for
warranty they returned it with "No fault found tested OK" report. But when
I install fedora 14 and above it dispalys the same warning. I tested it
with more than 3 HDD from Seagate. Does anybody has idea why this error
occurs.

With regards,

Vijayakumar,


Hello

I think we have to differentiate between (a) teaching FOSS, rather,
imparting FOSS knowledge and (b) enabling the colleges to conduct FOSS
courses that are part of the FOSS curriculum. Anna Univ colleges are
expected to send the teachers to attend Faculty Development Programmes. In
a number of such FDPs, ILUG members have participated, and am sure, are
ready to participate in future. However, it may be a question of cutting
the leg to fit the shoe size.

At present, to my knowledge, Anna Univ Coimbatore syllabus has a FOSS
theory course in 3rd year and Anna University (Chennai or for all?) has
FOSS Lab. Colleges with FOSS enabled staff don't seem to have much problem
but others have faced difficulties. On top of it, there is a worry about
examiners -- many of them might have just heard about FOSS! In this
respect, making the relevant slides, presentations, etc., might be worth
the trouble. I understand there is a manual for FOSS Lab. It could be
elaborated or reworked -- by the general norms, a companion for the FOSS
Lab manual (?sic)

Four years down the line, the present day students would become 
staffs..  if we train the students as foss expert, they would become 
foss staffs tomorrow..  with heavy competition even for lecture jobs, 
the expertise in foss will be a differentiator for those students and 
chance of employed become more.

Run "badblocks" in r/w mode and see if any errors are reported.

run smarctl -d /dev/sdX X=device alphabet and note any errors reported.

For me, in a couple of instances, the HDD would keep "loosing" the
partition table. Seagate's DOS tools would report no error.   smarctl
did report errors found in the HDD's.

 It might help if you include a note along with the HDD stating the
problem you are experiencing (and not listed in their error codes) and
they might replace the HDD.

Hopefully they will not say we do not support Linux :)

Simply do the tests with Gsmartctl from a live cd (like parted magic).
It reports very well.
Post reports.

 1. Lightning Talks - 30 min.

    - lxml - Processing XML with Python - Vijay Kumar
    - AlphaBubbles - Siva Chandran
      If you would like to give a lightning talk, just come prepared,
    we will be able to accommodate you.

 2. PyCon 2011 Video: API Design anti-patterns
    by Alex Martelli - 45 min.

    Designing interfaces so that other code can interact with ours
    (whether our code is a library, framework, application,
    website...) is a very common and clearly crucial activity, but
    fraught with dangers -- stuff we all keep doing wrong time after
    time. This talks shows some common cases of API design errors
    encountered in the wild, with tips on how to avoid them when you
    design your next API.

Vijay

Anna Univ, Coimbatore has two FOSS subjects

Chennai (CS-2406) and Thirunelveli (CS-77)

Myself trained about 130+ college staffs in six different workshops to

National Engineering College, Kovilpatti, Tuticorin Dt.

S.M.K. Fomra Institute of Technology, Chennai

St. Xaviers Catholic College of Engineering, Thovalai, KK Dt.
KCG College of Technology, Chennai

Out of 12 lab exercises in FOSS Lab, myself created video tutorials
for 9 (except PHP/PERL/Python) and given to all the colleges.  Both
staffs and students have utilised them when working in the labs.

This year, 40+ new colleges will be additionally taking the FOSS lab
courses.  So, 2 or more workshops this year would definitely help
these new colleges.

In the books details, it's mentioned as 'open sorus'.  Request them to
change to 'open source'

Yeah, generally most of us don't care but it is an important difference. 
I wonder whether you are being sarcastic here, nevertheless, you can 
find the details in the following link :)

Of course, there is. As most of the open source software are released with
some free software license as well, many people fail to understand the
difference. May be the term "FOSS" made it look like both are same.

In a nutshell, I think Free Software is inclined towards users -- their 
freedom whereas Open Source is inclined towards businesses, to make Free 
Software more acceptable for businesses who don't much care about user's 
freedom but want technical superiority of free software.

I will be interested in knowing about the difference.

business people have aversion towards the other meaning of free.
rms has aversion towards other possible interpretations that open might 
lead to.

the problem is with English. rms till date couldn't find a suitable 
alternative to free, though he agrees with mis-interpretation it raises.

according to him only free gives the meaning of free in English.

why not bluntly call it "Freedom Software". not sure what the suffix 
'dom' might cause. may be little lengthy and non-crispy like free.

There are abundant languages in India. And each might have more than 
three-four words for freedom.

And English has been open to Loan words. 'kolaveri' perhaps the latest 
addition. ;-)

so this time when he is around, suggest him all possible words in the 
sub-continent that refers to freedom.

probably people here would have attempted it earlier & failed. let free 
sense prevail then.

I think RMS is full of mischief. He never cared for Corporates, but only for small users and the society. So I feel he purposely used the word "Free" to make it attractive to the layman. In India and anywhere, people will travel by car spending Rs. 100/- on petrol to save Rs.50/- on some purchase if there is a "Free" offer.

I think I have some solid evidence for my claim that RMS is mischievous:

Consider the word "GNU" - initially it was pronounced as "New", so as to make it more appealing.

And consider the word "Hurd"  which he used for his 'free' kernel project. It is very easy to confuse Hurd with Herd; in order to encourage the Herd mentality of the computing masses.

So although RMS claims Free stands for Freedom, it is only the second or third meaning in the dictionary. The attempt is not to clarify, but to purposely and mischievously mislead to misinterpret.

Thanks for laughing.

Some more evidence:

1.  Stallman named his famous license as the GPL which stands for General Public License. This creates the impression that this is the license which the general public wants. And also that other licenses are not for the general public but for the big bad corporates.

Why didn't he call it Free Software License or FSL for short? Purposely to misinterpret, IMO.

2. Also,  Stalmman and his FSF folks give bad and critical expansions for acronymns which they don't like. For example:

DRM: Originally stood for Digital Rights Management; RMS called it Digital Restrictions Management.

CBDTPA: Consumer Broadband Data... something Act, The FSF expands it to: "Consume But Don't Try Programming Act.

Microsoft retorted by renaming DRM to RMS, calling it Rights Management System!;-) Stallman couldn't respond because it was his own initials ;-)

A funny game is being played here, for the minds and hearts of the computing masses.

In the actual word "gnu" which means an African antelope, 'g' is silent and
so its pronunciation is similar to 'new'. To make the word GNU (that refers
to the OS), it is pronounced like "Gah-nu". You can notice RMS stressing
the "Gah" part in his pronunciation of GNU.

Ok, let it be. You have a better term to replace "free"? If you have one,
we can at least ask him why he didn't choose that.

Btw, puns and figures of speech are common in UNIX commands also. It can be
seen from the commands "more" and "less", "fsck", etc.

I think I have created an impression that I dislike RMS for being mischievous. On the contrary I admire the man a lot, and I am one of his longtime ardent devotees. I liked his plain speaking after Steve Jobs died.

I look forward to meeting the great man in person on Feb 6th, and exchanging a few words and thoughts.

I wanted to send out a note that may help some on this list with a
first-time RMS encounter. Please take this with as much skepticism as
necessary.

It's good to keep in mind that RMS is mildly autistic. I had a few
interactions with the man, all online, and initially thought he was just
being difficult and curmudgeonly. His behavior often comes across as rude.
As a single-pointed Free software advocate he appears to have a lack of
sense of the realities that some people have to deal with (one minor
example is how Open Source vs. Free Software is largely irrelevant to most
of us but one that he has very strong opinions about).

I'm putting this out there because he'll potentially piss you off and sound
like a complete a**hole for asking a well-meaning question. He'll be obtuse
and unclear about what he really means (as has been demonstrated by his
"mischievousness"). But he's a ridiculously smart guy and has (in addition
to mild autism) the disease of the ridiculously smart - a bit of ego which
will not condescend to the unwashed masses.

Interact with the intention to learn and brush off any slights by him. If
you want to learn, be persistent - it doesn't matter if RMS thinks you're
an idiot. Most of the world is an idiot to him (legitimately or otherwise).

I wrote off RMS because of my interactions with him until mutually close
friends explained his behavior to me. I would probably have accepted his
behavior better had someone explained things up front. So hopefully
(perhaps, maybe) this helps someone.

Hello everybody,

It's everybody's second-most favourite time of the release again. No,
not the actual release, but it's Ubuntu Developer Week!

       https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek

Join us from Tuesday, 31st January 2012 to Thursday, 2nd February 2012
for three action-packed days full of tutorial and hands-on session all
around Ubuntu development. We spared no efforts to bring you a very
diverse set of topics and a very diverse set of speakers as well. This
time we managed get speakers from Australia, Brazil, Canada, Czech
Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Pakistan, Poland,
South Africa, Spain, UK and USA.

No matter if you are new to Ubuntu development or quite experienced
already, we are sure going to have an interesting session for you.
Here's just an excerpt of the great things to come:

 * Packaging: find out how software is put into Ubuntu and how it's
  maintained. We have a variety of hands-on sessions where Ubuntu
  developers share their experience with you. It's the perfect time to
  get involved.
  Sessions: Intro to Ubuntu development, Getting set up, Dos and
            Dont's, working with Upstream projects, building packages
            locally, using pkgme for automatic packaging, writing good
            changelog entries, distributed development and loads more.
 * Quality Assurance and Bug Fixing: One of the greatest ways to
  contribute to Open Source is resolving problems. Not only for you,
  but for millions of users out there. Join in to find out from
  experts how to make Ubuntu even better.
  Sessions: Bug lifecycle, triaging bugs, fixing small bugs in lots of
            different settings, automated testing, and lots of
            hands-on action
 * Writing code: we will talk about apps, tools, projects and
  infrastructure to make writing software for Ubuntu even easier.
  Sessions: automated testing, pair programming, code review,
            technology overview, introductions to many cool
            technologies and making your apps rock.
 * Ubuntu projects and Ubuntu in the bigger picture: Ubuntu has grown
  dramatically and lots of different project make the awesomeness we
  release every six months. Find out who's doing what and what's new.
  Sessions: Ubuntu TV, Edubuntu, juju, the Cloud, Unity and Debian.

Joining in is trivial. Use normal IRC (even a web browser will do) [1]
or install Lernid [2] and connect.

[1] https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek/JoiningIn
[2] apt://lernid

We put lots of effort into this great event. 31st January to 2nd
February will be a great time and just for you. Bring your friends and
your questions.

As this is generally asked very often: yes, we will keep logs of all the
session if you shouldn't be able to attend. We will make them available
on the Ubuntu Developer Week page.

that is not the difference. Python, Postgresql, django, apache and
thousands of other software are aimed at businesses? And all that GPL'd
stuff that runs on windows are not aimed at business???

Although there seems to be some kind of difference, I have no clue
about how this is all
applicable in our country. Not that anyone cares.

Not that I know Rails better. But I am curious to know why you want
to add versioning for your models.

Dear all,

I am pasting the reply here which I received from RMS 4 days ago reg.
the interview appeared in LFY and his views:

   http://www.linuxforu.com/2011/09/baskar-selvaraj-interview-foss-power-in-170-tamil-college-labs/

RMS:

It looks like you've achieved a lot, at the practical level.

Do these labs teach the students the ethical ideas of the free
software movement?  That is the next thing to do.

Baskar:   Though I have used the term Linux / FOSS in few places,

RMS: Yes, it is disappointing.  You could have said "GNU/Linux" and "free
software" yourself when answering the questions.

Or did you do that, and they changed it?

Is this a GUI front end to smartctl (which I have mentioned earlier)?

1.  Start a new thread -- your question, although cron related, is of
a different nature.
2. Trim your quotation.  Your post has *nothing* to do with the
original discussion.

Please look at the meaning of '*'  in "man 5 crontab".  Every minute
(0-59), Every hour (0-23) on the first day of every month.  Day of
month overrides day of week (in your case).

It will run repeatedly on the 1st of the month. Probably not something
you intended.

If you want to run something *once* a month, use:

    0 0 1 **    user    /path/to/script

Alternately you can use this more readable syntax:

    @monthly    user    /path/to/script

See "man 5 crontab" as Arun has suggested.

Which is why, I try and avoid 'cron' as much as possible. I'd recommend you
use daemontools - easier to manage and monitor status. cron isn't great
when you'd like to run something pretty frequently. Has all sorts of pit
falls.

Message-ID: <CADDQFRuH1GW5Utgc3KEFSUjp=ZBYbcUJ6RC4qhJrfc4Hh+tpvw@mail.gmail.com>

ACTA can be used to stifle open h/w projects, stifle information flow,
file-sharing and more.

The ACTA Fight Returns: What Is at Stake and What You Can Do
Friday January 27, 2012
The reverberations from the SOPA fight continue to be felt in the U.S.
(excellent analysis from Benkler and Downes) and elsewhere (mounting
Canadian concern that Bill C-11 could be amended to adopt SOPA-like
rules), but it is the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement that has
captured increasing attention this week. Several months after the
majority of ACTA participants signed the agreement, most European
Union countries formally signed the agreement yesterday (notable
exclusions include Germany, the Netherlands, Estonia, Cyprus and
Slovakia).

This has generated a flurry of furious protest: thousands have taken
to the streets in protest in Poland, nearly 250,000 people have signed
a petition against the agreement, and a Member of the European
Parliament has resigned his position as rapporteur to scrutinize the
agreement, concluding that the entire review process is a "charade."

Some are characterizing ACTA as worse than SOPA, but the reality is
somewhat more complicated. From a substantive perspective, ACTA's
Internet provisions are plainly not as bad as those contemplated by
SOPA. Over the course of several years of public protest and pressure,
the Internet provisions were gradually watered down with the removal
of three strikes and you're out language. Other controversial
provisions on statutory damages and anti-camcording rules were made
optional rather than mandatory.

While the Internet provisions may not be as bad as SOPA, the remainder
of the agreement raises many significant concerns.

Countries such as India have expressed concern that it conflicts with
the TRIPS Agreement. Other elements of the agreement increase the
standards in the WIPO Internet Treaties and the commercial scale
definition at the WTO. The agreement adds new criminal provisions,
pressures ISPs to take greater action, and heightens border measures.
There remains ongoing debate as to whether the substance of ACTA
requires legislative change in many signatory countries (a somewhat
dated site on many ACTA issues here).

Beyond the substantive concerns, the ACTA process remains a major
issue as it sets a dangerous precedent for international IP
agreements. For years, the ACTA process was shrouded in secrecy, with
only the occasional leak bringing plans to light. Wikileaks cables
confirmed that the secrecy was viewed as a serious problem in many
participant countries. In fact, even as most countries supported
greater transparency and the release of draft texts, the U.S.
steadfastly refused, using transparency as a bargaining chip to
extract concessions from other negotiating partners. In addition to
the transparency problems during the negotiations, the express
exclusion of many countries from the process raises real fears that
they will face increased pressure to meet ACTA standards in the years
ahead.

Given the ongoing concerns, the big question now is whether much can
be done. The majority of ACTA countries have signed the agreement, but
it will only take effect once five countries have formally implemented
and ratified it. That is not expected until at least May 2013, opening
the door to stopping the agreement from taking effect. While there are
global initiatives such as the AccessNow petition, much of the
activity has shifted to specific countries or regions:

    Europe is home to the most active anti-ACTA effort since there is
still a possibility that the European Parliament may reject the
treaty. There remain serious doubts about whether ACTA is consistent
with the EU Acquis.  Learn more about what can be done at La
Quadrature du Net, EDRI, the Open Rights Group, and FFII.
    In Canada, the Department of Foreign Affairs is conducting an open
consultation on ACTA. Email your comments to the department or write
Consultations and Liaison Division (BSL), Anti-Counterfeiting Trade
Agreement (ACTA), Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada,
Lester B. Pearson Building, 125 Sussex Drive, Ottawa, Ontario, K1A
0G2. A March 2011 Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage report
recommended limiting Canada's ACTA commitments.
    In the U.S., much of the focus is on whether ACTA must be approved
by Congress. Senator Wyden has raised questions about the issue. KEI
has extensive coverage of the U.S. perspective on ACTA.
    In Australia, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is
accepting submissions on ACTA until January 27, 2012 (Kim Weatherall's
submission here). Australia tabled the agreement in Parliament on
November 21, 2011 and has taken the position the agreement will not
require any legislative changes. The Australia Productivity Commission
recommended in 2010 that Australia not include IP provisions in trade
agreements.
    The New Zealand government has posted information on ACTA on its website.
    Switzerland and Mexico have yet to sign ACTA.

The dangers associated with ACTA are not limited to this particular
agreement. The agreement opens the door to further secretive
negotiations, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership, which contain
extensive IP provisions that extend beyond ACTA.  The SOPA battle was
a big win for those concerned with balanced copyright and the open
Internet, but it is by no means the end of the fight.

Hi,

I am Karthik and I am developing an HTML5 application for creating mockups
and a css previewer (something like webputty from FogCreek). I am looking
for a few good ruby on rails developers. I am in search for the following
skills :

1. Rails 3.1/3.2 with devise, omniauth, experience
2. jQuery + HTML5
3. Frontend skills are a good to have but not necessary
4. Git
5. Heroku deployment experience will be a plus.

I am willing to pay a monthly salary of upto Rs. 30,000 per month (if you
are really good, you can always talk me into paying more). But more
importantly, please apply only if you are :

1. Willing to work in a startup
2. A code geek and loves writing beautiful and powerful code
3. A self driven, responsible coder who likes to be trusted and in turn
gets things done for the company.
4. More importantly, a StarWars fan.

I would be glad if you can send me a github profile and other pieces of
code that you have written previously. If you feel one of your friends
could fit in, do share this with them.

Thanks
Karthik

Hi ILUGC,

I'm looking for a possible solution to Autorun a html file in a mountable
media ( DVD Disc ) when it is mounted in Linux. Like the "autorun.ini"
file, in windows, which automatically runs the specified binary or file in
the media when mounted.
Please do help me resolve this issue. Some pointers will also be fine.

Note: RHEL 5 is the flavour i'm trying to implement.

show icon for my pendrive that uses autorun.inf file). You have to check
with latest fedora or ubuntu for your needs. I am not sure about RHEL
(being RHEL 5 it will have old packages so it may or may not have support
for this feature). Just give it a try.

Just use the wordpress.com hosted blogs to post the information to the public.
Dont concentrate much on setting up separate website, hosting etc.

Concentrate on regular activities like public events, installfest,
workshops, meets etc.

IMHO, it is best left to the group to decide how they wish to manage
the above based on availability of resources and time.

     I am not very sure I understand the question. You can configure a
machine to use NIS by editing a few files(passwd, group, nsswitch
etc). And of course, you will have the GUI even if you use NIS.

> (and also GUI based NIS server )

        I again do not understand what a GUI NIS server is :( Can you
please explain in a bit more detail, what you are looking for ? Thanks

No partition table? you mean you didn't create it at first place or is
it damaged now?

Anyway, check DEFT Linux (http://www.deftlinux.net/) or System Rescue
CD (http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page). They are example of Linux
system that are made for system forensics and/or system resuce.

Tips: first thing you have to do, in my opinion, is creating exact
disc image. I think dd or its variant like dclfdd
(http://dcfldd.sourceforge.net/) could serve you well.

PS: you will get better answer if you direct your further question in
forensic related mailing list :)
