Best way to debug is to run with  -x option.

If it is only bash, you can use array also.

Every time I send an email through KMail the recipient recieves the above as the first line.
Any way to avoid this. I tried to locate. Not successful.

Is it a signature of KMail? The one Amachu Ramadass sends also has this line.

Address = Value, not Value = Value. With '$', you are dereferencing
the address to get the value present in it.

Have you tried experimenting with the the text and HTML
email sending options?  KMail is probably sending your
email in both text and HTML formats, but MIME encoding
it in a way that other mail clients don't like.

Subject: [Ilugc] kmail driving me crazy
Message-ID: <200901011502.46232.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,
I have two mail ids on two different servers - l@foo.com and l@bar.com. I have 
two identities in kmail and two accounts corresponding. I have two folders - 
one to receive mail for foo.com and one for bar.com. Mail sent from foo id 
goes through foo servers and that from bar id goes through bar server - this 
took me 2 weeks to configure, but it works.

When I press 'reply' to a mail addressed to foo.com I expect that the 'from' 
address will be foo.com. Why do I expect this? Because for 2 years I was 
using apple mail program which automatically did this for all the 5 ids I was 
using then. With kmail it is a lottery. Which means that when replying to 
mailing lists, a good number of my mails get rejected because I have replied 
from the wrong 'from' address. There is a little check box called 'sticky' in 
the composer - no idea how it works. Anyone know how to solve this?

My personal opinion is that this problem is called because kmail has something 
called a 'default account'. wtf is a default account? It goes without saying 
that mail to an account should be replied to from the same account. That is 
default behaviour. If you want to reply from some other account, you should 
be able to specify this.

is it still supported? I am using 1.9.9, which they say is supported, but when 
I filed a bug report I got a very hostile reception and was told to upgrade 
to 1.9.10.

To everyone else who might later want to do the same, a Linksys WMP54G
works just fine. I'm told that the versions (4.1 and above) with the
newer chipset won't work out of the box, but the model I bought was
manufactured in March 2008 and it works superbly on Ubuntu 8.10. Be
aware that drivers for this particular card (which uses the Ralink
RT2561 / RT61 chipset) will have to be compiled if you're using Debian
4.0 (Etch) or older.

I have also found that this particular card works much better than the
Netgear WG311 that is the other popular card available in Madras, both
in performance and ease of installation.

In case you can't find a store anywhere else, Mercy Electronics on
Lattice Bridge Road (L.B. Road), Adyar has quite a few of these in
stock.

Thanks for the tip, if you use it with a desktop, what is the PCI card
that you have installed in a PCI slot there.

FYI,

According to the following url:
http://linux-wless.passys.nl/query_chipset.php?chipset=Ralink
version 4.1 is fully supported, the same as version 4. Both entries
have a green coloured cell in the column titled 'works with Linux'.
The table shows that version 4 uses a driver called rt2x00 while
version 4.1 uses rt61.

I own this card too, version 4.1. It uses kernel module rt61pci.

Unfortunately the version is not listed anywhere on the box, but is
there on a sticker on the card itself. On Mandriva 2008 Spring the
card works fine. I think the required firmware is included with
Mandriva CDs, except for the Free edition, because the firmware itself
is not Free Software. If you have the Free edition of Mandriva, you
will have to download the firmware separately and install it,
otherwise the card should work out of the box.

One small glitch I encounter occasionally when I start up the PC is
that although the card has connected to the network and got an IP
address, pinging the router does not work, therefore there is not 'net
access. Usually disconnecting and reconnecting to the network makes
the problem go away. I don't know if this glitch is due to hardware,
software, router problems or anything else. It happens rarely enough
that I'm not bothered enough to find out.

Thank you so much for the link, amartyo. That page is precisely what I
needed when I started this thread.

As it turns out, Ubuntu 8.10 works with the card right out of the box,
so I'm planning on installing the version before that to see if it's any
good. Thanks for the tip on Mandriva. Which kernel version do you use? I
have Debian Etch installed currently and since I don't have Internet
connectivity on that box I can't download the sources to compile the
kernel module. Is it possible that you could attach your binary module?
Would it work if I used that one?

Hmm, so far, this hasn't happened to me. It picks up the network really
fast.

Subject: [Ilugc] Recipe to make Reliance EC 121 modem work
Message-ID: <3b15edbe0901010904w1c96d343m788dbce11a730015@mail.gmail.com>

Recently a friend asked me to get his Reliance EC 121 modem working on
his laptop running Ubuntu 8.04. It wasn't working out of the box
because it would present itself as a USB storage device and would get
automounted. After much googling, including reading the thread whose
first email is here:
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2008-October/043939.html
I got it working, so I thought I'd share the steps in case it is
useful to anyone else.

1. Download the program usb_modeswitch from
http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/usb_modeswitch-0.9.5.tar.bz2

     wget http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/usb_modeswitch-0.9.5.tar.bz2

2. Extract the binary usb_modeswitch from the tarball and copy it to /usr/sbin

3. Copy the file named usb_modeswitch.conf  to /etc

    tar jxf usb_modeswitch-0.9.5.tar.bz2
    cd usb_modeswitch-0.9.5
    sudo cp usb_modeswitch /usr/sbin
    sudo cp usb_modeswitch.conf /etc

4. Add the following lines to /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf

DefaultVendor=  0x12d1
DefaultProduct= 0x1411


HuaweiMode=1


Make sure to comment out all other lines starting with DefaultVendor,
DefaultProduct, TargetVendor, TargetProduct etc by placing a ';'
(semicolon) or '#' (hash) at the beginning of each line.

5. Create the following two files under /etc/udev/rules.d

99-huawei_00.rules
----------------------------

SUBSYSTEM=="block", \
ACTION=="add", \
SYSFS{idVendor}=="12d1", \
SYSFS{idProduct}=="1411", \
OPTIONS="ignore_device"

99-huawei_01.rules
---------------------------

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="1411", SYSFS{idVendor}=="12d1",
RUN+="/sbin/mydevice_switch.sh"

6. Create a script named mydevice_switch.sh under /sbin

#!/bin/sh
/usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch
sleep 1
/sbin/modprobe usbserial vendor=0x12d1 product=0x1411


Remember to make it executable.

chmod a+x /sbin/mydevice_switch.sh

7. Make sure the following lines are present under /etc/wvdial.conf


[Dialer Defaults]
Init1 = ATZ
Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
Password = Your password
Phone = #777
Modem Type = Analog Modem
Stupid Mode = 1
Baud = 460800
Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0
ISDN = 0
Username = Your username

Now typing wvdial should work ok, and the ppp connection should get set up.

One problem I could not solve was how to find out the username and
password. My friend told me there was no documentation saying what
these were. Nor was it any separate file when the modem was loaded in
usb storage mode previously. The only way to get that information was
to plug the modem into a windows machine and let the executable
containing the windows driver run. Once this was done, I had to look
in one of the INI files to see the username and password. I don't
remember the exact steps since I did all this a while ago.

Hope all this is useful to someone.

I doubt that would work. The kernel would need to be an exact match,
and afaik Mandriva patches the kernel in ways that make it different
from a stock kernel or a kernel distributed by any other distribution.

If you meant the binary firmware, which is different from the kernel
module, it must be present on your Ubuntu 8.10 CD, because you said
the card works out of the box with version 8.10. Just look in a
directory named /lib/firmware or something. I'm not sure of the exact
name, but the pathname should contain the word firmware.

BTW, nowadays most motherboards have integrated ethernet cards.
Routers too often have an ethernet port or two, so you could connect
the box directly to the router to get connectivity, and then download
the sources etc.

Hi

I have installed the recent version of dynebolic linux in my old P III with
256mb RAM dual booting  ubuntu 7.1 with grub. I am able boot into dynebolic
linux as root (default option). It is working fine. I created a user account
with adduser command with password. A home dirctory is also get created in
the HDD nest. But I am unable to login as user. When I logout as root the
xserver hangs.There is no login screen to type username and password.

Hope somebody would be using dynebolic in the ilugc. I shall appreciate any
help. Many people seems to have faced this problem in dynebolic linux.
Googing did not yield any fruitful solution. I shall appreciate any help.
Thanks.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0901021015010.1101-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

ogg123 -- Plays Ogg Vorbis audio files.

Summary:

Ogg Vorbis is a new audio compression format. It is different from
these other formats because it is completely free, open & unpatented.
It is roughly comparable to other formats used to store & play digital
music, such as MP3, VQF, AAC, and other digital audio formats.

ogg123 reads Ogg Vorbis audio files and decodes/play them to the (by
default) standard sound card or specified device(s). Input files can
be read from the system, or URLs can be streamed via HTTP.

Press Ctrl C to stop.

Examples:

$ locate .ogg -- Search for some OGG files in your system.

$ ogg123 my.ogg -- Play on the default soundcard.

$ ogg123 -q my.ogg -- Quiet mode. No messages are displayed.

$ ogg123 -v my.ogg -- Verbose mode. Show more info.

$ ogg123 -x 4 my.ogg -- Play the file in 4 time faster.

$ ogg123 -y 2 my.ogg -- Play the file in 2 times slower then the 
                        normal speed.

$ ogg123 -d esd my.ogg -- Play the file using ESD Device.

$ ogg123 ~/MusicDir -- Play  all of the files in the ~/MusicDir
                       and its subDirs.

$ ogg123 -d wav -f my.wav my.ogg -- Convert the OGG to WAV.

$ ogg123 -d oss -d wav -f my.wav my.ogg -- Listen to a file while you
                                           write it to a WAV file.

Read: man ogg123 (More examples are available in man page)

Thunderbird does a great job at handling multiple email identities
(it also does a great job at many other email related things).

If you use the right theme, I'm sure Thunderbird will blend in
nicely with your KDE desktop.

Any reason not to switch?

You have not understood standards compliance and the way open source
works. No plugins are needed if the websites in question adhere to
open standards as prescribed by w3c. You seem to think the problem is
because of some inadequacy in firefox! Wrong.

I read in some article yesterday that Google is encouraging users to
ditch IE6 and use Firefox or Chrome - saying these two are atleast
twice as fast as IE6.

If our banks still insist that we use IE6 then that only shows how
ancient they are.

Well with multiple accounts, While composing messages, the From field should
be a drop down box. Where in you can choose other ids if you want. Evolution
and Kmail are similar in this aspect.

Hmm.. If the To/ Cc field has l@foo.com then while replying it takes that
account into account. If it is l@bar.com <http://bar.com/> the respective
account is taken into consideration. But with mailing list the To/ Cc field
do not have your personal id but the lists accounts. Hence while replying it
uses the default account.

Gotcha!

Hmm, you're right, there are some files under
the /lib/firmware/(kernel-name) subdirectory. But I'm not too sure what
to do with that. I think I'll just settle for installing an older
(version 8.04) Ubuntu for now, because everything seems to be working on
it.

Ah, but there lies the problem. This desktop is an old one without
integrated ethernet. I'd bought a PCI ethernet card a long while ago,
but it was one of those fakes masquerading as a RealTek RTL8139D.

It can't be simplified so much. The issue is more complicated. Being a web
developer I can tell you with confidence that IE6 is still the most widely
used browser (partly due to piracy and hence the inability to upgrade to IE7
and partly because users are still naive when it comes to adopting cutting
edge technology). We do take the pain of making sure our website works
across all browser. We are able to do that because we use appropriate
libraries that take the pain out. But it's still a very costly affair. Banks
could only outsource development of their sites. Vendor now has two options
i) to build a site that is cross-browser compatible ii) Convince (or
confuse) the bank that IE6 is the only browser out there. And you know what
a business would go far :)

Well, the problem is not that making a web site that works on at least 
the top 3 or 5 most used browsers is hard. The problem is people 
designing the web sites
[1] do not test their web sites on a wide variety of web sites and tweak 
them to run through a middle line.
[2] try to do complex things in their way towards adding a lot of 
functionality, mostly eye candy stuff, but ended up with making the web 
site design completely lousy.

If the web designers keep KISS in mind and create web sites which are 
simple and clean, they can very well create things which work fairly 
well on most browsers (at least Firefox, Opera and Safari in addition to 
IE).

It is the website owner's (in this case, the bank's) responsibility to
ensure that it works in as many browsers as possible. Currently the
people who matter in banks do not know or do not care whether all
their customers are using IE or not.

The OP's intention is to start a mass mailing effort to bring to the
bank's attention that there is a sizable majority out there who do not
use IE.

Just curious, as am developing a web application myself, what are
those costly libraries that remove the pain of cross browser
compatibility!

The card needs both the driver in the kernel and a binary firmware in
order to run. IIRC, the binary firmware has not been changed in a
while and will work identically no matter what recent kernel is used,
and can therefore be copied from the Ubuntu 8.10 live cd or wherever
it is to the appropriate path on the Debian Etch box, though I'm not
sure what that path is.

Of course, all this still leaves you with the problem of downloading
the kernel sources needed to compile the driver given the lack of 'net
connectivity in the first place. Hence my suggestion about connecting
to the router by ethernet in order to download the sources, which you
say won't work.

You mean the ethernet card pretends to be a RealTek RTL8139D but none
of the kernel drivers work with it, neither 'rtl8139' or '8139too'
(don't remember the exact names) ? That's very interesting to learn.
The card masquerades as the 8139 but not well enough for the drivers
to work!

Anyway, the whole thing is academic if Ubuntu works with the wireless
card without problems and you are planning to install that.

It is incredibly frustrating. When I last tried it, I used ndiswrapper
on the Windows XP driver under Ubuntu and got it working, though the
system identified it as 'wlan0'.

lspci reported it to be a Silan Microsystems 92031 (2031) chipset,
though the windows drivers said (in the Windows Device Manager) "Realtek
RTL8139d Network Adapter" or something like that. This is with a card
from Zebronics, though I later found that others were reporting that it
is also a problem with cards from Intex. Apparently, these are cheap
fakes whose drivers make them seem like they're Realtek cards. There's a
label on the chip saying it's an RTL8139D chipset, but it's all lies.

Eventually that is what I did, though now I face problems of a different
kind (video), but I really wanted to use Debian. Ah well, maybe at a
later time. Thanks for your help.

Presumably, you are filtering your messages from your various accounts 
to their respective folders (I do it with 4 accounts).   Now right 
click on these folders, go to property and associate that folder with 
the respective email identity.  Now, select the message folder and 
select "compose", the mail identity associated with that folder will be 
used.  I use a couple of mail ids for the various mailing lists and 
this feature works very well for me.  (It KMail 1.9.9 stock openSUSE

Not really - see above.

In the absence of any association with an email id, the default email id 
is used.  BTW, what is wtf?

KMail does this - it is a drop down list.  You can make it sticky by 
checking the box.   In sticky mode that will the id used irrespective 
of the id associated with the mail folder.

When you change tools, some un-learning (the old tool) and learning (the 
new tool) is to be expected.

Do banks still do this?

Given the prevalence of computerisation in banks (CORE and all that),
I would not trust[*] 'net banking with a bank that outsources its
web-site development. Would you trust a bank that outsources its
accounting department because it is too expensive to hire accountants?

How many times have you had a cool idea that never saw the light? Or that amazing conversation you had with your best friends which resulted to nothing? It can be that amazing facebook application to solve all the problems of your single friends, or that Iphone game that will rock the world, or an android application, or that robot which will help elderly people remember their pill times. Whatever it is, this is a time to build it and ride the wave with the support of the entire startup community. Surprised?

Well, we hear ya! We call this Shotgun Startups (http://shotgun.proto.in) and its your way to huddle together for 48 hours and work on something which will change the world.

How do YOU participate you ask?

Step1 : Get those scribble books out and start going through all those ideas. Once you have decided on the idea you want to implement and visit the site. This is where the fun begins, The ShotGun Team will go through all your proposals and pick 20 ideas which have the most potential - In other words, that which sounds uber cool and useful.

Step 2: Now that your idea is shortlisted, you need to put together a team which helps you realize this idea. All shortlisted projects can publish list of open roles and participants can apply to be part of this team. You get to pick the ones you like! Use your blogs, twitters, facebooks to find these people and get them as part of the team.

Step 3: Its 22nd January evening and there are 20 teams eager to make it happen. We have experts on various platforms like Android, Iphone, Php, ROR etc, Just in case you need some expert advice. This is where we give you plenty of wifi, coffee (maybe food) and get out of your way. For the next 48 hours its you, your team and your product. Make it happen, and breathe life into your idea.

The Proto.in attendees will start voting for your ideas on the 24th, The top 5 teams will then move to Innovation Jam where they get 5 minutes to present the idea and then the audience can suggest enhancements to the product so it can move towards being a full fledged product.

As the adage goes ?Let the Startups win?, sharpen your pencils now! and for more information head to site at http://shotgun.proto.in

PS: Have you registered for the event yet? if not, head to www.proto.in/register

Proto.in January edition is in the dates of January 23, 24 2009 in the Nimhan's Convention Centre in Bangalore.

yes - I tried it and did not like it. The thing I really like about kmail is 
the way it automagically links up with spamassassin.

do you mean the libraries are costly? or that it is costly in terms of man 
hours to do this? AFAIK most opensource libraries have the appropriate tweaks 
to work with IE - and they come free.

unzip it and look for a README or an INSTALL file - follow the instructions 
there.

Just to clarify. I don't mean the libraries are costly. It's the whole
process of testing across all browser for compatibility. Using
libraries doesn't automatically guarantee that it works in all
broswers, as a matter of fact... The worst part is a lot a manpower is
required to verify these. If someone feels otherwise and know of any
library that simplifies cross browser testing, please let me know.

yes - it is a real PITA. A huge waste of manpower. First write standards 
compliant stuff. Then check if it works with I fscking E and adjust 
accordingly. Then check back with the other browsers and adjust accordingly, 
then check back with the aforesaid piece of sh$t.

What if you allow your customers to drop in feedbacks? In FOSS, the best 
testers are always the customers/users. If they start welcoming user 
feedbacks, listen to them and act upon them, that's worth the effort of 
having 1000 testers.

Hi,Feedback is for improvement.
Ideally, users shouldn't come across any bugs.
Pushing the testing to users is bad.

In Free software development, the line between developers and users is 
thin. Users tend to be participate by filing bug reports, acting as 
testers all through the development process and some move on to become 
developers as well.

For any moderately complex piece of software, it is impossible for 
developers to test everything and hence they do have to rely on users to 
participate and provide feedback.

Well. no amount of testing can stop you from encountering "on the field" 
bugs and issues. It is not a good idea not to consider your users to be 
one among the testers who can perform the value task of doing real time 
testing. And not having a system for users to give feedbacks is a big 
loss for you. The ideal situation of presenting a product without a 
single bug to your users will never happen.

Secondly, we are not asking an untested product to be released for your 
users. But, after you have checked out your logics and work flows and 
ensured no fault exists in them, only your users will be able to test 
your product in real time situations. And not having them to be able to 
offer feedbacks is a big hole in the process.

Thirdly, banks can use their own staff members as a tester resource, 
enabling them to use their own online services and thereby finding bugs, 
issues and improvements in them. Thus, you do not allow a buggy product 
to hit your users, but still have almost real life like users to test 
your product and find how satisfying it is for your users.

Hi Kapil,
Thanks for your reply.

I followed the path you have given.

I have installed ndiswrapper and modprobe also dint give any error.

But I am not able to run update-modules since I got a message saying
update-modules is deprecated.
Also when I run gksu network-admin It says the device is not present.. I am
not able see any icons to configure wireless network.

The problem is I dint get any error in the process.

Can you guess what may be the issue?

Thanks

-pandian

Hi,

I totally agree with you guys on the FOSS testing issue.
In FOSS, end users are the testers.
But we're talking about something critical here....a bank software....
even if the end users/employees test it, a small bug in it would mean a big
loss.
Company using the software, AXIS here, should employ testers and fix any
holes.

Regards,

So, it is important to protect the interest of the *company* and its
*investors* on the cost of not providing comprehensive tested software
for its end-users/customers? It is also the reason why closed source
products _can_ be shipped with loopholes. This aligns well with
proprietary software development and their *interests* :)

The advantage of having a large user base in FOSS is to get all the

Microsoft themselves have agreed that it didn't follow standards. The 8th
release is trying to follow some standards . ( can't cite the exact article
)
It's not strange that wikipedia article on Acid 3 results for desktop
browsers doesn't list IE6 .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid3#Desktop_browsers

I would rather mail the website adminstrators of the bank to be in par with
technology. If there is no responsse from them , I will ditch that bank .

wuhahaha - I was making a payment through axis bank just now and find 
that 'iconnect works best with IE 4.0'. Actually I think this 'best viewed' 
stuff is automatically generated by M$ page generation software and 
developers just do not bother to remove it.

I wish we stop discussing closed source software here.

Mplayer is my favourite player.

also I recommend you check your video output driver
try mplayer -vo x11
If it works now, add the following line to ~/.mplayerrc
vo=x11

VLC isn't part of Fedora due to potential patent issues. You should 
enable http://rpmfusion.org repository if you want the usual multimedia

The fact that you have admitted that this is a possible situation is
sufficient.  In a court of law, if there is room for doubt then an
entity cannot be condemned and thus unless the situation I have
sketched out is disproved beyond reasonable doubt the "Chennai
conspiracy theory" stands demolished.

Subject: [Ilugc] Unable to run fuse in Redhat EL 4
Message-ID: <e77389fa0901050115w50031cd2t269e1313e65e54c5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I am using Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 4 .I have the following kernel
installed in the machine 2.6.9-5.ELsmp  i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux.I tried
installing fuse in turn to use sshfs.Now i tried installing fuse from source
everything went smoothly and fuse got installed successfully.
But when i tried to do a $modprobe fuse i get this following error

FATAL: Error inserting fuse
(/lib/modules/2.6.9-5.ELsmp/kernel/fs/fuse/fuse.ko): Invalid module format.

Now this is what i obtained  from the dmesg output:

Fuse:version magic'2.6.9-5.ELsmp SMP preempt 686 REGPARM 4KSTACKS gcc-3.4'
should be '2.6.9-5.ELsmp SMP 686 REGPARM 4KSTACKS gcc-3.4'

Thus the fuse version magic is having an extra preempt out of no where.Has
anyone faced such issues while installing fuse .


cheers
Ashok

may as well use dkms and dkms-fuse from rpmforge

also, you might want to consider updating that kernel you are running, 
it now has quite a few known issues.

Also, pretty much anything by Atheros would work out of the box.

It means that the kernel under which fuse finds itself running is a
pre-emptible kernel whereas the module was built for a
non-pre-emptible kernel. (Or perhaps vice versa).

 SMP, preempt, 686, REGPARM, 4KSTACKS, gcc-3.4 

are all options for the kernel chosen at the time the kernel was
built. Any module that is built outside the kernel tree should be
built with exactly the same kernel configuration otherwise it is
likely to fail.

In other words the module and the kernel are incompatible. 

Regards,

Kapil.

The drop downs aren't proper. Functionality is fine.

And Axis Bank for putting down that it is supported best in IE alone can be
recommended to be put in Hall Of Shame list.

Well coming to the point, are you looking for [1] mentors, [2] 
co-developers or [3] who will take your code/idea and actually develop it ?
Is your source code available somewhere for people to look and comment? 
Or you need help to start with the project?
Be more clear on the exact kind of help you are looking for when asking 
for one.

It would be wise if you could make yourself to the next/upcoming ILUGC 
Monthly Meet and find a resource/mentor who can help you out. But you 
need to do some homework of taking a clean "project idea" in terms of 
deliverables to him/her. If you just go and say I need to do a project 
in PHP, on GNU/Linux platform, nobody is going to take your cries 
seriously. Good luck.

It's good that you have an interest to do a FOSS project in your
final year. Here's one way you can go about it.

First, read Shakti Kannan's excellent presentation on how to go about
doing a final year free software project:
http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/i-want-2-do-project-tell-me-wat-2-do.pdf

The pdf only contains the slides, but no notes.  If possible you should
attend a talk where Shakti is actually presenting the subject.


Second, read Eric Raymond's article How to Ask Smart Questions:
http://catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

This will help you ask good questions in technical and FOSS forums.


Third, attend a LUG meet -- there's on this Saturday at IITM -- where you
can physically meet people, introduce yourself, learn many new things, and
find people who may help you with your project.


> please guide me at every stage to complete this project.

A mentor can only point you in the right direction and cannot guide you
in every single step.  But look at the bright side, experience is the best
master, and you'll be learning from every mistake you make.

I guess your learning has already begun ;-)

Good luck!

Freedom or security is classic case of false dichotomy. The answer would 
be both.

who need Internship? Since everybody is  in the industry trying to keep
their ship floating from layoff's  :( .

Subject: [Ilugc] Making 32-bit Linux Operating Systems recognize more than
	4GB RAM..
Message-ID: <e6b5008a0901060738g3fab86abrd80d3c87965872d6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I just solved this really irritating problem on my Laptop with fedora
10 installed.
The 'free -m' command displayed that only 3GB of RAM was being
recognized even though i had 4GB installed (which the BIOS confirmed)
I went about searching the web for a solution.

I had two options:
1. To choose a 64-bit OS
2. To use Physical Address Extension (PAE)

I chose the latter as I didn't want to download a full OS again.. :P
Further, 64-bit OSs use more memory for a process than a 32-bit OS
(sorry if I'm wrong. But this is what I was told.. )
So this is what a did..

In the terminal:

sudo yum install linux-server
sudo yum install linux-image-server
sudo yum install linux-headers-server

After a reboot, 'free-m' displayed 4 GB RAM..

If anyone can tell me more about these packages,  it will be really
helpful.. I'm not sure how these packages brought about the change..

Err, are you sure this is Fedora 10? Fedora doesn't have any packages 
named like this. Either you are using a modified version or not Fedora 
at all. What Fedora does have is a alternative kernel called kernel-pae

# yum info kernel-pae
Loaded plugins: refresh-packagekit
Available Packages
Name       : kernel-PAE
Arch       : i686
Version    : 2.6.27.9
Release    : 159.fc10
Size       : 19 M
Repo       : updates
Summary    : The Linux kernel compiled for PAE capable machines
URL        : http://www.kernel.org/
License    : GPLv2
Description: This package includes a version of the Linux kernel with 
support for up to 64GB of high memory. It requires a CPU with Physical
Address Extensions (PAE). The non-PAE kernel can only address up to
4GB of memory. Install the kernel-PAE package if your machine has more 
than 4GB of memory.

This is essentially a alternative configuration developed by Igno Molnar 
from Red Hat. His introduction has a lot of the details

repository before issuing the commands.. The name of the repository, i
forget..

Well.. To know why,  http://kerneltrap.org/node/2450

Well, you could have! :P

but with 4GB of RAM, I think it is not pragmatic to worry about every 16
bits
of memory used. Also if you use graphic tools like blender, the performance
on 64 bit systems is often better.

Well, I am quite sure the server packages are compiled for the kernel.
So the kernel must have been configured with support for bigmem.
These will support till 64 GB of RAM afaik.

# yum repolist

Would tell you. You don't a extra repo for this however. kernel-pae is 
included in the official repo.

Don't ask me, I use Evolution. The fact of the matter is that people

I think he meant that you should contact him off list, meaning that
you can mail him personally to his e-mail address, rather than discuss
it on the list.

Also, please avoid top posting while mailing the list.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <d5c9fe000901061810r6f830a3bo4b86c07cdfc981c1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was flying in a Singapore Airlines last week and I was browsing
through their impressive inflight entertainment system. One thing that
interested me was an option to use that as a PC. When I went there, I
saw a office suite in place, when I clicked it, to my surprise it is
Openoffice(well, it is staroffice, powered by openoffice). The
interface was pretty cool, though the system was a bit slow. I just
played around to see what the underlying system was, but I did not see
it. But I think it should be a unix clone may be solaris or linux,
since the window theme had a xfce kind of look.

This is the first time that I am seeing a company using opensource
tools in a system that is going to be used by public.

Thanks,
Siva.

Most of the entertainment systems used on long haul Virgin flights are 
linux based, and I've heard its the same for Quantas and AirCanada too. 
There might be others.

If you are lucky to be the first few to enter the flight or to see the
boot-up of their inflight entertainment system, you can even see Linux
kernel boot messages:
http://lh4.ggpht.com/_67yX0xiKRn4/Rg5AxG1Ra3I/AAAAAAAABIA/xU8zMnRCJrk/HPIM5603.JPG

Sure, they could use "silent", but, this is good publicity :)

Jet Airways uses linux for its in-flight entertainment system. So does Air
France.

Somebody has to tell me why, freedom of users via access to source code 
should lead to security compromises from "hackers". Techniques like 
public key cryptography or the process of peer review isn't exactly new.

just shows the disconnect between the people running the website and the 
customer care people. It works perfectly with linux/osx/firefox/konq/. She 
doesnt know what she is talking about. And you are spreading FUD that it is

Not always good publicity.

In a flight that my friend travelled by recently the in-flight system
was re-booted nine times! (The cabin crew are asked to re-boot every
time the system appears to work incorrectly). He saw the Penguin
nine-times with all the boot up messages.

You can imagine what impression the passengers got of Linux! :-(

>> Somebody has to tell me why, freedom of users via access to source code should lead to security compromises from "hackers". Techniques like public key cryptography or the process of peer review isn't exactly new.

Agreed. Security through obscurity
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) has been
proven wrong in multiple instances. Security by design is what is
going to survive. More people looking into the design and
implementation could only be beneficial. Any security flaw or bug
could be identified in time and fixed. Systems relying on hiding the
design or implementation for security are bound to fail, may not be
right away though.

This whole argument of freedom "or" security is uncalled for. It's
always been freedom and security.

I have traveled BOM<>DBX by Cathay Pacific but did not notice any tell 
tale signs of the embedded OS when I turned on the system.  As a side 
note, I was impressed by their in flight entertainment bouquet - the 
selection was huge and all audio/video titles were "on demand."

Try this

# yum install libstdc++.so.5  -y

Note that Fedora 8 is going EOL today and you might want to upgrade soon

Most ( all that I have seen ) inflight ent systems let you reboot only 
the node that has an issue! I hope it wasent the entire system they were 
rebooting. It can take quite a long time to network boot 300 odd nodes. 
Either that, or it must have been a long flight :D

Have look at "script". It makes a complete record of a command-line
session including time-stamps.

The command "script" is part of the "bsdutils" package on Debian and
derivatives. (Fedora derivatives probably also have the same name). It
is used as follows:

 1. script -q -t session.record 2> session.timing
 2. The user types commands and does lots of stuff.
 3. The user logs out with exit or logout or whatever.
 4. A complete record of each command typed and every *character*
 sent back by the system is in session.record.
 5. A complete record of the time intervals is in session.timing.

Note that looking through the script transcripts requires some skill
so the command "scriptreplay" is provided in order to replay the
session with appropriate timing. Be careful while using scriptreplay
for terminal escape sequence "bombs".

Look at "man script" and "man scriptreplay" for more information.

Reliance ADM-100c model has some problems.

Change it to ZTE model.
you will get plenty of guides on net for ZTE model.

ADM is still under troubles on configuring.

I too had the same problem.
discussed with vendor and changed to ZTE model.

Because a novice will never try to reply once he get bashed.

Hi,

I want to teach networking in linux to friends.

As I have a single machine, I Installed Virtual Box and installed
Ubuntu 8.10 on it.

Host is also ubuntu, but 8.04

I enables the network as NAT for the virtual guest.

I set up IP address as below

Host : 192.168.1.1
Guest

Host is also ubuntu, but 8.04

I enables the network as NAT for the virtual guest.

I set up IP address as below

Guest : 192.168.1.2
Netmask for both : 255.255.255.0

But cannot ping each other.
It shows "host not reachable" error.

What setting I missed?

I think you are being a bit paranoid,
maybe the list enlightened him a bit ;-)

Hi,

I'm using 3 systems running as guests in my VB. In Networking "Attached to"
option use "Host Interface". Because that will assign a different IP for
each guest's virtual ethernet connection. And generate MAC addresses if you
feel like you need to. :-)

HTH,

Anuradha.

With host interface networking in virtualbox, it will automatically assign
ip to  both of your  host and guest.......it will be something like 10.2.2.1
and don't manually assign ip of your own.Install virtualbox guest additions
in your guest to get the networking feature and shared folders work!

Well, it looks like we aren't going anywhere with this thread. Why don't 
we end it here? If the OP is seriously interested and needs help, let 
him present himself for a LUG meet and get the necessary help.

For Emacs folks, there is some collaborative editing .el that works
over D-Bus.

Not tried it, though.

During editing the document lives in the server (i.e. it needs to opened 
by a user who becomes the owner of the document). Whoever serves the 
document can make it visible only to certain users and share it with 
them. The users in turn can edit it (appears in different colors for 
different users while editing) and even save a local copy of it at the 
end. IIRC, the owner can lock the document in between if he wants it to 
make it not editable by others.

OpenOffice with 'track changes' and use the footnotes, sidenotes and 
commenting features. And you can have the docs hosted in svn backed dav 
or just plain webdav if you dont want to do anything more complex.

What he means is to not just bottom-post blindly, but to remove
unneeded parts while doing so. For example, in this reply, I have
removed the ILUGC footer (about unsubscribing etc.) since I know it'll
be added again anyway, and it bears no relevance to the discussion.

One of the reasons for this list to exist is to hand hold newbies to

Check out http://chennailug.org/tenet for the location of the meet in IIT
We all meet every second saturday of the month at 3pm.

You don't have to do any special homework other than to have a clear
understanding of what your project is about and how you have thought
of implementing it. You can speak up after the talks are over and
people will pitch in and give suggestions and help you out.

And, please don't thank me for giving this info.

Why dont we give him the benefit of doubt and wait for 2 more days for
him to turn up for the meeting before coming to the conclusion that he
is a prankster? I know classmates (i finished college 1.5 years ago)
who still don't know how to read mail conversations.

If he really does reply this then he surely isn't a college student.
He is probably a 4th standard girl who likes sharukhan very much.

If your users are connected to the internet, try Google Docs.
Not FOSS, and you lose control of your data to Google, but it
sure does everything you're asking.

both top posting and bottom posting are the same - one is posting on top and 
leaving the whole message underneath, which is a waste of bandwidth and gives 
no indication of the part of the post being replied to. The second is doing 
the same thing at the bottom, leaving the whole message above, which is a 
waste of bandwidth and gives no indication of the part of the post being 
replied to. Correct way is to trim the post, quote the relevant section and 
post below this. This is also known as interleaved posting. It is sometimes 
difficult to do as it requires some work to select what should be quoted and 
what should be deleted. It is also painful to do using web mail. But we are 
human beings, not buffaloes, so we take pains to drive on the correct side of 
the road, respect oneways, stop at redlights instead of wandering where we 
please and disrupting traffic.

You don't have to use bridging any more with the new version of VB (2.1.0).
(not for this purpose). The older versions yes, you have to create a bridge
and also there are two scripts to put in at the start and end of guest. Use
the new version. Less issues. :-) Adding guest additions will give a smooth
functioning to the guest as one mentioned earlier.

cheers!

Surely, every system requires people to join and someone to admin
permissions/invites right?  What's to setup in Google Docs -- just sign
in to Gmail, and go to docs.google.com and start creating content.

<rant>
there is a big problem in India - and not only among older people. People will 
not contribute if they have to make the slightest effort. Unless they are 
totally spoonfed and hand held, they balk. Which is why, for example, 
contribution to wikipedia is so limited - we people would consult/quote 
wikipedia the whole time, but how many of us bother to correct a 
spelling/grammar mistake or some tiny factual error?

You can save copies of your data export in ODF format and you won't lose

I could not really understand what's your problem is,Please try writing  it
clearly.It seem   that your office has two internet connections, you have
setup two servers windows and linux both installed with squid.Now you want
the employees to be automatically redirected to  use  one of the
connection which is active at that moment?

Google has always ensured that user data is not locked into their
systems -- eg. pop access to GMail has been available from the
very start, GTalk is on XMPP and also federates with other Jabber
servers.  Similarly, ODF is also a good thing.

The main concern is over what Google is doing with your data when
it's sitting on their servers.  How will they use it to profile and target
you better for adsense revenues.

I guess this has gone far enough OT.

if you think that by taking backups you have saved yourself from selling your

not one bit OT - the control that the big G is starting to exert over the 
lives of some of us is starting to get a bit scary. Even I have some mailing 
lists under them - but that is not personal, but I am seriously concerned to 
see so many youngsters getting entrapped.

That is a generic claim. If I want to control the document data, I can 
save it under ODF. Whether or not Google exerts any influence over the 
other services I use, is a separate point, unrelated to this.

It is a bit difficult to understand what you are trying to sat. I think 
you are looking for a solution wherein you have 2 ISP links that are 
load balanced, and link failure detection is automatic.  The latter is 
quite simple - use cron scheduler to ping at regular intervals, detect 
failure and switch to the active link (shell scripting necessary).

If you want a ready made solution, this might be of help 
<http://www.wifi.com.ar/cdrouter.html>  I have not tried it myself.

YMMV

You can download and install it. I was not able to run it though. It
uses tomcat and needs a jdk.

OP - will help if you post an ASCII diagram of your network.

If both links terminate on the linux machine:
Better way would be to have 2 default routes with equal or weighted
cost balancing turned on. see http://www.lartc.org for more help. More
robust than checking links using methods like ping as those replies
are turned off in many cases.

If the links are terminating on two different machines, look at using
VRRP with object linking.

It looks like the person using this needs to know a lot more than what
OP wanted to do. This package includes shorewall, wondershaper etc
which require some good networking knowhow and scenario
conceptualisation. Rare to find unless one has tinkered around these
by hand.

There's something important that you are not understanding...

This is *your* project, so stop expecting/demanding others to help
you every step of your way.  Why should someone care to be your
mentor?  Have you given them any reason be interested?

If you want people to help you, then you need to win their
attention and interest.  Simply stating your project title, time line,
and demanding a mentor *will not* get you anywhere.  That is
simply not the way it's done here.

If you fail to understand this, then people here will simply ignore
you, or worse, flame you.

Read the references in my previous reply to your earlier post,
and you'll find the right path.  Then start over again.

It depends on how you want to use the website.
If it is a simple blog, you go on and create a story.
If you want the site to be more complicated, maybe a forum, polls,
user voting, etc., you would have to install/enable some modules.
Check out the Drupal Handbook. Good documentation.

Message-ID: <609166.69109.qm@web33104.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi Arulalan,

TCP/IP is the underlying architecture of the whole Internet. The power of these protocols is surpassed only by their simplicity and elegance. 
I have worked on various Internet protocols for Lucent and Conexant and I think TCP/IP are the most elegant, simple and powerful protocols of them all.

I am based in Hyd and hence cannot give a one day seminar but the right way to understand the protocols is to read the RFCs. 
At first the RFCs may seem a bit dry/complicated but once you read a couple, you will start enjoying them and appreciate the precise language used as well as the thought process.

TCP/IP includes UDP/ICMP too. For a more complete understanding, you will need to understand at least one routing protocol like RIP and also how DNS works.

Some resources/books are also listed below.

You will find the RFCs on http://www.rfc-editor.org/
Here is the RFC for IP: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/std/std5.txt
Here is the RFC for TCP: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793.txt

Other RFCs: 
ICMP: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc792.txt
UDP: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc768.txt

 
Books: (Only if the RFCs seem too complicated. I rememeber the authors - not the exact title of books)
1. TCP/IP programming by Doughlas and Comer (3 parts when I read them in 1998 - don't know about now.)
2. Networking by Tannebaum. (This book tends to be a bit confusing. Don't focus too much on the OSI model - just read the TCP/IP parts.)

If it all seems too confusing, just take a deep breath, close the books and focus that we are just simply trying to achieve transfer of data from one comp to another without loss. Try and imagine your own solution for it and then compare your model with the mechanism described in the RFC - you will understand the RFCs faster.
You can master the RFCs mentioned above if you spend 3-4 hrs a day - it will take 3-5 weeks including re-reads, confusions, clarifications ....
For code samples, you can see the Linux kernel but that is of course very advanced at this stage :-) 

You can mail me if you have queries of course. I have had a lot of fun reading and understanding these protocols and
am totally awed by Jon Postel, Vincent Cerf, and other assorted authors
and how they could plan so much in advance. I hope you derive as much
joy as I did.
Congratulations on having started on something very wonderous and believe me, if you manage to really understand how these protocols work, you will have an excellent understanding of the Internet, joy in life in addition to high paying jobs waiting for you :-)

I learnt a good lot on TCP/IP from a book (the first one I read on
this subject) written by Marshall T Rose. Seems the book is a rarity.
Check if your library has it. IIRC, it was titled "A Simple Guide to
TCP/IP Networking"

Great to see a lot of newbies coming on to the FOSS world.
But it would be really great if they don't thread jack, top post,
bottom post, spam with multiple mails for the same problem, mail with
a sensible subject.

And it is cool to hear that the college (I studied there) allowed to
install Ubuntu on 40 machines.

Perhaps we can formulate a grievance against this web site!?

At least the following things can be objected to:

The time-date information on the machine they are using is not correct.
As per page information given by the server).

This may result an incorrect record of the time when a grievance was
filed.

Hi,

OSScamp Delhi Community announces another fun-tech camp in the city of
Delhi. The current camp is scheduled for March 28th and 29th, 2009 and is
set to align with the tech fest at IIT Delhi - Tryst '09.

To describe: OSScamp is a series of community-driven unconferences targeted
specifically at promoting FOSS implementation and development in India.
Unconferences are fun technology events that gives conferences a thump down
for the formal rigidity.

This time, the community is expecting around 300+ tech enthusiasts from
around the globe. The campers would include geeks, geeks-to-be and
uninitiateds amongst others which would come together to raise noise on open
source- tools, technologies, softwares; share their experiences and
practices on foss projects.

So what are you waiting for; Go ahead and

Sign up for the event:http://osscamp.in/event/osscamp-delhi-march-2009

Hi,

Disclaimer : the content here expressed  beneath is  absolutely my own
opinion, kindly ignore if you find the content
inadequate/inappropriate.The following is my suggestion for a
beginner.

When ranking language of priority to code, it is absolutely a
situational choice and cannot be passed as judgments.

In a beginners perspective, it is better  to start with
PLT(programming logics and techniques). basically this is a exercise
which tells how to anatomize a problem by  slicing it into small parts
and solve them by using techniques. Learning this gives clear
understanding about the problem definition and enriches the analytical
thinking process.

Whether we like or not, we have to start with a language to depict our
idea into a program,  i believe many people here given valuable
feedbacks,take one prescription and put your heart mind and soul in
getting your skills fine tune in such a way that you get your
confidence upbeat that you can express your idea digitally. I would
say ,initially you may ended in selecting a wrong choice, and if you
arrived a solution that you are partnering with a wrong tool,
relinquish it and search for the better bet for the problem. After all
civilization evolved by error and correction method.

Talking on a specific instance , The best thing about learning is
keeping the choice of tools open.In my limited knowledge i found some
branch of ruby seems interesting  for me in leveraging in
microcontroller development (http://rad.rubyforge.org/). While on the
other hand i am eager to learn what is there in offering from the
python campus (http://pyastra.sourceforge.net/). I am eager in
learning tools, and believe delivering solution is the paramount
objective. I believe being a language lawyer is no good ;).


cheers
Thyagarajan Shanmugham

PS: for  beginners, use ilugc meeting to present a solution with what
you  have learnt, this exercise  does not need the language skill like
that of Mr.Samuel johnson or technical skill like that of Mr.Torvalds.
In this way, people who are coming for the session will help and cheer
you, thus you will be motivated.

What does this mean?

Perhaps you should have multiple threads already running and waiting
for input from a despatcher. The despatcher takes the key pressed and
sends it to any waiting thread and then returns to waiting for a key
press. How effective this will be will depend on how much time 
each thread needs to complete processing.

Kapil.

I think you are approaching the problem the wrong way. Keyboard cannot 
give you multiple inputs for the different keys. The standard way to 
handle it in games and other places is to have a separate thread that 
monitors for keys and you look for time difference between keys to say 
if they are pressed simultaneously or they are pressed with significant 
time difference.

Keyboard and mouse are serial devices and will only send only key at a time.

Best of luck with the virtual piano..

Also don't forget to include HTTPfox plugin to your firefox. I really

The keyboard generates interrupts which you can handle : this would be very
much similar to the way one writes TSRs.
IMHO, writing 'your-own' threads for this would be an overkill when the OS
can capture the same event and give a handle on that to you.

(Q: Can dbus be used here??)

The standard keyboard controller (the chip inside the keyboard) does not
work like a piano keyboard. When the user presses a key, it sends the
corresponding 'scan code' to the OS's handler. If you keep pressing the same
key, it starts to go into a repeat mode to keep transmitting the scan code
again and again to the OS handler.  When you press another key while holding
down the previous key, on most controllers, the repeat mode kicks out and
sends the new key's scan code once and stops irrespective of weather the
user continues to hold both keys down or not. The only exception of
course is the special keys Alt, Ctrl & Shift. They can be used in
combination with other keys and your program can handle 2 keys (eg Alt+A,
Ctrl+A) together or even handle 4 keys (eg Alt+Ctrl+Shift+A) together, but
only the special keys.

But really, _please_ translate mails written in Tamil as a

Hi,

We wrote a shell script which will do some posting work and need to

It works fine when it is not cronned ,but it does not send mail when cronned.
I googled on this and found that we need some authentication for
sendmail to work when it is cronned. I tried the following cron-script
but it failed:

 echo "password" | sudo -u "username" -S script-to-send-mail.sh

please guide me on this problem

Is "script-to-send-mail.sh" accessible without path from cron

Did you happen to check the cron log to see what went wrong ?

PS: why do you want to change to appropriate user in the 
cron. Can't you set this cron for the respective user 
itself ?

Since ldap is running in 0.0.0.0:389, I guess it will be problem.

There is no entry regarding bind in /etc/ldap/ldap.conf 

If it won't be problem , then what else?

This may not be the reason at all. Maybe your ldap server is not
running with SASL at all? Try ldapadd with -x option. Also, I hope you
have given the proper rootdn with -D option.

It should be something like:
ldapadd  -x -D "cn=Directory Manager,dc=sample,dc=com" -W -f sample.ldif

>From www.phpmyadmin.net home page,

"Since version 3.0.0, phpMyAdmin joined the GoPHP5[1] initiative and
dropped compatibility code for older PHP and MySQL versions; version 3
and later requires at least PHP 5.2 and MySQL 5. To use with older PHP
or MySQL versions, use the older (but still maintained) branch of 2.x
releases, which you can find on the download page[2]. "

[1] http://gophp5.org/
[2] http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/downloads.php

So, you must upgrade php and mysql or use older version of phpmyadmin

Are you executing the job as a regular user or system cron?  
Accordingly, you must add MAILTO=<emailid> either in /etc/crontab or 
the user's crontab.

I am proud of your patriotic spirit - but this is a forum for linux, not
about classical, modern, post-modern vernacular poetry.  There are many
people who might not understand Tamil - what if everyone starts to write
poems in praise of their state/lanuage/religion/ culture yada yada..

This would degenerate and defeat the very purpose of this forum.

If you have any concerns or you are hurt by this mail, I would be glad to
address, but let's keep this off this form.

A TSR on a multi-threaded OS ??? What happens when there are multiple 
programs that require keyboard input? There is a reason TSRs went the 
way of dodo with DOS and single active process.

True. Hence i was apprehensive about suggesting this way, for i did not like
waiting in a while loop and getting the kbhit scancodes and dispatching it
to 108 threads waiting :)

IF win had a way in which the generated events could be caught(read MSDN
doc), then your problem becomes much simpler.

I suppose GOI == Govt. of India and MIT == Mass. Inst. of Tech?

Anyway, as for GOI (and PSUs under it), forget FOSS adoption; even open 
standards adoption is lip service.  Otherwise, we would not have broken 
e-governance sites (i.e. requiring MS Windows/IE combo to conduct 
business with the govt./psu).  Ditto for the states.

From what I have seen it is Ministry of Information and 
Telecommunications and commonly referred to as DoT, please see

I would not blame the government entirely for the latter. Most of the
time they outsource to our "software giants" most of whom produce the
websites in this broken fashion. (Note that infosys and tcs also
use IIS servers though their pages are less broken).

Of course, you could ask that the officers of the government become
more aware about computers and perhaps hire people to develop sites
for them. We have already see how poorly banks fare in this regard so
I would not wait for that to happen.

What is *required* is that centres like nic.in which are *supposed* to
help the government in setting up the sites do a little more homework
before outsourcing their work or before doing it themselves.

I basically agree with your mail that even while we worry about FOSS
adoption, a more basic thing is to ask for standards compliance in
e-governance.

given the present salary structure, the governent cannot afford to employ 
competent programmers. Max that NIC or CDAC pay is between 14-25K a month. 
The moment a person gets some experience, he leaves for the private sector. 
The max that NRC-FOSS pays for an engineering graduate is 14K and for a MSc 
is 18K - go figure.

Most of them are not outsourced but are done using out of date employees and
intern students .To earn brownie points.

As i said the Vendors are all over the place and they make it happen , So
the so called Govt Babu is happy in getting things done and earning the
brownie points than tinkering with Foss Solutions.There has been some
successes though in this direction but they are far and few.

Agreed but what happens when people are overwhelmed with thousands of pages
of documents and standards talk . The sales or presales person on the field
makes a fast killing in locking in the application early on,  so that the
Legacy continues to Live on ever after, and there company makes money year
after year.

I know this is armchair advice, but I think govt. institutions have a 
crucial difference from regular companies - they don't have a profit 
motive. If you make a BHAG (big, hairy, audacious goal) and promote it 
like crazy in the newspapers, I think there plenty of competent 
programmers who are willing to give it a go even at the risk of lesser 
salaries.

As I said, I might be completely off my rocker here, but when people can 
spend their free time writing code so that it will benefit the 
'community', why can't we engage the same idealistic sentiments for 
improving governance? The key, I think, is providing alternative reward 
system - viz., recognition. Or, if I can dare to be even more 
optimistic, probably just a big, crazy enough goal will do :).

Somehow I have a feeling that can work, because I've recently seen a 
couple of my close friends get actively involved with an NGO, even 
taking time off from their very well-paying jobs. Listening to their 
stories, plenty more are helping them, at least part-time. Even I'm 
tempted to go check out the place. So perhaps, it's just a matter of 
framing of a worthy goal and savvy marketing? Just my 2 paise :)

there are lots of idealistic people who are (or say they are) willing to work 
for lesser salaries. But 14K a month is too much of a drop for them. In three 
years I have found only *one* person who was willing to do so. (And he took a 
drop from 30K to 14K). A few others are around - but they have EMI burdens.

Hi,

My name is Bhargav Prasanna. I'm doing my bachelor's in Electrical and
Electronics Engineering in Meenakshi Sundararajan Egngineering
College, Kodambakkam, Chennai. My department conducts a national level
technical symposium called Epsilon every year on a chosen date in the
month of January/February. This february, my seniors are conducting
it. Next year, it'll be my batch's turn. As an ardent fan of FOSS and
a Linux lover, I feel i should do something in connection with linux
during Epsilon 2010.

Please send in yer suggestions.. Thanx..

Vamsee, as I understand, good software takes a lot of time to write. Writing
good software during "free time" is an incredibly difficult proposition. For
many important open source projects, the contributions come from people who
are trying to satisfy customers or release cycles with open source software
and get paid in the process by companies like RedHat and IBM. The end result
is that there is good quality open source software available that is done
on-the-job. For example, the most significant contributors to the kernel are
corporates.

I am very interested to see how the recognition based reward system will
work, it is a brilliant suggestion. But like Kenneth says, 14K in Chennai is
tough for survival and with a family, you can just forget all about it. The
point is that organizations must pay enough money so that money is no longer
a problem. With financial issues looming large, I don't see how the poor
guys can even think.

Well, 14k in Chennai is as good as earning 25k in Bangalore, and if you 
don't  have *your own family* it is very much possible to survive 
happily. It might not be the best option for long time but for a year or 
two, especially when you ought to be looking for gaining experience, a 
14k job is more than enough.

I am constantly amazed at the amount of time people have free to write 
software - good software. Makes me wonder when these guys sleep (if they 
sleep). I am mostly a watcher of django and wxPython and the python community 
in general. Most of the developers have full time jobs - fortunately for them 
the jobs usually involve the open source projects they are contributing to, 
so their free time development work also complements their full time job 
work.

And we have quite a few sleepless ones in India too - like Gopal from Yahoo! 
who does overtime work in Yahoo! and finds time for quality work in other 
projects. So people contributing in their free time is viable. But to what 
are they going to contribute? Even if the govt uses/develops open source for 
e-governance, the very nature of govt is to keep it secret and bar outside 
contributions. To date, barring a few minor things released by NRC-FOSS no 
government (or university or scientific institute in India has released 
anything as open source) - so even if free time developers are available, 
they have nothing to code on.

The other option is to develop open source egovernance software and get the 
governments to use it. This is also a no-go, because government is bound by 
the tender system of purchase of software - and open source software does not 
fit in here. The only exception I have seen is Sahana - and the adoption of 
that by various governments is mainly due to the backing of IBM.

yes, precisely, the people we get are freshers who want experience - not much 
use for writing quality software. What we need are experienced people who 
want to take a sabbatical.

Perhaps that's where the answer lies for both Shuveb's question and 
yours. Perhaps an organization like NRC-FOSS can have tie-ups with 
companies wherein employees can take an year's sabbatical and work on 
governance related projects. Looking at the current financial situation, 
I think companies should be open to this. They would obviously love to 
save money and look good at the same time.

Also, making it a short-term plan would encourage more experienced 
programmers with less commitments to try this out, without significant 
financial risk on their part.

Probably the best way to do this is to take up some project in sourceforge

http://live.gnome.org/GnomeLove is another good starting point.

Try some dummy apps first. Say a small calender. Then go ahead to gnome
love, get
the projects that need help and try your hand there.

The the larger question is the Indian Societal Structure and the
distance-factor that good-programmers(geeks) have from it.
Sabbaticals are still a dream (according to me) for many Indians - even
those Indians who are overseas.  For ex. I had quit my job and wandered
around, and got asked a zillion times as to what was wrong with me and
whether i was laid off or not.
Loss-of-pay is  considered a sin, and is primarily either for honeymoon or
maternal-leave.

Not referring to the 'programming scene' alone, but the same scenario exists
with backpackers/traveling. Not many go on dollar-a-day backpacking. And the
general travel bloggers that you see around(barring a few) are the ones who
stay in all the expensive hotels and wander around in the most crowded
places.From the travels that i have had, i clearly realized that you can at
the max show a person a door, it is for him to go and open it.

Am sure NRC-FOSS has a long way to go.

PS: I like this thread, for it has some genuine ideas and likes to tackle
the problem, than shouting arbit and yap(like in #linux-india)

I am for having it this year, but feb is the wrong month for it as there are 
many other conferences in feb. We could schedule it around September. We 
could also see who comes forward to bid for it - a group like the Jaya group 
would be good although there would be some logistics problems. We have learnt 
a lot of lessons from last year and am sure we could have a really good one 
this time. Last year's was good - so a better one this year.

true - my nephews in New Zealand took around ten years to qualify as doctors 
as they kept taking a year off to travel or to work with the 
underpriviledged. Even now, they keep taking a year or two off from their 
jobs now and then.

well, there are a lot of good guys with sound ideas on #linux-india. I had 
this same sabbatical discussion there. People from the much higher levels of 
employment *do* on occasion take time off, and are able to get re-employed 
when they come back. But not the general run of person. I have tempted a lot 
of people, but at the last moment they get scared and back off.

Well, don't get me started on the 'Indian Societal Structure' - from 
what I've seen so far, it's thoroughly corruptible and hypocritical to 
boot. I see no reason any young people of this generation should give a 
rat's behind about it. If the Indian society can learn how a global

sabbaticals too :).

Please provide English translation. 

Also please refrain from changing English threads into Tamil; it is very 
impolite to change the language in the middle of a discussion.

IIRC, way back there was general consensus that "Tamil" specific 
discussions would be Tamil and ditto for English discussions.

That is wierd. You might want to try libmad
http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/libmad0

But I'm not sure what all players support libmad. You could also try
gstreamer-plugins-mad

the list has agreed on this point. If he does not follow the consensus, there 
is nothing anyone can do as this is not a moderated list, and posting in 
tamil is not anti-linux/foss. So just ignore it.

Nothing intentional as such. Hope people would have seen translations on
event reports that we do also in English. Just the mood of moment while
replying.

Might have been typing something else in Tamil and as I read mails here that
get carried away..

Kindly tolerate as it is a list based at Chennai. Never mails in Tamil to a
list, having base outside TN.

Do not blow this out again :-)

We definitely need more activity here. I don't know how many of you read this:
http://boycottnovell.com/2009/01/04/microsoft-edgi-secrets/

Recently we have volunteered to contribute to IT systems for Lok Satta Party.
We are trying to provide all solutions using FOSS technologies. We have
plans to build some FOSS software too. Please let me know if any one of
you are interested. This is purely voluntary of course. 


Recently we built a data entry app in OpenOffice Base. We will take up
more projs as time permits. We can do more work if some of you
volunteer.
Our next step is a helping set up a helpdesk system and as we go fwd, we want to look at an Enterprise deployment like Liferay. Of course all software developed will be under GPL.

BSD symbolizes that we are just good. But GPL sends signal that we are not
just good but also able.

We need GPL with bad and able people around.

Ahem  Lok Satta certainly rings a bell , I remember Dr Anil Jampala
mentioning about it in one of the Lug meetings in Hyd. Hope he is in good
spirits after Satyam Fiasco,  Foss and Politics in India i think have come a
long way for example  http://www.lkadvani.in/eng/ is running on Linux , i am
sure there may be more instances of those , Who knows what will happen to
Foss after they win the election or the company who is helping them now.

talking about Hyd whats happening with  http://nisg.org/  and
http://www.hrdiap.gov.in/ about later i remember seeing a huge infra
structure made for training in M$ technologies thanks to M$.

Go ahead and scratch your itch with politicians , Let me guess  you must be
a comitee member for IT in LSP  if not can you ask them to change from IIS
to Apache and Windows2000  to Gnu/Linux , if you have not tasted it ,  it
would be a fun excercise on a small scale about the resistance to change and
fi and buts for buy in  . Yes i see they are using php in some way.

apt-get asks for confirmation only when the package size is large.
Small packages are downloaded and installed without confirmation.

Hello,

The behaviour depends on the setting of the variable
APT::Get:Trivial-Only and APT::Get::Assume-Yes.

If you run "apt-get install pkgname" and this has no additional
dependencies then it will not prompt you since it is doing exactly
what you asked it to and nothing more.

On the other hand, if there are additional dependencies and
"Assume-Yes" is "False" then it will prompt you since it is
installing additional stuff. This may further depend on whether
recommended pacakges are among the dependencies etc.

The idea is "principle of least surprise". If you want to eliminate
surprise all together, then use the "--download-only" switch to
download the relevant packages before installing them. If you feel
that the surprise level is too high then set "Trivial-Only" to
"True".

Kapil.

This is borked. Installing packages silently without the user's permission
is certainly bad. What difference does it make if the package size is small ?

Does the same behaviour exist if you are using a 3rd party repo ?

..etc.

Yes, as long as you have imported the repositories GPG key with
apt-key.

I forgot this point in my original post. The etch and later apt-get
will _always_ prompt you if you are installing a package which is not
"verified". Verification means:
 the package is listed in a package list containing package checksums
 and that package list is signed with a key known to apt-key.

Regards,

Kapil.

1.Your configuration seems to be wrong, make sure that these things
are properly set

model =
port =
connection =

2. Your mobile model number is not in the tested phones list
http://wiki.gnokii.org/index.php/Config#Supported_phones so there is
no guarantee that your mobile will work with gnokii

3. You need to use appropriate cable if it is a wired connection.

4. Learn gnokii commands you should start with "gnokii --identify".

my final year project is based on gnokii, though i have not started to
work on my project yet, please let me know if it works.

It is to specify the memory to be used for read/write messages.

Subject: [Ilugc] USB datacard issue
Message-ID: <4972EAD5.6000309@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using Airtel datacard on my Ubuntu 8.04.  I am able to connect and 
use the internet services.  But when the connection fails, I am not able 
to connect back without rebooting the system.  The modem does not seem 
to be identified.  Not sure why.   I dont have this issue when the 
wvdialler manually and restart the connection.

Error I get -

--> WvDial: Internet dialer version 1.60
--> Cannot get information for serial port.
--> Initializing modem.
--> Sending: ATZ
--> Sending: ATQ0
--> Re-Sending: ATZ
--> Modem not responding.

Its a USB based modem.

$lsusb
Bus 005 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 
*Bus 003 Device 003: ID 12d1:1001 Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. E620 USB

Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000

Any pointers on why I have to reboot and how to avoid it?

Have you tried unplugging the modem and re-plugging after about 15
seconds or so.

USB devices sometimes misbehave and I have found this to work.

Reboot is always a drastic solution to be avoided!

When I was trying to get my friend's Huawei EC 121 (Reliance) modem
working, I had the same issue. In my case, the problem was there even
if I had started the connection manually using wvdial and then brought
it down manually.

I found the same workaround. Once the connection was down only
unplugging it and re-plugging it would work.

True! I never needed to reboot, unplugging and replugging always worked.

Can you elaborate on what do you mean by use case and test case?  There 
are RFCs that define the feature set of each protocol you have listed.  
From them you can extract the purpose of the protocol i.e. use case.  
Likewise, from the features of the protocol you can you can create the 
test case(s).

I understand the GPL well and am comfortable with it and I also thought GPL will be more popular on this list. But point taken.

I am a recent volunteer and not a committee member. 
I understand the resistance you are talking about. I have been an evangelist for quite some time now and have had my share of wins and losses.
My strategy is to take it slow and steady - one step at a time. 
I have volunteered to build some apps and since the tech/license for these is my choice alone, all of them will be on FOSS technologies and will be under GPL. 
The reason I am GPLing them is so that everybody can use them. I hope LokSatta is as clean as it is projected. If not, these modules will be useful to any party. 
The web-site is hosted by an external agency based out of Bombay and I am not touching it right now. 


I would all readers to not be too cynical. It may be difficult but we definitely need to make an attempt.

Please do make it a point to vote for your favorite party on election day. 
Remember that every single vote *does* count.

This one i do not agree slow and steady may be but it has to be worked in

Can you share this plan or information with wider audience .... some wiki or

i do not understand who are you referring to as cynic? and definitely it is

How  do you expect to do that  when your Voter ID is not ready , forget
about it your name does not appear in electoral after having applied
multiple times ..... may be you can help folks in this direction too.

yes i have seen some private people coming forward in this direction with
campaigns and website like jagore.com but those too have been just sort of
sharing information and passing real onus on to the EC .

yes all these changes are in process through refroms , if political party or
people will bring in those reforms still its to be looked to be seen .... i
think this is going way OT now  ;-)

again i have a different itch to scratch and only one life to live ... back

when you say both network, what  do you mean? Do you mean that LAN
should be able to access Internet via both these links? If so, where
do printer, SVN, Samba figure? Are you talking of client coming in
from the outside via these links?

Please give sufficient data in an understandable form for others to

Message-ID: <72a9b0620901182304q147334f9i44352e6f31aaa492@mail.gmail.com>

I don't know this is info is already available to you. Still i am sharing it
with you.

I came across wubi, an offically supported ubundu installer for windowz. it
works with very very simple steps. extremely useful for guys
who doesn't want to lose their windowz OS in single step!
http://wubi-installer.org/
http://wubi-installer.org/faq.php

steps
1. download wubi.exe
2. if you have ubundu desktop 8.10 ISO image, keep it in same folder as
wubi.exe is.
    If not available, wubi will download the image from internet.
3. start wubi.exe
4. Select username and password for ubundu administrator.
5. click install.

If ISO is already available, wubi will finish its work within 5 minutes (You
dont have time to have a coffee!). otherwise wait till ISO image is
downloaded. After finishing its work it will ask for a reboot. On reboot,
Boot menu will appear, select ubundu to boot. Your ubundu will get
installed. After finishing its installation, you have Ubundu controlling
your system!

The great side of this software is, it does not require any new
partitioning, one resistance I face from people when I say install Ubundu.
For any typical windowz guys, this will look like   installing another
windowz software in his system!

Hi,

MAILTO=<emailid> guided me to find what was the problem with sendmail when
cronned.

The Problem was " sendmail: command not found ". So, sendmail when cronned
requires its *complete path*. Eg. /usr/sbin/sendmail as in my case.

Thankyou for your valuable suggestions. Now, sendmail is sending mails when
it is cronned.

Hi,

Which toolkit are you using from python? Your answer will really
depend on that. Python itself doesn't go too far in this kind of
functionality.

I do not understand the intent here. What do you mean by saying "eth1
and eth2 should not share internet"? It will be easier if you state
what you want to achieve. Is it that you want occupants of one floor
to use Airtel for internet access and the other to use the TATA link?

This is possible.

Handling 2 Internet connection is very much possible in Linux Env. So 
1st setup the system to handle one connection, use following link:

www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-setup-transparent-proxy-squid-howto.html

Once it is working, you can add the another connection with little 
modification.

Your diagram helps clarify your intent :)  You are one of the few in 
thousands who have asked networking questions and do not bother to say 
it with a picture!

NOTE: given your topology, you will have to ip "alias" one of the 
192.168.x.y networks.  You can keep the two net traffic completely 
segregated if you can add another NIC.  Nonetheless, you can redirect 
the traffic from the 2 nets to the respective ISPs with iptables rules.

Yup, I think that is what he means, otherwise his query does not make 
any sense given the context of his net diagram.

Agree, but the target audience for these studies are people who don't 
bother to find out for themselves for various sources and come to their 
own conclusion.  To the uninitiated, these reports paint a rosy picture

Guys,
To make things happen & turn each?and every stone, actual transformations, reformations (say in Indian socieal structure as someone pointed out...) and essential systems need to be in place.
?
Essential systems could be like sabbaticals, promoting entrepreneurs & new ventures, incubating new ideas etc.
?
Only when there is a real economics and a real eco-system revolving around whatever avenues you think of (like sabbaticals) for mobilising something related to FOSS, you can minimize your 'distance-factor'.
?
Thanks,
Selva.

I am trying to install dspace-1.5.1 ( an institutional repository) in my
debian machine. Here, in one step, i need to use ant installer. So, i used *ant
fresh_install* there. But, it failed. It shows me the error:

*Unable to locate tools.jar. Expected to find it in

But, i am pretty much sure that, i have installed jdk1.5.06 in my *
/usr/local/java/jdk1.5.0_06/*

Here are the lines from my /etc/profile:

export PATH

Can anyone please help me? I need it really badly.

I was reminded of
http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/compare/windows-server-vs-red-hat-linux.mspx
I was stunned at the stupidity of the so-called "IT giant" when it pointed
out
that the only manageability feature of RHEL was the yum update tool.
Can they be so stupid? (Yeah.. They are). I soon realized that it was yet
another
MBA guy who has never used a more complicated software than MS Paint who
must have reviewed the OSes.
Open Standards != Open Source? Why Microsoft does not even bother about
interoperability. It expects others to spend time making it interoperable
with its
crap OS. That is sickening since M$ has probably the most useless API one
can
ever come across. MFC huh? Most <The f word>ed Classes. Now .nOt!

Maybe there was a link in the page you pointed to too.

I agree with M$ that there is no silver bullet in security. The only thing
they dont seem
to realize is that there is no way of patching an OS that is fundamentally
flawed. It M$
did feel that the admin user was an irritance, why did they add that to XP
and Vista?


>From the days when Linux pointed out the places where it was deployed, M$
seems to
have had to hunt deeply for finding out a city that used M$ software. I
guess the mayor
was clueless anyway. I can't believe my eyes when I see a reliability column
in that
page.

If I argued like M$ did(reinterpreting every definition), I would say a
leader is one who
keeps his people happy. So every clown is a leader!

Out of 100 people Microsoft employs, 80 are MBA grads, 9 are lawyers, 9 are
spokesmen
and the 1 HR rep? Coders, anyone? I wonder how Leslie Lamport and Simon
Peyton Jones
joined there. Maybe it is the assurance that M$ will never use the quality
software that they
create.

Now, if this is what you want to do with one machine, it is quite involved.

Given the kind of information you've given so far, I'd reckon you are
better of setting up one proxy server per floor and have the
appropriate link connected to that linux machine.

If you want to do it with 1 machine, the scheme as under can be used.
You'll have to toil hard to understand, compile and implement this.
I've not tried this before.
1. Set up 2 route tables say t1 and t2. t1 has Airtel as the default
route and t2 has TATA.
2. Place each floor in different subnets. Let us say s1 - 192.168.1.x
is floor1 (Airtel) and s2 - 192.168.2.x is floor2 (TATA).
3. Compile squid with the qos-enabled patch/option.
4. Write rules in squid to mark TOS bytes for connections it makes on
behalf of requests coming from s1 as value X and from s2 as value Y.
5. Write ip rules to direct packets with TOS value X to lookup routes
on t1 and that with Y from route table t2.

Did some more reading up on the part I've not used i.e. squid tos
marking. Looks like it supports only blanket outgoing tcp TOS marking
without any rule based support. What I listed out will not work then.

Alternative:
1. Ditch Squid and go for a simple gateway based solution.
2. Write ip rules to identify connections from s1 or s2 and direct
them for lookup to tables t1 and t2 respectively.

Any evangelist or sales persons job is to highlight all the

Bashing the competition is commonplace market practice.

htpasswd is not a SVN command. htpasswd comes along with apache
(http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/htpasswd.html). Try using
htpasswd command instead of htpasswd2.

well, you gotta do loads of things in addition to _just_ installing it.
Though i would like to help you out by directly pointing to the solution,
but googling is fun.

[hint] Do you want to allow other developers to access your repository? If
yes, then you gotta have web-dav access too.
If it is just for organizing your files, then you dont need it over http.

I do not hate Microsoft. I am just annoyed that the so-called biggest IT
company
on earth did not even spend considerable time in testing the competition. I,
in fact,
often recommend people don't start throwing out comments against Microsoft.

I am sorry if I sounded stupid in the last post. Looking at it, it is clear
I did. It was
just the time at which I replied and the mood I was in that made it that
murky.

Proprietary software in education is very much worse than computer viruses.

Yes,
Mepco is the number one customer for microsoft.I guess they are the first to
buy Windows server 2008 :( .Seems to be they are going to replace the
existing centos squid server with the new windows 2008 server.

I guess your workshop will improve things here.

You haven't told us what version you installed and how the install went
through.
Incase, you need assistance with the web setup, this might be of some help.

A core file is generate when a program does something
wrong like dereference a NULL pointer.  The OS saves
the entire state of the process in the core file and terminates
the process.

You can use gdb to examine the core file in detail.


Look for a daemon that's repeatedly crashing and creating
core files.  Are you running a web server on this machine?


Run "ulimit -c 0" to set core file size to zero bytes and
you will not get any more core files.  This needs to be run
before the offending process is started.  limits.conf can control
this behavior globally.

Modern Linux machines have fine grained control of how
core files are created.  Google produced this nice article:
    http://aplawrence.com/Linux/limit_core_files.html

Can you do a file core to see which process is generating this core?

$ sudo file sleep.core
sleep.core: ELF 32-bit LSB core file Intel 80386, version 1 (FreeBSD),
FreeBSD-style, signal 11, pid 15278, from 'sleep'

(sudo in your case might not be required)

And once it is done, you can figure out what the process is doing either
by debugging it with gdb or reading the log files etc.

To debug it using debug, gdb <processname> <corefile>

Also, the reason why ulimit is not working in your case because the
process is already running. Your settings will work only for processes
that are started subsequently from your shell where you did the settings.

See the link I posted earlier.  It's got info on how you can config
where the core files are created.  You need to echo something
in /proc.

Temporary option is to set the format to just "/tmp/core", and
create a unwriteable file (touch /tmp/core; chmod 000 /tmp/core).
This will stop creating core files and and give you time to
investigate further.

One more way to trace the culprit.

$ lsof /tmp

or

$ watch lsof /tmp

this will list processes which are currently using /tmp directory.

Eg:

mokka@mohan-laptop:~$ lsof /tmp
COMMAND    PID  USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE   NODE NAME
seahorse- 7398 mokka  cwd    DIR    8,6 4096 441505 /tmp
mokka@mohan-laptop:~$

It should be $ gdb binfile corefile

As of now, you have only core file and you have to find the bin file,
which generate the core. With present setting, you have to monitor all
the processes (PID and Program name). Once core created (core.PID),
you need to find the Program name by checking the PID.

The above step is bit complicated. So you can try the following:

echo "core.%N.%P" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_name_format

Now core file will be created like this

core.prgname.pid

Now it is easy to find the process name.

I did an ls -al on /tmp and found it is apache that is the culprit

                   i am really happy after reading all the replies.

                  really  thanks for providing the book references for
TCP/IP . but I am more eager to know things practically.

               so, if possible any one can come to my college to conduct
practical seminar on current TCP/IP topics.

              And i have also made intra(local) network using Wi-Fi among 40
systems in my college lab using ubuntu .

              the Ip address range is   192.168.1.1 to .40

Thanks for the link Arun.

It is surprising how far Linux has traveled, to make Microsoft
marketing people to practically blabber. Anyone with even a limited
working knowledge of Linux will find statements about Red Hat Linux
stomach churning.

http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver/compare/windows-server-vs-red-hat-linux.mspx

First they laugh at  you
Then they ignore you
Then they fight you

No need to hate Microsoft. Pity can be a more appropriate feeling.

You can do a dmesg and check if something relevant is there. From the 
dmesg output we can find what causes the problem. I think this is an 
error related to drivers not able to mount a device or something like 
that. Need more details to be sure.

Definitely feasible. I wonder what you means by HTTPS though. All
others are doable on a server.

I assume you want to serve IP addresses to the two floors in the two
different IP subnets. I do not think you can control how addresses are
served unless you tie them down to MAC addresses of the client in the
DHCP configuration or identify clients by OS types (need to use
if/match declarative with booleans for multiple match consitions).

If a DHCP server has multiple pools to serve from, will it serve an IP
address in the same subnet as the primary IP of the ethernet card over
which the DHCP request was received? I've not tried this. Believe
should be logical to do so though doc/man does not say so explicitly.
Has anyone else tried this with multiple ethernet cards and different
subnets?

It seems like DHCP servers do figure out subnets connected to the
client. However, having 2 logical subnets on the same segment still
will have problems. Options would be to group clients using user class
option in dhcp.conf. This, however, assumes that the client is
configurable to send user class along with the DHCP request/discover
message. You will need to check if this is feasible in your current
clients.

If you've static/known users, simple option is to group by MAC.

we before you start working on php, you need to learn the fund's of web
technologies, atleast you should aware of the following.

XHTML - http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/,
javascript, CSS - w3schools.com, zendgarden.com,
PHP - php.net is an ideal resource to learn all about php,
MySQL - mysql.com,


if you have issues contact me offlist,

good luck

hi,
in installing mod_python in apache2, the module has a line:
<IfDefine HAVE_PYTHON>
where do I define this? I remember doing this once on a Sabayon system - but 
cannot remember where the relevant file is.

IIRC, file name depends on the distribution you are using. On fedora
it goes to /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
This may be of some help http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#ifdefine

First of all, forget the software. We have a paper called "Visual
Programming".
The paper is brilliant taking into account the fact that we actually write
esoteric C
branded the Win32 API. Whether I use the knowledge of the API and of VC++, I
know
not. But I have most certainly got a lot of insights as to how we can twist
C. I wonder
if even Microsoft actually uses its Win32 API now.

I wouldn't blame Anna University through and through for the usage of these
tools. They
always consider the lowest common denominator. So when they teach a Civil
guy a
word processor, they teach him Microsoft Word and Excel. Consider the fact
that they
taught him OpenOffice  or Abiword with gnumeric. At the XYZ civil company he
goes to,
they are going to be running <TADA!> Microsoft Office. Being from a
software-ignorant
background, they are used to Abiword instead!

Btw. Oracle? We used MS Sql server. A different trigger syntax, other
non-std stuff,
It was |-|3|_|_.

When it comes to graphics, we actually don't have too many Adobe
replacements atm.
As the condition improves, we will have to sort this out.

Please consider the other end of the spectrum too. For Network Programming
and Mgmt,
we use Unix Network Programming Vol:1.

The operating systems lab was based on GNU/Linux.

As Ravi Jaya pointed out, you should first learn the basics of web
development. A very good starting point is http://w3schools.com ; where you
should learn html, xhtml, css, javascript first (if you don't know them
already). They also have a very nice beginners tutorial on php.

After that, you will get a large number of resources from the internet. (
php.net, tutorialized.com etc.)

Hello,

I have a dual boot Kubuntu 8.04/Windows XP Pro machine and would like to 
purchase a basic PCI (not PCI-Express) add-in sound card.  The 
applications that I plan to use are Sightspeed video conference, Skype 
audio chat, and listening to music (2.1 sound).  The first two on 
Windows, the last two on Linux.

Could you recommend a basic sound card that is available for purchase in 
Chennai that will work on Windows and Linux?  What kind of price should 
I expect?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <4986ffac0901240705s3b17a33fk300692678a836455@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

My computer, started crashing pretty frequently, after installation of
Ubuntu 8.10. The question I want to know is, what logs do I read to figure
out what exactly went wrong?
I know this is pretty ambiguous, so here are some more details.

I've already checked out kern.log, syslog, dmesg logs, daemon logs. Nothing
seems suspicious. Clipped version is here :-
http://pastebin.com/md487ccc

My hardware config:-
http://pastebin.com/m130ac839

I think the possibility could be pidgin and/or gnome-do (cause i've enabled
a number of plugins which came with it), and am currently logging it in
debug mode, just in case....
I'm not expecting anyone to solve the problem for me here, just want notice
on how to proceed, what to look out for..?

Thanks,
Venkatesh Nandakumar

It's still pretty ambiguous because you haven't defined what do you mean 
by "crash". What does it actually crash and when? When it is showing the 
splash screen during boot up? or at the login screen? or after you have 
logged in and when the desktop is loading up? Or when the desktop has 
completely loaded and there is some app started on first login? Unless 
you tell it out it's very hard to diagnose what's causing the problem.

Well, that's weird. Any help asked is generally towards solving the 
problem. Even if we say how to proceed and what to look for, it's 
towards finding the culprit and solving the problem.

Care to explain? If you prefer using one distro at the same time not 
comfortable with some other distro,
you are free to prescribe your favourite distro to people but that 
doesn't mean you can call other distros as crap.

The same crash can also happen in a (assumed) reliable distro!!, then should
he come back to ubuntu?

Au contraire, it's so much more fun to diss things.  We shouldn't be
too particular about keeping it civil, so much more fun to be fighting

What exactly does crash mean? Choose one of the following:
 * some programs stop working
 * the user gets logged out
 * the computer stops responding to keyboard/mouse/network
 * the computer reboots
 * something else

All answers have equal marks and there is negative marking ;)

When you posted a question about KMail a while ago, it would have
been possible to reply "KMail is crap --- use mutt!" but no one did
that. People on this list actually tried to help you.

It would be nice if you showed similar courtesy to others.

Hi,

It crashes after its fully up and running..Usually, 2-3 hours+ after
starting up. The system just freezes. My Caps-Lock indicator starts
blinking(and that's when I get the indication :) ), and that's pretty much
it.

Try memcheck on boot to test your memory.Faulty RAM can be a reason.

That could be. I had recently upgraded my RAM. I had added 2GB RAM 667Ghz
RAM to a already exisiting 512MB 533 Mhz RAM. So now both are running at 533
MHz.. Would it help if I just remove the 512 MB RAM? I'd do a memory check
also.


Thanks,

I suspect you have hardware/heating problem.  Open up the side panels of 
your cabinet see if that helps.

Do you get kernel panic messages? Also, run memtest on your RAM.

BTW, please trim your messages of irrelevant stuff like message 
footers ...

IIRC KG (NRC-FOSS), in an earlier related thread, had mentioned a Sep/09 
time frame - reason being conflicts with other FOSS events in the 
country being held in Feb/09.

Very likely. If possible boot off another distro (which can be booted
from a disc) and see if this happens. If it does, its more likely a
hardware problem.

As for Ubuntu being crap, I've been using (and still using) Ubuntu
7.10 from 10/07 and have not felt the necessity to upgrade.... though
I hear the later versions are much better.

Well, if you are happy with your current then you dont have to upgrade;
though there might be some issues when some package bugs etc are to be
ported. I havent faced any problem - I upgraded from fiesty to hardy, due to
compiz problems and some bugs.

I have been having similar issues, but could zero it to Overheating as
hardware and RAM tests were ok. When my laptop was overheating, no
matter how many times I rebooted it, it still crashed with blinking
Caps-Lock and I had to manually power off and restart.

But one weird thing I noticed here is that, the laptop never failed to
crash in the GUI mode when overheating. But when I used one of the
consoles (Ctrl+Alt+F1-F6) it didn't crash at all. But when I tried to
return to the GUI, it promptly crashed. Could there be any
explanations for this?

ubuntu has a habit of releasing untested stuff - and winds up giving a bad

If you are tired, dont you think you should be part of it too. High time
that you should consider going to some silent green mountain and playing
golf :P Instead of helping, you stated something that aint credible and also
clearly hijacked the thread.

In my own little effort, i have made people move to(or atleast try) Ubuntu
from Windows - not that the latter sucks, but Ubuntu is better and 'safer'.

that was my personal opinion. However the LUG has decided otherwise. As a 
member of the LUG, although I do not agree with what is decided, I will work 
my hardest to make this a good conference.

I have to disagree. I cannot think of a better distro than Ubuntu/Mint to
give to some noob
friend of mine. Fedora was on my list because of aesthetics. But it looks
like Fedora does
not, unlike ubuntu, give you a 1 click way of adding mp3 codecs etc. And
Ubuntu is quite
stable. Do you expect them to run Debian Lenny? Ubuntu is good for newbies
since they
have a community of them. Any person in #debian asking about something very
simple
like how to query a package will get an rtfm

While Ubuntu may not be the best distro for the hardcore Linuxers, it is a
good starting
point.

rrrright ! So do you think it is in some way better to encourage people to ditch 
FOSS and go back to windoze by being entirely unhelpful and rude when they ask 
for help on a mailing list ?

What exactly did it do? You are just making general pointless
statements! With this kind of 'informed opinion', no wonder your
friends think they are better of with 'windoze'.

I, too, agree that this might be a problem with the processor
overheating. If your motherboard reports temperatures over ACPI, you can
obtain the current temperature like this:

    cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM/temperature

If you want to see if this is a real problem, try doing the following in
at a prompt: (it's one line)

   while (true) do cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM/temperature >>
~/temp.log; sleep 20; done

Leave the terminal open and use the computer as normal, and when it
crashes, check ~/temp.log to see if it shows too high a temperature. If
it does, you might have to check if your fans are working/covered with
dust/blocked.

The blinking lights signify a kernel panic. A likely source of the
kernel panic is a fault in the wireless driver. Is your kernel image up
to date? Could you try removing the iwl3945 module and using just wired
ethernet for a while just to see if that's the problem?

    sudo rmmod iwl3945

In which case, an acceptable response should contain the following
information:
1. An example of a reliable distribution.

In any case, your method of handling the situation has certain flaws. As
a result of your initial post, the following things have happened:
1. Some Ubuntu users have felt the need to mention that they have been
using Ubuntu without any problem for a while now.
2. A whole new thread has formed to talk about your response.
3. Your response will reinforce the idea that there is infighting in the
Linux community.

The following things have not happened:
1. The user has changed the distribution he is using in an effort to
solve the problem.
2. The user has obtained information that moves him closer to solving
the problem.

In essence, your response added no value to the conversation.

While I don't normally reply to blatant troll posts, it is important to
nip this behaviour in the bud. Kindly refrain from taking your personal
frustrations out on everybody.

Have a nice day :)

Perhaps your problem is just incorrectly configured graphics drivers?
This could cause high CPU load in X (and consequently overheating, if
that's what you detect).

I have iwl3945 and nvidia-glx drivers working out of the box right from
the day I installed Ubuntu Hardy some 6 or 7 months back.

This issue happened a couple of days back and went away only after the
laptop cooled down. Now after that I haven't had any crashes though
there has been some heat in the base of my laptop as it had been the day
of frequent crashes.

I was googling for this problem and I found some resources saying that
ACPI support wasn't that good in Ubuntu Hardy's default kernel. I don't
know if that applies to my case. But I want to dig more into it and
exactly zero in to the problem.

Thank you.

Guruprasad.

I see. Please do share if it does turn out that Ubuntu Hardy has trouble
with ACPI and if you do manage to isolate the problem. I have also had
problems with heat in the past (though the computer has never stopped on
its own before) and would like to know.

Possibly, I've installed sensors-applet for that now, to keep a check
of the temp. I have a laptop.

> Do you get kernel panic messages? Also, run memtest on your RAM.

Seems like a kernel panic, following
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/308471/comments/3
I've set kernel.panel = 15 to sysctl.conf, If it reboots for me after
the hang, then now I'd be sure of it.
The bug report is same problem that I have.

I just cant, I have no access to internet otherwise except college's wifi.

No, `top` does not show high load due to X or any particular process.

I found the link given in this comment
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/308471/comments/4
too technical, but the method says it would be able to print kernel
messages even with a system freezes (Lines 45-53). Do you think it
would be beneficial in my case?

More like Fedora is a more oriented towards Free and open source 
software and cannot because it is patent encumbered codec and a US based 
distribution cannot legally point to patent encumbered codecs. However 
it is trivial to get mp3 codec support in Fedora

http://www.fedorafaq.org/

To enable some extras, repositories:

# rpm -Uvh http://rpm.livna.org/livna-release-10.rpm

http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm 


# yum install gstreamer-plugins-ugly

Clicking on the release package in http://rpmfusion.org is a point and

it seems ftp server is not running, run nmap on 192.168.1.50 and check
whether ftp is running and its correspond port is opened.

Note : Running nmap on an external server is not recommended

Mandriva  aka Mandrake is no better. I had worst experience with it when
I installed in a doctor's house. It messed the partition table and the windows partition gone. Worst thing is the trouble with partition manager was filed as bug during beta stage itself. Still they preferred to release.

Needless to say that was the last time I touched Mandrake.

          With just one month around, organising is going to be really
tough. Would have been better if it had been sometime in July, wherein
we have enough time to organise(and no exams/vacations to hinder) and
better having it in September as it will not collide with SFD.

Don't agree, clearly hills ain't silent anymore ;-)

Agree, in all my time spent on recommending linux to more demanding users
back in college Ubuntu fit the bill in almost all cases on a variety of hardware
where even redhat and other high profile distros failed.

>but Ubuntu is better and 'safer'.

I kinda respectfully disagree, it does "barf" when it shouldn't.

Nevertheless, it does serve it purpose of converting people.

We should spend time educating them, when you click on mp3 files in 
Fedora, you will be redirected to

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Multimedia

Release notes is very clear on this as well

I am trying to make wget work from behind a proxy. i have set the
proxy in 'http_proxy' environment variable and using this command

wget --proxy-user="myname" --proxy-passwd="passwd"
http://www.iitm.ac.in/downloads/newsupdates/GJ%20&%20Research%20Park.ppt

i get the error "407 Proxy Authentication Required"

able to ping the proxy server. firefox works fine with the proxy (with
authentication). have tried with dedian & ubuntu, still getting the
same error.

i face similar problem while using apt and synnaptic.

It's not advisable to pass username/passwords in the command
line for any application.  Anyone running "ps" can see the entire
command line and thus know your password.

Instead set the username/password in your http_proxy, ftp_proxy
environment variables themselves like this:

export http_proxy="http://username:password@hostname:port"
export ftp_proxy="http://username:password@hostname:port"

Don't type the above in your bash prompt, put it in a shell
script or your .bash_profile and set appropriate file permissions.

Special characters in your password may get garbled
unless you quote/escape them correctly in the command
line.

Try putting the username/password in a wgetrc and see
if that makes any difference.

You're just making it difficult for people to take you seriously. Unless 
there is a vast silent section of people in ILUGC who take their 
technology decisions because you said so :p.

It is very important that people understand the importance of mailing lists.
It is very common for n00bs to search for some terms and
stumble on posts - and if they do stumble on posts like this, then we have
lost them!

And in this case, it is very unfortunate that we have to deal with a senior
member in the community, who i suppose is considering this as some social
experiment. Kapil's link <http://donotfeedtheenergybeast.com/> is more than
enough for this mail chain and does it succinctly.

No more discussion possible on the date as it is fixed for several reasons
by the host duly taking into consideration the short time available.

We had one full year from Feb 1 2008. What did we do? Just discuss on mailing list. Now that somebody has come forward to host it let us think about what can be done to make it success. 

Let us volunteer to make the conference success.

Is the proxy under your control. Some super-intelligent admins check for Browser identification and set rules based them. I had headache with such

For those unable to attend, can you please confirm if you would host
presentations, papers, video of the sessions etc please? In case it is
too heavy on bandwidth, can we have DVDs burned and sent out for a

You need a lot of newbies for a movement like FOSS to thrive.
If u do not take them also along, the movement gradually dies.
I recall and earlier article written by Mr Niyam Bushan in Linux
for You regarding the importance of newbies.
Unfortuantely I donot have the URL. 
And I think Ubuntu does this very nicely, thank you.
I do not care for any other opinion.

what kind of authentication does your proxy require? is it ntlm? wget, apt and 
synaptic cannot do ntlm authentication and so cannot use an ntlm-auth proxy. 
(actually, wget can do ntlm auth, it can do proxy, but cannot do ntlm auth on 
the proxy).

I had a similar problem. I was able to set it up in lynx however. Anyway, be

I use Hardy on Acer Aspire 4520 (AMD 64 bit with GeForce 7000M).
For me its from Choosing-the-OS(have a dual boot) to Login = 20sec.

Am working on getting some tweaks to reduce the time from PowerOn to
Choosing-the-OS - i get some device faults initially which is purely due to
my hardware and hence am not including the time for this phase in my
boot-time.

Simple Two Steps:
1) $ sudo sysv-rc-conf
and then removed all those programs(press 'space' on the 'X's) from the boot
sequence which i _felt_ were garb.
Make a note of these. [Do note that some of the programs in here are
important, and dont squid around.]

2) Go to /etc/rc0.d and /etc/rc6.d rename the files(the one corresponding to
the above which have no 'X's) from K.... to k.
     i.e, if a file is called K09apache2 , then rename(mv) it to k09apache2.
     Basically, we dont want these files but neither can we remove them and
hence rename it to something _easily-recoverable_.

I now save 20-30secs by doing the above. Let me know if the above helped.

Note: the above have been done by reading some articles
online(this<http://nostarch.com/download/howlinuxworks_ch3.pdf>one is
good, google for more) and am sure that there is more to tweak than
this.

Prasad,

Is that your laptop is compaq with AMD64? Because my compaq had the same
overheating problem when I bought. I really had a tough time running
flash(not 10, older) with the same iwl3945 nvidia-glx driver in hardy. I
 finally got to update my BIOS to f.30 version. This solved my laptop's
overheading problem and also somehow I managed to run Ubuntu 24 Hours
without a flash crash.

If you still have overheating problem in your laptop, kindly update your
BIOS. It may help you.

Thanks,
Mohan.

Hello,

I have a BSNL DSL connection with a UTStar 300R2 modem.

I have found that I need to reduce the MRU of the connection to 1452 bytes
in order to pop from gmail.com and access certain other secure sites.
I tried to set up a new VPI/VCI 0/35 connection with the MRU of 1452
bytes, but that setting reverts to 1492 on the next power cycle.

At the moment, I'm manually setting the MRU to 1452 on every power on.
Is there a way to permanently reduce the MRU?

Thanks.

Ajit

Fedora has a few and more than half a dozen custom variants as well.

The different variants (known as spins within Fedora) is available at

Google search "ethernet mru" gave me the following, that might be the 
solution for you, on the first page.

<http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/net/0105.0/0015.html>

Put the command in rc.local or similar file that is executed at boot up.

Well. I run arch too. I am not exaggerating, but my Arch boot time is 9
seconds.
I backgrounded all the daemons. In my /etc/rc.conf (The arch sys conf file)

DAEMONS=(syslog-ng @network @netfs @crond @httpd @alsa @mpd).

It is safer not to background syslog-ng. UDev takes the maximum time (3
seconds).
The rest disappear as soon as they arrive. And @ backgrounds the processes.
I dont use a login manager. I log into screen as soon as I log in.

Also, of all the login managers I have used, slim was the fastest. It added
3-5 seconds
to the startup. Just uncomment the line in /etc/inittab. Some of this
speedgain comes
because Arch Keeps it Simple!

My setup is pretty much the same, minimal startup applications and a lightweight
WM, fluxbox, which does exactly what one expects from a WM, just manage the fscking
windows and leave the user alone.

My daemons array is:

DAEMONS=(syslog-ng network @crond @sshd @alsa @dbus @hal @fam @xinetd)

I did use slim, but then moved to XDM, because I wanted to use the fancy finger-swipe
login in thinkpads. :-)
And fluxbox takes about 2 seconds to kick in, and a minimal xinitrc helps here.
Mine is:

xscreensaver -no-splash &
xset -b
xmodmap ~/.xmodmaprc
conky -d
ischedule -f ~/Docs/mycal.ics -g "+20+800" --fn -xos4-terminus-medium-*-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-* &

And after this, Emacs takes over my life. :)

But perhaps the best explanation would be that Arch doesn't assume the user to be dumb.
And yes everybody on this list pounced on KG with a holier-than-thou attitude,
yes, his cranky replies didn't do the list or anybody any good, but I freely acknowledge
that Ubuntu sucks mightily. But he certainly could have done better than friggin' Mandriva. :)

Subject: [Ilugc] changing the bootup welcome message in Fedora
Message-ID: <93655eb70901270723u677ff2a0saae967a02cfbb291@mail.gmail.com>

The welcome message which appears on Fedora just before starting udev
can be changed. The standard message is something like "Welcome to
Fedora", this can be changed to whatever you like, you will have to
make changes to /etc/rc.sysinit, find the following section in that
file :

# Print a text banner.
echo -en $"\t\tWelcome to "
read -r redhat_release < /etc/redhat-release
if [[ "$redhat_release" =~ "Red Hat" ]]; then
 [ "$BOOTUP" = "color" ] && echo -en "\\033[0;31m"
 echo -en "Red Hat"
 [ "$BOOTUP" = "color" ] && echo -en "\\033[0;39m"
 PRODUCT=`sed "s/Red Hat \(.*\) release.*/\1/" /etc/redhat-release`
 echo " $PRODUCT"
elif [[ "$redhat_release" =~ "Fedora" ]]; then
 [ "$BOOTUP" = "color" ] && echo -en "\\033[0;34m"
 echo -en "Fedora"
 [ "$BOOTUP" = "color" ] && echo -en "\\033[0;39m"
 PRODUCT=`sed "s/Fedora \(.*\) \?release.*/\1/" /etc/redhat-release`
 echo " $PRODUCT"
else
 PRODUCT=`sed "s/ release.*//g" /etc/redhat-release`
 echo "$PRODUCT"
fi
if [ "$PROMPT" != "no" ]; then
 echo -en $"\t\tPress 'I' to enter interactive startup."
 echo
fi


now comment out the whole section and add an echo statement just below
it to print your own message, something like this :

#printing my own message
echo -en $"\n"
[ "$BOOTUP" = "color" ] && echo -en "\\033[0;34m"
echo -en $"Welcome to Satish's Linux Box"
[ "$BOOTUP" = "color" ] && echo -en "\\033[0;39m"

check out  how the change looks here : http://satish.playdrupal.com/?q=node/84
(thats a screenshot while my system was booting on qemu)


Thanks
Satish

Thank you for the response.

My DSL modem is set to PPPoE.  So, adjusting parameters on my desktop 
will not affect the DSL connection.  I need to reduce the MRU on the modem.

Subject: [Ilugc] Hibernate don't shutdown (Was Re: system bootup time)
Message-ID: <20090127154927.GA10050@imsc.res.in>

People have been talking about speeding up boot times.

Here is an alternative strategy to make your desktop/laptop quickly
usable whenever you need it.

 Do not *ever* shutdown unless you are upgrading the kernel or grub.

With suspend-to-disk[*] working on most systems around, there is no
reason to ever shutdown. Even library upgrades can be done by
"kill -HUP"ping or "restart"ing some daemons/processes.

Replace your shutdown command with a hibernate/s2disk/tuxonice. You
can power-down your system after such a procedure.

In my experience hibernate and resume times for a typical desktop are
lower than bootup times.

As long as you do not access your hibernated disk areas, you can even
use a different O/S in the intervening period.

You can also build a tremendous "uptime" record in spite of Chennai's
power cuts.

Kapil.
[*] Not to be confused with suspend-to-ram which is mostly only for
laptops and even there is perhaps invoked only after some
superstitious invocations.

to power supply most of the time) with no problems whatsoever, ever
since kernel 2.6.27. It's much, much quicker than suspend to disk,
though it does draw a tiny bit of battery if you don't connect the
power supply.

Sorry for the top post.


I suspended to RAM my thinkpad for a year - even when I carried it
around in the laptop bag.  After 1 year, the battery life dropped to
just 2009 mins.

I had the same experience on a dell earlier.

I'm currently hibernating andd powering off and there are no problems.

Imo, suspend to RAM is not worth it in the long run.

Typo sorry.  That was 20 mins, not 2009 mins.

Not to mention the added advantage of saving all your application
state as well.  You come back to the same firefox tabs, etc.  Makes it
easier to pick up your workflow where you left off.


+1 for hibernating.

I don't know if this might be it, but my previous Compaq NX 7300 would
heat up considerably if I suspended it and placed it in a case. I can
certainly understand if that heating caused some loss of capacity.

Friends.

We have 3 ubuntu 8.04 boxes and no internet connection.

But we have the 5 ubuntu repository DVDs got from zyxware.com

We need to setup one box as a local repository so that all ubuntu boxes
should contact the repository box to get the packages.

Could not get a proper link in net.

Have you done like this before?

Could you share the links and tutorials?

Thanks.

One way (which is specific to Debian derivatives) is to use some apt
caching software --- "approx" is what I use but there are a few
others.

All the clients then point to this as their "apt repository". 

/etc/apt/sources.list:
deb http://your.approx.host:9999/debian/ lenny main contrib non-free
deb http://your.approx.host:9999/security lenny/updates main contrib non-free

The "approx" server is setup to download from the upstream
repositories. For example,

/etc/approx/approx.conf:
debian		http://http.us.debian.org/debian
security	http://security.debian.org/debian-security

You could add backports and other repositories as the need arises.

The approx server should have enough space in /var/cache/approx to
cache the requests of all clients. It should also have "cron" running
so that "gc_approx" can run and clean up the old packages.

"approx" can also make use of an http proxy if that is required.

Regards,

Kapil.

I missed this part of your mail. You should use "apt-move" to first
move all the files into a "distribution pool" which can be used by the
apt caching software.

you can download the new version from sun site and run the executable. that
will update the existing jdk version. or you can have any jdk version
extracted, just change the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the
necessary jdk folder.

Have you setup transparent proxy? If so then https won't work with it.
If not, then squid logs will be needed to assess the problem.

It's not advisable to pass username/passwords in the command
line for any application.  Anyone running "ps" can see the entire
command line and thus know your password.

Instead set the username/password in your http_proxy, ftp_proxy
environment variables themselves like this:

export http_proxy="http://username:password@hostname:port"
export ftp_proxy="http://username:password@hostname:port"

Don't type the above in your bash prompt, put it in a shell
script or your .bash_profile and set appropriate file permissions.

Hi All,

You may be aware that the AussieChix conduct a miniconf which is open
to women of all categories (read, nerdy and non-nerdy too) and is
usually a day long event at linux.conf.au. This year its being held on
19jan09.  SCALE is a similar event focussed on women in the
technology.

http://conf.au.linuxchix.org/
http://scale7x.socallinuxexpo.org/conference-info/women-in-open-source-call-for-papers

Any thoughts on LCIN emulating the same at gnunify.in and freed.in ?
Since its an experiment, it could be limited to a half day event. Here
are some links for the Aussiechix event :

For debugging lot of tools like gbd,.. are available. If you mean
reverse engg, no of tools like strace, lsof,.., are available.

In general, it is very difficult pin point one as reverse engg tool,
you have to select the suitable one, based on your need, experience.

No idea. If you know Assembly language it would be better. At least you
should know some registers' functionality and Data Structures like Stack and
Queue. In Reverse Engineering you will have to handle with Break Points.
Look at the link below. But don't try this for malicious intent. There is
some basic understanding about ASM.

Friends.

I heard that we can edit the existing PDF files using OpenOffice 3.0

But, when we open a PDF file in OpenOffice writer,
it just gives junk characters.

How to retain the format of PDF files?

Hi,

> import the pdf file in OO Draw

I tried way.

1. open OO Draw
2. File -> Open
3. Select the PDF file
4. It asked for ASCII Filter Options. I just give OK
5. Now OO Writer opens up with junk characters.

The original PDF file is 1 page. but the resulting OO writer has 235 pages.
Only junk characters.
No formatting.

What mistake that  I am doing to import?

Thanks.

HI Friends,
                 If You go to see any Tamil news paper site in Ubuntu.You
may face font problem. Here i give small suggestion for this problem.Just go
and download font from Tamil news paper site(Whatever Tamil News
Site).create one folder in your home folder like* .fonts(dot fonts, this is
hidden folder*).Put that font into this folder.If this folder does not
exist,you will create it.I think,This is best way.*Restart Firefox* Don't
Forget it.
                  Try this link also
http://padma.mozdev.org/installation.html
                  Just Install This Add-on In your firefox.It supports tamil
font.

This is meant to give the user a facility to fill up a form available
as text/table in a PDF file (not a PDF Form). Trust you are not
looking at editing it in OODraw. OODraw creates it as a non-editable
layer to form as a backdrop to fill in text - at least the last I used
it. GIMP also can do this. Each page will be a separate image.

gdb's reversible debugging feature is put as a high priority project. But it

appears to be dead. The page(http://sourceware.org/gdb/news/reversible.html)
was last edited in 2007. The most recent patches are from 2006.

btw. Reversible Debugging != reverse engineering. It is stepping backwards
through a program. It is supposedly hard to implement.

Hi there,

If you are not particular on using OpenOffice, you can try 'pdfedit' available on sourceforge. It works pretty well for me barring an occasional crash while handling large documents - no data loss ever though.


If you are specifically interested in OO 3.0, ignore this.

Thanks,

It will be easier if he were to seek answers to specific queries.
General "educate me" kind off queries leaves us nowhere.

Thanks Gowthaman and all.

>> do you have PDF import extension?

I installed PDF import extension from
http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/pdfimport

It really rocks.

OO Draw opens the PDF file well for editing.

Thanks.

Yes you are right ! We can create as well edit pdfs in Open Office 3.0 . For editing Pdfs you need to install a plugin named " Pdfimport " .

Subject: [Ilugc] [Commercial] Call for Papers -- OSI Tech Days
Message-ID: <200901301906.42271.lfyedit2@efyindia.com>

Dear all,

This is a formal call for papers. The Open Source India Tech Days (formerly 
LinuxAsia) [www.osidays.com] is scheduled for March 12-14, 2009, at the 
Chennai Trade Centre, Chennai. The 2009 edition will have a strong flavour of 
technology in it?thus the addition of the word "Tech Days". The target 
audience of OSI Tech Days ?09 will be (1) IT Managers and (2) Software 
Developers, who in turn will represent the needs of India?s varied industry 
segments. Following are the track details for the event:

Software Developers? Track
12th March: FOSS-enabled software development
13th March: FOSS-powered Mobile phones (and devices)

IT Managers? Track
12th March: FOSS Tools for IT Managers
13th March: Virtualization and Cloud Computing

Everyone/Desktop
14th March: FOSS-powered desktop (KDE, GNOME, OpenOffice.org, Mozilla, etc.)

Additional note: Considering the world-wide recession, the idea is to turn 
this into an opportunity (for good) for large-scale FOSS adoption around the 
region. Thus, the idea behind Tech Days is to demonstrate to the mass how with 
FOSS we can make computing better, faster and cheaper, whether it's deployment 
or development.

We're looking for experts in their particular domain of work, who could be 
working for an organisation, or as an individual. You can ping us off-list 
with the following details at lfyedit [AT] efyindia [DOT] com:

[1] Which particular track and the target audience of the talk.
[2] Title of the talk, with a brief outline.
[3] A little bit of background information about yourself.
[4] Whether you've ever spoken earlier.
[5] Whether you'd require travel, logistics, or any other facilities. 

With best regards,
Atanu Datta
Editorial Coordinator, 
LINUX For You magazine

Subject: [Ilugc] Recording a sermon translation.
Message-ID: <e6f500640901300721q78f16f8ak9bbab89b5567e1fe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi luggies,

I have several English sermons in MP3 format; each one approximately 3 hours
long. I need to append Telugu translation at the end of each English
sentence for all of the sermons. This is the best solution I could think of:


1. Play the sermon with *Audacity*.
2. Pause it at the end of a sentence.
3. Record my voice (Telugu translation of that sentence) into *Audacity*, at
that point.
4. Continue to play the English sermon till the end of the next sentence.
5. If not the end of the sermon, go back to step 3

Please suggest better alternatives.

Thank you.

Dear members of ilguc,

Two days back, Mr. Raman.P and myself had a meeting with the FossConf-2009
organising committee in Madurai@TEC. I am surprised when i interact with
them personelly, they are highly motivated, the sprit (Fire) of FOSS among
them is sky high. I have no idea about TEC, before i met these people, but
now i feel that Mr. Raman and the other members of ILUGC made a good choice.


Especially I like to mention here, about their HOD Mrs Shalini and other
members (students) of the organising committee who have alerady started to
spend their late evenings in the preparation of the FossConf-2009. My wishes
to the team.

Last but not the least, i request  all of  our  friends from iLUGC and
NRCFOSS to suport the FossConf-2009 organising committee and to help in all
the aspects to make this event, an huge success.


cheers
Ravi Jaya

they have long ago written an excellent software for management of a college - 
it is free software and we must propagate it with college managements.

you can set the permission with the 'chmod' command and ownerships with
'chown' command.

First give the owner ship of the mount point,

# chown [users]
# chmod 775

you can give all the permission to every one with the notation 777.

and add  a line in /etc/fstab and in /etc/mtab to make it auto mount,

with fstab, it'll auto mount any disk stated in /etc/fstab file, with mtab,
it'll mount the disk is inserted.

/dev/sda1 /media/usbdisk ext3 rw, (state the options you want).

here make sure, your mount point is /media/usbdisk or what ever the name you
give in the /media/[directory]

ATB,

Use svn copy (http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/re07.html) or svnadmin
hotcopy (http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/re33.html) - the latter for
copying the whole repository if needed.

And if I may suggest, please use google to try to find an answer before
sending a mail on the list. The first google result for 'svn copy' gives the
answer. And the svnbook(http://svnbook.red-bean.com/) has extensive
easy-to-understand documentation.

Well, if you need a per sentence translation, I don't think there is any
better way than you are doing, unless there is a software which can take a
3hr sermon and split it up into sentence length bits - and I haven't heard
of any such.

Dear luggies,

On behalf of ILUGC RaviJaya and myself did a two day workshop in  Velammal College of Engg and Tech at Madurai. The event was organised by the MCA dept with support from NRCFOSS.

We cover philosophy,installation, basics of gui, programming using scripting languages.

About 100 students attended out of which about 30 are from nearby colleges.

The response was very good and I am extremely satisfied with there interest..

In one of very few colleges (in my experience) where faculty was totally involved. Indeed they sat through the entire session and beyond to ensure that installation is done in the lab. The college is fortunate to have such faculty.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank the management, faculty and students for the opportunity. My special thanks and appreciation goes the Lecturers Ms.Kavitha and Ms.Avanija for their involvement.

I thank NRCFOSS for taking lead in organising this.
