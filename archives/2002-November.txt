Hi

A few issues:

1. to run a script in language lng, say script.lng,
you have to type at the prompt

$ script.lng

2. The above assumes that the script is in the current directory and
that the current directory is in the PATH. It is better to say

$ ./script.lng

3. test is a shell built-in; so typing 

$ test 
will run that ALWAYS. 

HTH

P Asokan

PS: It <is> a bad idea to have the current directory in PATH

C was designed by Dennis Ritchie on the assumption
that programmers were like Dennis Ritchie.
Java appears to have been designed on the theory
that programmers are more like Dennis the Menace.

Hi there,

  I would like to connect all 50 systems into single

  local networks.  All I want to know is which
  [ Network Device (eg) Hub, Switch etc.,] one will
  be the best to go to connect them into one
  network where there will not be any collission.

  One of my friend suggested to go for 24 bit 
  dataswitch which has 100mbps capacity.  I don't
  know exactly how far that is going to give the 
  solution for me.
  
  Because already i am using 1 data switch with
  8 port data switch which divides through hub(s)
  for all the 50 computers. 
 
  If anything that gives finite solution kindly do 
  let me know.  Your suggestions are almost welcome.

  Thanks in Advance.

The optimum solution would be stackable switches cascaded thro' a backplane
or high speed backbone. This is available from many brands. Stackable
switches are more expensive than plain packages switches as normally they
are also SNMP capable. The other option is to take 4 x 16 port packaged
unmanaged switches and cascade the thro' normal ports. In this switching
within a switch will be at full speed but switches across switches will be
constrained by the switching request loads across switches will is capped at
100.

Hi all,
Im finding sooo difficult to get out the installation and X configuration 
with RH8 on Intel 845GX.  The Xconfigurator is not there in RH8.  Even the 
worse is, at the time of installation, the RH installer takes the 815 
chipset driver and works fine.  But when I try to configure, I couldn't..

Can any body helpme out from this struck?

In my humble opinion enabling telnet might not be a right option, your box becomes vulnerable. 

Go for ssh.

#sshd start
starts ssh daemon ( must be root to do the same)

#telnetd start
starts telnet daemon ( must be root again )

use
#mmc
brings you the Mandrake Control Center in console if you do not have gui up, else brings a neat gui. That should help you in enabling sshd at startup.

You might want to tweak your startup script too :-)

hope that helps

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] Professional tutor/teacher for GNU/Linux?
Message-ID: <15812.57328.872856.278957@monster.linux.in>

hi,

An elderly relative of mine is looking for professional help with
installing and using GNU/Linux at home.  I do not have the time to
take up the responsibility.  I did install Mandrake Linux a long while
ago on his machine but do not have the time to teach him how to use
it.  I'd like to know if there is anyone in Chennai who would be
willing to teach/tutor him commercially at his residence?  If someone
is interested or if you know of an organization/person who might be
interested please mail me *off the list* for details.

Thanks.

Depends on the rest of your setup - but I got rh 8 up and running on an

Of course, Mandrake 9 did a far better job setting things up :)

---------- Forwarded message ----------
dear all,

BusinessWorld magazine India, just gave me my life's greatest Diwali gift:

a cover story, with an expressive, black-suit and bowtie clad billgates, 
eyeing an aggressive-looking Tux, with the headline:

"BILL to bill:
Why India is a Critical Battleground in the War
between Microsoft and Linux."

good amount of research done by Charles Assisi and Shelley Singh. though i 
wish the article could have been far more comprehensive, with more box 
stories, larger editorial coverage, etc.

the story does mention indian localizing efforts, and several india-centric 
initiatives.

i dunno about you guyz, but am going out to buy about a dozen copies of the 
Rs 5 per copy mag, and am gonna hand-deliver to key personnel in my key 
contact lists.

happy diwali to all.

May the Linux Lamp of Freedom
Burn Brightly in Your Lives This Year,
Bringing you Prosperity, Wealth,
and Lots of Happiness.

LL

Here is my 2 cents worth of unsolicited "advice": 

It does not matter how the web mastering works internally, but it
would be nice if we could:

1. Create one alias to which inquiries/suggestions/criticisms/etc. can
   be addressed to and all webmasters's addresses can be added to it.

2. ensure that this team will keep the ilugc community up2date on the
   current active strength so that new volunteers can quickly replace
   people who will invariably get busy with time.  What we would
   especially like to avoid is a team of webmasters who all get busy
   and each one thinks there are others who will attend to the tasks.

In my humble opinion enabling telnet might not be a right option, your box becomes vulnerable. 

Go for ssh.

#sshd start
starts ssh daemon ( must be root to do the same)

#telnetd start
starts telnet daemon ( must be root again )

use
#mmc
brings you the Mandrake Control Center in console if you do not have gui up, else brings a neat gui. That should help you in enabling sshd at startup.

You might want to tweak your startup script too :-)

hope that helps

peace

Not really, you can get switches with 10/100/1000 (Cisco 2950 has 24 100mbit 
and 2 gbit ports). So you can carry the load of all the other ports over 
these two...

Which distro are you using?

I've installed it on RH and mandrake, and installation is usually painless. 
Install the postgres* rpms (urpmi is usually the best method). You will have 
be sure to install both the client and the server packages, plus any other 
langage binding modules or whatever (perl-dbi for example)

There are complete docs in the HOWTO's please read them, it is quite 
straightforward.

did you install them ?

have a look at the following url on how to install them or check whether you have installed them.

http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/demos/temp/tutorial/SoftwareMgr/

if not installed - install them.

furtherly read 

http://runslinux.net/tech/ssh/node16.html

as i suggested earlier, avoid telnetd :-)

how did you try to check whether apache was installed .. ?

try typing rpm -q apache this gives the version of apache which is alredy installed.

On a *nix system, Apache typically runs as a standalone daemon, named httpd.

Message-ID: <002d01c28551$de096cc0$739409ca@sriguhan>

Hi,
     I'm using redhat 7.3. I use my own custom kernel. Is there a way  to
display Linux logo TUX on boot. The vesa fb console driver  doesn't seem to
support i810 and the 16 color vga display driver doesn't display the logo
correctly ie. the logo is corrupted when i use the vga16 driver for the
console. Please help. Also is there a  way to setup X on two virtual
terminals with i810. I tried /usr/X11R6/bin/X vt8 but it didn't work. It
showed some AGPGART allocation error. My kernel version is 2.4.18 and X is
4.2.

Yours Sincerely,
     Sri

Hi

 "setup X on two virtual terminals " by this do you mean running two X sessions one on vt7 and on vt8 ?
if yes then that can be done using 

#startx -- :n
where n is the next free display for example
if u have one display in :0 then n is 1
its usually $DISPLAY+1,u can have as many X sessions.

Happy Hacking!

	You can also use vtxx to choose the virtual terminal,
where xx is the vt number. I generally use vt13 (since it is
not accessible by CTRL-ALT-[F1-F12]), and display 10 (a random
number, so that other users can run X without disturbing mine;).

You can use the AltR-Left, and AltR-Right combinations to cycle 
through the vts in use. 

Use CTRL-ALT-[F1-F6] to get back to a tty from X.

Why do u use vesafb? You should be using i810fb. I use it for testing 
DirectFB code and it works well. 

Checkout http://i810fb.sourceforge.net

Subject: [Ilugc] LINK: Taking the FLOSS debate into the 'development' campaign...
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0211081218260.699-100000@news.goa.bytesforall.org>

Just to share with you: I've come across this fascinating presentation by an
EU official in Vietnam, who argues that 'development' organisation in the
First World should throw their weight behind Free/Libre and Open Source
Software. 

This is a fascinating set of arguments. So far, few in the 'development/NGO
network' (apart from rare exceptions like Sunil Abraham of Mahiti.org in
Bangalore and the Sarai network in Delhi, and the Dehradun-based
publishers of 'Software Freedom') have appreciate the power of, or worked
seriously on, FLOSS. 

[Disclosure of interest: I have received a print-media fellowship from
Sarai in the past year.]

Interestingly, this document is released under the terms and conditions of
the GNU Free Documentation License. Surely a worthy read. I would
encourage everyone interested in taking this debate forward to please
persue it.

If you would like a copy, just send mail to fred@bytesforall.org with the
subjectline FLOSS-PRESENTATION. Thank you. FN

PS: My apologies for reducing very interesting arguments to a few bytes of
poorly-represented text. My limited abilities did not allow me to convert
the speaker notes, words he used and graphics into extracts in text
suitably. The presentation does a better job of that.

Developing countries can neither miss the benefits of the IT revolution, nor
afford its cost (IPRs in particular)

Donors and multilaterals have a responsibility to provide an alternative, if
available

FLOSS is today the only alternative available 

PROPOSAL

ODA-FLOSS will be implemented. Why? 

The question is: Who will be the first to do it?

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

IT is today's Industrial Revolution
Ability to leapfrog into latest technology
Complement Industrial Development

"Cost Windows XP + MS Office: Standard Version $560. Professional Version

$440/year) XP+Office = 1 Year 3 months. XP+Office (Pro) = 1 Year 10 months. 
a) COST (III) Cost-Equivalent for the US (GDP per capita $30,200/Year).

"Like science, FLOSS builds as a community, on top of past work."

"No backdoors + No spyware."

"All software (on a sponsored distro) must be Free/Libre as defined by the
Free Software Foundation.... All applications must be fully localised and
documented... Include Open Office. Why? ... The first version must be
Windows-based. Why?"

"Pareto's 80/20 Rule applied to software -- (20% of applications solve 80%
of needs). Substitutes a key application. Example for users that Open Source
works. Other candidates: Mozilla, MySQL, Gimp, ... (suggestions welcome) Why
a Windows FLOSS CD-ROM? MS Windows is the way towards a full FLOSS system
(for private users).... Microsoft Windows runs on 94% of desktops. Private
users cannot be forced into FLOSS. We must earn their trust in FLOSS."


"Cost of a FLOSS CD-Rom: (quotation: www.goldenrom.com).  10.000 Copies -

$135,000 1,000,000 Copies - $250,000. Cost of ODA-FLOSS CD-Rom for
one-fourth of 'pirate' computers."

"Recycling legislation: Cheaper shipping PCs to developing countries than
recycling them (also tax deductible). Donated PCs tend to be stripped of
parts, software or licenses, using a FLOSS OS is an obvious choice."

1) ftp. telnet etc are spawned by a super server called xinetd. Check
/etc/xinetd.d/ftp file. If disable is set to yes, you would get this. If
disable is set to no and you still get connection refused, check hosts.allow
and hosts.deny.
2) Writing a script is the best option. Another option is to use xargs - You
could put all the user names in a file and give

nis enabled useradd instead of normal useradd and at the end publish the
changes to all nis clients. S3 Prosavage is available on 7.3. Why not
upgrade to stock 7.3? I have also found that the PCQuest versions are slower
to boot than standard stock RH Linux - do not know why.

  Dear friends,
  1)I have installed PC quest RH 7.1,by default ftp and telnet access is not
enabled.ftp or telnet access gives a reply "connection refused".I could't
figure out anything from /etc/ftpaccess file.How to enable this?
  2)How to create large number of Linux users in a networked
environment?What are the options?
  3)I am using several m/c with AMD duron and Gigabyte mother board GA 7VKML
using chip set VIA KM 266.The graphics adapter is S3 prosavage.I searched
extensivly and could not find any driver for the same also there was no
response from the user groups.
  VIA does not provide support for KM 266 on Linux.I have decided to
compromise with at least some GUI using generic VGA ,but even configuring
this is testing my endurence using Xconfigurator or xfconfig.
  While installing RH 7.1 pc quest using graphical interface,we get a screen
configured for generic VGA card.At least this seems to be okay.How to copy
or get this xconfig file for latter use ?
  Thanks,
  solai

Hello,

The kernel has plenty of asm code. Look  at the nasm site if you want info. 
Intel has a Graphics driver development division in Bangalorem and Intel is 
usually friendly to developers, so try asking them. Intel will be able to 
help you with both x86 as well as graphics driver stuff...

The linux kernel need not be recomppiled on each and every machine where
it is to run. You can compile on one machine and then transfer the
kernel (and its associated modules) to the target machine and update
your bootloader.

Alternatively you can try passing the mem=XXX option to the linux
kernel for a no-recompile solution

Hi,
does anyone have rh 8 cds with them? I had come to the
meeting on the weekend, but we did not have cd writer.
I found a place where I could burn the cds. Or if you
have additional copies of rh8, I could give u blank
Imation 700 MB cd-rs instead of them.

Thx,
Sanjay

and, those who want redaht8 or mandrake9, can continue for some more

I shall mail  you a set of these  RHL 8.0 CDs if you just  mail me the
cost of 3 blank CDs plus postage for Speed-posting the CDs to you.

Can you please  give me your postal address ?  I  shall Speed Post the
CDs now itself, so that by tomorrow morning you will have Redhat CDs.

* You cannot telnet as user root.

Could you able to do telnet and ftp locally, i.e 'telnet/ftp localhost' from
your telnet/ftp server.

For telnet if you could then it may be problem with your firewall.

For ftp i am not used to wu-ftpd,i am using vsftpd, so i think others may
help you. Probably you should check out the configuration file. For vsftpd
i had to configure lot of things.

And w.r.t the no3 and no4 thing, both are same as init.d is a link to
rc.d/init.d.

Just check out 'ls -l /etc/init.d'.

bye.

  have u enabled firewall on your installation?, check
 lsmod | grep iptables
if it is loaded there is a chance that it might block u. do a
rmmod iptables
and try (but this makes ur system without firewall - be careful)

 for wu-ftpd this might help u try
cd /usr/sbin
./wu-ftpd -s

 make sure that ipchains or iptables is not running in your box
 you can stop them by the following command
 service ipchains stop
 service iptabless stop
 which will stop temporarily (till the next reboot)
to stop them permanently in runlevels 2345 
root# chkconfig --level 2345 ipchains off
root# chkconfig --level 2345 iptables off
 
what is the differenc between no3 and no4 xinetd )

 /etc/init.d is a symlink to /etc/rc.d/init.d

Subject: [Ilugc] LB2002-BANGALORE: Conference delegate registration begins...
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0211120030280.2720-100000@news.goa.bytesforall.org>

URL             :  http://linux-bangalore.org/2002/participate/delegates/

Conference Delegate Registration System

   Please read this before continuing with the registration.
   
Introduction

   Last year, we had an issue with more people at the venue than
   actuallyattending the talks. This caused a lot of inconvenience to
   people, becausethey had to stand in long queues, and our poor BLUG
   volunteers were tearingtheir hair out.
   
   Many people who stood in the queues actually did so because the event
   was free, and because registration would give them "attendance" in
   colleges and at work. While we are proud that principals and employers
   considered the event worthy of such recognition, we were quite upset
   about how it was misused by some people, and of course the
   inconvenience caused.
   
   Another problem was that of the people who registered online, very few
   people came with their registration codes/cards, causing our
   volunteers to have to re-enter everything.
   
   So, after a lot of deliberation, we have decided on the following
   system to ensure that only people actually interested in the event
   show up.
   
Registration Charge

    1. We are going to charge a gate fee of Rs.300 per head for people
       who have pre-registered online and bring their correct
       registration code (i.e. the printout of the registration card that
       you get to see when you register online).
    2. We are going to charge a gate fee of Rs.500 for people who show up
       to register, but have not registered online or who do not have a
       valid registration code with them.
       
   The money we collect is *not* for our coffers, or even for the event.
   Instead, every delegate will receive a Conference T-Shirt (valued
   atRs.150) and food coupons for all three days (valued at Rs.150).This
   is, of course, in addition to any handouts that our sponsors give us
   toinclude in delegate kits.
   
   What this means is that while delegates have to pay Rs.300 to attend
   the event (Rs.500 for those lazy guys who make us work extra hard),
   they will receive at least Rs.300 worth stuff in return - thereby
   rendering the actual cost of attending the event to zero.
   
What does this mean?

    1. You *will* have to spend some money to attend the event. The
       amount is low enough to be attractive to even the poorest student
       - with 70 talks, an exhibition and tons of other stuff, plus the
       food coupons and T-Shirt, this is a total steal.
    2. If you are in it for the attendance only, and wish to sneak off
       even after paying - well, you are the proud owner of a t-shirt and
       food coupons that you cannot use anywhere but at the event.
    3. If you are really not interested and don't want to spend money,
       then you don't have to.
       
   While we recognise that some people are likely to complain about not
   getting in for free, we have to look at the greater good.
   
Please note:

    1. The people who don't register online also affect our estimates on
       how many T-shirts are required. On the other hand, so do people
       who register but don't show up.
    2. The food coupons are not encashable, nor is any other part of the
       package (i.e. the T-Shirt). You pay, you get, you use. No
       discounts because "I don't need the T-Shirt" or "I am on a diet".
    3. Food is veggie only, and fixed menu. We eat our own dogfood -
       complaints about food quality (if any) should take into account
       that the managers will eat the same stuff you will.
    4. Extra T-Shirts will not be available. However, if you anticipate
       the need for extra T-shirts, register twice, pay twice, and Bob's
       your uncle. ;-)
       
About the T-Shirts:

   The T-Shirts will have the conference Logo on the left breast, and the
   Conference name on the back, with the Platinum sponsor's logo on the
   sleeves.
   
   We cannot guarantee T-shirts to people who don't pre-register.
   Quantities (with reasonable margins) will be based on the number of
   pre-registrations via the CDRS.
   
   Even if enough T-shirts are available, we cannot guarantee sizes for
   people who do not pre-register.
   
   (In fact, we do not guarantee anything except that a good time will be
   had by all.)
   
About the registration cards:

   When you register, you will receive a conference deletgate pass which
   you *MUST* display whenever you enter the premises or any area within
   the premises (such as an auditorium). It is common for people to have
   the pass on the first day and forget it at home (or lend it to a
   cheapskate friend) on the second and third day. I am afraid that will
   result in your eviction.
   
   Moral of the story: DON'T LOSE YOUR DELEGATE PASS!
   
   This is especially important on evening of the last day's Mondo Major
   Monster BLUG meet and the "cultural programme" (he he he - maha-evil
   chuckle, accompanied by sinister rubbing of hands, bolts of lightning,
   crash of thunder...), which will take place in an auditorium that can
   accommodate no more than 1000 people who will keep perfectly still and
   seated - a most unlikely scenario given the programme...
   
Seats

   We do not guarantee the availability of seats at talks. First come,
   first served. We will be happy to reserve seats for people who are
   willing to pay the value of the event to them, but then we don't think
   even Bill Gates has that much money ;-)
   
Register

   OK, you may now spend 5 minutes flaming us for "commercialising the
   event", "violating the spirit of Linux" and "being the Microsoft of
   the Linux world" , after which you may click on the link below to
   register as a delegate for the event. ;-)
   
   Please note that you don't have to pay to register - you only have to
   pay when you actually show up at the event.
   
                              [15][Register]

Gates threatening spirit of freedom: free software guru

>From Indo-Asian News Service

New Delhi, Nov 12 (IANS) Microsoft chairman Bill Gates threatens the spirit
of freedom, the founder of the free software movement said here even as the
world's richest man began a tour of India.

Richard Stallman said in the Indian capital Monday evening that Microsoft
and Gates -- who arrived here on a four-day visit the same day -- were
perpetuating systems that threaten the freedom of computer users.

Stallman was in the city to release his book "No Sir, No Monopoly! Free
Software - A Perspective".

Published by Prajashakti publishers, the book was released by B.K. Kcayla,
convenor of the national working group on patent laws.

Stallman, who has emerged as a symbol against everything that Bill Gates has
stood for, is also the founder of the GNU software project out of which has
emerged the Linux operating system -- available free or in low-cost software
packages.

Clad informally, Stallman seemed every inch the man he is reputed to be.
After walking to the podium sans his shoes, Stallman said: "This is a
struggle for freedom and independence. Non-free software, like the ones sold
by Microsoft, divides people.

"It is like not being allowed to share your favourite cooking recipes with
your friends. One cannot exchange recipes, one cannot change the cooking nor
does one know anything about the ingredients - that is the world of non-free
software, developed by Microsoft.

"It doesn't allow any software to be shared and one has to pay for running
these programmes. In India, it would cost an enormous amount and a big drain
on resources.

"Non-free software violates the spirit of goodwill that is so important for
human society and civilization. It is akin to the exploitative colonial
system.

"When Bill Gates donates computer systems to schools, it is like gifting
cigarettes. It is initially free but when you get hooked you have to pay for
it. Non-free software programmes are like that. It will be available free of
cost but for a couple of years only."

Gates is pledging a large donation to health projects in India through his
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Said Stallman: "Gates is donating a small
fraction of what he has squeezed out of computer users."

"What India should do is to resist against non-free software collectively.
The good effects of globalisation can come about only through the use of
non-free software," Stallman argued.

In India, Linux is used by less than 10 percent of the country's personal
computers and server computers.

India has an estimated half-million individual software developers. There
are an estimated four million PCs in use in India among the nation's billion
people.

Subject: [india-gii] Sneak Preview of Business Today Column on Gates' visit

Since we are on the topic, and at least some of us seem to be thinking
alike, here is the column that should appear in Business Today next
Monday:
-----
Don't Bill the Gates.

Let's take the billionaire's healthcare handouts, and turn down the
software handcuffs.


By the time this article comes out, the world's richest man would have
been here and gone. From what I hear around me, our state governments
are in a tizzy, competing to outdo each other to dazzle the gent. All in
a hope to get some of his cash into their state.

Nothing wrong with any of this. But let's look a little closer at why
the Chief Software Architect is taking 4 days out of that hyper-valuable
time to hobnob with our CMs and CEOs. He's not really here because we
need his money. He's here because he needs ours.

Think about it - Microsoft has seen off legal challenges to its Windows
monopoly. But never before has it seen such a strong marketplace
challenge - in the form of the open source operating system called
Linux.

Linux is all the things a developing economy like India needs - open,
well-documented, stable, secure, accepted worldwide - and, best of all,
virtually free. Governments around the world, from Peru to the United
Kingdom have begun insisting on open source to power their national
initiatives.

India is not far behind - Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka were
among the first to direct atleast some of their IT buyers to first look
at open source for solutions, and only later, at proprietary systems
like Microsoft before placing orders.

This worries the famously paranoid Redmonders. Small wonder that the CMs
of these very states are on Bill's list of people to schmooze on this
trip. "Hey buddy, I'll come and throw a few scraps your way from my
private jet - but, pal, you gotta buy Microsoft."

Governments and their directives are not Bill's only worries. India
isn't that large a market for software - we barely account for 1% of
Microsoft's sales. But the fact is that we are home to 10% of the
world's software developers - and Billy boy just doesn't want Coder
Coomaraswamy to go over to the Linux side of the development fence.

Corporations around the world want lower cost, more supportable and
stable solutions. And the nightmare of India becoming one of the world's
strong Linux-based development centers has ensured that our Ambanis,
Tatas and Narayanamurthy's get treatment on par with our Chief
Ministers. The message again: "Stay with Microsoft and we can beat off
those Open-source Outlaws and bring the world back to a place where a
monopolist can still make a decent living."

The trip is done and over with now - and hopefully some of the glamour
and space-cadet glow would have faded from those who wanted to be
photographed with His Billness. Time for a reality check.

For buyers, it's time to consider how the very nature of software is
changing. From a point where the internet offered the ultimate open,
extensible infrastructure we now have offerings like Microsoft's
Palladium which, in the supposed name of security, takes the free, open
nature of TCP/IP: the platform under the internet, and adds proprietary
bits that will ensure that Microsoft controls and gets paid virtually
every time you go out of the gate onto the net.

You will also see new Microsoft licensing models that force you to pay
subscriptions from now till forever for whatever you use. You don't have
to accept it if you don't want to. There are alternatives.

Further, you will hear standard Microsoft FUD, as they call it
themselves (rumours that add to Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) that Linux
is more expensive than Windows to implement. This is Redmond's new
global anti-Linux positioning - once they realized their earlier "Linux
is un-American and un-capitalistic" line actually ended up making it
more popular. Don't take anybody's word for it. Do your own study,
arrive at your own conclusions. More FUD is expected that Linux is
insecure - but this coming from notoriously bug-infested Microsoft is
like Saddam suddenly evangelizing humane democracy.

If you're a developer, keep an equally open mind. There are advantages
to being part of the Microsoft camp, especially if you want framed
photographs you can show your grandchildren - or your customers live
under a rock and will buy MS, no questions asked. For others, there is a
global market for Linux-based solutions that is rapidly developing. You
will have to re-adjust your thinking.

And as far as the Bill and Melinda Foundation to eradicate AIDS? A
wonderful effort by all means. The NGOs among you should strive to seek
connections and funding. And having to write up your reports in Word or
Excel is a small price to pay.

Dishnet USB modems dont normally have linux drivers (the Aztech 100U
etc).  These are normally Globespan USB modems.

However there are third party linux drivers at
http://eciadsl.flashtux.org/index.php?lang=en (get the CVS version)

Hi Gayathri

Commendable. Its nice to see somebody working on a real project for once
!!!
Now, can you elaborate on what features are to be implemented in your mini
project ?

Here is what I make from your mail..


>iam the new user.i am doing my mini project which shud implement the
firewall
>in Linux.Can anyone help me in this regard.it shud be implemented
>in any application.This is the first project iam doing.so pls help me.


1. Firewall Implementation for a college ? - so this is a configuration
project
2. Firewall Implementation as in Developing a new firewall ? -- this is
definitely not a 'mini' -project.


So, I think you must be looking at Option 1 above...


On latest versions of Linux distributions, the firewall used is based on a
command called 'iptables'. It is described very well in documentation from
a guy called Russ Nelson - under the heading Netfilter. You can use any of
the key words iptables, netfilter to search google for more information.


Some Firewall Configuration software is also available which makes
configuration easy. For example: look at a project called Shorewall. Again,
google is your friend. Sorry, my internet connection is too slow now to
search and provide you exact URLs.


BTW: before you implement Firewalls, you need to have some basic
understanding of TCP/IP Networking. A good place to start is the 'TCP/IP
Tutorial RFC' which is again available ..... u guessed it... search on
google !!!


And if you need more documentation - there is the Firewall HOWTO for
Linux.. use google to search  :)


Hope that info was useful...Do let me know the progress of your project.

  In Linux, ipchain(OLD) and iptable(NEW) are used as firewalls. This
  things are free with linux. Lot of docments are avail in NET. If U
  explain more abt ur project in detail, then it is easy for the 
  people, who want to help u.

I need a solution for my problem:
I've installed RHL6.2 on a standard machine and configured as an internal 
mail server. The Networking is OK, but the clients are unable to receive 
the mails from the server. Outgoing from the cleints is working fine and 
they are queued in the server. The client (Eudora and MS outlookExp) shows

Message-ID: <OFB7336DC5.6EA474A4-ON65256C70.0021086C@polaris.co.in>

Hi,

I am a newbie to Linux and have been on and off trying on RH 7.1 in my old
machine since 4 months, yet not confortable. Now, I have assembled a new
machine in lieu of my old machine.

Yesterday, I had successfully installed RH Ver 8.0 in my machine.

My Machine Configuration is as follows:

P4 1.7
Intel D845GLLY Mother Board
with integrated Sound and Video
40 GB HDD
Samtron 56v 15" Monitor
Logitec Optical Mouse...

I have the following problem,

1. X Configurator auto deducted my on-board Video Card by installed the
i810/815 Chipset Video Drivers I think... due to which, the X when started
distorted image appears on the screen.., but I am able to login, after the
resolution is such that the fonts are too big and everything id out of
focus in the monitor.

2. The Sound test was performed after in the final stages of installation,
but the sound did not play on testing the same.

3. I am using a DAX 56k External Modem, which was also not deducted by
Redhat Linux...

Everything is working fine in my Windows 98 SE Boot. The GRUB also got
installed without any problem providing the option of Dual Boot between RH
Ver 8 and my Windows 98SE.

I was completely planning to convert to RH Linux but these problems somehow
keeps me away from getting on to Linux.

I tried the Intel Web Site and Google for help but did not find much help,
Intel site does not have any drivers for the same in their Website.

Any help is highly apperciated. Also, let me know how to install the
drivers and configure the same to work correctly with RH Linux. First hand
experience is an added value to sort out my problem.

Thanks,
Sriram

There was a long post by venu regarding this. I just want to add a few things. I am assuming that you are gonna code in C. If so, man iptables would help you. There exist APIs that will allow the user to set rules for iptables. If i am not wrong, you can do the same using setsockopt(). Check out the man pages for the same.
  Can you throw some light on what do u mean by it shld be implemented in any application .

Using ipchains for internet access requires masquerading. This is not
strictly web proxy as no URL controls are here - simple internal<>external
ip mapping thro' ports on a single ip.

You can use the attached file. The last three lines enable specific IPs for
masq. All other IPs are blocked. Call this from rc.local.

IPChain is OLD. Use IPTables.
  
The following rule is used for IP-Masq

  iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface eth1 --jump ACCEPT
 
  iptables --append FORWARD --match state --state ESTABLISHED,
             RELATED --jump ACCEPT

  iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface eth0 --jump 
             MASQUERADE

  Read docs/man pages related to IPTABLES :) I am not an expert in 
  iptables :)

Bye :)

hey all,

i have been a keen observer of the group and certainly not a contributer by any means.BTW i am doing my 3rd year CS engineering in madras.And i couldn't help but wonder , how you wonderful people will actually start doing something about "selling" linux to people in Tamil Nadu.

Well let me tell you soemthing , MADRAS University is doing its bit.Last sem i had DBMS lab and OS lab ,DBMS was of course on WINDOWs , while in OS lab , we workked the internals of Linux , as far as our teacher could......

This sem ( no. 6 ) , i have System S/W lab and Networking lab , and both are on the Linux platform.So that can't be bad.But still i feel that people in my class are not really into linux as theya re simply not comfortable with it.Only after my course incharge threatened students that they wuld lose marks in their internals that they actually installed linux on their systems.

Also i know for a fact that the college's IT and CSE dept. spends tons of money in buying propeitary S/W simply bcos they are unaware that better alternatives exist.

How can i as a student , help in propagating the holy cause of linux , at a level which is undoubtedly far more powerful than any other.

I am open to your comments and suggetions to help in this crusade to make the world a better place.

regards

aditya krishnan

This is news to me. Though I did not study computer science / IT from
madras univ, I did have the chance to get along with a couple of friends
who did CS/IT in Madras Univ. AFAIK they weren't taught even a trace of
anything UNIX. The irony was that we (electrical engg.,) were taught
UNIX. 

Now that is a significant improvement. If they teach anything UNIX, we
can easily convince them to teach GNU/Linux.

ak> How can i as a student , help in propagating the holy cause of linux , at a level which is undoubtedly far more powerful than any other.

You could join the Demo@Schools project. So far we have conducted a demo
at a school in chromepet. We are also teaching free software to the
students there and we are seeing a great response / enthusiasm from the
student community. We are all gearing up for another demo at Velammal
matric. school, Anna Nagar.

We have ideas of conducting demos at colleges too, but right now we
lack volunteers. You could make this possible by joining us and finding
ways of conducting demos at colleges.

Subject: [Ilugc] Help: Driver for RH Ver 8.0 required...
Message-ID: <FBKJHFJBANJABBAA@mailcity.com>

Hi,

I am a newbie to Linux and have been on and off trying on RH 7.1 in my old machine since 4 months, yet not confortable. Now, I have assembled a new machine in lieu of my old machine.

Yesterday, I had successfully installed RH Ver 8.0 in my machine.

My Machine Configuration is as follows:

P4 1.7
Intel D845GLLY Mother Board
with integrated Sound and Video
40 GB HDD
Samtron 56v 15" Monitor
Logitec Optical Mouse...

I have the following problem,

1. X Configurator auto deducted my on-board Video Card by installed the i810/815 Chipset Video Drivers I think... due to which, the X when started distorted image appears on the screen.., but I am able to login, after the resolution is such that the fonts are too big and everything id out of focus in the monitor.

2. The Sound test was performed after in the final stages of installation, but the sound did not play on testing the same.

3. I am using a DAX 56k External Modem, which was also not deducted by Redhat Linux...

Everything is working fine in my Windows 98 SE Boot. The GRUB also got installed without any problem providing the option of Dual Boot between RH Ver 8 and my Windows 98SE.

I was completely planning to convert to RH Linux but these problems somehow keeps me away from getting on to Linux.

I tried the Intel Web Site and Google for help but did not find much help, Intel site does not have any drivers for the same in their Website.

Any help is highly apperciated. Also, let me know how to install the drivers and configure the same to work correctly with RH Linux. First hand experience is an added value to sort out my problem.

Thanks,
Sriram

There was a long post by venu regarding this. I just want to add a few things. I am assuming that you are gonna code in C. If so, man iptables would help you. There exist APIs that will allow the user to set rules for iptables. If i am not wrong, you can do the same using setsockopt(). Check out the man pages for the same.
Can you throw some light on what do u mean by it shld be implemented in any application .

Rusty Russel is available at http://www.netfilter.org for which he is the
maintainer. Shorewall is available at http://www.shorewall.net with Tom
Eastap as the maintainer. Echowall, Seattlewall, narc, horatio are the
others you can look at. Base RH Linux has a tool called lokkit which uses
ipchains - the earlier firewalling utility. From what I've seen, Shorewall
is the best script generator. The best by-hand scripting I've seen is by
James C. Stephens at www.cs.princeton.edu/~jns/security/iptables/.

In case further help is needed, I'd be glad to help.

Hi Gayathri

Commendable. Its nice to see somebody working on a real project for once
!!!
Now, can you elaborate on what features are to be implemented in your mini
project ?

Here is what I make from your mail..


>iam the new user.i am doing my mini project which shud implement the
firewall
>in Linux.Can anyone help me in this regard.it shud be implemented
>in any application.This is the first project iam doing.so pls help me.


1. Firewall Implementation for a college ? - so this is a configuration
project
2. Firewall Implementation as in Developing a new firewall ? -- this is
definitely not a 'mini' -project.


So, I think you must be looking at Option 1 above...


On latest versions of Linux distributions, the firewall used is based on a
command called 'iptables'. It is described very well in documentation from
a guy called Russ Nelson - under the heading Netfilter. You can use any of
the key words iptables, netfilter to search google for more information.


Some Firewall Configuration software is also available which makes
configuration easy. For example: look at a project called Shorewall. Again,
google is your friend. Sorry, my internet connection is too slow now to
search and provide you exact URLs.


BTW: before you implement Firewalls, you need to have some basic
understanding of TCP/IP Networking. A good place to start is the 'TCP/IP
Tutorial RFC' which is again available ..... u guessed it... search on
google !!!


And if you need more documentation - there is the Firewall HOWTO for
Linux.. use google to search  :)


Hope that info was useful...Do let me know the progress of your project.

quality, promises, being good, well all these depends on your expectations ;-)

NO - you will not get that good support as you might expect ( i didnt get as i expected *grin* )

NO - you cannot expect stability as it is supposed to be.

NO - you will not get the clean throughput of 64kbps ( assuming you are taking a 64 kbps line )

YES - The marketting ppl make a lot of false promises.

YES - you will get a fairly better than ISDN quality at most times, not always though.

now these views and perception might differ :)

So your syllabus has nothing to do with GNU/Linux OR any
particular OS / Software? Is it your college's choice? If it is
your college's choice, its the best thing that can happen. It becomes
easier to convince individual colleges to start using Free Software
(atleast much more better than convincing the University board)

and It seems MCA has some sort of an open syllabus where colleges are
free to pick up the software of their choice. So for networking, they
choose GNU/Linux. For web programming they choose ASP/JSP/etc., This is
from the mouth of an MCA student that I know of. I'm still surprised. Is
this true?

FROM THE REGISTER


By Thomas C Greene in Washington
Posted: 13/11/2002 at 04:22 GMT

We do hate to rain on a high-profile corporate love-fest, but we have to
point out that in addition to the much trumpeted $100 million Billg has
donated to India's fight against HIV, he's funding the Microsoft jihad
against Linux to the far more impressive tune of $421 million.

Billg's personal $100 million goes to health initiatives over ten years,
while $421 million of Microsoft's money goes, over a mere three years,
to support MS-friendly development and 'educational' initiatives. And
being a monster MS shareholder himself, a 'Big Win' in India will enrich
him personally, perhaps well in excess of the $100 million he's donating
to the AIDS problem. Makes you wonder who the real beneficiary of
charity is here.

Oh, and let's not forget the five, count 'em, five, vanity puff-pieces
appearing in the New York Times this week glorifying Billg's generosity,
one of which he wrote himself. That's worth quite a lot too, in PR
brownie points for both him and his company. It's far better than free
advertising; it actually looks like news and therefore has immensely
more persuasive value.

Interestingly, the NYT neglected to mention the gargantuan MS marketing
tie-in and obvious bribe against, and obstacle to, Linux adoption in
India. Certainly they've been falling all over Gates in their eagerness
to give him ink, so we're at a terrible loss to explain why they could
find no place, among those thousands of words, to plug in a brief
mention of the $421 million in anti-Linux ammo he's delivering.

Readers see greene-eyed monster

Now for some reader feedback. Admittedly, criticizing a man who's giving
a vast sum of money to needy people has its pitfalls, though since
Biblical days the hypocrisy of rich men conspicuously giving away what
they can't use has been a constant, exemplary theme, often treated with
acidic and sarcastic language.

Nevertheless our notoriously sharp-eyed and sharp-tongued readers have
detected both bitterness and envy in my recent article criticizing
Billg's pledge of $100 million to fight the spread of HIV in India, and
the media blitz which the New York Times so graciously provided him.

Why do you want to modify the operating system firewall rules for the sake of an application ?

Hi,
The initiative from Madras University seems good,
aditya. I just wanted to share my thoughts. I did my
M.S in U.S. 

>From what I have seen there, most of the computer
science departments of universities do their
programming under some flavor of unix. They tend to 
start teaching programming like c with windows
environment in Bachelors initially and at later time 
in bachelors, shift them to unix environment.

My university recently switched to Linux from Solaris.
If I am not mistaken, C programming in Unix
environment is more powerful than in Win environment.
If I am not mistaken, its because of Unix being
written in C thereby presenting more flexibility and
also options to  use the OS at deeper levels. I would
appreciate any thoughts, additional information in
this line.

In this context, Unix environment would be a much
better tool for learning C programming. Also not to
mention the possibility of playing with the kernel or
the OS as the source code is available. Network
programming in C on unix is quite good too. U get to
learn the grassroots.

You might want to share these thoughts with your
faculty. Talk to somebody who is close to you and open
to ideas. find out their requirements and post it
here.
we will also benefit from discussion of the various
software available and their pros and cons.

Sanjay

 As for as linux in colleges i recently came to know that CSE/IT (anna  univ syllabus)have shell scripting/sed/awk and C prog for unix flavour (as mentioned by sanjay ).from the feedback i got from some of the students is that 'they can hardly understand anything ' in *nix. One big reason i think of this is probly they dont have an Environment which facilitates this or lack of proper training,and for college students we need not even start from the scratch .i think if we guys can extend the demo-schools to colleges also we will be having lot of young hackers in ILUGC.


Happy Hacking!

not sure which distribution you are talking about. i assume it is either
redhat or mandrake, because i remember you discussing about these two
distros some time back.
if it is redhat, then 
http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/install-guide/s1-begininstall-hd.html

not sure about mandrake.

This is a rude question, but do these students understand anything
else apart from *nix?  There is little understanding involved in using
a GUI, any non CS/IT person can do that in a few hours of training.
I'd say that most students aren't interested in learning CS.  They are
interested in getting a good high paying job and living happily ever
after.  Those who really wish to learn will figure out how to learn,
find where to look for information and will learn no matter what.  My
favorite example is our dear MKS.  Here is a person who did not have
much exposure to all this and learnt so much by sheer desire to learn.
OTOH we have students in top univs who dont understand *nix.  Strange.

However, there is one thing I am completely ignoring here.  Bad
teaching.  If the teachers are bad then students are finished.  Worse,
if teachers are convinced that Unix is useless their attitude
naturally will rub off on students.  Maybe demo@schools ought to
educate the teachers?

Its a good thing I'm no longer co-ordinator of ILUGC.  With an
attitude like this God help ILUGC. >;-)

This  would continue  happening if  our teachers  think that  they can
expose all the  difficult portions of networking later,  say at the MS
level.  Teachers' say that, first let us introduce guys to programming
via the Windows route and later migrate students' to GNU or Unix.  The
BS  students' are  passing out  from their  courses full  of confusing
notions.....which gets compounded at the MS level.

Confusion aggravates as students'  are exposed to `non-free' tools and
when they are denied access to the code of daily used stuff, to learn.
The net result would be,  BS students' were partial-zombies but now we
get full-zombies at the MS level.

The aim of demo@schools is not to bring young hackers to _ILUGC_.
Instead make them do something useful by making them develop Free
Software. :)

Very true. This is the worst thing that can happen. They will even
convince the interested ones that anything non-windozed is difficult /
useless.

> educate the teachers?

Yes, that is also a long term goal. But its possible only when the
following tasks are completed:

  1. Convince the schools & students that Free Software is good for them
and start training them.
  2. Write syllabus, course material, books
  3. Teach staff

'1' is done at one school and is on the chart for another school. for 2,
3... we need more volunteers.

UNIX is not the same as GNU/Linux. UNIX is a proprietary Operating
System. GNU/Linux is a free operating system. So are the *BSD OSes.
OTOH, Solaris is not free. IT does not let you do whatever you want to
do with it. and there is no source code, so you can't study it. You
donot have an easy way of finding out how something works. and you can't
modify it too.

When we talk to schools / colleges, we should talk of these advantages
that Free Software offer. Talking merely of 'free of cost' wont sell.

I donot know if Windows was written in C. But just because something is
written in C doesn't mean it will be easier to write C code on that OS.

a proprietary UNIX environment wouldn't be as good as a free replacement
OS. Because in a Free Environment we have the source code and also the
rights to study and play with the source code. So it is a better
experience learning programming on something like GNU/Linux.

If you think you could do your part, please join the Demo@Schools

Do we really have to come to your residence to collect them? How about
having a dedicated "T-Shirt distribution fest" on this sunday? :)

this is what i understand. correct me if i am wrong.

u r using vastu.nic.in to relay your outgoing mails to the outside
world. but this server doesnt allow relaying. means, it can accept mails

(or other authorized users who are authorized to use this as an smtp host)

yes; so, what is the solution for ramanathan? well, what ramanathan has to
do is to find out from his isp what is the smtp host to be used. if he
has a leased line, the isp may not provide a smtp host and may expect him 
to run his own smtp server.

Look, I see your point but there's absolutely NIL point gained trying to
drum GNU/FSF ideology into a bunch of ignoramuses such as your average
college CS teacher.

Trying to split hairs distinguishing between linux and solaris, or linux and
gnu/linux will only confuse them and won't do anything to further the basic
aim of this effort - to introduce linux into schools.

Concentrate on the free beer angle and expect far greater results initially.
Stuff like "free as in speech" can be thrown in later, to a slightly more
enlightened audience.  [No guarantee of convincing that audience either -
lots of people don't really see the point in yelling "GNU! GNU!" when they
talk about linux <g>]

Most CS departments around in Hyderabad, where I did my college education,
at least have SCO / XENIX around ... either that or an antique solaris.

Making them replace that with a brand new linux will be far easier than you
think.

Just my two cents.

your machine sends out mail through a smarthost (DS entry in sendmail.cf

  You are right!, it depends on the teachers too.in most of the colleges here, it is very hard to find a GNU/Linux box.first the teachers/lecturers should be given a demo/enlightenment to get rid of the FUD.

hi,
the great mistake that i did was i accepted my project
as firewall implementation.if iam going to use the
firewall that comes along with application then it
will as if iam concentrating on application rather
than firewall.that is,it becomes aloof from my project
name.

Hi,
I guess I should have made it clearer. Linux gives you
the advantage of Unix and to top it its free, apart
from letting you play with the source. Also you dont
need very expensive machines. Solaris machines are
more expensive than x86 machines.

 Its not the ease, but it offers you more power and
more features. Let me put it this way: u can really
get your hands dirty if u were to use C on unix or c
on linux. I can't elaborate beyond that as I have not
gone too deep. This depth might not be necessary for
schools ( I could be mistaken) but it definitely would
be useful at the college level.

abt, demo at schools project, I will have a look.
Thx for sharin ur thoughts.

Sanjay

This might be because of lack of information abt
learning resources: which are good, where to get them.
We had the same problem in my M.S when we migrated to
Unix environment from windows ( My B.E is in
electrical). Fortunately, we had seniors to consult
and some of our colleagues were experienced.

There are resources on the net. The man pages in Unix
are very helpful too. 

Learning to use man, basic use of unix, using gcc,
using debugger were some of the stumbling blocks that
I faced. 

One thing that I realised: one needs lot of self
study.
If you expect the prof to teach everything, it wont
work. Its quite vast.

If you know faculty or people interested in gettin a
list of commands with some basic info and who wouldn't
mind sharin the info with other people who need it, I
dont mind compiling a short list of commands (very
basic).

I could put dir navigation, creation, using gcc (gnu c
compiler), gdb (gnu debugger)on it if u want. just
enough to get you started.

bye,
sanjay

Why go thro' all this? He could deliver directly - why use a smarthost
not knowing if he allows relaying? Unless he is behind a firewall/gw and
does not access to Internet directly from his server - then receipt
would also be roundabout. Since receipt is not shown as a problem, I'm
assuming his machine has direct access to the Internet. If he has a
dial-up, sendmail can be run in queue mode and dequeuing can be done by
"sendmail -q" ifup invoked on ppp0 coming up.

(or other authorized users who are authorized to use this as an smtp
host)

yes; so, what is the solution for ramanathan? well, what ramanathan has
to do is to find out from his isp what is the smtp host to be used. if
he has a leased line, the isp may not provide a smtp host and may expect
him 
to run his own smtp server.

Option 1. Create a user id on the local machine and CVS machine does a
fetchmail of that mailbag.
Option 2. Create an entry in virtusertable and point it to the actual
user@machine. Make sure the machine-IP info is available in /etc/hosts
so that DNS resolution does not take place.
Option 3. Create an actual user and in alias enter user@machine as

Sanjay,

Thanks for your mail Sanjay. But, I have tried all that you have mentioned
with respect to the XConfig (switching low to high reso) and also the
sndconfig for the Sound Card thru the Text login, but no agains as yet. The
Sound Card gets deducted by sndconfig probe correctly but the Drivers which
gets installed for the same is i810 chipset drivers. And the Video Card got
deducted while installing but display was not proper, later on trying with
the Xconfigurator the Video Card is getting deducted only as i810 Intel.

I have looked around with Redhat official site as well as Intel Support
Home Pages no agains as yet.

Let me try for somemore time before switching back to windows...

Thanx
-Sriram

Try pressing ctrl+shift and '+' key together or try
same with ctrl+shift and '-' key. that will let u
switch different screen resolutions. u must be gettin
a low resolution (like below 640 *480 or maybe
640*480). There is a way to fix it by editing the
config file, but I dont remember the name of the file.

I think the command for this sndconfig. Let me check
on this. I just installed RH 8. look up manual for
your motherboard, if you have it. else go 2 Intel site
and download it. it should mention the compatibility
of ur sound drivers.

I havent checked my sound yet. look at control panel
under settings and then go to device manager under
system and refer under sound, video and game
controllers, in WIndows. It should give you the model
and look at properties to figure out ports and IRQs.

U might need the port and IRQ info.

hey all,

i couldn't agree with Mr. Suresh Ramasubramanian more.I was at MIT chrompet , and listened to RMS,although i understand that his job of preaching about FSF etc. is of a slightly different nature , you can't "sell" linux  to people like college teachers when you start harping about what "free" means.I don't think you can get any work done that way.However tell me that , I can set up a mail server for the entire college in a jiffy, and that its for free , i'll buy that.

Also face it , we need a "bill gates" to "sell" linux.For instance If you can convince the PC vendors in the grey market in India to install linux on their boxes , i think that you would have broken through to the other side.

It is high time that we begin conversion of people , not just begin a revolution at the level i am refering to.I have always liked to believe that Linux is realised religion,not something that is revealed to the mortals.And that we don't need preachers , but as i have come to realise we need them too.

Gimme more ideas that i can SELL to my college profs.....comon.

Stressing  on the  `free beer'  aspect of  Free Software  is downright
suicidal.  You  will have no one  to buy your lame  mailserver when M$
enters the fray  with a free, latest version  of their exchange (mail)
server.  This is happening here in Kerala with the IT@School Project.

Trying to impress your  professors with shallow sounding cost benefits
is not  going to work anymore.   Instead tell them  that Free Software
helps you learn more by sharing and looking at the code. ;-)

Sharing is important because I learned a lot about the GNU system that
way.  Prabhu,  the `old' co-ordinator shared  a set of  Debian GNU CDs
and helped me.

This is just a suggestion.
How about organizing the distribution ceremony @ IIT/LATERAL.Prolly someone
with a car to spare can ship the t-shirts from somuz residence to IIT /
LATERAL
The other way round is to book a call taxi and be done with it .

i would love to volunteer but my car is 2 wheels short.

Hi Luggies,

  This is inform you that the T-shirts have to be collected  at my 
residence
only . It is not possible for me to carry it all the way to some 
place.
Please do understand this problem of mine. Probably you can work 
it out this
way. For example, someone who stays in mylapore(or whatever) can 
also collect it
for his friends staying nearby his place.

Thanks

Cheers!!!
Somu

My views:

1. Many teachers/ professors do not know Linux themselves and Linux has been
learnt more by hacking than by actual teaching. Maybe this represents the
divide.
2, I would bet on the enthusiasm of the younger generation than the
initiative of the older. Why not start Linux user groups/ study circles/
discussion groups in every college across streams not necessarily CS. The
reverse pressure would probably make people sit up.
3. This group could enthuse the management by taking proposals to the
college administration of cost savings in software by implementing
Meaningful Groupware - they would be no different from any corporate house
anyway.
4. I'm sure within the faculty there would be a few who carry the passion
for open source. Best to take them along.

I've integrated networks thro' practice and not education. I learnt Linux on
my own and have realised its potential in the context of the operating
corporate world in the future. Students must be made to realise this in some
form.

<my inputs to students on why it is the future>
It represents a large opportunity in the future. India is ripe as a country
and a platform given our Unix legacy. US has opensource code writers but
very few adopters as against Europe. This is the reason why it has not taken
off in the US. I believe adoption in India will be at a higher rate with
governments adopting Linux as in Europe,

  hey all,

  i couldn't agree with Mr. Suresh Ramasubramanian more.I was at MIT
chrompet , and listened to RMS,although i understand that his job of
preaching about FSF etc. is of a slightly different nature , you can't
"sell" linux  to people like college teachers when you start harping about
what "free" means.I don't think you can get any work done that way.However
tell me that , I can set up a mail server for the entire college in a jiffy,
and that its for free , i'll buy that.

  Also face it , we need a "bill gates" to "sell" linux.For instance If you
can convince the PC vendors in the grey market in India to install linux on
their boxes , i think that you would have broken through to the other side.

  It is high time that we begin conversion of people , not just begin a
revolution at the level i am refering to.I have always liked to believe that
Linux is realised religion,not something that is revealed to the mortals.And
that we don't need preachers , but as i have come to realise we need them
too.

  Gimme more ideas that i can SELL to my college profs.....comon.

How about trying this line with your prof... 

1. Give us GNU/Linux.... that way we students can learn more than what
   you can teach us with your outdated knowledge.

2. 18 year old high school student programmers now maintain key
   software like the Linux kernel.  No school/college will teach
   anyone to reach that level of profeciency.  Let the students use
   the source... Let us choose our future's course.

3. etc.

Hope you get the idea.

my suggestion would be that a "GNU/Linux User Group" seems to narrow
down the view. A Free Software User Group would sound fine. There are a
lot of other useful Free Software that are not available on GNU/Linux.
People who are interested in learning *BSD could join a FSUG but not a
GLUG.

That is precisely what the Demo@Schools does. Though we aren't
corporates ;) please, let us not duplicate our efforts. Join the
Demo@Schools and we can surely make this happen. :)

  Instead of using the word "FREE", use "FREEDOM" :) . All this
  things are depend on the type people, who are lessening. If Tech
  people then, highlight the aspects of learning and sharing of knowledge 
  etc. For Normal User, highlight the aspect of Adv and cost.

  I feel, FSF *philosophy* is hard to understand by newbies :)
  So GNU/People can take different route(s) to make the Normal
  people to understand it.

  In college, just form a L.U.Stud.G !!! make one Prof as adviser 
  or something like this. Try to introduce GNU/* thru him, that is
  more ( I feel ) appropriate and Safe way of doing things. :)

If he is using ERNET that is likely a uucp or other point to point link for
email only, and will definitely be routed through ERNET smarthosts.

ERNET has had enough of a headache in the past with customers running
antique sendmail installs and getting their open relays abused.. they must
have come up with this mailhub setup to counter this issue.

Hi All,

    I have a car with lots of boot space ... I can put that to use.
But I am not too familiar with all the roads near IIT and Somuz
residence so someone will have to accompany me.

BTW when is this Tshirt distro fest going to happen ?

we dont know, though dont be disappointed if you dont get to buy a tee
for yourself. You should have done advanced booking. 

anyway, you guys could wait for a while and Demo@Schools is looking at
ways of making funds for itself by selling goodies like Tees, caps, CDs,
etc., and we would ship stuff to you.

I agree with Mr.Bharathi

  Talking too much philosophy,pointing that they
should call only GNU/linux etc., to a newbie, I feel
is like ragging in colleges. Let us first allow them
to know that alternatives to M$ exist, and that these
alternatives are superior both materially and morally.

   I observe from this list that we have lost few
newbies by such postings, which only weakens our
cause.

There coudnt be a more valid point. Enthusiasm is contagious, and the only
way to make teachers enthusiastic about GNU/Linux is the students putting
enough enthu in it. 

I remember my B.E college, where our computer lab was a
strictly MS/Novell only lab. There was an old old Magnum SCO unix server
which had never been used enough, and no one ever had any intention of
using it either. The teachers were indifferent, all they were
interested in is giving assignments to the students and seeing the
output of the program on the screen. 

This was when the Linux bug bit me. We formed a small
group and pestered for permission to install Linux on 1 machine. A week
and couple of hdd formats later, we got the install to work! That was the
start of a movement (so to say..). By the time I finished my degree, my
college's mail/web/proxy etc servers were running on GNU/Linux. The
network was now equally divided as Windows/Novell Lab and the Linux Lab.
No wonder, max crowd wud always be sitting at the Linux terminals. There
was an even more enthu crowd among my juniors who were innovating with
Linux at all levels!

I hear that now MS software is being used only for official (documents)
purposes and for all educational purposes, Linux rules! We were able to do
this only bcoz of a small group of enthusiasts drove the other students to
use the better alternative for learning their C/C++ skills on, and when
students are hell bent on using Lin, the teachers cant be far behind!!

There is a version of UNIX called Chinese UNIX which the programmers
developed by just mangling with the object codes of various application
programs and kernel object code.  It was really amazing how they tackled
such a difficult task.  The modification of shell commands were performed
by experimenting with its object codes.  Without source itself you can do
this much means, if the programmer can get the source then ...? They even
have a version of BIOS called CCBIOS (Chinese Character BIOS)  which is
basically a modified version of I/O, CRT handling and Print INT
routines of a conventional BIOS.  The funny part is the chinese font
itself is taking 320KB of avl. 640 KB conventional memory of a DOS system.

May be one can start with the exercises at
http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mksarav.  For networking intro, you can start
with gnu-linux-nw-tutorial-0.2.ps on the same site. They are targetted for
beginners.

I hear that now MS software is being used only for official (documents)
purposes and for all educational purposes, Linux rules! 

-
that's very nice to hear ... microsoft documents are a pain

i read somewhere that microsoft's biggest profit share comes from not the MS OS but from MS Office.

i really think that there is a need to make ppl realise that HTML is a very good alternative to writing/saving documents in several ways.

1. a .html document is a lot smaller in size than .doc format (increases valuable disk space)
2. many don't know that a netscape composer actually can be used to write html documents. (i wrote my b.arch thesis in Ms Word. i thought HTML was some programming language and one had to write code to create HTML content.)
3. viewing across all platforms.

this conversion from .doc documents to html documents should be something u can very easily convince ur college staff if u can nail these points. 

So that is where the other non-Linux freebies such as Mozilla or OpenOffice come into picture. Promoting them will be as valid a point as promoting linux  :-)

                       Free Software Foundation of India
                                       
Press Release

  Apropos Microsoft's "investments" in India
  
    Thursday, November 14, 2002
    
   The Free Software Foundation of India would like to bring to the
   attention of the Government and the general public the negative
   implications of the "investments" pledged by the Microsoft Chairman,
   Bill Gates, during his present visit to India.
   
   At the outset, it needs to be made very clear that the proposed
   investments have no motive other than the motive of profit and nobody
   should be under the illusion that these "investments" are being made
   for the betterment of society or for the development of India. On the
   contrary, the type of software developed and sold by Microsoft,
   proprietary software, -- software which is supplied without its
   underlying source code and without the freedoms to study, modify and
   redistribute it -- constrains indigenous development and divides
   society.
   
   Of particular concern is the Microsoft Chairman's pledge of money to
   `Project Shiksha' aimed at educating 35 lakh children, tied to the
   condition that the Project will purchase and use licensed Microsoft
   software! Mr. Gates magnanimously declared that "In education, we have
   very low pricing. For big education projects, we will have larger
   donations so that the cost of software is lower." However, this is not
   a question of initial software cost. Microsoft would benefit
   tremendously from such a project even if it were to supply it's
   software free of cost as long as it is Microsoft software. That is
   because the children and teachers would learn (or shall we say
   "indoctrinated") to use only Microsoft software, allowing the company
   to maintain it's monopolistic stranglehold in education and beyond.
   This is akin to an MBBS course teaching potential doctors how to use
   medicines manufactured only by one particular pharmaceutical company!
   
   Besides the obvious issue of monopoly, there is another far more
   fundamental concern, that of software freedom. As pointed out earlier,
   Microsoft software is proprietary -- it is supplied without it's
   underlying source code under a restrictive license which denies its
   users the freedoms to study, modify and redistribute the software.
   Which means that the students and teachers of `Project Shiksha' will
   not have the option of "looking under the hood" to see how the
   software works. If they find problems with the software or if they
   wish to customize it, they will not have the means or the right to
   make such corrections or modifications, either by themselves or by
   engaging a third party. They will have to depend solely on Microsoft
   to provide such corrections or modifications. They will be denied the
   right to share the software with others outside the purview of the
   project premises, leading young and impressionable minds to believe
   that sharing is wrong!
   
   The People and the Government of India should reject outright any
   grant or investment which is tied to such restrictive conditions whose
   sole aim is to perpetuate a monopoly and make a nation's software
   infrastructure so hopelessly dependent on one corporation.
   
   The Government should set up an expert committee to look into the
   above implications and seriously consider formulating an IT and
   education policy based on Free/Swatantra Software. Swatantra Software
   gives the users all the rights and freedoms denied by proprietary
   software. It enables and encourages collaborative development
   independent of any corporate entity thereby guaranteeing the freedom
   and independence of its users. It facilitates devising local solutions
   to local problems independently of the software's supplier. It gives
   the users the means and right to study how the software works and, as
   software educationists know, the best way to learn to write good
   software is by studying other peoples' work. It allows the software to
   be shared, both "as is" as well as in modified forms, in keeping with
   the ethical tradition of the free flow of knowledge.
   
   An example of Free/Swatantra Software is the GNU/Linux operating
   system which is in widespread use especially in the enterprise, in
   government departments and in academic institutions around the world.
   The country-wide SchoolNet program of Namibia, for instance, uses
   GNU/Linux. Other countries like Peru are in the process of mandating
   or legislating the use of free software such as GNU/Linux to ensure
   their independence.

    About FSF India
    
   The Free Software Foundation Of India is a non-profit organisation
   committed to advocating, promoting and propagating the use and
   development of swatantra software in India. Our goal is to ensure the
   long term adoption of free software, and aim for the day when all
   software will be free (swatantra). This includes educating people
   about software freedom and convincing them that it is the freedom that
   matters. We regard non-free proprietary software as a problem to be
   solved, not as a solution to any problem.

Hello comrades!

Here in Germany Micro$ucks efforts for India are also a big issue in the
press. We have an eye on you, folks!

It would be so good if you could organize some actions or campaigns
against this! I would be happy if this propaganda bubble would pop!
They just should leave their money in your country :)

How is the ability to use an environment in tamil language in Linux?
Are there HOWTO's or something for that? Are there tamil fonts on the

Mandrake 9 comes with out of the box support for TSCII-IN (Tamil encoding).
There are also Tamil keyboard maps available - google throws up the URL
quite easily.

Please tell us from which disk you are trying to
delete/unallocate. If second disk did you use fdisk
/dev/hdb instead of fdisk /dev/hda
Has your system detected the second hard disk, if not
check jumper setting for slave in the second hard
disk.

Hi Luggies,

The T-shirts have arrived in two huge boxes. If anybody can bring 
a car(with lot of free space)  I can bring it to IIT tommorrow. 
MOST IMPORTANTLY the person who brings the car should be willing 
to drop me back at my residence.

If yes then call me at this number 6190611 and confirm. I will 
then send a mail to the list stating the time at which you can 
collect your T-shirts.

If everybody don't turn up tommorrow it is not possible for me to 
carry the boxes back to my house and moreover I can't leave them 
around in the IIT campus even if somebody says I will take the 
responsibility to distribute it. I am the one who took the money 
 from everyone and it's my responsibility to handover the T-shirts 
to the respective people.

You can always collect it from my residence at your convenience. I 
will properly categorise it and put a seperate bundle for each of 
you.

Looking forward for your co-operation

Cheers!!!
Somu

The Linux kernel supports USP printers with the "printer" module.

	modprobe printer

So the transport of data should be no problem. 
The best resource for getting printers to work is

	http://www.linux-printing.org

They got a database of nearly all printers and their optimal drivers.
Normally I install apsfilter, gs and lprng and configure the printer
easily with apsfilterconfig.
And I normally give lprngtool a try, but I am only buying printers with
good Linux support (i.e. Samsung laser printers, quite cheap).
I don't know so well the printer wizards of Mandrake or RH, perhaps they
have tools with even more eaze than Debian.

Have luck and a nice day,

Jochen

	If you see linux loading ..... then your MBR is ok.
The problem is with the kernel image, either its a wrong build
for your system, (for p3 you must use the package that is something 
like kernel-image-2.4.18-686, the version can be anything, but the 
build needs to be 686, its suff. if its x86).

Its also possible that the kernel image in your hard disk is corrupt.

Boot your system with the rescue disk, and try reinstalling the kernel
image. (No, you don't have to reinstall the whole system. Only the kernel!)

switch to GNU GRUB if you think its a pain to keep running lilo
everytime your kernel changes. GRUB is so powerful that you can view the
contents of the files on your partitions!

The UNIX way: there are many ways to do the same thing.

One way, but very inefficient.

> 5) i do not know what is ISO image ? [ Is win98 simple copy = ISO image ? ]

A: No. 
Im afraid Ill give an incorrect explanation. Let somebody else handle
this.

I assume you are working with Redhat.

If I were you (which you arent), I would do a network installation.
During the installation process, it asks for the source. You can choose
the machine with the CD-Drive.

http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/install-guide/

If you are using another distro, or a different version of redhat,
simply goto the distributors website, and search for "network install".

If anything else if itching you, post back to this list (after reading
that piece of documentation)

Squid is a HTTP proxy - won't proxy this sort of thing.

Just set up NAT / IP masquerading along with Squid.

yes, but u need to copy the iso images.

no a directory copy wont work. mount the CD on the linux box and do the
following to get the iso image.

a) mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
b) mkisofs -o "/dirname/disk1.iso" /mnt/cdrom.
The resulting file in /dirname/disk1.iso is an iso image of the CD. Make
similar copies for all the CD and copy them to all the servers.

start the installation by booting from a boot floppyand select the hard
disk install method and select the corresponding device name and give
the directory name.

http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-7.3-Manual/install-guide/s1-x86-begininstall-hd.html
hopefully it works. correct me if i am wrong.


having said that, this would be a very difficult process to install 40
machines this way. i would suggest to go for a network installation.
(havent tried it my self.)
http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/install-guide/s1-begininstall-net.html
http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-7.3-Manual/install-guide/s1-x86-begininstall-net.html

follow the link above and setup a server on the network with the install
media. and then boot all the machines using the bootnet.img image and
point it to this servers as explained in the documentation.

Hi,
   This may be the messages frm the NET related Device Driver. 
   You can redirect it to /proc/kmsg file. Command,
   dmesg -n 1
   
   If it is OK, then Add it in /etc/rc.local.

   For more info read, man dmesg :)

copying the install cd images to every one of the windoze machines may
itself take four hours if you plan on carrying the cd's around to each
machine. as suggested already, one way would be to have the images on the
one linux machine you have and use nfs to make it available to all the
machines. also, since you seem to be planning on an identical installation
on all the machines, redhat kick start would be highly recommended. since
you do have the redhat docs cd, look in it for the redhat customizatin
guide - it has a name like rhl-cg-blah-blah. if you have not done it
already, install this guide on the one linux machine you have and read it
with your favourite browser. the first chapter of this guide tells you how
to go about doing the kick start network installation - it is quite step
by step and visualizes a scenario quite like what you have.  spend about
an hour on it and you will be happy you did. if you still have questions, 
i think the list will help.

Hi

this seems to be due to the usage of incompatible ethernet card driver.looking for the appropriate drivers will help to solve the problem.also can you send the make of the card and the driver that you are using  ?
this link will be of gr8 use
http://www.scyld.com/network/index.html

and in the kernel source tree
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/net/
there is a file which holds card make and the suitable driver for that.

Happy hacking

Hi,

NFS Installation (RH) is a very straight forward approach to install in
all 40 machines.

Things to setup an NFS Installation

*. Install a Redhat System in One Machine first.
     (Assumptions ->
          + IP Address of this machine as '200.2.1.150'
     )
*. Then Boot that Machine in Linux.
*. Create a Directory called '/mnt1/7.3/'
*. Goto that Directory.
*. Mount the RH 7.3 First CD. (let say /mnt/cdrom/)
*. Copy the Contents of first CD
    + cp /mnt/cdrom/Redhat -avi /mnt1/7.3
*. Umount that CD and Mount the Second CD.
*. copy the RPMS 
   + cp /mnt/cdrom/Redhat/RPMS/* /mnt1/7.3/Redhat/RPMS/
*  Umount and mount the third CD.
*  Again copy the RPMS
   + cp /mnt/cdrom/Redhat/RPMS/* /mnt1/7.3/Redhat/RPMS/
*  Umount that CDROM.

* Export Your Directory for NFS MOUNT
    + Open the /etc/exports file
        + add the below entry into it.
          => /mnt1/7.3  200.*(ro,no_root_squash)

* Restart the NFS and Portmap
    + service nfs restart

Hi !

I am planning to give a comple overhaul to my website. I am looking for
an easy to use and administer Content Management System.

I donot want something like *nuke, as it does not suit a /personal/
homepage.

I know a little bit of PHP, so using that knowledge shouldnt be a
problem. Simply put, I want to spend my X'mas holidays usefully, and
also end up with a spiffy homepage.

I dont mind learning a new language in the process. I have python and C#
in mind. I want to know how suitable are these two languages for server
side scripting.

BTW, Whats all this noise I hear about Zope ?

Thanks for your time,

Unlike GNU/Linux, making copies of the CD-ROM is considered illegal.
Watch yourself! If you are doing this for a big guy, you might just get
caught. Beware!

thiagu> 5) i do not know what is ISO image ? [ Is win98 simple copy = ISO image ? ]

An image is very much like taking a raw copy of the entire contents of
your drive onto a file. Unlike copying the files in a drive, an Image
will not be a copy of the individual files. It will contain _everything_
including the empty space in your drive. So if you have 10MB of files in
a partition (or a CDROM) that is 650MB in size and you copy the
contents, the copied contents will only be 10MB but if you take an image
of the partition (or CDROM) the resulting "image" will be the size of
the partition (or CDROM) - 650MB.

Taking the image of your floppy disk:

  $ dd if=/dev/fd0 of=myfloppy.img

  restoring an image into a floppy:

  $ dd if=myfloppy.img of=/dev/fd0

  Finding more about dd:

  $ man dd

    HTH,

PHP is a very good Web Application development language. You could use
something like drupal (http://www.drupal.org/) or assemble your own cms
from the various classes available from http://www.phpclasses.org/ .

If you are thinking of developing Free Software which is GPL compatible,
try using php3. php4 has a GPL incompatible license and might run into
complications in the future. But as far as a personal homepage goes, i
think there wouldn't be any point in making your homepage 'Free
Software' unless you think you have a good piece of code in there.

I have used innerhtml code for that. The lower version of netscape is not
supporting that..i have tried similar code also which the lower netscape
version support ..then also it is giving error as object or method found

2) I am trying to play some wav files by fetching the data's from the

Hmm...PHP is my favorite language. 

Drupal looks promising. I have a very /modest/ webserver in my room. Its
a 266Mhz with 32 MB RAM. It runs FreeBSD and Xitami.

PostgressSQL/MySQL. I want to know which one is light weight. I had a
bad experience running Apache on this baby.

Ha ! Have been programming with PHP 4.x and 4.2 lately and never knew
about this issue. 

I am not planning to develop anything new, because the mess out there is
enough. Better to join some group that gets it atleast half correct and
improve.

Thanks for the input. Drupal has enough food to keep me busy. But, I
dont see a Photo Gallery module. Talk about 'Giving back to the
community'. :)

Oops ! I do see a module with a very /descriptive/ name called image.

Hi,
I have a machine with Adaptec AHA-7XXX SCSI Controller, when i try to
install RedHat 6.2 it works fine but when i try to install Redhat 7.2 or
7.3 the computer hangs on the screen showing  Loading aic7xxx driver".

I found the cause of the problem, which is the new SCSI driver for
Adaptec 7XXX controllers in Linux. Instead of going for the automatic
installation i started the installation manually (linux noprobe) and
after when the comp prompts to add a device i selected a SCSI controller
but the list had only the new driver and not the old driver. Can any one
help me out on this pls.

I found some help on this at

Ok, not necessarily easy, but if you were afraid of that, then you wouldn't
be on this mailinglist, right ?!!!
Have you looked at OpenACS. http://openacs.org
It a full-fledged Database driven modular Framework which provides for more
than what is required.
However, if you want to learn something, why not from one of the best ?

There is also an online book on the predecessor of OpenACS .. have a look
at http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/ . This explains the design of the
database, the scaling considerations etc and is written in the inimitable
style of Phillip Greenspun, a pretty funny guy. I am sure you will enjoy
reading it.

OpenACS is based on PostgreSQL(PL/PGSQL?), TCL, AOLServer(webserver).
The development community is very alive and doing great things. The
developer community is very helpful. http://openacs.org/forums/

BTW, the MIT SloanSpace(http://dotlrn.mit.edu) -- A full online-course
management and student community system is built on top of OpenACS.

So, if you are planning on learning, then this is a good toolkit to try.

Hope the info is useful and await your views.

Free Software enthusiasts alert: The Intel(R) C++ Compiler is not Free
Software. It is not covered by any free license. Donot use it if you

this list's policy to discourage non-free software, but then I realise

On most Linux User Group Mailing lists, it is a policy to mention

replacing number of servers with  single/ less

to cut costs of administration, staff and licensing
costs of os. thats a partial definition.

If u want more info, go to IBMs site and type server

True.

I do not need more than what I need. This is a /personal/ homepage

Sure, I did go through some ~25 pages of documentation. I enjoyed
reading it. But the facts dont change. OpenACS does not suit me.

Like I said, the baby does not run Apache. I do not know whether AOLs 
will play with it. And my skill sets do not interject with either
Postgress or TCL. Its like banging against a rock. :(

Interesting. Will give it a go soon.

Sure, I got to know OpenACS.

My first rub with MySQL and drupal was relatively successful. I just had
to "make deinstall" and "make install" PHP with MySQL support. ROCK !

Now, to install drupal and give you awesome guys a treat.

I notice something amiss. How can JavaScript fetch something from a

Netscape come into the picture ?

I got an idea for that. But, please let me know if the above

with AC97 support and i81X sound support. But all MP3 players are playing
the music fast.  I don't know why. In the kernel boot procedure, I get a
note that only 48kHz playback will be supported by the card. But the MP3s
I play are 44kHz. Would this be a problem? Even esd is not working well. I
get a lot of distortion in esd output. Can anyone help me out?
Thanks in advance,
Praveen.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0211231517200.5585-100000@lantana.iitm.ernet.in>

Hi all,

  I have designed a html page. It is having a text area
and text box. When I type something in both the text items,
It is not using the variable widht font, which I set it in
the 'preferences of netscape'.

  Is there any way to instruct the html page text items to
invoke the 'Variable width' fonts ?

with regards
 Vivek

I have not tried it, but I believe an extensively patched 2.4.18 has
been built using this compiler.  Patches were necessary mainly to make
up for lack of support of GNU extensions to C like inline assembly,
nested functions, attributes for declrations etc.

But Intel calls these patches as "temporary" meaning they are
continuing to remove/reduce them.

You want to imitate VB ? Hmm...I cant stop you.

Glade is very powerful. As always, you may want to check the homepage:
http://glade.gnome.org/

You must target v2.x series. Its HOT.

The last time I checked the glade website, it had a sweet tutorial. This
should help you. 

The GNOME Human-Interface-Guidelines is a must read. Often in
desktop-developer-list@, you see serious thrashing about a misbehaving
app.

hello,

Drupal set and configured in about two hours. ROCK !

To actually see the performance, I simulated a "slashdotting" effect
with a benchmark program called siege [www/seige].

Using a careful choice of 3 users and 5 concurrent hits (3*5=15), the
performance was dismissal, to say the least.

It took me about 9 seconds to generate each response. This is not
acceptable. :( 

I took to experimenting. I ran top at the same time. I figured out that
xitami forks an instance of php for every hit. So effectively, nine
copies of php. B.A.D.

What I did not see was nine instances of mysqld. 

So, now I want a program which _multiplexes_ requests, and not fork(). 
This includes CGI programs, because I have no static pages on my web. 
Is mod_php close enough ?

Any Ideas ?

I've installed Debian Woody on my PC which has a Logitech Optical USB mouse which is connected with a PS/2 adaptor

The mouse is configured as (XF86Config-4):
ection "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Configured Mouse"
	Driver		"mouse"
	Option		"CorePointer"
	Option		"Device"		"/dev/psaux"
	Option		"Protocol"		"PS/2"
	Option		"Emulate3Buttons"	"true"
	Option		"ZAxisMapping"		"4 5"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Generic Mouse"
	Driver		"mouse"
	Option		"SendCoreEvents"	"true"
	Option		"Device"		"/dev/input/mice"
	Option		"Protocol"		"ImPS/2"
	Option		"Emulate3Buttons"	"true"
	Option		"ZAxisMapping"		"4 5"
EndSection

The problem is that as soon as I login into Gnome, the mouse doesnt move at all.
mdetect detects the mouse @ /dev/psaux

I need to switch to a console terminal & then do a cat /dev/psaux & move & click the mouse => lots of junk appears on the screen. If I switch back to X, the mouse starts working. (please note that this works only if done from a console & not thru a normal gnome terminal window from inside the X session)

I've seen people use cat /dev/psaux to check if the mouse has been detected. But, why does this have to be a rather unclean way of getting it working ?

would appreciate any help on this

Also, has anyone on this list tried Gnome2 with Woody ? Would like tips on that & CDs (of Gnome 2 for Woody) too if available.

thanks in advance ...

And I remember reading a comparison of GNU Complier Suite (3.x) with the
Intel one.. and it showed that the performance was comparable, especially
with the new GCC.. couldn't find that one after a google though.. :(

Obviously, i believe you are looking for additional performance that an
Intel Compiler from Intel can provide.. is that right ?
The comparison showed that the GNU Complier was better on a few numbers
!!!! But then the best benchmark is to use the two of them yourself ! and
put in your own measures.

Hi all,

I have a 815EG Intel motherboard with onboard AC'97 audio controller. It
works perfectly on "windows" .
dmesg tells me ( redhat 7.2 / mandrake 8.2)

i810_audio:Audio Controller supports 6 channels
i810_audio:AC'97 codec 0 unable to map sorround DAC's (or DAC's not present)
, total channels = 2
i810_audio:drain_dac,dma timeout

Something peculiar also happens...when i load xmms with some mp3 it flashes
for 4 seconds and then stops. xmms "hangs"

Has anyone encountered this problem before ? Is there a workaround ?

Is this a problem associated with the hardware.

thanks
sriram

Dear Mohan

Great that I can be of help to you, and sorry for the delay in responding
to you. But a request, and I am CCing this to the list, as I think this
would be helpful to others as well ?! :)

Suggestion: Keep your Linux/technical/non-technical queries on the list
rather than sending them to me personally.
Why ?
1. I enjoy answering queries on this list, as and when time permits.
However, if you send me a query directly, I probably will not be able to
reply on time, and that may offend you or discourage you. However, it is
not my intention to hurt anyone.
2. Your questions would be useful to other people on the list and probably,
there are many more who may be able to help while I may be busy at that
time.
3. We may discuss personal matters and/or off-topic issues directly and off
the list. And I would not mind that, however, my priorities may not match
yours !!! so, you may again see delays etc, which I hope you won't mind.

Now, about your query...

You may have looked at the pervious replies on this topic. Go through the
material/links etc pointed out there, and if you need any more specific
help, then go ahead and ask away [on the list] !!

And more than anything, make sure you start *doing* things. Go ahead and
make your mistakes and *do* things. Thats the fun part, so, don't worry too
much about the results just now.

Do let us know how you progress, so that we can keep pointing you in the
right direction. Probably keep a webpage with updates about your project,
that you can refer to in your mails and then we can use it to advice you,
whenever you ask a question on the list.

Hope that helps !

I have  had encountered this problem.   Has your sound  module for the
specific chipset been compiled in as a module or into the kernel ?  Do
re-compile your kernel for setting up support for this audio chipset.

Watch out your /var/log/syslog for debugging errors.

Best...

Hi,

I have a similar problem with my i845 GLLY Motherboard, which uses the
onboard i845 Chipset for the Video and Sound Cards. As mentioned by you in
Windows the same works fine but in RH Version 8.0 the same gets detected
correctly but tries to open the same with the i810Chipset Drivers.

>From a member of the XFree86 Developer one Mr.Harris mailed me that the
i845 chipset of Intel is not supported currently. As far as the Video
memory goes I have resolved to make it work with VESA and increasing the
Video Frame Buffer to 8MB in the BIOS Setup.

Sound Card I am not able to configure.

Well, there is another thing with I came to know is that BASE Kernal 2.4.19
and XFree86 4.2.1 supports the same. But, this is not distributed with
Redhat only Mandrake 9.0 comes along with this.

Also, XFree86 4.3.0 comes with these Drivers for Video Card. I believe
Sound Card must be supported by Mandrake 9.0, I have not tried it since I
have decided not to experiment by donwloading the Source and Building the
same in my machine, as I do not have any experience on the same.

Hope this info throws some light on the issue mentioned by you. If you are
able to fix the same, please do let me know I shall try out the same in my
Box.

I have mentioned about i845 Chipset assuming that a similar issue could be
with i815EG Chipset.

Thanx

Hi all,

I have a 815EG Intel motherboard with onboard AC'97 audio controller. It
works perfectly on "windows" .
dmesg tells me ( redhat 7.2 / mandrake 8.2)

i810_audio:Audio Controller supports 6 channels
i810_audio:AC'97 codec 0 unable to map sorround DAC's (or DAC's not
present)
, total channels = 2
i810_audio:drain_dac,dma timeout

Something peculiar also happens...when i load xmms with some mp3 it flashes
for 4 seconds and then stops. xmms "hangs"

Has anyone encountered this problem before ? Is there a workaround ?

Is this a problem associated with the hardware.

thanks
sriram

Hello Ganesh,

not "Linux is not so functional".  Hope you understand the difference.

Hi Mohan,
  More than anything security means understanding. If you wanted to
do a project in firewalls you need to understand OS and Networks.
So it means aganin theory. 
www.counterpane.com has lot of links for good reading. 
Few things you must understand is 
1) security is not equal to encryption 

There is one recent article which has links at
http://www.ibiblio.org/javafaq 
site. The peon's guide to securing your system is one of the best
reading on this topic.
http://www.insecure.org has a good reading list on buffer overflow
etc. 

 I don't discourage doing firewall project. But I believe it should
be done at secondary or third level since there are many readings
to be done. It takes quite a bit of time to really understanding
which leaves you little time to do project work.

what am i missing here? i thought a dialup line usually delivers something
like 20 megabytes per hour - then a single cd would take about 27 hours
and the 5 cd's????

anyways, chennailuggies can get rhl8 or mdk9 unofficial cd's for free
(really free, like in free beer) from me. bring the requisite number of
blank cd's by my office (iit madras aero department) and i will write them
for free. i am usually in my office between 2 and 4:30 or so. i would
recommend you call me in my office (2578162) or my department office
(2578152) to make sure i am around when you plan to come. sorry, it is too
much of a pain to mail things out, so dont ask me to*. redhat 8 is 3 cd's
for the binary, 2 more for the sources and one more for the docs. i have
only the binaries for mdk9 and thats 3 cd's. each cd will take about 3 
minutes to write. 

maybe, we should put this in a faq or something....

sriram

*: exception; if you work for the government (state/central or even your

Hi mohan

 its always very interesting to do a project in networking/firewall.good that you have intended to do one.instead of re-inventing the wheel by writing a firewall from scratch ,you can try extending the netfilter/iptables with lots of options which the commercial firewalls have.netfilter is highly modular it allows extensions and new features by writing new modules.you can also write many netfilter hooks.

for more details on netfilter development.

RTFM at www.iptables.org | www.netfilter.org

there are lots of HOWTOS describing netfilter-hacking,etc

Happy Hacking

Hi,

I would like to know as to how the default settings can be changed once the
PC is installed by automatic probing.
The X-Server does not seem to come up and error pertains to the refresh rate
of the probed monitor.How do i change it to some other setting.Which daemon
or file should I check out.I am running a VIA Chipset MSI board 700 Mhz,
with 1 Gig RAM and 8 MB shared memory for AGP

Thanks guys in advance

I am right now into making a kind of 'library' of distros. It would be 
accessible to anyone on the list...in and around Madras of course.

I already have RH 7.3 and 8.0. I will soon add flavours of Mandrake, Gentoo, 
Debian, *BSD and Slackware.

Since am relatively new to LiNUX, what else would make this library 
comprehensive?

Thanks,
Hari

PS. I would very much appreciate if I got the feedback ASAP. Sorry for the 
rush...but I have a clock to beat. I will have 100 mbps only for a couple of 
days.

Gnome 2 CVS,  the latest build of mozilla - little things like that.

Then, some f/w oriented distros like Openwall.

100 mbps .. lucky.  Been a month since I had that kind of b/w available

I am not sure, but I think Mandrake does not fit on that _standard_ 650MB 
CD ?

I found GARNOME to be a _fast_ way to get a working G2D without
upgrading to the latest distroes. So, possibly you could just distribute
the tarballs. (about 70MB)

How fast ? It took me about three hours to compile everything.

	-- Ganesh

PS: If you are going to be using GARNOME, its a good idea to read the
GARNOME list archives. It covers almost every kind of problem. (esp.
xft2)

I use Samsung 32x CDRW. It works like a charm. Don't think you should have 
problems with any of the standard brands circulating in Ritchie Street.

Subject: Re: [Ilugc] Re: firewall and its implementation- project

Hi Mohan,
   More than anything security means understanding. If you wanted to
do a project in firewalls you need to understand OS and Networks.
So it means aganin theory.
www.counterpane.com has lot of links for good reading.
Few things you must understand is
1) security is not equal to encryption

There is one recent article which has links at
http://www.ibiblio.org/javafaq
site. The peon's guide to securing your system is one of the best
reading on this topic.
http://www.insecure.org has a good reading list on buffer overflow
etc.

  I don't discourage doing firewall project. But I believe it should
be done at secondary or third level since there are many readings
to be done. It takes quite a bit of time to really understanding
which leaves you little time to do project work.

what am i missing here? i thought a dialup line usually delivers something
like 20 megabytes per hour - then a single cd would take about 27 hours
and the 5 cd's????

anyways, chennailuggies can get rhl8 or mdk9 unofficial cd's for free
(really free, like in free beer) from me. bring the requisite number of
blank cd's by my office (iit madras aero department) and i will write them
for free. i am usually in my office between 2 and 4:30 or so. i would
recommend you call me in my office (2578162) or my department office
(2578152) to make sure i am around when you plan to come. sorry, it is too
much of a pain to mail things out, so dont ask me to*. redhat 8 is 3 cd's
for the binary, 2 more for the sources and one more for the docs. i have
only the binaries for mdk9 and thats 3 cd's. each cd will take about 3
minutes to write.

maybe, we should put this in a faq or something....

Hi mohan

  its always very interesting to do a project in networking/firewall.good 
that you have intended to do one.instead of re-inventing the wheel by 
writing a firewall from scratch ,you can try extending the 
netfilter/iptables with lots of options which the commercial firewalls 
have.netfilter is highly modular it allows extensions and new features by 
writing new modules.you can also write many netfilter hooks.

for more details on netfilter development.

RTFM at www.iptables.org | www.netfilter.org

there are lots of HOWTOS describing netfilter-hacking,etc

Happy Hacking

I am right now into making a kind of 'library' of distros. It would be
accessible to anyone on the list...in and around Madras of course.

I already have RH 7.3 and 8.0. I will soon add flavours of Mandrake, Gentoo,
Debian, *BSD and Slackware.

Since am relatively new to LiNUX, what else would make this library
comprehensive?

Thanks,

PS. I would very much appreciate if I got the feedback ASAP. Sorry for the
rush...but I have a clock to beat. I will have 100 mbps only for a couple of
days.

Gnome 2 CVS,  the latest build of mozilla - little things like that.

Then, some f/w oriented distros like Openwall.

100 mbps .. lucky.  Been a month since I had that kind of b/w available

I found GARNOME to be a _fast_ way to get a working G2D without
upgrading to the latest distroes. So, possibly you could just distribute
the tarballs. (about 70MB)

How fast ? It took me about three hours to compile everything.

PS: If you are going to be using GARNOME, its a good idea to read the
GARNOME list archives. It covers almost every kind of problem. (esp.
xft2)

I use Samsung 32x CDRW. It works like a charm. Don't think you should have
problems with any of the standard brands circulating in Ritchie Street.

Subject: Re: [Ilugc] Re: firewall and its implementation- project

Hi Mohan,
   More than anything security means understanding. If you wanted to
do a project in firewalls you need to understand OS and Networks.
So it means aganin theory.
www.counterpane.com has lot of links for good reading.
Few things you must understand is
1) security is not equal to encryption

There is one recent article which has links at
http://www.ibiblio.org/javafaq
site. The peon's guide to securing your system is one of the best
reading on this topic.
http://www.insecure.org has a good reading list on buffer overflow
etc.

  I don't discourage doing firewall project. But I believe it should
be done at secondary or third level since there are many readings
to be done. It takes quite a bit of time to really understanding
which leaves you little time to do project work.

what am i missing here? i thought a dialup line usually delivers something
like 20 megabytes per hour - then a single cd would take about 27 hours
and the 5 cd's????

anyways, chennailuggies can get rhl8 or mdk9 unofficial cd's for free
(really free, like in free beer) from me. bring the requisite number of
blank cd's by my office (iit madras aero department) and i will write them
for free. i am usually in my office between 2 and 4:30 or so. i would
recommend you call me in my office (2578162) or my department office
(2578152) to make sure i am around when you plan to come. sorry, it is too
much of a pain to mail things out, so dont ask me to*. redhat 8 is 3 cd's
for the binary, 2 more for the sources and one more for the docs. i have
only the binaries for mdk9 and thats 3 cd's. each cd will take about 3
minutes to write.

maybe, we should put this in a faq or something....

Hi mohan

  its always very interesting to do a project in networking/firewall.good 
that you have intended to do one.instead of re-inventing the wheel by 
writing a firewall from scratch ,you can try extending the 
netfilter/iptables with lots of options which the commercial firewalls 
have.netfilter is highly modular it allows extensions and new features by 
writing new modules.you can also write many netfilter hooks.

for more details on netfilter development.

RTFM at www.iptables.org | www.netfilter.org

there are lots of HOWTOS describing netfilter-hacking,etc

Happy Hacking

Hi,

I would like to know as to how the default settings can be changed once the
PC is installed by automatic probing.
The X-Server does not seem to come up and error pertains to the refresh rate
of the probed monitor.How do i change it to some other setting.Which daemon
or file should I check out.I am running a VIA Chipset MSI board 700 Mhz,
with 1 Gig RAM and 8 MB shared memory for AGP

Thanks guys in advance

Ditto here - now am back in Madras for good (and don't anticipate going

Mandrake 9 (2 CDs)

I am right now into making a kind of 'library' of distros. It would be
accessible to anyone on the list...in and around Madras of course.

I already have RH 7.3 and 8.0. I will soon add flavours of Mandrake, Gentoo,
Debian, *BSD and Slackware.

Since am relatively new to LiNUX, what else would make this library
comprehensive?

Thanks,

PS. I would very much appreciate if I got the feedback ASAP. Sorry for the
rush...but I have a clock to beat. I will have 100 mbps only for a couple of
days.

Gnome 2 CVS,  the latest build of mozilla - little things like that.

Then, some f/w oriented distros like Openwall.

100 mbps .. lucky.  Been a month since I had that kind of b/w available

I found GARNOME to be a _fast_ way to get a working G2D without
upgrading to the latest distroes. So, possibly you could just distribute
the tarballs. (about 70MB)

How fast ? It took me about three hours to compile everything.

PS: If you are going to be using GARNOME, its a good idea to read the
GARNOME list archives. It covers almost every kind of problem. (esp.
xft2)

I use Samsung 32x CDRW. It works like a charm. Don't think you should have
problems with any of the standard brands circulating in Ritchie Street.

Hi all

To demonstrate .NET (GULP!) in BangLinux the Microsoft
people need Debian 3.0 CDs. I am copying this mail
to my friend who called me up in Hyderabad. I request
people who can help to please get in touch with him.

<Interesting aside>
Apparently the Rotor stuff runs on FreeBSD and Debian
only - but as you can imagine BangLinux would rather
have the demo on Debian than FreeBSD

  Hi All

I recently came across a distro of linux called "Knoppix". Actually it 
is not a distro, but a single bootable linux CD which can boot a machine 
into full featured linux (based on debian). The ISOs(696 MB) can be 
downloaded from http://www.knoppix.com <http://www.knoppix.com/>.

The CD has 1700 MB of compressed software. The bootable CD automatically 
configures your devices and boots into X windows. It does not write 
anything into the hard drive for the installation(uses ramdrive, so it 
is better to have 128MB or more), but mounts the hard drive as read 
only(You can remount it if you want to have write access). It is great 
for a lot of things including system recovery and to demo linux apps.

I had a bit of a problem with modem, but as I'm on LAN :-) , i dont have 
any problem. I had a few problems with older hardware, but who else can 
run a linux with X and KDE3 on a P75 machine with 32MB ram?

It is good to have one under your pillow even if you think M$ is your 
kind of OS(data recovery from a broken WinNT(NTFS) is painful).

Linux evangelist take note: this might be your best tool to preach about 
linux to those who face the blue screen of death.

Yes, the Knoppix CD is really great. Another nice feature is, that it
executes certain shell scripts if you want it (it executes a i.e.
"knoppix.sh" in the KNOPPIX-Directory on the CD if it exists).

I use this feature to install Servers without interaction, booting the
remastered CD. sfdisk, mkfs, tar, some additional scripts, and your farm
is ready, even without any network connection.

So I have to send a "thank you"-email to Klaus Knopper, who designed the
CD.

It is also possible to install the CD on harddisk, there are efforts
made to automize this. After that you got a fresh Debian, with all the
packaging power.

I think, there is no system with more ease, with full OpenOffice and
KDE3 and all that fancy stuff. XFS is also supported.

Just my additional bits,

Jochen

That should get autodetected without any problems ... the card on SiS930s is
a SiS900.

Inspite of repeated spamming^mailing , We are still in need of

Yes, the demo was conducted at Sri Chandrasekarendra saraswathi
vidyalaya. The exposition went on well. The feedback was good. Students
are eager to leartn Programming, "geek" stuff. We are trying to spread
the goodness of sharing and how great it would be to share and live.

As a step further we are planning to conduct another demo/presentation
at Madras Christian college. We are in need of volunteers. There are
five volunteers for this demo of which four _will_ be present. There are
over 8 topics that are to be talked on:

  1. Introduction
  2. What is Free Software?
  3. Uses of Free Software (student's perspective)
  4. Networking features on GNU/Linux
  5. Enterprise features
  6. DTP [X]
  7. Software development tools [X]
  8. conclusion

  Of these, we have somehow forced the other volunteers to take up
  morethan one topic to talk on. points 6 and 7 need volunteers. 

  We invite enthusiastic volunteers with a flair for Free Software to
  come up to talk on these topics.

  If you have plans of doing the same in your city too, you can get
  along and use the work (letter seeking permission, pre-event posters,
  syllabus, books, etc.,) that we use. wel, the books aren't ready yet.
  Maybe you can help?)

  You can join our mailing list:

Upgrade your distro to redhat 8 would be my advice - RH 6.2 is old.

If you have to stick with RH 6.2 for some reason, then don't use linuxconf
to configure sendmail, and also upgrade both sendmail and sendmail.cf

http://www.mail-abuse.org/tsi/ar-fix.html#Sendmail should help you.

Message-ID: <OF271D9CA5.8B71CFC3-ON65256C7E.002630D8@chennai.tcs.co.in>

Hi,

 Regarding Encrypt in linux 7.2,
 assume that the file is in Encoded form.

 Step1: Using CRYPT cmd, we decode it and the output is stored in a file.

 Step2: We move the output file again into the same dir with the
 set_env_.ksh name
 Step3: Now the file can be used by the main program.
 Step4: Once the process is over, we again use the CRYPT to encode it.
 Step5: We move the output file again into the same dir with the
 set_env_.ksh name.
 Step6:  Now the file is in decoded form .

 Following is the script:

 crypt key<test.ksh> test1.ksh
 echo  "encoding"
 mv /u/cxclem2/test1.ksh /u/cxclem2/test.ksh
 echo "decoding"
 *********some other processes***********
 crypt key<test.ksh> test1.ksh
 mv /u/cxclem2/test1.ksh /u/cxclem2/test.ksh


 how do i use ps -ef to view the encrypted file directly in linux 7.2?

 Thanks,
-Ramesh

I use the roaringpenguin rh-pppoe - kept timing out for some reason.  Could
you give me a sample pap-secrets file you use for dishnet's broadband
router?

Your best bet is to go with the ISO. That way you are sure not to miss
any files, and you could also check the MD5 checksum after downloading 
to verify it.

Dont know _exactly_ what you are looking for...but between RH and 
Mandrake, this is what I saw on Another list:

<quote>

It is a tremendous toss up. In my own experience, RedHat provides much 
better speed then Mandrake. Mandrake provides far more polish. For 
drake,Webmin is installed by default as is FreeSwan. Sendmail is 
replaced with Postfix and wu-ftpd is replaced with Proftpd.

Try setting up Evolution on both distros. You know the part where you 
choose your time zone? watch RedHat zoom into Florida. Mandrake kinda 
wobbles slowly. I know... not exactly a great bencmark... but who among 
us hasn't used the end of Windows 3.1 solitare (with the cards bouncing) 
as sort of a performance gauge?

RedHat seems kinda stripped down but then again, I really don't need 4 
IRC clients and 7 PIMs.

well, burning a cd without an iso image is rather painful. for distros 
like redhat, it may not work at all. also, making a bootable cd would also 
be rather painful if you dont have an already bootable iso image. so, you 
really dont have a choice at all, but need to go with the iso images. the 
matter of md5 sum is a different issue. individual files are typically 
only a few megabytes each and the chance of undetected errors is quite 
small. the iso cd image is a single file of 600+ megabytes and the chance 
of error is relatively higher - hence many people may consider it prudent 
to do a md5 checksum comparison; for the ultra-sensitive types, sites like 
rpmfind.net also provide md5 checksums for individual files. of course, if 
one downloads an entire distro, running the md5 checksum comparison on 
each downloaded item would be rather painful too, so we are back to iso 
image...

/James Maguire, www.NewsFactor.com <http://www.NewsFactor.com>/

Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT

- news 
<http://rd.yahoo.com/Dailynews/nf/bs_nf/inlinks/*http://biz.yahoo.com/n/m/msft.html>) 
has unveiled a new policy to discourage its business customers from 
switching to Linux (news 
<http://rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/nf/bs_nf/inlinks/*http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22Linux%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw>

or other open source alternatives. Called Open Value, the new offer is 
part of the software giant's Licensing 6 volume licensing program.
What's happening is that Microsoft sales reps have been instructed to be 
on the lookout for any businesses that are migrating some of their 
machines to the Lindows OS," Yankee Group analyst Laura DiDio told 
NewsFactor. "If [the sales reps] think there's a real threat of some 
pretty large numbers of defections to open source, they can request 
authorization from Microsoft higher-ups to offer steeply discounted 
pricing."

DiDio said that in some cases, the discounts could be as high as 50 
percent.

*Price Hikes*

Microsoft instituted its Licensing 6 program this summer. The plan 
raised licensing fees for the company's business users from 33 to 107 
percent, according to research firm Gartner.

Although many of Microsoft's large enterprise customers complained about 
the increases, small businesses were particularly hard hit. Of those 
that declined to participate, the majority were small businesses.

Now, with its new Open Value initiative, Microsoft is attempting to make 
participation in Licensing 6 easier for these small businesses. The plan 
allows small businesses to spread out payments over three years while 
still staying current with the latest Microsoft releases.

The program will begin early next year, according to Microsoft.

Additionally, Microsoft is offering zero percent financing until early 
2003 for one of its Licensing 6 programs geared toward small business 
customers.

Hi
I want to use some web mail along with qmail (mail box with maildir format).
I would like to know the best one from the listers. (except IMP like clients

 I do want to know which mail box format is the best one. mbox or maildir??
We have around 100 users who will be using our pop service. Will mbox format

Maildir.  And if you use squirrelmail with IMAP it is a good way to go.

100 users = no probs.  I've seen mailservers on an old 486 for that many
users ;)

But yeah - maildir is far faster than mbox for what you want.

<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;What do u think about man+rake , do u think if 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Dont know _exactly_ what you are looking for...but between RH and

<DIV></DIV>&gt;<QUOTE> 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;It is a tremendous toss up. In my own experience, RedHat provides 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;much better speed then Mandrake. Mandrake provides far more polish. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;For drake,Webmin is installed by default as is FreeSwan. Sendmail is 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;replaced with Postfix and wu-ftpd is replaced with Proftpd. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Try setting up Evolution on both distros. You know the part where 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;you choose your time zone? watch RedHat zoom into Florida. Mandrake 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;kinda wobbles slowly. I know... not exactly a great bencmark... but 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;who among us hasn't used the end of Windows 3.1 solitare (with the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;cards bouncing) as sort of a performance gauge? 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;RedHat seems kinda stripped down but then again, I really don't need 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;4 IRC clients and 7 PIMs.

That is a timeout for some reason.  Maybe you have some firewall settings
blocking port 25 outbound from that machine?

check if sendmail is enabled in your services. this symptom is consistent
with sendmail not being enabled in services. the version of sendmail in
rhl8 uses two processes for mail, one for incoming mail and a second queue
runner for delivering outgoing mail. if sendmail is not enabled as a
service, outgoing mail will not show up in the mailq (since it is saved
elsewhere and not in the usual lmqueue directory) and mailq will show
empty. however, as soon as you start the sendmail service
(/etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail start), mail will be delivered (and those that
are deferred will show up in lmqueue/mailq). i dont know if this is how it
is supposed to work, but it seems to work this way.

The same ssh key across all machines, perhaps?

A friend from Japan, Sandor Markon <markon@rd.fujitec.co.jp> is a manager
of a Japanese manufacturer and is involved with introducing GNU/Linux to
the firm. The firm is considering to start outsourcing software projects
in India, and is doing an initial survey here.

He will be attending LinuxBangalore2002 from Dec 3-5 in Bangalore.

"Seeing how active you are on the Indian Linux scene, I wonder if
you might want to help me with the initial inquiries, perhaps by
introducing me to some people or companies that you know," he
writes. If you are working in the field and are interested, please get 
in touch.

He is interested in getting in touch with embedded systems development
capacities, software engineering tools, development environment
customization etc., "but of course also in more general software
capabilities, too".

<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;What do u think about man+rake , do u think if 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Dont know _exactly_ what you are looking for...but between RH and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Mandrake, this is what I saw on Another list: 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;<QUOTE> 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;It is a tremendous toss up. In my own experience, RedHat provides 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;much better speed then Mandrake. Mandrake provides far more polish. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;For drake,Webmin is installed by default as is FreeSwan. Sendmail is 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;replaced with Postfix and wu-ftpd is replaced with Proftpd. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Try setting up Evolution on both distros. You know the part where 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;you choose your time zone? watch RedHat zoom into Florida. Mandrake 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;kinda wobbles slowly. I know... not exactly a great bencmark... but 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;who among us hasn't used the end of Windows 3.1 solitare (with the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;cards bouncing) as sort of a performance gauge? 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;RedHat seems kinda stripped down but then again, I really don't need 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;4 IRC clients and 7 PIMs.

<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;What do u think about man+rake , do u think if 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Dont know _exactly_ what you are looking for...but between RH and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Mandrake, this is what I saw on Another list: 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;<QUOTE> 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;It is a tremendous toss up. In my own experience, RedHat provides 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;much better speed then Mandrake. Mandrake provides far more polish. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;For drake,Webmin is installed by default as is FreeSwan. Sendmail is 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;replaced with Postfix and wu-ftpd is replaced with Proftpd. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Try setting up Evolution on both distros. You know the part where 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;you choose your time zone? watch RedHat zoom into Florida. Mandrake 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;kinda wobbles slowly. I know... not exactly a great bencmark... but 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;who among us hasn't used the end of Windows 3.1 solitare (with the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;cards bouncing) as sort of a performance gauge? 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;RedHat seems kinda stripped down but then again, I really don't need 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;4 IRC clients and 7 PIMs.

I guess not. Not many people read HTML mails on a GNU/Linux Mailing List.
I wonder if anybody read it at all.

He could make an attempt next time by some thing more "readable".

Sorry about not checking whether it was a HTML mail.

Subject: [Ilugc] Need gurus to guide youngsters in GNU/Linux projects
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0211302155380.1328-100000@news.goa.bytesforall.org>

This is Trevor Warren's baby... and I'm trying to help. The Project
Resource Centre mailing list is trying to help students in finding
suitable GNU/Linux projects. Could you spare some time in acting as a
guru/mentor for these young minds? 

Someone said: "The grand essentials of happiness are: some thing to do,
something to love and something to hope for..." There's a bit of all three
in the above idea. Let's take it further.

Please see http://mail.sarai.net/mailman/listinfo/prc

Do sign up there. FN
