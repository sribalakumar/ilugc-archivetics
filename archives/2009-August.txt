Well,1) By *they*, I meant all the people in my college whom I have gathered
some kind of information. I really do not know if what they say is true or
not
2) Yes I want to submit it back to project heads(upstream) because I would
want to do my my final year project in whatever I am taking up. Or is it
something you suggest against?
3) Domain of interest: Cryptography (for now at least, because I haven't
found anything else this appealing).
4) Time frame:(official) Jan '10 - May '10. Unofficially I can start working
as soon as I get to know what I have to do.
5) Expectation:

              a) A project good enough for the professors (of whichever
department) to take me as a student in a good US university for my MS.
Rather simply put, a project that would add a lot of weight to my statement
of purpose enough to make them want me in their college (or am I being
overly ambitious?).
              b) A minimal stipend (Quite evidently, my project mentor
wouldn't be a professor from my institution(or am I wrong?). If so, then
according to my college's final year project specifications, 'a student is
allowed to undergo only an _internship_ outside the college'. And by
internship, they mean 'a project giving the student some amount of money in
the form of a stipend' or 'the student must already be placed in that
company'.

thank you. but these links are about starting your own projects, which means
I'll have to come up with something totally new (or) invent something (it

Doesn't NetworkManager detect this? Did you try to create a new
connection via that?

Some mobiles have two modes to connect to PC, either as memory device, or
modem so make sure in your  mobile you configured it to appear to PC as
modem.

Actually, it`s not me, one of my friend is facing this problem. And,
according to him, he is using his cell phone as modem in Windows. So, I
think, it`s already enable.

What error? What you just showed was output from system-config-network
and not NetworkManager.

There is an embargo on the CentOS DevTeam about this issue - however, 
keep in mind that Dag is no longer a part of the CentOS Team, he left on 
his own months back. Also - http://planet.centos.org/ will give you the 
complete picture.

CentOS isnt going anywhere, the projections are for a 'worst case 
scenario' - which are *always* meant to be grim, since the worst that 
can happen is just that - quite grim.

There will be news on that front shortly.

There is nothing for or against. You can always submit your changes upstream.

1. It is not ambitious, but, has a very cunning motive. IMO, you
should always work on F/OSS projects because it teaches you something
new, and you enjoy doing it, and contributing to it, and not for the
motives you have mentioned.

2. What hasn't been learnt and practised very well in 3 1/2 years of
"engineering" cannot be undone by one final semester "project". This
is yet another of those common statements that I hear from students,
"Let me do one good project, and hopefully get a job or an MS".

\--

That is a shame! Are they running an educational institution or doing business?

3. You always work on a Free Software project because it teaches you
something, and that you enjoy the freedom of source, knowledge and
fellowship, and not for the above 'motives'.

Sure, you could get 'money', 'fame', 'job', 'admit for
post-graduation', but, those are only side-effects.

I am a little confused here... 1) Does the motive really matter assuming the
quality would be undeterred?
2) Yes it is a shame. Yes it is business, they are doing.
3) I guess I have no choice but to bank on a good project since _I_ have
wasted my engineering life in this sordid institution.
4) I saw the sites you wanted me to go through. The obstacle there was that
it is a freaking ocean out there and I am to pick a drop of water out of
that. I am really confused as to which project I should choose even within a
particular sub category :(

PS: I shall take up your advice about the motive..

Friends.

One of my friends, learning embedded and linux drivers.
We googled and found tons of learning materials.

But still, I want your suggestions and guides
on what materials to start and work with.

Please share the links and sites to start on
writing linux device drivers.

Thanks.

What you need to do:

1. Find F/OSS projects online that work with cryptography. Maybe they
need something to be implemented, and you can contact the developer
mailing list, and start working on it. Developers will be able to help
you on mailing lists, IRC.

2. The "i-want-2-do-project. tell-me-wat-2-do" is not meant only for
new projects. It has all the information that we have discussed.
Please re-read it again, and let us know if you have any queries.

There is an IRC live commentary for the presentation here:
http://shakthimaan.com/downloads/irclogs/2009/2009-06-27_mbuf_iwanttodoprojects.log
http://dgplug.org/irclogs/2009/2009-06-27_mbuf_iwanttodoprojects.log

If you do 'good work' as how you have been promising on the quality,
the developers will themselves give recommendations, or you could give
your code to the "professors" working on cryptography.

Atleast, most F/OSS projects have people working from Academia,
Industry and so on, so you might even find a professor there.

The point is that you need to prove yourself with your *work* first,
for people to see, rather, than have a wild goose chase.

You should never do things that are forced on to you, including F/OSS,
because, you will easily quit, or hate it for the rest of your life.
The important thing is that you always do things because you love
working with it, and you will do that very well, for the same reason.

As always, you are welcome to agree to disagree with me.

SK

Well, most corporates/organizations will offer you a decent stipend if 
you do your interns there. But the problem is you will most probably be 
not working on anything that they are going to make use of. Unless when 
your work is at par to their expectations on their own employee's 
performance or you have done something far too useful for them to 
neglect, it's just another intern for them. Mostly it is a passive 
talent hunt for future employees.

There is a saying in Tamil, "Ikkaraiku a'karai pachhai". A talented 
archer will still hit the target with a bamboo bow. It doesn't matter 
how your institution is, which in my personal experience every 
institution is more or less the same, it's your own personal 
aspirations, self-motivated initiatives and hard work which is going to 
pay. It's *your* damned life and future, and it is utter 
irresponsibility to blame others for making a mess of it.

Everybody have to start from some shore and swim. If you don't start 
from somewhere, you are never going to swim in the ocean one day :) At 
worst case, close your eyes and pick one, take it as a challenge and 
contribute to the project. It will at least surely prove to be a 
learning experience and will help you pick better projects next time.

The cell phone in "modem mode" may be enabled in Windows because of the 
application/drivers provided by the manufacturer for Windows OS. 

The above may *not* happen automatically in Linux.

Does the device show up in dmesg?
Is the usb-serial module loaded in the kernel?

Just like in Windows, the proper drivers need to be installed. 
usb-serial module must be loaded.  Additionally, the user may also have 
to switch to the device to modem mode.  

Google for "linux usb switch mode" or get started here

Better, but there's still room for improvement.

When you quote someone's email during a reply, it's
customary to also include the first line like how I've done.
That makes it clear to whom you're addressing your reply.

And also ensure the > and >> are correct as they
represent the various levels of quoting/replies.


And one more request to other list members, please don't
assume everyone is using gmail's view and reply without
quoting anything.  Even with gmail conversation view,
it's impossible to understand what you are replying to
unless you quote the original author properly.

Try it with lowest speed and use name brand media. Your DVD writer may 
be the culprit if it still fails.

Check if postgres engine is running it's startup script in /etc/init.d/

I don't have Debian so cannot paste the exact name of the script.

Check if the db server is running in the first place - try:

sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart

Replace 'restart' with 'start' if it's down and try again.

Sorry, replied too soon. Try changing to the postgres user first:

sudo su postgres

And then try:

psql template1

One of those steps should show you the problem.

If the college is so serious about students making money, I am sure, you can
play with the tables a bit and make it appear like your dad pays you. "Some
amount" can be equated to Rs. 200 a month :P If they probe, tell them
"Recession" :P

I am 100% sure that you can bend the rule by talking to a person like your HOD
or principal. For instance, I am interning at IITM and so I have a
special consideration
to do my project alone and not in groups of 2 or 3 like my classmates.

LOL nice one . By the way is it true that colleges are that serious on money :O
Maybe the college main motive is to make the student earn some money
via project so that the project money would be considered as a hard
earned money :)

This situation I think has arose because many students just buy
projects .. maybe the college is trying to improve the situation .

Which installation procedure you followed? apt-get install or you compile on your own ?
In debian it is /usr/share/postgresql only as far I know.

What is the out of ps, does it show postgres?

Message-ID: <9d3184460908011956q5ca3c5ecn8fbe6bcba908c2a6@mail.gmail.com>

All,

On behalf of ILUGC, we had done following workshops,

Session 1:

Topic: Workshop on  LAMP (PHP, MySQL)

They were around 70 participants from the final and pre-final year students,
from the Department of Computer Application of Saveetha Engineering College.
The session had started with an introduction to the FOSS and to the LAMP.
Followed by the Hands on,  which had given enough opportunity for the
participants to hack the  MySQL and PHP. The workshop concluded with an CURD
application  written with PHP and MySQL.

Prerequisite:
If the participants where done the following then it would have given them
the more fruitful result.

Before the participants attending any kind of workshop, they should do some
sort of ground works, In my case I had planned for the LAMP session, the
prerequisite for the LAMP is XHTML and JS, the participants were missing
bits and pieces of the HTML. So that I happened for me to spend some time to
brush it up.

This could be avoided  from their end by doing some kind of home works by
preparing them selves for the workshop. It could give the ample time for us
to focus more on the core subjects of the workshop.

Conslusion: The overall the participants had enjoyed the session. Many
thanks for Mani, a final year student who had organized a good event in a
short span.

Session 2:

Title: FOSS Introductory

Resource: Mr. Raman and Myself.

College: Thirumalli College of Engineering, Kanhipuram.

Participants: from Final year CSE

The session was presented by Mr. Raman, he had started with FOSS
introduction, Exploring the Desktop & Desktop Applications. The same thing
had repeated for the second batch in the after noon.

Many, Many thanks to Mr. Raman who had readily accepted my invitation in
very short notice. If he had not accompanied me then I would be in soup.


Note: Their is an interesting which is left behind the scene, I believe if
he could narrate you that,  it would be more appropriate.

Please do not post on top of original message. It is very inconvenient to reply to your mail.

Since it is not in ps pg is not running. The fact that you get ownership permission is what you have to look into. Normally the owner of /var/run/postgresql should be user postgres. Did you meddle after a plain apt-get install? Normally I haven't faced such problems. 

If you didn't but still permission problem exists, look at debian mailing list.

Why don't you check who owns those directory? and try to give ownership to postgres. Try to probe a bit.

Normally a plain apt-get install postgresql should be fine.

You may try to remove the package - and reinstall. Use purge option
of apt-get.
NOTE: removal will result in loss of data,settings etc. If you have something important take care, I am not responsible for the loss.

The omni present dust reeks havoc on such devices. 

Also do not bother to get them repaired (unless it is under warranty),  
it works for a few days and then they die.   I have a stack of DVD/CD 
units that bit the dust (pun intended) due to 2 simultaneous 
construction projects going on behind where I stay.

Friends.

Today, I found a free screen sharing application in alternate to webex,
which works in Linux.

http://www.yuuguu.com

Go to this site and download the app and create login.

Now, you can share your desktop with anyone in the world.

The host should install the application.
The Viewers do not need to install anything.

Browser is enough.

We can use this tool for online Demos, Troubleshooting, Training, Meeting etc.

Here are the steps. First you need to have VB Guest addons in your guest OS.
This is applicable to all Guest OS in VB.

1) Install the VirtualBox Guest Addons. This can be done after you start
linux. From VB menu (not from the main window), there is a link to it. This
action will show a Addons CD in your Linux desktop. Right-click the CD and
auto start. This will install addons.
2) Shut down your Linux.
3) From Guest OS settings in VB add a folder which you need to share. Give a
shorter name for the share.
4) Start your Linux guest OS.
5) From terminal create a folder called "<type something>" under /mnt
6) Type "sudo mount -t vboxsf folder-name /mnt/<type something>"
7) Bingo!!! you got that shared folder loaded.

You know what, I had this problem a couple of days back. I fixed it myself.

Also see
http://www.giannistsakiris.com/index.php/2008/04/09/virtualbox-access-windows-host-shared-folders-from-ubuntu-guest/.
I got this link from googling with "virtualbox shared folders ubuntu"
as

I haven't bought a magazine for a distro media forr a long time hence
I have some doubts

Since the DVD contains three images .

1 . Can we directly boot from that DVD  ?
2 . Should we burn individual iso's to boot individual distro ?

I remember some magazine doing it the 1 way :)

Anyways I am suggesting this edition to some juniors who dont have
good knowledge on computers ( even things like burning a image to cd )

Hence is this a easy one for them ?

Not true. The emacs community is extremely helpful gnu.emacs.help is one of
the nicest usenet newsgroups one is likely to find.

There's plenty of literature at various levels.

   - The info pages that come with Emacs are *meant* the definitive
   reference material for the language. It is available as a book too. It's not
   insubstantial documentation by any stretch of imagination.
   - There is a 'elisp tutorial' that comes with Emacs - that is for
   complete newbies to elisp, again available as a book
   - There's a book 'Writing Emacs Extensions' by Bob Glickstein, which I
   suspect was not very popular because the real target audience for that book
   are pretty well served by the elisp reference anyway. I have not read it,
   fwiw.
   - Then there is my own small attempt to introduce elisp to programmers,
   that I have presented twice at ilugc meets. Available at:
   http://www.cs.utah.edu/~karra/tutorial/

You should try gnu.emacs.help There are newbies trying to edit basic text
files to language experts and emacs developers on that newsgroup.

"use" is often misunderstood. It is often what you know about the tool that
makes a 'use' practical.
For a machine learning course project I once had to fetch, parse, and
analyze tonnes of web pages automatically. Well, it was actually
implementing the algorithms in one of the early CS research papers that
eventually lead to PageRank and beyond. I programmed in emacs lisp and ran
the program in batch mode, and it worked perfectly.

The reason I used emacs lisp for that purpose was very similar to why one
uses a language like Java in day to day use - I was familiar with the
language, and it had the necessary "libraries" that made the non-core task
of web page fetching/parsing/etc. trivial - I used w3's routines
extensively.

anyways...

Darn, I seem to have missed this thread somehow. Well, I'm not sure if 
Karra has actually turned a PHB or not, but I can certainly admit to the 
same temptation - Lispers (of all hues) tend to become PHBs because then 
they can write perfect, beautifully crafted Lisp in peace, having little 
work to do, unconcerned by real-world app development constraints. At 
least that was true until Clojure came around, I guess ;)

Vamsee.

My reasons were more prosaic, and had to do with Karra going off to
the IIMs and leaving programming behind. :)

Sriram, just thought it would alert you to the thread sooner or later.

A request for a talk:

I have been observing that most newbie programmers who are used to he
doze world do not know about "using the computer" from a usage
perspective. I have observed that they do a line by line analysis,
which can be done by a one or more RegEx find and replaces. They know
RegEx to some extent and they would have used it in their code, but
didn't realize that it can be used in the editors as well. This is not
restricted to just RegEx.

Consider the piece of code that reads more than 30 columns from a
database and assigns it to some variables. This could very well be
simplified by using regex/sed/ cut/ etc... or if you have some GUI
editors such as Kate, just keep using find and replace....

Would it be nice, if we can organize a talk on "improving productivity
by better utilizing the tools available", with a lot of times for
Question and Answers? Any takers? (I might not be able to attend the
session myself, due to my office timings).


with regards,
Natarajan.

not much in FOSS, but if you google on these topics for open source tools you 
will get something

you also need to post your model and the full traceback for diagnosis. Are you 
sure you have a field called 'name' in your model?

The problem should be that the dictionary 'form.cleaned_data' does not have
a key called 'name', which means the data from the browser doesn't have a
field named 'name'. Make sure the name of the entry in your html form is
'name'.

Subject: [Ilugc] Scheduled/Timed Suspend and Resume
Message-ID: <1249468809.4060.4.camel@mjolnir>

Hi, everyone,

Is it possible to put a Linux computer into S3 sleep in a way such that
it will resume at a preset time (say 30 minutes later)? If so, how would
I go about doing this. Google doesn't know.

The reason I'm asking is that I have a Pentium D computer which acts as
a file-server/DVR. Now, as everyone (except me when I bought the
motherboard that only supports these) knows, these are power-hungry
monsters so I intend to keep it in sleep most of the time. I'm assuming
I can get it to Wake-on-Lan, so serving files isn't a problem. However,
I have no solution for scheduling it to wake up to record. Any
suggestions?

Thank you for reading,

Have some process run some "knock" port like trying to ssh to it to
get it to wake-on-lan.

The kernel is "asleep and cannot wake itself up". Someone/something
must interrupt the sleep from "outside" via the BIOS.

A different option is to use the power management features of the
kernel. Put the processor into low speed state and HDD to spin
down. This does not conserve as much power as a suspend-to-ram but may
be enough for you.

The kernel will spin up the drive and ratchet up the processor speed
as and when required. (BIOS does not play a direct role here). The
startup is also significantly faster.

Regards,

Kapil.

CodeIgniter is a Popular and light weight PHP framework. I am very much
interested in writing in some libraries for CodeIgniter.

The library will include the following functions.

1. to generate HTML necessary to display videos.
  2. to get the thumbnails of a video from various video providers.
  3. to get the addition information about video like users who created the
video, date of creation, hit rate etc.
  4. will be able to customize to suit application need like video height,
width, color, border etc.
  5. Will have options to communicate with API's provided by Video Service
provider.
 This library will work with following video service providers YouTube*,
Google, Blip.TV, Revver, MySpace, MetaCafe, Last.fm, JumpCut, SevenLoad,
Spike TV, Daily Motion, Veoh, Vimeo, Tudou, imeem, Guba, Yahoo Music Video,
and Live Video video formats.

So i need some suggestions for this.....

5= 1 + 2 + 3 +4

yes that can be one feature . But what about using HTML5 for
displaying videos . It is going to be a w3c standard soon .

Its me who suggested to do this project. The whole usecase and features of
this library has not been listed here. Actually its a drupal emfield module
http://drupal.org/project/emfield for CodeIgniter.

what will you do for the rest of the video service provider ?

I comfortable with "echo $this->video->load($url);" which automatically
identifies the service provider and generate HTML to embed video.

Indeed It is not required if your application use single video provider.
Imagine the case where your application needs video to be embedded from
various video service provider. Each API will has its own set function and
parameters it will hard to use, in that case you could use this library as a
gateway to API functions.

 Inline styles defined in embedded html will override CSS styles.

AFAIK CodeIgniter has no ORM concept.

Fixing some existing flaws or providing some enhancement would be good idea.

Good but not ideal for a student who started PHP hello world program a month

*Go to TTY1 via Ctrl + Alt + F1  ( TTY1 is the command line where you
can type some *nix commands )
* Login with your username and password
*Delete some files via $rm command
* Restart your X or gdm or kdm .. whatever ( maybe $startx should just work )

The error is clear- pulse-session command could not be executed. Fix it
by checking at command prompt in failsafe mode. Ofcourse I don't know what is pulse-session.

No it didn't help :P

You missed the most important ( according to me :D ) article :

http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/moving-beyond-first-firefox-billion

Snippet from the article:
You may have noticed the odd bit of celebration around the magic
billion downloads  milestone for Firefox. Of course, as Mozillans
themselves point out, that figure doesn't tell us very much; more
useful, perhaps, are stats like 300 million users, but that too is
only an estimate. And in any case, I think looking backwards is
precisely the wrong thing to do at this point: what we need to ask is
how do we get the *next* billion downloads ? and why do we want them?

Why do you want to run it on port 23 but? What will you achieve by doing that?

Any IP port is like any other so the choice of port 23 instead of
port 25 will not make mail any more or less safe. Safety will be
determined largely by the SMTP daemon you run and how well you
configure it.

Dear Friend,
                By default, some client place they blocked port 25.some
client they open port 23 .In this place i decided to use SMTP port as 23
instead of 25 ? is it good?

It is not just a matter of choice. Standard ports for known services
exist for a good reason. If some other MUA/MTA over which you've no
control wants to connect, it will try port 25 only for SMTP.

IMHO, one should first question the logic behind blocking port 25. I
see no merit. It only isolates you from the world to run services in a
closed user group. If that indeed is the scenario, it does not matter
which port.

Actually, it's fairly common to remap popular port numbers to higher 
ones to avoid brute-force attacks. Though this step in itself won't make 
a server secure, it definitely helps.

Vamsee.

Just to be sure it won't clash with other system services, move it to 
something very high - 22000 or some such. Also be sure to close all 
unused ports with iptables or shorewall. And inform your users about it, 
of course ;)

Vamsee.

I havent used any of these frameworks.  I have spent hours in reading the
reviews from various sites.

Kohana is the fork of Code Igniter, and kohana guys started this, as the
direction of CI changed to their commercial blogging tool.

Kohana seems to have some advantage over CI..

Assuming this is a company/closed group server, I think mapping the port 
to something else is a good idea. He just needs to inform the change to 
the users. SMTP is not a web service that the whole world needs to 
connect to. Even TLS/SSL enabled mail servers routinely use ports like 
467 or 587, sometimes interchangeably.

Vamsee.

I have a practical example where you take it as a challenge.  Recently, i
was given the assignment of implementing single sign on in a webapplication
(PHP) running in Linux, to use the windows AD & Kerberos authentication.
There is not enough material in the net, and i tried implementing mod_ntlm
and kerberos authentication, but without success.
Due to this, there is a consideration to move the website to windows based
server, and this problem of integrating in to windows domain, is a big
obstacle to fully embracing open source technologies.
Our management, had taken a couple of decision to fully implement few
applications in sharepoint itself, for the convenience of inter-operatbility
and single signon.

I feel, taking such an assignment of developing/enhancing solutions for open
source technologies to seamlessly inter-operate with windows network, will
be a fruitful experience.  Ofcourse, as shakthi kannan said, if your motive
is to get an MS using this, you may miss a lot of things.

I think, shibboleth is web-single signon similar to CAS. (pls correct me, if
i am wrong).  What's required in my company is to utilise the windows
integrated authentication. ie, when a user logs in his desktop within
intranet, he should be able to access all intranet sites, without prompting
for user credentials..

I just wanted to share, that a team of final year students from Mahendra
engg college had done their final year projects in RoR.  They created a
project in rubyforge, for this, and uploaded their files in the SVN.

http://rubyforge.org/projects/eduerp/

They too had faced the same kind of issue, and after some level of patient
explanation, their HOD accepted it.

The project was NOT a hi-fi one, but just an attempt to develop a web-based
ERP software for their college.  They could only develop a basic prototype
version, and submitted it for their final year project.

The advantage they had over others is that, they were able to explain in
detail about RoR, their project, how they did it, and other technology they
used like SVN etc, while other students who purchased could not do so.

So, considering the immense support from this ILUGC group, i feel, you
should be able to persuade your HOD to allow you.

hi,
I have libssh2 installed, but how do I log in to a remote server using it? I 
tried typing ssh2 on the terminal and it did not recognise the command. It 
sounds silly, but google did not give me an answer.

I also faced similar situation for a mini-project , they gave me a list of
topic , all were quite old ideas like library management, reservation
system, etc, But  I was allowed to do project in FOSS. Not all the lecturer
may know about FOSS and stuff. but they should not think that students  are
trying to cheat them with project which they don't know to evaluate. My
lecturers encouraged me. but the external lecturer doubted me. I made a boot
loader which looks like  grub and my friend made LTSP. The external doubted
that both the projects are looking same. since I also used floppy disk to
load my boot loader. The claim was "You both put the floppy and computer
boots in Linux whats the difference?". The time given for explanation was
not enough for us to explain the difference anyway i managed finally. so the
students have to show their interest and their activeness to promote FOSS in
their respective college, in their beginning semester,  at least HODs and
lecturers will know your interest first and will be supportive in these kind
of situations.

hi all:
while there is considerable resistance from HoDs and other staff
members re FOSS projects, there have been a number of projects done in
the past three years.  I have been requesting the students / staff to
give me brief details, but the response has been sparse and sporadic.

i think it is very likely that most of these students (especially from
Anna Univ affiliated colleges) would be members of this list. if they
could gather info from them, we could use the info for furthering the
cause of FOSS projects in colleges.

to start with, the student(s) could send the following info:
a) title of the project
b) student info -- name, reg no, branch, year
c) foss tool(s) used
d) brief abstract & status -- completed / partial / simulated ...
e) weblinks -- if they have uploaded the details

the info could be sent to nrcfoss  at au-kbc dot in   and/or to my
office id <srinivasan at cdac dot in>. i can work along with bharati
and colleagues at  au-kbc colleagues to get the info collated and
sorted. am taking this au-kbc route, since this could part of the
nrcfoss activity.

the summary info could be highlighted thru nrcfoss and ilug-c portals.
we could follow this up with
(a) gettting more info about the project work, check and arrange for
demo of successful projects
(b) interacting with them to work out the strategy for making it
easier to do foss projects -- including getting the colleges to agree,
etc.

if possible, we could have a demo on select projects on the software
freedom day, may even give prizes for the top three or so ; more
importantly, announce that
"FOSS projects to be done during 2009-10 even sem will get support
from us ; ILUG-C in collaboration with NRCFOSS will evaluate the
projects ; selected ones will be put on demo (in may/june 2010?) and
prizes / certificates offered from nrcfoss. "

While ILUG-C could focus on TN colleges, other groups could get this
going in their respective states.

Srinivasan.

In the same directory? You can just run touch within a for loop.

Again, similarly using cp in a for loop?

My methods are crude so there might be better methods of doing it. I'd
myself like to know about those too.

The idea is not that the step will completely secure the server - at 
least it will avoid those dumb script kiddie attacks those look for 
services running on common ports and run dictionary attacks on smtpd and 
sshd. Try it - run a fairly popular website, it's own mail server and 
look at the logs - you'll be greeted with constant barrage of login 
attempts on common ports. Remapping ports is only the *first step* in 
securing a server. Unless you like keeping your mail/ssh daemons 
needlessly busy with bogus login attempts.

Vamsee.

Replace the number 3 with your number 1,00.000 :)

"libssh2" is a library for using the "Secure Shell Protocol" (version
2). You need to install a program that uses this library for using it
to connect. For example, I think "libcurl3" uses the "libssh2"
library and "curl" uses the "libcurl3" library.

So you can use "curl" to make a secure shell connection using this
library. The following two examples are from the "curl" manual:

  Get a file from an SSH server using SFTP:

        curl -u username sftp://shell.example.com/etc/issue

  Get a file from an SSH server using SCP using a private key to authenticate:

        curl -u username: --key ~/.ssh/id_dsa --pubkey ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub \
                scp://shell.example.com/~/personal.txt

To make a secure shell connection in the usual way you need a client
like "openssh-client" or "dropbear".

Regards,

Kapil.

moving the service to other non-standard ports amounts to security by 
obscurity. there are several ways to limit those script attacks - more like 
security by design. for example, one could do rate limiting of incoming 
connections using iptables. to rate limit ssh connections to 3 per minute from 
any single ip address, one would do something like

iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent \
        --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 2 -j DROP

to deal with more severe / persistent attacks, one can use a package like 
fail2ban which affords more flexibility.

Did you try this?
http://www.google.com/search?q=create+certificate+tomcat

I got
http://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate-installation-tomcat.htm
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-3.2-doc/tomcat-ssl-howto.html (Official)
http://users.skynet.be/pascalbotte/art/ca.htm  (Self signed
certificate  - tutorial)

But before you go ahead with this, I strongly suggest that you should
understand the basics of SSL, what a certificate is, who a CA is
(Certifying Authority) etc... Wikipeida is a good source.

Kudo's to the Mahendra engg college students . We need more such cases
to take the foss movement forward :)
Do you have a small document ( odt or pdf ) which could explain how
they progressed from stages and the issues they faced so that we could
study them . A project blog would also be helpful .

This is kind of common but what we need to be happy and learn from
them that they were *able* to convince the head which is quite an
accomplishment ( in my opinion )

Well done guys .. keep contributing upstream code :)

This is quite an issue with some engineering colleges I heard of . I
think the best solution for them is to tie up / relate to NRCFOSS node

It need not be first year because after 12th the student may not be in FOSS.
The most *ideal* situation would be the college already using FOSS
electives 1 and 2 . I just *wish* that they are made compulsory and
with a lab/project course associated with it.

Yeah it's always good to keep nice ties and personal relations with
your department senior lecturers with the HOD because it make *lot* of
difference in support you get during projects .

+1

Since many of my servers are directly accessible over ssh from the internet,
I make it standard practice to rate limit new ssh connections.  My logs are
looking much happier.


To the OP:

Why permit external access to SMTP in the first place? To address this problem
at a higher level, make all clients come through a VPN before accessing any
internal servers.

OpenVPN is a great solution.  At work I'm using a cheap Linksys WRT54GL
wireless router with the TomatoVPN firmware (tomato firmware + openvpn), and
~10 WinXP/Linux laptops connect through it.  Works great.

Given better hardware, OpenVPN can handle far more clients and network
traffic.

Message-ID: <28ac23fb0908070854o2a45349fna9b98b0536d96637@mail.gmail.com>

Hi friends,

     I am Balachandar.Final year B.Tech - IT student.I want to develop
a c language code optimizer.I know the compiler's can optimize the
code but its not effective always.I did a small experiment with the
below code and got a positive result for me.I want to highlight the
codes which can be optimized to get quicker execution.
       Just like this,
               for( i = 0 ; i < ( j/ 100) ; i++)
               {
                     //bla bla
               }
      If i execute this each time ( j/100 ) is calculated and takes
more amount of time.
      Instead of this,If i follow this,
               k = j /100;
               for( i = 0 ; i < k ; i++)
               {
                     //bla bla
               }
      Here j /100 is calculated only once and the execution time
reduces automatically.So i want to highlight these kind of places in a
code.
     I have few questions,
             1.Is this idea good?
             2.How should i start to develop this project?
             3.I want to develop it as a plug-in for any IDE(
preferably code-blocks).
             4.Can i get your support ilugc?

I agree that the resistance from the faculty has always been their for
anything new which also includes FOSS and FOSS electives.
But how do we resolve this issue regarding foss projects ?
*would a compulsory faculty training help solve this issue ?
*How about going the top-down approach via a declaration from Anna University ?
*Change in the project specification in the universities
*Including a FOSS elective which involves just coding a project be it
python,php ,ROR or even bash programming
*Organising small workshops in colleges which involves hacking into
FOSS code  ( for students )

And many more. This actually is a serious and I also think we will be
hearing more from the students as many people keep on hearing about
linux,FOSS,ILUGC & NRCFOSS . Students will be asking more and more
such queries. There needs to be a framework in place by either NRCFOSS
or ILUGC or both  which could address such issues .

Yes .
@ Students : Please give more information . only if you come forward
and tell us than people here could help .
Do feel free to discuss anything ( related to FOSS ) here . Also
mention the difficulties you face we all would be more than glad to
help .

Yes this is good PR . It will help drive some info on FOSS into the
heads of CS department faculty who have been resisiting change.
( A prize/certificate really makes a difference in HOD minds .. (
personal experience :D ) )

The Swecha project from Free Software Foundation AP chapter has been
encouraging and also organised a Industrial session /program/project
called E-Swecha distro which is aimed& created for and by Engineering
students .

Their website [1] has some information . There is a forum[2] where
many students discussed their issues with GNU/Linux etc . There is a
wiki page [3] which discusses the packaging of the distro .

well, I guess you are talking about developing a code quality tool,
there are bunch of them available for C. Splint is one which I know

You can think of binding these tools with emacs.

what sort support are you expecting? This looks lame unless you

I wonder if the compiler did not optimize these type of instructions

If you create more no of files (>1K) in same dir, then it MAY
slowdown the script speed. So just try to limit to ~1K files per
dir. Try the following pattern:

D000/file.001 to file.999
D001/file.001 to file.999

HTH :)

Apart from your display, your video card (linux) driver also need to
support the above setting. Try to find the details related to that
or post the video card info to the list.

Actually, my suggestion was to have a larger project in each college, and
every batch of students contribute a module or part of that big project.  It
is in that plan, that i started eduerp for mahendra college.  But i could
not get the next batch to continue working on it.

We all know that open source projects require persistence, consistency, and
long term planning.  Wordpress is being developed for the past 4 years, and
drupal for more than 6 years.  So as all other open source projects like
phpbb, open bravo etc..

The reason why indians could not come out with such projects is because of
lack of project planning, and also the fact that our academic project
syllabus is so premature.

I hope, like minded persons in ILUGC can come forward and guide the students
towards major open source projects.  Atleast, if each college could house
one major open source projects, (Whether existing, or new concept),
subsequent batches coming out of that college, can contribute a module to
it, and enrich that software in to a useful thing.  In this case, it need
not be a final year project.  The students can join right from their third
year starting, and whatever the work they do, may be considered for final
year projects.

Suggestions please!

Senthil

It has nothing to do with project planning. Indians in India are
either extremely busy with office work that they don't have time for
community F/OSS, or, they have become PHBs [1] who don't have the
skill-sets or know-how to work.

Syllabus is ok. Just that people don't know how, and where to apply it

IMO, everything should start from the first year.

Good choice!  Code optimization is a fascinating topic.  I did this
during my college days too :-)

I must warn you that compiler design is a difficult topic which needs
lots of time and guidance.  You could spend many years on this subject.


> I know the compiler's can optimize the code but its not effective always.

There's a vast body of theory behind compiler optimization -- trees,
control graphs, basic blocks, code invariants, dead code elimination,
loop optimizations, array traversal optimizations, intermediate code
generation, peep-hole optimization, machine specific optimization,
etc. which need to be carefully understood before attempting to build
a code optimizer.

See the internal implementation docs for GCC for more:
    http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/

I also suggest that you read the Dragon Book (new cover looks nice):
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Book_(computer_science)

In optimization parlance, this technique is called "constant folding".
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding

If you use

    const double pi = 22/7
    ...
    double area = 2 * pi * r

in your code, the compiler will calculate 22/7 at compile time itself
and just substitute the values for all the constants. The second line
will be optimized to:

    double area = XX * r
XX is whatever the output of 2 * 22 / 7 for that specific 16/32/64 bit ISA


Compiler optimization must be used with care, as it may introduce
subtle bugs.  Here is an example:

You may be tempted to optimize the below code:

for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
    c = i;

to just

    i = 1000
    c = 999

But if "c" refers to the memory mapped address of a serial port, then
you've obviously left out a lot of data.

Compiler optimization also has problems when you are debugging. See
the man page for gcc's "-g" option.  Best to disable optimization
entirely while debugging "gcc -O0 -g".


While code optimization is a fairly advanced topic the moment, the
constant advances in programming languages and paradigms offers
an ever increasing opportunities and areas of study for the keen student.

Enjoy the ride!

If you are going to use those files only for reading, then this would work

You could also classify it as a "loop invariant", ie, a value
which does not change throughout the runtime of the loop and
thus can be moved above the loop body.
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop-invariant_code_motion


This is also highlights one of the best things about optimization, any
number of optimization methods can be applied to a code block with
varying levels of success.

To help decide which optimization to use, modern compilers like
GCC, Intel compilers, and MS VC++ can use "profile guided optimization".

I am not sure if we could say that the syllabus is ok though I agree
that a student could definitely make a lot of the current syllabus. It
definitely needs to be revised and improved according to industry
changes and should be vendor neutral ( most of it is  but faculty
don't think so ) .
Here is a syllabus listing of most of the institutes in India .
http://fci.wikia.com/wiki/Syllabus_Review
It is a wiki page so please feel free to enter your syllabus in it .
We definitely need to discuss Anna Univ syllabus right from how the
12th class student is given programming & OS introduction  to other

Undoubtedly everything should start from 1st year because basics like
how the voltage levels function in a diode will help him understand
diodes better which in turn will help him understand transistors and
photo diodes so on to IC's , Micro processors and computer
architecture .
Everything is Science :)

But new people come and develop modules for wordpress .Some also leave
,they might not  be maintaining their modules .So new students can
find such modules and start maintaining them .
The students can just look at the project(module) statistics and
releases . It will explain lot of things :)
Lemme tell you one incident . I heard in one IRC channel ( dont
remember the name ) that one guy wanted a wordpress feature . You know
by evening that feature was implemented as a wordpress module , thats
the power of FOSS !!

This is a good thing but wont the faculty be forcing one student into
one module or one language or platform which he may not be interested
in .
Hence I could suggest a pool of project ideas and mentors like what
NRCFOSS has did .
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/ProjectIdeas
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/FellowshipMentors

The faculty should help the student in choosing a project / direction
. When I mean "help" it should be guidance but not enforcing a
particular technology to the student . This will really help the
student to do whatever he likes. It may also bring out some great
innovations in FOSS :)

First start the mysql server, su -c 'service mysqld start'  and then
connect. Use 'mysql -u root -p' command instead of mysql -u root.
Here is my attempt to connect to a mysql server  which is not yet started !

> I must warn you that compiler design is a difficult topic which needs

           I dont want to exactly optimize the code.I just want to
highlight the piece of code where the programmer can optimize.I
studied a module in Infosys campus connect program about "algorithm
design" and there they listed a series of techniques to follow when
coding (Like the one below).

      Just like this,
              for( i = 0 ; i < ( j/ 100) ; i++)
              {
                    //bla bla
              }
     If i execute this each time ( j/100 ) is calculated and takes
more amount of time.
     Instead of this,If i follow this,
              k = j /100;
              for( i = 0 ; i < k ; i++)
              {
                    //bla bla
              }
     Here j /100 is calculated only once and the execution time
reduces automatically.So i want to highlight these kind of places in a
code.

    So if the compiler optimizes all these codes then why should one
follow these techniques.So my idea is i should have lot of code
optimization templates (Templates can be added in future if anyone
founds a new technique) and my project should search the code for
these kind of places with the help of those templates.If it find
anyone then it should highlight the entire line and give a hint
message.The user cn use it or ignore.

             I hope for my idea i dont need to learn all these

That is where most people have the wrong conception, IMO. A syllabus
is only a guideline, and a "student" is expected to venture into
gaining more knowledge beyond what is prescribed, and this is the
single most important aspect that a "student" must fulfill in
"education".

Degree, job, awards, friendships are all side-effects.

That is contradictory.

When you are working with ISPs who block *all* outgoing connections on 
port 25 but *allow* outgoing SMTP traffic on port 26.  There is little 
choice that their end user customers have, that is the ISPs network 
policy to prevent SPAMMERS from sending out bulk mail to smtp hosts on 
the 'Net.

Most hosting companies thus run their incoming SMTP connections on 26 to 
allow MUAs to send outgoing emails.  Some ISPs do so on port 587 [1].

[1] The right way to do it is allow SMTP submissions on port 587 with 
user authentication (SASL auth being the common method) read more @
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5068>

Of course, there is nothing stopping you from using any other port but 
it is not recommended.

One cannot use MTAs within these networks without a smarthost or a
relay outside these networks then. From OP's message, it seemed like
he was talking of a MTA.

These would not be the MX hosts for those domains as they will not be
able to receive mails from other MTAs. As good as CUG then. For a CUG,
the flexibility for the port to be used always exists with the
administrator.

Hi,

I joined the ILUGC mailing list recently. This is my first email to ILUGC.

Since we are on the topic of syllabus, let me mention one important point
that I have not seen mentioned so far in engineering circles.

I have seen the syllabus of many engineering colleges that come under Anna
University, and in all of them, I see that Computer Science subjects are not
included in the syllabus. In other words, engineering colleges don't teach
Computer Science and Engineering, as they claim to, but only teach Computer
Engineering. While in other engineering disciplines, as far as I am aware,
the basic science needed is taught, starting from schools, the same is sadly
not the case in Computer Science.

Of course, the subject, theory of computation alone is being included as one
of the subjects taught in B.E(this was not the case in the colleges where I
did my B.E. and M.E., but it seems things have improved, though only
slightly), but Theory of Computation alone is not Computer Science. It is
just the tip of the iceberg. Theory of Computation itself needs to be
imparted as a two-semester course as there is too much material that cannot
be covered in one semester. But that, as far as I know, is not the case.
Then there are other courses such as Logic, Algebraic Automata theory,
Complexity theory, Programming Language Concepts(stuff such as explaining
the roots of programming languages, the different paradigms and formalisms
that govern the architecture of various programming languages) that form
what is generally known as Computer Science.

Learning Computer Engineering without learning Computer Science is like
learning, say, Mechanical Engineering without knowing/understanding Newton's
laws of motion. I have seen students struggle through subjects such as
Compiler Design since they had no idea of the essence behind formalisms such
as Regular languages, Context-free languages etc, as a consequence of which
Compiler Design has come to be considered as a very tough subject. Of
course, I am not saying that Compiler Design is very easy to learn, but it
can be made easier than it is now by making the students aware of the
theoretical concepts behind the subject first. Algorithms is another example
where Complexity theory is a pre-requisite. Logic is a pre-requisite for
Artificial Intelligence. And learning any programming language is incomplete
without a knowledge of the concepts behind it.

While, as Shakthi Kannan said, syllabus is only a guideline, syllabus should
also play a part in making computer science and engineering students aware
of the various branches of Computer Science and the truth that Computer
Science and Engineering is not all about programming design/implementation
and software engineering, but that a whole lot of scientific principles go
into it needs to be conveyed to all Computer Science and Engineering
students in an effective manner.

Vinod.

You might run into a problem if you hit the limit for the number of files.
ext4 I think will help you with this.

Suggest the 'Dragon Book" for a good read.

I would suggest you to look the Python source code and look at the bytecode
and AST optimizations. It is a good and quick way to learn some nifty stuff.
Do peep into the Unladen source stream and see how they do things at
LVM/LLVM. And if Python interests you, then get onto #python (IRC Channel) -
there are some amazing guys hanging around there.

I started something similar earlier this year and was flabbergasted with the
amount of learning to do and innovation that could happen. Speaking with
some great folks in #python was in itself amazing, though i never did any
code commits; but the experience in itself was amazing.

Dont let the interest die down!

(Note: this mail is in reply to Vinod Parthasarathy's which is below, but I've changed the subject line to be more relevant)

For ur kind information Vinod,

When I studied BE (CSE) at College of Engg. Guindy, Anna Univ main campus Chennai,

I did following core subjects in my BE:

1) Principles of Programming Languages (i dont know how many colleges has this paper today).
2) Design of Algorithms.
3) Theory of Computation.
4) Operating Systems
5) Compiler Design
6) Graph Theory (i dont know whether this paper is also present today)

Apart from core papers I had opportunity to do the following thro electives:

1) Advanced Operating System - Unix internals case study (this is where I formally entered into UNIX / LINUX world)
2) Distributed Systems
3) OOAD (followed the text book of Grady Booch)
4) Reconfigurable Computing - VHDL programming & Xilinx architectures.

I think the above papers cane be decently learnt in 4 years of course duration.

Apart from all the above I put emphasis on the following aspects:

1) Almost all engg disciplines are taught "Engineering Maths" paper till 5th semester. So, I think that is prettly much enough to grab & understand any higher or complex concepts. That is the reason they teach Maths.

2) Having choice based credit system to do whatever u would like to learn. This is really usefull for subjects which cannot be brought under regular stream of 4 yrs. My college had such a system & we had opportunity to use it.
I did total of 12 electives against the university stipulated minimum of 8 electives. 

In a real choice based credit system no one will Q'n u if u go & do a paper in mech disciplin or even leather technology as long as it interests u & relevant to u.

My view point is syllabus framers have done their best to make it robust.
So, if atleast the framed syllabus is delivered to the student at its best (here i mention the role of faculty & their efficacy), then thats fine.

Thanks,
Selvakumar.

Hi,

I joined the ILUGC mailing list recently. This is my first email to ILUGC.

Since we are on the topic of syllabus, let me mention one important point
that I have not seen mentioned so far in engineering circles.

I have seen the syllabus of many engineering colleges that come under Anna
University, and in all of them, I see that Computer Science subjects are not
included in the syllabus. In other words, engineering colleges don't teach
Computer Science and Engineering, as they claim to, but only teach Computer
Engineering. While in other engineering disciplines, as far as I am aware,
the basic science needed is taught, starting from schools, the same is sadly
not the case in Computer Science.

Of course, the subject, theory of computation alone is being included as one
of the subjects taught in B.E(this was not the case in the colleges where I
did my B.E. and M.E., but it seems things have improved, though only
slightly), but Theory of Computation alone is not Computer Science. It is
just the tip of the iceberg. Theory of Computation itself needs to be
imparted as a two-semester course as there is too much material that cannot
be covered in one semester. But that, as far as I know, is not the case.
Then there are other courses such as Logic, Algebraic Automata theory,
Complexity theory, Programming Language Concepts(stuff such as explaining
the roots of programming languages, the different paradigms and formalisms
that govern the architecture of various programming languages) that form
what is generally known as Computer Science.

Learning Computer Engineering without learning Computer Science is like
learning, say, Mechanical Engineering without knowing/understanding Newton's
laws of motion. I have seen students struggle through subjects such as
Compiler Design since they had no idea of the essence behind formalisms such
as Regular languages, Context-free languages etc, as a consequence of which
Compiler Design has come to be considered as a very tough subject. Of
course, I am not saying that Compiler Design is very easy to learn, but it
can be made easier than it is now by making the students aware of the
theoretical concepts behind the subject first. Algorithms is another example
where Complexity theory is a pre-requisite. Logic is a pre-requisite for
Artificial Intelligence. And learning any programming language is incomplete
without a knowledge of the concepts behind it.

While, as Shakthi Kannan said, syllabus is only a guideline, syllabus should
also play a part in making computer science and engineering students aware
of the various branches of Computer Science and the truth that Computer
Science and Engineering is not all about programming design/implementation
and software engineering, but that a whole lot of scientific principles go
into it needs to be conveyed to all Computer Science and Engineering
students in an effective manner.

Vinod.

These subjects are indeed good in nature,because they teach *principles*.

No, Its not included in syllabus today!

In most colleges students are not allowed to choose the electives :(

>My view point is syllabus framers have done their best to make it robust.


Anna university syllabus says something like for word processing "use
MS-office or equivalent", they should not recommend a *product* in syllabus!
Also there is a subject called visual programming (you studied it?) which
mandates the student/institution to use a proprietary operating system
called Microsoft windows and a Integrated development environment (IDE)
called visual studio. The syllabus should be vendor neutral. Otherwise its a
good syllabus :).

Yeah a friend of mine got that too. A worm called martuz.cn (a gumblar
family worm)

It infects the site through compromised ftp credentials (Which comes in
through a malformed pdf. So disable javascript in adobe reader). Clean the
computer from which you upload your files - both sophos security suite and
kaspersky internet security do a very good job at this. Once you are sure
that your uploading computer is clean, change the ftp password.

Also, if the site is infected, this
script<http://blog.unmaskparasites.com/2009/05/07/gumblar-cn-exploit-12-facts-about-this-injected-script/comment-page-1/#comment-896>will
automatically disinfect the pages. I think that thread also contains
lots of useful comments on how to automatically detect infection.

Whats the program you are trying to run. Please take this post to the
gnusim8085 user list in CC. If I can have the program you are tryin
got run, I can help you figure out.

Very simple. There is no need to use any function. You can use dot(.) operator 
to append more characters to a word like below:

$old="aish";
$new=$old."warya";
echo $new; // It will display "aishwarya"

Hi Selvakumar,
First of all, thank you for discussing this issue.

As you have listed, you have done Principles of Programming Languages and
Theory of Computation courses(two of the computer science core courses I had
mentioned) . Graph Theory, probably as Arun says, is not in the CEG syllabus
today. But anyway, Graph theory, though relevant in connection to some other
courses like Networks, cannot be considered a core computer science theory
subject, and I was not talking about it. I am only talking about core
courses when I say "computer science courses", so I think we can safely
ignore electives and system courses in this discussion for now. I will
anyway mention electives below, and comment on a very relevant point that
you have mentioned in relation to this.

I also did a Principles of Programming Languages course in B.E, so I want to
ask you something: In your "Principles of Programming Languages" course,
what all topics did you learn? I am asking this because the name of the
course can be sometimes misleading.

The point I am trying to make is that in the Principles of Programming
Languages course that I did, I did not learn much of the theoretical
concepts underlying programming, and I saw the same kind of syllabus in many
engineering college syllabus listings. For instance, I was not made aware of
the theory behind object-oriented and functional programming and lambda
calculus. I was simply taught Java! And a similar kind of syllabus seems to
be the case in most colleges.

And I don't see Complexity theory among your list of courses. That is a
pre-requisite for Design of Algorithms, which you have done. What about
Logic? Logic is a very important core subject and by that, I don't mean the
"logic" that is taught as part of the Discrete Mathematics course. And
speaking of Discrete Mathematics, there is a topic called recursion that
comes in it, and it is the most inappropriate place to have that topic.
Recursion(not the recursion used in programming) is only understandable
through learning Logic.

I never said Engineering Maths was not taught in colleges, but in any case,
Engineering mathematics does not play any role in learning the subjects that
I am talking about. If anything, Discrete Mathematics is more relevant.

And as Arun says, most engineering colleges don't even have the concept of
electives, and, if at all they offer electives, very few subjects will be
offered. And definitely advanced theory courses such as Automata and
Concurrency, Algebraic automata theory, Advanced Complexity theory are not
at all offered, even in CEG.

How can the framed syllabus, with all these gaping holes, even with very
good teachers, prove useful for teaching subjects non-existent in it? The
role of faculty is indeed important. A good syllabus with a bad faculty is
of no use. From what I have seen and experienced, I wouldn't say that the
faculty teaching theory in engineering colleges does a good job, which is
why Theory of Computation, though it is in the syllabus, is not being
effectively imparted to students in many colleges. But then, same is the
case with an incomplete syllabus and good teachers. With a complete
syllabus, at least students will be aware that such a subject exists!

All I am stressing is that in the current syllabus in Anna
University-controlled engineering colleges, computer science is not given
the importance it requires and any engineer who does not know the science
underlying his field of expertise is, strictly speaking, not a true
engineer. After all, isn't engineering an application of known scientific
principles?

Vinod.

I hope these thread is no way related to Free/Open Source Software.

This is not a place to critic about a University or a College or its
syllabus or curriculum. Do correct me if I am wrong.

It is related to free/open source software, though rather indirect. Lack of
theoretical knowledge has led to lack of knowledge in some programming
languages like Haskell in certain groups of people working in FOSS, who also
are in the ILUGC mailing list. Haskell is a FOSS software. One of my
intentions was to create awareness for such software which are closely tied
to core computer science theory.

And this thread is a continuation of a previous thread in which the talk
about the syllabus came And even in that thread, some critics about HODs, a
particular college, and Anna University came. I didn't see any objection
being raised in that thread, so I continued the topic.

you could use string concatenation operator . (dot) instead of function.

syntax :
$string = $string_1 . $string_2;

short hand notation
$word .= $character;

note : use php.net for function reference and php command line interface for
testing code snippet.

you are wrong. A proper understanding of the concept of syllabus and the 
existing structure is the foundation on which a true open source syllabus and 
structure can be built - world domination is our goal and we cannot achieve 
this without understanding the current world and how it is to be rebuilt.

I am talking about the problem I see in CS engineering. But, if you are
referring to the following statement alone

"After all, isn't engineering an application of known scientific
principles?"

then yes, I was speaking in general about engineering here, but only to
stress that science is important in engineering, and hence in CS
engineering, which I don't see happening.

Vinod.

we cannot expect faculties to spoon feed a student. Its the student's
responsibility to learn by himself. Most Engineering students expect spoon
feeding; Its a bad habbit. Finally they blame it on faculty :P

It is a vicious cycle, and that is why one of the major role of user
groups like ours is to make people "aware", and share our knowledge.

Hello ILUG-C Folks,

I am shifting to Chandigarh for the next two years to teach at IISER,
Mohali. So you probably won't be seeing me at the meetings for a
while. I will still lurk around on this list.

Being part of ILUG-C activities and discussions has been fun for the
last few years --- it is unfortunate for me that I joined in so late.

Regards,

Kapil.

I hadn't heard of the IISERs ... the wiki article [1] was quite
interesting.  All the best at the new place.

While a faculty is definitely not to be expected to spoon-feed students, it
is the duty of a faculty to introduce important concepts to the students and
act as guides. If the student has to learn everything by himslf/herself from
scratch, then why does one have colleges? The student might as well stay at
home and learn by himself/herself. Especially, in the case of theoretical
concepts, the student needs good guidance and motivation from teachers. A
teacher has the capacity to make a student love/hate a subject, so the role
of a faculty cannot be taken lightly.

Yes, user groups can create awareness, which is why I started discussing
this topic here. But to motivate a student towards theory, one has to start
at the initial stages of his entry into engineering, and I don't know how
much of a reach user groups will have to those students. Hope this topic
discussion has some impact in that direction.

Dont think, i am discouraging you..  This doubt is very elementary, and you
could have referred PHP resource sites, before asking in this group.  almost
all php books have a section on string operations.

Use df command to check your disk use. It should be something like
/dev/sda1                       7535228   7535228   0  100% /

The 100% means that your disk is full. If so, you will need to delete
files that you don't need anymore.

One point that is worth noting is that Indian academic institutes and
banks in the late 80's and early 90's got their systems from Indian
software organisations which specialised in Unix.

An interesting thesis topic for a sociologist is how this "Unix
country" became a "MicroSoft country" in the late 90's and the early
21st century.

At least part of the reason was that these organisations looked upon
Linux and GNU as "toys" for "hobbyists"---not for professionals. They
failed to recognise that Unix itself had similar roots.

Kapil.

Hi ,
        We already have some thing very similar to your idea.

http://www.funnymonkey.com/drupaled-latest

Its an example exercise in the book titled.

http://www.packtpub.com/drupal-for-education-and-e-learning/book

I did similar one for Audio based learning, with just 5 modules downloaded
to make it work my way.
It can be done in a matter of hours once u get the right modules.

I'd written a mail on this earlier in a thread where NASSCOM rejecting
FOSS standards was discussed. I see the reasons as being less
sociological than pragmatic. My views are as under:

1. The '80s were the era of the servers and '90s that of the desktop.
Clearly MS won on the desktop front thro' OEM support and programmes
while Linux and other software vendors had virtually none.
2. In the '80s, Unix was recommended not because of any love for Unix/
hatred for MS, but because it was the most viable hardware independent
multi-user OS then. In a similar vein, MS Windows di turn out to be
the most viable option as other OSes were tied to Hardware e.g Apple.
3.  Smart marketing by MS by giving grants, freebies apart from some
nice looking software and luring the powers that be.

Notwithstanding all this, our policy makers were blind sighted enough
not to see the power of their decision making in creating a change or
learning from history. They were/are not paid to do so I guess. If
only the Indian Govt had adopted FOSS explicitly earlier, we could've
saved millions in software costs as a country and also become a major
player influencing software trends. It is still not too late.

The reasons you have given are reasonable for:
 (a) Organisations/people who were newbies in the 90's
 (b) Business organisations/people (who _must_ follow the market).

This still does not explain why the organisations that had competence
in Unix allowed this competence to lapse (for example, by "forgetting"
to pass it on to the younger generation). Moreover, it looks like
academic organisations are following business trends rather than
leading businesses to future trends.

It will indeed be discouraging to comment like this, without knowing

It would be applicable for a school kid in Chennai, than an Engineering

Newbies or not, the world was moving towards a GUI based OS and Unix
fell woefully short there apart from not having desktop packages
(WYSIWYG). Unix remained a server operating system. It did have some
good GUI roots in Workstations. However, these were again tied to
hardware and developed by companies like Apollo and Sun. These not
being free of hardware was a distinct block to adoption wholesale. IBM
had thrown open hardware and PC compatibles market flourished. No Unix
on any one of them as the HW/SW markets were separated and
commoditised. At one level, this commoditisation did save costs as
compared to erstwhile proprietary systems.

Again, like I said earlier, this does not mean India could not have
spawned a whole new Unix based desktop generation. Could've done so
eminently. India did not believe in itself enough. We were content to
follow than to lead.

Academia is not to blame. It is again the policymakers. One good
example is the syllabus specification that has been discussed. Another
good example is NIC. In the 80s, this body adopted Xenix (MS's early
roots in Govt) for its deployments with an accent on smaller 4/5
terminal PC based hardware. If it had chosen Unix and specified PCs as
the hardware platform, industry would've risen to the occasion like
they did in 1985.

There is a group called plugdev in /etc/group. Members of this group
are normally given permission to auto mount plugged in devices.

If intention is to avoid usb pendrive/ other plugindevices, easiest is
to remove the users from this  group. This is in Debian. For others it
may be similar.

For still more strict environment hald and dbus daemons can be disabled.

 Has anyone thought of a project for  Digital signage using Linux.
Most of the stuff I see are windows based  even the hosted ones. There seems
to be a scope for Linux based digital signage server.
The commercial ones  all seem to be closed source .

A few things that happened in the 80s and the 90s that have contributed to
the current state:

1. Good UNIX programmers have always been far more expensive to recruit,
train and keep.

2. Oracle forms 4 came out and there was a shift away from terminals to
desktop environment. Simultaneously GUI tools such as Visual Basic became
very popular. For C++ development, companies preferred Visual C++.

This was the point when our students went from being command line warriors
to mouse clickers. There was no longer a need to be competent in UNIX -
one could easily land a job in VB/VC etc.

So the number of UNIX programmers dropped heavily. This made the situation
mentioned in point 1 even more acute.

3. The specialist UNIX platforms such as SGI Irix, HP UX, SCO etc all met
their demise when the UNIX workstations started getting replaced by
Intergraph or other workstations running Windows NT 3.5/4. It was now
possible to setup entire render farms, do computer aided design and also
do scientific computing calculations without leaving the GUI. Most UNIX
application vendors ported their apps over to work on Windows NT around
this time. So the market for UNIX programmers dropped yet again.

As a result of this, the domain that UNIX occupied was restricted to
verticals such as telecom (where it is still pretty dominant), niche
scientific computing, mainframes (for very large corps) etc.

It is now over the past few years that UNIX (or rather Linux) is seeing a
resurgence primarily because of the cost advantages of Linux. But I am
very doubtful that UNIX would reach the heights that it reached during the
1970s and the early 80s.

NASSCOM's board has people from non-programming and non-computer
engineering backgrounds. Even those who are from computer backgrounds
probably cut their teeth on MS software and not on UNIX. Many of them
probably still have the image of UNIX as blinking green terminals.

Therefore I am not surprised that they have a low opinion of UNIX/Linux
and are pushing MS's case... with some encouragement from MS (of course).

Thanks,
Prem

Subject: Facebook Developers Contest
Hey Akarsh,

A friend of mine, Soumya from BITS Pilani, is promoting the Facebook
Developer contest.
I thought you might be interested. Also, it would be great if you could help
publicise the contest in IIT-Madras by putting up a notice on your LAN and
forwarding this mail to people there who might be interested.

http://www.facebook.com/campaign/landing.php?campaign_id=102409362098


Facebook announces the first ever Facebook Developer Contest ? India!

While there are developers all over the world who would love to participate
in the contest, this is a special one for those who are residents of India.
There are two categories in the contest ? Facebook Apps and Facebook Connect
Integrations.

 Submit your entry anytime from now to *Sep 11th 2009*.

 There are three cash prizes;* $4000 for the first place, $2000 for the
second place and $1000 for the third*, in each of the two categories.

The contest is located at
http://www.facebook.com/campaign/landing.php?campaign_id=102409362098


To enter the contest, participants are required to create a Facebook
platform application for use on the Facebook site or Facebook Connect
integrations in English or Hindi and register their application in the
contest?s homepage. The contest is open to Indian residents over the age of
16 with a facebook.com account.

Facebook Connect enables people to combine their Facebook experiences with
any participating Website, desktop application or mobile device.  When
websites incorporate Facebook Connect, Facebook?s more than 200 million
active users around the globe can automatically import profile information
and bypass the need to build a friends? list from scratch. More than 10000
websites have incorporated Facebook Connect since its general availability
in December 2008.


Cheers

Siddharth

It will indeed be discouraging to comment like this, without knowing

It would be applicable for a school kid in Chennai, than an Engineering

   Unix actually came to PCs fairly early, courtesy M$. They
licensed and resold Xenix for PC/XTs and ATs almost from the
beginning of the PC era, i.e. early 80s. After the 386 and
486 showed up, most Xenix users switched to SCO Unix
(System V). However, very few of these installations were
desktop installations running X - for that, you had to go with
proprietary HW/SW platforms like SGI Iris/Irix, Sun, Apollo,
HP-UX, IBM RS/6000/AIX, which were expensive.

  The domestic UNIX vendors (HCL, DCM, Wipro, SunRay,
OMC, etc.) remained content with time-shared text-mode
CLIs on serial terminals (VT100 clones).

  Godrej attempted a very ambitious desktop workstation
running X on Unix for CAD/CAM applications, called the
Symphony. It was a brilliant technical success, but did
not succeed in the marketplace due to the usual reasons
(lack of apps, etc.). Wipro also had a similar project that
met the same fate in the late 80s.

There were good attempts, but the market was not ready for it.
There was also a huge disaster in the form of CDAC, which
sucked in a lot of system designers and programmers into
building useless message-passing Transputer-based systems,
when that competence should have been used for building an
x86 SMP machine with maybe a BSD 4.2/3 port - which would
have helped to develop Unix-internals competence.

There were people with Unix competence in India, but there
wasn't a huge market for Unix Workstations. However, a Govt.-
funded project like C-DAC could just have addressed the
HPC Unix market with an SMP 486 box, and later continued
to ride the coat-tails of Intel (this is what Sequent did, and
eventually they were acquired by IBM).

They had no control over this - an entire generation of
experienced systems people (both HW and SW) moved
to the US in the late 80s and early 90s. C-DAC made it
worse by attracting talented freshers, but put them on
a dead-end technology project where nothing worthwhile
was developed.

was sound . There were local vendors (HCL, DCM, etc.) that offered
System V on x86 - but they were servers as discussed earlier.

Dear Luggies,

Jaya FOSS Club (www.jayafossclub.org) also planned to celebrate SFD on 19th
sep, 2009 in a grand manner. we have already started our preparation for
this event. Details of events will be uploaded very soon in JFC site.

We request ILUGC support for this too. Without ILUGC support we never did
any event. This time also we are expecting the same.

Also we would like to participate the SFD event to be held at birla
palntitorium. Its not a problem for us to have the event in both places. We
wanted to take up the stalls, if its more than two also we are ready to take
up. Please give us the topics, so that we will start preparing for the demo.


with regards,

   Hi friends,

   I read a article that Oracle Snatches Sun, Foiling IBM
   (http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124022726514434703.html) and  I don't
   think that anyone can own an open source project.

   If the company loses the trust of these people, they can go away with the
   project and turn it the way they want to.

   After Oracle bought sun, what will be changed in MySQL?

   Monty mentioned about the following plans in his blog
   http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2009/04/to-be-free-or-not-to-be-free.html

   what will be the strengthen other opensource DBMS such as PostgreSQL,
   MariaDB and Drizzle?

   What about your opinions?

A man of my times, I see. Sunray and Godrej  were the giveaway. Not
many know Sunray nowadays. They had some decent workstations albeit
high priced with almost no software. Mosr GUI based vendors were
locked to proprietary hardware instead of adopting PC hardware. We are
echoing the same thing here. The market or policy did not push these
vendors to bring out low cost Unix based desktops.

This where we differ in viewpoints. I'm not debating the soundness of
the decision. It was a failsafe option but not path breaking.

A body like NIC could've pushed industry for Unix on the low cost
desktop server with a Multi IO card - the market that Xenix and later
SCO Unix targetted. We had some good software from companies like
Vishesh for office use. This route was not taken. NIC was developing
its own software and did not need these office packages in any case.
However, it could've played its part in pushing industry. In my
opinion, this was an inflexion point which could've been seized..

It was also the time of liberalisation Rajiv Gandhi era and winds did
blow in the direction of import rather than develop across many
industries. I'd like to draw the example of the Auto industry here. It
went the same way and all design was shelved for about 4 years from
1991-95. The industry used this to leapfrog generations and then went
back to design from a higher threshold. This did not happen in the
software world then. We had leapfrogged with Unix adoption. I believe
we should've persisted and built around it.

Is it wrong to have such a policy to prevent data theft?  USB pen drives 
with small size and data caps. of 16GB and upwards is the easiest way 
to copy data.

  One other issue is that decent megapixel-quality displays did
not show up in the commodity PC market until the mid-90s.
There were specialty add-on card manufacturers like Matrox,
Number Nine, etc. in the 80s, but they were mainly addressing
the high-end CAD/CAM market with cards priced at $10k and
up, not the commodity desktop market.

  The commodity desktop market had only EGA and VGA
cards at 640x480, and even the latter did not show up in
quantity until the early '90s.

 Even if somebody had attempted a X/Unix port to x86 PCs
in the mid/late '80s, there wasn't suitable commodity hardware
to target it at. In any event, Linus and friends succeeded
magnificently in doing exactly this in the early '90s -
X/Linux on a 486 blew away almost all the proprietary
desktop Unix workstations away by 1994/95, and the game
was over for the likes of Apollo, Intergraph, SGI, Sun, etc.
(though some of them survived by moving back into
servers, ironically).

  Prior to 1985 (when the PC/AT was introduced) this was not really
feasible. Sure, you could put a multi I/O card on a PC/XT (8-bit
bus) and hook up 3-4 terminals on COM1: to COM4:. But with 640k
of RAM, no MMU, no Virtual Memory and CLI-only apps, it was fairly
limited. The only multitasking OSes that could even work here
were CCPM and maybe early versions of Xenix. Maybe also a
System 7 derivative from IBM called PC/IX (which was in no
way comparable to AIX which showed up later on the RT/PC).

  I even tried this in 1986 with the PC/AT at 6 MHz and 1.5 Mbytes
of RAM, equipped with a multi-IO card. Oddly enough, I liked
QNX (an RTOS) and CCPM better than Xenix (which came on
20+ floppies, CDROM drives only showed up in the late 80s.)
on a i286.

  A 3/4 BSD port to the i286 was not really feasible because
of its limited MMU. Nevertheless, several people attempted
it - Mark William's Coherent, etc.

  After the i386 CPU was released in 1985/6, there was a
version of SunOS that ran on a 386 - the Sun 386i, a
proprietary x86 box. But shortly thereafter, SCO System V
showed up for commodity i386 boxes, and the Indian
UNIX market generally adopted it.

option. Many of the CLI apps originally written for text-
mode UNIX ported easily to DOS, and DOS was bulletproof
even on entry-level HW. That's what finally killed Unix
in India - DOS was good enough, at a fraction of the cost.
Those DOS apps continued to work fine in a DOS window
on Win95, so there was no incentive to switch back to
UNIX.

Anyway, the wheel has turned a full circle now, and Linux
is getting significant traction.

Hello friends,
I wanted to create a self signed certificate using open ssl. Googling, 
and reading the documentations i managed to do that.
The following is the command i used. I have skiped the steps that i used 
to create private key and CA.

$openssl ca -policy policy_anything -config ./openssl.cnf -cert 
certs/ca.cer -in ./requests/certreq1.txt -keyfile ./keys/ca.key -days 
360 -out ./certs/iis1.cer

After creating the certificate, i found its not SSLv3. How do i force 
the above command to create a certificate SSLv3. ?

If your "openssl.cnf" is the standard configuration file that comes
with openssl then using "-extensions v3" as an additional option
should be enough.

demo site does not open for me. As mentioned I am fed up being laughed at by 
people when I say we do not have a site, so have put this one forward. It is 
up to LUG members if they want to update/use it. Anyway, there is no such 
thing as too much publicity - so no harm in having several sites.

This site seems to have a little more information than the previous
one.

Since ILUG-C is not a commercial organisation I would prefer that the
www.ilugc.com contains a permanent redirect to one of the other
sites. A .net site should really be a network service site which
ILUG-C is not so I think that should be a permanent redirect too.

I don't know about others but I would also prefer a .in registration
for the "default" home page.

All the same ILUG-C is an organisation of sorts so a .org domain is
probably OK as well.

People, please co-ordinate and enable co-operative management of
these sites rather than a proliferation of web sites!

Regards,

Kapil.

if you can enable it yourself just fork the project and roll your
version, later we can merge all together.

Well, since then, I've had an idea about how to avoid depending on a 
server completely - Kenneth, why don't you move your code to a Google 
AppEngine instance? I'm guessing yours is Django code and AppEngine does 
support it. I think the free bandwidth limits set by Google are more 
than enough for us. That way, a few more people apart from you can 
contribute to/deploy it. I'll redirect all 4 domains in my control over 
to the instance.

In the unlikely event that we do cross those limits, we can either pay 
for the instance or move it over to a dedicated server.

Vamsee.

Yesterday I had addressed a group of 2nd and 3rd year CSE students at SRM. I
enquired about this event -- as expected there was not much knowledge.

Can Dinesh and Bharathi Subramanian work out what could be done? We could
provide training/guidance from ILUG-C, and Bharathi & I could see what could
be done from NRCFOSS end. Since I also had a brief meeting with their Asst
Director and some of the HoDs, I could alert them as well.

Friends.

A 250 GB external hard disk is becoming read only when connected.

It has NTFS file system.

I tried remounting, and manual mount.

No use.

I dont want to reformat it again.

It is working well in windows boxes.

Any help?

You might want to check out the /etc/fstab file and see what options are set
for your external media mount point (/media or /usbdisk etc.)? It might have
specified ro as one of the options.

Also check the access permissions of that mount point of whether read only
permission alone is there for that mount point.

When you said remounting, did you try to specifically give rw in the options
for mount? If not, you can try this to set explicitly.

Hope this helps,

Vasan

There is unlikely to be any clarity on the issue unless people set aside 
their egos and start working together on this one. I suggest the 
discussion become an item in the next meeting, so that it can be decided 
once and for all. I'm surprised that it didn't already happen.

I guess people can develop their own versions until then, and finally 
agree to redirect to whichever is voted the best of the lot :). I'm 
unlikely to have free time during this month, so I'll vote for whichever 
version is most open and redirect the domains according to the final 
decision of the lug.

Vamsee.

actually there was no option v3, but using the option -extentions v3_ca 
doesnt give any result. Actually my problem is using the above command 
it creates a certificate by default with the cipher RC4-MD5, but i want 
to force it to use use some high security ciphers like DES-CBC3-SHA or 
any SSLv3. Iam still trying...

Dear All,

One of my known friends is the administrator in a company.

He has got close to 6 servers (all HP ML350) all running Windows 20003 with
MSSQL 2005/2008. He is taking backup in a rudimentary way. His total backup
size would be around 100GB and is increasing by 20% per year.

He doesnot have a tape drive and he wants to install it in ML350.

I have asked him to use one of the servers as a Backup Server and suggested
Backup Server like OpenFiler and he asked me to help in installing the whole
thing. I am pretty confident of Openfiler but would like to know Backup
Software which is open source / Free software


He was ready to give one HP ML350 Server for this purpose which is having
5*73GB SCSI HDDs with RAID5 also.

Now, I would like to know

1. What is the best partition layout for Openfiler?

2. Which backup software will be suitable for taking backup periodically
(MSSQL) ? Preferably Open Source/Free Software capable of Volume Shadow copy
Service. I have checked Zmanda but Amanda Enterprise is capable of taking
open files backup but it is costly. Correct me if I am wrong. Also
preferable if the software is capable of Data Deduplication.

3. How to take the backup from 5 Servers to Openfiler and Tape Drive?

4. How to take the backup from the servers to Openfiler and also to the
tape?

5. I have gone thro' the Openfiler forums and openfiler will accept a tape
drive but what will be the best policy of taking the backup from Disks--->
disk ----> Tape
 to install the tape drive in the Openfiler or on one of the other servers?

6. Virtualization is ruled out.

Please let me know the solution for this. I have posted this to Openfiler
forums also but thought of knowing if any other alternatives are available
from you all.

Regards

actually, for the time being bandwidth is not a constraint - the site is 
deployed on a server with 8 GB RAM, 1500 GB space and unlimited bandwidth. But 
a port to appengine sounds good when appengine and django trunk support each 
other. There is no big deal deploying the site as it needs very few features 
and is unlikely to change frequently. Most of the content is addable by any 
logged in user. We just need someone to do the tamil translation and I think 
the complete wishlist will be fulfilled. Oh, possibly some design wizard can 
brighten up the looks

it was discussed at the meeting - that is why I put up the site. As far as I 
am concerned, this is not going to lead to a split in the group as none of us 
are interested in grabbing control through the site. All we need is a space 
for announcement of meetings, events and CDs available - and reports on the 
events. And we need this *now*. And we need Tamil. All this is now available. 
The only new request is for openid which will be available today (famous last 
words).

Try ntfsfix on this partition. When the ntfs file system requires a file system check, linux mounts then readonly. Alternatively you can check the partition in windows box itself.

I am not a total moron - of course SASL is not missing. I have been doing this 
install hundreds of times since circa 1996, and last did it on lenny a few 
months back. I finally copied a dovecot.conf file from my previous lenny install 
and it worked. A diff of the the two files shows

path = /var/run/dovecot/auth-master in socket listen client in my new install 
whereas it should be
path = /var/spool/postfix/private/auth

it works ok now

That's good to know.

Actually, using Google's django stack is entirely optional - you can 
check in a django release of your choice along with your app and use it. 
But I think a local server with 4G ram is a good thing, so I guess we 
can keep AE as a backup option if we ever have to move out of that machine.

I'll take a look at it a few weeks later - I'm no design wiz, but I've 
been picking up some css skills whenever the designer I work with goes 
awol :). Btw, I also like it that you chose bitbucket - I'm coming to 
see hg as git without all the drama :D.

1. Typo : s/previous/precious/
2. Sensitive data is always a few lines long; and mostly contains a dozen
words.
3. Human mind can remember the one in #2.
4. If not #3, then almost all mobiles have cameras these days.
5. To stop #4, prohibit mobiles in those work places. (Apparently, i worked
for such a firm which was planning such a move :P ; the sysads first
disabled the USBs etc and then suggested this move)

Summary : value the human mind. Each blockage to secure the data is just a
stage in a _chakravyuha_; but _abhimanyu_ is defnitely going to crack it.

More bahs/mehs? :P

Good. 
Few suggestions

Mailing list menu: Give an explicit join option
Meeting location : Remove unused venues. 
Members:  We don't have any formal members list or their details.
 Better  omit it, until some way is found to get it.
FOSS Jobs: Same as above  - until some method is deviced for posting
remove the links.

sure. i have disabled it for time being.

reason for member list is:
1. from outside, ilugc is known as a group of linux users. if they want to
seek help from some body based on expertise level, they can contact the
members directly.
2. also some ilugc members can expose their talent and their by gets
freelancing opportunities.

I just clicked the link below in your mail (attached below).

Its not working. THe message comes like the page is currently unavailable.

Also iam confused with different ilugc website names that i see in the recent postings.

Definitely any user will get annoyed to look into 'n' number of websites for the same matter.

So, pls sort out first which is the one stop source for ilugc website and that?that site works first.

Thanks,
Selvakumar.

If you want put such useful sites under links.

Also as KG pointed out date should be in Indian format.

Also next meeting box should be always available on front page. If meeting will be conducted as part of an event like forthcoming SFD an info may be given.

Subject: [Ilugc] Increasing tcp window size in linux.
Message-ID: <6625F37A-9657-4BEB-AC3D-BC98490F060A@gmx.net>


I am seeing small window size (using tcpdump) on linux machine which  
runs a http proxy server. The same application running on different  
machine on a different network shows a tcp window size 2 times bigger.

Is it possible to increase the tcp window size in linux or is this  
parameter set automatically based on the link speed.

Block devices allow us to retrieve data from the device in randomn.
Also, buffering of
data is done when data is being retrieved from block devices.

Character devices on the other hand, need not use buffering and we
might not necessarily
be able to retrieve data in randomn. Also data transfer function call
is blocking.

In the permission flags, block devices are identified as bxxxxxxxxx
while character
devices are identified as cxxxxxxxxx.

I had to deal with a similar issue about 4 years ago more for
affordable DR. Route that I took was:
1. Get a server with hot swap drive bays.
2. Get 18 drives. (300GB)
3. Use one drive per week for weekly backup, rotated every month.
4. One drive per month backup, rotated every year.
5. One drive always available as spare.

Ours' was a development environment and not a DB application. We
needed to backup code from 5 locations worldwide and this was resorted
to. I'd think going with (hot) swap drive is more robust as it is not
as quirky as tapes and allows faster access to small chunks as
compared to tapes. My view on tapes could be tainted by dated
experience. I've not tried recent technologies like Ultrium and the
likes.

This is first time , they were seen Linux GUI . And all of them are wonder
by seeing the GUI of Linux.


And again using PDF , Logesh and Raj kumar  were  discussed with those

and I explained many thing about Viruses and Security and Open Source
Languages , & Jobs .

What is the command line for above actions.


The kernel ntfs driver does not support write operation even with the rw 
option.

Install the ntfs-3g (or equivalent name for your distro) package and 
mount it so:

mount -o force -t ntfs-3g /dev/path /mnt/some_mnt_pt

If you are already using ntfs-3g and still experiencing problems then 
the disk should be removed with proper shutdown of the USB device.

When I had similar issues, the ntfs-3g force/repair never worked. I
had to connect the drive to a Windows machine and do a proper eject
before i could use it under Linux.

Have you tried bacula or amanda as the backup management software?

The media could be vtapes (essentially disk based backup).

I have tried this with good results in the past.

You might have to check up regarding MSSQL agent though. May be the
commercially supported Zmanda would provide that.

I did mean to say "under Windows" but failed to articulate it when I 
posted my response (12:38AM).

How about rsnapshot and rdiff-backup? rsnapshot is good for going back in
time with incremental backups. rdiff-backup is a lot more powerful and it
can deal with gigabytes of data easily. This could be mysql dumps and such.

rsnapshot is written in perl and rdiff-backup in python.

You can find a lot more backup URLs in my delicious page.

You seem to have missed "duplicity" which has some nice aspects:
 1. It uses cached metadata to decide what to backup.
 2. It saves things as compressed tar so that you do not run
    into file inode issues.
 3. You can encrypt backups. So backups to remote machines are safe.

The main drawback of duplicity is that the _first_ run (where it
builds the metadata tables) takes a long time. This is also the
drawback of the other rsync based systems.

Regards,

Kapil.

What is your wireless card model, see output of 'lspci' to know this.
Post the relevant parts of your 'dmesg' output here which will help
give a solution. What does 'ifconfig -a' says?

I too had similar issues in my Acer one. Do google. At the end stuffing
entries in modprobe solved it.

This is how mine looks.

You want 'genome' ie., http://genome.sourceforge.net/ or 'gnome' ie.,
http://www.gnome.org/ ?

	released
Message-ID: <9d0602eb0908130044j1b1044c7jc1bcf267dd30d4a@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings all,
  We are proud to announce the release of LDTP 1.7.0. This release features
number of important breakthroughs in LDTP as well as in the field of Test
Automation. This release note covers a brief introduction on LDTP followed
by the list of new features and major bug fixes which makes this new version
of LDTP the best of the breed. Useful references have been included at the
end of this article for those who wish to hack / use LDTP.

About LDTP:

Linux Desktop Testing Project is aimed at producing high quality test
automation framework (C / Python) and cutting-edge tools that can be used to
test Linux Desktop and improve it. It uses the Accessibility libraries to
poke through the application's user interface. The framework also has tools
to record test-cases based on user events in the interface of the
application which is under testing. We strive to help in building a quality
desktop.

LDTP NEWS

Mago project uses LDTP - http://mago.ubuntu.com
GLOM uses LDTP - http://git.gnome.org/cgit/glom/tree/ldtp/

Whats new in this release:

Get the window uptime, maximize, minimize, close, activate all or any given
window name are some of the noticable new APIs in this release. Generate key
event function now uses xmodmap to determine the current local keyboard and
generates the respective key codes.

Bug fixes:

590755 ? Keycodes mismatch using generatekeyevent from python-ldtp
586655 ? typo hasstate example with more one state separator '+' instead of
','
587614 ? Method to measure how long a window is showing up
588674 ? It would be nice if doesrowexist would look for partial matches
587456 ? checkrow action fails on tree table cell
583021 ? If an application changes a context, it is no longer found by LDTP
588819 ? 'import ldtp' freezes interpreter
589898 ? local variable 'gobject' referenced before assignment
586291 ? Subsequent tests fail when first one registers callback handlers
586657 ? Imporve user experience getallstates match for defined state
constants

How right you are?

This article throws more light.

http://www.bitflop.com/document/75

Actually I dismissed duplicity due to some important reason and stuck to
rdiff-backup. But I gave up on the project later. And this was a long time ago.

I don't think delay in building the first backup is a big issue. Any
installation
for that matter takes time. So it should be fine.

I did run into the restriction of rdiff-backup wanting the same version of
rdiff-backup at both ends.

What tool you choose depends on what you are looking for. Different
tools offer different solutions. And different compromises.

Simple question. To access a government service, why should I need to buy a
proprietary product. This is not possible in other government services. Say
for example,

   1. Only VISA card is allowed to buy items from ration shop.
   2. You can use only reliance mobile to make calls to government offices.


Does Public Interest Litigation solves the issue?

Your server argument points to '/var/lib/tftpboot' but the filename
given in dhcpd.conf points to '/tftpboot'. Both are conflicting

login as root but in my fedora i had tried two things howewer i can't
login as root.
that things are..
1) I changed that /etc/pam.d/gdm file by removing the line user ! =
root (Second line) and saved the file

2) While booting changed the password in console via adding 1  at the
end of the grub line (editing the grub) but till i can't login as

Ideally, you should never login as root. Whatever you need to do can be
accomplished far more safely by using su or sudo. Having said that,

Message-ID: <57804.117.193.45.26.1250314488.squirrel@117.193.45.26>

The bug involves the way kernel-level routines such as sock_sendpage
react when they are left unimplemented. Instead of linking to a
corresponding placeholder, (for ex, sock_no_accept), the function
pointer is left uninitialized. Sock_sendpage doesn't always validate
the pointer before dereferencing it, leaving the OS open to local
privilege escalation that can completely compromise the underlying
machine.

I am also of the opinion that a PIL would help but it would be a long 
drawn process with a lot of evidence collection to present to the 
courts such that the presiding  judge rules favor of open standards.  
Evidence collection and a good council - they cost money.  Who will 
foot the bill?

The problem is with the tender process.  To the best of my knowlege 
there is no requirement that the application must work to open 
standards.

There has been some movement in the DIT in the direction of using open 
standards but the draft text has enough "cope out" clauses for vendors 
to use as escape.

Depending on your setup, you may not be permitted to
change memory_limit from php code.  Try setting it in
your php.ini and restart your web server.

Note that the error message is consistent with your
setting!  256M is what you are setting your code, try
increasing memory_limit to higher values.

Once the setting is changed, check output of phpinfo()
to ensure the change is accepted.

Message-ID: <d16b1c80908150752r3d3d8e6fp78bb4560b50dd3a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Today, I visited IIIT, Hyderabad (Gachibowli) [1] and copied 50 GB of
Fedora Core (10, 11) repositories to their server for their use. I
have also given them Fedora 10, 11 DVDs.

IIIT, Hyderabad has totally 20 Mbps bandwidth from different ISPs.
Most of them use the Internet connection to install software. They are
planning to setup a public Fedora mirror.

Thanks to Gaganpreet Singh and Jinesh K J.

If anyone needs complete Fedora 10, 11 repository, please let me know.
For each release version, the complete repository size is 25 GB.

For long, i had this in my mind..  let me know if it interests you.

For any language, vocabulary indicates its richness.  because, words
represent virtually everything, whether its object, or an abstract thought,
or an emotional feeling.  So, richness in vocabulary means, refined
representation of ideas and objects.

Now coming to the core point, English had the vast set of vocabulary, which
is used for comparative analysis and also differential learning.  For
example, the meaning for discovery and invention is different in english
context, but its represented by the same word in tamil.

There are many technical words, which doesnt have an equivalent word in
tamil.  Which means, we could not represent those technical subjects
properly here.

The need of the hour is to create new words in tamil to represent the
developments, but at the same time, acceptable to the people.

For that, we can develop a collobarative platform, so that learned tamil
scholars, (also common people) across the globe, could suggest tamil words
for english words, and discuss about that.  When more people participate in
that, we have more number of choices of words, and as it matures, we can
choose a best fitting word for each english word.

I have few suggestions.

1. The requirement document for this project can be maintained in tamil
itself.  (an initiative for software development in tamil)

2. This can be developed as a long term project with wide participation, and
such a project can become wikipedia of tamil.. (for words)

3. If it clicks, we can get funding from tamilnadu government too :)

Advanced apology, if my idea is too silly.

I am also of the opinion that a PIL would help but it would be a long 
drawn process with a lot of evidence collection to present to the 
courts such that the presiding? judge rules favor of open standards.? 
Evidence collection and a good council - they cost money.? Who will 
foot the bill?

The problem is with the tender process.? To the best of my knowlege 
there is no requirement that the application must work to open 
standards.

There has been some movement in the DIT in the direction of using open 
standards but the draft text has enough "cope out" clauses for vendors 
to use as escape.

Depending on your setup, you may not be permitted to
change memory_limit from php code.? Try setting it in
your php.ini and restart your web server.

Note that the error message is consistent with your
setting!? 256M is what you are setting your code, try
increasing memory_limit to higher values.

Once the setting is changed, check output of phpinfo()
to ensure the change is accepted.

Way to go!

Debian = Debrah + Ian Mudock.

Iam Murdock is the creator and Debrah was his girlfriend who he married later.

Nice name. And a nice distribution too. I use it everyday for my work.

directory and copy libflash.so file to it and restart firefox - it works

Thanks for accepting my idea.  there is no such project, and if implemented,
it would be path breaking not only for tamil, but for all other languages..
We will have a unique open source project in the world. :)

I feel, this is a very practical project, conceptualised from real life
scenarios.

Most of the students in colleges do not know what to do in final year
projects, and they end up in some imaginary or impractical ideas in choosing
the projects.

I would suggest, that we could focus on real life scenarios, and identify
the problems existing there, which can be taken as a project by the academic
students.  We can list out such real life scenarios in our website, for
further discussion and adoption.

Such effor twould be a mutually beneficial both to the industry and to the
student community.

Senthil

Friends,
      After  installing and configuring subversion with mysql , when i start
apache it says

" httpd: Syntax error on line 55 of /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/apache2/modules/mod_dav_svn.so into server:
/usr/lib/libsvn_fs_base-1.so.0: undefined symbol: db_create "
By suffering internet to solve above error  , it seems that, i have to use
berkeley database.

So,while Berkeley database installation, while configure.below error thrown

./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apr/apxs
--with-db4=/usr/local/BerkeleyDb-4.3 --with-mm=/usr/lib/

configure: error: libmm required

but i have installed mm-1.1.3 is installed in /usr/lib

how to solve this error and install berkeley?.

Linux                  : CentOS5.0
berkeley version : db-4.7.25

Did you compiled subversion? If so can you post your ./configure
options along wit the versions of dependencies?

Why don't you use subversion from CentOS repositories with yum?

Not necessarily, the default is fsfs these days. You can ignore bdb
with '--without-berkeley-db' option in configure.

If you badly need bdb, then compile apr-util with bdb support and show
subversion the apr-util compiled with bdb, it will automatically get
bdb from apr-util.

Sounds like fun and VERY USEFUL. I am not sure whether i have stumbled on
VNC viewers for Linux .
Also, whether i can view Windows desktop from a VNC viewer in Linux?
Something like 'mstsc'  for working across windows-linux would also be neat.

Alternatively, you can also copy the sharedobject to
~/.mozilla/firefox/plugins/ if you want flash to be installed for only
the current user..

VNC has a protocol -- de facto, if not de jure -- so it should work
across OS-es.

Swamynathan, the folks at work[1] had released SimpleVNC[2] some time
last month, it has ports for Windows and MacOS X ... so you might want
to work on a Linux port.  Plus you don't have to start from scratch.

We use it in a IM product we're making, but it's GPL-ed so you can do
as you please with it.

Apparently you haven't read Senthil's post. I have Intel one in my system
and the modprobe entry corresponds to that. You have to create one which
corresponds to your hardware.

We can help you better if you post the output of 'lspci -v'.

Have you installed the iwl3945 firm-ware coz i also have the Intel ABG 3945
Card and i had to install the firmware in Lenny and then it worked out of
the box.

Try installing the firmware for iwl3945 and you should be done.

Thanks,

Way to go!

Debian = Debrah + Ian Mudock.

Iam Murdock is the creator and Debrah was his girlfriend who he married later.

Nice name. And a nice distribution too. I use it everyday for my work.

Subject: [Ilugc] Final year project
Message-ID: <404c076d0908171722v8a7fb1aoee487c301ab8ba50@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

One of my friend suggested me to do a language detector for
python.At present the language detector(langdet) in python is in bi-gram
mode and i have planned to do it in n-gram mode which will be more accurate
in its output. Also plan to have feature like : Support for 76 languages,
since n-gram accuracy of detection will be high, An interface that will
enable the application to be started in 'server' mode in addition to the
ability to be imported as a python-module and make it listen on any given
port will be developed. This gives the application the ability to serve
other programming languages also.

          Kindly give me your suggestion as i am doing this as my final year
project.

With Anticipation,

Santhosh V.Kumar

we dont need another collobarative platform than wikitionary. already people
from Free Tamil Computing list are describing words in

tamil wikitionary.

please check here
http://ta.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%B1%E0%AF%8D_%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D

Dear Bala,

I think you got me wrong. Can we update the pages pointing to
chennailug.org with the URL ilugc.in

By the way, Can I know if there are any more LUG in Chennai apart from
this group.

Regards,
Immanuel

I would like to register my appreciation of this service provided by
Baskar and LinuXpert Academy. It is a big advantage to have access to
FOSS repository at a phone call away.  Recently I had an opportunity
to make use of this service, when we needed CentOS DVD.

Additionally, I was in AVC College Mayiladuthurai yesterday (August
17, 2009). When I asked the faculty to organize a Linux Demo Day by
their students, they said Mr Baskar visited the college some time back
and introduced Linux options.

Baskar, a big thank you for your tireless efforts in promoting Linux
and open source in Tamil Nadu. To my knowledge you are one
entrepreneur who has taken this as your core business in this part of
world. (Saravanan of  Lynus Academy is another example).

Hats off, keep up the good work.

Best regards,

Ma Sivakumar

Message-ID: <2a58b7dc0908180353v730dd469ga2b43ecfa8abffb8@mail.gmail.com>

hi friends,



while trying to configure evolution mail client iam getting an error like



checking for GNOME_PLATFORM... configure: error: Package requirements
(glib-2.0 >= 2.18.0
         gtk+-2.0 >= 2.14.0

         libgnomeui-2.0 >= 2.0.0
         libxml-2.0 >= 2.0.0
         shared-mime-info >= 0.22) were not met:

Requested 'glib-2.0 >= 2.18.0' but version of GLib is 2.12.3
Requested 'gtk+-2.0 >= 2.14.0' but version of GTK+ is 2.10.4
Requested 'libbonobo-2.0 >= 2.20.3' but version of libbonobo is 2.16.0
Requested 'shared-mime-info >= 0.22' but version of shared-mime-info is 0.19

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables GNOME_PLATFORM_CFLAGS
and GNOME_PLATFORM_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.




i tried to set environment variable  'export
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH'

actually iam not able to find out whats is the error i was trying this
for past 1 week redhat el5server is the OS

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/evolution(version)



this is the command i used to run the script


hope friends will help me

You have to make entry in the /etc/fstab for mounting new partition automatically at boot time.  To manually mount use mount command like this

mount /dev/partitionname /mountdirectory

More info about devices will be useful to give proper guidance.

How much the space you have in hard disk?

what is the database you have?

where do you have the data directory for the database?

Give more information on your problem with numerical details.

Samba can do Windows NTLMSSP authentication. Run Samba as a server.
All Windows users can connect.

Not true. Samba can do it.

This project requires some time, say around 10 days. I hear that there is a
script to automate LDAP installation. Search for it.

There is no concept of virus in linux.

/etc/smb.conf is the place where you specify user permissions.

Why are you using two DHCP servers? That has nothing to do with what you
are trying to do.

Best of luck.

You can use a combination of SAMBA and openLDAP and with PAM module on
the Linux client.

Honestly, I haven't even thought of doing it as it restricts the freedom.

You can refer to OpenLDAP site. They have a wonderful document on LDAP,
however, I suggest to check on SAMBA site and they are sure to have
sample config file for SAMBA / LDAP implementation.

Interoperability with windows is a risky business, always. They (M$)
keep changing their APIs often. You may not be able to achieve 100%
interoperability.

It is a joke... If you don't have a policy and if your users are not
following the policy then how ever you try to secure your network, you
will end up with a nice hole.

Remember, there are worms successfully written for Linux as well.

Open source is all about freedom... here you want to restrict... I know
those paranoid manager would have asked you.

"sudo apt-get install *wvdial*" will give the Regex compilation error

"sudo apt-get install wvdial"  will work.
If the package is not found in the repo it will show the error
"E: Couldn't find package wvdial"

hope this helps!!

Friends.

I am working on creating podcasts in tamil about linux and other FOSS
technologies.

I need contribution from you.

Please contact me offlist for participating.

Once, if we get fair podcasts, we need to host them.

Is there any free hosting service available for podcasts?

Thanks.

Automatically yes but only after you disclosed your account information 
to some service you signed up for.  If you look closely in the sign up 
screens, most such services have an option to skip the 
Google/Hotmail/Yahoo ... information.

Friends.

I have a to see a site, which is working only with IE.

Is it possible to setup Firefox to act as IE,
so that I can see the site with firefox itself.

I have kubuntu 9.04 and Firefox 3.5.2

Thanks.

I use the User Agent switcher extension:
  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/59

That at least gets rid of the site complaining.

However, in addition to working around the problem, I would also recommend that 
you mail the webmasters of every such site which insists on supporting only a 
broken browser telling them why doing so sucks.

I did look into ekiga but it didn't prove to be quite useful. Instead I
found that Google had released the libjingle API free of cost. Now the issue
is that I don't know how to use it. :sNow can you help?

Hai

There are two steps to setup ie in kbuntu
1. You can install ie6 as following link
        http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page
2. Or use any virtualization software to emulate xp or some windows and try
it

so if your purpose is just changing thing the CSS and Design related things
you can use
Firebug( The Famous add on for webdevelopment in firefox) in IE too by
followung steps

1. Download Firebug
lite<http://getfirebug.com/releases/lite/1.2/firebug-lite-compressed.js>(click
this to downlaod)
2. Plese add the following line in the head section of the page you need to
correct.

 <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"
        src="/path/to/firebug/firebug-lite.js"></script>


Thank You

the existing FAQ mentions a CD for grabs page which does not exist. It also 
mentions a form to filled in - which also does not exist. I also find it very 
weird that in the year 2009 - 10 years into the so-called web2.0 revolution we 
are still being asked to fill in forms and are not allowed to directly interact 
with the site. Those of us who develop webapps would be jobless if we proposed 
such things to our customers. As promised in the LUG meet I have set up a site 
to fulfill these requirements and am yet to understand why this site is being 
given step-motherly treatment. The only thing lacking is openid login which 
should be up by next week. btw, the site has a cd for grabs page where any 
logged in user can add his contribution. And there is no worry about spammers 
- adequate protection against them has been put.

In fact in the LUG meet I was asked to wait a day so that ilugc.in could also 
be pointed to this site - which is why I put it up on Tuesday instead of 
Monday. And to my surprise, my request for comments was replied by an 
announcement of ilugc.in is UP! As far as I can see, it does not fulfill any of 
the requirements expressed on the mailing list and the meeting - so can you 
spell out the reasons for this decision (if they are not top secret of 
course)? Maybe I sound a bit emotional, but I strongly feel that hard work for 
a cause should be met with constructive criticism - not a slap in the face.

Sorry. I thought, both sites are in competition mode[1].

The primary site of the ILUGC is NOT yet decided. It is in the hands
of our members and I don't have any affinity to a specific site.

Our next public event, SFD 2009 is on Sep 19th. So we have finalize
the site for ILUGC. A poll site is ready, the polling starts on Mon
Aug 24th and ends on Thu Aug 27th 3PM. The result will be posted to
list on the same day.

The problem with audio blogging is that the audio files take
a lot of disk space and bandwidth.  The blog and comments
itself takes very little resources and be hosted anywhere.

Most cheap shared webhosting providers will blindly delete
mp3 files thinking you are pirating music.


If your content is under a Creative Commons license, you
can use www.archive.org to host your audio.  They provide
unlimited space and bandwidth forever for free.

Here's Brewster Kahle's very inspiring talk on his Internet
Archive project and his goal on providing "Universal Access
to all Knowledge":
http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail400.html
http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/audio/download/ITC.SDF-BrewsterKahle-2004.12.16.mp3

I'm in the process of moving 15GB of audio lectures for a
the Internet Archive.  Works very well and is highly
recommended.

Really happy to hear that someone is coming forward to work on libjingle .

It really hurts my ego every time I run skype( one of the few
proprietary.* I have to use )  :(  I am also having a bad time
explaining why I can't google talk .

Well as far as I know Pidgin and Kopete are both implementing Libjingle .
The most important thing is that Libjingle implementation of both
kopete and pidgin was a GSOC project 2008 and still hasn't been usable
:(
anyways you are  a contributor rather than a user its a good news for
you since you have the chance to do *a* lot :)

For kopete libjingle implementation check out
http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/kdenetwork/kopete/protocols/jabber/jingle/

Well the pidgin project really needs more love . The gaim-vv people
atleast did something but now there is no visible progress says the
pidgin project :(
http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ProgressReport
Anyways join the pidgin voice people at
http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/GSoC2008/VoiceAndVideo

If you wan to start a new project please feel free to do so . I will
be your first beta tester :D

Pavithran

Oops correction :
Pidgin 2.6.0 is now enjoying the fruits of GSOC 2008 :)

It supports voice and video framework .
http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ChangeLog#version2.6.008182009

Anyways I think there is lot more to work on it by making it usable .
I really wonder why pidgin people didn't update their wiki pages.

I learnt of it when I saw the slashdot article on Pidgin voice support
which also came with a vulnerability .

Do check the slashdot article :
http://tech.slashdot.org/story/09/08/19/2128210/Pidgin-Adds-Google-Talk-Voice-and-Video-Support-and-a-Vulnerability

where is the poll site? have you taken steps to see that only LUG members can 
vote (like we did in the last poll). And that there can be only one vote per 
person? (We did that also in the last poll).

Nice Idea. But if someone reply wrongly to this thread with different
content then totally spoil the purpose. I feel, poll site simple.  
The poll site is having provision to prevent duplicate vote and no
provision to restrict to our members only.

TSrini created a simple poll page. TSrini, can you post the draft 
page link?

I have created a poll page last time. It has no duplicate voting and also can 
be confined to LUG members only. The application is alive and most LUG members 
are already registered on the nrcfoss site. So it is no big deal to use it 
again.

Hi,

>>The application is alive and most LUG members
are already registered on the nrcfoss site. So it is no big deal to use it
again.

For neutrality sake, will a third party poll(a lug member of course) be a
good choice..?

Thanks and regards,

oops - since my site is in contention it would not be proper for me to host 
the poll ;-)

You need to join the Empathy team.

http://live.gnome.org/Empathy

Empathy has the default messenger for GNOME for sometime and
distributions are actively moving towards making it the default in the
upcoming release. It has a good framework for voice and video support
and limited support for it already for XMPP/gtalk

Pidgin in their next release is taking advantage of the same framework
as well.

Yes. You're right. A lot more is required for pidgin to become the de facto
app for video chat and stuff. For now, I'll look into both Empathy and
Pidgin.

Add extra HDD and mount it in say "/data1/"

Bring down mysql and do this,

$ mv /var/lib/mysql /data1/mysql
$ ln -s /data1/mysql /var/lib/mysql

Bring up mysql.

what on earth is Wiki Style? It is a simple CMS

on the poll website it is mentioned as 
'Anyone can edit the pages.
Content can be generated and maintained by Public'

this is not correct - only logged in users can add/edit pages - content can be 
generated and maintained by any LUG member. And only admins can generate 
meeting notices.

Further - availability of source code for the sites are not mentioned.

I'm sorry if it's not obvious from my previous mails already, but I'm 
pitching in with KG - I currently don't have the time to update my own, 
or make it all that it needs to be. Since KG is also as much motivated 
to get the site going *and keep it open for contribution*, I agreed that 
I will contribute to his version. The source of the site/wiki is 
available on bitbucket, and he has a pretty decent server to power it. I 
don't see how I can offer anything better, so I'm joining forces :).

So please exempt my version from the poll - there will only be two of 
them in contention - iugc.in or ilugc.org.in (though I personally prefer 
KG's version, as agreed before, I will redirect all the domains in my 
control to whichever site wins the poll). Hope I'm clear.

Vamsee.

how do you define who wins? A LUG is not a democracy, the vast majority of list 
members do not vote at all. Last time a poll was held, the person holding it 
insisted that at least 5% of the mailing list members should vote or else the 
poll would be invalid. He calculated that 5% meant at least 70 members voting. 
Actually after a lot of campaigning we got 67 people to vote. Since the 
majority was 74 to 6, the poll was accepted. We also ensured that only mailing 
list members were allowed to vote - how that is being done here I do not know. 
Maybe some one can explain?

Everything seems to be in a sudden frantic rush - after all we have been 
waiting and suffering without a site for a year. Why the hurry now? Why not sit 
down and list the criteria for a site and join and build one that suits it. 
There is something funny going on here which I do not understand. One thing I 
am sure about is that if we are going to have polls to decide how the LUG 
should do things, nothing will ever get done.

This poll app is not fair. I could vote 'n' number of times with the

Message-ID: <64d5b90a0908200238w64edd453m2a5f48f2347d0983@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings everyone,

It gives me pleasure to announce that Aanjhan Rangathan, researcher at
EPFL Switzerland and Sudharshan S, developer for OpenMoko and
freesmartphone.org will be presenting talks this Saturday giving an
overview of embedded systems design and development.

Talk Details:
Aanjhan's talk will cover some basics of hardware design and how the
systems are put together, and then move on to insights on embedded
operating systems. Details on what goes behind
building an embedded system from the OS,to device drivers and
application software shall also be discussed. The case under study
would be RTEMS - a real time executive for multiprocessor systems
(previously missile systems), an operating system widely deployed on
various space
missions by both NASA and ESA.

With Sudharshan's talk on application development, we will move up the
embedded system development layers to touch upon, application
development with some live demos using the Freerunner Open Mobile
phone running the OpenMoko
platform and using the D-Bus architecture.

Details:
Venue: ChLT, IIT Madras
Time: 22nd August, Saturday 10.30 am
Duration: 1.5 to 2 hrs.

Clearing cookies helps though. So,

same machine + same browser + clear cookie for this site = 'n' number
of votes :)

With majority population of dynamic IP, this would be easily
bypassable, wouldn't it?

Dear friends
Is the poll in right way? At present it looks like more than 250 people
voted. Is it possble? I don't think so many of our members are active - that too in such a short time.  Or is there something wrong with my browser?

When I casted my vote, the votes for individual options were in the range of
1, 1, 2, 1. When I checked after 20 minutes, a particular option had around
200 votes. I doubt if the number is real.

And the options have been completely reversed in the voting options.
[1] has become [3] and [3] has become [1] . I mean the order in which
it is listed is different from the polling order. Though the website
domain names are clearly mentioned, yet I don't think most people will
check that. They would see the numbers and just vote.

Message-ID: <829835.5388.qm@web94912.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

hi guys
i am new in installation of yum in cent os 5.0
i have tried to install yum on centos 5 server

i have followed the following steps 

download this  files in \
     gmp-4.1.4-10.el5.i386.rpm \
     readline-5.1-1.1.i386.rpm \

   rpm -Uvh http://mirror.centos.org/centos-5/5.0/os/i386/CentOS/$file;
done

and trying to 
     #yum -y update
this command one error is showing in command prombt

         There was a problem importing one of the Python modules
required to run yum. The error leading to this problem was:

   /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/rpm/_rpmmodule.so: undefined symbol: rpmdbCheckTerminate

Please install a package which provides this module, or
verify that the module is installed correctly.

It's possible that the above module doesn't match the
current version of Python, which is:
2.4.3 (#1, Jan 21 2009, 01:10:13) 
[GCC 4.1.2 20071124 (Red Hat 4.1.2-42)]

If you cannot solve this problem yourself, please go to 
the yum faq at:
  http://wiki.linux.duke.edu/YumFaq

so guide how to install yum perfectly on centos 5 server?

Dear Diary,

Today I learned that you can write for loops in the DOS shell.

I also learned that AJAX polls aren't a good idea.

Like so:

for %i in (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0) do (wget -q
"http://polls.polldaddy.com/vote-js.php?s=123&b=1&p=1893050&a=9549884,&o=&l=0&sl=1&pr=1&pt=0&va=0&cookie=0&rdm=2&url=http%3A//goinggnu.wordpress.com/2009/08/19/vote-a-site-for-indian-linux-user-group-chennai/&w=1893050"
 )

But then the poll was a stupid idea.

Love and regards,
Roshan

I guess a majority counts as a win? The web-based poll has the advantage 
of anonymity - so people can vote without worrying about irking friends. 
But I guess that also means the validity of results can also be doubted 
- but I'm not all that surprised to see that 250 people have voted.  
There are thousands of members, right? The last poll was ages ago. I'm 
sure a few hundred new students joined since then?

Anyways, if the validity is in question, I think the foolproof way to do 
it is on the list and count them manually. That way we know for sure 
they're members. If anybody has a better idea, shoot.

Vamsee.

Hi !

Poll for site is the dumbest idea. If you people can not sit together
discuss and sort out , what is the point ?
Clearly it  shows that ego and playing one-up on each other is more
important than the purpose of the mission.

I kindly request you to meet in one place and decide what is to be done.
This is very disgusting .. so many talented people but  just can not
work together.

Really? Agreeing to disagree is disgusting? Keeping the decision process 
open is disgusting? The issue came to a poll _because_ there are 
differing opinions on how to do it. It's not unnatural to have 
difference of opinions. And not all of them can be solved by huddling 
together and doing a 'chintan baitak'. I for one, am quite happy with 
how the issue is being handled. It might be long-winded, but we'll get 
results.

Hi !

It is my prerogative to express my comments !
 Like you are happy with the polls , I am not happy with the
polls.That is about all.

 I do not think it is question of " how to do it which is causing problem.
>From the tone of the postings .. what is going on there id clearly a
king-sized ego problem between two or more groups of people. That is
what is disgusting.This is my opinion !

www.chennailug.org is the site which i had been maintaining with Drupal +
Mediawiki. Site was running with PHP 4.x and hence I wasnt able to use any
spam controls with the site. as a result, site was fully loaded with spam.

There wasnt a easy way to clean up the spam in wiki. Drupal stopped working
because of wiki taking as much as space in the server. in the mean time,
www.chennailug.org was going to be expired. i wasnt able to contact the
person who own it for to do the renewal. bharathi and tshrinivasan knows
about this and they too tried to contact the person responsible for this. In
this time, i decided to register for ilugc.in and informed bharathi.

ilugc.in was born. it took some time for me to get it up and running.
meanwhile members talked about site not being up for long time in the
mailing list. i decided to hold on the domain with me because i know that i
will renew it properly as i am doing it for my other sites. you will never
hear that "ilugc.in has expired". For everyone in this list, ilugc.in is for
ILUGC group. not for anyone. not my personal pet project.

Raman.P and Others in the mailing list wanted a site which is simple and
should be useful enough for people to know whats happening in ILUGC group.
It should tell where and when the next meeting is, what are all events, what
is the meeting place etc. In order to support all these features, I felt
like Drupal is the way to go.

Why i choose Drupal for ilugc.in?
--------------------------------
    Drupal is a simple content management system which:

        * generally stores your content in a database
        * keeps the design of the site separate from the content
        * makes it so that to update something on every page of your CMS Web
site you generally only have to update it in one place, not on every
individual page of the Web site.

    Drupal is very powerful and can be used for building large,
simple/complex sites.  Some example Drupal sites are:
    http://endpoverty2015.org/ - The United Nations
    http://www.warnerbrosrecords.com/ - Warner Brothers Records
    http://discoveryclub.de/ - The Discovery Channel
    http://officepranks.forbes.com/ - Forbes
    http://dead.net/ - The Grateful Dead
    http://dev.aol.com/ - AOL
    http://research.yahoo.com/ - Yahoo
    http://www.lime.com/ - Lime.com
    http://www.observer.com/ - The New York Observer
    http://www.theonion.com/ - The Onion
    http://www.seobook.com/ - Aaron Wall's SEObook.com

    You can see more list here -> http://buytaert.net/tag/drupal-sites


What it takes to develop a community site like ilugc.in with Drupal?
----------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, i have to tell you all that i have *not* done any coding. the
entire site is built just using Drupal and Modules

Default Modules used are
1. Colors
2. Comment
3. Contact
4. Menu
5. Poll
6. Profile
7. Search

Third Party Modules used are
1. CCK
2. Views

Site is developed inspired by http://itls.usu.edu/

How can i contribute to the development of ilugc.in?
--------------------------------------------------
Since ilugc.in site is developed with Drupal, you have to contribute to the
core project or the modules at drupal.org. Few members in the list talked
about source code not being open for the site. There is nothing in the
ilugc.in site to be open sourced. the source is already available there at
drupal.org. I have done Zero lines of coding to get this site done

I cannot login to ilugc.in?
-------------------------
currently user registeration is blocked. the decision is taken by bharathi
and this blocking is for only short time. after some time, it will be open
for all. any one can register with the site and add contents.

what are all the content i can contribute?
----------------------------------------
1. any FOSS Event which you are going to conduct / heard of.
2. if you are a ilugc meeting co-ordinator, you will be able to update the
ilugc meetings
3. any announcement releated to FOSS
4. FOSS related freelancing / full time jobs

These are not yet enabled as of now because user registration is blocked
now.

where is the CD's for Grab page?
--------------------------------
we had CD's for Grab page on the wiki previously. now I thought a different
way of doing it. After user registeration, you can do profile updates. In
that, you can mention what linux / foss you use. This will be available via
search for any one. This is not yet enabled as of now because user
registration is blocked now.

will i get any jobs via ilugc.in?
-----------------------------
i am not sure about this. but it is possible. if you update your
ilugc.inprofile with right set of information, you should be knocked
with
opportunities. Every user has a profile page where you can provide details
about your FOSS expertise. I am planning to take the feed from
fossjobs.wordpress.com and display it here too. This is not yet enabled as
of now because user registration is blocked now.

why I did not build the site with HTML?
---------------------------------------
You can see what a static web page is here ->
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page and here
http://www.google.com/search?q=static+site+vs+dynamic+site

Do i have Ego?
--------------
I often see the word "Ego" in the mailing list being mentioned. I definitely
*dont* have that (you can ask the people who knows me). I welcome the
decision which is right and i support it whole heartedly. It may differ from
people to people with the way they are looking at. I dont want to keep the
site source closed. just that people dont know that the source is already
available out there. people who knows about drupal and what leveraging open
source is knows about using existing ones rather than reinventing the wheel.
i definitely do not want to reinvent the wheel. Hence i chose drupal and i
definitely dont have any ego with any one. I admire people who are smarter
than me and i teach people who are less smarter than me to become smartest
than me.

What's Next?
-------------
Take a look at www.ilugc.in and if you like it, just vote for it whereever
voting is in place. Thanks for your time in reading this big email.

Friends.

Any idea for the secured poll?

Shall we ask people to add comment + voting?

so that we can match the count and block any automation.

Any other idea is welcome.

Thanks.

Hi !

Automation will not work ! Either sit and discuss or have something simple.
All members just reply to a thread with comments  and you count manually.

I see that some sort of campaigning has started ? So will there be
poll rigging , horse trading , fake votes and poll violence also ? I
will not be surprised !


Cheers

Let people enter the email id and password of their ILUGC mailing list
accounts and then cast their votes. It would take a little work to do this,
though.

Simplest way what i think is, create three new threads in the list for the
three websites, and members can start "+1" voting  what they like. I agree
it will be a open voting. but at the end its easy to count its just the
number of replies for the thread.

You are trying to install the rpms before downloading the rpms. First
download all the rpms in a specific directory then install rpms using
rpm -Uvh *.rpm

Then try upgrading yum

Can ask users to submit their email ID while voting and send
them an email with a link which they must click to validate/complete
their vote.

I would again use @mailinator.com email IDs and spam the vote
system, but you could always filter them out while vote counting.


I feel we should stop worrying about voting, and focus on the
website instead.  We can have all discussions on the mailing
list itself and then decide in the end.

since most of your package is of development, use yum groupinstall

check here -> http://fedoranews.org/tchung/yum-groupinstall/

yum is meant to be used when u dont want to worry abt deps.

No need for any passwords. If they're able to post to the list, it means

Hi !

Polling through the forum thread is open and is same as sitting
together is discussing.
But the members should be disciplined and stop spamming or posting
unwanted comments !

But any automated polling system  will turn out to be total bakwaas

Message-ID: <92f9a9560908200629q51c0b4e3vde848edcad104d79@mail.gmail.com>

All the 3 new ilugc websites have both www.ilugc.org and ilugc.org
(naked domain) serving website content.

It's generally considered taboo by search engines to serve duplicate
content using multiple domains or urls.

http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=44231


Please add a 301 redirect so domain.org is permanently forwarded
to www.domain.org (or vice-versa).

I think, the requirement is restriction based on LDAP users.   This is the
big problem in Linux arena.  And also this is a good project for the
research students to undertake.

Ubuntu comes with all the tools required for setting up this server.
However, there is no GUI utility for the same.

And REDHAT seems to have easy GUI configurable option.  I configured samba
within two minutes through GUI, like creating user and creating share.
And REDHAT also supports centralised authentication mechanism.

However, i havent dealt deep in to this.

One other possibility.  Almost all colleges deploy a centralised server for
user authentication, and most of them use win 2003.

If LUG member could concentrate on it, and encourage students to undertake
projects based on this, we can create an alternate CAS for win 2003.
We have all the tools available, and the only thing needed is to combine all
those, prepare a very good documentation, and then persuade few colleges to
deploy the system.

In my company, we have hosted wordpress and Confluence in linux server, but
there is a problem in implementing SSO for compatibility with windows
network.

Any idea about this?

Any one interested to take it as either mini or academic project?

SEnthil

You are trying to install the rpms before downloading the rpms. First

rpm -Uvh *.rpm

i have already given the ilugc.xcf in the link i gave. you can customize
with that. adding tux is a good idea. but tux represents only linux. whereas
gnu cow/bull logo represents FOSS.

I think you are looking at system lock down. check out some of teh
following links.

http://library.gnome.org/admin/deployment-guide/
http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-4-Manual/desktop-guide/ch-ddg-lockdown.html

You can also look at Policy Kit.

http://people.freedesktop.org/~david/polkit-spec.html#introduction

Some of your requirements are too concise/confusing to comment on. Are
you looking at replacing your windows desktops with Linux? How much of
integration are you looking at?

Unless your are really looking at replacing all the MS systems or most
of them, it doesn't make sense to move authentication mechanism to
Linux from your Organization. You might be  better off initially with
all the Linux system authenticating to windows. It would also depend a
lot on wht applications you currently run and teh amount of
integration you need to test.

My 2 Cents

yum is installed by default on all CentOS installs, as long as they are 
done properly. What sort of an install do you have that yum isnt there ? 
is that some hacked up VPS or something such ?

Also, i hope you are getting yum on there to do an upgrade - 5.0 is 
quite old and there are now, many known issues with it ( like any 
software that has been around this long )

all bogus votes - when I checked my site I found that not a single person has 
tested out the site - which means that people have voted for the site without 
even testing it - such votes are worthless

Define 'tested out'. Do you really expect them to do start entering the 
data right away? I've gone to the site, checked out the code too, liked 
the multi-lingual options, and perhaps it doesn't have eye candy yet, 
but it's going in the right direction. That's enough for me to vote for it.


Vamsee.

I feel live testing is essential - if necessary even spam the site a bit to 
see the reaction. Which reminds me that I have not set up signals to notify me 
of postings.

Subject: [Ilugc] criteria for expressing an opinion on a website for the LUG
Message-ID: <200908210604.08581.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,
before anyone expresses an opinion on a website for the LUG, it is imperative 
that they sincerely test out the candidate sites - opinions expressed without 
this are totally worthless as they just waste bandwidth. When the site for 
hosting the Indian Python conference was proposed, there was a full month of 
testing, and about 20 people tried out the features, found bugs, asked for 
enhancements and only chose the site when all this was fulfilled. One person 
even spent 4 hours at a stretch hammering the site from all angles and was 
instrumental in getting the site fully functional to the satisfaction of all 
concerned. Based on the discussions here and in the LUG meet, the following 
criteria are essential;

1. Does the site support registration and login for members. 

2.Is it easy for members to post reports, events, CD for grabs and other 
features?

3. Are there essential features that can only be done by authorised admins?

4. Can spammers be quickly identified and banned?

5. Is the source code of the site available?

6. Is the site under version control?

7. Are members welcome to contribute code, design for the site?

8. How quickly does the maintainer respond to bug reports and requests for 
features?

9. Is the site available in Tamil?

10. Where is the site hosted and how stable is the hosting?

11. Are new features thoroughly tested before being put in production?

12. Is there a publicly available bug/feature request tracking system

13. In cases of sites that are managed through a CMS, is there a publicly 
available log of all changes and customisation that can be used to rebuild the 
site?

14. And most important: does the maintainer have an ego and how big is it? The 
bigger the better because he will always be worried about complaints and will 
fix problems immediatly. If he has no ego, he will just give excuses and take 
months or years to respond to complaints.

I finally figured it out
The problem in that is my wifi device is Athroes, so when i saw the
proprietary driver i enabled it, that made
my wifi device to hide, i uninstalled the driver and reinstalled ubuntu now
its working fine without the activation of the driver
now my lspci shows

The link should make you realize it's more of a "best practice" sort of thing.

Couldn't register, it first threw an "Internal Server Error", and then
I was told that "Tempreg with this Email Address already exists." ...
FYI.

I tried via http://chennai.lug.in first, so maybe that caused
something to break.

Yesterday I had pulled the code, but it was missing a settings.py ...
my django-fu is rusty so is there a way to get a "default" settings
file?

the best practice is not to configure the www thing at all - but then too many 
people have www prefix as default and they complain

yes - for some reason smtp auth stopped working, you must have tried to 
register when I was debugging it. Looks like it works now - but I have to 
manually send you the login link.

That would invalidate your point, right?  If you don't care about
page-rank (and maybe you shouldn't) you can serve the same content at
both places, but it's usually just cleaner to redirect to one or the
other.

But linux detecting the ethernet device properly and loaded 'forcedeath'
driver.

I checked the new BSNL ADSL modem in with my friend's laptop, it worked
without any problem.

is my ethernet card gone? will linux(or any OS) detect a faulty device?
do I need to replace it? if that is the case, how to replace it? what
all problem will occur if I want to replace my ethernet card?

Hi,
I came to know that, FOSS becomes mandatory in Anna University, Coimbatore's
syllabus [1] .They call the subject as "Open Source" Time for some
appreciation from ILUGC? what about training the teachers of those
affiliated colleges? Can any one studying/working in Anna University
,Coimbatore affiliated colleges confirm this?

we have already done several workshops for teachers in the coimbatore region. 
We find them far more motivated and interested than teachers of other regions 
in Tamilnadu.

Dear all,

I am not able to guess how many of you nurse a dream to create an open
source project.

There is a lot of satisfaction one can get by creating an open source
program. But the real
challenge here is getting a massive userbase and getting a lot of
people to use your creation.

I have done some very interesting projects, developed cool products
and so on but I worked
for companies which could not utilize my creations appropriately.

There have been cases when they cannot be blamed at all. They simply
don't have the marketing
reach necessary to promote something.

There have been cases where they are not even able to assess the value
of the creation.

This I am sure is not my experience alone. Many individuals worldwide
will be facing this strange
situation.

The open source world solves a lot of such problems and many more.

Anyway see my page here:

http://spamcheetah.sf.net

I have also published it in freshmeat.

By and large the experience was very enjoyable more from a technical
standpoint than anything else.

The tools that sf.net gives for uploading to their website and their
worldwide download mirrors is fantastic.

Please start a sf.net project whenever you find the opportunity!

Best of luck. And you can always contact me for any queries.
(Not this mail ID. I use girish at gayatri hitech )

I plan to release a lot more projects on sf.net. And all my products
will always have a corresponding
open source release.

Thanks.

-Girish

I guess many of us dream. But somehow due to work and other pressure it
never gets done

We have very few products from India  which impacts the world. I guess this
small projects like these could be a beginning. Really happy to see your
creation on sf.net.

I too started a project on sf.net purely out of passion for Open Source,

coimbatore academic culture is quite live and the colleges often act in
collaboration.

but the interest and motivation are in other regions also -- especially
tirunelveli and kanyakumari/nagerkoil.  may be, it is time to take this up.

All other branches of Anna University should be informed about this
development and we should try to change their syllabus too.

The course content looks REALLY interesting. But i feel that this is an
overkill. 2 reasons :
1. "For what the course has to offer", Fifth semester is too early. This
should be in the final year.
2. This course would fine tune a student's programming/exploratory skills,
which should be done after learning the rudiments of programming and the
associated theory.

Nevertheless, kudos!

i dont agree i think its still too late , it should be early on , i
look at Learning as the other way round exploring first then teaching
the theory.

Subject: [Ilugc] Spreading the use / cause of Open Source.
Message-ID: <4A8E3A23.1050703@gmail.com>

Guys & Gals (if there are any),

We all love our OS and the software that comes with it. It doesn't
matter if you use Linux, Hurd, BSDs' or even openSolaris. The advantage
we have is the use of GCC. Almost all open source OS use GCC. This helps
our application to be compatible in source format. Not to mention
Python, Ruby, and the old horse PERL, etc...

We all understand the advantage of using a OSS to CSS and most
importantly how it can impact a country like ours. It is important that
we take up efforts to spread the use of OSS through various means... On
a selfish thought, if OSS is widely adopted then our corporate survival
is comfortable (which most of you will be looking at soon).

Following are some of my suggestion for the spread OSS and aim for
increased use. I understand, you will already be doing some of these.

1. Linux fest - invite users of computer to try and use open source OS.
Help them install open source OS, ask them to participate in the novice
group of ilugc.

2. Meet government - Gov is a very important users an influencer in IT
market. Gov of India looks at IIT prof for approval of key IT decisions.
ilugc sould work with these prof and also ensure they participate in the
ilugc meetings and mailing list.

Form committee to work with the Gov bodies.

3. Meet schools - Students today are tomorrows nation builders. We need
to capture them young. We can form committee to work with school to open
their doors for us to help them setup open source OS based computer lab
and they use GCC (at present CBSE uses the defunct Turbo C++).

4. Write open source OS that are useful to corporate management - this
is open area open source developers have not much ventured. This
softwares can be fun to develop and very satisfying as you can use a lot
of mathematical models to develop decision support system.

5. Lastly - guide other LUG close to us to adopt such measures for them.

6. We should organise annual Linux conference in our city and invite
software shops and other users. Organise special presentations targeting
how open source can address the need of the hour.

Remember that we are all volunteers in this cause. We also need some
funding. We should be talking to IBMs, DELL, HP, Red Hat, Oracle, etc...

If these group is interested then we can start working towards it.

cool - congratulations. One caveat - a lot of us have moved away from 
sourceforge to places like bitbucket, google code or github - the main reason 
is that sf is very slow and it is complicated to set up and maintain something 
there. Although the interface is much better now, I personally found that I 
was spending more time on negotiating their interface and doing admin tasks 
than in actually writing code. Anyway, I hope you find people to contribute to 
your code and help it develop.

yum is installed by default on all CentOS installs, as long as they are done properly. What sort of an install do you have that yum isnt there ? is that some hacked up VPS or something such ?

Also, i hope you are getting yum on there to do an upgrade - 5.0 is quite old and there are now, many known issues with it ( like any software that has been around this long )

All,

On behalf of ILUGC myself, Arun SAG, Baskar - Linuxerpt System we
conducted one day LAMP workshop on 19th August, at  Mepco Sivakasi for
the final year CSE and IT students. The session started with the
fundamental Web technology and we ended up exploring the PHP, Perl,
Python with MySQL. There are totally 120 participants from  both the
classes including the CSE and the IT.

The content covered in the session are follows.

Introduction to FOSS/Scripting Languages/Web Technology
Introduction to MySQL/ SQL
PHP language Basics
Database Programming with PHP and MySQL,
The soup of web development, Authentication and Authorization
Python language basics
Perl language basics

Many special thanks to Arun SAG, Baskar for his support  in setting up
the lab with the 60+ fedora boxes and assisting participants in the
hands on. I also  like to thank  the organiser Prof. Shenbagaraj  from
Mepco for his support and hospitality. The response from the
participants were amazing.

Thanks for the Rahul Sundram for sending me the fedora DVD's which I
am distributing to the participants in various sessions.

Hi All,

ILUGC is celebrating the SFD 2009 on Sat Sep 19th 2009 at Birla
Planetarium, Kotturpuram, Chennai. Demo Stalls, Tutorials and 
Live Installations are planned for the SFD:

Demo Stall:
==========

Each stall should take a theme and demo the FOSS tools belong to the
theme. Stalls should be open from 9AM to 6PM. Each stall should have
min of 2 and max of 5 volunteers. Stall can be managed by volunteers
from LUG/College. Students, due to some issue, if you are not in
position to represent your college, then join as ILUGC volunteer.

A. Max of 25 Demo Stalls.
B. Max of 2 per College.
C. They can choose the theme/we can suggest.
D. ILUGC will have upper-hand in deciding the theme.
E. MIT guys volunteered to setup 2 stalls (Multimedia, ?)

Tutorials (30mins):
==================

Tutorials (English and Tamil) on simple topics for general public,
like using OO, Browsing, Playing Audio/Video files, Chat, etc.

Live Installations:
==================

One session for the live installation demo of few distros (Debian, 
Fedora, Ubuntu).

COMPUTERS:
=========

1. You can bring your computer/laptop with power card and extn box. 
   (Preferred, In the previous LDDs, we use our own machine to 
    show the demo)
2. BP agreed to provide 10 computers. (As of now, we don't have any 
   info about this machine)

Demo Stall Volunteers:
=====================

Volunteers are needed to manage the demo stalls. If you are willing to
volunteer, then decide 2 or 3 themes (Multimedia Tools, Office Tools,
Internet Tools, Programming Tools, KDE, GNOME, ..) and mail it to the
list.

If needed, we can help to select a suitable theme. If more no of
volunteers are selecting a same theme then different theme will be
allocated to you from your alternative theme list.


Event Management:
================

Volunteer to manage the event (like power, table, food and water
arrangement) and directing the people to the right stall or right
person to get some specific help.

Bye :)

Wow ! Ego is a virtue ?

Ego never allows team playing !
With ego ,the maintainer will not listen to constructive comments and
improve the site.
With ego ,maintainer will "pooh Pooh " everybody.
Person with ego does not think clearly because focus is on maintaining
the ego not the site !

We cant be recording it, but if the speakers agree, we shall put up the
slides on the Shaastra website (www.shaastra.org) as this is a run-up to the
actual workshop in Shaastra, IITM's technical festival. But one would miss
out on the live demos conducted during the talk.

with enough ego, the maintainer will make sure that no one has grounds to 
criticise the site - he will take it as a personal insult if the site goes 
down, and will not rest till it is up. Without ego he will blame the tools he 
uses or some one else and do nothing.

not so - I have never seen a person without ego accomplishing anything

Hi !

Ego may be okay ....can be equated to self esteem !
But Ego combined with arrogance  is a disaster !
It will definitely ruin everything ! I wont bet on such a thing !

Hello guyz.,

>>team players are very useful in getting coffee and bajjis - they are
otherwise

  ilugc events like the FOSSE '06, SFD '06 , i enjoyed with the team  as a
good team player when it mattered the most for physical contribution. I am
one for getting tea and coffee's for my team.

some of the golden words about the team are

*Coming together is a beginning.
Keeping together is progress.
Working together is success.*
- Henry Ford

*We must all hang together, or assuredly, we shall all hang separately.*
- Benjamin Franklin

*None of us, including me, ever do great things. But we can all do small
things, with great love, and together we can do something wonderful.*
Mother Teresa

*No man is wise enough by himself.*
Plautus

Cheers

Hi,

Nice to see that JFC is rocking.

Wishes to to the energetic students.

You can do more with the powerful crew.

here are some interesting things you can do.

1. create video tutorials for famous FOSS software like openoffice,
inkscape, gimp etc. in tamil
2. create 3D demo videos using blender
3. print and distribute linux t-shirts, caps,bands,badges etc
4. prepare a CD or DVD that contains videos, interviews and tutorials in tamil
    so that we can give that DVD to any FOSS beginner to see.
5. go and tell about linux to nearer colleges
6. give a talk to public, children and school teachers
7. run a bug-jam on upcoming release of any distro and report the bugs
8. create tux toys and sell
9. ask linux for you and other IT magazines to capture your activities
10. have programming contests and share all the code via any Free code
hosting as sourceforge.net,code.google.con,github etc.

yes.

You can do wonderful things.

Wishes.

> some of the golden words about the team are

Hi !

Other than team playing  here are some about ego and arrogance.

"Egotism - usually just a case of mistaken nonentity "

"Conceit is thinking you're great; egotism is knowing it"

"When men are most sure and arrogant they are commonly most mistaken,
giving views to passion without that proper deliberation which alone
can secure them from the grossest absurdities"

Any at the moment , what is important is not the universal truth but
what ILUGC members think about the whole thing !

Will they vote for a site run by a egoist ? Will egoist  deliver or destroy ?

Let them decide !

Cheers

one must understand the fundamental nature of LUGs in particular and the open 
source world in general. The concepts 'team' and 'democracy' are totally 
different here. What makes Chennai LUG so successful is that we have many 
people with well defined egos who do not fear to take initiative. They dive 
into projects without looking back to see if the 'team' is following them. If 
a call comes, they answer. They ask for help and volunteers, but do not start 
whining and abandon the project if there is no help or volunteers. Open source 
projects are the same - thousands contribute to the linux kernel, but one man 
decides. If Linus does not sign off on a commit - it does not appear in the 
kernel. Anyone can express an opinion, but those who contribute more are more 
likely to be heard. 

The concept of a team with each member having a defined role is unknown to 
FOSS. When someone joins a software project no one tells him what to do or on 
what area he should work. He picks something and does it - if others like it, 
it is accepted. In industry, each person is allotted an area of work and tasks 
to do - and if he does it whether he likes it or not - he is a team player. 
Secondly people are supposed to stick to the area they are allotted and not do 
work allotted to others. Everyone is supposed to specialise. No all rounders 
permitted, or tolerated. If you are made to do testing - do testing, no 
programming allowed. If the code fails a test, you do not repair the code - 
you report the failure to the concerned authority and he gets it repaired. And 
if you do that without grumbling, then you get a tick mark as a team player. 
And if you are ordered to get coffee and bajjis - you do it if it is in your 
allotted area of responsibility - but in a LUG meet no one will dream of 
ordering anyone to get coffee and bajjis. Someone will go and get them, often 
without asking anyone what they want.

I have seen LUGs controlled by one or two people with over blown egos with a 
bunch of followers with no ego at all. Result is that everything depends on 
getting permission from these one or two people. Net result is that the LUG 
does not do much. People get frustrated and leave or split. I have even seen 
one of these people making a junior member carry his laptop for him! That 
junior is a real team player.

As for democracy - one man one vote - it is unknown in this domain. A is a LUG 
member. He gives thoughtful advice on the mailing list, he gives excellent 
well documented talks in meets and has conducted many many LDDs and training 
sessions. B is a new member who is famous for selling his address book to 
social networking sites and spamming the LUG with invitations. His other 
contributions are minimal. No one will suggest that both of them have only one 
vote each. A should have at least 10 votes and B should not be allowed to vote 
at all.

to summarise - no democracy, no team players - a bunch of strong willed 
egoists scratching their itches.

Wow ! Performance based voting ! Revolutionary concept ! It is getting
complicated !

I have heard of eligibility for candidates but this something new !
Eligibility for voting  ?
I thought only eligibility is being a member of lugc and being
interested in Linux and open source leave alone being proficient !


Will the candidates for the election announce their election manifesto please ?
We , the simple minded voters are very confused !

I for one will vote for a site which satisfies the 14 points KG
mentioned at the start of this thread.  They seem sensible and
fair.  The 14th "ego" point is also fair, provided it's understood
in the right context (see below).

So far KG has not acted in any way that goes against the best
interest of the LUG.  He has also put in actual time and effort in
developing a website.  The other two website authors deserve
similar recognition and thanks for their efforts.

Please keep this in mind and show some respect when debating
your points with the website authors.


> Will egoist  deliver or destroy ?

"Ego" is mentioned in the same context that laziness, impatience
and hubris, all bad qualities, make you a better Perl programmer.


Let's listen to what the authors have to say.  Be gentle, and above
all be constructive with our comments.

Hi !

I supose that 14 points are only a recommendation  for the members
for choosing the site and vote.
 I hope  it is not mandatory !  It is also up to the members to decide
( provided we are given a chance ) on what basis to decide.
Some points ( eg #14 ) may not palatable for some members or may be
trivial. I mentioned as "egoist site " only because it was mentioned
as a criteria for maintaining the site for lack of a name for such a
site.

I also web site authors also practice same restraint and refrain from
making derogatory remarks even though it may be in the spirit of
campaign !

Hi !

Please correct me if I am wrong.

Does this mean all ILUGC members are not eligible for voting ?
Only people with proficiency in open source can vote ? Is there going
to be a vote at all ?

Will some one clarify this ?

Hi,

Today, I conducted a Fedora workshop at ACE College of Engineering
[1], Ankushapur, Ghatkesar Mandal [2], Ranga Reddy District, Andhra
Pradesh, India.

I have addressed "i-want-2-do-project. tell-me-wat-2-do-fedora",
"Packaging RPM", "Badam Halwa of Embedded Systems" presentations [3].
The attendees were Computer Science and Information Technology
Department students, and faculty. I would like to thank Mrs. K. Jaya
Bharathi, Head of the Computer Science Department, for coordinating
with me for the past one month in organizing this workshop.

They don't yet have a Fedora Lab. I have provided them with Fedora 10,
11 repositories for their offline use (53 GB). I have also given them
Fedora 10, 11 DVDs.

Ghatkesar is 25 km from Hyderabad, and one hour drive from Hyderabad
through NH-7 [4].

As customary, here are some pictures taken during the visit.

All,

I have given an introductory FOSS seminar for 2 hours on 20/08/2009 (Thursday) in
Sermathai Vasan College for Women, Near Madurai.

The total participants were around 350 (students of B.Sc (CS), B.Com and other departmets were also participated).  After a small introduction of FOSS, I requested a student to Install Fedora-11, and a student came forward and installed
Fedora-11 and also given few copies of Fedora-11 DVDs.

The response I got was very impressive from both the students and staff members.

no idea - but voting is a bad idea - discussion on the list will evolve a

Hi !

I agree . In fact I had expressed my opinion in another thread  that
voting was a bad idea and it should be finalized only by discussion
among "active" members.
Okay . instead of voting , we call it a competition then !
Appoint a panel of judges ,say 10 members and some arrive at some benchmarks !
We ,the lower class of species can choose the panel of judges !

cheers

Here are some ideas I'm just throwing out.

Bala and Bharathi's site is the best looking of the lot, and also the
most feature complete.  I don't know how it is updated, and run, but
for now I feel (and this is just me) it should be the default address
given out to people who ask for a web address.

Vamsee could have a done a fantastic job (again, just my opinion) but
I can understand if he is busy and only interested in doing this if
there is no alternative website being done by anyone else.

I like Kenneth's website only because it is in Django, which means it
would be fun to hack (and it could be so much fun), but But BUT, it
looks awful, and the code is a mess (well, this is criticism, but I
hope not unfair criticism).  But still I am excited about it because
there are so many things that can be done here (clean, run out of the
box repo, better organized code, it's a program, infinitely
malleable...)

So yeah, here's what I'm saying:  lets have the others running.  B&B
have starter's advantage in that any new contender will have to be
much superior to the existing setup to justify a switch.

Varadarajan, you will be taken much more seriously if you help out
with a particular choice, but I'd agree with KenG that the people
actually doing the work have a greater say in this than you.  And no,
flooding the list with posts full of outrage isn't going to change
that.  Fwiw.

Hi !

If you see my last posting you will see that I had agreed on this
point. I do not want to have a say in the decision.That is why I
suggested panel of judges and benchmarking. But as a member I would
like to see the issue resolved and we have a nice working site which
meets the requirement . Nothing more.

Please avoid personal remarks. That does not help also.

Cheers

there is no doubt about that
> I don't know how it is updated, and run,

that is the whole problem - we have been waiting for this site for ages. There 
is no openness about the development - source is not available. My only need 
is for a site where members can post events, CDs for grabs and reports. There 
are so many events taking place. As soon as an event takes place, a report and 
a photo should be put up. Now everything is locked down. The 	FAQ mentions a 
CDs for grabs page - but it is not there. When will it appear? I have 
developed my site in total frustration at the lack of response of the site 
maintainers. And looking at their past record over the years, I do not see how 
it is going to change.

that is a wrong interpretation - I think Vamsee's idea is that he will only 
spare time if there is a team willing to help out - and anyway he has now 
opted out and will direct his domains to whichever site is decided on.

not and unfair criticism - it is a useless criticism ;-) A criticism of code 
should be specific: only then can anything be done about it. Yes it has not 
been designed to look good. The questions is:

1. can you register?
2. can you log in?
3. can you post a simple report with one photo?
4. can you report an event?
5. do reports and events get displayed on the site?

this is important - the beauty of the code or the beauty of the site are 
secondary.

> there are so many things that can be done here (clean, run out of the

that is the power of exposing the source code - every one can work to improve 
it.

That is correct - my idea was to get the thing going - and hopefully a 
few more people who are interested in my way of doing it will help out 
eventually. Maybe they could have, if we didn't have this limbo about 
which one is considered 'official'. Last month I had some free time, but 
this month I'm swamped, unfortunately.

And that's the whole reason why I support KG's way of doing it - though 
I it's similar to my way of doing things too (except mine is static) 
perhaps he felt Django will fit the bill better, I'm cool with that. And 
I offered to pitch in to his setup. And I will be helping him out with 
the design soon.

As far as the code being a mess is concerned, I'm sure some of us could 
lend a hand with that too. I don't see it as a big issue in the long 
run. The most important thing is, we need to have a structure where 
people can pitch in whenever they can, and feel like it, even if they 
are tiny changes. Instead of mailing somebody, and hoping that the 
changes will happen, eventually.

The idea is to bring it to a level where "hey, such and such thing has 
gone wrong, I fixed it, please push it". And KG or whoever has access to 
the server just needs to run a command to deploy the changes. That's all 
that needs to be done, ideally. Even he might not have the time to dig 
into code, but he sure can deploy it in seconds.

Vamsee.

Message-ID: <809586140908230319v2b09d497w8a46ed87ad22dedb@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Luggies,

I have been going through the support of SSL in open source browsers.
CCA (Controller of CA) is a Govt. of India body entrusted with
providing PKI in India.

A lot of indian banks and other clients are forced to use popular root
CA like Verisign, which costs a lost to provide trust. The digital
certificates provided by CCA and its corresponding CA remains
untrusted in all browsers since the root CA of CCA does not come pre
installed with the open source browsers.

Has CCA taken any initiative to get them pre install on the browsers.
A common netizen may not be aware of the technicalities behind root CA
or SSL.

Is it possible for us to make them come pre install with the popular
open source browsers like FF etc.

Please comment on this and point me if I am wrong some where.

KG, Vamsee:  So I guess then, the development of each site should just
go on in parallel, and the fittest one will last longest. :)

KG:  The beauty of the code (and of the site) is of primary importance
if you actually want people to work on it.  But then I can understand
if you look at this from the other end.  I'd reduce all my complaints
to not being able to run it on my machine.  I don't have the 'media'
files.  If they are part of the repo, and doing a `manage.py
runserver' actually brings up the site as it is on localhost:8000 ...
then it would be easy to start working on it.  The other issues are
trivial and can be fixed in an hour.

Vamsee:  Glad you'll look at the design, KG's approach of throwing
curses and colors at a page while interesting isn't the most pleasing.
:)

I have some time today and tomorrow, can look-see if I get the files.

please look at the installation notes and download the media files. The media 
is dependent on jquery, jquery-ui, tiny_mce and blueprint. These are all 
css/js files maintained by third parties and should not be bundled with the 
app. I have several apps on the server dependent on these - they are all 
checked out from svn/hg heads and suitably symlinked to sitemedia/css and 
sitemedia/js as the case may be. Surely you do not expect me to bundle these 
with the app? that would be needless duplication and a nightmare to maintain. 
The paths can be seen in addreport.html, addevent.html and base.html. All you 
need to do is to check them out and symlink them to the css/js directories. 
Same for postgres/sqllite - I use postgres in production (and in testing) but 
you are not compelled to so - modify your settings.py to use sqllite.

please note that django is platform neutral - and third party neutral. The 
platform, css and jscript frameworks, the database and webserver are not built 
in into django - it is up to the person running it to choose these components, 
install them and fit django and the application to them. That said, it is a 
given that the most difficult part of getting a django app to run is the media. 
Most people find it difficult to get the paths right. This is intentional. It 
means that the app is actually media agnostic, and one can plug in one's 
favourite js, css, sql engines at will and run the app. It also means that one 
can keep site wide library files - and keep them up to date without going to 
each and every application and updating the dependencies there.

I could, of course, make a tarball (or a live cd) bundling all these things, 
and also linux. postgresql, python, PIL, reportlab and a million other things 
in the application to make it run 'out of the box' - but I have other things 
to do. People in my lab have succeeded in checking out the app and getting it 
to run on runserver without too much fuss - all it needs is the proper 
attitude - when things do not work, is the author of the application an idiot? 
or am I not doing things correctly?

judicious use of firebug in your browser will help you to debug your media 
woes. As I said above, install the media and check your symlinks and your 
paths.

btw, you do not even need to call the database 'ilugc' or the database user 
'lawgon'. I appreciate your effort in trying to contribute to the code, but am 
less than happy with the request for spoonfeeding in setting up the app for 
testing/development. And if you find this messy, please look at the code for 
the conference app for inpycon. And if you find *that* messy and difficult to 
install, go look at dougn's code for pycon website itself ... the first 
commandment for code is that it should work, the second commandment is that it 
should do what is expected of it - all other things are secondary. There is 
always time to tidy up and make the output pretty. But before doing that, ask 
whether it works. Then optimise and factorise to your hearts content.

Okay, looks like I got your goat, didn't think it was
possible or I would have been more circumspect.  So let me
start off by saying I meant no offence, not in the past and
not in the future in my discussions related to this website.
But politeness only makes it more difficult to talk about
things, so please don't be offended at the following
remarks, as it's just a fast technical response to the
website.  If you actually are offended I hope I can make
amends by buying you a cuppa coffee when we meet at the
Pycon in September.  :)

So, then now I can call out your bullshit.

1.  all files which the projects depends on should be in the
    repository.  Because:

    a.  it's totally irrelevant whether you use these files
        for other projects, or if it would break things on
        your computer.  I don't care and neither does
        anybody else.

    b.  anyone setting up the code on their machine should
        be able to run it by just cloning the repository.

    c.  if and when you do upgrade the third party
        libraries/themes, you will have to add a note to the
        commit log saying you did upgrade them and for what
        reason.

    d.  even binaries like images should be in the
        repository, what shouldn't be in the repository are
        generated files like the .pyc ones ... use .hgignore
        to ensure that they don't show up in your hg st
        commands.  Add the .hgignore to the repository.

2.  the app is not media agnostic, the app is what people
    see on the website, so it's pointless to say that this
    way it is flexible because if someone is playing with
    new images/styles/colors, they try that out and push you
    an update/patch.

3.  I already have it running using sqlite3 on my machine,
    and the default settings.py in the repository should be
    the same too, so that people don't have to install
    and/or configure postgresql on their machines.  Python
    2.6 comes with SQLite and that means that that is the
    most obvious choice for having in the repository.

4.  People in your lab might have high pain thresholds from
    working with crappy software, but that doesn't mean that
    you inflict that on the world at large.  If there is a
    simpler way to do it, then you better give a technical
    reason why you wouldn't want to do that.

5.  Code never gets clean in time.  It either is clean from
    the start with a conscious effort to keep it that way or
    it stays messy.  I say this now, because it can still be
    done.  Six months from now the only option will be to
    start over from scratch.

6.  A more delicate flower than me would have wilted under
    the charge of spoonfeeding, but that's not what I want,
    what I want is to work on the site without having to
    wade around in ankle deep ... muck, lets say.

7.  I can work with django/firebug, so thanks but no thanks
    on the pithy unhelpful advice, also when a coworker
    points out that your work is messy, it's not very useful
    to say that 'but see, my earlier work was messy too, and
    others have messy work too'.

My two cents, please feel free to disagree, but please don't
walk away with your ears plugged saying 'nanananana...'.

Roshan

PS: remember the coffee is on me, take a deep breath and
     flame me if you must, but don't get all upset. :)

PPS: the site doesn't work, another friend tried to create
      an account and failed.

PPPS: I can add the media files to the app at my end and get
       hg to ignore them, but I'd rather do that only if I'm
       sure that you aren't going to add all dependencies to
       the repository.

Hi !

Interesting !

Looks like both have problems !

I understand B&B (Bala & Bbhrathi site) site is based on Drupal.
Drupal is a open source project with a huge community.
Why there is a complaint about source code ?

What is wrong with it ?


Cheers

Mind if I suggest something? Every subscriber to ilugc is listed here
with their email address:
<http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/roster/ilugc>. The perfect tool for
this job is the Condorcet Internet Voting Service:
<http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/civs.html>. Using the user roster, send
each voter a unique key to the poll on CIVS. Then wait a week, close the
poll, and look at the results. As a bonus, since it uses a method more
sophisticated than a simple plurality, it makes the voting that much
more fun. As a second bonus, you can view the source if you want.

Dear KG,

I hope that isn't really your reply to the points I raised,
so let me wait another day for you to have a _technical_
rebuttal to my email.

PS: In OOPSLA '97 Alan Kay said that HTML on the Internet
was "maybe what happens when physicists decide to play with
computers" so if that's your only reply then I guess I know
what happens when lawyers toy with computers.

Hi All,

As of now, we are not in position to decide the main site. So, for
the time being, I requested KG and MBala to move both sites to
demo.ilugc.in / demo.ilugc.org.in. Use a HTML+CSS page (send
separately) as the index page and maintain the link to both sites.

Let us focus on our next public event SFD 2009 and decide the
internal issue later.

Bye :)

Subject: [Ilugc] FOSS and the Digital Divide - Reducing it one phrase a time
Message-ID: <64160c70908231413y42d0fb43g2aaa4fb7f77a5730@mail.gmail.com>

Wikipedia says that the "Digital Divide" is the gap between people
with effective access to digital and information technology and those
with very limited or no access at all. You should think of this word
whenever you feel great about "Technology being an enabler". The
Digital Divide is an essential roadblock to that dream. For,
technology can't be a true enabler unless it is in reach of everyone.
So what is reach? Reach is not about being able to purchase a
technology. I know for sure that even an auto-wallah can purchase a
cell-phone and benefit from technology, but I'm sure many can't reach
my blog even though many have enough money to avail a cyber-cafe for
an hour. It isn't more than Rs.20/hr if I am correct. That alone
doesn't ensure whether they can utilize it well or not. This is where
Digital Divide comes into picture.
Now coming to the software side of it. We all have observed that
majority of all software that we've ever since, was either in English
or in some other major languages in use, but not in our own. There are
reasons for that, if a software company A wants to push their product
B into the French market, only then would they bother about spending
resources on its French translation. Business is not always about
doing good for others. McDonalds won't change just because your kids
have grown obese eating they burgers with extra cheese.
Something similar happens in a closed-source proprietary software
scenario too. Consider this example - You purchase a software X for
$YYY.YY, no cut that, you get a closed-source shareware for free and
the license says that "you're free to share it with anyone, provided
you retain the copy of this license... bla bla". That's just half of
the story. Think a little more over the sharing part, you will realize
that you can share it only with a fraction of people. The fraction
that understands the languages that software X supports. Maybe you got
it for free. Maybe you thought you were free to share it with others.
But all that freedom was so incomplete!
But FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) on the other hand solves this
problem in a very practical manner. It invites people to make changes
to it, so as to suit their needs. Code being open source, you're
always free to midify and customize to great extents. To that, many
people reply back with this - "Okay, so the average Joe still can't
get this working in his own language for his non-english cousins."
Well, friends that's a question fair enough, but one thing I learnt
from my experiences is that you should not deny anything unless you've
thoroughly explored its deniability.
Let me show you how easy it is to translate a free software to your
language, even if you're an average Joe. All you'll ever need is some
free time to do something good, to bring a change in the world of
many. Enter Launchpad.net - An open source code hosting and software
collaboration platform by Canonical Ltd. It lets developers and yeah
not just them but everyone collaborate over software projects and
improve them, be it bug tracking, be it translation, feature request,
anything at all. So in this context we would take a look at the
translation part. Here's the tour for it which gives an overview -
https://launchpad.net/+tour/translation
Let's say you're running Ubuntu as I do, and happen to use 'GNOME Do'
a lot. Wouldn't you like to make it easy to use for people of your
native language?
First, make an account on http://launchpad.net. Once done, head on to
https://translations.launchpad.net/ and search for "GNOME Do". This
would take you to translation page for GNOME Do -
https://translations.launchpad.net/do/+translations
You can see an informative report on what progress on translation has
already been made in different languages. Look for any untranslated
entries in your language, click on the language to contribute.

I will take Hindi as an example. So once you've selected the language,
you're presented with a list of required translations. The English for
is presented on the top, below you have other suggestions submitted
previously by users. Now the beauty of collaboration comes out when
Launchpad suggests translations from other projects. That is, there
are some commonly used words like "Close", "Open" etc, Launchpad is
intelligent enough to pull off their Hindi translations into
suggestions list for me. There's a big difference in outright
crowdsourcing and crowdsourcing done right in Launchpad's way. You can
also mark a suggestion for review if you're unsure of anything.
Okay one important aspect I forgot to talk about, how do I type in my
language, I use English usually as I happen to know it? As for Hindi,
you can use Google Indic to type out and Shabdkosh to find definitions
you're unsure of. However a smarter method, which works for any
language, was suggested by a friend - SCIM (Smart Common Input
Method). Checkout Ubuntu Community Documentation for SCIM to know
more. or just do a 'sudo apt-get install scim'
That's it, by going one phrase a time you've actually contributed into
translation of a project which is used my many people, and in fact by
your efforts yet many more people are going to use it! After sometime
your Launchpad profile would show an increase in your Karma ranking
and show your contributions in "Most Active in" heading.
Amazing isn't it, instead of sitting idle and getting bored you can
actually help free software and your own community, even if you aren't
a geek.
All the best.

cool - let people contribute to both sites - no harm in having duplicate 
details. As I have already made it clear, when .in site is fully functional 
and stable I would have no problems pointing the domains in my control there. 
But I have to be convinced of the functionality and stability.

ilugc does not have a server - you have to demo on your own server

Sorry. I didn't convey the message the properly. Let me try 
once again :)

1. Move the present site to demo.site
2. Make the HTML page as the index page for ilugc.in and 
   ilugc.org.in. From this page, link to demo.site. Is it 
   possible??

I don't want to give the demo.site as our site name.

Hi !

Do you mean a static "jump" page which has links to the two (or more)
demo sites ?

What I mean is, the both site should use same html page, which I send
it to them. So that, new person will not know the difference and (s)he
can also goto any of the demo site using the links available in the 
page.

Hi !

I would like to know if there are students willing to take up
developing a social networking site using Drupal.
I understand that Drupal has nice modules which can be used to develop
social networking site .

http://www.packtpub.com/build-social-networking-website-with-drupal-6/book#indetail

I can provide all resources , any amount of server space and root
access for the students to work on. They can convert it to their final
year project  if they want.

Cheers

Nice, but in the interests of the students, it will be good to have 
these questions answered too:

1. Will this be a paid project?

2. What is the end goal of this project? 
Commercial/Personal/Organizational? Will the code be released with an 
open source license?

3. If they 'convert' it into their final year project, will you give 
them the necessary documentation to prove so (to their HODs or whoever)? 
Under what authority?

Yes . In case the work is production worthy .they can maintain the
production version of the site if the want and take it up as their
part time job !

I think I should classify as personal .
 Students are free to do whatever they want with the code.
I think the work involved is only , an opportunity to work with a
production site , testing out various Drupal modules and make sure
they work. If at all any original work is done students will have all
the credit. And they can do whatever they want with it no strings
attached. It will remain truly open source in spirit and content.

Yes . In fact there are other projects like this running with student
power and I have given letter to the institute saying they are taking
part in this project. I am very pleased with the progress and more
than anything else the enthusiasm and energy exhibited by the
students. I also understand the limitations of students like time ,
regular studies , Internet access etc.

Dear Luggies,

We have finalised the volunteer for  SFD from Jaya FOSS Club.
The demo stalls we have planned are
1. Scientific Python Packages.
2. Various CMS tools

If we get some more stalls, the options are,

3. Educational tools
4. Open Source RDBMS Tools
5. IDE's

We have planned for two technical talks. The topic will be intimated within
couple of days.

Apart from that we are sending 10 non technical volunteer for other works.

We are very sorry that we are not able to participate large in number. We
have planned the SFD celebrations on the same day in our college premises.
We are on the process. Students have already started preparing for that.

With regards,

The problem lies in theme. AFAIK ilugc.in is not using drupal core theme. I
have not seen any drupal core theme coming along with suckerfish dropdown
menu. So it is not the problem with drupal. Correct me if i am wrong.

A request. These sites are our public face and content must be
factually/ grammatically correct.

I know not everyone may have been schooled in exacting grammar and
even those who are good make mistakes as the mind moves faster than
fingers. Some folks taking the onus of verifying these will help. This
is a touchy matter and taking askance is easy. So this needs people
who meet face to face occasionally to put out any flares.

Why do I say this?
www.ilugc.in has some grammatical errors. I see almost the same
content in .org.in with these errors rectified.

done - exactly as you have sent - I would suggest that you put this content on 
some repository so that we can check it out. That way the content will be 
*exactly* the same.

Subject: [Ilugc] Mirroring the Ubuntu repositories
Message-ID: <1251181416.3495.0.camel@mjolnir>

Hi, everyone,

It's rather hard to use Ubuntu in college because the insti connection
is incredibly slow. I would like to mirror the Ubuntu amd64 repositories
(main, restricted, universe, multiverse) on my own hard disk in such a
way that it can be added as a repository by my friends over the LAN and
used.

A little searching has led me to apt-mirror, debmirror and using rsync
to mirror. Unfortunately, most documentation is from early 2007 and I
don't know if everything listed is entirely accurate. rsync is pretty
much out of the question since I intend to only mirror the amd64
repositories, but I'm not sure which among apt-mirror and debmirror is
better to use. Since the repositories are some 30 GB in size, I can't
just try both and see.

I have a few questions:

1. Which of the two methods should I use? 
2. Is there modern documentation for both programs or has the usage not
changed?
3. I will be checking with a couple of local internet caf?s to see if
they will download this for me. How much would be a good rate?
4. Is there an alternative way of obtaining these repositories with
versions available now? Perhaps someone has already done this?
5. Can DVD repositories be converted in a simple manner to a single
repository?

Hi,

You can get the ubuntu repositories in 5-6 DVDs from www.zyxware.com

You can copy all the contents of 6 DVDs into a folder and create local
repository.

Ah, this is very convenient. However, the website has no such
information on it. None of the tabs at the top link to any sort of page
where I could order. If you are familiar with these people, do you
happen to know if the repositories are up-to-date?

Plz add the education tools with SciPy. As we expect more general 
public, the education tools (particularly for children) are more 
suitable/ attractive.

"best" is subjective. There are many options available, you may try the
one that suits you. The link I provided is still very much valid.

Absolutely, Immanuel, I never intended to mean that it wasn't. Thank you

It seems like you've assigned 2 IP addresses to the same ethernet
card. Is sshd bound to both these IP addresses?

In future, please communicate clearly the current configuration by
appending outputs like ifconfig.

What you mean by working and not working? Is it Ping or Link failure?

Are you accessing the 67..59 from the server or different machine??

Where is eth1?

It is not even recognized by the kernel I think.

You seem to be trying advanced ssh stuff instead of basic commands
like ping , netstat and so on.

Please approach the problem step by step.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <135dba0908250317w6bf634f7x884c16a782da010b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have been experimenting with Debian clusters and am stuck with the
following scenario:
We have a dhcp/dns server assigning IP addresses to a few hundred
clients based on their
mac addresses. Under this I want to use a subset of the system and
designate one as the
master and four other systems as slaves. I want the master to assign
IP addresses to the
slaves at certain times and the main dhcp server at other. I have
already set up bind and
DHCP on the master.  However, the main DHCP server overrides the
master. How do I
temporarily assign new addresses to the slaves?

Note: Once i have removed the local IP and changed to public IP 67.201.12.59
for some reason . Then i have changed to 10.10.10.115 back.

So currently i have IP Address has : 10.10.10.115

I have done two test to solve .

Test 1
when i do following command
ssh 67.201.12.59 [Note : I have accessed from another server . but in same
network ]

it goes to 10.10.10.115 server.

Test 2
I have assigned 67.201.12.59 to another and restarted network, it says
"67.201.12.59 is already in use "

Test 3

I have ping 67.201.12.59 from same network it pings but when i ping from
desktop system (i.e from another network ) there is no response.

Further , i thought there could cache in arp . but i did not found
67.201.12.59 in it.

what to do further ?

Use arping -b 67.201.12.59

If 2 machine having same IP, then you will get replied with 2 mac.
Using the MAC, you can find the exact machine.

After login, get the mac address and check it is same as server mac.

This may be a routing issue.

1. I think html mails get converted to text by mailman. I do not see
any red text.
2. Please issue arping and ping from another machine in the network
(not the machine having the IP 67.201.12.59) and give the output.

This machine is still holding the IP 67..59 for eth0. I hope, IP 
10..115 is set for eth1.

hi,
I am using PerlMagick to automate image resizing and resampling. The
problem is that every time I try to use one of the Image::Magick
functions, Perl crashes. Here is an example of the code I am trying to
run:

use Image::Magick;

$image = Image::Magick->new;

open(INPUT,"abc.jpg" )
$image->Read( file=>\*INPUT);
close INPUT;

$image->resize( geometry=>'300x400', support=>'.2' );

open( OUTPUT, "out.jpg" );
$image->Write(file=>\*OUTPUT, filename=>'out.jpg');
close( OUTPUT);
undef $image;

__END__

When run, this code causes a "Perl Command Line Interpreter has
encountered a problem and needs to close" window
and terminal get struct ,then I force Quit the program,,

Thanks and Regards

This means the same card has been assigned both the addresses. The
secondary address eth0:1 also must show up in ifconfig. Am surprised
that is not seen. Maybe, like Raman said, network manager may be the
culprit. I've not seen such behaviour earlier. But then, I've used
self packaged minimal linux for such use and so am unaware of nuances/
surprises one might see in some distributions.

Don't bother with file handles, just pass the filename and let

Run "perl -d foo.pl" for debug mode.  You can step
through the code and identify where exactly it's failing.

Hi,

How are the logs in /var/log/httpd/* and /etc/httpd/logs/* linked.

Both the logs contain the exact same information and are updated in the same
manner,
Neither is a symlink of the other,
Inode count for both shows 1.

and yet, they do not contribute to the filesystem size as two separate
files. Say the file size of error_log in /etc/httpd/log/ is 50G. The same
file in /var/log/httpd also displays 50G, however the / filesystem shows
only 65G.

Regards,
Ashish

I suggest to use bitttorent for download or You can use *wget* or *proz*command
If your donwload get inturrup you can append "-c" to wget so it will
continue from the past
*$ wget -c http://file.iso*

Do rsync support "-c" type argument ??

This was first time happening in my college SASTRA university that there was
any fedora camp.

The camp was organized by me (Pankaj kumar), Nishanti, Anurag Jain, Sanjeev
Gopinath,and J.Dwarak.The response was very good and all became happy when
we distributed fedora 11 dvds and stickers.
The session was started at 11.00 am by Nishanti (the host of the event) who
described the agenda for the event and the Dwarak started his seminar on
OPEN SOURCE and LINUX. He told what OPENSOURCE is and connected it to the
corporate world. After that I came and explained about FEDORA , Fedora
subprojects, and then features of fedora. Anurag told the installation of
fedora and demonstrated some softwares. Sanjeev took FEDORA ELECTRONIC LAB
and he explained how one can design electronic board using fedora electronic
lab. While he was explaining I designed basic AND gate in DIGITAL DESIGNER
and simulate that. I felt very excited while doing that.Then  Sanjeev
explaining C/C++ and JAVA coding which was complied by me. Anurag gave very
important links to the audience which is very helpfull after first time
fedora installation. At the end of Sanjeev?s session we demonstrated GNOME
Desktop features and COMPIZ, audience were very excited to see these all. At
the end we distributed fedora 11 DVDs and stickers and then we end the
session at 1.30pm . At the end of session we had party for organizers [image:

The logs aren't a symlink, but  the directories are. /etc/httpd/logs
is a soft link to /var/log/httpd

If you backed up your ~ folder, then it should be in it: ~/.gnupg/

Message-ID: <b89799040908250759r58336a8cjd6033313b0df2842@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a linux installation on a physical machine. The filesystem has been
created on 320GB of disk. I want to create a image of it and create a copy
of the system. How can I do that, the second disk I have is 80 GB. I have
tried partimage, it backs up only the used space, however when recreating,
it requires the original space. Is there any other way.

If you have good internet connectivity, you can download the whole

Use gtar or cpio to make a single image file of your 320GB file system.

Partition the 80GB disk and run mkfs to create a new and empty
file system.

Use gtar or cpio again to extract the files back.

Assuming it is a data partition with ext2/3, you can use dump/restore...

If it is a OS partition, you need to sweat it out.. use rescue mode..
create partitions, restore data .. install grub.. hopefully system is
back up if you do everything properly..

You could do this as well.. the only difference would be that tar/cpio
would update the atime of all the files on your old system.

I normally use this command with rsync for backups (recursive).

$ rsync -avzp --delete (source-dir) (dest-dir)

Different UNIX commands support different arguments and there is no commonality
between them.

In fact there is no equivalent commandset found in UNIX at all.

You can download with rsync, wget, ftp, curl or any other command line client.

But the resume feature that you are asking is either absent in certain
cases or implemented
differently.

I also use lftp or ncftp for downloading.

rsync is not a download tool. It is a delta transmission tool. By
delta is meant file changes.

It also doubles up as a download tool and it has resume feature built
into the rsync rolling
checksum algorithm.

Okay now this is the best question I have read in ilugc in ages. ;)

And I should thank you for reminding me of this excellent program
though I had to
comment out the section  which did the "Segment" effect.

I am talking about this script.

http://www.imagemagick.org/source/examples.pl

And the bug in your program is that you are using 'resize' instead of 'Resize'.

Also a useful perl command is 'perl -c foo.pl'.

It is a compiler that will tell you about warnings and errors in the syntax.

People think that interpreted languages are never compiled. It is not true.

Perl is first compiled and then only interpreted. And every
interpreted language has to
work that way.

You are welcome to put the stall (please do not imagine stalls like expos held in star hotels - it will be open air - table+chair only type).

There is no procedure. You are putting it, go ahead and prepare for it.
We prefer you to come with laptop. If not please let us know hardware
requirements.

Greetings,

There is a requirement of Samba server with the following specification:

There are two groups: Designers, Draftsmen

The share folder hierarchy is Project-->Final

Now the Designers groups should have rw rights for Projects and subfolders

The draghtsmen should be able to upload only files (not folders) to
Final subfolder. They are not allowed to modify/delete anything
anywhere.

any ideas?

Thanks and Regards

This answer may not be direct and to the point.

Windows has notions of two security levels(User and Share). And
samba follows the same model. And of course you have the normal
UNIX restrictions of chmod(1). You have chattr(1) also which may help.

Basically you should deny write permission to groups in the
subfolders under Project and grant write permissions only for
Draughtsmen and Designers.

You should follow a set theory model in mathematics and find out
unions and intersections in such matters.

To start with you should state the problem statement clearly.

Once you decided the topic, 20% work is over. Next 30% work is to
prepare for the topic. Next 50% work is, demo + explain the concept to
visitors.

To show the demo, we will provide a place with table and chair, in the
Birla Planetarium front covered corridor (acted as Air Port in many
budget movies). You need to bring your machine and show the demo.

If you need just resizing of images in a folder,

mogrify -resize 800x600 -verbose *.JPG


This will resize all the JPG files in the folder in a single go.

Have you tried "man scp" to find the answer to your question?  If not, 
please do so and then tell what you did and what failed.

I would have gone "Gah!", if I hadn't LOL-ed at this:
http://lawgon.livejournal.com/69159.html

1.  Nice to know you blog.
2.  "I will eviscerate you in fiction. Every pimple, every character
flaw. I was naked for a day; you will be naked for eternity." --
http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/A_Knight%27s_Tale#Geoffrey_Chaucer
Nicely done.
3.  That list is not all me, so I guess I don't have to point out that
it's not the end of the world if we don't work together on this.

Good work on the planet idea, never would have thought of it. :)

As you add more feeds to the Planet, it will be better if the
hackergotchi is placed beside the blog post, or name. Or something
like this:
http://planet.freedesktop.org/
http://planet.fedoraproject.org/

We will require some CSS changes. Thanks for the quick turnaround time.

no turnaround - all that is needed is to add the line:
face = url/to/hackergotchi

css changes take time - I hate css

Hi ! Shakthi !

How is "planet" different from blogs and blogroll we find in wordpress
? and hackergotchi from avatars ?

Planet is a software you can find in http://planetplanet.org. It is web
aggregate of RSS feeds. Many free and open source projects use it. You
can find a long list in the above website as well.

Since this discussion has not died yet perhaps this will add some spice.

ImageMagick is good very heavy. You have GraphicsMagick which I have never used.

Thank you very much. I see that all CMS have modules /plugins etc for
adding blogroll or feed aggregator . This adds a social networking
flavor to the site.

Subject: [Ilugc] XPCOM with XUL - Regarding
Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP7CFAB901414555BA077DD98F70@phx.gbl>

Dear All,

		I am developing a plugin for firefox browser. I need to access the hardware plugged in the client system. 
I have a plan to user XPCOM to interact between the browser and my hardware. I have achived this in Windows using the ActiveX 
technology. I have give how i have done this in Windows below

        
In Windows.
          I have created a activex dll which will be registered in the 
client's computer. Whenever the user go to my web application page, in 
the button click event i will create object for my activex component and 
i will call a function in the dll. I used VS 6.0 for development.  
Inside that function i have created a dialogbox and show  that dialog 
box to the user. It is a modal dialog box. The Internet Explorer will be 
the parent window for my dialog. To get the Internet Explorer window 
handle, i used GetForegroundWindow() function avaible in the Win32 API. 
Once i get the IE' window handle, i will set this handle as my parent 
window of my dialogbox. Now  I need to achive this in Linux.

In Linux :

          XPCOM is the equivalent for the ActiveX. I am able to create a 
.so file using XULRunner SDK and able to call the function via firefox 
browser. I have created a small function which will return  a string to 
the calling function. Every thing is working fine. Now the next step is, 
I need to create a dailogbox inside my function, and need to show my 
dialogbox as a modal window of the firefox browser. To create dialogbox 
i am using the KDevelop IDE. Is there any function like 
GetForegroundWindow like in Win32API for Linux? Hope now you understand 
my problem.

           In linux i am using wxWidgets to develop the dialog box. But 
when i create dialogbox object, my brower is terminated. Please help me 
to resolve this issue.

Thanks & Regards
Sundaram. D

Do not much but suggest to run firefox in debug mode/ developer mode (if
possible, you need to check it out) or may be run firefox from command line
to get actual problem in logs !!

I think this would be better !! (why to have dependancy of other widgets
when firefox can do same with XUL) but I have use XUL with addon and not
with plugin, So do not know how a plugin will use XUL. I think MDC has
tutorial on plugins too and check if there is any open source plugin
available , you can read source code of that plugin to get quick idea !!

1. the draghtsmen should have Write only and no delete/modify
permission for _files_ (only) in "Final" folder
2. the draghtsmen should not have permission to upload _folders_ to
"Final" folder



I know it is possible for (1.) -- a WORM (write once read many) folder
I am clueless about 2.

hope it is clearer

When you try to add something over Firefox -- You have XUL , (Ex addon)
but when you want to add something beside (side by side) in Firefox-- you
can code in your pref language, (Ex plugin)
one is vertical and other is horizontal !! (just a view) !!

    Here my situation is little bit complicated  that when i show the 
dialog box to the user, i have to start the fingerprint scanner in the 
background once the user place the his/her fingerprint image in the 
scanner, i need to show the fingerprint image to the user and then need 
to close the dialogbox
    
    I have planned to use the XUL to show the dialog box and XPCOM to 
interact with the scanner and get the image from the scanner. I have API 
to get the image from the scanner and my part is to show the captured 
image to the user and close the dialog box.
 
    Here i don't know how to do this. :-(
    I don't know whether it is possible to do  ?
    If it is not possible with XUL/XPCOM combination, then how can i 
achive this functionality?

 Please help me

Thanks & Regards
Sundaram. D

This is inappropriate here in this thread and amounts to hijacking
this thread. So start a new thread for your query with a relevant

Hi Narendra,

Here are the simple steps to start
1) Seek the permission from your HOD. This is needed when in future you need
space for conducting the meetings or to request spare computers for
demonstrations.
2) Find out the people(students or teachers) who are really interested in
FOSS (philosophically attached would be great).
3) Setup an online groups, like Yahoo groups, google groups.
4) Let other departments know about the group. Explain them the benefits of
FOSS and the tools available. Invite their staff for the meetings.
5) Gather few students from every department.
6) Conduct regular meetings/events.
7) Invite FOSS advocates/experts from other colleges. You will find a lot in
ILUGC.
8) If you are in final year, find out some one (junior) who can really take
forward the group in future. Nurture them.

Last but not least. Keep the group live and kicking. Starting the group is
not a thing, holding the spirits of the group is.

All the best.

Guru Prasath

On inetaddr, check:

1. If sshd daemon is running. You can check this using:

  $ ps -ae | grep ssh

2. Check if your firewall is blocking any SSH connections from output of:

   # iptables -L

3. Also check selinux status:

   $ sestatus

here are some general comment !!

before going to source code, you first need to know what exactly is the
software. After that you should know what technology and Model it use. --
** what API, What framework it use
** is it distributed or single code
At the same time i you generate documentation of software using doxygen --
Doxygen will generate all soft of files which are needed to explain the code
!! Doxygen is simple superb !!

for any software project !! Use eclipse or similar IDE , this will be a
great tool to explore the source code !!
How to use,
I like most "F3" button -- you can quickly open any class definition
i like "Ctrl +T" button -- It will open type hierarchy
I like "Ctrl +alt + H" -- this will open call hierarchy, using this you can
explore the call graph, a function is called from where.

After that you can use the software in debug mode in eclipse, You can put
breakpoint on code and run the software ,, you can see the flow inside code
!!  I deal with complex software for quickbug fixing and debug save my life
because it give me full idea how a code is behaving and running on system...

PS: i just said, Doxygen+Eclipse+Debug !!

Please, so many exclamations! They are not necessary. It is just noise

+x option and 755 are redundant so you give only either of them.
Otherwise the command will think that you are trying to give an
execute permission to a file named 755, which is not what you want.

Hi,

chmod can be used with numerical or modern notation.

you have tried with both.

try as

chmod +x rails-post-deploy

or

chmod 755 rails-post-deploy

Quoting from the man pages of 'chmod', its syntax is
chmod [options] [mode] file(s)/folder(s)

Here in the command you tried +x is also an usage of the mode and 755
too is. Since you have given +x first, it will try to apply +x
permissions to whatever file(s)/folder(s) that follow and it finds 755
and hence the error.

Thank you.

Emacs or Vim with ctasgs is ideally suited for this task. Here is a
short description for Emacs:

The manual pages have detailed help.

I have a way of reading the source. It is logical and I use it when I use
sources myself.

Have 3 windows.
1) An editor of your choice in the folder that you want
2) A file manager
3) cscope

I generally tile this up into the editor as one half screen, cscope top right
and mc bottom right(NOTE: Unnecessary info)

By trial and error, I find the list of files that do not depend on
non-standard headers.
I read the sources in them and then use cscope to find out where the functions,
structures and macros are used.

Then I find out the file that has least fan-in. Preferrably, only the
header/files that I
already reviewed.

Slowly, the entire source is covered.

Ashok `ScriptDevil` Gautham

P.S. This might not be the best method. An alternate is to start at
the main file
and then navigate down using cscope to find the declarations. But I
find that makes
me dizzy since I get distracted often :P

ctags with vim. I don't use cscope anymore.

$ ctags -R *

$vim foo.c

Press C-] to go to a definition of function or structure. You can come
back by pressing
C-T.

You can also search for tags by :tagsearch /foo

Anyway this article will help.

scp and ssh use the same wirte protocol but sftp uses a different protocol but
uses the same pipe that ssh sets up.

So all will work if you can connect to the ssh port.

$ nc -v inetaddr 22

will tell you if you can connect. netcat is king as always. ;)

You cannot give space between address and path.

$ scp filename username@ipaddr:/path

You can leave aside the path and it will go to home directory, but
colon is critical.

The best way to learn how source code of a project works, is to tinker
with the source code.

* The first thing you should do is just build the source, run it and
see how to use the software. This is important to know how to test it.

* Choose a module or file that you want to go through, and then use
some prints, or try adding small code, or change variables, and see
how it affects the application when it is run.

* Source code browsing helps in analyzing the above test results, and
to understand control flow of the application.

* Try to use buffer-based editors like vim/Emacs, and avoid using IDEs
that heavily use the mouse. You should focus more on the code, rather
than intuitive GUIs that distract your attention with the mouse.

* I use GNU Emacs + etags + Emacs code browser (optional):

I do no think so,
when someone deal with big chunk of code, IDE are really very useful. I
never faced any distractation with mouse.

You do have markers on 'F' and 'J' keys on your keyboard, so you know
where to place your fingers on the keyboard when you return from the
mouse.

Sure, they can be used when you use buffer-based editors as well, but,
you never move away from those references.

You could remove those markers, and try using an IDE :)

Exactly.

And you should know a lot about Makefiles too. That is key.

Please learn soon. The GNU info manual is very very long. It is comprehensive
but very boring.

The OpenBSD manpage is also comprehensive but short. But then BSD make
is quite different from GNU make.

And things get complicated a bit more.

But makefiles are a powerful concept and you have to know. Even if you do
Windows programming with Cygwin or MingW.

\--

I would like to add that there are two types of documentation that one
should learn to work with:

* HOWTOs: start from A, for example, and finish at B. So, if one wants
to accomplish B, one has to follow the HOWTO step-by-step, strictly.
Examples are tldp.org, blog posts.

Newbies usually skip some steps in between, and get stuck somewhere
between A and B, and call for help. Learning to backtrack, and verify
that one has completed the mentioned steps in order is also essential
in learning to debug, or see where things have failed. Yes, debugging
is an art!

* Manuals: One need not read a manual like a novel. It is only meant
for reference, and one can always refer a particular topic or section
within a manual. Examples are man, info pages.

Both HOWTOs and manuals are useful in accomplishing a task, but,
knowing how to use them, as mentioned above, is essential.

Look at the logs. Do a

$ netstat -n -t

and check.

Look at syslog and /var/log/messages.

Logfiles are the greatest debugging aids.

You are right of course.

There can be no doubt that references like dictionaries cannot be read.

But I usually read things from top to bottom. I read several literature on spam
while preparing for my Ilugc talk that I gave in IIT two years ago.

I prepared for close to 8 months for that. I read everything I could read.

And from top to bottom. Many people don't do that. They read bits and pieces
here and there and want quick success.

(Though I already had close to 8 years experience in those fields by then)

That was not enough.

I don't think there is any quick success in this world. Everything takes time.

Learn Tamil in 30 days may be a good title and eye catchy but it is not at all
practical.

And by the way it is this training that got me started on to spam control. And
today I have a product that I developed for more than two years. Everything
takes time.

We live in an era when knowledge  forms the raw material out of which we
cook using sheer dint of hard work, industry, advice from people and create
dishes that taste good after several months and years of toil.

Check this URL,  I hope it could help you.

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/too-many-connections.html,

set, higher value  to the configuration variable max_connections. Then
restart your MySQL.

FYI.

Too many connections should not happen.

If you are developing some web applications in PHP or any other language,
suggest your developer to close the mysql connections after the usage.

Or suggest them to use any good framework for development.
that will take care of closing unused connections.

First check whether tomcat is running @ 8080 port. Second check that you
have any application installed under your webapps folder. With the default
tomcat setting it always serve ROOT application under webapps.

Dear Rajesh,

Please send the output of

# cat /var/log/apache/error.log

Your Apache may be somewhere else.

Also check if tomcat is running with pgrep. Setting jdk path in /etc/profile is
just one step.

Tomcat has access to Apache logs? I didn't know that. Afaik, 
Tomcat-related logs are in its' own logs directory,  and all 
errors/warnings/info get logged to catalina.out.

As far as the OP's actual question goes, see if you have set JAVA_HOME 
environment variable in your .bashrc, and it points to your jdk install. 
Tomcat normally won't start if it can't find JAVA_HOME. If that is fine, 
check catalina.out or localhost.log in the logs directory for other 
possible errors.

Vamsee.

You could try installing with Wine, I suppose. That said, the problem 
space isn't as easy as it looks - the guy who implemented it has nearly 
10 years R&D experience on similar technologies. But yeah, something 
rudimentary along those lines should not be too hard to implement for a 
really bright student.

I dont want someone, who has a photo of mine, to be able to get into my 
computers :)

btw, sony have a demo s/w that is in Linux, iirc - that they run on the 
ps3's to show you how much faster it is than the intel dual and quad 
core cpu's. It basically will recognise faces as they go past a camera - 
and store some unique points of the face. When the same person comes 
around the ps3 is able to match the person. Even if the angle is slight 
off, or the person is walking in a different way - as long as the full 
face is visible at some point, it will make the ID then track the 
person. End of the day, you can get a log of people's movements.

Lets hope no one with any level of authority is reading this :)

consider using connection pools, if you can. I think almost any and

Face detection/recognition is one of the TOUGHEST problems in AI/Image Proc.
There is no ONE core solution for this.

A 2d recognition is of no use either, as pictures can be used. I remember
seeing some folks at JPL(Jet Propolsion Labs, NASA) do some work using a 3d
camera(depth perception) which did perform well. But this when i was working
on my algorithm for face recognition as my final year thesis (around
2003-04). It took me almost 2.5 years to present my algo , which worked well
only in a face image db. I can share some gyaan if someone is interested
(from whatever i remember, but no one asks Qs :P )

Facial recognition - Disadvantage of having photographs and getting
through the security.
Iris and retinal scans - You cannot use photographs to get through.
Read wikipedia articles on Biometric Scanning techniques.

There is a clear difference in the above techniques.

Off-topic but still.. Is there no ONE technology that could identify a human
being uniquely? I though retinal scanners work perfectly but the only
drawback in using iris scanners and retinal scanners is that excessive
exposure to that instrument could visually impair you or something like
that.

I have already done the same thing in python script which use
gnokii<http://www.gnokii.org>
.
All that needed is a mobile phone connected to the computer running a Linux
OS and the script running in the system.
Now, with even a basic mobile phone without even an internet connection to
the computer, the script does the thing. Also I have extended this to
'Mobile terminal' by which one can execute most of the commands in the
computer(Linux box) remotely without an internet connection.

2D face recognition algorithms face so many problems such as change of
lighting, facial features, profile etc. 3D recognition is showing some
promise, but its still an active research area, though some commercial
products are available

btw, you can extract the ratina from someone and use that to auth 
against - should the need arise and the task me of suiteable importance. 
however, asking someone for something that they and only they might know 
is something that is quite hard to duplicate unless that person tells you.

Sure, a subtle poke with the right sort of instrument in the right part 
of the person would mostly have that other person tell you what the 
password is - however, its still something they might opt out of :)

unlike an eye or a dna sample or finger or anything like that, which you 
can take even when the person in question has opted out.

(ok, back to watching Hostel, for me )

If you are interested in applying for the job described below, please email your resume to caiqs.jobs@citi.com with a subject line of ILUGC-firstname-lastname.

Last year one of the world's largest financial organisations constituted a highly-focussed internal business group which seeks to exploit advanced technologies in computation, data and finance for the purpose of out-performing in the global securities marketplace.   The group is envisioned to remain small and closely-knit with 2 main centers of operation, New York and Chennai, along with additional operational footprint in Europe.

Following on its strong performance since inception, the group is seeking smart people with very strong pragmatic computing skills and a solid engineering/science academic background to grow our Chennai center.

For computational requirements, candidates would have demonstrable experience on GNU/Linux, on which platform they would have written significant Python/Perl code with database interaction, or they would have coded multithreaded C/C++.

The selected candidate would be extremely hard-working and driven to excel.   Due to close collaboration across timezones between geographically remote team members to design, develop, test and deploy changes, the ability to communicate effectively and frequently via email is required.  All hires gain expertise in understanding and manipulating data.   They will also be ensuring the optimal and highly-performant operation of a multitude of interdependent streams of data manipulation and processing - activities that are deployed within the group's execution/data centers which are colocated at the world's major securities trading hubs.

All hires, regardless of background or focus will directly integrate and report into this global team.   Due to the group's points of trading presence in different time-zones, work at international hours will often be required, with a concentration around the trading hours across the Asia-Pacific exchanges, for which the Chennai team takes primary responsilibility.   Work will be challenging and individuals will be encouraged and mentored to grow in related subject areas that will have long-term benefit to the group.

Compensation will be superior, will recognize individual contributions and commitment, and will reflect the group's success.

Finger prints are unique, and scanners are < $20 and should
suffice for most cases.

If you want something more fancy, palm vein based biometrics
are far more accurate.  Has a false denial rate of 1/10,000 and
a false acceptance rate of 1 in a million.

Had the opportunity of working with both briefly.

Hi Ram,

Thats a right command to make it human readable use the below attached one

du -skh /var/lib/pgsql/

2.9G  in giga bytes

As far as tuning is concerned you can start with the default settings as 
the load increases we need to pray around the parameters. To do so you 
need to provide more information like what type of db you use innodb or 
MyISAM

Thanks
Sattish.


Thanks

that does not work either - I recall reading somewhere that lenny by default 
does not permit root jobs to run as cron

Did you put this entry for ilugc user? ie., by 'crontab -e' or by
editing file in '/etc/cron.d' folder.

I have crons run by planet user in one of debian lenny boxes just
fine. Also please check the permissions of planet.py file. You can see
cron runs in /var/log/syslog

Here is how my cron entry looks like,

I did it as root - it just does not run. In another lenny box I have:

0 * * * * /usr/sbin/apache2ctl restart

this also doesnt run - no log message, no error message

that is strange.. i haven't used any of lenny/debian systems before..
so not sure about the defaults..

here is what i would check..

1. cron.allow & cron.deny files for user access controls

2. /etc/pam.d/cron

3. is crond service running.

4. /etc/syslog.conf for checking the log config...

could you attach/paste them if they dont contain any confidential info?

0 * * * * cal >/tmp/dump 

works for me in lenny

For cron normally error message will be directed to mail. Look at root's mail.

It may be better to put error redirection as well like
0 * *  * * /home/perl/perlisthebest.pl 1>/tmp/output 2>/tmp/errors

to get better output.

Other thinks to look at

a.Environment variables normally available on login will not available
b.executable permission on the script

solved in both boxes. For apachectl:

cd /usr/sbin; ./apache2ctl restart

and for planet

0,5,10,15,40,41,50,51,52,57 * * * * cd /home/ilugc/planet/; ./planet.py 
examples/fancy/config.ini >> ./planet.log;

apparently cron is totally brain dead and needs to be spoonfed

hi,

my daughter is doing state board 12th - she has C++. It looks fairly advanced 
too. No doubt she will pass by mugging up everything and spouting it as 
expected in state board, but I thought she might as well learn the language 
too. Since I know zilch about C++ can luggies advise me on installing some

??? Why is that? Not to start off a discussion, but isn't totally fine
that the cron does not see any path by itself? Ok, I don't know a
reason why it shouldn't see a path though.

Well, I'm also a product of the same system but studied C in 11th and
Java in 12th. We had a wonderful teacher who taught us the principles
of programming too. The current syllabus was introduced the year after
I passed out, and prescribes C for 11 and C++ for 12. My brother is in
Class 12 too, the problem is they are using older C++, not the ANSI
version. And the books seems to touch on most parts without going in
depth. He however uses http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/ to learn
the language, and has problems with ANSI C++ and the traditional
syllabus C++. I don't know of any interactive tool, but Deitel's books
are really good for beginners, I used it in my 12th holidays to learn
C++.

Cron only executes the command as the user, it doesn't run .profile, .bash_profile etc., So it has no way of getting $PATH etc.

Looks like the interpreter is not too good, so won't teach her Standard C++.
Best for her would be to write little programs with g++ and learn.  I learnt
my OOPs from my elder brother's books, and I feel learning from books is the
best way to learn OOPs. Even in college, when I had a paper called Object
Oriented Programming, it didn't cover anything about the C++ Standard
Libraries, so in 12th standard, I doubt if it would be advanced.

Aren't there many Linux C++ programmers in Chennai or Bangalore. Is the
number considerably less than the number of Python programmers?  Why don't
we have a C++ programmers community like ChennaiPy or BangPypers for Python?

This web based interpreter looks really convenient. Paste your code and
click run, it shows errors if there are any, else runs and prints output.

I thought you would have taught her some Python by now! So she would
only need to "translate" from Python to C++ and then check for syntax
errors.

Are you sure that they are teaching standard C++? Often they teach
using one of the MS Visual C++ type systems and that is quite
different from using g++.

Otherwise, the tools already suggested sound nice.

Kapil.

What do OOP concepts have to do with C++ ?

Also the C++ STL is not based on OOP concepts. Read the interview with
the creator of the C++ STL at
http://www.stlport.org/resources/StepanovUSA.html

C++ is not that popular in any of the free OSs. Linus hates C++. The BSD
people also are not too keen on C++. Only Qt + KDE is in the C++ camp 
and what they use is a big subset of the language and not at all standard.

The language is complex (just compare the size of K&R and TCPL) and most
people never have the chance to learn the whole language. Also to
contribute to a project which is written in C++ you need to be familiar
with the style of C++ (C as C++, C with classes, generic programming, Qt
C++ etc.) it is using.

There is only one compiler which is usable (gcc) and even that does not
always implement the complete standard, breaks ABI compatibility often
and is pretty slow.

Isn't Python too high level when compared to C++ to do this ? Often 
Python programs are an order of magnitude consise than C++.

I would be quite happy if they had moved out of Turbo C++. I am often 
surprised by the number of people looking for conio.h for their C/C++ 
programs.

a very nice way to learn c/c++ would be to browse through the functions in a
header file...just like any other language once you know what the functions
do rest is just logic(which can be developed  by practising flow charts)

is apache2ctl part of cron commands?

why are u adding commands like cd in cron? put every thing in a shell script
say planet.sh.

put the path or what ever.

then add the cron job

0,5,10,15,40,41,50,51,52,57 * * * * /home/ilugc/planet/planet.sh

what do you think abt this?

When cron executes the command the user need not be logged into the box,
so his/her profile might not have been exported. Better to give absolute
path when writing commands inside cron

I wouldn't agree. If you want to enable the path, you can set it at
/etc/crontab and things should run fine else you can use the
absolute path and it wouldn't complain. It just wants us to work
hard!

Teaching tool .. hmm are there any programming teaching tools ?
Anyways that would be a nice project idea for ww.edu.kde.org

The nearest one in KDE is keduca .
http://edu.kde.org/keduca/ is an educational project to enable the
creation and revision of form-based tests and exams.
KEduca was abandoned for KDE 4.0 due to lack of maintainer. There was
a new start of KEduca in playground/edu but it is abandoned again.


Anyways the nearest tool would be to install Qt Creator which is a
New Cross-Platform Qt IDE . Learning to use that tool can be done via
these simple video playlist http://bit.ly/EytBk

I know this is a bit strange approach and most of this list members
will not agree on this way of learning .. well as a student I feel
this is the modern way to go .

@ Kenneth : what do you say ? :D

Dear kg,

google "c++ video lectures" .You will get lot of video lectures like
below ,tell her to watch  it. This one good way to teach herself.

1). http://idealprogrammer.com/languages/cc/introduction-to-c-stanford-video-tutorials-and-other-lectures/

2).http://freescienceonline.blogspot.com/2007/09/programming-language-video-lectures.html

3).http://www.torrentreactor.net/torrents/750971/3D-Buzz-introduction-to-C%2B%2B-(video)

4).http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nziy2_U5JQI

5).http://www.computer-training-software.com/fun-cplusplus.htm

you can find lot of very good video lectures on-line .

see also this site

6). http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Cpp/CatalogCpp.htm

it has lot of programs in C , C++ and explanations .

you can get collection of good on-line C++ books here
.
7).http://www.c4swimmers.esmartguy.com/c4sbooks.htm

The way to learn a programming is

1). Read the syntex and Rule
2). Take an example program
3). Type the code yourself. (please don't do copy paste work, it never help you)
While reading a tutorial or a book, it is often helpful to type - not
copy and paste (even if you can!)

4).Try to understatd each and every bit of the code.
5).Compile the program
5).If it throw error you are very very very lucky because you are
going to learn more.
6). Fix the error and compile it .
7). Execute the program and see the output. if output is expected. say
yourself very good.

Typing it yourself will help you to get used to the typical typing
errors that cause problems and it will force you to pay attention to
the details of programming syntax. Typing your program will also
familiarize you with the general structure of programs and with the
use of common commands. After running an example program - and after
making certain that you understand how it works - you should
experiment with it: play with the program and test your own ideas. By
seeing which modifications cause problems and which sections of the
code are most important to the function of the program, you should
learn quite a bit about programming.

 take another example repeat it.  This is the good way to learn any
programming language . installing some  interactive tool only helps to
become expert in that perticular tool, it never help to learn the
program.

Sorry for top posting...


If you need to run a cron job every 5 mins, use this cleaner version:

*/5 * * * * foo.sh

You can also specify ranges, eg 1-4. Man pages have more options.


Btw, cron is NOT brain dead!

Another good book is Object oriented programming in C++ by Robert
Lafore. Before going into the syntax and semantics of the language, it
would be good to have an understanding of Object oriented programming
concepts. Though an in-depth understanding of OOP concepts may be
heavy on a 12-th std student, a basic understanding may help her
understand the language better. Syntax can only be mugged up. The real
understanding comes through the concepts.

Sorry, but that is an atrocious book. Compared to what I had the 
privilege of learning from, the Lafore book is completely dry and 
lifeless. I'd recommend OP to get hold of this one from Cohoon & 
Davidson: http://www.mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780072560404.html. In my 
opinion, learning C++ from an OO perspective is absolutely essential, 
otherwise she might try to tackle it from a C perspective (if she knows 
it already) and miss the whole point. This book really gives a good 
grounding in OOP.

This book was the recommended one in college for us, and I used to love 
solving the exercises at the end of each chapter. Makes sure you really 
get your head around the concepts. Made Java a no-brainer for me after 
working through this :). Not everybody's  cup o tea, but I recommend you 
give it a shot, she might end up liking it.

Vamsee.

gtk_window_set_transient_for() can be used to set the parent window for a 
dialog. Get the parent window as an argument to funnydialog and use the
gtk_window_set_transient_for() to make it the parent window. 

gtk_window_set_modal() can be used to make a dialog modal.

Today , with the current high resolution scanners and image processing
techniques,
it is very much possible to identify a human being uniquely even against a
database of 6 billion biometric records.

Face has aging issue. ( the  template changes )
Retina biometric has diabetic retinopathy issue.
Iris biometric is the best. But finger print biometric is cost effective (
and equally good)

Biometric technology is used to  identify a human uniquely for immigration
verification /Visa processing in many countries now
and is a part of Unique ID card project and Rural employment guarantee
programs in India.

Can elaborated the technological possibilities and uses  off-list if anyone
is interested

(We make many biometric scanners and  image  processing application and
implemented it in many banks and e-gov projects throughout India.)

Ah well, to each his/her own! :) It is up to the concerned student to
decide which book works best for her.

As for learning OOP concepts, as I said before, a basic understanding
is essential, but then, as I had discussed in a previous thread
regarding syllabus, strictly speaking, a 12th std student generally
cannot fully grasp the nuances of programming, as, first of all, no
school student is really told(or, perhaps, its out of scope for school
students) what exactly a program is, in the first place! Understanding
programming paradigms, of which OOP is a part, only comes after
gaining this understanding. Many 12th std syllabuses don't even make
students aware that there are so many programming paradigms. So, my
humble opinion is that, it is not necessary to give too much stress on
OOP for her now. She apparently only has a rudimentary knowledge of
programming, so its ok for her at the time being to have a rudimentary
understanding of OOP. If at all she plans to specialise in Computer
Science, she has ample time to learn these concepts more thoroughly.

Hello guyz,

Kind request: Please do not top post,  avoid replying  to a digest thread
without trimming the contents...


For the last software freedom day , i believe we had a couple of banners,
which  i remember (vaguely) printed by ilugc iteself.

Banners are quite efficient in communicating about what we are doing there,
IMO, yes banners are required. Bharathi or Raaman will add their thoughts on
this.

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

Is it possible for you to add a "gallery" in this site  for adding

Banners: What I meant banners, was for publicity to public, telling
about the event. Banners at the stall were not discussed. I think
there should be no objection to putting college name as long as 
no commercial ads/campaigns are there.

Also I request this thread to be kept only for discussion about SFD.
The never ending topic of webiste feature can be in someother thread.
It is difficult for me to keep track who volunteered etc.

I  created a service pack of a package called 'ettercap' in my machine and
tried to install it some lab machines , but it failed as one of the
dependency  ettercap-common was not available inside the service pack.why?

I can't say without the details. PackageKit has a mailing list for
discussions and bugzilla for reporting issues.

Hi Luggies,

I  bought a new 4 port KVM Switch (ATEN). I am using Fedora 11 as my 
Primary OS. When I connected the KVM Switch with my Viewsonic (VA192w) 
Monitor the Max Resolution of my system is not setting (say 1440x900). 
It is by default set to 640x240 something like that. I tried to manually 
reconfigure the xorg.conf. But, I never succeed. Then google and Xorg 
Logs helps me a lot. From the Logs I found out the EDID which is 
responsible for sending Monitor Details to Video Driver is not passed 
and so the X Server is can't able to configure the resolution. This 
happens only when I introduce the KVM switch. The logs shows like this:

/*< (WW) NVIDIA(GPU-0): Unable to read EDID for display device CRT-0
191,192c190,191
< (--) NVIDIA(0):     CRT-0                                            
                                                    (Logs after

                                                                (Logs

 > (II) NVIDIA(0): Setting mode "1440x900_75"*/

I even tried other option in xorg.conf  such as "options noDcc", 
"customEDID" but nothing works.

Xorg.conf:

Section "Screen"
     Identifier     "Default Screen"
     Device         "Videocard0"
     Monitor        "Monitor0"
     Option         "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "True"
     SubSection     "Display"
         Virtual     1440 900
         Modes      "nvidia-auto-select"
     Option "CustomEDID" "DFP-0:/home/linux/edid.bin"

NOTE: I installed nvidia driver from kmod-nvidia.

Suggestions welcomed! :-)
Thanks,
Rex

Subject: [Ilugc] Calling Python and C from one another
Message-ID: <7938ae610908301902j5a4e744ey55a9d15bab2a5e0e@mail.gmail.com>

I am going to talk about calling Python functions from C and vice versa.

I am not really great at this thing as I just learnt it.

And I learnt it because I had to learn for my work.

There seem to be two ways to marry Python with C. One is called
extending Python and
another is called embedding Python. Embedding seems to be the tougher thing
with extending being a subset of embedding Python.

Anyway this is only a primer. Nothing more.

There are also other advanced mechanisms using SWIG in which you can
marry several
scripting languages with C.

Python + C is very interesting and really easy.

First copy paste this file.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<StartCopy<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

#include <Python.h>

/*
 * Function to be called from Python
 */
static PyObject* py_myFunction(PyObject* self, PyObject* args)
{
        char *s = "Hello from C!";
        return Py_BuildValue("s", s);
}

/*
 * Another function to be called from Python
 */
static PyObject* py_myOtherFunction(PyObject* self, PyObject* args)
{
        double x, y;
        PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "dd", &x, &y);
        return Py_BuildValue("d", x*y);
}

/*
 * Bind Python function names to our C functions
 */
static PyMethodDef myModule_methods[] = {
        {"myFunction", py_myFunction, METH_VARARGS},
        {"myOtherFunction", py_myOtherFunction, METH_VARARGS},
        {NULL, NULL}
};

/*
 * Python calls this to let us initialize our module
 */
void initpyfoo()
{
        (void) Py_InitModule("pyfoo", myModule_methods);
}

<<<<<<<<<<<<<EndCopy<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Name it as pyfoo.c .

This is important. You cannot have arbitrary names. If you give some
other name then you
also need initba() (if you name your file ba.c) instead of initpyfoo()
as above inside the file.

Anyway now compile it using this command  on linux.

$ gcc -shared -I/usr/include/python2.5 -lpython2.5 -opyfoo.so pyfoo.c

It should go through. If not please find out why it doesn't work.

Then create a python file called whatever(this name doesn't matter).

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

from pyfoo import *

print "Result from myFunction():", myFunction()
print "Result from myOtherFunction():", myOtherFunction(4.0, 5.0)

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Now call it i.py and then

$ python i.py

will print this.

Result from myFunction(): Hello from C!
Result from myOtherFunction(): 20.0


So what did we do?

We just called C functions from inside python!

And the two most important Python methods are

PyArg_ParseTuple() which converts Python objects into C datatypes.

And

Py_BuildValue() which converts the C datatypes into Python objects.

This allows us to manipulate C variables and Python objects with
either C or Python.

And remember to define the functions as static and every function
invariably returns
PyObject *  .

Please try it.

Thanks.

Have a nice day.

Message-ID: <dee9e8140908301903m79201d44he5a89baa41000d8f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
 I conducted one day Free software workshop on 29th August, at  KLN madurai
for the pre-final year CSE and IT students (50+). The session started with
an introduction to Free software and philosophy.Then i  explained various
GNU/Linux commands and applications. Mailing list etiquettes were taught
using shakthi's presentation (Thanks shakthi) . Introduced IRC and students
were taught about getting help from various support channels.

In afternoon session, it was all about Nmap , Ncat and Ettercap (FOSS
Network Security tools) , students were taught about  security risks of
transmitting  plain text passwords on the wire, ARP cache poisoning and DNS
spoofing were demonstrated and explained  using ettercap.
Fedora 11 was installed in 30+ Lab machines for hands on. The response from
the students was excellent. Hospitality was good.

Fedora 11 DVDs were distributed to all the participants.

I thank HOD of CSE department,KLN and Final year student Dhivakaran for
organizing this event successfully.

Just to add, There are also Cython and Pyrex projects for writing C
extensions (or Extending python) in python. They allow you to write C
extensions in a python-like syntax.

I hope not. The problem with all biometric mechanisms such as finger
prints, iris prints etc is that it gives an illusion of security but the
truth is that these systems are quite easily compromised.

A group of german hackers published the fingerprints of the German Home
Secretary and also published tips on how to make a copy of the fingerprint
for use on fingerprint readers.
http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/105728

It is trivially easy to obtain the iris print or a finger print of most
people. If I can get someone to look closely at something within a
showcase and if I hide a high precision camera within the case, then I can
get the person's iris print. Similarly, finger prints can be easily lifted
from cups, phones etc.

If your entire ID mechanism relies on this compromised biometric code,
then the person will have to be locked out of the system - because the
person cannot change their finger / iris print once they become public
knowledge.

So most biometric systems utilize not just the finger print but also an
additional keyboard entry system for entering a numeric code. But even
this can be easily determined by photographing the person while making the
entry.

Facial recognition is yet another area where there are lots of problems.
The systems are pretty easy to fool or there will be a lot of false
negatives which makes the usage of these systems quite cumbersome.

Thanks,
PK

Bruce Schneier once said something like:

 You can change your password but you cannot change your fingerprint.
 Think about it. Then think about it once more!

It it slowly becoming commonplace to use multiple independent sources
of authentication on computers just as we are supposed to in "real
life". The independence of the sources is important of course. So it
seems likely that authentication should be based on something which
you have _and_ something which you know.

Kapil.

Just to add : Python _plus_ C or Python _plus_  C++ is a deadly combo. In
one of my previous organizations we achieved amazing results doing this.
We get the speed of C and also faster dev times of Python. [Note that we are
talking about 'speed' here.]

If Python _plus_ C++ is desired, then Boost libraries work well.

Hi !

I see this in HCL site. Is this the one ?

http://www.hclstore.in/hcl_mileap_ml03

    * Intel Celeron M Processor @ 900 MHz,
    * Ubuntu Linux
    * Intel 915GMS Chipset,
    * 512MB DDR2 Ram
    * 30 GB Hard Disc Drive
    * 7" (17.7 cm) Wide (800x480) LCD
    * 2 In-built Speakers
    * Ports: RJ-45, 2-in-1 Card Reader, 2X USB Port,DC-IN, Headphone,
Mic-in             Built-in Mic
    * WiFi B/G
    * 6 Cell with 4 Hrs Idle Condition, 1.44 Kg
    * 1.44 Kg


Looks like price has gone down ?  (Price: Rs.11990)
But screen size is only 7"    and 800x 400 res which may be little
annoying. For this price it look like a deal.

Cheers

Most of the biometric images are taken at 50 micrometer resolution or less.
It is very difficult for two people have similar biometric characteristics
at this minute scale.
any biometric for that matter,  iris, finger prints

That being the case, it is only how fast we are able to process the image
and find a match against a large
database, say covering the entire population of world, with around 6 billion
records.

Application specific asic chips are available to do this.
Purpose built systems with a large no of this ICs working in tandem can find
a match against such large database in seconds.
Further , the records are also indexed with the basic biometric
characteristics  ( like right loop , left loop, tented arch etc in case for
finger prints)

this link has some info on the current state of the science:

Today's fingerprint readers have something called LFD. ( Live finger
Detection)
It measures the temperature of the object first and accepts the image only
if it
is within 97 +/- 7 degree F. ( body temperature)

Hi,

I have two systems, 1 server and the other client.
The server has 2 interfaces, 1 in 172 network and the other in 192 network.
In the client I have configured the server as the default gateway. There is
only one interface on the client configured wiht 172 network.

Now, whether or not I set the net.ipv4.ip_forward to "1", I am able to ping
the 192 interface from the client on 172 network. *Is this expected
behavior?* There are no iptables or anything of that sort configured.

These have already been busted. They use a thin film (with the finger

Almost any netbook that is available in Chennai today:
 1. can run with Ubuntu Netbook Remix
 2. has Windows pre-installed

The counter-examples to (1) are the older Celeron-based models
that should be avoided since these are battery hogs and are slower
to boot than the Atom powered ones.

If you find one that is a counter-example to (2) then I guess
everyone on the list would like to hear about it!

People keep saying that the Arm-based netbooks will be released "any
time now" but I have yet to see one in the market or available in
India online.

Kapil.

The date of the entry is the problem.

  "This entry was posted on Wednesday, June 4th, 2008 at 7:12 am and is
   filed under Laptop."

This is the netbook A150 that I have and bought in November 2008.

In early January Acer announced that they were dropping the price by
Rs. 3000/-. Shortly after that the new model D250 was introduced and
the old one went "out of stock"; the new model comes with Windows
pre-installed.

ip_forward set to 1 only means the packets can be forwarded across
interfaces. In this case, the host is responding and that has been
reached via the 172 interface. If ip_forward is 0, you cannot ping
systems in the 192 network other than the host having the two cards.

That is exactly what is happening. ip_forward is set to 0. The server has 2
interfaces 172 and 192. Another system is connected to 172 and has the first
system set as the gateway. when I ping the 192 interface from the client
system, I am getting a ping response.

I have made dozens of spoofs of my own finger including thin films and
tested it.
They passed through some sensors without good LFD but with good LFD they all
fail.

Yes. It should work. This is what I meant by " If ip_forward is 0, you
cannot ping
>> systems in the 192 network other than the host having the two cards."

A ----------------------------------    B   ------------------- C
172.x.y.z            172.x.y.1    192.a.b.1      192.a.b.c

I'm assuming this is what you've and ip_forward is 0 on B. You are
pinging 192.a.b.1 from A. It should work as the host B responds to the
ping and not the interface. Always the case... In common parlance, we
use the term ping the interface. In reality it is ping the host thro'
the interface.

If ip_forward is 0, A cannot ping C.

Checking against a database without any indexing would be absurd considering
the number of misses the system would encounter. As you have penned that
indexing of fingerprints has been done, how efficient is the search? Can you
describe the best case, worst case and average case?

I will clear the confusion with the net.ipv4.ip_forward sysctl setting.

Routers alone do IP forwarding.

You need not run a routing daemon for that. You can have a simple
static route table and forward packets between two networks. And send
the remaining packets to the default router.

Routing is very different from forwarding.

Routing involves running a heavy duty daemon like BGP or OSPF.

And it involves discovering routes on the Internet and keeping it
upto date. Routing algorithms and protocols are very complex.

A router is defined as a node with at least 2 interfaces. Otherwise
running these daemons make no sense. Obviously routers forward
packets between different networks of course.

Whereas forwarding is different.

You can setup many networks at a home or office LAN and forward
packets based on static routes and simple route lookups.

Now to answer your question after all this digression, you don't need
this sysctl for forwarding/routing for ping to work.

You are barking up the wrong tree.

Normally it is very rare that you set this sysctl. You do it if you are a
 firewall or a proxy or if you are running squid.

I just am not able to understand what you are wanting to do by this
