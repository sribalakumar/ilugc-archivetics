Tool of the day: Apache Cassandra

 Apache Cassandra is an open source distributed database management
system. It is an Apache Software Foundation top-level project designed
to handle very large amounts of data spread out across many commodity
servers.
 Cassandra is a highly scalable, eventually consistent, distributed,
structured
key-value store. Cassandra brings together the distributed systems
technologies
from Dynamo and the data model from Google's BigTable. Like Dynamo,
Cassandra is eventually consistent. Like BigTable, Cassandra provides a
ColumnFamily-based data model richer than typical key/value systems.

features:

   - Decentralized
   - Supports replication and multi data center replication
   - Scalability
   - Fault-tolerant
   - Tunable consistency
   - MapReduce support
   - Query language

That is one of the first things I look for in a language:

$ cat cmdline
#!/usr/local/bin/lua

sf=string.format
for k,v in ipairs(arg) do
        print(sf("k=>%s<, v=>%s<", k, v))
end

This uses the string library's format() function and prints the arg table.

ipairs() is a lua function that shows the table's index and value.

Works well.

Try it with :

$ lua cmdline how are you today?

 OpenVPN is a full-featured SSL VPN solution which can accomodate
a wide range of configurations, including remote access, site-to-site
VPNs, WiFi security, and enterprise-scale remote access solutions
with load balancing, failover, and fine-grained access-controls

 OpenVPN implements OSI layer 2 or 3 secure network extension
using the industry standard SSL/TLS protocol, supports flexible client
authentication methods based on certificates, smart cards, and/or 2-factor
authentication, and allows user or group-specific access control policies
using firewall rules applied to the VPN virtual interface.

 OpenVPN is not a web application proxy and doesn't operate
through a web browser.

Here, we got NS, A and SOA but there is no MX record. MX record will
make your server send/receive mail from/to other servers. Thats what
Arun also said in his previous post.

   Go to "/etc/hosts" file and add your FQDN
An FQDN must include a hostname part, as well as a domain name part.

Ex.
your-server-ip   host.abc.com
your-server-ip   host.def.com
your-server-ip   host.ghi.com


can you try now?...

Subject: [Ilugc] simple file I/O in lua
Message-ID: <CALDskywnGv0+7w26f4k-+G581bVp8HD1_cbAqFXz4S6sgrxhVA@mail.gmail.com>

$ cat fileio.lua
while 1 do
        local s=io.read()
        if s == nil then break end
        print(s)
end

You can run like this:

$ lua fileio.lua  </etc/passwd

I will explain.

The outer loop is a simple while(1) loop which we have seen in C.

The local keyword is just an access specifier. You can omit it.

Lua is a scripting language, so you don't have to declare variables
and you don't
 have to use the same type also.

s=io.read() reads the STDIN into the s buffer. You can manipulate the data in s
using the string library or the other facilities.

The if s== nil line is used to look for end of file(EOF) marker.

The print(s) line prints the lines with newline marker.

The io.write(s) which I used did not print newlines.

$ lua fileio.lua </etc/passwd > /tmp/pass

$ sha1 /etc/passwd /tmp/pass

Do you see?

Salient advantages:
a) Can use key based logins to secure site-site VPNs.
b) Works on UDP and is completely NAT friendly for negotiated port
applications. No ALGs needed.
c) Works well for both Road Warrior and Site-Site VPNs.
d) Well supported on various OSes.

Way better than IPSec for ease of installation, support/maintenance
and supporting variety of client OSes.

I agree. But IPsec has its place.

Long ago a Chennai based company in the usual arrogance I see
 very often in India without any technical knowledge was telling
 me that without certificates and VPN you cannot do remote support.

And he did not even invite me inside to discuss an OEM deal.

Even for a product negotiation of the tune of 20k we talk inside right?

This is a company in West Mambalam.

And the other Indian attitude he showed was that he was not interested
  in dealing with players like me with an international face.

People in India refuse to give credit to other fellow Indians who are
globally competitive; in other words refusal to accept his defeat in
front of someone superior.

Anyway the point was that technically he was wrong on two accounts:

1) A certificate is not needed for VPN unless you use OpenVPN
2) He could have solved his problem using ssh port forwarding

I could have given him a much more scalable and stable solution using
 IPsec.

But as I often see in India, people refuse to acknowledge the
greatness of somebody else.

Even in ILUGC In my tenure since 2006 August I am yet to find someone
who did not call my projects "a mere effort".

I thought I had found someone who was humble but I was sadly mistaken.

I still have hope.

Without humility nothing great can be achieved.

Basic thumb rule.

       I don't understand that statement. Why is a project not an
"effort" and why do you think calling it an "effort" is derogatory ?
This is just my opinion -  but every project is an effort towards some
goal. Thanks

Arrogance is everywhere, nationality does not matter :-). People find
their own reasons to be arrogant. Some are arrogant because of their
own ignorance (and their stubborn will to remain so), and some are 
arrogant to avoid being over-ridden by an ignorant.

What is so "Indian attitude" about it ? You can find folks with such an
attitude everywhere (ethnicity/nationality does not matter here). Haven't
you witnessed such irrational attitude in big 
"name-your-not-so-favourite-brand" companies that are not Indian BTW ?

You fail to see the other-side of the coin my friend. It is people in 
India who strive, struggle and fulfill their dream goals while fighting 
against all odds that include intense competition, corruption, 
oppression and subversion by their own fellow peers. I might signal too
patriotic here (which I am proud of being) while also being critical
about the environment we are surrounded in. But it is this very "People
in India" who believe in the "never give up" attitude of living.

In general, people in India have way too many problems and challenges 
staring at them in their path to success that they have no time to worry 
about who is superior and who is being defeated - these are normally the
traits of a few ignorant, selfish and deviant little-minded folks to whom 
nationality does not matter. They can be found anywhere on earth and 
cannot be grossly generalized as "People in India".

There is no point trying to persuade the ignorant in acknowledging his
mistakes and accept your solution. It is better to save your energy for
your own good and move on :-)

Your work (especially your contributions to the OpenBSD LiveUSB) and 
your products are sincerely not "a mere effort" - they are indeed a 
proof that "People in India" can accomplish great feat while being 
surrounded by intense criticism. Your articles published on 
Linux Journal and AP Lawrence have a professional touch with 
technical excellence - I personally recommend many of your articles 
to my students. 

It is just that some of the best accomplishments take more to gain
popularity and mass acclaim. It took nearly 20 years for C programming 
language to become so popular enough to replace Pascal in main-stream 
computing. It took close to 20 years for Linux to become the most widely
used OS especially in pervasive computing environments (in the guise of 
Android, Ubuntu, SmartTV, etc). It also took nearly 20 years for 
A R Rahman to win an oscar award :-)

IPSec was one of the earliest and by legacy has its place. It is
pretty cumbersome to configure. IPSec is largely driven by equipment
vendors. In a box that we (CPE and ISP edge/periphery box) built in my
past life, we had only IPSec - conformity to be able to interop with
other boxes. The biggest issue was being able to run multi port
applications on a NAT. NAT Traversal (something that we did implement)
was another convoluted protocol spec. Largely, because it was bolt on
to a non-NAT friendly protocol. We did not have OpenVPN on the box
though it was possible.:( Customer demand was close to zero and thus
engineering effort to integrate it was not justifiable.

IPSec works well for site to site VPNs largely within the same
organisation where it provide a simple pipe and no NAT is needed. It
is a nightmare to configure IPSec Road Warrior especially on Windows
which ran the CISCO client.

I found OpenVPN and SSH based VPNs to be far easier to implement for
the same use. In the same place where we developed the box, we used
OpenVPN for our internal use for RW and site to site.

1. Edge magic: thumb gestures from all four edges of the screen enable
users to find content and switch between apps faster than other phones.

2. Deep content immersion?controls appear only when the user wants them.

3. A beautiful global search for apps, content, and products.

4. Voice and text commands in any application for faster access to rich
capabilities.

5. Both native and Web or HTML5 apps.

One advantage for Web apps in Ubuntu OS over that in other mobile platforms
is that they can talk to the OS, and do nice things like using the system
notification. This makes web apps more native. This was actually released
in Ubuntu 12.10 itself.

Your top domain still does not show any MX record.

Prima facie, from your input, it appears that

mail.zhivu.com  is sub domain whose MX is mx01.zhivu.com.

You need to fix the MX for zhivu.com.

Tool of the Day: Jmeter

   The Apache JMeter desktop application is an open source software,
its a Java application designed to load test functional behavior and
measure performance. It was originally designed for testing Web
Applications but has since expanded to other test functions.

  Apache JMeter may be used to test performance both on static and
dynamic resources (files, Servlets, Perl scripts, Java Objects, Data Bases
and Queries, FTP Servers and more). It can be used to simulate a heavy
load on a server, network or object to test its strength or to analyze
overall
performance under different load types. You can use it to make a graphical
analysis of performance or to test your server/script/object behavior under
heavy concurrent load.

 features:

? Can load and performance test many different server types:
  Web - HTTP, HTTPS
  SOAP
  Database via JDBC
  LDAP
  JMS
  Mail - SMTP(S), POP3(S) and IMAP(S)
  Native commands or shell scripts
? Complete portability and 100% Java purity .
? Full multithreading framework allows concurrent sampling by many threads
and simultaneous
  sampling of different functions by separate thread groups.
? Careful GUI design allows faster operation and more precise timings.
? Caching and offline analysis/replaying of test results.
? Highly Extensible:
? Pluggable Samplers allow unlimited testing capabilities.
? Several load statistics may be choosen with pluggable timers .
? Data analysis and visualization plugins allow great extensibility as well
as personalization.
? Functions can be used to provide dynamic input to a test or provide data
manipulation.
? Scriptable Samplers (BeanShell is fully supported; and there is a sampler
which supports BSF-
  compatible languages)

The error message is pretty clear. You have to add route correctly.

Check the ifconfig and route options in openvpn man page

Subject: [Ilugc] more lua
Message-ID: <CALDskyzrv7nYz1dq1vwjZahtmbHmo5s6bL5wC1=WmsrYRzNwRw@mail.gmail.com>

$ cat sqr.lua

-- This is a single line comment
--[[
    This is a block comment
    that can span any
    number of lines
]]--
print("Script for computing square roots")
for i=2,200,3 do
    print ("Number is ", i)
    print(math.sqrt(i))
end


This is a simple for() loop in lua.

And you can see how easily we can do math and looping in lua.

The syntax of for() loop is,

for var=start,end,step do
   (body)
done

So we can write,

for var=2,20 do
     print(var)
end

in which case the step is 1.

You can also write

for b=20,1,-1 do
      print(b)
end

and so on

Print by default prints a newline.

If you do not want it I guess you need io.write().

A good option would be Qt as it works on a lot of platforms -
including a few mobile ones as well.

Tool of the Day: Apache HBase

 Apache HBase is the Hadoop database, a distributed, scalable,
big data store. HBase is an open source, non-relational, distributed
database modeled after Google'sBigTable and is written in Java. It
is developed as part of Apache Software Foundation'sApache Hadoop
project and runs on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed Filesystem),
providing BigTable-like capabilities for Hadoop.

features:

   - Linear and modular scalability.
   - Strictly consistent reads and writes.
   - Automatic and configurable sharding of tables
   - Automatic failover support between RegionServers.
   - Convenient base classes for backing Hadoop MapReduce jobs with Apache
   HBase tables.
   - Easy to use Java API for client access.
   - Block cache and Bloom Filters for real-time queries.
   - Query predicate push down via server side Filters
   - Thrift gateway and a REST-ful Web service that supports XML, Protobuf,
   and binary data encoding options
   - Extensible jruby-based (JIRB) shell
   - Support for exporting metrics via the Hadoop metrics subsystem to
   files or Ganglia; or via JMX

I was searching for a GUI Toolkit / API for Python for developing a
kiosk application with multi-touch input.

After going through Kivy documentation, it looks, kivy developers have
done most things for multi-touch input which impressed me a lot.

Thanks for the info.

I want sponsors:

I want somebody to arrange me a venue. I want some volunteers for logistics.

However the main thing I want is audience. ;)

I have some ideas already. The key thing to make it a success is to
get good interest
 by attracting a sizeable crowd.

Anyway right now I lack the experience to do this thing predictably.

With some details left to chance I am planning to hold a day's class
on lua programming.

Interested volunteers can DM me at twitter @girish1729.

Date, venue and other details will be confirmed later. Of course the
talk will be somewhere in Chennai.

My idea about the timeline for the talk is around March or April 2013.

Subject: [Ilugc] lua tables: initial cut intro
Message-ID: <CALDskyxyJcH4SfETeen7ti1RXmFRZbrCjLkh50k+NnvdU4vbTg@mail.gmail.com>

If you understand lua tables then you know lua.

So obviously we are not there yet.

Just like perl implements modules, packages and namespaces using the
OO and reference concept,
lua does everything using tables or dictionaries or hashes or
associative arrays.

All are same.

A table is a name value pair. Not just in lua but in everything.

We have lookup tables even in hardware.

In programming a hash table is very popular. One key and one value.
The value can be a reference to
 an aggregate data structure like arrays or even other tables.

If you have been with me so far(I covered a lot of ground in this
intro) then good.

Otherwise don't worry. You can learn as you go along.

Let us look at a simple lua table.

Just type lua like python. Both have interactive shells.

$ lua
Lua 5.1.5  Copyright (C) 1994-2012 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
> tablex={2,3,4,5,100}
> table.foreach(tablex,print)
1       2
2       3
3       4
4       5
5       100
> tabhash={name="Girish", job="Software engineer", hobby="LUG"}
> table.foreach(tabhash,print)
hobby   LUG
name    Girish
job     Software engineer
>

You see the idea?

You can type this code also.

$ cat learntable
#!/usr/local/bin/lua

t={2,3, 5, name="LUG", age=10}

for k,v in pairs(t) do
        print(k,v)
end


We have learnt a few iterator constructs in lua for printing all the
elements in a table.

It is a composite data type like all scripting languages.

A table can contain anything. It does not care about data type.

Thanks to Madan who responded with his kindness.

The hall capacity is less than 20.

So in case more people turn up we have trouble.

If you don't express objection or come up with a better idea by way of some
 other sponsor/volunteer I will proceed with this location.

I will confirm the date later. I am yet to learn lua properly. :)

                Also, you would need SNI support. If you are talking
about apache, the recent versions work ok. Also, the browsers need to
support SNI. Thanks

Tool of the Day - Spacewalk

 Spacewalk is open source systems management software
developed by Red Hat. It is the upstream version of the RHN
Satellite Server Spacewalk includes the web interface and
back-end, as well as RHN Proxy Server and associated
client software of Satellite and makes them available to users
and developers under FOSS license. The relationship between
Spacewalk and Satellite is analogous to the relationship between
Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Whereas Satellite manages
only RHEL and Solaris systems, Spacewalk manages Fedora,
CentOS, SUSE and Debian systems

capabilities:

   - Inventory systems (hardware and software information)
   - Install and update software on our systems
   - Collect and distribute our custom software packages into manageable
   groups
   - Provision (kickstart) our systems
   - Manage and deploy configuration files to our systems
   - Monitor our systems
   - Provision virtual guests
   - Start/stop/configure virtual guests

Dear ilugc mailing list users,

The ilugc mailing list was down for about the last 48 hours but is now 
back up. The problem was caused by overly aggressive spam filtering rules 
which resulted in all incoming postings being classified as spam and hence 
getting discarded. Spam filtering rules have been suitably softened and 
the list is back in action. Thanks to Bharathi Subramanian (bharathi.s at 
gmail) and Shrinivasan T (tshrinivasan at gmail) who reported the issue 
and helped me solve it.

Hi,

A major security vulnerability found in RoR has forced a government
website to close down. The vulnerability exists in ALL versions of RoR
unless you upgraded in the last two days.

Some Links:

As I was telling Karthick during my session, you can never assume that
your code is secure just because you are using some framework. You
should always do your home work, and whatever measures that the
framework takes, can be broken by a very very stupid programmer :D

Hi everyone,


I am following the gadgets from CES 2013 on various websites, to see what
has been done innovative and new with technologies and especially I am
following gadgets powered by Linux, Out of which Ubuntu Phone OS, Firefox
OS are highlights.

But I never thought this would be made out of Linux. Yes, am surprised to
know about a Rifle powered by Linux !

Ars Technica - covers it from CES 13, where a Austin based start-up has
come with this product.

If you feel interested to know about the product, take a look at this link

$ cat wc
#!/usr/local/bin/lua
local BUFSIZE = 2^13     -- 8K
    local f = io.input(arg[1])   -- open input file
    local cc, lc, wc = 0, 0, 0   -- char, line, and word counts
    while true do
      local lines, rest = f:read(BUFSIZE, "*line")
      if not lines then break end
      if rest then lines = lines .. rest .. '\n' end
      cc = cc + string.len(lines)
      -- count words in the chunk
      local _,t = string.gsub(lines, "%S+", "")
      wc = wc + t
      -- count newlines in the chunk
      _,t = string.gsub(lines, "\n", "\n")
      lc = lc + t
    end
    print(lc, wc, cc)

This works well. You can test it.

I will herewith explain the lines for you to get a better idea.

This example I lifted from the standard lua manual.

Let us look at first 6 lines:

local BUFSIZE = 2^13     -- 8K
    local f = io.input(arg[1])   -- open input file
    local cc, lc, wc = 0, 0, 0   -- char, line, and word counts
    while true do
      local lines, rest = f:read(BUFSIZE, "*line")
      if not lines then break end

First line stores the buffer size in the variable BUFSIZE.

In lua print(x) is same as =x. So let us check.

> =2^13
8192
>

So it is same as
local BUFSIZE = 8192

which we usually do using C as

#define BUFSIZE 8192 and we use
char buf[BUFSIZE];

"local" is an access specifier. We can omit it.

   local f = io.input(arg[1])   -- open input file

This line opens the file given in standard input(argv[1]) as the comment says.

    local cc, lc, wc = 0, 0, 0   -- char, line, and word counts
This line initializes the 3 areas of interest for us, char counts,
word counts and line counts.

Unlike C lua can assign multiple variables in the same line.

Next 3 lines,

while true do
      local lines, rest = f:read(BUFSIZE, "*line")
      if not lines then break end

start the while loop(infinite loop with a break condition within) and
   the other lines read the input file line by line storing the lines in
 the variable lines and the if condition is the termination condition
 for the while loop which is infinite.

We are done with first 6 lines.

Let us look at the rest of the code:

 if rest then lines = lines .. rest .. '\n' end
      cc = cc + string.len(lines)
      -- count words in the chunk
      local _,t = string.gsub(lines, "%S+", "")
      wc = wc + t
      -- count newlines in the chunk
      _,t = string.gsub(lines, "\n", "\n")
      lc = lc + t
    end
    print(lc, wc, cc)

The first line uses the lua concatenation operator ".." to concatenate
the lines with
 the "rest" variable which we used above. I really don't understand this line.

Let us look at the next line. I know this much that it is an if
condition in one line.

    cc = cc + string.len(lines)
      -- count words in the chunk

These two lines increment the character count. As string.len(foo)
returns the characters in foo string.

Since we initializes cc(character count to zero), this line gets us
the total char count in input file.

 local _,t = string.gsub(lines, "%S+", "")
      wc = wc + t

These two lines count the words by splitting the line into words using
the string library we saw two days ago.

-- count newlines in the chunk
      _,t = string.gsub(lines, "\n", "\n")
      lc = lc + t

This chunk counts the newlines by using the same gsub() method. Since
lines variable contains the whole
file, this will give us the total line count in lc.

end
    print(lc, wc, cc)

The end is for the while() infinite loop and print() prints our computed values.

I will settle for the little space I mailed earlier for the lua class.

However I need to study and prepare before we hold our training.

I will confirm the date before end of this month by when I will be ready.

We know one table function.

table.function(<table>, <function>)

for example,

t={1,2,3,4, "Girish"}

table.foreach(t,print)

will do our Gangnam style printing.

So foreach() is a method in the table module for iterating thro' all
its members.

Similarly the string object has many methods which we will presently see.

The list is this:

string.byte
string.char
string.dump
string.find
string.format
string.gmatch
string.gsub
string.len
string.lower
string.match
string.rep
string.reverse
string.sub
string.upper

I will show some samples:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thanks for the heads up.

I did cursorily look at the referred links and did not come across any
mention about the flaw being attributed to "stupid programming"

If a bug is a way to judge our programming abilities, then all of us
are "very very stupid programmers"

Do you know how to do Gangnam dance in lua?

You don't?

Good. Then learn. I also dunno.

Here are some simple table looping samples.

First cross your arms and play some loud music.

Then,

type this in.

$ cat tex
#!/usr/local/bin/lua

local mytable = {"one", "two", "three"}
mytable[4] = "four"
mytable[6] = "seven"  -- Note the hole in indexing
mytable["name"] = "Foo" -- Notice the string index
mytable[1.5] = "one-point-five" -- note the float

print("This prints only sequential indices")
for k,v in ipairs(mytable) do
        print(string.format("k=%s, v=%s", tostring(k), tostring(v)))
end


print("This prints all indices")
for k,v in pairs(mytable) do
        print(string.format("k=%s, v=%s", tostring(k), tostring(v)))
end
print("One more Gangnam style")
for k,v in pairs(mytable) do print(k,v) end

Here is the explanation. Before that the output,
$ ./tex
This prints only sequential indices
k=1, v=one
k=2, v=two
k=3, v=three
k=4, v=four
This prints all indices
k=1, v=one
k=2, v=two
k=3, v=three
k=4, v=four
k=6, v=seven

3       three
4       four
6       seven

1.5     one-point-five

Okay the explanation is rather simple.

We use lua tables as explained before.

And we use string function format() which we obtain from the string
object/table.

So, we can use string.format("how are you") to print.

Then we use the pairs() and ipairs() lua keywords which are used for
table iteration.

pairs() prints all as we see. ipairs() prints only sequential indices when we
 use table as an array.

And I added the Gangnam style without using string.format()

We will do file I/O seriously tomorrow.

Thanks to Madan who responded with his kindness.

The hall capacity is less than 20.

So in case more people turn up we have trouble.

If you don't express objection or come up with a better idea by way of some
 other sponsor/volunteer I will proceed with this location.

I will confirm the date later. I am yet to learn lua properly. :)

Message-ID: <CALDskyxu6aPCEn_T2g0ZYejtpFX7P4WBi4wWY4LDciQYc589vg@mail.gmail.com>

and so far I have been able to keep up that effort.

I know now what to cover in lua and what is remaining.

Until I am mentally prepared there is no use use worrying about logistics.

Since I have a very large experience taking trainings for LUG in
particular and several corporates
 I know how to deliver an effective training and what it takes.

But the audience should not be a failure. That is why I am holding it
free of cost again after trying a
 paid training once.

Let us see how it goes.

My guess is that for me to become comfortable in lua I will take
another 20 to 40 days.

Then I will revisit this topic of logistics. In case anybody else is
willing to donate their training
 facility to us it will be good.

It is best we avoid academic institutions and find training company sponsors.

Use html5 or Google charts.

Don't do it on server side. 3d pie charts are easy too.

+1. Server side is a no-no for such usage. Stream the data to the
frontend and use js libraries like d3 to render visualization.

IMHO, Google charts is not open enough.

Though not open, Google charts API is free to use.
It is really easy to build the URL with their wizard. Use PHP to replace
content in the URL string (all graph data is transmitted through the URL
itself) to get the graphs made.

One caveat though. I had developed a PHP app for a large corporate in which
reports were generated through the Google charts API. After using it for 2
years, their IT department suddenly realized that `their` data was being
sent to a 3rd party server and pulled the plug.

Exactly - I have the same feeling too - that the data goes to the
google servers. But technically, only the js scripts should be
downloaded from the server to the client, isnt it?

Context: during my session on security, some one told me that since RoR
takes care of security, they care the least about it and code at will. My
point is you will make a mistake if you really don't worry about security.

One of the reasons why I end up always 'inventing' my own framework
based on the job at hand - I do feel stupid doing this sometimes, but
have never been hit by a widespread exploit, exactly because of the
same reason.

Subject: [Ilugc] today's lua class - closures and anonymous functions
Message-ID: <CALDskyzYXGJrax7SrUmmP51BfhM=pYMd7HZU7rrkjF9mUJBL1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Closures and anonymous functions are new concepts as they require
specific knowledge of functional programming or
 you need to be a javascript hacker.

I have coded several lines of javascript but I don't have a proper
knowledge of closures.

Let us look at lua and how closures are implemented in lua.

Some intro to this concept.

Only certain programming languages allow anonymous functions. These
are basically functions without a name.

You can return a new function from within a function. This is an
anonymous function. And using this you can implement
 closures and better callback mechanisms.

How this works is somewhat hard to understand. So let us be happy with
an example. We will look at its use and application later.

Let us look at this:

$ cat closure.lua

function counter()
    local i=0
    return function() i=i+1 ; return i; end
end

c=counter()


print(c())
print(c())
print(c())


Here what is happening is that the function c() is assigned to the
function counter().

This shows that in lua functions are also like ordinary variables,
they are first class variables.

And by calling c() you get a different result each time since the
"local i=0" varible is stored differently in
 each invocation. It gets incremented.

Now if you do this,

d = counter()

print(d())

you will see it starts from 1, since the new closure is initialized differently.

If this is confusing don't worry.

It is.

Dear Girish ,

Though what you have been doing is great but for a special focus on
Lua please create a SIG - Special Interest Group or a Lua users group
and move the discussions of Lua over there .
People like me ( definitely not generalising) have subscribed to a LUG
to hear all kinds of stuff right from lua,python to kde,gnome to
ubuntu,gentoo but more or less traffic has been diverse and it fits
all .

In your case on a less traffic day all I see is Lua and girish  in
ILUGC and yes I dont want to create a filter for you or lua because I
might miss out a interesting thing from either you or lua . So all I
say is lua specific discussions are better off as a SIG while
important lua announcements or even an occasional lua query would be
nice to see here .

Move to something other than LUG?

But I have a reputation here and a culture and so on. I could post on
both. Moving does not make sense IMHO.

I need to think of it.

In general I have shown indifference to suggestions in LUG from various
people.

It is not due to anything else but my busy life and complex day to
day firefights.

In this case let me see what best I can do.

In general I have not got much support by way of sharing my load from
LUG members.

That would make my long term plans more fruitful.

Dear Knights;

  Here goes a small para on Linux;
  (a) Linux is an 'Operating System' (OS) that is non-propreitary and falls under the Open Source
  category(OSS). The source code is available for development and modification. This has spawned a
  variety of versions tailormade for various critera. Some of the more known flavours are Red Hat
  Linux, Debian, Suse, Mandrake, Mint, Ubuntu etc.
  (b) Linux is economical in the use of processor time and computing resources. It is flexible and
  can be scaled to large, small and embedded applications. The availability of the source code has
  facilitated this. Thus it has found application in servers, embedded appliances and devices with
  specialised and limited application. The low cost and flexibility has made it an ideal choice for
  low cost, mass produced, quality computing devices and older systems.
  (c) It was originally conceptualised by Mr Linus Travos and led to the development of many
  commercial and specialised software products. The variety of flavours and distributions have large
  user groups who offer support and advice. The repository of software and aplications are stored on
  servers and is available freely for download and use.

Corrections: Linux is a kernel. GNU is the operating system. GNU/Linux is an operating system. 

It falls under the Free software category, additionally it is also Open Source. 




This has spawned a variety of versions 




Corrections : Distributions is a better word to use than Versions.

Corrections: Written, and continues to be maintained, instead of just conceptualised.

Fellow Knight,

Overall, great effort - like they say simplification is more complex
than we think.

I think you should simplify it a little more - have highlighted areas
where I think will not be understood. HTH

stored where? on all linux servers? This might need some correction to
be technically correct.

Class VIII?

When I was in 12 th standard in Lakshadweep islands we used to see a
PC with a green display on
  a black background, just two "computers" in a locked lab room. ;)

Happy memories.

Actually both are wrong. Parts of Linux kernel and OS itself are
proprietary I think. And Linux is no OS.

But that is okay. Being too pedantic is not the Indian style. ;)

I think some of the technical parts can be dropped.

I would say something like this:

Linux is a platform like Windows that can be used not only on the
desktop but also on phones
 or even embedded systems. Linux is derived from UNIX that led to the
development of
several important technologies like the C programming language, the
TCP/IP that powered
 the Internet and so on.

Linux is always freely available and the open nature led to several
'distributions' or customized
 combination of the main "kernel" and other parts that go towards
building a usable computing
 environment. Some popular examples are Redhat, Ubuntu, CentOS, Suse etc.

There are commercial interests like IBM, Redhat and Novell promoting
the use of Linux and some
 parts of the offering are not free but there are also numerous free
of charge and free to use
 alternatives for the aspiring diligent enthusiast to just use
computers or to learn them.

the present idea will continue.

I thought about it.

Be it my approach towards biz or tech I am yet to see another Girish
or someone even remotely
 sharing my culture and attitude towards knowledge.

So this is too early to expect some Lua ecosystem in India. Worldwide yes.

It will work just like my other initiatives both biz and tech.

India is still in slumber and despite my efforts spanning close to a
decade nothing has happened.

Until people show the interest in learning and the aptitude that I
expect I won't get
confidence.

Thanks.

As others have said, do not do it on the server. Make the server send json
to the browser and use flot.js on the browser side to render the graph.
Flot.js is fairly simple to use.

Posting to this mailing list only may not draw the feedback you are
seeking as you appear to be the only knowledge lua person here.

IMO, blogging would be a better way to share your knowledge.
It would increase your visibility in the global village.  You can
enable talk back for the articles and get your share of brick bats and
bouquets :)

In the past (IIRC personal email) I have suggested this to you.

Others have given feedback on your text and I will not go into that.

Instead I am suggesting to rethink the entire event.

I have been a Linux/open source evangelist to crowds that had little
or no idea about Linux/open source.

After a couple of sessions where I went through a lot of text based
slides (and bored the crowd), I realized the crowd was not interested
in knowing the history.

They were more interested in "What can I do with it?"   This is what
you need to focus on.

My suggestion -

0. Do **not bore** them with tech jargon.
1. Limit your slide presentation to a bare minimum.
2. Put pictures (rather than words) of the major contributors to the
open source movement (Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds,  Eric Raymond,
Bruce Perens, Ian Murdoch etc.)
3. In the present day context - show pictures of where Linux is used
(e.g. Nokia 900, Android phones/tablets, home routers, wifi aps etc.).
4. Jobs Opps -- mention companies like Yahoo!, Hotmail (who started
with a *BSD platform), Facebook, Google, BIG ISPs that open source in
their org.

The above should be no more than 5-10 mins.

Follow it up with contextual demos!  -
the "What can I do with it" angle  -- Demo LibreOffice, GIMP, VLC,
Scribus, Inkscape, GCompris,  Kstars,  Kgeography etc.  (tools that
they can use for their class work).

Discuss career opps (plant the seed early that indeed it is possible
to make money and also get fame in open source) - reiterate the list
of companies above as places that hire such skills.

Finally, **open**  up the discussion with Q&A from the kids and
encourage them to ask questions.  You never know you may end up
inspiring a few youngsters into embracing open source and future
contributors.

Pls. do share your experience after the event and also your presentation.

Remember - to make an impact - you need to *connect* with your
audience, get them excited.  They will do the rest for themselves
(with a little help from you)

Best,
-- Arun Khan

Simple:

Once the spectrogram.png file is created use CSS to set this as the

Hi to all,

Can you imagine Floppy drives Playing James Bond Theme (Yes I meant the
drives, not Floppy disk). Here is something so cool done using GIPO Pins of
Raspberry Pi attached to 8 Floppy Drives!

For those who don't know what Raspberry Pi is, it is a Credit-card sized
computer, powered by customized version of debian Gnu/Linux distro called
as Raspbian !

Here is the link for the Youtube Video:-

An excellent work Shrini.

I will introduce this book to students of Velalar College of
Engineering and Technology (Erode Dt) today as part the FOSS workshop.

Consider doing a similar one for PHP / PERL / Python Also.

Element 14 does not ship to India directly, but there are re-sellers who
buy from them and sell in India.
Ebay.in - http://www.ebay.in/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=160934595001

RS who is also one of the official partner for shipping raspberry Pi ships
directly to India, but they may charge more as taxes
http://in.rsdelivers.com/product/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-type-b/raspberry-pi-type-b/7568308.aspx

Kits and Spares also re-sells them, but there are lot of complaints against
them for late delivery

Message-ID: <CACL+zrXKotfBHnCsveBNguMDS8WoGs7ZfEm1fUaf_wKe8s4h4g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

 I am facing a problem with Umbrello. The Code generation wizard window
does not open properly in windows. In windows i am unable to see the
buttons at the bottom of the page. I have tried changing the resolution.
But it does not solve the problem. But the same works fine in linux. I
googled and found similar complaints from other users. The solutions are to
compile from and source and other such. SInce i am suggesting my students
to use this, these solutions will not help as they would feel uncomfortable
with all the compilation process and will quit using Umbrello. Is there any
other way with which i can correct the problem. I am using windows Xp.

Don't

Seriously, while ChennaiLUG is one of the most inclusive, I think
expecting a LUG to help in using WinXP is quite .... hopeful?

Ugh, I upgraded from mint 13 to 14 last night and now wireless is not working. 

In network connections, is the wireless option turned on?

Try running mintWifi.py and see what happens. Google for location of this script, provide output if not working.

Also provide o/p from iwconfig and lspci.

Subject: [Ilugc] Simple line by line echo in lua
Message-ID: <CALDskyxkZDDgxJGFgqyG-VZY=LHSSwKB+L+59NunugjDA6qUkA@mail.gmail.com>

This is a really nice program.

$ cat fread

#!/usr/local/bin/lua

while true  do
        local line = io.read()

        if line then -- instead of line ~= nil
                print(line)
        end

        if not line then break end
end


It reads each line and prints it out.

Run it like this:

$ ./fread
<type>
.
.
.
<Ctr-D>

Or

$./fread </etc/passwd

I think you can easily follow the code.

I will take you thro' some of the lua rocks or modules in the following week.

We will first look at the interesting socket module.

And we need to also learn lua's coroutines.

I have understood that.

Certain advanced stuff like metatables, weak tables and so on are the
only remaining
items.

And many lua modules have to be looked at.

I certainly want to consider the postgres, SQLite module and many
other utility modules.

Once we advance to that level then we are ready for the talk.

Subject: [Ilugc] sort the file in lua
Message-ID: <CALDskyyXQYtJcsg3Op5XwU-L=nO93XnuDCSrxRHmbMgZt6E7pw@mail.gmail.com>

This is a la the UNIX sort(1) function/utility.

$ cat sort.lua
#!/usr/local/bin/lua
 local lines = {}
    -- read the lines in table 'lines'
    for line in io.lines() do
      table.insert(lines, line)
    end
    -- sort
    table.sort(lines)
    -- write all the lines
    for i, l in ipairs(lines) do io.write(l, "\n") end

Also a way to do the same file echo we did just now:

$ cat anfread
#!/usr/local/bin/lua
local size = 2^13      -- good buffer size (8K)
    while true do
      local block = io.read(size)
      if not block then break end
      io.write(block)
    end

Instead of reading line by line we read block by block.

As you well know this should work well for binary files.

Let us look at the sort function as all others should be easily
decipherable by you.

If you had been following me so far.

$ cat sort.lua
#!/usr/local/bin/lua
 local lines = {}
    -- read the lines in table 'lines'
    for line in io.lines() do
      table.insert(lines, line)
    end

This is the first half.

We are initializing a table lines as {}.

Then we read all the lines into the table using the table method table.insert().

The for line in io.lines() finishes automatically when the file ends.

Now let us look at the second half:

-- sort
    table.sort(lines)
    -- write all the lines
    for i, l in ipairs(lines) do io.write(l, "\n") end

The table.sort() function sorts inplace and we print the new table.

Which could of course have been accomplished using just:

table.foreach(lines, print)

But that gives us line numbers. ;)

Message-ID: <CALV9omYRDNFLD0UGY30SX_FOYRLVTFswytCn9d93XZKWCTKFzQ@mail.gmail.com>

Tool of the Day: Spindown

Spindown is a daemon that can spindown idle disks and so
saving energy and giving the disks a longer lifetime. It works
by checking how many blocks are read and written from the
disks. When no blocks are read or written the disk is idle.
When a disk stays idle long enough spindown uses sg_start
to spin the disk down. It also works with usb disks and
hotswappable disks because it doesn't watch the device name
(hda, sdb, ...), but the device id. This means that it doesn't matter
if the disk is swapped while the deamon is running.

features:

   - Configure every disk separately
   - Logging trough syslog
   - Easy to configure
   - Spindown hot swappable disks

I got mine from the US, thanks to my mother travelling back. I got it
in 20 days in the US. Got a ModelB, wireless keyboard/mouse and a USB
wifi adapter.

My intent was to convert my HDTV into a Smart TV. My nephew all the
donkey's work of downloading the distributions, appropriate package
setc and did the set up. We loaded XBMC/ Rasbian+XBMC /OpenElec to try
how these work. Raspbian + XBMC gave some dependency errors and
rebooted twice. XBMC is good but OpenELEC seems a lot smoother and
responsive. XBMC also rebooted once as I was using it but OpenELEC was
stable.

The wifi dongle RTL8183cu based ran out of the box thanks to the
drivers included in all these distros. The board was powered from the
USB port of the TV and display using HDMI. We tried playing a HD movie
from the sdcard and it played flawlessly. We then tried streaming from
(a) Samba share (b) NFS share. Both resulted in buffering. Increasing
the buffer from 5MB to 150MB delayed the buffering but did not
eliminate it. Wired connections plays without buffering.

Problem area is the wifi. Research showed that the USB port current
draw for external devices is capped at 140mA by polyfuses. Many dongle
drop rates if not enough power is available.

Next steps:
a) Try a mains driven USB power to the R-Pi instead of a 500mA USB
power and see if the wifi dongle operates at higher speeds.
b) Use a powered USB hub for the dongle and see of speeds improve.

P.S: One big surprise I had was that the XBMC interface was operable
using my TV's remote thanks to HDMI's bidirectional control lines. I
also downloaded an Android app for XBMC control and it worked like a
charm.

Dell machines normally use a Broadcom USB wireless device internally.
lsusb will tell you what it is.

The drivers for this are in the restricted drivers section and are not
loaded by default. On your first boot, you would have seen an icon in
the systray for restricted drivers. Clicking that would confirm
restricted drivers loading and then the wifi must work.

The drivers are also available separately for download from the Broadcom site.

Compile the code yourself. Take all the executables and other
binaries, copy to other XP machines and use it. This should work if
Umbrello works after compiling.

Can you plan for a FOSS workshop in your college.  I can help in every
possible way or even make it easier for your students to adapt to
GNU/Linux platform.

Dear all,

Two days FOSS workshop was conducted in Velalar College of Engineering
& Technology, Thindal, Erode Dt. for the Dept. of CSE on 11/01/2013
and 12/01/2013 (http://www.vellalar.com/Engg/index.htm).

About 135+ students from 3rd year CSE attended the workshop.

I would like to thank Prof L.M. Palanivelu, Prof and Head/CSE for
organizing the workshop.

Subject: [Ilugc] Old Computer to give away
Message-ID: <CAN7tdFTSxZdQkdMRfLopkOqDZidk0JxZ5=T=3nysQEdfAyv+FQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I got an old Computer(CPU+CRT Monitor+UPS) that i want to give away.

This was bought in Apr'2000 and has been actively used till Jun 2005 and
then the usage dropped till it went kaput in early 2010. This was my FIRST
computer and my BE project and all my personal projects were done on this.

*Specs:
*Intel P3 733 Mhz , 64 MB RAM
NO Hard-disk
Has a CD and floppy drive.
UPS is dead (but you can prod and see).
17" inches CRT monitor - was last seen working.

I would expect that the computer works perfectly once you setup a harddisk
and then install a bare-bones inux (like archlinux?).  Would be ideal for
someone who wants to experiment.

Pickup has to be arranged by you. Pickup Location : Virugambakkam

Please drop me an email if you want it.

This is really a good usage of the device, rather than buying a smart tv
which comes with pre-built environment and too costly, converting a LED /

I have a LG TV with a USB port to plug in sticks to play media. My
problem is that the supported container formats and codecs were way
too restrictive. Keeping it discrete gives me the option og upgrading
the Smart part at will without having to change the display.

Android-HDMI Stick also may be a good option.Most of these HDMI stick is
having inbuilt Wifi Module and coming with nice remote control.
Its available in the market for 3500- 4000 Rs.

By installing Android-XBMC, this stick can be converted as a powerful HTPC.

Yeah, I came across that device too while surfing, But with Rasperry Pi we
can do more than Playing Media and games, and moreover it is a sad factor
that Android is more prone to adwares and malwares nowadays.

I am working on a script that has something along the similar lines.
I have used jQuery to handle ajax post request, which calls another
file that has mysql insert code.
One way to do is, create a two dimensional array
values = [
    {
         'column1' : 'value',
         'column2' : 'value',
         'column3' : 'value
    },
    {
         'column1' : 'value',
         'column2' : 'value',
         'column3' : 'value'
     }
]
Now to call the mysql script via ajax
$.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url : 'mysql_script.php',
    data : values,
    success : function() {
        //send success message to the user
    }
     error: functional() {
         //send error message to the user
     }
});

Now, in the mysql_script.php file store the parameter i.e. values in a
variable, loop over it and store it in the db

//Connect to MySQL
$values = $_POST['values']
foreach ($values as $value) {
    $column1 = $value['column1'];
    $column2 = $value['column2'];
    $column3 = $value['column3'];
    //MySQL insert query
}

Message-ID: <CALDskywY1kEhjbzHFckK1xfMyfbp3pSMcfF7QtkdUvWJnGwq6w@mail.gmail.com>

Here is the code I got from here:

http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/book/code/plot.lua.html

I tried to tweak it a bit:

$ cat plot.lua

function eraseTerminal ()
  io.write("\27[2J")
end


-- writes an `.' at column `x' , row `y'
function mark (x,y)
  io.write(string.format("\27[%d;%dH.", y, x))
end


-- Terminal size
TermSize = {w = 80, h = 44}


-- plot a function
-- (assume that domain and image are in the range [-1,1])
function plot (f)
  eraseTerminal()
  for i=1,TermSize.w do
     local x = (i/TermSize.w)*2 - 1
     local y = (f(x) + 1)/2 * TermSize.h
     mark(i, y)
  end
  io.read()  -- wait before spoiling the screen
end


-- example
--plot(function (x) return math.sin(x*2*math.pi) end)
plot(function (x) return math.cos(x*2*math.pi) end)
--plot(function (x) return math.tan(x*2*math.pi) end)


Let us look at how it works.

The output is pretty interesting actually.

It plots the graphs we are familiar with.

Here is a sample output:

http://www.spam-cheetah.com/downloads/gra.png

Let us look at the code. First let us look at the very last line.

We call the sine(2pi * x) or cos or tan.

Just google for those waveforms and we can plot them in our code.

But we call the function called plot with a function as an argument.

plot() is passed the argument,

function(x)
  return math.sin(2pix)
end

This is what is passed.

Now let us look at the plot function.

-- plot a function
-- (assume that domain and image are in the range [-1,1])
function plot (f)
  eraseTerminal()
  for i=1,TermSize.w do
     local x = (i/TermSize.w)*2 - 1
     local y = (f(x) + 1)/2 * TermSize.h
     mark(i, y)
  end
  io.read()  -- wait before spoiling the screen
end

It first executes the cls() or clear command by sending a terminal
escape sequence. Which you can see above.

It then accesses the two table elements, screen width and height
declared in a table above.
-- Terminal size
TermSize = {w = 80, h = 44}

Then it accesses a function mark(i,y) which plots.

-- writes an `.' at column `x' , row `y'
function mark (x,y)
  io.write(string.format("\27[%d;%dH.", y, x))
end

It does nothing but a printf() on the x and y coordinate passed as
function parameters.

Our job is now to create the x and y coordinates which is what
plotting actually does.

Wherever it moves we only have to output a special character.

How we compute that is done by the function we pass to the plot() function.

The real heart is just this:

 for i=1,TermSize.w do
     local x = (i/TermSize.w)*2 - 1
     local y = (f(x) + 1)/2 * TermSize.h
     mark(i, y)
  end

We go as far as the terminal width and for each column
 we compute x as the i variable divided by terminal width times 2 - 1.

Why is this done? I dunno. ;)

Maybe one of you could help. I think this is to ensure that we go from
-1 to 1 for the plotting.

For instance, for i = 4, we get x =  -0.81818181818182. How these x
and y coordinates are used in
 graphics only a graphics programmer should tell.

Anyway the y coordinate computation is interesting.

y = (f(x) + 1) /2 * teminal height.

I think I need a backgrounder in this math and plotting to proceed. ;)

Hi

For example if I have several machines distributed through the globe,  Can
I plot them on the batchgeo.com to get an output like the following
http://batchgeo.com/map/0c4831a7a4662537fa1f10106cc100a4
I am also interested in
[i] Changing the colour of the plot if the machine were to be down in that
particular location
[ii] Showing the CPU utilization besides every plot, may be in the rate at
which it blinks or a bar next to it.
[iii] It would help more if the map which is shown changes as per the day
light present areas, like what is given here
http://www.daylightmap.com/index.php

Is there are tool which does this, provided we get a text file with the
required data as input ?

Are you sure zabbix does geographic plotting ? AFAIK it does graphing and 
monitoring. And try to provide more input in your answers rather than one

You must be right and I could be wrong.

>From the text of the OP I found that he wanted network monitoring.

That is what tools like Zabbix provide. Also I never used them.

Geographic plotting and stuff no idea.

Sorry about this confusion.

 RESTful architecture and design - The future of web.

    by Mr. Chandrashekar Babu.

    Brief summary:
    REST is a powerful design pattern that allows architects, developers
    and web designers to perceive web from a different perspective. Many
    web frameworks and applications (Rails, DJango, RIAK) these days
    are designed using the RESTful approach. This talk should provide
    an introduction to REST design paradigms and approach that helps
    audience understand them with better clarity.

    Duration: 30 minutes (approx).

Message-ID: <CALV9omaMo0j3+skYuLixYvuCJYd96mBxtnY6o7O83GORZ+kRqg@mail.gmail.com>

Tool of the Day: Bacula

Bacula is a network client and server based backup software designed
for system administrator who want to manage recovery, backup and
verification of computer data across a network. While being very efficient
and easy to use, Bacula comes with lots of advanced storage management
features. Bacula is relatively easy to use and efficient, while offering
many
advanced storage management features that make it easy to find and
recover lost or damaged files.its back-end is a catalog of information
stored by
MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

features:

   - TCP/IP - client?server communication uses standard ports and services
   instead of RPC for NFS, CIFS, etc. this eases firewall administration
   and network security
   - CRAM-MD5 - configurable client?server authentication
   - GZIP/LZO - client-side compression to reduce network bandwidth
consumption;
   this runs separate from hardware compression done by the backup device
   - TLS - network communication encryption
   - MD5/SHA - verify file integrity
   - CRC - verify data block integrity
   - PKI - backup data encryption
   - POSIX ACL - needed to restore Windows NT ACE's and Samba servers
   - Unicode/UTF-8 - cross-platform filenames
   - VSS - calls Microsoft's snapshot service
   - LVM - pre-script setup for Linux/UNIX snapshot
   - LFS - backup files larger than 2GiB
   - raw - backup devices without a filesystem
   - pooling - allocates backup volumes according to job needs and
   retention configuration
   - spooling - writes backup data to spool until target backup medium is
   allocated so jobs can continue uninterrupted
   - media-spanning - such as spanning tapes
   - multi-streaming - write multiple, simultaneous data streams to the
   same medium
   - ANSI & EBCDIC - IBM compatibility
   - Barcodes - reading tape barcodes in libraries
   - autoloaders - virtually every tape autoloader available (called
   autochangers in Bacula)
   - most tape drives, including DDS, DLT, SDLT, LTO-1-5

Hi Everyone,

I was using justin.tv to broadcast my church activities online - live.

If possible I want some one who is attending these kind of meeting to
implement the same. I wanted to attend these kinds of meetings, but unable
to come from Dharmapuri to Chennai for this.

If the meeting also broadcast over online - live, that will help me to
check the meets. Anyway the picture quality might be low, but the sound
quality is good.

Setup will take only about 5 mins. You can even broadcast using the
Datacard/. I am using Reliance datacard in my case. You can also use any
laptop with embedded webcam in it.

It will be taking about 120MB of bandwidth for 2-2.15 hours.

If any interested volunteer can setup for this meet that would be great. I
look forward for the RESTful architecture and others :-).

Thanks,

Even I would love to attend it from the comfort of my house,  However I
doubt the connection of datacard from that location.

I figured that search tags "network monitoring with geo ip" would
bring up something interesting :)

This is for network traffic monitoring
<http://wiki.networksecuritytoolkit.org/nstwiki/index.php/HowTo_Geolocate_ntop_Data>
but the concept can be extended.   The screen shots show menu items for Zabbix.

Another possible solution (commercial)
<http://www.manageengine.com/products/netflow/network-layout-using-google-maps.html>
take it FWIW.

UML is best when it is used to communicate a design idea to fellow
peers. The usefulness of model-to-code practices/methods is debatable.
In most cases, a white-board works better than the tools.

Students should be taught to design by modelling rather than using a
tool to generate code.

+1 Totally agree.   Students should be taught the fundamentals, when
they write their own code they will know where and what to look for,
to solve bugs in software (be it hand written or tool generated).

Tool of the day: Icinga

 Icinga is an enterprise grade open source monitoring system which
keeps watch over networks and any conceivable network resource,
notifies the user of errors and recoveries and generates performance
data for reporting. Scalable and extensible, Icinga can monitor complex,
large environments across dispersed locations.

 Icinga is a fork of Nagios and is backward compatible. So, Nagios
configurations, plugins and addons can all be used with Icinga. Though
Icinga retains all the existing features of its predecessor, it builds on
them
to add many long awaited patches and features requested by the user
community.

features:

   - Modular architecture with standalone core, UI & database
   - Doctrine abstraction layer, REST & plugin APIs for data access & addons
   - Integrated mobile support, reporting, graphing, business process views
   and more...
   - 100% free and open source with public road map
   - Actively developed by a large team, independent of Nagios
   - Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL & Oracle
   - New Agavi based web interface
   - Continuous and open development
   - Enables distributed systems for redundant monitoring
   - Easy communication with the team
   - Web 2.0  new web interface
   - mobile UI for smart phones
   - Nagios backward compatible

        I have worked in a big organisation that uses concepts of
Model-Driven-Engineering very effectively, and uses model-to-code in
production. And it has been quite successful.

        Not just that, UML, aided with U2TP covers your product and
test designs. And there are tools that take MSCs as inputs and
generate test cases. This way you get really nice path coverage for
testing.

      Agreed :) Unfortunately, students are not taught to design at
all. In most colleges, the "lab exercise" is an exercise in copying
the same code written by a senior and getting full score in for the
lab sessions. Thanks

How does it work when you refactor your design?

       I am not sure if I got your question. You refactor your design,
run make build, you have code generated again. Run make, the code gets
compiled and the binaries are out. Thanks

Message-ID: <CALDskyxQGVq+mk4QtX=sT-Wo=OjqoEGxtOhkAeqUnK2KF4Tv5w@mail.gmail.com>

By word we only mean normal English word.

Just look at :

$ cat fat
girish is here
No LUG class today
But lug tomorrow

later then


Then

$ cat simp.lua
#! lua
      for line in io.lines (arg[1]) do
        if not line:match "lug" then
         print (line)
        end -- if
      end -- for

Now you just run the code like this:

$ lua simp.lua fat

girish is here
No LUG class today

later then

So the output is lines not matching "lug"

This uses the io.lines() function and reads the file name from stdin
(arg[1]) and
 then the if condition does a line:match() which is actually invoked
on the line object
defined above. So the :  syntax.

At any rate try hacking this simple code to do other creative things.

Madan, companies like IBM has Employee purchase program (epp) through which
they sell new and refurbished laptops and PCs.
  http://www.ibm.com/shop/used/epp

You should know an employee to purchase from this website. The laptops come
with warranty and 20-25% inexpensive, than the market rate. I'm sure HP
will also have similar offers for their employees.

I'm sure you will find someone who work in one of these companies!

Tool of the Day: Shinken

Shinken is an open source computer system and network monitoring
software application compatible with Nagios. It watches hosts and
services, gathers performance data and alerts users when things go
wrong and again when they get better. The major improvements of
Shinken over Nagios are the easy load balanced and highly available
architecture. The administrator manages a single configuration, the
system automatically "cuts" it into parts and dispatches it to worker nodes
Shinken is designed to run under all operating systems where Python runs.
The development environment is under Linux, but also runs well on other
Unix variants and Windows.

Tool of the Day: Ksplice

Ksplice is an open source extension of the Linux kernel which
allows system administrators to apply security patches to a running
kernel without having to reboot the operating system (Dynamic Software
Updating).
Ksplice has been implemented for Linux on the x86-32 and x86-64
architectures. It was developed by Ksplice, Inc. until 21 July 2011, when
Oracle acquired Ksplice and started offering support for Oracle Linux.
Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux was dropped and turned into a free
30-day trial for RHEL customers as an incentive to migrate to Oracle Linux
Premier Support Additionally, anyone can use Ksplice Uptrack for free on
Ubuntu Desktop and Fedora.

features:

   - Easy to set up
   - Ksplice Uptrack works perfectly in virtualized environments or on bare
   metal.
   - Rollback capability
   - No performance impact
   - Ksplice Uptrack supports using a standard HTTP proxy to pass through
   your firewall.
   - Conveniently check whether all of your systems are up to date, in one
   place, in your web browser.
   - Secure infrastructure
   - email announcement whenever new updates are available for one of your
   systems.
   - API and monitoring
   - Set access policies for individual or groups of machines.

+1.

IMO, it may be better to own all your data, control it the way you want it
and view/make sense out of it in your own way than use some app which
produces data in a way that is not easy to consume company-wide. For this
reason applications like Zabbix lure you into a trap - they have all these
features you know you want, but they come with a 'technical debt' due to
the various design decisions already made for you (such as to use an RDBMS
backed data store ( or embed SQL everywhere in the application without a
second thought :) ) ) which will bite you at certain scales of operation
even if it "gets you started". The problem with IT is its critical and when
you become dependent on something, you don't want to change it.

So it may be a smarter thing to get the basics right the very first time
and do some work ourselves than go shopping for an "end-to-end solution".
For example, one could use mondemand + LWES to setup a programmable,
distributed event monitoring/management framework. LWES + mondemand helped
us have decentralized, need-based monitoring and IT automation solutions at
a startup where I last worked. Once the basics got setup right, we could
setup a dashboard like the one you're asking for in a couple of days - all
simply because we figured this entire stuff will be data-intensive and
decided to use a Cassandra based custom data store for storing metrics.
Similarly, extending our in-house applications to 'instrument' new metrics
into it was also quite easy. Doing this the "Zabbix" way or "Nagios" way
would have been royally painful since we'd be trying to 'fit' stuff into
the monitoring app than make the system flow its natural course.

Ksplice will stop all the process, bring down the kernel and jump to
the new kernel I think. So it just saves the hardware reboot time to
my knowledge. Please correct me if I am wrong. If that is the case
then it does not provide much help.

it does an inplace patch ( and has its own .ko that needs to be loaded 
first to facilitate that ) - so running stuff stays running, it does aim 
to remove the reboot requirement.

Two questions - [1] Would it be possible for you to put up a
sample/example course ? And, [2] When using links similar to
<http://fossacademy.org/zh-CN/> I notice that a specific small subset
of terms are translated, while the rest are in English - is that
something by design or, is it something that will evolve ?

yes i did put up a small course on the front page, about  localization is
something i have not thought about , yes you would see lots of dead links
etc , which will be eventually be cleaned up , but the code does have
support for localization , would love to hear more on that front and
someone to own it too.

its my bad too ,tried uploading an image of www from
http://search.creativecommons.org/ , i could not there is some error  we
are still looking into it, that way the courses will stand out.already
people are asking me they do not see the course after the write about it ,
the way it works is first it is in  draft mode then you need to publish it
to come on the front page.

What kind of panic you have got, please do some debugging. Use this link <
http://bit.ly/10sjP0b> .

 Sometimes it is due to minor problem like acpi=off or apm=off . If you do
this minor changes into your grub.cfg file then it runs fine.
If it does not solve your problem then follow above post given by selvaraj.

Curl-loader is an open source software performance testing tool
written in the C programming language.simulating application load
and application behavior of thousands and tens of thousand HTTP/HTTPS
and FTP/FTPS clients, each with its own source IP-address. In contrast to
other tools curl-loader is using real C-written client protocol stacks,
namely,
HTTP and FTP stacks of libcurl and TLS/SSL of openssl, and simulates
user behavior with support for login and authentication flavors. Activities
of
each virtual client are logged and collected statistics includes information
about resolving, connection establishment, sending of requests, receiving
responses, headers and data received/sent, errors from network, TLS/SSL
and application (HTTP, FTP) level events and errors.

Message-ID: <CALV9omZ9Kdn2aTd4+dazLmcqiwdRqCSZAT9HpXp=X+OeNuk6+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Tool of the Day: httperf

Httperf is a tool for measuring web server performance. It provides
a flexible facility for generating various HTTP workloads and for
measuring server performance. The focus of httperf is not on
implementing one particular benchmark but on providing a robust,
high-performance tool that facilitates the construction of both micro- and
macro-level benchmarks. The three distinguishing characteristics of
httperf are its robustness, which includes the ability to generate and
sustain server overload, support for the HTTP/1.1 and SSL protocols,
and its extensibility to new workload generators and performance
measurements.httperf is able to test HTTP pipelining workloads.

Not clear if it allows configuration of iptables. Screenshots show
left side menu bar reading settings management but no detailed
screenshot for that option.

Shorewall is by far the best tool I've seen for iptables configuration
through flat files covering all options in iptables and allowing
declaration of variables to be used across the configuration. It has
matured well over the last 15 years and the maintainer Tom Eastap has
done a very good job updating it as iptables has evolved.

Hello Friendly News Editors:

You may wish to notify your readers that an all new, all fresh episode of
the Ubuntu Audiocast has been released for their listening pleasure. A
synopsis:

"Chuck, Bucky, and Philbare talk about people who think Ubuntu is a
product, some new kernel features that you might not have known about, why
scooters in Korea are slow, why people line up for things that are really
mediocre, a hate hotline for Unity, and why marketing people should be
ashamed. They discuss Ubuntu more than that of course, but not enough to
make you think that this is yet another show about software. Enjoy the
show."

Hi ILUGC,

     As some of you might already know, I'm working on an on-line
e-commerce platform to sell pre-installed GNU/Linux PCs in India.

     For this, I have set-up a OSCommerce based web-site at
http://kanini.co.in. But I don't have the required technical know-how and
experience to set-up and operate it successfully. So I'm asking for help
from anyone who is knowledgeable in OSCommerce and PHP. Thanking you in

Baskar from linuxpert.in is doing an awesome service of installing GNU/Linux
in the academic institutes all over TamilNadu.

He also provides the GNU/Linux repositories for free.

As per his request, I ordered the following repository DVDs.

1.  LinuxMint 14 (i386) Software Repository

http://www.osdisc.com/products/linux/linuxmint/linux-mint-14-software-repository-pc.html
14 DVDs -> US$ 31.95

2.  LinuxMint 13 (i386) Software Repository

http://www.osdisc.com/products/linux/linuxmint/linux-mint-13-software-repository-pc.html
16 DVDs -> US$ 35.95

3.  Ubuntu 12.10 (i386) Software Repository

http://www.osdisc.com/products/linux/ubuntu/ubuntu-1210-software-repository-pc.html
13 DVDs -> US$ 29.95

4. Ubuntu 12.04 (i386) LTS Software Repository

http://www.osdisc.com/products/linux/ubuntu/ubuntu-1204-lts-software-repository-pc.html
16 DVDs -> US$ 35.95

It cost Rs 7410.

I received the DVDs today and handedover to Baskar.

Why not download the repository from internet? If it is larger I think
there must be some way to get the copy of the repository from IITM
mirror. Why 7k+ should be wasted?

+1 in puzzlement.
Actually, why not ask the community at large for help getting the repos? Pretty certain that, even if not IIT-M, some others would be able to provide them to you. Is there a specific reason why the media was sources done from the various orgs?

I could also contribute by downloading part of the repository if there
is some way to do that. Some one can write an application / shell
script to do a distributed download (based on the number of
volunteers, their download capability and their connection speed).
Once all the files are fetched the volunteers could meet and sync with
each other. Then they can distribute to anyone who needs. Main task
will be writing such an application. Technical issues (like repository
getting updated in between etc) must be discussed and solved for that.

7K is not a loss - it is now being used for funding the sustenance of
those distros. And colleges might be more interested in a work product
from the distro source - more attractive, easy to sell into the
organization. Baskar, with his experience in training, am sure would
be using CD copies wherever he can.

The question here is not about alternatives - its about supporting
somebody who is actively working in this area.

Hi Kumaran,

I faced the similar issue some time back but I am not able to recollect
what exactly I did to roll back.

I am forwarding this request to Mr. Manvendra Bhangui who active Indimail
Developer. You will get help once he is online.

You can also be part of Indimail google group where the developer is very
active and get quick help.

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/indimail

Thanks

Please do check if you have the directory /var/log/indimail with the
following permissions

indimail:/var/log>ls -ld indimail
drwxr-xr-x. 31 qmaill nofiles 4096 Sep 29 07:59 indimail


The stdout and stderr are all redirected to individual fifos and picked up
by a program called multilog. If multilog is not able to create the new
files or write to the log files, the fifo get full. The design is such that
not a single line of any error message can ever get lost in indimail

Next time you want to clear the log files, issue the following command

# /var/indimail/bin/svc -a /service/*/log
# find /var/log/indimail -name '@*' -exec rm -f {} \;

It might be worth confirming that - very little from these retail 
outlets actually makes its way back to the projects / distro's doing the 
work.

mailman is a popular mailing list tool that will work with just about all
standard mailing software. http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html

By "test", I'm guessing you mean "how to set it up?" or do you mean how to
do "QA"?

For office production it is suggested to have wired connections as wireless
lag in transfer speed.

It also depends on the type of adapter and AP you are using.

IMO don't go for wireless.

Since fedora is one of the most widely used / known distro in colleges
and also easy to setup Lab using PXE based automated kickstart
installations.

Yes.  I introduce both Mageia (though not a spin, but a fork of
Mandriva) / Fedora for colleges.

Hi Mohan..,

             How r u man..,i hope u are fine..,


   There are Two ways  "To Change the Wired Connection to Wireless
Connection "

       1.USB Type Adapter            /* Not Like means*/

       2. PCB Slot Adapter           /* You Go to Second One */

            First You Check whether all your Desktop pcs are having that pc
Ethernet slot., Then You Adapt the Wireless PC Receiver on it.,It will
Receive the signal from "Wireless Modem".

      Here you can use different vendor type for communication.(like modem
in Beetel and receiver in different vendor like netgear).


         Please go through it mohan. surely ,it will full-fill your
requirement.

You will have to create a "site list" mailing list called "mailman" by
running the newlist mailman.

You have to configure it.

Read the documentation of mailman for how to install and configure.

Tool of the Day: GKrellM

GKrellM (GNU Krell Monitors) is a computer program based on
the GTK+ toolkit that creates a single process stack of system
monitors. It can be used to monitor the status ofCPUs, main
memory, hard disks, network interfaces, local and remote mailboxes,
and many other things. Plugins are available for a multitude of tasks, e.g.
controlling theXMMS media player or a SETI at home client from within
the stacked monitor.

features:

   - Hostname/system name display.
   - Clock/calendar.
   - SMP CPU monitor that can chart individual CPUs and/or a composite CPU.
   - Each sensor monitor has a configurable alarm and warning.
   - Process monitor with a chart for load and forks and a display of
   number of current processes and users.
   - Disk monitor that can chart individual disks or a composite disk.
   - Internet monitor (http, ftp, ...) that displays current tcp port
   connections and charts historical port hits for over two days.
   - Net interface monitors with charts for all routed net interfaces. Data
   rx/tx LEDs and a timer button that can be linked to a ppp or isdn net
   interface and displays on line time.
   - Memory and swap space usage meters, and a swap page in/out chart.
   - File system meters which show capacity/free space and can mount/umount.
   - A mailbox monitor which can launch a mail reader, a mail fetch/check
   program, and a sound notify command. Builtin new mail message checking for
   mbox, maildir, MH, POP3, and IMAP mailboxes.
   - APM laptop battery meter with a configurable alarm and warning for low
   battery time left.
   - Uptime display.
   - Multiple monitors managed by a single process to reduce system load.
   - Charts have auto scaling or fixed scaling modes.
   - Commands can be configured to run when monitor labels are clicked.
   - gkrellm can run in client mode and collect data from a gkrellmd server
   running on a remote machine.
   - Both gkrellm and the gkrellmd server are plugin capable so special
   interest monitors can be coded.

Message-ID: <CAHhM8gAcjz7s9D2=FJ6sS+MxA4DgcPbXn2VUP_ark6dmjRVu1A@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I am looking for Wi-Fi AP that:

1. Is stable (does not require frequent reboot or power OFF/ON)
2. Supports 802.11 b/g/n
3. Supports up to WPA2-Enterprise (RADIUS auth)  - a *must*
4. Has external Antenna

Desirable - Accepts DD-WRT / OpenWRT images.

Many list members may be using these Wi-Fi features in their own
office / home and I would appreciate if you could share you
experience.
Please mention brand/model.

PS - There are lot of brands claiming features and performance.
Unfortunately, they can be verified only after one has purchased such
an unit.   In the past, I have used Linksys and Buffalo.  Linksys has
been OK but with internal antenna, range is suspect (at least in my
experience).   The Buffalo APs, on paper have great feature and few
models do accept DD-WRT firmware.  However, I have had heating issues
- over a period of time the WLAN would disappear.  The only way I
could solve it was to power them OFF, let it cool and then power them
ON.  Buffalo was great in the RMA dept. but the brand new replacements
had the same problem.

TIA,

I see D-Link and Asus recommended often. You could check the smallnetbuilder website for reco and amazon and newegg for the reviews.

Hi Arun,


I am using the Asus wireless router RTN12LX for 1+ years with the daily
usage about 18hrs scheduled download without any hassle.

It also has RADIUS support and its SPI firewall is well and good.

It has official support for linux.

You can look at http://in.asus.com/Networks/Wireless_Routers/RTN12LX/

Is DD-WRT supported on any of the routers available in the India market? I
am looking for integrating DD-WRT with Coovachilly + Radius server. I have
a old Linksys WRT54G, however not sure which one amongst current routers
support DD-WRT.

Thanks

Tool of the Day: Conky

  Conky is a free software system monitor for the X Window System.
It is available for Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD. Conky is highly
configurable and is able to monitor many system variables including
the status of the CPU, memory, swap space, disk storage, temperatures,
processes, network interfaces, battery power, system messages, e-mail
inboxes, Arch Linux updates, many popular music players (MPD, XMMS2,
BMPx, Audacious), and much more.

  Unlike system monitors that use high-level widget toolkits to render their
information, Conky is drawn directly in an X window. This allows it to
consume relatively fewer system resources when configured similarly.
it has built in IMAP and POP3 support. it can be extended using built
in Lua support, Conky can display this info either as text, or using simple
progress bars and graph widgets, with different fonts and colours.

Tomato is another firmware that has earned kudos. I beleive some of
the firmware options like that from Sveasoft has an option of
increasing radio power to increase range on any router e.g. Linksys
where the hardware is capable of higher power but capped by software.

There are quite a few easily available ones. I use Asus RT N13U. It
works with DD-WRT perfectly. Only reason I am not able to use DD-WRT
on it is due to DD-WRT not supporting my data card, which is my sole
internet connectivity.
I doubt it meets Arun's requirements though as it's range isn't all
that great, but it works for me as the area in which I require Wi-Fi
is pretty limited.

Tomato has a variant called TomatoUSB that runs on Broadcom powered
boxen like the Linksys/Buffalo etc. Check that out and amybe you'd
have something going.

Dear All,

I would like to know from this list if anybody has used ZeroShell (
http://www.zeroshell.net/)

I am trying to add two ISP connections and distribute the same to all the
users in an Organization.

But the following problems are encountered:

1. Most of the systems are having One ethernet (which is onboard) and only
one PCI slot.

2. In the market getting Dual NIC is becoming difficult and also want to
know - if anybody tried differently.

Assuming you are getting two ethernet connections from these ISPs with
static IPs, assign two IP addresses to the same NIC, one each in the
same subnet as the ISP. Connect the ISP links and the ethernet from
the server to a hub/bridge.

1) Another option is to try USB ethernet dongles on the server.
2) Most servers come with dual NIC as a standard, even the smallest ones.

Yes.  It is awesome.  I am using it in my office and have also
deployed it at a few client sites using PCEngines ALIX boards (3
NICs).

What kind of form factor boards are you using?  Most microATX do have
couple of PCI-e slots and you can put PCI-e NICs in them.

In Mumbai, they are available but the cost is not worth it.

You can get quad port (used) Gb NICs on ebay.us for under USD100.
Ping your US based friends to ship one to you.  Avoid direct India
shipments from the vendor; S&H charges are on the high side usually.

Soekris quad / dual port PCI cards are also a good option if fast
ethernet is good enough for you.

As an alternate you can try good quality USB > RJ45 adapters but I
would not recommend them for office use.

Few days ago, I have collected the list of open source projects to do in Tamil.

see it here.
https://goinggnu.wordpress.com/2013/01/08/open-source-projects-to-do-in-tamil-computing/

On seeing the list, RajKumar <t.rajkumar2020 AT gmail DOT com>
created the software to convert numbers to text in tamil.

See it in action here.

It is in javascript.

Thanks for rajkumar for creating such good application.

We can port this into other languages easily now.

Subject: [Ilugc] Gaming on Linux - Steam
Message-ID: <1622537.urvR2HiI2m@anandlaptop>

Hi All,

I am sure most of you would be aware of the recent developments in Gaming on 
Linux, Steam - a gaming distribution company with ~ 70% market share of gaming 
market, has launched its beta version for Linux client and is also actively 
promoting usage of Linux to all users.

Gaming in Linux is a much awaited feature and Steam venturing into Linux will 
hopefully encourage many game development companies to port existing popular 
titles and also create new games with native support for Linux. I have read 
many stories / concerns of people dual-booting Windows only for the sake of 
games. Gabe Newell, CEO of Steam, is much bullish on Linux as a platform and 
planning for Console - Steam Box, as well.

I have downloaded Steam client for Linux in my laptop (runs Linux Mint 13) 
which has modest specs (4GB RAM, 1GB Nvidia Graphics card - Optiumus 
technology and hence needs installation of bumblebee). 

I am not much of a gamer myself but installed Steam such that  1) To 
experiment - Team Fortress II is a free-to-play first person shooter game which 
runs fine but massive 12 GB download 2) By installing we expand Linux user 
base. Though, Steam would surely expect to buy game titles.

Keen to hear experiences of other ilugc memebers on this subject.

Cheers,
Anand R

There is an Intel dual NIC available for 2.5k

I buy from Richie street. Also in Bangalore. I am sure you will get in
Hyd as well.

I wonder why no one in LUG knows this.

You can put two of them in two PCI and you get 5 NICs right?

Tool of the Day: vnstat

vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor for Linux
and BSD that keeps a log of network traffic for the selected
interface(s). It uses the network interface statistics provided
by the kernel as information source. This means that vnStat
won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also ensures light use
of system resources. However, in Linux at least a 2.2 series
kernel is required.

features:

   - quick and simple to install and get running
   - gathered statistics persists through system reboots
   - can monitor multiple interfaces at the same time
   - several output options
      - summary, hourly, daily, monthly, weekly, top 10 days
      - optional png image output (using libgd)
   - months can be configured to follow billing period
   - light, minimal resource usage
   - same low cpu usage regardless of traffic
   - can be used without root permissions
   - online color configuration editor
