yes, but the poll is rather a thin sample; a total of about 750 
people
worldwide have filled an on-line survey indicating they use mandrake 
as
their dektop linux. about 400 ticked suse and some 300 indicated 
redhat...

sriram

I agree,

But i have seen other polls are also pointing in similar fashion.
I don,t remember the links now
