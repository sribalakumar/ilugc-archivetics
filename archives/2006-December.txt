Hi all,

Mark Shuttle worth came on IRC to answer Ubuntu user's question Ubuntu
Open Week. Here is what he had to share on Free Software in Education...

---------------------------------
sabdfl(18:29:57) amachu: QUESTION: Education sector the real arena where
Ubuntu can prove decisive.. Mark, how do compare with Microsoft's
educational suites with Edubuntu?  

sabdfl:         I think the best thing that free software does in
education is
DIVERSITY  

sabdfl:         we don't (yet) have the best word processor  

sabdfl:         though we have at least three *pretty good* ones  

sabdfl:         what we do have is a huge spectrum of tools  sabdflfor
all
sorts of disciplines  

sabdfl:         music, art, maths, physics, statistics, programming,
design  

sabdfl:         you name it  sabdfland those tools are free of charge  

sabdfl:         and OPEN  

sabdfl:         you can see how the tools work  sabdfland you can shape
them  

sabdfl:         that's a treasure chest for education  

sabdfl:         especially in places where the kids are often smarter
than the
teachers  

sabdfl:         so, we should focus on that

technically xen supports memory quotas, and you cant exceed the  
quota. But in practice, nothing is perfect - and however sincere the  
hoster is, he is tempted to get more bang for his buck and squeezes  
in too many vpns on one server - and everything goes phut.

in short, you propose ASP.net as a substitute for getting/training  
good programmers and taking the effort to develop a team with good  
programming practices, or in a word, as a substitute for hard work -  
as for me, I believe there is no substitute for hard work.

Sorry to hijack the thread. But Network is simply not working for me on
Xen. I had posted it earlier to ILUG-C with no replies. I have tried
both Ubuntu's stock Xen enabled kernel and the Xen Binary install on
their website. Does someone else have/solved the problem?

not exactly - if you use wxPython, boa constructor is an all  
encompassing IDE - and python for doze has some nifty ides also

But the point is that foss programming is not like doze programming.  
The whole approach is different - here we dont blindly drag and drop.  
we try to understand what we are doing. So dont expect things to be  
'like' the doze equivalents.

Hello,

I installed the Xen hypervisor kernel

am using edgy on my PC. Some of my hardware setting are here:

I am able to work fine from the stock kernel. However, when I boot into
the Xen enabled kernel, I am unable to ping any website. Any one know
any reasons?

What do you mean by this ? Mean mixing up Python and PHP codes, then NO!
Or, meaning 'can I do with Python what PHP can do?' Of course, you can!

and Does python have a IDE
> like Visual Basic or .Net?
You mean for GUI development ? Eric3 is a good GUI for Python 
programming. You can also make use of `QtDesigner` to develop GUIs as in 
VB, change the .ui file into .py file using `pyuic` and import it to 
your .py module.

Do you really think PHP requires better coding skills than .NET? Anyone
with a half a brain can start coding in PHP in a day's time... .NET / J2EE
has a steeper learning curve.

But once you learn .NET or J2EE, you can start working with them and use
the advanced features easily. with PHP, you will have to reinvent the
wheel.

Frankly, comparing ASP.NET to PHP5 is equivalent to comparing C++ with
GWBasic - that is, there is no comparison.

ASP.NET is far more mature than PHP in every sense. It is better to
compare ASP.NET with Java/J2EE than with PHP.

But since we are comparing ASP.NET to PHP, some points that come to mind:

- the ASP.NET tools are better and are available free (Visual Web
Developer Express is available free and so also MS Expression Designer).

- The width and depth of the functions available in the libraries which
form part of .NET / Java and J2EE cannot be matched by PHP.

- ASP.NET / J2EE has support for writing layers of business logic which
can then be reused across applications (both web and desktop), across
machine boundaries etc. If you write your routines in PHP, you cannot
really reuse them in anything other than PHP web solutions - you cannot
have desktop applications using the same code.

- Webservices / remoting / RMI etc... Try doing these properly in PHP.

- Speed of execution is better because of compiled code (you can argue
about Zend but it is hard to beat ASP.NET / Java in speed)

That is just a few points.. there are many, many more points which can be
mentioned.

But having said that, PHP is far easier to code in..and if you want
something developed quickly, and this something is not too complex, then
it is best done in PHP. Hosting a PHP solution is easier and much cheaper.
So for most cases, PHP is a good option.

Thanks,
PK

i wasnt saying that - i was only commenting on the OP's statement  
that if his programmers werent too good he would go for asp.net. If  
your programmers are not too good - the code will be crappy  
regardless of the language/platform you use.

right - because they have very little hardware - mostly software,

Using gentoo, hmmm.... why not use "emerge genkernel"?

my boot partition is ext2 and root is ext3, my system is pIII 733 intel 810.

the modules depends on ur needs, it is very clear in the documentation you
are following.. if you dont know what to load in, just use the default
configuration that comes with..

i agree with you on there is no substitute for hard work. What I am
trying to say here, is,  instead of spending time on reinventing the
wheel, one can concentrate on adding more functionalities and
enhancements to the existing application. Having said that, I am not
saying that it is not possible to write good OO programs in PHP. But
it is just that it demands more work from programmers.

I agree again :). My personal belief is, the quality of programmers
required for writing "good" PHP applications should be really high.
The reason is PHP gives way too much space for committing errors. But
with ASP.Net, even a novice to that language can come up with a very
good program, because, the language doesn't give you much of "freedom"
to commit mistakes.

> Do you really think PHP requires better coding skills than .NET?

Yes "coding skills", PHP requires better coding skills, better than
what .Net requires. I agree that the learning curve is steep. But once
you get hold of the framework knowledge, you can start writing good
programs from the day one, without much of programming skills. The
reason is the amount of code you actually write for  developing
ASP.Net application is very less compared to PHP. That drastically
reduces the risk of bugs, manageability and puts the dependency more
on the process/application using which the program is developed than
on the person who is developing it.

Indeed. For an example, take a look at Gallery (gallery.menalto.com).
And if FN is listening, it is written by an Indian chap who now works
for Google.

Surprisingly, when I did an 'apt-cache search gallery', it was available 
in the Ubuntu repos. Will give it a shot and post back :D

FN doesnt listen - we are supposed to listen to him ;-) And i think

Basically, block device, initrd support for ramdisk:

  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD
 
SCSI support needs to be enabled:

  CONFIG_SCSI
  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD

Your filesystem support:

  CONFIG_EXT3_FS
  CONFIG_EXT2_FS

Philosophically speaking - I cannot always have what I want. But here
is the situation.
I am a pc assembler trying to promote linux with all I have and this
is one area I stumble upon. For new systems there is not much problem
because people go with broadband and there is no need for modems. For
old systems there are quite a lot of people who still rely on dialup.
I am trying to make people to switch to linux. But when it comes to
internal modems I am stuck. I can make somebody to spend 250Rs and
switch to linux because I can convince them that it is more secure and
there are no viruses. but making somebody spend 1500 is a tough call.
I know there are internal modems that are supported in linux. I just
dont know which all are available in our Indian market. That is the
area where I need help with.

Yes! I had been using etch (Testing) as my production machine at home. 
It was fantastic. As a move to test Debian unstable (sid), I moved my 
production machine to Arch Linux (which is much more faster/better 
response to applications). Now I am running sid (not etch), though it is 
called unstable, it is much stable than many other stable distro.

Or did you mean unsurprisingly? :). Gallery indeed is a good project -

Well, I wouldn't be so harsh - G2 has vastly improved features. I did
go through:

Guys,

I am continuously facing problem using net in my Ubuntu or Debian ( both of
them). The thing is, i configured my lan card anyway. And if i ping, then
it can reply  from server. And my network bar shows that, network is on and
going on. But, i cannot access to internet from any kind of browser like
firefox or konqueror. I put the proxy address exactly which i get in Windows
Firefox. It was 192.168.10.205 port 0. but the thing is, nothing happen in
Linux. But in windows, i can use internet.

I think i can describe you my problem.
If you need any query about this problem, let me know..

all you need to do is get in touch with marvin stodolsky, the
linmodems maintainer at linmodems.org, you will get the procedure
which will be something like you run the diagnostic tool sent by them
, copy and return the output for receiving the correct driver for
making your existing softmodem( ! ) fully operational. incidentally,
it is indians like soumyendu sarkar who have developed the basic stuff
to make such linmodems too to work; there has been much development in
this field and it was thanks to marvstod(marvin stodolsky) that i
could get my agere systems modem to work on my acer 4152 NLCi laptop
to work !

Message-ID: <c293dd340612030022l44087061y14305960323dcd95@mail.gmail.com>

I managed to snag a Linksys WRT54GS from a friend who returned from
the US recently. AS with all consumer electronics from the USA, this
one also runs on AC 120 V as input using a power adapter. I managed to
get a plug-in type 240V to 110V step down transformer from a local
electronics shop for the power adapter.

My problem is that when I used the transformer/adapter combo with the
router the power LED keeps blinking and does not come to the "constant
always on" state it's supposed to (as per the User Manual). The manual
asays that the power LED flashes when powered on and finally comes to
"rest" after self-disgnosis.

Googling didn't help as all "constant LED flashing" problems are
attributed to failed flashing of openwrt firmware.

I did try setting up static IP on one of my PC's and pinging the IP
address set in the router(192.168.1.1) but got no ACK's.

Now, here are my questions;
1. What's the best way to run US-centric electronics (routers etc) in
India ? What power-solutions do people use ?
2. Have other Linksys WRT54G users faced similar problems ?
3. How good is the Linksys support in chennai ? the website does give
me a chennai number which I'll be calling tomorrow (mon).

Thanks,
Toufeeq
PS: Not marked OT as the router runs Linux and will run the community
based openwrt once I get it to work.

Routers etc. have SMPS units that are capable of handling input in
both 110V and 230V AC.

> 2. Have other Linksys WRT54G users faced similar problems ?

I'm a 3Com man myself. My OfficeConnect unit has been "serving" me for
couple of years now, both in India and abroad without any problems.

I dont think a simple step down transformer would help! In the US it
is 110V @ 60 hertz but here it is 220V @ 50 hertz. AFAIK, transformers
cannot change the num of cycles.

Tread with caution.... you might be frying your router!

I've used a 4/5 Linksys wireless and wired router boxes with such 
convertors for 4 years now. Works fine. The frequency does not matter as 
the system ultimately runs on DC (and the power supplies do not refuse 
to rectify 50Hz AC -:)). I'm stumped as to why it is not working.

It would be a good idea to check the output of the convertor. If it is 
low, then the output to the router would be below acceptable levels - 
possibly giving rise to your problem.

Have you faced a case of the "constant blinking power LED" before ?

The output from the transformer or the adapter is not low. I've re-checked that.
I'll mostly be trying out a 220V power adapter which gives 12 V DC o/p
instead of using the step down transformer.

                  I've run a Linksys WRT54GS (US model, very similar to the
WRT54G)
in Chennai with a Shah Electronics 220v->110v converter and the stock
Linksys
wall-wart. It works just fine, and doesn't depend on the AC mains frequency.
However, the wall-wart may run hotter or get fried prematurely because of 50
Hz -
its impedance is lower at 50 Hz. I didn't run into any probs and was able to
flash mine with OpenWRT and play with it for a few hours.

    My guess is that your WRT54G may have already been through a bad
reflashing attempt and returned to the store, which then sold it back
(retailers
like Fry's Electronics at Sunnyvale routinely do this, and they're legally
allowed to do it as long as it is clearly marked as a return). The full
warranty is usually available in all such cases, but that's not much comfort
when you're sitting here.

   I believe there are ways to recover and reflash a WRT54G when it's
blinking
red - it still has an intact boot block, and has a fallback tftp-based
reflash
procedure for this case. Do a Google search for details - BAWUG or Seattle
Wireless should have the details on their Wiki(s). There are also ways to
use
a JTAG header to recover, but that requires some soldering and similar
stuff.

did u try to ping the ip address or ping the host name , if you  ping the ip
, then try the hostname , maybe its a dns issue.

and one more thing , if you are able to pingthe serve , which means there is
already a route to the server without the proxy , then why do you need to
use proxy ? Or are you mentioning your gateway as the serve ??

Yeah that's the conclusion I'm coming to too, and something I was
worried about. Returning it at the Wal-Mart is not a problem. :)

yeah, will try and reflash it and look at alternates before it send it
off to the US.

I have a few Linksys routers. But I am not using the step down
transformer. Most of the Linksys models take 12V DC (Max 1A). I bought a
few SMPS (looks similar to Laptop charger but much smaller in size) of
12V/1-2A. I keep away from transformers because they are bulky and
produce some weird sound some times. SP Road in Bangalore has very good
SMPS collection of this sort. Maybe Ritchie Road should also carry some.

Thanks for the tip. That should work for an existing modem. I am
talking about buying a new internal modem that could possibly work out
of the box. For example the old motorola sm56 had motorola support
till suse 9. I think they pulled out of the softmodem business now. I
know that Lucent and conextant has linmodem chipsets. I just dont know
which brand these linmodems appear in the market as. Say, if they come
in Mercury Internal modems then I can just buy mercury internal modems
and plug and play with the driver installed. So if any of you guys
know any of the brands under which linmodems come in Indian market
then that would be great.
Cheers

Not that you missed, but I am surprised your Linksys WRT54GS did not
ship with a universal power adaptor. I have bunch of WRT54Gs (NOT GS)
and all of them do 110 AND 240 AC.

You have to take this with dollops of salt and I do not how the
internal works with this Linksys router, but the equipments that I
have handled will not "rest" if the polarity of the AC terminals are
swapped.

The routers (and other gizmos) shipped with universal power adaptors.
The only precaution I take is to draw power from a decent UPS.

Nope.

Polarity of the AC terminal?? What is that? Which is the positive. I
have a whole lot of gadgets I plug in from all directions. Please give
more details on this polarity aspect of AC.

In proper wiring phase will be in right side and neutral will be in
left side of a plug point. May be he is refering that.

I guessed that as well, but I never knew they mattered when you plug
in a supply! Shame on my EE knowledge!

IMHO, you need not feel shame. Think of this practical situation: when 
you plug in you mobile phone recharger, do you mind how you plug it in? 
i.e. do you mind which is phase and neutral in the pin and the plug hole 
? Polarities matter only in DC power sources, or when a device is 
designed to consume DC power. But in a AC power supply, anyways you 
current and voltage are swinging from negative to positive max and back, 
i.e. its varying with time.

Am afraid, from my vanishing knowledge of EE, that the problem comes 
during the conversion of AC to DC, i.e. rectification that some 
converters are designed such that they do not produce the proper 
polarity when you change the phase and neutral (which I think, should 
not be the way).

Correct me if am wrong somewhere, especially the EE people of IIT in 
this list ;)

Precisely what I know so far.

Well, I doubt if that is the case at all.  I don't remember reading
anywhere about Phase Neutral wiring in AC-DC Conversion. In my
opinion, if you interchanged the two, the half cycles might be the
otherway, but the dc is still positive n volts! Even this sounds kinda
ridiculous to me.

Anyway, I think we are going way OT on this and try answer toufeeq's
problem if not bother about the polarities in a rectifier.

It is really not an issue how you plug to an AC source. Polarity is only
 for DC sources. In AC power systems, instead of the current flowing
continuously in one direction, it reverses many times per second. There
is no importance of polarity.

I didn't do anything. At the end of the day the connection is immediate.
The same with file transfer also. Any reason?

re-flashed the firmware by using the official firmware and it started working.
The support center in chennai is actually good and technically
adequate to handle linux users.

Message-ID: <feff2f50612040719u20eb1b44nf3134b59d9c29f27@mail.gmail.com>

I have one ADSL router to connect to the internet.
I usually connect my D-Link DI-524 wireless router to ADSL router so that we
can use my laptop and desktop together.

Few days ago the ADSL router was changed to new one. Ever since then I am
not able to connect my through my wireless router.

I have tried all the settings like changing MTU. But nothing works.
I can connect using the desktop but not using my wireless router.
Any clues on how to resolve this?

Thanks in advance.

Probably your VPI/VCI values changed. Check your desktop machine's
ADSL configuration for the new numbers and enter them in the router's
configuration.

If your desktop box is using Windows, the VPI/VCI values are commonly
shown in the number-to-dial box (if it says 0,32 then VPI = 0 and VCI
= 32), but could be just about anywhere in the custom ADSL connection
software.

Geez, I meant DC - DC reverese polarity! Thanks to a diode bridge
rectifier some devices can handle this, while some do not.

Anyway, Toufeeq got it to work so I will stop here.

I just didn't want to answer, but couldn't help! Does immersion heater
or stove rectify the supply? I haven't any knowledge of these

Immersion heaters or stoves don't care about polarity. The shock might
have been because of the insulation breakage due to usage with
inadequate or no water. I have used immersion heaters for four years in
my hostel lives at MIT. It used to have just two pins which allows the
possibility of swapping polarities. I never got a shock in my life. The
same applies to the stoves as well. Polarity is not an issue for single
phase AC devices.

i have got shocks from fridges, microwave ovens and ordinary stoves -  
when cross-wired, tester will glow when touching a metal part. Again,  
I dont know the theory - but i have felt the pain ;-)

Usually the phase is connected through the switch and the neutral
directly to the device. SO when the switch is OFF there is no power
supply to the device. When it is done otherwise, the phase is
connected directly with the device and even when the switch is OFF
there is power in the device (eddy loss). So when you touch it you
close the circuit to the ground and get a shock. Again, this can
happen only if the insulation in the device is not proper.

Right. I also have that experience. ;)

But that is bcoz as usual most products in India are actually extremely low quality products.

There is so much corruption around which is evident in the fact that you cannot even trust the ISI mark sometimes...

And immersion heaters are notorious for this sort of thing.

I wonder if this has any technical reasoning behind it at all.

I doubt.

Are you using any chooser program like xdm/kdm/gdm/wdm?

If so, selecting fluxbox in the dropdown menu(if it has it) will solve.

If instead you start X manually then, you need .xinitrc for invoking your favorite window manager.

You can try giving the full path of fluxbox in your exec command.

Of course if you start fluxbox from the console, you will get this error but then I think you know that already. :)

The shock on the other devices were because of the improper
earth/ground. It is not because they are cross-wired as there is no
concept of cross-wiring in single phase AC (talking just about
live/phase and neutral terminals).

When the theory is not known, it is better to ask for why is it so
rather than coming into some quick conclusion.

Just create a file named ".xsession" in your home directory with execute 
permissions and add the line "exec /path/to/yourwm".

In GDM, choose the system default or something equivalent.  It'll run 
"$HOME/.xsession".

Unfortunately there is no correct or standard way to do it.

I mostly use wdm and I manually add them. I know it is ugly but...

I suggest you see below instead.

This should work without issues.

Usually the problem is only in getting the X server to run.

I think you don't have a problem there.

After that it is all cake walk. :)

After a long period of inactivity in ILUGC (3+ years), my first post was
something that is not related to the Linux at all. I really am not sure
whether that is credit. Anyways, I will take it.

so what does this mean:

<quote>

Swapping live and neutral wires. In many countries this is not  
regarded as an error and it is perfectly feasible to design  
appliances such that they will be safe (e.g. by using double pole  
switches and protection devices) under this condition. However if  
appliances are intended for use only in countries that take care to  
avoid live/neutral swaps then they may have only a single pole switch  
which on live-neutral reversal will end up in the neutral wire,  
leaving portions of the device live at all times. This does not pose  
immediate danger but increases the risk of shock if there is another  
fault or if someone tries to work on the appliance without  
disconnecting it. For example if live and neutral have been swapped  
in lamps, the shell of the lamp base will be connected to the line,  
greatly increasing the risk of shock when changing light bulbs.

You needn't login as root user. Do anything root should be doing by
prefixing with a sudo command. Password will be your password,
assuming you are the only user in the system

Hi.

to add a user in ubuntu,

$sudo adduser <username>

The password is the first users password.

To create the user "root" and set a password

$sudo passwd root

now you are setting the password for root.

Can any ubuntu fans tell me why ubuntu follows this thing?
Is ubuntu is going to become a single user OS?
or it hates the root user?

Well, good that you couldn't login as root. Because, at least then you 
will find an alternate way of doing things which need administrator 
permissions. Logging in as root is bad habbit.

Though there is a way to enable root user, am not going to speak about 
it as it may lead to you logging in as root :p

If you are in Ubuntu, then you can do things which otherwise need 
superuser permissions, by using the sudo command. When you use sudo, you 
don't change to root user, rather get superuser privileges for your user 
account, so that you can perform such tasks.

This is given with respect to the use of a switch only. Most (all) of
the electric devices that have switches keep the switch control on the
so called live/phase line. Reversing the terminals may lead the live
wire to by-pass the switch which could cause shocks when you come into
contact with any of those wires. But this is more an usability issue.
The behavior of the device (functionality) will not change when you
reverse the terminals.

Nobody hates root user, but we just made an attempt to eradicate the bad 
habbit of logging in as root. Though people argue still bad things can 
be done with sudo, at least people get rid of the root-user-bad-habbit.

There is a small article about why root user login is bad, check this

Well, this is exactly what many people have been saying in this thread
- that swapping phase and neutral pins is harmless in most cases.
Quoting Mano:

"Usually the phase is connected through the switch and the neutral
directly to the device. SO when the switch is OFF there is no power
supply to the device. When it is done otherwise, the phase is
connected directly with the device and even when the switch is OFF
there is power in the device"

In the specific case of light bulbs, the ones you see in India are of
the bayonet cap variety which doesn't use the shell of the lamp base
as the neutral pole - it has two separate poles at the bottom and a
plane of symmetry too.

I imagine double-pole switches are ones that opens both the phase and
the neutral side when in OFF position, so yes, they do mitigate
whatever shock situations that may present themselves when the
polarity is reversed.

When you check out an US type power pin, which is followed in many other 
wester countries and Australia as well, the phase and neutral pins are 
not identical. The neutral pin is wider and easily identifiable. And 
also, you can not put it into the socket the other way. But, check the 
same with the Indian type, we have it identical round pins for both 
phase and neutral (and a bigger pin for Earth/ground). Thus, we never 
mind about which is phase and which is neutral and we most probably end 
up putting it in the wrong way. But, as this does not hinder the working 
of the instrument (provider it runs on single phase AC power supply), 
there is no issue. Even when we face a shock, we rather crib on the bad 
earth connections and wiring done by the electricians rather than 
getting into any detail of the actual cause, especially when the pins 
are in the other way into the socket.

The following statements that you have made has no connections with
cross-wiring. The reason for them are either insulation burst (in case
of geyser and stoves) or improper earthing.

<quote who="kg">

you will get a shock - also from other electrical appliances that are

Hey hey hey... hang on... the phase and neutral pins are identical all
over the world (at least, the civilized world).

I think you are confusing yourself with the phase/neutral pins and the
earth pin.

I shell command can be executed thru c in this way
  system("pwd");
   
  Now this displays the output eg /usr/bin in the terminal window
   
  Is there anyway in which this output can be stored in a variable in the C program itself.

No, C doesn't have the perl feature of $output = `somecommand`; You
need to use the popen() library function and parse through the output.

On the other hand, most simple commands can be easily emulated in C -
in this case, you have getcwd().

Wait a minute. Live and neutral pins are not identical all over the
world. Parthan was true about the US thing. Maybe US and Japan are not
civilized! The uncivilized list grows!

Hello All,

Greetings from the LINUX For You magazine team!

As you all know, we run a section called 'Opinions' in LFY where we pose 
a question to the community and industry and publish the responses 
(selected by our technical editors) in the magazine. Thanks to all those 
who responded to the last month's question. The best among the responses 
received have been published in the December 2006  issue of LFY.

The forthcoming issue of LFY would carry a story on the following:

Is the war really against Microsoft?

The article would focus on whether OSS world is actually fighting 
against proprietary software at an ideological level. Or is it that it 
remains a battle against Microsoft? We would like to focus at the 
various levels on which this antagonism between the open source 
evangelists and believers on proprietary software shapes up. Is the 
discontentment against Microsoft only to the extent of patent issues? Or 
that Microsoft is just a mere player, while the FOSS community is 
fighting at the much higher level of psychology...

We value your suggestions and comments. So, any idea you would like to 
share with us is most welcome.

Please write to us at sujata.banerjee@efyindia.com with a CC to 
atul@efyindia.com, before 10th November,2006.

The best responses would be published in the Jan 2007 issue of LFY.

Looking forward to your responses.

Thanks,

Sujata Banerjee, Editorial Coordinator, LFY

OK, it seems that a slight size difference between phase and neutral
is somewhat common in the US. I suppose that excludes them from the
civilized world ;)

On the other hand, here in the Europe plug points have two earth pins
just to facilitate insertion of the plug either way (the plugs and
points here are perfectly circular).

  Definitely not in the U.S. and Japan:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_AC_power_plugs_and_sockets#Type_A_.28North_American.2FJapanese_2-pin.29

The wider pin is neutral, and the 2-pin plug cannot be physically inserted
reversed in such a socket. This helps prevent shock hazards on 'hot chassis'
appliances, including TVs, microwaves, etc.

Note that the design is carried over into the 3-pin grounded socket as well,
to prevent 2-pin plugs from being inserted reversed.

(And yes, I am an EE, among other things).

I hated ubuntu for a long time just for this one reason. Luckily for
me I haven't had sysadmin disasters so far. learning more about sudo
just about gives me the confidence that this method ain't that bad
after all. In fact I had setup my self as sudo user even in other
centos/debian machines that I use/administrate!

This is not to reply anybody in particular, but apart from going way
OT, we have kinda lost focus on the first issue. We have discussed
quite a bit on Phase Neutral wiring that can cause shocks in
*alternating current* applications. But the original problem initiated
with phase-neutral wiring for a AC/DC converter.

After setting the password for root you can login as root in GUI also.

Ok, guys, there is a problem in ubuntu. And that is, the "shadow password"
is not enable there as default. So, what you need to do, is:

when the boot loader comes, select

"Ubuntu kernel---............."

press "e"

then select "kernel...."

press "e"

write "linux single" last line of "kernel.......>"

then, the login shell of root will come and change the "actual" password
from there...

And go for next process as other guys told....

Happy computing!

6 or 7 members attended this meet. The meet started around 5:45PM.

By mid of Dec, ELCOT is planning to ship nearly 3K PCs to all
panchayat offices in TN. PCs are shipped with only Suse Distro (as
against the initial Dual Boot decision). If anybody insist on M$, to
compensate the cost, the DVD Writer and 17"inch LCD will be removed
and Suse + M$ + 15" CRT will be provided.

ELCOT responsibility is train the official on the Linux Env. ELCOT is
looking for few personals(M/F) with good looking, voice and nice
teaching skills in Tamil Language to prepare the video lectures.
Anybody interested, Plz join in the next LUG meet.

The Training session will be done thru Video lectures and Volunteers
are needed to clear the doubts raised during that time. Nearly 100
volunteers are needed to support the training programs at different
locations in TN. (Plz fwd this message to other TN LUGs. So that ELCOT
can get more LOCAL Volunteers).

Another good news is, due to the ELCOT tender terms, many laptop and
PC manufactures and distributors are started dev the Linux Drivers (I
hope, they will release it in GPL). For example, Xerox came to tender
only after developing the CUPS PPT files (Someone took a copy of that
PPT file in USB Stick. Plz share in LUG).

Bye :)

Sometimes the electricians ARE at fault. Just as we users do not bother
about phase and neutral, some electricians dont do too! When in college I
watched my friend getting a nasty shock trying to clean a bulb holder with
the switch off.  As he was getting on the chair I asked him what if the
phase and neutral are wrongly wired....  he said "dont be silly... this is
an engineering college.... " :-)

Perhaps you have not considered that putting OpenBSD carp+pfsync at the perimeter can give you higher "availability" than any other method?

while configuring /etc/apache2/apache.conf and /etc/apache2/sites-avialble/default in ubuntu 6.06, to browse the php files,

the  document root is /var/www.

after starting the apache damen, in browser the index is coming but while i select a particular phpfile it is opening in gedit only.

so that i installed the libapache2-mod-php5 
it asks a dependency named libdb4.2  

but it says still   
 libapache2-mod-php5: Depends: libdb4.2 but it is not installable    Depends: libssl0.9.7 but it is not installable

could anybody tell me what to do for this ?

Heh. There you enter a major problem with most HA configurations. :)

At the network level, you can load balance via MX records, and for
POP/IMAP etc., you can have keepalived+rsync to provide for a hot
standby. But for the mail store itself, you will need to have some
sort of network filesystem (NFS or CIFS, let us say), but by doing
that you only transfer your single point of failure from the
mailserver to the fileserver. Redhat's GFS does try to provide highly
available file store, but it looks to me rather expensive and is a
bitch to build/maintain.

I'm sorry I couldn't understand by what you meant "not installable".
Did you install libapache2-mod-php5 or not?

Just I can't move one machine to *BSD. It will become a odd machine
out :). Anyway I wiil go thru the crap+pfsync docs to get new ideas.

Another possibility is live migration with xen.

I am told you can achieve live migration within 300 milliseconds(gasp).

I tend to think that high availability is best ensured by either OS level or layer 2 level stuff.

Higher layers make things more difficult, expensive, complex.

However you may not have a choice as you have to consider other factors.

But ceteris paribus I would go with the above two.

If you are using Ubuntu 6.06, how are you trying to install 
libapache2-mod-php5 ? You can try `apt-get install libapace2-mod-php5` 
which will take care of the dependencies or use synaptic for the same.

Try apt-get update and then apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5. I
guess there are some broken packages installed?

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0612060328n763e0e5as305ddd35ffaf6de9@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

Today, i added some NAS drives to a RH server.
In the server already there are more partitions.
They all are Primary partitions only (code 83)

Today, when i am adding the NAS device,
i tend to create it as a primary partition.
But when a windowz guy saw that, he told,

"Creating more primary partitions is an bad.
there should be only one primary partition.
then only the MBR will live safely
and the addition and deletion of partitions in the future
will be easy and safe.

Create extended partition and make logical partitions there.
this is very good".

Is it true?

Please explain me on What is primary, extended, logical partitions?
and the number of primary partitions can be created.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0612060347w4d8bc01ajc5c5adfa81f65db2@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

I got the debian etch testing 25 cds and converted them into 3 DVDs.

Installed debian etch testing using those DVDs.

and I wished to update all the multimedia stuff.
so added the debian-multimedia.org repository.

My /etc/apt/sources.list looks like this.

-------------------------------------------------

deb http://debian-multimedia.org testing main


deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux testing _Etch_ - Official Snapshot i386
Binary-1 (20061009)]/ etch contrib main

deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux testing _Etch_ - Official Snapshot i386
Binary-3 (20061009)]/ etch contrib main

---------------------------------------------------

My aim to to add all multimedia things into my system and create a
26th multimedia addon cd and to distribute the 3 DVD + 1 multimedia CD
to my friends
where the internet is still a dream.

I am so happy to see the debian which gives everything.

Now i get problem in adding the multimedia things.

if i give
#apt-get install mplayer

it gives the error as

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have

Since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that
the package is simply not installable and a bug report against
that package should be filed.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:

and stops.

I can not install mplayer.

This happens for all major multimedia applications.

Hey,

	I am no guru in this regard.

	But still I will throw in my mite.

	You can have upto 4 primary partitions on an x86 machine for a given hard disk.

	Out of this exactly one of them is active/bootable.

	I shall leave the good/bad/subjective stuff out.

	Hope this helps.

Best,
Girish

Sorry I lost your mail. Deleted mindlessly. :)

You need two OpenBSD machines for carp to work. It is the easiest high availability setup on earth.

Just proxy arp + carp magic.

Perhaps Raja can throw more light on this.

I am yet to try it out but people often criticize Ryan McBride for making things so simple that most sys admins don't feel a sense of accomplishment. :)

People like to solve hard problems right?

most probably the scenario is that the libraries in your dvd's are
outdated compared to the multimedia repository you have added.

probably a apt-get dist-upgrade should help

or ty manually downloading the dependencies mentioned from
packages.debian.org make sure you download only the  testing packages.

then dpkg -i packagename

things must work fine this way  on your comp

*Note : If you want to distribute the dvds , then the best thing to do
is , mount your dvd
and then download the latest dvd jigdo's from the website ,
and run jigdo-lite.

This way you will get the latest dvd iso's but you wil end up
downloading only the difference.

Hope it helps and about apt-get update i dont know why it shows so
many list , but it happens in my computer too and i guess its normal

Hi,

Your DVDs have old packages. The testing branch has been updated since 
9th October. If you want to use debian-multimedia.org, you have to have 
the main debian repository from an official Debian mirror.

If you look at the logs, apt-get is ignoring the paths for the GPG key, 
the release file and other information in the 3 DVDs. All the time it is 
searching in the 3 DVDs only. This is perfectly normal.

Debian now uses diff of the package index to update the local package 
information. For the first time it will download the whole index and 
from the next apt-get update, it will load the index as a series of diff 
files for each passing day.

mplayer is now in Debian main. I am not sure if it has propagated to 
testing yet. The version in main might also be missing support for some 
formats.

I would also suggest that you use 'etch' rather than 'testing' as the 
release name, as etch will released soon.

Regards,
Senthil

MPlayer is trivial to install from source.

But I know that is not what you are really looking for.

The advantage of source compiling mplayer is better performance and support for patent encumbered codecs.

Hi,

I personally prefer source code and other technical papers to learn about operating systems than books.

ps(1) output is very instructive in this regard.

Check out the two.

http://girish1729.googlepages.com/linuxps.pdf

http://girish1729.googlepages.com/obsd-ps.pdf

The linux entry is longer but...

Many people often ask me, "So why should I look beyond linux?"

What is the purpose of working with different OSes? Isn't everything just POSIX or some clone of UNIX?

If so then you can get a POSIX compliant environment on Windoze with Cygwin but do you like it? :)

Point to ponder.

Good nite.

Amazing. We shall take it forward. When is the next meet? Ubuntu Tamil

(Off course some should run through sessions for me in English/ Tamil of

Hi,

	Perhaps this is a long shot but who knows? :)

	Does anyone use computer drawing accessories?

	I am curious as I want to buy one.

	But remember, remember that I am a poor man after all. :)

	Get the cheapest and one that works reasonably well, thanks.

	Any advice without price tag is useless for me.

	Thanks in advance for all the help.

	Drivers for linux/UNIX? google throws up some results but
	
	I am sure it should be supported.

Hmm. I dont see a reasoning behind it. maybe it is easier for data
recovery if you lose your MBR. When using extended partitions., your
parition information (but for the entire extended partition) is stored
all over the drive as a linked list. However., does not seem like a
great advantage though :-S Maybe i'm wrong.

I never used a tablet before, so you might want to do a little more
research on the net. But I suppose you can get a Wacom Graphire4. I read
good things about it:

from what i can see on the net, things havent changed in the past 15  
years. If you are a professional in graphic arts, tablets make sense  
- and apparently wacom is oss friendly. Otherwise a mouse is good  
enough.

Well comparing a mouse to a drawing pad is like comparing a pen knife to a chainsaw to cut down a tree...

But still given my financial situation perhaps I shall agree. :)

I am not a professional and I want to become professional, so I want to buy one and I am sure I shall have good use for it.

No chicken and egg problem here I suppose.

Too bad nobody in ilugc can share anecdotes. 

But I certainly appreciate the help.

Kenneth, how much did you buy it for 15 years ago?

Many thanks Vamsee, just that they don't seem to have an office in Chennai. :)

Can't believe. I am sure there are plenty of graphic professionals in Chennai. Perhaps I should ask some of my friends offline.

Man, I just saw the price. Very very expensive.

I am the sort of guy who can buy a computer to suit my needs for this price.

Certainly a no go thing here.

Perhaps I should settle for second hand from eBay.

I have never done eBay shopping.

If it is too hard to obtain I shall have to wait till I get rich. :)

i was a dtp professional at one stage - and given the sophistication  
of software available, the tablet only helps those with genuine  
artistic talent - so if you have this, go ahead. I dont, so i went  
back to the mouse.

around 5K INR for a fairly basic model (I bought an A4 laser printer  
for around 70K at the same time for you to compare with ;-))

art work is vastly different from "DTP" :) )

I've been thinking of buying a wacom tablet since the time I got to

sorry, not a very useful reply. But yeah, I'm on the same boat as you!
Low budget. Big dreams.

The only reason i have heard , for having extended and logical
partitions is because there cant be more than 4 primary partitions.

Resizing and even deleting and adding partitions is more convenient
with just primary partitions.

When it comes to data recovery again , primary partitions are searched
as single partitions , but with logical partitions , the collection
under an extended partition is searched as a single partition.

Haven't read or heard anything more about partitons , it would be nice
someone else could add :)

And correct me if I am wrong , the MBR is always on the first
partition , regardless of whether you create primary or extended
partitons , its usage and method of accesing is always the same.

The reason for this is that the 512-byte first sector of the HDD (the
MBR) is divided as 448-byte boot loader code followed by a 64-byte
partition table. Since each partition table entry requires 16 bytes,
you are limited to 4 such entries.

MBR consists of IPL(Initial Program Load code) for 448 bytes and a 64 Byte partition table in that order in the first track of the hard disk. Every single OS partition on hard disk starts from the second track of the disk... usually.

If you want to back up or zero your MBR dd serves nicely.

#dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1
#dd if=/dev/hda of=/mbr  bs=512 count=1

So be careful with reinstalls on old hard disks. You are better off just wiping out the MBR with the above command.

Girish

If I issue sysctl -a command, I am getting more than

During installation Windows tries to occupy the entire disk. If you want
more than one partition it will create all the extra partitions as extended.
I think the intention is to make installation of another OS difficult and
can hopefully discourage the less adventurous.

Probably the OP's friend was brought up in a purely MS env and might be
thinking if it is the MS way it should be the right way :-)

Paremeter file? What does it do?

You can add any entries you want and invoke it with
sysctl.

These are read at run-time dynamically from the
kernel. The entries can also be viewed from /proc/sys.
/proc is not a physical filesystem. All data read is
from the kernel at run-time.

Hi All,

I have an extended partition of size 5G for installing latest linux's 
for testing. During installation usually i will format that partition.

1. Will the number of formatting a partition limit the life of the 
harddisk/partition?
2. Is it possible to install a new version without formatting (say 
simply deleting)?

siva.

To the know the list of Kernel Params, look into this file 
/usr/src/linux-XYZ/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt

To check the current params to the kernel, look into the
boot-loader config file (like menu.lst or lilo.conf).

I think you need to specify that the content type is text/html..ie

$mHeaders .= 'Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1' . "\r\n";

I think all Linux distros do the same, unless one specifies an
installation mode meant for advanced users or experts and choose to
manually partition the disk.

Hi,
  I have written a piece of C code and make it as a kernel module. Do I need 
to produce my code under the GPL license ?

When I need to  produce my code under GPL license and when  not required to 
produce under the GPL license ?

When I Googling for the above subject I got confusing statements like if it 
is logically derived from the linux then need to produce under GPL. If it's 
generic one like using standard unix call are not required.
  These  statements confusing me about the GPL license. Comments on the 
above subject is appriciated.

Thanks in Advance,
Lok

Apart from writing a program to automate http request, parse

you can suggest ? or any available program which might reduce
this effort ? (same with google groups ..)

And your Linux question was...?

The best way is to ask the recipients if anyone has stored the
messages. Between the habitual filter-and-forget subscribers, you are
certain to find the full archive. Web scraping might not work, mainly
due to the ad-infestation in Yahoo.

 Do you think they would give you access to query their database?
But you can hope to get that feature if Yahoo! won't find it coming across
their commercial and security policies. May be tell your need to Jeremy

This comment might help the OP:

"At least to list administrators, provide a full mbox archive

of tools such as Yahoo! Group Archiver, yahoo2mbox, and a couple of

I had similar issues with my Ubuntu system. Apparently it is because of the

Thanks for reply

I want to know the same, is the kernel parameter is
within the kernel or is it stored in a file and is
read while the system boots.

Is the /proc FS built from the kernel during booting.

Most of them are compile-time hardcoded defaults; but if you want to
change anything, you can reconfigure a running kernel via echo
something > /proc/sys/somewhere (which is what happens when you do a
sysctl -p, and is also part of your system init scripts).

There is no black and white set of rules on whether a Linux kernel 
module would fall under GPL license. If you distribute a non GPL 
compatible module linked to the Linux kernel, you would be violating the 
license however.

GPL is a reciprocal license that requires that a modification of a 
existing existing codebase or derivative work be under the same license. 
  The idea of a derivative work in copyright law does not clearly map to 
any particular programming concept like linking or system calls and has 
to be decided on a case by case basis.

The intend of the copyright holders is also important. Linus added a 
clarification to the license stipulating that merely using a system call 
wouldnt make a consumer of the call a GPL'ed application. This is not 
considered to be a exception.

http://lxr.linux.no/source/COPYING

Also many discussions on what constitutes derivative work is described 
in http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/lk/COPYING-modules.txt

FSF counsel Eben Moglen's view: http://lwn.net/Articles/147070/

Increasing several symbols being exported to the modules are being 
marked GPL only and cannot be used by non-GPL compatible modules. 
Modification of the original source would make it a deliberate violation.

http://lwn.net/Articles/104393/
http://lwn.net/Articles/205644/

Many kernel developers consider non-GPL compatible modules to be illegal.

As always, IANAL. If you want professional legal opinion consult a lawyer.

Message-ID: <a0c4f6270612081723l1651db28yf231a79c98733fc3@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ILUGC,

An acquaintance asked me this question; since I thought it would be
best to get advice from the list, I am posting the query here.

They have two application servers offering similar services. Both run
JBoss and Red Hat Linux. Now, in a short while, they need this service
to be available to about 1500 clients, many of whom may simultaneously
access the services. What they are looking for is a load balancing
solution, which will equate the load on both the servers. What would
the best way to achieve this? Would you suggest a new front end
machine for load balancing?

Sorry if the query is not clear enough, but this is what was posed to me.

Thanks.

Kumar

Look boss,

     I don't have practical experience but 1500 clients can easily be served by one machine without any load balancing whatsoever.

     Don't complicate things unnecessarily.

     Did you know that www.FreeBSD.org was just one PC for a long time? :)

     I know this answer is not glamorous enough for non technical people and your acquaintance may not feel "cool" but this is true.

Resilience is important when it comes to  commercial solutions.
FreeBSD.orgwouldn't lose much if 2 users per day go unserved, but it
may be that a
commercial organization loses some money, which is why they look for a load
balancing solution.

What they are looking for is a load balancing
solution, which will equate the load on both the servers. What would
the best way to achieve this?

Yes, it is part of kernel code.

No. It is in kernel memory. Any kernel module or
device driver may provide a /proc interface for users
to configure or read/write messages to it. 

http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/ch04.html#t2

Please note that this feature is for 2.4 Linux
kernels. 2.6 kernels primarily use sysfs.

The support needs to be present in the kernel. It is
usually mounted from user-space from an entry in
/etc/fstab during boot-up. 

  proc /proc proc defaults 0 0

Does this help?

http://docs.jboss.org/jbossas/jboss4guide/r4/html/cluster.chapt.html

And reading that gives me a headache, which is why I always hated JBoss
bloatware (they need to earn money, right? so complicate the
configuration enough to hire them) and used Tomcat most of the time. Any
particular reason they are using JBoss? If they are using EJB etc they
might not have much choice but to stick with JBoss. If not (basically
say a Struts application), then the can just migrate to Tomcat (any
decent j2ee programmer should be able to do this), and get Apache to
load balance the requests. Compare that to Tomcat 5's simplicity:

http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.0-doc/balancer-howto.html

Whether you want a separate machine to run the Apache instance (which
does the load balancing) or run it on one of the app server machines
depends on them. If they have a old box lying around, they can do use
this for Apache front-end. There are hardware load balancers too, but it
would be overkill for just 1500 users.

HTH,
V.

I dont think compiling mplayer would give you a performance boost , atleast
for x86 and athlon 64 , they compiled debian packages should give the same
performance as compiling it on your machine.

Support for patented codecs like win32 codecs  dont require you to compile
mplayer by yourself , you just have to download the codes and place them in
the appropriate directory

Sivaram formatting just removes the links to all your files , like in fat
teh fat tables are deleted , in ext3 the links etc , so it doesnt make a
difference , whether you delete all files or  format your partition :)

unless you are doing low-level format , your life doesnt get affected.

low-level frmat is when you clear every byte stored in your partition.

Message-ID: <7bf1bec50612091020w332ee39fo18a923e30af179c4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a weird problem. Used to run only Ubuntu 6.06 on my Vaio laptop.
Sometime last week the keypad started misbehaving. The left ctrl key started
behaving like the END key and the right ctrl like the DOWN arrow key! I
installed WinXP and in that too the problem remained. I assumed it was a h/w
problem. But now I observe that at times it starts working OK but its
erratic!!

Upon careful examination I found the when I press the right CTRL once it
generates the same keycode as the DOWN arrow key. When I keep it pressed it
generates the CTRL+DOWN keycode! The same withe the DOWN key too. If pressed
once it works as usual but when kept pressed it generates the same keycode
as  CTRL+DOWN. The left CTRL is consistent in generating the same keycode as
END whether pressed once or kept pressed. I swapped the capslock and left
ctrl keys. The capslock key works as a ctrl should but the left ctrl key
behaves like a capslock AS WELL AS generating the END keycode!!

WHat is happening here? Do I have to replace the keypad? Its not available
in India and in the US it costs 120$... so thats not really an option for
me. Anyone face similar problems? I hope my problem statement is not
confusing :-)

Thanks,
mano

Just noticed: after swapping the caplslock and the left ctrl keys, now the
END key also toggles the capslock - apart from doing its usual stuff. In
effect the left ctrl and the END keys are doing the same job. And the right
ctrl and the DOWN arrow keys are behaving like clones too.

your system is broken and i guess you have mixed repos .
Anyway

you have to first figure why those packages are not instalable

try


apt-get install libdb4.2
 and
apt-get install  libssl0.9.7

post your error messages , when you try those , and we can take it forward
from there

I have noticed this kind of strange behaviour in my laptop, but one
reason i see in common, it happens to me only when the laptop is
heated too much. You can feel the heat on the key-board, once i turn
it off for some time, it works normally. Might work in your case.

Seems to be a h/w issue only. When I tested with xev, each keystroke of the
ctrl keys generates 2 keypress and 2 keyrelease events - Ctrl_L & END for
the Ctrl_L and the END keys and Ctrl_R & Down for the Ctrl_R and the Down
keys. For now am making do with an external keyboard!

Try cleaning the laptop keyboard? Some dirt / hair etc stuck under the
keys could do this.  Or spilt coffee etc.

 @Ramanraj: Please provide the full link.

* Bharathi discussed rrdtool and its various options.

  http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/

* Baskar (LinuXpert Systems) was suggesting setting up
servers to hold various distributions in different

new free/open source curriculum to colleges. 

* Bharathi and Raman summarized the support required
by Uma Sankar, IAS (Elcot). He requires few volunteers
for the first training session and video shoot-out.
Lectures for demo sessions will be recorded and sent
to various panchayats for training. The second session
requires volunteers to help them during hands on
training at their respective panchayats.

Suggestions were given to use the training institutes
to help them or use college FOSS groups (students,
faculty) present near the panchayats.

* Kenneth emphasized the need for application
developers. He thanked ILUGC for their continued
support and contribution. NRC-FOSS are now moving
their work to Rajasthan and UP. He already sent a mail
regarding Theora+Icecast streaming requirement. There
will be the Indian FOSS Conclave 2007 that will focus
on FOSS and education. 

Please feel free to add to the above if I have missed
out anything.

Kenneth also suggested that this FOSS conclave can confine(i believe he
used better vocabulary) to certain areas like education.

So that after the conclave the work continues...

This was not discussed in the meet. Unicode Consortium allows anyone to
become member of it. May it be individual or organization. Various
grades are there.

I also believe some one referring to me that TN Govt is a member of it
and Indian Government is also a member of it.

Now what impact does it have if FSF or NRCFOSS or ILUGC could think of
becoming a member of Unicode?

Do they enjoy equal rights as the government enjoy.. (assuming Unicode
Consortium is neutral to both)

Sri Ramanraj stressed the need of presenting our feedback before this
month to the Govt of TN. He also referred that Tamil has been
allocated(!?) Hex values that fall in a plane which is actually a
private area.

Now if any of our Organizations become a member of Unicode Consortium
can this help in dealing these issues directly?

Please suggest..

Hello World,
I want to install Linux on a high end comp:

AMD Opteron (Dual Processor) 64 bit
32 GB RAM
Nvidia Quadro (name is somthing like this but is a powerful 3D card)


Here is what happened with various distros:
Fedora 32 bit: Did a full install and then on rebooting the OS
discovers its 64 bit and crashes. Stupid of me to try but I must have
been high.
Fedora 64 bit: The installer does not start. There is
black-screen-level error that says "This is not a software problem"
Ubuntu 64 bit: Same type of error.
RedHat: It worked goddamnit!

Now I want a something GNU, though...

are you sure its 32 gb ram ?
if so what kind of mother board is it ?
and where did you manage to find a board with so many slots ?


and fedora 32 bit  crashing becasue its 64 bit does not make sense.
It must have crashed for some other reason.

All 64 bit systems do work with 32 bit OS.
right now am sending this message from a athlon 64 bit runing on debian 32.

And is it dual procesor or dual core ?

If its dual processor  ....... debian has got  a proven record back.
If its dual core , it should work on any flavor.


And just for curiosity sake ,
Is this system for some kind of 3d modelling or rendering work ?

You can do a text install with dapper / edgy as well - no need of going
all the way back to hoary.

With that kind of RAM / processor etc - try edgy with Xgl, beryl or
something similar for a 3D desktop.

Shakthi, thanks for the nice write up.  The slides are at 
http://freeshell.in/~ramanraj/tml_unicode.pdf The presentation included 
a trivial fractions test, and to take that, open 
http://freeshell.in/~ramanraj/tml_unicode.odp with OO

Briefly, the purpose of the talk was to discuss TUNE RFC at 
http://www.tunerfc.tn.nic.in/tumain.htm

The proposed encoding in the range E200 - E3FF  in the Private Use Area 
is not suitable for open interchange.  The current Unicode standard has 
room for 10 lakh characters, and only about 1 lakh+ are filled up now.  
No much space is left on the BMP (Plane 0) and so we may seek allocation 
in plane 1 or 2 or even ask Unicode to allocate plane 3 exclusively for 
all indic languages. 

The Default Unicode Collation Element Table [DUCET] is at: 
http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/4.1.0/allkeys.txt

Tamil chars are not listed in their natural order in the DUCET, and 
hence a patch is proposed.
The initial version of the patch is at 
http://freeshell.in/~ramanraj/allkeys_patch.txt
After revising it as required, a proper patch file could be made.

Mimer at http://developer.mimer.com/index.htm has  the following pages:
http://developer.mimer.com/charts/UCA_tamil.htm [giving the present 
DUCET order of Tamil chars]
http://developer.mimer.com/charts/tamil.htm [giving the correct sort 
order, but does not include symbols]

A nice char picker is available at 
http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/pickers/tamil/

I'll await your comments, and circulate a draft response to the tune rfc 
to the list.

Another option to look at is Peercasting[1] using FreeCast[2] software.

If you don't want to be restricted to multimedia-broadcasting have a
look at DimDim[3].

                        I have extra working motherboard  with Celeron

But I think that I may use it with my current system ( (945 g

If you have any idea of this,pls help me.

I guess you will need a harddisk and some RAM - set up linux on it,
network this pseudo pc with your pc and set a cluster with 2 pcs :). I
dont know what you are going to do with the extra processing power
though.

That's no surprise. In fact, given your server config, I'd say you
must have spent close to 3-4 lakhs on the box? Spend a few grand more
and buy an RHEL AS subscription.

If monitor avail, then make it as diskless node. Otherwise, you can
use it as headless + diskless node with ssh for doing some testing/
download/ dirver dev etc ...

Let us know what your interests are. What is it that
you want to learn? 

You can set it up as a testing machine. Compile
whatever you want on your 1G RAM desktop, and test it
on the celeron machine.

I'd recommend Debian or Slackware on this box.

Have fun,

Its got a gig of ram .. way overkill for a diskless node.

Stick the rest of the parts in to make a usable box, then buy yourself a
kvm switch to share your keyboard, monitor and mouse between the two.

Dear All
Ya
 I Think it is good to make one headless system.

Basically I am a Bachelor in Electrical engineering.
In my final year project I used RTlinux| RTAI ,
For hard real-time data reading and fault tolerance| fault clearance 
In in EB substations. In our power grid   System they use some third party,
a old RTOS for this kind of applications. and so I created alternative
prototype using Linux.

		On that time I ran my control program in my fedora box. and
checked with heavy applications. that's working fine .

So now I think to run that program in a dedicated system(!!?motherboard).
I got this idea now only .i don't know it works or not.

So pleas give me some suggestion on making a headless system ,and how to
communicate to it thro ssh or something .....


I have one more idea, is it possible to run some process separately on
Celeron processor from my computer.

Awaiting innovative ideas.....

their commercial and security policies. May be tell your need to Jeremy




Very much possible if yahoo exposes this as a web-service...

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] What is success?
Message-ID: <20061212065723.GA20138@lakshmi.susmita.org>

I really don't think this article qualifies as my best.

But if you go by the feedback I get... I have never recd such feedback for any of my articles.

So I thought you might like it as well.

But this is off topic and way way way off topic...

But what the heck? I am sure this is applicable to all irrespective of age,caste,creed,religion,sex etc.

So I am sharing it.

Hope you like it. :)

Please excuse the personal touch. I originally wrote it for a completely different audience but later I started distributing without any modification.

In future I shall make it impersonal and formal. Please excuse me this one time. :)

As always comments are welcome.

love,
Girish

                   WHAT IS SUCCESS?

I felt inspired to write this. Perhaps this will interest you too.

For most of us success and happiness are synonyms.

For most men, their purpose in life is to be "successful."

This could be becoming a CEO, buying a car of their choice, getting a 
beautiful girl as wife :), traveling all over the world and so on and so forth.

Now, different people are different. Depending upon their innate
tendencies different people will want different things.

People normally tend to think that if they get what makes them happy,
they are successful. And usually they attribute success only to things that they
work hard to get.

More often than not people don't consider themselves successful on
achieving short term goals.

It has to be something big. And it has to take time.

I read somewhere this.

" Measure your success by what you have to lose in order to attain it."

I had this written in my white board in my Novell cubicle.

I was having a harrowing time in those days and I had that to comfort my
soul. :)
In a way this quote is correct. Nearly all great strides in life are
made by intense hard work, focus and immense sacrifice.

But it is wrong to measure the result based on this.

Because you cannot sustain for long if you keep score of how much you
are losing...

It has to be natural and you should do it without thinking.

For instance, my appa has a nature of sacrifice and keeping other's
happiness above his. So he will gladly sleep on the floor leaving the cot to
someone else.

For him it is spontaneous. He does not think of it as sacrifice. It is
his nature and he thinks of it as duty.

And sacrifice! What an ennobling ideal it is!

Indeed, that one word captures the very essence of all human existence.

This is the basis of all spirituality, all religions teach this more or
less indirectly; but Hinduism as usual is very explicit.

This is the basis of all achievements.

An Olympic runner sacrifices his sleep and comfort and practices years
on end. He sacrifices his petty joys for REAL joy.

Similarly scientists sacrifice sleep and the joy of not using their
brain by working harder and harder trying to squeeze the most out of their
brains.


And sacrifice is a close cousin of discipline.

What is discipline?

Discipline is doing the right thing.

Discipline is having rules in life.

Discipline is planning.

Discipline is careful execution.

It is so many things like having a routine, staying focused etc.

But the thing to note here is that it is simply impossible to be
disciplined in life without having an ideal of sacrifice deep within. Otherwise
there is no justification to be disciplined.

If you think "What do I gain my waking early?"

I live to enjoy the few hours of sleep in the early morning.

If this is your thinking , then alas I am wasting my time. :)

But that is ok. Different ppl have different priorities and different
joys they most definitely don't want to sacrifice in the name of working towards
success...

Anyway to quickly converge.

Many people get into overdrive and start doing things in a highly
energetic and zestful manner, sort of like Islamic fundamentalists.

But the problem with this is; it is not sustainable.

You run a marathon by starting slowly. If you think it is 100 metres
dash, it is counter productive.

You say, "grapes are sour." I cannot survive any longer and pant,pant
and go to sleep.

In Sansrkit there is a saying "Arambhe suraha"

Another thing is the conviction.

Invariably sacrifice needs conviction behind it.

If you ask appa, "why did you sacrifice?"

He will tell you, "Because that is the right thing to do."

You you have to decide upon what is the right thing to do for you.

And most of the time I have enjoyed the sacrifice and journey towards
success much more than success per se.

The journey lasts much longer. Once you get what you want, the feeling
does not last long. You start thinking about the next goal. Bane of men. If only
we were easily contented like women...

For all these things I find a simple lifestyle ideally suited.

It is impossible to work towards one's goals in the lap of luxury. This
is why we find that most successful men come from middle class families.

Money and comfort spoils everything.

How does America keep doing better and better and better?

Because the country has lot of energy.

Hard work and competition has so engulfed the race that they cannot stop
working.

Another thing is confidence and faith in oneself.

Whether you have faith in God or not I care not.

But have faith in yourself. Don't lose heart by a few failures.

Failures are good.

Failures correct our mistakes.

Failures teach us life.

But don't fall into the same ditch everytime!

Have a nice day!

Wish you Godspeed!

For all practical purposes it is the same. UTC is more accurate since
its based on the vibrations of the cesium atom; while GMT is purely
based on the rotation of the earth.

UTC is regularly adjusted to match with the GMT by the addition of "leap
seconds". The difference between UTC and GMT at any given time is too
small to be of any effect.

As I said before, UTC and GMT are the same. Setting your clock to UTC is
as good as setting it to GMT. Atleast in Gentoo, you don't have an
option between UTC and GMT; although you can set the hardware clock to
localtime instead.

.doc _may_ become an open specification in the future. Let's hope it does :)

Hi,

What version of PHP are you using ?. It works with
PHP4

PHP 4 with PECL extensions source can be found in the
ext/ directory within the PHP source or at the PECL
link http://pecl.php.net/.

In order to use these functions you must compile PHP
with Java support by using the --with-java[=DIR] where
DIR points to the base install directory of your JDK. 

This extension can only be built as a shared
extension. Additional build extensions can be found in
php-src/ext/java/README.

Babu.J

Success: I did not find it, I Created it.

Do you mean OpenXML (.docx etc)? As far as I can see older formats are unlikely
to be opened up.

Yes I mean .docx. The older .doc files are binary anyway; so there can't
be a "specification".

Binary formats and protocols can very well have specifications. Plain 
text formats are not by themselves any more open.

Did you mount the partition fine? ls -l /mnt/sysimage shows what?
Maybe your root partition is bust.

See - wtf is that? Try an fsck (without -y), and if that doesn't help,

And., since you say that your kernel is rebooting randomly without a
kernel panic or something., maybe even your /boot filesystem is corrupt.
 Time to take backup of your data.

Its not about proving a point. It is about saying NO to proprietary
closed file-formats. Its about acknowledging standard file-formats and
showing support to it.

Pillayar (Pillayar(Ganesha) is the first/prime God of Indian Tradition)
Suzhi used particularly by Tamil People, tradition after tradition since
time unknown "?" might have been used to represent zero in Tamil.

This kind of beginning "?" is unique to Tamil and people of other Languages
in India use various other ways for beginning a task. ? repsents 2 in Tamil.


Just giving my ideas. Scholars need to confirm. Though century old printed
books use '0' to represent 'zero' in Tamil.

When tamil had ways to handle fractions whose values are less than zero, it
is hard to believe that we didnot have a way to handle zero.

Also every first (beginning) page of a book (atleast till last last
generation) published/ written will have ? on top of it.

We have a name ???????? whose value is given as 1/18,36,400

This has risen an interesting question.. Had Bharathians been aware of
negative integers? anyone aware? any references? OT?

be that as it may, old tamil *numerals* were something more like  
roman - there is no symbol for zero. There are separate symbols for  
10, 100, 1000 etc. For example 6754 would be written as:
6 thousand 7 hundred 5 ten 4 and not 6754.

:-)

Brahmi inscriptions dating back to 300 B.C has zero represented as
something like "?" (remove the dot under the question mark)

then, Gwalior inscriptions dating back to 870 A.D has the current zero
like "0" symbol.(similar to current Devanagari)

Devanagari inscriptions dating back to 1100 A.D has "0" and other
numerals in it resembles the current Hindi Numerals.

Alka Varijmi, the mathematician of the Arab country, used Hindu Numerals
the method of evaluation of placement of numerals and some mathematical
equations in his first book (780-850 A.D). Then all these matter spread
all over the world.

[0] Suzhi - ???? is a root word, that is as old as Tamil - it literally 
translates to the shape 0, means 0, and is also associated with words to 
mean circular or spiral motion. Several words and meanings associated 
with it are listed at: 
http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?table=tamil-lex&page=1546&display=utf8 


The Tamil notation is convenient for doing mental arithmetic in an 
abacus like fashion. The first three symbols below and those for the 
integers 1 to 9 could be used to prefix or suffix any of the following 
values.

? =10^1 = ?????
? =10^2 = ????
? =10^3 = ??????
?? =10^4 = ??????????
?? =10^5 = ????????? (??????) ??????
??? =10^6 = ?????????????? (??????) ????? ??????
??? =10^7 = ????

This notation avoids repeating zeroes that are often difficult to key in 
or write.

Exactly. The Saiva Sithantha Noor Pathippu Kazagam (TTK Road Alwarpet,
Chennai), has been publishing an Agarathi. In it,

??? ????????? ??????????? 
????? ???????????, "????? 
????? ??????" ????, (?????? 
479) 

??????? - ?????????, 
??????, ????, ?????????? 

?? ?????? ???? ??????????.

???????, ??????, ?????????, 
????, ???????, ?????????? 
???? ??????????? 
????????. 

"?" ?? ??????????? 
????????????? ???? 
???????????. ????????? 
???? ??? ??????. 

We call Neer Suzhi - Water Spiral(?) That which spread on putting a
stone into a pond.... Then we also call the spiral structure at our head
as Suzhi. Rendu Suzhi kkaran - Ivanukku Rendu Pontatti is humorous
representation even used till date...

Who says Ayan Rand is not about sacrifice ?

Ayn Rand's Objectivism [1] philosophy is about the sacrifice of the
unworthy for the benefit of that which one considers valuable. :P

Well. I don't remember understanding objectivitism to ennoble
sacrifice of one' ways for benefit of the rest.

It is about sacrifice of some whims to achieve what you stand for,
ennobling self. Something most of us will classify as selfishness.

First, as far as I know Ubuntu installation is easy to be handled by 
someone with a mere exposure to computers. So, am a bit amazed seeing 
some one asking for people to install Ubuntu. Sorry, if am sounding a 
bit sarcastic but am not :)

Second, if you are looking for some one in Mumbai then better mail the 
ILUG-BOM mailing list to get a better response. This might help

 ya thats the culprit. i was not able to chroot into /mnt/sysimage with rescue Cd of fedora 6 as /mnt/sysimage/bin is corrupted. actually i tried to chroot with original RHEL4 rescue media too but the program quit after network setup and rebooted .  so i had to again use fedora 6 rescue CD to mount the system as /mnt/sysimage. it was looking for /mnt/sysimage/bin/sh, which it couldnt find (corrupted). so the error was:
 chroot: cannot run command '/bin/sh' :  Not a directory

luckily i had  a system with similar installation layout.
so i moved the corrupted bin, created a new /mnt/susimage/bin  dir and copied /bin contents from the other machine into the /mnt/sysimage/bin via network. reboot landed me into fsck which checked for / partition and errors were fixed. fsck removed the stale corrupted bin file. and thats it  reboot! viola! the server is back in form with all data intact.

But  it spews a mesg now and then to the console saying:
'Machine check event logged'
Is that soemthing to be worried abt ? 

thanks for all ur inputs.

I have an external harddisk (80GB 2.5" usb 2.0 compliant) to be used by usb interface.
Do i need to create separate block devices to be able to mount it under linux ? 
I use RHEL 4.0 x86_64 (2.6.17 kernel) with usb2.0 compliant ports.
do i need to plug it in usb and boot linux or it works as hotplug device?

Hi all,
I have been trying to setup a canon pixma 1200 on a ubuntu system and
I came upon this article. Very interesting read.
http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=12207
Wouldnt it be possible to have a generic wrapper for windows printer
drivers just like we have ndiswrapper for wireless card drivers?
Technically I think it would be. But why isnt one out there already.
Somebody must have thought of this before. What about wrappers for
other device drivers. Is there something that I am missing here?
Shouldnt these drivers have some generic and documented interface that
they expose to applications. Or is it that the interface is only open
to the windows operating system and documented only for microsoft?

Yup. Closed source.

"Some vendors do not release specifications of the
hardware or provide a Linux driver for their wireless
network cards. This project implements Windows kernel
API and NDIS (Network Driver Interface Specification)
API within Linux kernel. A Windows driver for wireless
network card is then linked to this implementation so
that the driver runs natively".

There are many of specific commands that you can use
with google. The best resource to learn it is from
"Google Hacks" O'Reilly Publications"

The link below will help you get a glimpse of the
same.
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/googlehks/chapter/index.html

And here's a small list. Enter them in the textbox
1) define:<define_this_word>

2) filetype:<file_type> <search_words>

3) inurl:begin_quote<word_expected_in_url>end_quote

4) intitle: same as inurl, except, the word should
appear in title

5) site:<website_name_usually_without_www_and_http>
<search_this_word_within_the_website>
e.g.
site:www.somaiya.edu S K Somaiya

Happy Hacking and reading! ;)

The ancients were using sun dried palm leaves and such material as 
medium, and writing the ? on the top was a simple media check.  If the 
scribe could not get a perfect ?, he would simply reach for a new leaf. 
When printing evolved, it could have been safely dropped, but since a 
prayer also came to be associated with it, it has been carried forward, 
and now part of the Unicode Standard too.  Implementing it on modern 
computers in a meaningful way would mean suitable checks on hardware and 
software to avoid data loss - reasonably good on most modern free 
software operating systems, but there is certainly room for 
improvement.  Further data could be mirrored across the world, and it is 
not possible for the following history to repeat itself:

"There can be no doubt that an infinite number of works in the different 
departments of science and literature was composed during this brilliant 
age; but in the early part of the fourteenth century, when the .. hordes 
poured into Southern India, and Parakrama-Pandian was led away captive 
to Delhi, the Tamils had to deplore the loss of almost all their 
literature; for those ruthless fanatics, amongst other outrages, 
ransacked all the libraries in the country, and committed to the flames 
'all that genius had reared for ages'" [cited from Tamil Wisdom, Edward 
Jewitt Robinson, 1872]

http://www.tamil.net/projectmadurai/akaram_uni.html lists the works 
remaining today.

I used to be curious about Pillayar (?????? + ???? ) and finally received 
enlightenment from Balakumaran's ?????? ????? ;)  I still cannot believe 
that if we ask *HIM* he actually sends the reply :)

Specifications usually don't give explicit details on
implementation. That is left to the developers. They
usually specify a common protocol to be followed.

But be sure you unmount your filesystems before you unplug the USB
hard-disk from your comp.

I remember you mentioning that the kernel was rebooting (not panicking)
immediately after it was loaded by GRUB (I assume before running init
scripts from your hard-drive). Which means., the filesystem corruption
may not be just at the /bin volume., it might have gone to the /boot
volume too.

No you dont need to have separate block device drivers for the usb
harddisk.The harddisk will use the SCSI driver which can be invoked either
at boot time and no need to mention after installation(this is the
cooooolest part of the kernel :) ).

What you see is what you get. You've tried to download an html file, and
that is what you will get. This is what you really want to do:

wget http://www.linuxwallpapers.org/linux/22472-img_5044.jpg

(I got the URL of the image from that HTML page).

Friends.

My friend encrypted a usb pen drive (ScanDisk) using windows and gave me..
he told the password to me.
That drive has got some inbuilt software for encryption.

All normal usb drives are automatically mounted in my debian box.

My usb device is /dev/sda1.

But, this pen drive can not be accecible.
Can not mount this manually too.

How to mount an encrypted usb pen drive?

Subject: [Ilugc] FYI: Free Ryzom campaign
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0612141605510.16030-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

Boston, December 13th 2006 - Free Software Foundation (www.fsf.org)  
announces that it will officially support the Free Ryzom campaign
(www.ryzom.org) with a pledge of $60,000.

The Free Ryzom campaign was established to purchase the online game
and universe known as Ryzom, property of the now bankrupt Nevrax
company, and release the entire game as free software.

As stated by Peter T. Brown, Executive Director of the Free Software
Foundation, the FSF considers the Free Ryzom campaign "a high priority
project for the free software movement". The aim of the campaign is to
publish the source code to the entire game under the terms of the
widely-used GPL, as well as publishing all of the artwork and other
content under similar free licenses.

The Free Ryzom campaign represents a unique opportunity for the free
software movement and the emerging free gaming field. A fully free
MMORPG (massively multiplayer online roleplaying game) engine and
client/server architecture would allow the development of a myriad of
universes, each one evolving its own philosophy and unique content -
but sharing in general technical improvements. If successful, this
campaign would allow any user to create their own universe and produce
their own content based on the Ryzom/Nevrax architecture.

Since the announcement by Nevrax of their bankruptcy, the Free Ryzom
campaign has drawn together a heterogeneous community of volunteers
formed by ex-employees, current players and free software
sympathizers. With the support of the FSF, it is now expected that the
campaign will be able to increase its bid to over 200.000?.

The campaign is also seeking to create a non-profit organization to
run and maintain the current game servers. Monthly fees would be spent
on service costs and game development. Pledges can be submitted at the
Free Ryzom campaign website (www.ryzom.org). Pledges must be made
within the next few days, since the deadline for the final bid is
expected sometime before Wednesday, December 19th, depending on when
the judges make their decision.

About The Free Ryzom Campaign

The Free Ryzom Campaign is a community-based initiative formed to
purchase the MMORPG game Ryzom from the now-bankrupt Nevrax. Players,
former Nevrax employees, and free software sympathizers have partnered
with Olivier Lejade (former CEO of Nevrax, now CEO of Mekensleep) and
Valentin Lacambre (a well known personality related to the alternative
Internet movement in France) to purchase the game and release the
source code under the terms of the GNU GPL, and the content and
artwork under similar free licenses. For more information on their
campaign, or to make a donation pledge, please visit www.ryzom.org

Oops! I think I have some bad news here. It is not possible.

The good news however is that I may be wrong as I have no clue what Windoze encryption scheme is being employed here. :)

Perhaps my ignorance may give you hope.

Or googling.

Is it some sort of encrypted file system?

how were the windows kernel api's implemented in linux for
ndiswrapper? shouldnt this imply that there must have been some
documentation of the kernel interface for the NDIS. Just like that
shouldnt there be some standard interface for printers, scanners etc

wouldnt the specifications give details about the functionality
provided by the interface plus the set of functions and their
parameters?

Some vendors don't wish to provide APIs or Linux

Nope, this is left to the developers. RFC 791 [1], for
example, explains the IP protocol. It is left to the
developers to implement it using any tool.

well somehow  it doesnot work as a hot plug device.
do i need to invoke usb as an argument to hotplug   command ?
have tried: 
mount -t usbfs /dev/usbdev2.1 /mnt/usb

It shows some weird dirs and a file in     /mnt/usb after mounting as above.

 I have seen that happen to me too sometimes. I think it means that the
device you are trying to mount isnt right. I then tried a different device (
in my case /dev/hdb2 or something instead of /dev/hdb) and with trial and
error, I got the actual stuff. On a related note, can someone explain how
the device "number" is allotted? like when i plug in a usb, mostly its on
the same device but sometimes varies and I need to do trial and error to get
it right.

Thanks!

After you plug in the device, post output of:

  /bin/dmesg | tail
  /usr/bin/lsusb
  /sbin/lsmod

> have tried:

usbfs represents the USB filesystem, not your hardware
device file.

It is not some weird dirs. It is the usbfs details.

Yes. Always understand what you are doing. If you are
in doubt simply ask.

USB subsystem in Linux kernel uses SCSI emulation. So,
it will be /dev/sdXY, where X=a,b,c... and Y=1,2,3 ...

This will be displayed in the dmesg output. All this
manual mount is only with 2.4 Linux kernels without
hotplug. You can still use hotplug with 2.4. 2.6 uses
udev completely, kernel and user-level.

Google also does.

In the end they have accepted the fact that IE has more than 85% of the 
market share ;)

As far as I know opera has always identified itself as opera. There are
multiple menu options, drop down bars etc to change the user agent, or
to assign a specific user agent for a particular website ..

That is bad then. I thought most Windoze users have cut over to firefox. I at least thought that much from my rare visits to browsing centers.

Nopes.  The older Opera versions by default identifies itself as IE (at

versions usage ;)

That is the statistics for that web site.  How can you derive the market 
share from this?  Since, w3schools is actually a tech web site, I'm 
surprised even with 49% of IE6 users, I was expecting Firefox to be 
higher ;)

Do you want the numbers for my web site?

Unknown			55.1 % (I believe RSS readers)
Firefox 		30.6 %
MS Internet Explorer	8 %
Mozilla			1.8 %

Subscribers will not be charged for *migrating* to the high-speed
broadband access nor will they have to change their consumer premise
equipment.
</quote>

It says for migrating. I would think that would mean change of plans not
usage.

You don't have scsi_mod and sd_mod modules loaded.
These handle the SCSI part.

ya Linux  / partition is on SCSI disk so compling scsi_mod and sd_mod as kernel inbuilt .
how can i check if the inbuilt module is present and loaded ? 
also have noticed that the kernel build path : /home/km/build/mykernel/kernel/drivers/scsi has scsi_mod.o and sd_mod.o files.

i use:

make O=/home/km/build/mykernel menuconfig
make O=/home/km/build/mykernel 
make O=/home/km/build/mykernel modules_install install

am i missing something in compilation process ?

Build them as modules.

This should move the modules to
/lib/modules/<kernel-version>.

nope, that doesnt work - it ends in a kernel panic. i could see the modules 
scsi_mod.ko and sd_mod.ko in /lib/modules/<kernelversion>/kernel/scsi  along with other scsi hostcontroller modules.

It is mentioned particularly in the 2.6.18.3 menuconfig help that if one has / partition on SCSI disk then sd_mod and scsi_mod needs to be compiled inbuilt.

Then I thought, i would update the ramdisk so - 
after panic i booted to a working kernel to make initramdisk with sd_mod and scsi_mod  and ata_piixand it found    the dependent drivers  and loaded it. but still i didnt help.
the same kernel panic :
mkrootdev: label /1 not found
mount error 2
mounting ext3 upto 280000000 @ 8000 - 13000
mount: error 2 mounting none
switch root mount failed: 22
umount /initrd/dev/ failed :2


so i am compiling scsi_mod and sd_mod inbuilt

	Searching Numeric value between a range in acts_as_ferret's

Message-ID: <ed2d3c000612150803y37be9ebam56535c58482fdf51@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends,

Warm greetings, I am writing this mail to you for finding an answer on ferret.
In Rails, i am having a task to solve, let me explain my one.

I have a model called candidate and one of the data entity is experience:
In my search View i am having many fields , two of the fields are
exp_from and exp_to fields. When the  search view is filed with data
and pressed submit the values are taken to the corresponding search
controllers method. i receive them with params() function. Now i am
feeding the values to the acts_as_ferret  modelname.find_by_contents
method like

def mymethod
..
exp_from = params[:exp_from]
exp_to = params[:exp_to]
...
 query = "+experience:( >= " << exp_from << " AND <= " << exp_to << ") "
 @candidates=Candidate.find_by_contents(query)
...
...
end

Now ferret is not making a numeric search, instead it makes a string search.
If i intend to find the search query which ask from a range of
experience from 1 to 13 it matches the records for those records
matches the experience as 1 , 10,11,12 and 13. How can i implement a
numeric search in Ferret Query Language which finds records within the
numeric range of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13?

Any ideas , and suggestion is much appreciated.

Thanking you,

Sincerely
Thyagarajan Shanmugham

It's been a while since I worked with Ferret, does changing the query to
this help? :

query = "+experience:( >= " << exp_from.to_i << " AND <= " <<
exp_to.to_i << ") "

Hi all,

now  after recompiling the kernel with scsi_mod and sd_mod, the lsusb works fine and gives the following output :

Bus 005 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  

since i have statically compiled sd_mod and scsi_mod, is there anyother way to get around this problem of modprobing sd_mod ? i understand that invoking sd_mod creates on the fly device files for accessing the external harddisk device as sg did.

or is it that i need to register usb to hotplug ?

regards,
KM

Which is the working kernel? For which kernel did you
create the ramdisk and how? Please furnish full
details, always.

Are you sure it is only for 2.6.18.3? It is applicable
for every 2.6 Linux kernel.

2.6.11:
http://lxr.linux.no/source/drivers/scsi/Kconfig?v=2.6.11

2.6.17.3:
http://lxr.linux.no/source/drivers/scsi/Kconfig

You are not using SCSI hard-disks. Yours is an
external USB hard-disk which follows SCSI emulation in
Linux.

> I use RHEL 4.0 x86_64 (2.6.17 kernel)

One of my kernels on Ubuntu is 2.6.17, and it
automounts USB devices on the fly. Yes, I have
scsi_mod.o and sd_mod.o as modular.

i was using 2.6.17.14 (working ) kernel while compiling 2.6.18.3.
the following command was used to preload initramdisk:

# mkinitrd -v -f initrd-2.6.18.3.img --preload=scsi_mod --preload=sd_mod --with=ata_piix  initrd-2.6.18.3.img 2.6.18.3 <enter>

not so sure abt it. will check out.

I think there is some confusion here. The OS disk (internal 73GB) is a SCSI disk on which i have / parition. I have a separate external 2.5" USB harddisk (80GB) which needs SCSI emulation in the OS.

hmm . will check out once again then compiling them modular.

I have not used ferret till now but here's my 2 cents:

Converting a string to an integer and appending it to a string is going to
make it a string again!

Is the experience field in your ferret application indexed as a string or an
integer object? I think you'll have to tell ferret indexer that the field is
an integer object at the time of indexing itself. Only then can it use the
comparison operators on them in an integer context.

It might be useful if you post this to the chennai.rb list at googlegroups.

Hey Thyagu,

I have lost touch with Ferret but still I think you can do one of 2 things:

1) Try and use a range query.
2) Whilst sending the experience field to the indexer use a padded 
string - like in your case for example use '01', '02', and so on to 
'99'. This will make the query work since its doing an ascii search. 
Take care, you will also have to pad your search term.

I think one of the above should work. Let us know.

Regards,

Deepak

This is not a kernel panic. This is failure message
when trying to mount your partition.

this typically happens when trying to migrate from one disk to another. check
all your partition labels and /etc/fstab to make sure the mount points are right
- you may need to boot a live cd in order to check this. the specific problem in
this case seems to be / partition. if there was an existing partition with / as
the e2label, and an attempt was made to create another partition with the same /
as the label, the new one would be labelled as /1 instead. unfortunately, many
of the gui based tools dont alert us to this situation at all.

Well, the website clearly states that the only supported Linux
distribution is Redhat Enterprise  Linux 3, so he deserves all he got
for trying to do a layman's installation on Debian.

And I do not agree that installing software on Windows is hassle-free
(well, maybe the installation itself might be, but there are definite
problems arising out of trying to provide such an installation).
Applications expect libraries like compat-libstdc or openssl or
whatever to be pre-installed on Linux, whereas they all ship with
their own versions of these libraries on Windows (often incompatible
with each other). I have hit this problem with DirectX and OpenSSL.

Hi all,

ok, after compiling dynamically linking (modular) scsi_mod and sd_mod by :
mkinitrd -v -f --preload=scsi_mod --preload=sd_mod initrd-2.6.18.3.img 2.6.18.3 <enter>
and thus ramdisk is updating randisk for 2.6.18.3 kernel.

Now booting via the working kernel (2.6.17.14), the root paritition from /etc/fstab shows:
label=/1     /     ext3  defaults  1 1

also / parition is mounted by the device file /dev/sda6
and grub entry for custom kernel is:

title RHEL 4.0 ES (2.6.18.3)
root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.18.3 ro root=LABEL=/1 rhgb quiet
initrd /initrd-2.6.18.3

Now when i edit the kernel line in grub entry for custom kernel in the following ways i got these mesgs:

with kernel argument root=/dev/sda6:

mount: error 6 mounting ext3
mount : error2 mounting none upto 200000000 @ 8000 - 11000
switchroot: mount failed : 22
umount /initrd/dev/ failed: 22
umount /initrd/dev failed :2 
Kernel panic - not syncing : Attempted to kill init!

with kernel argument root=/1  

mkrootdev: label /1 not found
mount : error 2 mounting ext3 upto 200000000 # 8000 - 11000
mount : error 2 mounting none
switchroot: mount failed : 22
umount  /initrd/dev  failed : 2
kernel panic- not syncing : Attempted to kill init!

with kernel argument  root=/
mount: error 15 mounting ext3
mount: error 2 mounting none upto 200000000 @ 8000 - 11000
switchroot: mount failed : 22
umount : /initrd/dev failed : 2
kernel panic - not syncing : Attempted to kill init!

Is it that the initramdisk is not able to mount ext3 partition ? should it also be preloaded into the ramdisk ? 

regards,
KM

I would add this: at least, in GNU/Linux, the error messages are
indicative of the trouble; in Windows, I am never able to figure out
what the error messages mean!

But then, Googling might help, but somehow I never seem to do it; it's
been ages since I've used Windows.

Hi all!

I recently installed FC5 and FC6 on a newly acquired
AMD 2800+ Sempron processor(64-bit). There are a few
things i would like to get cleared

1. While the packages were being copied, I noticed the
i386 extension packages being copied. Isnt i386
supposed to mean intel 80386?

2. The FC5 and FC6 that i installed on my 64-bit AMD
was also installed on my 32-bit celeron. That means i
am using 32bit OS on my 64-bit machine right? Will i
gain performance by using FC5 for 64-bit?

Speaking of which, the other day one of my friends who uses Windows saw
the verbose errors when I did something to my computer and mocked
"Wow..The only error I get in Windows is that Illegal Operation thing"
I couldnt help grinning when he said that :P

You need to use the 64-bit installation media for 64-bit machines.

It just means it is i386 compatible. Fedora will take advantage of more 
  modern instructions sets when available and being compatible with the 
base set is important for processors like VIA.  Fedora is a multi-arch 
distribution. For compatibility both the x86 and x86_64 libs are 
installed in parallel in some cases even on the 64-bit variant.

Yes.

  Will i

For processor intensive applications, yes. If you are using a desktop, 
dont bother.

how much ever we like to bash windows, this issue is more of software
specific rather than depending on the os... the developer is more
likely to blame for such issues... further, in many cases, linux
software is guilty of giving overly technical error messages. for
geeks like you and me, this may not be problem; but for the lay
person, it is often overwhelming.. he/she needs to google then as well
:) design of error messages and ui is a separate, and sadly often
neglected, a separate subject by itself :)

it moves on...

Message-ID: <71ea7b280612170529o47e37b29n3b6364da6a89571f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
      I am volunteering to help a NGO, improve their php-based website in
two aspects.

      1. Making the existing web pages available in Tamil too.
      2. Introduction of Discussion Forums.

First Aspect - I did look in to the CDAC released Tamil Open Software CD.
Also I saw ELCOT's help document from bharathi's website. AU-KBC website was
also useful. But then, with many resources at hand, I am not clear how to go
about it.

     For the first aspect, I feel there are following steps
     1. Translating the existing content to Tamil - Is there any free tools
that can translate sentences/paragraphs from english to tamil. Is manual
translation the only option

     2. Typing the tamil content using an editor, with appropriate Tamil
Fonts. (Is there any standard Tamil fonts available). I find no
standard/pattern fonts used, just like we normally use Times New Roman and
Arial in English. I guess we can always ask them to download fonts from the
webpage, but then ...

      Also, is there any tools available which can make it easier to type
out the tamil content, even if we are not conversant with Tamil keyboard
layout. like 'k letter in English' representing 'ka' in tamil.

 Second Aspect - Also are there any php based free discussion forum
softwares available, so that they can be customized with very little effort.

 YaBB seems to be one such system written in Perl. phpBB seems to be another
popular one. Is there any other which I should have a look at..

Eashwar N.

KBabel is the commonly used tool with built in dictionary facilities. The
advantage over here is that once your load the pre-translated .po files to
the dictionary and then u take a new file for translation, u can do a fuzzy
translation which will substitute existing Tamil words from dictionary. You
can chose to confirm it. For un - available words we can do the translation
and add them to dictionary again.

Well if we use Unicode, there isn't need for downloading fonts and its
enough if the browser supports UTF-8 encoding. Try Ubuntu.

SCIM input method comes with Phonetic keyboard layout.  The wiki page
addressed above has details of packages  that need to be installed for this
purpose.

Hi,


While channel-surfing on TV today, I was surprised to see
Mr.Thyagarajan Shanmugham (Thyagu rajan on ILUGC) do an introduction
to Ruby on Rails for the IT.com programme on Sun News (Sunday 5:30 PM).

OMG, what a change it was from the other (so called) IT programmes
on TV that are just product demos for Microsoft office. Seriously,
I never seen an IT programme on TV that goes beyond the dumb-down
adding-values-in-an-excel-sheet-column routine.

Today, he gave a very good (though very basic) introduction to
Ruby on Rails. I wish he would expand on this and do a much detailed
intro to RoR in the next show. (Thyagurajan if you are reading this..
How about doing an intro on Django too?)

A mass-media like television will surely give a greater exposure to
FOSS technologies and I congratulate him for his efforts.

If you have the budget, try vbulletin - its linux/apache/mysql/php but

It's not free as in freedom either. You get to look at the source code

The keyboard has cured itself of its ailment :-)

Perhaps it was some liquid drops shorting the leads and having evaporated a
few days later things have become alright!

So, next time any of you encounter such strange keyboard behaviour dont go
running to replace the keyboard. But for the unavailabilty (and the hefty
price tag) of the keyboard in India I would've replaced it too! I should
thank the infamous Sony customer service for this :-)

Perhaps ilugc can organize to make demo videos of different OS technologies,
applications etc and have it broadcasted in Sun TV and DD. Thyagu has the
requisite contacts inside both these organizations to arrange for this.

2D qcad. 3D no free software, but NIC has collabcad which you have to  
pay for, not very costly, but good. (It is not open source)

There seems to be something called BRLCAD.

And plenty of CAD tools for electronic design but I know it is quite different from Mechanical stuff.

But there might be something in common, who knows?

Is there a ProE alternative? I dunno perhaps there is.

But be warned there is none in the calibre of AutoCAD. I do not know about
the Pro E option. I think there is a version of that for linux... but it

Today, he gave a very good (though very basic) introduction to
Ruby on Rails. I wish he would expand on this and do a much detailed
intro to RoR in the next show. (Thyagurajan if you are reading this..
How about doing an intro on Django too?)


Thanks Mr.Kumara Guru,  I would love to do more of this stuff. As mano
says we can make videos on various Foss related topic like  tutorial ,
installation guide. Will have check with Mr. Uma Shankar IAS MD  of

A prior information about the programme, to list would have helped us

you have to enable clone or copy channel .... something like that .. dont

The easy installation in windows has little to do with the gui , it has got
more to do with versioning. Generally windows versions or major patches are
introduced once a year ?? In linux it happens every day ! So consider a
software dependent on library x(provided by os). For all windows applicaion
, library x is the same version , and fewer conflicts exist. But  thats not
the case with linux , when library  updates today , one application needs
the old library and the other the new library. that makes maintainence more
difficult than in windows. So its the responsibility of the user here to
avoid conflicts , and for most applications , sticking with a distro and
thier packages solves the issue.But when a package has to be compiled and
the libraries used are different in version or the dependent libraries of
these libraries are different in version and conflict with newer or older
ones , thats when the issue arises.

But i think thats a price all of us are ready to pay given the rapid
develpment cycle :)

You know what. This sounds as if you have no clue about Linux or Windows.

1. Can you list ONE library in Linux which has a release every day?
I'll accept if you can find one with a release scheduled every week,
even.
2. Redhat et al goes to extreme pains for binary compatibility. The
only cases where they sacrifice a bit of compatibility is when an
application had to be changed by name (I see two instances in RHEL3,
ethereal->wireshark and mozilla->seamonkey).
3. The reason for software depending on library X in Windows not
conflicting with each other is entirely different - each application
ships with the libraries that they require; and this opens up an
entire can of worms. I have seen gamers choosing to reinstall that
Windows boxes every so often because EVERY game they install comes
with its own, incompatible with the rest, version of DirectX which
eventually screws up their entire systems.

functions and (I presume the nptl implementation) can be found only in
/usr/lib/nptl and /usr/include/nptl. I tried to hack around by asking
a library to use the corresponding -L and -I flags, but it looks like
I have to reconfigure and recompile every app from scratch to do
this... Any way gcc can do this by itself? It seems natural for me
that pthreads should use those directories when indeed getconf returns
NPTL. Am I going wrong somewhere?

Btw, I use Debian Testing. linux 2.6.16-beyond2. gcc 4.1.2. glibc 2.3.6.

(The library which happened to need the np functions
(pthread_attr_setaffinity_np) was evas with threaded rendering
support)

it moves on...

Subject: [Ilugc] How much disk space for Fedora Core 5
Message-ID: <133561.46291.qm@web36804.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I want to install Fedora Core 5. Also I have limited disk space. So I would like to allocate just the right amount for the linux partition.

These are the things i want.

I would like to install both GNOME and KDE, I would like to install most of the developer tools. Also I would install the server tools like samba,httpd etc.

I do not want open office.

Also I need at least 1.0 GB free space on that partition.

I know this is a very rough idea of what i would be installing, but can you guys suggest how much disk space i should give to the partition ( only to the partition and not to the swap)

Thanks.

Hi,

I have xemacs21 (and also emacs-22.0.90..) on my system. Am trying to get
the rails mode installed. I followed the instructions as found at
http://blog.katipo.co.nz/?p=21

To summarize, I have installed ruby1.8-elisp, ecb, emacs-rails, snippet.el,
find-recursive.el and have copied them to the relevant site-lisp directory.
My .emacs file looks like this:

______________________________________________
(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook
(lambda()
(add-hook 'local-write-file-hooks
'(lambda()
(save-excursion
(untabify (point-min) (point-max))
(delete-trailing-whitespace)
)))
(set (make-local-variable 'indent-tabs-mode) 'nil)
(set (make-local-variable 'tab-width) 2)
(imenu-add-to-menubar "IMENU")
(require 'ruby-electric)
(ruby-electric-mode t)
))
(defun try-complete-abbrev (old)
(if (expand-abbrev) t nil))

(setq hippie-expand-try-functions-list
'(try-complete-abbrev
try-complete-file-name
try-expand-dabbrev))

(require 'rails)

;; If you want to use Mongrel instead of WEBrick, add this to you .emacs
file:
; (setq rails-use-mongrel t)
______________________________________________

Now when I start emacs I get this error:
Symbol's value as variable is void: ?ruby-mode-hook

What could be the reason? How can I rectify this?

Thanks,
mano

looks like ruby-mode is not installed when the add-to-list is
eval'd... do a (or (featurep 'ruby-mode) (message "ruby mode is not
loaded as yet")) just before the add-to-list to confirm (replace
'ruby-mode with whatever the main ruby mode file provides... i havent
used this mode)

two options:

1. (require 'ruby-mode) before evaling anything.

for quicker startup...

2. (autoload 'ruby-mode "ruby-mode") ;; Replace string with actual
file name, may be u have already something of this sort / package has
done that for you..
    (eval-after-load "ruby-mode"
      '(progn
         ;; All you ruby-mode init code goes here
       ))

that's a dangerous hack.. (surprised it works actually.. the perms
should reset on reboot)

you should add yourself to the audio group.. atleast for debian..
dunno if that holds for fc5... binand?

Which file do I find the 'add-to-list'?

1. (require 'ruby-mode) before evaling anything.


In which file do I have to put the  (require 'ruby-mode) so that it gets
executed before being evaled?

2. (autoload 'ruby-mode "ruby-mode") ;; Replace string with actual

I was fully talking about your .emacs :)

> Which file do I find the 'add-to-list'?

add-to-list is a function which you have used in the code u pasted...
i meant add the lisp code before that... (just a diagnostic.. u can
remove it off after that)

by the way, i guess it is ruby-mode.. may not be right... look for the
"main" file in the ruby mode package (hopefully something like ruby.el
or ruby-mode.el -- call this file A) and look for the phrase (provide
'<something>) call <something> as B...

then u do

(require 'B)

or

(autoload 'ruby-mode "A")
(eval-after-load "A" '(progn
          ;; All you ruby-mode init code goes here
 ))

HTH

it moves on...

This looks high for painting windows and doors alone. But we dont know the
size of ur house. Normally painting the whole house would cost only that
much.

approx 280 USD....,

Something around or above 220 litres should do.  Godrej is a very good
brand. Cost would be around 8k

Normally when we take an apartment on rent, the owner spruces it up at 
his cost. I'm not sure if you know of the refundable security deposit of 
6-10 months rental that you would need to cough up.

Online is difficult in India. For a/c units, cost varies with tonnage. 
Normally, we use window a/cs here and not split/central. 1.5 tonne would 
  cost approx 25-27K for a branded one. If you are not planning a long 
stay, you could go in for assembled instead of branded. Assembled ones 
come at 60% of branded ones.

In this part of the world, generally speaking, sizes for the same 
application is much smaller than the US. India would be like Europe. 
You'll see this in sizes of cars, houses, appliances, people........

SIngle door 185Ltr fridges cost approx 9K. 230Ltr 2 door would cost 
approx 16K. Four door ones 330Ltr cost approx 35K

How long is your stay here, Lyric?

If it is short enough you might just get yourself a serviced apartment
(somewhere downtown rather than way out in the back of beyond like
manapakkam is .. lets put it this way, you go down a busy highway and
then turn off it, go down a not too good road for 2..3 miles - very
quiet residential area but its still a very new suburb)

Brands - you get all the usual brands for fridges, aircons etc.

Whirlpool is pretty good for both fridges and aircons. Samsung for TVs
etc - all quite cheap.  And yeah - as others have said, $280 should be
enough to paint your house.  Watch for gouging on stuff like this.

And if you rent an apartment, get a brand new one - there's plenty that
shouldnt need refurbishing of any sort, and should still be quite cheap.

Whatever stuff that gets done to refurbish it is all at the owner's cost
.. nothing you have to do there.  And give someone in the area that
address so they can go scope the apartment out.

I assumed add-hook is equivalent to add-to-list and added:

(or (featurep 'ruby-mode) (message "ruby mode is not
loaded as yet"))

just before add-hook. Just as you said, the ruby-mode is not loaded yet. So
I put the initialization lines between

(autoload 'ruby-mode "ruby-mode")
(eval-after-load "ruby-mode" '(progn
 &
))

After doing this I dont get the error/warning. But still the syntax
highlighting does not work. When I open a .rb file, the mode is still
'Fundamental'. In fact, after getting my .emacs file to load successfully,
xemacs21 too does not do syntax highlighting for .rb files! It was doing
fine without the .emacs file (only for .rb files not for rail's .rhtml
files). So, having my own .emacs is clobbering the pre-built support for
ruby in xemacs21 (installed via apt-get from Ubuntu). Emacs22 is
consistently not doing any syntax highlighting for .rb files (and .rhtml
files) - though it does for html/xml, .js (treats .js as java files!) files.

Another question: How do I change the syntax colouring? The default in
xemacs for ruby can barely be called 'highlighting'!!!

Thanks,
mano

All that sounds reasonable, but it should all be billed to the owner
of the flat, not the tenant.

Try Rediff shopping - http://shopping.rediff.com - to get an idea of
approximate prices. Or Fabmall - http://www.fabmall.com.

Credit/debit cards, travellers' cheques... all these work just fine
over there :)

ah.. looks like you haven't setup for ruby-mode to be used for .rb
files (this instruction is usually given in the README/lisp file...
debian packages set it up themselves on package installation)

add this somewhere to ur .emacs

(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.r\\(b\\|html\\)$" . ruby-mode))

> Another question: How do I change the syntax colouring? The default in
> xemacs for ruby can barely be called 'highlighting'!!!

1. check if you have font-lock-mode enabled (most probably u have it
on if you have *some* highlighting)

2. customize the variable `font-lock-maximum-decoration' to set to
maximum decoration, the value for which is `t'

use M-x customize-variable font-lock-maximum-decoration

3. check the faces (description of font/colors/sizes etc). most of the
defaults are sane, but there may be one or two faces which look the
same.

easiest way to customize them all is to use

M-x customize-group font-lock-faces

4. check the customization group for the package.. M-x customize-group
ruby-<tab>
(not really sure what the group names would be... tab completion
should help) check if there are any fontification related customizable
variables and faces. a rare screwed up package could have bypassed
font-lock and implemented their own fontification, in which case the
first three steps would not hold..

if all this fails, and the package uses font-lock (99.99% it would
be), you can customize font-lock-keywords to provide the fanciest
syntax highlighting possible, but i am not going to tell you how :p
its a bit complex, you would be better off looking at other
alternatives or paining the author to improve the mode.

i haven't used ruby, but i hear the syntax is very similar to perl..
may be try using cperl-mode (comes shipped with emacs these days)...
that has more fontification (provided you ask it for that) than you
would ever need in your entire life :) and is considered by many as
one of the most user-friendly packages around (get to know the
package, and you will know why :) )

it moves on...

thanks for the advice and the welcome...I am getting the apartment
from someone I have known for a long time and would trust with my
life...he owns it but has never lived in it, but i have no fear that
he will do whatever is needed and he has said so...he will be paying
for the updates but he is now a bit out of touch with current
pricing...that is why I am looking into it...any idea what the
turn-around time is on getting a frig. cooktop, beds, etc. into the
flat? I will arrive 2 wks before my wife and kids...and would like it
to be as done as possible before they arrive

thanks for your time!

A gas connection (aka a contract to buy bottled butane/propane mix)
takes rather longer, and has more paperwork for you to do.

Would suggest you ask your friend if he has one to spare, that'd be the
best [they require a bunch of ID, lots of red tape if you need a fresh one].

As for the rest (milk, papers etc) the local people supplying that will
turn up all by themselves within a day or so of your moving in. Do check
if your place has broadband near it though - or you could just buy a
datacard (kind of like verizon's aircard) from one of several local
mobile phone providers, just for home use.

I dont think he'll have tough time with it. Being a non-Indian, AFAIK he
wont be eligible for the subsidy for domestic LPG. All the paper work we do,
if i'm right, is for availing the subsidy.

I think that new gas connection from Indane, HP and Bharat gas are now
available for only who have a ration card. I heard that Tamil Nadu
government is strictly enforcing this as there is a subside for the gas.
In other words, a person without a ration card is not going to get gas
connection from these agencies. He has to go for private gas like Spic
Jyothi, etc which is costlier by 150+ INR. This rule is already in
Bangalore (Karnataka). I heard that it is now enforced in Chennai as well.

Praveen.

If you are going for private connection, then the procedures/formalities 
might be a little lenient, especially if they know you are moving in 
from foreign country. Ask your friend to contact the private agent and 
ask about it.

BSNL Broadband will be surely available, it is there even in a village 
20 Kms off chengelpet and hence, manapakkam shouldn't be a problem. 
Also, as far as BSNL you can get both the telephone connection as well 
as Braodband (which is true to other Private providers also). It is 
comparatively cheap such that Telephone+Internet might cost you around 
1500 Rs per month ( Plan Unlimited Broadband 900 INR per month + 
Telephone Landline Plan which depends on your corresponding plan). And, 
BSNL wont 99% say they wont give you a conenction if it is in a remote 
area. If you can take care of the line man ( ;-) ) then you can get the 
connection ASAP.

There are quite a  lot of Mobile Phone service providers in India and 
you can select a suitable one depending on the plan and prices that will 
suit you. The best ones for Chennai/Tamil Nadu is Airtel and Aircel.

You are always welcome :)

prices on websites are 'MRP' or list prices. Street prices are  
different and increase if you are a foreigner or dont know tamil. Go  
to a big shop for appliances. Brands are LG, Godrej, Bosch, Samsung.  
Bargain - you are expected to. (hint: ask for a discount). If you buy  
everything in one shop, insist on free delivery. If they charge for  
delivery, tell them to add the charge to your bill. Most shops will  
send the company representative to install the appliance and give you  
the warranty card. The company rep will turn up a day or two after  
delivery.

bah, just ask your friend if he has a spare connection [in his name]
that he can let you have.. that should be reasonable.  If not - like
others have said, there are some private providers

Airtel's just fine - 512k bandwidth tops though, not 2 mbps. And its
metered (1 to 3 gigs transfer cap a month, so slow down on the p2p and
linux image ftp'ing .. there's a well developed sneakernet here) :)

Airtel, Hutch, etc - lots of them around. Hutch is a bit neater / more
professional than airtel is, I've found.  Make sure your phone is
tri-band GSM, by the way - or you can pick up nokias or whatever for
quite cheap here.

I find that people are doing their best to help you out in whatever manner possible.

But all I have to say is "just come, let us take care of the rest as things come."

Just play by the ear. Different ppl will always have different perspectives and it will be hard for you to decide which way to go.

Just come with some uncertainty and enjoy the experience.

India is very different today. But for the infamous gas connection, you can buy anything and everything with money.

And you can theoretically buy an electric stove and cook too...

And ppl are very professional in Chennai and extremely fast too.

So don't get worried. All will be well.

People in general don't cheat here just because you are a foreigner. If you have an idea about the rates and show that you are not gullible people will immediately start making sense.

There are so many foreign students studying in IIT Madras and other foreigners working in IT companies in Chennai and Blore. If you really feel like I could put you in touch with them, but I doubt if you need that.

All the best!

We are looking fwd to meeting you in Chennai ASAP!

Girish

did you try umount from command line? there is a force umount option.
try man umount for that. For the wireless you can use NDISWrapper and
use the windows driver itself.

I have my doubts about this. The last time I applied for a gas
connection (Indane, Hyderabad, 2002), it was a one-afternoon job. A
letter from my employer (residence proof), a copy of my driving
license (id proof), some money (I think around Rs. 800 - deposit) and
I had a connection. They asked me to take my first cylinder along with
me, with a promise of home delivery from the second cylinder onwards.

So very true. Chennaiites are used to having non-Indians around,
unlike certain other places I could mention.

Hi,
      If you umount (unmount) the per drive, u can eject. But i can't get
your exact doubt.
      AND
      Most of the laptop with Linux it would not support wireless. But we
can enable wireless using ndiswrapper. It means we can load windows driver
into linux system. (but not by installation)

Thanks a lot for the patient guidance, Ramkumar.

I had really screwed up the installation of the various .el files. Patiently
followed the instructions in each of the files and it works fine now :-)

But for the infamous gas connection, you can buy anything and everything with money.

   People in general don't cheat here just because you are a foreigner. If you have an idea about the rates and show that you are not gullible people will immediately start making sense.

Message-ID: <dcd8ccf50612201820l179edb1ch8cee351931cf48f7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to buy a portable hard disk (USB connectible). When I was
looking in the Bazaar, on the box it is written it is compatible for WinX
and Mac (Brands: Buffalo, Logitec). But I would like to have one compatible
for Linux too. Could you please advise if I could format it to use for Linux
and Windows? Or should I have to go for one manufactured to be compatible
for Linux as well? Appreciate your suggestions.

Thanks.

Practically any USB storage device will work quite well on a Linux system (at 
least, a reasonably recent system). There are one or two that may not, but 
they are really in the minority. I think that both the brands you mentioned 
should work.

Hi!

   I have a code that I started last night. I generally run the executables
with the time command, but I didn't and I want to know how long it took to
run ?? Are these logs stored anywhere on the comp.. ??

  I did some searching and found init does some logs. I tried to see
/var/log/wtmp and /var/run/utmp.. both are binary files !! Anything else I
can do ??

  I have not yet shut off my system and it's continuing to get fried.. so
even session specific methods will be extremely useful.. This was not run
from GNOME.. i ran it from one of those 6 other terminals that I have
(Ctrl+Alt+F1) after shutting off xserver for improved performance.

As regards what I was running .. it was just a FORTRAN exectulable.. a.out

bye !!

Linux will detect most of the std USB based Ext HDDs.  Recently I
connected the 160GB iOmega Ext HDD and it is automatically get
detected in FC3.

You can see the contents of both these files using utmpdump command. But it
will just tell u the tty startup times.. not the process startup times..
:(.. Will that information useful??..

Dont worry about the stickers. I recently bought one seagate 320GB, with
both SATA and IDE sockets. It came with ext3 fs by default.

As far as I know.. there is no log that will tell u the exact time a
process took. 

I always have time set in my command prompt. It helps me to calculate
the approx time a process took .. provided u dont start it as a
background job. 

May be you can look at var/log/message .. a place where most programs
dump logs. Some other logs from database or other programs might help
you. (provided you accessed database or communicated with other
programs)

If you want php stuff, then you podium. I use S5 (does not depend on
php). I guess Rasmus also uses podium.

See how Indians welcome outsiders!!!  Is this a common behavior with
everyone in India? or only with Indian Geeks?

In my opinion Indians are in general, xenophobic. It is only urban
Indians (like ilugc) with modern facilities like Internet access and
hence a general awareness of the world who aren't.

What do you mean by contents need to be added statically, and what is 
the problem?

If you use OOo.org or Powerpoint too, you need to add the content 
statically, but throw in a bit of scripting.

This you can always do with S5, since its uses HTML for the content, CSS 
for formatting, JavaScript for attaching behaviours.

I think Indians are very hospitable to foreigners - specifically to
Caucasians. Actually, this is true of most parts of Asia.

Also, rural India is far more hospitable than urban India.

However, the Indian government is not very welcoming of foreigners -
foreigners are expected to register with a police station on arrival, pay
extra at all tourist spots/hotels etc. This attitude is short-sighted.

If India is to have a vibrant atmosphere where creativity and innovation
thrives then India must be willing to bring in the best and the brightest
into our fold and accept them for what they are with all their cultural
baggage and also make it easier for them to take up jobs locally.

well, actually, the 'subsidy' is a story that the government would like for all
of us to swallow. subsidy, gubsidy, no such thing. the 'subsidy' is with respect
to what is called 'import parity price' which is a price which includes (a
hefty) customs duty. the actual market price of lpg is around $0.3 per kg
wholesale or about $0.4 per kg retail delivered to your house. to get an idea of
what is the customs duty, compare to the private gas suppliers price (or the
commercial cylinder price). what the government is claiming as subsidy is really
only lost customs revenue - which is bound to happen if one fixes both the duty
level and the selling price. yeah, this is waaaaay ot.

yes of course.. this can be done..but i think it certainly needs database
interaction to populate the contents dynamically.

Hi All,

How to find out a particular running service is
belongs to inetd or xinetd (without using chkconfig
--list)?.

Eg:

[scbops@emortapp ~]$ netstat -pat
(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned
process info
 will not be shown, you would have to be root to see
it all.)
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address              
Foreign Address             State       PID/Program
name

                     LISTEN      -
tcp        0      0 *:ssh                       *:*   
                     LISTEN      -

::ffff:10.144.221.109:1108  ESTABLISHED -

ftp/ssh belongs to which inetd or xinetd ?.

You can avoid that by writing a simple generator program or using one of 
the already written ones.

If you fix this (run netstat -p under root privs), then you will be
able to see which processes are running under xinetd and which are
standalone services.

hello Bruce Mathew,
                      You can unmount the pendrive using umount
command.Still if the pendrive is mounted then close all the processes that
are using the pendrive.Even if this fails then kill the bash or logout from
the working terminal.Then try to re enter and unmount the pendrive.It will
be unmounted :)
        Please do  tell the error thet you get while unmounting the
pendrive.

There must be crypto related mailing lists and IRC channels I am sure but I have only been listening to OpenSSH, OpenSSL and OpenBSD mailing lists. But these are really advanced and not suited for crypto beginners.

Pick up a copy of Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier and read it. He has written it in an entertaining manner.


Another good book is Introduction to cryptography or some such title by William H Stallings.

Frankly it took me at least 4 months to get a grasp of crypto and nearly a year to become comfortable with it. It is both broad and deep.

I did start with browsing the Internet. 

Hope this answers your question. You are welcome to get in touch with me personally should you have further questions.

Best of luck!

Hi All,

Is it possible to do some simple arithmetic in gnuplot during the
plotting? For example, in the following cmd, I want to multiply the
5th col by 100 before plotting.

plot "Foo" using 4:5 title 'Foo' with lines

Bye :)

Probably the socket is created under /tmp.
Try mysql -S /tmp/mysql.sock.

enable mysql logging. what contents do u have in my.cnf ? what interface
is mysql listening at ? you can find this from netstat output.  what do
u see in the log files ? 
the contents of my my.cnf  are 



 cat /etc/my.cnf
[mysqld]
datadir=/var/lib/mysql
socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
set-variable = max_allowed_packet=16M
log=/tmp/mysqld.log
     
[mysql.server]
user=mysql
basedir=/var/lib
log=/tmp/mysqld.log

[safe_mysqld]
err-log=/var/log/mysqld.log
pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid

The program runs as a daemon on your machine. You can configure
evolution/* to connect to it and talk POP3.

Do a 'netstat' to see where the 'mysql' server is listening.

I think kudzu should have detected it on booting. Did you have this
card during install or did you add it recently? If you are having
problems getting an X11 display, try
X -configure
will create a /root/corg.conf.new and
X -config xorg.conf.new

If that worked, replace /etc/X11/xorg.conf with /root/xorg.conf.new

Btw, I don't know if it is xorg.conf or XF86config in RH9. But it
applies to both, i think.

PS:You might need to edit the mouse device section alone

Something tells me there will be good news for everyone. :)

I am happy to get 2 MBPS dl for nothing though I wonder what application I will have for it. I am sure there will be many.

If only I could get a good uplink that can solve my hosting problems it will be great.

I expect at least a 512 kbps uplink which will satisfy my needs...

I was told by the call center and a BSNL employee that they configure uplink to be 1/4 of downlink which means the above.

God only knows what BSNL is upto.

I think even the Gods will find it difficult to predict the whims of our ministers...

The problem in my case is different (I think). The device mounts,
everything works well... Once in a while, after a long time, it just
stops for a minute and continues... I suspect that the drive gets
heated up.. I am not hardware expert, but I guess those in the list
could point at what the problem could be...

it moves on..

Do you get any DMA errors on that thing?  A lot of those USB hard disks
are cheap old IDE / noname taiwanese types .. or its an older USB bus
and the data transfer for a large file / frequent disk reads etc
overloads the USB bus so there's a delay, sometimes.

no dma errors... this is actually a good internal ide disk (seagate,
afaicr) and on top of that is an usb casing... no brand for that i
guess :)

older usb bus? usb 2.0 this is...

Then probably a drive that's running a bit hot as you said. Some of
those external drive casings have fans .. does yours have one?

nope.. no fan :( i am thinking if I should run it without the
aluminium casing... the richie street guy scared me off the idea
saying the circuitry is too complex :) but i guess it should help
sometimes...

Anything over a simple ckt to demonstrate ohms law is probably too
complex for the guy. You can easily bolt on an external fan and I've
seen several casings that do come with fans [mercy electronics adyar
though, not ritchie street]

Al casing + no fan is not going to cool your hdd down very much.

try 'Chartdirector' from advsofteng.com.
API is available in many languages (Perl/Python/C/C++ etc...)
check out the latest features if it fits ur requirement.

Thx for reply. But in windows all the four speakers are working for the same mp3 files. I found the base / treble, surround control in ALSA mixer, but there is no change in audio, if I increase any of the control.

If you are ok with programming, you might try the GD library with php.
http://in.php.net/gd

that, with javascript, might help you show tooltips.

For reporting needs, I had once used Jasper, which is an opensource
reporting engine, connects to database and let's you generate reports
with images - on the fly, with images as well if needed.

Hi all,

aah ! atlast ! i could make my usb external hdd work hotplugged! on an x86_64 RHEL 4.0

I had statically compiled 'sd_mod', 'scsi_mod' (as i have a pure scsi hardware), 'usbcore', 'usb-storage' and left 'st' and 'sg' to be dynamicially compiled into the kernel 2.6.18.3.
after that i could boot properly,  and then had to install sg_utils additionally  (since GLIBC < 2.4)
(if GLIBC >= 2.4 install sg3_utils package)
and then scanned the scsi interfaces with 'sg_scan -i'
then-onwards, when i plug in the usb hdd, udev automatically creates device file to access the external harddrive and i could mount and format it.
now 'lsusb' also shows the device :)

thank u for all ur inputs.
regards,
KM

But RH9 is ancient.

It was released on March 31st, 2003 and comes with zero support or 
updates now. No one knows how many security holes are in it now. Unless 
installing on an old system it wont work properly because it does not 
support newer hardware technologies.

If you miss the Bluecurve look under Debian install 
gtk2-engines-wonderland to get it.

There's a wrapper over GD specifically for graphing/plotting:

Please don't ask anyone to make graphs using just GD. That's just 
sadistic :)

Come on. The Fedora Legacy project (and others too, some commercial)
still support RH9. Remember that Redhat always had a big commercial
customer base who were less inclined to upgrade to later versions (if
I had my way, I'd still be running the rock-solid RH 7.3) - that has
spun off several companies/organisations who offer support for these
old versions.

Since you have not mentioned the programming language you are using, I
would also mention Matplotlib for Python. It's excellent, and can be
used for non-interactive plotting as well.

These services may be suitable for people who already have a large investment in
RH9 but not for anyone else and they are also disappearing slowly.

I often have people new to Linux asking for RH9 and I always steer them away
from it. They seem to have heard about RH9 but are completely in the dark about
Fedora.

And FYI,
Fedora Legacy won't maintain support for FC4 and lower since Dec 12th.
The Progeny service also ended last year.

Even I have the same problem. (I guess) It is due to some kind of power
save mode or something similar to this. I keep the external hard disk on
all most all the time. Some times I watch movies stored in external hard
disk. I find that movies stop all of a sudden, the very same moment the
light in the external hard disk goes down. Then I power it on and mount
it again and continue with the movie. This happens many times. 

I use ZX-8 Series - Seagate  320GB , + built in fan + SATA to SATA, SATA
to USB2.0 , IDE to USB2.0 converters. 

the problem happens when i use SATA to usb2.0 converter.

How did you get to alsamixer? Are you using any GUI frontend or did
you invoke the command line utility "alsamixer"? In the command line
alsamixer, there is one option "Duplicate". Turn it on get sound from

Vanakkam,

I have a 80 GB external USB hard disk.

Now I would like to have an OS installed on it and if needed when I boot my
notebook and choose the USB as first boot device, the OS installed on USB
HDD should boot.

I tried it once with Ubuntu and Fedora but in vain. Please give
suggestions....

For this to happen, you need to install a bootloader
on the MBR of the external USB hard-disk. This can be
done during installation or later.

What did you try?

Subject: [Ilugc] [RFC] "I took the Red Pill" project/wiki site
Message-ID: <733621.1353.qm@web50215.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,

This is w.r.t. the thread at PLUG (Pune):
http://frodo.syminet.com/pipermail/plug-mail/2006-December/001484.html

on common questions like, "will I get job if I learn
linux", "who uses FOSS in the industry?". Its the
ignorance. Please follow the thread. So, I thought we
can start a project/wiki link called "I took the Red
pill" in our wiki: 

http://chennailug.org/wiki/?title=I_took_the_Red_Pill

with the following details:

1. Name.
2. Company/place where working
(Self/industry/academia).
3. Educational background (school/college/university).
4. FOSS domain.

It can mean either of the following:

1. It doesn't matter what you "study", but, you can
work on FOSS in the industry.

OR

2. I studied in the same school/college as you, and I
am currently working on FOSS (self or industry or
academia).

If you do not wish to mention the educational
background OR the company, that is ok. But, not both.
If you don't have a wiki account, but, would like to
add your details, please send me an e-mail, and your
details can be added. Or, get a wiki account to add
your details.

Background:
Morpheus in the Matrix [2] tells Neo: "This is your
last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You
take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in
your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You
take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show
you how deep the rabbit-hole goes. "

So, in our context, taking the red pill is getting to
know the truth or source code (free/open source).
Taking the blue pill would be just accepting the life
around with "trusted" closed-source, proprietary
systems.

Any thoughts/suggestions/feedback welcome.

Don;t have time to go through the whole thread but I think I can guess
the direction it took. :-)

Why don't we just generalize it. I'm *involved* in FOSS and have a job
with FOSS technologies being my primary tools. The above "choices"
look confusing (IMHO) and will scare people away..

Getting an account is trivial. If one can't do that I wonder if his
name should go up.

I have seen such things in many other LUGs as well. Think, from the next 
time we present in some college about LUG, we will show how diverse 
educational qualification we have, what are we doing and what kind of 
contributions we put in, we may be working in a FOSS based work or not.

Should we have this a fixed structure or should be like "i studied here, 
this is how i got interested in GNU/Linux and FOSS, this is how i 
involved myself, and i got a job like this and am contributing like 
this" and additionally some extra thoughts which may motivate newbies.

"Mess with the best! Or die like the rest!" ;)
open source is at first a 'kashayam' rather than a pill, it tastes 
bitter, but once we get used to it there is no better curing medicine on 
earth :)

As i said, am adding it to our standard presentation slides which we 
have been using for all presentations till now. Am also preparing the 
slides fresh to suit small duration (30 mins) presentation as well as 
long ones (1 hour). Will put it up once am done with it for your reviews. :)

A very interesting thread indeed. One thing I am against though; and 
that is pushing universities to use FOSS (entirely).

Not wanting to start a flamewar or anything; but I feel that it is a 
university's responsibility to teach its CS student _everything_ there 
is to know about Computer Science in general. A university can _never_ 
officially endorse FOSS; simply because it does not form the software 
industry in its entirety; and I will also be bold enough to say that it 
forms only a small part of it.

Asking a university to stop using proprietary software is stupid. Not 
teaching CS students how to use Windows or Oracle is equally stupid. You 
need to teach students what is actually relevant in the world today; and 
I think we all accept the fact that there are many non-FOSS technologies 
that are still very prevalent in the industry.

What we must be actually pushing for is to dedicate atleast a little bit 
of the course towards FOSS. FOSS forms, say 20% of the software industry 
today; and a corresponding 20% of the time must be spent towards 
teaching it. But that's about it. Extremism will get us nowhere.

Just my 2 Paise ;)

Again, not indulging in flame war or even an argument with my buddy, I 
add my single paisa!

What we are trying to (as from ilugc) is to give equal exposure to 
students about FOSS, as to what they were getting in Proprietary 
software. We always make sure to point out that we are not anti-M$ or 
anti-doze.

Its also necessary to teach them about FOSS because the teachers who 
have to teach the students about FOSS are themselves not pretty much 
aware of FOSS, so we have to take the first step.

If you have checked the last mail i sent a hour ago, this time we are 
dealing teachers and only teachers. So, may be what you say might happen 
  in future - i.e. FOSS aware teachers themselves teach students about 
FOSS and we are just trying to make that happen :)

Giving them equal exposure in FOSS is our duty, and its then upto them 
to decide what they are going to embrace!

I agree, and thats what we are trying - awareness rather than conversion!

Here ends my single paisa! ;)

++1.

NRCFOSS, has an interesting way of offering electives
on FOSS (GNU/Linux, etc.). I appreciate!

I am waiting for UGC's to consider this option and
courses such as BSc (I. T.) and BSc(C.S.) can
exclusively offer them for interested students to
select them.

I cannot agree with this. Keeping in mind these are CS students, the
college's job is not to tech them HOW to use Windows or Oracle, but to
enable them to design tomorrow's Windows or Oracle. I really can't
agree to the argument that a compilers course can be taught equally
well with GCC and Visual Studio; or an RDBMS course with Postgres and
Oracle. A student of Automobile Engineering can look at a real world
car to learn the practical application of his/her theoretical
knowledge; why should a CS student be any different?

You can't design something like Windows if you haven't used it. That's 
like making candy when you have never even tasted it. Corporates expect 
CS students to know how to use Windows and Oracle. Very few corporates 
expect the same about Linux and PostgreSQL.

What I'm saying is that you must treat all implementations of a 
particular concept _equally_. That's why Tanenbaum's book on Operating 
system considers both Windows and Linux as case studies. That's how it 
should be. You need to have both Windows and Linux based labs in a 
university with a ratio that reflects the real world (80-20?)

I'm not sure I understand your point here. Why can't you teach good C 
programming using Visual Studio? Why can't you teach good RDBMS concepts 
with Oracle? In an ideal case, as a CS student; I must know how to use 
both GCC _and_ Visual Studio. What the hell, I should even be taught to 
use XCode!

The bottom-line is that any university cannot "endorse" FOSS in any way; 
but merely "introduce" their students to it. Again, I remind you; FOSS 
forms a small part of the entire Software Industry; and must be treated 
like that; atleast from an academic perspective.

Yes; the electives designed by NRCFOSS is a good step in that direction. 
It's good to dedicate 2 courses to FOSS; but that's about it. We should 
not push for more; and never ever tell any university to remove Windows 
and put Linux in all their labs!

Education, academia are to be *independant* of
corporate.

Too generic a statement.

Concepts, true - independant of corporate
needs/requirements.

That cannot be determined in reality.

We are dealing with concepts and methodologies. Use
programming languages as tools and tools only.

> FOSS 
> forms a small part of the entire Software Industry;

Incorrect. Statement not based on any facts. India is
one of the biggest consumers of free/open source
software [1]. David Axmark, co-founder of the MySQL
project also commented the same in his talk in
February 2006 [3].

> and must be treated 
> like that; atleast from an academic perspective.

Incorrect. You don't seem to have had exposure to
"real education" (like IIT, NITs) or education abroad.

Linux was an academia project.

How can you tell?

*Designed* for theoretical, maybe. Something is better
than nothing. After interacting with students, I can
tell that implementation is not fruitful. Also find
review by Raman [2].

The point was not about teaching good C programming, but about
teaching compiler design.    Having GCC's source code available
expedites the student's understanding of compiler concepts, which
Visual Studio cannot provide (unless you sign up for one of those
shared source licenses).

The point was about CS students - who are expected to implement rather than use.

Hi friends,

   First of all accept my warm wishes for Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

   http://girish1729.googlepages.com/wish.jpg

   Guess what is special about New Year?

   You can wish anybody irrespective of who they are in India.

   Anyway the purpose of this mail is not that.

   I drew this cartoon with tgif and a few images off the Internet.

   But all the images have been processed. You can recognize which image I have taken but the cartoon is my idea of course.

   It took only a trifling investment of time and effort. But the result I hope at least is satisfying.

   And of course, I don't have a Wacom tablet or anything. :)

   I just dropped the bunch of images I got into tgif.

   Cropped the parts I liked. I did lot of drawing on the bottom left image. You cannot make out I think that substantial effort has gone into making that image from the base image. And I fouled up the last image on the right just to make sure that I don't run into copyright issues...

   Anyway somehow I could quickly come up with a nice them,some verbiage and a few ellipses, arrows and text and I was done.

   I have got very few responses for this, but I love it.

   For the investment I put in the results are certainly impressive.

   Moral of the story, tgif is cool.

   gimp is not the only tool out there. ;)

   Wish you all a great 2007 guys!

   2006 is the year I discovered ILUGC.

   Or rather Bharathi helped me discover ILUGC...

   May 2007 bring you happiness, joy and prosperity to you.

   And fulfill all your desires.

   How many of you have resolved to become official developers this year?

   Or get into hacking seriously?

   Or better still , entrepreneurship?

   Wish you Godspeed!

   regards,
   Girish

Man,

	Can we avoid such "dangerous" remarks please?

	One depressing characteristic I have seen in many smart ppl is snobbishness and I have suffered a lot due to that in my college days.

	I used to get treated like a cigarette butt just because I was not good at scoring marks.

	But sometimes I find myself behaving snobbishly...

	I think it is the biggest bane of intellectuals worldwide.

	Please let us understand the brotherhood of man.

	"Each soul is potentially divine."

	Let us stand shoulder to shoulder and work for the benefit of our society, country and the world at large.

	We should promote excellence but not at the cost of being snobbish. I know it is hard but should be possible.

Best,
Girish

ideal is a platform neutral syllabus like MIT OCW. Given the level of  
teaching staff we have here, this would result in their taking the  
path of least resistance - proprietary software. So ideal wont work  
here. Although the very concept of foss electives is silly, we push  
it because it is needed to correct the existing bias. It is like  
reservations in admissions - not democratic, but necessary to correct  
past imbalances. And you cant really teach *anything* in depth unless  
you are able to pull it apart and examine how it works ...

What is wrong in seeing Visual Studio's code under Shared Source? One of 
the aims of Shared Source was to help the academia in understanding 
Microsoft's Code. Also, let me remind you that source code was always 
available to students and professors under several Microsoft Campus 
programs even before Shared Source came along.

In fact; I think it is an enriching experience to see both the source 
code of Visual Studio and GCC; to see two different angles of the 
implementation. There's a lot to be learnt from Visual Studio; really! 
Microsoft doesn't spend billions of dollars every year to produce junk 
code ;)

Again, I say that you need to first use and then implement. You can't 
implement if you're not a master of usage :)

Hi Shakthi,

Not at the undergraduate level. From mission statement of our 
college[1]: "To create technical manpower for meeting the current and 
future demands of industry."

This is statistics from the field: 8 out of 10 companies wants working 
knowledge of the Windows OS when they come for campus recruiting; NOT Linux.

Oh, so FOSS is now mainstream is it?! Folks at Slashdot will be very 
happy... C'mon; both you and I _know_ for a fact that FOSS does _NOT_ 
form the entire software industry; and it is far from it.

I am, in fact, from an NIT. Your (should I say snobbish) statement has 
greatly devalued yourself in my eyes; I would expect something more 
mature from a person of your stature.

Torvalds could have easily made Linux closed source; as easily as he 
made it free. He just happened to be the right person at the right time. 
Thousands of kernels (Linux quality) are produced from universities all 
over the world, every year..

The implementation was not followed up properly and that is the fault of 
the college; not NRCFOSS. When the same elective is implemented in my 
College; things will be _vastly_ different; I assure you.

Education should either be platform independent; or all platforms should 
be taught with equal vigor.

It mesg. shows up in my setup too. But interestingly, I go ahead and select
real player and say continue. it works. Now this is in Windows. In Linux,
(Ubuntu) my real player doesn't start up. Yet to check.

This is very critical info. Hence we can more or less rule out network issues.

Perhaps realplayers in Windoze uses a different port for RTP streams?

It is hard to guess as I myself have never tried to listen to this.

Could you do some network sniffing with tcpdump?

Because not many students can afford to buy licenses for using these
at home? And also because many students might want to see the source
code for the tools?

Thanks.

>From a non-compsci pov:
In my college, the prod. and mech. students were taught designing
using AutoCad and ProE, because they are what the industry uses.
Also, Matlab was more prevelant than Scilab because of its ubiquity
and greater acceptance.

Technical prowess of the tool makes a bigger impact on selection of the
tool as a teaching aid, than how it is licensed or policy adopted.

So yes, I agree with you in that industry trend plays a role while
recommending a tool/suit as a teaching aid.

Things become a bit different when it comes to computer science,
as pointed by others.

However, in my opinion, this thread is comparing tools/software
to philosophy/licensing policy. Which leads to a great deal of confusion.
While Windows, Oracle and Visual Studios are software, FOSS is a
philosophy - a licensing policy. Yes FOSS does end with the word
'software', but in effect its a s/w is licensed, a way of thinking. So a
justified comparison cannot be made.

Technical capabilities of Windows should be compared to that of Linux.
GPL should be compared to EULA of MS.

Hello fellows,

maybe this two companies are the interesting ones ;-)

another point: 
    What about dynamic languages? 
    What if you want to enable the user of your application to use "macros" or even "scripting"?
    How to do that in a closed source env? (I don't know actually how to do that in a MS world, so plz answer seriously, so we can learn something)
    In a FS env one can adapt an engine/interpreter from let's say lua, ruby ...

True for around 70% campus recruitments in colleges in
Mumbai.

you can take a horse  to the water - you cant make it drink. If a  
college which allows students only to lay hands on a computer once a  
semester claims to implement the foss elective, what do you propose  
we should do? Good colleges will implement everything well. Bad  
colleges will implement everything badly.

I hope I'm not fanning a potential flame war, but some points need to be
made. Well, sure you see the code. You find a bug. You want to fix it.
You dutifully report it MS. Will it be fixed? When is it going to see
the light of the day? At least 6 months differential till you get the
VS.Net "update"? Why do I need to wait that long when I know how to fix
the problem? And do you really think they will accept a student's patch
into Windows source code?

Call me cynical, but Shared Source thing started being bandied about
pretty recently, and that too to counter FOSS insurgency in the
academia. I don't think it took off, and I don't think it will, which is
just as well.

Warped logic. Spending billions of dollars is no guarantee of software
quality. You can get surprisingly good quality software with minimum
investment. At least, FOSS helps you do that.

Come on. You can use a software for years, become a "master user" in it,
and still not know how it actually works. You will know a lot about
automobiles by just taking apart a car than driving around for hours.

there are several issues here. Better companies would prefer to  
recruit people with programming skills rather that proficiency in  
specific tools. Lesser companies prefer proficiency in specific tools  
to general skills. A person proficient in oracle could become  
obsolete if oracle became obsolete - or if the company moved to a  
different RDBMS. But a person skilled in SQL would never become  
redundant. The problem is teachers - easy to teach a specific tool,  
difficult to teach a general skill. Colleges have to juggle - last  
thing anyone competent will become is a teacher. Companies have to  
juggle also.

secondly, licensing is the least part of foss. It is the development  
methodology that is the important part.

dont forget, there are the BSD style licenses too which are just as  
foss as the GPL.

Meh? Ever heard of the term "invention" or "innovation"? Why would I be

(and everyone knows how low the bar is) ?

As Shakthi says, that's just too much generalization. Different
"corporates" need different kind of programmers. You are only looking at
the biggies here. If you care to research a little more, there are lots
of startups looking for good open source programmers, right here in India.

Why should they? When the "learning potential" is more with FOSS, it is
perfectly appropriate to concentrate on/give more importance to that.
I'm sure a guy who can grok PostgreSQL very well will make a pretty good
Oracle programmer, maybe better than a guy who learnt just Oracle. I've
done both, so you're getting it from the horse's mouth.

There is a reason Tanenbaum kept Minix that way - he wanted it to be
simple enough for students to hack on it. 'Nuff said.

I would say the university is either misinformed or just plain sissy. If
you believe teaching FOSS will benefit the students, there is nothing
wrong in endorsing it. And it's about time.

never mind.. it was just a remark on the lighter side from a

I already posted a link to my databases. As a student,
you don't get exposure to the industry in India. That
is a pity, and that is something that I address in my
"Careers with GNU/Linux" talk.

You are an exception for a person from NIT. I feel
sorry for you.

I have been to NIT, Calicut and know the work done by
students. I have also interacted with students from
NIT, Tiruchirappalli.

NO rule to make target `init/main.o`
needed by 'init/built-in.o'


Note:
I hav already tried compiling the kernel 2.6.9 in Fc3 and ended it with
error message..which made me switch to debian  now,where i cud perform
whatsoever the case may be.

A loopback device is a temporary, virtual disk.

Use loop.ko as modular. You always use it only when
needed.

You didn't want to ask before switching over? :)

More than that, you invent a far more efficient optimization for
something - say pointer arithmetic - can you implement that in Visual
Studio and send the patches to a bunch of experts around the world for
review?

Also, whether the code Microsoft produces is junk or not is still open
to debate. I personally think it is.

Assuming you are talking about the loop device driver (and not the
loopback network interface), you can do:

modprobe loop max_loop=15

(Translating that into the format of /etc/modules.conf for persistence
across reboots left as an exercise)

"..
If pirut doesn't work after anymore after having removed the outdated

make sure you have  the file core.repo in /etc/yum.d/ 
If you dont have, then you can copy from any of your friends running the

Konqueror and other file explorer software already let you do that,
and for the command line geeks find(1) allows fine-grained selection
of files for a later mv(1).

I suppose you can work on Bluetooth Manager for Gnome. It seriously lacks
many things. It just displays the  devices in range. Features like making
connections ,transferring files can be added.

(Somebody correct me If there is good already existing GUI tool for handling
bluetooth devices)

I have never done this shift-click select and move/copy like you do in Windoze under linux. I always use command line.

But I know a lot of people who use KDE/GNOME file managers or nautilus to do this. Things like drag and drop and other Windoze conveniences are all there under linux for those who feel the need for that.

ditto with kwifimanager - shows networks in range, and possibly allows
you to connect to them etc [but if there's stuff like wpa keys etc
needed it doesnt do that automatically, at least for me]

Are you referring to the bug number in 5134 & 2297 HelixCommunity?
https://bugs.helixcommunity.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5134

According to this, RealPlayer Plugin (Helix player plugin also),
crashes with a Seg. Fault, while trying to play from any of the Indian
music sites (Music india, Raaga, Smashits, ...).

https://bugs.helixcommunity.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2297#c12 has a bug
fix, but I never succeeded in compiling (Re-compiling) the Helix
Player. If any one could succeed, please share your experience.

There are several ways to boot and mount the partition of interest.

Perhaps the easiest is getting a liveCD.

Do a "fsck -y" or with some other flag and recover.

If fdisk goofs up nothing to worry. The partition table may be corrupt but your disk partition might be intact.

You can backup after booting into a USB keydrive or something.

In case you want to get the machine back to bootable state just install the appropriate bootblocks using grub.

#grub
 --> setup (hd,0) etc...

 Best of luck!

I hope you are not running Apache inside chroot(1) jail.

For some reason mod_python is not loading. Perhaps you have to change the order in httpd.conf?

What is your line 54 and adjoining lines? Try changing the order and googling.

I have worked with the guts of Apache long ago but I don't recollect much right now. Yes, it is complex. :)

Apache-version/module-version mismatch? Did you use the correct
apache-headers to compile the mod_python DSO?

Hmm., I'm not sure whether you have a program to do this., but.. if you
remember your partition structure (approximately atleast)., you can use
some hex-editors, etc.. to reconstruct the partition-table. But., not a
easy task. Will definitely ruin your happiness.

I think fdisk makes a copy of the partition-table somewhere else. Not
sure. Google should help with this.

gpart is nice to guess the partition table when it is corrupt.

The IDE division of Borland is now a separate company called Codegear -
http://www.codegear.com. Turbo C++ is now available free, and so also
Turbo Delphi, Turbo C# etc. These tools can be used for learning and
commercial development too. If you want the better "professional
editions", they are available for about USD 250/a pop till the end of the
month.

The Visual Studio Express editions are also free. Again, they can be used
for commercial development.

well, if you had acidentally deleted partitions (only the  partition
table entries are reset )and you did not zero the filesystem entries
(which sane people can't ;-) )

Testdisk is there to save your life :)
www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk
pickup a liveCD and and run testdisk. and recover the partition table
or the files from it.

Tried to add profiles, set em default (my default AP uses wep).

Hasn't brought the if up by default when kde starts .. I've had to go
into the network manager and click "activate"

Finally found it faster to run a shell script that does sudo iwconfig
eth0 essid XXX key xxxxxxxxxxx and dhclient3 eth0

It seems to be using gcj and not your "other" JDK.

I am too lazy to do this. I get a nice little window asking me about
the type of key(paraphrase, Hex or ASCII), the key(in the
forementioned form) and the key system(open system or shared key).

seems useful and easier to deploy.

Got all that. Only problem is .. how the hell do I bring it up as soon
as kde starts. Not by opening the network manager from my menu, bringing
up that profile and clicking activate?

Hi,

The bug i am referring is applicable to distros compiled with GCC 4.X.
It used to work well
in older edition of Distros with GCC 3x. So probably the we need
realplayer compatible withh GCC 4.x

This ll help u,

Edit the /etc/conf.d/rc file

# UDEV OPTION:
# Set to "yes" if you want to save /dev to a tar ball on shutdown

Using network-manager on GNOME and I'm not creating any profiles like
what you mention. I just start gnome-session , network-manager applet
loads and finds the Access-Points. I just click on the applet, see the
AP's available and click on the one which I want to connect to.

Have you disabled networking startup scripts (/etc/network/interfaces)
? network-manager needs to manage the network interfaces and
ifup/ifconfig should not be doing it.

Amen to that.
gnome-bluetooth is something which seriously needs attention.

The KDE folks have done an excellent job w.r.t BT, they have a Obex
push client and even support device pairing. BT is one thing for which
I'm totally hooked onto K-apps.

Works just fine with or without network-manager (which is a frontend to
/etc/network/interfaces etc) .. IF i dont have wep etc profiles setup

I know how to hardcode default wep settings for my home network in there
- but how do I do it using network-manager so it starts up by default

Are we talking about the same "NetworkManager" here ?
The one I'm talking about is [1][2]. GNOME's 'Network Settings' is a
frontend for /etc/network/interfaces.

[1] http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/
[2] http://www.redhat.com/magazine/003jan05/features/networkmanager/

The NetworkManager I'm using is not linked to /etc/network/interfaces
in any way.

Ditto for me on Ubuntu 6.10 - I need to run wpa_supplicant and

Ah, do give NetworkManager a try. Removes the WEP/WPA hassles out of
the way when it comes to Wi-Fi access.

For kde there's network-manager-kde which is a systray applet which
does the authentication and takes care of maintaining the link. Even
supports (limited) VPN connectivity. :)

well, it has to do with the cable length - or the signal loss in the cable or
the cable resistance etc. a characteristic loss of 60 db or cable length of
about 6km is good for about 512kbps. if the loss is about 40 db or cable length
of around 3km, one can get 2-3 mbps and so on. of course, the cable lengths
depend on the wire gauge used - if thicker wires are used, the distances will of
course be more. these are typical values; i have run a 2mbps link over a 6+ km
cable without any problem - this was iitm's first broadband connection some 5-6
years ago.

I have no practical exp playing with this sorta stuff but I will give my two cents.

Purity of copper is key and quality of terminations. Usually telephone cables are supposed to have 99.99999 % purity. And cable thickness is a mute point as telephone grade cables have constant thickness.

It is a simple very thin two wire cable. However theoretically at least transmission lines have infinite bandwidth and it is amazing that telephones lines so thin are able to give such a high bandwidth.

Signal loss as mentioned above, Shannon's information theory signal to noise ratio fundas and few other factors complicate calculations.

But since the last mile of most urban areas don't go beyond a few couple of kilometres at most and mostly AFAIK it is a ring topology. Logically it is a star with all lines ending on the exchange switch but I heard that physically it is some kind of a ring.

Anyway I guess BSNL will be able to meet the promise without much trouble in spite of all these factors...

Girish

two cents of speculation? why??

that would be called 7N copper and i believe any phone company that tries to use
such wire would go broke quite quickly. standard conductor grade copper is
99.45% copper, typical for power applications; communications applications could
use higer purity copper. but even audiophiles (freaks) might use 7N copper
cables in studio applications, not for telephone wire. cable thickness is not a
moot point; unless you have recently laid wire (laid in last 10 years), you may
find different thicknesses. current 'standard' telephone wire is 26 gauge or
0.4mm dia. even now, us telephone cos are reverting to the older 24 gauge 0.5mm
dia wires. 24 gauge wire can be approximately 50% longer than 26 gauge for the
same resistance. 20 year plus cables may even be 22 gauge. even if you have
fresh connection, part of the cable path will be old (or very old) wires and
possibly of different gauge. thats why we have the catch-all 'technical
feasibility'. incidentally, when iitm first wanted the 2mbps connection, the
telephone folks went by the cable distance they had on their charst and refused
it as technically not feasible. since we knew that much of the cable was decades
old, we figured it would actually work; a resistance measurement pointed the
same way and it took off from there. yeah, with old age comes the propensity for
telling stories ...

Good or bad, that's the current system. Feel free to attempt any 
changes. I for one, would love it if my university didn't worry about 
the industry when they form the curriculum; but sadly, that's how it is 
and we have to live with it.

Can't wait to attend your talk. However, from what knowledge I have of 
the industry (from the perspective of campus placement); I derive that 
none of the "biggies": IBM, Microsoft or Google make any assumptions for 
knowledge of GNU/Linux at the undergraduate level.

Your database lists companies that merely "use" FOSS. That's not what 
I'm really interested in; because even Microsoft uses a lot of GNU/Linux 
and has demands for people experienced in those fields. Google is no 
different that what Microsoft does; as in all their products are still 
proprietary. They might use a little more FOSS than Microsoft but that's 
where the dissimilarity ends. And in any case, none of the companies you 
list assume any prior knowledge of GNU/Linux (I have directly enquired 
with Infosys, Google, AMD, CTS, HP & IBM: all of these are visiting my 
campus this April). They will teach the recruits FOSS during training if 
you are assigned a job in that area.

What I'm really interested in is the list of companies that actually 
"produce" FOSS and thereby directly contributing to its growth. 
Companies like Red Hat and Deeproot Linux. However, I cannot, in good 
conscience; advise my peers to only take jobs in those companies, simply 
because they do not offer a payscale that can match any of the 
"biggies". Why must a B.Tech. student settle for anything less, when 
Microsoft is offering a salary of Rs. 12 lakh an annum?

> You are an exception for a person from NIT. I feel
> sorry for you.

Too personal a comment.

Let me reiterate that the thoughts I posted before are directly from the 
Director of our college; when we discussed implementing the course on 
FOSS with him. You don't need to convince me of the benefits of FOSS; 
but I am at a loss convincing my director and do believe that there is 
some truth in what he says.

Endorsing FOSS to its fullest will have drastic effects not only for the 
NIT's but also the IIT's given that there is a _lot_ interdependence 
between these institutions and the industry. Microsoft and Google offer 
the best intellectual challenges & paychecks a B. Tech. can ever dream 
of; and when they don't want you to know FOSS; why the extra effort?

I know, that's a typical Indian attitude; but that's how it is.

But, attempting to learn for your personal career with

I have no idea with whom you got such info from.
Google back-end is GNU/Linux.

Those whom you meet are the HR, who are non-technical.
They have no real idea what people do in the projects.
The HR always look for keywords in resumes, that is
all they can do.

I doubt if you have really interacted with engineering
teams. Unfortunately, as students in India, you are
not exposed to the engineering team. This is something
the GLUGs and FSUGs can help you with.

Do you really believe in so-called "HR training"? From
my experience, it sucks in India.

Those companies listed do contribute to FOSS in the
industry, by servicing clients - directly. Choosing to
release code is not in Indian companies' hands, it is
what clients' decide.

Money is not everything in life.

So-called Director? We know how management are in
Indian colleges, and they mostly care only about
money/fame.

Students in India have to think out-of-the-box, do
lateral thinking. You have to think of ways by which
you can learn when you are put in a restricted
environment, such as a college. How about using a
computer at home, or if the college provides few
computers, how can you utilize it to the maximum for
your needs.

FOSS community can guide you ... (1)

If it is your (the students') future, you have to work
for it.

> but I am at a loss convincing my director and do

> some truth in what he says.

Why do you have to depend on your college? See (1)
above. 
 
> of; and when they don't want you to know FOSS; why
> the extra effort?

That is wrong. Google uses FOSS. Their backend is
FOSS. 

They have primarily four divisions, Mountain view, CA,
US; Dublin, Ireland; Bangalore and Hyderabad, India.

> I know, that's a typical Indian attitude; but that's

That is what we are trying to change with the help of
FOSS and GLUGs in India :)

Thanks for all your feedback.

SK

Do you want Google to release their Search Engine Code ? What matters
is not the code, but how the ranking works. It(pagerank) is patented
by Google and you can easily get to know more about that by searching
for it (in Google)

Google supports FOSS and also releases many Open Source projects.
Take a look at http://code.google.com/projects.html

Google's Summer of Code program encourages students to develop for OSS
projects and also provide $4500. It was conducted for the past 2
years.

Already doing that. But having trouble convincing my peers ;)

It's backend may be GNU/Linux; but having FOSS skills when facing the 
interview doesn't seem to help in any visible manner. All they really 
care about is your CGPA. I am saying this because I have personally 
experienced it :(

> Those whom you meet are the HR, who are non-technical.

Unfortunately, they are the ones who decide whether you get the job or not!

Indeed, but try telling that to a 22 year old fresher when faced with 
the choice of whether to join M$ or RedHat!

Again, this is not for me; but for my peers. I've done my fair share of 
FOSS hacking. NRCFOSS & ilugd came to our college; but only about 10% of 
the students are really convinced about the advantages of FOSS and this 
is what saddens me.

> That is what we are trying to change with the help of

Let's hope we can make a difference for the coming generations!

No doubt that Google is more "FOSS-friendly" than MS. But that is not 
enough. FOSS will not be completely victorious until there is a 
billion-dollar MNC backing it. Red Hat and Novell are trying; it might 
be a while until they get there.

Google is also taking steps to open source some of its code (GWT for 
example); and there is a lot more it can do: Google Earth; Google Talk 
are all applications that are ripe candidates for FOSS based licensing.

Engineering teams?? What are these? Can ILugC explain? I'd like to
know. I am sorry if that sounds sarcastic, I mean it in good spirit.

College is restricted environments? Well, what can we talk about work
then? Isn't that the first thing that should change. Shouldn't
colleges be more open to learning new things?

I agree. I appreciate your efforts in this regard.
Somethings that can't be done at a student-level can
be addressed from an industry perspective, or another
approach. For example, through install-fests or
workshops.

The students that I have seen in India live in their
own shell. So, at that age with lack of real-world
exposure, they think that they know everything, and
they don't realize that. You are an exception because
you have had the exposure of FOSS, and you have been
working on it really well. 

So, there has to be a turning point for your peers.
But, when it happens, there is no looking back. Trust
me on this one.

That is a problem in India. Even though I was an MS,
and I had six years domain experience in Free
Software, (prior to starting work in India), the HR
called me a "fresher". WTF? But, I moved on. To me
work was more important, not designation. You know HR
are ignorant, and they will not understand anything
that you talk. So, why waste your energy.

The next best thing:

It's other way round - it would help defeat Black Hat SEOs because the
algorithm is open-source, and likely to be much more bullet-proof than
the closed-source ones. Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia is already
taking a shot at it:

http://mashable.com/2006/12/23/wikiasari-wikipedia-founder-launching-a-google-rival/

http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2006/12/wikiasari-open-search-engine.html

Perhaps not very surprisingly, Wikiasari uses Nutch and Lucene heavily.

Hi,

> The real technical folks in a company?
Amen. This raises an interesting question. How technical should the
technical folk in a company be? In my opinion, only as technical to
understand what the company is already producing. For everyone else,
the job is a lot less challenging especially if the idea of technical
expertise and engineering is not just understanding what is there but
try a hand at innovation and change. Companies are mostly never meant
to accept huge changes unless the market warrants one. Thats my
opinion.

That reminds of an interesting quote from one Hamming's lecture (or
speech). Toufeeq had written about it in his blog. To quote,
"The day your vision, what you think needs to be done, is bigger than
what you can do single-handedly, then you have to move toward
management. And the bigger the vision is, the farther in management
you have to go. You can't make it happen from the bottom very easily."

Nope. In the FOSS world, you never stop learning. If
you ever stop learning, you will become outdated, and
it will be very, very difficult to catch-up.

1. Tell us about your mouse type (PS2/USB/Serial).
2. Is it working in console mode?
3. Try to reconfig using 'system-config-mouse' command.

Thanks :-)

And just to add some relevant information. The site runs on a LAMP 
server. The web application Hackzor[1] uses Django[2].

Hackzor is a distributed Programming Contest Judge written in Python and 
Django. It uses a Client-Server Arch to improve scalability. (We expect 
thousands of ppl to be accessing the site on D-Day).

There's some nice code in Hackzor, good job. I couldn't help but ask: 
how does a client-server architecture improve scalability? Scalability 
over what other architecture?

Heh. I suppose what that means is that the uploaded contest entries
are passed onto a different box to compile/run against test
data/score, so that the main box is free to serve visitors.

Incidentally, the problems on the website are about very elementary
algorithms - I hope the main contest will be of a higher standard? For
example, see this one:

http://opc.kurukshetra.org.in/opc/problems/2/

Unless I'm missing something, all it takes is to sort the input
numbers in descending order (qsort(3)) and spit out elements 0, 1 & 2
of the resultant array?

You miss out something.. It can contain negative numbers. The product of two
negative numbers is positive. Imagine the sequence 2,5,1.4.9.2000,-1000,-2500.
Here ur algo would give 2000,9,5 as output. but what about the sequence
-2500,-1000,2000?

Interesting. Since it's marked OT anyways, can you explain what you mean
by "client-server arch" and how it would help you scale? Just curious...

I am guessing Binand's mail answered the main part of the question. The 
compilation, running and output checking is offloaded to distributed 
clients.

The part to be considered is this. The compilation+running (against test 
input)+checking output could constitute about 5-10 seconds of execution 
time. This would put an unnecessary strain on the webserver. *If* we 
reach the kind of load that we expect, then service could be really hit 
by having a single evaluator (or so we speculate). Having multiple 
clients evaluating the attempts in a distributed manner cleans up a lot 
of the mud :-)

apparently not as simple. You need to the maximum 3 elements and minimum 
2 elements under consideration :-).

But yes. We promise to have much harder problems on the day of the contest.

Part of the reason for allowing different languages (including 4th gen 
languages) is that we don't expect the users to derive much help from 
the libraries solving these questions. An irksome factor that you face 
in most Online Programming Contest environments such as MIPT[1], UVA[2], 
etc are that they dont allow for languages such as Python, etc. They 
restrict themselves to C, C++, and Java. The language often turns out to 
be a limiting factor on your creativity.

It will be a test of your brains.. believe me on that :-)

1.Split into positive and negative number arrarys
2.Sort both in ascending order
3.1st number from sorted positive numbers is always taken
4.product of n2*n3 from positive numbers array and n1*n2 from negative
numbers array is computued and which ever is greater those values are
taken.
in your example , 2000 wil be taken first , and since -1000*-2500 is greater
than 9*4 , -1000 and -2500 will be taken.

This is probably going way way OT. But, It would probably be more 
efficient to just sort the entire array in place (qsort?) without 
actually dividing 'em et al.

Nit picky as we are, you will also have to handle the clause where the 
number of input cases is less than 5 :-). The evaluator is running, you 
can code and try your luck at

Okie. Maybe I should be looking at the code instead of bugging you, but
I can't grok Python all that well, so how do you distribute your python
processes? Is there something for Python like drb in Ruby? Or multiple
webserver processes serving the results?
