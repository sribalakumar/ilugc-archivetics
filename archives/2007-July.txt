Hi,

I close my laptop's lid expecting either screen to be turned off or standby.
When I re-open the lid, the screen is blank. I have to restart
ubuntu/fedora. How do I fix this?

Thanks!

"man acpid"

Your laptop has to correctly implement suspend-to-RAM through ACPI for
it work. If it's correctly implemented, closing the lid will cause an ACPI
button event that you can use to initiate suspend-to-RAM, for instance,
by using a userland utility like acpitool. Likewise, you can exit from
the suspend-to-RAM mode either using a lid event, or by pressing the
power-on button.

If I remember right, Any distro with kernel 2.6.19 and above works
on it. Specific distros I have heard to work on this motherboard are:
Sabayon 3.3 and later
Ubuntu 7.04

I have a DG 965 RY motherboard, and I have managed to install the following
:
Suse 10.2 +
FC 6+
Ubuntu Feisty +
The above can be installed very normally as they natively support the DG 965
RY.


debian etch might work too.
the common error is about job control/tty being turned off.

I think mehul is probably right.

You will have a problem installing older versions of linux distros on your
computer. I have read that installing silicon drivers may help.

Note that this is only on x86 and not x86_64 or other architectures yet. 
There is substantial development that still needs to take place in 
drivers and architecture support before we can see good power management 
improvements. What is currently merged is a good first step.

Did you re-arrange your hard-disk to different slots? Any BIOS setting changes?

You can manually try to find, and setup the partition on the grub prompt.

And also check your hard disk once, if it's fine. Such errors
shouldn't just pop up unless some change was made.
Also, check for some unintentional change you may have
made.

I have tried to install java_ee_sdk_5_02. And i tried to run the binary of
it... but i failed for lack ( or something like that) of libstdc++.
Such type of error also occured when i went for firefox binary.

I googled for this and there i found that, i need to install libstdc++. But
i have already libstdc++6 installed.

So, what will i do now?

Error message:

And you didn't use any search engine for the above error message? I

I have managed to install Fedora Core 6. but in FC6 the marvel chipset
is not getting detected. So you need to create an iso image onto the HDD
& install from.

Still better use Fedora 7, it detect everything perfectly.

Message-ID: <200707030856.41978.shrini.engg@lucastvs.co.in>

Friends.

In our office, we are buying a new server.
We are developing web applications in LAMP.

we extensively use apache,php,postgresql.

To our server, we are ready to pay for support.

If I buy Redhat or Suse or Ubuntu LTS, what kinf of suport they give?

Installation supoort is not neded.

we need support for apache,php and postgresql.

we may need support for upgrading the the software whenever the updates and 
patches are released.
we may also need support on crash recovery.

Will the redhat,novell,ubuntu give these kind of support?

Any other companies in chennai or india giving support for our requirement?

Thanks.

HI,
As far as support contracts go RedHat is the way to go in INDIA. how ever  I
dont know if they support for postgrsql. contact RedHat india for further
details.

Ubuntu may be a great desk top  but i have not heard of its capabilities in
the server market .

Suse is pretty much the same as RedHat except i dont know their Presence and
suppport structure in India. we Use RedHat AS  v4 in our office  for  a lot
of our hosts with SAN. No Real problems

Hope this helps

regards
Raj

You just need to give those details in the networking setup, that is
system-config-network, if I remember right.

The posts are the mails I get.
All the reqs and eligibilites are mentioned in the posts itself.

Most of the companies need experienced persons.
But some recruit the students also if they have enough knowledge.

My request to students is apart from your studies,
get more experience and skill in a domain.

If you have enough knowledge, surely you can win jobs.

So, it was you. I wanted to transfer all my /recruits over the past
two years to your website, so any search engine could yield useful
results for knowing about companies working on FOSS. Unfortunately, I
had no contact person info at this site.

In future, when you make a website, put some contact info on the website.

You should also subscribe to IGLUG-Mumbai and ILUG-Delhi as they have
lot of job postings.

But, it is more complex and has some bugs.

Is there any other good CMS?

We [a software dev team] use  plone <http://www.plone.org> as our internal
content management system.  Easy to install and manage.  It runs on the Zope
Web Server.  Python scripts power it.

www.plone.org  - There is extensive documentation on it.

Thanks,
Jayan.

Yes.
Drupal gives some hope.

Where to get the themes?
I like the ubuntu.com theme.

I want such pleasent themes.

How about adding contents?
creating menus,categories, and sub categories, etc...

Is it easy?

Thanks.

yep...

One way is this,

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Templates

recently, a team has itself been formed in Launchpad for releasing and
maintaining Ubuntu Theme for drupal..

https://launchpad.net/loco-drupal/

version 5 has been released  :-)

Please note, this theme is for websites who have an official
relationship with Ubuntu or Canonical. If your site has no official
relationship (i.e. you're not a loco or official team website) then you
may use it as a base provided you change the graphic design so that your
website does not confuse people into thinking that you have an official
relationship. See the README.txt for more details.

need to put some time.. thats it..

Hi Shrinivasan

There will be someone for sure, but if you want to do it in a cost effective
fashion, you could subscribe to secunia.com to get all the security updates
for the opensource softwares that you use and other than that regular
backups and hard firewall configurations should be more than enough.

Thanks,Giri

Please go through installation options in the CD. In debian under
rescue option, grub can be reinstalled. I am sure ubutunu should have
such option. You can avoid total reinstall.

In Ubuntu, what you need to do is boot into the live CD, spawn a
shell, mount the drive where the Ubuntu / is present, chroot into it,
and run grub-install /dev/hda (or /dev/sda) and hope for the
best. Works most of the time.

HTH.

Why rewrite a CMS?
IMHO Drupal should be good enough for any general website.

most gateways charge a setup fee of about 30K and 5% per transaction. This

Hi,

Many CMS/Wiki softwares are easy to install and use. But during
recovery from a crash or moving from service provider to another, it
seems to be very difficult and it is a very important issue. So Plz
share that experience also here.

Bye :)

Few years back Dr.V.Venkataramanan wrote a set of articles about FOSS in
Tamil which were very good.  I hope he will have the PDF files with him. 
May be it is lying some where on his blog site
(http://domesticatedonion.net/tamil/).  Else just email him.

PS: He is also the author of the book

This is one reason why I moved back to HTML. I just don't have the
time to manage CMS websites.

There are many volunteers who already does this. I have been helping
the teachers myself and I have been part of teams who does this during
my college days.
NIT Calicut offers support and training for teachers in the Nadapuram
constituency of Kozhikode district.

See http://fci.wikia.com/wiki/Malappuram/Summer_Camp_April_2007
http://www.pravi.co.nr/2005/01/14/when-teachers-became-students/
http://www.pravi.co.nr/2005/06/08/it-at-school-palakkad-support-group-formation-my-first-talk/


FSF India and SPACE does support IT@School project.

As for commercial support there isn't any yet. But recently signed MoU
between Red Hat and Kerala Government does cover this.

"Red Hat will also train school teachers in Kerala on Linux desktop
skills under a "Train-the-Trainer" program."

- Selenium
- CruiseControl
- Capistrano, Deprec, Monit

passion for 'doing it right,' someone who wants to
make their mark building something extraordinary,
expand their expertise and demonstrate their
leadership abilities.  We're flexible about full-time
or part-time work and we care more about ability than
years of experience: this is a great opportunity for
someone looking for their first job as a tech. lead.

hi,
NRC-FOSS is planning to set up a portal to teach tamil - both written  
and spoken. We hope to eventually develop it as a full multimedia  
portal, but will start small with visual first, then add audio. A  
skeleton has been put up at

http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/OnlineTamil

if interested, either as a learner or as a teacher, please add your  
ideas and suggestions. Please contact me if you are interested in  
adding/developing content for the portal. Needless to say all  
development will be on the open source model.

Accha is nice:
http://accha.sourceforge.net/

Flashback is excellent for building vocabulary. No audio as of now.
http://freshmeat.net/projects/flashback/

Might want to look at InternetPolyglot as well:

I am interested in learning Tamil :)
some suggestions:
Instead of starting with Tamil alphabets ... I think its better to start
with some basic words ( especially needed ones)
Then some basic sentences which are in common usage( like how are you ? what
are you doing ? etc)
Then there can be some course on alphabets.
It can also include some pictorial representations so that people can grasp
the words easily.

PS: I dunno Tamil . I am looking forward to learn the language from this
wiki

This can come last in the learning phase.

Initially, learn:

* The alphabets, their pronounciation.
* Commonly used words/phrases/sentences.
* Be able to speak/converse basic sentences with a native speaker.
* Any grammar associate with the above (past/present/present
perfect/future tense).
* Build vocabulary.

One must be able to first learn to speak, comprehend, read, and
finally be able to write/type.

You can also have a look at the Pimsleur approach to learning a language.

They have plans to get this training program done. Umashankar asked me
to forward the volunteer list and I've forwarded it to him and the
Admin In-charge. The Admin department is going through the list and
scheduling the training program. So, if any of you are willing to
volunteer for this training program, please add your name in this page
now.

We'll let you know details about the program as we come to know from
the Elcot team. Thank you.

particularly  in chennai we have a segment which speaks, gossip is tamil
but unfortunately do not know to write in tamil.. and more worser is that
tamil is their mother tongue.. :-(

the first of very  few lessons  chennai taught me :-(

some one from that segment comes up to learn.. then.. keyboard should also
be taken care...

please do not say windows stupids. i disagree with this statement. when one
is better than the other, it doesnt mean that the downgraded one is stupid
or not good. i agree that u have passion of linux. it should be optimistic
in the way we tell people abt linux.

thanks to all who are responding on this thread. I request you all to  
put your suggestions on the wiki so they dont get lost.

We are planning to start with the alphabets and joining them.

1. Alphabet apears on screen. Click it and the sound comes.
2. Alphabet apears on screen. Click 4 sound symbols and choose the  
correct one
3. Sound is given on click - choose the alphabet
4. (difficult) alphabet is given - user speaks sound into the mic and  
correct/wrong is returned

Next stage, same thing for words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs.

I have never done anything with linux and sound (as i dont like  
music) so am looking for guidance on how to record the sounds and  
edit the sound files.

Audacity could be used with this regard. Just have someone who has a
good voice and the recording and editing part is half over.

Other half, maybe making the clips sound right, using normalizing and
stuff. I have heard that many podcasts use audacity for their editing
and fine-tuning.

hi all : thanks, especially to "amachu".

at the FOSS workshop at PSG, we had to quickly write out a para for
press release.
[Kenneth: I started with Suzhi, naturally. wanted a few more links to
be shown to participants.]

attn.: raman, bharathi, etc. :
when we go to college, let us keep a one para write up ready -- in
tamil and in english -- which could be suitable modified and used by
the college for release to press. Often, it helps to show the college
management, the announcement or the news item about the event in web
-- let us keep the calendar updated and announcements released in
nrcfosshelpline and ilug-c portals.

thanks, srinivasan.

Feisty, 2.6.20-15).

Now, wvdialconf doesn't seem to detect it after plugging it in (USB).

dmesg shows some message about /dev/ttyACM0 and /dev/ttyACM1.

Apparently, there no change in 'ls /dev/tty*' before and after plugging it in.

I'm kind of helpless, because I don't have access to either the
computer or the phone, and I'm sortof talking on phone with my brother
(who is not exactly a linux pro) who is trying to get this done... and
he doesn't have any other net access too.

If anybody knows any issues with this phone, and how to resolve it,
please let me know :) (Interestingly, googling doesn't give much hits
on this particular model).

Thanks,
--Arnold

if you use bluetooth. If you use a data cable more straightforward .. 
set the appropriate modem type and port (usb modem etc) in wvdial.conf

I feel 'GNU' should be written as '????' in Devanagari.

Be any distro, you can always download the sources and build.  I used to 
have a simple shell procedure to build GNOME, lost it somewhere now :(

Dear ILUGC,

Here's an interesting post on the debian-user list, which describes in
detail whether to submit Debian bugs to the Debian BTS or to
upstream. The same holds for Ubuntu. Makes a good read:

If you don't want to go the compile-from-source way, you have two
options.

1. Not recommended - upgrade to testing/unstable. This will bring in a
   whole set of new packages, but, along with them, many new bugs and
   breakages.
2. Look for it at backports.org. I doubt whether it'll be there now.

Do note that getting a fast moving and huge package set like GNOME in
Debian stable is very tough, given the number of library changes and
dependencies involved in the task. I'd rather settle with the existing
GNOME, unless I really have the time and enthusiasm to go through the
major compile+install procedure. I also would think about the other
Debian GNOME dependencies this might end up breaking.

Message-ID: <6ef305610707090107x2408773p9dc2b2fde8664f5e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.
 i am web running an application in php-linux-apache
  thru which user's is asked to give a  floder name and upload images to
that floder
  for example
  let say that i have a Floder name  " Magzine "
  and if the user type in the folder name as "firstweek"
 and uploads the images. the images will be uploaded to

  ../Magzine/firtweek/
                   /img
                   /thumb
                  /vedio

(i.e., the images will be uploaded in the corresponding floders
/Magzine/firstweek/img , /Magzine/firstweek/thumb and
/Magzine/firstweek/vedio)

now the problem is
1.the folder "firstweek" is created with the permission as 755 ,even though
i have set its parent directory's (Magzine) permision to 777

2.not able to create the sub folders  (img,thumb,vedio)

is this  something related to the User ,Group  section in the apache config
file..?


Thanks is advance

Making a directory world-writeable is dangerous.
Make the directory Magzine owned by the user that runs Apache and give 
755, that should be enough.

shell> sudo chown `grep '^User' /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf | awk 
'{ print $2 }'` /path/to/Magzine

Dear Suresh,

You have not been clear about whether the problem occurs with your
script, or whether the script runs without doing what it's intended
to. So, I draw my own conclusions about your problem.

I think you can read about PHP's umask and chmod.

> 2.not able to create the sub folders  (img,thumb,vedio)

And also read about PHP's mkdir.

I don't think so. I think you should rather see where PHP's not doing
what you want. Of course, it could also be a problem with Apache's
umask, but others may know more.

HTH.

Well, I wouldn't really do this for something as big as GNOME, since
many other packages which depend on the GNOME libs will also need to
be pinned (or will be upgraded). In that sense, many packages will
become the testing/unstable ones.

Anyway, if it suits you, you can go ahead and try it, albeit, with
caution, lest you end up breaking the system.

Yes, but shouldn't wvdialconf detect it? It doesn't seem to. KPPP is
"unable to open modem" when I chose the modem as /dev/ttyACM0, and try
to "Query Modem".  As I mentioned earlier, no device seems to be
created in /dev after plugging in through USB, what device can I
mention in wvdial.conf then?

I think the issue is with the permissions of the created directory,
you don't seem to be able to create new directories in the 'magzine'
directory, from what I understand.

As Gopalarathnam has mentioned, make the user who runs Apache the
owner of the directory. Or (unsafe) use chmod to modify the
permissions of the created directory.

Subject: [Ilugc] Experiences from your first patch submit ? how to make the

Message-ID: <3935b63b0707090218n6ba8562di197d17323feefda5@mail.gmail.com>

Fellow FOSS enthusiasts,

Although i do have a few projects of my own that are open source ,I admit
that i have not had the pleasure of contributing to projects that I do not
own. I think submitting a patch to an existing project is an experience in
itself.And one that I;d love to explore full time. I'd like to
segregate this post into 3 [chunks] of thought.

[1] I'm having a tough time figuring out which open source project to get
involved with that actually encourages new users to submit a patch. No
offence, but in the real world - i only wish i could identify the projects
that could use a helping hand among the ocean of projects - both abroad as
well as in india. Is there a list available , is there an irc channel for
the same ?

[2]To help me answer this question, I figured i would find out from other
users from thus UG - of their first open source project contribution
experience, and how the road to submitting your FIRST PATCH was .

[3] While you're at it , if you know of any open source project that could
use help right away ,do let me know  . I've just quit my job , to take a 10
month opensource stint to broaden my contributions apart from the work i
usually do - ( scripting / javascript ) . I have a project of my own over at
returnable.org , authored the reusable javascript library, and blog on
http://bosky101.blogspot.com . I'd love to work on porting some of the
concepts from event driven programming in javascript and actionscript to
more other/native languages. Possibly even embedded ones.

Any suggestions / experiences shared will be appreciated ,and I hope you
take this mail as a hacker who wants to contribute to existing projects as
much as he wants to create ones on his own 8 )

My first patch was one character fix.(Memory dereferencing problem, 
which causes crashes unfortunately not reproducible easily in any OS 
other than NetWare and hence 2 weeks to convince people for one 
character!!!).

Subversion(http://subversion.tigris.org) is a project I am involved with 
for the past year and a half, where one can find lots of opportunities 
to contribute.

create a new user and use jhbuild .. I think you will be easily able to do
it ...check www.jamesh.id.au/software/*jhbuild*/
If you prefer a simple way use Garnome check out

go to google summer of code site - there are about a 100 projects  
there. Choose some that interest you - look at their ideas page,  
select some ideas that have not been taken up, work on them. You can  
be sure that good work will be accepted. By good work, I mean not  
only good code, but code that fits in with the coding standards/ 
guidelines laid down by the project. And include lots and lots of  
tests and documentation.

how to protect the directories with passwords which should be aprt from the sytem's root password which means that even in the absence of sysadmin (the environment in which sys admin is supposed to leave the password while on leave) whoever logs in to the system should not be able to gain the access to the directories which are protected with different passwords.

hi,
for our tamil learning project, we were experimenting with recording  
sounds. We were using krec with an ordinary headset and the onboard  
sound card - the recording is extremely faint even using full volume  
on everything. What is the reason for this? Will this improve if we  
get a full-fledged soundcard? Or better mike? I am able to hear  
sounds clearly over the headset. If a full-fledged soundcard is  
needed, can anyone recommend a good linux compatible one available in  
chennai - same for headset and mike.

I'd just suggest moving your desktop to ubuntu / fc6 etc if you want the
latest and greatest versions of stuff like gnome.

Debian stable is just that - rock solid stable, but not necessarily
bleeding edge, it is several generations behind the latest versions, by
design.. so doesnt really make a good desktop if you want the latest
versions of stuff.

I do not think anyone will spend time in a dedicated channel meant to
mentor new contributors for all open source projects.

That depends on project you choose and exposure you already have. If
it is a core development team, it may take time to understand the
process and start contributing patches. But, if it is art work,
documentation or translation team, it is very easy to understand the
process and start contributing patches.

In any case, I highly recommend to subscribe to appropriate mailing
list and be a silent spectator for couple of weeks. You should
understand their process and get used to the way to send patches.

Every organized project may have patch submission guidelines. Please
do not bother to read them before starting to submit patches. First
impression is the best impression. The core developers are more
concerned about the way you send your email. Your email speaks more
than your patch itself.

I'm very sure there is a need for quality contributors in every
project. You will get to know once you understand the processes and
roadmap. The core developers will be friendly and responsive depending
on the confidence you make.

Personally, I've been associated with Ubuntu Documentation team (UDT)
and Subversion. As per UDT is concerned, it is easy to submit patches.
The developers are very friendly. They encourage new comers, even
though they make mistakes. They will explain you howto contribute
patches and things like politely, even though there are so many wiki
pages to answer these type of queries.

As per Subversion is concerned, it is one of highly respected
community. You should observe the dev list for couple of days/weeks.
Once you get to know where you can contribute, you can start
submitting patches. I bet you will find lot of ways to contribute once
you are used to it.

BTW, these are not rules for contributing to open source projects, but
few suggestions based on my experience. These suggestions are not
applicable for thousands of inactive/small open source projects lying
around community sites like sourceforge.net website.

Good luck!

Folks,
          As the title says, linux-2.6.22 has been released today. You
can pick it up from the usual kernel.org mirrors - it hadn't propagated
to the IIT-M mirror as of an hour ago.

    I'm testing the tickless kernel - and I can confirm that there is
no perceptible difference/slowdown in desktop responsivity. You can
leave it configured to tickless by default. The next thing to check is
whether xine/mplayer run as smoothly with a tickless kernel.

Not sure about the audio input path under Linux, but there are a variety
of inexpensive linux-supported soundcards available locally - usually
with an ESS Solo1, Crystal CS46xx or Yamaha chipset. Any of these
should be OK.

I know these people are desperately looking for help. This is a ERP
product in Python written by some german programmers. They had contacted
me a while back, but I haven't been able to pay it much attention because
my work load is tight. They are active on berlios.de.

I am using W 700i with data cable for transferring files.
It is not detected by the system.
I have to mount it " mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /media/usb"

My first contributions did not start out with a patch but by translating 
software and writing documentation. The disproportional focus on coding 
frequently misses out other in numerous ways to contribute to a project.

we dont do push mirroring but sync up nightly only on account of bandwidth 
availability considerations. so, most new content will show up after one local

I moved to lenny/testing a while back and now enjoying gnome 2.18 and
whole lot of new apps. I suggest you try testing if it is not a
critical server.

One thing, you will have to keep updating stuff but if you want latest
and greatest it is the best way. Since there is a set of requirements
for packages to move from testing it is sufficiently stable for a
desktop machine.

Just marking it stable won't make it stable right?. Does Ubuntu/Fedora
have the strict checks similar to testing requirements? Some
requirements for a package to move from unstable to testing are

1) no critical bugs during the packages time in unstable (10, 5, 2
depending on priority)
2) All dependencies already in testing
3) buildable on all the supported architectures

It took a while for gnome 2.18 to move to testing because there was
still bugs to be fixed.

Praveen

I have an old machine (celeron 433MHz, 256 Ram) in office, I want to set it
up in my home for following apps..

- Browse Net (predominantly)
- Check Email
- View Office docs (Open office in other words)
- Play games (simple puzzle games, for my kid and wife)

So keeping in with the old processor and only 256MB Ram, which flavor should
I use or what kinda of config should I setup.

Yep, service provider Airtel. I connect via another phone(k750i) on
another computer via Airtel on a regular basis, so it seems to be an
issue specific to the k510i model (or perhaps, bad diagnostic
information provided to me by my brother, but I think that is
unlikely:) ).

Thanks,

I had a similar problem, then found that there is an option called
"Mic Boost" in the Mixer. (Kmix), After enabling Mic Boost, the sound
was good.

The derivation of the name MySQL is not clear. Mysql base directory and a
large number of our libraries and tools have had the prefix "my" for well
over 10 years. However, co-founder Monty Widenius's daughter is also named
My. Which of the two gave its name to MySQL is still a mystery, even for us.

The name of the MySQL Dolphin (our logo) is "Sakila,"

Interesting...

we welcome you to share anu funny information like this..

Message-ID: <214062.51268.qm@web54502.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi
 
I am having  a computers running Windows XP/Mandrake Linux 10.0, dual-booting with GRUB. I tried a live CD of Ubuntu 7.4, and it is working fine. I would like to install ubuntu instead of Mandrake in my system. 
 
Can I install ubuntu 7.4 over Mandrake partition without uninstalling it? Should I delete the mandrake partition for installing ubuntu? While installing ubuntu, if I choose the mandrake partition, I think the ubuntu installer will reformat the partition and proceed the installation. Kindly clarify will there be any problem with MBR/Grub installation.

Hello,

Even if you choose to format your mandriva, ubuntu should take care of the
windows chain loader and will let you do things as usual as before.

Hi,

I am facing issues with "always_bcc" option in the postfix
configuration(version 2.2.10). I need the copy of all the emails to a
particular email account which is the reason why i have used the always_bcc
option. Now i am getting mails for non-existing email accounts to the
always_bcc account first and then discarded saying mail account not exist.

I need these mails to get discarded even without deliveriing to the
always_bcc account. Please let me know of any work around for this.

Regards,

Linus Torvalds Speaks: Have You Something To Ask?
http://efytimes.com/efytimes/fullnewsxml.asp?edid=20212

Here is a chance for you to submit your questions. The two broad
topics that we would like to discuss with Linus are:

1. The technology road map of Linux (especially the kernel)
2. The role Indian techies can play in developing Linux and open source

So, if you have questions for Linus, feel free to ask. The detailed
interview will be published in LFY and subsequently released as a
'creative commons' document, since it will be a true community-driven
initiative. The deadline to submit questions is 13 July 2007.

Bye :)

Hi All,

Anybody having a 2 page write-up about "Why FOSS need to be used in
Education?". This write-up can be used to give "Small intro about FOSS
and How it can help in education" to Institute Head, Principals and
Headmasters. And this can be used to get permission for conducting a
small workshop/demo day in a school/college.

Suppose, if we don't have one, We can create a wiki page for this
write-up.

Bye :)

Hi All,

I want to share my recent experience. One application binary file size
was changed suddenly by 500KB. Initially we thought, it may be due to
some virus.

But this size change was happened due to the prelink. During prelink
process, the some lib infos are added into the binary file, just to
reduce the startup time. Get more info from:

man prelink OR http://people.redhat.com/jakub/prelink.pdf

If you know anyother conditions, which will leads to the executable
file size change, Plz share with us.

Bye :)

Bharathi we did observe such behaviours. We compared the size of object
files generated at different compilations (code unchanged) and found that
some objects differred in size. We used the 'ls' command to check for the
size.
The same objects if we compared using the 'size' command we found that the
object files we of the same size. All fields we the same.

Message-ID: <20070711145521.GA3301@ee.iitm.ac.in>

Dear ILUGC,

I plan to give my cousin the Ubuntu Feisty DVD for installing and
offline use. Since it is intended to be mostly for offline use, we
won't have internet access. So, I am going to fetch some packages he
needs on a USB stick or CD.

I wanted to know which are the packages (debs) which are sufficient to
ensure that proprietary format video and audio can be played on Feisty
(including MP3, MPEG/AVI videos etc.).

Thank you.

Install Feisty locally on your machine, use synaptic to download the
packages you need on your machine. Verify that everything is working, then
use APTonCD (http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/) to burn the downloaded
packages to a CD and give it to your cousin. Will work like a charm.

Message-ID: <200707120904.50059.shrini.engg@lucastvs.co.in>

Friends.

I have a lot of photos to be converted into dvd video.

I found that dvd-slideshow,dir2slideshow,dvd-menu tools are the tools i have 
to use.

Great.

But, There tools only give the fadein effects only as default.

There are some other effects like slidein, slideout, kenburn.
but we have to set the effects manually for each photo.
we have to specify the effect name in the configuration file manually.

As I have more than 500 photos, it is very difficult to tell them manually.

How to make random effects in dvd-slideshow?

Thanks.

internal modem not having drivers for linux?

 If you looked in the article, the three things that
interested me was the cost 20k, the os (linux) and
rebate given(2500). So even after taxes, notebook
would cost less than 20k and that sounded cool...
 But not too sure that they would stoop to such levels
as giving a buyer hardware that he cant use with the
loaded OS.

I tried to create an username for me and it worked without any email 
confirmation. May be that is the start. Fix the user creation with some

Lock it down so that

1. Only the admin can create users
2. Only the users can create or edit content

Then purge the spam users and any edits by them

this will kill the wiki - there are lakhs and lakhs of wikis which  
allow anonymous posting without much trouble - examples:  
code.djangoproject.com, nrcfosshelpline.in/code/ and even wikipedia  
allows users to register themselves. If this attitude is followed,  
the safest way to keep the wiki unspammed is to keep it offline ;-)  
Ilug bom uses media wiki, allows registration and is not spammed.

But sadly, Acer doesn't think so. In the Business page of today's
Hindu, the Acer ad about the laptop clearly says something to the
effect of "the Linux installed is a free version and has limited
functionality till another operating system is intalled." Isn't it
horrible?

Hi,

I am not familiar with office applications on GNU/Linux.

I have a friend in an NGO who wants to migrate to GNU/Linux.

However their main concern is Excel. They are worried that they might
not be able
To handle all the intricasies in GNU/Linux as the do with M$.

They want to actually migrate 1 PC to gnu/linux move all their data on
that PC 

Checkout if it really works and migrate all other systems.

Anyone in Bangalore who can help out on this or has prior experience.

Senthil

Install OpenOffice on their Windows desktops, ask them to play with it for
some time and plan for the migration.

they were spammed - they disabled user registrations - wiki  
practically died as no one was willing to contact the sysops - then  
we made a big noise - then they allowed user registration - now wiki  
is flourishing. I dont know how they keep spam down, but they do. As  
mentioned before, akismet is highly effective - I dont know how  
'free' it is ...

Something from the Dell Ubuntu page...
"For advanced users and tech enthusiasts, we?re happy
to offer a new open-source operating system"

Things do change, and I am still enthusiastic about
the cost at which one can get an Acer :)

If they are in this list or any other FOSS list in India, and if they
knew about FOSS, and if they actually _did_ employ few of the FOSS
enthusiasts in India, we could probably ship a good distribution for
their hardware, and provide good technical support.

I am not sure if they are aware of FOSS in the first place. It is
always important to think out of the box.

This is something Dell did well with Ubuntu.

On ILUG-BOM wiki some people do edit/delete the spam
entries/pages, besides if there's other mechanisms I am not
aware of it. Spam is there no doubt about it, but it can be tracked
quite easily via Recent Changes page and edited, if it's a page then
we need to contact the people who have the powers to delete
pages.

You could use the image authentication thing used by lot of sites
instead of user registration. Anybody wanting to edit can be shown the
image to confirm that it isn't automatic spamming. I don't think it
will be much irritating to the user. What do you think?

Maybe useful (if not you could probably help me to solve it:) ): Do
you use Gmail interface for chatting?
For some reason, when Gmail makes the beep sound when a message comes,
firefox locks the audio for itself until it (firefox) is restarted.

Captcha - particularly the simpler variants - can be easily bruteforced
and is expensive (CPU / processor wise) to implement

The other alternative is a huge bunch of volunteer editors willing to
spend time watching for and reverting spam edits.

If you can find out just how many users outside of ilugc you actually
have editing the wiki?  If you take the whole of the ilugc userbase and
generate a login / pass for each of them, you have a good start and can
lock down the wiki, no worries.  Any new member of ilugc automatically
gets wiki posting rights as well.

Does it have something to do with owner/group settings on dsp. Many
times I have seen it being left at the last user who used it.

Make sure your local uid is in the "audio" group. And that esd / alsa
etc is running fine.

Plus a more recent version of Mediawiki might be required... say > 1.5.x . I
guess the version that is used by ilug  Chennai is 1.3.x ?

Another way is making use of built-in anti-spam feature of media wiki:
$wgSpamRegex
It helped in keeping off spam in a wiki i maintain. I got info from this
link:

http://wiki.evernex.com/index.php?title=Blocking_Spam_in_Mediawiki

Hope this helps.

My discontent is not with the Linux distribution on that laptop, but
how apathetic the company is in their attitude towards the
distribution. In fact, doesn't this amount to abetting piracy
indirectly?

Anyway, if someone does manage to get such a laptop and mages to get
everything working, I would request that person to educate Acer about
how nicely things work in the "less functional Linux OS" they are talking
about (what is it anyway?).

If there are FOSS aware people in that company, they'd better get in
touch with their ad-makers fast, so that they don't miss out on
adamant GNU/Linux fans who take offence to statements like "less
functional OS".

I agree. Though I haven't yet seen a Dell+Ubuntu system, the website
was very encouraging and professional.

I have news for you - acer knows all this. A couple of years back a  
friend bought two fairly high-end acer laptops with latest suse on it  
- fully functional.

 open alsamixer as root and try to play with capture controls. Maybe
your mic is mapped to wrong alsa channel. Newer alsa drivers have this
problem. Also, try with line in. Check if line in is working properly.

My last laptop (~3 yrs back) was an acer travelmate 290.

Worked just fine with linux and still runs ubuntu .. when I bought it,
the dealer simply says "wait, I will load a pirated windows XP on it for
you, this linux is just being bundled on it like they bundle ms dos on
cheaper PCs .. because PCs have to ship with some kind of an OS on them"

I still remember his face when I told him I was going to install linux
on it ..

GLUG-BOM wiki is spammed, though it may not stay-in
for a longer period. 

I would recommend users to tick the "Watch this page"
and select an option to email, when those pages are
changed. In this way, each maintains a set of pages,
and spam, if any, is removed almost immediately.

My situation (for my desktop, I can't afford a laptop yet!) was a
little different. The dealer finished assembling the components, every
one I had specified, since I knew it would work with GNU/Linux
out-of-the-box. Then, I told him to hand it over. But he insisted that
he install that "other" OS. When I told him I didn't need it, he said
he needed to do it to test whether all hardware is working!

Once he was satisfied with his assembled system working, I promptly
had it formatted.

Could these (dealer) be told about GNU/LInux? Could
they think of installing distros and giving it to
users who demand them? (with the help of ILUG-C?)

At least in my case, those customers who really wanted GNU/Linux were
competent enough to install it themselves. So, I really don't know
whether convincing dealers would really be possible, though I wouldn't
discourage it... I really feel the customer is boss, and it is
_his/her_ demand which should make dealers take the GNU/Linux route.

I can proudly claim that I have been installing fully functional
Ubuntu Linux on all the computers assembled from my company. It used
to take us a lot more effort in getting some aspects working than it
would have if we had tried "other OSes". We have gained a lot of
experience since we started out. Things are so smooth these days that
we install Ubuntu to test the hardware even if the customer insists
that he/she will be installing some "other OS" after purchase. It is a
pity that 95% of the customers go home and install this other OS. We
normally try our best to convince the user that the Linux is going to
be fully functional for all their normal uses (except gaming) and that
piracy is plain illegal.
One problem that we are facing here is the lack of good community
support. We have been finding it very hard to find people good at
Linux. We are planning to contribute our efforts into building a
vibrant Linux community in Trivandrum by offering the services of the
to-be Linux Evangelist (we are still looking for that position) for
the community.

Kudos to you for your efforts. Even if you don't have a high success
rate, the fact that you actively educate buyers about the software and
advantages of Ubuntu, you are doing a great service to the community.

I had suggested long time back to ilugc that we hold a dealer  
training workshop - price it high enough to attract dealers and hold  
it in a star hotel. NRC-FOSS is willing to do the organising part if  
the lug supplies the manpower - any profit made would be available  
for lug activities. The trick is to price it properly (free workshop,  
no one will take seriously) - and teach attractive things like  
networking, firewalls as well as the basics

And the one thing Windows users envy about linux users
is its virus free nature, something that can used as a

linux also has viruses - in fact linus recently released a patch when  
he found a virus was not working in linux due to a bug in the kernel.  
After the patch, it worked. On the serious side, the strength of  
linux at present is in networking and server side services - and more  
and more dealers are having to configure this. It is becoming big  
money for them. So a properly set up and conducted workshop, with  
proper publicity and limit to number of participants will definitely  
sell.

I am also a KDE fan, and I do do some recordings some times.

If I do not get the mic working, the following are the things that I
check for generally
1. pidof artsd  | xargs kill -- Some times artsd puts a lock on the
sound device. Kill those processes. These will be started again for
each of processes that use the sound system.
2. Open KMix and check the INPUT tab.
        - Make sure the RED Led at the bottom of the MICROPHONE icon
is ON and the MIC has sufficient volume. If you have the Green LED on,
you will hear your own voice on the speaker, which is not suitable for
voice recording.
       - Make sure the CAPTURE has the LED on and also has sufficient volume
       - In the switches tab, make sure you have chosen the right
microphone device and MIC  BOOST LED is ON.

TIP: Personally, I felt Audacity to be better than Krec in terms of
flexibility. In Audacity, you will have to select the driver and the
recording(input device) explicitly.

Nvidia, unless you don't like using proprietory drivers.
ATI isn't well supported at all.
Get a NVidia 7 series card, whichever falls within your budget, or maybe
8 series too. Specially if you use windows, too as 8 series are DirectX 10
compatible.

Never, ever, limit the number of participants for any workshop. Put an
entry fee if you want to.

I hope NRC-FOSS, and ILUG-C can commit, and do this workshop. Here are
the details:

* The Ritchie street vendors are part of many associations of which,
the Information Technology Traders' Welfare Association (ITTA) is most
prominent.

* The prominent board members are:
Moolchand of Mahavir Multimedia, mmm at airtelbroadband.in.
Rakesh of Supreme Computers, rakesh at supremeindia.com.

* I am not sure if you can contact these folks directly. But, I shall
give my Ritchie street vendor contact, who is ready to work with
NRC-FOSS, ILUG-C. He can coordinate with the above associations and
committees and put your workshop requests/requirements to the
association. He should join this mailing list soon. His contact
details are:

Think you need to stop it from playing either using another button or
timing it.

This example shows something to stop the sound using js,

Forgot to mention:
Sometimes the artsd created by Konsole blocks dsp. To overcome this problem try

Konsole -> Settings -> Configure Notifications -> disable all sounds

This will stop giving sounds when you are hitting too many back spaces
in KONSOLE. This has been my major reason behind the locking of dsp at
least on my PC.

Just to add, In my box artsd was an evil d(a)emon locking up my audio. I
couldnt run two multimedia applications at the same time. Right now I am
pretty much happy without any artsd support in my box, System sounds
doesnt play but I could always some external program to do that.
You could also get rid of this annoying problem by selecting ALSA as the
default Sound framework from kcontrol. Works like a charm.

Hardly...
trust me, I've been a MS Windows user all along and I take good care of 
the system by all means. Never been much worried about viruses... partly 
because I have a decent anti-virus software provided by my company.

Recently got a Ad-Ware from some where and my anti-virus software didn't 
even come close enough finding it.. I installed Spy Doctor that comes 
with Google pack and it cleaned it right away...

This virus-free-nature thingy won't work much as long as there are good 
anti-virus software for MS Windows (there are some promising ones to 
keep the MS Windows folks from worrying for now). IMHO, we should press 
on the fact of how free Linux is and all that stuff one can get done by it.

Well, I still use ALSA. I get problems only once in a while, that too
while recording through Audacity/ Krec. Skype works without any
problems with JUK and AMAROK playing around along with GMail
sounds.....

this reminds me of persian feasts. in order to *really* enjoy the  
food and eat as much as possible, the guests at a persian dinner  
periodically go outside, stick a finger down their throats and vomit  
out all they have eaten. actually, in a cockeyed way, what you say  
makes sense - why worry about being run over by traffic - we have  
excellent hospitals and even better insurance companies. Why bother  
about drinking unboiled water - antibiotics are available on every  
street corner. I have a diabetic friend - he eats all the sweets he  
wants - just shoots in a little extra insulin before eating.

micorsoft writes anti-virus? I thought they had an agreement with the  
antivirus companies to provide source code to virus writers to keep  
the anti-virus guys in business.

Makes sense.
Prevention is better than the cure but I have no idea where the Persian 
feasts come close to this.

My point is that, even in a not so secured OS like Windows, if you know 
how to maintain the system you can very well keep the viruses away 
without much fuss. Adding to this there are some good anti-virus 
software available for Windows.

The virus-free nature of Linux wouldn't impress the serious MS Windows 
users much.

Ramesh,

I suspect your partition is sda1 instead of sda. That was the reason the
initial mount failed. How many partitions did you have on the HD?

have been using Etch for a long time. A very nasty problem is showing from
some days. Etch never starts normally now. It gets stuck when "checking
journal...." comes. What i need to is.. run * fsck /dev/hda3* all the time.
Then it ( Etch ) starts. My root is in hda3. Another thing is, sometimes
computer hanks at running time and reboot automatically.
I reinstalled Etch but the problem exists yet!!

What i am gonna do?

Message-ID: <dae53550707152335k58085039n23f4c310600e8a9b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
       How does a TUN / TAP device work when more than one TUN / TAP
device is created in the kernel using "tunctl" command.?

        If the application opens the only one character
file(/dev/net/tun) for reading and writing, how the multiple
interfaces in the kernel can write / read into the same character
device?

For example consider, I have created tap0, tap1 interfaces in the
kernel using tunctl command.

But in application we can open only the /dev/net/tun file to read the
packets written by kernel.

Kernel experts please reply to this.....


Thanks

I hope, after creating the i/f, the TUNSETIFF ioctl will link the i/f
with fd. Just try. I am using only one tun device in my app & never
tried with multiple devices.

You can always run memtest for RAM.
Not sure of the solution for checking hard disks.

Subject: [Ilugc] MP3 + Patent issues in Debian
Message-ID: <20070717042402.GC7589@localhost>

Dear ILUGC,

During the last ILUGC meet, it was pointed out that Debian GNU/Linux
has media players which play MP3s out-of-the-box, without additional
codecs. I was wondering why this was so, given that Fedora and Ubuntu
don't allow this.

The reason seems to be because playing (decoding) MP3s by end-users
doesn't seem to warrant any license from the patent owner. See:

http://www.webcitation.org/5MeUrGbFN

This was pointed out to me on debian-user by Carl Fink:

Oh, and by the way, if it isn't clear, every other multimedia format
needs codecs, none of which are Debian. www.debian-multimedia.org
exists for this purpose.

Hi,
My backup harddisk connected as primary-slave failed. When i boot linux from
primary-master harddisk, it keeps trying to get information about the
damaged disk, after so many seek errors, it gave up. When i issued
'fdisk -l' command it shows the damaged hard disk as /dev/hdb & capacity as
40GB. It is unable to show the partitions present in the disk. Can anyone
suggest me a FREE hard-disk recovery software?
thanks - sripriyan

ld is unable to find the libperl.so. Try to give the exact path of 
libperl.so using -L option.

You simply run like this

perl myprogram.pl 

or

after granting executable permission and putting #!/usr/bin/perl as

./myprogram.pl

Normally perl programs are interprated by the perl interpreter on the
fly. The term compilation is also valid some condition. Plz read the
man pages of perlintro, perlcc, and perlembed to more clear idea.

Subject: Symposium on copyleft revolution in a conference on  critical geography

Dear friends,

I proposed a symposium on copyleft revolution to this conference to be
held in Mumbai at TISS from 3rd till 7th of Dec 2007.

http://www.5thiccg.org/

Those of you want to speak in the symposium, please submit your
proposals before the end of 20th August 2007.  The shape of the
session will be confirmed by 3rd of September 2007.  The symposium
will accommodate about five speakers on the panel, and the total
duration including at least half-an-hour discussion will be about 2
hours.

Copyleft Revolution

In the last thirty years the role and significance of Information and
Communication Technology have grown significantly, reconfiguring the
spatial logic of modern society. However, it has not remained an
equally accessed base and gone under the control of a few global
corporations that are investing billions of dollars for its
modernisation, impacting the process of knowledge construction and
dissemination for a small section of the society and thereby
transforming other fields of human creativity.  As a response to the
above hegemonistic framework, a parallel cultural and political
movement is under way that is growing at an unprecedented pace and
influencing the way how science, software and other kinds of symbolic
forms are created, published and distributed.  Popularly known as the
Copyleft culture, it is essentially a Free Software Movement that took
off by an innovative use of the existing copyright and by publishing
software under a copyleft license.  This license is meant to give four
fundamental rights to the user of the software published under the
copyleft license: to use it for any purpose, to understand how it
works, to make modifications, and to distribute the modifications.

One of the major outcomes of this revolution is the GNU/Linux
operating system (popularly known by its misnomer, Linux). The
copyleft movement is currently transforming other fields of human
creativity as well---science, poetry, music, cinema and other symbolic
forms. Of these, the most popular success story is Wikipedia.org, the
largest multilingual encyclopedia of the world. There are other, not
yet fully fructified, movements such as public library of science,
open access, creative commons, open music, etc.

The proposed session aims at generating awareness about the Copyleft
movement in general, and discussing its relation to science and
education in particular. While challenging the patent and other
similar systems, it also intends to deliberate on a new model of
development of ICT, centered around collaboration and sharing among
different communities.

Hi Guys,

Can anyone give me set of URL's or tutorials to create a new build which we
like to include our own jboss apps and give it to the customer.

I think we need to create  a installation script for this, if yes, can we
have details for that as well.

Regards

Ramesh

Hi Sam ,

The entire open source culture is based on sharing, so it would not be
appropriate to ask such questions in this mailing list. you may seek help
else where.

How about an open-sourcish solution? Use GPG, and encrypt it with the
public key of the only person who you would allow to open the PDF. :-)

And I do understand that PDF has some support for this kind of
password protection, but that is strictly OT for this list (and I
don't know how to use it as well).

Since you like sharing, for a start, please share your credit card
information with us :)

Personally, I think the OPs question is quite valid, and doesn't seem OT.

@sam: maybe mcrypt is a simple solution for what you're looking for,
I'm not sure how secure it is though.

awk '$1 ~ /[1-9][0-9]*G/ { print $0 }' mailstorage.txt

should work.

I think there's an "Accounts" menu option in Tools (I don't recall
exact menu item). You can change your settings there.

IANAL but note that a FAQ is not considered a legal document and the FAQ 
does not really answer whether a Free software decoder requires a patent 
license or not.  You need a written explicit agreement from the patent 
holder according to GPLv2 section 7.  The real answer is probably that 
Debian is not a commercial entity and is unlikely to sued and even if 
sued the consequences are a court injunction to stop distribution and 
not monetary liability.

Debian itself might be a non commercial activity but use in commercial 
contexts would void that argument.

Wow. Impressive. Kudos to the obviously painstaking production effort 
that went into making the video. I was one of the doubters a while back 
about how serious ELCOT was about the migration. Happy to be proven 
wrong :). Wonder why some of the credit was not shared with ilugc? If 
I'm not wrong, there are quite a few luggers who assisted them with 
their decision-making, right?

Yeah, few of us assisted them at times. But he may have got certain
things done which he expected from us. Perhaps, it was due to luggers
availability of time and other commitments. Infact, I talked to him
about the support offered by Ilugc members, but I think he's less
convinced.

Overall, his idea was to showcase employee's contribution and
recognize their efforts. Remember most of them are windows users, new
to linux. Now imagine the kind of difficulty and resistance they had
while migrating to linux. Their opinion about this success is very
important than any one else.

I hope he have mentioned about Novell's contribution to this effort.
I'm yet to view the final draft posted at Youtube, as the site is
prohibited to visit from IIT - Mumbai.  But, I'll take a look at it as
early as possible.

FWIW, ELCOT is the topmost client for Novell with more than 40,000
SuSE desktops. They surpassed Fujifilm which is using 8000 SuSE
desktops. Now, Novell have appointed a residential engineer at ELCOT
for providing corporate support. Infact, Novell is also planning to
recruit more enthusiastic free software developers (even freshers) to
provide support for ELCOT from their premise.

awk '$1 ~ /[1-9][0-9]*G/ { print $0 }' mailstorage.txt
should work.

Given the input (mailstorage.txt):

shell> cat mailstorage.txt
140K /abcde/fghij/w001/wesley
26M /mnopq/rstuvwx/w001/wilson
1G /mnopq/rstuvwx/w001/alok
2G /mnopq/rstuvwx/w001/john

The following is the output I get with GNU awk on RHEL 4.4:

shell> awk '$1 ~ /[1-9][0-9]*G/ { print $0 }' mailstorage.txt
1G /mnopq/rstuvwx/w001/alok
2G /mnopq/rstuvwx/w001/john

The following is the output I get with nawk on FreeBSD 4.11:

shell> nawk '$1 ~ /[1-9][0-9]*G/ { print $0 }' mailstorage.txt
1G /mnopq/rstuvwx/w001/alok
2G /mnopq/rstuvwx/w001/john

Is your input in the above format?  If yes, what awk is your system 
running and what is the output?

Yes.

Get to the basics?

Any work/code that you do is your copyright. License determines how
you distribute copies of your work/code.

Stealing a document that prohibits its re-distribution is against
copyright law, and is copyright infringement.

You can use PGP/GPG to encrypt documents and send it. It is security.
Nothing wrong with it.

> and now i asked you about

This is illegal. Because, you are stealing someone else's copyrighted
work that doesn't allow free distribution.

Welcome to the real world!

You might want to be more polite in future, and cut down your tone a
bit especially when you are going through a learning curve.

This is really hard to be cool all the time... .... i am not machine .... i
am a human being. And another thing is... i am really confused from your
policy. I think, here in ilugc group you are winding up many things because
of your *policy*.

Simultaneously i mailed to Standford Linux user group about my *password

I see a space in between [1-9] and [0-9], which is incorrect.

It should be:
awk '$1 ~ /[1-9][0-9]*G/ { print $0 }' /root/mailstorage.txt

Shanu has shared the tip. Thanks for sharing this.

Dont remember much offhand - but it was something as below:

- Copy out the bootable floppy images for each OS to the iso
- Create a isolinux which reference the bootable floppy images
- Pass kernel load arguements to use ramdisk as the root FS
- Copy out all the installation packages to the iso preserving the
 layout.
- build images using mkisofs
- Use qemu to test the iso image
- Burn when happy

Dear Gopal Venkatesan
Indeed, I am very thankful to you. As it is started working after removing the gap between [ ] and [ ]. But meanwhile, I also have found a solution with another way of scripting a command script like
cat mailstorage.txt | grep G  >> output.txt for the same solution.
this also helped me but indeed i am very thankful to you for your timely help.

But in your case you cannot have the directory (alternatively username
) name containing character G . The best method is to use awk as said
earlier.

In furture if you have the file content like the below, then you will
get into trouble

mailstorage.txt
===========

140K /abcde/fghij/w001/Ganesh
26M /mnopq/rstuvwx/w001/wilson
1G /mnopq/rstuvwx/w001/alok
2G /mnopq/rstuvwx/w001/john

so use right methods to get the content

Even if you can't read the links, you could figure out what it is
about by reading the mail content in Tamil, right?

I thought the sites will open if you click on the links and most
browsers show a different color and mouse pointer for links.

And you can already register websites in Tamil.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name

I can give you an example of Malayalam ??????.com

Please ask shuttleworth to register a domain name ??????????????.com
so that you can read the links also. I don't think there is a plan to
change .com also to unicode :-(

I think all Intel chipsets are supported in ubuntu. I installed ubuntu
7.04 on an Intel 946G board today. The card was detected and installed
during startup. However when in re-ran dpkg-reconfigure on
xserver-xorg it failed to detect the card and reverted to a VESA
driver. I then had to manually edit the xorg.conf to change back to
the intel driver. Perhaps you should check your xorg.conf file to see
if the right driver has been loaded. If the driver has not been
installed you can install it with
sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel

Are you trying to bait us? Trolling?

Please get this clear. People in this group have differing views about
various issues related to software, such as software patents. But one
thing everyone will agree on is to be ethical and respect laws.

Even if the action you intend doing doesn't break a law, most people
find it unethical. So, if you find that someone else gives you a
better answer, good for you.

Oops. It seems like the proprietary VPN client provided by Cisco
systems. Why dont you try "vpnc" it works like a charm in
Ubuntu/Debian/RedHat/*. All you need to do is this:

Configuring VPN Client in GNU/Linux

Step 1: Install vpnc in your GNU/Linux box. You need not restart the
machine after installing vpnc :)

For FC* users:

# sudo yum install vpnc

For Ubuntu/Debian users:

# sudo apt-get install vpnc

Step 2: Create a configuration file /etc/vpnc/myvpnc.conf with
the following content.

IPSec gateway 214.x.x.x
IPSec ID MyCompany
IPSec secret xxxxxxxx
Xauth username yourusername
Xauth password yourpassword

The last two lines is optional if you want to give the
username/password each time you want to login to the VPN then remove
the last two lines.

Step 3: Start the VPN client using the following command.

# vpnc /etc/vpnc/myvpnc.conf

Step 4: To disconnect the client

# vpnc-disconnect

If you have any trouble in installing vpnc, you can try obtaining the
source package from http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/vpnc/ and try
compiling the source.

Message-ID: <d5deb2390707190244x563225acve32325586b0dd875@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

   DHCP server listens on port 67 for lease requests. But why the DHCP
client also should use the designated port 68 to interact with the server.
Is it to make the job of firewall admistrators easy, as most of the DHCP
traffic is broadcast. Or is there any other reason for that.

1. Because it follows RFC 2131:
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2131.html

2. It is mandatory to follow standards.

So, if you move to a different network and if they use DHCP, you know
it will be running on the same port, rather than you having to go ask
someone about it.

I understand why the server uses standard port 67. But whats the need
for the server to send the response to the port 68 of client ? In a
typical client server communication, client can initiate the request
from any of its port and server responds back on the same port. Please
see the below link

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCP#DHCP_and_firewalls

I am of the opinion that RFC never says anything to be mandatory.
Please correct me if I am wrong.

Because you may have a firewall on the server that allows UDP only for
certain ports?

True.

Good! You are doing your homework.

There is your answer.

> I am of the opinion that RFC never says anything to be mandatory.

RFCs start off as proposals, and then IETF approves them as standards:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_comments

But, it is important to follow Free/Open standards, because it is a
standard, and everyone can follow it.

thanks Anoop,

I download xserver-xorg-video-intel_1.9.94-1ubuntu3_i386.deb from
http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/download.pl?arch=i386&file=pool%2Funiverse%2Fx%2Fxserver-xorg-video-intel%2Fxserver-xorg-video-intel_1.9.94-1ubuntu3_i386.deb&md5sum=e56b797a572218ec5c98aaa30c48c802&arch=i386&type=main
and then installed

# dpkg -i xserver-xorg-video-intel_1.9.94-lubuntu3_i386.deb

after installation GUI mode was not working, the CLI mode worked fine
and then i changed default depth from 16 to 24 in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
and got the GUI screen.

Screen resolution was 800x600 and then I changed to  1280x800. Now i
am working fine in both CLI and GUI modes.

But everytime when I boot my computer I have to press ctrl+Alt+F1 to
see what is happening in the background, if I don?t press ctrl+Alt+F1
the monitor remain blank (black screen) and takes long time to boot.

Kindly tell me is there any resolution for this problem.

Once again i thank you for help.

Thanks,

Init1 = ATZ
SlowControl = Hardware (CRTSCTS)
[Dialer Defaults]
Username = Internet

Phone = #777
Stupid Mode = 1
Inherits = Modem0

Then when I am trying to dial 

# wvdial
--> WvDial: Internet dialer version 1.54.0
--> Cannot get information for serial port.
--> Initializing modem.
--> Sending: ATZ
ATZ
OK
--> Modem initialized.

The GNU/Linux partition still exists. Just that windoze bootloader got
installed to the MBR without even asking your permission.

> Please give some suggestion to reload Grub without reinstalling XP;

Why do you need to reinstall xp to reload grub? Just restore grub to
MBR. For a start:

Hi,
     Windows should be installed FIRST then Linux (Fedora, SuSE,
RedHAT..etc).
     As per my knowledge / experience
     Bcoz. windows boot loader does not support linux booting.
     But linux bootloader(GRUB, LILO) - its supporting windows booting
through GRUB, LILO. while installing linux it will add automatically winwos
into bootloader. if require u can edit grub.conf  as per your windows
partition.

note: if you want load linux, u can use linux bootable CD.

This is the guide if you are using ubuntu. But should work for other
distros as well with a little figuring out....
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows?action=show&redirect=RecoverGrub


Basic steps are ,
1.  Boot from the live cd/recovery cd
2. check which partition is your linux root , mount root
3.  mount /boot if you have a separate partition.
4. finally reinstall grub   , here is the example of the command that i
would use if my linux root is mounted on /mnt/root and  my hard disk
device is  /dev/hda
grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/root /dev/hda


for more details, check out the help page.

Thanks, However there is a way around to it. 
Insert Linux DVD/CD, select fresh installation it will ask for repair GRUB, edit grub.conf, then u can exit the installation process and enjoy u'r XP or Linux without reinstalling XP and LInux.

"This is a CGI script which ..."

So, you need to spawn the script as a CGI script.

A cursory glance at the package's file list reveals something:
http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?searchmode=filelist&word=w3c-markup-validator&version=stable&arch=all

Notice the following:
/usr/lib/cgi-bin/check

So, you must have a web server (apache2) running, and all you do is visit
http://localhost/cgi-bin/check

and you should get the check page. Also, if you had URLs (URIs)
pointing to the W3C Validator's web address, you can change them to
the above localhost/cgi-bin/check, and they should work.

HTH.

+1 and great to see such movements. A problem in circulating the video
would be the "founder of OSS Concept" thingi :D. But, rest is pretty
good and my appreciations to Mr. Umashankar and his entire team.

Go to tty1 by pressing ctrl + alt + F1, login there and type
sudo /dev/input/mouse or /dev/mouse.
It could also be mice or mouse0 or some such instead of
mouse. There could be more than one, you may need to try
many of them.
Does it show some junk characters? If it does then mouse
is detected by the OS but problem is with X configuration.
Do you have windows? Does the mouse work under
windows?
What make of mouse it is?

Hi All,

You might have heard that there was a Free and Open Source Software 
conference in Gujarat(Ahmedabad) on 13th to 15th July, 2007.

It was really great, so many FOSS enthusiastic people had contributed by 
talks, presentations and as volunteers. If you missed that conference, 
don't worry you can still get the essence from some presentations which 
are available on the site.

http://oss-conference.in/Speakers

In a few days, all the talks and photos will also be available on the site.

Hi,

Sivanandhan is right. You have to boot with noacpi option.

I suggest you to try debian
http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/4.0_r0/amd64/

You will get the packages recompiled for your amd64.

Regards,
Jos Collin.

Hi,

thanks to  all. I did google search for the problem. Mandriva forum
has suggested to do a bios update available for this motherboard. I
did that & it has solved the problem

Ahem - please be careful about who you speak for - I am a supporter of  
foss, but not for the reasons he subscribes to. I'm guessing there are 
others who would say the same :)

remember, neither is he convinced with "free" though he should have coined 
it...

there are valid reasons... fine.. find a word that can replace open & free 
together ;-)

may be "Ubuntu" ;-) (the word i mean)

that can solve the problem... but increases the complexity of finding suitable 
vocabulary...

Thanks brother. But it would be nice for us if the topic of presentation was
just beside of the name of speaker. It would be easy for us to know, who
covered which topic.

In a few days, all the talks and photos will also be available on the site.


It will be nice.

To: bdlug@yahoogroups.com

  Penguins, start your engines. If you watch the Indianapolis 500 on TV this
Sunday, look closely at blue No. 77 car and you might see a penguin running
at more than 250 mph.

Two enthusiasts have taken it upon themselves to make Linux a household name
by organizing a grassroots effort called Tux 500. It is aimed at raising
money to help sponsor an Indianpolis 500 race car operated by Chastain
Motorsports.

i dont agree with *all* of his opinions, but still I give him his due  
as the founder. And, although he argues vehemently that the OSS point  
of view is mistaken, wrong, disasterous etc, he still is sensible  
enough concede that most OSS licenses are gpl compliant ...

Most OSS licenses are Free software, not necessarily GPL compatible.

Hi All,

Here is some feed back we collected about the event last week.
 
cheers
Senthil
 
Good Job!!!
--------------
 
1) The free software event was really useful. In fact, I got to know the
origin of free software and the correct meaning "free" software only
after attending the event.
 
The pot-luck was always really good, particularly the chicken dish. :-) 
 
Most importantly, I met many people at the session and exchange of ideas
was great.
    --Sayeed
 
2)Congratulations! on organising such a great event..
I think the presentation was fabulous. It was very well made and was put
across in a a way where it made an impact.
 
Meeting up to exchange ideas and finding out what people are upto is a
good idea.
 
Was great to be a part of the event..
 
 ---Ashwini
 
1) Thanks to all others who organised the event. For me it was a great
exposure. Even getting soemthing as basic as -free as in freedom and not
free as in freebies is what FS means was very exciting. 
 
2) Yes, we have switched one computer at office to Ubuntu already,
thanks to the session and Ashish's high energy levels. Hopefully Balaji
will be able to make it to office on Saturday and we can figure out an
equivalent for SPSS and how to work smoothly on open office spreadsheet
also and then our transition would be complete. 
 
The film and presentation were quite good!
 

Thanks 
Best 
kamayani 
 
Need to improve
-----------------
3) 
I felt people were still apprehensive about various applications running
on Linux. Lot of time went in trying to convince that such (e.g.: Baraha
kind of
documentation) things (i.e, not the Baraha tool as such) are indeed
available. 
It would have been easy if you just showed how to it. When there is a
specific query, better demonstrate right away, if possible. For example,
it was so simple to demonstrate the USB stick works.
In summary, come prepared to run few applications and interface device
access.  These are the fundamental things that people expect in a demo
like this.
 
The presentation was useful to me.
 
 -Ravi A
>> point taken ! will show kannada stuff nex time
 
Well being honest i thought the pre-lunch half was really good, but the
next was more of a techie session and left us non-techies out. Maybe
dividing into groups would be a good idea. One computer or laptop per
group kind of a thing.

Hi 

Iam trying to install mandirva on my wife's Presario 2500 laptop, I have
downloaded the iso and burned it on my CD, its booting fine in my Dell D630
but refusing to boot-up on presario laptop. But on the same laptop XP cd is
booting fine. None of the other OS like freedos(which I tried) etc is
booting. 

The presario 2500 came with a mandrak 9.1 cd's which is booting fine. But I
want to install the latest mandriva.

So its quite confusing. 

Can anyone help on why the latest ISO's are not booting in laptop, while the
older ones are working fine.

Regards

Ramesh

And which version of Ubuntu? I used to have a similar problem with a
logitech serial mouse on an older computer with older distros (<Etch,
Dapper, I don't know whether the newer ones detect it). It used to
wrongly detect my mouse as PS/2.

One option is to install using the Alternate Install CD, and then
manually modify /etc/X11/xorg.conf to use the correct mouse device (I
think /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyS1 depending on which serial port) and
protocol. It may be possible to do this using a Live CD too - perhaps
going to Ctrl+Alt+F1 and modifying /etc/X11/xorg.conf and restarting
X...

You can use OpenOffice, but, for writing technical articles, I always
recommend LaTeX:

SK,

Thanks a lot for the documentation on USB. I read through bits of it..
documentation like this is sorely needed. Very highly detailed.

One point - may be good to include some of this documentation as HTML as
it allows for search engines to index them better.. Something in a Wiki
style or like in the PHP help pages would be even better... so that people
can contribute sample source code snippets and the like against specific
sections.

Thanks again,
PK

Yeah. Bits and bytes, and a lot of them too.

I wanted something that:

- I could use as a presentation for technical talks.
- Can be read offline, and doesn't depend on Internet connectivity/bandwidth.

> Something in a Wiki
> style or like in the PHP help pages would be even better... so that people

- doesn't depend on PHP-database connectivity, else, I have to manage
it or ask someone to do that for me (and I don't have time for that).

I have released it under GNU Free Documentation License, and anyone is
welcome to use the template.

In fact, one can even do similar presentations for say, networking
packets. A good documentation project for final year students.

If you are using a serial mouse on a computer with
ps/2 mouse socket .most live CDs will not detect the
serial mouse , as the ps/2 socket will be detected and
mouse will get mounted there.Some live CDs might not
even start.
Solution is to get a ps/2 mouse or serial to ps/2
adapter,the former is easier to get.

Hi,
I am using debian (etch).
My system clock is always running so fast. i have to set the time as per my watch daily in my morning and again my system time is ahead of the real time..

I wrote a simple script that logs the time after every half-an-hour. finally i stopped it around evening 4:50.

[sathyz@sathyz-deb:tmp,14:06]
>>>./logTime.sh
[sathyz@sathyz-deb:tmp,19:06]
>>>

the script is as follows ,

logTime()
{
date >> time.log
sleep $1
logTime $1
}

logTime '30m'

the time.log shows,

check your cmos battery

and do a simple apt-get install ntpdate

stdtime.gov.hk is a reasonable time server to use.

but i have one more doubt,
when i ran the validation using this i got the following result

       Failed validation, 78 errors

but on using the firefox add-on as specified by one of the luggies

from http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/ and gave the algorithm as SGML parser.

i am getting  12 errors.

moreover  the errors doesn't seem to overlap too..

which  one should i rely upon??

I would *always* rely on the W3C HTML validator, sicne it's the simple
reason that it's the very test you have to pass to be compliant. Also,
some errors are shown twice by the validator, in that if you fix one
problem, your number of errors usually reduces by two or three.

All the best!

Neither the DVD or Live images would have the complete set of packages

Not even close. Several Free software licenses themselves are not GPL 
compatible.

ok, you got answers, but the other answers on the list are not quite complete. 
procite (not prosite) is really a bibliography management tool, something that 
is used in addition to the basic writing tool for your dissertation. 
openoffice would be a writing tool but it does not have great bibliography 
management tools. latex would be a good choice for you to do the basic writing 
and bibtex will then do the bibliography (like procite). unless you have a 
large number of citations which are culled from an even larger bibliography 
source or are using search engines to find your bibliography material, it may 
be easier to avoid bibtex altogether - simply extract all the biblio material 
and cut and paste them into latex files.

This is quite bad in my opinion, what about users who don't have both
good bandwidth and DVD drive? There are many such people around.
Is something like apt-on-cd around for Fedora? Then this move does
make a bit more sense.

To be more explicit, Fedora never included all the packages in the 
repository even in previous releases. What you had was "Fedora Core" in 
the media while "Fedora Extras" was only available in the repository. 
The merge of these two repositories amounts to around 8000 packages in 
around 9 GB. That would nearly a dozen CD's with a number of obscure 
packages. Still, the above FAQ does link to atleast one retail vendor 
who offers such a pack.

HI
 
I have intalled Adhiyan a Firefox/Thunderbird extension (http://www.higopi.com/adhiyan/) for reading TSCII/TUNE/TAB/TAM content without installing the required fonts. It was working fine for few days. I was able to read online kumudam and vikatan using firefox. When I try it today it displays only junk characters instead of Tamil. I have followed the instruction mentioned in the page. Any clues?

Hi Satheesh,

If it is just having tomcat on your machine, have the tomcat binary tar ball
and untar it and you are all set

http://apache.oregonstate.edu/tomcat/tomcat-5/v5.5.23/bin/apache-tomcat-5.5.23.tar.gz
Hope you have java1.5 installed and have the JAVA_HOME set :)

I was able to install it correctly on lenny. I have upgraded to lenny
so I can't try it on etch. Can someone else try if you can install it
on your machine?

Sometimes the problems on Linux with Java is because of how most
distributions have gcj installed.. and /usr/bin/java and /usr/bin/javac
are using that.

When you install Sun JDK on your linux machine, a good idea would be to
rename the /usr/bin/java symlink to something like /usr/bin/java_gcj and
you could rename /usr/bin/javac to /usr/bin/javac_gcj.

You could then set the path of the Sun JDK into your default system path.
Also, please do set the JAVA_HOME setting to point to the directory where
your JRE or the JDK are installed.

That should fix the problem with your tomcat install.

By the way, someone had asked the question about Swing not working on
Linux. This will solve that problem too.

Message-ID: <89ef002c0707240910m365ee377r9df42ff18fdaf149@mail.gmail.com>

While loading the Some of my web application the tomcat server always fails
in the first load and the error message says BadGateway. But in the second
load it works fine since the data is retrieved from the cache.
So my understanding is, When the application response time exceeds more than
certain time period than server response time period threshold limit server
throws an Badgateway exception.


If anybody has an idea to resolve this kindly share with me.( I want to load
the page when the server started in the first load i dont want to refresh it
again)



thanks

I am not sure I understand your query completely, but I ve had tomcat
respond after one or two minutes without  a bad gateway error. Are you
using some kind of connector (apache-tomcat) to load your application?
Did you change the server.xml for any optimizations?

Alfresco is an Enterprise Content Management system. There is subtle
difference between normal CMS like drupal and Alfresco. The primary
use of Alfresco is to manage documents, work flow, etc in an
organization. Recently they have introduced Web Content Management.
But if the OP is looking for a lightweight CMS to just manage a
website, then Alfresco is not the right choice.

First of all, I think it isn't Firefox 5. You _must_ have got the
version wrong.

As for the Flash plugin, you can get it at Adobe's website:

If I'm correct I think you guys did not understand his request. He wants
Shockwave player which is completely different from Flash player.
Bruce Mathew,
Shockwave player is not yet supported on Linux. You will have to install
WINE, Windows Firefox and Shockwave player/plugin to get it work under
Linux.

what problem are you facing? All you need to do is create a  
dictionary (hash) with correspondence of the TAM/TAB coding to the  
unicode coding and run a substitution

Subject: [Ilugc] Server at work most probably compromised,
	need suggestions for what to do next
Message-ID: <3b15edbe0707250515m40b97842ib63c740f3c63ae13@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

A box at work which acts as a subversion server has most probably been
compromised /rooted.

I'll try to mention below how and why I have come to that conclusion.
It's a bit long so please bear with me. I hope to get suggestions from
ilugc about how to gather more evidence if necessary, and what to do
going forward.

The box in question runs Fedora Core 6 and has subversion and apache2
installed on it. Developers access the subversion repository through
http. Everything is behind a firewall of course. I'm not sure of all
the details because I'm not an administrator.

What I do know is that there is one external consultant who also has
access rights to the subversion repository and often works from remote
locations. To enable him to access the repository from outside,
changes were made to the firewall to grant access to the standard http
ports on the subversion box. Access to other ports was not granted, as
far as I knew.

Yesterday evening a problem was first noticed when someone had to
login as root on the server and could not because the password had
changed. Nobody knew who had done this. The password was reset by
rebooting, going into the grub menu, making the server boot in single
user mode, then resetting.

After that a look at /root/.bash_history showed that somebody while
logged in as root had changed the root password, and then created two
ordinary users with the same uid and gid as root, i.e 0, plus one user
with an ordinary uid and gid.

This looked to me like a clear sign that the box had been rooted.

Looking through /var/log/secure* showed that from about midnight on
Jul 18 there were many attempts to bruteforce usernames and passwords
to get ssh access. This was surprising because although sshd was
running on the box, I thought the firewall was not forwarding any
requests to it.

>From the timestamps of the failed ssh login attempts it looks like
some kind of script was running each time, because there were many
failed attempts from the same IP address just 3 - 4 seconds apart.

Finally between 7:43 and 7:45 hrs on July 19th there were two
successful ssh logins as root.  This too was surprising because I
thought root login was not permitted by default in ssh. However 'man
sshd_config' says that the default value of 'PermitRootLogin' is
'yes'.

About 15 minutes after the successful root login there is a successful
login with the same username as one of those 'special' usernames with
uid and gid 0 mentioned earlier.

Looking in the home dir of these new users showed executables with
strange names that don't seem legitimate.

On trying to find out why it was that ssh on this server was visible
to the outside world, this is what seems to have transpired:
Initially, the subversion server was not accessible from outside the
firewall. At some point, when it had to be made accessible, an
external IP address was assigned to the server, along with it's
internal private IP address. The server has only one NIC, and the
administrators could not make it have 2 addresses at once.

Instead what they did was setup a rule on the firewall, such that if
requests for the assigned external IP on the http ports came to the
firewall, they were just forwarded to the internal IP address of the
server.

At some point due to physical relocation of the server from one office
to another, the assigned external IP had to be changed. When this was
done the consultant could no longer access the subversion repository.
The problem was somewhat strange in that if one used a browser to try
to connect to the repository, one was prompted for the subversion
password and could then browse the repository, but connecting with the
commandline 'svn' client would fail with a message about 'PROPFIND'
request failed.

Finally, as a last resort all 65K+ ports were opened up, i.e.. any
requests on the new external IP on any port were allowed through. This
solved the subversion access problem, but at a cost. Now ssh requests
on this address were passed through too.

Looking at /var/log/secure* shows that the time for the first failed
connection attempt to ssh corresponds roughly with the time all ports
were opened up.

ssh being accessible from the outside world, combined with the default
setting permitting root login, combined with a trivially easy password
resulted in the box being compromised, or so it seems to me.

I have saved copies of everything under /var/log, root's .bash_history
plus everything in the homedirs of the users created by the intruder.
I also did an rpm -V on all installed rpms. I didn't notice any
altered system binaries, but lots of config file changes. These could
well be legitimate changes made internally, I see no way to tell. I
also searched for all files owned by these new users, but that
returned what seem to be false positives because these users have the
same uid and gid as root.

I also searched for setgid and setuid files in the /home directory. I
didn't find any setuid files, but in backups of the subversion
repository, I find that in each copy the dirs db, db/transactions,
db/revs and db/revprops are all setgid. I don't know if this is
legitimate or not.

Thank you if you have read this far. My detective work, such as it is,
is based on the following articles in linuxjournal that I read a long
time back:
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5348
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5347
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5346
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5345
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5344
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5343

I am not a sysadmin, yet I found myself in the strange position of
doing all this figuring out and telling others including the admins
here what I've found.

Anyway, now for my questions:
What else is there that could be done to investigate how much damage
has been done?
What else should be saved as evidence?
I assume the box will have to be rebuilt, so how can one be sure which
if any of the  backups of the subversion repository are trustworthy ?
I think that perhaps using dd to take an image of the whole disk might
be useful for forensic purposes, is there another better way to do
that?
Should one report this incident to CERT-In or CERT or is it not worth
the trouble?

I haven't pasted any of the log files I based my conclusions on in
this mail. Should I paste them on pastebin.com or something like that
for the list to see?
 Should I just grep and paste what I think is relevant out of the log
files etc or paste them whole?
What about legit usernames and other data that probably should not be
made public?

Thanks for reading this far. I really need help with this problem.

Yes. And congratulations for doing the forensics you have done so far.

The most likely cause does seem to be an ssh dictionary attack based on
what you describe here.

You can blame RMS for this :)  Typical unix implementations allow su to
root only from users in the 'wheel' group. This was not implemented in
the GNU version as RMS didnt like the idea. That philosophy seems to
have carried on to ssh logins as root as well.

Try ssh to root on a freebsd box and it just won't let you do that.

Well, the guy rootkitted you, installed some random malware that is
either sending out spam, or carrying out ddos attacks, or hosting an
ircbot to coordinate such stuff .. or maybe a dns and web server for a
spammer's porn and pill sites

Dont trust anything on the box. Especially after the date when all the
ports were opened up.  I am reasonably sure you made backups of that svn
repository?  Rebuild the box from scratch. Restore from backup.

And make sure that firewall policies are not tampered with just because
one developer wants to access svn remotely from home. Set up an ssh
gateway on a separate IP, that he can ssh to (with a key) and setup an
ssh tunnel to the subversion box from there.

http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2004-03/1145.shtml

Tortoisessh has a svn tunnel mode too, if I'm not wrong.

It is a group of DoT babus. Sure, they are supposed to investigate it,
and I would be interested to see what they do with the stuff you hand
them .. so go ahead and send them an image if you like.

Also., making sshd listen on a non-standard port avoids scripted
shh attacks to an extent. Most of the dumb scripts will only check
the standard-ssh-port. Seeing that your standard-ssh-port is not
open they'll move on to the next machine they can find.

Also using iptables to block incoming connections on the machine
itself makes it less reliant on another firewall box's
configuration.

Use iptables by all means - to restrict external access to certain ports
to a gateway IP. And allow ssh tunnels from that gateway IP, key based.

I use an OpenOffice document with tables. A table with columns for
Monday-Sunday, and the rows having the days. All tasks are entered in
the day in which they should be accomplished. They can be spread
across days. I use three colours for the tasks:
- Red: High priority
- Blue: Medium priority
- Black: Low priority

It works for me. YMMV.

Funny thing though - it's likely that the intrusion would never have been
detected if the intruder had not changed the root password. I for one
do not run fam or tripwire or any such stuff, and would not have noticed
anything suspicious until I started running out of disk space or
something.

You probably would if you started seeing your IP getting blacklisted for
emitting spam, reverse ddosed by somebody who thinks you are ddosing him
(which can happen if your box once rooted gets used as ammunition in a
skript kiddy war), etc etc.

As many have said, I'd:
1. rebuild the m/c.
2. separate svn from ssh gateway.
3. make ssh login key based and disable password based login. What I'd 
done was to have key based OpenVPN tunnels and route between subnets for 
external access. Thus only UDP ports for OpenVPN were forwarded. This 
enabled us run ssh on std ports for the LAN and not open it up to the 
external world.
4. If http access was for svn access, that also could have been secured 
using htpasswd. Every hurdle you add decreases chances of /root 
exponentially. Helps to be paranoid.

Preferable if you set up another machine and move this offline for 
further analysis. Impressed with what you collected not being the 
sysadmin. Normal sysadmin activity in our co included checking messages, 
syslog and wtmp/last everyday to check overnight activity. Apart from 
other things, sysadmin must check critical files everyday. Glancing 
thro' itself will throw up unusual activity.

Believe me, there are other ways of noticing intrusions. At one time,
I used to have a VA-Linux PC running RH6.2 and was regularly
connecting to the net using an earthlink dialup account. A cracker got
into the system using a weakly secured account (the ftp user, iirc) -
I noticed some rather strange, but friendly messages on xconsole, and
it took me a while to realize that it was not ET. :-D

If you mean reading file names in the archive, you can use this command:

$ tar tvf file.tar.gz

or, if you mean reading content of specific files, you can store
filenames (one file name with full path per line) to extract in a
seperate file, extract-list.txt and run following command:

$ tar zxvf file.tar.gz -T extract-list.txt

I don't know what you mean by "at last", since Intel has a few open
source projects already. OpenCV[1] imediately comes to my mind.

If you really do write such text files, do have a look at AsciiDoc[1],
since it provides a wonderful way to process and generate otuput from
such files.

Mainting your logs in text files has advantages. You can use grep, cut,
sort, sed, awk etc on your text file and perform cool formatings.
By the way if you are looking for a To-Do list i would suggest this site.
www.rmilk.com
Really cool site for maintaing your todo list and you can get reminders in
your email or mobile.
Also collabrates with google calendar.

IANAL but RHEL software is under Free and open source licenses and the 
complete source code is available at 
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/enterprise/.

There are two non-software packages, anaconda-images and redhat-logos 
that have trademark restrictions.

If you are looking for compression you can perhaps use gzip, and then
use zcat to do what you intend to.
$ gzip largefile

Many many thanks to everyone to who has replied so far with their
suggestions for what to do and for sharing their own experiences.

I've forwarded all these emails to my boss, who'll be ensuring that
something along the lines of the suggestions given so far is carried
out.

Please do mention anything else that comes to mind, and anybody else
with something to add who hasn't done it so far, please chime in. The
more inputs there are, the better the chances of the right thing being
done at work.

> Preferable if you set up another machine and move this offline for

I was thinking along similar lines.
Set up another box, set the repository up using the last good backup,
and for the compromised box, take if offline, hook up another disk of
same or bigger size and take an image with dd. Make sure the network
config is done right this time for the new box. Something like that?
Also, see if CERT-In does anything with the disk image.

Well, that's a whole different can of worms. :( You've put your finger
on a sore spot allright. I'm not sure it should be discussed here.
Maybe offline and in person, assuming I meet people who've posted to
this thread at the next ILUGC meet or something. Or atleast not on the
list, but via private mail. If anybody is interested I'll open to
doing either.

Today I upgraded 3 systems from opensuse 10.1 to 10.1.Menu launcher in KDE
is good,but the default main menu launcher in GNOME was not that user
friendly.For people who want to change it:-
Go to panel and right click on it.Click on "Add to panel"-> "Traditional
Main menu" to get the old drop down menu instead of the defaut "computer"
that appears default in SUSE.

One more problem in ALL the 3 computers was in the menu.lst file which is
present in /boot/grub. Windows entry was "chainloader (hd0,1)+1" change it
to "chainloader +1" to boot into windows.

Switch to Linux!

GNU/Linux, or simply Linux, is an alternative to Microsoft Windows. It
is easy to use and gives more freedom to users. Anyone can install it:
Linux is free as in freedom, and often available free of charge.

I disagree. This isn't the USP of GNU/Linux. GNU/Linux is a complete
system, userland+kernel with a _wide_ variety of applications (from a
distribution perspective).

> is easy to use and gives more freedom to users. Anyone can install it:

I am "mixed" on this. It is tough to install GNU/Linux, at least the
first time, with frightening keywords like logical partition,
/dev/hda5, boot loader on Master boot record etc. Sounds much tougher
than "C drive", "D drive" etc.

> Linux is free as in freedom, and often available free of charge.

I agree. No doubt about this! :-)

Anyway, the website maintainer has presented his or her views, and I
don't fully agree with it. But as such the content of the website is
lucid and clear, and is worth recommending.

Umm, the website aims to introduce newbies, who are
likely to have Microsoft Windows installed currently
on their computers. Therefore, the statement may
immediately catch the attention of visitors.

Hello everyone,
      I am trying to find methods to reuse the old PC`s. One of the solution
I found out was to use LTSP(Thin clients).I was able to use one Pentuim P4
as my server and two Pentium3 computers as thin clients.I did the setup few
months back with Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and it is working fine. Details about LTSP
can be found at www.ltsp.org.

Is there any other method/software that can be used to "reuse" the old
computers?

What about just using some lightweight distro like DSL, Puppy?
They hardly take up any hard disk space or RAM, they can be
easily used for lightweight work.
Or just use it as some kind of a server, which won't require too
much processing power. If slackware's website can run on a P3
800MHz, I don't think too much will be required for say an
internal website if such a need is there.
If you just need to experiment, you can use setup a small LAN
between the 3 of them and try out some networking concepts
just to learn them.

As you told, your old computers are P3. For P3, i don`t even think that, you
need any kind of extra things like thin clients or something like that. As
mehul said, you can install any lightweight window manager there. AFAIK, you
can even use Debian Etch there in those P3 machines.

Best,
Zico

Subject: [Ilugc] Why GNU/Linux is a Must
Message-ID: <809586140707272159g154ed1aaie86e6aa2a902c371@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Luggies,

This is one of my experience I had with GNU/Linux. I have a quad boot
Sempron system running FC3, Ubuntu, Windows XP and Windows ME (all OSs
installed on a single 120 GB IDE HDD). The system was working fine for
the past 3 years when XP has started giving trouble. The said XP is
installed on a 20GB NTFS partition. The trouble began 2 months back
when there was a power surge while running XP crashing the NTFS
partition.  After that the NTFS partiton became unreadable (according
to Windows). The XP installer is not even recognizing that partition
and am unable to even repair that dead OS (or go for a clean install).

All my files were locked in NTFS partition. The rescue came from FC3
which is setup to read the NTFS partition. FC3 was able to read that
partition like a charm recovering all the files. Luckily I was able to
backup the files. But, I don't understand when XP installer has
trouble in examining my disk, how can the FC3's NTFS driver able to
make it.

Even I tried installing Windows 2000, even that died. It is already 2
months without XP, while the other OS's  (FC3, Ubuntu and Windows ME)
works without any problem. I suspect some change in my partition
table. But not sure of it. When I started the system from the scratch
it had 8 partitions (7 FAT32(1 for Windows ME which was active), 1
NTFS (XP Partition)). When I installed FC3 I made 1 /boot (primary
partition) and / partition (ext 3 logical). When I installed Ubuntu I
added 2 more ext3 partitions (1 for ubuntu / and other for general
purpose, both logical partition). Before the installation of FC3  the
Win ME FAT32 partition was made as active boot partition. After FC3
installation /boot has became the 1st partition on the disk making  it
as a active boot partition. So, I have a doubt here that XP installer
is trying to search for a active Windows partition as the first
partition or else it dies. But, I am not sure about this.  This
clearly indicates that the XP installer is a real crap. My disk is
nearly 98% full may be this also confuses XP installer I think. But
why can't it give a clear information instead of saying "Examining
Disk................" for a longer time.

Here is my disks listing from fdisk

Thus having a GNU/Linux in one of the partiton will be very useful. I
am able to carry my day to day activities with GNU/Linux, but I am
missing my Firewire card and my Handycam a lot.

SMART readings says that my disk is OK (Summary). But, I see some 4 to
5 unrecoverable sectors in my log. Does it mean that my disk is dying.

Can some one tell me the mystery surrounding the partitions. I know
that this is not the list to ask.But, Please. Also, can some one tell
me the best practices in hard disk partitioning (120 GB). Which is the
best file systems to be used? The back up strategy to be followed? (I
don't have a DVD) . I have already googled a lot about this. How
reliable is ZFS on linux? Can I have ZFS as a partition alongwith
ext3,FAT32 etc.

Please suggest your opinions.


Thanks,

I have sold a couple of used systems with 300-500MHz range Intel
processors with 128MB RAM installed with xubuntu 6.06 and fluxbox (for
use if needed). The systems were running reasonably OK

As I already told you, the website is very nice! Only, I (sort of)
don't agree with the title page. Of course, that is because I have

1. Try the LinuxBIOS project:
http://linuxbios.org/Welcome_to_LinuxBIOS

2. Try SimpleOS. I have fixed SimpleOS bugs for gcc 4.1.2.
http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/sos/simpleos-25jul2007.tar.gz

You can try the examples from grub. The twelve articles on OS concepts
were written in French by David Decotigny and Thomas Petazzoni, and
published in (GNU/) Linux Magazine between 2002-2004:
http://sos.enix.org/fr/PagePrincipale

If anyone knows French, and can translate the articles to English, it
will be valuable with the source code.

Why should we get away from Old pcs? Here, in Bangladesh, there are many
schools and individuals who has no capability of buying new machines... and
they have really nice smile in there face. It is our duty to make their

One possible thing you could do with old machines, cluster em up using
Openmosix (although the project is gonna die), I have had hours of fun
learning by setting up a cluster of 7 old P3s in my college with a small
blender rendering farm. AFAIK, Yahoo!, Google all use clustered up
commodity boxes for their filesystems (Hadoop and GoogleFS?). So if
anyone gonna throw away their boxes? Ping me..I am waiting with "Open"
arms.

Friends.

I am working on a RHEL 3 Virtual Private Server.

There I have to install,  phpmotion, a video sharing app on php.
phpmotion needs ffmpeg and mplayer.
I installed ffmpeg from various rpms from rpm.pbone.net.


but, mplayer asks a lot of dependencies.

Where can i get all the dependent rpms for RHEL 3?

I have to install ruby on rails too.

Thanks.
T.Shrinivasan.

google - probably googlefs.  but with companies that have been in operation
that long, like us, and yahoo, you're more likely going to see nfs being
used 

And while in our case we do use linux fileservers on a large scale, a
lot of what we use is netapp filers (storage area network - SAN) and
maxtor filers (network attached storage / NAS) .. and nfs plays an
important role in clustering these together.

As already mentioned LTSP is the most appropriate for this. I am
puzzled 
when P3s are called. I have 3 Pentium -I 100MHz PCs purchased in
1997, used as LTSP thin clients. Should I call it ancient-PC?

Yes, ;) .. just kidding.. but 100Mhz would be a serious bottle neck
for a lot applications we have these days.. (but as you say its being
used as a thin client, do you buy faster computers and use it as a
server?) I remember having a very tough time installing firefox on a
very old laptop. It did run though.

It wouldn't. RHEL only includes FOSS patent unencumbered software and it 
ships with up2date by default and not yum.

You can get such software from rpmforge.net or other repositories.

probably start using MSCD for all their large downloads. How do you feel

    It is possible to use poppy linux in Pentium-s  150MHZ Zenith make PC.
Ram is 32 bit. What about LAN Network in this PC?

hi,,

is there any OSS project going  on data mining like parsing the large
log files which are of size ~1GB ?

i would like to extract certain intelligence data from it and process
it to generate a report.
any suggestion?

You can make use of perl/python regex and write some scripts in order
to do the job.

What stops a ruby regex from being used!!

I think the OP's problem is that it is hard to hold a 1GB file in memory. So
he needs some kind of a streaming parser!

StreamSQL might be of use. Am not sure if an implementation is available!
Check it out and share your experience if you can.

Thanks,
mano

If your DRAM is 32 MBytes, your best bet with a mainstream distro is
probably RedHat 6.2 or Mandrake 6/7.x. You can easily upgrade the LAN card
with an el-cheapo 10/100 card like an Intel- or Realtek-based card.

it depends on are you allowed to split the files and do the process.
Some type of data mining require normalization done on the whole file.
In such cases you will have to effectively make a parse tree by storing data
on disk rather than memory.

the logs are generated on the production box where large no of
requests come. i should not  bring the system down but i should also
know the log details so that i can monitor the server.

thanks for all the folks who advised on perl/ruby regex stuff.  also i
googled before i was mailing to the mailing list. i was looking for
various good techniques which will not bring the live server down.

I didnt realise that you were processing server logs.
Cpan  has a neat module for  parsing apache server logs .
if you are writing the regex yourself be extremely careful.
there is nothing as awful as an one liner which is ten times as slower.

Though I have not tried puppy(not poppy) linux in low configuration PCs but
you can find your query answered by visiting
http://puppylinux.org/user/viewpage.php?page_id=1 and search for "ram".
The link http://puppylinux.org/user/readarticle.php?article_id=11 gives a
fair idea about the system requirements[100Mhz,32MB ram+swap].

Is it about the bottle neck at the server??CPU usage of my desktop(Intel
celron 2.4Mhz,512 MB ram with 600MB swap) is around 20%.Rest 80% can be used
by the thin clients.Please do tell how the resources are undermined in LTSP.

Can I get the information regarding the electronic waste produced by
software firms?It will be helpful to me..

If your production traffic logs that much, you should look at logging it to
a separate / dedicated log server (nothing fancy,  as long as there's
plenty of disk). That can also run log analysis processes.

Just having daemons write that much log onto a server that's also handling
production traffic is a serious performance hit. And then trying to parse
those logs when the server is up and serving stuff is another serious
performance hit.

Is the log file rotated on a daily/weekly basis?

If not, you should consider that, having an application append messages 
to the same file is a serious performance hit.

log files are rotated on a daily. everyday ~1GB is generated by apps.
we also have dedicated server where we transfer the log file EOD. but
i want to have live statistics generated out of the log file without
hitting the performance in terms of high CPU, IO, network or what ever
impacting the server availability etc.....

srs's solution of logging to a network machine is the best for
this.

Neither did I  :-)

OP made the first post to chennai.rb group and I thought I was replying to
that group. So, I wondered why, in a ruby mailing list, ruby was being
overlooked in your suggestion. Hence my question!

Apologies

Message-ID: <8d2abdcb0707310341s38c8482dhdd03a27000450e6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Team,

    I want to test ethernet driver for NIC, I have only one PC with two
different NICs(for both drivers are different), So I disabled loopback and
connected both the NICs using cross cable. Output of "ifconfig" is
displaying both the interfaces and ip address is also set for both the
interfaces.
    I executed following to set ip address :
#ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
#ifconfig eth1 192.168.0.5 netmask 255.255.255.0
#ifconfig lo down

    After that I tried to execute following commands,
    #route add -net 192.168.0.5 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.0.5 dev
eth0
    #route add -net 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.0.1 dev
eth1
but those comands are giving error like :
" route: netmask doesn't match route address"

    I also put "1" in ip_forward file.

I am not able to ping anyone of those interfaces using ping command.

Can anyone give some inputs on this?

Thanks,
Bhavesh.

Both are on the same network 192.168.0.0/24, and both on the same PC.

Shouldn't they be on different networks? Use something like
192.168.1.5 for eth1.

Hi Shakthi,

I tried to set ip address from different network also, but then also I am
getting same error while setting route.

Thanks,

You're trying to create two routes for 192.168.0.x?   I'm not a
networking expert, but this seems wrong. try:

# route add -net 192.168.0.5 netmask 255.255.255.255 gw 192.168.0.5 dev eth0
# route add -net 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.255 gw 192.168.0.1 dev eth1

Hi,

       I have Feisty Fawn installed on my desktop and have been using it 
for some time now. I`ve just bought a new laptop and would like to 
transfer all my Ubuntu settings from the desktop to the laptop, without 
downloading and installing all the packages on my desktop ( I have no 
idea what all packages i installed over time ). Is there any way to 
easily do it? I remember using a Files and Settings Transfer wizard in 
Win Xp. Is there something similar here? I tried Googling but all it 
threw up were migration assistants for moving from windows to feisty.

For Documents & Settings just copy you home directory from old machine to
new machine.
For software, if you used apt-get or synaptic then use APTonCD (
http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/) to burn all the downloaded package and
install it on the new machine.

Thanks for the reply. But i just tried APTonCD to burn an image file 
now. Even though I installed some software like Amarok through apt-get 
they`re not included in the list of packages burnt. Any idea why?

And for some software like Picasa, I remember it used the opt folder. Is 
there a way to get those software to be transferred as well?

Only the binaries will be installed on /opt settings will still be stored
inside your home for those applications.

Type writing can be done in applications like  Abiword .I am not sure about
the package "creation"..There are softwares for personal accounting called
Xfinans.Take a look at
http://puppylinux.org/user/readarticle.php?article_id=2

What is the configuration of your PC on which you want to use puppy Linux?
