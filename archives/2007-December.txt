Subject: [Ilugc] Presentation at Saveetha Engg College
Message-ID: <bc3fff520711301030l16eafe09v9a8d29243d7ac47c@mail.gmail.com>

 Dear Friends!

    Today Myself and shrini have gone to saveetha Engineering college.
First we met Pricipal ,Dean and HOD. They gave warm welcome to us.
After a meet with principal about our activities, we went to seminar hall.
As usual tamil thaai vazhthu and all other formal introductary speechs held.


 I started with the presentation "What/Why opensource?"
I moved the session with more interaction.In that presentation
no where i told "opensource is best".I have just explained the cases,
and asked the question "Which is better?" .

    After my presentation shrini took the "History of Open Source".
He gave the story without any doze to the students by walking among students

and making more interaction.

   After Lunch Mr.Baskar (LinuXperts Systems) gave his presentation.
Then shrini gave the presentation about our ilugc activities.
Due to time constraints  we stopped at 3.15 p.m  and answered the questions.
Finally we wind up with national anthem.

*Lessons learned from this activity:*

1.) We should strictly follow our agenda.

(Due to time constraints we left one more prepared presentation "Jobs in
Opensource" and Installation demo.)

2.) Adoptation with time (Lunch time, tea time...)

3.) What to do ? if power fail... (Power failed for more then 10 times).

4.) If any problem while taking the presentation(Projector problem,power
failure ...), Mean time
we should have some stuff to manage the students.(any interesting story
about opensource or anything)

5.) Colourfull and Interactive presentations gave good results among
students
(Among 45 students, no one slept).

6.) Going with our own laptop is best. (As we dont have own laptop,
we showed the presentations with the college System, which has windoz with
virus ;-).
 As soon as we  inserted our pen drive, It got affected by virus and lost
some files,
changed folder names...etc. Actually we have showed that one as "virus demo"
to the students ;-).

7.) If we have to show the presentations from windoz, we should bring the
presentations in CD.

8.) We should know how to adjust the projector while installation demo.
(Finally we planned to
show the installation demo(Ubuntu Feisty). But, due to frequency problem,
projector didnt render properly.
 So we dropped installation.The projectors are always nightmare to me ;-)).

9.) We should go with PDF viewer, Media Player (VLC...),Open Office and what
ever we
need for our presentation.( We planned to show some videos related to linux,

but due to virus problem we lost the VLC setup file.).


*   Presentation will be uploaded soon....*

This is a great strategy. Always works. Never fails.

I don't think this is a problem. Nothing can be planned to the last
detail. We will always run out of time!

I think time management is very difficult to get right.

What to do? Nothing can be done. Just pray to God. :)

This is something that can surely be done. It is best to ensure that
everything is working hours before the event. In case the premises are
not open by then you have to carry everything with you and ensure that
Murphy's law does not strike. In any case if we take enough pains I
think this can be solved to a large extent.

Planning and anticipating failures is very critical.

Yes. Slides are marvelous. Fantastic. In fact I have never seen the idea
of using real life images to convey the practical aspects of open source
working so well.

Your images are superb. Extremely well chosen and so is the layout of
the slides and the text.

I also liked the attribution to flickr and picasa.

I used images from flickr but did not attribute since the photos were in
public domain anyway.

This is a good lesson for me.

See, it is not all bad.

If the college does not have proper infrastructure we cannot do much.

Infrastructure is important to do a good job.

Ask their experience in trying Linux. Most will come with stories
about how they tried redhat 8/9 on Dual core p4 with sata, intel
945chipset and say linux sucks.

True for some time. But for the past few seminars, even for two day
event, I have stopped using slides [except for philosphy]. Everything
online demo, that too with volunteers from participants.

That is very bad. Have knoppix cd,dvd or on pen drive. Boot from it
and show the slides.

In such situations I will simply talk, no slides (offcourse with
knoppix on hand you never need to).

Not with intention of starting flame war, but the fact is ubuntu let
me down atleast twice in public, I quickly recovered my 'manam', by
going back to debian. I never had problems with fedora/redhat also.

hi guys, great work. hope I can start imposing on you guys too (apart from
my usual catches of Raman, Bharathi, etc.)

while Raman and others have given valuable comments / suggestions, let me
add a few of my own [a few points may be repeated but with different
flavor].
1. do not worry much about time constraint. with due regard to the FOSS
community -- who want to share all and the latest -- we are addressing the
novices and neoconverts. If 2 of your 4 presentations catch the audience
attention, so much the better.  you can squeeze the other two in a very
minimal time and/or make the offer
    (a) if the audience is willing, another session could be held on a later
date
        [even if you are not available, let us jointly ensure that somebody
goes ]
    (b) if the college cannot host, we can a special session on one of the
saturdays
         at MIT / NRCFOSS or some other college  -- interested students
could come over
        (e.g., Jaya Engg could be developed as the 'norther chennai node')
2. As Raman suggested, ensure that there is a Linux installation demo --
done by a student under your instruction
3. Make an offer that interested students could take up projects -- NRCFOSS
can do the background handholding, talking with the staff , etc., while LUG
members do the mentoring. If needed, the nrcfosshelpline portal can be used
as wiki or code repository. 2nd and 3rd year students will be the prime
targets.
4. each time, take a live cd. in fact, you can leave it with the college so
that 'interested students or staff' could play with it and learn. if you can
catch 2 serious guys/girls from 3 visits, it will be great. [Just as I was
typing this, I got one student from KCG college  -- seems quite serioius --
where I had made a presentation 3 months back!]

please feel free to catch us if we could be of any use.
al the best and continue the good work.
Srinivasan, NRCFOSS

Hi All,

Though, this is related to the MS-Windows XP and Firefox, this might help
people who are trying to find the solution.
I got several responses from different people for the Problem related to
Tamil in Firefox(In Windows). To be frank, nothing worked.

I saw the solution from a web site(forum). Thank you very much for the
person whoever has posted that. Here is the link of that.

http://www.themediasite.net/forums/showthread.php?t=30899

Here is the solution mentioned there.

=============================
     Control Panel -> Regional and Language Options -> Languages Tab ->
Enable "Install files for complex script and right-to-left languages(including
Thai)".

     You need to put the installation CD.

     After intallation, reboot the PC.

     Upon, starting the machine and Firefox, it worked perfectly fine.

No! They are NOT nameservers. They _are_ the IP addresses of
hproxy.iitm.ac.in, run by the computer center.

It is ok if you don't follow the agenda. The audience might want to
hear something new, and it is ok to address that. But, you should
always follow time constraints. If you have many speakers, and there

Prior to any workshop ask for a whiteboard and whiteboard markers, and

\--

Yes, if you have one. If you have it, you should go atleast one hour
before the start of the workshop, so you can test your laptop with the
projector. If it doesn't work you have atleast an hour to find
alternatives:

1. School/college PC with a liveCD
2. Install any distro on a school/college PC and use it.

Even otherwise, every speaker who comes to the workshop, must have a
copy of all the presentations, code examples etc. of all the other
speakers.

Keep one copy online before the workshop, in case, you want to
download them from the Internet from the school/college labs.

Thumb drives are not expensive these days.

If possible, keep presentation slides in many formats (.odp, .pdf,

in whichever format they want (and not impose proprietary formats like
.ppt on the end user).

I am sure this link would be helpful to fellow students and people

Lectures from abelson and sussman themselves.
Direct links to the videos doesnt seem to work, but torrents are there. 
Too bad my internet isnt "broadband" enough to download all the videos.
Would be awesome if anyone with the 2mbps connection downloads the

I assume, if the projector was the cause, that
projector is rather a DLP - Digital Light Processor
Projector and not an LCD Projector. LCD projectors
probably work out-of-the-box on almost any distro.

>>6.) Going with our own laptop is best. (As we dont have own laptop,
we showed the presentations with the college System, which has windoz with
virus ;-).
 As soon as we  inserted our pen drive, It got affected by virus and lost
some files,
changed folder names...etc. Actually we have showed that one as "virus demo"
to the students ;-).

>>7.) If we have to show the presentations from windoz, we should bring the
presentations in CD.

>>9.) We should go with PDF viewer, Media Player (VLC...),Open Office and
what
ever we
need for our presentation.( We planned to show some videos related to linux,

but due to virus problem we lost the VLC setup file.).




I have a solution to these problems. use any pendrive linux.

Solutions:

6th point with pendrive linux:

directly booting with your pendrive make your system go to linux not to
windows. So no virus at all.

7th and 9th point with pendrive linux:

All your linux ready softwares will be present on your pendrive linux. so no
need to bother about installing openoffice, VLC media player. nowadays,
pendrive linux distros have the ability to save changes. So updating your
contents is also possible.

I personally feel puppylinux is better to fit this situation. because I am
using puppy in somewhat relative situation like urs, that is 'a browsing
center linux user'.

Don't expect people to get back with review comments.

If you get them it is a bonus.

You should understand that review is hard work.

Your slides are outstanding. Just use them and have fun!

Subject: [Ilugc] Require help in accessing / sending mails
Message-ID: <292171.5166.qm@web31910.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

My name is Kannan. In my office we have installed
Redhat E.S 4.0 for mail server and Redhat 9.0 for
Gateway server.

I want to give access to my branch office for mailing.
So  I did nat in the firewall / gateway server.

My script 
/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d 59.x.x.x
--dport 25 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.x.x
/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d 59.x.x.x
--dport 110 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.x.x

Using this script my branch office can able to send
mails to my domain, but they can not able to send
mails to other domains say for example yahoo.com,
gmail or hotmail.com.

when ever my branch office try to send mails to other
domains it immediately bounce back with an error
message " The message could not be sent because one of
the recipients was rejected by the server. The
rejected e-mail address was ?kannan_6074@yahoo.com?.
Subject ?test? Account: ?Lawindia?, Server
?59.144.x.x?, Protocol:SMTP, Server Response: ?554
kannan_6074@yahoo.com: Relay access denied?, Port: 25,
Secure [SSL]: No, Server Error: 554, Error Number:
0x800CCC79."

Can any one help me in this regard. Our domain name is
lawindia.com. we are using fetchmail, postfix. All the
mails are pull down from our mail server which is
hosted in mumbai and distributed locally.

Thanks and warm regards,

A.K. Kannan.

Any particular reason for sticking with RH9.0 and a Gateway server?  
IIRC, there is no support for it i.e. security updates etc.

You have to configure your MTA to allow relay to other domains.  The 
error message above clearly states so.  I would strongly suggest SMTP 
AUTH in order to accept messages for relaying.  Postfix has excellent 
docs at www.postfix.org and other forums.

Type visudo, and add the following line:

myuser         ALL = (ALL) ALL

Then myuser has all the privileges as root, and sudo -s will give
him/her a root shell.

I disagree. visudo is the right way because (I quote from the visudo man page):

"visudo edits the sudoers file in a safe fashion, analogous to
vipw(8).  visudo locks the sudoers file against multiple simultaneous
edits, provides basic sanity checks, and checks for parse errors.  If
the sudoers file is currently being edited you will receive a message
to try again later."

So, if it's a multiadmin server, say, this is always safer.

HTH.

What is your real goal?

sudo is used for allowing select users to run select commands. It is
required for tightening security and avoiding giving root privilege to
users at all costs.

You can learn a lot about it in the man pages and of course google.

If you tell us for what purpose you need to give sudo access then
someone could guide you thro' the process in case you get stuck.

linux man pages are hard to read in the beginning but as time passes by
you will get comfortable with it.

Best of luck !

how to drink coffee with tea? You can have coffee with milk and  
sugar, or black coffee, or coffee with bun. You can have tea with  
lemon, with milk and sugar or with bun. Perl is a programming  
language you can use it with postgresql/mysql/sqlite apache, KDE, etc  
etc and you can do the same with PHP (but not as well as with perl).  
So forget about interacting with PHP. Perl is a great language, and  
it is a good thing you are studying it.

Greetings.

If your question is how to exchange data between PHP and Perl, the
simplest form of data exchange (that can be parsed easily) is
JSON[1].  Both the languages have their own extensions to parse JSON
format and they're very fast[2].

If you want to learn about JSON, you can grab my presentation from
here[3].

I guess that answers your question.

[1] http://json.org/
[2] Don't use the PEAR JSON package for PHP, there is one in PECL that
    is written in C, its very performant.

Sorry, slides are not ready yet. 

I am swamped with work and hope to send the slides at the earliest.

I shall try my level best to demonstrate the power of jQuery with live
examples. 

This is a very informal and light topic, so please come. 

See you all there. ;)

Was at a FOSS introduction workshop held at Sammanthurai, 360 KM to the South 
of Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka (Dec 01 and 02).

First travel abroad. NRCFOSS, Ubuntu Community, South Eastern University of 
Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka LUG share the credits for this event.

On Dec 01, after a hectic travel of little less than ten hours from Colombo, 
we reached Sammanthurai crossing the hill town Kandi (If you are a Cricket 
fan you should be aware, its here Muralitharan broke Shane Warne?s record few 
days back).

Mauran of our team had made prior arrangements for the event. The event 
started with all formalities there, we had with us Hon. Metha Vihari 
(Buddhist Monk) who addressed the students to begin with.

Later to a question asked to him as to why he chose to use free software, he 
told the gathering, since he is a Monk, he cannot afford to pay ?too? much 
for the software he may use.

Also since he is a Monk he can not say ?NO? to some one who asks for a copy of 
the software. Since sharing is one of the foremost of all prerequisites of a 
Monk. To say that I can?t share is simply un-ethical.

Hi.

for which command you need source?
search in net for that command.

for documentation, man <command-name> will give you documentation.

Note.
please ask your questions in detail.
otherwise, people avoid answering.

If you are using Debian or Ubuntu, then the best way is to find out
which package the file is in and get the source using apt-get
(assuming you have deb-src entries in sources.list).

[kumar@debian ~/Debian/DPMT/enthought-kiva/trunk] apt-file search /usr/bin/top
libwww-topica-perl: usr/bin/topica2mail
procps: usr/bin/top
tcpquota: usr/bin/topmasq
tcpquota: usr/bin/topnet
tcpquota: usr/bin/toptcp

OK, so wee need procps.

[kumar@debian /tmp] apt-get source procps
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Need to get 324kB of source archives.
Get:1 ftp://10.65.0.42 unstable/main procps 1:3.2.7-5 (dsc) [612B]
Get:2 ftp://10.65.0.42 unstable/main procps 1:3.2.7-5 (tar) [282kB]
Get:3 ftp://10.65.0.42 unstable/main procps 1:3.2.7-5 (diff) [41.7kB]
Fetched 324kB in 0s (2306kB/s)
dpkg-source: extracting procps in procps-3.2.7
dpkg-source: unpacking procps_3.2.7.orig.tar.gz
dpkg-source: applying ./procps_3.2.7-5.diff.gz

Simple, right? And sure enough, the directory has top.c! :-)

HTH.

Subject: [Ilugc] Joboffer - Students only - partime - 20k/month 
Message-ID: <4757CA19.5080802@gmail.com>

Hi Guys,
   I'm looking for some smart kids who can work during weekends, 
evenings etc from home.

Requirements:
1)1st or 2nd or 3rd year BE/B.Tech student in a college (no final year 
students or  M.Techs)
2)Very good in Mathematics. 
3)Little experience with programming - any language .
4)Familiar with  linux system -  basic commands like ls.
5)You should have access to some computer.
6)Expert in searching Google, getting things done without much help.
7)Passion for programming or Maths or both.



What will you do with us?
1)JavaScript, PHP programming (60 %)
2)Linux / Apache admin (10 %)
3)A bit of boring work - browse, gather information, and present it in 
nice PDF format. (30%)


How to apply?
1) Do not send your resume.
2) Did you take IIT Mains ? what is your All India Rank ?  (If you are 
an undergraduate in IIT, then you are almost in)
3) Do you have a blog ? or a webpage ? 
4) What is your IRC nick ?  Do you participate in any mailing lists ? If 
so give me the urls that contain your threads.
5) Do you have a pet project ?  ( can be one of those that you did in 
12th std for board exams .. but it should be your *own* idea)
6) Which college do you study ? What course ?  What are your plans  for 
final semester project ?  (your own ideas only)
7) Best time to call you on Skype. After 0700 PM, Indian time.


I'm looking only for one student. The selected one will directly work 
with me and some of my friends in Bangalore. You can take off during 
exams. You only need to work 10 days in a month. I will pay 2k for every 
day you work and hence 20k/month.  *I am not responsible for your 
grades. Your grades will go down once you start working for me.*  I will 
also pay for a good broadband connection.  Before you start working I 
will pay you 2k advance ( assuming you qualify the interview).   I will 
coach you on PHP, JS, CSS, Linux etc. We will communicate via email, IM, 
Skype. We will also use http://www.assembla.com/ - a tool to manage 
agile  development teams spread over.

Hi,

In our office we are having our own domain
"lawindia.com" which is hosted in mumbai. 

We are using DSL broad band connection for internet.
And also the DSL person has provided me a static ip.
This IP is configured in the gateway server for
accessing the internet and through this IP we are
sending and receiving the mails.

In our office we have the mail server for local
distribution. here we are using fetchmail and postfix.
we are using Redhat E.S. 5.0. We are fetching the
mails from mumbai server and while send the mails it
will go directly from our local server. I would like
to configure in such a way that all out going mails
should go via my mumbai mail server.

Kindly let me know were i have to make changes in
postfix.

Thanks

A.K. Kannan.

Hi Guys,
   I'm looking for some smart kids who can work during weekends,
evenings etc from home.

Requirements:
1)1st or 2nd or 3rd year BE/B.Tech student in a college (no final year
students or  M.Techs)

3)Little experience with programming - any language .
4)Familiar with  linux system -  basic commands like ls.
5)You should have access to some computer.
6)Expert in searching Google, getting things done without much help.
7)Passion for programming or Maths or both.



What will you do with us?
1)JavaScript, PHP programming (60 %)
2)Linux / Apache admin (10 %)
3)A bit of boring work - browse, gather information, and present it in
nice PDF format. (30%)


How to apply?
1) Do not send your resume.
2) Did you take IIT Mains ? what is your All India Rank ?  (If you are
an undergraduate in IIT, then you are almost in)
3) Do you have a blog ? or a webpage ?
4) What is your IRC nick ?  Do you participate in any mailing lists ? If
so give me the urls that contain your threads.
5) Do you have a pet project ?  ( can be one of those that you did in

I'm looking only for one student. The selected one will directly work

exams. You only need to work 10 days in a month. I will pay 2k for every
day you work and hence 20k/month.  *I am not responsible for your
grades. Your grades will go down once you start working for me.*  I will
also pay for a good broadband connection.  Before you start working I
will pay you 2k advance ( assuming you qualify the interview).   I will
coach you on PHP, JS, CSS, Linux etc. We will communicate via email, IM,
Skype. We will also use http://www.assembla.com/ - a tool to manage

Hi, 
I am Sudharshan S, and am really passionate about Programming and
Computer Science as a whole. I like to learn new interesting things but
I must say, I am not really familiar with the web side of things as I
prefer a more low level C/Python Stuff. That said I am a quick learner
and would like to make use of this oppurtunity to have fun and work hard
at the same time. I won't claim to be an expert in Mathematics as my
grades in Mathematics are pretty average, but recently Discrete
Mathematics and Computation theories have captured my interests to a
great level.

Answering some of the questions you had put forth on the ILUGC lists,

> 2) Did you take IIT Mains ? what is your All India Rank ?  (If you
> are 
> an undergraduate in IIT, then you are almost in)
Nope, I didnt take the IIT Mains

> 3) Do you have a blog ? or a webpage ? 
Its at http://www.sudharsh.wordpress.com

> 4) What is your IRC nick ?  Do you participate in any mailing lists ?
> If 
> so give me the urls that contain your threads.
Sup3rkiddo @ freenode, #linux-india, #openmoko, #ubuntu-in,
#openembedded. Here are some of the random urls of my threads in the
different mailing lists, but I can assure you that I do know "How to ask
smart questions".

...and so on and so forth

> 5) Do you have a pet project ?  ( can be one of those that you did in

Not really a pet project as I am working on it quite seriously. I am
working on python bindings[1] for the Openmoko Distribution. Currently
busy with creating a python API for the underlying gsm framework. Past
experience includes writing little LDTP test scripts for mozilla-firefox
and a thunderbird, and little gedit plugin(a kiddish hack) for
ldtpeditor. 

> 6) Which college do you study ? What course ?  What are your plans
> for

Shri Andal Alagar College of Engineering; B.E, Computer Science; Have
not really thought seriously about it but I want to do something in
embedded linux. Probably create some end user applications for the
Openmoko stack.

> 7) Best time to call you on Skype. After 0700 PM, Indian time.
Anytime after 2100 Hours.

I guess that all, it will be wonderful to know more about this
oppurtunity.

It is hard to get it right but mplayer can do it.

For the complete story  check out 

http://linuxjournal.com/9815

And to cut a long story short,

$ mplayer -ao pcm:file=novoice.wav -af karaoke song.mp3

I tried it with some Illayaraja songs, my ever favorite music director
and it worked very well with some. 

You should realize that this is a theoretically intractable problem to
solve given the fact that once mixed you cannot remove.

However it the tracks are stored separately it is trivial.

There are plenty of tools for audio processing in linux.

I know sox and audacity.

Then there is hydrogen, rosegarden and so on.

Check out Dave Phillip's blog in linuxjournal.

He writes  brilliant articles about audio on linux.

He is one of the best authors of LJ and a very impressive musician
himself.

Not available. If you want, use Jigdo, though I don't think Ubuntu
gives jigdo images for main releases, only alternate releases get
them.

hda : DMA timeout error




Also I could hear a different sound from my CPU...
Even if i restart so many time i get the same problem.....
If i get into windows... it will be very slow with the same sound from cpu.

I removed the harddisc and booted the system with Ubuntu Live cd. It works
well...
If i leave the system and come after some time.. it Will be sometime ok..
but again in one or two days i get the same problem.

Had the same problem and got the same errors as well. Mostly its a
faulty RAM, but then again run a full scan using smartmontools to see if
its your hard disk. But in my case atleast, It was a screwy RAM. You can
also run memtest to check for errors in RAM

If you are using 40bin IDE cable then, change it to 80bin cable and
check. If probelm is not solved then it is right time to change your
HDD.

	Narendra Dev College (Delhi University) & formation of College LUG
Message-ID: <1197230780.5670.92.camel@laptop.censusindia.net>

                         LINUX & FOSS WORKSHOP

 ORGANIZED BY : ACHARYA NARENDRA DEV COLLEGE, jointly with OPENLX LINUX

      Venue : Acharya Narendra Dev College, Govindpuri, New Delhi.

          Date : 6 & 7 December 2007. Time : 0930 to 1730 hrs.


Initially planned as a simple Linux familiarization workshop for staff
and students of the college, it became as a full-fledged LINUX & FOSS
WORKSHOP with speakers and visitors from outside the college and Media,
apart from the college students and faculty.


The workshop was organized by the college jointly with OpenLX Linux who
brought in the expert speakers, its own team and expertise to build a
futuristic event.


Dr. Savithri Singh, Principal, Acharya Narendra Dev College, welcomed
Prof. Poonam Bedi (Head, Department of Computer Science, University of
Delhi), the speakers and the participants to the workshop. In her
remarks she explained how she was introduced to Linux and Wikipidia and
her initial interesting experience with Linux. She wondered if
Universities across the world can use Linux for education, why can't we
in India do it. She mentioned that this workshop is aimed to become an
example and that we should take the torch of Linux knowledge to all the
other colleges of Delhi University, creating a live example for all. She
explained how various Governments across the world including the Kerala
State Government have declared ?NO? to windows and ?YES? to exclusive
usage of Linux for their work. ?There is a gradual realization and shift
towards Linux across the globe?, she said. Delhi University has taken
the first step by giving us the new computers with Linux installed and
now we are taking it forward in our college. One of the college lab is
now 100% Linux, and another one is dual boot. Now, we all will learn and
master Linux and move ahead. We are committed for Linux, she declared.
She explained the importance of the availability of source code and how
this helps students learn the technology, and that, this is not possible
on windows, it being a closed source proprietory technology. She
announced that there will be more such workshop for more people and
follow-up workshops for current participants on advanced subjects of
Linux, to expand and enhance the learning. She declared that personally
as well as college Principal, she is fully committed to Linux. She
invited the participants to learn the maximum and take it to others
around them, thus spreading real-education. 


The workshop was formally Inaugurated by Prof. Poonam Bedi (Head,
Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi), who extended her
full support to this trend-creating event and wished that such
activities happen across the University in all the colleges. She
explained the Linux initiative at Delhi University and the support that
Linux implementations and usage has started receiving from various
quarters. 


Comparing between Linux, Windows and Macintosh, she explained the
advantages of Linux vis-a-vis the other two and urged the audience to
try Linux, it being Free, Open Source and Virus-free. She thanked the
audience for participating in the event and wished a great success to
the event.

Sudhir Gandotra, C.E.O. OpenLX Linux introduced Linux explaining the
Freedom, Open Source etc. aspects of it. Using a slide show he explained
to participants the reasons why Linux is the only choice for true
education in I.T. And urged the authorities to convert the syllabus from
being product-oriented to technology oriented.

Connecting Linux machine to Internet through data-card (without needing
any driver to use the data-card), it was demonstrated to the
participants (through www.netcraft.com website) that even microsoft was
running their server (download.microsoft.com) using Linux as the OS.
Participants wondered if this was the case of that builder who would not
live in building made by himself. !


During the practical session, the participants were given a Linux
installed computer to use it the way they wished. In this session, there
was no agenda and it was found that participants started exploring
various applications/tools on the KDE that was available to them on
these machines having OpenLX Linux installed there.

While they all started working as ROOT user, they were explained the
security risk attached and were shown how to create a user and they all
shifted from ROOT user to GUEST user.


Post lunch, there was a demonstration on how to do RAD programming using
QT, by Ratheesh from OpenLX.

Next was the 12th standard student Arjun Asthana who explained the C++
programming on Linux. Explaining that Turbo C was based on standards of
1993, he urged the authorities to move ahead so that college students
can learn Programming on latest standards.

Later in the practical session, he also explained how it was possible to
run Turbo C in Linux using DosBox so that Linux machines can be used to
study this compulsory topic till the authorities decide to modernize the
curriculum.

Arjun, being so young and having over 6 years' experience of programming
on Linux became a hit among the participants who all wanted to ask him
so many things. In his simple unassuming style, Arjun was seen answering
all their questions, many times talking about the standards, the
technologies being used on Linux and the advanced possibilities that
existed for students on Linux.

We hope his example will inspire the participants to move strongly
towards exploring Linux and finding a new future that awaits them all.


Day Two :

Thanks to Rajiv Chopra, Editor, Linux for You, Atanu Datta (Editorial
Coordinator) was with us to share his experience as a User and gave very
simple-straight forward and inspiring response to the problems
(imaginary) of many users who by now were planning to migrate to Linux.
This was an interesting session, where, many times, we saw the imaginary
aspects being responded by real life experience.

The important of actually using Linux was seen and the participants
agreed that their practical exposure of first day had shown them that
everything looked very much similar. To that extent, they had no fear of
getting into an unknown zone and were already interested in migrating to
Linux.

Some users had already called the OpenLX team last evening taking tips
on installing it on their home computers and some had brought their
computers to college to have OpenLX Linux installed.


A complete demonstration of dual-boot installation was given, resulting
in all of them agreeing to do it on their computers over the weekend.

The Linux DVDs were made available to participants at very special
affordable prices.


Mr. S. K. Goel, Vice President (I.T.), Om Logistics along with his team
from the company, explained how their company became a 100% Linux user,
resulting in ZERO-Downtime and no errors, bringing in not only huge
savings but also the best possible security and stability to their
operations.

He emphasized that even if Linux had cost them many times more, they
would have chosen it, as this level of security-stability and virus-free
situation was not even imaginable on windows.

He also informed of a survey in their company wherein employees did not
want even a raise for using windows, as their productivity had increased
many times by using Linux.


The demonstration of KOHA Library software was given as another live
example of how an Open Source project and surpassed the standards set by
the world and now KOHA is setting the global standards for Library
software.


Dr. Savithri Singh, in her closing remarks, thanked the participants and
OpenLX on making the show a complete success and re-iterated her
commitment to Linux and invited participants to take this forward
strongly.

She hoped that the need of anti-virus software in her college would stop
now that everyone would happily shift to Linux.


Intex Computers demonstrated their ?OpenLX-Linux pre-installed? Desktops
and Laptops, making people aware that such computers are now readily
available in the market, giving people the choice of buying Linux
?pre-installed and bundled? computers, and saving the cost of windows
when they don't want it.


ANDC LUG (Linux Users Group) was formed and all participants happily
became its members. The LUG will have its mailing list formed
immediately and start having its regular meeting. Sudhir Gandotra
explained them the functioning of LUGs and how they can interact with
other LUGs and experts and grow forward on the Linux path of freedom.


A Clustering Lab will be setup at college with the help of OpenLX Linux.
College students will participate in building future versions of OpenLX
Linux by working on its source code at the college lab.

NRCFOSS will handle the financial side. We are printing the brochures
for approaching the sponsors. It will be ready in a day or two.

Dr.Srinivasan/KG please let us know in whose favour the payments

Yes, but depends on the amount collected. On the other hand I feel
if some company is sponsoring ad directly we should welcome it,
instead of we ourself giving the ad.

hahahahaaaaaa. ROTFL
brilliant!

another perspective shows the greatness of foss without belittling
microsoft:

the greatness of foss is that anybody can use it for any purpose, even those
who fiercely and insidiously try to oppose it. this is a measure of true
freedom.

Do you have a how-to of running Turbo C++ 3.0 under
DosBox? 
Apparently, many still fail to realize that Turbo C or
Turbo C++ 3.0 is a 16-bit compiler and tends to
emulate a DOS environment when working in Windows 2000
Professional (:-0) or Windows XP. It is also equally
important for people to know that a lot of graphic
capabilities it offers is restricted to the product
itself. 

However, the product continues to enjoy disk space on
many computers across Computer Labs in Mumbai colleges
conducting BSc (CS & IT), and guess what, MSc(CS & IT)
courses.

Yes..  A How to on Turbo C in Linux would be useful in all schools and
colleges in tamil nadu..  (We can make them implement it, by explaining the

Subject: [Ilugc] Subversion server compromised (again).
Message-ID: <3b15edbe0712112011l2486f580w837477571d2c7622@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I had posted previously to the list about a subversion server at work
that I thought was compromised.
See http://article.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc/39820/

After I got confirmation of that the suggested steps were followed,
i.e. rebuild the box, reinstall, and take certain security measures to
prevent a repeat of events. All external access was removed, so the
box was only accessible from the internal lan. Only 2 net services
were running on the box, ssh and subversion using apache. Root logins
using ssh was disabled, and also password based ssh logins. It was set
up so that ssh could only be accessed using RSA/DSA keys. As before, I
am not the admin for that box or in general. I am the designated
person for creating new repositories or adding subversion users, that
is all. Inspite of that, it was me who implemented the security
measures listed above.

While I was away on vacation my boss called me to say the root
password on the box had been changed again, and he asked if I had
changed it. I had not, which means the box is compromised again. This
time the intruder took steps to cover his tracks. The .bash_history
file of root was not deleted, but there were no entries after a
certain point. The same was the case with /var/log/secure*, there were
no entries after a certain point, but the files existed and were not
zero sized. Nor was there any unusual accounts visible in /etc/passwd
or /etc/shadow with a user id of 0. Therefore it was not possible to
figure out what the intruder did after getting in or how he got in at
all.

Figuring out what happened is beyond my skills or that of anyone here,
and I have no training in this area anyway. Whatever I did last time
was based on reading some old Linux Journal articles. Obviously the
box has to be flattened and rebuilt, but it is important to find out
how it was compromised so we can plug those holes, whether in the
firewall settings, the general lan configuration and the software
running on the box.

I did some reading up on rootkits and learnt about user-level and
kernel-level rootkits, and it may be that something like that has been
installed. This may be another reason I can't figure out what
happened. From what I've read about rootkits, they are nearly
impossible to detect, can be setup to persist even after a reboot and
if the rootkit is a kernel module, it can attach itself to another
module, and so on. Like I said, it is beyond my ability to figure out
if there is any rootkit installed. I am also afraid of inadvertently
destroying evidence in my ignorance, if I do try to find out.

Anyway, I finally come to my questions. Does anybody have any
suggestions where one get hold of a computer forensics and/or security
professional? They would have to have a high enough level of knowledge
to figure out how the intruder got in, what he/she did on the box,
given that the usual evidence has been wiped. It might be that the
intruder still managed to leave some traces, and I hope to find
someone knowledgeable and experienced enough to discover those traces.
Also, they would need to be able to figure out if the intruder came in
from another compromised machine on the lan, and how many boxes on the
lan have been compromised, whether from the subversion server or
otherwise. The lan consists of mostly windows machines, and a few
linux boxes and a few macs. I fear that every machine on the lan has
been compromised too, either from the subversion box this time, or
perhaps from last time, or some other way.

If anybody has dealt with forensics people, could they share their
experiences? Like which professional / firm did a good job and which
ones to avoid.

I really hope to get some suggestions. The whole thing is a mess and I
am the guy who knows a lot about security issues around here, which is
frightening.

If and when we figure out with professional help how the compromise
happened and what other damage has been done, I'll post the
information so that others will know what NOT to do.

Looking forward to your replies.

Amartyo

Give more info... What is auto boot and interactive mode? 
What do you mean by unable to boot? Are you getting any

Do we have some breakup for the cost? I remember we had discussed some broad
figures -- please redirect me to the wiki page / mail, if it is already
given.

it is likely that any expense above 2 - 2.5 lakhs would have to be met from
sponsorship revenues.

Am sorry, I cannot be of help!!

A person called Binand used to frequent this list till a few months back.
IMO, he was good at these matters. However, he has stopped posting (or maybe
even unsubscribed) for whatever reason!! Maybe you can mail him and ask his
help directly! He has a gmail account with the above id.

Best of luck :-)

Hi Amartyo

Is there anyone apart from root who has root privileges . The very same
issue i too had when my servers root password got changed twice which was
running on a redhat 9 machine . I installed rootkit hunter but it did not
show anything. Before i started handeling the server there were some people
who had root access ( the uid field in the /etc/passwd field had been set to
0 ). Then one day a senior with root access came to me and said that he is
not able to change his password. He used to type passwd command to change
his password and as a result changed the root password. I wonder if same is
the case with you.

Subject: [Ilugc] loud noise and partial scan on HP ScanJet 2200c
Message-ID: <1197551827.476130d3112f4@webmail.rawbw.com>

Hello,

I tried sending this on sane-devel, but my email keeps bouncing.
I am hoping someone in ilugc can help me with my problem.

I see that the awful noise and partial scan issues with scanners
using the Plustek backend have been discussed in sane-devel, but
the solution to the problem is unclear to me.

I am using an HP ScanJet 2200c flatbed.  It uses the plustek backend.
This scanner used to work just fine with earlier versions of Linux.
However, I am encountering issues with Fedora Core 5 and Kubuntu 7.10.

Here is the Kubuntu configuration:

. libusb:
  $ dpkg -l | grep libusb
  ii  libusb-0.1-4   2:0.1.12-7  userspace USB programming library
  ii  libusb-dev     2:0.1.12-7  userspace USB programming library developmen

. sane:
  $ dpkg -l | grep sane
  ii  libsane        1.0.19~cvs20070505-3ubuntu2  API library for scanners

. Kernel: 2.6.22-14-generic, 32 bit

The plustek shared library has the version 1.0.18:
$ ls -l | grep plustek
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    911 2007-12-12 23:49 libsane-plustek.la
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    980 2007-10-05 20:56 libsane-plustek.la.orig
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1001 2007-10-05 20:56 libsane-plustek_pp.la
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     28 2007-12-11 01:40 libsane-plustek_pp.so.1 ->
libsane-plustek_pp.so.1.0.18
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 166500 2007-10-05 20:56 libsane-plustek_pp.so.1.0.18
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     25 2007-12-11 01:40 libsane-plustek.so.1 ->
libsane-plustek.so.1.0.18
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 408392 2007-12-12 23:49 libsane-plustek.so.1.0.18
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 197740 2007-10-05 20:56 libsane-plustek.so.1.0.18.orig

I've tried building and using the latest plustek backend from the CVS
source snapshot, but the problem persists.  (The .orig files came
with Kubuntu 7.10.  The non .orig files are built from the CVS
snapshot.  Both exhibit the same problems.)

Symptoms:
. Preview scan in xsane scans the whole page.  However, full scan
  (with or without a previous preview) scans a portion.
. The scan head stops part way during the full scan and starts making
  an awful noise.
. The noise can be stopped by removing the power plug.
. Alternatively, the noise can be stopped by running scanimage -L
  one or more times.
. A further scan without stopping the noise results in a message
  that the scan was canceled even though I did not cancel the scan.

scanimage -L output:
device `plustek:libusb:001:011' is a Hewlett-Packard Scanjet 2200c flatbed scanner

The same hardware setup works perfectly with Windows XP.

I have an HP DeskJet D2360 USB printer.

In any case, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions on how
to get the scanner to work.

Thank you.

 See if this meets your need http://www.elgg.org/ . Also try searching

I'm not sure if Elgg is a good fit. It is just a glorified blog platform 
with some community features thrown in. I worked with it once (and 
discovered why some people can't stand php :D), and wasn't too happy 
with it's extensibility. I would suggest Drupal, if you can manage the 
beast. Some would also suggest Joomla!, but I can't express an opinion 
on it as I haven't worked with it directly.

Thanks folks.

How can I use drupal for a friends network.
what modules I have to use?

I need the following features.
1. multiple users
2. photo uploading
3. blogs for each user
4. comments
5. event calender

Help me on drupal to find the suitable modules.

Thanks,
T.Shrinivasan.

        Once you have installed and configured drupal, you can login
as the administrator and choose the modules you need. By default,
Drupal comes with most of the modules you have specified. Also, more
modules can be downloaded and added. All these module management will
be available in the administer link on the admin page.

hi,

I am getting a fair number of mails from people in Bangalore who want  
to learn/contribute to FOSS, and do not know where to refer them. I  
was wondering whether LUG members in Bangalore could form a Bangalore  
wing of ILUGC - like the Delhi guys have done. All you need to do is  
meet once a month (not on second saturday) so that any enquiries from  
Bangalore could be directed to you. I am sure Mahiti, SpikeSource or  
Yahoo! would be pleased to provide a space for you to meet. Other  
things like availability of resource persons for LDDs and college  
programs, CDs for grabs etc could be put up on a special section of  
the ILUGC website.

It is a good idea, but you can also point out to other groups already
in Bangalore like Bangalore Linux Users Group. They have monthly
meetings.

As part of NRCFOSS activities (and buttressed by the discussions we had at
VTU BoF during FOSS.IN), we intend to hold two meets of HoDs of computer
related depts -- one for Arts & Science colleges (early Jan?) and one for
engg colleges (3rd/4th week Jan?). Christ College had given provisional
offer to host NRCFOSS meets in Bangalore. The college group who had made
enquiries could give us the contact info -- HoDs / key persons name, email
id, phone, etc.

We could also make a display of FOSS projects (LDD variety or student
projects that are alive) during these meets. The guys who organized the BoF
were willing to take lead. Others could contribute.

Message-ID: <d16b1c80712150530v66b8dc52x3e0aaefef2c26d77@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was able to get a 30-minute session during the "VLSI-Trends and
Applications" to talk about FOSS VLSI tools, conducted by the
Department of Physics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, today, Saturday,
December 15, 2007. Thanks to Jagan Vemula (Qvantel), and Dr. Lingam
Reddy (Professor, Department of Physics, OU) for their help in this
regard.

I did a short 10-minute presentation (with screenshots):
http://shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/vlsi-foss-1.0.odp
http://shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/vlsi-foss-1.0.pdf

I then gave them a demo of VHDL examples, and showed them FOSS project
websites (opencores.org, and opencollector.org).
http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/embedded-howto/

As usual students didn't ask any questions during the session, but,
had a long offline Q&A and discussion after the session. Some photos:

Message-ID: <d16b1c80712150608y32e550dbu30683e6d05ae84e6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

So, I registered for this event http://www.twincling.org/osru, and
didn't get any confirmation e-mail. Some of my friends who registered
late, got an e-mail that they couldn't be alloted because of space
constraints.

But the FAQ said that one can come on the event day, and IT
professionals could pay Rs. 150, and students could pay Rs. 50 and can
join in (now that has been changed in the website).

But, the website still says:

"This is a FREE-of-charge event.

However prior registration at http://www.twincling.org/osru is required. "
http://www.twincling.org/node/180

Being subscribed to the mailing list for few months, technical e-mail
posts to the group doesn't get posted to the group and don't show-up
here:

http://www.mail-archive.com/twincling@yahoogroups.com/

OR here:

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/twincling/

E-mail queries regarding the above to info@twincling.org were not returned.

So, I make a last minute attempt to attend the event, and as quoted in
the website (now that has been changed to registration closed) was
ready to pay Rs. 150 to join in, but, they said 'sorry' and there is
room only for 150 people, and we cannot take in more.

But, the number of registered candidates here is only 140:
http://www.twincling.org/node/188

But, I really, really felt bad for the students who showed up there
(with pens and notebooks) to get some exposure to what was happening
in this FOSS world. I could see the big disappointment in them. I feel
sorry for them, and that I couldn't be of much help to them there.

I returned empty-handed.

SK

Message-ID: <def372aa0712170749w6b007478v210e9dc9c607863c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have Fc 6 on a HP Pavllion dv 6000. I am able to listen to music on the
built in speakers.The inbuilt mic doesn't work and when connecting external
speakers I don't get the sound on the external speakers  thought my built in
speakers continue to work.

After searching on the internet, came to know I had to upgrade alsa drivers.
I downloaded the latest version and alsa-drivers and als-libs and did as
mentioned in the README. But /proc/asound/version still shows me the old
version.

What have I missed ? Do I need to recompile the kernel ?

That wouldn't be required.

# yum install mercurial
# hg clone http://hg.alsa-project.org/alsa-driver alsa-driver
# cd alsa-driver
# ./cvscompile
# make install

Since Fedora Core 6 reached end of life 
(http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/LifeCycle) last week, the best way to get 
updated ALSA drivers is just to upgrade a more recent release of Fedora.

Hi,

 This is not to start another flame war. We have had this debate
earlier and when I saw this blog nicely summarising  the issue, I
thought I should share it here.

http://www.matusiak.eu/numerodix/blog/index.php/2007/12/15/gpl-vs-bsd-a-matter-of-sustainability/

There are many ILUGC guys in Bangalore, some of whom are already
involved in LUGs around here, especially in some colleges. And if
required others can surely pitch in to support them. It would be nice
if such inquiries are forwarded to this list so we can know of people
looking for us :)

printer's option is : coral draw or pagemaker

printing from pdf may not be a good option -- unless the printer has edit
facilities. it may be preferable to take from eps. anyway, the logos could
be taken directly from the image files and incorporated into the final
document.

You can use this for all kind of conversions like extracting audio

You have to have the mp3lame codec package installed.

Fedora package is lame, on Mandriva see this

Hi,

May I suggest that you have a link for "Request for talk" along with
"Add talk" at http://registration.fossconf.in/web/.

Audience would also like to be able to request what they would like to
hear, rather than just come to hear what the speakers have to offer?

Probably somebody from B'lore could find out from places like Printo and 
Staples Store - pdf should be fine by them. It's  a shame Chennai 
doesn't have one of those.

Does not Student Xerox do the same thing as Printo for pre-formatted doc?

Aanjhan and Shakthi Kannan have given their presentations here.
Aanjhan is quite involved with thie BMS LUG. As Vikram Vincent is now
associated with Christ College, think he will also be a good contact.

What is the problem with the PDF file.
Any DTP Center can take print out from a PDF file.
They have Acrobat Reader.

even, if you want to print from a native scribus format,
they will accept to install scribus on their machine.

I tried and it works too.

$ ffmpeg -i foo.ogg foo.mp3

There is more than one way to skin a cat.

$ sox foo.ogg foo.mp3

$ ogg2mp3 foo.ogg

Multiple pass method.

$ oggdec foo.ogg

$ lame -b 112 foo.wav foo.mp3

There are also other mp3 encoders (excluding ffmpeg) called toolame and
twolame. There is bladeenc but I hear it is not that good.

Of course you can use transcode(1) and mencoder(1) for the same purpose
with the null video input switch.

Let me know if you need to get anything to be printed at Printo for

As we intend to do as much as possible, if not all, in FOSS way let us look
for the printer who can take scribus / eps outputs and get the stuff
printed.

However, we are in real world and need to follow certain admin norms (set by
Anna University).
Currently, we need to concentrate on brochures and initial set of posters.
Hence, we need quotations for :

a) Multicolor brochure (A4 size) 170 gsm art paper without
lamination                  5000 copies

b) 2-Color Posters (A3 size) 170 GMS art paper single side
printing                     5000 copies
c) Multi color Posters (A3 size) 170 GMS art paper single side
printing                5000 copies

The quotation, in the printer's letterhead, should be addressed to :
     The Director, AU-KBC Research Centre
      MIT Campus, Anna University
      Chromepet, Chennai 600 044

It is also advisable to attach a sample set (a sample brochure, the art
paper, etc.)
Any of you could collect the quotation and send it across to me. I hope you
will also discuss the mechanism for proof reading, delivery of printerd
materials (4-5 days?), etc.

thanks and best wishes,
Srinivasan, NRCFOSS.

While there are many tools to do this, this is in general not a good 
idea since you would have a definite loss of quality converting from one 
  lossy format to another.

If you are ripping, rip into lossless formats like FLAC initially and 
then use it for conversion into other lossy formats like Ogg Vorbis for 
general usage.

Can anyone help me about installing packages in Linux?? I don't have net
connection at home, so i manually download all the packages from net. The
problem is when i try to install any package then it asks for dependency.
After downloading all dependency it even doesn't work, because these
dependencies have another dependency :-(.

Is there any way so that i can download packages (.rpm /.deb /.tar.gz/
tar.bz2 etc.) with all dependencies??

provided the user has dvd reader, he can choose to add the Ubuntu 7.10 DVD as 
repository and install packages from it.

even then the Ubuntu DVD do not have packages from the Universe and Multiverse

if that can be obtained and be put in another storage medium and added 
to /etc/apt/sources.list then it can help solving the problem in Ubuntu to a

Message-ID: <68ddcb070712181043g3bc66e24hf37fbc136549a537@mail.gmail.com>

dear kg and other friends,

have worked extensively with scribus, pdf, and postscript, and spent a
considerable time of my professional years working at pre-press and
press bureau.
so here's how we do this:

author your brochure in scribus.
output as pdf. hyou may choose pdf x-3 as your 'flavour' of pdf.
this flavour of pdf is recommended for pre-press and gets your job out
without hiccups or errors.

even if you don't wish to use pdf x-3, choose the 'pdf for printer'
flavour. it's called 'Output intended for' in the tabbed dialogs of
scribus' pdf output button. you'll probably find it in the 'color'
tab.

beyond this point, the onus lies on your pre-press bureau or printing
plant to get you a proof print from this pdf.
typically, the bureau would have a commercial/professional version of
adobe acrobat, under which a soft-proof of this pdf is checked, and
print-specific technical features like overinking and other issues are
cross-checked.

then, the bureau should provide you with a match-print proof. this may
be a digital printout of this file that closely matches the final
printed brochure. if you okay this, the bureau should go ahead and
offset-print the brochure to deliver you the requested copies.

so if the bureau does not have acrobat professional or does not know
how to handle pdf files, and insists on corel or illustrator or
ventura files?
you've gone to the wrong bureau in 2007.
maybe it is not even a pre-press or repro house.

the migration in the printing industry towards pdf-based workflows
started in 1997. all other forms of workflows preceding pdf-based
workflows have been summarily abandoned long, long ago.
scribus adheres to professional printing standards in its pdf workflows.
please do read my scribus tutorial on the scribus documentation site
or elsewhere, on how to how to handle pdf workflows.

hope this helps.

side-note: before we all jump into a merry discussion around foss and
non-foss software, please do appreciate we're actually talking about
workflows in another industry, namely the printing industry. what they
adopt are professional standards and workflows. if those standards and
workflows are adhered to using foss tools, technologies, and values,
is up to the market forces and policy-decision summits the foss
community can impact. hence fossconf feb 2008 possibly, among several
other initiatives, in our ICT industry.

I hope the question is rhetorical.  It is better to digitize in FLAC 
format (assuming you have enough disk space) if the intent is to 
archive your music and then convert it to whatever format your portable 
playback device supports.

 On a secondary note, I have used eps output from scribus and
inkscape, to get brocheures printed. Only difference is the printing
is done using digital printing  and not offset.  Depending on the
level of machine handler, you might be presented with silly requests
like "fonts need to be curved" etc. These requests can be handled
easily with respective softwrares.

There must be couple of digital printing press in Chennai too.
As for offset printing, only large printing press have pdf based
workflow. So please check with the printer, if he can handle pdf or
not. From personal experience, almost all printers can handle eps
files, by exporting the eps file to c0rel.

I keep hearing that the colleges insist on "IEEE projects" -- implementation
of some paper / standards /,,,, Again, preference in many cases is for
"system projects" rather than application projects.

Would like to know from others interacting with students -- is it the case?
If so, we could have a set of projects for final-semester students. The 2nd
and 3rd year -- who are our potential targets -- could be coaxed to work
without any such restrictions and contribute to application development.

On most GNU/Linux systems ogg will play by default. On Windows and
Macs VLC can play ogg. See playogg.org

It can be easily setup to work with Windows Media Player after
installing the codec from http://www.vorbis.com/setup_windows/

We can do our bit to increase the quantum. My general idea is to
(a) choose a title which broadly fits into the "IEEE" and/or other college
requirements
     and work out a plan for a decent project
(b) guide the students to do at least a partial work -- make it up (using
stubs and drivers) to simulate a full capability. This will be submitted as
the project fulfilling the exam requirements.
(c) coax the students to complete the task -- by themselves or using their
juniors / others.

last year we had an experience with 3 students from Velammal College -- they
completed the full stuff working during May-June (after their final exams.).

First untar it. It can be directly removed from tar as well but this is
more convenient. 

Then type this.

If the directory name is samba/

$ find samba/ -name "*.exe" -type f | xargs rm

But please be careful not to delete system executables.

Ensure this with

$ find samba/ -name "*.exe" -type f -print | less

Best of luck!

Please be careful.

Thanks.

Hi,

A friend of mine is looking for a freelance programmer who can work
with an interesting project in Drupal/PHP. Interested people may
contact him directly. Details regarding the project are as follows.

*if not able to reach him, do not mind pinging me :)

- -------- Original Message --------


*Developer working in PHP needed for Khoj Studios*

 Khoj is an international artist led initiative based out of Delhi
that concentrates on cutting edge art practices and collaborating
artists and organisations from Asia to build a strong platform of
contemporary art practices in the region. As a part of its extended
outreach and ambition to reach out to new and remotely located
artists, Khoj is looking at building a strong online presence that
enables artist participation for community building and extensive
professional networking with other Khoj nodes in the networks.

 The Khoj CRECHE (Comprehensive Resource for E-Community Hosting and
Expansion) project was envisioned a year ago to achieve these
ambitions. In one year, it has completed the first of the three phases
of implementation (www.khojworkshop.org
<http://www.khojworkshop.org/>) using PHP based Drupal CMS. We are
looking at young and motivated programmers who have experience working
with Drupal or are comfortable with PHP and can work with Drupal to
implement the second phase of the CRECHE project at extremely
competitive market rates. The programmer can be based in or outside of
Delhi and can agree to work full-time or part-time depending upon
their time availability.

 
If you are interested in the project, please get in touch with

 Pooja Sood (Phone: +91-11-65655874, +91-11-65655873.

You can fire up Synaptic in Ubuntu, Select the packages that you need to
install, and then Go to File -> Generate Package download script. 
This creates a script with calls to wget to download all the packages.
Run this on a machine that has internet connectivity and get the
packages locally and install them.

Also, you might want to look at apt-offline or pypt-offline.

To ensure the credibility of final year students from the graduation
perspective and to do justice to the final year projects, we have to resort
to major publications such as IEEE. Having said that, open source projects
are also equally treated, provided the students convince the panel members
about what the project is all about. Infact, I only take students who is
interested in opensource, and the response from the student side, so far is
phenomenal. And this is the third consecutive year, I'm mentoring the
students completely in the area of open source.

This is incorrect. Ubuntu is Debian based, and in these systems, cc
should be symlinkes to a C compiler.

e.g.
[kumar@debian] ls -l /usr/bin/cc
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20 2005-09-25 20:29 /usr/bin/cc -> /etc/alternatives/cc

I really don't know how this happened, but you can (re)install the
build-essential package (or even gcc) to check if the problem
recurs. But copying gcc to cc is not a solution.

        I must report that I have been unable to get it to work on
 Debian, but not because I can't play oggs (all my music is in ogg). The
 problem I face is that the Play button is unclickable (on pages like

Well, you can restore the alternative using update-alternatives. On my
machine, for example:

[kumar@debian ~] sudo update-alternatives --config cc
There is only 1 program which provides cc
(/usr/bin/gcc). Nothing to configure.

So, I just have that:
[kumar@debian ~] ls -l /etc/alternatives/cc
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 12 2007-12-20 00:16 /etc/alternatives/cc -> /usr/bin/gcc

So, you can try running update-alternatives like I have done, and
choose gcc. Else, manually fix the issue merely by symlinking
/usr/bin/cc to /etc/alternatives/cc and ensure that
/etc/alternatives/cc is symlinked to /usr/bin/gcc.

HTH.

Because you are copying, and even though you call it cc, the
executable is still the same gcc.

<audio> tag should be a solution here (I tried it but it is not
working as of now :-( ) as anyway there is no support for IE. But I

There's two ways to embed Ogg Audio AKA Vorbis in a web page:
* the <audio> tag of HTML 5, but it works only in the Firefox and Opera browsers
* the Cortado player, which works everywhere and it's easy to
configure, but computers need to have the Java engine installed (if
the computer uses OpenOffice.org then it has Java support)

Alternative ways are to tell them to use Winamp in Windows, or install
the codecs for Windows Media Player/Quicktime.

The same advice also works for Ogg Video AKA Theora, except instead of
the <audio> tag, one would use the <video> tag.  Windows Media Player
and Quicktime can also work with Ogg Video if the codecs are
installed[1][2].

> If we want to see people using ogg we need to make sure it works everywhere.

This is true, but Mr. Praveen, there's one thing you need to
understand, Ogg is not backed by a big corporation.  Ogg is supported
by the common people like you, and if the common people don't do their
contribution to make sure Ogg works everywhere, then Ogg dies.  The
most important contribution is to publish and share Ogg files on the
Internet and in real life.

People in the neighborhood have come to know me as a "computer expert" who can
help them with their computers. I cleaned up a neighbors Windows 98 computer
the other day. He was using Internet Explorer 6 to browse the web until I
installed Opera.

I don't care what's in HTML 5. It's a non issue if you want to embed media in
web pages until or unless you can expect 90% - not 0.9% like today - of the
people visiting your site to have a browser with support for it.

Everybody, even the guy next door with Win98, have flash installed, and - I
hate to say this - that is what you should be using if you really need to
embed the video in the browser. There are many excellent flash players who
can embed *MP3* files into web pages and that's what you should be doing IF
you want the OGG file embedded in a web page.

If you think it is acceptable to add a "Click here to download" link and add
the text "Then open the file in your favorite ogg/ogm compatible player" then
do use Ogg Vorbis / Theora.

Most people don't have Java installed. I don't, and I never will.

Yeah, yeah, Ogg For The Win, etc. But you got to be honest.

You can provide a simple download link to Ogg files and explain how to
obtain/install some players for it. If you really, really need to have audio
embedded into web pages then you can forget Ogg and use a flashplayer which
plays a MP3 file, or forget about it.

Do feel free to correct me if there actually IS a way to put a Ogg file into a
web page which allows 90+% of your visitors to play it. I'd sure as hell like
to know how. And I don't give a crap about oh it's so sad that nobody cares
about Ogg and no corporation supports it and blah blah blah....

The question was "We have someone here trying to embed ogg files in web page
(language lessons) (..) Can anyone help here?" and the answer is NO, you
can't, provide a download link or don't use Ogg.

source code is there on the site - if it clicks in mandriva, suse,

Ah, xiando.  I remember you, so-called "computer expert" who after not
being able to make sense of ffmpeg2theora went on to try and spread
FUD about it.  You are also the guy who spends his time writing about
conspiracy theories and how people should pirate porn to save the
environment.  You are a fucking wacko, and I'm not surprised to see
you here.

For the record, I told Mr.Praveen about the solution for Ogg embeding
the Wikimedia Foundation is using in Wikipedia and other places, which
is a mix of Cortado and HTML 5 <video><audio>.  Their fallback in case
the user doesn't have either an HTML5 browser nor Java is indeed to
provide a direct link to the file, but only as a last resort.  So,
embeding Ogg does indeed work.

You would do best in helping out those who are trying to make the
world a better place.  Who knows, maybe people would take you
seriously for once.  If you can't be bothered don't get in the way.
It's just annoying.

I wasn't aware there is one 'latest and greatest distro'. I am merely 
reporting the issue. I have no idea what's wrong and it is not my site 
to debug. It might be even be something to do with the browser and 
version. I am currently running Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.10 on Fedora 8. If 
you need more information, let me know.

And for the record, the play button is not clickable on IE6/FF3 on
Windows XP as well - I think it is because these browsers does not
have plugins to handle ogg (firefox offers to search for plugins but
can't find one).

there isn't - the ubuntu fanbhois have now evolved from thinking the

That would the case with software but I wouldn't necessarily including 
websites in it. Besides I am providing a detailed bug report and offered 
to give you more information to help debug the problem.  Since it's been 
a long while since I worked on websites, I am not going to attempt to 
fix the problem myself.

I was able to play these after installing mozilla-mplayer package. It
is just that (though important) Debian and Fedora did not install
these browser plugins by default. In fact Debian had totem-mozilla by
default and which would have sufficed most users (not in this case for
sure). I HATE TOTEM. It gets installed by default on every distro and
it can't play anything (for anything useful with you have install
totem-xine, and I think debian does that by default) .

So install any media-player plugin in Fedora and try.

Fedora doesn't include Mplayer in any form in the official repository 
since it is difficult to separate the non-free or patent encumbered 
portions from other portions of Mplayer but third party repositories 
provide those.

This really is a matter of plugins and the media framework. Nowadays 
most players are wrappers around the media frameworks they support. 
Totem supports both gstreamer and Xine framework with distributions 
usually having the gstreamer backend as default. It supports Free 
formats out of the box but you would need additional plugins for other 
formats. With gstreamer, you would need gstreamer-plugins-bad and 
gstreamer-plugins-ugly.

> So install any media-player plugin in Fedora and try.

IIRC totem-mozplugin is installed by default in Fedora but I seem to 
have removed it at some point but Mplayer browser plugin is already 
installed and handles ogg files in other websites but not in Ncrfoss 
one. I tried installing totem plugin as well as the Xine player plugin 
but nothing seems to have resolved this issue.

I have confirmed the same problem in another system running OpenSUSE 
10.3 with Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.11 with the VLC and Totem browser 
plugins installed FYI.

I think Mandriva provides mplayer by default.

lawgon,
Is mplayer and mplayer plugin installed by default in Mandriva?

Those were the times when you didn't know all these details (and still
many of those I don't know) and there are many out there who does not
know these details. That is why there should be sane defaults. It was
good for debian to have defaulted to totem-xine and installed
totem-mozilla (though it didn't work in this particular case).

I tried to rebuild with one more mime type which was missing in totem
but present in mplayer, but it didn't work.

I think instead of a label there should be a button for the play function. Right
now with a label, there is no feedback if the page element has been clicked
other than the sound playing which is not guaranteed.

I installed mplayerplug-in from livna but it still didn't play. I was

The point of contact for ILUGC is:
Saravanan,
Lynus Academy.

The point of contact for NRCFOSS is:
Dr Srinivasan S,
Project Scientist, NRCFOSS, MIT, Chennai.
Email: sponsorship@fossconf.in

I think. we need not bother who is talking to whom as long as the deal
is closed by any one of the above two persons.

/etc/alternatives/README tells me to read man
update-alternatives. That has good explanation of this concept.

* Lua, Lua, Oh, Oh

Compiled programming languages and scripting languages each have
unique advantages, but what if you could use both to create rich
applications? Lua is an embeddable scripting language that is small,
fast, and very powerful. Before you create yet another configuration
file or resource format (and yet another parser to accompany it), try
Lua.

* Manageability Technologies in Kernel, User Space, and Beyond

Managing a Linux system can be as easy as connecting to a remote

remote systems, and many Linux admins do work in environments with
hundreds or even thousands of systems.

Nice effort. You seem to get enough free time :)

Anyway, I would say it's overkill to have so many mailing lists! Why
would we need a mailing list for FOSS Bangalorians who are from
Chennai ? :) If any of us (ILUGC members) receive any emails to
conduct sessions and/or talks in educational institutes in and around
Bangalore, we should direct those requests to blug. Interested
volunteers can become part of blug to render their service. It is

Quoting my previous mail to the thread ,

<quote>

It would be nice
if such inquiries are forwarded to this list so we can know of people
looking for us :)
</quote>

Let me just see how things proceed and how much this group is made use
of. This is not another mailing list in any way,
its just a point where people can contact if at all they need a
help/support/resource very specific to Bangalore and around,
and they do not want to post in the ilugc mailing list.

SriRamados should understand how annoying it is for those who do not know Tamil!

Probably does or atleast would be in the repository. They don't have to

Xine would have the exact same problem if a distribution doesn't support 
patent encumbered formats. The multimedia framework doesn't change that 
situation.

the list . :)

We can understand asking for english translation but why ask for HINDI
translation ?????
If someone asks for translation in hindi, then Ramadas has every right to
ask for translation in tamil too :)

Who told Hindi is the only national language ?
Have ever read the constitution ?
If possible try to show me(and others in the list) a proof that constitution
tells that  "Hindi is the only National language"

For your info, hindi has only one special status. It was proposed to replace
english with hindi as "official and communication language" for Indian Govt.

But that proposal was dropped later after protests from states like Tamil
Nadu.  English usage as official language of india continues and hindi also
is used as official language in hindi speaking states.
thats all..
other than the above there is no special status to hindi over other
"National languages of India" like tamil, malayalam, telugu, bengali etc...

May be you can read the following links:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_languages_of_India
http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/const.html (can read online here)
http://india.gov.in/govt/constitutions_india.php ( you can download pdf
formats)

I hope you understand my previous mail now  :)

Debian faced this same problem and it solved it only recently. I think
Fedora can use debian's version (stripped with no known patent
encumbered bits) if they want to. It took more than 7 years to enter
debian and that too after mplayer did an audit of their code for any
patent infringements.

Any sites that use embed tag? You can download ogg files and many use

Debian is more concerned about copyright and what they did as well as 
what was done within the Mplayer development team was primary a 
copyright license audit and not a patent audit. Refer

http://people.debian.org/~mjr/legal/mplayer.html

If you are a non-profit, a patent holder can merely ask you to stop 
distribution until the patent issues are resolved but otherwise a claim 
of monetary damages can be made which may run into millions of dollars.

Debian being a legally established non-profit via SPI has ignored 
potential patent issues several times in the past and they even ship a 
MP3 decoder in their base distribution. While the Debian work is useful 
as regards to copyright licenses, their work cannot be treated as 
authoritative when it comes to patents.

Totem has been using both these frameworks for a very long time and even

Not sure. If you have any websites that embed ogg video and does not use 
java applets, let me know and I will check that.

Subject: [Ilugc] lua script to download youtube videos
Message-ID: <20071222020407.GA24669@brahma.susmita.org>

First of all this script was written by erstwhile OpenBSD developer
Pedro Martelleto.

You might have to take care of dependencies. It does an amazing job.

Take a look at the power of lua.

I love lua but I know nothing about it. ;)

Play with it and enjoy.

Dear all,

Please see

It is very important to dive into the source code to understand
programming and RFCs for understanding networking and protocols.

This site goes a long way in achieving the goal.

Best of luck!

i think we are loosing track. and it should not result in personal vendatta. 

A bangalore mailing list need to have place for Kannada, Hyderabad mailing 
list need to have place for Telugu, Thiruvanthapuram mailing list have place 
for Malayalam, Madhya Pradesh list have place for Hindi, Gujrat for Gujrathi, 
Kashmir for Kashmiri etc.,

I owe not to annoy anyone bye sending mails in Tamil, to a list with base in 
Bangalore, Hyderabad, Bhopal, Gandhinagar, New Delhi, Tiruvananthapuram. 

If I join any such list and see mails in that language, I respect them, and I 
will take it as an opportunity to learn that language and mingle with that 
people than to expect and alienate myself from them saying that they have to 
give up their individuality for the sake of few migrants (assuming thats me 
here). 

Gone are those days when we were dreaming that our language will someday been 
seen in computers and hence we were/ might have been using English. That 
dependency is no more and the doors should be open now. 

I sincerely suggest Bangalore mailing list to start discussing in Kannada, 
Kerala mailing list to start discussing in Malayalam, etc.,

All that I can say to people who posts against this are missing the point.  I 
welcome more people to post in Tamil to this mailing list. and I have 
concluded on this topic in this list forever.

I would disagree with that. Every since the first
computer was invented it was thinking in Binary. I
suggest that we speak on this list only in binary and
any other languages and number bases other than 2 be
banned.:-)
   Other than that, it is a good idea to promote
English, on any of the mailing lists even for those
who are not well versed in English. The idea of
localization of regional languages should be to help
that generation of people in India who missed out the
opportunity to learn English and aid them with the use
of computers. At least, the new generation of emerging
students should be encouraged to learn English for
their social and economic well being.

I owe not to annoy anyone bye sending mails in Tamil,

 That

I sincerely suggest Bangalore mailing list to start

Kerala mailing list to start discussing in Malayalam,

All that I can say to people who posts against this

welcome more people to post in Tamil to this mailing
list. and I have 
concluded on this topic in this list forever.

Live and let live seems to be a nice catchy saying.  The only time I
end up getting these mails in Tamil is when someone posts a long reply
to someone I have blocked.  Maybe the solution is to ask the LUG how
to set up email filters if you don't know how to do so yourself.
Everyone is happy that way. :)

I agree with Ramdass here..  How can we bring our language to computers, if
we ourselves are not ready to use it?

The important practical point here is that, if we strive to localise
computers, then we should be the first one, who should use it in our
languages.

And for the sake of localisation, we need not neglect english too.  The
point is that one should learn both english and our mother tongue, and
should be trained to use computers in both.

To quote an example, we have seen lot of websites in dutch, or french or
german languages..  Some of the mailing lists are too in such languages.  It
doesnt mean that they dont know english.  But they prefer to use the
language which they would understood firsthand, rather than to use english
and them translate and understand.

My points are:

1. We should strive to use corresponding language in local mailing list. (In
chennai lug, tamil)
2. We should strive to use Hindi for National Communication.
3. In case Hindi is not familiar, then we can use english.

This is unthinkable as of now, because, none of us are trained to read mails
in tamil..  But, if at all we want to bring about dignity, indigneous, and
to bring our mother tongu in computers, we should be ready to bring them in
to our daily life.  and this does not necessary be at the cost of english..

There would be lot of problems initially, but if more people are committed
then it will become used to us.

Regards,
Senthil

There is a small part of readers who cannot read Tamil
here. Almost all users here are comfortable with
English as a medium of communication. The purpose of
having a mailing list like this(in my opinion) is to
share your knowledge and reply to topics of your
interest. Once the medium of communication changes to
anything other than English, we have no clue of whats
going on here.
    Most people come here to get educated and help
others with free/open source software. I just don't
see how learning linux in English is any less
dignified than learning it in any of the Indian
languages. As far as it appears, one should go with
the language most of the readers can follow.
    Dignity is in sharing your knowledge in a medium
that can be followed by majority of the readers.

In the installation phase, it is not detecting the network card.

It does not matter. If this site does not work, no other site
embedding ogg will work (assuming there is no issue with the ogg files
itself). I don't know of any other sites using embedding (mostly use
java applet, flash or direct download).

kerala is India's most non-cosmopolitan state. Migrant population is  
practically nil. It cannot be compared to places like Chennai, Mumbai

What kind of problem u faced? Is that the ethernet card is detected? try
with 'dmesg | grep "eth0" ' then see whether kernel detects your ethernet or
not.

I had a problem when configuring network. But for me, the card is detected
but dhcpcd failed to configure my network. I use the above command to
confirm ethernet card detected.

then I tried the below commands

ifconfig eth0 down
rmmod 8139too
modprobe 8139too media=0x01
ifconfig eth0 up
dhcpcd

thats all my network configured. My card is RTL 8139(Real Talk).

P5GC-MX has an Attansic Ethernet chipset.
Driver support for Attansic based boards were added recently to the 
linux kernel,
and is now part of the mainline tree under the name atl1.
Debian Etch has an older kernel ( 2.6.18 ? ) which I think doesn't 
include atl1.
You can either manually upgrade the kernel or try compiling the vendor 
provided driver.
The vendor driver can be obtained from : 
ftp://hogchain.net/pub/linux/attansic/vendor_driver/
The choice is up to you.

Message-ID: <809586140712230441n20b16d0bka2f4a8472a26cadb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Luggies,

I recently bought a ATI AIW 9600 Series card and upgraded to 1GB RAM.
I am very much interested to try out 3D desktop (Beryl/Compiz Fusion).
Please do suggest me whether my hardware is sufficient to proceed. I
am having problem with the display driver.

I have tried both the open source radeon driver and the ATI's
proprietary fglrx driver. I have a doubt whether I will be able to run
3D desktops. Today, I installed Google Earth on my machine running
CentOs 4.4 with both the drivers. GE runs fine for sometime with the
fglrx driver (ATI Catalyst 7.1.2, the one released on Dec 19 2007),
but hangs after sometime. where as with the OS radeon driver the
display is damm slow.

I get the following FPS

radeon - glxgears - 300FPS
fglrx - glxgears - 2600FPS and fgl_glxgears - 600 FPS

I am forced to use windows with this card. Can, anyone tell when can I
enjoy my graphics card under linux.

You can use compix fusion with the fglrx driver.
It might take a little tinkering with xorg.conf to get things running 
smoothly.
And AIGLX is unsupported, though I believe it has been added in the 
recent catalyst drivers.

Or, if you are willing to take the plunge, you can give the experimental 
driver 'radeonhd' a try.
radeonhd is the new open source driver that is in development.

And, why are you forced to use Windows ? :)

Subject: [Ilugc] [JOB] Intern with Python skills & Web designer
Message-ID: <476F42B5.50508@gmail.com>

Hi,

We are Viamentis Technologies, a small web development company based out 
of Chennai. We provide cutting-edge product development services for 
several web 2.0 startups across the world (mostly using Ruby on Rails).

Recently we got an unusual request from one of our local clients - she 
wanted us to modify a fairly popular open source python learning tool 
for their internal use. The changes seem to be extensive, so there is a 
good chance that some of the work can be contributed back to the project.

Since we don't have any Pythonistas among our colleagues, we thought 
inviting a final year student over and offering him a project would be a 
good idea to learn it along with him/her. We also pay a small stipend to 
students who are working with us.

So if you are a student looking for a real-world final year project, 
which will be important to the client's day-to-day work, drop us a line. 
If the client is happy with your work, apart from getting a certificate 
of completion from us, we will also arrange for a letter of appreciation 
from the client. I don't know how useful it is going to be, but I hope 
it helps :).

What are we looking for? Self-starters, who have good Python knowledge, 
who are passionate about technology and can learn new things on their 
own. What do you get in return? A caring and encouraging work 
environment that always challenges you to do better, and respects your 
individuality (seriously, we allow shorts in our office).

You will get the same treatment we give to our full-timers. And probably 
help convert a few Rubyists into the Python camp. Write to us at: intern 
at viamentis d0t com. What's more, if you really shake things up here, 
there maybe a job offer waiting for you at the end of the project.

Next, we are looking for a web designer to work with us on a an 
consultant/hourly basis - you should be able to talk & walk the web 2.0 
design lingo well - rounded corners, drop shadows, css sprites, XHTML, 
css, etc. If you're good, we pay well. If you're really good, there 
might be a job offer waiting you at the end of the assignment. Please 
write us at: webdesigner at viamentis d0t com. (If you can also point to 
your work online or attach some of your previous work, it would be 
great). If you're a fresher to web design but you think you have some 
talent and willing to learn fast, show us your work, we could talk.


Thanks much,
Vamsee Kanakala
Viamentis Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

 Wel some of the books mentioned in the link do not have a disclaimer
that they can be  distributed freely. Only handfull of the books in
the specified link, carry either a notice allowing free download of
GPL/Gnu FDL license.

 So should we count it as piracy ?

This is a major issue here..  That's why i said, we will face lot of
challenges initially..

Probably,  those who dont know tamil in chennai LUG, can put effort to learn
it, and participate in discussion..

But anything should not be forced..  If there is no unanimous decision, its
better to put it off.

Please remember, this is not about dignity or something else.  Let's look it
as an opportunity to bring our mother tongue in to practice.

My personal opinion is that we cannot bring about change JUST by learning..
instead, we have to put in to practice what we want to bring about.

Instead of getting "Can or Cannot", let's just look in to feasibities of
this option.. If its not feasible as of now, let's wait for some more time
till a consensus is reached.

My practical solutions:

1. Those who are in ILUG-Chennai, but dont know tamil, can strive to learn
it.  After all, its one of the languages of our country.. (if we are willing
to learn french/german etc for money, there's no reason why we should not
learn our own languages.

2. If any one is in Calcutta, and part of Calcutta mailing list, let him
learn Bengali..  and let other members help him on that.


Where there is a will, there is a way.. :)

REgards,
senthil

I guess there's wide open spaces outside ILUGC to put one's mother
tongue into practice.

Ok, this is really getting tiresome. First of all, the discussion is no 
longer related to its' title. And this is such a tired old topic that I 
don't even read fully when I see something like "we should use Tamil/why 
use Tamil". Bang, delete. But sometimes, just sometimes, it just gets to 
you.

<rant on>I'm all for learning Tamil - coming from a different part of 
the country, I really make an effort to learn the language. I feel proud 
when somebody compliments that I'm picking it up fast. But I get put off 
when somebody else suggests that I "should" do so, there is no harm in 
learning the language of the land, blah blah. Especially so, in a 
technical forum.

I come here to gain or if possible spread knowledge about Linux/Foss, 
not get lectured about learning a regional language. Whether I learn a 
language or not is my own business. I learn it when I think it is an 
advantage to do so. Otherwise, I won't. So everybody stop tooting their 
horns about their love for regional language, everybody loves their own 
mother tongue/regional language, and nobody is doing any other person a 
favor picking up a particular language. If it is useful, they will pick 
it up. Otherwise, not.

I fail to understand the logic of suggesting people learn the language, 
because I am always considerate enough to talk in English even if there 
is one colleague that doesn't understand our conversation, even if there 
are 10 others who do. It seems like such a minimal civility. If you are 
sadistic/bigoted enough to write in a script that you know some people 
won't understand, please do so. We will roll our eyes and continue to 
ignore the mails. But don't tell me to learn it, because you have no 
business doing so.</rant off>

There. I feel better now.

There are many. One  being writing email in Tamil to someone whom knows Tamil.
 As you said, if there's will - there's way , so you explore the rest.

You could also setup Tamil only FOSS forum, blog etc. Create Tamil
Translation of HOW-TOs, README's etc.

Why bother other's life by using a  non-common language in an  attempt
to promote one's native language.

        Is there any data on how many people who are not local are
 present on this mailing list?  Such people might find it harder to
 learn Tamil; but their input might be important as well.

        I suppose the mailing list has to consider the trade-off;
 between the relative merit of the input of non Tamil speaking people,
 the ease of taking a discussion to another forum (LKML, for instance),
 and the need to be more inclusive to people who are not familiar with
 English, and who would be brought into the fold is the Lingua Franca
 was Tamil.

        I have no idea what the numbers might look like, or what the
 relative benefits to the membership would be like; but most of the
 discussion I have seen seems to not have delved into the issue of the
 impact of the decision.  For instance, the statement above that those
 who do not know Language A can just learn it might not be a viable
 solution to many people (and yes, that is true for people saying that
 respondents should just learn English as well.)

        While I read this mailing list, I am not anywhere close to
 Chennai -- I live in the US, and I merely monitor this list in case
 there are questions people have about Debian/free software that I could
 help with. Learning Tamil in Tennessee is harder than you would think
 (and my inclination would be to go with Spanish, Greek, or Sanskrit
 first, given the utility that the learning would bring me given where I
 live).

able to generate any traffic on the blog - neither organic nor

good tips that can start giving some immediate results.

Your mail is quite frank and sincere.

There are some really successful people in this respect in LUG. There is
Shrinivasan T who is running http://fossjobs.wordpress.com. He says he
gets very impressive hit statistics there. His
http://goinggnu.wordpress.com site is doing very well too.

I have no experience creating or running popular websites but I would
guess the general principles of life apply. The cyber world is just a
projection of real world. 

The key idea can be summed up in two sentences.

"Help others so others help you and come to you for help. Building
goodwill is the basis of all success."

Another thing you need to know about economics on the Internet. The
typical MBA attitude of money, money, money will not work.

Unless you give knowledge, software, artwork whatever; your labor of
love for free, your site will never be popular. Internet economy is by
nature a free economy. One person cannot change it.

If you have content on your blog that others benefit by visiting your
site, automatically with time your site will become popular. google will
pick it up and you will start making ad revenue(in case you are
interested in this).

You should also wait patiently for the most effective marketing strategy
on earth - "the word of mouth" propagation to take place.

"Word of mouth" advertising incidentally has a mathematical model too.
It works remarkably well since it has an exponential growth pattern.

For those of you who are hearing 'word of mouth' for the first time,
suffice it to say that it is the sort of
marketing/advertising/canvassing in which the customers speak for you
based on their experience. This is far better than you going around and
telling people that your product/service is good.

You can also do your mite by spreading the word amongst your contacts.

I would imagine that any worthy useful endeavor in life takes a few
years at least.

So you should be patient and keep applying your shoulder to the wheel.

I read somewhere recently that to become a really good C programmer it
takes more than 7 years and that too if you are within the top 15% of
intelligence.

This is why I feel like laughing whenever students and other kids (
people who are just 1 or 2 years into the industry) say.

" Oh C? It is easy man. I know that language well."

As usual I have digressed. Hope you get the idea.

Best of luck!

People who have been subscribed to this list for more than a couple of years
have learnt to grit our teeth and ignore discussions on this topic - which
keeps recurring every few months!

The fears expressed the first time - that the list will soon be flooded with
posts in 14 languages and that the noise will drown out the signal - did not
turn out to be real. In fact, even Tamil posts are few in number. It was
decided earlier that posts in tamil /other lang would be tagged as such
making it easier to configure your filters.

So, why don't we quit this pointless discussion and keep moving!! If it
comes to a point that the vernacular posts so outnumber the english ones
then perhaps we can have a vote and impose some restrictions. Till then,
live and let live. I guess we all are fighting for a free world, right?

regds,

Correction, the file would be name
ubuntu-7.10-desktop.i386.iso

It may not be easier to install using iso file, though
possible. I assume, you are currently using Windows
and have downloaded the ISO file.

Assuming that there are no errors (or none occurred
during downloading the ISO) in the ISO, you can burn
the ISO using Nero in Windows. There's a menu Copy CD/
DVD within nero, which lists "Burn ISO to disc". 

Select that option that'll open a file dialog enabling
you to select the ISO file. (Preferably, use a CD-RW
disc) 

The entire installation procedure cannot be covered
within a single email, therefore, I would request you
to refer to 

http://help.ubuntu.com/


>Please help
> me.

HTH.

Note, installation of the OS, is assumed to be a very
easy task these days, and therefore, you /may/ not
find many replying to your posts. 

Consequently, one (or you) are expected to read guides
at http://wiki.ubuntu.com to get started.

Only few of them. These are the books which were under some free
license. But most of the books available for download in the link,
have the copyright notice intact. This copyright notice prohibits
distribution of the book.

 Please try to download few books and see yourself.

Dear Girish,
Thank you for your patient and detailed reply. I was getting a little
disappointed with the traffic. Your pep talk has motivated me a bit
:). Thanks for the same. I guess I have to keep generating content
that might be useful for people so that they would keep coming back.
The problem is that I am not too sure how many would want to have a
dose of philosophy everyday :). I am not really looking to generate
page hits but rather to build some sort of conversation. I guess I
have reach out to other bloggers to do that. I have tried this too -
but i have found it tough to reach out to people with similar
interests. I have found writers but not readers :). Will keep trying
as you told. The "will take a few years" part got me down a bit. I was
hoping for something like "few months" :). Well If I got to do it I
got to do it. Then, off to the grinder again.
Thanks for your help once again.
Cheers
Anoop

Hello folks,
Microsoft has been conducting anti-piracy raids in Kerala for the last
one week. We are trying to use this as an opportunity to promote Linux
in Kerala. You can please check out the article we have posted on our
site
<http://www.zyxware.com/articles/2007/12/25/linux/microsoft-anti-piracy-raids-trivandrum-kerala-time-to-switch-to-linux>
It is not anti-Microsoft but it is all pro-Linux :). We cannot be
anti-Microsoft because we have to sell Microsoft Products as we are in
the hardware retail business.
Cheers

It says "available for free online".  Yes, even when viewed online, it
is displayed only after downloaded to your computer. The trick here is
don't keep a copy on your desktop.

so what is your problem? If you download and use - you are not a  
pirate. If you download and distribute, you are a pirate.

Ahoy! I got this idea just a few minutes ago and immediately
registered it as a talk. We have been having (GPG/PGP) Key Signing
Party in almost every FOSS conference, why not have one in ours. Thus,
there will be a brief session on creating GPG Keys, followed by a Key
Signing Party during fossconf chennai feb08.

What you need to do? Generate your own GPG keys[1], print the finger
print on strips of paper (you can bring your own hand written ones
too), bring it along with an ID Proof. You can also upload it to
Biglumber [2] Lets share them and sign each other's keys. :)

Well there is one thing worth noticed with Gutsy Gibbon. It takes the free 
space out of an existing fat32 (windows) partition and makes installation 
even easier. 

There are several other features like importing your bookmarks in IE of 
windows etc., Gutsy rocks :-)

Does it require that  "free online viewing" is mentioned inside each
of the e-book?

Apparently, who ever runs the site got consent from the authors:

"The author / publisher has generously allowed them to be available
for free online. Please respect the terms and conditions of the
copyright."

As Kg says, don't distribute. And if you know for sure of an e-book
that should not be up there, you could perhaps contact the website
maintainer

I always believe that anti-piracy raids will help to promote linux usage.
Government doesn't need to promote Linux or opensource, they just need to
find strict ways to stop piracy(like raids). I think in India, BSA is
responsible for conducting these raids. It is nice to hear even M$ is doing
for their products. These raids can help in both ways, either the
user/organisation will go and buy legal software or they will find better
solutions in FOSS.

Can anybody explain why these raids are always targetted against small
shops/organization/training centres? Why it is not done against individuals?
I know it is impossible to do that. What can be done to stop this at
individual level? My assumption is piracy spreads mostly through custom
hardware assemblers. It is less through other ways.

Finally why can't there be a law to enforce every organisation to get
inspected(every year) for using illegal software? Is it too costly affair
todo raids. The fund to implement this can be generated through government,
BSA and from the fines imposed on the notorious companies.

Interesting read indeed. I liked the comparisons of peasants and the
great lord. The vast majority of the peasants are doomed in any case.
Rather than depend on the lord always, if the peasants start depending
on each other until a few of them get to a stage where they can
compete with the lord, a few could become lords themselves, leaving
the rest of the peasants to defend for themselves. Back to square one
and the ubiquitous exponential distribution still rules :)

But thats the way it should be! I have to spend a limited commodity (my
time) wisely for my own sake. I don't have the time to read each and every
peasants rants. Instead, I wouldn't mind spending my time on a 'lords' rants
though. After all, lot of peasants have elected him/her to be the lordship.
Only, in this case the election was fair. A lordship cannot bequeath his/her
estate to their heirs! The heirs are peasants too and will have to fight to
become a lord.

The merchant armada can buyout a lord but her position as a lord will still
depend on how well she maintains her web property. If its bland, then over
time she will become less than a peasant!

I will stop before the relevance cops step in :-)

That was an interesting read, Kamal. Thanks.

possibly one way to attract attention [others might have pointed this out
already]:
go to a "popular" site in your area of activity -- blog / mail group etc. --
put in your comments (preferably some useful responses/suggestions) briefly.
add that full discussions will be available on the link [to you blog, of
course].

Probably it might too imaginative on my behalf..  long back i heard kerala
and westbengal communist government is banking heavily on Linux.  It might
be that in order to weed out microsoft, the government might be conducting
this raid..  otherwise, there is no reason, why even microsoft should take
this raid..

Hi all,

How about including the following  in the list guidelines?

"The lingua franca of this list is English and will remain English. However,
since this is a bastion of freedom, no language will be discriminated
against - as long as the post is tagged appropriately. Example, for Tamil it
shall be [TAMIL] (not [TAMIZH] pls) and for Hindi it will be [HINDI]. And
for Swahili, Nyanja and Tonga it shall be [SWAHILI], [NYANJA] and [TONGA]
respectively. Thank you very much.

While thats the official position, if you are serious about getting a
response to your query please stick to English! There are just not enough
members here who will be able to understand and respond to your query in the
language of your choice."

If its OK, request this to be included in the mailing list guidelines. The
next time a language war crops up we can point the warring parties to this
link and get on with life!

thanks,
mano

Two reasons:

1) Organizations can pirate much more than any single individual.

2) It costs money to conduct a raid. If there is not enough pay out (fines
or software licenses), then it doesn't make sense to conduct a raid.
Raiding individuals is too expensive and is not a good use of the
resources of the BSA or companies such as MS.  When MS or BSA conduct
raids, they will allow the organization to purchase licenses (and also pay
a fine). How many licenses would an individual want to purchase? From the
point of maximum bang for the buck, it makes sense to raid organizations
and not individuals.

PK

        I think the underlying fallacy is the reason that these people
 are blogging.  If they are blogging to make money via ads, or if they
 think blogging gives them influence, then there is bound to be
 disappointment; since very few of the top ever achieve either goal.

        Like free software, blogs are best if you are blogging to
 scratch your own itch; because then the  the satisfaction in your own
 work does not depend on external factors; but within yourself.  I think
 I have just re-phrased the Bhagawata Geeta for the modern age :-)

in part three of the post...

"How to get a link from an A Lister"

there again its more like an ego massage to the great
lord :)

Although I agree theoretically with what is said on simplymalayalees
forum, I have reservations about the way the argument is put forward.
I run a software company and I agree that people will have to pay for
the work done in creating the software. In a normal market when the
traded volume of a given product goes up the cost of the product has
to come down. It has not happened with windows. The cost has been
recovered several times over. What we see here is the effects of the
Monopoly Microsoft is enjoying in the market. Again my opinion is not
to legally fight the monopoly or to deny microsoft to make the profit
but rather, concerned people should take necessary steps to invigorate
the market by introducing alternative options. That is precisely what
the Linux community is doing.
Here is a more detailed discussion on the above issue

We have got an internal blogging system in my company (hosted on
FLOSS). I was talking to some of the most *popular* bloggers.
According to them, you get more visitors if you already have visitors
commenting on your blogs. To get more people commenting on your blog,
you have to comment on others blogs.

To generate more traffic on your own blog, visit other's blogs
frequently and keep commenting on theirs. They would return in kind.
Most of the people who read blogs would either be having their own
blogs or would be following their friend's (or some one special's)
blogs. So, if they find your name in their blogs, it generates more
traffic.

The one I am using is a recent catalyst driver (7.1.2). But it hangs
after running Google Earth for some time. So, I am afraid to take
chances with 3D desktop.

Yes I have heard of it. But I think it is only for R500 series cards
and above. Can, I use this driver with my R300 series (9600) card?

> And, why are you forced to use Windows ? :)
For running Google Earth and other 3D apps.

Btb. does the Open source radeon driver support 3D and H/w Acceleration.

Message-ID: <000301c84859$827d2d30$87778790$@com>

      Hi .. This is my first mail to ilugc team. I have a small issue with
my network setup. I have Beetel modem working with DHCP and NAT. I have a
netgear router connected to the beetel and connected my computer behind
this. Since my netgear router is wireless I planned to purchase a access
point because I don't need a wireless card. I have setup the Access point in
the client mode and connected to the netgear router . According to the
theory it should work but its not       working. I have connected the
Hawking access point to the computer and able to ping the access point but
not able to ping my router. I have not given any static ip address and able
to release and renew the ip address in my computer !!!!   When I have check
the site survey it is connected to my network only and I don't have any WEP
or WPA enabled for the time being. 

 

        Worst part is when I connect the access point to the router and
computer to the router I am not able to ping the router but able to ping the
access point and able to login to.   Again when the access point is wireless
and my computer is connected to the router I am able to ping the access
point wirelessly ..I  don't know how this is working . But when I connect
the computer back to the access point I am not able ping the router . I
think I have confused a lot .. because I am confused how this is not
working. All the firmware's are latest . ANY SUGGESSIONS ?

You have only mentioned your physical test setups and results, but,
haven't mentioned what IP addresses you have used in each, or what
were the actual ping outputs you got. There are different ping replies
(ICMP) based on the error - without which, it is hard to tell what is
your logical setup ... (1)

Good to first get wireless working without encryption, and then you
can play with WEP or WPA.

 My access point is in Router range and I have changed the ip address to 192.168.0.240.  

 When computer connected to the router I get 4 replies from 192.168.0.240. when I ping the access point (Access point is not connected to the router hardwired it is wireless )

Check out http://www.freenas.org/ - It's Free BSD based.
It was in use at my previous work place and is a solid piece of work.

Note:
- Wired connection
~ Wireless connection

This is how I would debug.

Setup I:
Modem<--1->Router<-2-->PC

Make sure connection 1 and 2 are fine with ping. You should also check
that you can browse the Internet from PC.

Setup II:
Access Point <--3--> PC

Test ping for connection 3, and make sure it is ok.

Setup III:
Modem<--1->Router<~~2~~>Access point
                        4|
                        PC

Test ping from PC to access point. If it fails, check ping between
router and access point.

Setup IV:
Modem<--1->Router<~~2~~>Access point<--3--> PC

Test ping between PC to router.

Maybe others have other suggestions.

Message-ID: <406f1f3f0712270546n4e8ad1d4p25c5fe4b325bc895@mail.gmail.com>

I was searching for anti-piracy raids and came across this page

http://members.microsoft.com/partner/india/IPRCase1.aspx

"A recent BSA-IDC study points out the impact of reduction in piracy
in India. It states that a reduction from the 70% level in 2002 to 60%
by 2006 will add $2 billion to India's economy, increase local
industry revenues by around $1.6 billion, generate 48,435 new
high-tech, high-wage jobs and generate $92.4 million in tax revenues
for the government. The projected IT growth during 2002-06 will stand
at 148% if the piracy rate continues at the present level of 70%.
However, the 10-percentage point reduction can up that growth to
163%."

Funny how they came up with the exact number of IT jobs :).
Also interesting the way they have estimated IT growth if piracy is reduced.
I wonder how by increasing a company's expenses it is going to grow faster.
The tax of 92 Million Dollar seems to be too low for the sales
required to match the above data. A brief analysis of the data is
given as a comment at

Hi,
    Hmm.. Thanks for your circuit ...!!
\--

Note:
- Wired connection
~ Wireless connection


Setup I:
Modem<--1->Router<-2-->PC -----------------------Working !!!

Make sure connection 1 and 2 are fine with ping. You should also check
that you can browse the Internet from PC.--------------Working!!!

Setup II:
Access Point <--3--> PC

Test ping for connection 3, and make sure it is ok.-----Working!!!

Setup III:
Modem<--1->Router<~~2~~>Access point-------- Not working !!!
                        4|
                        PC

Test ping from PC to access point(Not working). If it fails, check ping between
router and access point.(Not working)

Setup IV:
Modem<--1->Router<~~2~~>Access point<--3--> PC ------- Not working !!!!

Test ping between PC to router------------------- not working!!! 


NOW my other tests 
Modem<--1--> Router<--2--> Access Point          PC --- Able to ping the access point but not able to ping the router
                |--------------------------------|

Modem <---1---> Router <~~~2~~~> Access point -- PC , Pc able to ping the access point 4 replies, Not static ip address in the Pc. Tried release and renew able to do so!!! I sure its getting ip address from the router ..

Let me Know if I have to try some thing else in this scenario!!! I mean setup!

Again, what can anyone infer from the statement, "not working"? Please
be precise. You need to debug this. What were the IP addresses? What
was the actual ping output? Does the router web interface show that it
has given an IP to the access point?

As of now, 3D support is lacking in the radeonhd driver.
I tried using a git build of radeonhd and it was pretty primitive.
A lot of artifacts all over the place, no XVideo suppport and was 
virtually unusable.

Fglrx is your best choice for now - it has a decent feature set and is 
quite stable.
The most recent version of catalyst - 7.12-2 has a lot of regressions.
It doesn't detect the resolutions properly and I had to revert to an 
earlier version.

I have not had much experience with compiz fuzion / XGL.
Am biased towards a more minimalist desktop, without any bling. :)

There are two ways in which you can acheive this.

1) Run an operating system (GNU/ Linux or BSD  or something else)  and then
run samba or NFS on top of it as is your requirement.  This will have a very
low  knowledge curve( provided you are already good with administration. But
the down side is that there will be too many unnecessary services running
and it will not be scalable.

2) The other way is to run dedicated footprint OS like FreeNAS  or Open
Filer.
These require a good deal of attention from you and the knowledge curve is
very high. But the dividends will pay off in the long run. IF you want
scalability then Open filer  can eventually even be used not just as  a NAS
option but can be scaled up as a SAN ( IPSAN albeit) with iscsi  as the
underlying protocol.

and if you need professional support at  some point the open filer team also
sells some commercial support.

so it all depends on how big a hammer do you want :-)
if all you need is just  an interdepartmental file server for some 50 to 100
pcs. well just insttall samba and be done with it.

Your questions are not very clear to me.

There are no bz files, only bz2 files and you can list the contents with 

$ tar jtf *.tar.bz2 | less

You should use a combination of ls, find and du with the right flags.

Some tips.

  a) ls -a will display hidden files
  b) ls -lR will recursively list all files
  c) du -hsc * will display useful stuff, check it out ;)
  d) ls -l | grep -v ^d will display only files excluding dirs 
  e) find . -type f -print will recursively print all files

You could also use locate(1) in case the locate.db(5) is current.

Best bet would be to run updatedb as root manually.

Hope this helps.

You can download rtlinux and compile it and get started.

But if you are new to linux and having just finished an education in rtlinux
I would think that you might get a little frustrated/uncomfortable
working in the linux environment. Don't worry. It is the same way even
with experts. It is always hard in the beginning.

A good idea might be to try out Ubuntu liveCD distributions or one of
the numerous other "friendly" linux distros. Once you are familiar with
the environment and shell commands you can move on to hacking rtlinux.

Best of luck!

Should you have any questions you can always post to this list and
people will help. Please ask descriptive questions after doing a
thorough research and reading the documentation.

Thanks.

Man, How do you expect this to work?

Do you understand what you are doing?

How can an ethernet interface ever have an MTU more than 1500 bytes?

Obviously it will not work.

In that case I think your hardware is not supported.

Still it is a new discovery for me. A wakeup call.

Let me ask this on misc@openbsd and get back.

Wait.

Check the network driver specification or data sheet? or ask the
vendor? For example, for Intel e1000 gigabit ethernet (check Jumbo
frames):

I have a lot to say. ;)

I got bombarded with responses when I asked this on the OpenBSD list.

Apparently I have been a blind beetle.

You can look at this.

I wonder whether you have ever heard of a search engine and use it
before asking a question. I used one search engine called Google and
it gave me [1]. I hope it is useful to you and from now on, you start
using a search engine before asking a question in a mailing list.

Sorry can't help.

How do you expect me to know this if I learnt that a thing called
jumbo frame existed only few hours ago ? ;)

I think you need not worry about this. It may not give you big
throughput improvements unless you are talking about gigE and NFS. Which
I don't think is your case.

Jumbo frames are supported by very few drivers. Also, as one does not 
live in isolation, it is better to go with std MTU. Even if your laptop 
supports Jumbo frames, it is very likely that downstream equipment drops 
Jumbo frames. Gets you nowhere then.

Question is why does one need Jumbo frames for normal apps? If not, 
better to stick with what works.

Dear luggies.

A brief status report on the preparation

a.Sponsorship: So far about 3 sponsors have tentatively confirmed their
contributions. Once the official confirmation comes I will post the names.
An amount of Rs.1,75,000/- is the total sum so far promised.

   We need more sponsors, as our estimated expenditure is 5lakhs. Please
look out for more sponsors.

b.Student volunteers: We had talks with Computer Club of MIT. They will be
providing atleast 50 volunteers. The tasks include venue management, hospitality, tech support, demo etc. 
  We are planning to invite other FOSS-savy colleges to send volunteers. As most private engg colleges are on holidays we will be contacting in few days.
 
c.Volunteers for talks, tutorials:
      As of now, no one has volunteered for conducting tutorials. Please volunteer quickly. For details see 
http://registration.fossconf.in/code/wiki/TuotorialSessions

d.Posters and brochures will be ready by this Friday.

g.For details about the talks so far registered look at

Subject: [Ilugc] BSNL Broad Band connection in Linux - Reg
Message-ID: <e43212340712310325u4fa28462q3b8053fc19311b86@mail.gmail.com>

Dear LUGs,
                I brought BSNL Broad Band connection. It contains static IP.
The connection was made in Windows by PPPoE.
                 I wish to configure it in Linux, and i tried in Ubuntu and
Redhat Linux.
InRedhat Linux, I configure using 'Roaring Penguin's pppoe rpm to configure.

After configuration,
            I start adsl and check the ADSL status, the result is up.

adsl-status: Link is up and running on interface ppp0
ppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol
          inet addr:59.92.115.234  P-t-P:59.92.112.1  Mask:255.255.255.255

          collisions:0 txqueuelen:3
          RX bytes:286 (286.0 b)  TX bytes:201 (201.0 b)

I check the ping status for DNS IPS and ADSL status IPs and the result is
ok.
But i try to ping the website by name and Internet surfing cause  fail.

i checked net status,
Kernel IP routing table

        Here it will not show the static IP of ethernet card.

Ping failed with which output/error messages?

Check /etc/resolv.conf for your nameserver addresses.

You should try booting your system with live CDs. See which live CD 
works and then install an OS based on the live CD.   Try with mepis, 
knoppix, ubuntu liveCD, etc..

A request to members. Can you refrain from replying to digest mails 
please? It screws up the context for threaded email reading and folks 
rarely resort to pruning of the mail to relevant contents for which 
reply is being sent.

The case in hand is a reply by Sanjeev Saini on RTLinux help.

Hello Everybody,
First let me wish you a happy new year. This is to let you know that
we are trying to revive ilug-tvm and create a vibrant Linux User Group
for supporting Linux in and around Trivandrum. We currently have the
mailing list ilug-tvm@googlegroups.com. I believe there must be a few
people from Trivandrum in ilug-c. If so please do come join the fun at
http://groups.google.com/group/ilug-tvm.
Cheers
Anoop

Though I appreciate the spirit and purpose of this mail I believe we
should be far far more forgiving.

After all this is a newbie/beginners list and we should definitely make
room for others to participate.

One of the reasons many great people left LUG  never to return is due to
the occasionally unfriendly attitude sometimes seen. It is only one of
the reasons. And I am only guessing. I could well be wrong. 

I am still wondering why they left. But we can at least create new great
people...

I am definitely not pointing my finger at anybody as I never ever want
to do that.

This is just an observation in the light of the fact that the activity
is a lot less nowadays and also the technical depth of discussions are
appallingly low. I can scarcely believe that this is the same list that
taught me LaTeX, difference between NAS and SAN and recently about jumbo
frames. (And helped me build countless other contacts which are too
numerous for me to enumerate)

It is impossible to make any endeavor succeed without the right people
and the only way to attract the right people is by a friendly attitude.
And a progressive culture of meritocracy and excellence.

We never know who is going to become a useful technical help in future.

I was a clueless beginner newbie in the OpenBSD lists two years ago. Nobody found fault with me...

Have a great 2008!
