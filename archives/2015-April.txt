Hi Ajeesh,

MySQL 5.1 should be upgraded as there is no bug fixes on MySQL 5.1.
Consider moving to MySQL 5.5 or MySQL 5.6. It will be just an binary
upgrade in MySQL and the underlying data do not any change. Please let me
know if you need any help in mysql upgrade too.

Regards,
KarthiK.P.R

First thing - stop using the machine. If they're is any data left on the 
disk from your windows system, then using the machine might overwrite it.

Secondly use a live CD and TestDisk:
http://www.linuxlinks.com/article/20100226123335414/TestDisk.html

You may be able to do this with the Ubuntu 14.10 installer - but booting 
into "Try Ubuntu Without Installing" mode.

Good luck!

There's no understating that! You need tonnes of good luck. Also be
prepared for having lost your data for good.

Lest you think its Ubuntu's fault, NO ... there are enough warnings when
you install it regarding this and you failed to take precautions.

Cheers,

I'm kinda hoping people view this as a place to build a community onramp
from - a large number of GSoC efforts tend to be focused on this onramp
rather than the delivery.

Interested in making the jump from user/abuser to contributor ? this is
a great time to engage with projects you find interesting.

It's a great idea, considering how the community is already focused on
getting the new members integrated.
Going to join the mailing list and hopefully contribute something to the
project.

Subject: [Ilugc] LSQ - A system to manage simple adhoc-ly written SQL
 queries within an organization
Message-ID: <CAEkH89PeHdzxzxR=Ct0Sq4xhBcBLZfx+7Y6QSjRaeK8464r74g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We at Logic Soft[1] open sourced one of our internal tools[2] just a few
days ago.

We use it to manage those one off temporary SQL queries that are written to
do something quickly on the system. Usually they are on individual
developer systems or they are deleted. But sometimes it is required to run
them again and we don't end up finding them. LSQ seeks to solve this
problem simplistically.

Also, this is our first open source project as a company. Please do feel
free to share your comments and suggestions. It is a really exciting step
for us since we have remained closed source till now. We've already planned
what we are going to open source next.

Thanks in advance :)

Regards,
Shrayas

Hello Everybody,

It has been quite a while since I've been active on this mailing
list/group. I would like to take this opportunity to announce a
series of training programs on "Linux Kernel Development".
The first part of this series is scheduled between 
April 13th 2015 to April 17th 2015.

This will be a full day (9:30 AM to 5:30 PM) training program
over a span of 5 days. The topics covered and the training
format is similar to what I have been delivering to various
companies as corporate training assignments.

For a change, this will be a paid training program, contrary to
my earlier training/workshops that used to be free! ;-)

You can gather more details about this training program along
with the training agenda, price and venue at the following URL:
   http://www.chandrashekar.info/linux-kernel-development.html

To enroll for this training program, kindly send E-mail to
training at slashprog.com

Vankkam,

** Introduction **
Ezhil is a Tamil programming language, being developed at

Notably Ezhil has a grammar structure similar to Tamil language, and it can
accelerate teaching of computer science concepts to children in non-English
speaking areas by reducing the language (not programming) barriers.

** Announcement **
I'm announcing a recent ugrade to our online server at
http://ezhillang.org/koodam/play/eval/ where you can run code right in your
browser. You can run sample Ezhil code or browse examples.

Ezhil enthusiasts please write back. Thank you for your time.

How do you expect a *nix command to know and clean all Windows
proprietary software files? Only the software that got installed will
know what and where it installed the files.

Seriously, please format and remove the Windows partition(s).

Hi,

We can find the Windows partition from Linux machines. Formate will not be
a good option to remove the files as there are lots recovery tools to
retrieve the old windows files from the HDD, even if you have formatted the
disk. Microsoft is now doing door knocking and ask for the genuine license.
Seems they need some more fund for this financial year. They have some
tools to track the cracked license.

So before formation we need to remove all existing windows files before
formatting the HDD.


I am trying to use the following commands to delete the files on my HDD.

scrub -p dod -f /dev/sdb1
and
shred -n 100 -vz /dev/sdb1

But this commands will take more time to complete the task.

Shred will help you - but they will see that you have done this.

Basically the MS audit police will say that you reinstalled all of your 
systems at a certain
date, after they informed you that your we're required to carry out a 
software audit.

It's a bit like cleaning up the scene of a crime after being told you 
are a suspect..

Also, one cannot be sure what other hidden files the installed
software has retained on the system. The only clean way is to format
the partitions.

I don't think they are that desperate lol they want illegal copies to
have a free upgrade to windows 10 . well keeping the propreitary
windows story aside this topic should have been marked Off topic.

The best way to clean is to just fill the disk with zeros . There is a
linux device file called /dev/zero . So you need to tell dd to fill
the disk partition with zero's

So step 1 must be to first format the disk which only would change
probably offset bits . Step 2 must be to fill it with zeros. The
filling up of disk with zeros would take onsiderable time as every
small part of the disk is written with zeros bit by bit.

#dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<destination partition>

Note: Be careful with DD , make sure the destination partition is correct.

Anyways if you are really the fanatic types :P

Here is a solution I found which was recommended by german security agency

Fill the Disk with
1. with zeros (once)   /dev/zero
2. with some random pattern (once) /dev/random
3. with complementary bit patterns (three times), acc. to a former
German government regulation

/dev/urandom can be more useful than /dev/zero because with /dev/zero,
those people can easily identify you have cleaned your disk with all
zeros.

I differ with that opinion. Web is inevitable and everyone should be
acquired with latest technologies.
You can start with free courses on:
udacity.com
codeschool.com
coursera.com
And ofcourse there is youtube.

If you like some hands of experience try: http://www.freecodecamp.com/

Also you are targeting a lot of technologies at once. Focus one at a time.

There is lot more life inside the technology and computing then web. It may
be becoming important but not necessarily everyone should know it.

I made the suggestion seeing that the person has spent a good part of his
life (3 or 4 years) in learning electronics and by learning web technology
most probably he may not use what he learnt. Mostly this is due to
ignorance. Many people think only learning web technologies gives them a
job or with electronics they cannot get a job. It is the work of people
like us who talk about freedom to educate the people who are either mislead
or uninformed or ignorant.

It costs to buy embedded system hardware, test your stuff in real world.
Web tech is not like that. You can do all of it in your laptop. Plus you
get instant gratification when you see your work appearing on  a browser
window.

Plus the hardware industry is closed and proprietary in nature, web and its
standards are open and free for all.

I have a question, how come Telcos identify that I'm using facebook if 
I'm behind 7 proxies (aka Tor)? (they can still reduce my bandwidth or 
cutoff entirely by following tor exit nodes anyway...)

By the way, I already sent mail to TROI, one without a subject and 
another with proper subject, I hope TROI will not give my email-id to 
Airtel to charge Rs.10/- because GMail is OTT.

Thank
Mohan R

You can always use your laptop for testing / use a virtual machine /
simulator. Even if hardware has to be bought, the cost can be considered as
an investment.

This is the also one of the main reasons why I want people to work on
hardware than software. What is the use of open source software if a closed
system is necessary to execute it?

Subject: [Ilugc] Ubuntu vs. CentOS vs. Fedora for my new server ?
Message-ID: <1742834977.1878334.1428900669964.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,
Important: This can easily become a flame war - request all to please avoid making this personal and keep this limited to the distros instead of the distro users. (Hate the sin not the sinner.) :-)
 
Am setting up a new public server. This will have our default website as well as all tools to help our developers develop from across the globe.Will host website, proj mgmt (redmine), subversion, jenkins, Selenium automated test, build tools etc. 

This will be either on digitalocean or AWS.
I have not been a linux admin for about 3-4 yrs now and have not really kept up to date on the developments. 
At that time I was managing Fedora/CentOS and I am comfortable with its internals. Very comfortable with rpm, service and init processes, file system layout etc.

At that time Ubuntu was fast catching up as a great alternative to Fedora/CentOS on the serverbut did not follow it after 2010. 
I did use Ubuntu exclusive as my default desktop OS for almost 6-7 yrs but never really had to use command line there and hence I am familiar with (but not an expert) with 'Ubuntu' specific stuff like upstart and the placement of config files in filesystem etc. Ubuntu on Desktop was a dream - it just worked with all the hardware without me having to compile any drivers.

I want to manage this server with minimal compiles but want latest versions of tools and libraries (RoR, php, Java).

My current "old" server is CentOS 5 which I initially booted up in 2008. I really need to upgrade :-)
For my new server, which would you recommend between Ubuntu, Fedora and CentOS ?

Please do not make this a flame war. I know they are great distros - I am trying to see if it is worth learning Ubuntu server side stuff or go with Fedora/CentOS where I am already comfortable.

Thanks,kc

You make a valid point . There is a dire need of Open fabrication
labs. Are there any in chennai ?

There are some simple things achievable by Raspberry pie
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/README.md
There is also arduino which is quite famous with FOSS people on the
hardware side http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/Linux

There are quite many ways to do things even on the cheaper side but
yes more support is needed to build such an environment and we do have
many such people in ilugc who can help !

Pavithran

I think it depends on your usecase.

CentOS - very solid workhorse. I find it especially good for enterprise 
deployments where things do not need to be changed very often. Support 
for enterprise setups, san storage, multi pathing is good - probably due 
to Redhat's exposure in those markets.

Ubuntu - personally I would only run LTS in a production environment. If 
you need to host applications that require newer packages, Ubuntu is 
sometimes preferable. I find it easier when hosting certain 
applications, particularly ruby based applications.

Fedora - Ran it on servers for while after Redhat first brought out 
Fedora Core 1. I found the constant upgrade path a pain and moved away 
from it for server use - but carried on for a long time afterwards using 
it as a desktop OS. I only moved after starting work on hamara linux!

Hi Pavithran,

We can do things with free hardware and tools which will be even cheaper
and there are also many people like us in our community. We can organize
a meeting we can discuss and we can build an environment we can learn
and help ourselves. We can discuss this in the monthly meet on Saturday.

Hi Mayilvahanan,

I think rather than study center you can learn by your own there are
many sites which help you to learn web technologies.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/HTML

The above will cover overall about web technology for CMS(Joomla,
Drupal) and other refer to their websites.

I really don't want to send this mail, but, since ILUGC veterans are 
busy, I take this oppertunity to humbly ask "Dilli Babu K" and "Vijay 
Ganapathy" to go through the following link atleast one time.

PS: please don't take this as against your freedom of expression, but 
there is nothing wrong in following something for the benifit of 
others.

IMO, the video is pretty well done and conveys the message in a non geeky
fashion.  I liked the  "bouquet" concept as most of the Telcos are also
into DTH and/or IP TV.

If the Telcos get their way, it is conceivable that sites like
www.kernel.org and FOSS repos would download slow.

Hi Everyone,
A skeleton project has been created for libcipher
https://github.com/Chennaipy/libcipher -- a library of cipher
functions, derived from the book "Hacking Secret Ciphers with
Python". For the uninitiated, the idea behind the exercise is to learn
the best practices in writing Python code. And along the way create a
a well written Python package.

Starting this week, we will be creating issues on GitHub, that people
can take up, and work on. Please go through the guidelines below to
get started.

  1. If you would like to participate in this activity, the first
     thing to do would be to add yourself to the watch list of the
     project. That way, you will get notifications when new issues are
     created.

     To start watching now click on
     https://github.com/Chennaipy/libcipher/subscription

  2. Even if you do not have time to write code, you can add yourself
     to the watch list, and read through the changes being
     submitted. You can learn a lot from changes and the discussions.

  3. Each issue after being created, will be available for people to
     contribute for a period of 2 weeks. Please indicate your interest
     on the issue, by commenting on it. If there are no takers within
     this period, the issue will be fixed by the mentor itself. This
     is being done to maintain the tempo of the activity. The current
     set of issues will be available for period of 2 weeks from today.

  4. Before starting to work on a issue, please read the contributor
     guidelines available at
     http://libcipher.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#contributing-guidelines

Regards,
Vijay

Instead of writing few lines and pointing to guidelines, please write what

I have already sent the email to TRAI in order to support the net
neutrality.
I have been following AIB on youtube for a while, they are too good at this
kind of work.

A bunch of really great people made http://www.netneutrality.in/ and
http://savetheinternet.in for spreading awarness and sending mails to
the TRAI. The questions that TRAI has laid out in its 100+ page paper
is really hard to be understood and a bunch of lawyers came together
and wrote answers for them. The effort is really amazing and humbling
IMO.

Also, All the development of the website is being done here:
https://github.com/netneutrality/ so feel free to contribute :) Also
since it hasn't been mentioned, please share http://savetheinternet.in
with everyone you know and ask them to send an email and share it on
as well.

There is also a twitter bot at https://twitter.com/bulletinbabu to
track the number of emails sent. We've already crossed half a million
:)

I presume you mean "license or charges".

According to http://sourceforge.net/projects/talend-studio/
The license was GPLv2 until v5.3.X and changed to LGPLv3 since v5.4
The license was LGPLv3 from v5.4 to v5.5.X and changed to Apache License v2
since v5.6

Hence you may have to check about the "charges" for the version you find
useful.
[I will appreciate if you could share your views/opinion, in case you check
this up.]

with best wishes,

Prima facie looks a bug on openvas installer.

In your place, I would post my problems in openvas mailing list/forum
for faster resolution.

> # netstat -anp | grep LISTEN

You need to run the above with uid=0 to see the program names.

Also follow list guidelines and do *not* top post and trim your quotes
to relevant lines.

Hi there,
Want to find out how a GNU/Linux distribution actually happens,
what all goes into making a distribution and be paid to do it ?

Have you ever worked on some open-source project, only to realize that
the potential is huge and dunno how to relate it to others ?

Have you ever been called crazy because what you know of life is that it's
an abstraction of the TUI/CLI and that's the only way life is worth living .

If any or all of the above rings true, drop us a mail. We are looking
for individuals :-

   a. Who eat,drink, sleep and shit Open-Source
   b. Who have a thousand and one ideas about what is wrong in today's
  computing and have made some efforts to change them.
   c. Who have at least have some idea of what a VCS (Version Control
System) is, and at the very least has made an account on one of such public
hosting sites and has contributed some time and effort to one or more public
projects.  If it's a patch or a pull request it is preferable.

  Duration :- The position is of 6 months .

  Place :- This could be a mix of on-site and remote internship. The
  company is based in Gurgaon. The intern would have to manage travel
  to-and-fro from Delhi to wherever they live.

  Allowance :-  Rupees ten thousand per month.

  Look forward to hearing from you on careers at hamaralinux.org

I have used 'wipe' to blank out data on disk partitions.  Other
solutions like using dd with /dev/*random works.

Someone pointed out that professional forensic sleuths can recover
files from so called "blanked" out disks.   A professional data
recovery service was able to recover all my files even after some one
had done a 'dd' of an iso file on a disk.

Subject: [Ilugc] How to lock keyboard to watch movies?
Message-ID: <CAND27941c9M9DQCs7vFAkAe2HUubkCq_-aRHMFkFaiEae3=DxA@mail.gmail.com>

When I watch movies with kid, it is tough to keep him away from keyboard.

Is there any utility to lock the keyboard activity, while the movie is
playing on the screen?

I use ubuntu 14.0.1

Hi all,

ILUGC - April meet
----------------------------

Mr.Shakthi Kannan came early and started the wonderful session about StumpWM:
The Tiling window manager.
He explained everything Starting from basics of X11, Window manager and
difference between other WM's and a titlingWM,
Configuring and using StumpWM and of course practically, which is really
helpful.

Then Mr.Gowtham Raam came-up with this small GNU/Linux loaded TP-Link
router box, and he explained about its characteristics,
usage and advantages. Its really good to see a device enabled with Linux
tagged along with GNU-License.

Them Mr.Prasanna Muralidharan Started explaining about the Linux Kernel
development in elaborate way.
He have explained detail even from CPU instruction sets kernel compilation
stage in that short time, wait not only that, He also started
to walk us along on how world's largest human reviewed code-base is
maintained. It could have a great session for the beginners.

I would say that many peoples have missed the session.
At least don't miss the next chance of learning.

Heartly!

TAMILNADU,

Using the subject of this post as keywords, I found a few links that
might answer your requirements.

Have you done any searching for such a solution (i.e. help yourself).
If yes, mention the links and tell us where you are getting stuck.

Rajesh,

You need an alternative to MySQL NDB cluster or MySQL Cluster Manger NDB.

NDB Cluster is more enterprise oriented. If you need an HA cluster in MySQL
please try out Galera Cluster for MySQL.

Message-ID: <CADoCDcspxv=PWtHAFXJPw=QZwGKf_ep4HyQLdxPQEr-R2TtK4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all ,

Much has been spoken and done online about Net Neutrality .  Let us now
take our efforts offline.

Many internet users are not noticing the Net Neutrality issue either
because they don't understand what Net Neutrality is or they don't think
it's a serious problem for the average internet user.

So, FSFTN has decided  to conduct a Public Awareness Campaign & to take the
message of Net Neutrality to the streets. The event will be held on April
23 (a day before the deadline that TRAI had given us).

Meeting fellow Internet citizens & like-minded people who support Net
Neutrality will be an awesome experience for all of us.

Posters & pamphlets will be issued to the public. Join us in protecting the
Internet.

Netizens of Chennai, Unite!

The RSVP https://www.facebook.com/events/1574458709469856/

I have tried out Galera Cluster.
But for Critical webapplication, galera is not working well. I am getting
more deadlock conditions.
But ndb is good and the response time is also good.

We work on a Galera cluster with 1.5 TB data on each node. Galera is
synchronous and you do not need a management node .

Reducing your Isolation level will reduce the deadlock in Galera.

More over Galera uses the standard InnoDB engine for operations and NDB is
completely a different engine with more operations in memory. Galera has a
self healing property in case of a crash.

Let me know if the config and conditions under which galera failed.

Subject:        Ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid Vervet) released
Date:   Thu, 23 Apr 2015 09:19:05 -0600
From:   Adam Conrad <adconrad at ubuntu.com>
To:     ubuntu-announce at lists.ubuntu.com
CC:     ubuntu-release at lists.ubuntu.com



Codenamed "Vivid Vervet", 15.04 continues Ubuntu's proud tradition
of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a
high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution.  The team has been hard at
work through this cycle, introducing new features and fixing bugs.

Under the hood, there have been updates to many core packages, including
a new 3.19-based kernel, a new glibc, and much more.

One of the larger changes this cycle is a switch from upstart to systemd
as the default for managing boot and system service startup.

Ubuntu Desktop has seen incremental improvements, with newer versions of
GTK and Qt, updates to major packages like Firefox and LibreOffice, and
stability improvements to Unity.

Ubuntu Server 15.04 includes the Kilo release of OpenStack, alongside
deployment and management tools that save devops teams time when
deploying distributed applications - whether on private clouds, public
clouds, x86 or ARM servers, or on developer laptops.  Several key server
technologies, from MAAS to Ceph, have been updated to new upstream
versions with a variety of new features.

This release also includes the first release of snappy Ubuntu Core, a
new distribution model based on transactional updates.  To find out
more about snappy and how to try it out, see the developer pages:

  https://developer.ubuntu.com/snappy

Continuing the excitement of new and interesting products, Ubuntu 15.04
also welcomes Ubuntu MATE to the party as an official community flavour.
Please give them a warm welcome to the family.

The newest Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME, Ubuntu Kylin, and
Ubuntu Studio are also being released today.  More details can be found
for these at their individual release notes:

   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VividVervet/ReleaseNotes#Official_flavours

Maintenance updates will be provided for 9 months for all flavours
releasing with 15.04.

Greetings, tshrinivasan,
A Event has been created in group Chennai Drupal Community: Drupal Chennai
Meetup

Half a Day Core Sprint, Saturday April 25th 2015.

Location: Unimity Solutions Office, Kasi Arcade, T.Nagar, Chennai. Unimity
Solutions!

Announcing a very Special Guest Andrey Postnikov, Comment Module
maintainer. He is here tomorrow to share with us and motivate us to
participate in Drupal Core.

Everyone is welcome; if you have built a site in Drupal, you can
contribute. We will split into pairs and work on Drupal core issues. Bring
your laptop. If possible, install git before coming and git clone Drupal 8
core. For new folks: you can get a head start also by making an account on
Drupal.org and taking a look at the Drupal Ladder http://drupalladder.org/.

Those of you who came the last time on, you can discuss the issues worked

1. Boot from any live dvd and mount the 'linux partition' where you
have the /root  directory

2. chmod 700 to /root directory

3.  unmount the partition and reboot your machine.

After booting from the live DVD (assuming you are using a ubuntu based
distro), open terminal and type

sudo fdisk -l

This should show your linux partitions.

Find the Linux partition no. where you have your /root  directory, or try

sudo blkid (this will print your filesystem informations in detail)

for example, if your linux partition (where your /root directory) is
/dev/sda6, then try mounting the partition as below

sudo mkdir /mnt/sda6
sudo mount /dev/sda6  /mnt/sda6

cd /mnt/sda6/

look for your 'root' directory

sudo chmod 700 root

HTH.

We were able to get back the router working with a serial cable and
simple linux commands (ifconfig and friends). All because of having

Message-ID: <CAP6xenkuNEc+6h713CBJm_AB1=wQBcFq8Jepm8ir=Wr5eBQtJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Namaste Everyone,

Recently, I was read an article on 'Silk Route' (online drug sale) and came
to know that it's a hard nut for security agencies to trace the network
traffic because severs were encrypted using Tor.

My question is : How is it possible to make servers every request and
response encrypted so that there is no trace of it? It may be impossible to
make it completely encrypted but up to certain extent of level drug market
guys have done it.

As I know, we have Tor browser bundle and Tor desktop client (which I
failed to install properly and encrypt my traffic on Ubuntu system).

If the server is behind Tor then how did they use Tor to encrypt all of
their traffic encrypted? And, if there is some other logic then kindly
share/explain that too.

How did they do it? What are the steps?

Having <https> and hardened down your server are the only best possible
methods to make your server secure from outside world. Kindly explain.

My question may seem out of topic (because not related to Open Source) but
I am curious and want to know about it.

Please share from your experience OR connect the dots.

Thank you in advance.

If your server is behind Tor and if your server is accessable only by
onion address, then obviously your server's inbound traffic is
encrypted by Tor. To run a website (like Silk Road) behind Tor, All
you need to do is, 

1. create a web application, set it up in a server
2. install tor http://goo.gl/LlvRo in that server
3. setup hidden service for your website http://goo.gl/ECRgfZ
4. share that hidden service address (onion address) with your friends
(or in a forum where your potential customers will gather)

I don't think you need to do anything special to run a website behind
Tor, but you need to make sure your web application not making
explicit connections to normal internet or you need to route all your
server outbound traffic through Tor http://goo.gl/X2njG

As far as I know, making your desktop/laptop/mobile fully anonymized
is tougher than making a webserver fully anonymized, because you never
know which application is going to make connection to normal internet
with your original IP address.

put your own one line cron file in /etc/cron.d  (read 'man 5 crontab')
to call your script.

string comparison should be quoted, numeric comparison should be unquoted
e.g  if [ $? -eq 0 ]

Why is the content of the 'dbfile' and why have put it in /etc/cron.hourly?

Alternately, you can declare a local variable "x=db1 db2 db3 dnN"  in
the script itself and use
the "for n in ${x}; do blah blah; done"

> ++++++++++

The symbol '%' has a special meaning to cron so you need to escape it
i.e use \.   (RTFM 'man 5 crontab').
BTW a lot of people trip on  "%" symbol in cron tab entries.

@ Arun Khan,

I read those steps but Iam unable to configure with using those steps,
Showing dependencies issue.

 My requirement is two squid servers, and the cache should be synchronize
in both. Storage( partition ) for cache directory is in SAN.

The same partition should mount in both Squid Proxy Servers. And cluster is
required to maintain these two Squid servers.


Please suggest me based on the above details.

Thanks in Advance.

Regards
Srinivas M

I read the referenced article; the author has taken pains to give
plenty of details.  The target is CentOS 6.
You should first try to resolve the dependency issues.
If you think your problem is genuine then you should try to improve
that article by posting your issues in the comment section.

> Please suggest me based on the above details.

Please follow list guidelines (a) do *not* top post (b) trim the
quoted messages.

fstrim is in util-linux package  <http://tinyurl.com/k9xhcrp>.

It is possible the Debian version does not support the trim option and
you may have to compile it.
