Thanks I am aware of GNUCash.   Let me know if you know of anyone
using it for Hsg. Coop Soc. purpose.

In Hsg. Co-op society billing, interest calculation is simple interest
on the balance principal amount.  Need to keep principal and interest
accrual separate and also show them as such in the bill.  I have been
generating the bill manually in a spread sheet and it is prone to
errors in copy/paste.

Message-ID: <8CD77BB512A0D0A-1384-2584D@web-mmc-d05.sysops.aol.com>


Hi,

     Admit it! We love to bitch about how terrible India is. How terrible our economy is. How we?ll never be able to clean up the gross pollution?.. The bitter fact is that we?re always waiting for someone to begin a ?MASS MOVEMENT? that would ?CHANGE INDIA?S ECONOMY, CLEAN UP OUR STREETS AND ERADICATE POVERTY ? OVERNIGHT?. Wake up people! That?s never gonna happen.


     Forget the MASS MOVEMENT. Why don?t we start a small, tiny, microscopic movement? Just YOU, ME and OUR FRIENDS. Let?s get together and make four small NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS that we WON?T break.

1. LET?S RESOLVE NOT TO BARGAIN:
     Don?t we all love to bargain with our local vendor. Cut him/her down a rupee or two? Would we ever try this at a Shopping Mall like Food World? Or at a Raymonds/Garden showroom? They?re the ones that rip us off BIG TIME! The few extra rupees our local vendor makes off us would go a long way to improve his/her life. That?s where our economic growth begins.


2. LET?S RESOLVE TO PAY OUR LABOURERS A LITTLE MORE:
     Pretty much the same thing. Quite often we are Paisa wise and Rupee foolish. Paying our servant/dhobi/sewage cleaner a few rupees more will go a long way in ensuring that the so-called ?lower strata? of India is given more purchasing power. That is definitely the first step in building up our economy. It won?t blow a hole in our pockets ? trust me.


3. LET?S RESOLVE TO USE DUSTBINS:
     Of course you?re gonna say that you?re already doing that. Well, think about the many times you?ve tossed a scrap of paper onto the road murmering to yourself, ?er..no..dustbin in sight..?. Think about the times you tossed a paper/plastic cup out of your car/a bus/a train thinking that one tiny scrap won?t make too much of a difference. Now think about two million people doing the same thing!! It?s a fact that we don?t have enough dustbins in public places. But would it hurt to carry your litter to the nearest dustbin? I?ve done it and it hasn?t hurt one bit.


4. LET?S RESOLVE NOT TO SPIT IN PUBLIC:
     Sometimes I think this is India?s national sport! Paan, phlegm, just about anything?PTHEW! Onto the street. On the wall. On the door. On the train. In the bus? In fact I had the misfortune of finding myself behind a brand new Mercedes at a signal. Click! The door opened and a cool looking dude popped his head out and spat his true colours onto the road!! Man! Let?s just try and contain it till we reach a wash basin, or find a tissue that would help us dispose of it. I bet we as a Nation will save tons of money on whitewashing alone if this can be done.


     This isn?t a big SAVE INDIA MOVEMENT. It?s a ?LET?S GET REAL? movement. Follow these four resolutions to start with, pass it on to your friends and I bet that by the end of this year the change will be evident.

     If you?re convinced, pass this on to your friends with a personal note. You won?t get bad luck if you don?t, you won?t get a lucky phone call within 5 minutes if you do, but you?ll definitely make a change.



     FORGET THE MOVEMENT. YOU ARE THE MOVEMENT.

First of all - always post the version number of your application.
What version of openldap have you installed?

I read through the links you have posted and also the comment section.
 Notice that others who have tried to follow the article have
experienced problems.

Although I have seen posts of  slapd.conf  being deprecated, I believe
the file can still be used to start your server.

I would suggest that you read the openLDAP documentation here
<http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/quickstart.html>  see point no. 8
which clearly mentions slapd.conf

I have dabbled some with OTRS and find it adequate for Help

Most web hosting sites provide it through CPanel/Fantastico.

Good initiative.

I can not compile.
Here is my result.

@Bhanu -
As i told to you earlier -
Work on command level and not pixel level, teamviewer and RDP protocol work
great because they use "high level command" or graphic primitives like
minimize window, etc

X11 mailing list are the guys who have 10+ year experience , Use their
mailing list and IRC to find out how one can build alternate to team viewer,

Subject: [Ilugc] question about smartctl report
Message-ID: <AANLkTim=T1e_SD57ggQ5VTn_v6OE=TbSKdsYHUYuZZNB@mail.gmail.com>

Server: Intel S3000AH with 8GB RAM, 4x160 WDC [1] hdd (RAID10)
(/dev/sdb1, /dev/sdc1, /dev/sdd1, /dev/sde1)
OS: Debian Testing AMD64 (Aug/10 build), 2.6.32-5, smartmontools v5.40

3 days ago, mdadm started reporting raid member failure (/dev/sdb1).
A quick look through /proc/mdstat showed the first device was offline.
  Yet, the disk was showing up fine in the BIOS as well with fdisk and
smartctl without any timeouts [3]. ?I was able to add /dev/sdb1 to the
array manually with the following "mdadm --add /dev/sdb1 /dev/md0"
mdadm rebuilt the array and things went fine for 2 days.

Last night the device /dev/sdb1 went offline again; mdadm complaining
about it being unavailable but it still showed up fine in the BIOS and
fdisk showed /dev/sdb1 with "fd" ID.

However, I was unable to add /dev/sdb1 to the /dev/md0 device this
time.  mdadm complained /dev/sdb1 was not an md device!

# fdisk -l /dev/sdb  (output shown below)

Disk /dev/sdb: 160.0 GB, 160041885696 bytes

I have seen error reports on other HDDs but ABRT is what concerns me.

I came across quite a few discussions (with search string "Error: ABRT

Any ideas / pointers before I RMA this disk to WDC?

Friends.

Need your suggestions on video recording various talks on FOSS and publishing.

How to record the video of the slideshow and the speaker?
How many camera's do we need?

I saw some video's has slideshow and the speaker in a small box.
The speaker and the screen are being switched often.

How they record the sessions?

What FOSS tools is better for mixing the videos?

Please share your thoughts.

Thanks.

When in doubt, always RMA disks and ask questions later :-)

In your case, it would also be prudent to check that the controller
and cables are also in order.  Connect a different disk to this port
and ensure that it passes disk IO tests without errors.  Connect this
suspect WD disk to a different computer and try to reproduce these
errors to confirm if this is a disk issue.

Subject: [Ilugc] Announce: Linux Desktop Testing Project (LDTP) 2.1.0
	released
Message-ID: <AANLkTimib4nhQ9GPxUCeHwGrrV7p7UVmfxwoNRXhvsUE@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

About LDTP:

Linux Desktop Testing Project is aimed at producing high quality test
automation framework (using GNOME / Python) and cutting-edge tools that can
be used to test Linux Desktop and improve it. It uses the Accessibility
libraries to poke through the application's user interface. We strive to
help in building a quality desktop.

Changes in this release:

Added documentation files from LDTPv1 and updated accordingly
Search object name as unicode character and mutliline
Print Unicode exception, instead of string. Printing string fails, if
non-ascii strings are in exception string

Performance improvement:

When looking for object inside a window without any delay, utilize all the
CPU, just delay the lookup every 2 seconds
Don't force remap on gechild, getobjectlist, getobjectproperty, unless the
window object is changed, as this utilizes more CPU

New API:

getmax - Get max value of spin button
getmin - Get min value of spin button
startlog - Start logging to file

An update:

I installed the WDC hdd on another system and to be fair to the
manufacturer, I downloaded WDC DOS based disk check tool (runs on
FREEDOS).  The short test found some error which flashed on the
screen, it immediately switched to an extended test mode which ran for
about 35 mins.  At the end it said everything was fine with the disk.
Yet, when I boot that system with a Linux System Rescue CD, smartctl
reports the same errors as in my server.  I conclude that disk is
kaput.

Repeated this experiment with Seagate's DOS disk checker on a bad
Seagate hdd (smartctl reports other types of error on this disk) and
it not find anything wrong with the Seagate disk either!

It makes one wonder how truthful the manufacturer's tools are.   I
suspect the manufacturer's utilities check for bad blocks and do not
look at the SMART registers for errors logged there in because with
"badblocks"  I do not get any bad sector errors with either hdd.

>From above testing with the manufacturer's utility and  smartctl
reports, I am inclined to believe the errors reported by smartctl and
mdadm.

Pardon me, but are you taking into consideration the existence of
management ports (ILO, DRAC, RAS, IPMI and the such) on servers?

and will it require Java (like .jnlp and the such) to transport the
screen et. al?

Just curious?

once again by nokia, which explain why you have not found the source
code from official sources. But i really dont understand how the a
product made open source can be made closed source again but thats
what i heard from various sources. wikipedia must have something to
say on this.

My god, Mehul, I feel like a complete idiot. I read those lines without
making the connection that to get a FTP username/password I needed to
email that address. Thank you so much.

Ashwin, I don't think it was made closed-source after all. I think you
can still redistribute. Off to find out now.

Thank you,

Lenovo G460 has a Broadcom bcm43xx chipset.
Get wired internet.
Then in a terminal, do "sudo yum install broadcom-wl" and "sudo modprobe wl".
Reboot.

Subject: [Ilugc] tmux primer
Message-ID: <AANLkTinSGTeX+K-F1yYWgR77Y4dQyfBGqposOht+Ruku@mail.gmail.com>

tmux is a screen multiplexor and it looks really pretty.

You can understand tmux very easily if you can relate it to GNU screen.

But tmux is BSD licensed and obviously it is much better than screen.

It is also really new and its developer was such a genius that he was
immediately invited to
develop for OpenBSD.

tmux is a text mode window manager.

You can run multiple sessions with a text mode terminal like the ones
you get with ssh or putty.

Anyway tmux allows you to create as many sessions as you want and you can also
have a multi session mode in which what you type is visible to a
remote use logged in using
the same username/password.

This can be useful for remote debugging and collaboration.

But the most useful feature is being able to split windows into panes
thereby arranging a single
 session into multiple screens. This is really very nice.

Here is a snap.

http://blog.hawkhost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/4.png

I normally use only these commands in tmux. Of course you will take
time to learn but it is not
 hard.

Ctrl-b + c - create a new window

Ctrl-b + n - go to next window

Ctrl-b + p - go to prev window

Ctrl-b + % - split window into vertical panes

Ctrl-b + " - split window into horizontal panes

Ctrl-b + d - detach and come out of tmux

Try it. You may like it.

Thanks for the link.  Any first hand experience with shipments
directly to India?

I was a subscriber right from it's inception.    I stopped subsribing
because of the time delays plus cost for overseas delivery to India
[1].

[1] I moved back to India a few years ago.

You could opt for the digital subscription. It does tend to put out
nice articles coupled with a few remaining columns which are better
than the norm. In a way I find it interesting to see how LJ has
managed to ensure some sanity in the age of
information-in-the-instant.

Normally I used to see the regular issue in the 1st week of the month.
Sometime, it may reach us in the 2nd week. I received a free copy of
the LJ Archive DVD, it took around 15days to reach me.

Thanks.   I was after the editor  (back in 2003) to put out PDF
versions for potential overseas subscribers; he said it was under
consideration; I did not follow it up.  I am glad it is now available.

Very nice. It is a great domain which affords a lot of possibilities.

Generally very smart people are born from an electronics background.

Anyway here are some ideas.

1) Parking lot automation for a multi storeyed parking lot

2) An LED or a very small LCD strip display for showing device status
for networking devices. You can
interact with the software for LED array/LCD display control

3) Stepper motor based projects for robotics

4) Stepper motors can be used to smoothen other motions

5) VoIP is another possibility , a simple computer integrated
telephony project with a microphone , speaker
 and a whole bunch of UI code

6) webcam integration

7) Asterisk or freeswitch based EPABX

8) Temperature and humidity sensors for weather monitors METAR data

9) Simple FM radio control

10) You can also get an analog TV card and control TV with LIRC
infrared or USB wireless

Best of luck and have fun.

Some people have this habit of making "general" statements like this
and about other stuff. So lets stop this thread from snowballing into
a big OT discussion and ensure that sense prevails. :)

Great!! I was thinking about Power Strips with Wthernet interface to
control the On/Off of each Power outlets.

They are also known as Power fencing devices in the High Availability cicles.

Some examples would be:

Mind you it has a *lot* of uses if you think of home-automation to begin with

All the best. You can do a lot interesting projects with
linux/embedded/electronics.

If the project is not profit motivated, try to do something for disabled
people. India has a lot of disabled people and they cannot afford to buy
expensive aids. Linux and open source had gifted us with the ability to do
cost effective solutions. So request you to please take up something which
can help them.

Personally I am working on a local paging system for schools for deaf
children (This will be made open source once I start actual work). I thank
Mr.Lenin of Birla planetarium to have directed me to the problem faced by
these schools. The idea is to use Arduino+Nokia LCD+2.4GHz wireless. Keep
it extremely affordable from the Indian perspective.

There are a lot of more requirements. Lots more for blind people too.

Arun

"Cloud" has become kind of a buzzword these days and even people like
me who really care about the "Freedom" in FOSS get into this kind of
stuff thinking that if the things used in are FOSS then it gives us
Freedom too but unfortunately but that's not the case! Even if we use
AGPL'd Software in the cloud the Freedom is taken away from the user.
Some days back I watched this talk which proved to be an eye opener

Manifesto for the unhosted web from <http://www.unhosted.org/manifesto.html>

Freedom from Web2.0's monopoly platforms.

Free/libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) frees us from having to
install proprietary software on our terminals. But installable
software is losing ground to hosted software (websites). The server
software is often open source (e.g. LAMP), but the website itself as a
software product is almost always proprietary. There is an obvious
reason for this: Even if an Affero license allows us to download the
website's source code, only a commercial company can finance the
thousands of servers needed to host a successful website. To make
things worse, hosted software has more power over its users than
installable software, because it forces you to put your user data on
servers owned by the same company that publishes the software. If you
want to use Google Docs, you have to reveal your work to a
Google-owned server (what Richard Stallman calls "careless
computing").



Unhosted

I left my dayjob and started the UNHOSTED project to try and stop
this. We needed to break the one-to-one link between the software
publisher who writes a website (e.g. "Google, Inc") and the "hostage
provider" who hosts that website (e.g. also "Google, Inc"). Unhosted
creates a simple grease layer in the form of an open web standard
(UJ/0.1) between the hosted software and the servers that host it, so
this is decoupled.


FLOSS-as-a-Service on top of a commodity infrastructure

A hosted website provides two things: processing and storage. An
unhosted website only hosts its source code (or even just a bootloader
for it). Processing is done in the browser, with ajax against
encrypted cloud storage. These unhosted storage nodes can be provided
by whoever provides your email hosting: your employer, ISP,
university, mobile operator, public library, a hobbyist friend who
runs a server at home, a hosting company, etc. They become just like
mailservers, BGP switches, fibre links and other commodity
infrastructure: independent of which application you run on top of
them. And they only get to see encrypted data. We probably don't need
a lot of storage nodes until unhosted apps really start to attract end
users. When they do, everything will degrade gracefully, and users
will have an incentive to look for a faster and bigger storage node to
migrate to. To maximize the control of the user over his data,
migration from one storage node to another will be an integral part of
the protocol. Unhosted can in the future be combined with recent
projects like Mozilla's Open Web Applications for free-speech "app
channels", and is inspired on architectures like tahoe-LAFS for the
underlying encrypted cloud storage.



how it works

Unhosted consists of two parts: the unhosted storage node (a very
simple server that receives json-data over HTTP, stores it, and allows
you to retrieve it) and a JavaScript library that allows you to
interact with these storage nodes from code that runs within the
browser. All data is RSA-encrypted and signed before it is sent, and
unencrypted and verified when it is received. We used Tom Wu's big
numbers library for this. Normally it doesn't make a lot of sense to
encrypt user data in the browser using a website's JavaScript, and
then send that data to that same website: If the server wanted to see
what is inside the encrypted data stream, all it would have to do
would be to tinker with the JavaScript. So usually, in-browser
encryption is not very useful. But in this case, the host storing the
data is different from the host providing the JavaScript. So then it
starts making sense. A FLOSS programmer would host his website as
purely static content - only the source code. The user logs in with a
globally unique identifier (a guid, like an email address) that
indicates on which storage node that user's data should be stored.
With Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), the RSA-encrypted JSON-data
is sent there, and retrieved from there. Payload-encryption is
possible with PGP-encrypted email, but never reached the mainstream so
far, probably because it requires extra clicks and actions. With
unhosted, we tried to make it "zero-UX": The user doesn't even notice
whether the website he is using is hosted or unhosted, unless you tell
him. Just like https is zero-UX in that it requires zero clicks from
the end user. The webdeveloper only has to call unhosted.set() and
unhosted.get() from inside his JavaScript code.



fabric-based pki

When we implemented all this, and played with a few example apps, we
noticed how cumbersome it is to have to deal with people's public keys
all the time. If I want to send a message to a new contact, I need not
only his guid, but also his public key. In a normal, hosted situation,
where you trust the server that hosts (provides persistance for) a
user profile, this is easy, you just ask the server what that user's
public key is (spki, for instance with WebFinger). But we don't want
to trust unhosted storage nodes if we don't have to. That is why we
invented what we call a fabric-based public key infrastructure (pki).
We call it fabric based, because unlike CA, FOAF and SPKI, it relies
on complete strangers to sign other people's keys. We define a
deterministic way to "walk" from a given guid to another one. Every
guid signs the public keys of "neighbouring" guids, even if he doesn't
know who these people are. It helps to create a fabric of users, where
the hosting providers have no power to stage man-in-the-middle attack.
This pki is the most complicated part of unhosted, and is still quite
new and in need of some peer review by people who know about this.



current state of the project

Apart from the StarSign pki, the rest of unhosted (setting and getting
a key, or sending an receiving a message) seems to work in the
examples that come with the tarball (see download link above). But it
is only a proof-of-concept! Please be aware that the code is still
very rough, and it is not well-written yet. We didn't follow any
coding standards. Feel free to make fun of it - we ourselves do as
well. :) But please don't judge this project by its current code
quality, it is only meant to test if this could work, and to get the
idea across. We do not, at all, propose anybody use this code in
production. And if (unlike me!) you have any JavaScript skills, then
please also consider to contribute, instead. We also received some
reactions about us currently using twitter instead of identi.ca, and
google groups instead of our own lists server. We are thinking about
how we can change this, and not be like "vegetarian butchers". For
now, please join the project if you like its goals. Even (or
especially) if you have some different ideas from what we have done so
far. What is done so far is only the start of a meme. We need more
people on board to make this a succes!


unhosted applications

The unhosted infrastructure could form the support for open-source web
apps like (or compatible with) diaspora, federated social web, vendor
relationship management, bitcoin, and hopefully all hosted services we
currently use. Websearch will be the most challenging one because of
its inherent centralization, but social search variants (propagating
friends-of-friends' recommendations) should definitely be possible on
an unhosted infrastructure. Once that is achieved, open source
software can become as successful in the "Software as a Service" world
as it is in "installed" software. It will help keep Google, Facebook
and Apple in check, so they compete on merit only. If you think this
project is worthy of pursuing then please download our source code,
join our mailing list, or @mention us on identi.ca/unhosted and
twitter. We need web developers to start using this as a scalable way
to design FLOSS web apps. And if you like a challenge, participate in
our Hacky Holidays dev contest, and be one of the first developers to
create an unhosted web app. We depend on web developers to create an
unhosted web, where all apps are free software, and without commercial
companies spying on our data.

We recommend you to read Eben Moglen (he started the "Freedom in the
Cloud" movement that we are part of), Tim Wu (about internet
monopolies), and Glyn Moody (about history, present and future of the
open source movement).

Hi friends,

As a follow-up to the Policy on Open Standards for e-Governance, the
Department of Information Technology has published the "Interoperability
Framework for E-Governance in India (IFEG)."

ODF and OGG are listed as the standards approved for e-governance in
India. A copy of the IFEG can be downloaded from below

http://egovstandards.gov.in/public-review/egscontent.2010-12-28.3570952294
/at_download/file

How this will help?

-> No Vendor lock-in[1]
-> Approx. 22404 INR of Indian tax payers money will be saved for not
using buggy proprietary office suites and vendor lock-in file format(ex.
doc) in government agencies.
-> Usage of Open/LiberOffice.org in all government agencies can be
encouraged.
-> ODT, ODP, ODS, ODG, ODF, OGG, OGV, will be the mandatory file formats
for Document, Presentation, Spread sheet, Drawing, Mathematical formulae &
equations, Audio, Video, respectively.

Some more details.

The parking lot is organized as a multi storeyed layer of floors ,
each floor having
fixed slots for keeping cars.

Each car has a "cubicle" where a sensor (not LDR) identifies a car parked.

The sensor should be really good. A heat sensor combined with
something else is better.

Then you have to draw a map of each floor(mostly identical) and show
each parked car using
 a picture or 3d diagram.

Empty slots should be clearly shown in the bottom computer to assist personnel.

Based on this data each incoming car will know which floor has a free
parking lot.

Get it now?

Market?

I have no clue. ;)

VoIP is a very very big field. You can add value in a lot of ways. I
have told enough in the last time.

Use your kidney...

>>6) webcam integration
> Can you descirbe the usability?

Webcams for surveillance and stepper motor control for zooming.

For instance when you identify a car jumping a red signal you should
zoom in and identify the
 registration number so that you can send a violation ticket to the
address retrieved form
the database like what happened with my friend in America.

The other possibility is doing a creche kid monitoring for parents who
can watch this video remotely.

This will involve quite a bit of networking/NAT traversal work and is
not really hardware work.

Get a webcam that runs uCLinux.

>>7) Asterisk or freeswitch based EPABX

Normally costs are justified(not just cost but also features) for more
than 1000 seats. Till that
 point you cannot play with the big players(integrated electronics
folks) and win.

> 8) Temperature and humidity sensors for weather monitors METAR data
> CAn you describe the usability?

You can make a public display. You can show a Tirukkural along with it.

C'mon you want me to give you ideas? I am sure you can come up with it.

Look at Tamil movies for creativity. ;)

Regarding Automated Parking Lot :

- there are quite a few vendors in chennai itself, one company (I forgot the
name of them) - but they are working out with Chennai Municipal Corporation
- in a very big way, and also trying to use Solar Power for electricity.

This company is in Royapettah - where another company PDIL (Projects &
Developements India Ltd) is situated. When I come to chennai I may get this
name - if some one is really interested. This company is betting a lot, on
Automated Parking Lot, in Tamilnadu.

Also, when I worked in Bangalore, 3 years back - have seen Siemens Company
(Electronic city) were trying to get an automated parking lot inside their
premises - I do not know whether they have installed one by now.

If these info are useful, please take it, otherwise forgive me.

with warm regards,

BTW What's Mumbai cost of each such board in Mumbai?

And does the production version have to be that big? or is there any
asic translators available?

Just curious.

while on it: any knows of CANbus (instrument) activities in India?
Dioes it include wireless?

I remember a Project of Opensource Wireless platform demonstrated at
IITM in Shaastra 2008 which gave me an opportunity to see the
advancements in speech labs in IITM.

any further news on it? where can one follow it?

Hi,

     I need some ideas for the project that I and 2 of my friends are supposed to do. The only software we can use are NetBeans IDE (w/ Java) and MySQL. We can't use the Internet, so Data Mining, which I thought of as a great idea is off the list. The application, that we develop is supposed to have some integration with the backend as MySQL database, and the front end as NetBeans (w/ Java). I want to do something different from the regular/ mundane library management, music library, scientific calculator, etc,.

     Thanks for the suggestions/ ideas in advance.

no .. QTCPServer starts listening to a port randomly and that port is

this is to be communicated to the client via other channel (phone, chat etc)

the ports it randomly generates are usually 5 digit integers like 54341 etc.

Aren't they out of the scope of allotted ports?

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Topic : FOSS is the boss in Law Office - A Erode based Law Office
switches and stays with FOSS

Speaker: Kumaran R
Duration : 45 min

About the Speaker : (In his words)

I am Studying in Class XI at Bhavan's Rajaji Vidyashram, Chennai.

   To start with, my interest in computers made me finish my MCP
(Microsoft Certified Professional) exam in SQL Server at the age of 10
years, making me one of the world's youngest MCPs. Within a short time
I was taken up by FOSS. As per my mentor's guidance I also made it to
RHCE (Redhat Certified Engineer) Certification at the age of 12. Its
five years since I am active with FOSS, admiring the joys of using it.
After coming to Chennai - I have also been attracted to ILUGC (Indian
Linux Users Group, Chennai) and now I am an active member, waiting for
the monthly meetings.

   With a deep urge to promote FOSS - Wherever I go I make it a point
to talk, install and try to convert people to use FOSS. I think for a
beginner it's a good start for having converted 30 of my friends and
class-mates in my school and also my computer teacher to FOSS. I think
and hope to convert my school to FOSS as well. The Yi (Young Indians)
Net of Bhavan's gave me an opportunity to use FOSS (Drupal for
web-site designing and GIMP for Poster and Banner making). In the
Design for Change contest, in which our school was one of the top 20,
in the country, out of 900 schools, I designed the presentation with
Open Office.org. (One of the reasons for getting the top 20 is that
ours was the only school in the country that used open format i.e.
.odp for the presentation)

 The Hindu wrote about me when I was in my 7th standard. There was
also an article about me in Linux For You in the July edition of the
year 2006.

My talk will be  It is about how I opened the doors of FOSS in my
dad's office and led them away from Windows.

There is a Chennai based company called simple labs who used to have an
Indian version for 750/- but they are not making it anymore.

Nope. What I did was take the hex files generated by the Arduino compiler
and directly burn them into AtMega ICs. So you can design your board with
SMD versions and make really small versions.

In India, most industrial use of instrumentation use MODbus protocol. CANbus
I think is used in all cars. And in cars, definitely its a wired network and
not wireless. And just a piece of information - A modern car today has
anywhere between 10-20 computers in them and mostly networked with each
other!

'antigravity' module is available in Python 3.x, Python 2.7+ in the
2.x series so this will not work in older versions.

I feel,  webcam integration &parking lot automation can be better project.
If anyone interest to join this development activity,  most welcome. pease

The Webcam integration can be done easily with the help of zigbee devices.
Its all required the following
1. simple ARM borad/Processor with a zigbee adapter or any webcam which can
ingterface with zigbee module.
2. A simple zigbee gateway which can transmit data via wifi or gprs.
3. A PC or any other mobile devices that can receive the data and display
it.

something similar to the following

Fedora-14) for Shri Sakthi Kailassh Women's College,
(http://www.sakthikailashcollege.org/), Salem district for the Dept.
of Computer science (M.Sc. CS).

It was a surprise that, the dept. faculties spent more than 3 hours
experimenting with many of the foss tools like Codeblocks (c/c++ ide),
netbeans, Gambas (visual basic clone), mysql and later on I told them
about creating video tutorials by capturing the desktop activities
using gtk-recordmydesktop/qt-recordmydesktop.  One of the faculty
member immediately started preparing video tutorials for widely used
linux commands.

It was a real pleasure to see their interest / involvement in using
FOSS and now the internet browsing in also in Linux/Firefox.

Today, IP cameras are common.
Web cam integration can be a good self rewarding project but is out of date.
IP cameras work directly on the Ethernet and most of these camera run a web
server to which you can directly send a GET request to get an image.

Message-ID: <4D27B553.5060106@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm actually re-opening a topic that abruptly ended a few years ago. I 
wanted to upgrade memory on my laptop, and I had no use for the outgoing 
memory module, and selling it would save me some money nevertheless, so 
I ended up selling it for half the price to a gentle soul at a 
conference I was going to attend by posting on this list. There were 
objections to this because of the potential spam of what that would 
entail, and I concurred.

Since then, I've only acquired more gadgets, and I'm sure most of you do 
on an ongoing basis. I've been thinking about this again, because I for 
one would like some flexibility about selling stuff on ILUGC, because 
you cannot possibly ask for a better audience. For example - I'll 
probably getting rid of two memory modules, an old Android phone, and 
maybe even my recently-acquired Kindle if I prefer the hackability of a 
Nook better. It would be nice if we can allow at least such second-hand 
sales among members with the appropriate tag.

I'm very much aware that it might open up a pandora's box of hardware 
dealers trying to sell stuff, but is it really that much of a problem? 
We have been self-moderating on a lot of issues, so can't we manage this 
too, when the benefit is also there? Can we try it for a few weeks and 
see where it goes? Perhaps most importantly, is there any other LUG 
which allows this and didn't get inundated with spam?

I'm aware that there's eBay.in and probably a few more places where I 
can list this stuff, but this forum comes with the added advantage of 
trust, and less of a hassle because most of us know each other and/or 
local. I'm not even sure if it's an entirely a good idea, but if you 
have some ideas, I'm ears.

Vamsee.

as long as it is properly tagged, posted by a genuine member of the list
and ilugc members are given priority and a good discount, I see no
reason why not. We know who are genuine members and we know how to keep
out spammers and hardware dealers.

tag could be [EXCHANGE]

Sir,

This is a very good idea - both device wise & monetarywise.

We also will know - how to get these devices working with our linux - since
it was (most probably) used by the owner.

I am against this. Let us take the only task - promote FOSS and do it well. Each post will start endless thread about the particular hardware -good, bad, beautiful etc. It may also lead to ugly personal exchanges if a deal goes bad.  
I am surprised at the fact - FOSS related annoucement/doubts in local languages was frowned upon- but totally unrelated commercial activity getting so much support.

If it were to be allowed why limit only to gadgets - why not  books, old cd's, flats - where once foss enthusiasts lived, the chair in which rms sat, old newspaper containing foss articles, linux-inside sticker peeled out of my condemned desktop etc.?

The only condition on which I see some such activity is permissible is if the proceeds are donated to ILUGC activities.

If many are interested start a separate mailing list/group.

Freecycle is nice - but you have to give them away for 'free'.

I am not sure why some members are against the idea, but since i do not
believe in law of numbers,
(even if one opposes, the group shouldn't go that away), i would suggest
that a new group be created
and things be sold/swapped in there. I do see the usefulness of such a
group.

Or else, a new forum be created in the ilugc website(is this still working -
which is the official one?)
which lets this happen.

I second the proposal, it should be one time post only and all queries
should go to the OP and not posted to the list.   Being a member of
some overseas LUG lists, I have not seen any abuse of such privilege.

On the flip side, we may have to tolerate the non initiated who may
post their questions here regardless - a non issue as a lot of other
discussions do go OT.

My ten paise.

I agree with your sentiment, but let me try to put it this way - FOSS in 
and itself is great, but the devices it runs on, and can run on are 
increasing day by day. A couple of years ago nobody that I knew of 
(locally) had an Android device, so right from acquiring it, to getting 
some basic skills on how to ship an Android app, I had to learn it on my 
own.

Right now, I have spent enough time with the ecosystem to give a rather 
long discourse on it. So in the process of selling the it, if there are 
long discussions about the device, support and community (I can rave for 
a really long time about the awesomeness of CyanogenMod, but that's for 
a different post). I would love it if there are discussions about these 
devices. I think that can only be a good thing. Like I said, I'm not too 
sure if there won't be any spam - but I think we can deal with it, just 
like we did with other issues.

We do allow another blatantly commercial activity, which is advertising 
for jobs - but we do tolerate it in the interest of the members. So I 
don't really see a problem with slightly expanding the scope of our 
discussions (can any member here really say hardware is *not* exciting? 
- I for one would love to hear if any of us are hacking on the Kinect - 
I'm seriously lusting for it - again, another discussion). So personally 
I think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. But it's up to the members 
to give it a shot and see it where it goes.

+1. But can we make that 'all queries about financials'? I think the 
technical queries/discussion that follows, if any, can be interesting, 
given the right context. If it's going OT, we can always encourage them 
to take it off-list or tag it as such.

I have no problem with discussion about hardware. That is fine. But why take extra role of sales-agent? Why not have a separate mailing list -if need be?

Message-ID: <4D280856.9010208@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I thought I might as well stick my head out once again, and this is not 
really a commercial transaction, so I hope it's a good way to start :). 
I have a Netgear WGR14 v7 wireless router lying around the house ever 
since I upgraded to a new one.

It still works fine, but for some mysterious reason won't let me upload 
any data over 3MB or so. I tried resetting the router and flashed the 
firmware again, but it's pretty much no go. Apart from that, it works 
great, I've haven't had any issues with downloading or wireless 
connectivity. I rarely do big uploads, so it wasn't much of an issue (by 
the way, for some reason stuff like the Dropbox daemon and BitTorrent 
clients seem to work fine).

So I actually wanted to give it away, but I thought I'd drive a little 
bargain :). Anybody (students perhaps?) who's willing to give a talk at 
the next ILUGC meet can pick it up for free. First come first serve 
basis, and I trust you will keep the promise :). Any other details, 
off-list please.

Vamsee.

Like I said, the issue is about accessibility. I don't want to go 
through the hassle of taking pictures and setting up eBay account, and 
packaging it up for mail, etc - this is a relevant audience, and it's 
nice to deal with somebody you know, and I don't think it takes away 
from the spirit of the group. We all sell something to each other - 
that's nothing to be ashamed of - as long as we have something of value 
to offer :)

The frequency of such postings is likely to be very low.  Creation of
another mailing list may not be worthwhile.  Besides, one would have
to join the mailing list to see the postings there.  As I have
mentioned in another post, I have not seen such a privilege abused in
other LUG mailing lists.   Also, if postings for workshops/services
and jobs (which are commercial IMO) are OK then this is also OK.

I do agree with your comment about where to draw the line (selling the
chair RMS sat on); IMO hardware is OK.  Other items can always be
posted on craigslist (or similar).

Agree, but ....  technical discussion about each piece of hardware
ought to be under it's own subject and not under the banner of the
original 'for sale/exchange' announcement.

Not to be cynical. But just wondering - In all your previous 100+
FOSSlab setups the faculty never spent time experimenting with the
tools for more than 3 hrs? Seriously?

And this brings to the topic someone raised earlier (may be
Sankarshan). What are the followups to all these FOSSLab setups?
Setting up a lab and in 2 months it being replaced is not FUN.

Students of my college were asked to take a seminar as a part of an early
bird placement program for second year students! I took the opportunity to
give them an intro to FOSS. By the end of the seminar, I got really great
compliments for the topic more then my public speaking skills! I understood
that people will love FOSS, but the problem is they are not still aware of
it yet! My humble suggestion is that more initiatives should be taken to
spread FOSS rather than discussions between members of the community! Letz
tell atleast 10 new people a day about FOSS!

The presentation link is
http://www.slideshare.net/geekgrams/fossfree-and-open-source-software-6483187

Looking for more opportunities for taking seminars(for free at the moment
:P). I am an intermediate programmer in PHP and Python along with a great
lust for FOSS! FOSS rules!

Linus once said - 'talk is cheap, show me the code' - in explaining this
statement, he said that in some cases, there is no use arguing about
which way is faster. The only way to solve the dispute is to code both
ways and test. In this case, I suggest we try this for a month or two -
if it doesn't work out, then we can stop it.

if you look at Baskars posts you will see frequent mention of faculty
development programs - what has happened is that AU Coimbatore from this
semester on insists on these two electives, and the faculty has realised
that like it or not, they have to teach it.

>

all these setups are being done by the college managements and they are
paying cash money for them - once money is paid, they value the
investment. There is a company that offers to setup a 60 seat FOSS lab
for just 2.5L (from their brochure, it looks like they are not only
charging for installation, but for the software also). So Baskar is very
competitive and has captured the market. All the managements in the
region are also aware that Suguna Spark Business School is the first
College in the region (and possibly in the country) which has got AICTE
recognition without spending 1 paisa on software (apart from the
installation cost). Many universities and colleges in the region are
also decided to move to FOSS in *all* departments - the only thing
stopping them is the non-availability of FOSS alternatives in some
areas.

And as for follow ups, Coimbatore LUG is very much there - please see
the pictures of the latest meeting where we combined a one day workshop
on the syllabus topics with our meeting. The LUG meeting took place
after the workshop - around 150 people attending. At the meeting the
dean agreed - 1. to offer the college as a fallback location in case
some college fails it its commitment, and 2 - to give OOD permission to
any student who wants to attend a LUG meeting or workshop conducted by
us (of course they asked for a certificate from us in each case to make
sure the student has *actually* attended the meeting).

Oh, and several students have approached us to help them prepare for
GSoC ...

Out of curiosity I checked whether this model supported any of the open router 
implementations, seems like it doesn't:

Indeed. Was mighty disappointed when I didn't find it in the supported 
devices list of dd-wrt (I kinda inherited it from my friend). So I ended 
up upgrading to Asus WL-520GU recently, and am running Tomato ND (Teddy 
Bear Mod). The instructions are all over the place so I had to mess 
around a bit, but the firmware itself is a breeze to use. Great UI, was 
fairly straightforward to setup.

The (Asus) router has a neat feature - a USB port that lets you either 
setup printer sharing or you can plug in a usb stick and have a file 
server on the fly (yet to try this though). The latest Tomato supports 
both features, so I would say it's currently a better option than the 
famous Linksys WRT54GL (almost 1.5k cheaper too). The stock firmware 
that this router comes with is pretty buggy and useless (from what I 
read), so you should buy this router only if you want to setup 
Tomato/dd-wrt on it.

I feel, if it is limited to EXCHANGE/Give-away is OK. The present T&C
set by Vamsee for collecting the device is a very nice approach. I
request, others also follow Vamsee's T&C. Lets try for a while and see
the outcome.

Not a particularly big difference between doing that and filtering

If one add following line to bashrc then

man `ls /usr/bin | shuf -n 1`


whenever he will open a bash terminal, he will landup on help page of
new command.

I'm currently using a WRT54GL running TomatoVPN and want to upgrade to
something with a USB port.

I want to attach an external USB HDD and run a mini NAS with
samba/FTP/uShare for 2-3 clients at home.

Can you please share where you bought your Asus router and the price?

Does the Asus come with sufficient RAM to run samba and openvpn
simultaneously? How good is the wifi coverage?

Any other comments on its performance from an actual product user like
yourself is very welcome.

Community,

Do you see the benefits of this idea of 'sharing/selling'?
A simple 'ad' has sparked so much interest on hacking the router etc.

Good work.

echo 'man `ls /usr/bin | shuf -n 1`' >> ~/.bashrc

OR

echo 'man `ls /usr/bin | shuf -n 1` | head -n +6 | tail -n 1' >> ~/.bashrc

depends on your need..

I am thinking of setting up something similar in my office. A personal
backup disk and a git repo for internal use.

This seemed interesting.

Hardware looks very nice, 64MB RAM, 8MB flash and wireless N. OpenWRT wiki
says hardware support is currently a work in progress. Any ideas how much of
it is currently working?

Thanks Arun for your nice reply. I have tried your option, but now a new
problem arises. Though my nagios is running, it`s not listening.

here is my output:

If it's running it's not listening -

zico at monitoring:~$ netstat -atpn | grep LISTEN
(No info could be read for "-p": geteuid()=1000 but you should be root.)

Neat. Essentially it's a "cheap modem" - around Rs 2,200 (incl. 
shipping). I wasn't expecting to find it in India, but there were 
surprisingly 5 pieces on eBay.in. A seller from Delhi shipped it here. I 
tweeted the fact, and they were all gone after a week or so :).

It has 16MB RAM (not much, essentially - Tomato actually reports only 
14MB effective). The wi-fi coverage is pretty good, I should say. My 
neighbors report a strong signal anywhere in their house. Didn't do any 
tests apart from that, but if you want me to run any specific ones, I'll 
be glad to. I'm not sure it will serve all your needs, but here a few 
specs and opinions that might help you (there's a recommendation for a 
slightly more powerful one)

http://mightyohm.com/blog/2008/10/detailed-specs-for-the-asus-wl-520gu-uber-hacking-platform/

Mind you, that's from 2008, and it does have USB 2.0:

http://www.asus.com/product.aspx?P_ID=cOWUB0XOSysr4sBM

But perhaps look at slightly more powerful ones for your need. The 
dd-wrt device support page lists the compatibles ones:

So far, it works great. I haven't really got around to testing the 
functionality of the usb port (bought it quite recently), but it's 
definitely something I would like to explore a bit soon.  but The boot 
up sequence while flashing the firmware is a bit confusing, but nothing 
too complicated. This article helped me a lot:

http://www.society9.com/an-easy-guide-to-installing-tomato-on-the-asus-520gu/

Good luck, and keep us posted as to what you choose and your experiences.


Vamsee.

This is a very well supported piece of hardware in the UNIX world.

But we never know.

This is not a topic for beginners. Get some expert help.

The fastest way to get sound working is simply use my USB invention.

http://liveusb-openbsd.sf.net

But then you are no longer using Linux...

Once again my stuff is also not for beginners.

Source installation is very messy, and I have never successfully
completed  a RT installation from source.  Debian RT packages
typically do not lag too far behind, and I recommended that you
install from your distro supplied packages.

On the topic of WiFi APs, I believe the Buffalo WiFi routers/APs have
a customized dd-wrt firmware.   I vaguely recall their pricing (to be
a bit higher than the paper weight cube Linksys units.

Anyone has any experience with the Buffalo units?

For uber flexibility (and higher cost), there are the ALIX
(pcengines.ch) and Soekris (soekris.com) boards and Voyage-Linux.

Hey Satya, please don't shorten URLs you post to the list.  It's a
nuisance to open an "anonymous browser" window and paste just to see

Can you configure the transmit power in the unit?  IIRC, the max.
transmit power for WiFi is about 200mW (this is the number I got for a
WiFi card I bought).   In various forums, I have come across the
output number in the range of 20-50 mw for consumer models.

Increasing transmit power has following disadvantages:

1. shorten the device life to 2-3 months.
2. produce distorted radio signals and reduce signal quality

It's best to run the device with it's defaults.

Safe way to increase range is to fit an external antenna, here
are some neat DIY hacks:

1. cantenna http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantenna
2. EZ12 http://www.freeantennas.com/projects/template2/index.html

I'm using the EZ12 antenna on my WRT54GL and extended WiFi
coverage into all areas of my house.

Wow. Never heard of this before, and definitely interesting. But since 
Raja warned against it, probably I'll try the safer option :). But the 
USB functionality first. Tomato(1.28) seems to have pretty detailed 
settings for USB/FTP server/Samba sharing, so I'll try these first.


Vamsee.

That's quite surprising. ebay rarely has anything worth buying. There
are online electronics dealers who do stock these routers. The price has
dropped a little bit since then.

Here's the cheapest I could find by searching around:
<http://www.theitbazaar.com/store/our-shop?page=shop.product_details&category_id=71&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=153&vmcchk=1>. Another such online retailer has it at Rs. 2500/- (this is way too much for this router).

Do share your experience with Tomato with us. I'm particularly
interested in how wireless QoS works. I have a WRT54GL, but haven't
flashed it yet (despite that being the purpose for which I got this
model specifically).

Here is examples from the php documentation:

Unless you are using this for educational purposes, I would suggest
using existing modules if any for handling login / sessions.

was a FOSS supporter, it makes oracle one too(Hope so!).And from OSIDAYS I
learnt about Microsoft contributing towards Linux device drivers and some

Hello folks ,
?
I have 200+ legacy c code? which were compiled using c89/c99 compilers, i am planning to move/migrate using latest compilers? and migrate to 64 bit env?, doing so i could able to fix compiler?errors/warnings ? for 32bit-ILP bit to 64bit-LP bit env ?.
?
?
Some warnings i found is as mentioned below :
?
1 ) almost all?programs are having? return type as void for main , and current compiler throws warning that? main should return int , i need to change each and every file converting return type of main from void to int and end of main i need to add one more statement return 0;? for OS .
?
Now i would like to know is there anyway i can do that in command line of compiler where i can make all my c programs return (0) at the end of the main and return int for main .
?
?
2) Also is there any way i can get only one kind of warnings using option in command line of compiler??so that i can list which files are impacted? for a particular warning rather than all warnings , as i am compiling all the? c programs?at one go .?
?
?
i could not get any help from searching the web , just i want avoid the manual work as there are lot of c programs and?It can save a lot of time

 what is stopping you from ignoring warnings ? , if i understood your
question correctly you can use bash , sed , awk or vim , emacs ... to make
those changes now figure it out how you can do it in one go .

 2) Also is there any way i can get only one kind of warnings using option

its does not matter , warnings clearly give file names ,you can use the two
stage process to compile the code create objects first then go for the
linking them together later .

yes you are correct thats what is learning all about . Dig more.

I did not mean to advocate maxing output power - overheating would be
the definitive killer of the device.  With adequate heat dissipation,
I believe the output power can be cranked up to 50-80 mW range.   I
have an ALIX unit which I plan to experiment with,  I will report my
results when I put it in production in my office.

My Linksys WRT54GH is no bigger than a paper weight and it does not
sport any external antenna.   My next WiFi AP purchase will be some
other brand  for sure - something (Buffalo or the ASUS unit discussed
here) more friendly towards the open source WiFi distros.

The point I was trying to make is that the output in consumer models
is low (probably by design) so that the consumer ends up buying more
units to get full coverage in our premises.

+1

To OP:

Most programming friendly text editors can parse gcc warnings tale you
directly to the offending line in the C source in one click.

Vim has support for this using :make command, I'm sure emacs, code blocks
and all other IDEs also support this.

Suggest you manually review and change the code to ensure no bugs creep in
through automated bulk code changes.

Trivial, I guess,

>From http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html:

-Wignored-qualifiers (C and C++ only)
    Warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier such as
const. For ISO C such a type qualifier has no effect, since the value
returned by a function is not an lvalue. For C++, the warning is only
emitted for scalar types or void. ISO C prohibits qualified void
return types on function definitions, so such return types always
receive a warning even without this option.

    This warning is also enabled by -Wextra.

Check out preprocessors

Maybe bison/flex later.... and lint perhaps

Hi all,

I often see the phrase "Free as in Freedom". I have some new baby
question "What does it mean"?

1. What does it gives for a common man?
2. What does it gives for a programmer?
3. What does it gives for a company?

Freedom does not comes with duties: So,

1. What are duties of a common man?
2. What are the duties of a programmer?
3. What are the duties of a company?

( Just to understood the views of "Free as in Freedom" and to have
some fun, I have rose this question. (I personally dislike laws, rules
and politics.))

Generally,

Freedom - allows you to use it for betterment of you (of course - ALL)
              - allows you to help others for their betterment

              - does not allow you to manipulate (for your benefit)
              - does not permit you to polarise the available resources
which belongs to everyone

Others can give you more !!!

Hi All

I set a cron job for running a Java program
The script which I used is

#!/usr/bin/bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.6.0_22
cd /home/jaganadhg/schedules
java -jar ScheduledCrawler.jar

I tried the 'Schedule Tasks' gui program too. When I manually execute the
job from Schedule tasks GUI it is working .


Is there anything wrong in the set-up

Hi if that is a GUI application, you need to tell the crontab to run
it in X by using a directive like 'export DISPLAY:=0' (0 is the
default display, use different numbers if you have more than one
display).

You can use a post like this for reference -

Message-ID: <AANLkTik3T=prmCkXUP1v=_cUeizan_P6h=UR8YB1GAiO@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have created Open ldap using Ubuntu 10.04 server(LTS) and installed ebox
packages on it. This provides me browser based interface to handle my Ldap
server.

Currently all users are in AD (Win server 2003), I want to migrate all those
users to my new Linux server (Openldap server).

Please suggest me some tools or ways using which I can migrate all AD users
to OpenLdap server without affecting the current users.

*Note: I have backup server (Openfiler) which provides different shares and
it use Windows AD for authentication.
*

Thanks & regards

Greetings,

Would "Free Software found in IT Infrastructure related elements"
deserve a workshop?

Think of all the routers/zeroshell/pfsense ipsec (yuk? dunno..),
Certificate servers, antispam etc. etc.

The storage elements
The Compute nodes
The serve nodes
The management network
The data network
The power control network
and the such...

HTH,

It simply means the word "Free" has meaning of "Freedom" in the
context. This was added to remove confusion between free-of-cost and
freedom because English language has word 'free' for both. So Free as
in Freedom means - "read Free as Freedom"

Better ask Why Freedom...

The freedom means *preservation* of solidarity/autonomy, not freedom of action -
taken from - http://twitter.com/schestowitz/status/20803526112313344

or just search on web.

Interestingly RMS posted a micro article today about advantages of freedom.

"Nonfree software is bad because it denies your freedom. Thus, asking 
about the practical advantages of free software is like asking about the 
practical advantages of not being handcuffed."

When asking a question, please try to give as much info as possible so
others can help you. Writing in abstract is not going to help anyone.

For example, how do we know what is the filename for the log file, or
how do we differentiate the log files on the basis of year, month?

I find this a lot in personal mails.

It is not at all annoying at least to me. ;)

I find that it is man's natural thirst to show one up over others. ;)

It also explains that by mailing from a handheld device, they cannot
 spend much time or don't have enough convenience of a PC or laptop
 to mail a lot of text.

I mostly find this with Blackberry originated mails.

I think today this has the same status what mobiles had 7 years ago.

First I'm sorry for the signature. And it doesn't mean that I'm using  
crappy input device. Everybody has their own right to use various  
input devices and no would stop them using the same.

Someone might use blackberry or andriod or any other phones or input  
devices. This mailing list is intended to serve the answers to the  
people not to discuss about the phones that's been used by others.

Sorry I'm too harsh.

Its the default email signature given by Apple and not someone wishing
the whole world to know that she replied from an iPhone/iPod device.

It is annoying - yes. But, it might not always be the 'man's natural
thirst', it might be some greedy corporate shoving up their brand in
your face.

I agree, everyone has the right to use the device they want. Does the 
usage pattern reflect priorities? How fair is it to fund the company 
which curbs almost every right of its users and developers? As a user I 
should be able to add/remove signature I want. Should I endorse a 
company which have become a moral police and dictate usage to its users? 
Now, Apple will decide whether I should use read Wikileaks on 'my' 
device or not? I would throw such device out of the windows. I own a 
device, the device doesn't own me!

Hi, just a thought - it must be that you're just busy & you can't
change your email id from gmail. Google ads serve topics relevant to
your email contents if you noticed. Your blog is also in blogspot - I
guess blogs are harmless even if its hosted by the evil empire - a
free site for hosting given by them doesn't hurt.

Also, shouldn't you be concerned about your twitter and facebook
account - since you are concerned about privacy and the possible
threat of an insurance company denying insurance to you? Because,
without your 'browsing pattern' - your tweets and facebook page pretty
much tells where you live, what you do, what you like and don't.

Hello

i want to check with you if anybody is aware of any link for putting latest version of FreeBSD or NetBSD or OpenBSD into soekris.
i know a few but they are dealing with very old versions of the BSD distro.

In chennai, is there any place where 256 MB CF (big one..almost size of small match box). 

Will Soekris Net4801 work with 256 MB CF, i use 64 MB now.

Thanks in advance

@BALA

I personally "hate" this kind of sarcastic attitude. If you do not
like his post, then discard it, no need to blame for this whole
digital life style.. why don't other ilugc member writing this to BALA
for discoursing and commenting in a  bad way, If this continue the
nobody will post here..

Reason : Do you really a hard-core fanatic of openness and live a
totally freedom in your digital life ? If not then you do not have any
simple valid reason to ask people why other should do or don't.
Digital Freedom is not a overnight phenomenon.. Transition from one to
another takes time. If you have small problem with your friend then
will you discard him fully.. same with technology.. He do not have
problem with all Google services.. He is telling about one particular
search engine which he think better sometimes, So you need not to put
a stroke at his head and say that he must become RMS in 60 second..
Freedom is step by step journey and not a 60 second job.. Leave
everything, you can never object why somebody use some technology..
All you can advice him or ask reason to do it.. Try doing same thing
with a window user from last 4-5 years for adopting Gnu-sense or
Debian.. in the same tone..

One way to install BSD on your CF card is to plug it into a usb card reader
attached to your PC and install directly onto the CF.

You could get a CF card in chennai at Richie Street where the computer
wholesale market is. However you may not get 256mb one. I was looking for
512m and the minimum I could get was 2GB.

2gb card that I have works with my soekris net5501.  I am assuming it would
work on your 4801 board as well.  If you are unsure, and want to try it out
before you buy it, you could come to my office and try it  out. Contact me
off the list if you want to visit.

Thanks

I have never seen an OpenBSD or any other BSD as small as 256MB. I can
barely squeeze stuff that small.

Perl is standard and that takes up lot of space.

Moreover I never bother about Soekris or CF. I simply use Atom D410PT with DOM.

Thanks. Does the 2GB card that you purchased a compact flash card ?
Do you have the name of the shop ?

I for sure know that the bare minimum stuff could be squeezed to less than 1 MB also. It is only a matter of removing things and selecting things

My requirements are such that there is no need perl.

Mostly i think, you are talking about the desktop/laptop whereas i looking at using BSD for embedded systems. so i need to make sure that  
it fits in less space and should test out with some embedded boards such as soekris

First of all, thanks for writing, I was wondering about the same thing
- how come no ilugc member replied to this email. Tomorrow is Pongal,
so most of them will be in their home towns - this might be one of the
reason.

> So you need not to put a stroke at his head and say

That would be a bad thing, I won't dare do that to *any*one.

> Leave everything, you can never object why somebody
> use some technology..

Oh, I didn't object to him at all, I was only trying to point out that
google search is not the only way the data is stolen - Facebook and
Twitter and Gmail are traps as well. Just like how he was reasoning
with Google and DuckDuckGo. (childish argument: If you think that I
was objecting then I can say the same to him!)

> All you can advice him or ask reason to do it..

That's exactly what I was did in my reply.

> Try doing same thing
> with a window user from last 4-5 years for adopting Gnu-sense or
> Debian.. in the same tone..

I agree that my tone was sarcastic - apologies for that. Didn't mean any harm.

The point is, this is not 1985. RMS lived in a different world,
Telling users that 'don't use that technology because your privacy
will be compromised' won't work anymore because as you pointed out -
we live in a digital world. Total number of facebook users is so
freaky that Nobody has to *pay* google to get your data, its available
for free - willingly (and proudly) displayed by ourselves in our
facebook and twitter accounts.

Its 2011, - technology is everything. FOSS community is officially
been alive for more than 25 years. Its time we mature and stop this
'Viva la Revolucion' attitude & show the world that we are superior by
technology, by service, by innovation and not by 'ooh they're bad -
come to us' slogans. Being the angry young man of the technology world
worked for us in the 90's and early 00's but its time we grow up.
Microsoft was the bad guy in the 90's, now the fashion is to bash
Google, a time will come when Facebook/Apple/<insert the next big
thing/> will become the villain for us - FOSS heroes. I'd be
disappointed if this continues forever. Thanks for reading.

Ya had to get busy with exams!

But I accept and agree to whatever you said, KG too had pointed this
out earlier so as my exams are over I am spending quite  sometime in
coming out of this mess (esp. Google Cloud) because when you talk
about something,and you yourself don't practice it, your words won't
have much impact on audience.

I use Gmail in html mode so Ads aren't there, I know that its not the
best but it is a bit better.

Yeah, I am concerned about that too, so I have stopped giving them more data.
Well truly the reason I have to be there is because I want to share
FOSS related updates with every one(esp. non-FOSS) to make them
aware,and you know that there are huge no. of them on Facebook
(Unfortunately).

As far as Twitter is concerned, I use it more passively now, and most
of update come through identi.ca but again the reason being on this is
network with FOSS people or make the non-FOSS one's aware.


PS: I truly want to come out of these and I am trying step by step I
will be out of Google cloud soon now have a fastmail account will be
posting from that now onwards.
And waiting for Diaspora to fix the facebook issue.
Twitter one is already fixed with identi.ca as you see in my signature.

I am not replying to anyone in particular, just in the spirit of the thread.
So I am neither top or bottom posting!

Excuse me for the dig...
Wonder how many people in the list will "PAY" for
a search engine which does not track you
a web mail service which considers your privacy sacred
a blog service  which considers your privacy sacred
a social networking service  which considers your privacy sacred

Well, no body is running anything to do charity or public service. They run
businesses.
If you don't like it don't use it. Simple. Why call them "evil", "greedy"
when you are drinking their free beer!
You have a choice.

I do agree that there will be some people who realised that the free beer
came with some fine print which says that they lost their freedom which they
did not read / did not know. But I guess for those who are bothered, they
need to come out of it and then talk...

...and I eerily remember the classic Eagles song Hotel California
"you can checkout any time, but you can never leave... Welcome to the hotel
California...."

They are still paying in terms of their data and privacy, but are not
aware of it, and I too wasn't! My aim is that we should make people
aware about what is happening with them, after that its their wish!

I agree with this upto a certain extent but business is not about
cheating on your customer, you tell them that, this is happening, after
it is their wish. And as far as we are concerned we should always think
about users, they are in majority, their needs are to be taken care of,
businesses come and go, it is the User who stays!

http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/compiling-linux-kernel-26.html
this is a howto for compiling and installing a kernel manually. if you are
using some thing like ubuntu .. it automatically upgrades to the newest
kernel released by canonical.

hope this helps

Message-ID: <AANLkTimQVaEmQEoWfWVjjM87z1MM6BqweV1RNPQZJdpo@mail.gmail.com>

HI all

I am being asked to handle Operating Systems Lab (Linux Based)  for 2nd Year
B.Tech IT Students.

The sylabus is in the link http://wp.me/p1in7l-3

I request everyone in this group to help me and give suggestions for
improving the Quality of Exercises in the lab and also techniques &methods
to be followed for making the Lab sessions interesting & lively.

My objective is to make students comfortable to work with Linux by using
this lab and at the end of the lab to explore and work on projects with
linux.

Also suggest me a list of mini projects to be done during the lab course.

We have Fedora 12 installed in the our individual systems.

I also invite interested people to come down here to give guest lectures
during the course. (Jan 10 t0 April 10 , 2011)

It is really a personal preference.

I am using it now after seeing this thread, added its chrome extension
too... but didn't like the fact that it can access my browser history.

Other stuff - It is slower than google for sure.

I( and my wife)  did the same and we like the fact that duckduckgo tries
to understand what is the users need for a given search term. And futher it
does not have any other app or any ads which tracks me on the web!!.

PS: I was quite impressed when i gave the the search term "fedex <trackid>"
showed my package status.

Hello, krish I asked DuckDuckGo about your this and below is their reply 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----- Original message -----

Subject: Re: Duck Duck Go Feedback (Ticket #89483)


I don't understand the question on browsing history. By definition we
can't
track an individual's browsing history because we don't save any
personal
identifiable information, e.g. IP addresses or user agents. So we would
have
no way of tying a search to a particular user, or even two searches to
one
history.

Both. Since it is getting OT, I will stop here. You can see some details in my blog. For the timebeing my call -
If anybody interested in FOSS as well as Indian history we will have discussion offlist, finalise plan and post in the list. My next plan is to visit Thirumukkudal or Mamallapuram.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikrx3WNrNTRYjxKrzY_sdw1iVQxT7uvgON=eJFk@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I tried to throw this idea open in the ILUG-BOM group. some discussion
took place.

I was wondering if Centos can have such support network that can take
care of all the "Centos support for money".discussions/decisions.

Thanks for current and further indulgence.

With warm regards and season's greetings,

Rajagopal
Mumbai, India

PS: I understand Some central European and Scandinavian countries have
some (Pagan or whatever) festival around 15th  January hence season's
greetings

=============My original post below==========

We see a lot of professionals and SMBs who are member of this list.

I was wondering if we all can form a sort of service network of
professional for various solutions using open/mixed source.

Any person/organisation with skills/knowledge on
FLOSS/Hweterogenous/Others can be a member.

We cannot ignore the "other"/"Proprietery" completely as they are
entrenched in the various verticals.

Please bear with me. I have dedicated last five years of my bread and
butter earning career to FLOSS solutions but have difficulty in
gaining traction in the enterprises working alone.

Of course there are commercials involved. Which can be discussed
threadbare. Perhaps another list for that.

I was having a "Single window Solutions" in mind wherein the
members/prospective customers can pick and choose services they want.

Modalities/details can be worked out.

Soliciting opinions from the esteemed members of this list.

Regards,

Rajagopal

hi,

I have a repository of code for a particular application. I now need two
customised versions of this code for two different sites. I can clone
the main repository on the two different sites and customise it locally.
The problem now comes when I make changes in the main repository - some
of these changes need to be made in the local customised repositories
and some do not need to be made. What is the best way of doing this in
mercurial?

Subject: [Ilugc] problem adding a fedora repository
Message-ID: <1295353622.1823.1154.camel@localhost>

hi,

I have been handed a fedora 14 remote server. Currently the repository
for yum is 'fedora-local'. I wanted to change it and installed rpmfusion
as per docs. But I am now getting an error:

# yum search postfix
Loaded plugins: langpacks, presto, refresh-packagekit
Adding en_US to language list
Could not retrieve mirrorlist
http://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/mirrorlist?repo=free-fedora-14&arch=i386
error was
14: PYCURL ERROR 6 - ""
Error: Cannot retrieve repository metadata (repomd.xml) for repository:
rpmfusion-free. Please verify its path and try again

any clues?

May be you are using proxy based network. Try configuring proxy via
terminal via .. http_proxy cmd.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=DSnV2LPCcFERkFARJHsQo2q7VXODbNGer6iSb@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Wonder Shaper

What it is:

An easy to use traffic shaping script that provides these improvements:
 * Low latency for interactive traffic (and pings) at all times
 * Allow websurfing at reasonable speeds while uploading / downloading
 * Make sure uploads don't hurt downloads
 * Make sure downloads don't hurt uploads

It does this by:
 * Limiting upload speed slightly, to eliminate queues
 * Limiting download speed, while allowing bursts, to eliminate queues
 * Interactive traffic skips the queue
 * ACKs and tiny packets skip the queue

Configuring the wondershaper requires you to accurately and precisely
determine your consistent upload and download speeds.

The wondershaper is the simplest, easiest to use, entry level, traffic
shaping script provided by Debian.

After installing this package, read highly the detailed instructions:
/usr/share/doc/wondershaper/README.Debian

To know more about:

http://lartc.org/wondershaper/

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install wondershaper

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=iJrjtDTHUYGTKCTQu0m-S5_pudK6wD8yHyXED@mail.gmail.com>

Since NetworkManager (and all of the attached parts; VPN plugins,
clients, backend...) is such a complex system, we're always looking
for people to help out in whichever way they can.

One of the things I'd like to focus on this cycle (even if this
announcement should have come long ago), is test cases and generally
getting a good grasp of what works and what doesn't with NM, the
clients, or plugins. Test cases are useful for us to know that things
are performing as they should and even more important where
development snapshots are involved, given the "in flux" nature of the
code we're providing users. It's not that it's unstable code really
(in fact, it's clearly not... 0.8 is now a stable branch that got tons
of bug fixes, and seems rock solid if I believe the type and number of
reports we get). Still, I'm interested to know about failures. That's
partly why I wrote a number of test cases on the Desktop Testing Team
tracker. There's a need for more though, and that's where the help of
the community comes in.

I have checked with the rpmfusion mirrorlist and the repodata directory in
all the mirror servers are moved and pointing to repoview, and hence the
above problem.

that is obvious - how to keep the branches in sync with trunk and at the
same time retain the special features of the branch? I am looking at
transplant and wondering if anyone has experience of using it.

Ideally, if each feature is modular/a separate plugin, you will have a
separate branch for each feature. For your customization/release, you
will merge the necessary feature branches to the release branch.

Please refer (for workflow):

looks a bit to high funda for me ;-) My need is much simpler. I wrote an
application for running golf tournaments and put it up on a server on
the web. Two clubs are using it. So the main app had things like 'manage
ooty handicaps' and 'manage coimbatore handicaps' on the menu to make
things simpler. Unfortunately most golf courses are far outside the city
and connectivity is bad. So now I have three branches - the main repo,
one repo in Ooty customised for Ooty and another in Coimbatore
customised for Coimbatore. If I pull from the main repo, the
customisation gets zapped. However transplant permits me to pull only a
particular changeset - this is perfect for my needs. I can cherry pick
what I want to pull. The only thing is that I need to be more
disciplined in committing - just one change per changeset.

Conficting changes never get zapped. Mutiple heads get created and Hg will
warn you about multiple heads, which then need to be merged. Not sure what's
going on.

- What kind of customisations are they single file, multiple files
scattered, one folder ?
- Can the customisations  be separated from the base code by any
chance? If you can split your project into modules and if you can make
the core modules separate from customizations. Then you can have the
customizations for each club in a separate modules and checkout the
required modules as needed.
- You can also explore the possibility to create a customisations
patch and apply it after every checkout ? (may be the patch file can
be part of the repo)

that is true - but all the things deleted during customisation get added
- transplant avoids that

in an ideal world, I would have first built a full UML design of what is
needed, make a complete plan of the software design, used a modular
approach and would not have any problems. Unfortunately this software
was developed under pressure over a period of a few months with a lot of
monkey patching and code repeats. Like the day before a tournament some
committee member cooks up a new format and I have to get up at 3 am to
write the code for it which has to be up and running by 6 am. Anyway, I
have played around with transplant and it is perfect for my needs. In
the long run, I will remove all the hardcoded parts which are specific
to a particular club and the problem will no longer arise. Assuming that
more clubs use the software ;-)

hi,

it is a bit embarrassing to ask this, but I have been searching the
whole morning to find the exact address of the default fedora repo for
fedora 14. I have tried all sorts of things, but when I do yum
--repoenable it is always saying not found, or 'not a repo'. Can anyone
supply an url please?

Hi,

Can you please reply to me (in private) as to what is the recommended
book used today for the "Circuit Theory" course/paper in engineering
(BE/BTech)?

Please don't reply to the list. Please mention the university you are
affiliated to, and the book that is used. I need this for a F/OSS

Thanks!

Hi Pankaj Kumar,

I have the following suggestions, which work for me:

1.  Remove all installations of Apache, MySQL & PHP from the system and cleanup 
the registry.  After restarting, install the wamp server.

2.  Otherwise, you can try xampp server, which you can get from 
http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html .  It contains the latest 
versions than wamp.

For any installation, we have to reset the root password manually and modify the 
config.inc.php for proper security setup.

Regards,
Rajendhran

Follow these Steps
1) Install GNU/Linux Distro - http://distrowatch.com/
2) Install LAMP server - Ex - http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_lamp_for_newbies

 Very handy if you are in irc and absolutely don't know what these guys are
talking about. this is a netbsd command.


"wtf" is the part of the "bsdgames"


$ wtf is <acronym>


Ex:

student at student-cygnus ~ $ wtf is rofl

The program 'wtf' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
sudo apt-get install bsdgames
student at student-cygnus ~ $ sudo apt-get install bsdgames

[sudo] password for student:


student at student-cygnus ~ $ wtf is rofl
ROFL: rolling on floor laughing

student at student-cygnus ~ $ wtf is asap
ASAP: as soon as possible

student at student-cygnus ~ $ wtf is bye
Gee...  I don't know what bye means...

student at student-cygnus ~ $ wtf is omg
OMG: oh, my god

student at student-cygnus ~ $ wtf is lol
LOL: laughing out loud



Don't see the meaning of "wtf" ( $ wtf is wtf )    ;)

IIRC, there are about 5-6 suites in this space.  Any particular reason

hmm.... Why not Zabbix considering the drilldown etc. (and do some
snmp while at that -- HPC typically have a lot of instrumentation to
monitor in the datacentre like temperatures within rack and the such)

I recommend CentOS for experimentation with Zabbix.

Very rewarding experience.

Hi, recently found this article about the founder of DuckDuckGo titled
"Meet The Entrepreneur Trying To Defeat Google From His Basement"[1]
do read it and especially this interview below which can also be read
at the end of the article above

---------------------------------------------start of
interview---------------------------------------------------------
SAI: ok
SAI: so, why not tell us first about yourself?
Gabriel Weinberg: Sure
Gabriel Weinberg: I'm 31; been doing startup stuff since college.
Gabriel Weinberg: Married with 1 son :). What else would you like to know?
SAI: you sold your previous startup, right?
Gabriel Weinberg: Yup, Opobox dba NamesDatabase to Classmates.com, a
division of United Online (NASDAQ: UNTD) in 2006.
SAI: cool
SAI: so
SAI: in a nutshell
SAI: what is wrong with google?
Gabriel Weinberg: Spam, irrelevent results, clutter, and privacy.
SAI: everyone agrees the spam thing is really bad
Gabriel Weinberg: Yeah, it was originally a primary motivator for
starting DuckDuckGo three years ago, and it has just gotten worse over
time.
SAI: how about privacy?
SAI: what's so bad about google and privacy?
Gabriel Weinberg: There are two seperate aspects that I try to explain
at http://donttrack.us/
Gabriel Weinberg: First, Google sends your search terms to sites you
click on -- this is entirely fixable and I hope they do so. Ad
networks can piece together your private search history via this
search leakage.
SAI: right
SAI: not many people understand this
Gabriel Weinberg: Second, which people are less concerned about it, is
that Google itself saves your search history. The piece here people
don't think about is that this history can be leaked to the
government, be hacked, or rogue employees can snoop it.
Gabriel Weinberg: DuckDuckGo does neither. We don't store IP addresses
or user agents so your searches can not be tied to you (or together).
We also don't send searches to sites you click on.
SAI: but doesn't that help Google give better results?
Gabriel Weinberg: It may in the future, but it doesn't seem to be used
much to date. They've said in various places that it hasn't worked
great as a signal yet.
Gabriel Weinberg: Additionally, it could be opt-in.
SAI: right
Gabriel Weinberg: In other words, pepole who use DDG don't seem to
notice or mind it isn't there.
SAI: so, do you think Google is evil?
Gabriel Weinberg: No, not at all. They are just a big company.
Gabriel Weinberg: I think they have the best of intentions.
SAI: so you started DuckDuckGo 3 years ago
SAI: how's growth been?
Gabriel Weinberg: Good. I soft-launched it a bit over 2 years ago.
Gabriel Weinberg: It has grown steadily since then, mainly via word of mouth.
Gabriel Weinberg: In 2010, it saw 500% growth, from ~500K searches/mo
to 2.5M searches/mo.
Gabriel Weinberg: I'm hoping for similar growth in 2011! SAI: nice
SAI: i have to ask this
SAI: do you really want to compete with google
SAI: or are you making a point and/or playing around
SAI: or do you want to one day be as big as them?
Gabriel Weinberg: My goal since the beginning is to be the primary
search engine for as many people as possible.
Gabriel Weinberg: So no, not playing around :)
SAI: excellent. ambition is great.
SAI: so what sets DDG apart?
SAI: besides the privacy
SAI: what do you do, technically, that makes you think you're better
than google?
SAI: to fight spam and irrelevant results and the rest?
Gabriel Weinberg: Remember those areas I mentioned that are wrong with
Google? We address each one, and our about page tried to summarize it
http://duckduckgo.com/about.html
Gabriel Weinberg: For spam, we way more aggressively remove useless
sites with just ads.
Gabriel Weinberg: For irrelevent results, we do a lot of things, but a
couple are a) we try to get results that are more topic based, and b)
we remove all those stupid content farm sites.
Gabriel Weinberg: For better search experience, we've developed some
new concepts. Namely, zero-click info.
Gabriel Weinberg: For many searches we provide instant answers above
the links, with cool stuff like category pages, disambiguation etc.
SAI: well google does that as well for some results
Gabriel Weinberg: I could go on :) -- check out
http://duckduckgo.com/goodies.html for all sorts of goodies
Gabriel Weinberg: Right, we take it an order of manitude further,
using APIs and dumps from sites like WolframAlpha, Wikia, etc.
SAI: ok
SAI: so what's next for you?
Gabriel Weinberg: Then there is of course look and feel.
Gabriel Weinberg: We're concentrating on two pieces right now.
Gabriel Weinberg: 1) Even more and better Zero-click info from all
sorts of other vertical search engines.
Gabriel Weinberg: 2) Pushing our less cluttered UI even further to
deliver great search experiences, a la
http://duckduckgo.com/?q=simpsons+characters
SAI: all right
SAI: awesome
SAI: thanks a lot
Gabriel Weinberg: Thank you!
Gabriel Weinberg: OK, back to work :)

Hello all,

When I looked to buy a branded laptop, I felt much bad that I can customize
a laptop *BUT* I MUST select a M$ operating system. And this really is like
forcing us to pay money even if we do not want to buy it. Is there any talks
before this post or is there a way to buy a branded laptop (like HP, DELL or
a sony vaio).

If there is no way, why are we not even trying to make a way?

Heard that Dell reimburses if you contact them. Never heard of real
life stories about it in India. Worth a try.
Acer & HP has some linux varieties.

Also note that even if you win the case - you won't get the full
amount of Windows OS's MRP because laptop companies act as OEMs, so
they get the OS pre-installed at a discounted rate.

take a look at this site as well, if you haven't:

It amazing the regularity with which this question keeps coming up on this list 
and despite the fact that there are already a number of laptops available that 
come with linux preinstalled, this myth that there isn't is perpetuated from 
people within this community.

To the OP: Please search thru' the list archives. Both google and duckduckgo 
support limiting your search query to a URL, use the ILUGC archives URL to limit 
your search.

I personally have bought a Dell vostro (don't remember the model number - bought 
it for a friend - I can ask him if required) with Ubuntu pre-installed a few 
months back in Pune ...and yes, it wasn't just a installation, it was Ubuntu as 
a OEM install, as in I got a DELL stamped Ubuntu DVD with the laptop.

I refuse to believe that one cannot find a vendor that provides the same in 
Chennai.

cheers,
- steve

When recording screencasts via gtk-recordmydesktop, the volume is very low.

We can increase the volume when we convert the default ogv format to avi format.

Here is an example.

mencoder video.ogv -o video.avi -oac mp3lame -lameopts
fast:preset=standard -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:vbitrate=4000
-lameopts abr:br=128:vol=9 -mc 0

I was annoyed enough to do a quick search(*) and bury this myth of not being 
able to find a linux laptop locally. Here you go:

So, can we please stop telling people it is impossible ?

Volume is increased, but there audio and video are not in sync.
Have to make them in sync.

but why you are re-encoding .ogv in .avi ?

If you want to increase audio level you can use audacity

I am Mohibuzzaman Zico from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have been working in Open
Source World for last 7 years. I am really happy that, I have also
experiences of working in Education sector of Bangladesh. As for example, I
implemented DSpace ( an open source institutional repository ) and KOHA (
an open source Integrated Library Management System ) in BRAC University,
Dhaka, Bangladesh. I hope, it will be really great if I can share my
knowledge with students and associates related to Academic Institution.

Application: a2ps

What it is:

GNU a2ps converts files into PostScript for printing or viewing. It uses a
nice default format, usually two pages on each physical page, borders
surrounding pages, headers with useful information (page number, printing
date, file name or supplied header), line numbering, symbol substitution
as well as pretty printing for a wide range of programming languages.

Historically, a2ps started as a text to PostScript converter, but thanks
to powerful delegations it is able to let you use it for any kind of files,
ie it can also digest manual pages, dvi files, texinfo, ....

Among the other most noticeable features of a2ps are:

 - various encodings (all the Latins and others),
 - various fonts (automatic font down loading),
 - various medias,
 - various printer interfaces,
 - various output styles,
 - various programming languages,
 - various helping applications,
 - and various spoken languages.

To know more about:

http://www.gnu.org/software/a2ps/

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install a2ps

+1. You can even get netbooks with Linux pre-installed, just ask for it. 
I got a Acer AOD250 for nearly 2k less than the one with a similar 
configuration with Win7 (I think it only had multi-touch pad extra). 
Most dealers these days are perfectly aware of Linux as an alternative 
OS. Acer usually comes with a hobbled distro called Linpus, just get rid 
of it and install your preferred one.

Vamsee.

These days, the options are getting much better and will continue to
progress forward if more people just ask their vendors first and if they
refuse, let them know that you choose another vendor because of this and
this will add up momentum.  Businesses care about the bottom line and
take sales loss into account and will change their strategy accordingly.

I recently got a DELL Vostro 3500 N-series laptop. When i called their
customer-support/sales they indicated me that vostro N-series laptops are
not available online for sale and you will have to buy it offline or from a
dell store/dealer. The dealers in chennai are bad, if they don't have the
laptop model you are looking for they take forever to give you the laptop.
On the other hand , Dell india offers N-series laptop *only* to corporate
customers (Based on a statement from my friend, not sure). My friend has  a
company, i bought the laptop by billing from his company account. Good luck

Hi Thyagarajan*,*
*             *No, I know about the [TAB] completion.

I am talking about command completion by listing possible commands in a list
box.(Like google ajax, search query suggestions).

Actual process is
        After getting each and every character it will search for the
possible commands and displays a list box, which contains the possible
commands. It allows arrow keys to select the particular command.

profit you commercially well?" We believe that this would be more

Agree.

For a final year project the goal should be copying existing stuff off
the Internet
 kept at a bare minimum(it is necessary even in big commercial
projects, trust me) and learning should be maximised and you should
focus on design
challenge and not so much coding.

Please focus on this goal.

It is not the output that counts, but the learning, thinking and the experience
that will give you the confidence.

Project should take you to a point where when you attend interviews and
talk about the project the person at the other side of the table feels your
involvement, passion and technology focus and knowledge.

It is all about body language, vibes and the feelings that you evoke in the
other person.

You cannot fake it. It has to be genuine.

So try to learn and experience real life development.

I am thinking of a Wacom Bamboo Fun, please tell me if there is something

Hi,

Is there any tool supporting under Linux environment can record (screen
recording software) to record what is happening in a particular system at
any point of time. 

I am mean something like Observeit product. Using this tool we can record
and play back things as and when we needed.

This tool would be very much useful in situations like learning a product
installation by playing the video recording (as and when we require) or to
monitor someone's activities in a particular system at any point of time.

Can anyone help us to get the link for this.

Best Regards,

Murali

To block some websites, using proxy server is a better solution.

I played with it. It's a good one.

if you want install this in your Debian based distrubution, use the
following command in terminal

  $ sudo apt-get install *gtk-recordmydesktop*


if you want install this in your  redhat based distrubution, use the
following command in terminal

  $ yum install *gtk-recordmydesktop*

It sucks in a lot of ways.

I prefer kernel firewalling.

But it has its problems too.

Have you tried pfsense?

Hi,
Am looking for a web based office suite.

Familiar tasks such as editing documents and spreadsheets are needed.

I've looked at CKEditor which could be used for things other than .odf
and .doc formats.
Any suggestions?

Refer to archives. tmux(1) is much better than screen.

The other day I was showing it to Arun Venkatasamy and he liked it
a lot.

But I am not sure how it will help you record stuff. It can be used for
remote collaboration in which what one guy types is seen across
the world as long as both are connected to the same tmux session.

Also look out for my article on tmux in the latest edition for BSDmag
 printed in Poland. I wonder if you get this in India.

It should be available in their website though.

Dear all,

With respect to screen recording software my purpose of asking this is to
monitor the activities of the staff who are working in the Linux based
system. From the time they login till log out we need to track their
activity (every site they go or every mouse movement happens) this would
help us whether they are really working productively else wasting their
time.

Apart from productivity tracking this tool can be used in situations where
someone has installed a particular software / tool and next time when other
person caught up in a situation to install the same software independently
(without anyone's help) this screen recording software solution would be
useful very much.

If you suggest through man (we do not want that) then every time we may ask
the user to use man recording as he would be alert that we are tracking
them.

So what is the conclusion the team is suggesting me.

Best Regards,

Murali

But I am not sure how it will help you record stuff. It can be used for
remote collaboration in which what one guy types is seen across
the world as long as both are connected to the same tmux session.

Since your staff are so untrustable, perhaps you should also chain them to
their desks ;-)

IMO tracking productivity of your company staff by monitoring all
their mouse/keyboard activities is a very bad idea. Productivity of
your staff is directly proportional to his/her on time
deliver-ability. Does your staff deliver the results on time ?
If not, do they document/interact with the team on show-stopper
issues ? Do they spend time learning concepts ? Are they documenting
or presenting to the team what they learn on a day-to-day basis ?
That should be the right precedent to a healthy organization.

- Just my few cents.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

I am not going to comment on why you need this functionality.

Clarify your requirements :

Do you want to record everything every employee does on the screen for 
the entire business day ?
or
Do you want to see what your employees are up to on demand ?
or
Do you just want to track which sites your employees visit ? I suspect 
this is the case - then you need a  network audit tool.

1. Cut the crap of digest. It irritaates at least me and prevents me
from attempting to even understand the query -- let alone analyse and
resolve.
2. In Linux GUI programs have their own way of stashing away
information under a plethora of hidden directories under the home
directory of the user. try ls -la
3. Now if you use a tool like kickstart, puppet (esp RPM based) and
the such, there *may* be possibility to specify the locations of these
cache/config directory based on the application.
4. A job can be setup to caontrol carious aspects of monitoring.
5. If you dare to use APIs of popular monitoring programs, you can
perhaps hook on to them for central monitoring.
6. You have not mentioned what are the hardware available on the
alleged desktops for support of managment port, if any. (viz rsa, ilo
etc., etc.)

6. OF course if you can consider virtualisation, open source tools
like ovirt etc
7. My dearest friend, who is still wet behind ears when it comes to
more than 5 desktop management, There are no canned solutions in real
world for such complex requirements. That is where money is in open
source. Pay to the vendor or to the service provider. Don't gobble it
all by yourself. Donate to some opensource project, conduct events,
Promote
8 Respect others time. they are on their volutary donation time. not
on your payroll. nor or they slaves.
9. They are not your team, so cut out the appealing to the team

Subject: [Ilugc] Tata Photon + is not working in Ubuntu 10.10
Message-ID: <1296194907.2308.8.camel@HP-Pavilion>

Hi All,

Could somebody help? I have Ubuntu 10.10 and just got Tata Photon +
connection. However, the modem (which is Haier CE100) is not recognised
correctly. I get the following in lsusb:

201e:2009

I have tried to search google and earlier archives, but could not find
anything helpful. Found a few articles, but did not work on my machine.
I have tried usb-modeswitch, but not sure how it works and what I need
to do. I believe it is installed by default in 10.10.

Any help is much appreciated.

Thanks,
Abhishek

logrotate is used to rotate a log file, so it does not become huge. Logrotate
keeps the old file renamed, so we always the latest for immediate access. For
ease of administration. check the man page of logrotate, it is more
descriptive.

I do not have the output right now. However, the other things were Bus
# and similar. For this entry for the Haier CE100, the number was
201e:2009 and nothing was mentioned beside it. There was no description on the type of device.

Sorry cannot provide the output anymore.

This is strange. Did the device got detected as storage device(CD)?

In any case try 'usb_modeswitch -v 0x201e -p 0x2009'

However this assumes that system already knows the target product id and
message string (if different from default). If it doesn't then contact
customer service to get them both and issue 'usb_modeswitch -v 0x201e -p
0x2009 -V 0x201e -P <target product id> -M <control message>'

Subject: [chennaipy 714] PSF Sprints - Call For Applications
To: Chennaipy <chennaipy at googlegroups.com>


Hello Chennaipy Python Users!

On behalf of the Python Software Foundation?s sponsored sprint group,
I wanted to drop your group a quick note introducing us. If you?re
already familiar with our sponsored sprints, you?ll be happy to know
we made a few changes to help both sprint groups and Python even more.

The PSF recently set aside funding to be distributed to groups who
spend time contributing to the Python ecosystem, often in the form of
development sprints. Our goal is to help you help Python, so whether
it?s buying meals or renting meeting space for your all-day hackathon,
we have a budget set aside to reimburse your expenses up to $300 USD
(up from $250).
If your goal is to make the Python world a better place, and you work
on the problems facing Python today, we want to help you. We?re
looking for groups of hackers that spend their time fixing and
expanding the wide variety of Python interpreters, libraries, tools,
and anything else affecting the community.

We?re also looking for groups who want to help and get started but
don?t have the resources to get together. Whether your group is
separated by a train ride or lacking a shared space, we want to help
you. On-boarding new contributors to open source Python projects is an
especially important area that we?d like to work with.

This means if you have a Python project and you want to sprint -- we
want to help you.

Some sprints we?ve sponsored include the porting of Genshi to Python
3, improvements to packaging (Distribute/distutils), and most
recently, the PyPy winter sprint in Switzerland.

If your group is interested in hosting a sprint, check out the full
details of our call for applications at http://www.pythonsprints.com/cfa/
and contact us at sprints at python.org.

Thanks for your time, and happy sprinting!

"The number of Linux-based projects is rapidly increasing all over
this industry," Intel's Linux and Open Source Technologist Dirk
Hohndel told the Linux Foundation. "More and more devices and systems
and services are built based on Linux, and therefore, more and more
manufacturers and vendors are looking for Linux talent."

Linux professionals also tend to get a significant salary premium of
as much as 10 percent over other IT workers, Dice reported last year.

I would appreciate some help with formatting a USB memory stick on Linux
such that it appears as a CD drive.

Please note that this is an ordinary USB memory stick - not a U3 device.
The formatting should allow the USB stick to appear as a CD drive on
Windows as well.

Any help is appreciated.

Could you be more specific? What you are asking lies in my area of
 knowledge and experience though I dunno about Linux.

But the ideas are the same.

The boot record in the USB/hard disk are fundamentally different from
 that found on CD/DVD. Moreover only ISO can be burnt on CD.

What do you really want?

Why don't you dump an ISO image to a USB stick? But it would not boot...

What do you actually want? if you want a bootable and/or autorun options
like cd that is simple to do. Search for 'startup disk creator'.

This link [1] has steps about using tools in Windows and Ubuntu to do the
same. It has steps for doing it manually too which should work for most iso
images and in all Gnu/Linux systems. Similar tools are present in Fedora et
al too. Search for it.

It is possible to write an ISO image to a USB disk. I have done that
before and it does boot.

However, what I am trying to do is to format a USB disk such that it
appears as a CD drive on Windows and Linux.

For instance, if you use a Tata Indicom wireless lan USB stick, it will
show up as a CD drive on windows as well as Linux. This allows windows to
run the "autorun.inf" files on the USB.

Thank you,
Prem

What you are saying sure makes sense.

Once again I need to look around for info.

Actually the boot mechanism on optical media is different from that of
 hard disks/USB/floppy.

So you are talking about some other thing...

looks to me that this is basically selling GPL - up to you. But there
are two glaring mistakes. 

1. You state that most companies use BSD license. This is wrong - most
big companies use the GPL - especially those companies that violate the
spirit of FOSS and release a watered down version of their code under
GPL, but keep the full versions under proprietary licenses. 

2. You say: avoid BSD/MIT license - can you explain why many major
projects like python and postgresql are under the BSD license? Why do
you want to avoid these two?

and a minor quibble - AFAIK under the BSD license, one can take a copy
of the code and modify it and make it proprietary - but if you do this,
then you are not allowed to claim that it is a version of the said code
(that is use the name and attribute it)

Hi,


     My sister wants to learn Photoshop, but I do not have Photoshop and Windows :-D. Also, I'm not able to find a training center that deals with GIMP. I've approached some institutes, and they tell Linux training is only available as RHCE, NCLP, etc,.
But then my sister doesn't want to learn all that. She just has to get her work photo editing done using GIMP. Sure, there are Video tutorials, but then I think we should have at-least 1 computer training institute, where GIMP is taught. 
If you know of any such place, please let me know.

Even by a long mile I don't think gimp will match Photoshop.

Even worldwide you may not find gimp trainings.

So you may just have to let your sister learn Photoshop.

Would you mind elaborating how I am biased towards GPL?

Where did I said that?
The closest statement to this I can find is "BSD based code is heavily
used by major companies."
And yes, I do stand by it. The reason being the GPL compliance is
tough for most companies to comply to
due to permissive nature, derivative work based on BSD code is more prevalent.

The complete statement is "Avoid BSD/MIT and use Apache instead (since
Apache is legally more explicit)."
IMHO, Apache is better than BSD/MIT because
1. Legally more elaborate
2. explicitly grants patent rights where necessary to operate, modify
and distribute the software.
(I have mentioned this reason already in the blog post)

As far as python and postgresql is concerned, its a free(as in
freedom) world, they have right to use whatever they want, but that
does not make BSD/MIT better than Apache.

This is correct but I thought it is probably too much to mention to
keep the post short and practical.
(again we can differ since its more of an opinion than a fact).

Citation needed.   You will likely find that GPL code usage far
outweighs any other license in any actual surveys.

I think pitching one license as better than the other without taking
into consideration the differing goals they serve is fraught with
problems.    Google happens to be a big advocate of the Apache license
however when releasing libvpx (reference implementation of WebM),  they
choose to release it under BSD license and keep the patent grant as a
separate document.  The advantage in that BSD is a very simple license
and compatible with more licenses than Apache license is (Apache is
incompatible with GPLv2 for instance).  In other words, whether a
license is better or not depends on the goals.

May be I was bit incoherent but what I meant is that given a
dual-licensed code, most companies would prefer to use (use !=
release)
permissive license over GPL.
GPL code usage can be higher because of Linux kernel and GNU compiler
collection.

Thanks for correcting me on this one.
I remember reading this advantage of BSD long back but forgot to take
this into consideration.
I will correct the post to say a comparison between apache and BSD
(and will remove the remark that Apache is better)

When I was trying bring-up my Huawei E17 modem using usb_modeswitch, I
gone thru something called ZeroCD, which is used to show the USB Stick
as an USB CDROM. If we search in this angle, we may get some clue.

If it is just a list of licences, is it OK for you or someone to

While I don't know if I agree with the original claim, I'd just add
that adding an effect may be simple point and click in PS while it is
a little cumbersome in GIMP. That does not make GIMP inferior, but
artists are not geeks (not tech geeks, to be correct.).

> Wrong. There are no training institutes about how to use Firefox does
But what is it that firefox would do that is not already done with
other browsers? And when was the last time we did anything out of the
ordinary with firefox (or IE or chrome)? But image manipulation, to
some degree, is not doing the ordinary alone. Again even the new ones
are probably a mix and match of the existing ones. But if they are not
straight forward, then they are as good as not there. Problem is yet
again the user base. If you asked the community, they'd tell you how
to do with python script for GIMP. But how many times are python
coders doing image manipulation? Just curious. I could be entirely
wrong.

It's not. Its point and click in GIMP. In fact we find GIMP much more 
easier and faster than Photoshop. There is a huge set of options 
available under filter. We even use GIMP to create generic animations.

Not to mention the cost, then we don't use non-free platforms so no 
question of Photoshop either way.

Same with GIMP. What is there than photoshop can do but GIMP can't. If 
you are a poweruser and know PS, then only you will be able to use full 
power of GIMP. I repeat we use GIMP for everything. And non of of 
designers are coder or programmers. Also, its more about FREEDOM than 
anything else, we are willing to go extra mile to stay free from 
clutches of coprorates like Adobe. Use GIMP, learn and be free. That's 
what matters in the end.

Enough said, now here are the guides to learn GIMP:

hmm, actually I've never used PS and mostly worked with GIMP for my
little requirements here and there. Half the time i'd read up PS
tutorials and work a little out of the way to figure it out for GIMP.
That shapes my opinion.

I never said GIMP lacked features. I said it is not as obvious as
others. Again, how will one become a poweruser if he cannot get past
the initial curve? Let us be honest, for most beginners GIMP is a
little intimidating. That is not to say PS is more user friendly or
intuitive. A simple search ends up returning more PS methods than
GIMP. Why don't power users like you add more tutorials onto the web?

Subject: [Ilugc] Questions regarding mp3 files and the associated metadata
Message-ID: <AANLkTik8oB0By-0ori49KT7PX9dHhLoHfo_WZGWN1vS4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
Recently I was trying to join and split mp3 files for some purposes.
While joining the files, I tried using 'cat' for joining mp3 files and
'mp3splt' for splitting the files. I followed
http://lyncd.com/2009/02/how-to-merge-mp3-files/ for the instructions
to join the mp3 files.

The merging operation happened ok but the timing information attached
with the concatened file was incorrect and changing while the audio
was playing. For example if I had joined 3 audio clips into 1. The
timing information for the combined clip was correct till the first
clip part of it was playing. As soon as the second clip part started,
the timing information started to change continuously. I realize that
this is due to some data/metadata present in combined file is
incorrect and needs to be changed. There were some other solutions
involving 'ffmpeg' and other tools like the one in
http://lyncd.com/2009/02/how-to-merge-mp3-files/ but none seemed to
get the timing information correct. But when I tried out the same
thing in Windows using some tools (which were free as in free beer),
the final output files had no issues with the timing. So I guess I am
missing something while trying to do the same in my Ubuntu. Any
explanations/comments are welcome.

Thanks & Regards,

if you are not biased towards GPL, we can argue further - so can you
clarify whether you prefer GPL to other licenses? For the record I
release *all* my code under the BSD license and I am very happy with it
because it gives me unlimited freedom to do precisely what I want. I
*am* biased towards the BSD license and encourage anyone who wants to
release code to do so under this license.

I misunderstood you - I thought you were talking of software companies
that produce code. In this case about 90% of them release under the GPL,
and a good number of them are bogus in the sense that they release a
watered down version as bait for customers to use their proprietary
versions. Redhat is of course an honourable exception. I have yet to see
this watered down dual version stuff in the BSD license world.

so what is the problem? it is a good thing that major companies use BSD
licensed code - better than using proprietary code.

this is an opinion. No one license is 'better' than another license.
When one chooses a license one makes the decision based on many factors
- the main factor is this: why am I open sourcing the code? And which
license makes it most convenient for me? 

if I am open sourcing in order to get developers to participate and
build the project, then i have to look at the pool of available
developers - if I am working with apache and it's family of
applications, my pool of contributors is from others working on it - so
apache license. Likewise if I am working django or python or postgresql
I would use the BSD license. On the other hand in the perl world people
dual license GPL/artistic license.

if I am open sourcing in order to provide bait for people to use my
proprietary software, I would choose the most restrictive license - GPL.
I do not care to have developer participation in my project because I
will have to buy their copyright before accepting their contributions
(like mysql, mono and other projects do)

So no one license is 'better' than another.

better for their purposes - both projects are wildly successful in terms
of users and in terms of developers contributing. So what exactly is
your problem?

but it looks like no one in Chennai knows anything about GIMP (other
than to say it is better than photoshop) The issue is not which is
better - the issue is that a person wants to learn GIMP and all we can

+1 Kenneth.

I just repeat that I am not PS guy either. Never used one (for the
record, my h/w config is below the minimal requirements :D). I use
GIMP myself. But I know how difficult I find it getting things done.
Any reasonably advanced tutorials should be good.

there are a lot of people who cannot learn from tutorials. It is nothing
to be ashamed of - different people are made differently and learn in
different ways. I struggled with GIMP for at least 10 years - I was only
able to understand it when Akkana Peck ran a GIMP class on the linuxchix
mailing list some years back - *then* I learnt. That class and the
responses to it are available on the linuxchix mailing list archives.
(Akkana is one of the leading GIMP users in the world). But surely there
is at least one person in Chennai who can offer to take a few classes?

IMHO the difference between GIMP and Photoshop is just  the difference
between Linux and Windows. Geeks will use GIMP and an non geek graphics
artists who either can afford to buy  or don't care about copyrights will
use Photoshop. Regarding features though, most people like an app to come
with all the features along with it, which Photoshop does. You cannot expect
an average graphics user to search the internet to download and install plug
in's for GIMP the geeky way.

You can also compare it to MS Office / OpenOffice.org, CorelDRAW / InkScape.
People in the graphics industry will only want a .psd file like the
corporate world will only want a .doc file...  People in the printing
industry will demand a Coredraw file only.

I personally use GIMP in both Linux and Windows for both simple and
complicated graphics work and it's just fine.

But I must add that I have seen my uncle who is a pro graphics artist use
Photshop. Unlike Linux and Windows, GIMP has to play catch up to Photoshop
any day.

I am very much in Chennai. I am not a graphics artist but.
I have used GIMP to create all graphics resources for our apps. Also for
product brochures etc.

I may not be the right person to teach GIMP for a graphics person, but I am
willing to assist anybody who is wants to learn GIMP.

Hi,

Following were the major questions raised.

>is it OK for you or someone to 'endorse'/recommend licences?
Why not?
Please correct me if I am wrong but commenting/endorsing/recommending
something (in absolute sense or relative to something else) is Freedom
of speech.

>Is there and legal/political reason behind other than your own preference?
No, as I mentioned even at the end of blog post, this is a personal blog.
There is no legal/political reason, only my preference.

> it is a good thing that major companies use BSD
> licensed code - better than using proprietary code.
I stated that as a fact without saying its a good thing or a bad thing.

> No one license is 'better' than another license.
My aim was in no way to show bias towards one license over another but
just to provide short summary.
I have corrected text at a few places where I thought it was giving
the impression that I am biased towards some license.
If anyone still thinks that there is some portion of blog post which
is opinionated towards any license, please cite that and we can
discuss.

> so can you clarify whether you prefer GPL to other licenses?
Well, as you (Kenneth) yourself have already answered this beautifully
if I am contributing to some open-source project, I would prefer
taking one of the license which is popular among developer community
(from whom I expect contribution)
Apart from that [if possible], I would probably would go for a dual
licensing approach [a copyleft + a permissive license]

And also from Intel, AMD, etc.? or do you you use any other hardware to run
GIMP on to be free? Or do Intel and AMD give away their chip designs under

I use GIMP because I like it. It gives me a different kind of freedom, which
is surely not to escape the evil corporate. Last but not the least GIMP is
free as in free beer and it does not make sense for me to buy Photoshop. I
will be honest.

One feature which I think is better in GIMP is the integration capacity to
Ffmpeg. We have used GIMP to create studio quality animation videos for a
game show software.

Now, its making things complicated unnecessarily. If there are free 
software alternatives available use them. Next question will be with 
MoBo? RAM, Power Supply or Cabinet and then ISP?

It doesn't matter for me to buy a $200 software. I care about freedom as 
in speech more than free as beer. It's OK to use FLOSS for completely 
different reasons. Cost does matter, but that is not the only reason for 
'me' to use FLOSS.

I am a Linux User from the days of RedHat 6.0, having nothing but
Linux on my PC and Laptop. I am also an amateur photographer, heading
my company's Photography Club. Though not a pro, I do some amount of
photo editing for in-house online publications and corporate blogs.

With this premise: The following are my observations:
"The Gimp" is great. I have been able to script it and customize it
for my use. I have been using it for about 7 years now. Its good
enough for most of the work that people use PS for.

But, a little searching on the net would tell you what Gimp lacks from
a PRO point of view.

1. 32 bit processing is just about in it's infancy in Gimp. The GEGL
library is still not complete.
2. because of (1) above, the processing done by Gimp are not loss-less.
3. Support for CMYK has just now been introduced. - I remember a
conversation in iLUGc, regarding printing something from Gimp. The
professional printers wanted something in CMYK, which wasn't available
in Gimp then.
4. Adjustment layers - is still not found in The Gimp as yet. - I
missed this feature a lot, when I had to isolate a child's photo from
the background, particularly around his hair.

I repeat, if you are not a PRO, you wouldn't need any of the above. If
you are using it for some, less serious stuff or initial learnings,
its enough.

There are times, (just search in the internet, you will find), where
people suggest that you should use Krita (from erstwhile K-Office),
instead of Gimp for CMYK and lossless processing. I still love the
Gimp, but it has a long way to go before it becomes a serious
competitor to PS. Its way ahead.

I am eagerly waiting for Gimp 3.0, which promises to have most of
these loopholes plugged, including complete lossless processing and
support for CMYK.

Note: I do not have PS and have never worked on PS and don't have
plans of doing so either.

with regards,
Natarajan

OK, it's getting off topic now. I will just stop here.
Anyways, I never meant to question 'your' intentions, it was a general
observation... I was commenting only on the 'clutches of corporates' you had
mentioned. As a techie I also love to use Linux and GIMP because of the
freedom it gives. The free beer is a bonus.

This is because others can and will fork BSD code and keep them

MySQL does not buy contributions.  They require anyone sending

Taking a wild guess.

Perhaps the id3 version was wrong?

Try with some id3 tag editor.

I have been able to use mp3splt but I have perhaps not digged into it
as deep as you obviously have.

I will start reading about id3 tags and the information stored in
them. Need to find out if anything related to timing is stored. I have
used 'mp3splt' to split files without any problems. I have been having
issues only with merging.

but as far as image printing is concerned, printers are happy to accept
png or jpeg or pdf and do the colour separation themselves. So that is
not such a big issue as before.

Well.. I will be happy to.. provided my office dosen't pull me into to
office on weekends.... I will be able to do the "Photo editing" stuff
but not drawing stuff... Hence, can't do it alone.


The most useful stuff that I have ever used Gimp is available in this blog :-)

Dear all,
           It is so nice to know that many like minded people are there.I
have an humble suggestion in this regard.I feel like good principles of life
Linux,GIMP,FOSS  are difficult to adopt and follow,but they are the right
ones and do good to one and all in the long run.Hey! it is time up and this
exactly a wake up call for those who use only open source.Why not formulate
some tutorials on almost all the applications in open source? Who else other
than this community can take initiative and do (not something about it)
everything for it. Come up and take the challenge.To ILUGC the work
starts.......
Note My special thanks to Mr.V.Natarajan.
With Regards,
~~ Kavitha G

It is a good and right principle to try following the mailing list
guidelines by using interleaved posting and totally avoid top posting.

actually I think the photo editing part is more important - inkscape is
the drawing tool - as a start you could think of presenting a hands on
demo at the coming LUG meet.

Although I have better things to do than to investigate the nefarious
practices of people who subvert the GPL, I remember having a flame war
with some mysql biggie some years back where he said that they accept
contributions to their open source GPL version as long as the
contributor assigns copyright to them - and they pay the contributor.

Pretty sensible reply..   I dont know why such aversion to photoshop?  Are
we becoming intolerant?

We should learn photoshop and excel in it.  Only then we will understand the
extensive features in it and then try to bring GIMP on par with it.
Secondly, how many in india actually contribute to GIMP?  We can count..  We
are mostly consumers of open source product, and we dont have any control
over its feature set.  So when people in the industry wants quick turn
around, they always seek for the product that meets their requirement.

The pragmatic way of dealing with such situation is that we would learn
photoshop, and if we are committed towards GIMP, we sould strive to bring
those Photoshop features in to GIMP..

Opposing people to learn Photoshop, is like preventing our wife/girl friend
from talking to other boys.. LOL... :)

If you start using GIMP, stop using Photoshop there will be a slew of 
designers expert in GIMP, since they ONLY use GIMP, they will demand 
features and will be added.

the point of this thread is to help people learn GIMP. If you are in
Chennai and know GIMP please come forward and do something practical -
if not, please start a new thread about how photoshop and excel are
better than xyz.

ps. we are not 'becoming' intolerant of proprietary software - we are
*already* intolerant of it. That is what this group is for.

You probably won't find any.

Btw, Gimp can very well be self taught.
I've pretty much used gimp manuals and done it .. and I use Gimp and
Inkscape both for my webcomic and other
drawings/pinups/business-cards/..almost everything that I draw digitally.

After manual much help is available on personal blogs like:
This guy's put some real good time (unlike me :| ) in putting together nice
tutorials that should get you to an intermediate level gimper.

You'd also find some tutorials on using script-fu in gimp with a little
search on the Internet.

Happy Drawing :)

I beg to differ. Its good to hear. But nothing here. :(. There are
forces acting against you.

1. Software patents used in PS. A *lot* of features of PS, which the
pros like are patented. - That is a separate fight altogether. (Use a
separate thread if someone wants to discuss this, please).

2. The Gimp code framework, in its original form couldn't support many
features (32 bits, lossless processing, CMYK to name a few). Hence,
they are currently trying to revamp the code and bring in a new GEGL
framework that will form the base for a refreshingly new code base,
that is faster, cleaner and expandable. Gimp 3.0 where are you?

3. Third party plugins. This is where you and I should contribute.
There are hundreds and thousands of plugins available for PS, which
make the life of a studio guy/ doctor/ anyone else easy. PS has a
separate version for Radiologists(!). It has a well integrated image
management solution as well.  There are a lot more, that I don't know.


AFAIK, we have a pretty long way to go before we can say we are
serious competitors. as of now, we are competing in a place where PS
is way tooooo good, and Gimp is (still) just a new kid in the block.

If you are really serious about what you said in your email, be the
example. Study DSP and Fourier transforms, and start writing code, and
not just heated words.

Generally, I get *irritated* if someone tells me, I don't know this
because, someone did not teach me. Not everything in life can be
taught.

The best way to learn anything is to get your hands dirty. If someone
has a starting trouble, they can seek help from someone who can offer
a one hour session. beyond that, there are tonnes of tutorials
available in many places, including YouTube. Infact, many of the
tutorials targeted at PS, also works for The Gimp, if you know where
to find the same filter in the menus.... a little bit of
experimentation would help.

The fundamentals of Photoshop, Corel Draw, Gimp, Paint .NET
(Opensource!), etc.. are all the same. If you learn to use one tool,
you learn the concept. You can now apply the concept in any other
tool.

The driving school usually teaches you driving on a Tata Indica or a
Maruthi 800 or a Hyundai Santro - all of them with 4 gears. When you
buy a car with 5 gears, you don't necessarily go to the driving school
again to learn to use the 5th gear. How about auto-gears then? Its
like that. Learn to use any of the aforementioned tools, and you will
find your way through any other tool. If you find classes only for PS,
so be it. Learn it there and apply it in The Gimp :-)

Natarajan.

Alive, yes.  Kicking,  not really.  They had a big problem not too long
ago where the organizations working with NetBSD were doing proprietary
forks without channelling those changes back and essentially stalling
the development almost entirely.   This mail was from one of the
founders of NetBSD btw.
