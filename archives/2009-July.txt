Hi,

in view of the upcoming Indian Python conference, I thought I would do some 
python advocacy to drum up interest. So here goes:

ok

@roshan, put this script somewhere in your mail filter:

!#/usr/bin/env/python

is_tamil=False
for char in subject_line:
	if ord(char) in range(int('0B80',16),int('0BFF',16)+1):
		is_tamil=True
if is_tamil:
	message.send(destination='/dev/null')

coding up message.send() and extraction of the subject_line are left as 
exercises for you ;-)

I was expecting that.. USB modems have multiple configurations. By
default, they use the mass-storage configuration, so when connected to
a system, a setup.exe (most vendors officially only support Windows)
is run which loads the drivers from the mass-storage and gets
installed, and subsequently switches to modem configuration for use.

Since you are using a GNU/Linux system, the drivers are available in
the Linux kernel, and they follow standards. So, it should work by
default. You only need to use usb_modeswitch to switch from
mass-storage to modem configuration. In your dmesg log, you should
then see a /dev/ttyACM0 device file entry.

Please see:
http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/

I am not sure if there is a GUI for this tool available (yet).

Hi All,

I  am working in ARM 9 board running Linux (2.6.16) , I have a requirement
to flash the mtd device  directly using web  interface via Ethernet, say
like router firmware up gradation.  I have a combined image of kernel and
root file system, which is about 5 MB,  I used thttpd server to achieve the
solution, but with thttpd there is a problem where if  the file size is
large then the connection gets timed out.  I'm searching for some web
server  with  non commercial  license, which will support my 5 MB file
upload requirement. Can someone please share your experience.

Thank you,
Krishna.

1. Try boa or lighthttpd for web service.
2. You can have this done by a shell script/ executable spawned
listening to a specific port. Look up the LEAF project and you'll see
a shell scripted webserver running using netcat.
3. Hope you've the scheme well worked out in case the burn gets hosed
for some reason. Common scheme is to boot next with new firmware which
is not the default (after the upgrade). In case it boots well and is
clean, the default flag is switched to the new firmware. Else a reboot
brings it back with older firmware. Same goes for configuration
changes too where commit alone makes it default else change is for
that session alone.
4. You'll be better off working with a package manager to be able to
carry out the upgrade in packages thus reducing total upgrade payload
very often.

Also Ubuntu live cd will not LAMP stack.

BTW, is this a project or a product? If it is a product, I think the
firmware to be so heavy. I've built router devices with under 750KB
images with kernel at 360KB (2.4.18). If it is a product, you also
need to pay attention to image management, config management, log
management, package/feature management etc.

I remember we finally used one called GoAhead webserver. It requires
acknowledgement by display of its logo as powered by GoAhead
webserver. It needs permission to be used under a open licence. We
went for it as we could get support, if need be.

Thanks a lot Mohan.
1. It is a product.
2. I ll try with the list of servers you mentioned, I know about lighttpd,
but i thought since it is used in many websites , it must be huge like
apache.
3. I have not decided how to handle the brick mode, its the intial stage
where I am trying to see if things work.
4. package management is not possible atleast for this type of image as its
a single image containing kernel and file system , and on boot up the image
is loaded on RAM. since it is combined, the particular partition say mtd1
(5MB size)  will have kernel for 1 MB size and filesystem follows it , so i
cannot mount the file system.


Bye,
Krishna.

I'd again suggest you take a good look at the LEAF project. You can
have a shell scripted rudimentary package manager which does not
necessarily resolve dependencies.

You can split the whole file system into bare minimum and packages
that can be added on. Keeping the chunk  per transfer request smaller
increases robustness.

Kernel of 1MB seems like a regular desktop kernel. Prune it down to
the bare minimum and load modules as needed. I'm shooting without a
target here. If you describe the product, then the community could
give ideas on kernel compile options and pruning.

In case you want to discuss this in greater detail and want to take it
offline, you are welcome. I'm not sure if this will be of general
interest.

Friends.

Today, had a discussion with MS Office Lovers to test OpenOffice.

They had deep love over the UI and the fancy functions.

They tried writer and spreadsheet.

We compared with Word and excel 2007.

Really, OO lacks in more usability points.

We have to report it to the OO team.

I wish that it will be nice if OO has a brainstorm site so that
users can report their wishes and ideas.

How to make this happen?

6. Will be good to archive and receives newsletters of foss news  (by
shrinivasan)
7. We could use calender, event and signup module to organize and
track ilugc meets
8. I wounder why the current site maintainer is using is his own theme
when there are a lot of GPL Licensed free themes and theme devlopment
framework.
9. Will be good to have global site contact form to report broken
links and spams.


anyhow its a good effort by current maintainer.

I also suspect you are working with standard unix/linux OS utilities
and so it seems bloated. In embedded systems, it is normal to use
Busybox which is a single executable that can substitute about 50
commands/ utilities albiet with limited options which suffice most
often. Links need to be created in /bin for every utility with the
utility name as argument to busybox. It is an extremely nifty piece of
work and is thus appropriately referred to as the Swiss Knife for
embedded systems. [1]

You can look up these for a shell scripted web server example [2] [3].
Reading these reminded me that you could use socat as an alternative
with its myriad and powerful options. [4]

The OP wants a webserver to run on an appliance and is using that to
transfer files to the box as a means to update the firmware.
Publicfile is for repositories to serve files/images. This is relevant
only to the extent that the product needs a repository to serve
images. If the OP is building a product, I doubt he would want to
provide unauthenticated access to his images.

No I dint put the question in terms of standard UNIX tools approach,  in
fact i can use the httpd  applet in busybox.
The problem is that earlier I was using thttpd web server to create some cgi
scripts for monitoring certain information from the board. as the firmware
up gradation feature was needed i tried with another CGI to upload the file.
There is a major problem with thttpd in uploading big files say more than 1
MB , the connection will get timed out. Now I have to search for another web
server where this problem will not be there. I am trying all the web server
whatever i come through. I ll look try the server you mentioned suitable for
my need and let you know.

If what you need to do is monitor the box and upload images without
any heavy duty web application for configuration etc, I'll go with
netcat to execute the utilities and pipe the output to the connection
and wget/curl/socat in conjunction with it to fetch/ images files from
your repository. If your access is security sensitive and worries
about password going in clear text, then use a webserver like boa or
GoAhead.

IMHO, fetching the images using these utilities on the box is a better
approach than trying to upload an image using http(s). Further, these
utilities support retries/ resumes which will be useful in times of
flaky access.

Replying to my own post. I'm proven to be a dinosaur :-(. Discovered
that a SSL capable nc (that too two different options) is available

The way the link is structured in your post, I get 404 because the 
string "hope it helps :)" is part of the URL string.

To avoid such foobar I suggest links to be stated on a line of it's own 
within <> e.g.

<http://cityblogger.com/archives/2009/04/09/tata-indicom-photon-and-reliance-netconnect-broadband-on-ubuntu>

I believe most MUAs will not auto wrap such lines (at least KMail does 
not)

Distros ship this package. You don't need to install from source. In
Fedora, you can do:

  # yum install usb_modeswitch

 Speed in linux or  in general?
  I just browsed a single site in ubuntu and had to switch to another OS.But
it was good to use, with a very reasonable speed.

I suggest CentOS, if the setup is for production; long term support,  
tested/stable packages from upstream (RHEL).

There are two aspects to "Cloud Computing". That of using the
infrastructure as a client and that of setting up services for use in
the cloud.

I imagine that the first aspect does not really depend much on which
O/S one is using so it would only be for the latter that a group like
ILUG-C would be involved.

Please do correct me if I am wrong.

Like I told I already have some few CGI scripts running in the web server,
when i tried to add a web based firmware upgrade feature i found the big
file upload problem, I cannot do a netcat if in that case my other CGI
scripts cannot be handled. security is not an issue here. I wanted to know
if any one has worked in any embedded web server for uploading huge files,
so that I can rely on the fact and try that.

This actually depends on the update/upgrade scheme you have conceived.

Option I:
User uploads firmware via the web from his desktop. Then you would
need to do what you are asking for i.e upload using HTTP.

Option II:
User logs on to the Web UI on the box and clicks a "Download Firmware"
button which will fetch the image from a known location or a location
given by the user on the webpage. This will invoke wget/curl
internally to download the image. If it is asynchronously spawned,
you'll need to look at refreshing the page with a log output to give a
semblence of synchrony.

Can you not execute wget or curl using CGI on the box using the same
webserver you have currently? This way, your older CGI scripts will
still work and you will have a working mechanism.

Out of curiosity, what language is this web interface written in (perl,
php,...), and what is the version of thttpd you are using? What
does /var/log/thttpd.log say when these file uploads fail?

Message-ID: <5337b2c90907020557vd310c4bha07dc906a09fcabb@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all!

I used Ubuntu on my laptop and i am totally comfortable with it; other than
that, I am little new to linux and working to set up LAMP system to do web
development.

So, i am kind of confused which OS to choose! i was thinking UBUNTU is the
best,
but fedora 11 is pretty close to ubuntu as far as basic uses are concerned,
but now that i want do do development on it, i am little confused, I am only
going to development, and not really choosing and server, so do you think
FEDORA 11 or UBUNTU 9.04 is ok? or should i go for CentOS or something else,
your proffessional view will really help this amateur.

sincerely

That depends on what you consider as criteria.

CentOS may be an overkill for web development. If you are not going to
run a server
, any distro is fine.

A simple answer - Just choose a distro that you are most comfortable
with. Your distro isn't going to do the work for you, it's you who
will have to do it. All the distros can perform as well. You need to
be more choosy if you're going for something very critical or very
specialised.

Awesome. Thank you. By the way, why not just add .*faniq.com to the
header_filter_rules under Privacy Options ? Spam Filters? That'll take
care of that site at least and will save you some trouble in the long

The problem in using web server to upload huge files is that the web server
stores the uploaded file in a temporary folder which in most cases means it
is stored in RAM. Considering the fact that the uploaded data is encoded as
multipart/form-data you would need more than 4/3*5 MB of _free_ RAM. If you
don't have sufficient RAM then you should think of other ways.
- Like a server listening on a port in the board and uploading the firmware
via a java applet.
- Patching the web server to directly decode multipart/form-data and
directly writing it to the flash.

That's a good answer!

This sounds nice but may be misleading. Indeed, you need to get
comfortable with a distro before you can make informed choices. This
is a bit of a "chicken and egg" problem!

The basic point is "plan ahead".

As Ashok Gautham wrote, if you are planning to do development work
then choose an O/S which favours developers --- and Fedora is a good
choice here. Other choices are Debian "testing", Arch Linux and
so on.

If you are planning to set up a server, then choose an O/S that
provides long-term support. A server should generally be built on the
principle "If it isn't broken, don't fix it." Hence, a choice like
RHEL/CentOS, Debian "stable", Ubuntu LTS would make more sense here.

If you want to get bleeding edge now and are willing to work on the
stabilisation, then you can also choose the development versions now
and choose to upgrade more slowly towards a "stable" version. For
example, you can install Debian "testing" but keep with the release
as it becomes "stable". Similar things are possible with Ubuntu ->
Ubuntu LTs and I suppose Fedora -> CentOS as well.

Regards,

Kapil.

Hi,

Once i checked it using speednet ,

Download speed= .72 Mbps
Upload speed= .28Mbps

But for the last 2 days ,during night times in my locality ,i could not able
to browse(dead slow).I have registered a complaint to Photon +.If that gets
solved,really good one at some high cost.Also customer service is good so
far.

Subject: [Ilugc] Kernel crash
Message-ID: <b89799040907030045uf167d21ud6348d8e06cc582e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am running some fedora vms on a xenserver. These vms always seem to be
crashing for some reason or the other. Of late, I had installed netbeans and
was trying to run a web application. I noticed that the java process was
taking up a lot of memory, somewhere around 58%. Then all of a sudden the
kernel again crashed. How can I take the crash dump from such a machine and
whom should such reports be submitted to.

I have attached a file with what was displayed in xen-console of the VM.

Regards,
Ashish

You missed
"its a deprecated tool you should no longer be using."
Which is what you're referring to.

Nice to see Ubuntu LTS listed beside RHEL/CENTOS and Debian "stable" .. hmm

Ubuntu project has come a long way with it's emphasis on the desktop
user . Most of the computer reviews( less geeky and desktop based one
) kind of equate Ubuntu to GNU/Linux .

I am happy to learn from ubuntu project success how a community can
grow if we remove basic/simple barriers from the new user . Ubuntu
forums as we all know are very user friendly and welcome people who
"can't google" rather than othe mailing lists which shun away newbies
and scare them away :(

Not everything is shiny in ubuntu . I definitely don't like the Wubi
project - windows installer for ubuntu :(
The question I always had is how far should ubuntu bend for "newbies " ??

Pavithran

It is not a question of newbies alone here. I got a HCL laptop having
Via Chrome for graphics. Ubuntu vanilla install failed but Wubi went
thro'. X was hanging on invocation in the vanilla install.

Did certainly help in this case where drives were not available. I
wish I had greater detail to show. I did this for my nephew's study
laptop and he is'nt here now.

Many laptops come with preinstalled OS. Tinkering with partitions,
installing Ubuntu standard (no custom) blows away the recovery
partition. For folks that do not want to go thro' the pain of
reinstalling windows, WUBI definitely helps. It is a good bridge to
let Ubuntu get on to a Windows machine and then take over the laptop,
once it has proven itself reliable/ useful for that specific user.

# yum repolist. Check if the repositories are enabled. Is this a fresh
installation or an upgrade from a previous release?

this is yum repolist:

I don't see RPM Fusion repository here. Either you haven't installed it
or it is installed but not enabled. Verify with

---

# rpm -q rpmfusion-free-release rpmfusion-nonfree-release
rpmfusion-free-release-11-1.noarch
rpmfusion-nonfree-release-11-1.noarch

---

If you have it installed go to System => Administration => Software
Sources to enable it.  Otherwise, install it first

# rpm -ivh
http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm
# rpm -ivh
http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm

Then do

# yum install gstreamer-plugins-{bad,ugly} gstreamer-ffmpeg

You should be all set. Mplayer et all is available in RPM Fusion as well.

But why doesn't it play ogg? ogg codecs are installed by default.

Hi,
I am looking for a linux VPS hosting service with the following criteria-

   - Full root access (ssh)
   - Preferably based in India with rupee billing
   - Would like to start of with minimal bandwidth and features as I would
   be using it to experiment/test concepts before deploying apps and hence need
   to be scalable in the future (4-5 months).
   - Initial budget of Rs.2,000/- to Rs 3,000/- per month.


Would like to have recommendations from this list.


Regards,
Arun Venkataswamy

1. slicehost
2. gandi

these fulfill all your requirements except 'based in India' and 'rupee 
billing'. If you have a credit card, payment is easy. I unreservedly recommend 
both. Slicehost is better, but I cannot use it because for some reason some of 
it's IPs are blocked by VSNL.

I would be interested to know whether there are any India based VPSs

Subject: [Ilugc] ssh & firefox
Message-ID: <f6c15e7d0907042224h53bea16bu906dcd24a686f063@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list ,
This is what I would like to do . I want to run firefox from a remote server .

1 . I need ssh -X access which rarely people give or firewalls allow :(

The other logical choice would be SSH tunneling where the browser
stays in my own home machine while every data which firefox
sends/recieves goes via the SSH tunnel which we create .
2. I doubt if firewalls allow tunneling or is there any filtering
mechanism to stop / restrict the incoming data ?

Yes I am quite confused and ignorant. Hence I m mailing this list with
hope that some one could clarify :)

Regards,
Pavithran

Yeah. This is like how RMS felt when they decided to  equate the entire GNU
stack with the Linux kernel to just linux. But those who care to know will
know. The rest will live in the bliss that is ignorance

1/3 of the questions on this mailing list can be answered by plain googling too.
Ubuntu was meant to be a linux for Human Beings. It has its place because it
bends itself towards newbies. Some use the middle ground (Debian/Fedora)
while some are plain power users (Arch/Slack). Each serves a purpose.

Can you verify if your ogg files are ok?

file <filename.ogg>

A corrupted file is possible.

For me ogg plays well on Amarok. It is the mp3s that dont work even with
the codecs installed. Anyway. My mplayer plays them all.

Tunneling, def. transmitting data in one protocol encapsulated inside
another protocol.

Theoritically, it is impossible for a firewall to detect if you're
browsing the web or tunneling an SSH connection in your HTTP request.
For example, a typical "default configuration" Squid HTTP proxy server
(yes, proxy is one of the many firewall techniques) allows only HTTP
requests to port 80 on target machines; the proxy server itself
accepts connections on port 8080.

In your case, I'm assuming that you would like to tunnel an SSH
connection through HTTP. This can easily be achieved using several
tools such as httptunnel.

I would also add Linode to the list. Though Slicehost in itself is 
pretty excellent, Linode offers more bang for the buck with more RAM and 
disk space for pretty much the same money. Also, Slicehost offers 
Xen-based VPSes on a x64 architecture, said not to be as 
memory-efficient as 32-bit machine based ones, offered by Linode:

This is not an accurate description of your problem! What you really
want is to access the internet via a remote computer (presumably
because your local internet access is filtered in some way).

In any case, remote X uses up a lot of bandwidth as compared with
proxy web access.

This is completely feasible.

 1. On the local machine you run
       ssh -f -q -N -D 1050 user@remote
    This starts a SOCKS5 server which tunnels requests through the
    remote server.
 2. You then configure a local firefox profile to use a
    "SOCKS5 proxy" at 127.0.0.1 with port 1050. This local firefox
    will get all its requests through the tunnel.

Note that SOCKS5 does not solve the DNS lookup. So this firefox
profile will still use the local DNS server for looking up domain
names. To solve this problem you will need to run a DNS cache and use
that as your DNS server or run a web proxy at the other end of the
tunnel and point your firefox to that.

Regards,

Kapil.

Is it just gnome-terminal? What about some other GNOME application? Does
gedit also take a long time to start? If so, it is worth seeing if
your /etc/hosts file contains a reference to your own hostname pointing
to a loopback IP. To find your hostname run:

	hostname

Your hosts file should have an entry similar to the following:

	127.0.0.1	localhost
	127.0.1.1	hostname

Naturally, if you have also set a fully qualified host name, that would
look like:

	127.0.0.1 	localhost
	127.0.1.1 	hostname.hostdomain hostname

If you want to try debugging this yourself, you might want to try
running strace to see where exactly all the time is being spent.

	strace gnome-terminal

Your java interpreter is not able to find org.apache.tools.ant.Main class.
You have to add ant.jar to classpath when you run the java.

Can you provide the full command which throws this exception?

This is usually _not_ a good solution. The less "things" that are
installed, the easier it is to figure out which thing is causing
problems.

> Still no sound. Am seriously thinking of shifting back to Mandriva

If you are certain that Mandriva will solve this issue and not
introduce new ones then by all means do so.

Usually, switching distros does not solve problems since all of them
are start from the same code base.

It is better to isolate the problem you are facing and write a precise
bug report. Either:
 (a) In the process of writing the bug report you will solve your
 problem
or,
 (b) After you submit your bug report, someone will suggest a fix.

Regards,

Kapil.

sound, wireless, bluetooth, projector all worked out of the box in Mandriva. 
Unfortunately libboost was b0rked. And since at that time libboost was more 
important than the others, I shifted to FC. Since I have finished my work with 
libboost, I am seriously thinking of going back. Frankly I am too old to get 
excited about debugging something as basic as sound.

This is quite frequently asked. I personally feel one should use
bluefish/<any text editor> for  authoring  web pages. This is not
a WYSIWYG interface. But it will allow you to gain greater control
over your web pages. However, if you are in a hurry, use KompoZer
which is "almost" a successor to nvu. It is a WYSIWYG tool.

Also, try kde webdev tools

I think your CLASSPATH variable is not set properly. Can you add
ant.jar (full path for the ant.jar) in your CLASSPATH variable and
try?


>

> org.apache.tools.ant.Main -e -f src/installer/resources/build.xml "$@"

You can also try by changing the classpath value in above line in the
script. Change "$LOCALCLASSPATH" to
"$LOCALCLASSPATH:${fullpathofant.jar}"

You can use rpm -ql ant to find where the ant.jar file is located.

tools like dream weaver are meant for people who do not understand design, css 
and html. The best way is to make a mock up in The Gimp and then hand code the 
css, javascript and html. Use of frameworks like jquery and blueprint make the 
job very easy.

Thanks a lot now.The problem is really with the classpath.All of the above 3

man xrandr
man xorg.conf
I haven't tried the new Ubuntu but
dpkg reconfigure xserver-xorg
should take you through the wizard to configure xorg.
Also, if you're using KDE, it has a nice tool called krandr which is a
GUI tool to allow you to adjust the resolution.

man xrandr
man xorg.conf
I haven't tried the new Ubuntu but
dpkg reconfigure xserver-xorg
should take you through the wizard to configure xorg.
Also, if you're using KDE, it has a nice tool called krandr which is a
GUI tool to allow you to adjust the resolution.

One of two things I can come up with:
1. Check the flash plugin you've installed for the web browser.
2. Check audio output. If you're routing it through pulseaudio, make
sure the plugin supports output through it.

There are many things you could clean up. The package cache (depends on
distro), The logs (It is better if you use logrotate to automate this).
The /tmp however need not be cleaned. /tmp is a tmpfs that works from swap
and  memory. So you need not bother about that. You can clean up through
mozilla. You may also clean up .bash_history. This too, I think has a size.
It rotates once it reaches a size (Typically 1000 lines). Run an updatedb so
that your locates are zippier.

Additionally you can clean up all your cache/trash directories; the 
following do the job

find ${HOME} -type d -iname '*cach*' -exec rm -fr {}/* \;
find ${HOME} -type d -iname '*tras*' -exec rm -fr {}/* \;

Please note the syntax and read up on find if you have any doubts.

You can schedule cron jobs to do above at regular intervals.

At system level /tmp and /var/tmp at boot time.  Some distros have 
settings to do so in the boot up scripts.

Generic disk cleanup programs are pretty much useless, which is
probably why they don't exist. It depends on what you want, how much
space you're looking to recover, and on which filesystems. For
example, removing your shell history log will gain you a few KB at
most, at the cost of all your shell history! Similarly, the gains of
cleaning up package cache isn't necessarily justified. Logs are very
lightweight too. Besides, on my systems, /var is a separate LVM
partition dedicated to storing logs and package manager cache for the
most part.

First, find out which filesystems you're looking to recover space on,
then find out which folders/ files occupy large chunks of disk space
using a disk space analyzer like Baobab, Kdirstat, or simply du.

One final tip: If you're looking to gain space on / or /boot, remove
older kernels and corresponding kernel modules from /lib/modules.

Did you try preferences->screen resolution in gnome interface?.
If not try. Otherwise post details of

Message-ID: <4A532035.1050704@itforchange.net>

Dear All,

One of my friends who is a journalist with a newspaper in Chennai wants 
to do a story on FOSS in chennai schools.
I know about an ELCOT program where they wanted to use foss in 
corporation schools.

Other than this, do you know if any private/state government schools 
uses FOSS as part of their curriculum/computer training?

If you do know such schools, can you please pass on the details to me by 
mailing me at vinay at itforchange dot net ?

Thanks!
Vinay.

It appears that NASSCOM did not engage in a conversation with the
industry before coming out with the statement. And, hence you'd notice
a lot of the industry participants within NASSCOM voicing their
concern.

Thanks for the link. I think you will notice more drama around
e-governance in the near
future as easy outsourcing money based on bloated head counts and
billing rates dry
up. The BigCos will now turn to milking the local tax payer. A few days back
I read a report about a dozen plus top outsourcing companies pleading with
the government to invest more in local projects.

http://infotech.indiatimes.com/IT-Inc-wants-better-infrastructure/articleshow/4724345.cms

Of course all of this will be done under the guise of infrastructure,
speeding up
passport processing, unique identity, etc.

Hi to all,

I am Arulalan . T doing Final year M.C.A in Saveetha Engg College , Chennai.

Now I am studying fifth semester.

This semester we have " Software Project Management " ( Theory Paper ).

For this subject having one lab, namely called , "  Software Development Lab " .

In this lab, we have to do 10 small projects.

I planned to do all the following syllabus projects using " Ruby On Rails ".

But my Staffs are not supporting to do this semester projects in other
Languages.

They preferred only  " VB and ORACLE" , because they know that only.

Even though I was fighted with them and finally, they said OK to do in RoR.

But now my HOD is opposing to that.

He s asking me, while doing "  University Practical Examination, the
External examiner will not accept your projects means, what can you do
? " .

what can i do ?

Give me all your suggestions !

and I need NRC FOSS support to do my 5th sem simple projects in Open
Source(RoR).

( * they doesn't oppose to do my final semester projects in Open-Source *)

How can i approach this problem?

Dear Arulalan,

In the web site, it is clearly mentioned as "Any front end tool", "ANY BACKEND TOOL" and "ANY CASE TOOL".  It did not mention, not to use Open Source.  So, you can approach the university and submit your grievances.  Of not knowing about open source tools, the external examiner cannot refuse your genuine project. If they not agree, they accept that they are incapapble of learning new technologies and unfit to validate your graduation!!!  Please do not hesitate to approach the higher authorities of the University.

Regards,
Rajendhran

Already Jaya Engineering college guys are using Umbrello and python for CASE
tools lab( i guess).You could post your hod's email address are something
here so that people from NRCFOSS or Jaya Engineering college can contact him
back regarding the issue.

I was looking at the 3rd and 4th sem IT syllabus (The Revised one). I was upset
to find that though gcc was allowed for Data Structures, for OOPS (they teach
ANSI C++) they have specified TurboC++ only.

This is a clear display of miscommunication between the panel that decides the
syllabus and the panel that sets the tools (If two exist).

I cannot see how Turbo C++ is recommended for ANSI C++.(They are recommending
TC++ 3.0. A pre-standard-namespaces incompliant C++ compiler)

If they and you are ready to release the source code under a F/OSS
license, and if NRC-FOSS (Kenneth, any thoughts?) agrees to be a
mentor for the project, you can tell them that this project will be
worked under NRC-FOSS guidance, and you can work with me on the same.

A client has a setup of heterogenous desktop setup and wants to

The composition is 80% Linux desktop + 2 Linux File servers (NFS+Samba), 
7 OSX desktops and 5 Windows XP desktops).

The user's Unix (Linux/OSX) profile is portable to the respective 
platform via LDAP and Windows profile is portable through Samba. 
Samba+LDAP back end needs to be configured on 2 Linux file servers as 
well on the OSX server (for user's home dir).

Sounds good!

@Arul:
1. Please confirm that you can release the source code under a F/OSS license.
2. Please request and collect an official letter from NRC-FOSS, and
hand it over to your HOD and faculty (in a friendly manner) that you
will work with NRC-FOSS for the projects.

Let me know when you are done with this, and we can take this further.

Thanks,

I did my BE in SEC 2 years back and had this same lab course.
The same arguments went on and on with the lecturers and me.
After 3 months, no work was done (even by the other students) and the
final exam was to draw the UML diagrams for the applications in paper
and subimt.

Hope atleast you guys get to do the projects.
All the best.

Will this live webcast be available on a public IP? I could see in the
webcast page "If mplayer is already installed do the following:
mplayer http://10.129.200.210/event1" which is a private IP address.
Will this be changed to a public IP which everyone can access?

Thank You.

Hi to all ,

Thanks to

Kish  Rajendhran  ArunSAG   Ashok   ShakthiKannan  kg  Bharathi  Srinivasan
R . . .

Really i am very happy by seeing all of your support.

Today my Hod went to other college as external, so i can't talk with him.

But i talked with all of my staffs and explained about FOSS in a friendly
manner.

They said, they are willing to support to me , to do project in OpenSource.

So, we planned to talk with HOD tomorrow.

Hopefully,  he will not oppose us to do in RoR.

And i am willing to do all of my projects under GPL (FOSS) License .

If any problem will arise , surely i will get  support letter from NRC
FOSS..


Once again Thanks to all .

I will  be update , what will happen tomorrow . . .

Check whether your database server is up and running. If not start it first
and try again.

Hi, Padmanadhan,

This is the oldest complaint against the GNOME desktop (the inability to
configure obvious settings of a screensaver). Anyway, I'll assume you're
talking about GLText.

Reading GLText's man pages will let you know that you can make it
display any text you want:

	/usr/lib/xscreensaver/gltext -text "Cats are cute."

or display the output of a program that is run every 5 seconds by saying
stuff like:

	/usr/lib/xscreensaver/gltext -program "iwconfig wlan0 | grep link -i"

Now, you probably want this to run automatically, so what you'll have to
do is edit the file at
"/usr/share/applications/screensavers/gltext.desktop". In that file, you
should see an entry like the following:

	Exec=gltext -root

You will probably want to change it to something like the following:

	Exec=gltext -root -text "Kittens like spinning text."

They really should have a graphical interface for this sort of thing.

Hello Arulalan,

The University syllabus is not so specific that the students need to use Vb
and Oracle. You can choose your own choice. The final outcome is need to
complete the application.

Definitely  the External wont oppose the work done by the student
differently.  unless your HOD and staff didnt tell anything bad about you.

At the same time being final year student, dont have any quarrel with the
faculty and HOD, politely you can tell him the features of Open source.
Quote some of the colleges those who are really working on Open Source. Try
to convince them. If they are backing you definitely there will not be any
problem.

For this issue and all the NRCFOSS and the Univerity wont help as of now.
The problem to be sort out in the college itself.

Still most of the colleges not having much awareness on open source. The
faculty members are not minding to learn new things. ILUGC and NRCFOSS are
putting lots and lots of effort to take the open source in the academic
level. Without institution co-operation its very difficult to initiate.

If the management knows the cost factor definitely they suggest to go for
Open source tools. The management need some sort of IT advisors to suggest
open source otherwise the management doesnt know the happenings.

As  ILUGC member we are very happy to see the student doing their practical
work in RoR. You can spread the spirit to your classmets and juniors.

We are also using Umbrello, Python and MySQL for application development lab
(CASE Tools Lab) for VII sem B.E(CSE) and V sem B.Tech(IT). We are very
comfortable with this. Students also learning interestingly.

The community always helps .. all you need to do is ask :D

Glad that you asked . I call upon all engineering students  in this

I bet the list would help you .

There is a problem with this site. I asked for a password reminder by
e-mail and the mail is being rejected at our gateway since the mail
does not have a valid sender.[*]

This will probably be a problem with other mails sent by the web-site
as well.

Regards,

Kapil.

[*] It is probably true that our mail exchanger is too strict about
compliance in such matters but that is not likely to change in
the near future!

Message-ID: <20090710013030.GA8485@imsc.res.in>

Hello,

Since this topic was extensively discussed in the past, perhaps
people will find the following document interesting:

 http://behdad.org/text/

It looks like a lot of work is still required on correctly rendering
Indic text. Anyone up to the challenge?

Regards,

Kapil.

there is another problem also - much more serious. I requested a password 
reminder as a test. I then found that my current password had been reset and I 
could not login. This means that I can happily disable passwords for anyone if 
I know the username. The proper procedure is to send a mail saying 'someone, 
possibly you, has requested a password change, if it is you blah blah, 
otherwise just ignore the mail'. The link should lead to a change password 
form.

The site may required little more testing and patching here and their. Why
cant we test and log all these issues in the Wiki/Issue tracker,  so that I
could help the team to fix those bugs as earlier as better.

where is the issue tracker? It would also be helpful is the source code of the 
site is released - much easier for us to help out.

+1 on this. We require more eyes on this.

Also if 4 -5 people could join together in order to maintain ilugc.in
and chennailug.org that will be great. Right now we are unsure who
holds chennailug.org. Few weeks back, chennailug.org was parked, now
suddenly we had it up and running, but we didn have any email in the
mailing list saying I am the person who made the site up again, so
still many of us are confused about it!

Having said that I am ready to come up with a planet for Ilugc (like I
did for http://planet.tce.edu/) and help in maintaining the website
along with others.

Thank You.

Why cant we use a Wiki  or an Issue tracker from NRCFOSS website if it has
one. So that the data would be accountable and accessible.

It would also be helpful is the source code of the
> site is released - much easier for us to help out.

+1. Please concern person revert back to this.

Some one said, upgrading pidgin to latest version 
solved this problem.

I fixed it by changing the page server from

W3 says(for status code 503) it might be because of 
server overload, you could have got this status code 
from you proxy server.

No the site has nothing to with Jaya Engineering college folks. It is
maintained by some freelance who pretend to be using drupal since 4.x. I
even spoke with him to get the site credential and help him but he seems to
be not interested and i gave up.

I am glad to maintain that site, setting up meeting tracker, planets and
newsletters for ilugc.

Drupal developers are not nuts to have such a stupid password reset program.
I tried to reproduce the same in latest version drupal 6.13 it didn't work
like you said.

If you still think that it is a bug please do report it here
http://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal not in ilugc mailing list :P

  we have very few Tamil fonts which are really free, even those that are

    I'm in process of creating new Tamil fonts over the next few months. I
would like to seek the co-operation of people who are good at computer aided

At the end of the day, Don't  we know, to whom the site belongs too.

If the concern person is not going to listen to this, then what is  going to
be the outcome of this postings [1].

this is an issue with ilugc website, so it is reported here. For example, 
nrcfosshelpline.in is built with django - I am not asking anyone to report 
bugs in that site to the django buglist. It is for the maintainer to look into 
the matter and find out whether it is a drupal bug or not and do the needful.

I do not think this is the way to do it. You need an artist to create a font 
in the good old traditional way. Then you need to scan them in and digitalise 
them. If the artist is good, he will have to be paid. Funds can be raised for 
that. If he is paid, he hands over the copyright so then the fonts can be 
released under a free license. Find a good artist - we will find the funds.

Agreed. Drupal never works like you said, unless you do some vandalism in
the name of customization.

 From the archives, chennailug.org seems to be maintained by Balachandar 
Muruganantham. I'm not sure who owns ilugc.in, though. I've already 
raised this issue once. Right now, we don't need something as 
heavy-weight as durpal to run the site.

As a few people have already suggested on this site, we can go even with 
simple static html pages for the required info to go up. These can sit 
in a public svn/git repo until somebody thinks it's good to go for a 
wiki. But I really don't think we'll need a wiki - how hard is it to 
check out an svn repo with static html files, fix it, commit it, and 
have a moderator deploy the latest revision?

If we can get hold of the guy(s) who has either chennailug.org/lugc.in 
domain control and move it to somebody who's more available/involved 
with the community (or perhaps transfer it to NRC-FOSS?), we can easily 
setup a vps (I'm sure we can easily contribute to the $20 USD per month 
it takes to rent one) and get things moving. We can even setup the 
planet software that SK has been requesting for a long time.

Vamsee.

P.S: Perhaps the time has come for ILUGC to setup a legal entity so that 
donations/funds can be managed properly, but this is a much bigger 
topic, so perhaps we should get the site going first and then get into this.

Hello All,

I have been maintaining the chennailug.org site and ilugc.in (which started
few days ago)

I am listening to all the discussion going on here and i am curious to see
lots of people eager to help make the chennailug website up and running.
Thanks for all your interests.

First of all, I would like to inform you guys that chennailug.org domain is
owned by some body whom i have never met. All i have is the credentials to
web hosting. After the domain expiry, i have no control over it. Even now i
am not sure about who owns it or who renews it. I was using CivicCRM +
Drupal + Mediawiki in the chennailug.org site

after so much pain because of spam (since web hosting supported only php4, i
am not able to use much of spam controlling plug-ins), i have data porting
to the new  site i.e http://ilugc.in which i registered few days back.

I have never formally announced the release of new ilugc.in. Even before
announcing / releasing it for public use, some people here have tried it and
gave their feedback.

The ilugc.in is not yet a completed product. hence what ever you see may or
may not work. I dont know how people talk about some thing which wasnt
released for public.

I can assure you that ilugc.in is the site under implementation of what we
want. It will be soon released before the end of this month.

the reason for going with Drupal because earlier we were using it. hence i
have migrated all the 1600 users to the new drupal version. yet to move the
contents of old wiki to new wiki.

Do you have the contact details (at least email) of who owns it? I 
personally think ilugc.in is much better for a domain name - easier to 
remember and pass on.

Are you ready to donate/transfer ilugc.in to somebody who can maintain 
this on a more regular basis? As far as I know, you're no longer in 
Chennai, and obviously you will be that much more hard-placed to 
maintain it/stay involved than somebody who is local and has more direct 
involvement in ILUGC proceedings (say people like Bharathi).

Why the insistence on Drupal? And why is the community not being 
consulted on how to move forward? If you intend to run this as a 
personal project, you should let us know so that we can make other 
arrangements. Can you please list your objections to having a simple 
site with static pages (initially at least) with the code being open on 
a public repo? Do we really need polls and other junk that Drupal offers?

Vamsee.

how can you put something in production when it is not working properly. Do 
you realise you are using the ilugc name? Why do you not develop on your local 
machine - or even on a staging server?
>

it has been released and is sitting on the internet and hundreds of people are 
using it. I suggest you switch it off. Further I feel your attitude is not in 
tune with the spirit of free software. Many people are coming forward to 
contribute, but you are refusing their help. If you develop in a proprietary 
manner, the site will be unsafe and frequently hacked. Ilugc is one of the 
biggest and best LUGs in the world and you have no right to spoil our name 
like this. Every one will laugh at us for putting up a half baked site in 
production. And you also have no right to build a site according to your own 
design without consulting the list. If you are serious about this, start a 
thread and ask for opinions. I do not consider your site the official site of 
ilugc, and I strongly object to your misusing the group name in this manner. I 
request you to hand over the domain to Bharathi or Raman and we will take it 
from their in a true FOSS manner.

As previously mentioned several times we have plenty of space on NRC-FOSS 
server and can host a site as Vamsee has suggested. Or a VPS costing 20$ a 
month, or even reliable shared hosting like webfaction which is even cheaper.

Insistence on Drupal is just like any other which can be used for
maintaining the site. Earlier version of chennailug.org was running
drupal(civicrm) which was setup by me. surely ilugc.in is not my pet or
personal project. i have my website running in drupal where i do all sorts
of experimentations.

simple static site - is as dead. chennailug.org or ilugc.in site should be a
community based with lots of activity in it. for e.g CD's for Grab wiki was
more popular with which large number of people have been benefited. you cant
do such things with simple static.

the need of polls on the site is for the member to get some thing out of it.


for e.g Which Distro do you think would change the way people look at Linux
in India?
see the results here http://ilugc.in/node/43/results
almost 595 people have voted. This is some thing kind of activity which you
need for the community. everything can't be done with mailing list or with
static pages.

I am not a great fan of drupal. I am not using all the junk(which you think)
that drupal is giving.

I am using features which are necessary for the community. how did i decided
those things? i have  gone through many LUG websites, open source project
websites. activity like these gives the new people about the health of the
community.

i hope you would understand. i can also send you all the plan for the
ilugc.in which i am executing right now.

i love chennai LUG and i have been with it for long time.

i never said that ilugc.in will not work properly. i said ilugc.in is in
kind of beta now(not a completed product.)
I have been developing everything on the local machine. i do have the
staging server and all sorts of dev. env. which everyone uses.

I disagree with your statement. i use free software at work and at home. you
cannot judge one's spirit on the mailing list. i have never refused people
who are coming forward to contribute. people who came to me just gave
suggestions and left. they are not in a position to sit and work. most of
the time, they dont want to do what needs to be done. they want to do what
they like to do. i have refused only those people. It is common in free
software development that you aim for some thing. if some one comes with
different aim, would you accept that?

lol. i am using Drupal which is  FOSS using by NASA and other big shots. do
you think it will be unsafe / frequently hacked?

what do you mean by our name? i am part of ChennaiLUG and i am continued to

how can you say that i have no right? i have every right to do the design. i
have informed about site status now and then.
sure. i will start a thread and ask for opinions.

come on. its not my site first of all. i have never announced it as a
official one. FYI, i am not misusing the group name by putting anything
wrong in it. go check the website content first before telling anything.

what do you mean by true FOSS manner? can you explain?

its not about hosting the site. its about making it for people to use it.
have you ever found that chennailug.org is down? it was down because of the
renewal. as i said before, i do not own the domain at all. i have no clue
who owns it.

Dear luggies

It will be great to have a site with all frills like wiki, polls, forum and anything else under the sun. It is like a five star hotel lunch, fine no one says no. But we cannot go without food for 1 or 2 months for the sake of it. So basic precondition should be that the front page should be always up with bare minimum details like:

a.Brief intro to our lug
b.Info about joining mailing list
c.Next meeting schedule.

Let everything else drupal,mambo,jumbo,plone or whatever it be linked from this static page, so that we will never loose our face in public, whatever - spam, database crash -may happen.

Raman.P

Contributors can work decentralized, push their static web pages to

For a change, can it be a website *committed* by its contributors?

I personally appreciate your work, its a nice website you have done a great
job!

 But i guess he (kenneth) wants you to do the work in more collaborative
manner, like getting ideas from all (using some kindof wiki), using a VCS
like git, so that every  one can look into the code and suggest changes ,
fix bugs etc.I guess you are already starting a thread regarding it :)

Thanks and Regards

Message-ID: <28ac23fb0907100626g6c9c798dmac72aaafb9f43e76@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Friends,
      I m Balachandar.K.M,Final year B.Tech Information Technology
student,Kongu Engineering college,Erode.I developed a open source
community with the help my friends and staffs in my college
(http://klosc.wordpress.com).But We are really in need of some FOSS
center like the one in MIT (started by indian ministry,where amachu
sir is working,I m a great fan your speech sir).
       So i want to setup a good resource setup in my college for us
to grow in the world of open source.I have no idea how to attract the
FOSS organizations to my college.
      Is there any organizations who can create a center in our
college to motivate our students or providing really valuable courses
to us.
      If any organizations will do that I m sure that our college will
add a lot of young developers to the FOSS world.

                  I need all your assistance friends.I hope you all
understood what i m looking for.
                          Thank you,

           with regards,

                 Balachandar.K.M

Why want to fear, when ILUGC is there.  The ILUGC  and its members are doing
quite an excellent job in promoting and supporting the FOSS related
activity in educational institutes.

Please ensure that mail generated from the site/domain is "proper" if
you generate mail at all. It is better not to have outgoing mail at
all than to have a mail service which works only sometimes.

A site which generates mail should satisfy (at least) the following
requirements.

 1. Use a well-configured and well-maintained smtp daemon
    like postfix/exim.

 2. Use a well-defined return address for outgoing mail to
    which bounces will go.
    (You could send bounces to /dev/null but bounces _must_ be
    accepted by the sending server).

 3. A valid mail administrator address like postmaster@ilugc.in.
    This means that you have to have some means to handle this
    mailbox. If there is a problem with your mail server how is
    someone to inform you about this otherwise?

Regards,

Kapil.

You are grossly under estimating your own potential. In the present internet era, You don't need a big foss organisation to learn/develop foss. What you need is a community in your college, which anyway was flourishing sometime back in your college. Just revive it. Your college has fantastic resources, encouraging faculty (atleast that was how when visited few years back).

Apart from promition of FOSS, please have some target for the community - like tce, madurai where college student info system is created and maintained by students.

ILUGC is always willing to help by way of tutorials, workshops etc.

The first time activation client is available only for Windows (right
now) and once that is done, just inserting it does the job.

IITM has a CentOS mirror:
    http://ftp.iitm.ac.in/centos/5.2/isos/x86_64/

If you go to the LUG meet today, I'm sure you can connect to
the IITM network and download the iso images easily.

Responsibility is not given to you in F/OSS. You take it. We can only
tell you what to do. If you are hungry, you should take food, and eat.
At your age, we can't spoon feed you.

Hi,

I thought of giving a try for the fun of it. Just want to learn on my own 
whenever I get free time.

Can some experts suggest which one is better(Scheme or LISP), in terms of:
1. More commonly used
2. More practical
3. Easy to learn
4. Usefullness if I learn

Note: I do not want to start any flame war. So, people who are interested 
to do that, please stay away. I am hoping to get genuine and un-biassed 
answers.
:)

I searched in google. But could not get what I am looking for. Mostly it 
is biassed.

Thank you.

It has to be something with this climate. Even I started on lisp (3rd
lisp I am learning).

Well, I have done 3 lisps (bigloo [scheme], sbcl[common lisp] and elisp). Of
 the 3, the easiest to grasp was scheme. Common lisp is great on
performance and 1 site I visited told me that scheme did not support big
number crunching and large amounts of data but CL did. elisp was too domain
specific.

I suggest you do common lisp with http://gigamonkeys.com/book/ .
               Usage    Practicality    Ease   Usefulness
CL              9              10              7            8
Scheme      7               6               9            7
el                8              6               8            9

It's not that simple.  Just because they felt that there are better
ways to introduce people to CS in the 21st century, doesn't take away
anything from the lessons of SICP.

How could Guile possibly be any mroe Usable, Practical, Easy or Useful
than Scheme?  It's just an older scheme, isn't it?

And if you look at usage, Emacs Lisp is probably the most widely used
Lisp in the world, so it would rank highest in all categories except
maybe Ease of use.  But I couldn't really comment on that, since I
haven't done much in any of them.  (I still say it because of it's
lack of closures, and editor-specificity ...)

Karra used to be the resident Emacs(/Lisp) expert before he gave it
all up to become a PHB.   (This should wake him up and bring him
here.) :)

If you just want to learn for the fun of it, then I suggest that you
read the original paper of McCarthy as it explains the core of Lisp
and Scheme and a whole lot else. At the same time to learn something
practical start customising Emacs using lisp or by playing with
e-toys in squeak (which is a scheme implementation).

The differences between scheme, lisp, dylan and so on are minor unless
you get in very deep. (In fact it is difficult to define what one
means by lisp since there are so many implementations).

Some would say that you can easily program in lisp using any language
at all --- some are just more suited to it than others. (If you
figure out what this sentence means, then you have become a Zen
master at lisp.)

Regards,

Kapil.

Squeak is a Smalltalk implementation, I believe, and if anyone is
going to be reading the "Recursive Functions..." paper[1], then they
might want to accompany it with Paul Grahams commentary on it.[2]

Everything is biased. What is more important is to recognize the bias
and have some independent thinking. Paul Graham's various articles on
lisp (and other things) are a good read

Of course you can do job positing in this list but with some basic

The reason is it is used in a single application. I find very little usage of
elisp beyond emacs.

It would be more accurate to say that it is GNU's extension language,
which would neatly hide the fact no major GNU project actually uses
Guile.  Or any other major project for that matter.

A single application?!?!?  It's EMACS!  Who on earth would refer to
that as just "a single application"??

Although more seriously, I couldn't cite any references for my
assertion that Emacs Lisp is the most widely used Lisp, so I'm not
sure why I thought that it was.  But it still seems plausible, given
that Lisps are unpopular, but Emacs is not.  I should say QED or
something like that, but I'm sure you'll have counter-examples.

Hi,

I have subscribed to "A word a day" service from http://www.wordsmith.org/

Last week, the theme was "Words with three letters in alphabetic
sequence " and the first word to be featured on monday(last monday),
was "defenestrate".
Link: http://wordsmith.org/words/defenestrate.html
PRONUNCIATION: (dee-FEN-uh-strayt)
MEANING: verb tr.: To throw someone or something out of a window.
ETYMOLOGY: From Latin de- (out of) + fenestra (window).
USAGE:
"When someone in a Joe Lansdale novel is defenestrated, you feel like
shaking the glass shards out of your lap."
Jeff Salamon; The Further Adventures of Hap and Leonard; The Austin
American-Statesman (Texas); Jul 4, 2009 .


Richard M Stallman has written back to the sender, and it was featured
in the weekly summary email, and here it goes....:-)

From: Richard Stallman (rms gnu.org)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--defenestrate
Def: To throw someone or something out of a window.

To "defenestrate" a computer also means to install some other
operating system, such as GNU/Linux, in place of Microsoft Windows.

Hi,

A wiki and a planet to aggregate members' blogs might be nice...

Also, event announcements, and maybe reports/videos/audio, if someone
writes or uploads these. This could actually just be contained in the
wiki.

Localization to Tamil (and possibly other languages also - we're after
all, the INDIAN LUG at Chennai... ;-) ) would be pretty much a
no-brainer. But I'd suggest that all articles exist in English where
possible also.

Regards,
Shash

you need square brackets for the word 'Commercial', not angle brackets. Angle

Oh well. I think this has come far from the original topic. Yes, I
agree that emacs is more
than just an application. But it is still just _ONE_ application.

Thanks for the correction! All these languages tend to coalesce in my
mind after a while. :-(

I realise now that squeak's similarity to Lisp is only tangential.

So a better example for study is the scripts (script-fu) in Gimp.
These are written in a dialect of scheme.

Another remark which I recalled as I hit the 'y' key to send this
message is as follows.

I have often found it useful to learn a language by reading programs
written in the language.

If these programs make sense (after staring at them for a while)
_without_ the need to refer to a language definition text, then I am
usually certain that I will like (and understand!) the language.

If I can tweak the programs to do slightly different things then that
is even better!

  "We always learn to read before we learn to write!"

hi,
has anyone succeeded in running scilab 5.1.1 in gui mode in linux? I get a 
seqfault in FC11 and a google search shows a lot of similar complaints but 
does not seem to offer a solution. I am using the precompiled 32 bit binary. 
The -nogui option works.

Sorry to kick up an almost dead thread - I'm away on a vacation, so my
responses might be late, so kindly bear with me. That does not answer my
question - are you ready to transfer/donate it to a more active member(s) of
the community in case we go in for a more distributed management of the
site.

Again, the past choices need not justify the present. I don't think just
your familiarity or past choice will hold good for the current discussion
about how to go forward.

Really? Are you sure? What exactly stops any one in this community from
checking out the current site from an svn repo and making changes,
committing the changes, and asking somebody to deploy it? This is how all
open source projects work. I don't see why it wouldn't work with a highly
capable audience of this list.

Do you honestly think that will add value now? What we need is a stable site
which gives themost essential and updated info, which we are failing at now
(as Raman has aptly reminded us). Please remember YAGNI. This is fluff, and
I believe a lot of people out here agree with this.

Then ditch it. We'll try something else. I've maintained a drupal site
before, I know how much energy it takes in doing stuff that we can rather
spend on doing essential things.

It's nice that you finally asked the question on the list that you should

I don't question your loyalty to the community, Balachandar. I'm just asking
if somebody else who's more involved in the day to day isses of the
community will be better placed to take care of the site. This is based on
your past response times. Nothing personal, I hope you understand that too.
After all, we've met before and know each other pretty well :).

+1 on this too. I believe we cannot 'leave the technology' alone. After all,
this is a technical forum, so that topic should be open for discussion. A
lot members have asked a laundry list of services. Can we prioritize them
and put a date of release (even an approximate one, so that we won't go
through the blame game again) on each of them?

I believe this would be ideal:

1. The site with static pages, with code available as an svn repo on a
google code project.
2. Use the issue tracker that comes along with it to prioritize the
features.
3. Give deploy access to a few members, and commit access to any member who
specifically requests for it. The deployers will have the responsibility to
accept patches/commits and push them live.
4. Ask for people who are ready to do this in various roles.

For things like planet, jobs board, we can have a virtual host setup on the
same server, so it goes like this, ideally:

www.ilugc.in -> static pages deployed off a svn repo
planet.ilugc.in -> the planet software running on an apache vhost
jobs.ilugc.in -> an open source jobs tracker (jobberbase?)

And so on so forth. Any problem with that?

Vamsee.

this is the key point. We are an open source community. Everything we do must 
be open. MUST BE OPEN. Which means our website code must be publicly 
available. It also means that suggestions for improvements, wish lists and bug 
reports must be systematically made and archived. And it takes max 10 minutes 
to set up a repo, wiki and bugtracking system for this. There are hundreds of 
members of this list who are capable of doing this. It gives us a very bad 
name to see the work being done in a proprietary manner. I agree that not many 
people turn up when there is field work to be done - often due to time 
constraints, distance etc. But this is not field work. Let this be done as a 
matter of urgency.

further, if we have such a repo, change of hands of the person deploying it is 
dead easy. If one site gets b0rked, setting up another is easy. We will never 
be in the position where we say: 'I do not know who was running the previous 
site and where the code is'

from what I have seen of the discussion it does not appear that the present 
site is under version control at all - it looks like it is being tinkered with 
in production. This is not the way to deploy a site. It's ok if some college 
kids do a site with frontpage - but not ILUGC site.

the other thing of serious concern is i18n. Internationalisation of an 
application has to be done from the very beginning, otherwise it is a tedious 
job to go back and mark all the strings for translation. Coders tend to be a 
little lax and often do not mark the strings - opening the code will help us 
to check for that. btw, is the tamil translation of drupal strings done?

Also a call for action ;). I just registered ilugc.org, ilugc.com,
ilugc.info and ilugc.net just to protect them from squatting for one year. I
can keep renewing them for the foreseeable future, but I'm ready to transfer
them to anybody the community nominates to handle them.

I can also ping Linode or Slicehost and request them for a free vps in
exchange for a small banner ad for them at the bottom of the page. Or if
anybody wants to avoid that, we need to evolve a system for paying for the
server. Though I can afford that too, I don't want to put myself in a
position where I become a single-point contact for the site. I'd rather a
few or all of us share the costs and responsibilities.

Also, it would be nice to know who signed up for twitter.com/ilugc - it

if we have a website, a few lines of code are all that are needed to

Can you check whether the following libraries are installed in your
Fedora box? (May be the equivalent of the following?)

1) libflexdock-java
2) libjogl-java
3) libjrosetta-java
4) liblaf-plugin-java
5) libjgoodies-looks-java
6) libjrosetta-java

The package names may be different since I refer it from my Debian box.

How have your users misused?

Who is "ourself"?  Whose password have you changed ?  The root users or 
the users you are complaining about?

A little more clarity on what is your requirement will help us 
understand how you want to restrict their usage.

I was able to extract the 32-binary tarball, go to bin and run scilab
out of the box in Fedora 11. Since it seems to bundle all it
dependencies in the third party folder, it appears self contained. Are
you by any chance using a 64-bit box?

There is a bunch of work at

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/SciTech/Scilab

Doesn't seem to be progressing much and I tried to build it from source
but there seems to be a maze of dependencies.

none of them are there. and yum cannot find them anyway. But as Rahul has 
mentioned, the precompiled binary has everything built in so external 
libraries are not necessary. Can you confirm that you can run the pre-compiled 
binary in debian?

Hi all,

Has anybody used wireless broadband services in India? I was looking to subscribe to one but not sure which one to buy. Google hasn't really helped.

I (and many people I know) have had very bad experiences with Tata Indicom in general (telecom as well as internet/broadband, billing etc) and am not too keen on Tata.

I am looking at Reliance. Does Airtel have any? Are there other good services available?

I primarily use Ubuntu and do not travel much to rural areas. This will be more like an emergency backup during power outages and for use during in-frequent trips outside Hyderabad.

Thanks,
kc

I have been using Reliance for at least couple of years not and I have
not faced much problem. The speed is something similar to what we use to
get in dialup(varies from area to area). However I heard from one of my
friend that the new 1Mbps wireless from reliance gives 512Kbps
constantly. Hope this helps.

The best option is bsnl although airtel is also a good option but i am
not sure whether they give wireless broadband connectivity directly to
the customer as in delhi if you want their connection you have to take
it through the local cto which is connected to the airtel wireless
broadband.

I just want to ask a question 3G network is only with bsnl and mtnl
how reliance can give a speed of 512 kb/s as in 2g speed doesn't cross
15-16 kb/s ?

Message-ID: <911800.1420.qm@web33108.mail.mud.yahoo.com>


Hi all,

1. Is there a good web conferencing tool for conferencing between Linux and Windows? Our clients use gotomeeting or gomeetnow. Both of these force us to use Windows (XP) on our laptops. 

Is there any way that we can use Ubuntu (our default desktop OS) for web conferencing?
I heard about Dimdim but only the server seems to be runnng on Linux. Looks like it has a 'windows only' client.

2. We are currently using empathy as a gtalk VOIP client on Ubuntu. The voice quality is not great. Our clients complain about it and we are forced to use Windows for gtalk. Is that a problem with our config or is there a better client around?

Thanks,

AFAIK, ekiga is compatible with Netmeeting. There are a number of
other tools with ohphone being the most basic with the least library
dependencies.

In any case, ekiga to ekiga works fine and it has ports to Windows
and MacOSX as well.

Why is a static site considered a good idea in this time and age? If your
concern is that a CMS-managed site can be hacked while a static site can't
be - well, yes, it is more difficult to attack a pure static site.
However, please do bear in mind that a subversion server can be
compromised. After all haven't we have had the situation in multiple open
source projects where the code repository has been compromised?

I think there is a tremendous benefit to using a CMS-managed site - the
website has to be secured, of course. But are we saying that we have no
one in this list who is capable of securing a simple dynamic site?

If your problem is that there is no staging facility and that all the
changes are being done directly to the production site, then there are
other ways of solving the problem - one would be to use software which
allows for separate staging and production environments.

Coming to the subject of backups - we can setup a cron job to
automatically backup the db and the content directories on a daily and
weekly basis. Thousands of websites are doing this already.

I think the benefits of using a dynamic CMS environment far outweigh the
benefits of using a static html website.

Thank you,
Prem Kurian Philip

Though you make these two assertions, your e-mail contains no mention
of the benefits of a dynamic web site. Instead your e-mail contains
examples of by-passing known difficulties with dynamic web sites.

As we are working on updating our web services at IMSc as well, I
would really like to know the benefits of dynamic web sites for a site
that is very infrequently edited by humans (some pages may be generated
by cron jobs).

Kapil.

Do I really need to list these benefits - even with the 100s of 1000s of
websites out there - sites such as wikipedia, sourceforge, linux.com,
linuxtoday.com etc all running off CMSs? Isn't Google Code itself a
dynamic site?

In anycase, I will take the bite. Here are list some of the benefits:
Ability to include additional interactive components - example: conference
slide shows, conference / event listings and calendar, community generated
documentation, subject specific forums (besides the mailing lists),
conference registration modules, podcasts registrations, single
sign-on....

Having a dynamic CMS website does not in anyway prevent you from having
portions of the website coming from other automated sources - cron jobs
etc.

To state what you will already know - there are some very capable CMSs out
there - from large "enterprise-class" ones such as Liferay, Plone etc to
the smaller ones such as Joomla. Some of these products content
versioning, separate staging and production environments, workflow for
managing content (including approvals) etc.

Are we saying that not one of these environments is suitable for our use?
I find that to be very bold and unsubstantiated claim.

Thanks,

I believe static pages in *our case* would be a good idea because we can get
around the problems of one person being the gatekeeper for all the
changes/updates that need to be done. Also, it's also a case of not
complicating things unless we really, really need it - It's not just
security I'm talking about - Drupal will need a database, and somebody has
to backup all that data separately. It has to be transferred off-server so
that a disk failure won't take out all the old data. Ergo, considerable
amount of admin time. As SK mentioned, it becomes a chore for any one person
when he has a day job.

Static pages are simple and get the job done - all the data is in the svn
repo. And everybody who has the latest checkout will have all the data of
the site. Any one of us can restore it. Also, there is also the issue of
flexibility - using simple html pages and bunch of css files is so much
easier than managing 'themes' and 'modules' and somesuch.

No repo/server can be completely secure, sure, but we're talking about
hosting the repo on Google Code or GitHub. I think they both have *good
enough* security not worry about that aspect.

Yes, those are definitely not suitable. Sure, we can all go all enterprisey
on this (trust me, I'm a J2EE refugee), but it would all result in one
thing: overkill. They might be wonderful for users who have no technical
knowledge, and need all those workflow, bpel and rules engines and what not
- but our needs are quite limited. Lets not build an ivory tower that we're
never gonna use (but I agree with versioning - and I think an scm like
svn/git/hg will do just fine).

Our basic requirements are quite limited, and well-defined. Why do we even
want to spend so much time discussing, setting up and implementing for who
knows how long, when we can have something up and running within the week?
We don't need fancypants stuff (to begin with). We just need a place that
gives straight-forward information, stays up, is easy to edit, and doesn't
attract spam bots by the truckloads. Since we were not able to provide for
such a simple requirement so far, I believe starting small and simple is a
good idea.

Dear All

We have developed a browser based biometric application in .net/windows

The web server interacts with the driver of the fingerprint reader device in

Now we are developing this application to work in Linux systems.
Could some one help on how to do the equivalent of activeX controls in

1. Do we get your source code under a F/OSS license?

2. Which fingerprint reader device? Are there drivers available for

I need to discuss this internally before i  agree for this.
We may agree for this later.
But we can readily agree to bear some costs for the support

What do you propose as the plan of action for tracking apache
vulnerabilities, OS vulnerabilities and so on? Are you saying that there
is going to be NO vulnerabilities in the system if you remove MySQL and
PHP (if you are using a LAMP stack and running a PHP-based opensource
CMS)?

If you aren't willing to get someone to at least look at the website
occasionally, then you shouldn't be getting into hosting anything - static
or not.

Also, what makes you think it is dramatically less time consuming to
maintain a static html website where you have to edit links manually,
archive content manually and so on?

Do you think it takes a lot less effort to track changes in subversion,
deciding what is moved over to the production site, managing branches,
managing merges, managing user rights to different parts of the website,
applying patches and then deciding on what content is moved *manually* to
archives and so on?

And at the end of the day you will have a website which does not even
support searches? If you think that is an advancement, I don't know what
else to say.

How is this a fault of the software?

What is preventing the maintainers from setting up basic moderation for
comments? Would that require huge effort?

I am sure the site will come out great. Please set some
deadlines before which things will be in place. It will serve
as a source of motivation.

I think we need some artwork too. Can't we start a temporary
wiki page for this discussion?

The point that was made, emphasized repeatedly was that we need a face

many a time by using it -- with downtimes, spam, maintenance et. al.

For dynamic user content, use whatever CMS that you want. Even if the
CMS fails, we still have the static pages (which few Maintainers can
maintain) as a public face!

Yes, only a few Maintainers have access to the server.

What exactly is the workflow you have in mind for how the static website
is going to be updated? Whether you use an SCM or not you are going to
have a person who finally takes a call on a "release" to the production
server.

Consider the steps required for a SCM repository idea to work:

Naturally, I am assuming that you are not providing commit privileges to
everyone.

Random user:

Step 1 - Random user installs subversion on his desktop and then proceeds
to checkout the html files and the other content files from the
repository. This includes checking out the *entire* content from the
branch.
Step 2 - Random user sets up the files on his local machine. This involves
downloading and installing a version of Apache.
Step 3 - Random user makes changes in the html files. Adds files, removes
files etc. Changes stylesheets (common across all files)
Step 4 - Sends a patch to the webmaster? Carefully sends the list of new
files he has added so that he does not break anything.

(NOTE: I know we are speaking of techies here, but really - how many of
even these techies will know how to send patches properly and will be
diligent enough to include any additional files and so on?)

Webmaster:

Step 5 - Webmaster receives the patch and determine if the patch can be
applied to the code.
Step 6 - He will need to actually apply the patch to determine if it is
breaking anything. Since stylesheets may have changed, he will need to
review a lot of files.
Step 7 - He will need to make changes if the patch breaks anything
Step 8 - If there are multiple patches, do steps 5 to 7 and also consider
the case when one patch causes problem with another patch
Step 9 - Applies the patch to a branch.
Step 10 - Asks someone else (review board) to download the version and
review it and decide if the version can go online.
Step 11 - Wait around and repeat steps 8 and 9 if there are multiple
people on the board.
Step 12 - Apply the patches / changes sent in by the people on the review
board.
Step 13 - Merge all the changes to the head (optional)
Step 14 - Export the changes to the production server. This may involve
deleting the files from the production server. You could do a checkout if
you prefer having .svn files all over the webserver directory.

Consider the steps given above. One poor soul will be entrusted with the
task of doing this - there is a lot of possibility of error.

What exactly is so difficult about these "themes" and "modules"? There are
kids who are setting up their own websites using these CMSs - a theme is
mostly html with some additional markup and some css.

Have you tried putting in a large binary file into subversion? consider
something like 20 video files of 50 mb each. Try checking them out of
subversion. Just consider that the users who want to modify html files and
send it to the webmaster will need to checkout these files on their
desktops over a pathetic 1mbps DSL connection.

Consider the workflow for a CMS driven site:

Step 1. Web master obtains requests for changes over email or over ilugc.
Another approach would be to allow a moderated comment system against on
each page and the users can submit their comments directly.
Step 2. Web master logs in from anywhere in the world (does not need
access to subversion etc)
Step 3. Web master makes the change in the content, uploads files etc. On
some CMSs, this will generate a new version of the content. The older
version will remain published.
Step 4. If the software supports a workflow, those responsible for
reviewing the changes will be automatically notified over email.
Step 5. Reviewers place their comments or add/remove changes
Step 6. Web master incorporates the changes.
Step 7. Web master publishes the changes.

The CMS will itself handle auto-archiving and auto-expiry of content (if
setup appropriately) without the web master doing any additional work. It
won't require the users to know anything about subversion, apache etc.
They won't need to download and install these on their computers - they
won't need to download the entire repository which will become quite big
over time. The same applies for reviewers.

It may also be possible to set up the system such that each section in the
site is administered by a different person so that the web master does not
need to worry about maintaining each section.

Backups will be simple as well. Do a database export. Also zip up the
content directories. Transfer these across over ftp/sftp to a remote
location. These could be automated using a cron job.

In any case, this is just my opinion on the subject. The people who are
actually going to be managing the site should take the call - and if they
are happier managing using an SCM, so be it.

Prem

discussion is being deviated from the subject. Its not the discussion about
static or dynamic website.

I propose few things here

1. Static Home page with the following content
a. link to mailing list
b. tells who we are.
c. where will be the next meeting held

2. cms / wiki for user generated content by ilugc members. we need active
community not just in mailing list as we are reaching out big audience here.

if you look at foss.in, they have done it in wordpress and i appreciate
their community and the way they have organized the information for anyone
who wants it. the purpose of CMS / wiki is for the members of ilugc who can
contribute without having big access to svn or some thing. because they are
all normal end users. if you have static html page, would a normal end user
can contribute to it? for e.g. we get repetitve mails list with subject "i
cannot connect to internet via airtel in linux". these kind of articles
written by people can be put in CMS / WIKI.

also, if you look at ilugc.in, just leave the UI part. tell me what is
missing there?  we have every link with appropriate information what Raman.P
asked for. Remember i had this even with chennailug.org. since the domain is
out of my control, i cannot do much when it expired.

in terms of ilugc.in, i am willing to keep it and i will take care of the
renewals every year. i will ensure for its continuity. the content of the
website which was static few years ago with no updated content. because even
the static html site maintainer wasnt that active during that time.

if you look out here, http://ilugc.in/taxonomy/term/9 different meetings /
conferences / events that happened were all added / edited by the members of
the site. with the static html page, will these be possible? if it is, then
i would agree with going with static website.

3. also there are few things which ilugc website should reflect. we do not
know much about our members. who does what. who are all experts? who are all
end users? a newbie joining the site / mailing list can directly interact
with other members knowing much more about this via the website. this will
be more interactive with cms / wiki.

if spam / db down is a big issue, havent they are unsolvable? if there are
not enough people for maintinging the dynamic site, how can there be people
for maintaining the static pages? are we addressing the problem in right
direction?

apart form me working on ilugc website, i have not seen many interested in
doing it for free. if you guys are interested in really making the things
go, lets fix the issues that we are facing. remember, we are having the site
for non-tech users also.

Anybody who *asks*. By default it's read-only.

It's no difficult than contributing to any open source project. I'm
assuming a lot of people are already quite familiar with the steps
mentioned. If the students are unfamiliar, it will be a good starting
point for them to start contributing. We'll explain the process in
clear steps on the site.

It's not as difficult as it sounds - at the end of the day, installing
a local version of apache is not hard, and they only need to have a
browser to check the changed html files. Even if something breaks, I'm
sure somebody will notice it and commit a new patch pronto.

Perhaps initially. But I expect this to get much faster once everybody
gets a hang of it. I repeat, these steps are not something most of us
are unfamiliar with. I expect people who are going to sign up as
project moderators will know what they're getting into.

They need to be upgraded whenever a new vulnerability is found. It
means that whoever has admin access to the server has to be available
immediately. And php apps are notoriously bug-prone, there is a new
bugfix release every week or so. Who wants to go through this
rigmarole every week? (fwiw, I have a wordpress install, and I hate
upgrading it every month)

There will be *no* binary files on the site. The videos go to YouTube
or other video sites, so we'll only embed them. Except for logos and
other small icon files, I expect things like photo albums etc should
be stored in services like Picasa or Flickr.


>
> Consider the workflow for a CMS driven site:

I understand and agree with your steps involved in maintaining a
CMS-driven one. The biggest problem with the CMS approach is, *it did
not work so far*. All this could have been done already, but nobody
bothered. Which is why we're requesting a change in the ways of doing
this. We need not depend on the commitment of one person. There can be
hundreds of people pushing edits, whoever is motivated, and at least
one of the 5-10 people who have deploy access can be available to push
the change. The guy who has access to the server needs to be available
only if something really bad happens.

Finally, I'm not saying this will be perfect - but it's a good deal
better than what we have so far, and it never hurts to try something
different. If it's all that cumbersome to do so, I expect people will
pipe up, and we'll make necessary changes along the way.

Vamsee.

I generally agree with this except that my principle (as someone puts

So using proprietary systems can compete only because of the other

 Reverse engineering is fun

However, the latter is sometimes declared to be illegal fun --- which

just had a thought - maybe it needed to be run outside X. So I tried - looks 
like it needs X. It didn't run, but it did not segfault either. Or maybe it 
will run under gnome - I have kde. Was your success under gnome?

segfault in gnome too. btw, got some sound from firefox under gnome - not much. 
A little plays and then it stops.

We need to decide that first. All the rest of the features that people
requested can be added as subdomains/vhosts to the server. Our No.1
priority, even more than the planet, video uploads, etc., is a site
that works and is easy to edit and maintain.

I'm not fundamentally against the cms/wiki. I'm just saying we'll use
it if it's decided that the simplest approach won't work - after
setting up the static site, if it's agreed upon that it's not serving
our needs fully, by all means you can install a
Drupal/Mediawiki/whatever and encourage people to use it. All I'm
asking is why take the trouble of managing a CMS when most of us are
smart enough to push marked-up content?

I don't think foss.in is open for anybody to edit. Afaik, it's only
open to the dozen or so people they trust. And we don't have to follow
their model.

Really? Do you actually think the majority audience of this list are
'normal end users'? I suspect anybody who can answer that question can
also edit html and commit to svn.

Correct me if I'm wrong, ilugc.in is "not found" currently on my FF
and chennailug.org is overflowing with spam. I don't expect you to do
anything about chennailug.org - at least you could've informed us that
we have to do something about it before somebody else noticed it and
raised the issue. I don't blame you at all for this, I'm just pointing
out the drawbacks of only one person taking care of the site when we
all have other things to worry about.

Which is why we are going for the multiple maintainers approach.
Either the CMS or the static pages thing won't work as long as only
one person has control. So far you haven't even confirmed if you treat
it as your own domain or willing to donate it. Can the community
assume that it's a commonly-owned domain? I can assure that it is the
case with all the domains I registered. I'm guessing the same for KG.
I'm willing to transfer them to anybody who's nominated as the person
to administer them.

The site seems to be down now, but I assume it's like a wiki. Of
course static pages will be editable. All the changes are available in
the svn history. I don't see a problem with this.

We'll just have to ask on the list. Once the site gets going, this is
a minor issue.

The difference is, you don't need a lot of people 'maintaining' the
static site. At least, we know all the pages are pure html and css,
and there isn't much the spambots can do unless there is a 'form' in
the page. If there are only 5 people maintaining the site, then that
is fine too. At least, the site will stay up as long as Apache itself
is not compromised or some of the additional software we are using is
compromised. Then one of us will notice that the version we are using
is compromised and will let the site admin(s) know about this. This
kind of maintenance is going to be far less frequent than using
something like wordpress or drupal.

The whole idea of creating more stakeholders is that there will be
more eyeballs and it will get fixed faster when things go wrong.
Please understand, that I didn't say things won't go wrong. At least,
the glitch will not be there for long when there are at least a dozen
people who could fix/deploy it.

You have never offered this before. Nobody is saying you cannot be
involved in maintaining the site. We're just trying to make it more
democratic. If you have problems with that, you should let us know.
Sure, we might have the site up for non-tech users too, but I don't
expect them to contribute much to *how it is being
created/maintained/updated*. If they have questions, they'll ask on
the list. If it's asked quite often, somebody who's observant will
move it to the FAQ. Or ask one of the people who has html/svn skills
to do so. I assume both of them are very basic skills for this
audience.

Subject: [Ilugc] Problems where solved !!!
Message-ID: <0016364574ac5faf64046eba35f0@google.com>

Hi friends !

Few days back i had posted two problems which i faced in my PC

1. Unable to open software sources

I recently installed Ubuntu 9.04 in my PC
Whenever I try to open system->administration->software sources
or
open system->administration->printing
mouse cursor will spin for 2 to 5 seconds after that nothing happens just
disappear from the taskbar.
any ideas?

2. USB Startup Disk Creator in Ubuntu 9.04

I had installed USB Startup Disk Creator in Ubuntu 9.04 but it gives an
error while execution
'Could not launch 'USB Startup Disk Creator'
Failed to execute child process "usb-creator" (No such file or directory)
can any one help me in this regards.

Both the problems where caused by a broken symlink.

The problem solved by doing this

cd /usr/bin
sudo rm python
sudo cp python26 python2.6
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.6 /usr/bin/python

after that everything started working fine. All the above problems where  
solved.

just tried the above step and I don't know weather whatever i did is right  
or wrong.

Does this cause me any other problem.

can any one help me in this regards.

thanks,

verman

* symlink is a special type of file that contains a reference to another  
file or directory in the form of an absolute or relative path and that  
affects pathname resolution.

Friends.

I have a network issue with kubuntu 9.04

My laptop is IBM Thinkpad T41
lspci says Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82540EP Gigabit
Ethernet Controller (Mobile) (rev 03)

My laptop is getting disconnected from the network often.

sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart does nothing.

sudo dhclient eth0 is keep in requesting for an IP.

reboot is the only way to connect with network.
That too lasts for some 2 - 3 hours.

What will be the reason for this?

How to make the network connection persistent?

Thanks.

	upgrade from fc10
Message-ID: <427467.37594.qm@web55106.mail.re4.yahoo.com>

Hai,

I was working with FC10. Whenever I reboot, automatic updates are performed. Recently an option to upgrade FC10 to FC11 appeared automatically (similar to the second screen shot given at http://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-upg...top-and-server ). Because this appeared automatically I didnt get a chance to perform the command line statements that were given at the same site (especially, yum clean all, I dont know if that is the problem). Except for these commands everything followed similar to the way explained in the web page http://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-upg...top-and-server . 

During reboot the upgrade was performed. However, I am not able to successfully get into the FC11 desktop. When booted with FC11 (I also have windows xp), the system enters to a blank screen. Did some search in the internet, however I was not able to get to the thread that addresses this problem. Some of the suggestions given were to append 3 or 1 in the kernal parameter, however this was not helping, again the system enters to a blank screen and whatever I write using the keyboard appears on the screen. I am sure that this blank screen is not a shell.

I request the members to kindly give their suggestions and help me overcome this problem.

C. Balaji

Possible problems
dhcp lease time is very short - or some thing
network-manager is a trouble in many circumstances - try disabling

Srini,

When network disconnected, check the following

1. mii-tool / ethtool - Check the status
2. ifconfig - Check Rx counts are increasing
3. try to give an static ip and ping

Message-ID: <1247684637.8720.4.camel@mjolnir>

Hi,

Does anyone know if it is possible to get hardware-accelerated h.264
decoding in Linux with Nvidia hardware? I have a friend's 7200 GS and
before I buy a motherboard that will accept it, I'd like to know if it
is possible to use it under Linux to decode h.264. I know the hardware
is capable of it.

I would be happy if I could also receive some pointers on how to enable
it if it is possible. Google is very unhelpful, only throwing up 2 year
old forum threads.

Thank you for your time,

Do you get a blinking underscore at the top left of your screen or is it 
plain blank?

Can you boot to runlevel 1 (single user)?

While restarting network, try to follow syslog or demon.log in another
terminal, I think this may help to point out the issue.

$ tail -f /var/log/syslog (or)
$ tail -f /var/log/demon.log

Again, do you mean the h/w is CUDA enabled or something like that?

Your question isn't clear. Did he/she change the root password or some
other user's password? If so, was the user given root privilege? Do
you want to restrict user from changing his/her own password?

The easy way would be to move the passwd binary to a different location.

The proper solution would be write a script which invokes the passwd binary
after UID validation.
The passwd binary should be kept in different location.

Why not simply remove the suid bit on the passwd binary?  That way only root
can successfully execute the passwd command.

Wouldn't removing setuid root and removing execute permissions for
everyone but root automatically do this? Should be much easier, too.

> Can some experts suggest which one is better(Scheme or LISP), in terms of:

The following is my personal opinion after working with SBCL,
Gambit/Scheme, PLT/Scheme and Emacs Lisp.

I started off with Common Lisp and SBCL. With certain Emacs modes and
Slime, it's a pleasure to work with Common Lisp. It is, however, a
very difficult language and the Hyperspec can be very confusing. As
far as literature is concerned, I think PCL (Practical Common Lisp) is
overrated and OnLisp is a little too advanced. #lisp @irc.freenode.net
is a fantastic place to learn though.

Emacs Lisp is a slow and featureless language. After writing CL, Emacs
Lisp feels like C where every object is a LispObject* - integers have
limits, there are no closures or lexical bindings, and people often
use "global" variables. You will get no support or documentation for
this language whatsoever apart from the info pages distributed with
Emacs. People on #lisp will throw you out and people on #emacs won't
teach you how to write code. Because of its nature, it's easy to write
terrible code in Emacs Lisp. Therefore, I believe it is necessary to
first learn Common Lisp to be able to write good and elegant code in
this language. While people would generally discourage it, I've
written a huge Elisp application in CL-style. You can see it here:
http://github.com/artagnon/ublog.el

Finally Scheme. It's a minimalistic language whose complete draft
specification is the size of the index of CL's. It focuses on the
functional part of Common Lisp and has features like the famous
call/cc. However, due to its minimalistic nature, there more learning
resources than practical libraries for this language. The language is
very easy to implement too, so there are tons of implementations, each
with their own share of strengths and weaknesses- PLT/Scheme is a
probably a fantastic starting point. The distributed and recommended
editor is DrScheme- personally, it annoys me to no end that Scheme <->
Emacs isn't great. Gabmit/Scheme can compile Scheme directly to C and
is useful if you want to avoid using FFI (Foreign Function Interface).
The Wizard book (SICP: Structure and Implementation of Computer
Programs) is a great starting point for theoretical computer science
in Scheme. It's a good language to play around with continuations and
coroutines, but I'm a little skeptical about its practical
application.

p.s- You might want to look into Clojure too. It's a Lisp that
describes itself as CL without the historical baggage. It aims to
become a mainstream programming language.

Yep it is, if thats what the OP wants. Whereas if he wants to restrict only
certain users from changing their passwd, then validation on UID will be
helpful.

My experience with H264 decoding on Linux using hardware acceleration has
been pretty bad.

But I came across this and it sounds interesting. You have probably seen
this already:
http://blog.mymediasystem.net/avchd/nvidias-vdpau-driver-version-18016-hardware-acceleration-for-hd-content-h264-with-major-improvements/

There have been some attempts to get CoreAvc running under linux, but I am
not sure how successful the attempts were at getting hardware acceleration
going.

Prem

Yes, I would prefer if I could continue using Totem or mplayer. But I
don't mind installing another program if it will mean that h.264 videos

The hardware has PureVideo which, on Windows, will decode MPEG-2 and
h.264 on the GPU.

Hmmm, well, I was hoping I could view high-resolution video without it
taxing my CPU too much. When that happens, the video skips and the audio
is no longer synced. That's rather annoying.

Terribly poor communication - please try to improve else you may never get useful help. If not comfortable in English you may ask in Tamil also.

What I could decipher - You do not want the user to change the password.
It should remain what was set originally- am I right?

I do not know any  solution except setting time limit for password. Use -n option to set minimum time limit before changing passowrd. Set this limit to some high value.

Found this as well:
http://gxben.wordpress.com/2008/11/16/nvidia-brought-purevideo-to-mplayerlinux/

and this:
http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=nvidia_180_vdpau&num=1

But it looks like only Nvidia 8xxx series of cards are supported, but I
could be wrong.

Thank you. From here and elsewhere, I've found that Nvidia only supports
MPEG-2 hardware-accelerated decoding under XvMC for the GeForce 7200 GS.
Apparently, the newer VDPAU works only with the 8-series and higher.

That's good enough for me at the moment, though not ideal.

Thanks for the link, I only read about VDPAU today, but it seems like
the card I have is too old to be supported. CoreAVC is interesting
(thanks), but at $15, I might as well sell this old one and buy a
second-hand 8-series graphics card.

Don't need a net connection to do an upgrade via DVD

Dear Raman Sir,

     what I meant is:

       I want to cut the access to change the passwd. Can I restrict users
from accessing to change the passwd ?


      Windows Server has option that we can create that an user cannot have
an access to change the passwd.

Install the gnupg package and read the howto that comes with it.

In short gnupg is a program to manage signing and encryption. All the
actions given below can be handled by gnupg. The protocols used are
part of an open standard.

Key management:
 1. You create a signing and an encryption key; each key has two parts
    one private, one public.
 2. You upload the public portions to a key server and put it in
    other public places (like your visiting card!).
 3. You get people who know you well to sign (validate) your key with
    their key.
 4. You keep your private key very, very, private.

Use:
 1. You can sign documents, programs, e-mails etc. that you send out
    using your signing key. People who have access to your public key
    can verify such signatures.
 2. People can encrypt documents which they want to send to you in
    private and only you (or other intended recipients) can decrypt them.
 3. You can also encrypt documents for your own safe keeping.
 4. You can sign other people's keys after verifying their authenticity.
 5. If you have other people's public encryption key, you can encrypt
    documents which you want to send to them in private.

Regards,

Kapil.

Is the below a public key or a signature. I have used openssl and the keys
it generates indicate that the file is a public key. And moreover, the key I
created using openssl could encrypt very small documents. Can pgp keys do
more than that.

Actually, you cannot achieve true geek-dom without a GPG/PGP key!

Most large projects like the kernel, apache, X and the larger
distributions _need_ digital signatures on significant contributions
(i.e. anyting other than easily verified small patches).

There is no difference in the mathematics behind openssl keys and
pgp/gpg keys. However, the key management techniques are different.

The former depends on a chain of trust starting with a root
certifying authority. The latter depdns on a web of trust which
depends on (friend-of-a-friend)^n.

The newer (gnupg2) version of gnupg can handle SSL-based and PGP-based
protocols.

Options:
a. As already suggested change permission to /usr/bin/passwd so that
   required groups alone execute. However, I am not sure what will happen if the user uses gui tools.

b. In my opinion easiest to set time limit to change password by
   the user to some large limit say 2 years so that password remains
   in tact.

  However, the whole idea is against basic security measures. What will happen if the password is known to some unauthorised third person?

this??
do you have an upgrade of this article?


The specifics i am looking are for multipathing across 2 disk arrays  and a

Not really. The article is really about simple playing around with
combining block devices using the command "dmsetup".

I don't know Powerpath/DMP. In particular, I don't really know what
"multipath" means --- perhaps you can enlighten us! :-)

Note that "dmsetup" is a low-level utility. To do anything even
slightly complex with this it is best to use some tools which will
automate things and prevent lock-ups. Depending on your needs the
tools could be shell scripts, multipath-tools, lvm2 or evms.

Kapil.

Multi-path is handled using 2 components: MPIO support from OS, and device (or
SAN controller) specific driver (aka DSM).

Linux requires the device mapper tools to handle multipathing inside the
kernel.  This is provided by the device mapper kernel modules.

The DSM is responsible for health checking of the IO path, you require the
appropriate DSMs for each SAN backend (eg EMC, HDS, etc).  DSM for several
storage vendors is already available in /sbin/mpath*.  The FOSS DSMs
provide round-robin, health checking, and group priority.  Vendor provided
DSMs (eg Powerpath) provide additional features, but don't enjoy community
backing.  I've used vendor provided DSMs (Powerpath, HDLM,etc) on Windows
only, and the FOSS/native drivers on Linux/Solaris.

Using the DSMs, a user space multipathd daemon periodically health checks the
LUNs and activates/removes the paths as necessary.

Here is the sample multipath output from one of my boxes:

[root@treble sbin]# ./multipath -l
prod03 (360060e801082e30004d4247000000003) dm-0 HITACHI,DF600F
[size=2.0T][features=0][hwhandler=0][rw]
\_ round-robin 0 [prio=0][active]
 \_ 2:0:0:3 sdh 8:112 [active][undef]
\_ round-robin 0 [prio=0][enabled]
 \_ 4:0:0:3 sdg 8:96  [active][undef]

This server is running FOSS HDS dsm and shows first path as
"active" and second path as "enabled".

I'm not sure if it's advisable to multipath across two different SAN arrays.
At least I've never deployed anything in production like this!  Multipath
is typically done to a single SAN system with multiple controllers/fabrics/HBAs.

Dear Raman Sir,

     what I meant is:

       I want to cut the access to change the passwd. Can I restrict users
from accessing to change the passwd ?


      Windows Server has option that we can create that an user cannot have
an access to change the passwd.

Rajesh

Hi to all,

my Hod is opposing to do fifth sem 10 mini projects in RoR( Other than VB &
ORACLE ).

I told him , NRC - FOSS are ready to give letter regarding to do proj in
open source.

But he said like, '" even though will u (Arulalan) get permission letter
from Anna University , I (Hod) won't allow you to do 5th sem university
practical examination ".

He clearly said, he won't allow to do  proj in other language ,  in this
semester.

And he said, " For record and observation purpose we have to do proj in VB
and Oracle itself " .

 "In final semester (6th) project, u can do proj in any platform ,

no one can restrict you in 6 th sem " , like wise he suggested  me .


the problem is , in anna university syllabus specified language name is VB
and Oracle.

even though the syllabus says use  Any Front tool and etc .

so anna univ syllabus need to change the syllabus pattern.

they have to specify clearly in syllabus like , " students can use any
languages and in same class students can do proj in different different
platform " . so external also can not oppose that .

Or else FOSS Subject will  become one of the compulsory subjects !

Message-ID: <6a7659850907171030h699be492uef1a57b0374be317@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all ,

Html <span> tag does not works in FireFox , but it works very well in
Internet Explorer .

the below coding is one of my xml lab program called as   "  Embedding XML
with HTML " .

this is the code for xml and html .

*sample.xml*                                            ( save it as
sample.xml)

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<studentdetails>
<student>
<name>arulalan</name>
<class>mca</class>
</student>
<student>
<name>nandha</name>
<class>mba</class>
</student>
</studentdetails>



*sample1.html*                                         ( save it as
sample1.html and put together in same folder which contains  xml file)

<html>
<body>
<xml id="student" src="sample.xml"></xml>
<table Datasrc="#student" border="2">
<tr>
<td><span datafld="name"></span></td>
<td><span datafld="class"></span></td>
</tr>
</table>
</body>
</html>



while opening sample1.html by browser , it has to show one Table which
contains   4 data from sample.xml .

arulalan      mca

nandha       mba


the above data is packed inside the table .

This table is not display in Fire Fox 3.5 and older version also.

I mean , html < span > tag doesn't works properly.


for this purpose alone, i have to switch over windows in lab instead of
using ubuntu .

so , is there any solution having to solve this problem . ?

Hi
Im Rajeswari.S. Im a python beginner.
i have Python 2.6.2 version. I need to connect MySQL database with python
scripts. First i checked whether MySQLdb is already installed by issuing the
following command from a python shell as
>>> import mysql
i got the reply from the shell as
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named mysql

Then to get instructions on how to install MySQL db i visited the following
site
http://blog.spikesource.com/mysqldb.htm

I followed the following instructions given in the above site

   1.

   Download a recent version from the project
homepage<http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python>
   .

          From the first instruction i downloaded MySQL for python inside
view all files option
          MySQL-python-1.2.3c1.tar.gz.<http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/files/mysql-python-test/MySQL-python-1.2.3c1.tar.gz/download>
          Extracted the files

     2. Performed the following from a shell (unix) :
              $ cd MySQL-python-1.2.3c1
              $ python setup.py build

          i got the following error

# yum install @tamil-support

That would install all the packages in the group needed for language
support. Restart the session and you should be able to use it.

Could you please tell us what distribution you are using? It may be
easier to install MySQLdb using an RPM or deb, as applicable, which
would make it much easier for you.

You would need to install the Python setuptools. But, again, you
should let us know what distribution you are using, so that we can

Using mysqldb from python code could be like (you can find many examples
online like this):

(case-sensitive)
>>> import MySQLdb
>>> conn = MySQLdb.connect('localhost', 'root', 'password', 'database_name')
>>> cur = conn.cursor()
>>> cur.execute("your sql queries")

For installing MySQLdb,

 if you are using debian/ubuntu-based system :
       sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb

 if you are using redhat/fedora-based system:
       sudo yum install MySQL-python

 if any other distributions,
    (i) First download the setuptools python package, install it
    (ii) Then repeat the procedure you have followed

Note:
  python-mailing list would be a better place to post your python-queries :

Hi Everyone

I have received the Fedora 11 Media set from Redhat. Thanks to Rahul for
this massive effort. I would like to distribute the Fedora 11 media to the
people who have requested them from chennai.

As already suggested i am planning to hold the Fedora release fest probably
sometime during the month of August. I would send the dates and an email
regarding the fest to the group in a couple of days. I could hand over the
media to people who have requested them on that day. If people need it
before that they could get in touch with me.

The following are the list of people from chennai.

Names                       No of DVDs
1. SivaPrakash               10
2. UmaMagesh               10

The above people kindly let me know your email addresses.

Thanks,
Cheers,
Balaji

I need some help in configuring certificates and https

Here is the scenario:

1. Application is Liferay (running in tomcat without Apache) which also has Web Services.
2. There are clients (.NET, ruby..) which access these services after logging is as a special user.
3. Currently both authentication and data transfer between Liferay and clients is also on https (for the web services part).
4. I want to configure so that clients authenticate using https but the data transfer is over http. I read somewhere that https is approc 30% overhead compared to http.

a. Can we do this with just tomcat? What configurations should I make in tomcat and/or apache? Can we do this without Apache in the picture?
b. What changes do we need to make in the clients?

I am a new to Apache configs and will appreciate any help.

I think your problem is not clearly stated, so I am guessing a bit.

Your user is in a network where access to the internet is tightly
controlled as follows. The user can only connect to a specific web
proxy server within this network; this web proxy then provides the
connection for the user.

Your network has access to some web resources which you want to
provide for this user.

One way to do this is to create a reverse proxy (like apache's
reverse proxy) to front for the actual web servers. You may also need
some mod_rewrite stuff to re-map the urls inside the web pages
served. (You should probably also require authentication on the
reverse proxy or you will have an open proxy!)

One disadvantage of this method is that the user does not get the
actual URLs of the pages served and so bookmarks may be garbled.

A different approach is to setup a VPN server (openvpn can listen on
any specified port like port 80 or port 443). Each user then activates
the VPN. You provide access to your resources on the VPN.

Regards,

Kapil.

Hi,

I got a mail from a student in SRM asking for help regarding an event
in his college tech fest:

"Hello Sir,
I am a student of SRM University, Chennai. We are having Our College
Annual Tech Event in September 2009. I am organising a event "Think
Linux" A Linux Workshop!! At present no much attention is given to
Open Source In our college!! As you are Campus Ambassador Of Fedora
Could you please provide some support for this event!! To make this
event a Success We would be in need of supporters like you!! so that
we could use fedora logo in posters, Banners and
certificate for participation!! The event details i am mailing with
this email as attachment!! hope you would consider my request
positively!!"

I've asked a day or two to reply back. I've also told him to post the
event on our events wiki, or I'll do it. A main thing is that they
have to confirm the event first. I replied him back thus:

"Hi Deppak,
I'm sure I'll be able to help you. You register your name on
fedoraproject.org, and add your event there. I'll talk with my fellow
Ambassadors and help you out. Fedora logo can be used, yes. But take
care not to distort it, colors or shape. If you post your event on the
events wiki at fedoraproject.org you can get help from people around
the world. You can also sign up to become a Fedora Campus Ambassador."

Can anyone else guide me, this is the first time that I've had such a
request, and I want to fulfill it.

What kind of WS authentication are you using in this scenario? Is it
Basic HTTP authentication or  SOAP authentication ?


> 3. Currently both authentication and data transfer between Liferay and clients is also on https (for the web services part).
> 4. I want to configure so that clients authenticate using https but the data transfer is over http.

For webservices, using Basic HTTP authentication, there is only one
request that goes between the client and the server. It cannot be
split into two requests.


Client: Hi I am "Client" with password as "password" can you please
give me the response for this soap request message?
<SOAP:Envelope>
....request....
</SOAP:Envelope>


Server: OK. Valid user. here is the response
<SOAP:Envelope>
.... response.....
</SOAP:Envelope>

As you can see, there is only one request going between the client and
server. You cannot split the Webservice request into two request, one
in HTTPS and the other in HTTP.

Also, HTTP sessions are generally not maintained across webservices
(not recommended). You loose the basic purpose of a webservice in this
case. You also looseout on the basics of security in a webservice.

> I read somewhere that https is approc 30% overhead compared to http.

How does it matter?
The 30% overhead mentioned is just at the protocol level. The actual
time taken by the webservice is because of your code.

 Make sure that
1. Your service is atomic (following the rules of a "service")
2. Is your code, particularly the DB hits properly fine tuned?
3. Have you avoided unnecessary object creation, loops, etc?
4. Check your code using PMD, Checkstyle, FindBugs, etc... and FIX all

By the way, what is the peak traffic that you are expecting? will that
30% network overhead be an issue?
AFAIK, this 30% HTTPS overhead might become an issue, if you are
transacting data more than a couple of hundred MB over a SINGLE
service request. And if that is the case, your service architecture
needs to be revamped and re-written.


> a. Can we do this with just tomcat? What configurations should I make in tomcat and/or apache? Can we do this without Apache in the picture?
> b. What changes do we need to make in the clients?

See above.
1. No Point doing this.
2. Make sure that your service is cleanly defined and the code is
properly written

I recommend you to do that sem project for the sack of doing. Plz
don't put pressure for the FOSS project. It may leads to some ego

+1,

If we know the value of  FOSS well and good, we try hard to make others
realize it,  but it's not must for the rest of the world to follow our foot
steps. Till they realize the value and accept by themselves, we need to try
hard  till the day comes.

Anna University / NRC FOSS should conduct a FOSS awareness program to all
faculty members of all colleges. If the faculty have some basic awareness
of FOSS then our job would be much easier to mold them as we like.

+1 People in the Head of the department mostly not affable and would
try to show their fist on student. If the curriculum state that it is
a subject related to just Visual Basic that is something which need to
be addressed. Can NRCFOSS take steps update it? A paper about building
GUI application makes more sense to me rather than confining to just
Visual Basic. My advice to student is don't try argue any more to the
HOD you might probably end up reappearing for the subject. If your
interest/passion drives you no one can stop you building the
application in whatever framework/language you wanted but take that as
your free time work.

Exactly! I simply don't understand why you are forcing yourself to do
stuff in Ruby. You can very well do the same stuff in Ruby in the
evenings or when you have free time and also do it in VB and Oracle
for the college's sake. See the positive side of it, you learn three
things and also not get into any troubles at college. Please don't
develop a "untouchable" feeling towards VB/Oracle and other
proprietary stuff. Sometimes knowing these , would help you better
rate , understand free software and shall also add to your knowledge
kitty.

It doesn't matter what you do? its all matters How you do? for example let
us assume in mere future ROR or any other technology could be replaced by
some thing else. So what we do? we upgrade our self to the next level to
sustain  in the job market [1].

I personally feel technology/tool/language  is not important on the other
hand learn the art of programming [2] you can sustain for ever.

And also I have personal request don't reveal the college or organization
name in the public list until unless their is no other go.

Enjoy programming, take care.


[1]  survival of the  fittest
[2] programming concepts or programming logic is very vital vitamins,
languages could keep changing but but not the programming concepts.

Hi to all ,


first of all thanks to all of You .

i accept your advice with pleasure.

i started to do proj in Vb and Oracle itself in lab.

i already planned this, even though i mailed to chennai mailing list,

because all of u have to know , these are all things are going in many
colleges.

thats all.

And the main problem with Hod is, he is Master in Maths ( ph.d).

He doesn't know, how to run "Hello world in C" prog also.

Sorry to say this.

But i have to tell.

anna univ problem only makes this problem.

for eg: for mechanical department hod must studied mechanical and also he
must be master in that field.

same like that , Physics, chemistry , etc.

They can not appoint as Hod those who studied and master in chemistry into
physics department.

we know why?

but the exception case is happening only to computer science department
only.

some body will inform this problem to anna university.

then only our juniors can do proj creatively , in future.

hopefully , it will happen soon.

 * and finally sorry to used my college name in public. *  . . .

Thanks for all of your supports .

thanks to one and all.

Dude that's a sad story but I think it's a internal issue of a college
/ university . The National Board of Accredition ( NBA ) and All India
Council of Techhttp://www.nba-aicte.ernet.in/contact.htmlnical
Education should be looking into this issue .
If you want things to happen please mail the people at
http://www.nba-aicte.ernet.in/contact.html and
http://www.aicte.ernet.in/Staff_List.htm

My personal word of caution : for a better impact . Do this mailing
*after* you graduate and you get the certificates ;)  else the college
may take revenge on you :(

Mailing this to Chennai Linux Users group wont help much because
people in the list  as far as I know are not in a postion to take
action on HOD's :D

But proceed carefully and dont get into mess . All the best with VB
and Oracle Project . Look at the brighter side you will learn how M$
implements GUI programming , why windows apps crash :P , why oracle is
bulky .. etc LOL

This _is_ a problem.

I know experts in mechanical engineering who came from Ph.D.'s in
different subjects like Physics.

The main problem is not what people's background is but what their
interests are. Often people become jaded with time and lose interest.
At this point some "convention" or "policy" which was written years
ago seems more important to them than teaching or studying or
following one's interests.

One of the strongest proponents of proprietary software that I know is
considered by some to be the grand-daddy of computer science in the
country.

Kapil.

With maths background I never felt any problem with programming especially logic - but I could see lot of BE/B.Techs suffering in this respect. I feel it is ultimately individual's interest as pointed out by Kapil.

Moreover until late 80's Computer programming was associated with maths, statistics department in general.

This is not problem.The problem is you don't know the relation between
Maths and Computer Science.  Say for example

Ritchie is best known as the creator of the C programming language and
a key developer of the Unix operating system. He graduated from
Harvard with degrees in physics and applied mathematics. In 1967, he
began working at the Bell Labs' Computing Sciences Research Centre.

I think  you are thinking that people other than computer science they
don't have capability to to teach computer engineer,You are assuming
yourself like that . Please don't think subject point of view .

The point here is not that others follow the philosophy or not, the
reach of the technology to the students. It has been nicely said in
tamil
'Asan oru nulai kattrukoduka Pathu noolgal payilavendum' means
To Teach one book a tutor has to learn ten books.
What is expected here is professors and/or lecturers should learn all
the available technology and then teach the students.
But it is lacking here(in our education system).

Computer science is highly related to Maths ,Physics and some other
subject. Computer Science is little bit easy to learn people from the
maths and physics background .Individual's interest is matter.

So what, as along as you share your work its a Free Software isn't it? I
don't think there is something that stops you from releasing what you
are going to do in VB.

To my knowledge, end of the project, Colleges around are satisfied with
the screen shots from the project, that Students say they have done at
so and so place. Isn't it?

Looks like Dspace has made some edit in apache config files especially
those related to hosts which doesn't allow other folders to be seen .
Have a look at them and also pastebin some here so that someone could
help solve the issue if you are unable to solve it .

[quote]
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates believes that if he had been able to
watch physicist Richard Feynman lecture on physics in 1964 his life
might have played out differently.

Mr. Gates, of course, is legendary as a Harvard University dropout who
went on to create the world?s most successful software firm. He has
told associates that if had watched the lectures earlier in his life
he might have become a physicist instead of a software entrepreneur.

However, Mr. Gates, who is also well known for his sharp and varied
intellectual interests and his philanthropic commitment to education,
said this week that he had purchased the rights to videos of seven
lectures that Dr. Feynman gave at Cornell University called ?The
Character of Physical Law,? in an effort to make them broadly
available via the Internet.

Microsoft Research announced on Wednesday that Mr. Gates, who
purchased the rights to the videos privately from the Feynman estate,
BBC and from Cornell University, in cooperation with Curtis Wong, a
Microsoft researcher, has created a Web site that is intended to
enhance the videos by annotating them with related digital content.

If the lectures are so important, it would be equally important to make
them available under non patented encumbered non proprietary formats.
Microsoft had a real chance to do so by voting for Ogg Theora in HTML 5
but preferred to remain silent while Nokia and Apple screwed it up by
claiming submarine patent fears.

http://lwn.net/Articles/340132/

Google did its damage as well by unfounded claims that quality was not
good enough for them to use it YouTube

http://people.xiph.org/~greg/video/ytcompare/comparison.html

Red Hat meanwhile is funding the effort to improve Ogg Theora codec
quality (Thusnelda project)

http://xiphmont.livejournal.com/41489.html

I can actually play Ogg directly with Firefox 3.5 in Fedora 11 at the
moment but the fight between vendors over Flash, Silverlight and others
has set the web back one more time. If you want the web to remain open
instead of a quagmire of proprietary plugins, choose open codecs.

I think google youtube developers are lazy to migrate it's entire

Kudos to redhat . All the videos are available in ogg at

Yes , and Firefox 3.5 supports HTML 5 which has in built ogg video support .

Subject: [Ilugc] ILUGC.ORG is up, request for comments
Message-ID: <4A63C4F1.5040309@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've had some free time yesterday, and was able to setup a basic 
structure for ilugc.org. Right now, all the other domains, ilugc.com, 
ilugc.net and ilugc.info should redirect  to www.ilugc.org.

I'm not sure about the status of ilugc.in, because Balachander seems to 
have put a static page too (which I copied some content and layout from, 
thanks :). He hasn't clarified yet on the status of the domain, and 
going by the footer of that site, I'm assuming he wants to keep it for 
himself (sorry for the assumption Bala, you're free to clarify otherwise).

The code of the site is here: http://code.google.com/p/ilugc/, also 
accessible from the site navigation itself. As you can see, there is 
plenty of info to be added. I think the intro is woefully inadequate, 
and somebody needs to fill in the stellar community work some of us do, 
including the college outreach programmes.

Please get in touch with me for committer access. I want to invite 
Bharathi, SK, KG, Raman and whoever else is ready to take on the 
responsibility for owner/deployer access. Kindly respond with your 
preferred email ids (to me) so that I can add  you to the project. I've 
added the required info for what commiter/owner roles imply, please take 
a look at the project wiki.

Feel free to contribute ideas, improvements, issues, whatever. If you 
can code html/css, just ask for committer access :). I'm thinking the 
next priority is setting up the jobs board (at jobs.ilugc.org). I'm 
intending to try out jobberbase (http://www.jobberbase.com/). If anybody 
knows of a better option, please let me know.

Finally, the site is currently running on my own vps. So I'll be a 
little reticent to give sudo access to others. I'd like this to change 
as soon as possible. I haven't yet gotten the chance to ask 
Linode/Slicehost. I'll do so today, but in case they say no (there is a 
good chance of that - we don't have proper traffic stats to show them to 
get them interested - for e.g, how many current members do we have?), 
we'll have to arrange a process for this. A linode 360 vps (basic) costs 
close to $204 per year (includes 15% discount if we pay at one time) - 
that's close to 10,000 rupees.

The easiest way I see for this is to hold 'contribution drives'. Select 
a cause, like the last time we did for the ILUGC Prizes, and ask for 
contributions. A few of us just transferred the money to Bharathi's bank 
a/c the last time around. We can do something similar, and somebody who 
has a credit card can pay for the vps. If you guys want me to do this, 
I'll do it by all means, but please request my bank a/c personally. I 
believe people who have accounts in other banks other than mine can pay 
through NEFT. What do you guys think?

Vamsee.

ilugc.in is a community site. Bala is registered it for ILUGC and he
assured that it will remain as community site. Plz don't make
parallel sites for ilugc.

Obviously, the Gates/Microsoft interpretation of "free" is limited to
non-DRM content which the user does not have to pay per view.

I suppose my original post was misleading in emphasizing Silverlight
and Gates over the content of the lectures.  It was not meant to provoke
a format war with Silverlight vs HTML5 vs other.  I don't support
Silverilght either, it's yet another proprietary format, from yet another
company, which is irrational in it's attempts to lock-in content on the
web.


Feynman is a captivating speaker/teacher whom any student of the
sciences will find interesting.  I direct your attention to the content
of the lectures, rather than the delivery format (or lack thereof).

Message-ID: <d16b1c80907192157l45a71b31i3b7bf6320e6facbb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I had conducted a Fedora workshop ("GNUtsav") at National Institute of
Technology (NIT), Agartala [1], Tripura, India on July 18-19, 2009.

I would like to thank the Fedora project for sponsoring the event.
Special thanks to the student volunteers who worked hard in organizing
the event. Mention must be made for the support of the faculty,
Prof.Swapan Debbarma, Prof. Anupam Jamatia ("ajnr" on freenode), and
Prof. Dwijen Rudrapal.

My presentation sessions included:
* i-want-2-do-project. tell-me-wat-2-do-fedora.
* Badam Halwa of Embedded Systems
* di-git-ally managing love letters
* Fedora Electronic Lab (demo)
* Packaging RPM -- Red hot, Paneer (butter) Masala

The presentations are available from:
http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads.html

It has only been two years since this Institution has started. It is
25 km from Agartala city. The Institute has 50% reservation for State
students, and 50% for students coming through an All India Engineering
Entrance Examination. People speak Hindi, English, Bengali, and
Kokborok.

Guwahati, Assam is the main connectivity for this part of the world,
or, flying from Kolkatta, West Bengal is the other option. Subsidized
rate flights are available from major domestic carriers in India.
Helicopter service between North-Eastern States is also available,
but, is expensive. Bus journey from Guwahati, Assam to Agartala,
Tripura is very tedious, and might take atleast 24 hours. When passing
through the dense forests, CRPF [3] escort is required due to
insurgency problems in forest areas.

Students have access to distros at the labs, as well as in the hostel.
Power cuts are quite common here. Mobile cell coverage is nil or works
at only few places. Internet connectivity is nil or very slow on
campus. Hence, we have provided them with an offline Fedora 10
repository (around 24 GB) that they can use in their computers or in
the LAN. Special thanks also goes to dgplug user group from Durgapur,
West Bengal for the offline repos [2]. There are few browsing centers
in the city that students can use, but have to travel the distance
from the campus. Work is in progress to provide students with a Fedora
11 repository.

Agartala is a very scenic, lush green, and very peaceful place.
Hopefully when the construction work on campus is completed in the
next six months, they will be better equipped with Internet access for
communicating online, and for VoIP sessions.

As customary, here are few photos that I took during the trip:

Hmm. I don't understand. So why are we even having these long 
discussions about the site? What's the way forward? I didn't see any 
updates on what's happening on ilugc.in after I reported that it's been 
down a few days ago, and it now sports a couple of static pages. Why the 
sudden change of mind? Why aren't we informed of this? Why this opaque 
way of development? Why aren't the updates being shared on the list?

Well, I thought a more collaborative way of maintaining the site is what 
is being requested by everybody. I put up the site and created the 
project just to show how fast it could be done (1 day) and keep it open 
in the process. The parallel sites is a problem sure, but I'm trying to 
show that keeping the site up, updated and open is possible. As admitted 
by Bala himself, ilugc.in wasn't even unveiled until recently. So I 
don't see why ilugc.in cannot point to the ilugc.org server IP, given 
that I've already created the necessary ground work for others to 
participate.

Vamsee.

Hi,

Bala may be busy with his schedules as all of us do.
Even, he is ready to share his time and skill for ilugc.in

As there are too many opinions about the site,
I think he is trying some of them and will give us a better one.

Nice to see that more people are interested in our site.

Waiting to see the site in finished form.

:-)

I'm sorry if I'm coming across as pushy on this one - I wasn't shy to 
admit that I was on vacation, and the updates to a discussion thread 
might come slow. My fundamental question remains unanswered. Who exactly 
knows what the status is, apart from Bala? I don't blame him for being 
busy. But an update on the change of mind about the static pages would 
have been nice. It would have spared me some effort. Did anybody else 
know about those changes? Why wasn't it shared here?

Somebody has to put a priority on the features being requested by 
members. Somebody has to lead the discussion on what needs to be done 
_next_ and keep us posted about the progress, hopefully. If it's open, 
everybody will know, and chip in where they can to speed it up. I chose 
Google Code precisely because it has an issue tracker and features can 
also be put in there, with a priority.  All this doesn't even take too 
much time (especially of others chip in). I'm mystified about this 
pussyfooting to bring up a simple site and keep it running.

Vamsee.

I really appreciate the work done towards ilugc.in by Balachandar.
I also strongly feel that ilugc.in being the website of a community, 
should be run by the community (as ilugc.org is setup to be) rather than 
an individual.

That is exactly what we are trying to solve here! I appreciate Bala's
efforts, but, it will be good for more Maintainers to help the site,
when either one of us are busy!

When you have many people in a group, you are expected to get
different views. It is very natural. Nothing wrong with it.

I don't want to have a single Maintainer for the website, even if you
asked me to do it. I will obviously want the help of other web
developers in this list. That is how a _community_ of developers work!

Intially bala is decided to run the site in wiki/CMS. Due to the
previous spam issues, I requested him to make the few pages in static
HTML/simple PHP pages. Wiki/CMS will be liked from this pages and can
be used to create our own local documents.
 
> Well, I thought a more collaborative way of maintaining the site is

Yes. But Bala is doing the following to avoid spam and junk contents.

This time, wiki is not open by default. If anyone wants to create
login will have to send a req mail and links to discussion that they
have participated in ilugc mailing list. All commits will be protected
by captcha. 

I requested bala to implement this before releasing it to public.
Thats main reason behind the delay.

Bye :)

Send mail to whom? Do we have a bunch of developers/maintainers who
can take up the role of serving requests when / whoever is free? A
captcha (maths or image) while registering for the wiki + booting out
anonymous edits brings the spam attack numbers down to a great extent.
(worked very well for ubuntu-in.org)

Every new user registration can be configured to send an email to the
admins which he/she can *easily* verify the authenticity of the user.
Is'nt this sending an email request touching the nose round the head
kind of thing and again lead to the problem of the maintainer being
busy and not responding to the email?

Comments welcome! And as SK already put it, it would be really helpful
to keep the discussion on the mailing list (atleast a few status
updates) so that other interested people (like Vamsee) can also take
part in the creation and provide suggestions.

Thanks in advance.

This is a workaround. Not a solution to the problem.

Shrinivasan had this problem when he studied in the same college. Now
his junior (you). It doesn't solve the problem to your juniors,
either!

If possible, I request NRC-FOSS to sign a MoU with colleges, that
students/faculty can work with NRC-FOSS for any F/OSS project work
required. This could help us in working directly with students through
NRC-FOSS assistance.

Okay, but I find that strange, given that we were still debating static 
pages or wiki. Last I know, some of us continued to make arguments in 
favor of the static/open version, which were not responded to, 
satisfactorily.

Part of my motivation to put up the site over the weekend was to show it 
can be done faster than the time we're taking the time to discuss this 
back and forth, and I also suspected that the discussion will die once 
again with a limbo, only to be repeated at a later date.

My humble request is to try the new approach without being judgmental 
about it, especially since the wiki/drupal versions didn't give us 
expected results so far. If things don't work out, I'll be the first to 
pitch in with converting the content into dynamic mode. After all, most 
of it will be just cut and paste.


Vamsee.

My whole point is that the delivery format locks out of the content. The
more valuable the content is, the more frustrating the problem becomes.

This is because you installed from CD (probably), and did not update
your sources.list. The first sections of this would be helpful:

Feynman's Lecture's on Physics are also available as books(3 volumes I believe). Feynman was a Nobel Laureate and a great teacher as well. And on a side note, his lectures are a favorite of NR Narayana Murthy.

Looks great.

A minor niggle, though. Why is the content license CC-BY-SA but the
license displayed on the page CC-BY-NC-ND?

Reading through the licenses, I thought CC-BY-NC-ND would be appropriate 
too (along with Bala) since some of the content will only apply to 
ilugc, but later noticed that GCode only offers two options - CC 3.0 BY 
and CC 3.0 BY SA. I'm not sure why that is, but I'm hoping somebody more 
knowledgeable about licensing issues (and why Google chose only those 
two) can clarify.

But I really don't mind going back to CC-BY, given that some of the 
content (like FAQs) can be for general use (non ilugc-specific content), 
and I don't see the point of going NC-ND (disallowing commercial and 
derivative works) there. Any opinions on this?

Vamsee.

Hi. I am working in open source RTLinux.
Can you elaborate more about your query. I need the info like, which RTLinux
[RTLinux/GPL, RTAI, Xenomai,.etc] they are using, their requirement,.etc. So
that I can help you. Seems, they are using Advantech DAQ card. It is
possible to get the data from DAQ card in real time. But its an nightmare
job.

This is indeed good news. At least GPLv2 is not a "virus" according
to _some_ people in MicroSoft.

Now, if only they submit some of their patents to OIN (open invention
network) so that:

 1. Mono/.Net and Moonlight/Silverlight can gain wider adoption.
 2. Vfat can actually be used on all portable devices.
 3. Document formats for office use can converge.

If they do this we might even find them more friendly than some other
computer giants.

Just like the Hyper-V driver provides compatability _and_ thus
improves the chances for people to continue to use Windows, so will
the above actions provide a net gain for MicroSoft.

Or perhaps I am dreaming!

He is lucky. PCL-812pg is an ISA slot card and not PCI. Accessing the
functions of this card through the inb/outb family of functions in C is
quite simple. Write your own driver for this simple application. You have
pretty good documentation of the card's internal register map. It's simpler
to write it yourself.

Also your application seems to need only a counter/timer, why a multi
function card like the 812 was selected?! My opinion is that you should just
write a few lines of code to get access to the counter/timer in the 812
card.

You call also have a look at
http://www.comedi.org/<http://www.comedi.org/hardware.html>.
It's a brilliant project and there is support for the PCL812PG.


All the best.


With regards,
Arun

The GPL is apparently not a virus when you want the community to contribute 
towards improving the quality of your own product.

Now that they have improved the performance of running linux under Hyper-V, I 
wonder how well they'd work with or even answer to questions about improving 
windows performance under say xen or kvm, without shoving a NDA in the faces of 
the developers.


Call me pessimistic but I'm not really celebrating this news. It is just the 
same as any odd software/hardware vendor contributing drivers for their 
product/devices.

That said, I wonder whether this news is a direct effect of Red Hat's 
interoperability agreement with M$[1] ...if it is, cheers to Red Hat !

Did you mount manually?

Try this.
sudo mount -t cifs //myserver_ip_address/myshare /mount/point -o

Where are you editing the "samba files" on the server or the client?

/etc/samba/smb.conf defines the server configuration.
However, you need to test your samba server before you start connecting 
clients to it.  You can do it by using smbclient on the server itself.

On the client side you need the samba-client tools to mount the samba 
exports from the samba server.

Please read this Samba by example and it should get you going from the 
simplest to the enterprise level configurations.

http://us1.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-Guide/

In general, whenever you want to setup up any application, be it samba 
or ldap ..., it is helpful to read the docs published by that 
application's community.  Most of them are very helpful and sufficient 
to get you started with the basic configuration.

> how to solve this bugs?

I don't think it is a bug but insufficient reading on your part :)

It can be. Despite the false news, VFAT itself is NOT patented. What is
a patented is the stupid hack from longer names to short names. There is
a workaround.

I don't think Red Hat was directly involved in this effort. MS is after
all merely adding better support for running Linux as a guest thereby
improving the hold on their own platform. However

hi all:
a group of students from PSG Tech (guided internally by one of their
lecturers) are interested in working on an open source project on
"Integrating a compiler as a plugin for an open source browser".

the plan is to start some preliminary studies / learning of tools / works
over the next few months, and develop into a full project during even
semester.

anybody interested in being active/passive mentor? [If you have serious
comments about the feasibility, please do alert me].

"open source browser" is Firefox or Chrome, right?
"compiler" is something which goes down to machine code?

I'm assuming you mean compiling a programming language (can't think of
any alternative meanings), so this will be something like the v8
JavaScript engine for Chrome?

yes, at least to begin with.

I felt that there will be some interest.

Let me add some "explanation" (or is it a disclaimer?)
many of us do get queries from students / staff expressing interest to work
in open source. quite often, they just seek some topics to work on and some
times they get hold of topics (as Roshan mentioned) with cool keywords.

since my interactions are mostly with novices, I tend to do some checkup,
get some preliminary info and then ask the requestor to do more search /
study to get some concrete idea. then we could guide them re things to
learn, etc. More often than not, we may have to shift them away from the
original idea.

this time, i posted in the group -- since i am also trying to ask and answer
questions : what purpose and what is being attempted?

If there is some quick positive response, we can get them going. otherwise,
we can guide them differently.

thanks for all you time,
srinivasan.

I think it indeed is a good idea to post here. In this case, you might 
want them to take a look at Google's NaCl:

Also on second thoughts - if they're planning towards some sort of 
'scriptable browser' or a similar idea, Mozilla's Ubiquity and Jetpack 
projects are also interesting. Of course, it's all javascript, but 
there's very little you can't do with JS on a browser these days.

Vamsee.

Message-ID: <f6c15e7d0907221651o72281413gea65e17f82ffa65e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,
Here is an interesting article from Linux Journal which many us would
relate to one way or other .


Some excerpts from the artilce :

I am a Linux geek. There I said it. Actually, I am kind of proud of
being a Linux geek. I slogged through the bad old days to get here. It
seems like every day something new shows up that makes me glad that I
chose Linux as my tool of choice.

My life changed in my senior year of college. I came back from study
abroad and got introduced to a life long friend. I ended up joining a
small company that he had started. The goal was to build software.
Right out of the gate he told me he was using something called - Linux
- and asked if I wanted root access.

Although the idea of Open Source was there it wasn't a main stream
one. There were a number of companies that appeared on the scene to
help people use Linux and charge for support. All of them failed. I'm
not sure what they were thinking. The people who used Linux at the
time needed drivers not a help desk.

Hi,

Normally within your own PC and for your own development purpose you need
not go for an SVN-Apache integration. File protocol itself should be
sufficient.

Seeing below I find you to have created passwd files etc., that you might
need only with more users/ developers and want to grant them access etc.,

Hope you are using Ubuntu. The Subversion help page in Ubuntu should
provide enough information to begin with.

Message-ID: <961d4ad40907230843u43e336dfm4d194dd12def304d@mail.gmail.com>

I am Janet, doing my *B.E.final year* in *Jaya Engineering College.*For my
final year project, I have decided to design a *simple text editor like MS
notepad* which r*uns on all operating systems.*
It will be a *tamil notepad.*
I have used Azhagi, but it saves documents only in RTF format, which is not
readable in notepad.
So I want to create a notepad which will type entirely in tamil (and save in
its own extension), and will show the content as it is(in tamil), no matter
with what text editor we open that file.
As far as I have checked, a tamil notepad t*hat runs on all operating
systems, does not exist.*

But, if anyone of us has used something like that please let me know.
Also your suggestions on this idea are most welcome.

If you have any idea on the tools to be used, do tell me.

Janet.D

Also try to remount it :

  $mount -o remount,rw /dev/xxx

'xxx' is the device which you can find out from 'dmesg' command .

Yes reinventing is fun, but no use unless the former is really bad.
And text editor for a final year project is not a good idea, you can
make it as word processor in Tamil, but already exists.

Do a little more research and pick up something more challenging to the
*final* year standards (I had seen people doing AI or cloud computing).

new extention may not be a cure as the new extiontion or format may not be
readable in other text editors

Azhagi seems to be a free(but not open) software which does tamil
translation  try developing a pluggin for gedit or open office which does
the same !!

I'm not so sure. She'll probably learn more useful stuff re-inventing 
the wheel rather than doing some fancypants topics that she'll probably 
never deal with in her career. If she's interested in writing a 
localized text editor, perhaps we should point her to a more challenging 
topic *that includes her interest*. Perhaps a plugin for gedit that adds 
some functionality that's missing, as somebody suggested.

I fully agree. The point is they are not PhD students to invent
something. Project is there to give wholesome development experience not
discovery.

Also on the same topic I wish we start a project-idea for College students 
page in ilugc.in wiki.

Somehow we should find something similar to IEEE papers - atleast jargon wise- to give enough project ideas.

If you are using ubuntu 9.04, Then Network-manager itself recognize
your modem. Just right click on Network indicator on system tray and
select edit command. In new window, select wireless connection. It
shows your device then edit it as you required. NM have an lengthy

I made it for Aircel mobile internet in this way in ubuntu 9.04.

I am also got these type of problems when i am using my pendrive in
various systems Windows XP, RHEL4 and Ubuntu. I find the clue in my
experience. That is because of each time you are using your pen drive
in Linux creates 'lost+found' hidden directory and whenever you delete
the files in Linux creates 'trash' hidden directory with user name in
your pen drive. multiple directories of these causes read only
problems and slows your operation. Just delete it when you are in
windows. Don't break or cancel the task of deleting in Linux.

Heh. It's not about me liking it or not - I've expressed no opinions on 
your offering itself (though I should mention that your pricing is 
definitely not Indian :p). You've broken a bunch of mailing list 
etiquette, including hitting reply to an earlier message and changing 
the subject, using a bad timestamp (which screws up the formatting) and 
top-posting to boot. When you're posting to a technical mailing list, it 
helps to know some generally accepted/frowned-upon practices.

Hello Vamsee,

Thanks for pointing out the timestamp . I will take care of that in  
future for sure. I am a new member so it will take time to know  
everything. Rome was not definitely built in a day.

>> (though I should mention that your pricing is  definitely not Indian :p).

What do you mean by pricing is not definitely indian ? Can you take  
little pain here to explain ?

I am not asking them to research, but they can contribute to some better
projects (existing or conceivable). Plugins are small time not really
worthy of becoming projects. Just my thoughts.

Most international vps providers give the basic plan you're providing 
(guaranteed 256MB RAM, virtuozzo/openvz) for not more than 20 USD tops. 
That comes to around 1000 rupees. You're offering a comparable plan at 
1400 rupees.

One would expect the rates to be competitive if not *cheaper* when 
you're claiming the servers are hosted here (probably bandwidth would be 
more expensive, but it should be offset by lesser 
manpower/infrastructure costs, right?). Care to explain the difference?

Vamsee.

Vamsee,

First of all I appreciate your call for a good debate on the price  
issue. In my opinion one should not compare apple to orange.

Perhaps our price is the cheapest on the earth as far as using the  
INDIAN DATACENTER is concerned. And we will match any price if you get  
a quote for the price what you are talking about from somewhere else.

There is a huge difference between OpenVZ/Virtuozzo and Parallels'  
virtuozzo . The earlier is free and have less features compared to the  
later which is commercial and license cost is about $10 per container  
on an avg. of 20 VEs on a hardware node.

Second the Bandwidth cost in India is at least 5-10 times costlier  
than any international providers.

Regarding the cost of manpower, you should not forget that most of the  
International providers who provide the same spec below $20 uses the  
same manpower what we use.

As you said less than $20 bucks , we offer a better VPS less than $20  
bucks but at USA DC.

I would suggest have a price check before you come forward with debate.

At the same time the same VPS is provided by few providers below $5,  
the difference is the Hardware setup with respect to CPUs and RAID ,  
RAM etc.

I hope I have clarified the difference between apple and orange.

I think what Vamsee refers to is the "thread hijacking"
aspect. Meaning that instead of drafting a fresh mail, you have just
hit reply on an existing mail and changed the subject. While some mail
clients treat this mail with new subject as a different thread, some
do not. So, your mail is shown as a reply to the thread "SVN how to
work" in my mail client.

Just wanted to clarify the thread hijacking part.

Thanks.

why not? the wheel has been reinvented lakhs of times - and so we have a huge

Hello Mano,

Thanks for your suggestion. There is nothing confrontation here , it  
is an explaination to what has been asked. Respect is mutual I think.

Regarding post-sales, you can read our reviews. Thank you.

\--

I should have been more specific. If implementation-wise they are
different (if the developer sees a reason for it), it is ok.
Otherwise, they would all be the same.

1. If someone wants to know how to write a text editor, the power of
F/OSS gives them the source code to see how it is done. By tinkering
(prints, changing, testing) the code, they will learn how it has been
done.

2. It also gives them the chance to learn from 'past' history and
experiences on how a particular 'text editor' project has come to this
stage, and answers questions like 'what', 'why', 'how', 'where',
'when' things are done the way it has been done, so they don't have to
re-do the same mistakes that other developers made. Re-using code also
means re-using history.

3. It is helpful for a newbie to write an extension or module or
plugin for an existing project (unless the entire project design
doesn't exist in the first place, and the newbie is capable of working
on it), that adds value in terms of:
* domain knowledge for the student
* learning to work with team members of a project, and
* adds value/functionality to the existing project.

4. IMO, a newbie must do one task at a time, and learn it very well
(helps boost confidence), because they are seldom used to
multi-tasking, and might lose track very easily. In this context, one
must always:

(a) Write stub functions to understand how things work in a
programming environment. Here, they learn how things work in an
environment (or programming paradigm).

(b) Use knowledge of (a) in implementing the project specific
requirement. Here, their environment is being tested in real-time on a
project implementation.

(c) Test (b). If it fails, review (a) and/or (b).

(d) If (c) succeeds integrate it with the project code base.

Most newbies attempt (a), (b), (c) in parallel, and veer off course.

I have to disagree again. I've seen my share of fresher CVs, and if 
there's anything remotely related to something "wrote an xyz plugin for 
gedit", trust me, it would get my attention. Unfortunately most of them 
are so boring (and sometimes irrelevant) that my eyes glaze over.

And I don't think plugins are 'unworthy' of becoming projects - there's 
plenty of cool stuff you could add to gedit. Perhaps code-folding. 
Snippets (a la Textmate). Adding some sort of compile/console plugin 
targeting a new language. From what I heard, implementing tab completion 
can be pretty challenging. Very few editors do it right.

Either way, my emphasis was not particularly on how challenging the 
subject itself is, but rather getting the experience of contributing to 
an open source project. That is more in line with what a fresh engineer 
is likely to do (or prove more valuable) once he/she gets out of college.

Vamsee.

I'd have to disagree. I thought it was confrontational too, and I 
deliberately chose to downplay it as I didn't want the discussion to get

You have not respected the list guidelines in the first place. I don't think
you even cared to read it. Nor does your response sound polite! I wonder if
your manager is even aware of the damage you are doing to odishahosting!

No thanks. I am on the lookout for a VPS service now. But from your
attitude, odishahosting certainly doesn't figure in the shortlist. If am
annoyed at some deficiency in service, I think your support staff would
respond equally annoyed - respect is mutual they would claim.

Most people will agree with him on those points.

How about hatred of RMS, "Free Software", Emacs, SVN etc.?  Are those
diseases too?

This seems pretty interesting. Just a few questions though:

a) Where is your Indian datacenter located?

b) Why are your US plans so much better than the Indian plans at half the
cost?

By the way, I am very glad to see such an initiative based out of Orissa.

It does not relate to any software per se - only to web hosting.

I think this was posted here because it relates to Linux hosting. She was
careful enough to only link to the Linux VPS plans in her email though
they also have Windows VPS plans.

For the student it is a project. For some (possibly many) of us, it is just
an exercise of old examples. If we agree to this mindset, we can get a wide
spectrum of students to do "projects".

after a while, we could suggest that do this "project/exercise" for a while,
and get into some (acceptable) project mode as soon as possible.

contributing to existing project needs time to learn, and it can be taken up
only by a handful of college students. in fact, such students would have
been into FOSS for quite some time.

if we have to broadbase FOSS among students, we may to reinvent wheel
umpteen times. of course, we could put a codicil: "we will help you if you
help us with getting some testing/documentation done with an existing
project of interest to me."

Message-ID: <a3b05e8b0907240332l6a32e98eo3af72bf6ebd3a922@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I must admit that i have never been a great fan of partitions and have never
bothered about them much(smite me!). Have continued to upgrade from Feisty
to Ibex and never got to the hassles of partition management. Though a dual
boot, my Win was hardly booted a handful of times in the last year; and now
i need to remove it from my machine after i found out that the file
associations etc have been badly affected due to some worm.

What i am looking for:
- How partitions work (the technical angle and insights)
- Understanding Partitions (user's perspective)
- Effective partitioning techniques or methodologies

I did google and stumble on some numerous links, but am sure that there will
be some-great-link-which-is-a-must-read-which-and-i-havent-read.
It would be great if *gyaan *is showered in this arena on me :)

It is no longer necessary to learn how to partition a disk in the
DOS sense.

Choice 1: Just use parted with your favourite interfaces,
command-line, curses, GTK, QT, ...?

Choice 2: Make just one LVM partition which you can then use via LVM2
in any way you like (parted also speaks LVM). Then use grub-pc (grub2)
to boot your system.  (Or if you insist you can use lilo as well).

One advantage of the second method is that you can resize your
logical block devices later as you find you need less/more space.
In this case the static "mbr" can be retired along with Windows!

Regards,

Kapil.

Hello Kenneth,

Do you mean to say a commercial tagged posting from a someone should  
always talk about services about free softwares ?

I didn't find this in the forums rule. Can you please point me to such  
rule here ? I am not aware of this.

Hello Prem,

a. The datacenter is at Hyderabad, India. You can find the network  
detail along with speed test at http://www.odishahosting.in/Network.php

b. As I have already explained the b/w cost is 5-10 times costlier  
than US. This has only added the cost to the price. However, there is  
no significant difference between our India and US Plans in terms of  
spec but b/w.

Thank you.

I  am also not aware of it. But in this group, the members make the rules. And 
my rule is to flame anyone who talks of non-free software here. And by non-free 
I do not mean non-cost - I mean proprietary software. This includes people who 
use bad things like Control Panel to run their web apps. So go ahead and post. 
You will not be banned. But I will flame you.

Hi !

Now that Ex-infosys guy in charge of the national identity project will
Microsft have a hand in this project.
As such many processes in corporate matters like digital signatures etc are
not playing well with open source.
I only hope this does not happen with a project of national importance like
this.

Open source is the right tool for a country like india and has to be
popularised and adopted well!  I think we should plan something towards
having open source strategy in the UID project, Though money is not our
side, cost savings and quality is on the opensource side! CDAC is very much
on our side!

I don't know what % of the national informatics center's servers are running
on linux or windows?? anyone has info on these! I am really curious

sincerely

I've been thinking of this ever since the news came out. Is there a 
formal group of open source people to raise this issue and give it 
enough exposure in the press? If I'm not wrong, Venkatesh Hariharan is 
raising this issue with Ministry of IT on behalf of RedHat. Anyone else? 
Any LUG activity across India to lobby against use of proprietary 
software in a project of such national importance?

Vamsee.

Microsoft has been creating a lot of soft conner with their AID programes of
Bill GATES to capture the Indian market, along side being really loose on
piracy issues! knowing fully well that Indians would switch to linux in no
time, once they do anytype of crack down!

Linux proliferation in india depends on quite of bit of government
patronage! So i think this is a serious issue!

Indeed it is.

It is much more constructive than simply complaining about creativity.
People can contribute to the "Idea bank" in lugc . Students can pick up
topics , refine and do projects.

I do not agree to the idea that final year project should be very innovative
and very creative. It is not a competition . it is about learning. So long
as students research ,spend time on it and learn something then it has
served the purpose.

It is unfair to trash ideas , however trivial it may sound to be. The
purpose of final year project should not be forgotten. You are focused on
leading edge IT technology where innovation may be possible by ordinary
people. But what about other subjects like mechanical or electrical
engineering ? Do we expect students to come up with some original "Nobel
class" subjects ? They can only do some research on existing topics .

Cheers

Talking of re-inventing wheels , NRCFOSS already has a project ideas
page where many new students have given their ideas.
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/ProjectIdeas

There are some well assembled guidelines which new students could read
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/ProjectGuidelines so that the
interactions with mentors would remain smooth and fruitful .
There is also a mentor list of all free software contributors who
could help the students in their area of expertise
 http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/FellowshipMentors

Since NRCFOSS is based in chennai , my opinion is to unite both the
efforts of LUG and NRCFOSS to help students on FOSS projects .

 Kick in some word-based prediction  and semantic checkers that sure warrants
a good deal of *final* year standards.

The session was good with interaction by students and faculty.
I thank the management and faculty for the opportunity - specifically
Mr.Manoj Lecturer who the main motive force behind this.

yes,this is selvam,studied in Jaya Engineering college,I have started to add
Tamil spell checking capability to Gedit editor as a plugin and you could
find details here,

    https://launchpad.net/~tamilspellchecker

I started it as my final year project with the guidance of Amachu and
Sivaji(Gsoc) ,  my juniors have started to extend its features(eg. need to
refine the words ) and add similar feature to Open Office.They are doing it
as their final year project.

Message-ID: <809586140907250431k26012b16m82cca23ed216e31c@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Luggies,

I am trying to write an application which encrypts data in javascript
and decrypts them back in Java JCE. I am trying to use AES algorithm.
But, i find that the bytes don't match.

I tried the following javascript libraries

1) jses
2) slowaes

but none work with Java JCE in any mode

I am trying both ECB and CBC modes for encryption.

The encrypted output bytes from both Javascript and java JCE
mismatches. I don't understand what may be the problem or am I missing
something.

In javascript the bytes comes more than 128 but not the case in Java
JCE. I am also trying to convert the strings to UTF8 before
encryption.

Have anyone tried this. Please help me out.


Thanks and Regards,

Why do you want to do this? If you are using normal SSL, this is done

Hi all,

         I am working on a qemu emulated image which has debian lenny[5.0]
running on it. I tried compiling a C file and got a "*command not found*"
message. I installed glibc-4.3-base and recompiled but to see the same
message. I checked the PATH [$PATH =
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin] variable. Many
web pages ask to look into the PATH  or to install the gcc package. Is there
any thing else I have to look for.

Thanks in advance.

Its a very valuable viewpoint. 

I wish the FOSS extremists (if there are any) in ilugc to learn & cultivate such viewpoints.

Becos, at times I see some discriminations & exclusiveness, when members take directly on Microsoft.

A real engineer has to be very neutral in getting into the problem & its solution. It has nothing to do with who we deal with.
(Best example is Doctors who just treat u as a patient no matter who u r.)

I took the below from

[..]
"* I do agree that ?Microsoft Hatred? is a disease ? *In the over-dramatized

idea of what hatred is than some others. I don?t hate Microsoft, for
example. And I welcome *?open* development? ? *so long as everyone is

the first part. If Microsoft wants to play by the rules, then welcome to the
game. "

"* There are ?extremists? in the free software world,-* I
*respectfully*disagree, because I think it has an implication that the
entire Free

Excellent. Just when was going to download all the dependencies for a friend of

Is it also possible to create a single-All deps built in Proprietary
Codecs package
for Fedora. Quite a few need it.

Note that none of the codecs included in Omega are proprietary. They are
free software codecs excluded from Fedora due to software patents that
don't affect us in India. As to the actual question, yes you can

# yum install gnome-packagekit-extra

# gpk-service-pack

Enter the packages you want to. It will create a <foo>.servicepack which
is a tarball with all the RPM's + a single config file. Copy the service
pack to another Fedora system and user can click and install it.

Service pack creator downloads all the dependencies of the specified RPM
package regardless of whether it is installed on your system. For
example, a service pack for for the package quake3-demo will include
quake3-demo, quake3, opengl-games-utils and bash and you can transfer it
and install it on a friend's system with Fedora 11 installed on the same
architecture. To demonstrate, I have created one for you:

To test, download

http://sundaram.fedorapeople.org/packages/experimental/quake3-demo-fedora-11-i686.servicepack

Click on it on a Fedora 11 (x86_32) system and you should be able to
install it without any extra dependencies.

A very perfect question. But, our clients can't afford SSL. They don't
want to have a dummy certificate (I think we are unable to convenice
them) . I know a dummy certificate is still secured than without SSL.
So, we have no other go.

Btb. yesterday I tried without padding and ECB mode (I know it is not
very secure) and I got them to be matching (jsaes and JCE). So, there
is some way out.

I will post once I get it done.

If I am not wrong, AES uses a symmetric key encryption.
Well, if you are using a JavaScript based encryption, that is going to
encrypt your data on the browser, using a symmetric key encryption,
you are effectively sending the key to the browser. This means that
you offer ZERO security. A security that cannot even been viewed as a
security.

You better convince your clients that, SSL, atleast by using a self
signed certificate is better than using a "false" security.

Does any one know the cost of SSL certificates provided by Indian
Signers, such as TCS?

Hi all,
I tried building and installing VLC 1.0 from source. There is a script
that automatically downloads and installs the dependencies required to
build VLC player. During the installation the script tried to get the
code from a subversion repository and the download failed as I was
behind a firewall and proxy and the subversion repository was in an
outside network.

So I canceled the process, edited my ~/.subversion/servers file to
specify my proxy settings and then tried running the script again. But
still the 'svn co' command to download from an external repository
failed to connect to that repository. How to check out the code from
an external repository in that case?

Thank you.

Regards,
Guruprasad.

Please make sure your proxy server is configured to accept subversion
methods such as PROPFINDS, REPORT, etc. If not make your proxy to
support that as explained here,

Message-ID: <92f9a9560907261038x317dd3eak1c8e104f20ad0c30@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

A friend runs a website which was hacked recently -- someone
injected javascript into all the html files and did some bad things.

The issue has been fixed, but to ensure such modifications
are identified quickly, I'm looking for an application which can
monitor the website and email me whenever it's modified.
It will be great if this application can ignore dynamic content
like hit counters, etc.

My web searches only returned utilities which report on website
up/down conditions and do not check the content.  Perhaps I'm
missing something.

Can anyone suggest a good utility which I can run non-interactively,
preferably through cron, and can address my requirement?

Thanks in advance,

- Raja

Rather than waiting for some one to hack the site and then getting on act
which  makes no difference from what your friend has done now.  Its better
to find the security holes. use some tools like Paros and try to fix them .
like http://www.parosproxy.org/index.shtml

on googling on your requirement I got some thing .I dont know how far is it
going to be useful to you.

Are you versioning your website data? Most of the versioning tools
available now provide you mail a mail with changeset. Also some of them
have the capability to bless the changeset even before it goes into
trunk.

Also called XSS - cross-site scripting attacks. The best way to avoid 
this is clean up all the inputs that the forms are accepting from the 
users. This might be what you're looking for:

Thanks for all the suggestions on fixing the problem, I should mention
that I am aware of the commonly used attacks as well as techniques
and tools to thwart them.

This website is 100% static html and does not contain any dynamic
bits or html forms.  The problem occurred due to web server config
issues by the hosting provider and this has been resolved independently.

Seems like the only solution for my problem is to put together my
own solution, though I find it unlikely that I'm the only one with such

If you want to install java in redhat, download the J2SE binary for
linux from java.sun.com. Executing it will install jdk in the current
directory.

Oops, sorry for misunderstanding about the nature of the problem. I hope 
I can suggest a slightly non-conventional solution - I'm not even sure 
if it works if all the content added is just javascript - but I guess 
it's worth a try - try setting it up as a source in notify.me 
(http://notify.me) - a webapp that sends notifications to email, im, 
etc. when a site gets updated.

No. Need Web based IDS in PHP Script. That would mail you all the details
about your visitor. Either he is novice or leet we need the details about
him. This script would send the details about where he is accessing from.
Which country, location, city, Which browser and operating system. Even it
can send the url he used to inject. i mean XSS. or SQL queries he has tried
in ur website.

Hope it may be useful. Your thoughts and POVs are welcome.

Subject: [Ilugc] problem with jquery date widget
Message-ID: <200907281521.56352.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,
I have a form with a date field. I load jquery like this:

<script type="text/javascript">
  
  $(document).ready(function(){
    $("#datepicker").datepicker({ altField: '#id_expires',altFormat: 'yy-mm-
dd', });
    
  });
  </script>

this works as it sets the date in the text input field and saves ok. Since it 
defaults to current date, this is what I need. The problem arises when I edit 
this form. Then a value is passed to #id_expires. I need to set the date 
widget to that value - can not figure out how to do it.

Put together the following solution:

Cron + wget to fetch all the watched urls (with the http headers).

Check in all watched files into a svn repo.  Subversion is intelligent
enough to commit only if the file content is modified.

Setup a post-commit hook on the svn repo which emails me the
diffs whenever a successful commit is done.

As an added bonus I get to keep multiple versions of the
website as an offline backup.

I would note the subtle difference between a time based development
freeze and a time based release in the actual announcement. They are not
the same thing.

Indeed freeze and release are not the same thing. Occasionally long
freeze periods have led to many people to freeze their work on Debian
which is also a bad thing!

So I see this announcement with mixed feelings.

Quote
===================
open the /etc/network/interfaces file.

sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces

If you are using DHCP for your primary network card which is usually
eth0, you will see the following lines

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

As you can see, it?s using DHCP right now. We are going to change dhcp
to static, and then there are a number of options that should add and
here is the example and you can change these settings according to
your network settings.

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.1.100
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.1.0
broadcast 192.168.1.255
gateway 192.168.1.1

Restart the neworking service using the following command

sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

Simply right click on NetworkManager, edit your interface e.g. eth0
and change IP to static and give the IP. All done without the need to

Great. Thanks for sharing how it is done.

So, you keep checking-in whatever is there in the website. Might be a
labeling might also help?

Do you plan to  have a "cleanup job" to clean Very very old data?

The problem is that there is bug in KDE Network Manager in (K)Ubuntu
9.04 . You will not be able to access the screen to change IP address
settings. I faced the same question last week and configured it the
way mentioned above :-)

Subject: [Ilugc] [Commercial][X-Post]Required: Software vendor to create
 application for NGO (Mumbai based)
Message-ID: <4A7050AE.6030307@lonetwin.net>

Hi,

An acquaintance of mine works for a Mumbai based NGO[1]. They are looking to 
replace (and add additional features to) an existing application that they use 
to record and manage their data (I don't know the exact details about this yet).

The current application they use was built by a couple of guys using ASP+MS SQL. 
They do not have the source code for the current application. So, they are 
looking to:

a. Replicate all the functionality of the current application.
b. Migrate the current data to the new application.
c. Add a new module which provides a workflow similar to the existing one.
d. Design the application in such a manner that allows addition of further 
workflows.
e. Provide support and feature enhancement (for something like 5+ years)

They also would like to share this application with their offices worldwide if 
they find it useful enough for their purposes.

I strongly recommended that they go the Open source way by asking whichever 
vendor they choose to provide them with the source code under a FOSS license.

I further recommended that they insist on building the application using FOSS 
(for instance, a LAMP stack). Now, since they are non-technical per se and it 
seems like their original software provider is no longer 'available', they need 
guidance/advice for the specifications itself.

So, here's my request, can somebody in Mumbai ...
a. Be willing to visit this organization, take a look at their existing 
application and advise them on the best (FOSS oriented) approach to take ? 
(It'll be nice if someone can do this without slapping a consulting fee on them).

b. Build this application and provide the required support (This, of course, 
would be a regular business contract).

Obviously, (a) and (b) can be the same person/company.

If you are interested, please contact me offline and I'll provide further details.

cheers,
- steve

So the problem is only for those using KDE. Am not aware of that since
I just have GNOME on ubuntu and NetworkManager works fine.

You don't need to follow such a newbie unfriendly process these days.
Simply right click on NetworkManager, edit your interface e.g. eth0
and change IP to static and give the IP. All done without the need to
touch any config files or go to CLI.

You mean something like "rm -rf svnrepo/"? :-)

This website is updated a few times a year, so I'm not terribly concerned

You mean you want to use two connections simultaneously? You want to
look for "load balancing" network sharing on your favurite search
engine. Typically, for WAN links this is done by choosing one route
for each new outgoing TCP/UDP connection. You also use round-robin DNS
so that new incoming connections can choose a route "at random".

Once the gateway machine does this and also does network address
translation (NAT), the machines behind the gateway need not care how
the load balancing is carried out.

Kapil.

Hi,

I have built a RPM package of recent version of openssl-0.9.8k
targeted for x86_64 platform.
The system has both i686 and x86_64 version of openssl-0.9.8b. When I
update the system with the newly built rpm the "docs" fileset
conflicts with the older version of openssl (i686).

# rpm  -qa openssl

openssl-0.9.8b-10.el5

# rpm -qa --qf '[%{NAME}.%{ARCH}]\n' openssl

I have gone through some documents which says each man page file's md5
should match with the previous one and I guess it is difficult to do
that.
I understand I can force install or use "--nodocs" option to overcome
this. But, is there an elegant way of modifying the new rpm (spec
file) to fix this issue all together (and also install the new docs).

Apparently you did *not* bother to read SK's netiquette guideline and 
top posted.

Anyway, there are a couple of appliance type Linux solutions that could 
possibly meet your requirement.

The CD Router Project <http://www.easylivecd.com/english>
The ZeroShell <http://www.zeroshell.net/eng/>

These were recently discussed in the Pune LUG list.  

To increase your knowledge base, you must subscribe to a lot more lists 
(if not already).  Although it increases the number of mails in your 
Inbox, you will come across nuggets of information in various lists.  

Also strive to develop the knack for searching the 'Net for a solution - 
this will help you to help yourself.

1. We had a discussion originating from Mettur Mohan, I think on this
a month or two ago. [1]
2. LARTC has good good howtos on load balancing. [2]
3. Apart from the above, you can also check Vyatta. I suspect it would
be more useful in long term given that it is OSS, has commercial
support and a good scripting/configuration management system. Better
than managing multiple config files for different subsystems.
Routerlinux, Leaf Bering [3] [4] [5] apart from the above are options.
4. You'll also need to determine if you need Julian Anastatov's
patches on a standard linux system if you intend using one with dead
gateway detection. Normally needed in load balancing scenarios to
ensure failover switching [6]

then remove the 32bit stuff from the machine - and take a lesson on how 
multilib works. eg: md5's match on docs = not a conflict. So, either 
build the i386 one to match identically ( as its done upstream ) or 
remove the 32bit rpms from the machine.

people who propose stuff like --nodocs or --force are all basically 
clueless as to what they are doing.

ofcourse if you are rebuilding it - why are you not changing the Release

So myopic.

Most standards are just specifications. Implementations are either
open source or closed source/proprietary. What is meant by standards
here are tools, platforms and software stacks.

Most services vendors in India are tied into proprietary stacks to
service clients abroad. Most of the US still runs on proprietary
stacks. These service organisations are so short sighted that they do
not see the opportunity.

Roll back to circa 1984. The Rangarajan committee for Banking Reforms
specified Unix as the platform. In a year's time, India was Unix
country. By 1987, India had a huge body of expertise which provided a
impetus to Unix porting, tuning and applications services exports. HCL
and Wipro were the main beneficiaries.

If Indian Govt now standardises on OSS, this will lead to a body of
expertise getting built up perforce. This will provide a second growth
innings thrust which will be based on expertise rather than labour
arbitrage. This is precisely the role expected of a policy making body
and Govt as the largest customer taking stances to guide India's ICT
competitiveness. The Western world will soon move towards OSS and
India needs to be poised for that.

Hope good sense prevails amongst the powers that be.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0907311504100.1420-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

Hi all,

Recently to simulate HW issue, in a properly running (Linux) system,
we removed the power cable and reconnected after ~1min. During the HDD
power off and after the power on condition, whatever appl running in
memory is continue to run, till it needs to access the HDD and it
crashed at the time of accessing the HDD. Unable to start any appl or
command and got I/O Error. Only after a reboot, system back to normal
condition.

Someone can throw a light on "why system unable to come back to normal
after HDD power reconnected". And during hibernate, How the appl are
able resume back to normal operation?

Bye :)

During Hibernate, the entire content of RAM is dumped on the swap space. 
On the next boot, the kernel just loads the memory contents from swap. 
So you have all the applications and files just as they were previously.

I think if the harddisk spin down features are used before powering it off
and again spin it up during power on and then applications can get access.
may be you can get some better result. I am not sure of this, but this is
just an idea i got it from here

In the problem condition also, RAM hold all the HDD status. I thought,
system should come back to normal status. My Q is what are the HDD
specific info/status is stored during the hibernate??

I am no expert on kernel hdd drivers, but using generic embedded principles:

HDDs are intelligent devices with their own internal embedded processors.
Their status and activities are set/read through internal registers inside
the HDD hardware. The BIOS and the linux kernel drivers would set these
registers to a known state during booting. Power cycling the HDD will reset
these registers to power on state (default state). The BIOS and the kernel
drivers will most probably not keep track of this and will remain assuming
the state of these registers to be what they set before power cycling the
HDD.  This will almost certainly lead to a crash.

Spin Down != Power Off. Bcoz HDD is still in power-on condition and 
maintain its internal status properly.

hi Mahalingam

http://www.slideshare.net/kanchilug/how-to-install-ubuntu-as-dual

from this link u can download pdf for how to install ubuntu as dual boot (
with other os as windows )..

i hope, already you know very well how to install ubuntu..

but i have confused little bit from your side .

 no need to partition separately for  /usr , /boot . .

i think so...

create swap area as logical and allocate space for root ( / ) as primary .

thats all.   for more example with screen shots , see above slideshare .

surely it will boot fine.

enjoy with ubuntu. !

I don't know how to put this but looks like there is something bad
happening in the CentOS world. 

<snip>

Some people may have noticed the open letter to Lance Davis that has
appeared on the CentOS website (www.centos.org) or the CentOS mailing
list (http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos/2009-July/079767.html).
Some people may also notice that the project was not running as it
should lately. Since it is in the open now I can talk about all this.
These are my personal opinions about this issue.

Considering all the hype about open source projects being better than the
traditional internships in the big companies, due to a variety of reasons
has intrigued me quite a bit. They say that I can choose any module of any
software and develop it in whatever manner I like.

Assuming all the above stated naiveties are, in fact, true,
a) how do I find these projects?
b) who would be my internship mentor?
c) on what basis will he take me up?

these are only a few of the questions that propped up in my head
spontaneously.
It would be really kind of all you people if you could satiate my queries.

Note: Quite ostensibly, I am a newcomer to the open source area, albeit I
possess a considerable amount of experience in programming (C,C++,Java)

... if it is only for your use. But, if you intend to submit it back
to the project (upstream), you need to work with them.

For a start:

Existing project team members who are interested.

It is best for you to talk to them.

You _never_ attempt to do a project in a language that you know, but,
you take the programming language that helps you to implement a
project, or solve a problem in the required domain space. Use
programming languages as tools.

You haven't specified your area/domain of interest, time-frame of the
project, and what are your expectations out of the project.
