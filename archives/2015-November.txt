Dangerous, unless your file name string has an unique pattern.
Otherwise, you might end up overwriting already renamed files!

As the discussion shows it can be done in many ways!  The perl purist
would probably give you a one liner :)  and there are others like
bash, python and ruby (Shakti Kannan's solution).

mmv (mass rename/move) comes to my mind -- details 'man mmv'

Also this links provides some good bash examples
<http://www.peteryu.ca/tutorials/shellscripting/batch_rename> that I
found through uncle Google.

The above maybe moot in your case but posting here for future
reference, in case it comes up again.

What do you mean by replace?

Use your distro's package manager to upgrade your MySQL packages.
Some one has already mentioned Percona; they build RPM/DEB packages
for all the major distributions out there.

*Before* doing this exercise on your production server, I would
strongly recommend that you carry out exercise on a prototype server
(using a copy of your production data) and make sure you work out all
the kinks (if any) in the upgrade process.   Since it is production, I
would suggest do not go beyond 5.6.x.  It has been vetted in the field
whereas 5.7 (not released yet) may still have some quirks post
release.

Tried restating the carbin cache, carbon-relay and graphite-web, but the
timeout message is reporting.

Sending data is not seeing the graphite. Please help.

Something is wrong with the daemon setup, it is respawning too fast.
The message is clear.

Backtrack to whatever changes you made to carbon-relay and
carbon-cache.  I believe there are enough docs on carbon/graphite so
please RTMF.

Message-ID: <CAJ=JFU=hQ3vv1edjdfyodOfVcdJFRrc6TTSZTFVBjGcRVaUQLg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All.,

             I am facing the issue on live server and the live server is in
"CENTOS",some malicious hit is going out of my server through the port
number 53 and even though I ran too many too like rkhunter,etc. But I
didn't found the malicious file or output from my server itself.

             And the host name is consider as malicious is "irc.nets.hk",and
it doesn't have any valid ipaddress.,and result of this my cloud provider
DNS blocked my server ip.

            Can I block the port number 53 in my server itself (both
outgoing/incoming ).,and I didn't use the port number 53 for my application.

            I can see the output only through "tcpdump on the specfic port
53"

              Results:

            But I didn't get any results on my netstat and isof.,

            Kindly share difference between tcpdump and netstat

           Through Iptables we have block the port number 53 ? Is it
possible on OS level ?

           Blocking of port 53 make any issue on server because I am using
port 22,25,80 and 443.

           What actually the port 53 do in default server's.


            Thanks in advance.

Looks like a DNS request. If you block outgoing port 53 you will likely 
not be able to resolve DNS.

Did your provider tell you in detail why they blocked your access to 
their DNS?

You could try running suricata on your host to see if it tells you more 
about suspicious network activity.

Regarding Difference on

(used for Packet Monitoring) TCPDUMP -  we can use this to capture the
packets on various ports,protocols and ip addresses.. its just a dump copy
of what is happening on it..

(used for analyzing network activity) NET STAT- gives just a status of your
live activity of your system in network ( port,protocol,ip wise ) not an
report or dump like TCPDUMP..

then Regarding 53 port closing kindly check whether your have server
getting resolved in public..if your client access it through name then it
wont resolve them ..kindly  check it and do..

check also the provider message for blocking it.

Naresh kumar v

rkhunter is not a sufficient  to check for compromises.  You should
have installed 'aide' as well.  'rpm --verify' will show compromised
files assuming your RPM db files are not compromised.

Prima facie, it appears your server is hacked with a bot that floods
DNS query requests i.e. DOS attack.

Incoming yes, outgoing to dest port 53 will disable all DNS lookups on
your server.

These could have been compromised.   Install busybox and use it's
equivalent replacement for tools like netstat, ps, find etc. 'man
busybox' shows all the functionality it provides.

Your best bet would be take backups of your data and start with a
fresh install and apply all security patches to the latest before
throwing it open for business.

How do you compile now? Search online for tutorials on Makefiles, and
it should be pretty straight-forward to write one. You can also refer
my presentation on Makefiles:

Which library are you using? Please provide more details.

That is a generic question. For which programming language? Which
compiler do you use?

Please give complete information when asking a question.

I don't think the above will work.  "log.*" wildcard matches the
compressed files also.  So change the regex or specify the log file's
complete name.

Also, logrotate would need some finite amount of time to rename the
current log file and replace it with a 0 length logfile for the daemon
to log.

If your daemon supports a SIGHUP, then it might be worhtwile to do a
postrotate SIGHUP so that the daemon starts logging on the new file.
Also, try delaycompress in conjuction with compress.  For more
details,  RTFM   "man logrotate."

You may have to experiment with the logrotate options to get what you want.

Just a thought, if your distro is a RHEL/derivative check for SELinux gotchas.

It would be great if you could share your solution.

HTH,

Thank you for your update.

I am keeping 90 logs like :
message.log.1
message.log.2
message.log.3
.
.
message.log.90

and I need to keep two archive files for every log for 40 days files. But
now the logrotate
log.* {

option is taking "message.log.3.gz" files also in the next logrotate cycle.

I need to exclude the .gz files rotation.

I think this will fix ::

log.[1-9][0-9] {
        daily
        missingok
        rotate 2
        dateext
        dateformat -%Y-%m-%d-%s
        compress
        maxage 40
}

Your original email does not provide much detail about the file types
which invoke the error as well as the player(s) you are using. I am
guessing <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Forbidden_items?rd=ForbiddenItems>
is the page you should read

<https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/23/html/Installation_Guide/chap-preparing-for-installation.html#sect-preparing-upgrade-or-install>
provides some detail around the upgrade paths and methods.

Also, the <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/india> is
a mailing list to subscribe to if you'd like to participate in the
Fedora community.

Hi,

   Just install KODI Media Center....

1 ) Connect your PC to the Internet. Open the terminal and type the below
commands

dnf install
http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm
-y

and

dnf install kodi -y


That's all. Open the "KODI Media Center" from start menu or just type
"kodi" from the terminal

Add the directories where you saved the video and audio files.

Or if you want something more similar to the built in player you could 
try vlc - it's also in the rpmfusion repo.

Hi Baskar,

If there are no other volunteers,  I wouldn't mind taking care of
organising things.  I've attended only the last 3 meets,  but my friends
and I plan to attend and deliver a talk every meeting from now on.

If there are other volunteers who have been active for longer, then it
should probably be them,  but otherwise, please let me know.

Also it would be useful if you could provide a list of responsibilities.

Thanks,
Sahas

Hi,

Some of us proposed to democratically elect a volunteer and a name was
proposed and it was some how not materialized even when a youngster came
forward.
I would like to reiterate the mechanism and allow a candidate to be
democratically elected.

I know the strength is feeble as far as monthly meet is concerned. I
request you to consider an incubation period of 6 months and we can do a
membership drive and conduct an election, select a co-ordinator and groom
him/her. Till such time some one can shoulder the responsibility of being
the 'co-ordinator'.

regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Dear all,

Myself conducted a one day FDP on FOSS in Shrimati Indira Gandhi College,
Trichy on 13/11/2015.  More than 20 faculty members attended the program.

http://www.sigc.edu/

Participants were introduced to various open source tools for conducting
laboratory practicals.  The existing Windows based PCs were replaced with
Ubuntu MATE 15.04.  OpenLDAP+NFS was setup and configured by the faculty
members for authentication / storing of user data.

The college is looking for local technical support persons (preferably
in/around Trichy) who can provide technical support/training.

Interested persons can contact me offlist for more details.

I would like to thank the college management for the opportunity.

In a community, the focus is more on which Free and Open Source
Software (F/OSS) project you are contributing to. The above could have
been written as a "contributor to the LibreOffice project".

It doesn't matter whether one is a President, or Vice-President or CTO
in a company. Everyone is a volunteer here.

Message-ID: <81968383.7709875.1448280596191.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

Hello All,
We are facing an issue with X11 and multiple hardware framebuffer.
In our board we have 2 hardware framebuffers. 
1. /dev/FB0 - used for UI application, X11 is used to update FB0 frame buffer. in our application we are processing pixel information with RGBA format in all GUI windows(EGL 2.0).
2. /dev/FB1 - We are displaying video thorugh gstreamer v4lsink.

Finally in our board(iMx6 - Freescale) IPU process will blend these 2 hardware frame buffers with the concept of local alpha in pixel mode and update the final buffer into display.Scenario is, in GUI we are updating video play controls(except play controls area will be transparent to view the video) and will be updated to FB0 and Video will be updated to FB1.
Issue is in FB0 pixel informations are updated with only RGB and A is neglected.

We want know X11 output can be canfigured with alpha information for each pixel in the final output?May be X11 output is the final output to the display, so not nessary to have the alpha in pixel information? 
Is there any configuration to have the Alpha channel for the pixel information to the final output from X11?

Thanks in Advance!Arunkumar R

Those were not proposals, but a suggestion. Should i not allowed to suggest
here. A candidate was proposed and it was absolutely turned down.
I worked as a foot soldier like you, if you cannot  give me credit atleast
please do not discredit my work.

Hi Shakthi,

You sent the meet invitation last time,  I was wondering if you are
planning to continue? If that's so,  my offer to coordinate on a temporary
or permanent basis is not required.

I noticed that the website has not been updated since June.  I would be
happy to update the website with meeting time and list of talks a couple of
days before the meeting.

Thanks for Volunteering Sahas.

I added you as editor in the website.
It is just a wordpress site.

Feel free to add news about the meetings/events/latest news.

Thanks.

ping response is an ICMP echo reply whereas HTTP error is related to a
web server.  Are you sure you have installed / activated a web server?

Which API? What are you trying to do? Please give some more info.

You can use "-vvvv" option with curl to produce a more verbose output.

Absolutely,  this is the philosophy I impart to my Linux Admin
students.  Sadly, only a few (in my experience) take up the challenge
to make their sys admin life/job easier for themselves.

Ubuntu is a Debian-based distribution, and it uses apt as its package
manager, while RPM-based distributions use rpm.

Why do you want to install rpm in Ubuntu?

For that you would be best served by using the 'apt' package manager.
For instance to update the package lists from the Ubuntu repositories,
you could run 'sudo apt update'. To install a desktop environment, you
can run 'sudo tasksel' and select 'Ubuntu Desktop' iirc to start the
installation of a desktop environment.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Please bottom-post when you reply.

#1 What is your hardware?

#2 What packages do you want to install?

You can try:

  $ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop

As 'tasksel' may not be installed by default, install 'tasksel' before
installing the desktop environment.

$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install tasksel

Hi Shakthi,

Appreciate your response.

I used the following command to generate the certificate.

sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout
/etc/ssl/apache2.key -out /etc/ssl/apache2.crt


FYI,

I just checked in Ubuntu 12.04 and Ubuntu 14.04.

I only face issues with *Ubuntu 10.04 and Ubuntu 9.10. *

Hi Shakthi,

Ubuntu 9.10 is not LTS (Ubuntu 10.04 is LTS). Its an old unsupportable
version.

I'm just guessing here but since these distributions are very old, these
errors could be due to the usage of unsupported protocols/ciphers.


That said, these are unsupported releases and even Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
reached EOL some time earlier this year. So you shouldn't be using it.

Thanks & Regards,

Hi Guruprasad,

Thanks for the response.

The objective is to move all the SVN repositories from Ubuntu 9.10,Ubuntu
10.04 to Ubuntu 12.04. I am using svnsync command to keep a mirror copy of
the repository in the new server and once the syn over. I will decommission
the Ubuntu 9.10 and Ubuntu 10.04.  I know that I could use svn dump for
moving the repositories but I think svnsync is more suitable for my
environment.

I just found a work around for this solution by syncing over HTTP.

Thank you

Regards,
Jithin K
