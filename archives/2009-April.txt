CPanel is probably what Balachandar is talking about. It is a web-based
administration tool commonly used by web hosts. If he is unable to
obtain CPanel access, there's no point suggesting shell access because
the functionality provided by the latter is a strict superset of the
functionality provided by CPanel so no sane person would allow shell
access and disallow CPanel access (providing it is available).

This is certainly possible, and entirely straightforward. You would
benefit more from reading:

1. How to retrieve information from a MySQL database? (assuming you're
using MySQL)
2. What a BLOB is?

This is also entirely possible. Instead of storing the image in the
database, store it on the filesystem. When it is uploaded, change its
name to a combination of the filename provided and the time (or hash
thereof). Again, all of this is fairly straightforward, so you should
just look at your textbooks and documentation on-line? carefully.

and my point is that without shell access, maintaining/repairing/rescuing a 
secure wiki and mysql db is not possible. And cpanel is not free software 
anyway.

Dear All,

Lynus Academy is now Authosrised Training Partner for LPI, We are the first
training partner in India. LPI Certification Training will starts from
APRIL 3rd Week.

What is LPI ? - www.lpi.org

Why LPI ?

LPI is an internationally recognized, vendor independent organization
advocating and assisting the professional use of Linux, Open Source and
free
software, and actively promoting distribution-neutral certification of
Linux professionals, globally. Established as a non-profit organization in
1999, LPI is community based and supported. 

LPI?s certification program is delivered worldwide in seven languages. It
has delivered over 70,000 Level One and Level Two certification exams,
globally, since the program?s inception.

LPI supports affiliates worldwide, including United States, Canada, Brazil,
Bulgaria, Jamaica, Japan, Germany, Australia, China, France, the UK and
South Africa.

Relevance: LPI certifies for the technical skills required for a
well-defined type of job. This is based on a survey among hundreds of 
experienced professionals working in a relevant function, defining the
tasks and skills they actually need for their job.

Quality: The LPI certification exams go through an extensive validation
process, following psychometric standards. This checks their consistency
and the power of the test items to discriminate between competent and
not-yet-competent individuals, and sets the pass|fail cut score at an
optimal value.

Neutrality: LPI is a non-profit organization involved only with setting
standards for professional certification. It is independent of vendors of
Linux distributions, training, etc. For LPI, certification is not a
marketing tool to push product.

Supported: LPI serves Linux professionals and the organizations that
contract them. We have attracted wide support from stakeholders in the
Linux world, as shown by our Advisory Council and sponsors.

Is your audio card configured? If it is, look at Preferences. There
might be some option where you choose your audio device.
Also, try running avidemux as root. At times, some distros
(I doubt if Ubuntu would), disable people not in the "audio" group
from using audio devices

apt-get install postfix (or) yum install postfix (or) urpmi install postfix (or) 
emerge postfix (depends on which distro you are using)

qmail is not free software and sendmail is a dinasaur

hi,

there has been some discussion on the hosting of the lug wiki and it appears 
that it is on some very low end platform. Surely we have the resources to have 
- at the least - a vps, or preferably a dedicated server? Why should we be 
struggling like this? A dedicated server - cheapest - costs around 50 Euros a 
month and will give us full root access, 300 gb of space, unlimited bandwidth 
etc etc. I am sure we can raise the funds to get a server for the next 3 years 
within 24 hours. Why do we not do this? We are the second oldest LUG in India 
and easily the biggest. Why are we suffering like this?

Not so sure if people will loosen their purse strings so easily.

I'm all ready for updating the website, server hardware, etc.

I would also suggest that we:

1. try shared hosting -- it's very cheap (Rs 5000 per year), or
2. donate a new server to IIT-M so it can be used by the LUG

what kind of shared hosting? We need shell access as a minimum and even 
webfaction is about 20 USD a month

IITM has a miserable 64 mbps line - it sucks bigtime

The issue is not the money or space or CPU power. Maintenance is the 
issue. Now Bala is revamping the site. Once it is ready, it will be 
controlled for less maintenance.

Already Raja and Mugunth offered a free space for 3 to 5 years.

I was also of similar impression until this happened.

http://ubuntu-in.info/wiki/index.php/Sponsors <-- And we still have
people who are ready to contribute. We accepted as little as 100 INR
also into a single bank account.

Collected amount was around 9000 INR or some such and thats good for a
nice VPS server with full control for the whole year. Infact there
could be a spill out of the balance money into the next year as well.

It _is_ possible using CPanel + phpmyadmin. However, you're right about
it not being free software, and about shell access being preferable.

Slicehost offers a pretty good package at $20 pm. Linode offers an even 
better deal:

http://www.slicehost.com/
http://www.linode.com/index.cfm

I have been using slicehost for a number of projects in the last couple 
of years, and I can vouch they're one of the best in business (they were 
bought out by Rackspace recently). I heard pretty good things about 
Linode too. Both of them offer plenty of bandwidth, for ILUGC's use, the 
basic plan on either one should do fine (if it's only a wiki).

Perhaps it's time to create an ILUGC Fund - we  can hold fund-raising 
dinners/events every six months and people can chip in what they can.  I 
know it  brings in all sorts of formalities with bank  accounts, etc., 
but I guess some of you have suggestions as to how to do that properly. 
Or it can be need-based. We can arrange these events whenever a need 
like this arises. It will be a great way to catch up with everybody and 
we can put faces on the new names :).

Hi !

For the providers to survive , they depend on open source virtualisation
techniques to offer virtuals servers.
Then using those virtual machines they offer both Linux and Windows hosting.
I think dedicated servers start from about $50 /month for full root access
and a reasonable CPU and good bandwidth.

Hi !

Can someone explain why we need root access ?
I thought you need a CMS like Drupal , Media wiki , a blog engine like word
press etc. for a community site.
Many providers offer this kind of deal with shared hosting as low as $4 per
month with unlimited bandwidth.

Is there a special need for root access ?

Cheers

I use dreamhost.com for the past 2+ years.  They run debian boxes
and offer shell access.  It's a shared box, and you don't get root, but
you can still compile/install apps in $HOME.

They offer a lot of "unlimited" features -- disk, bandwidth, users,
mysql, etc.  They have millions of users, so their servers are always
heavily loaded, and their uptime is also not all that great.

I don't think it's possible to setup mailman on DH, but for hosting
the website, wiki, etc, they should be a good choice.

For $6 per month, it's hard to find a more feature rich web hosting
anywhere.

what happens if phpmyadmin is unable to access the db? Like if someone has 
cracked it and changed the password? (I know nothing of mysql, so this may be 
a stupid question)

I had a problem with slice host (not their fault), my tataindicom provider 
(VSNL) has blocked the whole IP range they have allotted to their slices. So I 
could not access my server on the move - only could access it from my desktop 
which I rarely use.

Hi,

I have been using opendns as my dns server for a very long time. This last 
week I find that names are not resolving randomly - and at very frequent 
intervals. It could be my tataindicom modem is not behaving well, or could be 
a problem with open dns servers - has anyone else noticed this?

I know of a friend of mine using Tata Indicom connection having
similar problems with DNS resolution both with ISP DNS and open DNS.

Is it this at work:
http://blog.opendns.com/2009/03/30/worried-about-conficker-on-april-1-setting-up-opendns-can-protect-your-network/

[quote]
The latest variant of Conficker is now churning through 50,000 domains
per day in an attempt to thwart blocking attempts. Consider this: at any
given time we have filters that hold well over 1,000,000 domains (when
you combine our phishing and domain tagging filters). 50,000 domains a
day isn?t going to rock the boat.

So here?s our update: OpenDNS will continue to identify the domains, all
50,000, and block them from resolving for all OpenDNS users. This means
even if the virus has penetrated machines on your network, its rendered
useless because it cannot connect back to the botnet. If you want to
disinfect your computer we recommend you check out the tools from our
friends over at Kaspersky Lab.

hi,

after many happy years with subversion, I have now started migrating to 
mercurial. Just about an hours work so far - and it rocks big time. I had been 
wavering between git and mercurial for some time now, but since python is 
shifting to mercurial, it tipped the balance for me.

hello friends
  i have a problem in adding  the suse linux boot entry which was over

 intially i had win xp and then i installed open Suse 11
 the grub was able to configure  windows and suse 11,
 then i installed ubuntu 8.10 while installing , grub  detected only windows


 now i want to add an entry in the Ubuntu bootloader to show Suse 11 in the
boot option

my hard disk partion table is as below

/dev/sda13          16465       17680     9767488+  83  Linux


i tried mounting the suse's /boot partition /dev/sda6
and found this in the 'menu.lst' for the suse grub

    root (hd0,5)

    initrd /initrd-2.6.25.5-1.1-pae

and currently the grub/ of the ubuntu has...

the main reason they gave for not going for git is the perceived unfriendly

I guess Hg being written in Python has also got something to do with it 
:). I've never had to deal with the so called 'unfriendly git 
community', as there's plenty of help online to get hip with git, but I 
have to admit being put off by Linus' talk introductory talk about git 
at Google a while back. But now I realize he's totally right. I'd hate 
to go back to svn now :).

Probably partition ids are modified. Change above line to partition by ids like /dev/sda1 etc.

I think that these guys were upset at the manner in which patches submitted by 
them were treated - the talk was also mentioned. And, yes, being written in 
python means that the python guys can fix things that need to be fixed.

That is because the UUID generated by the openSUSE installer is not 
recognized by the Ubuntu setup.

Replace the string root=UUID-what_ever to root=/dev/sdXY where X and Y 
are the disk and partition numbers respectively.

        I think you should be using root=/dev/sda10 as you have
mentioned in your initial post that the Suse root partition is
/dev/sda10. Please try that.

I was not aware that this was an issue.

In principle, we should not have a problem hosting this service at
IMSc. We could not only provide ssh root access, we could perhaps
even provide physical access! However, since I am out-of-station it
will be until next week that I can confirm this.

your root and resume cannot be the same partition.  resume is typically 
the swap partition.

I feel, host at IMSc is nice option. Hoping a +ve response.

And one point, today our mailing list running @ Aerospace Dept,
IITM. Apart from DPS, we can find few more people in favor of this.
I hope, you also have same kind of comfort @ IMSc.

Before adding entry to ubuntu's menu.lst, just try the following from the ubuntu grub console to get into opensuse 11.0

While being in ubuntu grub menu, press `c' to get to command prompt,

grub>

now type 

grub>kernel (hd0,5)/(press tab twice here to see the kernel and initrd files which is under opensuse 11.0 /boot partition (/dev/sda6) and select)/vmlinuz-2.6.25.5-1.1-pae root=/dev/sda10

your opensuse 11.0 kernel loads successfully here, and now type

grub>initrd (hd0,5)/initrd-2.6.25.5-1.1-pae (here also press tab twice for auto completion)

then, type

grub>boot

to boot into opensuse 11.0 and confirm its booting, then put these entries in ubuntu's menu.lst.

title openSUSE 11.0 - 2.6.25.5-1.1
    root (hd0,5)
    kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.25.5-1.1-pae root=/dev/sda10 resume=/dev/sda8 splash=silent showopts vga=0x317

Subject: [Ilugc] Audio device produces only static in Ubuntu.
Message-ID: <e6b5008a0904022140w7923e877wbdfcaf6fd2697b19@mail.gmail.com>

I connected my headphone and microphone onto my laptop's 3.5 jacks. I
tried to record something. But nothing worked. So i removed it. Since
then, Whenever I try to play any music or video file, the speakers
give out static (which sounds like an Uzi M/C Gun). The music keeps
paying. But static accompanies it. This is the case with all players
from Rythmbox to VLC and mplayer.

But the test sounds played in System->Preferences->Sound is proper.
There is no static. If the driver was corrupt, then static should have
accompanied the test sounds in the sound preferences right? Any idea
what the error could be?

A list hardware command with multimedia as the class gave me the following.

$ lshw -C multimedia

*-multimedia
       description: Audio device
       product: 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller

Anything i can do to rectify it?

 yes baskar , i followed you way...
 but when typer "ker" in the command prompt of the ubuntu (>grub)
 autocomplete of the "kernel" was successful, after that nothing appeared ,
instead i got an error message
"Error 1: Filename must be either an absolute pathname or blocklist"
similarly i tried for "initrd" , i got the same error

so what i did was i type it manually as below
"kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.25.5-1.1-pae root=/dev/sda10 resume=/dev/sda8
splash=silent showopts vga=0x317"
and then added one line using 'o' option
'initrd /initrd-2.6.25.5-1.1-pae'

and was able to boot into open suse 11

I find git vs mercurial to be like emacs vs vi. git has a bunch of tools and
is like a true UNIX app. One thing per binary and that done well. Mercurial
is a single binary that does it all.

One manages Mozilla and the other the Linux kernel. So I feel both will
suit. Much like vi and emacs again ;)

you sound like me ;-) I have been using it for 10-12 years, so cannot adjust 
to anything else although their reception of bug reports is usually fairly 
hostile.

I do not think there will be one command for that - probably a whole batch of 
them, including one written by our luggie to monitor the laptop battery. top 
will give info about memory and df and du about disk usage and partitions. ps 
will tell you about running processes. tailing /var/log/messages while 
plugging in and removing devices will give some info about the devices and 
ifconfig will give info on network devices ...

If running kmail from the terminal isn't giving you the trace, run it
with gdb[1].

$ gdb kmail
....
(gdb) run
.....


When the gdb drops you to a prompt, type 'bt'.. Copy over the trace
and file a bug report. All bug wranglers love stack traces :)
If you really want to help the developers, install the debug packages
for kmail. Will give the exact line where kmail seems to throw up.

to elaborate, I do not see any sense in this analogy. In the first place hg is 
an executable and not a binary. And vi is a TRUE unix app that does ONE thing 
well. (the one thing that it does well is confuse the users, but that is 
besides the point). And as for emacs - I have already made enemies of the php, 
mysql and ubuntu communities here. I do not want to get chandai with REAL 
programmers.

You will have to type 'run' or 'r' at the gdb prompt and run the kmail
program. And try to reproduce the crash. Once you are dropped to the
gdb prompt again get the trace.

Message-ID: <92f9a9560904030255u557dfdc0nf0d17f295e1a556f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm looking for a system to backup my office data -- binary files (mostly
MS Office documents, pdf, etc) spread over a dozen or so Windows desktops.
I have ~5GB of data in total.  Unlike source code, my users rarely modify
existing files in my dataset, and it grows whenever new files are added to it.

I've been planning on setting up a central SVN repository off-site so that
my users can commit their changes daily, and thus do their own backups.
And something like TortiseSVN should ease the end user experience.

I see lots of benefits in using SVN -- multiple file revisions, off-site backup,
reduced bandwidth usage, etc.  But I've never tried svn for large repos
holding binary files.

Has anyone (ab)used their SVN repositories like this and offer any
insights?

Any idea if mercurial or other will work better for my requirement?

TIA,

- Raja

A stack trace is of little use without debug info.

We have customers who use SVN to store iso images. We also have customers
with WC size >40GB, excluding the size of .svn directory. I think, using
earlier Apache releases (>2.2), we can not upload files > 2GB, as per
limitation is concerned. Eventually it is fixed in Apache 2.2 wherein I
think, we can upload upto 8GB. In summary, we've seen SVN users storing
large binary files without any issues.

Thank you!

Please put a [JOB] tag when you post next time and try not to make it 
sound like a sale announcement. Also please post the relevant mail id 
next time - no matter how desperate they are, I don't think the HR

your previous post was a top post. That is, you posted without quoting

rsync is good only for mirroring.  It offers no revision
control.  If someone corrupts local data, the remote side
also gets corrupted.

For those worried about the security of your data when you
send it off-site try rsyncrypto.  Exactly like rsync friendly gzip,
this is rsync friendly crypto.

As long as your users are happy, things are fine.

All the same, version control is not quite the same as backup! In
particular, you will need to backup your subversion server side.

Note that subversion tends to duplicate space usage. I think that git
(and mercurial) avoids this.

What VCS does is that it reduces the need for user backups to have
long storage times: If you can restore your recent VCS data correctly
it already contains all the older files. Anything that creates data
cumulatively has this advantage.

One thing that VCS's tend to fail at is file modification times and
file modes. You need to save those independently.

For example, there is 'etckeeper' which maintains '/etc' using git.

Regards,

Kapil.

I am not being rude. I am not too smart/knowledgeable either. But you claim
to have been a GNU/Linux user for at least 10 years now (say, kmail was the
first app you ever used). Still, you cannot find your way around kmail.

You still keep hopping distros and start doing this
1) criticize the last distro you used
2) glorify the next one
3) Repeat 1..2 for eternity without realizing that you are actually not
getting anywhere.

Ah... And then, hell breaks loose. *kmail crashes*!!!
You still cannot google and find out how you debug stuff. Ok. Maybe that is
what this list is for anyway.

Next, it is git vs mercurial. You tip to mercurial since python uses it.
So... when are you moving to gentoo? Their package manager is in python, you
see! Replace bash by ipython.

And I have one last question. What did you start this thread for? Did you
want to advertise for mercurial? Or was it about starting yet another flame
 war?(I guess most of us here are too sensible for that though)

In short. All these are imho worse than a Tonu/Tara/Sonu/<whatnext?>
Stop policing. Start doing something more useful.

If you just do a search on kenneth in the mailing list 9/10 mails are Dont
Top post. I dont see too many others bothered by small mistakes like these.
If they are, they give their opinion about TOFU along with the reply to the
main message.

Try configuring kmail to fold it away. If it cant, try tying a handkerchief
to the lower end of the monitor. Either way, you cannot see it.

Dear Luggies,

I am proposing an idea , Let me clarify in the first position that i am not
proposing a moderation system, but at the same time, there needs a system
like , when a user post some solutions or tutorial kind of stuff, he/she is
been rewarded with some marks. List admin , decision on reward of the mark
is final. This is some thing i have seen in the www.experts-exchange.com.

To identify the post which seeks an valuation of its content, the subject
line can be tagged with [solution] or  [tutorial]  tag. This will nurture
people to give solutions , ponder them in giving contribution and will
really discourage noise.

Kindly add your thoughts.

regards

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

Ideally such posts should be combined and summarised on the wiki or
some other easily indexable web page. I think that asking people to
wade through a long thread in order to obtain a solution to their
problem is only a _last_ _resort_ solution when no one has taken the
trouble to summarise the solution or write a tutorial.

> ponder them in giving contribution and will really discourage noise.

"One man's noise is another man's music!"

There are ways creating "scoring" systems for your own mail. (At least
mutt has this feature). This is all the moderation that is required
for a mailing list.

Perhaps you want to figure out a way of distributing scoring systems
--- something similar to distributed spam filtering. Would be an
interesting project!

Regards,

Kapil.

+1: It's one of the best designed sites for exchange of programming
knowledge I've seen. Esp. the members above a certain reputation getting
privileges to edit and retag other people's posts - in effect become
moderators.

I am AGAINST anything that has a huge noise - and i dont see a good SNR in
here.  I am least bothered about whether its a top-post, bottom-post or
fsucking-lamp-post.

If the guy has top/bottom posted 'badly', then in most of the cases i do not
even go through it - i might be losing some information, but i do not give
it a damn. I see email etiquettes to be more driven by evolution(and
street-smartness) and not something that you push down one's throat. Am not
sure whether you are a member of 'python-dev' -- but trust me, i have seen
some 'really' bad structuring with brilliant ideas.

In this forum, there are a few authors whose i posts i go through, even
though i do not understand the contents. It is sheer ecstasy to read such
posts for it teaches me loads of things -- Kapil/Shakti are such examples -
i havent met any of these guys, but its nice to read their posts.

Rants : I am not a great proponent/opponent of FOSS, i do not understand the
plethora of licenses and their clauses, i am not a core-developer of any BIG
copyleft project, i have not spoken in any of the conferences, i have not
attended foss.in or anything similar -- in short, i live in my own microcosm
and do stuff that i like, and i hang around in these channels to meet some
smart people, share  and appreciate the humour(which is important) and go up
the value chain along with my fellow-mates.

phew!

Hi !

You guys are talking about social networking concepts . Many forums have
moved from conventional mailing list model to social networking  model for
closer interaction.

And that is what I am attempting at www.cloudversity.com for open source !

Cheers !

this looks like a forum to me. I have noticed that the open source world is 
not to big on forums. Mailing lists and IRC are the main methods of 
communication. The problem with mailing lists is that everyone gets every 
mail, and it requires a fair knowledge of etiquette to make threads 
understandable. Further, as some one said in this list - one mans signal is 
another mans noise.

In a forum one can pick and choose the threads one wants to follow. One can go 
back and edit/delete ones posts. Others could also edit/delete posts. If a 
forum has good membership, a knowledge base can be built up - and maybe a good 
community too. BUT the open source world is too impatient - we want solutions 
_now_. We believe in commit early commit often. We tend to throw out half 
baked ideas and solutions, passionately debate them and move on. We do not 
insist that every post be completely researched, well thought out and complete 
in every detail. We feel that completeness will evolve through discussion and 
experimentation. So a mailing list often looks very 
confused/chaotic/undisciplined. That is the way open source works.

In mailing lists dedicated to a project, there is more focus and a clear line 
between on topic and off topic. This is not true of a generalised mailing list 
like this. There are hundreds of types of people here with very varied 
backgrounds and interests. So obviously there will be a lot of 'noise'. I know 
many people are longing for a good firm admin to keep discipline. I have seen 
lug lists like this - they are all dying or dead.

apt-get install ttf-indic-fonts

Or, for just Tamil, ttf-tamil-fonts.

You should also be able to type using your applications, using
whatever input method is needed (e.g. GNOME and KDE's keyboard layout
settings, SCIM etc.). Let me know if you have further issues.

Nice post, but the original poster has explicitly stated that he
cannot read Tamil fonts. I saw your blog post; it is also in Tamil, so
all the original reader would be able to see is squares.

For the person making the original post, please first install
Tamil. Then, the post makes sense, and is useful in getting Tamil
input working.

I have never been a GNU/Linux user. I have always been a linux user since

I have used redhat (from 4.2) from 1995 to 2003. I got fed up with it in 2003 
when redhat 9 came out. It was terminally b0rked, so I shifted to 
Mandrake/mandriva which I have used from then and still use. I was asked to 
try ubuntu, and put it on my desktop for about 9 months but found it totally 
unusable. Sorry. My current mix - debian lenny for the servers I maintain. 
Mandriva 2009 for my wife and kids and other non IT folk. FC10 for my laptop 
as I need to run mapnik on it. and, on my office desktop, I run Sabayon.

my main focus is to get more Indians to contribute to FOSS. Without a VCS, or 
knowledge of what a VCS is, contribution to FOSS is meaningless. My post on 
mercurial was not flame bait - it was meant to encourage would-be contributors 
to FOSS to learn about DVCS. Believe me, knowledge of things like this are 
part of the door opening to acceptance in GSOC.

Hi !

Yes ! That is the beauty of Linux . Each distro is unique in someway and the
creator must have had a specific purpose in mind !
Debian for severs , Mandriva/Fedora for desktop  etc etc sound logical.

Message-ID: <49D88B44.1070104@email.com>

Hello,

I have a dual boot PC (Windows XP/Kubuntu 8.04) at home.  Unfortunately, 
it stopped powering up last week.  I got a service technician to look at 
it and he said that a motherboard part has failed, but the replacement 
is not readily available.  I am trying to find out the specs for the 
replacement part to see if I can locate it.

Meanwhile, if I am unable to find the part, I will need to get a 
replacement motherboard.  The failed motherboard is a compact form 
factor (Shuttle box motherboard) with an nVidia nForce chipset that 
accepts an AMD Sempron class processor.

I have the memory, CPU, hard disk, power supply, and DVD-RW, from my 
current machine that I can reuse.  I will need a new case and 
motherboard.  The motherboard should support an AMD CPU and have built 
in audio and graphics.

Can you suggest a reputable PC assembler in Chennai that you've worked 
with who will use the parts that I already have, purchase the remaining 
parts, and put everything together?

Thanks.

i doubt imsc has more bandwidth than this. it is 45mbps, btw, not 64. whats 
wrong with the iitm line? folks downloading on campus may have low throughput 
since the line is saturated most of the time. but for folks outside campus 
trying to download, there is plenty of bandwidth available.

	That is Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 to you. As the people who produce
 the distribution, we get to name it. We call our product Debian
 GNU/Linux.If you are using Debian GNU/Linux at all, you are a GNU/Linux
 user.

Hi all,

For last couple of months I have been using Openoffice 3 beta in a
debian lenny box. Last week when I opened the app, I could not see any
font on the application. Though the windows and buttons are all
visible, the fonts are not visible. The application itself looks like
a hanged windows application. I tried reinstalling the latest version,
installed the debian's repository version, but everything gave the
same result. What can I do to get my office suite work again properly?
Working on Google docs is a real pain, please help.

Did you log out and log in once, so that the fonts available to X
could get refreshed? That usually does the job.

There is no clear cut answer.  It depends on your requirements - you 
*must* define your needs and then go look for the solution that meets 
your requirements.

openVZ if you want to run several Linux based VMs.  KVM/Xen if you want 
VMs with other "unmodified" OSs as well.  For a comparison of openVZ 
and Xen see: <http://vpslink.com/compare/openvz-vs-xen-vps-hosting/>

Which kernel version are you using. This was a bug in the kernel (I believe

one for the server, one for the console, unless you run X on the server
itself and use VNC to acccess the consoles of the VMs.

Hi !

I think you are talking about virtualisation as a technology like VDI  or
desktop virtualisation poduct ?

Hi !

I had done a detailed study of various Virtualisation technologies and
compiled a spreadsheet from various sources.

You can see the spread sheet at

 http://cloudversity.com/pg/pages/view/607/

It is a fairly big spreadsheet ! Feel free to download if you need !

Does the whole system freeze or just the X. Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to see if 
you can access tty1 and so.

1. Check SMPS, CPU Fans are running properly
2. Check the system earth connection
3. Monitor the RAM utilization
4. If RAM in two slots, remove one and check

Is it getting hang, during some specific condition, like running some 
application or key sequences etc .. Give more details

I have FC10 here, and the first choice of mirror is IITM - it has never worked 
as yet. Further, even community colleges in the US have 1-10 Gig of bandwidth. 
I am not blaming IITM for this, but some time back I did a mini survey and 
found the best bandwidth for educational institutions in India was IITK - 102 
mbps.

Did you change  your theme or font settings?
if so, revert back to old theme or font settings.


Here is another solution from
http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10183


Start Oo word processor.
Click on the tools menu (7th from left, 3rd from right in Oo 3.0 )
The last (bottom)option on the tools menu is options.
That will open a dialog box that you won't be able to read but in the
left pane just click down the options until you see
"Options-OpenOffice.org-View" in the dialog title bar.
At this stage you should see several check boxes in the right pane.
Uncheck all of them and then click the ok button at the bottom of the
dialog box.
You won't be able to read it but it is the leftmost of the bottons at
the bottom.
The dialog should close and your menus should be readable now.

Are you using the GNOME desktop?

Create a new user e.g. "guest", login in as guest and see if OOo works 
properly.  

I have had a similar problem where in OOo would not start up at all for 
a particular user BUT would work fine for another user on the same 
system. After much trial/error, I used a LiveCD and removed all the 
GNOME related dirs and the .gvfs directory for the user who had 
problems and then OOo started working fine for that user as well.

since this happens for both lenny and FC10, looks like a compatibility problem 
between the kernel version you are using and your motherboard. I had something 
similar with FC10 and it was solved by compiling the latest kernel - I did not 
do the compilation, so cannot give any further details.

It is particularly the checkox of font antializing. When I enable it,
all the fonts are gone, when I disable it, text is fine.

Ubuntu 8.10 has a newer kernel. Probably the kernel in suse does not
have support for your network driver. Check their website for support
of your network driver or newer kernel which has the support for the
same.

Which suse do you have 11.0 or 11.1 or 11.2 or 11.3?
Ubuntu 8.10 has kernel 2.6.26 , OpenSuse 11.0 has probably 2.6.25

Please run Ubuntu (atleast Live) and try to find out the kernel module 
which is used as a driver for your NIC.

Your network parameters are not set.

Go to to the menu and start up YAST control center.  On the left pane 
click on Network Settings.  On the right pane you will see network 
settings.  Click on network settings and give the parameters for the 
network settings.

As someone else has suggested, the driver for the NIC is not being 
loaded.  From the kernel version in your OP, it looks like you are 
using openSUSE 11.0.  Try openSUSE 11.1, it comes with 2.6.27.19.  
Alternately, if you have the source code for the NIC driver, you can 
compile it and install it.

No. Adobe Photoshop and Pagemaker do not run natively on Linux.

But you can use Photoshop through http://wiki.winehq.org/AdobePhotoshop

Pagemaker... Well... It doesnt run well even using Wine.

But I would suggest you try Scribus instead. It is really good. I did a
magazine
with that once. It is really fast. (Requires a restart on installing fonts
though).
Except for Tamil Fonts (and other unicode letters that need combining
fonts).

Overall, Photoshop (You may also try Gimp or Gimpshop), Inkscape and
Scribus would give you all the tools necessary

 # fc-cache -vf

Or doesn't scribus depend of fontconfig for its fonts?

I think scribus does depend on fontconfig for its fonts. But it does not
dynamically
load the list of fonts every time you use the drop down box. Typically, we
create a
bunch of styles (like Articles, Headings, Subheadings, Quotes...) and assign
a
line spacing, font face and font style to it. Then we can just use the style
wherever
needed.

I do the fc-cache -vf everytime I add a new set of fonts too. But then fonts
are
chosen statically by scribus. In fact when it starts, it has a searching for
fonts
section. Here, it identifies fonts missing in the styles and provides
replacements.

So the restart becomes necessary.

since this happens for both lenny and FC10, looks like a compatibility
problem
between the kernel version you are using and your motherboard. I had
something
similar with FC10 and it was solved by compiling the latest kernel - I did
not
do the compilation, so cannot give any further details.

Or put the link so
<http://blah-blah-domain/path/2/info>

Note the < and >

In Firefox, first visit the link, then do CNTL-L (goes to URL bar), then 
CNTL-C (copy the URL string).

Then in the MUA (assume GUI), CNTL-V (paste the string) and enclose it

Hi !

I am again stuck with  my minimal debian installation.

I want the USB drives to mounted automatically when inserted  in the

How to do this  automounting ?

If I can install  XFCE or LXDE , this is not a big issue . This is a
dedicated embedded system with just 512 mb CF.

Do you have the udev package installed? It should take care of
auto-mouting. You can write udev rules for the same.

Some links:

Not required if you only want to auto-mount.

This is written on the site you mentioned... Did you follow this properly?

sudo ln -s /etc/koha/koha-httpd.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/koha
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2ensite koha
sudo apache2ctl restart

Check if your /etc/hosts reads properly.

Can you "telnet localhost 8080" ?
What does "netstat -nltp" show?

You have not answered the above question.
Have you disabled "proxy" for localhost?  Make sure /etc/hosts 
has "localhost" entry pointing to 127.0.0.1 and /etc/host.conf has an 
entry "order hosts,bind"

grub could not access your ubuntu's /boot partition, Try booting with ubuntu live CD/DVD and
check if your /boot partition was found and normal.

Hi !

Yes ! I have udev installed.
when i do,
#tail -f /var/log/messages

I see the drive being detected .. but not mounted.

Could you please tell where to add the rule to mount the device ?

I see directory /etc/udev  and bunch of files there !

Subject: [Ilugc] [Announcement] Launch of Free Software Movement - Karnataka
Message-ID: <135dba0904070014g12b9fffbpb2daee67bc22bfef@mail.gmail.com>

/* Posting this here as we are next door neighbours ;) */

We, the Free Software Movement Team having been consistently working
to build the Free Software Movement in Karnataka, have decided to
consolidate our efforts by forming an organisation. Our work has been
built on the work of the pioneers of Free Software in the country.

After much deliberation, we have decided to name our organisation the
'Free Software Movement - Karnataka' to symbolise the all inclusiveness
of the Movement. What differentiates us from other groups, organisations
or networks is our approach to building the Movement. Our scientific
understanding is that only a 'mass movement' in the FOSS domain can
bring about the various changes that we envision. To build such a mass
movement, a democratic, transparent, representative and dynamic
organisation is essential.

We understand that to address the various challenges before the
Free Software Movement it is essential to have broad based coordination
among the various entities operating in the FOSS domain, in conformance
with our principles. It should be noted that we are not affiliated to FSF-I
or any other entity, at present. We represent the Free Software Movement.
Prof Eben Moglen and RMS have been our inspiration.

The Convener is Senthil S.(9900262828) <senthilsos@yahoo.com> and
Jt. Convener is Vikram Vincent (9448810822) <vincentvikram@gmail.com>

This core team is supported by a group of academicians, people from the
industry and students from around Karnataka.

We present the 'Free Software Movement - Karnataka (FSMK)'
http://fsmk.org http://fsmk.in

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is a mass movement?

Mass movement : is a word with comes from geology. It is the
geomorphic process by which soil, regolith, and rock move down slope
under the force of gravity.

Mass movement can be over varying timescales from seconds to years.

Mass movement may occur at a very slow rate, particularly in areas that
are very dry or those areas that receive sufficient rainfall such that
vegetation has stabilised the surface.

It may also occur at very high speed, such as in rock slides or landslides.

--------

We aim to be a MASS MOVEMENT in FREE SOFTWARE

We would like to be a group of hacktivists - who can be catalysts in reaching
the idea of free software to a large number of people - including the
people who don't have hardware - by giving them free hardware to start with.

Whether the mass movement in free software in India is going to be
rapid or slow - is going to depend on You Waking up to the philosophy
of free software.

"order hosts,bind"

does not hurt even though it is supposed to be the default.  With it you 
ensure that the resolver first looks at /etc/hosts and goes to bind if 
the fqdn remains unresolved.  "man host.conf" for more info.

Hi,
  I've built a small cluster in my home with my laptop and my desktop.
Sharing my experiences, I've written a post at CEGLUG's website. Check the
following site for the full tutorial on how to build a beowulf cluster in
just 13 steps - http://www.ceglug.org/articles/tutorials/cluster/cluster.php.
I've not included the performance benchmarks of this cluster in the
tutorial. If you're interested in viewing the performance stats of this
cluster, visit my blog - http://blog.ceglug.org/sanath/?p=71. Even though
I've not run any standard SPEC programs, the program which I've run is
enough to demonstrate the proof of concept.

But then, the process should have been started in screen. I started it
directly in a pty and closed that pty.

Is there no way to restart it without reattaching it. Or opening a new pty
which is now of the same number as the closed one and doing something to
attach the process to the new pty.

I don't know about re-attaching, however if all that you want is to run process even after closing shell or logout, you may use nohup.
e.g
$ nohup myprog &
In this case myprog will run even if you log out.

The process has to be started in screen in order to re-attach.

call rsync from a script that restarts it.

You could kill the process and start it again in daemon mode:

# rsync --daemon
or
# rsync -d

You might want to try setting a high value for the --timeout option. I
haven't tried this, though, so good luck.

To 'continue' a previous session, use the --partial option.

Write a shell script that repeats rsync until it exits with a
zero exit code.  See man rsync, "EXIT VALUES" section.

Hi !

Thanks for the inputs !
The auto mounting seems to be working now.

Now the problem is auto -Yanking !

If you yank the usb without unmounting the data is not wriiten !
Is this something to do with caching ? Is there a way to disable this and
write the data immediately in to the drive so that we can yank it any time ?

Thanks for all the inputs once again !

Cheers

Data is not written immediately. It is written asynchronously. You can force
it
to be written to the disk by using the sync call.. This call will exit only
when
all data waiting to be written has been written (This works even when you
have
two or more disks where data remains unwritten)

#sync

Now if you pull the usb drive, data is safe. Anyway. I feel it is better to
unmount.
Unmouting calls sync internally. But then, I guess it does some more stuff
too.

Not really! See the recent discussion on sync, fsync and so on on
LKML or the kernel page of LWN.	For example,
 http://lwn.net/Articles/325420/ says:

 All [sync] does is pre?mpt the normally delayed flushing of dirty blocks by
 expiring them all.  It does *not* write them.  They just go on the
 various disk queues to be written to each device, but that doesn't get
 them there -- yet.  Once upon a time, and on some systems still, there
 was a user process called update(8) that did this sort of thing every 30
 seconds or so.

Then there are "write-caching" disk-controllers etc. ...

To ensure that data gets written to a removable device you should
"umount" it. Then wait for the activity light on the device to go off
(if it is not broken!) before unplugging/remove the device.

Hi !

Happy ending !

I wanted....

automatic directory creation in /media
automatic symlinking
automatic mounting
automatic unmounting (and I will yank it without unmounting anytime after
the lights stop blinking in the USB stick ! This is a necessary condition
for this device)
automatic removal of directory


so added the

automount.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d

KERNEL=="sd[a-z]", NAME="%k", SYMLINK+="usb%m", OPTIONS="last_rule"
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="sd[a-z][0-9]", SYMLINK+="usb%n", NAME="%k"
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="sd[a-z][0-9]", RUN+="/bin/mkdir -p /media/usb%n"
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="sd[a-z][0-9]", RUN+="/bin/mount -t auto -o
rw,noauto,sync,dirsync,noexec,nodev,noatime /dev/%k /media/usb%n",
OPTIONS="last_rule"
ACTION=="remove", KERNEL=="sd[a-z][0-9]", RUN+="/bin/umount -l /media/usb%n"
ACTION=="remove", KERNEL=="sd[a-z][0-9]", RUN+="/bin/rmdir /media/usb%n",
OPTIONS="last_rule"

And works like a charm !

Thanks to ILUGC ! ILUGC rocks !

I did not know about that.  :)
Anyway, my lights on my thumb drive do not switch off even after an
unmount on gnu/linux or solaris. But they do on the Windows machines
at college. Is there a reason why this happens? Or is it that the lights are
controlled by the usb driver?

I think that one needs to worry about write-caching controllers only
for hard disks, but I may be wrong.

About the light staying on for Linux/Solaris. I consider this to be
a bug since the user should get an indication that the device is no
longer in use. I will google^Wcheck whether there is some discussion
on this in the various mailing lists.

I am not sure that this is a correct solution. 

1. The "remove" rule will be applied after the device is removed. How
will the "umount" work in that case? Looks like a recipe for
data-loss!

2. The "udev" rules are (IMHO) not the proper place to implement mount
and unmount rules.

3. One solution is to use automount daemons like
autofs or autofs5 or afuse. This will also auto-unmount after a time
delay (i.e. some period when the drive is unused) which is configurable.

4. Even if you do use "udev" to mount, you need to implement umount
differently. For example, GNOME and KDE require that the user
*requests* the unmounting of the device; you could do the same. 

Regards,

Kapil.

Another solution seems to be "ivman" which seems to work like the
gnome-volume-manager.

Warning: I haven't tested it myself. I prefer to manually use "pmount".

Hi !

Oops ! Noway I could have written that piece of code !

As per shakthi's advice I understood  Udev rules to be made.
After going through the links shathi gave  ,I looked around for some more
and then followed this article.....

And it worked.

http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Udev

I modified a bit to suit my needs !

What about your browser, is it configured to go through a proxy even for

Also check if you are able to login to mysql from console.

$ mysql -u kohaadmin -D koha -p

Subject: [Ilugc] Compiz instability on Ubuntu
Message-ID: <1239130692.6343.8.camel@mjolnir>

Hi everyone,

I have a Dell XPS M1330 with the Nvidia 8400M GS. For a long while now,
I've been running Ubuntu and it's been a pleasant experience. However,
lately I have had this issue where compiz and X.org both decide to hog
the CPU. A few seconds after this begins, the whole machine freezes
(with no response even to SysRq keys) unless I can interrupt by
restarting the computer before that happens.

As you can imagine, this isn't really fun. Any solutions?

Further information:

1. I don't have Flash on this computer.
2. I occasionally boot up a Windows XP virtual machine.
3. The computer reported temperatures of 73 ?C and 48 ?C for the GPU and
the processors respectively the last time this happened.
4. I have a small swap partition, but I rarely ever run out of memory (I
have 3 GB of RAM)
5. The WLAN LED begins flashing on and off right after the computer
freezes. Usually, it only flashes when there is traffic over that
device.
6. I am using 2.6.24-23 x86_64 with Ubuntu 8.04

Thank you for reading,

Read up on basics of MySQL admin or install phpmyadmim.  You will need 
the "root" password for MySQL db though.

Hi !

There are plenty of solutions but for such projects we need more details.

1) Is it a video surveillance or media stored in a PC ?

2) You say "through the web" ! Do you mean to say the video content viewable
from a browser ? This becomes  another issue compared to streaming media
from a server.  You will then need a web server also !

Cheers

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0904081231h55d424bbs6786c7c1b2b4c005@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

I have mounted a windows share in my linux machine.

I have to process the files in the mounted folder and
have to keep the temporary folders in the same folder.

But, i dont want to confuse the windows users with a lot of
temporary files and folders.

So, I want to create files and folders in a samba  mount folder,
with "hidden" attribute.

How to achieve this?

Thanks.

Thanks for your reply

1) Is it a video surveillance or media stored in a PC ?
*    Just media file ( Mpeg,avi,dat,etc)  stored in a server , it should be
delivering streaming audio and video content over the Web using any  media
streaming server.*

*( Its like ,Popular TV news Chennal **delivering streaming audio and video
to thier Viewers and the public** )*
**
2) You say "through the web" ! Do you mean to say the video content viewable
from a browser ? This becomes  another issue compared to streaming media
from a server.  You will then need a web server also !
*Yes i have Apache webserver also Jboss (App server).*

Thanks

Hi Roshan,

I tried the --partial option, and wanted to share what happened so that if
someone else happens to use this option, he does not get confused based on
size of the synced file.

1) rsync -av username@server.com:/path/file* /local/dir/
    //This started of a process of rsync
    //A file by name file.iF80Tt was created in /local/dir/

2) VPN got disconnected and the transfer seized to continue, though the
process was still listed in the ps

3) rsync -av --partial username@server.com:/path/file* /local/dir/
    //This started off another download, because I did not mention the dest
file name.

*) rsync -av --partial username@server.com:/path/file*
/local/dir/file.iF80Tt
   //this did not work because I had used wild card to indicate multiple
files and given single dest file.

4) rsync -av --partial username@server.com:/path/file*
/local/dir/file.iF80Tt
    //This did not start another download, however the size of file.iF80Tt
did not increase either.

5) I killed the 1) process then the 4) process, now when I checked the size
of file.iF80Tt it had actually increased.

So I guess when you use the --partial option, the ls -lh command does not
display updated size. However if you kill the process and check the size, it
would have actually increased.

Ashish

Dear LUGs,
                     I tried IRC chat in Pidgin, x-chat and mibbit (web
based IRC client). Out of three, Pidgin gives better performance when i
using mobile internet.

x-chat hangs 3 to 5 min approximately and to get the talks for screen. This
thing makes me lag of conversation.  I think that the setting should be
changed to avoid this problem.

please help to rectify it. i am using ubuntu 8.10.

The point is that USB is a master/slave protocol, and any
requests/commands (mounting, unmounting) have to be issued on the
master -- the host system, and one shouldn't simply unplug the device
without unmounting it first.

Hi !

But this is a requirement that user will pull out the device any time after
it writes. I understand that it is okay for FAT files system.

I tried it out many times and made sure that the files were written and
could be removed without unmounting because of the "sync" parameter.

Anyway I have no choice and have to live with it. It is an embedded system
with "read only " operating system. You might have seen my earlier post
about auto logging also.  There is no way to unmount the device since there
is no way user can interact with the OS !

Thanks to your suggestions and links.

It is not. Even in Windows, a popup informs you to not remove devices
and wait called "Ssfely remove hardware". Basically, that is equivalent
to flushing out data and unmounting.

Hi !

Yes . I understand . I have no choice. I can only instruct the user to wait
till the lights go off. I have around 50 different makes of compact flash
and usb  thumb drives since my work involves lot of embedded systems- mostly
headless.

I tried with windows - I yank it after the LED stops flickering and give
sufficient time after that. The data is written.

Please understand there is no way to communicate with the system ! I have no
choice - it is an headless embedded system.There is no comfort of
keyboard/mouse/monitor !

If I remove the "sync" parameter in Udev rules , it does not work . But when
I put back the sync parameter , it writes instantly.I do no know about the
kernel stuff so I can  only practically try it out  and seeing it for
myself.  The brand did not make any difference but only the "sync"
parameter.

Actual working is even more complicated . As soon as the USB is inserted it
is automatically mounted and then is mounted with fuse /NFS in a remote
servers also.

As of now it seems to be working well !

Cheers

What filesystem are you using? Have you looked at the mount options? For
example, ext3 has a sync option which performs poorly since all the data
is written in sync instead of buffering it but it is probably worth it
if you can't wait for a buffer flush.

I have only 256 mb Compact flash. So can not afford ext3 jounaling system. I
also found it is a overkill for embedded system. So the OS uses ext2.

I used "auto" and "sync" in the mount options ( please refer to earlier
post)

(RUN+="/bin/mount -t *auto* -o *rw*,noauto,*sync*,dirsync,noexec,
nodev,noatime /dev/%k /media/usb%n", OPTIONS="last_rule")

  So USB sticks with ext2 , ext3 and FAT seem to be working well - provided
you wait till the lights go off ! But we are mostly concerned about FAT .So
we are good now.

That just installs the .so files and some basic commands. However, if
you use

apt-get source libc6

that gets you the source of libc6, and all the gory definitions of all
functions in the standard C library. To get only the documentation,
the manpages-dev package is enough; installing it and doing man
printf, man scanf provides detailed documentation of the functions.

HTH.

Actually, it should be 
  apt-get source glibc
or
  apt-get install glibc-source

However, if you are looking for slightly simpler implementations of
these functions you may want to look at "dietlibc"
  apt-get source dietlibc

A good document which describes many library function with excellent
examples is the info documentation (which is in non-free due to its
use of GFDL):
  apt-get install glibc-doc-reference

That is what I said :)

"apt-get install libc6" installs the .so files and
"apt-get source libc6" fetched the source.

           Linux Performance Monitoring

           Linux performance monitoring historically relied on ported versions   
           of standard Unix tools such as netstat, vmstat, and ps. These local   
           tools take performance snapshots when executed on a system but        
           provide no insights into performance trends, peaks or valleys nor do  
           they offer enough information for predictive or in-depth analysis.    
           System performance is more valuable when viewed over time and in      
           various states of load.

Great stuff.


Here's another project that brings an Open Solaris kernel
to the debian userland.

RTL-8139 (id 10ec:8139 rev 10) is supported by both 8139cp and 8139too modules. Run lsmod and look for the name of module loaded (8139cp or 8139too).

In case if you find 8139cp loaded, then open /etc/modprobe.conf and add the following line to change it to 8139too

alias eth0 8139too

and restart your machine and check your log for any error messages.

HTH :)

Hi

step by step guide on using revisor to customize and create your own
distribution derived from Fedora

http://www.pcplus.co.uk/node/3020

"We're used to thinking of Linux distributions being set in stone.
They're either KDE or Gnome, use a certain kernel and bundle certain
applications. But this doesn't have to be the case. If you find yourself
making the same adjustments each time you install a new distribution,
it's worth creating your own customised version. Revisor is a tool that
lets you do just this, and in this tutorial, we'll show you how..."

Hi All

I have a dual boot box with Pixelview TV tuner card which came with a CD
containing WIndows set up only.
How to make it work in LInux?
I googled and found that it is supported in LInux.
The chipset is Philips SAA7130.
I installed xawtv also from DEbian DVD. But it does not have menu for
tuning stations.
How to do it?
PL give me pointers as to how to go about it.

Thanks in advance

Are you sure? I thought Labview is also for data acquisition not just
data visualisation.

No. LabView != Matlab

And Scilab is definitely not an alternative to LabView and sadly there
is *no* equivalent to LabView in Free Software world.

Hi!

Labview is a totally proprietary software developed by National Instruments
for Data acquisition and control. It has evolved over the past 20 years in
to a development platform for DAS but still remains proprietary. It does not
comply with standards and is not considered as a programming language.
There are have been some developments with regard to some open source
libraries for Labview but they are only add-ons.As mentioned above there is
no one-to-one equivalent.

Labview does run under linux but it is not free.

A bit of googling around gave me a couple of pieces of software. But
as I said before there is *no* equivalent to LabView in the free
software world as such. May be you can try and use the below mentioned
software pieces and give feedback which might be helpful for others
around here too.

Hi, one of my friend just temporary lost all of her data from pendrive
because of virus issue in her windows machine. Those doc+pdf files are
really important to her. We can see all files there in her pendrive but she
cannot open it because of "corrupted" issue. I tried to open those files
with openoffice suite, but .. .there the fonts are gone!!

So, is there any tools to retrieve those data?

That means, when i tries to open those files, the error came "Corrupted
files". Plus, when i tried to upload those files in GoogleDoc, same thing
happens.

Mainly doc files, pdfs are also available there.

I don`t know about the fonts. She worked on those files in windows.

Also if your USB drive is infected with conficker then it can infect other
machines ( windows ) also. Conficker spreads through removable drives. Time
for switch to Linux !

Also this,

http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/pdf/libc.pdf

If you need source, download the tarball.

http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc/glibc-2.9.tar.bz2.

I have a question, is there any way that I can list all the functions
declared in a header? or header files?

Until now, I'm using the below one, but don't know whether this is right
or wrong?

$ grep '^extern' /usr/include/stdio.h
$ find /usr/include/X11 -name '*.h' | xargs grep '^extern'

Do we need to declare all the functions as 'extern'? is this a standard?
 and do we need to define all functions as 'static'? what is the impact
if I don't declare my function as static? on the whole, what is mean by
'namespace'?

Thanks,
Mohan

Hi,

Sadly there is no equivalent open source software. But there are a lot of
open source libraries which work with LabVIEW. LabVIEW does work under a few
commercially supported versions of Linux (OpenSUSE being the only free
exception, with quite a fight in tweaking). But LabVIEW for the Linux
platform is not free.

They do have a very good driver engine (DAQmx) for Linux which is not open
source but is free of charge. You can write C applications under linux to
use their interface cards if that is what you want. I have provided Linux
based embedded solutions with their products.

The company is fiercely propriotery and LabVIEW is protected by a lot of
patents. Starting an open source equivalent might be difficult. But if
anybody is interested I am game.

reagards,
Arun

All the time, windows is throwing the error, right? What is the exact error?

boot livecd and try to open with OpenOffice? what it says? If OpenOffice
works, then your files are safe. Just backup those files, to other drive.

If you use Emacs, you can install cedet [1] and ecb [2], and in the
'methods' window you will get the list of function prototypes whenever
you open a header or source file.

For example:

You can use a better regexp to get all the functions in a header file,
since it isn't needed to declare all the function prototypes as either
'extern' or 'static'. Tools like ctags/cscope would be helpful.

'Namespaces' are purely a C++ thing, and since the standard libc headers can
be included from C++ programs too, appropriate enclosures have to be used to
make the C++ compiler (g++, for example) happy. Namespaces are comparatively
new when compared with the old extern "C" { /* bleh_function_in_C() */ } construct.

I haven`t try with live linux distro. But, i tried with my ubuntu laptop.
But, when i tries to open those doc files, it goes for "ASCII Filter
Options". I selected "Character Set: Unicode" , "Default font: Liberation
Serif" & "Language: English". But, it shows nothing but a couple of signs
there!

Iced Tea is just a fully free derivative of OpenJDK from Red Hat. It
should be just called OpenJDK in the Ubuntu (and Fedora) repository
since both of them have trademark agreements with Sun.

If you want only text out the file, try strings to extract text, it may work

strings corruptedfile > somefile.txt

For pdf you may try pdf to text conversion.

Message-ID: <25be4ce20904122245l473c9821r2377537411ed53eb@mail.gmail.com>

*The BJP?s awkward embrace of Free Software *

**
http://www.hindu.com/2009/04/10/stories/2009041055960900.htm

Deepa Kurup

   *The party?s discovery of the virtues of OS would appear to sit
uncomfortably with its slogan ?Let a hundred Bangalores bloom.? *

  The IT manifesto of the Bharatiya Janata Party has created ripples among
software circles with its support for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS),
and its opposition to ?digital standards.? While the Kerala government has a
policy that makes the use of FOSS in government and education mandatory,
Tamil Nadu has implemented it in a few departments. Left parties have for
long backed the Free Software movement politically. It is surprising that
the BJP, with its strong pro-corporate and pro-patent leanings, should back
this cause.

Even as the Free Software community is celebrating this latest endorsement,
sceptics among its ranks are cautious about taking the BJP?s promises at
face value. Its track record, when in power at the Centre and in the States,
provides grounds for these misgivings.

Consider this. As late as January 2009, the BJP government in Gujarat, led
by Chief Minister Narendra Modi, inked a deal with the global proprietary
software giant Microsoft that includes a Microsoft-developed IT curriculum
for high school students, teacher training, certification programmes, and
offers free Microsoft software development tools to universities.

Less than two months on, the party manifesto in its ?eEducation? section
declares: ?We will actively promote Free and Open Source Software, including
operating systems, which will introduce the habit of innovation
(?tinkering?) among students.? In fact, in 2006 the BJP government in
Rajasthan signed a similar deal with Microsoft under Project Shiksha, and in
2004, the BJP-JD(S) coalition in Karnataka, tied up with proprietary giant
for education and e-governance initiatives.

Prabir Purkayastha of the Delhi Science Forum feels the manifesto reflects
the ?blinkered vision? of the BJP, which has ?never taken an anti-monopoly
stance.? Dr. Purkayastha points out how Free Software circles are abuzz with
an interesting anomaly in L.K. Advani?s speech at the manifesto launch: ?Mr.
Advani referred to how impressed he was on his visit to the Microsoft Office
in the U.S. He did not see the stark contradiction, as he proudly reflected
on the number of Indians present there!?

FOSS activists, however, hope this means increased visibility for their
cause, considering a large number of National E-governance Missions are in
the pipeline, for which Rs. 6000 crore has been earmarked in the 11th Five
Year Plan. The 40-page document also promises to set up an ?IT
standards-setting body,? carving it out of the Bureau of Indian Standards,
and promises all government software will conform to these ?open standards.?


Venkitesh Hariharan, a senior Red Hat official, says: ?It is significant
because so far there hasn?t been any conscious effort towards policy making.
Public data and websites have been in both proprietary and open format.?
Digital standards

 As for their new stance on ?digital standards? ? that is, proprietary
claims on algorithms and software programmes ? the BJP-led National
Democratic Alliance government, notably, was the first to amend the Patent
Act in March 1999 and in June 2002 as part of the WTO agreement under Trade
Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The seemingly innocuous phrase
?software per se,? which the NDA government introduced into section 3(K) of
the Indian Patents Act, was a loophole through which software could be
brought under a patenting regime from a copyright one.

According to Dr. Purkayastha, the amendments had nothing to do with TRIPS
which does not even include software or computer programmes in its ambit. ?A
2004 ordinance provided for patenting of computer programmes used in
combination with hardware. Later, while in the opposition the BJP opposed
the bill ? even though it was virtually drafted by their Commerce Minister
Arun Jaitley. It was presented without any changes,? he says. This was
revoked in 2005 by the United Progressive Alliance under pressure from the
Left.

Corporates such as IT majors Infosys and TCS have long lobbied for patents.
When contacted, a senior spokesperson from Microsoft, a company that will be
hit hardest by an OS regime, told *The Hindu* that the company is
?encouraged by the focus on IT by political parties,? describing the policy
of the Government of India as one of ?technology neutrality.?

The BJP?s discovery of the virtues of OS would appear to sit uncomfortably
with its slogan ?Let a hundred Bangalores bloom.?

Hi !

Open source will survive , grow and be a viable alternative by its own
strength and free market dynamics. So these political manifestos  simply do
not matter.

As an open source community we will look only at the positive side. This  is
creating awareness about FOSS , intense debates and some money is going to
flow to these projects if at all it happens ! It is like rock climbing ! A
toe-hold here and hand-hold there is enough !

Cheers

I've just started using http://areca.sf.net.  It's a multi-platform java
backup app that can do full/incremental/encrypted backups to
ftp/rsync servers.  Portable versions of the app are also available
for easy deployment.

Areca is currently backing up the Windows desktops at my office.
The backups are encrypted and pushed to our off-site Linux server.

Hope this helps to keep your data safe in the future.

I agree... that we in free software community, when we  unite together will
survive..
But dont you think the policy makers must bent down to us and implement the
free softwares which will help us making this community a larger one..
And since we are in the election period, while voting we must be careful of
how these policy makers are really just thinking off..  VOTE BANK POLITICS
or they are really interested in implementing free software which is the WAY
AHEAD...

As an open source community we will look only at the positive side. This  is

Ya i agree with u.. more people know about our community and we grow as
usual... But we shouldnt get satisfy by this i believe... We must ask for
more.. Why not more when they cn give us more... These policy makers
shouldnt make us fools..


Cheers here too

See, this is the bit that bothers me. They've been pro-patent (including
software) for so long, and now a complete U-turn? I do not trust them.
Particularly since they oppose patents when out of power, and support
them when in power.

Frankly, I'd rather not be violating any patents every time I play some
music.

I don't believe this either.
Most political parties do this. They say something just to come to
power, then do something else once they're in power.

Even if an individual were to change his/her ideas all of a sudden,
there'd be lots of criticism.
If a political party (that too a national one) is doing it, frankly, I
can only hope (against hope) that they're gonna do what they say. The
January 2009 incident is indeed testimony to the fact that they
supported proprietary software till then.

Whatever happens, let FOSS benefit in the end. :)


May the source be with you.

I am a bit biased about this but if you cannot edit config files (and
the config files for newer servers are really quite simple, we are
not talking about sendmail.cf here!), then you probably should not be
managing a DNS or mail server.

It does not take more than a week to learn to manage basic (caching,
one domain and one reverse lookup) DNS services and basic mail
services (mail for users listed in /etc/passwd or some other
password list addressed to one domain) from one of the numerous
howto's on www.tldp.org.

If you cannot spend that one week to learn it then whatever you do
will end up being a big headache for someone to come later and clean
up!

> software can be web interface .. please reply back if you know ....

Web interfaces are for forms and the like --- not for managing the
system. To manage the system learn to edit configuration files.

Incorrigibly biased,

Kapil.

IIRC, a while back one of the members in this list got his dns tables 
horribly mangled by webmin.  Maybe newer versions of webmin has fixed 
the bug.

IMO, you should first read the basics of DNS before you start messing 
with it.  About ten years ago, a windows admin asked me for help in 
setting by DNS on a windows server.  He had no clue about the SOA, MX, 
NS, A, PTR records etc. but because he had access to a GUI application 
he thought he could set up DNS!

Like Kapil says, if you know what the heck you are doing then vi/emacs 
is your friend :)  There are plenty of examples floating around 
the 'Net that you can copy shamelessly and modify to suit your needs.  
A good place to start are the localhost.zone and 0.0.127.zone files 
that come bundled with bind package.

Use some hex-editor to check whether the files have anything

Sattish, also make sure you have add following lines within
<Directory>" section to execute cgi scripts.

        AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
        Options ExecCGI

If your perl script extension is not .cgi, change as appropriate. Thank you.

*The BJP?s awkward embrace of Free Software *

**
http://www.hindu.com/2009/04/10/stories/2009041055960900.htm

Deepa Kurup

   *The party?s discovery of the virtues of OS would appear to sit
uncomfortably with its slogan ?Let a hundred Bangalores bloom.? *

  The IT manifesto of the Bharatiya Janata Party has created ripples among
software circles with its support for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS),
and its opposition to ?digital standards.? While the Kerala government has a
policy that makes the use of FOSS in government and education mandatory,
Tamil Nadu has implemented it in a few departments. Left parties have for
long backed the Free Software movement politically. It is surprising that
the BJP, with its strong pro-corporate and pro-patent leanings, should back
this cause.

Even as the Free Software community is celebrating this latest endorsement,
sceptics among its ranks are cautious about taking the BJP?s promises at
face value. Its track record, when in power at the Centre and in the States,
provides grounds for these misgivings.

Consider this. As late as January 2009, the BJP government in Gujarat, led
by Chief Minister Narendra Modi, inked a deal with the global proprietary
software giant Microsoft that includes a Microsoft-developed IT curriculum
for high school students, teacher training, certification programmes, and
offers free Microsoft software development tools to universities.

Less than two months on, the party manifesto in its ?eEducation? section
declares: ?We will actively promote Free and Open Source Software, including
operating systems, which will introduce the habit of innovation
(?tinkering?) among students.? In fact, in 2006 the BJP government in
Rajasthan signed a similar deal with Microsoft under Project Shiksha, and in
2004, the BJP-JD(S) coalition in Karnataka, tied up with proprietary giant
for education and e-governance initiatives.

Prabir Purkayastha of the Delhi Science Forum feels the manifesto reflects
the ?blinkered vision? of the BJP, which has ?never taken an anti-monopoly
stance.? Dr. Purkayastha points out how Free Software circles are abuzz with
an interesting anomaly in L.K. Advani?s speech at the manifesto launch: ?Mr.
Advani referred to how impressed he was on his visit to the Microsoft Office
in the U.S. He did not see the stark contradiction, as he proudly reflected
on the number of Indians present there!?

FOSS activists, however, hope this means increased visibility for their
cause, considering a large number of National E-governance Missions are in
the pipeline, for which Rs. 6000 crore has been earmarked in the 11th Five
Year Plan. The 40-page document also promises to set up an ?IT
standards-setting body,? carving it out of the Bureau of Indian Standards,
and promises all government software will conform to these ?open standards.?


Venkitesh Hariharan, a senior Red Hat official, says: ?It is significant
because so far there hasn?t been any conscious effort towards policy making.
Public data and websites have been in both proprietary and open format.?
Digital standards

 As for their new stance on ?digital standards? ? that is, proprietary
claims on algorithms and software programmes ? the BJP-led National
Democratic Alliance government, notably, was the first to amend the Patent
Act in March 1999 and in June 2002 as part of the WTO agreement under Trade
Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The seemingly innocuous phrase
?software per se,? which the NDA government introduced into section 3(K) of
the Indian Patents Act, was a loophole through which software could be
brought under a patenting regime from a copyright one.

According to Dr. Purkayastha, the amendments had nothing to do with TRIPS
which does not even include software or computer programmes in its ambit. ?A
2004 ordinance provided for patenting of computer programmes used in
combination with hardware. Later, while in the opposition the BJP opposed
the bill ? even though it was virtually drafted by their Commerce Minister
Arun Jaitley. It was presented without any changes,? he says. This was
revoked in 2005 by the United Progressive Alliance under pressure from the
Left.

Corporates such as IT majors Infosys and TCS have long lobbied for patents.
When contacted, a senior spokesperson from Microsoft, a company that will be
hit hardest by an OS regime, told *The Hindu* that the company is
?encouraged by the focus on IT by political parties,? describing the policy
of the Government of India as one of ?technology neutrality.?

The BJP?s discovery of the virtues of OS would appear to sit uncomfortably
with its slogan ?Let a hundred Bangalores bloom.?

Subject: [Ilugc] Making NetworkManager retry a connection at specific
	intervals
Message-ID: <1239819328.6304.6.camel@mjolnir>

Hi everyone,

So I have this computer that's connected to the Internet over wi-fi. Now
the thing is, whenever the power fails, the wi-fi router goes down. The
computer then attempts to connect to my network and fails. This is all
expected so far. However, after it fails to connect to the network, it
attempts again anyway and then pauses for me to enter the key to join my
network. I can guarantee at this point that the wi-fi network it is
connecting to simply does not exist.

The problem with this behaviour is that if there is a power failure, the
computer doesn't reconnect to the network like it should. It just sits
there waiting for me to enter a key. When I cancel the key entry window,
it rescans for networks, finds my network and connects just fine.

I can guarantee that it is not connecting to a neighbour's network or
anything.

How do I ensure that it reconnects to this network only when it comes
back without any human intervention on each event?

All good so far. NM periodically scans to check if the configured AP is
in range, and if so, asks for the key to connect (if in a disconnected state).

"Connects just fine" ? So the AP is up now ?

Ok.
Using your neighbour's network is bad. Very bad. :)

I am not sure if NM has an option to store keys.

But you can use wpa_supplicant and store the key in your config file.
Once wpa_supplicant is started in the background, and if the AP drops out
for some reason, wpa_s periodically issues a scan request to the driver and
automatically reconnects if the AP comes back online again.
No 'human intervention' is required. :)

Ah, I should have said that the key is stored in gnome-keyring and
retrieved automatically usually.

> "Connects just fine" ? So the AP is up now ?

Yes, the router takes a few minutes to start. If NetworkManager attempts
to connect before the router's up it will ask for a key (and will fail
to connect if it's provided at this time, considering that the router
hasn't started). If I cancel this dialog box, though, NetworkManager
will successfully connect _a little later_ (during which the router
manages to come up) using the key in the keyring.

Oh it does. On Ubuntu 8.04 at least, it acts as above.

Hmm, thanks, that certainly seems useful. Does it have some sort of
graphical interface? The thing is, it has to be parent-proof, you
know :) Changing the key in the router is easy, apparently, but editing
a text configuration file isn't.

Hi,

I remember having seen a post by Girish Venkatachalam on this list, where he
gave links to excellent presentations on FOSS advocacy. That was
approximately a year ago. I tried all I could to search for that post but
failed. I 'd be glad if someone could point me to that. I think the

Hi,

In our office we bought new HP machines without DVD Drive with same configurations.
we planned to install Ubuntu 8.04 . with all of our needs, and we can take image of that and Finally we can install remaining PCs by using that image.
I heard that NortonGhost has done sucessfully.
Could you suggest me an OpenSource software for doing this.

It will be very helpful if you suggests how to install Linux for 50 PCs in a day. 
Has somebody got experience in installing 'n' number of? PCs in a single day .

Thanks & Regards

Use clonezilla as an alternate to norton ghost.

Disk cloning is not perfect -- it installs the same hostname,
IP address, ssh keys, /etc/host file, etc.  You'll then have to
change these bits on each machine individually.

The ideal way is to pxe boot and do a automated installation
over the network.  A web search for "ubuntu automated install"
or "unbuntu unattended install" will lead you to:

http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-unattended-ubuntu-network-install

This takes some setup to get it right and you'll need a lot
of patience, but once configured you can rapidly install any
number of machines by simply booting it from the network.

Not sure if NG is any faster than doing it the dd way.  Either way, you 
may have to dedicate a couple of systems /dev/sda is the master 
image, /dev/sd[b-...] are the disks to be cloned.  Boot using a 
LiveCD/USB image and use dd, tar, cpio.

> Could you suggest me an OpenSource software for doing this.

dd if=imagefile of=/dev/sd[ ...]  tar/cpio, Clonezilla.

How many systems are you talking; just 50 or 50*n days?

Assuming the min. i.e. 50 machines, why isn't HP willing to do this 
activity for you? You can give them the master image and they can clone 
that disk on their super fast disk cloning appliances.  In your place I 
would have negotiated with the vendor and awarded the contract to 
whoever was willing to do this for me.

I agree, but it may be too much to ask for, from the SMS generation.  

At work place, their SMS language permeates into their official emails 
and letters inspite of repeatedly pointing it out to them.

Ask your IT support what is the graphics chip set in your system or get 
it from the vendor that supplied you the hardware.

You need to give full hardware information before anyone can help you.

Automated network installation through PXE is much faster than cloning.  Last week,
a Chennai based company requested for installing fedora-10 linux in 60 machines where it took me
less than 2 hrs to install (nearly 1500 packages) in all the 60 machines (The only thing I have done is just set the
PCs to boot through PXE and watching the entire installation process).

If anyone require our pxe installation setup box, pl. contact me offlist, I would be glad to provide this within
Chennai.  Now, it is configured only for Fedora-10 and can be configured for other distros also.

Message-ID: <b89799040904162159u3316f2d8m8d17f457f06f8c3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I want to use lzop on Fedora. The fedora that I have is 64 bit and lzop is a
32 bit binary file which I have to use along with a 64bit tar binary file
(i.e in the same command). Is this something that can be done. What other
possibilities I have.


I tried the following:

Downloaded the source code and tried to install from that. However I got an
configure error at end of the command execution. I searched based on that
error and came across a patch and applied that patch (
http://developer.momonga-linux.org/viewcvs/trunk/pkgs/lzop/lzop-lzo2.patch?revision=6434&view=markup).
I still got the same error.

hi,

I use my laptop with whatever LAN connection is available. At home I have a 
bsnl broadband modem with several ethernet ports - I plug in the ethernet 
cable to my laptop - laptop is set to get IP and other info from DHCP, and it 
works out of the box. In the office LAN, this was working out of the box 
previously. Now ethernet gets detected, but there is no default route - I have 
to manually add the default route to the gateway. Any idea why this should 
happen?

This is happening in F9 too when being installed as VM. Everytime you have
manually set the default route.

yes - FC9 has that issue - but why would FC10 have it for one dhcp server and 
not for another one?

The tool is giving you a hint to set the above variable if the header 
file is in a non standard location.

Check  /etc/sysconfig/networking/devices/ifcfg-eth0 or equivalent to
check if a default gateway is set there. Otherwise you can edit the file
and add it.

Also

Applications -> System Settings -> Network. In the advanced tab, make
sure the connect you want is setup as the default route.

the default gateway is 192.168.2.201 in the office and 192.168.1.1 at home and 
probably something different in every LAN - why should I need to keep changing 
this?

If that connection is setup as the default route, it should be
persistent and automatic. Otherwise there is a issue in the
configuration somewhere or in the software.

Yes its painful, i tried the tip from
http://kutuma.blogspot.com/2007/11/changing-default-gateway-using-network.html
, it worked in my case

$cat /etc/network/if-up.d/gwconfig
#!/bin/sh

if [ "$IFACE" = "wlan0" ]; then
 route delete default gw
 route add default gw 192.168.1.1

Check with your IT staff to see if they have changed anything in the 
DHCP server.  Are you getting other network parameters like DNS servers 
etc. from the DHCP server?

Yes, svnbook is the one stop location to learn SVN. To be more
specific about your request, what you are looking for is path based
authorization to SVN. Please refer to this link for details:
  http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz.html

If you have not configured Apache yet to access SVN over http/https,
take a look at this link:
  http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.serverconfig.httpd.html

Good luck!

Use the Apache + Svn configuration on the server side.  Then you can
configure your clients by simply adding a url
http://server.example.com/svn/path/to/repository.

Set up each project as a separate repository and then create the
"Path-Based Authorization".

The SVN documentation is outstanding.  I suggest you re-read the
documentation.

Warren.

The OP has set his laptop to get all network parameters via DHCP, 
default gw being one of them.

Then there is a problem with the network settings in your laptop _or_ 
there is a bug in the way Fedora 10 is handling your network settings.  
It is strange that it works when you are at home and not at work.

Hi Friends,
               For these kind of installation, can we try to use kickstart?

I think the problem is surely with Xorg.
Try replying with your hardware specs. It'll help greatly.

If your CPU is a Pentium IV (without HyperThreading), there have been
issues reported with 8.10.
Did you try installing 8.04?
Do you get a 30 pixel shift in your monitor login screen?
After logging in, do you get a blank screen or the background wallpaper?

I know one such issue with Ubuntu. Xorg configures the display
resolution as 1280x800 (Device is Generic Monitor) while most monitors
(CRT) can't handle anything more than 1024x768. This not only causes a
30px shift in the screen but sometimes makes the display go blank.

Go to the tty, login and do a 'nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf' and reply with
the output. It'll help greatly too..


May the source be with you.

Hi,

If your motherboard has on-board Intel 845 graphics, you should refer
launchpad bug #285250
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/285250>. There is no way you can get a hardware accelerated desktop on newer versions of X.org. You should just use Ubuntu 8.04 if you want direct rendering.

There are workarounds available in the comments on that bug.

Yes, absolutely. Its one of the main reasons why kickstart exists in the 
first place.

Ideally you would run cobbler to manage the PXE server side of things - 
and it works well to manage per-machine profiles, per distro profies etc 
- and can install RHEL /CentOS/ Fedora/ Ubuntu / Suse* and to some 
extent even Solaris now. It takes about 10 min to setup, so well worth a 
look and comes with a web based UI, should you prefer that sort of a thing.

Is your office DHCP server configured correctly?

The subnet declaration needs a "option routers" block.
My ISC dhcpd.conf file has these lines:

subnet 10.10.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    option routers 10.10.10.1;
    pool { range   10.10.10.100 10.10.10.150; }
}


To debug, you can run tcpdump on your lan interface and watch
the dhcp traffic for anomalies.

Here are the steps:

1. use google -- "linux kickstart howto", "linux kickstart tutorial",
    are good search terms
2. read online documentation
3. try your hand at installing/following the docs
4. if you get stuck, post specific questions to the mailing list

Please note that the same solution can be applied to most problems.

If you can get to 4th Seaward Road (approx. 1.6 km from Thiruvanmiyur
Bus Terminus) between 4.45 PM and 6.30 PM today, you will find an Ubuntu
8.10 i386 CD at the following location:

1. Go straight down 4th Seaward Road until you reach the bend at the
end.
2. Take the right at that bend.
3. Go straight down that road till you get to a junction box on the
right hand side of the street approximately 10 m before the end of the
street.
4. There will be a green car parked near it.
5. Propped up against the right front tire will be a copy of the CD you
seek.

It did, didn't it? :) No one came, though. I returned many hours later
to the spot to see the CD lying helplessly on the road.

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0904171029o676bffcfl5d10283056459ed3@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

I think IITM has a Ubuntu Mirror.

So Is it possible to get the whole repository from IIT Madras in DVDs?

Anoop from zyxware.com is doing this fantastic job.
But it would be easier and quicker to get it from IITM.

As 9.04 is going to be released in next week,
I like to get all the packages in DVDs as soon as possible.

I think IITM friends can help on this.


Thanks.

Have a look at "jigdo":

 http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/

It allows one to build official CD images (bit for bit identical)
by pulling files from any mirror. So it is not really necessary to
download the entire CD/DVD from the main site.

I am not sure whether Ubuntu provides jigdo images.

Kapil.

Kapil,

Ubuntu does provide jigdo files. However, there really is no advantage
to this over just using BitTorrent. Also, you can only recreate the
official images. 

I believe that Shrinivasan wants the entire repository on DVD. If this
is possible from IITM, I'd like to know too.

Yes.

My wish is

To goto IITM in person and burn the repository DVDs
and live a happy life.

Oh, not at all.  It's not the 'form' we're insisting on, but the
'substance'.  When the reader has to ponder over what a word means,
and is forced to make a 'most logical choice' decision, the message is
losing substance-points.  I betcha you wouldn't have taken Einstein
too seriously if he'd gone "lolz, e is lyk the emcee sqr", or so I

In Maildir, they are some additional hidden directories like, .myfolder
.friendliest .atwork. I made an entry of these directories in the file name,
subscribtions.

Any clues???, why i am not getting the mail sub folders listed in the
webmail interface.


cheers

What he has actually done is to remove the name of his company from the
error log he sent you. He has replaced his company name with mydomain but
he made a typo when he replaced one instance (mydomin instead of
mydomain).

At least that is my guess.

Hi,

up to my knowledge, There are two reasons which causes the problem.

1. Not enough disk space. Check your disk space with "$df -h" command.
Clear the all files in /tmp folder with "$cd /tmp , $rm -rf *" commands.
Try to login now. If this is not your problem then try the next solution.

2. The Graphics card resolution value set to high value but it is not supported by your monitor.

you can solve this issue by editing the Display settings file manually.

The Display setting file is "/etc/X11/xorg.conf". If the file does not exist edit "/etc/X11/XF86Config" file.

Example Screen section below. In the section change the hi lighted Modes line only shown below.
 
Section "Screen"
    Driver      "vga2"
    Device      "Generic VGA"
    Monitor     "COMPAQ 5500"
    Subsection "Display"
        Modes       "800x600"
        ViewPort    0 0
    EndSubsection
EndSection

If you log in to the system after changing the line. The resolution will be low.

If this is not solving your problem.

Just copy and paste the below lines at the end of the 'xorg.conf' file. Then try to log in.

precisely, and since we do not have the original error message we do not know 
if it is due to a typo or something else. I have seen this happening time and 
again - obfuscation of error messages defeats the purpose of error messages. 
What is so secret about his company's domain name anyway? Who cares about it?

aha - now we are getting somewhere. 500 is syntax error in the command. The 
command should be:

@Dinesh - why do you insist on top posting even after it being pointed 
out?

Also learn to trim your messages and *delete* unnecessary text like 
footers.  If you are reading Gmail using browser, I believe there is 
a "details" option which will show everything in the message.

I do not think you can do the line above.

For the kind of testing you are doing; google search "smtp commands" 
give a lot of useful links as well.  Pay attention to the syntax.

By the way, any reason for choosing James?  The project's web site says 
IMAP is experimental (i.e. not ready for production).

Any particular reason for not going with postfix/dovecot combination or 
Zimbra that combines the best of class into a full messaging platform?  
They have a huge user base and active communities around them.

Please --------
1. Do Compose>New message or the equivalent in your email client when 
you want to ask a new question.

2. Change the subject line when you reply to a "digest" message.  
Copy/paste the subject line of the message and place it in the subject 
line.  Is that very difficult?

Yes , i am clear about it .

Mr Arun, actually we need mail server , which should satisfy

1. It should have Mysql .
2. Java Client API to send and read the mail.
3. Mail server may support Imap but proffered.

James met above two condition but what is head ache mail sending using
telnet

error i think syntax .

So other then james, do u prefer  any other Email Server ..

As per whether james is suitable for you, I do not know. But as per
the above error, I think you should try:
MAIL FROM: <rhot@voiceicon.org>

If you have referred to your mail log file, you would have got it
yourself. I see following error message in my log file while I tried
the following command using telnet.

MAIL FROM: rhot@voiceicon.org

Error message in log file:

What are you trying to do; write your own email client?  An email client 
should connect to the SMTP (send) POP3/IMAP (read) server using the 
protocols that have been defined respectively.  Assuming that you do 
want write a client, that aspect has nothing to do with James which is 
an integrated SMTP/NNTP/POP3/IMAP server.

Besides learning the SMTP commands and their sequence, what is the 
objective of sending mail via telnet?  IMO, you should first read up on 
the basics of the SMTP command set and then you will get a much better 
idea of how to implement your client.

postfix + dovecot does the job for me.

I assume you are looking to configure HTTP with a self signed
certificate. The following document should let you create a self
signed certificate:
http://www.tc.umn.edu/~brams006/selfsign.html

It also contain links to configure the self signed certificate in
Ubuntu, RedHat and SUSE linux.

Hi  !

I saw many posts recently about mail server , proxy etc. I felt this may be
interesting.

Here is a  IT department in a box  ,

What is eBox?

eBox is a server for the easy administration of corporate networks. It
covers a wide range of functionality from network gateway to communication
center or file management.
It has been conceived and developed with simplicity in mind, lowering the
learning curve for new network administrators and saving time for
experienced professionals.
It helps optimizing time for system administrators by automating most of the
tasks.

Maildir sub folders and folder separators are implemented
differently by dovecot, cyrus, postfix, etc.  Some experimenting
and tuning the config is expected before all folders show up
in your imap client.

Check:

 1. root folder of your imap store as seen by dovecot.
    some imap daemons store sub folders in ~/Maildir/, others like
    to put sub folders in ~/Maildir/INBOX/.  If it's the later, your
    mail client may find all folders as sub folders inside the main
    inbox folder.

2. Ensure folder separator is configured as "."  without this,
    imap daemon will not recognize additional maildir folders
    correctly.

Testing with Thuderbird before moving to webmail is recommended.

You may also want to post what webmail you are using and how the
folders part of your configuration is done.

Hi !

Your question is not very clear. I am not able to make out what you are
trying to accomplish.
Are you looking for free hosted solutions ?
It is really frustrating to see that some complicated questions are posted

This command wont work.
what will happen, if you run this command without inserting blank disk?

you have to use mkisofs to create an iso file and cdrecord to burn the iso.

but ... the OP said the dd command line used to work for him _before_

I do admit that is the first time I have seen dd being used to write

destination may have firewall to prevent ping.

try to ping with local machines and tell the result.

I have created an iso image of a dir. Earlier I had downloaded Debian DVD
images and used the dd command to put them on disk. I am not sure if
something was different then. But will again check.

Check on howtoforge.com. It will have all the required help. That's
besides the postfix website and man pages. You can also visit their
IRC channel for specific help.

Hi Rajesh,

A friend of mine is a system admin himself and suggests:

If it's not reaching it's destination, you will likely find an error
message somewhere. Either from the person you are trying to deliver to
(not likely) or a return message to you. Also, read your mail logs
/var/log/mail and see what you can find in your system log
/var/log/messages. Try sending email as you tail your logs:
tail -f /var/log/messages
And other logs.

Post up your postfix/main.cf so we can see what the setup is like, or
post up the result of:
postconf -n (IIRC).

Be sure you try sending to yourself (get a yahoo email account or
something to test with) so you can verify the problems.

or you can Try this:
=>
telnet <IP> 25
EHLO
MAIL FROM: <from-email>
RCPT TO: <recipient-email>
DATA
Type message here.
. <Enter>
=>

The last line leaves DATA mode.


Hope this helps you out

Best
Priyanka

Subject: [Ilugc] mdadm/raid1 don't see raid sync in /proc/mdstat
Message-ID: <200904212131.30082.knura@yahoo.com>

I had my /home on a LVM but after a few disk failures, I figured I 
should put /home on a RAID1 so I went through the following steps.

1. install another identical size hard disk /dev/sdb
2. create /dev/md0 raid 1 device using one partition 
(/dev/sdb3=/dev/sda3)
3. created LVM on the /dev/md0
4. created ext3 on the LVM.
5. copied over /home from the original LVM (/dev/sda3) 
to /dev/md0vg0/home (the LVM device on /dev/md0)
6. fdisk'd /dev/sda to redefine /dev/sda3 as "fd" device
7. added /dev/sda3 to the /dev/md0 (mdadm /dev/md0 --add /dev/sda3)

So far so good.  However, I don't see any resync between /dev/sdb3 
to /dev/sda3.  Instead, I see sda3[1](S)  what is the meaning of S 
against sda3?  A single U and the lack of a progress bar in mdstat 
indicates something is not quite right.  I have google searched and 
read through the man page for mdadm and I am not sure where I went 
wrong.  

OS: openSUSE 11.1 (x86)
mdadm: mdadm-3.0-10.8

# cat /proc/mdstat
Personalities : [raid1] 
md0 : active raid1 sdb3[0] sda3[1](S)
      89827328 blocks [1/1] [U]
      
unused devices: <none>

What KG meant is, "just detail your problem". By asking your question
in detail, someone who is already using Dspace in Debian might come
forward to help you, rather than you mailing first if some such person
is there, that person responding with a "yes", and then you writing
again etc.

I am not currently behind a proxy, but I have used Maven behind a
proxy in the past. If I recall correctly, this document helped me:
http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html

I hope it works for you too.

                       ^^^^^

You created a RAID1 disk set with a single device,
and therefore ended up adding sda3 as a spare disk
for md0.  S == spare.

Recreate md0 like this:
mdadm --create /dev/md0 -l 1 -n 2 /dev/sdb3 missing

This creates a RAID1 device with 2 disks, but it's created
in *degraded mode*.  Now when add sda3 later, md0
will resync as expected.

Ensure you have backed up your data before playing with
mdadm!!

Not really sure which versions support the grow functionality, Since
this is Open Suse 11, i guess it should be carryign  the latest
versions.

mdadm --grow /dev/md0 --raid-devices=2

this should grow the no of devices in your raid 1 array to 2. Your
spare device will now be added into the array as a active member.

not only that - it may not even be a dspace problem. It may be debian problem. 
The other day someone posted a problem in installing James - but actually the 
error was in smtp syntax and was debugged by people who knew nothing about 
James.

"If I had to select one quality, one personal characteristic that I
regard as being most highly correlated with success, whatever the
field, I would pick the trait of persistence. Determination. The will
to endure to the end, to get knocked down seventy times and get up off
the floor saying. "Here comes number seventy-one!"

@ Raja and Sai Kiran Kanuri - thanks very much for pointing out the faux 
pas on my part yesterday.  This morning after a night's rest I realized 
where I had messed up :(

Yes, I did not understand the "missing" tag in the man page very well 
while reading it last night.


> Recreate md0 like this:

I had already planned to do this today but Sai Kiran's method 
works! (mdadm --grow /dev/md0 --raid-devices=2).  /dev/sda3 is now being 
rebuilt - see below.

# cat /proc/mdstat

Yes!  Thanks for asserting it.  The critical data is backed up on a 
portable hdd.

A general request to _all_ list members, please send your congratulatory 
note to the individuals directly and not _clutter_ this list.  IMO, an 
individualized note to the person(s) has more meaning than expressing

We were discussing this on #opensolaris the day Sun was acquired. The
general feel was that MySQL will actually do better since it is in the
hands of real DB experts. Also, what is GPL will remain GPL. So all they
can do (at their evilest) is to stop contributing to the code. Also,
they might project MySQL as a lighter-small business product and Oracle
DB as an enterprise product and say "If you want more, try the real tried
and tested DB solution -> Oracle DB"

Also OpenOffice, JBoss, Java, Virtualbox, Glassfish and Netbeans are safe.
But again one person stated that Mysql was likely to be jettisoned. The
state of OpenSolaris is unknown, but it was said to have been mentioned
once. Solaris is safe though.

If all fails and MySQL dies, it is time to shift to the more
standards-compliant Postgres.

no - it should come to the list. We are building morale and community here. We 
want a lot more members to get involved next year and this is one way of 
motivating them. Everyone likes to be publicly praised and congratulated.

ok,I read and reread that bit from you - and I dont see any 
rationalisation as to why either Solaris or OpenSolaris are safe with

hi Rajesh..

did you install SASL authentication method with TLS

"Relay Access Denied" error might get becoz you do not have installed SASL
authentication with TLS. you must install that in order to send mails
externally.  But you should be able to send mails withing yo network, if you
configuration is correct...

this link might helpful

Oracle is also doing some FOSS contribution
(http://oss.oracle.com/). So I hope, they won't kill MySQL and they
might use MySQL to serve the SMEs.

NB - no issues with the announcement about so and so made it to GSoC, 
that should be motivation enough for others aspiring to be one.  

If the congratulatory notes is the motivating factor then IMO that is 
the _wrong_ reason for such aspirations.

Its now working, I guess X was just taking time to startup. When I left the
latptop for sometime after startx, it came up in the second console (the
normal message). Do you know the file that controls as to which console
which terminal should comeup. Like now the X is coming in second tty. How
can I make it come in the 7th console and make the second console back to
the messages console.

MySQL has forked:

Now that its gone to Oracle who might not be motivated enough to keep
developing MySQL, we will see more forks. And that means newer ideas - less
weighed down by backward compatibility issues. All for good!

why? Do you mean that the sole motivation for getting into Gsoc should be the 
noble aim of serving humanity? You mean that someone who does it for fame and

Just a general query from my side as well:
Why at least someone hsa a problem with something on "such" mailing lists?
always? Especially if its something, joyous or happy or worth sharing or
celebrating?

GSoC is about students/young people and also to encourage new people to get
into FOSS.
So if a young person made an achievement, why cant others/seniors/elders be
more supportive and congratulate rather than picking noses?
If you think, you have achieved so much in life or can't be supportive or
praiseful to young people there is one way to avoid such issues. Ignore the
mails rather than creating noise.

Just trying to make a general suggestion as well and not offend anyone.
Because "ignorance is bliss" Sure I could have ignored this thread as well,

But trying to support celebrating/sharing someone's success who is young and
new to FOSS and could use some of the praise of others in the community.

I hope it doesn't shut up some of the valid criticisms of the general
lack of contributions in relative terms. GSoC while nice is hardly the
end of the line. We still have a huge problem of retaining students once
the project time period is over. Many of them disappear till the next
year where they might show up in a altogether different project. The
motivation, if purely monetary is not enough to be sustainable.

Well agreed. But there are some, like me, who stick around :-)
Applied to just 1 organisation last year, got selected, Continued
contributing after GSoC till now.
And applied again this year, same, just ONE proposal to one organisation.
And will be working again this Summer.

While, money is a highly attractive factor for driving the influx of
applicants, the program is a win-win if it is able to identify people who
stick around. Sure there are some who apply to multiple projects as well.
But I know some others as well, who stick around to Just one FOSS project
and send-in just one application :-)

The program has various goals, afaik, one of them is to identify new
contributors who stick around.

From:
http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/program/google/gsoc2009/faqs#what_is

*"Google Summer of Code* has several goals:

   - Get more open source code created and released for the benefit of all
   - Inspire young developers to begin participating in open source
   development
   - Help open source projects identify and bring in new developers and
   committers
   - Provide students the opportunity to do work related to their academic
   pursuits during the summer (think "flip bits, not burgers")
   - Give students more exposure to real-world software development
   scenarios (e.g., distributed development, software licensing questions,
   mailing-list etiquette)"

And yes, I know you know all this :-) Just sharing info via this thread for
others as well. ;-)

Just curious. Were you continuing your contributions between the last
summer and this summer where GSoC was not running? Either way, I would
like to hear more about the students experiences.

Shrini, I do not quite understand why you would require full
repositories. I can not imagine anyone on this planet require every
package in a Debian/Ubuntu release. Even if you get one, remember it
will be out-dated in a fortnight.

I recommend you download the latest DVD from one of nearest mirror. It
is 4.2GB in size, should be downloaded in >48hrs.

Okay, maybe I'm just playing the devil's advocate here - do you really 
blame the students for not sticking around? Perhaps they found a better, 
interesting project - there's no rule that they have to dedicate 
themselves to one project. If I was a student, I have time on my side, 
so I'm more likely to 'shop around' for that perfect fit.  And foss 
projects are not very immune to politics either.

Also, retaining open source developers, interestingly, is very much a 
marketing problem - sometimes it needs what you call 'hype' to keep them 
interested and motivated enough to stick around. The really popular open 
source projects have less of a problem retaining developers than others. 
GSoC gives that initial thrust monetary and otherwise, to bring students 
to you - how you keep them, is up to you. Not very much unlike 
customers, I suppose. Sorry for another business analogy.

I suppose a lot of heartbreak and confusion comes from thinking that 
foss is somehow unaffected by monetary/economic considerations - it is 
very much so, and managing an open source project's appeal to developers 
is being able to walk that thin line successfully. Not that I did this 
all myself, but as a Rails developer, I had enough time to analyze the 
craze/hype cycle of technology - just some observations.

Sure but assuming that SoC considers "stickiness" as a major measure of
their success, it is only fair to evaluate it on that regard.

You might be quite surprised, if you ask even the popular projects, what
amount of people have stayed around to contribute after finishing their
obligations and especially how it is different between people from
different countries.

good to know about your observations , so what's your take should they
be recognised publicly or not ?

I for one would want them to be publicly taken on a google bus around
the town to get them on a high and then make them work on project ;-)
, its all about exposure ,  i am happy they will experience the highs
and lows of Life , its all about being exposed to elements and if GSOC
gives that why not let them exploit it , about $ that's a different
topic all together.

Yes. From the last year, I have been working to build an active Sahana
contributor country in India as when I joined in, I didnt find any. I
thought of it as a problem/challenge to work upon and tried to do as much as
I can, and still do. Since there are other FOSS projects which have greater
amount of community involvement and contriubutions from India.
So I can't show you "code" contributions, but I can show you "talk"
contributions and getting the message across to a lot of people and students
who have contributed to Sahana in some way or the other. More to come on
this soon on my blog :-) Will post a link when I am done.

I forget the exact figure, but google's statistics show that the 'stickiness' 
factor is around 30% - and this year there is an active program to judge 
stickiness and review the situation after about six months. Also I have 
noticed more choosiness in picking candidates with an emphasis on choosing 
people who would stick.

Subject: [Ilugc] Build Prototype - Enterprise as a Device Swarm.
Message-ID: <262284.59816.qm@web50910.mail.re2.yahoo.com>


Hello, 

I am newbie to this user group. i got interested in this group after i met the group in chennai trade center for an open group seminar. 

I am not sure this is the right forum, but please tell me if this is not the right forum for this. 

I am interested in developing applications based on a swarm of devices. I.e for example a Warehouse can be either developed using a central model of a database on a Server or we can also develop it using a decentralized with each small computer device with a flash memory representing a Warehouse bin but connected together to form the warehouse process. i believe the second option would lead to systems that are lower in price, accurate, real time and more reliable due to the decentralized way of working. This is just not limited to Warehouse, but can also be applied where there is any business which has distributed assets, like a utility, Health care, a transportation company etc.  

I am interested in forming a group which can pursue this and move it from the current idea on a paper to a prototype and eventually a very successful business if it leads there. if it does not reach a business, we can atleast have the satisfaction that we have attempted something radical. 

People interested can write to me personally or if you need more information i have more information on my blog http://www.servicefurnace.com/ 

I found this group very energetic and enterprising and hopefully we can all work together. 

Regards
Antony

drizzle isnt really a fork, its something to try and hit the market most 
keenly looking at sqlite sort of really-basic db stuff. Its mostly done

Hmm. Do they mean project "stickiness" from a student's perspective or a 
project's perspective? If it's from the former, that feels wrong. GSoC 
should incentivize the project to become more appealing, which is easier 
to do than creating arbitrary rules for selecting students who are 
likely to stick (also lesser chances of bitterness if some student feels 
wronged).

Gentoo seems to have some ideas on how to make them stick: 
http://tinyurl.com/aeyzym. Which is how it should be - if the project 
intends to survive, it will have to come up with ways to attract and 
keep contributors, and even think of ways to make the involvement 
rewarding, financially and otherwise.

By financially, I mean indirect ways of compensation for their time - 
helping them find consulting gigs, etc. (it already happens a lot 
anyways, but I'm thinking foss projects who intend to keep contributors 
should think a lot more on those lines - creating job boards, close ties 
with startups which use their project, etc).

I have received ubuntu 8.04 full repositories in 5 DVDs from zyxware.com
Those 5 DVDs are rocking in kanchipuram where internet is still in a
dream for most people.

The ubuntu in single dvd or cd requires internet even for multimedia.
without net we can not do anything interesting for students and windows people.

But, with these 5 DVDs, people are doing  great things here.
They play multiledia,  play 3D games, work with inkscape, record TV shows etc.

some people start programming too.

All these are done with entire repositories in these 5 DVDs only.


Now 9.04 is released and i want to spread the new one.
zyxware.com takes 2 months to prepare those DVDs.

I thought, if IITM has a ubuntu mirror, we can get from here itself.
no need to wait for a while.

It will take a long time to download the entire repositories from internet.
But, I think, if we go inside IITM, the ubuntu mirror is like local network.
To copy all repositories will take only some hours.

I don't know whom to contact for this.


Any help from IITM friends is welcome.

Dear Srinivasan and members

In the past 3 years, I have been downloading complete Fedora repository starting from Fedora-6
onwards and still maintaining them.  In case, you need Ubuntu Repositories, pl. forward the download URL and I will arrange to get them in about 2 weeks.

I also have Fedora-10 (Install DVD-1, Repository DVD-4, RPMFusion-1).  In case you require them, pl. contact 
me offlist.

But single DVD that Ubuntu comes out with normally should hold good in
most of the cases --> http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/dvd/current/

that being the case recommend Debian and all packages are available in
5 DVDs. --> http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/5.0.1/i386/iso-dvd/

projects perspective. Around 30% of the students last year continued to 
contribute to the project after gsoc was over. I have asked them to look for 
virgins continuing this year, and it has been added in the questionare.

I dont know how those dvds are prepared by zyxware.com.

but here is a how-to.
http://www.howtoforge.com/dvd_images_of_ubuntu_repositories

This is very easier to do.
But will take much time for the person outside.

will take some hours for a person inside IITM as the mirrors are in
local network.

Thanks.

	suggestions reqd
Message-ID: <5526f5a10904250510h2dbca368yc3586bc3a70b93e3@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,


One of my friends who is CA and having around 20 people working for him was
requesting me to suggest him a solution for his problem.

1. He would like to centralise all his documents (needless to say all MS
office files, Images and other data - includes Tally files also)

2. Each user needs to be authenticated and whatever the user stores in the
centralised folder should be accessible by higher ups even when the user is
not in the seat

3. He is not interested in Online Office apps like Google
Docs/Zoho/Thinkfree as he wants an offline solution similar to Google Docs
and he don't want to store them on Internet

4. He would like to pay a reasonable amount and he wants a simple solution
as there are no administrators.

5. Once in a while he would like to connect to this Server thro' internet
also from his residence.

6. If the server offers a central office installation(like Thinkfree Office)
and he will uninstall MS Office in all the local machines use it from the
Server itself.

Request you to suggest the alternatives for the above problem.

PS: I can help my friend to install any Linux based/FOSS based solution for
the first time even it is slightly complex in installation but supporting
him continuously will be difficult for me so request you to suggest
solutions accordingly.

TIA

Or has it not been, Monty Wildenius had started a fork sometime back, he didnt get on well at sun or something...
http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2009/02/time-to-move-on.html

And more on oracle squeezing mysql out, oracle owns innodb the database engine that mysql uses and could use this to effectively stop the mysql growth story...

And also mysql 5.4 is just out, has some really good improvements

Nishant, if you mention the topics you would cover during the

If you want RedHat, but don't want to pay, it's best that you
take a look at CentOS.  It's 100% compatible with RHEL and
is free.

First of all, Please start a new thread for a new post. You had replied in an
unreleated thread.

The best way to "learn" Linux is to work on it and not take shortcuts for
things like printing a file by rebooting to Windows.

If you want to be a developer, my all time favorite collection of tips
(thanks to Shakthi Kannan) is at
http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/gnubie.html

Which software did you install? Most software's executables goes to the
/usr/bin directory. Some larger self contained software go to /opt

It should have appeared in the Applications menu if it was GUI based. Else
Go to the terminal and type the name of the executable. /usr/bin is in the
PATH. So you need not type /usr/bin/<appname>

Also Perl is often cited as the language heavily used in Bioinformatics. I
am not sure about that. But http://docs.rinet.ru/P7/ is a nice book to start
off with perl in that case.

1)Go to the folder where you downloaded the file

cd ~/Downloads or cd ~/Desktop (or just cd if you downloaded to your
home directory)


2) Most of the source packages are tar.gz or tar.bz2

If it is a .gz, do a tar -xzvf <file.tar.gz>
If it is a .bz2, do a tar -xjvf <file.tar.bz2>

3) Then go to the folder just extracted..

cd autodock-<version>

4) Configure/build/install

./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install

5) Execute
Then execute by typing autodock

If you are new user in Linux, then its little bit difficult to install a
software properly from the source . I suggested to use, BioPuppy Linux,
http://biopuppy.org
It comes with lots of Bioinfo tools by default, includes MGL Tools. The
total size of the OS is less than 200 MB. You can also install BioPuppy &
bring all your bioinfo tools, datas, songs,.etc in your USB pen drive.

Excellent also can you see to it that you do not top post and trim the
mail before sending , just curious who is going to conduct the course?
it helps in selling if you mention the faculty name.

Don't understand your question is it for you or someone else anyway in
either case you can google for them but it will lead to lots liks .
This i found not to be optimal way of working especially a new guy
trying to get his feet wet in foss world, the best starting point i
would recommend is to get some form of free software installed gnu,
linux or non linux does not matter  and start checking out the various
call for volunteer links on the software web pages , it will lead you
to the page where in the list of task will be listed choose the one
you think you can work on and start hacking. But again to come to this
point i advise students to submit bug reports in order to understand
the landscape and know who is who before commiting time some project .

About Certifications i think this is one myth students have that
certification helps , yes it helps in getting to the door but then
what , i suggest do your part of karma the rest will fall in place ,
if someone insists on seeing the work cite the urls he will
understand, if he still does not understand he is not worth working
for ;-)

but in real world things are much simpler if you have done some FOSS
work the probability  of getting a day job becomes higher since you
get noticed by many people who are interested in your work and
indirectly in you.

you definition of 'just out' is a bit stange. Most people who use apps 
and software in production tend to only use things once they are 
released. Which 5.4 isnt; its a preview release. And look at the buglist 
against it, there is plenty of work there that needs doing for release.

You can try out sftp. Through sftp you can access any folder, not just a
shared one. And its password protected. Its not like a shared folder
concept, but more of an ftp like concept. Filezilla in windows can use sftp
to connect to your linux machine. Check it out.

You can try out NFS. It is the best option for linux to linux file sharing.

Message-ID: <895495.89610.qm@web33105.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I recently installed ubuntu 9.04 and reformatted my hard drive. I had taken a backup before I attempted this but the restore failed after the installation. 
I had re-allocated partitions of my harddrive and know for a fact that the previous sectors were not overwritten. In fact with a couple of tools, I can see signs of it.


I am currently not using the partitions to ensure that existing blocks are not overwritten and am using OS on another partition.
 
Does anybody know of good tools to recover this data? I am in Hyd, is there a reliable data recovery firm in Hyd and what are the usual charges?

Thanks,
kc

 Please try http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk

and post the details.

If you would like to go with commercial data recovery agency:

you can try http://www.stellarinfo.com/contact.htm

But I would recommend using Test Disk as you might recover it on your own.

Best of Luck

Dear All,

Which companies in Chennai sell the Digium boards and other compatible
Asterisk hardware?  I'm also interested knowing who sells IP phone sets,
particularly those with two ethernet ports with support for PoE.

Many thanks,

Message-ID: <547931.99302.qm@web33104.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

> Please try http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk

Thank you. I did download Testdisk but was not sure whether I should use it. I did use it after you recommended it and it worked like a charm. Its absolutely fantastic. It showed me all previously deleted partitions, the folders and files. It offered to copy them and as I am typing this, it is copying files from the depeted partition to my external harddisk. 

It must have saved me at least Rs. 5k in charges and a lot of headache. I can't praise this software enough.

Mohan suggested Photorec. It is a part of Testdisk download package. I havn't tried it out but will do it today.

For referrence, I will explain how the backups/restore failed -- this should prevent others from making the same mistake.

1. I use the tool 'Simple Backup and restore' in Ubuntu. 
2. I had configured it to store the backup files into an external hard drive.
3. I took a backup (almost a year back) and tested it by restoring from the backup and everything worked fine.
4. I have been backing up regularly at least once a fortnight. I look at the processes to verify and have noticed that the tar and gz processes run as expected.
4. I also took a backup just before formatting.
5. After formatting, when I tried recovering, I realised that the last backup in the hard drive was about 3-4 months back.

So what happened to all the backup files ???? I think I solved the mystery ......Read on to know.

1. My external drive is named "KC" and when mounted is accessible via "/media/KC"
1.1 I configured 'Simple Backup and restore' to backup to "/media/KC".
2. About 3-4 months, back, I clicked on backup without noticing that my external drive was not attached.
2.1 Half way thorough the backup, I realised it, aborted the backup, attached the external drive and started the backup again.
3. The 'Simple Backup and restore' tool did a very stupid thing. When the external drive was not attached, it went ahead an created a directory called "KC" in "/media".
4. So, when I attached the external drive, Ubuntu mounted it to "/media/_KC" - notice the underscore in "_KC".
5. Since 'Simple Backup and restore' was configured to use "/media/KC", it happily backed up everything to my laptop harddrive and not my external drive.
6. When I formatted my harddrive, I lost all backups in "/media/KC".
7. I should have done a simple copy/paste of the important folders from hard disk to external drive but my supreme stupidity made me decide against it and I paid the price.

Please be very careful when taking backups and do try a restore at least once a month. These kind of stupid problems can be easily detected and corrected by doing a test restore to a different PC or distro every month or so. I had Fedora on a separate partition. If I had tried a restore in Fedora, I would have found this error during the restore. (Don't try on the same machine/partition as it will restore perfectly.)

Hope people learn from my mistakes and don't have to face the sinking feeling when I realised that I lost almost 3-4 months of very valuable data.

Thanks again to Ravi and Mohan.

There are a couple of other tools too but will try very hard not to be in another situation where I have to recover from formatted hard drive.

kc

Port 25 is for SMTP traffic. POP3 is port 110. Do you have Dovecot or
any other POP3 server installed ?

Hi !

I installed Ubuntu 9.04  in a separate partition and it is working fine.
But after few updates Audio broke and I am not able to fix it. It also broke
many development platforms I was working on ... which is understandabe sinec
so many libraries were upgraded.

The Ubuntu  8.10 in other partition is working fine and is rock stable. I
use it for work and has XP Virtual machine also. I am glad I did a fresh
install instead of an upgrade.

Has any one had similar problems ? Any fix ?
Sound will simpley not work !

Hi all,

I have successfully recovered quite a bit of data using testdisk. There is one important folder that I am not able to recover. I can see the folder but when I try to navigate into it, it is saying that the file system may have an issue.

The folder contains images and a DB backup. I think Photorec can recover images. Are there any tools which can recognise and recover sql, sqlz files?

It is not due to svn authz/authn issue. The user who owns the
subversion process does not have permission to update the repository.
In case of http, generally the process is owned by www-data. In case
RH flavors it is apache user.  Make sure this user has write
permission to the directory where the repository is located.

Subject: [Ilugc] Avahi: Publishing a service on a different hostname
Message-ID: <1241101877.3609.86.camel@mjolnir>

Hi, everyone,

I have a single computer that serves DNS and which I would also like to
use to publish an Avahi service (the router administration page) on
behalf of my router (which can't do so on its own). That computer seems
to be capable of publishing an Avahi service advertising the web service
running on itself, but when I try the following to publish the router
administration page, I get an error (which I've mentioned below) :

	<?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?>
	<!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">
	<service-group>
		<name>Router Administration</name>
		<service>
			<host-name>router.lan</host-name>
			<type>_http._tcp.</type>
			<port>80</port>
			<txt-record>path=/</txt-record>
		</service>
	</service-group>

The error: 

	Failed to resolve service 'Router Administration' of type '_http._tcp'
in domain 'local': Timeout reached


I have tried adding a <domain-name>.lan</domain-name> to the 'service'
element because it seemed (according to the man page?) that this would
help but then the service is no longer published (or at least, I cannot
see it any more). I use the following command from my laptop to see what
services are published (and also use BonjourFoxy, a Firefox extension):

	avahi-browse-domains -a -t -r

I am told it is possible for me to achieve this by moving mdns to the
end in the nsswitch.conf 'hosts' parameter, but I would prefer to be
able to set this up so that these services are automatically discovered
by any zeroconf-enabled computer that gets on the network.

avahi.service`

Thanks for your time,

IMO, for router and other network devices that ought to be the purview 
of network admins only, the less information you advertise about your 
network nodes, the better.

I agree. However, this is at home and it makes many things convenient
(my parents no longer have to remember the router IP addresses, they
just show up as soon as you hop on the home network). You still need a
password, of course. Anyone with malicious intent would surely try the
obvious 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.0.1 if they did manage to get on the
network so I see it as no additional harm done.

As an interesting complication to the issue, the Bonjour for Windows
libraries and plugins make everything work as it is. It is only on Linux
that the 'Router Administration' service points towards router.local
instead of router.lan. This means that on Windows everything works as
expected, but on Ubuntu it doesn't.

Do you not have DHCP to handle this?

How have you setup your home LAN DNS?  Is there any other zone besides 
the default "localhost.localdomain"?
