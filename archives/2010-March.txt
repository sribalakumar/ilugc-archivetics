hi,

Mr Justice Yatindra Singh of the Allahabad high court is a prominent advocate 
of FOSS. I have listened to him speak and can assure luggies that he is an 
excellent speaker who has done independent research into FOSS and law and is 
well worth listening to. Please attend in  large numbers - you will not regret

Hi sakthi,
   You really did a good job.But your work really starts from now.To run a FOSS
clun and to spread foss awareness you need to plan and execute regular
meets,workshops and many more.For all this you need a gang of peoples who are
all really interested in foss.Gather them and we(ilugc members) will help you
for sure.
   Instead of asking more general question think a while plan yourself and mail
here for further assistance.

This is very critical. Also as I wrote to you earlier, please ensure
that FOSS is seen as being important to all not just CS/IT folks.

Subject: [Ilugc] Bizarre Font Rendering in Firefox on occasion
Message-ID: <1267442095.3865.0.camel@mjolnir>

Hello, folks,

I have some trouble with Firefox that pops up intermittently. Basically
what happens is that font rendering goes all wacky all of a sudden and
I'm not sure where to go to fix it. Unfortunately, Google results seem
to be vague and dealing with other issues and changing the DPI and
hinting settings changes nothing. As a matter of fact, changing font
settings in Gnome seems to have no effect on Firefox at all! However,
Firefox becomes okay when I restart it.

Meanwhile, Epiphany renders everything fine.

Here's a screenshot to show you what I'm talking about:
<http://i.imgur.com/8tBl7.png>. It's possible it is more obvious on LCD
monitors. Anyway, I prefer the fonts on the right to the ones on the
left. This is what text looks like in Firefox after restarting it alone:
<http://i.imgur.com/0EqTC.png>. I want it to look like that always

The websites are: <http://live.gnome.org/Accessibility> and
<http://wiki.tiker.net/PyCuda/ShowCase> but it occurs on others.

Additional information:
1. Firefox 3.0.18 on Ubuntu 9.04
2. Nvidia 8400M GS with proprietary drivers

Any idea?

Hai,

In this auditorium, 120 to 130 persons can occupy. It is a plain big hall.

In my work place we are using a gateway server through which we are accessing the outside world.

Our DSL router is converted to bridge (modem) and my gateway server is acting as a router.

In this case what i have to install either wireless router or access point. And also 20-30 members will be accessing the net.

Kindly guide me which one i have to go for and what brand/model.

hi,
?I am not an expert but i can tell what you can install to get the best.Get two wireless access points , put them on two different extreme channels and configure them in? the bridge mode and connect these AP to a switch which goes to your dsl modem directly.Divide the expected users to use the two channels ..If required go for three access points if you sufferer from serious speed problems.Also try to put the access pionts in the center of the room spaced a few feets from each other.Keep the group updated!

Most commercially available access points do not support bridging mode
between the WAN ethernet port and the wireless subsystem. Bridging
will work across wireless and the LAN ethernet ports only. Load
distribution is difficult (may not matter though given thin WAN
bandwidth). Availability and support might skew your decision to this
solution, nevertheless.

To avoid these, I'd suggest a wifi mesh. Look up www.meraki.com. Last
I knew, they were sold at $50 apiece. Do not have much idea about
local availability of similar systems.

hi,
AFAIK most access points are just plug and play ..they do support bridging they are very much transparent to the LAN on the other side.just con
http://happyrouter.com/how-to-configure-a-cisco-wireless-access-point-ap-from-scratch

There is nothing really hard in trying few configurations.Pls go and ahead have some fun.Go for Cisco AP's they are really user friendly,my opinion.

@Mohan
Even in Mesh the ultimate termination will be your WAN so there is no performance improvement if you are switching for mesh.Mesh are mainly deployed for reliability of links.Here we have only big auditorium so APs will serve the purpose i guess.

Query 1:  SELECT  cid, dl FROM    chal WHERE   cid IN ( SELECT  cid
FROM    c_users WHERE   uid = 636587 );
Query 2:  SELECT  chal.cid AS cid, chal.dl  AS dl FROM    chal,
c_users WHERE   uid = 808 AND    chal.cid = c_users.cid;

cid is primary key in chal cid and uid are indexed in c_users, cid is
not unique;
Which of the above query is better?

Explain says the following
Query 1 uses two types of index namely ALL and index_subquery
Query 2 users two types of index namely ALL and ref
I wonder why both queries say ALL as type of index though cid is
primary key in table chal.

I have posted the same at

Based on my experience, observations are
a.query analyser decides based on statistics of the data distribution.
b.An IN+subquery means in-determinate number as opposed to WHERE. So it may be prudent to do a table  scan than index lookup. That may explain why it uses ALL.
c.Join on two large tables even on indexed field is not efficient. If such queries can be brought to IN+subquery I feel they will perform better.

If chal table is large and c_users small then query 1 should be efficient. If both are large there may not be any difference.

Hi Raman,

Thanks for explaining. Isn't a join supposed to be always better than
IN+subquery?

if the inner query results are less then sub query will outperform the join
query (especially when using IN)

Huh ? Could you please write a bit more clearly about what you are trying to do 
and the problem you are facing ? for example, you could send a link to a 
document that you are trying to follow and then mention precisely where you are 
facing a problem and what is the error message (if any).

 From your message the only things that I could understand are:
a. You are using Ubuntu 9.10
b. There is something called ibus which you are trying to do something with
c. You have copied some code in ~/.bashrc (assuming the double 'h' is a typo)
d. ibus does not start auto (whatever that is supposed to mean)

cheers,

Hi,

While booting I cant see the booting messages continuously, and also when I use console the screen is not scrolling automatically, I can execute only few commands after that I need to clear the screen(ctrl+l).

I am using 2.6.30 Linux, with Debian lenny. I hope it is frame buffer problem.

Since the boot messages are not visible I cant troubleshoot.

Please let know what are the informations need.


Thank you,

Remove the 'quiet' kernel boot parameter, with this you will see all the
boot info.

.bashrc ?? Chuck it.

Go to System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications
Click Add -> Give a name for it. e.g. IBUS -> Type the command "ibus-daemon"
without quotes
Give a comment if you feel like it.
Click Add.

You're done.

Greetings,

I have been tasked with investingating missing mails etc from an
automated mailing.

I have a file with all mail that has passed through a given smtp server.

I am talking about offline log analysis.

I have tried to run anteater and lma against it

http://anteater.sourceforge.net/
http://lma.sourceforge.net

lma runs against that file but does not produce the output as advertised.

the said files cannot be parted with. But whatever further info is
required I will be glad to provide.

The result I am looking for is something like no undeiverd message and
the reason thereof. I am not much interested in size/successful
transmits at this point of time.

If anyone can suggest another way. In the meantime I will be plodding
away at this and if I am successful I will post back my experiences
here

TIA

Regards,

Rajagopal

it is "Since the boot messages are not continuously visible I cant 
troubleshoot"

Sorry for not expressing correctly.

For example After the kernel extracts from 0.000 seconds to 1.000 I can see 
what is going on after that directly it is going to 4.000 seconds so I cant 
see what it is going on after 1.000 and before 4.000

Since I cant see the boot scripts continuously and cant use the console 
properly due to not scrolling automatically I cant get shell even if I pass 
init kernel parameter.

This happens on an embedded processor vortex 86.


Thank you,

It will be easy to figure out the issue, if you can provide the exact kernel
parameters that u use.

It is not a mistake! 'Mistake' is a strong word to use in this
context. Anyways, I was expecting a buildroot version from you.

There is more to learn from the group discussions, other than just
asking questions, or giving answers. This is not just another
technical support group.

It would help if you mentioned what embedded board you are using. If
there is a serial port on the target hardware, you can connect to that
from the host system, open minicom/kermit, and log the kernel boot
messages.

Hi,

Suppose you have the .jar file as   /home/user1/app1/package1.jar,
you can put the following lines at /etc/profile like this:

CLASSPATH=/home/user1/app1/package1.jar
export CLASSPATH

To edit /etc/profile, you should use 'sudo gedit' or 'sudo vi'

I have that checked. Thank you for the links. I'll try applying the
fixes mentioned there. The problem is that it doesn't occur reliably. It
just happens sometimes. Weird, eh?

I just saw this thread. I used to have this problem before and although I never 
could figure out the /exact/ reason, it appeared to be something funky going on 
with pango layouts.

My question as far as reproduction of the problem is concerned is: Are you 
seeing this when you switch different desktop environments ? For me, i saw the 
funky fonts when firefox was the first pango dependent application to start 
(when I used WindowMaker as my primary desktop). For example, if instead I 
launched pidgin/thunderbird/..etc before firefox, the fonts would be just fine.

Let us know your experiences,
cheers,
- steve

Thanks for the help, Steve. On my laptop, Evolution is one of the first
applications to start up when I login and I believe it uses pango. Also,
the issue is particularly insidious because it only shows up after
Firefox has been open for a while and only on some websites. Still,
that's an idea. How can I go about finding out if it is a pango issue?

Message-ID: <5d5dd6aa1003032251u4566adf8t5b3d85ea6bc879bc@mail.gmail.com>

Hello frnds,
                 I installed RHEL 5.0 in samsung R418 model laptop. But the
network card is not detected. The network card is Marvell Yukon 88E8040
PCI-E Fast Ethernet Controller. I downloaded linux driver and copied it in
home folder. When i gave the command #./install.sh, an error generated as
"Permission Denied". So I changed the permission to 755. then I installed
via the same command. After installation, when I used the command,
#system-config-network-tui, I am unable to find the hardware. When I
selected by New method, The hardware is detected and when I gave forward, It
asked whether the IP should be assigned via DHCP or static. Now the issue
arised. Either I give DHCP or assign a static IP. My laptop gets restarted
automatically. When the networking is searched while booting, it again
restarts. I am confused for what to do.

Can anyone please guide me. Thanks in advance.

It is a /reminder/, as the subject says ! Unfortunately, it obviously doesn't 
seem to do much good, as you have very well demonstrated by choosing to totally

Their volumes are low - they buy from the manufacturer and do their
own integration to ensure all devices on the laptops work with the
pre-installed Linux distro that they ship.  That costs time and money.

> what about thinkpad or vaio.

For the most "out of box" support on Linux;  any Intel Centrino family
chipset based laptop will do.  Beware of KVM support though - most
laptop BIOS are b0rked and do not allow loading of KVM modules even
though the CPU may support it.

As for Thinkpad v/s Vaio.   I would lean towards Thinkpad, IIRC some
thinkpad models come with FreeDOS thereby giving you a lower price
point.  Again look for Centrino family chip set.

To the best of my knowledge, Sony has never put a non-Windows Vaio
whereas most of the other manufacturers have; that is a decisive
factor for me.

Another more important issue is about warranty - check with
manufacturer for hardware support if you do install Linux on a system
that came with Windows pre-installed.

You could try hadoop Map Reduce framework. It has a lot of applications and

You seem to have a serious problem with your hardware/drivers and this
cannot be solved by a mailing list.

You should consult some other Guru or get him to come home.

You can buy a cheap 400 rupees USB NIC and get going otherwise.

I too have the same laptop. Got it more than 6 months old.

I've used Fedora 10 to 12, and  the default install was enough. It
detected almost
all the hardware and runs well. I don't think RHEL has any issues with
neither the
Atheros wireless card nor the Marvell card. I'm not sure, I installed
CentOS 5.4
on this laptop, and it works fine.

Hi,
I have fedora 12 installed on my laptop. I had installed youtube-dl  package and downloaded a youtube video from the net.
While shutting down the system, I noticed the rpcbind failed message during shutdown process. It came up twice.

Today morning, when I restarted, I am able to get into windows.
On linux, its taking forever.  I dont see any text console when I do ctrl-alt-f1 or ctrl-alt-f2.

any ideas on what went wrong and how I can recover it.

Message-ID: <20100305065949.619141DB258@www.ae.iitm.ac.in>

Dear All,

In the recent times, we are getting more enquiries from technical institutions to implement open source lab and we also have setup many open source labs in these institutions across Tamilnadu (Now, Polytechnics were also showing more interest in having Open Source labs and we already have setup in 2 Polytechnics running successfully)

Now, LinuXpert Systems has been taking initiative to setup open source labs in about 1500+ Technical Institutions (Polytechnics, Arts & Science Colleges,
Engineering Colleges, Universities) across Tamilnadu (for the first time, the foss lab setup would be done at free of cost).

The main objective behind this initiative is to successfully implement and support for FOSS enabled Technical / Engineering education in Tamilnadu
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 By 2012, all Technical / Engineering Institutions should feel comfortable using / training their students on Free / Open Source Softwares
 To provide complete alternative FOSS solution for every Proprietary Software used in education
 Encouraging students/staffs members to get participated in FOSS development
 Interacting with College/Institution Management for successful implementation of FOSS throughout the institution (not limiting to CSE/IT dept anymore)

In this regard, we are looking for volunteers to support our initiative in setting up of FOSS Labs (preferably freshers, who might be looking for experience in FOSS) and also everyone's feedback.

Regards

S. Baskar

If this initiative is somewhere in and around Mumbai, I and some of my
friends here would be only too happy to help out.

At most the financial outlay may be conveyance.

Kenneth, Last time (couple of minutes ago) I googled Mumbai, It threw
up Maharashtra. Yes I am here in Mumbai Maharashtra PIN codes from
400001-4001xx.

I never knew there was a Mumbai in TN though I was there for a year or so.

And yes I am born and raised in Mumbai Maharashtra, My father came to
Mumbai, Maharashtra in 1935.

That's about my man page.

You can pick on the typos... :)

Rajagopal

PS: I did read the mail properly, and I surmised somebody would take
initiatives in introducing FOSS and fervently hope it becomes a
de-juro else de-facto in this state.

By default MySQL creates only the root account with no password. Use
"mysql -u root". Before that, create a root password using "mysqladmin
-u root password <password_goes_here>"

Then use "mysql -u root -p " to access the service. It is always
better to set a strong root password, even if it is not a production
system.

but why free of cost? you are doing some good work. you should charge for
the consultation. if things are free(not as in freedom), people dont get the
value of it.

but seems to be good initiative. does all these 1500+ have good computer
hardware to support linux? just curious to know. the college i studied
doesnt even have ram beyond 128mb. but it was 2001. it could have changed by
now.

i support your initiative.

LTSP can be the solution, now that LTSP Cluster is available too.

The FOSS Lab Setup is completely a automated process using kickstart method currently based on Fedora-12 and installs about 3500+ packages (almost a complete workstation class installation with Rich Multimedia, Development, Internet, Office, Engineering Applications etc) directly from Fedora main/rpmfusion repository using our FOSS Lab Server Box.

If interested, we can provide the required hardware with complete resources setup for anyone who is willing to setup FOSS labs in your regions.

You can install about 100 machines in just 3 hours, if the Desktop PC has atleast 1 GB of RAM and PXE booting support.  In case of low end configurations, you can setup as a LTSP Server (that's what we did in polytechnics, where they had P-3 with 128 of RAM)

Does it use grub or grub2? If grub, then just edit the line beginning
with 'kernel' to end with 'single' (i.e. add the boot option 'single').
See if it boots into single user. If it does, try 'startx' as root (I
sort of remember something bad occasionally happening if you do this -
like .ICEAuthority getting owned by root but give it a shot anyway).
That should get you started on figuring it out.

command.The output is:
*
[root@localhost bin]# ls
go  gobohide
[root@localhost bin]# ./gobohide -h go

*Then i noticed that i need to patch Linux kernel.So how to patch linux
kernel.And from which directory i have to patch Linux kernel.And this
command is right or wrong

Looks like your modem is stuck to CDMA 1x mode.

On my Windows laptop, I get 3 options:
  1. CDMA 1x
  2. Hybrid
  3. HSD

By default the modem is set to Hybrid mode where it will work at 3.1Mb/s
if the current area has a high speed network infrastructure.  If you are out
of coverage area, the modem will automatically downgrade to CDMA 1x.


If you're modem is stuck on CDMA 1x setting in Linux, then you'll always
get <100kbps regardless of your location.


Not sure how to change the setting in Ubuntu.  The Windows Netconnect
utility provides an easy way to change this setting.  Here's a screenshot:

There is no locking.

Only blocking access to read the folder/file.

chmod u-r foo

will block folder foo from access to user under which this command is run.

If you want to block access to file/folder to everyone other than the user
who created the folder, you can do this.

$ chmod go-rwx foo

Read up on chmod. If you want advanced features then chattr.

If you want to learn about locking you can read flock and lockf but it
has nothing to
do with your question.

Message-ID: <34d63e2b1003081632q5688fd84s7fc6077e9dec40db@mail.gmail.com>

Application: step

What it is:

Step is an interactive physics simulator. It works like this: you
place some bodies on the scene, add some forces such as gravity or
springs, then click "Simulate" and Step shows you how your scene will
evolve according to the laws of physics. You can change every property
of bodies/forces in your experiment (even during simulation) and see
how this will change the outcome of the experiment. With Step you can
not only learn but feel how physics works !

Features:

    *  Classical mechanical simulation in two dimensions
    * Particles, springs with dumping, gravitational and coulomb forces
    * Rigid bodies
    * Collision detection (currently only discrete) and handling
    * Soft (deformable) bodies simulated as user-editable
particles-springs system, sound waves
    * Molecular dynamics (currently using Lennard-Jones potential):
gas and liquid, condensation and evaporation, calculation of
macroscopic quantities and their variances
    * Units conversion and expression calculation: you can enter
something like "(2 days + 3 hours) * 80 km/h" and it will be accepted
as distance value (requires libqalculate)
    * Errors calculation and propagation: you can enter values like
"1.3 ? 0.2" for any property and errors for all dependent properties
will be calculated using statistical formulas
    * Solver error estimation: errors introduced by the solver is
calculated and added to user-entered errors
    * Several different solvers: up to 8th order, explicit and
implicit, with or without adaptive timestep (most of the solvers
require GSL library)
    * Controller tool to easily control properties during simulation
(even with custom keyboard shortcuts)
    * Tools to visualize results: graph, meter, tracer
    * Context information for all objects, integrated wikipedia browser
    * Collection of example experiments, more can be downloaded with KNewStuff2

To install:

sudo apt-get install step

Hi all ,

I have been using Fedora Core 12 for sometime , every now and then X
stops responding and nothing seems to
 work . I need to manually do a reset of the machine to restore it .
When i Check in the /var/log/messages file i see the following error
repeated :

Have anyone faced such a issue using Fedora Core 12 and is it a known bug ?

I wish to know how to correct this issue .

I have 5542 (without the G), the CPU is vanilla Athlon II - no issues
with shutdown but I am using opensuse 11.2 (amd64).

BTW, what is the hardware config of your "G" laptop.

Hi,

I want to integrate the routing application which supports RIPv2,OSPF,BGP in the embedded linux board.

My target is ARM9  with Linux 2.6.32 kernel.

Currently I am exploring the GNU ZEBRA.

Can you please suggest some other opensource applications for routing..

thanks

I would suggest that you evaluate and port some of the existing router
specific linux distro e.g. zeroshell which I am evaluating.

See this for a comprehensive list
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_router_or_firewall_distributions>
for router firewall distributions.

You can retain the routing, firewall features and drop those you are
not interested in.

I have not seen much mention of zebra the last few years.  Most ditros
seem to prefer "quagga"

Any particular reason for selecting zebra as the routing software for
your project?

BTW, what is the board and how many NICs does it come with?

Mr Benedict,

I have a lenovo laptop, and i have been facing the same problem - right from
the day I have installed linux - with dualbooting.

after shutting down the OS, the power LED will be glowing intermittently,
showing that the laptop is still on, but not being used.

I shutdown the laptop physically, by keep pressing the start/stop button on
the laptop, till it shuts down completely.

(I have been telling my collegues that Linux is not a OS that needs to be
shutdown at all - when my collegues tease me about this shutdown problem -
of course most of them uses XP / Vista).

hope this may be a solution to you,

campus of CDAC.

Upcoming Seminars -

March 20th, 2010 (registration closes on March 17th, 2010)

? NLTK - NLTK [Natural Language Processing Toolkit] is a complete Open
Source suite of Python modules, linguistic data and documentation for
research and development in Natural Language Processing. It provides
utilities for many NLP tasks like chunking, stemming and parsing to name a
few. It is a useful tool for students, professionals and researchers
interested in Natural Language Processing and is widely used by NLP
community all over the world.

? GNU Build System - The GNU build system provides an environment to a
computer programmer that helps them make their software/packages portable
across platforms (at least for Unix-like operating systems). It also makes
the build process easier for the user, allowing him/her to use just a small
set of commands to build the software/package from its source code and
install it.

April 17th, 2010 (registration closes on April 14th, 2010)

Bug tracking systems MantisBT and Bugzilla: A bug tracking system is a very
important tool in the software development process. Programmers and quality
assurance people rely on it to keep track of reported bugs in their work. A
database storing the bug data is a vital component of a bug tracking system.
In a more general sense, a bug tracking system can be used as an issue
tracking system to keep track of important issues in any project. Both
MantisBT and Bugzilla are free, open source, web based bug tracking systems.

? MantisBT is written in PHP, uses MySQL/ MSSQL/ PostgreSQL database, and
works with Apache/ IIS webserver. It can be installed on Windows, Linux, Mac
OS and OS/2.
Easy to set up and use, it is very popular.

? Bugzilla is written in Perl, uses MySQL/ PostgreSQL/ Oracle database, and
works with Apache web server. It is recommended to be installed on Linux or
Solaris, but can be installed on Windows (with some efforts). With powerful
features, it is used by many well known open source and proprietary
softwares.

On the horizon

? Eucalyptus

? Hadoop

? Drupal

? SuTra (an Intelligent Suggestive Translation assistance tool , developed
by CDAC)

Zebra went into closed source mode about 6/7 years ago. The fork from
the last open sourced zebra became quagga.

In case you are not stuck to Linux for reasons of expertise/
familiarity/ device support/ licencing etc, look up NetBSD as a
platform. m0n0wall is a good NetBSD based embedded distro to start
from.

Are you building a product or is it a one-off thing? Choice of
platforms, packages etc will change based on that and the amount of
effort one is willing to put in. In case you are looking at building a
product, look at XORP too. Another interesting project that was built
a while ago in MIT was the clickrouter.

I am much impressed with zeroshell interface and features.  But still I want to choose
 the applications and build myself.

There are two advantages for integrating  the applications.
1) we have plenty of choices in the applications
2) we can have full control of the applications and gaining the knowledge of it.
Obviously, the execution time will be more.
Also I spent some time to make the build setup for my target. In this context adding
the application will be easy for me instead of changing altogether.

No specific reason. Just googled and got it. GNU tag gave some confident.
Now I guess I should evaluate quagga only.

>BTW, what is the board and how many NICs does it come with?
Its Kwik KB9202C Board. Comes with 1 NIC card only. For the test purpose
We can make the loopback interfaces.

Thanks for suggestion. I have choosen to integreate the following stuffs
in the target.

For routing applications : XORP or Quagga
Firewall                 : iptables
IPSEC   VPN                     : Strongswan or Openswan or Openvpn
Webserver                       : Apache

The main goal is to implement a proof of concept in IPSEC VPN. So identifying
the IPSEC VPN open source is the challenging job than choosing other applications.
Do you suggest something else other than strongswan/openswan/openvpn?

Thanks

Hi All,

Happy to be in this informative group and getting more knowledge about the
various aspects of open source.

*Query : *

Developing a User Interface using Glade and Python. I have a combobox which
has 1 to 10 values , on selecting the values that passed to a for loop as a
count which generated multiple combo boxes.
*
Example :*

*Combobx1 :  Selected 2*
Generated *2* comboboxes and again I selected *3* in *combobox1* now
generated comboboxes becomes *5*.
Its getting added but i would like to see only the last selected value based
on comboboxes which is *3*.

*Code:*
http://openpaste.org/19806/

Suggest me is this right way of using to generate the widget dynamically or
any other better way of doing.

Enviroment : FC10 , Glade 3 , Python 2.5.

Combo looks good. VPN alternatives are ok. OpenVPN is not IPSec.
However, I prefer OpenVPN as it is more NAT friendly than IPSec. If
you are looking for site-site VPN, this may not matter. If you need to
use IPSec, build it with NAT Traversal. Some ISPs give private network
IPs and NAT it at their end.

I had to do this a while ago on my Ubuntu 9.04 laptop. After I disabled
the splash screen I could see that something was crashing when I shut
the computer down. When I reported the bug with a photograph of the
screen on shutdown, I was told to get a specific kernel version. This
solved the issue. Perhaps you should do so with your own distribution
bug tracker.

Dear Friends,

A grand celebration of FOSS Day (S-FOSS'10) at SASTRA University -
Kumbakonam Campus was held on March 8th, 2010. During these celebration,
many Open Source Related Events and Competitions are conducted. FOSS
Magazine (S-FOSS Community Edition) was released on that day. It was fully
organised by the students(all branches).

Mr.S.Baskar, LinuXpert Systems gave a excellent hands-on training to all
participants. We are very thankful to him for that.

T-Shirts, Caps, DVDs and Certificates are also provided for the
participants.

The total number of participants are around 250. It is a great success to
the S-FOSS Community.

We need more support from other communities also..

I will post more informations and pictures as soon as possible.

On the RBI website there is a page that links to a list of all
NEFT-enabled bank branches in India:
<http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/neft.aspx>. Unfortunately, this is in an
Excel spreadsheet. If you could convince the people who host it to put
it up as an OpenDocument Spreadsheet you'd make my day. The file is 16
MB as XLS and a small fraction of that as an ODS. If you managed that,
it would make my day. I mean, sure, it doesn't bother me at all here at
home where it downloads in less than a minute, but I won't even give it
a shot on my phone.

Good luck,

Is there a speech recognition application available for Linux, similar

Speech recognition is not TTS, it is the other way around. :) The
user's voice over a microphone is converted to text. It works like a
user dictating the application (word processor, etc) to type what
(s)he says instead of using the keyboard.

Message-ID: <1f6793291003112119k46313c8bkc8be6666270a012@mail.gmail.com>

On a different thread I noticed a couple of members who have deployed
vyatta router software.

I have a project wherein the router box has 2 NICs one for LAN and one
for WAN.  I am using Intel DG945GCLF board and it has only one PCI
slot thus only 2 NICs one embedded on the mobo and one in the PCI
slot.

On the WAN interface, there are two subnets coming in on the same pipe
from the service provide.

One subnet is for MPLS VPN and other subnet is for Public IP addresses
(Internet access).

I am planning to terminate the RJ45 cable from the service provider
modem directly into the WAN NIC.

Please confirm if anyone has done IP "alias" using the vyatta router.
I am working with the version vc5.0.2 as well as VC6.0-2010.02.19.beta

TIA

Before adding new comboboxes to the vbox, destroy all the child widgets.
This can be done using

for child in vb.get_children():
    child.destroy()

Yes, there are 3 networks (LAN, VPN, and 'Net) but ...

On the WAN side,  from service provider (SP) - VPN and Internet
traffic comes over the same link.   The media conversion is done by
the SP's modem (located at customer site) to ethernet frames that come
out of *one* RJ45  port.   From what the provider has told me, there
are 2 subnet traffic (VPN and Internet) on the same media fabric.

Therefore, my thinking is to define two IP addresses on the same
physical iface (e.g. eth1 and eth1:0); one for the VPN and one for the
'Net traffic.  On the standard Linux distros this can be done very
easily.

In Vyatta, I have noticed that any system configuration can be done
only through it's "configure" command.

I have posted this query in the Vyatta forum as well.  Will post if I
can find any solution.

If not then I am going ahead with a Debian install :)

If you have control over the client side ISP router, it's better to run
a VLAN trunk between the ISP router and your device. Put the
MPLS subnet on one VLAN interface, and internet on the other
VLAN interface.

You'll end up having 2 VLAN interfaces on your appliance which
you can configure independently as if they were individual NICs.

Problem with IP aliasing is that there is no isolation at L2 between the
MPLS and the internet.  There is the possibility of a data leak between
internet and MPLS.

There is *no* client side ISP router - just a modem for media conversion

This would imply a switch supporting VLAN right?  If yes, the client
does *not* have the infra.

The appliance is an Intel Atom DG945GCLF based nettop with 2 NICs (one
for LAN and one for WAN)
Would appreciate some pointers If you are suggesting to do VLAN in
Linux on the WAN NIC.

This possibility also exists in VLANs does it not?  In my scenario, at
the L2 layer, it is a point to point connection with the service
provider (who is providing both MPLS VPN as well as Internet)

Thanks for your input.

Hi All,

**In my application i would create many textboxes (gtk.Entry) on a click of
a button. Each time i click "Add Textbox" button it will call a function
which has the code to create one text box(gtk.Entry()) and i have a submit
button which should fetches all the values of the text boxes(say 10
textboxes) which has the name of "entry". It works for one textbox but not
for multiple. In php we can create dynamix textboxes mentioning as an array
name=entry[]. Do we have similar functionality in python ?

Enviroment : FC10 , Glade 3 , Python 2.5.

Thanks,

Without a client side router, you can't setup any VLANs.  Any VLAN
config needs to be done at the ISP end as your modem is just an L2 bridge.

Btw, which ISP are you using here?

A switch is not essential, you can use VLAN trunks between your
device and the local router.  But as mentioned, you cannot run VLAN
trunks to a modem, so VLANs do not apply to you and this discussion
is just academic interest.

See vconfig/ifconfig man pages.  There's plenty of docs online, here's one:
http://nixcraft.com/networking-firewalls-security/10447-linux-vlan-configuration.html

Not all NICs support VLAN interfaces, the VLAN tags add 4 bytes to the ethernet
frame so the NIC must support 1512 bytes MTU.  I have the same Intel Atom board
at home and it runs tagged VLANs without any issues, so you'll have no problems.

You're probably right.  In most of my setups, I use 2 different ISPs
when are terminated on a single router, and VLAN trunks created to
the firewall.  The firewall has total control over packets passing between
the ISP and internal interfaces.

After I posted, google'd a bit more and arrived at the same
conclusion.  Thanks for the clarification nonetheless.

Ditto as above.  Looked at above link after google search :)

That is good to know.   VLAN tag does not apply to my specific setup
confirmed by ISP and yourself.   The Atom board is an excellent
platform for small foot print appliance w/o the price tag.   Have you
been able to lay your hands on the DG945GCFL2 (Atom 930)?  It has 2
multi-threaded cores  (4 threads total).    I have been unable to get
any in the Mumbai channels.

Thanks again for your inputs.

That's the same box I have -- Atom 330 dual-core/HT/64bit, 2GB RAM,
2 x 750GB SATA.  It works as my NAS at home.

Board + CPU is available for Rs 4,200 in Chennai, see www.deltapage.com.

You should destroy the old comboboxes before adding the new comboboxes.

This is completely expected, you just overwrote part of your hard-drive,
including the partition table. The good news is that your hardware is
probably fine. The bad news is that recovering data isn't
straightforward, so if you had nothing critical on this laptop, wipe and
reinstall. If you did have something critical on it, then you might want
to try testdisk and its companions.

Good luck,

I get 502 with bitbucket but not with greenchilly. Infact all of the
bitbucket repositories I tried to access are giving 502.

Take it to a laptop repair guy or call vendor tech support if it is
still under warranty.  Either way, remove any memory modules that you
may have added lest they develop their own feet and walk away from
your laptop :(

Consider the omission to spell out the email ID in the body
as your first interview test/question.

It's not so difficult to find out the answer -- see the "from:"
field in your email client.

Also, he should have contacted the OP,  who posted the job opening,
directly and not send his solicitation to this list.  Another faux pas
in his part.

And for a job seeker, asking potential employer to contact him,  shows
a bit of dis-respect IMO.

Oh well,  I have come across such candidates and their emails go to /dev/null :D

<rant continued>
There should be syllabus for How to apply for jobs 101
There should be textbooks
There should be a question bank
There should be blueprint of Q.Paper with choice details so that some portions can be skipped
There should be weekly,cycle,monthly.... tests
All employers are expected to get apllication as given in the syllabus. Any employer expecting differently is not a good/standard company

bitbucket appears to be having some trouble over the weekend. Some time back 
the same thing happened - they were ddosd. Actually they use amazon cloud 
which was at fault - only when bitbucket tweeted about it amazon woke up and 
did something

use scp to transfer file. It uses ssh and hence encrypted and hence safer

Check with your web space provider on how to create/enable an FTP account.
SSL/TLS is preferred over vanilla FTP as the passwords and all transfers are
encrypted.


> Which is

Based on the situation and requirement, I use:
    filezilla client (stand alone FTP client) -- filezilla-project.org
    fireftp (firefox extension) -- fireftp.mozdev.org
    ncftp, ftp (console apps)

Message-ID: <34d63e2b1003150601p4454c560t3cf612bd11324908@mail.gmail.com>

Application: MouseTrap

What it is:

Mousetrap is a standalone GNOME application that allows users with
physical impairments to move a mouse cursor. It uses a webcam to track
the motion of any object visible by the camera and moves the mouse
cursor according to the path of the tracked object (a user's head, for
example). Distributed with software that allows accessible mouse
clicking, MouseTrap will give most physically impaired users access to
the full functionality of a mouse.

Features:

MouseTrap is written in Python, based on the OpenCV library and uses
image processing to translate the user's head movements into mouse
events (movements, clicks) which allow users to interact with the
different desktops managers and applications.

To install:

sudo apt-get install mousetrap

Powered by CentOS sounds a little backward , doesn't it? ;)

Anyway it has become very popular in corporates and it is utter crap.

Anyway now coming to your question FTP is still a very popular
protocol unfortunately.
It also has secure variants - FTP over SSL and FTP over ssh.

For whatever reason my job now requires me to figure out how to
connect to all of them.

And I also have to run an FTP server.


So I can throw some light.

lftp is a great console application with plenty of features for
bandwidth usage to the hilt whichever
way you want. Some ways are not socially acceptable.

It can talk all protocols. So can curl which is another console application.

There are many GUI applications too mentioned by someone else.

Pure-ftpd seems to be the best FTP server. I am going to install it shortly.

In your case I guess your hoster will take care of it.

As to SFTP which is a protocol on top of ssh, it could be slower but
more secure.

scp is another choice which is a great protocol and very powerful too.

Well, you are talking probably from desktop point of view.

Last 5 years my work has involved mainly in the rabbit holes of
datacentre. There RHEL and CentOS rules. The considerations there are
long term stability, Long time support,  certifications (like
application / DB certified to run on a platform).

Show me one version of SAP or Oracle which has certified ubuntu or
fedora as it platform.

Server room OSs don't need to play music/video.

Mission critical Production systems need to _RUN_ in the corporate
world because their revenue stream might be affected adversely if
their availability less than the signed SLA.

Think of this: you are developing an application which is mission
critical for an organisation. From the point of RFP, It will usually
take about 18-24 months for a medium sized project for it to
stabilize. Add to that life (say 5 years) support of that application.
We are talking about 7 years timeline here. Now would you choose a
fedora or ubuntu (not LTS one)? That would be suicidal considering the
support angle.

I convinced one of the vendors of using and developing apps using OSS
to switch from Fedora to CentOS. He could see my point as the app was
already into 3 years of development and testing and he was already
having issues supporting them.

In one of the projects, of which I was part of, relating to revenue
stream of a huge distributed operations, choice of CentOS as
development and testing and vendor supported RHEL/Oracle was a
no-brainer. Over 1500 nodes are involved.

This is not meant to start a flamewar, but just to project some of the
considerations in the commercial world.

So we are talking about different needs and different solutions
fulfilling those needs.

So your "crap" comment may need to be re-thought.

No offence intended, of course.

With Warm Regards

Message-ID: <ed2d3c001003160200vca4ba69i9f7be529a2b99cef@mail.gmail.com>

Hello friends,

I recently connected my laptop with BSNL 3g service.This is not the data
card version which i am talking, a 256k 3g sim provided by  BSNL for Rs.179.
This pack has 25meg data usage free as a promotional offer. I connected the
Mobile phone with laptop installed with Ubuntu 9.10.The speed is impressive
when connect with Nokia Navigator 6110 mobile phone model. It said as 3.5g
as the status. I am not sure, is this facility available throughout tamil
nadu.

I find this is a good buy for a user category like me, since i work from my
home and have a dataone fixed broadband connection which cost approx Rs850 a
month, and buying a Data card my incur me an additional amount of Rs 700.
where i sparingly browse on travel and needless to spend the data card  of
Rs 700/month, i find the prepaid version of BSNL is good as it cost me 1
rupee for 1 meg.

But i am exploring the usage aspect, my Rx bytes showed me 18K and my Tx
byte showed me 10K at the end of the session. I was surprised by a sms
saying that i have used around 34K. I am just wondering how this mismatch is
happening.

I appreciate you guyz to share your experience on this.

Thanks and regards,

You can do this.

This can be done by setting up samba server.

I think , this can be done by setting LDAP.

You can do authentication. But can not have the remote control
over the clients, setting the clients permissions etc.

Hello all

The following is an forward from FSUG Banglore. Interested parties could
contact the person of line.


>>Forwarded Message Starts From Here <<

Contact : renukaprasadb AT gmail.com

we have made some stickers related to free softwares ,
click on this link to see the image
http://bangalore.gnu.org.in/index.php/Image:Fsf-stickers.jpeg

details of the stickers ------
the image was designed with A4 size

the quality of sticker sheet is too good, the printed sheet is of 105 GSM(
another quality is of 50 -60 gsm) and has dual side gum with extra high
quality paste which makes the job of removing stickers a bit hard.

all the logos / images that you are able to see are with edge cutting where
they are just ready to lift smoothly and paste wherever u like ( already the
images are cut to border exactly and pasted on a glossy sheet )

the cost of sticker sheets ------

there are of two qualities :
the one which is  of a bit low in quality (thickness )compared to the high
quality one (105 gsm ) are getting ready by wednesday and i have 50 sheets (
25 are of matty finish and another 25 are  glossy )

i have 100 sheets which are of high quality ( thickness of 105 gsm ) -- ( 50
, matty and 50, glossy)

it costed Rs 45 per sheet  for the low quality ones and Rs 92.5 per sheet
for the high quality sheets

I am selling these sheets at Rs 75 and Rs 150 per sheet ( I am raising funds
for FSF- India , will be giving receipts ) if you are interested to donate
more you could do so..

if you do normal printing in any digital printing centre ( for first A3
sheet print they will charge Rs 30 , and following sheets costs Rs 10,12,14,
depending upon the relationship u have with that company( usualyy it is Rs
14 per A3 sheet, but the sheets that they give will not be of good quality
and also they will not do any edge cutting )

the life of those normal sticker sheets is very less, the printing will fade
of whenever you rub any object over the surface , even a small scratch will
fade the printing

there are so many varieties of qualities available with stickers , we are
also making the doomed stickers which costs Rs 5 per sq inch and stickers of
type "intel inside "( will upload details later )

i approached many kinds of companies ( wih ISO standard ) small enterprises
and individuals and placed order which was most feasible .

those who are interested to buy can contact me (9901945674) , i am staying
at mahalakshmi layout ( near rajajinagar ) , working at R.V .College of
Engineering as lecturer in department of M.C.A

i will pass on the stickers through my students or colleagues if you are
staying at a place where they are put up.. let me know where to send so that
you could collect them if you are interested to buy.

reply with your mobile number and address if you are interested to buy and
want me to send those to your place ( will let you know if some one is put
up there )

also if some one wants to collect few stickers and help in raising funds for
FSF-India, please let me know

collect your sticker sheets as early as possible

cheers

renuka prasad

Yes, this can be done by configuring Samba server to do "ldapsam"

I am not sure what you mean by this; if you are alluding to ACLs to
resources then one needs to integrate Kerberos.   LDAP+Kerberos can
give you single sign on (SSO).  Of course it will not be the same as
MS-ADS since MS has added prop. extensions to LDAP+Kerberos.

Looks like faulty RAM.

Run memtests86+ on your server and look for errors.

Better yet, uses the IBM diagnostics utility CD which can check
your entire system for hard/soft errors.

Best solution, log a call with IBM tech support and get your
system integrator to do the dirty work!

Probably the Tx and Rx bytes do not take into account the ACK traffic
that is part of every download
or upload. Hence the difference.

Best option: If the server is under warranty, get the vendor to do the
job. and get it done ASAP.

Yes this can cause pretty mysterious and serious problems.

Subject: [Ilugc] Error while connecting glade through python code
Message-ID: <793267.94927.qm@web95508.mail.in.yahoo.com>

I designed glade file with the preference as follows:

Project file format to "GtkBuilder"
Object name to "within the project"
Toolkit version to "2.16"

Then i tried to connect this glade file through python code which i have attached here. But I failed to make connection. I got the error as follows.

selvamani@selvamani-laptop:~/Documents/Documents/Selvamani/Project$ python flower_main.py

(flower_main.py:19730): libglade-WARNING **: Expected <glade-interface>.  Got <interface>.

RuntimeError: could not create GladeXML object
selvamani@selvamani-laptop:~/Documents/Documents/Selvamani/Project$

Could you please advise what could be done to resolve this problem.

Notes : The above python code works for the preference project file format for libglade which doesn't support "liststore" object for "treeview" widget in my project.

Thank You,

What about security updates in the last 2 years?

Don't kernel updates require rebooting?

Of course the people handling the show there know about yum update and
reboot when necessary.

Message-ID: <CF4077D671B855459DB756F1AA4006C002123057C9@exnjmb90.nam.nsroot.net>

If you are interested in applying for the job described below, please email
your resume to caiqs.jobs@citi.com with a subject line of
ILUGC-yourfirstname-yourlastname.

Two years ago one of the world's largest financial organisations constituted a
highly-focussed internal business group which seeks to exploit advanced
technologies in computation, data and finance for the purpose of out-performing
in the global securities marketplace.   The group is envisioned to remain small
and closely-knit with 2 main centers of operation, New York and Chennai, along
with additional operational footprint in Europe.

Following on its strong performance since inception, the group is seeking smart
people with very strong pragmatic computing skills and a solid
engineering/science academic background to grow our Chennai center.

For computational requirements, candidates would have demonstrable experience
on GNU/Linux, on which platform they would have written significant Python/Perl
code with database interaction, or they would have coded multithreaded C/C++.

The selected candidate would be extremely hard-working and driven to excel.
Due to close collaboration across timezones between geographically remote team
members to design, develop, test and deploy changes, the ability to communicate
effectively and frequently via email is required.  All hires gain expertise in
understanding and manipulating data.   They will also be ensuring the optimal
and highly-performant operation of a multitude of interdependent streams of
data manipulation and processing - activities that are deployed within the
group's execution/data centers which are colocated at the world's major
securities trading hubs.

All hires, regardless of background or focus will directly integrate and report
into this global team.   Due to the group's points of trading presence in
different time-zones, work at international hours will often be required, with
a concentration around the trading hours across the Asia-Pacific exchanges, for
which the Chennai team takes primary responsibility.   Work will be
challenging and individuals will be encouraged and mentored to grow in related
subject areas that will have long-term benefit to the group.

Compensation will be superior, will recognize individual contribution and
commitment, and will reflect the group's success.

Message-ID: <6e7b1b711003180223h449571a3y91ac88a9b2006dc5@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I would like to develop an Intellisense feature for the existing linux
command line interface. (it's not the command auto complete)

For example:
when you type '*ls -'* at the prompt, you will get a drop down menu with all
available options like *l, a, c, s* etc along with the short descriptions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*$ ls -
        l - long listing
        a - lists hidden files
        s - sorts by size
        c - sorts by modification date
$
*-------------------------------------------------------------------

I've surfed for enough things and found that there is no such application.
If I missed anything, can you please tell me whether any similar work
exists?
If there is no such app, can you please tell what would be the feasibility
and / or usability for this work? and please put some references to start
with.

Most commands (posix compliant) have the "--help"  which shows the
options with a small explaination for each.
Specific to your example "ls --help" shows the comon options of ls.

I think the OP specifically pointed out that. I guess the OP has in
mind something like the typical dropdowns that appear in yahoo/gmail
when you type in the "To" field.

As for me, I am not into development nowadays, so sorry.

But for dropdowns and all that fancy things you may look at ncurses library.

Thanks for the replies. After searching for the bash completion in the web i
have found the following link

http://www.debian-administration.org/article/An_introduction_to_bash_completion_part_2

It has tutorial how to deal with bash completion. Some modifications to the
tutorial showed the same results what I was expecting.

Since GTK+ 2.12, libglade has been absorbed into libgtk, as the GtkBuilder
class. When you save files in the GtkBuilder format, you will have to use
GtkBuilder class to create the UI. The corresponding pygtk code is shown below.

Firstly, what you are speaking about (extracting only some elements from a web 
page) is commonly referred to as web scraping. There are various libraries and 
tools available to web page scraping. Depending on how you wish to do it (ie: 
single pages, multiple pages, choice of programming language ...etc). Do a 
google and if you need more help in narrowing down the choices ask again with 
more specifics of what type of tools you would prefer.

Secondly, if you intend to get large amount of content from wikipedia, it is 
recommended that you /do not/ use an automated tool:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_database#Please_do_not_use_a_web_crawler

Instead use one of the alternate methods mentioned in the page above.

Thirdly, if you just want to remove unnecessary elements from a page and save 
only the content, while browsing, I would suggest using one of these Firefox tools:

I have made some custom shell script to process certain format. for example
converting .mp3 to .ogg Or processng .ttt files(custom extension zip file)
with shell script. But the problem is I have to go command line and give
filename as argument. is there anyway I can make rightclick on files and
openwith customshell script where filename automatically comes as argument !

Nautilus Actions is what you want, if you're using the Nautilus file
manager.

Sure. If you are using gnome+nautilus, simply right click the file name->Open 
with-> Other application-> Use a custom command.

You may choose to directly call your script directly (which *i think* would 
result in the script being called in the background) or launch it within a 
terminal. Most terminals support launching a command automatically using a flag 
(like -e for most xterm variants). So, you can enter something like this for the 
custom command:

/usr/bin/gnome-terminal -e your_script_name

The file is passed as an additional argument to this command.

If this is a frequent operation you might OTOH, want to write a nautilus script 
so that the option is shown directly in your right-click menu:

No, I do not want to use this. I want to know, how VLC can open file on
right click without using Nautilus Actions Or scripts Manager ?
Bascally, I just want, *.ttt file to be associated with that script and
clicking must execute script with filename as argument !

Hi

Could anyone let me know the process happening behind protecting a document
with password.

Does it involve hashing(md5/sha), encryption(des/aes) in it or any other.

Well, I think this might help:

and most probably for your specific problem, this might be of interest:

I had similar requirement (En queuing files in totem). After googling
I found that you can write scripts (whatsoever may be the programming
language) and put that in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts and give execute
permissions. If you do that, whenever you right-click any file you can
see "Scripts" in the context menu and int the Scripts menu you can see
your script name. Clicking on that, shell passes the filename as the
argument to your script.

Hi

I am writing an application in C++ , which does an auto-discover of
instances of the same application on machines over a network. In order to do
this(say the app is listening on port 1000), I had thought of doing a
broadcast ping and then test if port 1000 is open on all the machines which
gave a response. Is there any more efficient way to do this?

You could try Avahi. Sounds like DNS Service Discovery would be what
you'd want.

You may use password less authentication.

It allows you to login to a remote host via the SSH protocol without a
password and is more secure than password-based authentication.

Google some thing like " password less authentication in Linux"

You will get lot of reference.

See this link also :

http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-multiple-ssh-key-based-authentication.html

I hope this will help your requirement.

Can't imagine a good reason to do this. Let's say you did do that. Then
anyone who ran `ps aux | grep ssh` would be able to see your password!
Still, if you really must, you could write a script for expect that does
what you want.

Why don't you tell us why you want to do this so that we can suggest a
possibly better way of going about things?

You cant provide a password as an argument to ssh. However you have some
options depending on what exactly you want to do:

- You can use tcl/expect script to make it interactive and supply the
password in your script through expect
- You can use ssh-keygen which uses private-key/public-key methods and
thereby bypass a challenge from the ssh server with a password (However,
this can be done only if the server is a standard server which you know in a
pre-determined manner that you are going to be communicating with). Try ssh
man page to view more details on this option.

Ok, You have to Setup passphrase less ssh.

HDFS has a master/slave architecture. An HDFS cluster consists of a single
NameNode, a master server. There are a number of DataNodes, usually one per
node in the cluster. The master(NameNode) node uses Secure Shell (SSH)
commands to start DataNodes.

Now check that you can ssh to the localhost without a passphrase:
$ ssh localhost

It should login without asking password. If not you have to setup
passphraseless ssh in your local box.

In a multi-node hadoop cluster, the master node uses Secure Shell (SSH)
commands to manipulate the remote nodes.

By default, if a user from NodeA wants to login to a remote NodeB by using
SSH, he will be asked the password for NodeB for authentication. However, it
is impossible to input
the authentication password every time the masternode wants to operate on a
slavenode. Under this circumstance, we must adopt public key authentication.
Simply speaking, every node will generate a pair of public key and private
key, and NodeA can login to NodeB without password authentication only if
NodeB has a copy of NodeA?s public key.In other words, if NodeB has NodeA?s
public key, NodeA is a trusted node to NodeB . In hadoop cluster, all the
slavenodes must have a copy of masternode?s public key.

Hi,

If you are new to the great technology Hadoop/MapReduce and want to getting
started with Hadoop, the bad news is : It is little bit difficult to setup
Hadoop cluster for beginer.

The Good news is : You may use "Hadoop Live CD" for getting started with
Hadoop. This live cd comes with two node cluster.

You can dowload "OpenSolaris Live Hadoop" from the below link and will work
with Hadoop without installing it.

This very much reminds me of a hacking contest at iit-m where one had
to brute force ssh using given dictionary. I couldn't figure it out
myself then, but expect was the solution, go for it :)

Message-ID: <4986ffac1003220425u16bb9e20p96c63c115f82fce6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We have a lab (Debian+Ubuntu Comps) and we want a very basic Distributed
Files System.
The requirements should be:-

1) Should connect all comps as one huge files system ( or at least a part of
it, for e.g ~/Users folder in all computers). May have a single server
daemon running and multiple client services (or some other combination)
2) Prefer using native 'cp' 'mv' 'rm' commands. For e.g Tahoe-LAFS had its
own complex set of `tahoe add` commands which were difficult to use and
supported less flags {And no, alias did not make it any easier to use}
3) Should be "dropbox-like" in functionality. Drag-Drop using nautilus
should be supported since most of the users are not very experienced.
4) Windows support is of low priority, but added advantage.
5) Least data redundancy ( and wastage of disk space)

There were a huge number of distributed file systems listed on wikipedia,
and I prefer to get your opinions instead. Especially from people with prior
experience in this regard.

Thanking you in advance!

Well, what you are seeing is a 'spanned' desktop (ie: both laptop and projector 
are part of *one* single spanned desktop). To choose the behavior you described, 
ie: the display on either one screen or a mirrored display, you can try 
"System->Preferences->Display".

Note, one annoying little glitch is sometime both monitors are detected but one 
shows up 'on-top' of the other, so until you 'drag' the one on top you would not 
see the other.

For spanning desktop drag any of the monitors to the position you prefer (ie: 
left or right of laptop display). For display a single 'non-spanned' desktop on 
both screens, select Mirror screens. And for using only a single screen, choose 
the one you do not want to use and select 'off'.

Let us know if it works. If it does you can select the "Show displays in panel" 
checkbox to quickly launch the interface.

BTW: using spanned desktops is /much/ more convenient than mirrored or 
individual screens once you get used to it.

cheers,

Hi ,

Take a look to well-known NFS and GlusterFS. Both NFS/GlusterFS is about
sharing the filesystem.

*NFS:*

*  If you want very basic Distributed Files System, NFS is very basic
Distributed Files System widely used and freely available distributed file
system.

* The NFS protocol is very old and not very efficient. It is hard to fix or
improve it.

*GlusterFS :*

GlusteFS is advanced, feature rich, scalabile, High performance file
systems.

* GlusterFS is a clustered file-system capable of scaling to several
peta-bytes.
* The real beauty of glusterfs lies in its simple, modular and extensible
design.
* GlusterFS is designed for linear scalability for very large sized storage
clusters.
* Storage bricks can be made of any commodity hardware
* GlusterFS has an edge over NFS in both features and performance(We have
benchmarked GlusterFS Vs NFS).
* Designed for O(1) scalability and feature rich.

GlusterFS Features:
http://www.gluster.com/community/documentation/index.php/GlusterFS_Features

You decide depending upon your need. I did  benchmark over NFS Vs GlusterFS,
finally I recommended  GlusterFS. Because it provides  rich set features,
performance and scalability.

I hope this will help you.

Subject: [Ilugc] Change annoying Firefox back button behaviour
Message-ID: <1269274466.15206.8.camel@mjolnir>

Hello, everyone,

I use Firefox 3.0 on Ubuntu 9.04. When I hit the Back button, Firefox
seems to be loading the page again. Back in the day, I used to use Opera
and that would go instantly back to the previous page.

The only relevant Google results point to changing the
browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers setting but the Mozilla
Knowledge Base says that this should automatically be 8 pages for me so
that doesn't make much sense
<http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers> (I
have 3 GB of RAM)

I can't simply test this because I only have reasonably fast connections
at my disposal and this is only noticeable when something goes wrong
(like the site accessed is slow or something).

Any other ideas?

If I understood you currently then:
Have a server with say /mountpoint and mount multiple client's
/freediskspace to it /mountpoint/cli1, /mountpoint/cli2, /mountpoint/cli3..
and have all the clients mount server's /mountpoint to say ~/User?

In this case, I would say that the amount of userspace available to a user
is limited. It acts more of a "samba like shared-folders" where you have
read-write permission. So, if a person uses up all the space available on
/mountpoint/cli1/mydir he'd have to manually move/create another directory
in /mountpoint/cli2/mydir. Which is not ideal.

Ilug-c members have suggested GlusterFS and openafs, I'd be looking into it
for now, if I receive no other suggestions. (Thanks guys!)

Does the installed Operating System see your network card ? What does
a lspci -vv say ?

I see you are so used to M$ Windozzzzzz that you are not sure what
others have told you.

First, get some help in installing. (try install fest, attend lug
meeting and get some help there.
second, learn some basics like using the CLI, concepts of networking,
etc. this will take you a long way in using any OS... there are lots
of material on the web...

Cluster file systems are generally high maintenance and
not to be attempted without the right infrastructure.

It's a bad idea to aggregate the unused disk space available
on desktops for any type of online use.  This may work well
for distributed backups however.

What happens if someone powers off one of your lab
computers?  All data residing on the node is inaccessible.
Is that something you can control in your environment?
Even booting up such systems will become a challenge,
just try cross mounting NFS shares on 3 servers and
you'll see the dependency issues.

For predictable performance and availability, all cluster file
systems require dedicated back end storage nodes, gateways,
metadata and lock managers.


IMO the easiest approach is to use NFS auto mounting.  I
had data on ~30 workstations shared like this:

1. On each workstation, NFS export the "data" file system
in a standard way. eg. /data/$hostname

2. Then use "executable maps" (man autofs) and some
creative scripting to auto mount the file systems on demand.
NIS/LDAP was too hard for me back when I did this.

3. User will have to "cd /data/$hostname" from any computer
and autofs will mount the nfs share on demand.  If $hostname
is powered of at that time, your users will get an NFS timeout.
So NFS soft mounting becomes essential.

4. Ensure you are using NIS/LDAP to synchronize all UID
GID numbers.  Otherwise file ownership and permissions
don't work.

It's been nearly a decade since I've last done NFS auto
mounts.  Do let me know if you require my scripts/config
files, I'll have to dig them up.


If you want any kind of production quality cluster file system
setup, I suggest that you do it using the right infrastructure.

Not sure if boot-up manager can handle Upstart setup. The documentation
doesn't seem to suggest upstart support.

Just a friendly warning :)

Message-ID: <333797351DE86B4BA5EE7CC1C71C79A91EF53884EC@CLUSTEREDMB.intranet.com>

Hi,

1)  How do i add multiple loopback address in the linux (similar to cisco hw).
I have one ethernet interface (192.168.101.2/24), and i want to simulate multiple
private networks(10.1.1.1/24,10.2.1.1/24,10.3.1.1/24). I thought i can add multple
loopback interface for each network. But i am able to add only one loopback
device in the linux  (I have used ifconfig lo 10.1.1.1 command for loopback
device confguration. Also it doesnt accept the mask)
Any idea how to add multiple loopback addresses?

2) Also routing table doesnt show the loopback device.
I mean, If i ping the loopback device  it pings. (ex : ping 10.1.1.1 - ping works)
Suppose i want to ping the loopback device from the eth0 interface then ping
failed( Ex : my eth0 ip is 192.168.101.2, & loopback ip is 10.1.1.1.
ping -I eth0 10.1.1.1 is failed.no response)

How do i add the route for the loopback devices.

My setup:
FC12
one ethernet interface present 10/100Mbps.

Message-ID: <a8e2ecc11003222000t1d714ec0p2189b493aa17b38@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I tried to download the latest kernel packages using yum. However during
dependency resolution I got an error indicating:

--> kernel conflicts with iwl4965-firmware

So now from what I understand is, that in an ideal scenario, the new kernel
would require the firmware of the device to be upgraded for the drivers in
the new kernel to be able to communicate with the device. Is this rite?

If the above is right and say I upgrade the firmware, then isn't it supposed
to effect the working of the device, when I boot into Windows.

I had faced this earlier too, I have a nVidia card and had updated the
kernel using kernel*, this updated the firmware too, so now I had to
reinstall the proprietary drivers of nVidia to get the display. Moreover
when I booted windows, I did not face any issues. Isn't firmware on the
device and isn't is supposed to effect the functionality when I boot into
another OS?

Regards,
Ashish

For wireless drivers the firmware is actually a binary blob on the hard
disk. The blob is loaded from the hard disk by the kernel everytime the
system boots up and is loaded into the device. So the firmware has nothing
to do with what is happening in Windows. It is like this mainly due to
some regulatory requirements for radio frequency devices.

In case of nVidia drivers, when you upgraded the kernel, the driver was
unchanged but the glue code for interfacing the driver to the kernel
(which was written to avoid opening up the drivers) had to be recompiled
to match the running kernel.

Senthil

First off, never top post.

Second find the linux driver for your network card and install it.

Post the lspci output so members can further look into it.

What does the windows device manger show up as the network card?

Please be specific to get better help. "My network doesn't work.
Please help" kind of requests without any specifics doesn't yield
quality answers.

 I tried everything - can get a screen on the external display, or a screen on 
the laptop. But not the same screen on both. Mirror command gives a kernel bug 
message and doesnt work.

You Qus is NOT clear. Plz give the commands used to create the
interfaces and error messages.

You can add multiple alias interface to lo:
ifconfig lo:1 127.1.0.1 netmask 255.255.0.0

Similarly to eth0:
ifconfig eth0:1 10.2.1.1 ..

What kind of an internet connection you have? You may need to setup the 
network connection before you can connect to and use the internet. Also 
do not top post, we use interleaved trimmed style of posting in this 
mailing list. Do take time to learn the mailing list guidelines, how to 
ask questions and the posting techniques so that you can easily get your

dear raju,

this may be a very silly question to ask you - any way don't mind.

have you given access rights to the user id - from which you are accessing
from (hoping that you are trying it as one of the user and not as a root).
if not - please change it.

Check your VNC server for options on making it listen on arbitrary
ports.

If that does not suit, run VNC on the default ports and use the
iptables redirect option to forward your tcp connections.  See:

Hi,

>> 1)  How do i add multiple loopback address in the linux

>You Qus is NOT clear. Plz give the commands used to create the

In cisco hardware we can create 'N' number of loopback devices (lo1,lo2,lo3,lo4 etc). This is useful to simulate multiple networks for testing.
I am looking for similar capability in linux. But linux supports only one loopback device (lo).
I am not sure, adding multiple alias to the loopbackdevice will solve my problem. Let me try this.
Thanks for your suggestion.

Thanks

Hi,

For my embedded project, I require the secure http based web interface(HTTPS) for configuring the product.
The webpage contains below,
For ex:  system configuration (such as configure the IP Address of the Ethernet0 interface, configure the syslog server, control functions etc)
 Tools configuration (IPTables configuration, Routing protocols, VPN configuration ..etc)


I have installed the latest Apache webserver on the target.

In this context,
What are all the software required to perform the above?  What web development language should I use for the above mentioned activities ? (HTML with Javascript or PHP).
As the target is embedded hardware, I prefer the lightweight language (in terms of memory occupation, cpu utilization).
Please suggest .

Try mini-httpds, lighthttpd, boa, goahead, nginx as webservers. PHP or
any other server side scripting language will be bulky. I'd suggest
HTML with client side JS.

Check Lua for server side scripting.

m0n0wall has a nice web interface. It will be worthwhile checking it
out and adapting it.

Please give more details.

Is it ESX or vmware server?

have you installed vmware tools on the VM?

Hi,

Any other server side scripting can be used? How about perl?
The reason is, I am completely new to Lua.

Something wrong with your entire idea. Loopback devices do not have
IPs other than
127/8.

You need to use eth0:0 to eth0:n

It all depends on how constrained you are in terms of storage and
memory. Perl occupies a lot of storage and you'll also need related
libraries for functions you'll want to use. I'd strongly recommend
that you use CGI with C executables or system utilities to read/write
data you need to. I recommended Lua as it is a compact interpreter.
There may be others similar in nature.

Googling for PHP compact versions got me this

Who is your ISP? What kind of Internet connectivity is it? Broadband?
Airtel? BSNL?

You just need to plug in the cable in Windows?

Switch as root,

$ su

# chkconfig --list | grep network

Is it on at all run levels?

If not,

# chkconfig network on

Message-ID: <25141.9559.qm@web94709.mail.in2.yahoo.com>


Hello all,

Warm greetings ,

I have a Solaris C/c++ based code which is having that makes use of transport layer interface (TLI) calls (STREAMS) instead of standard BSD socket calls. as  linux doesn't support these TLI calls.


Please let me know how we can implement Streams in Linux , do we have any Library to use so that it supports STREAMS functionality .


Many Thanks for your help in advance 

Cheers

Sun stopped developing Streams ages ago and is keeping it
around only for backwards compatibility.  You should consider
rewriting you code using BSD sockets as it will increase
future portability.

That said, of you still need to use streams, try iBCS first.
It allows you to run most Solaris x86 binaries unmodified
on Linux x86.
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-abi/

Linux Streams (LiS) is also available, but I'm not sure
if it's usable for production quality code and question
its compatibility with future linux kernel developments.

To: olpc <india@lists.laptop.org>


 This morning Raisinghnagar became the first village in Rajasthan to have
one laptop for every child.

Inaugurating the event were all the villagers, district officials and
legislators and Satish Jha encouraged them to make it the trigger point for
educating every child in Rajasthan.

With support from TiE Sydney, Darshan Goswami and Satish Jha, Raisinghnagar
is the first village where every child in fact has an OLPC laptop now.

Narendra Sisodiya provided the technical leadership.

Thanks to everyone who made it possible.

Sincerely,
S Adhikari

Ubuntu uses debian's "APT" package management system. Using apt, one
can pick and install any of the available packages in the configured
APT repositories.

gromacs seems to be available on 9.10 in "universe" repository (this
means, if not enabled, you'll have to enable the universe repo first).
Please see http://www.google.com/search?q=enable%20universe%20ubuntu

Once you've enabled universe and done sudo apt-get update, you should
be able to seamlessly install gromacs by just typing:

$ sudo apt-get install gromacs

This will pull all the needed dependencies and install everything for you.

HTH,

hi,

this is embarrassing. When plugging in a usb stick, Mandriva pops up a window 
to open some program (Dolphin or digicam or whatever). There is also an option 
saying 'do not show this window again'. Unfortunately that got clicked, and 
now I cannot figure out how to restore it. I always mount from command line, so 
it is not a problem for me - but for wife and kids this is difficult. Any clues.

Normally the USB disk will get listed along with other devices
(HDD,..) and mount just by clicking it.

Message-ID: <34d63e2b1003250914k44e1dc24wdb888cc65c828605@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Harpia

What it is:

Uses a nice gui to arrange blocks in order to develop an image
processing chain. There is no need to know any programming language to
use it but, if required by the user, it can provide a good performance
C language source code for the application. Harpia lies heavily on the
power of the well-known OpenCV for its image processing core.

To know more about:

To install:

sudo apt-get install harpia

> I had a doubt about how to run a software from terminal itself.

You can run any program from the (Console/GUI) terminal. If that
program needs X then you should run it from GUI terminal.

When a program name entered @ prompt, then shell search for that
program in the pre-defined PATH (echo $PATH) and run it. If it is
not in the PATH, then shell show "command not found" message.

To run a program, which is not in the PATH, go the program folder
(cd /usr/local/mydir) and run (./prgName) or give the full path
/usr/local/mydir/prgName.

To run it like any other commands, add this folder to the PATH

Go to KDE System settings.

Choose Advanced Tab.

Under Advanced User Settings, you shall find "Device Actions"

Double click it,

I have the necessary instructions to be given while attaching storage to
my laptop titled 'Open with File manager'

Add appropriate actions actions accordingly.

Hi  Ranjith,

 I have been in another commitment, So I am not able to replay immediately .
Sorry for delay.

I remember that some one in the OpenCV community said some time back they
have done similar to you. I think your project is almost same with them. But
they recognize face using OpenCV technique and they have developed it using
java. But he said that the performance is not so good. They want to develop
it using neural network technique.

My suggestion is you can go ahead with Linux/C++/Parallel processing,
release it open source with good performance. Since multi-core systems are
spreading fast, the problem of parallel programming becomes more and more
urgent. Parallel processing has always been an interesting method to improve
program performance.

I suggest you to use OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) for  Parallel
processing.  In OpenCV code supports OpenMP.  OpenMP(For more info :
http://openmp.org/wp/) is multithreading C and C++ application program
interface lets you write applications that effectively use multiple
processors.

This one another link looks like your requirement . Take a look at this
implementation :
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/pyvision/index.php?title=FaceL:_Facile_Face_Labeler

I hope It will help you.

Thanks & Rg

Hi all,

It's that time of the year when we all come together and help all the
humans to get rid off the proprietary software, yes my friends it's
time for mukt.in.

We feel great pleasure to present you mukt.in 2010. This time with a
totally new concept and a new home. Previous editions have
successfully inspired a lot of people, specially in Hyderabad about
free software and brought them to the community. But due to the active
Telangana issue this year, so we are not able to have it in Hyderabad
this time.

So, we have shifted base to Jaipur, Rajasthan. This time we are not
accepting any talks , yes that's true. Mukt.in 2010 is going to be
completely workshop based. It's our belief that hands on tutorial have
a greater and better impact on the ones attending then only talking,
and looking at the fact, most people attending it would be students
from and around jaipur, because jaipur is a hub for engineering
colleges.

The mukt.in team invites submissions to its official un-conference ,
mukt.in 2010 to be held on 23rd and 24th April 2010 at Swami
Keshvanand Institute of Technology (SKIT), Jaipur, Rajasthan. We

Mukt.in 2010 theme and suggested area for workshops
As said earlier this time we are only planning to have workshops so,
we like to introduce the attendees to the concept of "shut-up and
hack". Our target audience will mostly be college students who will
have a beginner to intermediate expertise in FOSS. Plus we are also
planning to bring Rajasthan government officials / NGOs and also
college faculties. We plan to organize a complete workshop dedicated
to NGOs, government people and college faculties. The workshop for
college faculty should preferably target FOSS tools which the
faculties can use as an alternative to the existing proprietary tools.


Some of the suggested topics for workshops are:

   * LAMP.
   * FOSS and electronics.
   * Linux system administration.
   * FOSS in mobile computing.
   * Cloud computing with FOSS.
   * Emerging open standards.
   * FOSS and multimedia.
   * and much more.

For any further queries please write to us at:
contact@mukt.in

Thanks & Regards

Message-ID: <501901041003280558n531759f6sd7aef399386192c6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

GOAL: To write a script that would private ping each user in the
chatroom with a specified message

I wanted to ping each user in the Yahoo public chat room with a common
message & tried to search for some options. Then I came across Bitlbee
and the extensive Irssi with which I am able to connect to the Yahoo
protocol. Right now I am stuck and would want to know if anyone can
explain as to how we could retrieve the Public Room List in Yahoo Chat
using Irssi.

Application: youtube-dl

What it is:

youtube-dl  is a small command-line program to download videos from
YouTube.com. It allows you to save videos as .flv files. This short
article shows how to install and use it on Ubuntu

Features:

youtube-dl allows the user, among other things, to choose a specific
video quality to download (if available) or let the program
automatically determine the best quality video to grab.

To Install:

sudo aptitude install youtube-dl


To learn about youtube-dl's usage, take a look at its man page:

man youtube-dl

Basically it works as follows:

youtube-dl -o [name of output file] [YouTube URL]

E.g.:

youtube-dl -o test.flv http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mIZvDD0RkQ

Subject: [Ilugc] Tutorial and sample codes for ANN,
	GA and Fuzzy Logic toolboxes in Scilab
Message-ID: <51924f961003290222y62b9ec70v93788347c12c7eb5@mail.gmail.com>

Till now, i have using Matlab for Artificial Neural Networks, Genetic
Algorithms and Fuzzy Logic. But, after using Java and other some open source
creations, i wanted to completely replace matlab with some equivalent open
source software. For this i tried Scilab and installed the tool boxes for
the three. But, even after extensively trying and searching the net for a
suitable tutorial/guide for using these tool boxes, i could not find
anything worthwhile. I also tried exploring them myself but to no avail in
the absence of a suitable guide. Can somebody guide me how to use them and
tell me how to get some tutorial and sample codes for these tool boxes. Or
tell me is there some other open source equivalent of matlab for which
tutorial and documentation of using these three is available??
Thanks!!

Please try again and see if the problem goes away.

If it remains, try something different.

"Linux - Because x64 is a terrible thing to waste"

Message-ID: <5f4c8ab1003290541w61b854cdm8ec80c5de8bb5e1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys, i found a opensource software viz "Virtual box" which is used to
run windows xp in linux.

VirtualBox is a general-purpose full
virtualizer<http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Virtualization>for x86
hardware. Targeted at server, desktop and embedded use, it is now
the only professional-quality virtualization solution that is also Open
Source Software.

Some of the features of VirtualBox are:

   - *Modularity.* VirtualBox has an extremely modular design with
   well-defined internal programming interfaces and a client/server design.
   This makes it easy to control it from several interfaces at once: for
   example, you can start a virtual machine in a typical virtual machine GUI
   and then control that machine from the command line, or possibly remotely.
   VirtualBox also comes with a full Software Development Kit: even though it
   is Open Source Software, you don't *have* to hack the source to write a
   new interface for VirtualBox.


   - *Virtual machine descriptions in XML.* The configuration settings of
   virtual machines are stored entirely in XML and are independent of the local
   machines. Virtual machine definitions can therefore easily be ported to
   other computers.


   - *Guest Additions for Windows, Linux and Solaris.* VirtualBox has
   special software that can be installed inside Windows, Linux and Solaris
   virtual machines to improve performance and make integration much more
   seamless. Among the features provided by these Guest Additions are mouse
   pointer integration and arbitrary screen solutions (e.g. by resizing the
   guest window). There are also guest additions for OS/2 with somewhat reduced
   functionality.


   - *Shared folders.* Like many other virtualization solutions, for easy
   data exchange between hosts and guests, VirtualBox allows for declaring
   certain host directories as "shared folders", which can then be accessed
   from within virtual machines.

A number of extra features are available with the full VirtualBox release
only (see the "Editions <http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Editions>" page for
details):

   - *Virtual USB Controllers.* VirtualBox implements a virtual USB
   controller and allows you to connect arbitrary USB devices to your virtual
   machines without having to install device specific drivers on the host.


   - *Remote Desktop Protocol.* Unlike any other virtualization software,
   VirtualBox fully supports the standard Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). A
   virtual machine can act as an RDP server, allowing you to "run" the virtual
   machine remotely on some thin client that merely displays the RDP data.


   - *USB over RDP.* With this unique feature, a virtual machine that acts
   as an RDP server can still access arbitrary USB devices that are connected
   on the RDP client. This way, a powerful server machine can virtualize a lot
   of thin clients that merely need to display RDP data and have USB devices
   plugged in.

Anyone can download it from
http://www.virtualbox.org/

Subject: [Ilugc] Nokia 5800 - Can't connect to the internet with wvdial.
Message-ID: <e6b5008a1003290713m48b6b1cet99ee854ef8fd86a8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to connect my Arch Linux laptop to the internet with my Nokia
5800.
I'm using wvdial.
wvdialconf was able to detect my modem and wrote configuration files.
When I connect, wvdial makes a connection and then disconnects abruptly.
It says

--> Modem initialized.
--> Sending: ATDT*99#
--> Waiting for carrier.
ATDT*99#
CONNECT
~[7f]}#@!}!} } }2}#}$@#}!}$}%\}"}&} }*} } g}%~
--> Carrier detected.  Starting PPP immediately.
--> Starting pppd at Mon Mar 29 19:24:29 2010
--> Pid of pppd: 2247
--> Using interface ppp0
--> pppd: [03][7f]
--> pppd: [03][7f]
--> pppd: [03][7f]
--> pppd: [03][7f]
--> pppd: [03][7f]
--> pppd: [03][7f]
--> Disconnecting at Mon Mar 29 19:24:34 2010
--> The PPP daemon has died: A modem hung up the phone (exit code = 16)
--> man pppd explains pppd error codes in more detail.
--> Try again and look into /var/log/messages and the wvdial and pppd man
pages for more information.

My /var/log/messages.log tells me

Mar 29 19:24:29 kanini pppd[2247]: pppd 2.4.5 started by root, uid 0
Mar 29 19:24:29 kanini pppd[2247]: Using interface ppp0

Mar 29 19:24:34 kanini pppd[2247]: Modem hangup
Mar 29 19:24:34 kanini pppd[2247]: Exit.

Error 16 and LCP terminated by peer.

I also modded my 10-modem.fdi file in
/usr/share/hal/fdi/information/10freedesktop to include my product id
(0x0156) in the Nokia section
Still no use. =(

I've looked up the problem. There seems to be no solution available.
Has anyone tried connecting with a Nokia 5800?

Dear Friends

 Thanks For your Reply's. I have tried to Yast and zypper  already. While
install svn or vsftp packages it was asking cd only not installed using
repository. I don't know how to enable repository server on SuSe-Linux but i
can on CentOS.

Message-ID: <23e3fbb61003291017x4b61c0des8a98be5a249de07c@mail.gmail.com>

Friends,

I have Ubuntu 9.10 on my desktop

Then installed Xen hypervisor by issuing the following command

sudo apt-get install ubuntu-xen-server

After rebooting, two new items appears on the GRUB menu.
2.6.31-20-generic-pae(and corresponding recovery mode)

The new kernel (dom0) was selected to boot.

To know whether that dom0 is running or not, issued the below command from
the terminal

xm list

But i received following error

ERROR Internal error: Could not obtain handle on privileged command
interface (2 = No such file or directory)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/sbin/xm", line 8, in <module>
    from xen.xm import main
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/xen/xm/main.py", line 61, in
<module>
    xc = xen.lowlevel.xc.xc()
xen.lowlevel.xc.Error: (1, 'Internal error', 'Could not obtain handle on
privileged command interface (2 = No such file or directory)')

Googled for it, but i didnt end up with a soultion

Do anyone worked with Xen on Ubuntu 9.10 ?

Kindly, suggest me on how to resolve this problem ?

Thanks & Regards

I think you are missing Access Point Name(APN), you can get this name 
from your mobile's GPRS Settings.

Here is your modified wvdial.conf. If I'm right, then this will work.

[Dialer Defaults]
Init1 = ATZ
Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","portalnmms"
Modem Type = USB Modem
Phone = *99#
ISDN = 0
Username = username
Init1 = ATZ
Password = password
Modem = /dev/ttyACM0
Stupid Mode = 1
Baud = 460800
New PPPD=yes

Before giving wvdial command, make sure that you already activated your 
Vodafone Live and Vodafone Mobile Connect. Here is what Vodafone is 
saying about activating GPRS

My guess  is you have installed SLES (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server). In 
that case zypper/yast repo would be pointing to CD's. When you run the 
command 'suse_register' it points to novell's online repository. However 
opensuse by default comes with the online repository.

Note: SLES is Novell's equivalent to Redhat's RHEL. openSUSE is equivalent
to CentOS. If you notice RHEL also has a rhn_register to make it point to 
redhat's online repositories.

Sure. It is very much possible to have 32 bit and 64 bit versions on
same machine for most binaries.

You can run inside a chroot environment. As to perl I have no
experience doing what you are doing.

Doesn't perl come with the default install?

Hi,

Thanks a lot. I found my access point. It was www. I replaced portalnmms
with www and added the line to my wvdial.conf. Works perfectly. =)

Thank you all. =)

I thought that flashmagic is meant only for windows. Is there any
equivalent in linux? it seems from the forums that it may or may not
run under wine...

I am new to this though I started off with 8085 way back in 1983 and
haven't had any work relating programming microcontrollers for a while
now. Please bear with me.

As root,

# usermod -G ...

will add users to groups.

This indirect way is better than directly editing files.

Hi,

I think some of these are fairly arbitrary ...

This should possibly be revised to allow for any Open media format[1].

Again too restrictive. There are plenty of FOSS Operating Systems out there 
besides GNU/Linux.

It's ok to mandate a license (as an organizer) but you might want to include a 
few more Open content licenses, like for instance:

I think this is random. What have these things got to do with FOSS ?

Same as above.

Too general. What do you mean by highlighting ? Also, to take a step back, why 
is this restriction there in the first place ? If for example FSF-India becomes 
the largest sponsor for an event, I would think it fair for them to have the 
largest logo on the event tshirt. I think you might want to distinguish between 
'rules' and 'guidelines'.

See above comment on content licenses.

>        - *Gift to Speaker : *You must provide gifts to speakers.
Random. See comment on rules Vs guidelines.

The presence of Open Cola aside, the fact of the matter is almost everything 
that we depend on these days has some level of protection of information.

I think applying FOSS principles to Cola is going too far. Anyone who does that 
is being a hypocrite unless they are also running systems that are not made from 
closed hardware (ie: various hardware vendor's ^trade secrets^) and are not 
using closed BIOSes to boot 'em up !!

The entire /reason/ for the FOSS movement is because the people who started it, 
believed that /software/ ie: the _source_ is something to be shared. If these 
people also say the same thing about colas, engine designs, business practices, 
drug research or any other sort of information, that is only incidental. Those 
additional beliefs should not just be blindly adopted nor be mandated in a 
^Software^ Conference.

Message-ID: <m2wdd680c2b1003310219x2f31c56do8da0000e697a41eb@mail.gmail.com>

Today, March 31, is Document FreeDom Day.

All the IT world is revolving around the Documents. Documents are the
carriers of the Information.
And when those Documents are in the proprietary format like
DOC,XLS,PPT, DocX, XLSX, PPTX,
we are bounded to a specific software to open those files ? MS Office.

What is the problem in using those file formats?

The documents contain the information. If need the Information, we
have to use only that MS Office, which  we need to buy.

Thus, they are charging us to get the information from our own files.

This should be changed.

How to change this?
Why all our documents should be slave to a single company?

The answer is ?Use Open Document Formats?

What is this?

This is a concept/ method of creating file formats. We call this as ODF.

What is the use?

Yes. These document formats are open. Their specification, structure
is open so that any one can
build their own application to read/write information from these files.

It is based on XML and It supports text documents, presentations,
spreadsheets, and other common type of documents.
The definition of the format has been done by the OASIS organization,
with input from OpenOffice.org, KOffice, and
other interested parties; ODF even became an ISO standard!

No need to buy any costly software to just open/read/write a file.
Information is free now.

How to use it?

OpenOffice?s default format is ODF only.
Its Writer saves as ?odt ? open document text?.
Its Spreadsheet saves as ?ods ? open document spreadsheet?
Its Impress saves as ?odp ? open document presentation?

If you are using OpenOffice use the above file formats.
Get the OpenOffice for free at http://www.openoffice.org

If you use MS Office, install the ODF Plugin from
http://www.sun.com/software/star/odf_plugin/

Come.
Let us give freedom to the documents.

Subject: [Ilugc] Capture screen and mic input using FFmpeg and ALSA
Message-ID: <hov9m8$hiq$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hi,

Recently, lot of traffic about x11grab appeared in 
commandlinefu(http://www.commandlinefu.com). People posted their 
commandline variants to create screencast video.

For my purpose, I also created my own variant of x11grab, here is the 
commandline.

-----
ffmpeg -f alsa -itsoffset 00:00:02.000 -ac 2 -i hw:0,0 -f x11grab -s 
$(xwininfo -root | grep 'geometry' | awk '{print $2;}') -r 10 -i :0.0 
-sameq -f mp4 -s wvga -y outputfile.mp4
-----

And to make it simple, I also wrote a small script

-----
#!/bin/sh
# simple command to capture your screen and mic input

OUTPUT="${1:?[usage] screencast.sh OUTPUTFILE}"

getgeometry()
{
         xwininfo -root |
         grep 'geometry' |
         awk '{print $2;}'
}

captureX11()
{
         ffmpeg -f alsa -itsoffset 00:00:02.000 -ac 2 -i hw:0,0 \
                 -f x11grab -s $(getgeometry) -r 10 -i :0.0 \
                 -sameq -f mp4 \
                 -s wvga \
                 -y "${OUTPUT}"
}

captureX11
-----

This script captured my desktop as well as voice from my laptop's 
in-built front mic. I'm using Debian(Testing). I'm posting this script 
to see how it works in other distros. If you understand and know how to 
tweek this commandline, please post your modifications.

For newcomers, to run this script, you need to install ffmpeg and ALSA. 
Ubuntu/Fedora are using pulse as their audio subsystem. I don't know how 
to use pulse to capture mic input. Don't try if you don't know what you 
are doing. You will endup breaking your sound.

This is the first screencast I created using this script,

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3gOxtXN5wc

Lets play with ffmpeg :)

Mohan R.

Also do this:

$ sudo apt-get install xen-hypervisor-3.3 xen-shell xen-tools xen-utils-3.3

You will also need these packages.

Be a little more specific in your questions.
            - Which company is the mobile broadband device?
            - Have you googled for the answer before asking here?

By default, these packages are installed with sudo apt-get install
ubuntu-xen-server command itself

Subject: [Ilugc] Wake up Jairam Ramesh
Message-ID: <20100330135852.20027.qmail@greenpeace.in>

   Hi,

   The Dhamra port in Orissa is not only threatening the Olive Ridley sea
   turtles, it is also being constructed on forest land without permission
   from the Central government.

   Based on letters issued by its own officials, a case was filed against the
   Ministry of Environment and Forest and the Orissa government in October
   last year for violating the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. Till now
   neither have filed a response before the Supreme Courta**s Central
   Empowered Committee.

   Greenpeace is taking a petition asking environment minister Jairam Ramesh
   to take a stand and the violation of the Forest Conservation Act.

   I have already signed this petition. You can also sign it and ensure that
   Jairam Ramesh takes necessary action.

   www.greenpeace.in/turtle/sign-the-petition2/

   Thanks!

   You are receiving this email because someone you know sent it to you from
   the Greenpeace site. Greenpeace retains no information about individuals
   contacted through its site, and will not send you further messages without
   your consent -- although your friends could, of course, send you another
   message.
