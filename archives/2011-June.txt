Friends.

Finally, the Director of the film "Revolution OS", JTS Moore, granted permission
to dub the film in Tamil and Hindi.

I am translating the transcript to Tamil.
We need volunteers to give voice to the audio track.

Will update you all once completed the translation.

If anyone wish to translate in Hindi, please contact me.

Let us wait for the day, when Eric Raymond, Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds,
Bryce Perens, Michael Tiemann, Larry Augustin, Brian Behlendorf,
Donnie Barnes, Frank Hecker and more people to speak Tamil and Hindi.

I hope after finishing this project in Tamil and Hindi, we can get
permissions for other languages too.

Thanks.

Shrinivasan,

Yes, you can have permission to dub REVOLUTION OS into Tamil and Hindi
with the following conditions:

1) If you don't already own an official DVD copy of REVOLUTION OS, you
will need to buy one. ?That's because I need to make at least some
money. ?Also, on the DVD of REVOLUTION OS there is an alternate audio
track that contains only the Music and Sound Effects with no dialogue.
?This alternate audio track was created specifically for use in the
dubbing of non-English language audio tracks.

The best outlet for purchasing the DVD of REVOLUTION OS with low-cost
international shipping is CDbaby.com:

http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/revolutionosdvd

2) You can only create Tamil and Hindi language audio tracks. ?No subtitles.

3) You cannot duplicate or distribute DVDs or other physical copies of
REVOLUTION OS. ?You can burn a DVD of your dubbed versions of
REVOLUTION OS for exhibitions that you personally oversee.

4) You can present free screenings of REVOLUTION OS in conjunction
with Linux user groups, FOSS groups, and non-profit educational
institutions. ?However, you cannot ?give Linux user groups, FOSS
groups, and non-profit educational institutions ongoing permission to
screen REVOLUTION OS or the Tamil-language or Hindi-language versions.

5) You cannot screen, loan, or license the Tamil-language or
Hindi-language versions of REVOLUTION OS to for-profit corporations.
Such entities (such as Wipro, Infosys, Tata) must negotiate separate
licenses with me and only with me. ?I retain the exclusive right to
unilaterally license Tamil-language and Hindi-language versions that
you and your group creates to any entity whether non-profit or
for-profit, and to retain all revenues from such deals.

6) If you do charge for screenings, you must send me 50% of the total
ticket sales via PayPal.com (jtsmoore at revolution-os.com).

7) You can upload Tamil-language and Hindi-language versions of
REVOLUTION OS to YouTube (but not the English-language version).
However, you must send me the web links. ?From time to time, I may
purge YouTube of video copies of REVOLUTION OS that are posted without
my permission. ?So I need to know which YouTube files I have granted
permission to.

8) The dubbed versions of REVOLUTION OS that you produce cannot be
broadcast or exhibited on any form of television without my expressed
permission. ?I retain the exclusive right to unilaterally negotiate
all deals to license the Tamil-language and Hindi-language versions to
television worldwide and retain all revenues from such deals.

9) I reserve the right to terminate at anytime your permission to dub
REVOLUTION OS, or to screen, exhibit, upload, or present all or part
of the Tamil-language and Hindi-language dubbed versions of REVOLUTION
OS.

10) In the unlikely event I ever produce a Blu-Ray disc or
international version of REVOLUTION OS, I will have the right, at no
cost to me or my assigns, to include the Tamil-language and
Hindi-language audio tracks on future editions of REVOLUTION OS.

11) I retain all rights to REVOLUTION OS and the rights to all
derivative works, including all Tamil-language and Hindi-language
dubbed versions, of REVOLUTION OS.

12) You have no rights to license or enter into any agreements
pertaining to REVOLUTION OS or the Tamil-language and Hindi-language
versions. ?You cannot sub-license or convey any rights in REVOLUTION
OS or the Tamil-language and Hindi-language versions to anyone or any
entity.

13) I may add additional conditions as I deem necessary.

14) This is the entirety of our agreement.

If those conditions work for you, then you are welcome to produce
Tamil-language and Hindi-language dubbed versions of REVOLUTION OS.

Attached below is the English-language transcript of REVOLUTION OS.
Please let me know what you decide to do.

Best Wishes,

J.T.S. Moore
Director, REVOLUTION OS

Message-ID: <BANLkTimqWxYtf4cWjZ3TA=OPu7z1kBnT0A@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

Today morning, I had a discussion with HOD MCA Dept, Panimalar Engg
College, Chennai.

They are willing to encourage their 180 final year students to do
projects in open source technologies.
They need our support in the following areas.

1. Training on various FOSS languages and technologies
2. Helping the students to select open source projects to contribute
3. Mentoring the students during the development period

I showed the following pages.
http://wiki.ilugc.in/index.php?title=Projects_List
http://wiki.ilugc.in/index.php?title=Projects_Mentors

They are highly interested to see these pages.

The staff will be their internal guide and we have to be as external guides.

We have 2 semesters.
We can use 1 semester for training and the next for project development.
Students will be available from 3.30 - 5.30 pm daily.

This is a great opportunity for us to bring more open source contributors.
When the staff and students from are willing to contribute, industry
should help them to make it into reality.

I ensured them as to give a proposal within this week.

We have to plan for the following things.

1. Trainers who can goto college in person to train the students
2. List of open source projects to contribute
3. Mentors for the students

We need a huge list of project as all the students have to do
individual projects.
We need more persons to participate in the huge project of turning
students into contributors.

Please share your thoughts here, on how to proceed further.


Note: All the efforts will be rewarded by the college management.

Are there any specific criteria for the type of projects like database or

released under Free software licence.

Wonderful initiative.   Kudos and thanks for pursuing it and getting
the permissions.

For the Hindi translation, I suggest forwarding your post to the ILUGs
in the Hindi speaking belt (e.g. Delhi, Indore, Jaipur).  I will
forward it to the ILUG-Delhi list.

If their availability can be guaranteed with internet connection, I think it
would be a good idea to create a dedicated IRC channel for initial training
periods. I have been seeing IITMHackers club organizing tutorial sessions
purely on IRC for things like VIM, Python ..etc. It also introduces them to
IRC channels which hosts highly technical discussions related to OpenSource
technologies.

While individual projects can really help in improving a student's
capabilities and knowledge, I still feel a team of two can be permissible
(just an optional one), so that they can discuss and work better on the
projects.

I would like to add one more reason: people like me can help the students
through online discussions even off the official hours of 3.30 to 5.30
through these channels.

I wish all the people thinking of helping consider few things - which are sad reality of present education.

1.Out of 180 students atleast 170 will require spoon-feeding, hand-holding etc. There is no substitute to regular class-room+lab type of teaching for them.
2.Self learning is very minimal
3.College Management expects us to be physically present.
4.First semester will require extensive teaching and hence physical presence will be required. We can form a team to teach different languages/tools.
5.During actual projects personal contacts/interaction can be minimal.
6.Teaching over irc,email, forum etc., are ruled out. At the maximum they can be used for clearing doubts

What are the ways ILUGC members can contribute?
1.If you can spare time (3.30 to 5.30) take class even if it is for 1 or 2 days please do. We will workout a timetable and post it. 
2.Create project ideas in the wiki page. Also clearly state basic requirements. Since it is MCA projects need not be IEEE.
3.During project stage the hours will be flexible and probably we can ask students to meet the mentors at a place convenient to the mentor. So mentoring the project, in my opinion many can volunteer.

Usually only 5% are actually "students", interested in learning. The
others are just in there for the degree.

It is better to check first if the students are really interested.

Well however true this is, great things are done in life with great
difficulties, great suffering
 and great self confidence.

Outside agents cannot change the attitude of people.

> 2.Self learning is very minimal

Auto didacts like Kamaraj who was unlettered but had incredible common
sense is what
 is needed to do great things.

Common sense, common sense, common sense.

A practical approach towards everything is needed.

This is not reqd of course. Remote help is useful but people like me
can certainly
 help students if they but care to visit my company's premises.

I am not much interested in such plans. Carrying out a plan is very tough.

Yeah but if the student in question is motivated and shows the right
Bhava towards learning
 then I don't mind spending my time...

I don't think so. E-mails are very useful for teaching. How much have
I learnt from LUG?

Thro' mails alone?

Well help comes only after you help yourself.

I am willing to help mentor students if they but visit my company and
so some work for me.

I can occasionally come and speak in colleges but that is difficult.

You need not restrict yourself to local facilities. You can also participate in
global mailing lists and stuff.

Of course learning from physical contact with sound engineers and motivated
 hackers always help.

Developing friendship with IIT boys can help you for sure.

If both you people are motivated enough, yes. Teamwork is always good.

That's true but rest of them require a little bit motivation is most cases.
And since it's the case that the college's interested and going to push them
to do their final year project, which will be graded, I think the students
would be interested for their own sake?

IMO the best way would be to start off by doing simple tasks such as
learning CMS', python, creating a blog where they write about their
experience, tools such as LaTeX etc. That's what we do to new students in my
campus-we've a set of simple tasks which they carry out-it increases their
confidence and they learn about various open source projects which they can
contribute to in future.

And helping out through IRC/Mailing list, sure it's possible-Ubuntu has been
conducting Ubuntu User Days and Ubuntu Developer Week all the time over IRC
only. I'm sure it'll be a learning experience for the students to get
exposed to IRC-learn netiquettes etc as well.

That would be sad, really, if they just did it for the sake of the
grade (and the degree that comes with it), and not for the love and
passion of the F/OSS methodology and ideology that we all live and
work so hard for.

F/OSS, or any other cannot be forced on to people. Sure, you can help
motivate others. But, the interest, self-learning, determination,
commitment, hard work has to come from the individual(s).

Sure-that is for the highly motivated people. Students are not that
motivated but with a little effort they will be. The entire lot won't be
into it I agree-few will be when starting off and few more will eventually
given the right guidance. That's what I feel.

Hi All,



Some of the oldies of Ruby and Rails across various places in India
have joined together and come out with a Nationalized Group for Ruby
on Rails. We call it the INDIARUBYCONSORTIUM(IRC).



Many ask ?when I have BRUG or Pune Ruby or Chennai.rb, etc., then why
IRC??. The reason was simple? to bring a system which can take up the
best practices across the groups and promote them to other groups? for
example? BangaloreRUG did a good BugMash a fortnight back? where as
Pune Ruby and MumbaiRUG do hackfests and they have been doing it for a
long time? Which is great and other groups should also implement them.



Also as part of IRC, we had discussions on how to setup and run Ruby
Users groups? We had discussions with people who showed ?interests in
creating a group in Hyderabad and Trivandrum ? and during this
discussions we really Started the Ahmedabad Ruby and Rails Groups
(http://groups.google.com/group/ahmedabad-ruby-on-rails-group).



What others will we do as part of IRC? We shall provide a one stop directory to



All Groups available for Ruby and Rails
All Rubyists in the country
All Ruby? based activities / Events that take place in India
Promote all the Open Source activities as contributed by Indians to
the Ruby world
Promote all the Websites built using Ruby on Rails by Indians and For Indians
Educate people via Ruby/Rails monthly magazines
Provide details about all training activities that take place in India



So basically what we want to achieve is ?BY THE RUBYISTS, FOR THE
RUBYISTS AND OF THE RUBYISTS?



SO I WOULD EXTEND A HEARTY INVITATION TO REGISTER TO
WWW.INDIARUBYCONSORTIUM.COM and make one large RUBY Community.



P.S: If you have built any website for Indians or built any open
source product, then you can promote it in the IRC website (You have
to be member first). Use the Contact-us form to send information.



P.S: X-POSTED TO Chennai.rb, Keralarug, puneruby



Thanks and Regards

Satish Kota

Moderator, INDIARUBYCONSORTIUM

..... snip .....

Looks like your ldap client is not configured properly to talk to the
ldap server or the server is not available (firewall?).   What is the
output of "nmap <ldap_server_ip>" - note do this from another node
(ip) in your network.

It seems some of your expectation on ILUG-C has not been met..

I have been member of this group for past 4 years, and in my observation,
the ILUG-C (NOT the mailing list, but the community) has been more
productive now, due to initiatives of some members..  Baskar has setup FOSS
lab in so many colleges..  Today, we are seeing some organised effort in
providing mentorship to college students..  Regular meeting of ILUG-C..

Even, my expectation of this group is also NOT met.. that doesnt mean, ILUGC
is defunct..  it is very well proactive, and going in right direction..

what we need  is a management team, to give a vision and direction..

Senthil

Before that, we should have an evaluation of the students..   there is NO
necessity that we should teach every student in that college..  we should
not commit like that .. We need to select students based on evaluation..

Yes.. for most of the students..  reason:  lack of reading habits..

based on my experience in past 3 years, the attitude of most of the students
is pathetic..  many students want a job on a gold platter..  and many dont
know what they want or what they are capable..  there no sincerity on their
part, and they just wanted to enjoy their college life..

So what we need initially is an orientation program, explaining them the
ground realities..

This is another aspect we have to consider carefully..
   * we have to ascertain the motive and objective of the college
management..  we should not be utilised for their selfish objectives.
   * ILUGC should not be dictated by college terms..  rather, we have to set
terms for college to follow us.. only then we can maintain the standard..
   * We need to make clear, that we are NOT their servant..  bcoz, anything
coming free is not respected in most cases..

This will amount to spoon feeding..  we can give basic introduction, and the
student should learn on their own..  Class room teaching will never impart
the required knowledge..

  we need to first analyse our resource availability, the open source
projects we have at hand, how many persons needed for that, time duration,
and the required skill sets..   once we take stock of our capabilities, we
can tell the college students that we can take only this number of students
for project work and the students would be selected based on evalutation and
personal interview, and there should be a binding on the part of student to
complete the tasks assigned..

Say for example, there are 180 students, we will select only 25-50 students,
and focus on them..  if the college wants to teach to all students, they can
utilise these core students for that..   This approach will share the burden
among students, and relieve our ILUGC member to focus on our core
objective..  to guide, rather than to teach..

Senthil

Subject: [Ilugc] OpenID for phpBB forum - my accomplishment
Message-ID: <BANLkTimdNB9=ddC_B56tiH4wr4k0CFOmvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I tried integrating open id with a phpbb forum i set for a personal
project.  I initially tried phpBB openid module from zenor soft.
http://www.zenorsoft.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=841

for some reasons it did not work for me.. so i modified it, and simplified
it so that there is no MOD installing required and the usability is simple
as described below.

1. The user has to first register in the forum with either yahoo or gmail
id.
2. After his account is activated, he can click on the yahoo or google icon
which i display in the home page or login page.
3. he will be taken to yahoo or google authentication page, and once he
approves his authentication there, he will be redirected back to the forum
page.
4. If he is successfully authenticated, his email would be obtained from AX
data returned by yahoo or google.
5. and in my code, i will check if the email is already registered.  If so,
he will automatically signed in.
6. If the email is not already registered, appropriate error message
displayed.

I am not sure of any security flaws in the above method.  But i implemented
it in my forum, and the feedback from the users has been positive..

I can share the code to any one who wanted to implement in their own forum.


NOTE:  I used janrain library for the same.  it is not a full-fledged module
for phpbb.

Senthil

such a team exists - and like in all successful LUGs it is not formal.
It consists of the people who take initiative and do things. Of course
the composition of this group keeps changing. People become active, then
go quiet, others move away, still others focus on just one task. To try
to formalise this is about as productive as harnessing cats to a cart
and expect them to pull it.

Individual initiatives is different from a team to co-ordinate the group..
individuals take initiatives, do the ground work, and then retire..

but what i am saying is a co-ordination team, which just co-ordinates
different such individual teams towards a larger project..  this
co-ordination team need not be static or need not do any ground work..  they
just oversee and co-ordinate..  for eg, the student guide program is a
relatively large one, that needs sustainable effort..  definitely there
needs a team to co-ordinate, where even if individual members are unable to
contribute, replacement is made for the project to go on..

Dear all

I need to know whether anybody has installed OpenVPN client in Android
mobile, if yes please share your experience with me.

After googling couple of times, I found that we need to have root access to
install it.

Can anybody help me how can I achieve root access in android mobiles.

Waiting for your valuable reply.

In other word (corporatespeak), "Ownership" pf a project.

This idea is similiar to what I mooted sometime back for an all India Level.

I had Ideas for such teams which will take ownership of projects such as:
1. Python
2. ERP
3. School/college/University automation software
4. Virtualization
6. High availability
7. Recend project by IITB for video learning
8. Training
and most importantly,
9. Post implementation support

etc.

Students generally work enthusiastically on a project to complete
their degree etc and the go on to dig their head in .net/java et. al ,
get married have children and then they completely lose touch with
these projects which are abandoned or under/unutilised.

People want certainty for developing a level of trust.. Individual
efforts  are great.

Projects generally have a lifetime of about 8-10 years when the go in
production before they are replaced.

Hope my above comments made my thoughts clearer

above IMHO

Specify in which devices the audio is not clear like speakers or headphones.
Try the balance of sound and adjust for the slected devices.

You can always use an external USB keyboard with your laptop.
Duh!

I pulled out all the keys on my dell laptop a few years ago and plugged them
back in Dvorak layout. Worked okay, just have to be careful with the track
point thimble in the center of the keyboard!

Tried 3 times to switch to Dvorak over the past 15 years and always gave up
within 1-2 days. Keep us informed with your progress!

I work on many machines in many places. If I keep pulling out keys
everywhere I would soon be jobless. Also I cannot keep carrying my own
keyboard around. The only solution is to get used to doing it on a
querty keyboard.

Need not be ownership of a project..  In many projects, the skill set would
be required from multiple streams..  for eg, a web project using PHP may
require skill sets of a designer, and that of a tester.  A project owner
will take responsibility of setting up Git, issue tracker and other
modalaties and he will lead the developers..  and a co-ordination team for
this ILUGC will just co-ordinate different set of people/projects, so that
they share resources, ideas or skillsets..

Co-ordinators need not go for voluntary services, or start new projects..

Senthil

Friends.

Thanks for your interest in dubbing the movie "Revolution OS" in Tamil.

I translated the entire script in Tamil in paper.
My friends in kanchipuram are typing the text to make as a digital document.

Once, we receive the text, we can check for any corrections.

The film has 13 major characters and 11 minor characters.

Major Characters:

Eric Raymond
TV Reporter
Narrator
TV Commentator - Sue Herrera [ female ]
Linus Torvalds
Bryce Perens
Richard Stallman
Interviewer
Michael Tiemann
Larry Augustin
Brian Behlendorf
Donnie Barnes
Frank Hecker


Minor Characters:

Terry Egan
Marc Merlin
Dave Ljung Madison
Nick Moffitt
Chris DiBona
Presenter
TV Reporter - Tom Costello
Person at the computer
Man behind the computer
Person next to him
Rob Malda



The voices should be bold and energetic.

I am not sure on whether we can use the young college student's voice or
we need the voices of grown adults.

we can have a voice test and select people soon.

Thanks a lot.

Dear Shrinivasan,

Here is my talk abstract and bio:

Talk: Public/Private cryptography with the GNU Privacy Guard

Authentication and security have always been important aspects in
deploying electronic communication and storage solutions. With
electronic communication becoming more ubiquitous and data storage
increasingly becoming cloud based, the need to secure data when using
these services is of utmost importance, there are tools which enable
users to take control of security into their own hands.

I will talk about the need to secure our data, and describe the basic
concepts behind public/private key cryptography, signing data,
encrypting data, and using GnuPG along with key pairs to perform all
these functionalities. I will cover the concepts more than cover the
tool itself; I will point to better documentation on how to use the
tools. The hope is that the documentation should be much easier to
follow when all the jargon I talk about is clear.

Expected talk duration: 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Speaker: Kumar Appaiah is a Ph.D. student of Electrical and Computer
Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, USA. Earlier, he was
a student of Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras, during which he
would regularly attend in ILUGC meetings and participate in some LUG
activities (like GNU Linux Vidyashram).

His primary interests in the FOSS world are free and open source tools
for design and implementation of digital signal processing and
communication systems. He occasionally contributes patches and
maintains packages for the Debian project.

Thanks for the ideas.

This will create more programmers and open source contributors.

All these efforts needs volunteers.
Anyone can start any discussion or activity here.

The events like FDP/seminars/workshops/sprints/Linux Demo
Days/Software Freedom day
are initiated any individual volunteer and we all support the activities.

We dont have many multiple small teams.
But we are a big team participating in various activities which impress us.

Let us hope for the more events in the upcoming days.
Again, we need volunteers.

Feel free to initiate any event, you can get a bunch of people to join with you.

Thanks.

Hi Hari,

You can try Lekhonee,
https://fedorahosted.org/lekhonee/

It is only for Wordpress and if you are on Ubuntu it's in the repositories.

Subject: [Ilugc] Monthly reminder on mailing list guidelines
Message-ID: <BANLkTim0K-uNLF=_q8S6pcpBKLY77XB-vQ@mail.gmail.com>

Mailing List Guidelines

1. English is the medium of communication in this mailing list, so use
only english in the mailing list. For people wanting to expressing
themselves in Tamil, ILUGC's Tamil mailing list exist. For joining ILUGC Tamil:
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/listinfo/ilugc.tamil

2. Use a proper subject line.

3. Do not troll in the mailing list

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll

4. Use [OT] for off-topic, non-technical discussions.
But, don't misuse this to start flame wars or to troll
in the mailing list.

5. Do not top-post:

Because it messes up the order in which
people normally read text.

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting

Example of a top-post:

> > Why is top-posting
> > such a bad thing?
Top-posting.
> > What is the most
> > annoying thing in e-mail?

Use interleaved, trimmed posting

Sure.

Check this example (Observing Time Application Form):

Bar Foo

6. Do not over-quote:

Example of an over-quote:

>>> On Friday you said
>>> blah blah blah
>> On Saturday you said
>> foo foo foo
> On Sunday you said
> foobar

7. Do not post HTML messages

8. Do not recycle messages

9. Do not send attachments

10. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical legal
disclaimers. If your company uses disclaimers, don't
use your company ID for the mailing list.

11. Do not reply to a digest. (If you are in digest
mode and want to reply to a post use ILUGC Gmane blog
interface.

Link:
http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc

12. Search for answers for your questions/problems in
any search engine before posting
your query to the mailing list.

13. Do not post messages in all capital letters. Mails
in CAPS is considered rude and is similar to shouting
during a conversation.

14. Following these guidelines could be helpful
http://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/

15. Don't send season's greetings or birthday or social networking site
invites to the group. Its not mailing list etiquette.

We must use the above guidelines to maintain better
readability, proper archives, efficient bandwidth
usage, etc.

This document has Tamil and English only, though.

There is no Galaxy mobile that I know of. And in the galaxy series there are
approximately 50 devices from Samsung. You need to mention which specific

Message-ID: <BANLkTimSV1gBDYrfsJ2T+tTSvyjPrnCWeA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All....

I use E-Com mobile phone model no TC-300(take this information as only a
refrence), Actually now a days all the latest mobile having SIP settings,Can
any one tell me how to set this.

WHAT I HAVE

I have asterisk server configured and working fine with SIP extensions and
SIP trunking.

Now it is not connected to Internet(I am waiting for the clarity in my
objective),but i can do that i no time (),currently it is only used for our
private activities ..


WHAT IS MY AIM

I need to configure one of my SIP extensions in a mobile phone( I not
particular about a model,any models configuration is OK for me  )


My ways

If we ask SIP setting to the GSM mobile operator they will give it or not ??

or We need to install some kind of application to mobile so that it can
connect to the server directly ???

if that is the case what may be application.....


Hope for your best support.....

Thanks and regards,

Gireesh

Following configuration in custom_config.inc.php works for me.

/**

Install?one of the custom ROMs from XDA developer's forum. Your phone
will have a Superuser app installed, using which you can run any
application as root user.  I use my self-customized ROM on my Galaxy

Main issue I faced was with using a different kernel. Try earlier
versions of the FuguMod kernel (for over and underclocking). Version
2.4 didn't work for me - but alpha 5 does work for some developers on
the XDA forum (Haven't tried it yet). Also, use Regina launcher - it
somehow makes the battery go longer. Caveat: the readability is not
very good on the 240 x 400 screen.

Hi all,


I am very happy being the part of this Open Source World since next
generation is boosted up with Open Source Technologies.

There are lot of happenings nowadays i could see in Linux and its Kernel.
The former and later has been the base for many new platforms today.

First it was RedHat and Debian, then came their very popular derivatives
Fedora and Ubuntu respectively, then came the biggest competitor of Iphone*
and Windows* mobile
" ANDROID ", the above mentioned were all based on the linux kernel which is
being an Open-source, except those starred.

And now its MEEGO, the new Operating System for Netbooks, Handhelds,
Electronic appliances, In-vehicle Infotainment,etc. which is developed based
on
Nokia?s Debian-based Maemo and Intel?s Fedora-based Moblin.  MeeGo is one of
the first Linux distributions to use the Btrfsfile system as default, and
uses RPM repositories.

It uses QT and Gtk for GUI development. And the Meego is released under GPL
license and Free Open Source Software. The SDK is also available in their
website which is free to download and develop.

World's Biggest and top Organisations finally understood the power of Open
Source and now it emerges as a Giant.

If you discover Helium today, it doesn't mean that others don't know
about it! You are new to it.

Free/Open Source has always been used widely. Just that people are not
aware of it.

Dear Mr. Shakti Kannan,

since the original poster seems to be a new user to FOSS, I think you
/ we should allow him to express his happiness, joy, feeling of
freedom, excitement.

I think the already-users, veterans of FOSS, should not make the new
poster to feel embarrassed. All he seems to do was expressing himself,
and maybe little bit over-enthusiastic.

You can guide him, and others like him, as you always used to, I have
seen & read your excellent blogs.  Keep it up.

If this is wrong, please forgive me - for my post.

thanks

with warm regards

Hi,
I am looking for a developer who will be working on all aspects of the site
built on Node.js that will be launched in early July.

What is in it for you :
- Learn async programming, building sites for scale, building a REST API,
and work on cool new technologies such as Node.js.
- You will get to work independently on bigger projects, and will get to
ship them to customers.
- We also encourage everyone in our company to contribute to open source
projects, esp. ones related to Node.js.

Experience:
We dont look at the number of years you have put in, but we do certainly
look for people worked on projects(and yes, your college project counts).

Skills:
Javascript, HTML, shell scripting.

Drop in a mail to me and we can take it further from there.

Dear Shakti Kannan,

I know you are a real veteran.

Newbies are supposed to make mistakes, so just correct it, without offence.

what we all should do it - i seemed to have seen mails by mr.
srinivasan, I think - "just welcome to the club" etc.

Maybe it will take new persons 2 to 3 years to get your level of
understanding on FOSS.

Please note above is about High availability (HA) cluster.

Never confuse it it with High Performance Cluster (HPC). There is one

We are launching a section of Muktware[1] called - Linux and Open Source 
Jobs. Under this section, you can search and apply for Linux and Open 
Source Jobs. If you are an employer or looking for full time employees, 
experts for contract-based projects, freshers and trainees, you can post 
job openings and find right candidates for your firm.

If you are an engineering student looking for Jobs in the Linux and Open 
Source industry, you can search for appropriate jobs and apply with one

The service is available for free of cost.

Why to advertise your jobs with Muktware?
Muktware has a massive reach in the global market, with a strong 
presence in India. So, your advertisements will reach out to a wider

Earlier, I asked you what would make the OP feel 'embarassed', and you
didn't answer that. Now you claim it was an 'offence'? What next? :)

I only replied to the OP correcting whatever was said. I'll stop here.

may be he means just redirect all the traffic from muktware to fossjobs.in ,
i see a synergy in this union but

Muktware would like to do this , i am afraid not ;-)

fossjobs.in has its own potential to monetize , if not directly then may be
through muktware


one way middle path is if fossjobs.in can give a white labelled site which
will integrate with muktware without its identity , so that muktware folks
maintain its brand and fossjobs,in folks power it , get into some  revenue
sharing model for maintaining this part of there service.

guys take it offlist and think over it .

Interesting. To be honest, I proposed that to FossJobs.in few months ago 
but did not hear back from them. I waited and then decided to go ahead. 
Also, Muktware will also cover US and EU market in addition to Indian. 
Where as FossJobs is India specific.

Muktware is also targeting global market, FossJobs.in is India specific. 
I am, once again, willing to work with your team. If you remember, I 
proposed that few months ago.

We can discuss off-list.

Subject: [Ilugc] dvorak and emacs
Message-ID: <1307580618.1998.641.camel@localhost>

hi,

into my second week with dvorak and still struggling. Brain is having a
big fight with decades of muscle memory. But getting there. The big
problem is emacs. I have added capslock as a control key - the problem
is that I want to swap 'u' and 'x' to make C-x easy to do. According to
the wiki, this is the procedure:

(keyboard-translate ?\C-x ?\C-u)
(keyboard-translate ?\C-u ?\C-x)

but it is not working. Another way is:

(global-set-key (kbd "C-u") ctl-x-map)

but this also does not work. Any clues will be appreciated.

        He was talking about the syntax to substitute a string with
another. Whether it is s/oldstr/newstr or s/newstr/oldstr. Thanks

it a gentle reminder that smsspeak is frowned upon in this group. The
long form is:

substitute 'you' for 'U'

it comes from one of those arcane languages popular among geeks in the
last century.

clarification: I simply put the above lines in .emacs. I have a feeling
that this is not enough - it needs more code to get it to work - can
someone give me a clue here please.

(global-set-key (kbd "C-u") (lookup-key global-map (kbd "C-x")))

Seemed to have worked.  I looked this up here:
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PrefixKey

Just in this case this helps you, (or someone else), the thing was
knowing that "C-x" is a prefix key. Trying out commands in the
*scratch* buffer.  You hit C-j and it will execute it immediately, so
you don't have to update .emacs and restart.  (It will still need to
go into .emacs if you want the change to persist.) ((Also, M-: allows
you to run expressions in Emacs)), and just in case you haven't
already run into these: "C-h f" to lookup help on functions, "C-h k"
to lookup what a keybinding does. "Emacs is the extensible,
customizable, **self-documenting** real-time display editor."

Weird. Emacs version?

And just to be clear you want to use C-u instead of C-x, right? So
you'd save a file with C-u C-s instead of C-x C-s.  (I'm guessing
dvorak makes the original keychord a contortionist's feat.)

OK - when I put it as the first line of .emacs file it works. I suppose
that lisp wants globals defined first?

ILUGC Monthly Meet (June 11 th):-
==============================

Venue: Classroom No 8,

==============================

1.
Topic: Public/Private cryptography with the GNU Privacy Guard

Description:

Authentication and security have always been important aspects in
deploying electronic communication and storage solutions. With
electronic communication becoming more ubiquitous and data storage
increasingly becoming cloud based, the need to secure data when using
these services is of utmost importance, there are tools which enable
users to take control of security into their own hands.

I will talk about the need to secure our data, and describe the basic
concepts behind public/private key cryptography, signing data,
encrypting data, and using GnuPG along with key pairs to perform all
these functionalities. I will cover the concepts more than cover the
tool itself; I will point to better documentation on how to use the
tools. The hope is that the documentation should be much easier to
follow when all the jargon I talk about is clear.

Duration: 1 Hr

Check  /etc/rsyslog.conf to find where mail is logged.  Typically, the
file(s) reside in the directory /var/log.

I also suspect you have not configured your MTA (smtp server)
properly.  The mail logs will give you more info.  If you are going to
be working with smtp servers then I suggest you familiarize yourself
with the servers's configuration files i.e. it may require RTFM (read
the fine manual) of the server.

Looks like you trying to send messages to ids outside your domain via
GMail relay.

Read up on how to setup relay via "smart host" in your MTA's documentation.

Hello Sir,

I got hold of your contact by scanning thru' some LUG forums. I have a
few Linux Kernel Hacking books (all recent editions and in excellent
condition), I have scanned thru' just a chapter or two, but couldn't
make good use of them. Now, I have to clear them from my bookshelf for
space as well as putting it to better purpose than aging in my
bookshelf.

Could you please let me know where I can sell or donate them where they
are useful. (I thought I will save some money by selling them, but then,
I'm happy enough if somebody actually uses the book properly).

It'd be great if you can point to any enthusiastic audience (LUG or
similar groups who may share the books from a library or so) who are
genuinely interested.

Thank you,
Krishna R
Bangalore

What do you mean by access the application by browser?

Do you mean file manager of the OS?

Very long ago I gave a talk in LUG and gave away all books I had for free.

You can sell them at a LUG meet but then people are generally less enthusiastic.

Your luck matters in that.

But if you give for free you will have no trouble at all.

DVDs can hold slideshows, movies or songs. There is a specific format
for each and
dvdauthor can help you.

But after all DVDs can also show raw files like USB sticks.

Your question is not very clear.

What do you want?

I've been running a pure 64-bit Ubuntu 9.04 since the time it's been
released. At the time, I saw a marginal increase in ffmpeg encoding
videos and an actual slight decrease in mencoder. This might be an issue
with w64codecs, but I'm not sure.

For most usage, the difference was really small. Performance advantages
are tiny, so you probably shouldn't change just for that reason. You can
even stick to 32-bit with the PAE kernel if you want to address more RAM
or get NX-bit support.

The repositories are nearly the same size. I haven't had trouble finding
any software I need and I've installed quite a few packages (`dpkg
--get-selections | wc -l` reports 1965 packages). 

I don't have Flash installed, but I did install it on a friend's 64-bit
install. They have an experimental version that works fine.

If you have proprietary graphics hardware, you still shouldn't be
worried if it's mainstream. I have installed both nvidia's drivers as
well as ati's fglrx with no trouble. There are minor quirks with both
where suspend will work imperfectly on some hardware, though.

If you're planning on installing 3rd party proprietary software, you
might be in for a bit of trouble, though. Some games I remember trying
didn't even release 64-bit versions, though IIRC, you could do something
by jumping through hoops and installing the equivalent of ia32-libs for
your distribution.

Essentially, the long and short of it is that upgrading lost me nothing
and gained me precious little. Do it if you feel like it.

True.

I have to force my 64 bit JVM to switch to 32 bit to run an application
which uses a 32 bit dylib. The original app developer never made a 64 bit
version.

On the desktop 64-bit is going to buy you little to nothing.

One area where you might run into issues is your wireless card.
Make sure your drivers are available if you have to use ndiswrapper.

One advantage of using 64 bit is :
Can allocate more than 2GB heap size for JVM if you are a Java programmer .
I think in servers 64 bit gives good performance

Applications are published as appliances - self sufficient with the
OS, libraries and et al.

You can extend this concept with a bootable DVD that launches your
application in a browser.

Not sure if this is what you are looking for.

DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #25 - 11th June 2011

It's Velocity and devopsdays next week and I'm guessing a fair few readers
will be going along. While you're enjoying all the glorious content take a
moment to think of everyone who can't make it - and blog and tweet like
crazy so we can keep up.


News
====

It turns out Puppet Labs employ a User Experience Designer, responsible for
making the command line, API's and the Puppet DSL as nice to use as they can
be. Too many designers miss the potential of command line utilities so this
is greta news.

http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/what-is-user-experience-in-puppet/

R.I.Pienaar (of mcollective fame) has been very busy this last week. First
releasing Hiera, a new hierarchal data store aimed at representing key value
data about infrastructure. The following two blog posts go into details
about how this can be used with puppet to keep manifests particularly clean
and reusable.

http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/06/05/hiera_a_pluggable_hierarchical_data_store.php

http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/06/11/puppet_backend_for_hiera_part_2.php

I've mentioned the growing #monitoringsucks movement in the last few issues.
John Vincent has written a good blog post summarising what's going on and
what he'd love to see come out of the group. The project now has repos for
tools, metrics best practice, irc logs and any blog posts written on the
subject.

http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/06/why-monitoring-sucks.html

Selenium is a handy tool, but running it in headless mode has often been
troublesome. This blog post demonstrates using PyVirtualDisplay, a Python
wrapper for Xvfb and Xephyr, to run your tests. If you're using Python this
looks very useful.

http://coreygoldberg.blogspot.com/2011/06/python-headless-selenium-webdriver.html

I found this article on the IBM Integrated Service Management Blog.
Describing devops as "simultaneously reassuring and terrifying" it's a
really interesting, and positive, insight from an experienced outsider. The
car analogy is a nice thought as well.

https://www-304.ibm.com/connections/blogs/59c1123b-0353-458e-a719-b002d84108d5/entry/devops_should_i_have_known_what_that_is1?lang=en_us


Tools
=====

Log.io looks an interesting tool for visualising log files in realtime in a
browser. It's a node.js application that you can host yourself, and it can
harvest log files from multiple machines and let you build up views of what
you want to see.

http://logio.org/

Vagrant is spawning a number of useful plugins, and snap is the latest. It
provides the ability to take snapshots of virtual machines and then restore
back to them, and it usefully supports multi-vm vagrantfiles.

https://github.com/t9md/vagrant-snap

chef.vim is plugin for vim using chef fans. It provides the ability to jump
between attributes and recipes and easily open recipes, templates and files
in your cookbooks.

Pay attention to how you format the links.  In the above lines, the
string "After" is part of the URL in my email client.

Over the years I have found, it pays to read the documentation
provided by the author(s) of the software aka RTFM (Read The Fine
Manual) vis-a-vis reading blogs and third parties who may not
understand the various nuances of the software well enough or the
settings may obsoleted by a newer version.

I am not an Exim user but I found their documentation comprehensive.

<http://www.exim.org/exim-html-current/doc/html/spec_html/index.html>

also available in PDF format.  I would suggest that you start with the
above doc.

It is data bus width matters on 32 vs 64.
Naturally we can have double the data in 64 bit? R/W 

Hence the 64bit systems will always do better
how ever, if you dont allocate all variables to 64 bits then segregating the data from 64 bit for various variables will? eat? more time, while compiler designates values to variables after R/W of 64 with non uniform variable declaration....

I want also to know is there any graphics drivers required to utilize the

Yes if you have graphics card in your system you have to install the
Additional Drivers for them to be in effect.
Try this System -> Administration -> Additional Drivers.

Note: Since you are using 11.04, you can type Additional Drivers in Search
bar of Unity Menu that you get when you press the Windows Hot key.
or else login with Classic Ubuntu Desktop and install it.

Laptop models have their own idiosyncrasies.  My experience with an
Acer 5542, circa Dec. 2009; it did not play well with Ubuntu and
Fedora but worked fine with openSUSE.

I suggest you try a couple of other Linux distros like Fedora,
openSUSE and settle with the one that works for your model.
Additionally, you may want to file a bug report with Ubuntu.

The information you have given is not sufficient.  List out the
hardware details.

Without mentioning what graphics chipset you have, it is a wild guessing game.

Take a look at the out put of "lspci" and report the graphics card chipset.

I doubt if you can do that with apt-get. You can however use "download only"
option which will download the packages. You can install them manually
thereafter. For dpkg, there is an --ignore-depends=pkg1,... option. But I
don't think it does what you want.

What are you trying to achieve?

64 bit Linux generally has problems with  flash. Try the 32 bit version.

You have to use crontab for the periodic operations.

Subject: [Ilugc] Need help on Configuring OpenERP-Client
Message-ID: <BANLkTimSLyE-mPR-=cYv5DZE66MK-d9pWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,

I Installed OpenERP-Server & OpenERP-Client with the help of
http://doc.openerp.com/v6.0/install/linux/index.html this link.
My OpenERP-Server is starting without any errors, whereas while starting the
OpenERP-client i got some errors
in Server console (i.e)

/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/openerp-server/tools/misc.py:750:
DeprecationWarning: BaseException.message has been deprecated as of Python
2.6
  if hasattr(e, 'message'):
/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/openerp-server/tools/misc.py:751:
DeprecationWarning: BaseException.message has been deprecated as of Python
2.6
  return ustr(e.message)

In Client login Window, error is occured in the place of database which is
"Could not connect to Server!" Also a warning
in Client Console (i.e)

WARNING:translate:Unable to set locale en_IN.ISO8859-1

I am using pgadminIII. In the link they recommended to edit the file *
~/.openerprc*, But i don't know what changes should be
done in the place of login section to get the connection success. The link
also nothing mentioned about that, some piece of
lines in that file.

[login]
db =
login = admin
protocol = socket://
port = 8070
server = localhost

Also I tried

[login]
db = databasename
login = admin
protocol = socket://
port = 5432
server = localhost

Still the problem remains, Kindly suggest an ideas to solve this problem.

Thanks in Advance.

Hi,
 Have you configured postgresql correctly for openerp, the username in
postgres should match the system user name if not create using the below
command.

login as postgres user

$sudo su - postgres
give the password for the user

$createuser --createdb --username postgres --no-createrole --pwprompt user

change "user" to ur user name in system

First explain what it is that you are trying to achieve.

Packaging systems have a purpose; one of them is to keep your
installation in a sane state.

It is not advisable to take a DEB package from one distro (e.g.
Ubuntu) and try to install it in Debian just because both have the DEB
packaging system.   The same applies for distros based on RPM
packaging.

Each distro has it's own set up package dependencies and it is not
advisable to break the dependencies.


Also, do not cross post such type of queries that will likely generate
responses.  You may be a member of all the groups but members of the
respective groups are not necessarily present in other groups.  In
such case, you should take the time to summarize the responses and
post them to all the groups.

Subject: [Ilugc] Creating live graphs for system parameters
Message-ID: <BANLkTinVZvfUbky7eqJqMLGXNwqn=8+Oig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi friends,

I want to implement a web page (namely dashboard) which includes
various parameters (CPU usage, Network usage, Memory usage, etc ) from
different systems and those parameters will be shown in graphs in the
web page at server side. This will be like system
monitoring graphs. So i need to fetch the informations from different
systems and then have to show them in graphs. When i searched through
web, i came across a tool, UTM (Unified Thread Management). This tool
comes with a web interface which meets the above requirements. But it
comes as .iso file, so we have to install it and we couldn't use any
other packages with that. It's something like installing a new OS. So
i need your ideas, opinions for
implementing this.


P.S - Previously i pull these parameters using snmp and display them
as MRTG graphs. But that's not look like a dashboard. snmp-MRTG gives
only static picture. But the requirement is  to give it like an animated graphs,
so that it will give a real time look.

If your end objective is achieving something like

munin.

It appears you are doing rsync over the network right?  How many
*simultaneous* rsync sessions do you have going?

I faced a similar error with ssh connections in my LAN and found out
that it was due to IP address conflict as I was using static addresses
in the LAN.

Hi to all,

Recently, I installed Ktouch in my ubuntu 10.04. I saw that there is no
keyboard layout for our locale Tamil. Hence i decided to add, with some
guide-lines i edited "English" keyboard layout. I saved that file in the
name of tamiltest.keyboard.xml at /usr/share/kde4/apps/ktouch/.

After restarting the Ktouch i got that layout in Keyboard Layouts. But when
i type means that tamil characters is not typing. I also checked it by
replacing characters in english itself

For example: In the place of key a: i placed 'z'(90), and in the place of
key b: i placed 'x'(88). It also not working

Kindly get me out from this.

I am using Ubuntu 10.04. I need to block removable media to be mounted from
my system. No one should mount removable media except root user.

1. I tried Disabling automount and changed the permission of media
directory. Even then if i go to places and click on media, it automatically
mounts
and get open.

How to prevent is. I need only to use mount command to mount an external
removable media.

Hi Rajesh,
     Try this, do the steps as follows.

1)Add this line "blacklist usb_storage" to the end
of /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

2)Add this line "modprobe -r usb_storage" before exit 0 in /etc/rc.local

Now restart your system.

To Mount USB device use the following command,

$sudo modprobe usb_storage

To Unmount the USB device, use "safely remove drive" by right click on the
device, then run the below command.

$sudo rmmod usb_storage

Hope this will be helpful for you!!

Check out rdiff-backup, it's far better than rsync for backups.

In debian only members of group "plugdev" can mount usb storage devices. Add only whom you want in this group. I think ubuntu should also be same. You can try.

I tried doing shutdown -h now - but never used it with sudo.

Thanks once again,  but is there any solution for shutting down using
'shutdown' in the menu.  Is there some thing wrong in my installation.

could anyone let me know.

Good one :)

Dear Ganesh Apt has a role to perform thats resolving dependencies .

 dpkg on the other hand can be used to install plackages but still it
asks for dependent packages. you could use
It has a option --ignore-depends=packagename
Ignore dependency-checking for specified packages (actually, checking
is performed, but only warnings about conflicts are given, nothing
else).

Having said that like all the people I would still suggest you not to
mess up with your machine by avoiding some packages . do you have an
internet connection problem or something is wrong with apt
configuration . First fix that issue by wither getting an offline repo
or asking the exact issue .

Regards,
Pavithran

It was a great meet to get most of the old ILUGCians like Bharathi
Subramanian, Kumar Appiah, Thyagarajan, Ravi Jaya etc.
Hall was filled with old faces and new faces, counting 32 as the participants.

Kumar explained the basics of cryptography. Alice, Bob and Eve played
the roles in the play.
Public key and private key mechanism was explained well. Kumar
narrated the concepts of
authentication, authorization using the keys. He explained how can we
secure our emails
using signatures and GPG keys.

Since, Cryptography is a great ocean, he explored it from the
seashore, on how to live a safer digital life.

Next, Arun SAG, started the Fedora 15 Release Party. Snack and Drinks
are served.

He explained the new systemd service, which replaced the init to start
the services in parallel.
He demonstrated the gnome 3 and its features.
Then he invited for the Fedora Users Developers Conference FUDCon.
Audience shot many questions and Arun answered them all with patience.

Here is the presentation.

Please trim your quotations.

Broken pipe - is an indication of network connectivity problem between
your location and the VPS data center.

Most likely the problem is at your end i.e. your Internet connection
has random dropouts - common problem with local cable Internet
providers to tier 2 providers.

Most applications (tcp) retry to establish the connection but not indefinitely.

Check the error log for mysql.

As the query takes a long time to run, check for the options for
longer timeout value in mysql.

Also try this command in Terminal:

2. Reboot command:- " sudo reboot "

MySql's subquery performance is not that great, esp. for large tables.

You could try running the query by joining the two tables.

Also an index on the fields you are joining will also help.

It would be good if you could spend a little more time in your email,
and make it formal. You shouldn't be using SMS/Chat language in this
kind mailing lists. Rest assured, you will be ignored/ banned when you
try again.


On testing; there isn't anythign specific to manual testing (aka
Functional testing) of web applications. For testing any application,
web/ native, you start with a Test Strategy and a test plan followed
by a test case for every possible scenario. Each test case will have a
collection of steps. These steps indicate every action that you do.
For example (user logon):
1. Open the home page of the applicaiton in FireFox
2. Enter XYZ as the user name
3. Enter ABC as the password
4. Validate that the application refuses to log you in
5. Validate that when you type this URL <<http://<your
server/admin.php>>, it refuses to show the page,as you are not logged
in.

You pick up the scenarios from your requirements documents (Use cases,
user stories, etc..) and make sure that you have covered all the
scenarios.


if you are a part of an existing team, they will already have a
template for each of the aforementioned documents. if you are looking
for guidelines for acadamic purposes, you have a tonne of search
engines, that can help you out.

Subject: [Ilugc] Tamil Keyboard Layout for KTouch
Message-ID: <BANLkTikmFV05BFJoPsprGHQCtjiXqpcKmA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello to all,

KTouch <http://www.kde.org/applications/education/ktouch/> is an program to
improve our typing skill in all Languages. it has a feature of improving
level to different kind people like school students, college students, like
that. If we keep touch with KTouch we don't need to see the Keyboard while
typing. Also it gives exercise to all the Fingers instead of using Two
fingers usually.

I saw that the absence of Keyboard layout for Tamil i added it successfully.
Before they include that Layout in KTouch, we can practice by adding it
manually.

For this we have to add tamil Keyboard Layout in Our machine.
Here<http://gnubala.wordpress.com/2011/06/14/adding-tamil-keyboard-layout-in-ubuntu/>i
have shown for Ubuntu 10.04 Machine it will help you. Now we can
install
KTouch, Debian based users Go for *# apt-get install ktouch*. After
installation, its the time to add tamil keyboard layout. There is no Tamil
Keyboard layout exists in Ktouch, for that we have to add it manually.
http://ubuntuone.com/p/zJN/  This link helps you to download Tamil Keyboard
Layout Which is Created by myself.

The Downloaded File consists of Tamil Layouts and Tamil Exercises to
practice. That Tamil Exercises are taken from Mr. Shakthimaan Kannan's
Website which is
http://www.shakthimaan.com/ta/downloads/computer/typing-1.0.tar.bz2 I would
like to thank him for the exercises.

Now copy the layouts and paste in the location : *
/usr/share/kde4/apps/ktouch* (These Directories will be created after
installation of KTouch). To Practice Tamil typing import the txt files to
KTouch. There are 15 Lessons in Tamil Exercise directory, after completing
these lessons we can type Tamil Without seeing the keyboard.

For Screenshots and More Explanations on Using KTouch-Tamil Keyboard Layout
Kindly go to =>
https://gnubala.wordpress.com/2011/06/15/added-tamil-keyboard-layout-in-ktouch/

Hope that hereafter you will learn to type tamil and avoid using
Transliteration. :)

Thank You.

It is a great contribution.

I was looking for a typing tutor for tamil for a long time.

Ktouch works as a charm for tamil keyboard layout.

Thanks a lot.

Did you give the keyboard layouts and lessons to the KDE community
so that they can add them as a part of KTouch ?

Wishes.

Does this query works for lesser no of Records?

Please avoid using subquery, it will take lot of your CPU and MEM hence
leads to connection loss. Use joins instead, or try temporary table( My
Recommendation better than join).

Index the table for better performance.

Sir,

Can we use it in gnome also, or is it only for KDE.

- also, is it compatible with T-91 (I think).

in any case, thanks for this new way of doing things, easily.

Slightly off-topic from what you asked. :D

In case you are looking at a long-term relationship with the GCC
toolchain, on different platforms, then you might want to get yourself
handy with 'gas' syntax.

Saw the application. Good Work!

But I would like to know the real world application though. Why Should be
notified via e-mail when you can see the download status at the browser
window itself?

May be something like leaving the system ON when going outside for large
downloads?

Kindly explain..

The real application would be as you said , if you go out while a
large download is going on .

You could set the Email address to your Facebook id , in which case
Facebook  might send you an sms .

May be you could also connect your account to Way2sms , in which case
also you might get an Sms .

I think you can tweet your self with this .

The rest is left up to your Imagination !

Quick thoughts:

#001 Why do you commit .swp and .pyc files? Git only tracks changes in content.

#002 Add a LICENSE file indicating the license under which the sources
are released.

#003 Add a copyright, header notice in each source file.

#004 Run pylint on your *.py and fix the warning/error messages.

#005 Any reason to have not used json? You have commented its import
in python/register.py

  http://docs.python.org/library/json.html

#006 Please follow PEP8 guidelines. For example: "class names use the
CapWords convention". Try to be consistent across your source files.

Wow thanks a lot for the Suggestions,

You actually took some time to review the Code !!

#1 : Sorry for committing .swp and .pyc files , I am new to Git , so i
am just now getting the hang of it . Will try to remove it in the next
Commit

#2 : I plan to release it Under Gnu GPL , but any Suggestions on that
are welcome.

#3 : Ya sure Will Add it in the next Commit

#4 : I was actually in a Hurry to get this up and Running , I Have
another main Project ,
This was done during a  break and I had Less than 12 hrs to come with
the idea , Implement it , and check if it works .

#5 : Actually I designed it using Json. but GAE doesn't have a Json
encoder as its using Python 2.5 ,
But I forgot that I can import Simple Json so
 thats why I put it in the Repo , I'll add Json Support in the next Commit

#6 : Ya I agree , I have to do that , When I am coding html ,
JavaScript , and python , I seriously get confused with naming
standards  .

You can add these file extensions to .gitignore file to make git ignore them
from tracking them.

This is a strange way to call for commercial vendors. Especially since
the points, in sequence, are completely off. And, if there is indeed a
migration planned, the parameters, SLA etc go un-mentioned.

Not actually I personally know person who have experience of designing the
CBSE result website back-end at the time when he is in class 10th or so,
found vulnerabilities in SBI website at a time when he is in class 12th or
so and fixed it , working for UIDAI on secured XMMP protocol at a time when
is in 3rd year of engineering.

PS : Feel free to conform it through Narendra if you don't believe me.

Note : Their is a mailing list of Indian FOSS teen maintained by Narendra ,
just to their once , and you will find many school going children their who
will satisfy the statement "Yahoo! is looking for a fresher with strong
experience with Open source"

.... snip ....

I wonder why Yahoo! is using "personal" email ids to post their jobs.
Can the veracity of the job announcement be corroborated?

Personally, I am very suspicious of such postings.

<sidenote>

I would be extremely impressed if I could find a fresher with the
skill sets set out in the forwarded announcement.

Not that it is not possible but .... then with that kind of experience
under my belt I would not be interested in a "fresher" job :D

</sidenote>

A: Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.
Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
A: Top-posting.
Q: What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?

I know its a bit off topic and really subjective.

How many people have actually found a great job/person via the job postings
made on the list.

Please note, I have made a fair share of exclusive job postings myself over
the years, but haven't found anyone myself.

Just out of curiosity I want to know how effective the job postings on the
list.

It will certainly reduce the job postings mail in the list, if its not
effective.

This is really an effective medium. I joined my previous employer via
these job posting, for the same employer when I posted a job
requirement, we got a huge resume pool from which we were able to get
the right talents.

Message-ID: <BANLkTik1xY4SV7f1jA1Thej6yM_oLAyoog@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just wanted to know is there any Linux development is going on for
building a system that supports both RPM and DEB packages to be used in a
single Distribution without use of other tools like alien. It should support
both packages on the same distro. Is there any thing under development like
this or already developed.

Sorry if my questions is wrong.

Nowadays Network manager can do that. How are you connecting your phone and
the computer (usb cable/bluetooth) ? What is the version of ubuntu you are
using?

Depends on what kind of tools you are looking for. Look up for any

Message-ID: <BANLkTik-AsWUcwqFkDw8Aakz367qk180AA@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

On Jun 18, 2011 TamilNadu Govt announced a Tender for
"9 lakh" free laptops for the students.

Here is the Tender Notice :
http://www.tenders.tn.gov.in/pubnowtend/uploaded/TD_elc58921_tn_laptop_scheme.pdf

http://epaper.dinamalar.com/PUBLICATIONS/DM/MADHURAI/2011/06/18/Article/009/18_06_2011_009_006.jpg

Page 57 in the pdf says that

Operating System : Preloaded Dual booting - Windows starter edition
with Anti Virus for
1 year license and Linux.


These laptop should be loaded with only free open source software and
proprietary software should not be used.

How can we suggest the TN Govt to avoid the proprietary software ?

Please share your thoughts.

If the windows costs min 1000 INR,
9,00,000 * 1,000 = 90,00,00,000

90 Cr rupees will be given to Microsoft.

If we use Gnu/Linux, we can save the 90Cr.

Not to mention the cost of the anti-virus. It definitely wouldn't be free
either

For school students, school OS would ideal I guess-it's based on Ubuntu and
comes with a lot of softwares pre-installed.

Convincing to use GNU/Linux:
1. Perhaps it could be pointed out that experience with open source would
greatly enhance the skill of students, specially college students, and
enhance chances of getting a job?
2. Tamil software and educational content all exist in the open source
domain No need for additional software(these might be proprietary too).
3. Anti-virus license would have to be renewed after a year-no student would
do that; instead they would use pirated versions mostly.
4. And of course, the obvious truth-more than 100 Cr would be spent for
sure-a colossal waste IMO.

This needs some attention-the due date is 8th July as said in page 14. Not
very far away.

Hi All

I think it is time to act. Wee can prepare a letter to CM , IT Minister and
Director ELCOT Tamilnadu pointing the facts discussed here.
We have to make it happen with in this week time so that the authorities
will get enough time to revise the notifications.

We need to schedule a meeting asap with

the Chairman of Elcot's IT Department - Dr.Santhosh Babu, IAS (Phone:
+91-44-65512332)

OR with

Managing Director of Elcot Mr. Atul Anand, IAS (Phone:
+91-44-42152200, +91-44-65512330)


to explain the Government's cost savings with FOSS and how ILUGC could
help them.

My thoughts on this subject

a.ELCOT is already aware of FOSS benefits. 
b.Role of voluntary organisation like us is very limited
c.Since this is going to be a business decision which involves not only software but such other things like service support etc. only commercial entities can do something at this stage. Companies like RedHat, Canonical are the ones coming to my mind.

Hi

May a mass mailing to <cmcell at tn.gov.in> to go for fully Linux laptops?

I used to get few things done (like repair of roads) by sending
complaints to this Chief Minister's ID. Of course, those were the
times of Ms Jayalalitha's previous tenure, things were prompt.

Maybe we could give a try in the capacity of  common citizens ?

But still we can raise our concern in this subject. Ans we can give a
detailed letter stating the facts and profits that govt will earn through
adopting FOSS.

Still I think here also the community can do a lot. We can train the
teachers on FOSS tools installation, trouble shooting etc.. Even local LUGS
can act as support agencies in the case FOSS related tools(Even they can opt
for paid support).

              Such a stupid waste of money to install the laptops with
propreitary software. Since July 8 is the deadline, the first thing is to
schedule the meeting with the officials as proposed by Shrinivasan. Those
who are in India can do this..

I live abroad.  What i did is I created a page on facebook very quickly..
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Say-NO-to-Windows-and-proprietary-software-to-the-TamilNadu-Government/192009807515360

<http://www.facebook.com/pages/Say-NO-to-Windows-and-proprietary-software-to-the-TamilNadu-Government/192009807515360>Now
if more users join and write their resentment, we can show this as a solid
evidence to what they are doing is not wise..

Tasks:
1) Add information with proper links on the walls of this page.
2) recruit more users
3) May be a better logo??

Lets get going.. Now come on. I am waiting to see you guys as supporters on
the page..

regards,
*Manikandan.B*

I think it would definitely be beneficial to have the meetings with
ELCOT Director and IT Secretary. It would also be good to issue press
releases to all major media channels - print+visual.

In Kerala for similar government level decisions what we (FSUG-Tvm)
have done in the past have been to meet with and present an open
letter to the relevant authorities. The copy of such letters were also
released to the media along with the press release.

Like mentioned earlier in the thread we will have limitations in what
we can get done but the facts can be put out there, especially to the
public. Additionally I would think that large IT companies might
actually be happy to offer support on GNU/Linux installed machines if
they can get a bulk order of 900,000 laptops and perhaps the cost of
the proprietary software towards an extended AMC.

In Kerala, we have seen results in some cases and none in some others
but in almost all cases the points raised were covered by the media.
So even if nothing comes out of the effort towards the context it
would help in  educating the public about the options available and
implications in such matters.

Thanks
Anoop

For what its worth, you can't even install visual studio 2010 express
edition (which is free) on a Windows (xp/Vista/7) starter OS.

The law may make the Service Center to be set up, but does everyone go to
it? (Why travel 1hr when my next house friend can do it?) I never met a
person who serviced his TV in any Govt mandated service center (If at all
such a one exists).

So my thought is that Even if we make the Govt to go for FOSS; Will the
users be ready?

Think of playing Games in Linux. I bet thats the first thing most school
children would do. So I think we are just pushing the expenditure away from
govt and towards the children making the money to flow away from single Co
to local service centers and such.

I think most of you would also at sometime be approached for ** repairing **
the ** useless ** laptop and make it ** workable **( Read as "reformatting"
the "Linux" and make it "boot Windows"). Don't read me wrong, but thats what
most people think and would do.

this is not a big money for microsoft. they will even give windows for Free.
microsoft might earn indirectly. Students get used to windows and when they
go to work, they expect windows everywhere. companies pay microsoft for
licenses of their softwares.

9 Lakh students learning windows.... or computer?
i am not sure how did government decided the laptop configuration and the
associated software without taking inputs from students....!!

What are the rules here ? Can the kids just sell the laptop and buy a 
gaming system ??

I think it is necessary to innovate here.

One idea is to hardware lock (say via a custom BIOS ??) the system into 
a single supported distro of Linux. They would have to carry the unit to 
a service centre to unlock it and install anything else - at which point 
they have to provide their student ID.  Such checks are needed to 
maximize benefits of tax payer money.

In case of Govt of India Purchase under DGS & D rate contract pre-installed linux systems costs Rs.5860 less than equivalent Windows PC. This is for Redhat Desktop edition.

What I meant here is: Nobody (children) would dream of playing games in a
Linux system and would surely try to get their systems Game Compatible
(Windows). Anyways, even if the govt adopts Linux, Will the children who use
it?

So IMHO if LUG makes govt accept Linux only systems, it can be said a
technical win for FOSS, but there would be no real benefits in real world.
The migration to Windows would happen at any point.

If such a thing happens, you will end up making a political mistake of
giving "Useless" systems to school children and cheating people. The
opposition would argue that why can't government give "good" systems by
spending just extra 1K for a 20-30K product and instead "cheat" people in
giving "substandard and useless" system. Believe me that is sure to be said.

The other side (left) can argue that govt is promoting an American mega 
corporation while FOSS alternatives are available.

Hi Friends

  Have you used Janrain Engage or Gigya Socialize for Drupal - for
increasing your social presence? Your reviews are appreciated. Would you
recommend using them?

  There are individual FREE drupal modules for each facebook, twitter, etc.
- which means separate development effort and testing effort on each.
Instead of focusing on developing such a feature one at a time for each
facebook, twitter, etc., if there is a module to take care of everything
social for FREE, that would be great.





Thanks.

The Government of Kerala had moved to GNU/Linux based IT curriculum in
all public schools quite a while back (5-6 years I think). So
government schools across Kerala uses GNU/Linux as the platform for IT
education. I think this transition has been rather smooth and well
implemented.

Now very recently I came across a CBSE class 9 IT text book and saw
that 2/3 of the content in the text book was openoffice and GNU/Linux
OS. Not sure if this was a decision by the school authorities or
whether this was a national roll out.

Given these I definitely think that it should be possible to have a
state level roll out of GNU/Linux based laptops to students especially
given the possibility that it would be the first opportunity for a
large number of these students to be owning/using a computer. So if
they start using GNU/Linux I would think they would naturally become
comfortable with that (and the games available there, also don't
forget Fedora games spin).

Cheers
Anoop

Friends.

We have to contact the TN govt officials to discuss about the OS in
the free laptops.
We need a writeup describing the need of linux OS and why windows
should not be pre-loaded.

I request you to create a detailed writeup, so that we can share in
the press, online media and submit to the government.
I started here.

Please help on creating  a nice writeup.

In the Rate Contract the price is for hardware+Windows os+Anti-Virus - bundle. Separate option is given where pre-loaded Linux can be ordered instead of Windows. If this option is exercised then the price is less (yes I mean it less).

I have tried to put in the outline content as much as possible, but I think
the letter wouldn't bear much value in its current state, we need to include
Pricing details and Savings in terms of Facts and Figures using suitable
charts and other info graphics. Only then would it be of more worth.

Hence, if anyone has the corresponding data, post it or still better, make a
chart to be included in the letter. Or if you donot have the time to work
post it as a shared Google Doc, I or someone might use the data to create
required chart.

Those who know the figures kindly post it.

Subject: [FSFTN] Petition: Request to drop proprietary software from the
free laptops to be distributed by the government to students of Tamil Nadu
To: mailinglist at fsftn.org


Dear Friends,

The Government of Tamil Nadu have decided to implement the scheme of free
distribution of laptops to students studying Government and Government
aided Schools and Colleges, and released a tender to procure 9,12,000 of
laptops for the same.

By the tender reference: ELCOT/PID/ICB/LTC/PI/2011-12, government wants
Proprietary Software to be installed.

The decision to include Proprietary OS in the laptops will have a huge
impact both on cost and effectiveness of its use in education. There are
9,12,000 laptops being ordered for distribution. Assuming a basic cost of
Rs1,000/- per system for the OS license, we find that it will cost the
exchequer a whopping 91.2 crore. Incidentally the anti-virus software (the
'twin brother' of MS Windows) is offered as part of the package for just 1
year. This implies that the student will have to either pay to renew the
license every year or use a pirated version. Given the weak financial
situation of a vast majority of students, especially in rural parts of the
State, it is most likely that they would would opt for latter, a highly
unethical and unsafe practice. There is also a question mark as to how and
where students are expected to renew licenses or anti-virus software.
Besides, Microsoft provides support for its products only for a stipulated
period; there is no comment on how students would get the assistance once
the product is officially withdrawn from market.

It is well known now that GNU\Linux can perform all the functions any
proprietary OS can do and much more. Most of these laptops will be used
mainly to read/edit word documents, browse the internet, multimedia
purposes, etc.. All these functions can be accomplished with ease by the
available GNU\Linux distributions. Many more educational software are
produced by the FOSS community in GNU\Linux platform than any proprietary
companies. It is worth mentioning that there are even GNU\Linux
distributions available for educational purposes which are packed with lot
of software packages required for eduction.

So, please sign the petition to give free open source software for the
younger generation of Tamil Nadu.

Greetings,

One small point:

Please remind them that even when matchbox ix bought, (inclusive of
all taxes) appear. Which means One should remind that the government
should remember that this request is coming from people who are paying
for all the Municipal/statr/central govt.pensioners, Hence we are
theier salary payers. and that may perhaps pinch somebody.

A little "manyu" rightful indignition is perfectly necessary.

Best of luck

Considering almost every user will format the computer and install a pirated
version of Windows anyways (I could not get my wife to work in Linux because
she could not get a small windows game to work in Linux) I think it is the
best practical option to have both.

   - It is amazing that the tender calls for  dual boot systems with Linux
   also pre installed - This means that probably they are looking at
   a curriculum based on it.
   - Interested students will learn Linux. There is no use forcing students
   to use Linux. I am Linux fan now. I love vi now. But I remember 15 years
   back when it was forced on me I hated vi.

Why reinvent something that's already there? Creation of some totally new
Linux architecture is a mammoth task and IMO a totally unnecessary one.
People choose distros that best suit their needs. A package manager is just
a piece in the OS architecture. As long as you have something that gives you
a quick and easy way of installing packages, you should be fine. If not, you
always have more ( powerful ) ways of doing that, like compiling from source
!

I just got an idea , if a system is developed that supports both RPM and Deb
packages then the list of available packages will be more by merging from
both repositories.

If developing a system is difficult one can this be achieved by developing a
installer that supports both?
If nothing can be done on this case, i request to please tell me.
I wanted to know whether it is feasible or not.

Yes sir, i have used Alien that converts rpm to deb. But for me not all the
conversions are successful. Some packages are not successfully converted.
And also my question was other than these converters. Am looking for such
things exist already, if not let me make a study on it and would like to
develop such a thing. So i require help from you all Geeks.

That is great . Magazines like this will also serve for the campaign.

If this can topic can be taken to Dinamalar Tamil daily newspaper, surely it
will reach 80% of people of TamilNadu.
Media will help i hope.

This produced a random thought in my mind. When Open Source is all about
freedom, why force Linux on students and abstain them from opting for
Windows? I think a linux only system not about freedom, its about FOSS
injection/marketing whatever. "Linux" is the new "Windows".

May be a dual boot is the real freedom from students view. Isn't it ?

I can only assume that the Chennai Linux community is so shocked by
such statements that there is no one replying or they're actually busy
with writing letters to the government.
I'm bad at comparisons and generalizations, but its like saying 'why
stop giving free alcohol and force them to have only free healthy
food?'

Please do some research on Microsoft & the Windows operating system
before saying that 'Linux is the new Windows'

Let's first think over what deb's and rpm's are:
They are a way of managing the software the software that goes into your system.

Each distribution has their own nuances of packaging. Though there
have been efforts to standardize it but it hasn't achieved much
success as there are lot of philosophical, historical, man power,
commercial, etc differences in various distributions. Consistency is
not guaranteed among the rpm's of two different different
distributions, and so for deb's as well.
And then why just stick to rpm and deb? Why not other package maangers
like pacman and emerge?
In the end these are just ways of managing what goes in and out of
your system. It does not matter whether the system is rpm, deb, manual
as long as the administrator is proficient at managing it.

The laptops are meant for govt and govt aided school students - students
from the less privileged class. Many of them will be trying for a job soon
after school. Knowing Windows will certainly make them better positioned to
land a job. IMO, its a pragmatic move from the govt!

Wrong, if you want them to goto jobs, You better invest the money on
teachers/school infrastructure, good practical oriented syllabus. Most
students will play games/watch movies or sell the laptop to some others for
a good price.

I am not into the power circles or professional contacts, but I do my bit to
contribute to Open Source and spread FOSS enthusiasm. If you have any
doubts, go over to the public note where the letter is being drafted and
user 'arunmozhi' contribution. http://sync.in/letter-to-tngovt . and also
browse over to the thread regarding Press Release. You can see that I am
helping my bit.

just trying to remind people that most of us who are working now on Linux
started with Windows for learning computers (I know there wasn't a second
choice at that time), so know that windows isn't a bad thing, but that Linux
is a better thing.

Dual booting isn't going to harm anyone! I said we shouldn't force Linux on
people like Windows was once done (in above context), that way Linux would
become the "new" windows. I hope every linux user would accept that Linux
shouldn't be forced, but just be given as a choice and that is what FOSS is
all about "Freedom to choose and use" as we like to.

I agree. Dual booting gives more freedom of choice than single booting
Linux. Windows/Linux both are required especially if their curriculum
includes both. Doesn't that make sense. Imagine a curriculum with a
few chapters dedicated to Windows and the students have laptops with
Linux only. IMO, if there should be a complete removal of Windows, it
should start from the curriculum and only after that removed from the
laptops.

Does anyone know if the current curriculum has excluded Windows
completely? If it has been excluded completely, then I agree that
single booting Linux totally makes sense.

Subject: [Ilugc] Looking for Cost Effective IVR Solution for Concurrent Calls
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=TLxCRTxkJ-B5nO92YVcGOpBtp0A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am working to develop an IVR solution for an NGO in Tamil Nadu, India
using Freeswitch open source telephony interface.

I am looking for any cost effective solution for hardware where concurrent
inbound/outbound calls can be made by the IVR system. Some research, I did
but I am skeptical, need some more guidance from experts. Number of
concurrent calls for initial stage inbound 5-10 but based on response from
the community, we will plan for scaling up. Outbound Scheduled calls are of
lesser importance right now.

I checked online that PRI line provides me 30 lines for voice which can be
used concurrently. But, the rent for the line is very high which cant be
feasible for the NGO.
Min PRI line cost is Rs 4.5 K per month.

Please suggest alternative solutions which I can use for the same.

1. What about VOIP  and using their local access number?
2. What about SIP based IP phone with extensions?
3. What about trunk lines, DID etc?
4. What about GSM Modems, GSMOpen?

I am very new telecom technology. Please help.

Thanks
Ankit

There is a serious discussion going on about the free laptops and what it should(/not) contain. As per tender specification it will certainly have Linux. I am sure the version the vendor will load will be bland -devoid of most educational tools. I think whatever may be our effect in fighting proprietary software in this venture - success or failure, we can do a positive contribution. 

My idea is to create tool/cd/whatever_we_call_it which can add good educational software and material on these laptop. It can have free materials like books, wikipedia pages etc. It should be very simple for anybody to install it.

I have created a wiki page for it.

We can start the actual packaging work only on knowing which distro will be loaded and about the specification of the laptop. So we can start discussing what packages to install and specification for creating a tool which will install them all in a single click.

Message-ID: <BANLkTik=ec=mFe7YfnY5F7inXe9mx+m4oQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to unmount the usb device and make it mount only when root mount
it.

I am using Ubuntu 10.04

1. I disabled automounting using gconf-editor.
2. I made the /media drive with read permission even then the usb gets
mounted, but the drive is not visible.
3. I black listed the usbstorage module, then it is not even attempting to
find the device.

Here is my requirement,
I am developing an application that manages external drives.
When a user plugs any usb storage, it prompts the administrator ie the
server.
Only the administrator can mount the device either in read mode or in write
mode.

I was successfull in alerting the administrator but still fails in mounting.

By disabling automount and using the step 2. I can make the device cant be
seen but not mount.
The problem is that the device is getting mounted if i click the icon
present in places>8gb drive etc. so how can i prevent mounting device even
if it is clicked.

Well, get some facts

# As per the current School Syllabus of TN, we can not exclude MsWindows
# Students are interested to learn Linux
# Students will not Leave MsWindows
# Most of the students will use pirated software of MsWindows and
applications
# Giving Linux only laptops will give "bad image" among parents
# Not all the Laptops will be used by the students [ free cycles are sold ]
# We ban Cellphones because , not only talking , it is also used  for
poronographi view. The laptops will become a pornographic viewer. 

If you want Linux to attract them, you have to 
# give Quiz like software with question bank on the current syllabus
# Free Educational Videos' related to their subject
# Free relevant materials in PDF 
# Free Presentations [Impress ] should be given on selected topics
And more

Then, they will use Linux, but they will not leave Windows,
Also requesting Govt. to give "Linux Only" systems to the students is
.............. [ purpose less ]

Hello everybody,

This Thursday, June 23rd, we are going to have a dh_python2 porting jam.  If
you know about packaging, and have meddled with Python packaging before, we
invite you to hang out and port a load of packages with us.

We have some documentation to explain better what exactly we're going to be
doing, and why:

	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BarryWarsaw/PythonHelpers

You are of course welcome to start working on these, fixing them and getting
them included in Ubuntu [1], but if you wait for the 23rd, we will offer this
for you:

 * IRC Training sessions in #ubuntu-pyjam at 1300 and 1800 UTC
 * Lots of fun and good atmosphere
 * Reviewers who can check and upload your code for you. (In addition to
   our regular patch pilots [2] we will have additional people to make
   sure all merge requests are tended to.)

If this sounds great to you, make sure pencil in this Thursday, June 23rd into
your calendar and just show up in #ubuntu-pyjam on irc.freenode.net.

We're looking forward to having you there!

Cheers,
-Barry and the Jam organizers

[1] http://tinyurl.com/6a6f9yz
[2] https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/CodeReviews#preview

Please note, while we're going to be giving assistance in converting from
python-central and python-support to dh_python2, don't count on us having time
to provide general packaging guidance.

To: For organising national WikiConferences in India
<wikiconference-india at lists.wikimedia.org>


Short on the heels of our first tentative sponsor is our tentative
first speaker. On the talk page of the schedule on Meta:, I had
suggested that we could schedule a talk on?''Indian Biodiversity in
Wikipedia - Issues, challenges & the way ahead'' by Shyamal.
He has agreed to my proposal.
The Indian biodiversity scene has a number of people who work on
Wikipedia but rarely venture out in Outreach and as such remain
completely unknown to the general Wikipedia community. Shyamal is such
a guy. So I will introduce you to him.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Shyamal
An editor since 26 November 2002, Shyamal has an edit count of over
36,000 edits on English Wikipedia, is an administrator on English
Wikipedia and is quite simply India's most prolific contributor on
Nature and Wild life.
Respected amongst the ornithological community in India, where he
wrote a seminal paper in 2007 on "Whither Indian Ornithology" in a
peer-reviewed journal, Indian Birds,
http://www.indianbirds.in/pdfs/Opinion%20Taking%20Indian%20ornithology%20into%20the%20Information%20Age.pdf
...he has contributed over 5200 images to Commons, many of them
carefully retrieved from nineteenth century books and cleaned up and
loaded as well as svg images painstakingly crafted
http://toolserver.org/~daniel/WikiSense/Gallery.php?wikifam=commons.wikimedia.org&wikilang=en&order=-img_timestamp&img_user_text=Shyamal&ofs=0&max=250
He has theorised about the role of Open Science in India, and
commented on influential papers on Wikipedia in Science.
http://thebutterflydiaries.wordpress.com/2009/08/09/open-science/
Shyamal has also loaded hundreds of documents into www.archive.org
where they are now available to posterity.
When he reads this, Shyamal will once again accuse me of being a
hagiograph. Well, as a fauji, I like to call a spade a spade. Just
thought, you'd like to know.
The Indian community has many unsung WikiHeroes, one of whom is Shyamal.

Warm regards,

Ashwin Baindur

In debian only people in plugdev group can mount plug-in storage devices.

I think you should look at who are members of plugdev group and/or tinker with udev rules normally found at /etc/udev/.

Backfire in what sense ? Linux only laptop will give "bad image" in what 
sense ?  Overwhelming majority of students are not familiar with 
computing let alone Windows 7 - so the question of "wont let go of 
windows" is only applicable to a miniscule percentage of students who 
are not even the target of this program.

a) It does not curtail freedom in any way - students can purchase 
windows with their own money and install it either in a VM or directly.  
They can even pirate it and assume all associated risks.

b) all purported activities for which the laptop program is intended for 
can be accomplished using Linux. Online research/ coding/ 
communications. It makes no sense to purchase Windows 7 Starter with 
taxpayer money. If LUG members disagree, please present scenarios where 
a Windows 7 laptop is an imperative.

c) it is disingenuous to suggest that since students are probably going 
to play games anyway lets just give them windows and make it easy. This 
is a self fulfilling prophecy.

d) if a Linux laptop  is acceptable in Germany, Australia, Italy, 
Brazil, even in Kerala - what makes the Chennai L(inux)UG oppose this.


I hope this is not the consensus stand of the Chennai LUG - rather a 
couple of dissenting opinions.

I have been using linux only for the last 15 years. My wife and kids
have been using linux only for the past 7 years. Last year my daughter
who was studying in Chennai had problems with her Suse netbook. I mailed
the list asking for someone in Chennai to help out. She was willing to
go to the person's place for the re-install. Guess how many people
volunteered? So she had to go to a browsing center and do her project
work on windows. When she came here I installed Fedora 14 - and things
are ok until she buys her usb modem - do you expect her to install and
configure usb_modeswitch on her own? 

I have been doing foss evangelism for the last 16 years, and have failed
more often than succeeded. The major reason for failure is lack of
support. The lesson I have learned is: if you cannot support it, do not
install it. I know that all LUG members who have been doing this over
the years will agree with me. Search the list archives for
ELCOT/Umashanker.

and what is the support infrastructure in these places?

what makes you think Chennai LUG is opposing it?

> couple of dissenting opinions.

Chennai LUG does not work by consensus - some members act in accordance
with what they feel is the best way to handle things, the rest
pontificate - so in which group are you?

I remember the old days - my ',' key was not working and spares were not
available - so I had to generate a comma using number keys and keep a
copy somewhere to copy-paste it.

Well
# Unless the syllabus is completely changed towards Linux, it is not
possible to eliminate MsWindows from schools
# TN Govt will not eliminate MsWindows because, ...........
# Linux only systems will give "Bad Image" means , the media will give a
wrong propaganda, the entire family can not use the laptop [ see, wearing
helmet is essential , but gave "bad image" on Govt by the people ]
# Students will not spend money on buying "licensed MsWindows".
# I donot disagree with "Linux only" system, I am giving my opinion, in a
list known for FREEDOM on SOFTWARE [ freedom on opinion ]
# We can only discuss this issue, MsWindows supporters will not discuss
# I am not the whole of Chennai L(inux)UG to oppose this. I am only a
mailing list member
# I can not hide the reality about TN school students
# I am also aware of "Taxpayers" money spending. I can even say , this
Rs.3000/- can be used to improve the hardware by using FOSS.
# Seems some of the key members of the "Free Laptop+OS" are also silent
members of this list

I know the struggles faced by KG's daughter to follow +2 syllabus with Linux
System [ esply C++ compilation ]
I am a Linux user for the past 12 years. Also a member of this for the past
10  years.

You might want to include Livna in this list which has one single
package, libdvdcss separated for legal reasons.  Libdvdcss is needed to
play encrypted (aka pretty much all commercial) dvd's in Linux

Dear all,

- one small thought on this.

instead of just saying about the good things about FOSS, and money
loss on using Windows etc....
- can we use this opportunity to show how using linux can be
customised - in Tamil Language etc...

More :
- it is not just the student (who receives) will be using the laptop
- his brother / sister, maybe even his relative would like to use them
- if they cannot see things in tamil / related language - they may lose interest
- if they can see and learn to operate in tamil (or their language )
it will make the student also very happy & he will be proud too.

Let the laptop be with dual booting, and if we can get the first lot
students to see this side of linux (customising and a lot of other
things) may be he will start using linux more than Windows, and he may
even take windows out of the laptop !!!.

- even if we aim for 1 to 5 % of this entire lot of laptops to keep
running on linux too, then it will be a big boost.

I think you all will have more ideas in this.

- what about commercial usage (in the sense - giving POS software to
run in Tamil), etc ...

may be I dream more....   may be I should wake up.

thanks

I cannot but agree with this with all my heart. Lack of support is the
one critical element which is stymying the spres of LInux.

I find hundreds of people giving advice over net and mailing list. But
support in flesh and blood even on minor issue? Forget it.

You only need to browse mailing lists to see enthusiasm for organising
Installfests. But just look around for people to lug around PC systems,
printers and electrical adapters, tables on which to place them, YOU
WILL NOT FIND A SINGLE PERSON. 

As long as the linux geeks shed their geekiness and prepared to hget
their hands dirty by helping newbies (sometimes even so called
veterans), forget about spreading of LInux.

Dear All,

We are in need of a kick-ass PHP coder who is willing to work in a start-up
environment. Essentially, we need a very hard working and creative
initiative taker who can work on site (at our Chennai office) for a short
while and later remotely, if on-site is not possible long term.

Immediately, the requirements are making the website *social from the
ground-up*, implementing new features like *an automated ticket management
system* and a *good search feature*. UI design skills is a big plus. The
start-up seeks to grow and innovate continuously, so fresh needs will keep
popping up.

If you are excited by what you hear, contact me off the list asap.

Shaahul Hameed

Free/Open Source is wide spread. There are companies who do provide
paid technical support for various distributions [1] [2] [3]. If you
don't want to pay for support (which is one of the F/OSS revenue
models), you cannot blame the lack of it!

There is a difference between voluntary user groups and paid technical
support. If you have paid for support, and you have any issues, the
company is obliged to help you.

This is a voluntary group like many other free/open source user groups
where people volunteer to help in their free time. You can _only_
request for help, and not demand it.

+1

support in the context of schools is also a very different kind of thing.

If teachers are not trained, then paid support groups can be set up
for them and the students. However in the long run there is no
substitute for training teachers and in-house technical staff.

What is the level of net connectivity in TN?

Shrinivasan hasn't raised an issue with LUG name so far. Even said in a mail
to ILUG-C mailing list he has been arranging a press conference.

I think it would be better include him in this regard and ask the input from
other LUG members, before deciding  that. I will remove the name as of now.

Done!

Hi,

<quote from the document>
Windows and Linux are completely different operating systems, trying to
learn and use both of them is a daunting and difficult task for any student.
</quote from the document>

I agree partly to the statement, technically may be correct, but to a layman
eyes, both nix and doze are looking the same.

The later part of saying "daunting task to learn"  may be a little too much,
as a guy who wants to get a job as a 'photo shop designer' or a 'auto cad
professional', doze provides a solution to the scenario. IMO, It is a good
move by the government to introduce both doze and linux in the laptop.

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

But there has been no consensus. I do not believe in press statements
and petitions, but if I did draft one, it would be like this:

"We welcome the far-sighted initiative of the government in including
Linux in the specifications for the free laptop scheme and we assure the
government that we will do our best to extend technical support for
students using linux. We however request the government to ensure that
the linux installed is a fully fledged installation which works well
with all the peripherals - and not some token installation. We are
willing to provide expert help in choosing and installing this."

Sounds good.

But I think we should rephrase the token installation part.
May be ...

"We however request the government to ensure that
the linux installed is a fully fledged installation which works well
with all the peripherals as otherwise the student community
may not derive the benefit of the scheme."

I am posting this from my mobile, hence have on idea weather top
posted or bottom posted. Kindly bear.

If you could take a look at the first thread started on this regard,
you could clearly see my views. I said this would just be a technical
win with no actual benefits.

If you have gone through the draft you could clearly see the explicit
mention of "windows strater". I would request everyone to go to the
Wikipedia page on Windows 7 and see the support of the starter pack.
You will come to know that one can neither become a "photoshop ninja"
nor a "autocad mastero" with it. It doesn't even support dual core. So
what you will end up getting is a supported hardware that is either
outdated or that lacks juice. If they have floated the tender for
"home premium" or "professional" edition I would have never helped
draft this letter.

I greatly welcome KG sir's way of drafting. But one reason i didn't
explicitly mention our role is "I am not sure how it would work out".
Wouldn't it look like we are after a share of that 91.2 crores that we
say we are saving. Are we going to say we would pay unpaid support?
Whats the offer here. If the community could come to a consensus then
I would be glad to change the draft the way it needs to be.

And for the 'daunting thing', we are talking about school kids here
not college students alone. I have personally known students who think
a 30k laptop is 'duplicate' because someone has shown him a 50k one.
Try explaining windows file structure and linux file structure to him.

And at last to KG sir: Sir, please tell me why it shouldn't be bearing
the community name? Is what we are doing degrading the community in
any way.

One more thing for those who are going to run photoshop and autocad.
How do you plan to use it? By paying for the license ? Then you can
jolly well afford a windows license. Or going to use a pirated copy?
Then use pirate windows too.

ILUGC is a loose collection of individuals with diverse backgrounds and
opinions, with a common interest in FOSS in general and linux in
particular. We also pride ourselves by acting rather than talking. Since
we have no organisational structure there is no way that we can pass
resolutions or take official stands on issues as an organisation - we
can only do so as individuals. That is why I asked who gave you
permission to issue a statement on behalf of ILUGC. ILUGC does not issue
official statements. Period.

Hi,
>>One more thing for those who are going to run photoshop and autocad.
How do you plan to use it? By paying for the license ? Then you can
jolly well afford a windows license. Or going to use a pirated copy?
Then use pirate windows too.

I see my comment is taken out of context. I am not suggesting what they are
using (viz pirated/licensed copy), all that what i felt is "exposure to
doze" may help the student to fetch a job.

I am not interested in bolstering only linux as a solution to all problems,
instead, promoting linux in a little way i could. FYI, I am conducting a gcc
course for 7 days in birla planetarium for pre-engineering college students
starting 4th of July 2011.

I am sorry, I wasn't clear and that earned me a OT. Of course its glad that
they give Windows. If you could recollect, around 3 years back ELCOT said
they were negotiating for 500 rupees with MS for the OS, and offered a Linux
only system. Its a good improvement this time, but why spend on a useless
stripped down version of it. You will have to spend on a better OS (upgrade)
if you want to run all those packages, so why should the govt spend now?
Thats why I said buy your own or get a pirated one for your needs.

Take a look at smart-pm, it does dep resolution across multiple 
providers ( so in this case, .deb can require something provided by a 
.rpm ) and its quite easy to extend into things like cpan or rubygems or 
python-pip etc. That will solve the problem you defined here quite nicely.

But - if what you are trying to do, as pointed out by other people, is 
to just inherit random packages over the net and hope they work ( the 
.deb and .rpm formats dont matter ) - its not going to end well. Even 
within the .deb world you cant safely take packages across distributions.

mysql.
The third session was handled by me and Dilip partly viz., Kernel
compiling, GTK/Qt programming and Subversion was handled by Jeyanth
from Collabnet.
All the participants were equally participative.

On behalf of ilugc I thank the Management of St Peters Engineering

In your place I would have started with Webmin Developer Docs:

and join it's developer mailing list to clarify my doubts.

Recent discussions on which software package to be incorporated in the
free laptops to be distributed to students this year in Tamil Nadu
have highlighted the attempts across the country to promote the use of
Free and Open Source Software in education and other fields.

It is unfortunate that while in the West, the dependence on
proprietary software is decreasing, the developing countries are
giving in to predatory marketing tactics, says Atul Chitnis,
consulting technologist and founder, FOSS.In.

Kerala has 600 open source learning centres across 14 districts,
offering specialised training in animation, graphics and multimedia on
open source technologies, apart from regular education.

S. Shanu, convener of the Free Software Foundation, Tamil Nadu, says
linguistic flexibility is a big advantage of free software. The
culture of innovation and community-based support systems can
transform the way students think.

Invoke Impress from CLI like "strace ooimpress" and watch the messages
output from the app; note error messages.

Purge libreoffice and do a fresh install of libreoffice.

Hello Friends,

I am using Fedora 14 (LAMP) setup  (php)

i have been using virtual host setup for various project in my system.
currently i am using different .conf files(httpd.conf) for each of the
projects..
basically what i am trying to set up is that, i download the project files &
database from the live server and make a local setup in my machine
so for each of the projects i have set up a virtual host in my local machine
with the same url as the live server

*for example: if i have to work in http://dev.project1.com  *

then i carry out the following steps

*Step 1*
======
mv httpd.conf httpd_normal.conf
mv httpd_project1.conf httpd.conf

virtual host setting for project1 in httpd_project1.conf

<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName cefpress.com

It depends on what you mean by support. A computer (Linux) literate
neighbour or a support license. If it's the latter, I don't think the govt.
is buying support for Windows for the users even now. ( There's nothing to
support there anyway!) . If it's the former, then you've got a point. Mass
awareness campaign about the forums, IRC, mailing lists, .. will be
required..

Subject: [Ilugc] Is it legal to host a webserver in domestic broadband plan
Message-ID: <BANLkTinsQSkMVC2_HnKGomf4KLPihhvLOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I dont have money to buy domain or interested so, I installed apache in my
system, Registered with freedns.afraid.org and assigned a subdomain for my
ipaddress. Now anyone using that domain name can access the site hosted in
my system.

I did this for learning purpose and also it is easy to share any files to my
friends by asking them to download from my server instead of uploading to
another site and sending a link to them.

In order to shorten the subdomain name to "xyz.co.cc", I did registration in
co.cc and thought to use url forwarding option but they said my ip address
is in blocked list and inorder to host server i have to signup in bsnl.

My question is hosting webserver and using freedns to allow people to access
my system is legal or not?
Is there anyother way to host webserver in my system other than above
method?

Regards,
Balaji

Have you paid the extra Rs. for a static IP address?  Default is
dynamic by most ISPs.   You could have just as easily registered a
host on one of the DynDNS free domains.

Great.  Beware of upstream and downstream bandwidth from your location
to the ISP.  256 Kbps is the standard which is approx. 25 KB/s of
usable transfer speed.  N users connecting to your server will get
about 25/N KB/s.

Most ISP's (world wide) IP blocks are in some RBL or the other :)
Hosting SMTP server is a pain but web server should be OK.

 IIRC, commercial DSL tariffs do allow hosting services in your
location.   The answer would be in the fine print of your ISP's terms
of use.  There is no general answer.

> Is there anyother way to host webserver in my system other than above

Register a host with DynDNS.com + on a different port on the WAN and
have that port forwarded to your internal system?  e.g.
http://yourhostname.dyndns.com:8888.

Switching ports may not work with L7 filters within your ISP's cloud,
if they do not allow it.

Without static IP you cannot do anything.

It is a must. Dynamic IPs have a lot of problems. You can even run a
web server by simple port forwarding with dyndns IP update with a
simple basic ADSL connection.

But it won't work well.

It is legal of course but won't serve much.

I didnt pay extra cost. I am having dynamic IP only. i will use
updater client which will update "freedns" when my ip changes. BTW i
am not going to host any service for 24x7, If i want to share a java
project, i will put it in server & tell my friend (to whom i have to
send the project) to download it and then i will stop the server.

First i did registration in dyndns, activation mail didnt come after
many tries so registered in "freedns.afraid.org". Hope both are going
to do the same work.

Just for learning purpose how it works.. (after hosting a site in my

You can copy any kind of file or entire directory if needed. For windows you
need cygwin or something like that.

For graphical copy, paste stuff you can open nautilus (in GNOME) and type
ssh://<ip-address or name>/ in location bar. :-) (make sure you have
installed sshd)

This requires opening your SSH port to the entire world. IMO, its a very 
bad idea, unless you have a VM which you don't really care if compromised.

Amen :)   Unless a business case requires you to host a service, it is
better to put it up on the cloud.   The administrative overhead costs
more than the monies saved.
