Sorry, I have little time for that.  I started ILUGC.  That is enough
headache for one person for one lifetime. ;-) IZPUG is a good place to
post for starters.  Atleast its the one place where a few Indian
Python users I know of were subscribed.  Admittedly almost all
questions there are Zope centric.  But users make a mailing list not
vice-versa.  Forking the list will make us end up with 2 inactive
lists.

Hi Prabhu,

Yes, I do have all these free docs/pdf books[Sridhar ;-)].
But like me there are many others who can't read much on screen alone.
Printed Books are really comfortable to the eyes.


> If you need someone to teach you Python, you need serious help. ;-)

  Knee-jerk-reaction or you are plain kidding :-)) . I am not an
  expert pythonista. But I am not entirely new to python too.
  When I talk about getting python in IT training centers I am
  implying some means of popularising python and making it available
  as an option for developers. "Serious help"..ok, so be it. Not
  everybody can grasp everything they read. Sharing practical
  experiences is definitely helpful.

  I understand your problem. Though it's been a headache for you,
  I very much appreciate your ILUGC efforts and want to thank you
  for that :-) though frankly I am not yet committed to Linux.


 Is anybody out there who has the time, resources(Bandwidth) etc.
 to start a Python User Group on the lines of ILUGC. I promise to
 help in every possible way I can.

Only somewhat true.  Writing code is probably the only thing that
helps you master a language.

I really don't see what you will achieve in the process but good luck.
You haven't answered the fundamental objection I raised about forking
something like IZPUG yet.  If you just want a few Python users to get
together, sure, go ahead, have fun.

On behalf of ILUGC we are constantly looking out for opportunities to
make case for Open source. Some of the events in the last two years
are

1. LDD at MIT
2. LDD at LUCAS TVS
3. Presenation at a Software company Xerago
4. Two day seminar in St.Josesphs Engg College
5. LDD at Asan Memorial School
6. Lecture in Velammal Engg college, RMK Engg college
7. Demo at IEEE

 The problem in organising is in co-ordinating and arranging - i.e
logistics. I request, whoever can, please contact
Colleges/Schools/Corporates and arrange for the seminar/demo or by
whatever name you call it. On behalf of ILUGC we can mobilie
volunteers.

Chennai has a few companies that do use Python. Last year we
were looking for Python programmers and for some reason got
quite a few Py resumes from Pune and Bombay  -  all startups
using open source in some way or the other.

Message-ID: <000801c4d76e$149d8b20$f200a8c0@DURAI>

Hi all,
I am posting this query to this forum, because i am not able to get a more 
appropriate place,
Please redirect me if you find a correct place.

 I am working on Video On Demand appliation, in which the pages are designed 
using
javascript. This script is calling some APIs which is available in windows 
mediaplayer 9 services.

For example,

this.pl = document.getElementById("pcMediaPlayer");
this.pl.play();

Now I want to port the java script APIs to my custom linux platform. I am 
having certain APIs which are in "c" language,
which can play, pause or stop the media. Can I call these APIs from a 
javascript. I think, since javascipt is executed
in the client side, any native functions cannot be caled easily. What is the 
alternate way of doing it.

I never worked on any scripting language before :-).

Hai everybody,

Let me introduce myself as a Electronics Engineer , who is very much
interested in migrating from the Monopoly Player Windows to Linux. But
to be frank , I am a newbie. I tried my hands on some of the Linux
that comes with Linux for You magazine . But as I don't have enough
knowledge on all these stuffs(Bash , Shell , Kernal etc.,) , I feel
very difficult to use Linux. I am currently having MEPIS Linux that
was provided by the Magazine in the current issue.

Can any one help me by showing a Good Training Centre in Chennai ,
where I can learn all about Linux starting from the scratch ??


Thanks in Advance
Rajesh Kumar Manoharan

Anyone on this list will tell you that the best trainer you will find is
yourself.

Also google.com/linux and tldp.org should satisfy your Linux hunger.

If your really interested in a Training Course in Linux, try STG in
Mount Road(beside Anand Theatre).
It has the RHCE course for Rs.10,000

Seriously, that's a lot of money to spend on something you can learn in
a month.

For obvious reasons, it would be a bad idea to suggest the RHCE 
course for a Linux newbie who wants to learn Linux (shell, command-line 
oriented stuff, scripting, utilities, programming and so on) which is a lot 
different from "System Administration". The course fee can also be a 
limiting factor for an enthusiast. Moreover, RHCE courses are tailored to 
churn out "Certified Engineers" (whatever that means) ;-).

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

No, The STG people tell me that no prior experience is necessary for
taking the course.

I guess people don't realise that they can learn Linux by themselves and
join these courses.

Most of the stuff they teach has gotto do with redhat-config-* , so yes
the command line stuff does go down.

Shelling out Rs.10K for a RHCE is a waste of money, IMO.

If your interested in good T-shirts for Linux/UNIX/Geeks/O'Reily and
willing to shell out around 700-1000 bucks then I would suggest
www.thinkgeek.org (or is it .com)

They have some of the best tee collections.
Costly though!!

The other alternative is the local LUG's/tech sympo's etc.

toufeeq, if you've been anywhere near an niit, aptech, stg or other training
institute, it will be enough for you to immediately find out that front
office counselors are the lowest form of liar that can be found .. they'll

Leanr Linux for free as u may get software for free. Install it with
some HOW-TOs tutorial available from the Internet. Learn basics with

True, most institutes "claim" that fact. But from what I've seen with a lot 
of institutes (no idea about STG though), all they do is teach how to click 
the "Next" button during installation screens, what needs to be entered into 
the text-fields in redhat-config-*, and so on. A newbie would still remain 
clueless about how things work (unless ofcourse he tries out everything on 
his own way). Most institutes align their Linux training *only* to system 
(and/or network) administration. They end up teaching Linux like they would 
teach Novell Netware/UNIX/Windows NT administration. This might _not_ be 
suitable for an enthusiast (who has no interest in becoming a sysadmin). 

That apart, I was baffled to find a couple of RHCE zealots (in bangalore 
atleast) who have no clue about how to add a new service onto a specific 
runlevel, or how to survive without Gnome/KDE or how to write a 2 line 
shell script even! 

> I guess people don't realise that they can learn Linux by themselves and

Yes, this makes perfect sense. Once people manage to learn Linux by 
themselves, they would never need these courses anyways, unless they have a 
pressing reason, or their company is paying for it ;-)

For the self-learning enthusiast types, google/tldp.org/LUG (as you 
mentioned earlier) are the best bet!

Chandrashekar Babu.

There is this sys admin, that I know of , who has his RHCE 
Certificate prominently displayed in his work area - but is absolutely
clueless when it comes to sorting out "real" issues of even moderate
complexity - issues that don't even involve scripting  or any kind of
programming - just regular admin jobs .

Use this link

good in configuration files and its settings.

Very true. There are placement agencies (and some companies too) that look 
for RHCE/MCSE/CCNE tags on your resume before proceeding with the next level 
of candidate selection for sysadmin (thus, those without these  
certification tags stand a tough chance to get through).

   AFAIK one of the best book u can get to learn linux is "Running
linux" O'Reilly publication. tldp.org has good collection of guides &
HOWTOs. Its greared towards newbies. If u would like to become a core
developer in linux then read hackerhowto ( web-page, search google for
"Hacker howto"). Here hacker means developer. I find
loginataka(web-page) very interesting. It will lead u more quality
books to read. It all depends on how much u r interested. For starting
Runing Linux & tldp.org should do.

People keep making up these nice acronyms for MCSE - Minesweeper

I wonder when we're going to start making up similar acronyms to 
describe all the "RHCEs" and "CCNAs" that these outfits keep churning 
out ...

Yeah I know,

the moment he mentioned "no prior experience required" I walked out of STG.

On further enquiry I found out he was a Mechanical Engineer who had finished his BE , done a course at the Institute and taken up a part time job there.

Helps people who have some basic exposure to UNIX as a user. 

A Linux enthusiast would also be someone who just bought a new computer 
and wants to try his/her luck on Linux (perhaps after a brief date with 
Windows) and have not much formal CS background. I've managed to find a lot 
of such users lately. Recommending a purely technical book might just 
demotivate them.

Google/TLDP has helped a lot of users to start on with Linux (occasionally 
supplemented with a "For Dummies" kind of book).

I hope many do (atleast those who are interested in _helping_ others). In my 
personal experience, this has what set LUGs far apart from the BSD user 
groups and mailing lists back in the 90s. It was _this_ community effort 
that was instrumental in adoption of Linux by non-techie users in 
many ways.

  
Though I do not suggest an absolute newbie to directly expect other 
members of LUG to spoon-feed them, it does make sense for them to be 
involved in LUG (atleast read through the past archives, or search them via 
google) to get enough idea about how to go about solving an installation 
problem or similar commonly raised issues. Of course, like all other 
sensible netizen, a newbie who subscribes to a mailing list must first read 
through the policy docs and act accordingly.   

A search for "Introduction to Linux" on google results in enough excellent 
starting point tutorials on Linux (the first link pointing directly to 
tldp.org). Similarly, there are excellent guides catering to many commonly 
used Linux distributions too.

And yes, learning Linux is a *lot* different from learning Linux System 
Administration (though learning the former lays a firm foundation to 
explore the latter in subject). 

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu

PS: The books that you mentioned are worth the next steep step into 
mastering the subject (Linux/UNIX).

When I gave the paper it was very interesting...
there was no time to think or even sit down for five minutes.
So I would agree with people who say it was challenging....
not because the questions were unawnserable, but because it was a bit
like the CAT exam.....
leave the candidates for sometime, and they would complete all the
questions, but put them under time stress and you would find out how
many are actually prepared....

One cannot go into the exam unprepared and believing that any issues can
be resolved with a little bit of 'man' or RTFMing on the spot or on the
fly.
That never works out and I can confidently tell you that you wont clear
level1 (which is the easiest of all levels)

A candidate should have ideally prepared for all domains including
sendmail, DNS,samba, wrappers, ftpd, sshd, and so many others which I
cant describe here.
Having said this, a new candidate to Linux would have not be able to
comprehend all the above topics in a matter of just 2 months would he?

He would have to practice and practice and practice....
The examiner cannot help you out much.. Shashi unni is a very busy
man...and dont expect any sort of assistance from anyone there.
Either case RHCE is just an exam to tell the industry that this guy
knows the basics (rather should know the basics) and thats about all.
It saves the recruiters from cross examining the candidate further on
that.

RHCE is certainly not the panacea to all imaginable problems in
Linux/Redhat

The exam itself is 10K and if the course is also another 10k, then I
would seriously think twice.

holy shit....thats 20k straight....

so for newbies.....observe all the threads that go on in ilugc or any
other mailing lists and pay more closer attention when Dr.Sriram replies
to some threads as that went a long way in helping me. Sir, no offense
meant I hope.

Very very neat and simple. Great  job! I guess google has affected all
our lives in terms of UI design ;)

A few things to comment on:

1. The 'search box' should probably give credit to google.

2. The 'Subscribe'  bar on the left  should probably not  talk about a
   'spanking new Mailman'  :) I think that text was  added in 2002 and
   its a 'spanking new two year old Mailman' ;)

3. I  personally find  all those  icons  under the  'site powered  by'
   section very obtrusive.  Maybe you can move them  out somewhere? or
   make them smaller?  Or if you  think it needs to be there, fine let
   it say :)

Great job! keep up the enthu!

cheers,

  -Suraj

Two choices
1. Modify the mailman templates to use css 
2. Steal the form part from mailman and code your custom form (perhaps
inline form on left divbox)

Hi,

Didn't you get the DVD from Mr.Muthu in September?
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2004-September/012406.html
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2004-September/012417.html

May be you should ask him again.

For curiosity sake, I checked GT's site and they are
quoting a price of Rs 2,500 for it.
http://www.gtcdrom.com/Product_detail.php?product_id=MAG-005

You could if you want(legal issues aside) download
Revolution OS(730MB) and "The code:Linux"(615MB) Divx AVIs,
from google-tells-you-where ftp sites. But people
who have downloaded them say they are of VHS quality with
tracking marks. Of course there used to be DVD-ripps made using
XviD that are now rare to find.

Check this link out:

http://www.mncc.com.my/ossig/lists/general/2004-10/msg00057.html

If the CDs/DVDs are available at a "reasonable" price
(not in USD) here in India for purchase, I am ready to
buy it. Otherwise, it gives us no choice. With lot of
choice in broadband net connections these days with
unlimited usage, you can really do a lot.

The design looks simple and neat. Here are my suggestions though:

1. The ILUGC logo found on existing site looks cool, and it also 
provides the site (and also the group) a form of unique identity! We call 
it "branding" in corporate/marketing jargon. I think we must retain it (or 
improve upon it). 

2. The powered-by logos are a bit out-of-place. Perhaps they are 
better at the bottom of the page (away from the mouse hover zones).  
The existing site seems to have them at the right place.

3. The search field looks better if moved to the topmost right corner of the 
header. 

The current site is based on HTML 4.01 standard. We could have our new site 
(if at all) using current standards like XHTML 1.0 (or 1.1) with all layout 
information moved to CSS.

Anyways, keep up the great work ;-)

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.


PS: One site that I was impressed by their design/usability/user-experience 
lately - http://www.xaraya.com/. There are many others though.

Hi:

Some of you have sent in your best wishes and some others would like to
explore working with us and still others would like to know more about our
product and concept.  We have just started operating from IIT and will be
here for next 1-2 months before moving out.  Thanks for your keen interest -
Novatium would like to explore hosting a LUG meeting sometime in Jan/Feb to
share info.

In the meanwhile here is some basic info on our thin clients at this link on
Rajesh Jain's (our key promoter) blog

http://www.emergic.org/archives/2004/10/13/index.html#tech_talk_the_network_

yeah - mobile phones, small "wifi router + firewall in a box" type stuff
such
as the linksys wrt54g etc all exist, and it is nice seeing linux ported to
various embedded platforms.

but please consider what differentiates your port from all the rest of the
linux ports out there .. you will need to focus on the actual userspace apps
/
kernel features you'll have to include for your product, and see about
porting
those as well .. and whether it is worth writing a whole new port, or just
concentrating on porting and optimizing various apps to an existing embedded
platform for your new app.

Hello all,

Ilugc wiki is here
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/

If you don't know what a wiki is read here
http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki

Just click on the 'edit this page' link of any page and help on the
format used for editing wiki pages is here
http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_edit_a_page

To start new pages, either
1. Open the URL directly -
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/index.php/My_New_Page and refer the URL
to some index page
2. (Or) put the page link in index page [[My New Page]] and click on the link

Read mediawiki docs for more information

And don't forget to create a separate user account for yourselves.

As anyone can edit, any evil mind can do mishap, but since mediawiki

link of that page or Recent:Changes).  To monitor the changes everyone
should have a look at

hi there,
u have joined our lug then why spend money on learning
linux when u have group members ,who can help u out.My
advice is when u try it urself u learn a lot.For eg. i
formated my harddisk for about 35 times just to
install linux.i learnt that my monitor's architechture
was not configured eah time i installed and finally i
learnt how to deal with it by asking lug members.Then
i learnt the HOW TO and man pages for more details.Now
i can use linux as easily as anyone can use windows.
So the first thing is try HOW TO and tldp.org
bye

What about using Drupal?

Bharathi and all others suggestions are welcome.  I am currently

Oh and what about people who  ask questions? Let us make it clear that

Yes, but why a moderator? any can add/edit it :)  Moderate only the
changes.  If anyone likes to moderate the wiki, tell me, I will make

I think, this is the right way. Only Moderator can add to/del from the 
wiki. May be in future, we can think of giving access to more members.

If that is the case, then it is better to use CMS like drupal but not
a wiki.  Bharathi, can I change to drupal?

For all, this announcement is very early .. things are not yet finalized, sorry.

I personally would suggest a CMS [Drupal/Plone/Etomite/Xaraya] for the 
website. Administration is easy, and they also come with a lot of
goodies (Tracking hits/Referres/Statistics/Advanced User Management/so on). 
A website can easily carry a more professional look if based on a good 
CMS.

I guess wikis are best used as community-driven knowledge management 
software rather than being used as website deployment tools.

Hello,

We can keep the wiki [http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/ ] as sort of
community site.  For Ilugc website I think it is better to use some
CMS.  So we can have two Urls

1. http://www.chennailug.org/  (for website)    - drupal? 
2. http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/ (for wiki)    - Installed - mediawiki

What you are describe can be done with CMS, where only moderators
could edit content, but users could also *submit* there own content
for review. - See gnomedesktop.org

The purpose of wiki is to allow atleast ilugc members to share
content, ideas, etc ...  - See http://gentoo-wiki.org

If the later is not needed or should we simply require the users to
'submit' their content rather than editing it we could have some CMS
like drupal.

PS: mod_rewrite is really an ugly design hack.  Python webserver is great.

It depends on what variables you use in the Makefile.
I only use this in a Makefile for a 2.6 module:

obj-m := driver.o

and compile using:

#make -C /usr/src/linux SUBDIRS=$PWD modules

Hi,

Copyright notices usually are of the format:
Copyright <period> <copyright holder>

Like, from linux/kernel/fork.c :

/*

 *  Copyright (C) 1991, 1992  Linus Torvalds
 */

What does the period suggest and how is it decided ? 
In the above example, what happens after 1992 ?

The period suggests the year(s) when the original work was 
created and/or published. The entire work remains copyrighted for 
atleast 25-50 years from the year(s) as mentioned on the notice. 

The website http://www.whatiscopyright.org/ should clarify most of your 
doubts relevant to copyright notices.

Subject: [Ilugc] Segmentation Fault
Message-ID: <E1CZoqV-00044S-00@smtp.net4india.com>

Dear Friends,

I have Red Hat 8. I upgraded GLIBC to latest, to install the latest
softwares. It did work fine. Then I had installed only GNOME desktop, not
GNOME development environment. Now when I try to install GNOME development
environment, system is asking for Xft 2.0 version only, it is not accepting
Xft 2.1 version, which I upgraded (unncessarily by mistake) sometimes back
as dependency resolving process of some other application installation.
What I need?

1. Trying to revert back Xft with old package version through RPM command
with --oldpackage, --force, --repackage..... but I always get "Segmentation
Fault".  But RPM command works fine with other package installation. I
tried --rebuilddb also., but no use. How to revert back to old version of
Xft, so that I can install GNOME development environment?

2. Another approach: So far I have tried installing GNOME development
environment with "redhat-config-package" GUI tool only. I have started
thinking of installing this complete package (Standard + Optional) through
command line, so that I can force RPM to take new version of Xft. Is it the
right way of thinking? If it is so, how to do that? bacause of a lot of
Standard package RPMs are involved in GNOME development system, which may
have a lot of dependencies.

Expecting your help in this regard,

Regards
T.KaruppuSwamy

I think this is not possible with (media)wiki.  Only by *explicitly*
protecting each pages, they can be protected from anonymous, who could
always at least create new pages.

I think for Ilugc website CMS would be better, and we should find the
real use of a Wiki here.

What do you think?

Instead of using the existing CMS... we can customise and develop a
new one specifically for ilugc which should be able to plug in any new
modules in future..
since when we use existing CMS, we are bound to that application. we
cannot extend i.e when we want to modify its code to suite our needs.

Have a look at drupal's features for eg.
http://drupal.org/features

Many CMS's are extensible.  Drupal has 'modules'.  If you need any
specific (to ilugc) functionality you could always create a drupal
module and plug it up.
Look at the modules written for drupal here
http://drupal.org/project/releases

I think it makes perfect sense to bring drupal for ilugc website.  It
does have user management, which means collaborative editing is
possible.

One method that I can think of, is by creating two new groups - one for 
users who need 200 MB of usage space and another for the set of users who 
need 50 MB of disk usage space on /home directory. Then, by using quota 
relevant tools (edquota, quotaon), you should be able to set disk usage 
constraints for these groups on /home directory. Depending on which group 
the user belongs to, he should be able to inherit constraints as set on the 
group.

I haven't tried this method practically, but I hope it should solve 
the issue.

Wow! mod_rewrite configuration in drupal is pretty painless, just need
to check a checkbox in the preferences.  I think this is the killer
PHP app known to man kind, really motivates me to continue learning
PHP just for involving in drupal development.  (Now apache needs some
rethought on URL design problem instead of coming up with hacks like
mod_rewrite)

Have a look at it again, see how pretty the URLs are

Yes, I have clean URLs on my personal website anyways (using mod_rewrite). 
It was straight-forward and easy.

> I think this is the killer PHP app known to man kind, 

Sure it is. The best part that I liked in it was its clean design (easy to 
read through the code, understand and modify bits and pieces to our 
requirements). Though, lately, I've been more impressed with another CMS 
software called Etomite (http://www.etomite.org) - seems to be more well 
designed, though I guess its less mature than drupal in terms of features 
and familiarity.

Just curious to know, whats wrong with mod_rewrite on Apache ? [Considering 
the fact that Apache itself is "A Patchy" webserver, where almost all 
features are merely patches glued together].

That's the problem (patch).  In contrast look at
http://twistedmatrix.com, which is killer design for web app.

different.Will some one clarify!

I found the update on the distribution media.
It was on disc #1 in the folder /RedHat/Updates/

I guess we purchased RedHat long after its initial release. So Red Hat
just put the update in with the media.

Our application was getting this error until we applied the Update:

I don't think RHES is free for redistribution like this - you have to buy
licenses.

Hi,

Did you include "linux/sched.h" ??
Also, usage of sti()is not recommended. Instead use
save_flags and cli during disabling and restore_flags
during enabling.

Using sti may be hazardous in the sense that your
process does not take into consideration all the
changes that has happened between cli() and sti()
calls. Hence, it may hamper/destablise another
process. Restoring flags just ORs data related to your
process only. 

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
Joseph

Which version of the book? cli() and sti() are old
usage styles. You are to use spin_lock functions
instead.

Which header files did you include? Make sure you
don't have these set in your kernel:

<> Prompt for development and/or incomplete
code/drivers
<> Set version information on all module symbols

K Shakthi

What prevents you from learning on your own? An old P2
machine with 32 MB RAM is more than enough to do
kernel programming.

You need to get recognition from the open source
community that you are a competitive programmer and
that you can contribute to the community. No institute
(atleast that I know of) teaches you that. The more
you interact with the community and provide valuable
contributions, the better. This should give you a
start:

Good luck,

K Shakthi

Linux is the kernel. Assembly for which hardware? You
need to be specific. This is an _excellent_ book for
GNU/Linux assembly for x86:

I have one doubt regarding this, Should I need to have
/home in a seprate file system. Now I have a single /
file system and /boot and /swap also in seprate.

You can use:

dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86

The settings are saved here (and you can edit by hand):

If it was configured using debconf, dpkg-reconfigure is the way to go

Or you'll just have a horrendous mess to deal with - don't mix vi and 
debconf.  Stick to one approach or the other.

While it is not compulsory to have /home in a seperate 
partition/disk/file-system (however you term that as), it is a good idea to 
do so, on a production server.

Better run xfree86 --configure  as root
Then copy /root/XF86config to /etc/X11/XF86config-4

I used to do this for my Debian installations.

	CONVERSION FROM VSS TO CVS
Message-ID: <20041205030023.98293.qmail@web54103.mail.yahoo.com>

Dear all,
This is how I converted from VSS to CVS in our
company.The softwares that we use are pure OSS. I am
striving to thrush Linux using in our company.


PROCESS OF REPOSITORY CONVERSION FROM VSS TO CVS:

1.Deleted all previous test sandboxes of all the
existing PCs by searching for folder workace and find
whether it is a cvs folder that too in directories
created for each user.
2.Logged in as root and deleted previous repository
folders in the linux server Red hat linux9 hosted as
cvs server.
3.Logged in as a cvs user[cvs group user] and
Initialised the cvs repository from scratch [ folder
permissions, etc.,]
Administrative setup:
Added binary files list to cvswrappers file - By
checking what all binary files are used in our
PROJECTMODULE
CVSROOT/notify file edited for sending mails during
watches 
CVSROOT/users file added to repository
CVSROOT/checkoutlist file editing and adding users
file to it.usernames and mail ids added to
CVSROOT/users file.
copied contrib.pl to $CVSROOT/CVSROOT directory for
sending commit logs
edited CVSROOT/loginfo file for commit logs as mail to
administrators
Ran vss2cvs.pl from a windows PC in LAN as per the
readme provided with vss2perl.pl set of
scripts.Completed successfully.
logged in as cvs user[cvs group user] and ran
massage.pl on folder PROJECTMODULE-Completed
successfully.This is to remove fake timestamps.
Backedup repository in each stage...
And ofcourse the cvs repository can be resynched with
the VSS repository
And thats the whole process.Anybody of you having
doubts regarding version control please feel free ask
me,

ENJOY THE SPIRIT OF GNU/OSS

thank you
Ignacius

Nice.

Now, is there someone out there with a DVD reader who would be willing
to let me connect my hard drive to your computer and dump the distro?
:-)  If you do not have the dvd, I'll buy the magazine.

The claimed line-of-sight range is nearly 1 km, with stock Netgear

Is there any interest from anybody who wants to try to bring up

Message-ID: <001101c4db36$ffb0a4a0$41a841db@i0r1b2>

Hi All

Debian has kept up its promise again!
Yes, I installed Debian Sarge and as usual, X 
is not working again.
My system is Celeron900MHz,128MB RAM
Intel 815e chipset(Kobian) Mobo.
It has win98 and RH9(With working X) already.

After the second phase, an error message appeared
to indicate problem with GDM
---------------
GDM: X server not found ! 
/usr/X11R6/bin/x : 0 -audit 0 -auth 
/var/lib/gdm/ : 0 .Xauth -nolisten tcp vt7
Error: command could not be executed.
Please install X server or edit /etc/gdm.conf to point
to the right place
------------
Since gdm.conf is a 20k file, I am not quoting it here.

Usually XF86Config file is placed in /etc/X11 dir. But in Sarge 
it was not seen.
Then as root, I ran xf86config and it built an XF86Config file
and put it in /etc/X11 directory. Still X would not work.

Initially it starts off from .Xauthority file, but after
the error, I see that the file is having 0 bytes.

Here also startx will not make x work with error msg
/usr/lib/X11R6/bin/xinit/xiniitrc - No such file or directory
and one more error msg which I could not capture.

What could be wrong?

Any pointers please?

I'm in. 

Have always wanted to do build something with
wireless, hardware level. Right now I can use a laptop
that I can use for testing (in-built wireless 802.11b
and SMC 2532W-B PCMCIA card) :)

Apache starts up as root and then forks a non root, unprivileged user to 
handle http requests

This is a feature

Hi,

Check out the GeeXBoX project at -
    http://www.geexbox.org/en/index.html

It's a live CD that contains mplayer and friends.
The current 0.98 release is measly 6MB ISO and can play -

  1. mpg 1/2 movies - mpg files, VCDs, DVDs.
  2. mpg 4 - DivX.
  3. realmedia, winmedia, mp3, oog, audio streams, etc.

If you have TV-out on your PC, then you can watch your videos
on the tele.  It also supports joysticks and some remotes.

I hope we can now play The Revolution OS and The Code on
special occasions without much trouble :-)

All the above four messages indicate that you have not installed the
xserver packages properly. Did you try installing the
"x-window-system" pseudo package which takes care of installing the
Xserver and few basic X clients?

$ dpkg -l | grep "X Window" 

will give you information on what are the X Window system packages
that are currently installed on your machine.

Drupal and Wiki is still in trail phase. Don't think of any
modification in that. Both are giving more options. 1st we 
have to sort-out, which needed and NOT.

Once we feel, it is suits our needs then we will go for the 
modification/add/etc...

Also try emovix http:/movix.sourceforge.net. it can play any format
that mplayer can play.
you create a bootable slackware linux along with the video file. As
soon as you boot with the cd, the video automatically plays. It is
also available as a tool with K3B.

Rather than the format support , what is more important is the device
support.

Many of these liveCD distros fail horribly when it comes to device
support.
Has anyone managed to get a distro which will work with "almost any"
hardware?

All the while I was trying to install with 2.6 Kernel.
In that only all the problems were there.
X server did not properly install.
Grub will not recognise the both Win98 and RH, it will recognise only Win98.

Today , I started installing with 2.4 kernel.
This time x server did install properly.
And also Grub recognised the other 2 OS's and also
booted them perfectly apart from the debian.

X display came on without any problem. I did not need
to tweak anything.
In a previous instance also , when I installed PCQ Linux 2004 in my Office
PC (That is a powerful m/c P IV3.0 GHz 256 MB RAM ATI RAGE PRO Card compared
to my piddly home PC) , X display was there only for 2.4 series. If  I chose
to boot with 2.6 kernel, the X  display will not be on (PCQ Linux 2004 grub
boot gives the option) .
Is this an isolated experience of mine alone or are there
comrades-in-distress in this matter?

I used the 2.6 kernel and X started without a problem.
I selected Desktop Environment in the Debian Installer and it
automatically installed XFree86/GNOME/KDE.

I used "vesa" driver and pretty toned down Monitor Settings.

After you get X to work, make a backup of the XFree86-4 file and then
start tweaking the settings.

Do so until you get the desired ones.

It is not like that Toufeeq. that is why u need to ask for the
software compatible to the OS from the Hardware vendor. or else search
the Internet and get the driver and make it work. that's all. Not all
can be provided in single distro. Everything has its own advantage and
disadvantage of usage

I would like to know whether Red Hat 7. 2 which runs a 2.4.X kernel
supports 160 GB of Space coz when i installed it in my office it  just
took 130 GB but didnt recognize the remaining 30 GB. Should i tweak
anything so that it takes 160 GB or should i move on to a recent

In linux i can get the sounds whatever i set in "aumix". eventhough
the Wine gives some options for sound effects, they are not rendered
as expected.

My system is Intel 845 board, 256 DDR RAM, 40 GB etc.

So can anyone suggest a nice multimedia player with nice sound effects?

Thanks in advance. I am looking for the day of full powered multimedia in linux.

A Linux Lover,

Hi all,

I installed Fedora Core 3, and everything else is doing fine except that I
cannot connect to internet using my Dax(Smart Link) modem. This internal
modem is not there in Hardware Browser. It is not being detected by
setserial or wvdialconf.
Please help me as KPPP is saying that Initializing and the log window shows
as Expecting:OK but nothing happens after that. I got the drivers from the
website smartlink.com, but it says something about compiling from the
scratch. It is not in rpm format. So if it is the only solution pls let me
know the link, where I can get info on how to compile that stuff and make
the modem working.

Looking forward for your help. Thanks in advance.


Best Regards,
Mahesh.

It's not the software that's the problem.  Its your hardware - your HDD
controller needs to support 48bit LBA.  IIRC, most ata/133 controllers
suppor disks > 137GB.  Look for "137GB ata" on google for solutions.

The HW requirements are pretty modest - for DVD playback a P3 with Vesa 2.0
video and ALSA compatible sound card.  So I guess most users should be happy.

I tried GeeXBoX on 3 diffrent PCs and it always crashed before it could
launch mplayer :-(  But the docs say that the default config for mplayer
uses the experimental xivid extensions.  I guess switching back to vanilla
vesa 2.0 should increase compatibiliy.  I'll try rebuilding and post if
successful.

I used the 2.6 kernel and X started without a problem.
I selected Desktop Environment in the Debian Installer and it
automatically installed XFree86/GNOME/KDE.

I used "vesa" driver and pretty toned down Monitor Settings.

After you get X to work, make a backup of the XFree86-4 file and then
start tweaking the settings.

Do so until you get the desired ones.

 AFAIK linux was meant to b a server operating system, though
multimedia s/w r avilable for linux. Multi-media in linux is not as
good as it gets in windoz.

Hi Mahesh,

A few months ago,while I was using PCQ Linux 2004(based on Fedora)
I bought a Dax Smartlink Internal Modem card (PCTEL chipset).
The supplied driver cd only had a binary module compiled for
some 2.2.x kernel and I tried everywhere to get the driver for
my 2.4 kernel.

Even the unoffical ones
http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/pctel-linux/welcome.html
were not helpful for this particular chipset. Thankfully, I had
my old 33.6Kbps External modem which comfortably works under
linux.

The problem could have been avoided if Modem Chipset makers
provide source code of their drivers or at least update
their binaries for new kernel releases.

I suggest you buy an External modem or carefully pick an
Internal Modem that's well supported under linux...or
You could do yourself a favour and switch to a broadband
service(FYI: I subscribe to Hathway's Cable Internet
service that doesn't require any modem at all and works
quite well under Linux)

Regards
Kumaraguru

 I had similar problem with Redhat Linux 9 .I signed up at www.daxnetworks.com
and they sent me a driver for RHL9 through email and it worked after
installing that..

I got the drivers from smartlink.com, and the readme says I have to compile
& make the install.I that part i have a clarification. There is one
KERNEL_INCLUDES which I dont know where it is for FC3. I believe FC# is
using the
kernel2.6.9.Please help me getting the KERNEL_INCLUDES, with which I can
compile the driver & give it a try.
Thanks in advance.

An excerpt from Release notes of FC3 may be of use for you
------------------------------------------------------------

In order to eliminate the redundancy inherent in providing a separate
package for the kernel source code when that source code already
exists in the kernel's .src.rpm file, Fedora Core 3 no longer includes
the kernel-source package. Users that require access to the kernel
sources can find them in the kernel .src.rpm file. To create an
exploded source tree from this file, perform the following steps (note
that <version> refers to the version specification for your
currently-running kernel):

Obtain the kernel-<version>.src.rpm file from one of the following sources:

The SRPMS directory on the appropriate "SRPMS" CD iso image

The FTP site where you got the kernel package

By running the following command:

up2date --get-source kernel

Install kernel-<version>.src.rpm (given the default RPM configuration,
the files this package contains will be written to /usr/src/redhat/)

Change directory to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/, and issue the following command:

rpmbuild -bp --target=<arch> kernel.spec

(Where <arch> is the desired target architecture.)

On a default RPM configuration, the kernel tree will be located in
/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/.

In resulting tree, the configurations for the specific kernels shipped
in Fedora Core 3 are in the /configs/ directory. For example, the i686
SMP configuration file is named
/configs/kernel-<version>-i686-smp.config. Issue the following command
to place the desired configuration file in the proper place for
building:

cp <desired-file> ./.config

Issue the following command:

make oldconfig

You can then proceed as usual.

Message-ID: <92ac7fad0412062200322f4b7f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

  Atlast I've installed my Linux after a long struggle (I formatted my
HDD for 17 times),But ofcourse I had a chance of knowing more about my
system and BIOS configuration now.

  Now I have two problems before me.Can anyone help me out to solve
these.I've searched the net for solutions , but I couldn't.Hope nobody
had came across such problems .

1. Mouse configuration. I'm having a Logitech mouse, but my Linux
identifies it as Generic Mouse (PS/2).I tried it changing using
mouseconfig command at terminal but it leads me to non-working of the
mouse.Moreover with this Generic type I couldn't use my scroll
button.Please help me.

2. Believe me but its true. MY LINUX HANGS !! I'm using elx linux with
kernel 2.4.x which is said to be the stable,but whenever I was
connected to internnet(dialup-BSNL) my system hangs after exactly 45
mins. I couldn't figure out the problem.Please help me.

expectin your solutions as soon as possible.

Hi
I got some more clue from comp.os.linux newsgroup which gave a tip to give
PS2 mouse protocol as ImPS/2 if I start installing with 2.6 kernel. Now X is
working

Yes, this worked !
This time I gave mouse protocol as ImPS/2 nad the X server is installed and
working perfectly!
Previously I gave it as Plain PS/2 and the X did not get installed (which I
did not fully grasp the first time) and apt-get install xserver-xfree86
later also failed because of this during the subsequent installation trials.
Thanks once again!

I presume that your problem is relevant to mouse scroll-wheel support on X 
Window System.
Depending on your distro, check if either /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 or 
/etc/X11/xorg.conf file exists, open the file using a text editor of your 
choice and search for the mouse section block which resembles the following:

Section "InputDevice"
   Identifier "Mouse1"
   ...
EndSection

Within this block, make sure that you have the following line (before 
"EndSection"):
    Option "ZAxisMapping"       "4 5"

Also make sure that you have the line as follows (somewhere in the 
beginning of the section):
     Option "Protocol" "Auto"

-or-
    Option "Protocol" "ImPS/2"

This has to do with either your hardware, or support for your hardware 
by the Linux distribution itself. I haven't used elx, so cannot comment 
about its stability. If the problem persists  with other linux  
distributions too, this can be also hardware problem. Try another 
(better) distro (like Slackware/Debian/Mandrake/SuSE/Knoppix) and let us 
know.

Hi All

okay, now that X problem solved and everything else is okay except for KPPP.
With external modem things should work fine, but it is not.
When connecting it goes up to handshake and terminates with pppd error code
1.
Which says a basic sytem call or something else is broken.
Same kind of KPPP setup works without any problem in RH9.

Hi
okay, now that X problem solved and everything else is okay except for KPPP.

When connecting it goes up to handshake and terminates with pppd error code
1.
Which says a basic sytem call or something else is broken.
Same kind of KPPP setup works without any problem in RH9.

The error message is pasted below:
Couldn't find interface ppp0: No such device
Kernel supports ppp alright.
Couldn't find interface ppp0: No such device
pppd: The remote system is required to authenticate itself
pppd: but I couldn't find any suitable secret (password) for it to use to do

It was pppd that died

Now after reading thru KPPP handbook and man kppp
I edited /etc/ppp/options and commented the "auth" parameter and for good
measure added "noauth" in the customise pppd arguments tab in KPPP also.
Still KPPP terminates with error code1.

What else is to be done?

Hello,

I personal quirk I felt in the logo was the " nationalisation " of it.
Shouldn't we have a more " tamil-tux " (if one exists)

What about the GNU Cow ?
I remmember it was there for the previous ILUGC logo...

Heh heh :D

It is a cow right ?

I meant no disrespect to the logo.

Just that I feel it needs representation too in the ILUGC logo.

How about a image that's faded into the background like the tux's is
done.

Hi,

     Could somebody help me find the kernel-2.6.9.1.667.src.rpm in FC3 CDz.
I've got all the 4 CDz but couldn't find that file. I need it for compiling
my SmartLink modem drivers. I found it in the net, but it is a whopping
38MB which I cant afford getting thro my dial-up conn. Please help.

Best Regards,
Mahesh.

Goto the Menu and Find Add/Remove Packages .
Scroll down and select Kernel Development.
It should install it from the FC Cd's.

Think it is on CD3.

hi all,
i have mounted initrd image in directory using loop device

$mount -t ext2 -o loop initrd-2.6.0.img.gz /home/user1/mnt/

when i am trying to unmount, i am getting the following error

$umount /home/user1/mnt/
umount: /home/user1/mnt: device is busy

I am getting this output.
I have checked the things like...
	* no files from the mounted fs has been opened

How can i find which process is using the device?

Thanks in advance.

"Gnu" gcide "The Collaborative International Dictionary of English
v.0.44"
Gnu \Gnu\, n. [Hottentot gnu, or nju: cf. F. gnou.] (Zo["o]l.)
One of two species of large South African antelopes of the
genus Catoblephas, having a mane and bushy tail, and curved
horns in both sexes. [Written also gnoo.]
[1913 Webster] 

OK. I got this from the dictionary.

It looks like a Cow though in the logo.
Nothing like a wildebeest of Africa.


"gnu" wn "WordNet (r) 1.7"
gnu
n : large African antelope having a head with horns like an ox
and a long tufted tail [syn: wildebeest] 

The above meaning compares it to an ox. :)

initrd-2.6.0.img.gz does sound like a compressed image to me.

Hi Venkat ,
                      Try this command  to find the process which is 
using that device. mostly it will work.

$lsof | grep /home/user1/mnt/

Thanks and Regards,

Yes when I watched Matrix Revolutions (divx) there was a lot of frame

In my ordinary stereo the sound is good and I can hear them clear. But
when it comes to 2.1 my friend didn't like it.

Can some one tell how does linux sound in a 5.1 speaker system??

*Undocumented incident that happened during ILUGC Install Fest 2004*

I was wearing a black coloured t-shirt with a GNU head logo printed on 
the front pocket.  A gentleman came up to me and asked why I have 
dressed up "inauspiciously" - with "Lord Yama's vahana", pointing to the 
GNU head :)  I said it is a Gnu, an African antelope, a symbol for the 
GNU project, and indeed it also looks like Lord Yama's vahana because it 
spells doom for proprietary software ;)  But as Toufeeq Hussain rightly 
points, the GNU head also looks very similar to a cow, albeit like 
Kamadhenu, giving as much as we can ask for. Etienne Suvasa, is believed 
to be the artist of the GNU logo.

The Penguin is already the logo for Linux, and the Gnu head is a logo 
for the Gnu Project. Ideally, a logo for an org should be a unique 
symbol not imitating any pre-existing logos that are well associated 
with other orgs.   I would suggest a golden spotted Deer [head] symbol 
for ILUGC.  Most of the ILUGC meetings are at IIT-M, and the sighting of 
deer while driving towards the meeting venue is one of the additional 
pleasures provided by ILUGC meets.  It would be an "I-like-see deer" 
also ;) The Deer could also be used as a mark on any custom distros that 
ILUGC may create in the future. It is up to the graphic artist to make 
the deer look like both the gnu head, and the penguin too, using some 
morphing tool, or the logo section would end up looking like a mini zoo 
;) Other logos may also suit ILUGC, if any change in the existing scheme 
is seen fit.

Hi all,

Thanks for ur help. The problem has been rectified using "lsof" command.


My linuxrc file (which is in initrd img ) is this file.

####################################################
#!/bin/nash

echo Mounting /proc filesystem
mount -t proc /proc /proc

mount -o defaults --ro -t ext3 /dev/root /sysroot
pivot_root /sysroot /sysroot/initrd
umount /initrd/proc
####################################################

I wanna know wht is implied by /sysroot.

whether it means "root(hd0,0)" which i have given in /boot/grub/menu.lst

or someother thing.

Thanks & Regards,

I have an SbLive platinum and I've  watched only one movie so far on a
DVD on  my system. It  was good,  though I dont  have a very  good 5.1
speaker setup,  i was able  to 'check out'  if the rear and  the front
jacks have different  sounds. I use ALSA. Dont know  if I answered the
question here.

I have a SB Live 5.1 and a Creative 5.1 speaker system, and it's
excellent.. All movie watching is done only on linux and the quality
is much better than what you'd get on windows.

mplayer is so good that some of my friends have linux installed just
to watch movies. :)

Use ALSA. In alsamix (eql to aumix), you will get all options related
to 5.1 Spkr system.

On my machine (AMD AthlonXP 1800+, 256MB RAM, KT266 chipset, GeForce2/MX 
with NVIDIA drivers for linux, onboard C-Media 8738 sound chip), the sound 
quality is excellent on 5.1 channels. Same goes for the video quality too 
(both on xine and mplayer as well). 

For some reason or the other, the Cyberlink DVD player (that came with my 
DVD drive) for Windows 2000 had issues playing the video using true-color. 
Anyways, I dont have Windows anymore, so cant comment much about it. But on 
linux, both sound and video have been great for my machine configuration. 


Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

The poll should have another option "Someother CMS" for people who are 
not okay with both of those options :-)

Goto the Menu and Find Add/Remove Packages .
Scroll down and select Kernel Development.
It should install it from the FC Cd's.

Think it is on CD3.

There is no section explicitly named Kernel development in Add.remove
packages. There was KDE devmnt,Legacy devmnt,  and some othr 3
options....btw, i installed everything, (selected Everything option during
install). Moreover I ran a search for the kernel*.src.rpm, but there is no
src file at all in all the 4 cdz.
The only thing that the /usr/src directory contains is the folder "redhat".
but even it doesnt have the src file.

Mahesh.

Did you install the "full" Kernel Development Section in Add/Remove
Packages.

Did you chk /usr/src/linux-<kernel version> ?

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] exporting shell variable - perl
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0412082323290.26558@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,

I am able to export a variable to my shell through shell
program(korn shell).

When I tried to do exporting variable in perl program
using system command. It is not working.
The snippet of my code is as follows.

system("export
SHLIB_PATH=/base/content/matlab/bin/hpux:/base/content/matlab/extern/lib/hpux");

So, presently, I am forced to give the export in the shell
in command line and then run the perl program.

Is there anyway in perl to export the shell variable.

Trying for sometime in Google does not give me good pointers.

Thanks
carti

When you use system the environment changes affects only that
command.

You can manipulate environment using perl special variable $ENV
for example
$dsquery=$ENV{'DSQUERY'};
printf "before dsquery=$dsquery\n";
$ENV{'DSQUERY'}='querynew';
$dsquery=$ENV{'DSQUERY'};
printf "after dsquery=$dsquery\n";

Use a download manager like wget and do partial downloads every day. 

I used  to have  this script  that downloads stuff  listed in  a file.
Upon completing a  download it would send a mail  and proceed with the
next ones.  It  took five days to download  the kernel-source-2.4.6 :)
/etc/ppp/ip-up.d and /etc/ppp/ip-down.d/ is very useful.

Hi,

Presently, in Linux I find lot of utilities
which are not there in Windows. Because of this
advantage I started using Linux(long time back),
and this gave me an edge over others(non Linuxers)
in all places.

Though there are lot(numerous) utilities, only a
few are mostly used my most people most of the times.
To name a few, editiors vi, emacs, shell scripting,
commands(both user level and admin level), configuration,
perl coding, python coding, apache, mysql, etc.

Though there are good number of good sites on any of these
above topics, there can never be one good site which is the
consolidation of all sites(For example sites for vi editor).

I am sure there are quite a lot of ilugc members who are
good in many of these topics(utilities). Our members know
many things which others do not know. Why not create a
documentation (OR) guide (OR) tutorial (OR) TIPS & TRICKS
sort of thing which will HELP beginners and which can
HELP others who know better and interested to CONTRIBUTE.

I think Time is not going to be a constraint as nobody
is forced to do. If anyone is willing to share any TIP
or guide he will just contribute.

Basically a knowledge repository will be great for
ilugc members.

I think this would be a good pointer to think about.

Keep pouring your ideas.

Thanks and Regs,
carti

Hi,

KDE Info Center shows that in one of my PCI slot, SmartLink modem has been
connected. But neither Hardware Browser nor wvdialconf as well as setserial
can find my modem. Why is it so? Since it is there in Info Center, it means
that my FC3 has detected my modem, doesn't it? Please clarify.

Moreover I cant use wget or the script to get the kernel source because as
i mentioned b4 i cant connect to net. I need the kernel source to compile
the modem drivers i downloaded from the net(thro windoz,i think i gotta do
the same for the kernel source too...).

Best Regards,
Mahesh.

No, thats just coming from the PCI table. Doesn't mean its supported. 

cat /proc/pci and see for yourself.

Hi Mahesh,

http://www.redhat.com/magazine/001nov04/features/fedoracore3/
says..

************************************************************************
Fedora Core 3 no longer includes the kernel-source package. Users who
want to rebuild the kernel are encourage to download the kernel-
<version>.src.rpm source RPM, install it, and build kernel-source from
it. However, if a user wants to build a module against the existing
kernel, the entire kernel source tree is not required.
Refer to the Release Notes for details on both these operations.

************************************************************************

The release note:
http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/release-notes/fc3/x86/  says

************************************************************************
An exploded source tree is not required to build kernel modules against
the currently in-use kernel.

For example, to build the foo.ko module, create the following file
(named Makefile) in the directory containing the foo.c file:


obj-m    := foo.o

KDIR    := /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build
PWD    := $(shell pwd)

default:
    $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) SUBDIRS=$(PWD) modules
          

Issue the make command to build the foo.ko module.

************************************************************************

Kumaraguru

I really don't see a need to have everything in one
site. One can always search in
http://www.google.com/linux for whatever tutorials or
topics that one needs to refer to.

One needn't reinvent the wheel. tldp.org is already
there.
http://www.tldp.org

The ability to search for online resources is not
limited to ilugc members. Internet is in a public
domain.

Promotion of GNU/Linux w.r.t. ilugc should be more
propaganda to the people of Chennai, which includes,
seminars, install help, cd distributions, install
festivals, presentations et. al.

All that you have told is for intermediate/ experts //

Have you attended any of the GNU/Linux festivals that
ilugc has conducted? Just curious!

At Asan and IIT-M, we did deal with tech support.
Apart from answering tech support questions, we showed
demos of how to use X windows, software applications,
covered system installation etc. I personally took
care of tech support at IIT-M.

Hi,

I use ALSA  and alsamix is great for 5.1 speaker system. Of course i have soundblaster live sound card too, compatible with the 5.1 speakers. One thing i'd like to share is that the clarity is better in Linux than in windowsXP. This is on a fedora core2 box. latest xine is great but haven't  played divx format files.

Message-ID: <20041209134312.43899.qmail@web41721.mail.yahoo.com>

I am having getmail 4 installed and configure for
multidrop as follows. We have a single user account
postmaster@a.com, in which all users mails will be
stored in. 
===================== Config - getmailrc ============
[retriever]
type = MultidropPOP3Retriever
server = mail.a.com
username = postmaster@a.com
password = xxxxx
envelope_recipient = delivered-to:1
                                                      
                         
[destination]
type = MultiSorter
default = [abc]
locals = (
        ('sample@a.com', '[sam]')
        )
                                                      
                         
[sam]
type = Mboxrd
path = /var/spool/mail/sam
user = sam
                                                      
                         
[abc]
user = abc
type = Mboxrd
path = /var/spool/mail/abc
=======================================================
For this config, getmail is forwarding all the mails
only to abc. and not for any other user.
As I specified the envelope_recepient to Delivered-To
: 1, I think it looks only the postmaster@a.com.

====================== sample mail header
=============
>From hostmaster@rediffmail.com Thu Dec  9 18:42:13

To: sample@a.com
Date: Thu, 02 Dec 2004 12:01:57 GMT
=======================================================

How do I make getmail to look for the TO field, which
is the required field for me.

Plz give me a solution. Urgent !

For a quick solution search for the entry "default" in 
"/boot/grub/menu.lst" file and change that accordingly and reboot. You 
should get what you want.

For grub, try this
$ grep "Loading stage" /dev/hda

If you get "Binary file matches" pretty quick, then grub is installed,
otherwise ctrl+c ... and try for the corresponding string for lilo.

If you are accessing the variable among different
functions it has to be declared global. Usually, you
lock a particular variable instance (maybe in a data
structure) that is susceptible to a race condition.
Are you working on a SMP system?

You also don't want to do too much stuff between
locking and unlocking it. Remember, you are disabling
interrupts for the processor. The best way is to do
the needful and transfer the rest of the work to
bottom halves.

I would encourage you to read the spinlock section
here:

http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/ch09.html

Also check Chapter 4. Interrupts and Exceptions in
"Understanding the Linux Kernel" by Daniel P. Bovet,
and Marco Cesati.

I believe it is on IBM web portals and application
stuff on GNU/Linux. I spend most of time living in
kernel-space, so it won't be of much use to me. Thanks
anyway.

Have fun,

Hi all,

I was a passive member of this group for last couple of months ( i did
attend one of the ilugc meetings though), but on reading this thread i
thought there was a need to express mine..

       The Computer users all over the world has developed a trend
that a google search will get you every thing.. but i think its not
the case always. What google show is the matches of the keyword you
have given... It doesn't make a content based evaluation or in simple
terms doesn't ensure the quality of the content that is found in the
results.

       Suppose i am a newbie to linux and want to know about
programming on linux environment ; a search for "linux programming"
will retrieve you 13,600,000 results ... Here i am sure it will take
him weeks to understand what python is used for and what php is used
for ....

       Now , how we can help the community is.... 
          a) List down all your favourite  sites 
          b) Classify them based on  "what it talks about?" and  "how
it helped you?"
    
      and mind you, these classifications should be checked for
content not category.

    This list can be put up in the new ilugc wiki site under different
categories with a neat briefing of what each link is for ...

   I am absolutely percent sure that your Favourites list (or
Bookmarks) will help hundreds like you.....

Looking forward to hear a lot more about this from all of you..

regards,
Praveen.P.V

Hi Madhukar,

Interrupts are for the _processor_ and the system. You
will be able to see all the interrupts assigned in the
output of "cat /proc/interrupts". Similarily, you will
also find useful info from the output of "cat
/proc/stat". Interrupts could be from external
peripherals or system interrupts (timer, for example).

Yes. Check this:

Yes, it is.

hi

as i said - newbies require hand holding till they get a certain skill level

one of the first skills they must develop (around the same time they 
learn ls, cp, rm etc) is how to use the internet (& google) effectively

if they dont develop that skill along with their other skills then they 
end up like the NIIT "faculty" i remember some months back on another 
list who was asking how to compile a c program on linux

Try to reconfigure your the Video setting. Use the following

Message-ID: <d52fe6460412100004426e46df@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I got Fedora Core 3 DVD from Linux for u package but there is a
problem in its pre-process installation ...

My system(Pentium III with intel 815 chipset) have CD-RW as Primary
Slave and DVD Rom as Secondary slave. In the boot priority setup there
r only 3 options as ATAPI CD-ROM, Hard Drive and Removable
Drive(floppy drive) ... and i have chosen ATAPI CD-ROM as the first
boot device and while booting it is checking only in the CD-RW for any
bootable media and if nothing has been there it boots with Windows
,since this Fedora Core 3 is a DVD i cant place it in CD-ROM ..

There is no option in BIOS to chose particularly for DVD drive in the
boot priority option ...

What shud i do ..?

PS : While booting the BIOS detects all the drives attached to my
system even the DVD drive and i am able to use the DVD in Windows ..

can i go for "rawwrite.exe" or any other suggestions ..?

thank u

Subject: [Ilugc] getmail/ Procmail problem
Message-ID: <20041210085258.57138.qmail@web41723.mail.yahoo.com>

I am having a mail server x.com at my ISP, which will
collect the mails for any user to postmaster@x.com. At
my client place I will fetch it from x.com and store
it in mailroot mailbox locally and then distribute it
to all other local users. I was using fetchmail with
procmail to do this. and it is working well, but I
want to migrate from fetchmail to getmail. At this
time the mail is retrived by getmail and stored in
mailroot, but procmail is not distributing the mails
to other users.
The following are the configs

Getmail Version 4
=====================
/root/.getmail/getmailrc
[retriever]
type = SimplePOP3Retriever
server = mail.x.com
username = postmaster@x.com
password = xxx
                                                      
                         
[destination]
user = mailroot
type = Mboxrd
path = /var/spool/mail/mailroot

Fetch mail V 6.2
====================================
/root/,fetchmail
poll mail.ideafarms.com proto pop3
user "postmaster@x.com" pass "xxx" is mailroot

Procmail 3.22
===================================
~/mailroot/.procmail
:0
* ^(To|Cc|Bcc):.*a.b@x.com
!ab
:0
* ^(To|Cc|Bcc):.*c.d@x.com
!cd

Plz reply me! Urgent

Message-ID: <20041210104010.46614.qmail@web41726.mail.yahoo.com>

No, getmail needs procmail to distribute mails to
local users, as it is getting from postmaster@x.com. 
I somehow managed to set getmail to work with procmail
by using this config.

[destination]
type = MDA_external
path = /usr/bin/procmail
arguments = ('/home/mailroot/.procmailrc',)
user = mailroot

The mails are distributing to the local users
perfectly. But there is one problem with procmail. My
procmail config is
:0
* ^(To|Cc|Bcc):.*ban.sh@x.com
!ban
:0
* ^(To|Cc|Bcc):.*vij.g@x.com
!vijay

If a mail which is destined To: vij.g@x.com and cc:
ban.sh@x.com, that mail is only delivered to ban user,
the other rule (for vij.g@x.com) is not checking. If I
swaped both the entries, to be vij.g first & ban.sh
second. That mail is delivered only to vijay and not
to ban. 

How should I make procmail to go thru all the rules
before exiting.

Helllo,

I agree on the view expressed by Praveen.
It would be great idea to think on the lines mentioned/highlighted by 
Praveen.

Like Praveen I am also a passive member of this group since the last two 
years. Though I have not participated in any of the ilugc meetings, I 
have been regularly browsing the mails which I get through the list.

Cheers, Sriram

First of all a lot of educational institutions are unaware of Linux. 
Eg., CEG, Anna University.    In CEG itself, only 3 of us (including
me) are up to now in booting up the "Linux Campus Club" [1]. Shall we
arrange one (awareness) in such places (for students) (and invite the
n00bs their)?

PS: It is not wise to explain that most of the students in the hostel
have Linux installed on their computers, but they do for the sake of
scoring marks, who is really using Linux? Spread the fire in the
campus first! I am sure more volunteers would turn up then.

I totally agree with Bharthi. What we need now is volunteers in flesh
and blood and not volunteers on the net. The real problem is not
availability of information on the net, but awarness. All that we
need to create is awarness among all about benefits and software
available in Open source. We cannot achieve awarness even if we have
1000 websites unless we talk to students/user directly through
colleges,public fests etc.

I request - repeating again and again to the point of boredom- the
student members/newbie/passive members to please arrange for
demo/seminar/lecture or by whatever name you want to call - it in
your college/corporates or any suitable place and ILUGC will arrange
for technical volunteers.

Raman.P

Why not look at the homepage? http://www.icewm.org/
Download the source tarball, extract it and read the README, INSTALL
files, you will get the idea.

You don't even need to go through these steps as your distribution
will always have one. (search the CD content)

During this discussion, somebody mentioned abt the Teaching Linux to a
newbie (Person never seen a computer). See there is no need to go that
level.

Bcoz we have nearly 175 engineering colleges and lot more Arts
Colleges in TN. We will try to make the awareness in this area. This
people know computer, mouse, Internet, google, Unix!, etc... OK.

Don't sent mail that, "I am ready". Whenever an event is organized, 
sent your conformation first.

If a discussion is leads to an Action, then that is Nice, otherwise it
will become a usual archives.

Again I will repeat Raman's statement, "we need more volunteers in
flesh and blood".

Bye :)

Two things that might help

1. the LOST project / http://lost.sourceforge.net

Which website?

Doesn't google.com work for you?

google.com->search for
ilugc->http://www.chennailug.org. There is a search
option in this page. There is also a link to the
archives.

Does that mean that we have to install from it by booting from the DVD
(if anything lie that is possible)

/me confused.

If it just has the RPMs then how are we supposded to install it. I was
planning to burn the ISO's on the DVD from my friend as I dont have a
DVD drive. Does this mean that I cant install FC3 using the LFY DVD
without having a DVD on the target system. Does it not provide the ISO
imges of FC3 CDs.

Linux poses a real challenge for those with a taste for late-nighthacking (and/or conversations with God).- Matt Welsh

Linux is not user-friendly. It _is_ user-friendly. It is not ignorant-friendly and idiot-friendly.-Unknown

Waving away a cloud of smoke, I look up, and am blinded by a bright, whitelight. It's God. No, not Richard Stallman, or Linus Torvalds, but God. In a booming voice, He says: "THIS IS A SIGN. USE LINUX, THE FREE UNIX SYSTEM FOR THE 386." -Matt Welsh

Microsoft isn't evil, they just make really crappy operating systems.

constructs that make up Shell Scripting.
The various loops , for, while, until were explained
with examples.
Next followed the explanation of pipes and redirection
and how they can can be used to manipulate
input/output in scripts.
Raman concluded with a brief introduction on functions
and arguments usage in Bash.

The next session was conducted by Shiv Shankar on
MeshNet.
MeshNet is a community driven peer-to-peer network of
Wi-Fi nodes.
Shiv explained the concept and the requirements that
one needs to setup a MeshNet in ones locality.

The requirements are:
A low-level PC Pentium 200, 128 MB RAM ,USB and
CD-ROM. Rs.2000

A Wi-Fi Adapter preferably the Linksys WUSB-11 $40
approx Rs2000

Cabling and other Equipment Rs1000

The MESHAP Live CD Distro free :)

The setup is simple as one just inserts the Cd and the
connect is up.
Shiv mentioned the need for at least 2 Nodes to be
present within the range of the Wi-Fi adapter.
Typical range is around 1 Km Diameter and the range
can be increased with additional gain or transmitting
at a lower bit-rate(am i right? )

The project is in a nascent stage and will start
around March.

There was a call for Volunteers after the
introduction, which resulted in a series of questions.

A number of Factors were identified.
They include :
* The Community : The MeshNet is driven by the
community and an active community is required for the
development/growth of the MeshNet project.

*Technical Issues : Apart from the Wi-Fi Adapter and
the PC , a rooftop is available such that line of
sight is maintained for the ADHOC Network.

*LEGAL : Shiv assured the crowd that the MeshNet will
operate within the bandwidth that is termed legal by
the INdian Government.

*Commercial : Shiv explained a scenario where a
community can poll in their Internet Bandwidth so that
a "Grid" is formed and members of the MeshNEt can draw
"additional" bandwidth from the Net. In case their
connections are not used their bandwidth will be made
available to others. Again, a lot of issues surround
this as the Broadband Providers might not agree with
this service.

After the Brainstorming Session Raman mentioned about
the offer from RMK Engg College for a FLOSS Session at
their College Premises. Interested Volunteers can
contact Raman. The event will be held during the third
week of January.

The meeting was dispersed at around 1740 hrs.

Toufeeq Hussain

You can use Xine or MPlayer for playing almost any format. I would suggest 
that you don't use Wine for any multimedia apps, unless you have no choice. 
And there's great choice here! :-)

Actually, Linux is what you make it. You can use it as a desktop OS without 
much trouble.

In fact, it's got the max. support for multimedia of any POSIX based OS, 
AFAIK. There are people who use it professionally, and there are also people 
using it as a home theatre, and things like that too. It's just how you set 
it up. ;-)

Well, if you've got a CD-R drive, you can download a small image - there are 
hundreds of minimal livecds, and boot in using that. Then you can just use 
that and set up the system from there.

But you still need to boot somehow.

Message-ID: <20041211162123.92253.qmail@web53802.mail.yahoo.com>

In case of forgetting root password, the option of
logging into single-user mode to change the root
password exists. I have used this several times on
many of my friend's system, when they had forgotten
their root password. 

However, I happened to face a problem with this
technique recently in one of my friend's system. After
changing the root password from single user mode, the
following message was given "All authentication tokens
updated successfully". However, when I logged into
multi-user mode, as the super user, and used the
changed password, the system reports a "login
failure". Can anyone throw some light on what could be
the problem?

Thanks and regards,

As of now, "indoor" use of wireless within the 2.40-2.4835 MHz bandwidth 
is de-licensed, though the recent broadband policy is in favour of such 
freedom for outdoor use also.   Some background material:

A very effective representation was sent to TRAI by Siddarth, in July 
2004, requesting for a common free wireless space: 
http://www.trai.gov.in/spectrum/siddharth.pdf

The broadband policy announced is available at:

http://www.cable-quest.com/broadbandpolicy2004.htm

<quote>
(e) Terrestrial Wireless Recognising that terrestrial wireless is 
another upcoming technology platform for Broadband, it has been decided 
in principle to de-licence 2.40-2.48 GHz band for low-power outdoor use 
on non-protection, non-interference and non-exclusive basis. Necessary 
notification shall be issued. Further, notification regarding 
delicensing 2.40-2.4835 MHz band for low power indoor permitting use of 
all technologies, which inter-alia include those based on IEEE 802.11b 
and 802.11g standards, has been issued.
To accelerate penetration of Broadband and Internet, the 5.15-5.35 GHz 
band shall be de-licensed for the indoor use of low power Wi-Fi systems. 
For outdoor use, the band 5.25-5.35 GHz shall be de-licensed in 
consultation with DoS and delicensing in the band 5.15-5.25 GHz would be 
considered after the process of vacation. Alternative spectrum bands 
which are not in high usage and could be deployed for Broadband 
services, shall also be explored and identified.

<quote>
However, the restriction about indoor/in-campus use continues. For 
outdoor hotspots in public areas, you still need a license from the WPC, 
with violations are still illegal and liable for a penalty.
</quote>

It is only a question of a time before which "outdoor" use would be 
delicensed,  in accordance with the Broadband Policy, 2004.  Please 
document the relevant notifications from WPC as you go forward on this. HTH.

Did you mount the root partition as read-write? That might be the trick here - 
if / is read only, nothing changes. :-)

Ramanraj,
         Thanks for the clarifications - looks like we will have to
wait for the actual notification before proceeding with deployment.
I'm planning to start experimentation about 2-3 months from now,
but I'll await further notification before attempting outdoor use.

I guess it's only a matter of time - maybe about 1 year before it's
fully delicensed.

I guess the default configuration of postfix would let you do
local user delivery. As for fetchmail, try fetchmailconf. However
to get the best out of it.. $man fetchmail is the best.

I've never tried using a 5.1 system on Linux but AFAIK, support is
lacking. 5.1 support has come recently to Gstreamer; you can try the
latest CVS and see if it works for you.

http://www.advogato.org/person/rbultje/diary.html?start=57

Read a few posts after the linked one and you'll see him talking about
implementing virtual surround for 2.0 systems by channel downmixing.

Yeah.. so the key is that get the latest Gstreamer and play DVDs using
that backend.

Message-ID: <20041212114731.48596.qmail@web12703.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I have a DAX Router /w Airtel broadband connection.
I want to enable NAT/port forwarding on it.

Though I got much of the concepts off google, i'm
having problems configuring the router's
web-interface.

Googling for the DAX router doesnt help much.

Has anyone managed to get NAT/port forwarding working
on the DAX Router ?

The model is
dax dx-601ar 

Tech support at Airtel asks me to open Outlook
Express.
They have no clue about it.

Regards,
Toufeeq Hussain

It should work like anyother MODEM connection.

Difference:
a. you dial *99(followed by phone dependant suffix)


But dont buy LG phones if you want to use GPRS in Linux or any Unix for
that matter, since they use some 255.255.255.255 IP as remote when
actually the ISP provides a valid 32 bit IP.

Samsung, Nokia phones have worked fine for me with Airtel GPRS.

I think your CAPS lock would have been on while you were setting your

ALSA and OSS both support 5.1 channels on familiar sound chipsets (atleast

Hi all,

These are just my PERSONAL thoughts. Mail would be little big, but
I thought its high time to share it.
If you dont like this, you have all the right to send to /dev/null.
My intention is not to bring difference of opinion.

I have not given my contribution in any of the Linux fest or monthly
seminars. But I have been in the mailing list for the past 4 years
or more and I have attended few monthly meets and linux fests.

1.Better the Best
Linux is very good.But try to see and learn good things even if
is present in Opponent(MS). Be Open to the change.

2.Good wine needs no advertisement
I know linux is great for many people including me. But that does
not mean everybody should use that. If people or any persons finds
it good, Linux will have its own days. The usage of Linux should be
need based and not because it has got lot of featues and free.

3.Be ready to change and Be open.
I am ardent fan of linux, but if anything better I get I am ready
to change and I find nothing wrong in that if anybody is openminded
and understands clearly.

4.Share your knowledge
If you want to help people it does not necessarily mean it should
be only in the form of Linux. You can share your programming tricks,
tips and special or good ideas whatever it be.
Dont say you have GOOGLE for that. GOOGLE is not the only solution.
If ANYBODY can get ANYTHING using GOOGLE, there is NO POINT in we
getting technical Queries in our mailing lists.

I initially started this thread for making people share their knowledge
in tools related to Linux. Thereby I thought people will start realise
the benefits of using these tools and hence Linux environment.

I think Wikipaedia is doing good inspite of materials like that existed
before its arrival. Who knows, one day ILUGC's site may become top most
link in the tldp.org or linux.com or linux.org or kernel.org.

But I have seen people saying that this is reduntant because you have
everything on net. I strongly disagree to this, with reason being
when starting GOOGLE did not thought that they will be reduntatn(I
believe one or more search engines existed before GOOGLE). Similarly
Linus Torvalds knew Operating systems before he created one. In total
better the best OR products whatever it may be dig its own grave if a
better one comes.

So share your knowledge in whatever form and add some link anywhere in the
web so that people would contribute their knowledge(Though, I dont know
much, atleast I am ready to share whatever I know and whenever possible).

I value other peoples' time the most. Though I was not able to come
in flesh and Blood and help in any of the ILUGC activities,
I think, one does not need to help a person  or Community  only  by
coming in person. Also, I am sorry to say, but found from my experience
that inspite of repeated calling, I found people unwilling to come either
to monthly meet or Linux Fest(s). I dont know whether they dont find
anything interesting or they dont find time.

All the time I found only the same hardworking volunteers Barathi and
Raman along with few others.I should appreciate the efforts and spirit
with all of you inspite of my inability to do the same to your extents.

Please understand, my intention is not to hurt anybody's feelings,
but only to put forth my ideas and discuss for the reason that in ILUGC
mailing list, I think I can openly put forth my views.

If its a broadband router it already has nating enabled on it by default.

I don't think so.

When I enter my IP in the browser it takes me to the web-based
configuration login prompt of the router.

It should re-direct the request to my web server instead.

Should'nt it ?

  If by 'my IP' you mean your ISP-assigned dynamic IP address,
then this behaviour is correct for a NATed setup with a broadband
router. The ISP-facing interface of the router gets the
ISP-assigned IP address. If the router configuration page is
enabled on all its interfaces, then it will display that
configuration page when you type it into your browser, either
on the LAN or the WAN.

  If you want it to redirect http requests to the internal
LAN, you need to enable DNAT or port-forwarding. This is
possible with a Linux-embedded router (built with a Linux
Router Project image or a more recent derivative), but not
necessarily with all the commercial broadband routers that
are available. Some of them use Linux, but DNAT may not
be a configurable option on all models. DAX probably
uses Linux, but without DNAT support.

  If you want a fully-configurable NAT setup with DNAT,
check out routerlinux at http://www.routerlinux.com
It's a minimal-Linux distro based on uClibc and busybox,
and fits in 16 MB or less.

The only issue is that it supports only PPPoE and dialup
WAN interfaces. PPPoA on USB DSL modems, which is
commonly used by Chennai ISPs, is not supported, even if
the USB modem in question has support in the mainstream
kernel.

  If you think that this needs to change, then try to
patch the routerlinux kernel source with support for
the USB modem; test and validate it; and submit the
patch to routerlinux. The next release of
routerlinux can then be useful for more broadband
users here, and they need not pay for an overpriced
broadband router provided by their ISP :-).

(I already use routerlinux, but I have BSNL DIAS,
which uses PPPoE and is therefore fully supported).

Yes, the IP in question is the ISP assigned IP address that is
accessible from the "Outside world"

How do I check for DNAT support in my router?

My router uses PPPoA and its not a USB DSL Modem.
It's an ethernet based router.

  If it's not in the manual or the configuration page,
then it's probably not enabled. You can try poking
around using ssh (into the LAN-side interface of the
router), but there will most probably be a root
password set, and sshd may not be running on the
router. Try telnet as well.

  There's nothing further that you can do with the
ISP-provided router, since it's mostly a black box. 
Internally, on the WAN side, it obviously interfaces to
the cable provided by the ISP. This is probably just
a stock DSL DMT or G.lite chipset that appears internal
to the router as a PPPoA interface (assuming it's
a Linux router). It then routes and NATs from that
interface to its LAN-facing Ethernet interface.

  With a routerlinux setup, it does exactly the same
thing, except that the routerlinux box is a 'white box'
or even a 'glass box', that replaces the 'black box'
provided by the ISP.  With routerlinux, you would need
to use the ISP-provided USB DSL modem instead of their
broadband router. The USB DSL modem would connect to
the routerlinux box (with the right driver stack, this
would then appear inside the routerlinux system as a
PPPoA interface). You can then do anything with the
PPPoA interface - at least anything that netfilter/iptables
supports, including DNAT.

  What's the advantage of this setup? The USB DSL modem
option is usually less expensive, and you have full
control over netfilter/iptables, so you have a fully
configurable firewall - with the right utilities,
you can do lots of useful things, including support
for multiple ISPs, bonding, fallback routing, load
balancing, multiple zoning (DMZs), etc.

 The downside is that
you need a minimal PC to run routerlinux - any old 486/
Pentium with 16 MB of RAM, a small hard disk and a
couple of ethernet NICs should be fine. For a more
robust embedded platform, look for a Soekris Engineering
Elan platform or a GCT/Allwell Eden platform - both
these are expensive (~$200-$300) alternatives.

Shiv,

You have just suggested a project that I can take up in my free time. :)
I do have an old Cyrix 200 lying around.

Will try to get routerlinux running on that.

How much would a DNAT enabled ethernet based router cost ?

Toufeeq Husain

  Cool! Give me a shout if you need assistance. This project
definitely needs more support, and the maintainer (Tony J. White) has
done a great job, but has his hands full.

  Don't really know - it may actually be there, just inaccessible,
on some of the router offerings from the ISPs.

LEAF would be a better option IMHO www.leaf.sf.net. Far more powerful and
flexible. Can boot off a single floppy or dual floppy configuration. I've
used it extensively on VIA C3/Eden ITX form factor systems. Cost me $275. I
put LEAF on a CF and went chugging on.

Word of caution. Creating CF is not an easy task. I used a IDE-CF adaptor.
Hard to find here. Start with floppies. Easy but unreliable. For ease of
use, I'd recommend going with CD and isolinux. Doc for LEAF is fairly
detailed.

Warm regards

See if you can't telnet into that router (most el cheapo routers dont do
ssh but they do support telnet, or at least have a serial port that you can
plug into and talk to it using hyperterminal / minicom etc)

You may have to enable telnet in that web management interface - so then
you can enable port forwarding there, quite often though the web interface
doesnt support it

Quite a few of these PPPoA ADSL modems are based on generic chipsets like
Aztech / Buffalo etc.  So they should definitely support what you are
looking for ...

One thing I can think of is to repeat the process again and see if the
problem crops up the second time.

This is 1 solution I love. Keep trying until you succeed.

Then it does seem to be a fishy one seeing that Linux has reported all
authentication tokens to be updated successfully without any error.

Assuming that you are using ALSA, didn't the following commands help ?

   amixer set 'Mic' off 
   amixer set 'Mic As Center/LFE' on

Hi,
I have some basic questions to ask:

1.Some times the umount does not work with the cdrom. even umount
/dev/cdrom -f gives a device busy signal, what do u do then??

2.Is it possible to find the files that have changed (added/modified) ,
in the last xx minutes?? (basically it is like running updatedb with
updatedb reporting whenever it finds a new files..or something like
that)

3.How do find what version of gtk has been installed??

4.How do u find where the rpm has extracted it's contentes to??(i am not
talking about well packed rpm's which install to the standard/expected
directories)

5.Is make distclean equivalent to uninstall?? what about makefiles whcih
dont provide this option?  how do u uninstall then??

First, check if you've got ALSA installed - as root run:

# alsactl -v

My output is:
alsactl version 0.9.2

If you know that you've got ALSA, next step is to find the driver module for 
the card: I'm not sure of it, so check in http://www.alsa-project.org/

Then, get that module, and insert it. The instructions are there on that site. 
Finally, test the sound by playing your favourite file! :)

Of course, you  cannot! because you are sitting on a  branch of a tree
and trying to cut  that branch off! What you should do  is to see what
programs are  using the cdrom. It might  just be a shell  in which you
have 'cd'ed into /cdrom.

Simply, if  you  are  running on a  standard packaged version  of Gtk,
then all you need  to do is use your package manager  (like rpm -qa or
dpkg -l and  grep the output). But if you compiled  Gtk by source, you
can    either   run    'strings'    on   the    library   file    (ex:
/usr/local/lib/libgtk-1.2.so.0)  or if  by chance  you also  happen to
have the README file installed as  part of the make install, you could
check the README.

AFAIK  rpm can be  converted to  a cpio  archive. But  my info  may be

No! distclean  is similar  to 'make clean'  but slightly  different in
that it also deletes files  created by configure and friends. When you
run configure you might have  noticed that its slower during the first
run but faster during the successive runs (if you dont distclean, that
is). This is because configure 'caches' some of the info it found into
certain  files.    when  you  do  make  distclean,   this  cache  gets
cleared. (this  might be useful  when configuration changes  (like you
upgraded some dependant development library since last 'make')

However, If you want to uninstall, you should do 'make uninstall'.  Of
course, if your Makefile does not contain an 'uninstall' rule then you
are,  unfortunately,  on your  own :)    You can  either look   at the
Makefile and 'figure out' what gets installed (*VERY PAINFUL*, IMO) OR
have a neat wrapper around install ;) 

I  have this  bash function  as  a wrapper  to install  (install is  a
program that gets called by most sane Makefiles while 'Make'ing):

function install {
echo `date` $@ >>/usr/local/log/myinstall.log
`which install` $@
}


Watch out!  There  might be some badly written  Makefiles that may use
'cp' and such instead of 'install'.

Good luck!

Any chance of trying to find out what lies under the
DAX router.
btw, the tech specsheet ....
http://www.daxnetworks.com/Dax/Products/Router/DX-601AR.htm

The spec sheet:
http://www.daxnetworks.com/Dax/Products/Router/DX-601AR_Tech.htm

does mention support for NAT through the web
interface(i think)

Problem is I can't get past the call center lady at
Airtel Broadband to talk to one of their Engineers for
the required steps on NAT configuration.
 
All requests end up with a refernce number and a
"person will get in touch with you" reply.

Hopeless.

Best thing would be to poke around by myself in the
router configuration.



regrdas,

rpm -ql mypackagename

or if you haven't installed the package and want to find out
where the files inside a rpm file will go..do this..

rpm -qlp mypackage.rpm

i am using ALSA , and yes i tried both the settings.But it still
doesn't seem to work.
BTW , I also tried using OSS and ESD but to no avail.
Is there any control to raise the volume of Center speaker ?

  IMO, LEAF is far more difficult to configure and customize than
Routerlinux. Although the goals and approaches of these projects is
similar, and all eventually owe their origins to the LRP (Linux Router
Project), there has  been a significant divergence since then.

  LEAF is heavily forked, and mostly used 2.2 kernels, except for
a few recent forks using 2.4. It is typically a single-floppy distro,
so it's smaller - but it's far harder to configure, since everything
has to work before building the image.

  OTOH, Routerlinux is 2.4 + Busybox + uClibc based, and is
basically a small slackware-like distro. It also uses slackware's
package management tools, so you can add, upgrade and remove packages
from a running system. Lots of tools, including sshd, vi, etc., so
customizing a running system is easier. A partial list of packages
follows:

Busybox + uClibc (includes a lot of useful stuff, including vi and wget)
Slackware-like BSD-style init (very minimal and simple)
IPtables
Microcom
Pluto (FreeS/WAN)
PPP
PPTP, PPTPD
IProute2
Zebra (BGP-4, OSPF, RIP)
OpenSSL
OpenSSH
UDHCP
DNSMasq
RP-PPPoE
Net-snmp
Net-tools
Samba (optional, for NAS-type appliances)
rsync (optional, for automated backups for NAS-type appliances)

  Best of all, Routerlinux is a read-only root distro - only the
session-dependent temporaries go into ramdisk mounted at /var,
everything else is invariant. You can pull the plug on it and
nothing happens. Mine has been running for 14 months out of a
*hard disk* and I just turn the system on and off like an appliance
and nothing happens. It's a little-known and well-kept secret,
but hard disks are extremely reliable when used as read-only
media and kept always on, i.e. rotating. Just try not to spin
them down and up frequently - that really kills them quickly.
I have a Seagate 3120 (from 1990 or so) that's still going
strong, and it's now in a Routerlinux box.

  Routerlinux can also be put into a CF, USB flash, Smartmedia or any
other bootable medium, and it will probably be even more reliable.
It's also trivial technically to put routerlinux on CF - it uses LILO,
so it's no different from putting it on a hard disk. I also have it
running from DiskonChip (a single-chip flash device) on a GCT/Allwell
STB 1030N (an all solid-state x86 PC in a set-top box form-factor). But
why bother? - used, small hardisks are available for peanuts and
work fine. Whole headless Pentium I/II machines without keyboard and
monitor are readily available for peanuts, even in Chennai, and are
perfectly suited for running RouterLinux. This is Rs.1000 (~$20) deal,
not a $300 deal, although you can pay that much if you want greater
reliability. If you want better reliability than Huawei/ZTE/Cisco, it
can be done, but at a small price premium.

  My own advice: Get a 430TX or VX board (with 16 MB SDRAM), any
Pentium classic CPU, and an oldie but goldie Seagate 40/80/120 MB (not GB!)
IDE hard disk. Get two PCI 10/100 NICs (I prefer tulips, but anything
will do, say Realteks). Temporarily connect a CDROM, monitor and
keyboard to perform the installation of routerlinux from CD.
Once it's installed, remove them and perform all further operations
using ssh over the network.

  I have another great (but untested) idea: run routerlinux in an
unprivileged domain using the Xen para-virtualization monitor, on
the same system as your main Linux desktop. This way, the additional
hardware costs are zero, and you'll only need about 1% of the CPU
cycles of any recent multi-GHz system.

Message-ID: <200412140430.XAA01204@www20.ureach.com>

Hi,
  If you are not a frequent user of "find"'s advanced options
and find it a pain to remember them or read the manual. ( Which
is the case with most gnu tools like "find"), there is an
alternate way which I use.
  Use TCL language , ie tclsh (tcl shell ). The fileutil package
has simpler find function and file functions. In this approach,
you may need to type few more words to accomplish but the
commands are more easier to keep in the head. This approach
suits people who are not frequent users and are not looking for
brevity, but looking for ease of remembering.
  
 The benefit of this language is - you have the syntactic
simplicity like command line but a very powerful language
beneath.Most unix commands have complex options because of the
limitations of the shell interpreter.

I managed to fiddle around with the web interface and got to the NAT
"page".

The problem is here.
I can add a NAT entry into the NAT table , for which I enter the
*current* external IP provided by the ISP.
After I add the NAT entry I need to "reboot" the router for the changes
to take effect.

Here lies the problem, each time I reboot the ISP assigns a dynamic IP
which disables the newly added NAT rule.
I called them to ask if they can provide a static IP but again the call
center lady had no idea.

Toufeeq Hussain

Most of these are actually external interface IP ---> some static IP on 
the internal interface, I havent seen routers that hardcode the external 
IP, though dax might do so.

Airtel does provide static IPs with their router plans - dont ask the 
callcenter idiots, go ask someone in sales, say you want to buy a static 
IP.  Guy will be eager enough to get commissions that he'll find some 
tech guy who will tell him for sure whether or not a static IP is available.

You are  assuming he installed  the libgtk-dev library. He  might have
just  installed  libgtk by  source.   Not  the  devel. Only  the  -dev

Configure the firewall to NAT your pop3/smtp connections to the
Internet. Use iptables.

Depends on whether you want to do blocking or
non-blocking I/O. If you want to do blocking, you can
use the read/write driver calls. 

ssize_t (*read) (struct file *, char *, size_t, loff_t
*);

ssize_t (*write) (struct file *, const char *, size_t,
loff_t *);

If you want to do non-blocking I/O, then you must use
poll and select.

unsigned int (*poll) (struct file *, struct
poll_table_struct *);

Please check this link:

Character Drivers:
http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/ch03.html

If you want to send/receive commands, you can use
ioctl:

int (*ioctl) (struct inode *, struct file *, unsigned
int, unsigned long);

Enhanced Char Driver Operations:
http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/ch05.html

You will use the corresponding read, write, ioctl
system calls in user-space.

Bad idea! If  you want to do such a thing  "Properly" you should write
some XML RPC thing. Or if nothing is there to help, use nohup.

Easier - turn off rsh and use ssh instead

The interrupt handling function that you register is
carried out with interrupts disabled. So, you must do
very little tasks here and exit, as the interrupts on
the system are disabled during the time. So, you would
do only what is required and leave the rest to
BHs/tasklets. 

Rest could mean awakening processes, I/O operation
etc. Remember that during BHs/tasklets interrupts are
enabled and hence your code should be re-entrant. Also
in BHs/tasklets you _shouldn't_:
- sleep
- access user-space
- call schedule()

Why don't you check the example (short/short.c) here:
http://examples.oreilly.com/linuxdrive2/

There are also ample code examples in driver/ in the
kernel source directory which you can browse, study
and learn.

Subject: [Ilugc] Mail filter utility
Message-ID: <20041215015341.GA721@cs.utexas.edu>

Could someone here recommend some utility to filter mail. It should be able
to send mails (intelligently) into appropriate mailboxes based on the
content.

I am not looking for procmail. I am looking for some application that would
learn about the type of mailboxes I have and move messages into them (maybe
using some Bayesian learning algorithm, with user intervention, if needed)
appropriately.

The ideal way I would like to use this --- press 's' (for save) in mutt,
and I should get an appropriate mailbox name (which the utility provides),
which allows me to edit the name if the utility has guessed incorrectly.
At present, mutt gets the mailbox name based on the From: address.

Thanks,
Suriya

Subject: [Ilugc] Fwd: Call for papers Fosdem 2005 (26, 27 Feb @ Brussels)
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0412151000250.1132-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>


At the start of next year FOSDEM, the most important Belgian Free
Software event will be back again. As on the previous occasions there
will also be an embedded track, for which we are looking for speakers.  
All the necessary info can be found in the following call for papers.  
Feel free to distribute, and tell other people about it.
 
3th EMBEDDED SYSTEMS and OPERATING SYSTEMS track at FOSDEM 2005 
=============================================================== 
  
26 - 27 February 2005, Brussels 
 
Call for papers 
---------------- 
 
The 2005 edition of FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Developers' European
Meeting; http://www.fosdem.org) will take place in Brussels, Belgium
on 26 and 27 February 2005. For the third time, a track on Embedded
Systems and Operating Systems will be organized. The second edition
was quite succesful and attracted up to 150 attendants for certain
topics.
 
For last year's program see:  
http://www.embedded-kernel-track.org/2004/papers.html 
 
The use of Free Software in the infrastructure of embedded systems is
booming, e.g. by the use of Linux, uClinux, eCos, RedBoot, RTEMS and
many other Free Software components. More companies are supporting
embedded Free Software each day because of the reliability and cheap
licensing.
 
Operating system development has always been a very important topic in
Free Software.  As embedded and real-time systems typically have
special OS requirements, we organise this Free Embedded and OS
development track at FOSDEM.
 
This track provides a remarkable opportunity to present and discuss
the ongoing work in these areas, and we invite developers to present
their current projects. Technical topics of the conference include but
are not limited to :
 
* OS Development : kernel architecture and implementation, libraries 
  (e.g. Linux, BSD, uClinux, uClibc, newlib, ...) 
 
* Practical experiences in implementing Free Software in embedded
  systems (e.g. reverse engineering, porting  to (and adapting of) 
  commercial devices  (IPAQ, Linksys WRT54G,...), ...) 
 
* Toolchain and build environment  
  (e.g. crosstool, emdebian, openembedded, PTX dist, packaging, 
   scratchbox, Eclipse, Valgrind,...) 
 
* GUIs for embedded systems 
  (Gtk, Qt-(embedded), GPE, Qtopia, UI design with touchscreen, kdrive ...) 
 
* Multimedia applications for embedded systems 
  (e.g. integer-only decoders, Opieplayer, ... ) 
 
* Real-time extensions, nanokernels and hardware virtualization software 
  (e.g. RTAI, Adeos, KURT, L4, Qemu, User Mode Linux, ...) 
  
* Hard real-time OS's 
  (eCos, RTEMS, ...) 
 
* Open hardware and softcores 
  (e.g opencores.org, OpenRISC, LEON SPARC, FPGA's, specific design 
   restrictions for free systems...) 
 
* Safety and security certifications applied to Free software 
  (e.g. security measures in Embedded systems, SSL libraries, ...) 
 
* Free software licenses and embedded systems 
 
Authors are requested to submit their abstracts online to
embedded@fosdem.org before 3 January 2005. Notification of receipt
will be sent within 48 hours. Authors wishing to submit a full paper
(between 6 and 12 A4 pages), can do so in PS or PDF format.
 
The program committee will evaluate the abstracts and consists of: 
 
* Herman Bruyninckx, Professor at K.U.Leuven, Belgium 
* Geert Uytterhoeven, Sony NSCE, Belgium 
* Karim Yaghmour, Opersys, Canada 
* Peter De Schrijver (P2), Mind, Belgium 
* Russell King (RMK), ARM Linux Kernel Engineer, Deep Blue Solutions Ltd

I have mailboxes defined too. But, to save a message, I have to manually
choose from a list (a lot of keystrokes). I would like to press 's' and
then <Carriage Return> and be done with it.

I guess you are looking at AV and Anti-SPAM. Options are Sophos, Kaspersky,
ClamAV, AntiVir, eTrust, Command for AV. All these can be called from amavis
or mailscanner or mimedefang. Spamassassin is the most popular Anti-SPAM
software.

I've used MailScanner + Kaspersky + Spamassassin for a long while and am
pretty happy.

Warm regards

	from vmstat output...Clarification INside...
Message-ID: <97a0151404121501274a87ab04@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
Below is the output of vmstat command:

  procs     memory            page            disk          faults      cpu
 r b w   swap  free  re  mf pi po fr de sr s0 s1 s6 --   in   sy   cs us sy id

-37 -28 -96

Could anyone of you please write and post a script which will filter
information and show it?
It means that:
1.  if i give the option as "memory" then it will show all the
columns related to the memory heading in the vmstat output...

2.  if i give the option as "cpu" then it will show all the  columns
related to the cpu heading in the vmstat output...

...and like this for all the headings(procs,memory,
page,disk,faults,cpu) in the output of the vmstat command.

Thanks in advance....

My vmstat shows

 procs                      memory      swap          io     system      cpu
 r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in    cs us sy id

Here i get the fields using

$PROCS=`vmstat | sed -n   2,10p | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f 1-4`
$MEMORY=`vmstat | sed -n   2,10p | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f 5-7`

And so on

The sed is to strip the first line
Tr is to squeeze the spaces and cut to get the fileds I want

So you can just call echo $PROCS, $MEMORY, etc..
It can be made a lot easier if sed is used

Cheers

I dont  want to  sound like  nit-picking, but $PROCS=  is not  a valid

Could be done using the XMLHttpRequest Object.
http://www.xulplanet.com/references/objref/XMLHttpRequest.html

example:
<script type="text/javascript">
  pg = new XMLHttpRequest();
  pg.open("GET", "test.php",false);
  pg.send(null);
  alert (pg.responseText);
</script>

Google's Suggest makes use of XMLHttpRequest object: 
http://www.google.com/ac.js
Mozilla Tinderbox-SeaMonkey uses it to update info.

Balachander, thanks for pointing to the Google Suggest page.

even the entire Google Mail is designed using the Client Cookie, XML
HTTP method. Only there exists the transmission of xml data between
the server and client. as gmail installs a js lib in the client and
uses the cookie to store user info and processes that. there by there
is no need to anonymous data transfer.... in the same way google
suggest is designed i think

This link has a good guide on bash scripting

And thanks a ton toufeeq for the pun. 
But I was wrong there and so thanks Suraj for correcting me.

Subject: [Ilugc] Kernel source in FC3
Message-ID: <200412150509.04518.sathya@ultime.org>

FYI, RedHat has not provided the kernel source during the installation phase 
of FC-3. If you want to install it, the following ways are recommended from 
the README file :

In order to eliminate the redundancy inherent in providing a separate package 
for the kernel source code when that source code already exists in the 
kernel's .src.rpm file, Fedora Core 3 no longer includes the kernel-source 
package. Users that require access to the kernel sources can find them in the 
kernel .src.rpm file. To create an exploded source tree from this file, 
perform the following steps (note that <version> refers to the version 
specification for your currently-running kernel):

Obtain the kernel-<version>.src.rpm file from one of the following sources:

The SRPMS directory on the appropriate "SRPMS" CD iso image

The FTP site where you got the kernel package

By running the following command:

up2date --get-source kernel

Install kernel-<version>.src.rpm (given the default RPM configuration, the 
files this package contains will be written to /usr/src/redhat/)

Change directory to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/, and issue the following command:

rpmbuild -bp --target=<arch> kernel.spec

(Where <arch> is the desired target architecture.)

On a default RPM configuration, the kernel tree will be 
locatedin /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/.

In resulting tree, the configurations for the specific kernels shipped in 
Fedora Core 3 are in the /configs/ directory. For example, the i686 SMP 
configuration file is named /configs/kernel-<version>-i686-smp.config. Issue 
the following command to place the desired configuration file in the proper 
place for building:

cp <desired-file> ./.config

Issue the following command:

make oldconfig

You can then proceed as usual.

You can get details about this if you open konqueror... which opens the FC3 
Release Notes... where all this is clearly specified.. also don't forget to 
install the "udev" update...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0412151751400.784@news.goa.bytesforall.org>

>From IOSN.net

The IOSN is producing a series of primers on Free/Open Source Software
(FOSS). The primers serve as introductory documents to FOSS in general, as
well as covering particular topic areas in greater detail. Their purpose is
to raise FOSS awareness, particularly among policy-makers, practitioners and
educators.

* FOSS General Introduction Primer * FOSS in Education Primer * FOSS Government 
and Policy Primer * FOSS Licensing Primer

Draft for public review and feedback.


Localization Toolkit

IOSN is in the process of developing localization toolkits that will aid
localization of FOSS software.

Project workspace

For localization projects that require an online presence and workspace,
contact us so that you can host and manage your project on IOSN. If you
already have a project, let us know so that localization projects in
different countries can collaborate on localization efforts.

* Localization resources

Resources

Training Materials

IOSN also produces free training materials for Free/Open Software.  Training
materials for end users are currently in development.

* User Guide to Using the Linux Desktop

This user guide is meant as an introductory guide for a user to use a modern
personal computer (PC) running the Linux operating system.  The main aim is
to provide a self-learning guide on how to use a modern Linux desktop
system. It assumes that the user has no prior knowledge of Linux or PC
usage.

* Other Linux and Free/Open Source  Software training resources

iosn-general Mailing List

The goals of the mailing list is to help foster more regional communication
and co-operation. Especially to provide a channel in which users from
countries where FOSS is relatively unknown can get help from the
international FOSS community, as well as help each other.

If you would still like to be part of this community, you can subscribe via

Here's the output of vmstat on my machine:

procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- --system-- ----cpu----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in    cs us sy id wa

Assuming the output as above, the following (2 minute dirty hack) script that should do the job:

----8<------------8<-----------
#!/bin/sh
[ $1 -a $1 == "proc"   ] && vmstat | tail -2 | awk '{ print $1 "\t" $2 }' && exit
[ $1 -a $1 == "memory" ] && vmstat | tail -2 | awk '{ print $3 "\t" $4 "\t" $5 "\t" $6 }' && exit
[ $1 -a $1 == "swap"   ] && vmstat | tail -2 | awk '{ print $7 "\t" $8 }' && exit
[ $1 -a $1 == "io"     ] && vmstat | tail -2 | awk '{ print $9 "\t" $10 }' && exit
[ $1 -a $1 == "system" ] && vmstat | tail -2 | awk '{ print $11 "\t" $12 }' && exit
[ $1 -a $1 == "cpu"    ] && vmstat | tail -2 | awk '{ print $13 "\t" $14 "\t" $15 "\t" $16 "\t" $17 }' && exit
echo "usage: $0 { proc | memory | swap | io | system | cpu }"
----8<-----------8<------------

You might have to modify the awk chunk to suit your vmstat's output.
Want me to explain the code ? Buy me a drink ;-)

  Volunteers are welcome! We haven't scheduled another meeting yet -
it's still in a very nascent, pre-experimental stage now, with the
first experiments tentatively scheduled for mid-February.

  I'm in the data-gathering mode now, and if there's sufficient

Do any of you have an idea of how far the localization for indic languages is successfull. I doubt if localization has good audience in India. Please do reply me if any of you use localized versions and find it comfortable.

Personally, I feel that, though education in mother tongue is by far the best, Working with localized softwares needs extra learing effort.

Thanks for input, btw, 

suppose I do

#cat /proc/ioports

I find "03f8-03ff: serial(auto)"

how do I free this address space so that a driver can request for this
region?

Any pointers?

  If you dont load the driver the memory region and the Irq's should
be free to use.

 We no need to unload the serial drievr's To access
the IO-space "03f8-03ff"  or to acess the IRQ...we can
share the IRQ also by the flag "SA_SHIRQ"...

   I had did a serial port driver....
for  which user can open ,read/write data to serial
port....

i did not unload the Kernel serial driver... to load
my serial driver.....

u want to develop driver for serial port???
or
just u want to write an application for serial port to
read/write data???

or both??

Hi,
 The default command line tools may not be very convenient for
elaborate and sophisticated or customized monitoring.
 The following tools may be very convenient.It is summarised in
the following article.

 http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/7620/print

 The tools used are 
* libstatgrab  library
 http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/
* ssclient based on this library (system statistics client)
 http://ssclient.sourceforge.net/

 You can create TCL commands that wrap the C functions of the
library using swig tool easily. Thereby u get commandline tools
like interface and feel.

Message-ID: <20041216073853.37551.qmail@web50210.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

This is a proposal to form the GNU/Linux Educational
Society, or call it, "GNU/Linux Vidyashram".

The aim is to organize/provide free lectures (atleast
once a fortnight, with lectures repeated if needed).
Due to rapid developments in GNU/Linux it is essential
that we meet often and share/discuss our knowledge.
Saturday/Sunday afternoon is good. We can start
different lecture series for different time periods
like, 2-weeks, 1-month, 2-months etc.

Leaving commercial training institutes apart (which
are more industry-oriented, like system and network
administration), the objective of GNU/Linux Vidyashram
is to constantly provide free-training to GNU/Linux
enthusiasts. I believe the commerical institutes don't
teach kernel programming, application development etc.
The free-teaching can also be useful for students who
are interested in doing projects.

I am on the lookout for lecture halls/institutions who
can provide the facilites at a minimal cost (for free
would be great!). Having a projector will help as one
can see and learn from the observation, rather than
deal with monotonous classroom-board teaching. I
remember, some of the IIT-M Electrical Engineering
Deparment students asking for some sessions like
these. Maybe we can organize the same with them? The
lectures _must_ be open to the public though.

I would like to initiate the above under ilugc-GNU
projects. We need to first cover shell scripting
before we can go into kernel programming. I would like
to volunteer for:

- BASH shell scripting
- KDevelop/Qt designer
- device driver programming
- Linux assembly

Similarily, if more people are interested we can start
sessions for perl/python/gtk/qt/c++/java/php/ etc. on
GNU/Linux etc.

Your thoughts?

Regards,

K Shakthi

1/ This will be a lecture series for a month or two or
more. Something like taking a course at a university
:)

2/ This will have to be every week or once in a
fortnight.

3/ These will be long sessions (2-3 hours) with breaks
in between.

4/ Feedback/contribution from the outcome of the
lecture will be contributing to sourceforge projects
or GNU/Linux projects, in general.

Regards,

Shaks

There are several 'PC-like' routers (they are definitely not PC in the
literal sense). But they also have a  memory, a way to "boot" an OS, a
network interface (duh!) and <drum rolls please...> a CPU!

Hi,
 I like the idea. But here is my alternate thought. 
This idea, ilugc meet, all seems to be more  altruistic in tone,
enabling people to learn linux.People volunteering for no
financial benefits but for the joy of being involved in linux. I
think Linux needs more capitalisitic kind of approach to become
popular. 
 That is, you should help others to earn money using linux. This
is my view - Charity is not a self-sustaining activity. All
charity activities are indirectly or directly funded by
business. Business ( profit based ) is self-sustaining.
Therefore Business is equally noble as charity .

 Lectures can be on following topic.Say initially the lectures
may be free, later can make it chargeable or make premium
lectures chargeable. 

 Some commercial applications of linux can be as follows.
 
1.Enable DTP houses to move to Linux.
  1.1 How to design visiting cards, brochures using linux and
related tools.
  1.2 How to design business letters, project reports. using
linux tools.

2.Enable digital photo studios and Video studios to use Linux
for their editing composing and other manipulations.( Like those
they use for marriage videos.)

  Advantage for user.

1. These setups can use non-pirated software. No legal problems.
2. Save on money from buying commercial softwares. Most
opens-source stuffs are free.
3. Stability of platform.
4. No vendor dependency for upgrades etc.

 I personally know one digital studio, which  supposed to give
my photo in 10 minutes, took 50 minutes because the windows PC
was crashing as these photo manipulations use lot of memory. I
had to wait for one hour unnecessarily.When I enquired they said
 it(PC problem ) does happen often.

 I personally use sodipodi for my Business card design . I know
nearly everyone uses coreldraw or adobe and of that nearly 90%
market uses pirated stuffs.
  Create wealth using OSS and also help others create wealth
using OSS. This way OSS will become popular. OSS - Open Source
Software.

V.K.Vallinayagam

Please... When  you want to ask  a question, start a  new thread. Many
people  would  have  mail  filters  that send  'job'  or  'commercial'
postings somewhere. and it can become quite an annoying experience.

Message-ID: <20041216105758.64763.qmail@web51704.mail.yahoo.com>

Hai All,
  I need to run apache as non-root user(ex, httpd)
with no shell access. The DoumentDirectory will be
/soft/web and this should have permission like 
 chown -R httpd.httpd /soft/web.

If I need to update any pages, I have to use root
login, do change and change the ownership to httpd. 

Any other way to avoid using root login to update the
pages? I tried using sudo, but couldn't succeeded.

Sarav

What do you mean by "couldn't succeed"? you can very well use sudo for
this and thats the best way.  Alternatively, You can have a unix group
called 'webdev' and put the users  who want to edit the file into that
group and make the files/directories writable by the group.

Huh? Why select 'more options' ? Just select the account type, give your 
yahoo id (that would be without your '@yahoo.com') and type your 
password and press ok. That's it (or do you actually want to use a proxy?).

Be sure to use the latest version possible because some times yahoo 
changes its protocol, and it breaks old versions of gaim.

What do you  think is 'messaging' here?  Gaim is  used for *chat*. NOT

Gaim   taught  a   lesson  to   Yahoo!   during   the   last  protocol
change.  Hopefully Yahoo! will  stop changing  protocols from  now and

Interesting... 

DISCLAIMER: Random idea. MAY or MAY NOT work.

Create a  partition that is as  big as your  ISO image and then  do dd
if=fedora.iso  of=/dev/hdaXXX and  try to  boot off  it using  grub. I
doubt if this would work.

Alternatively, if you have a network card and another machine, setup a
bootp server that sends this ISO and boot from your network card. Huge
volumes of machines are installed this way in my organisation.

Sure you can but will need to lock your memory regions and
interrupts.Use your Interrupts handlers / BH / tasklets wisely, if you
need a safe driver or should be damn sure no one else is gonna use the
other driver,Which makes it virtually useless in the system (can
remove it as well).Why complicate a simple character driver ?

Sure. Most of the commerical training institutes spend
a lot on hardware/infrastructure to train the
students. Hence, you pay for it. 

The idea here is to help/teach GNU/Linux enthusiasts,
mostly programming.

Nope. There will be _NO_ payment involved anytime,

Correction. This is part of the GNU/Linux movement,
not OSS. There is a difference between GNU/Linux and
OSS. Watch The.Code.Linux.avi or Revolution.os.avi. 

I am planning to start "Bash scripting" series from
January 6/7, 2005 (Saturday/Sunday). Yeah! let's start
with the New Year. Should give me sufficient time to
prepare the material. It will be a three-part series.
Depending on availability of place, we can do it in
three consecutive weeks (Jan 6/7, Jan 13/14, Jan
20/21) or alternate weeks.

  Many commercial routers (e.g. Linksys) actually use an LRP (Linux
Router Project) derivative internally. So, yes, a Linux router-centric
distro can and is installed in many routers.

  Juniper uses a BSD-derived OS called Junos on most of its routers.

  Cisco uses Linux in various midrange products, including PIX
firewalls and IDS intrusion-detection system, as well as various
system-supervisory boxes. Most of these are just stock 1U x86
boxes running Linux from a flash disk, with a userland consisting
of both open-source and Cisco-proprietary software. 

  However, this doesn't imply that you can go out and buy a Cisco
CSR-1 and convert it into a Beowulf cluster :-)

Interesting...

DISCLAIMER: Random idea. MAY or MAY NOT work.

Create a  partition that is as  big as your  ISO image and then  do dd
if=fedora.iso  of=/dev/hdaXXX and  try to  boot off  it using  grub. I
doubt if this would work.

Alternatively, if you have a network card and another machine, setup a
bootp server that sends this ISO and boot from your network card. Huge
volumes of machines are installed this way in my organisation.

Sure you can but will need to lock your memory regions and
interrupts.Use your Interrupts handlers / BH / tasklets wisely, if you
need a safe driver or should be damn sure no one else is gonna use the
other driver,Which makes it virtually useless in the system (can
remove it as well).Why complicate a simple character driver ?

Sure. Most of the commerical training institutes spend
a lot on hardware/infrastructure to train the
students. Hence, you pay for it.

The idea here is to help/teach GNU/Linux enthusiasts,
mostly programming.

Nope. There will be _NO_ payment involved anytime,
whatsoever. Period.

Correction. This is part of the GNU/Linux movement,
not OSS. There is a difference between GNU/Linux and
OSS. Watch The.Code.Linux.avi or Revolution.os.avi.

I am planning to start "Bash scripting" series from
January 6/7, 2005 (Saturday/Sunday). Yeah! let's start
with the New Year. Should give me sufficient time to
prepare the material. It will be a three-part series.
Depending on availability of place, we can do it in
three consecutive weeks (Jan 6/7, Jan 13/14, Jan
20/21) or alternate weeks.

Regards,

K Shakthi

Hi,

I know you can mount an iso file using the
loop device option... but Installing an OS from
it is tricky. Someone has done such a thing..
see if that helps u.

  Many commercial routers (e.g. Linksys) actually use an LRP (Linux
Router Project) derivative internally. So, yes, a Linux router-centric
distro can and is installed in many routers.

  Juniper uses a BSD-derived OS called Junos on most of its routers.

  Cisco uses Linux in various midrange products, including PIX
firewalls and IDS intrusion-detection system, as well as various
system-supervisory boxes. Most of these are just stock 1U x86
boxes running Linux from a flash disk, with a userland consisting
of both open-source and Cisco-proprietary software.

  However, this doesn't imply that you can go out and buy a Cisco
CSR-1 and convert it into a Beowulf cluster :-)

Yes, OSS and GNU/FSF/Linux are different.
Glad to see people sticking to Free Software rather than move to OSS.

Again if someone else wants to handle Perl they are welcome too.

I once successfully installed FreeBSD from an iso immage while running the installation from a linux box. I used the qemu (PC emulator) like this.(you should be a root)

$qemu -hda /dev/sda -cdrom /path/to/iso -boot d -nics 0

Also, qemu is a very useful tool for testing newly compiled kernels.

..WARNING..WARNING.. Go through the documentation before you try, this is potentially risky and you can end up bith a blanked disk.

if u want to send & recieve email from ur free yahoo
id using an email client, use yahoopops which
communicates between  ur mail client (moz thunderbird,
outlook express,incredimail etc.,) & the yahoo
interface. it used to work perfectly till last yahoo
upgrade (when they gave us 100 mb) but now it wont
delete mails from server so u need to visit your yahoo
inbox manually once in a while & manually delete the
mails but works sweetly for receiving & sending
mails!!! download from
http://yahoopops.sourceforge.net/

regards 
dennie

or xine :)

Get codecs from here http://mplayerhq.hu/homepage/design7/dload.html

Codecs work well for both mplayer and xine . Includes real media/

Hello All,

Whoever is willing to join in the GNU/Linux Vidyashram, Plz decide
your topics (Don't ask anybody to select your topics with a list),
*prepare the basic matrials* and send mail to Shakthi.

I hope, this will save most time and confusion.

Thanks.

Yes, I would like to start of soon with kernel
programming (Madhukar, myself, and other volunteers).
But, we must first make sure that we teach shell
scripting first, as programmers must be comfortable
working with the shell (will need to understand use of
Makefile, insmod, rmmod, user interaction scripting
etc.).

Once we finish shell scripting we can start of kernel
programming, assembly. In January, we can also
parallely start application programming (Perl
-Toufeeq). Teaching will have to more applied, rather
than text-book oriented. So, we must teach by giving
examples on how to solve the problem, rather than
explain syntax usage or what is already there in the
book, and in the man pages. Maybe, you can also start
training sessions in your locality :)

The main objective of GNU/Linux Vidyashram is to
educate/teach people. We should also expand our
operations in conducting seminars/workshops at
educational institutions (schools/colleges). 

Sorry for the wrong dates. The schedule will be on
weekends only. Depending on availability of the
venues, we shall inform you the dates, well in
advance.

Thanks again,

K Shakthi

  Not really the answer to your query, but AMI
(American Megatrends) makes a 1U x86 embedded Linux
NAS appliance that supports 4 hot-swap SCSI drives
and connects via gigabit ethernet. This is available
in India for ~$4000 (~Rs. 1.75 lakhs) without
SCSI drives (probably not what can be called
entry level).

  I'm not sure about its innards, but it's probably
a Samba box that connects to mainly Windows networks
(perhaps with an NFS option also).

  Brilliant! Obvious in retrospect, but certainly the most

Hi

First, can you tell us what distro you're using? It's hard to make out what's 
happening, if we don't know that. :-)

Now, it looks, from what I see, like all the config files are missing. I don't 
know much about what should be done, but you might try rebuilding them by 
hand (very hard), reinstalling from the binary package, or downloading the 
source from http://www.mplayerhq.com and compiling it. If you tell us what 
distro you're using, we might be able to figure out more.

BTW, I notice that you're running as root - be advised that this can be VERY 
dangerous. I'd recommend that you set up another user with restricted 
priviledges, and use root only for system admin tasks, and log out as soon as 
those tasks are done.

Hi,
mplayer is a pain to get up and running from source.
esp. the config files.

Not necessary.
It looks for user-specific config files in the home
directory.
If it fails it falls back to hardcoded
configuration(default). This tries to launch a plain
vanilla mplayer.

Before this, did you go through the README file for
enabling codecs and stuff?

and... did you do ./configure --enable-gui , this will
install gmplayer, the gui frontend.

Second, try to get the codecs installed. This is
causing the problem.You'r trying to play a 'wmv' file,
a codec that's not installed by default in Linux.

Look below.

Now try a "simple" video file mpg or ogg.

Try Xv as the video driver.
This seemed to work for me.
set -vo=Xv during startup of mplayer.(chk README)

Again some codecs seem to be missing. This time for
video.Is X started when your playing this ?

Absolutely. 

I am also wondering if we can somehow record the
lecture sessions, and distribute them as CDs and make
them freely available for downloads (such as in
bittorrent). We needn't record them, just transfer it
directly to a pc or a laptop. Unfortunately, I don't
have a camcorder with me :(

We should plan out a year's schedule, each Saturday
(or alternate Saturday) assigned to each individual.
They can then decide on what modules they will be
teaching on the assigned date. Venue can be our
regular ESB lecture hall at IIT-M.

K Shakthi

If it is on saturdays then it would be better if it is in the
afternoon. I would really like to come and attend these classes.

Posted to ILUGC as a response (of general interest) to a query
about a course based on the following book:

> 
> Reference Book: Hennessy and Patterson, Computer Architecture, A
> Quantitative Approach.
> 
  
The book by Hennessy and Patterson is a classic (though old) and
outlines the basics of the RISC vs. CISC argument, with high
quality profiling metrics and methodology.

  Nowadays, however, the debate in Computer Architecture has
moved far beyond RISC vs. CISC - basically, RISC won the
debate, but it proved to be moot, because all the successful
CISC architectures also adopted the basic RISC design principles,
included single-cycle execution, pipelined execution, 
tight register-to-register data paths, load-store design,
instruction prefetch, etc., thereby nullifying the
advantages of RISC. In the end, x86 (CISC) won in the market,
leaving MIPS, SPARC, ARM, Alpha and POWER (all RISC) with
niche markets measured in small single-digit percentages.

  Most of the interesting work over the last 10 years has moved
into indirect execution (an external CISC instruction set is
decoded on-the-fly into an internal instruction set for a
very different core, usually RISC or VLIW), superscalar
instruction translation/issue, multiple-instruction issue,
indirect VLIW, trace cache optimization, zero-latency execution,
deep-pipeline optimization, etc. Most of this work was done
*after* the Hennessy/Patterson book was written.

  It's just very hard to do any meaningful new design in
that comes close to the efficiency and performance of Kings of
the indirect execution model, i.e. the P6, K7 and K8, all of
which are external CISC x86 and internal RISC superscalar
(they've utterly decimated most of the RISC competition on
a Unit Computation/Unit Energy (MIPS/Watt) basis). Indirect
execution is what has brought us desktop CPUs costing $10
that can do over 1000 MIPS and consume less than 10 W.

  However, the book is still the benchmark 'serious' book
on Computer Architecture today, ~15 years after it was written.
It's a pre-requisite, necessary but insufficient, to do any
serious work in Computer Architecture today. 

  It's also the main reason that all the good work in Computer
Architecture over the last 10 years has moved to Computer
Science (CS), rather than EE-type circuit-theory innovation.

 I'll recommend any introductory course on Computer Architecture
based on this book. 

-Siva (who encountered this book as a whiff of fresh air in 1992,
       after all the crappy 'microprocessor-based design' books
       popular in EE departments)

Hi,

Why dont we just conduct a poll of which time/days is comfortable?? many
people will have office working on saturdays. I would be better if on
saturdays it was in the evening. starting around 6 pm.

Old? The third edition is just two years old, and is thoroughly updated to
contain latest information.

The only reason why indirect execution is necessary is to maintain backward
compatibility. One might as well have a true RISC machine like the Alpha
21264 or the PowerPC series. The third edition covers all the various
innovations like trace cache which is used in the P4.

I don't understand what you are trying to say here.

I have not heard this before. I guess the ARM processors which rule the
embedded world, would rank better as far as power consumption is concerned.
What is the source from which you have obtained this information?

My feeling is that H&P is necessary and sufficient. I don't know why you
say otherwise.

I have not heard this before. I guess the ARM processors which rule the
embedded world, would rank better as far as power consumption is concerned.
What is the source from which you have obtained this information?

My feeling is that H&P is necessary and sufficient. I don't know why you
say otherwise.

Totally agree. ARM rockz. Their power management
controller (PMC) is very powerful and flexible. For
example, in AT91 it controls thirty peripheral clocks
and four programmable clocks. It uses four operating
modes Normal, Idle, Slow Clock and Standby operating
modes, which allows us to suspend/resume devices as
and when required.

  Necessary and good, because the area has developed rapidly and
well beyond the scope of the original treatment.

  That's the most important reason, commercially; but not the only
one. The main benefit architecturally is that it permits the use of
CISC code-density, reducing the bandwidth requirements on the I-cache
and memory hierarchy. That difference is *huge*, and utterly destroys
the pure RISC contenders.

  They've been around for over a decade, and made no headway. The
plug has been pulled on Alpha a few years ago (no further development).
The PowerPC is nice (I've done a fair amount of OS work at IBM on
it), but was never competitive, clock-for-clock, with an x86 of the
same era. It's still around, but with a sub-5% market share. IBM 
pulled the plug on most of the advanced architecture PowerPCs in the
mid-90s. Some good work goes on at Somerset, but Motorola has also
pulled the plug. It simply does not have the criticality to get
beyond this 5% barrier.

  We're not talking about power consumption here - there are 4-bit and
8-bit CPUs that consume less than 1 mW, active. We're talking about energy
used for a standard unit of computation, say a complete application
benchmark that involves executing a billion instructions. The figure of
merit here is MIPS/Watt, or Instructions/Watt-Second or Instructions/Joule.
x86 is King of the Hill here, with low-power ULV Pentium III-M and Geode
NX Athlon cores able to perform over 1000 MIPS/Watt, and ARM doesn't
come close. 

  ARM cores are widely-used in the mobile world because they have a small
die and are licensed inexpensively (at a few cents per use), so they're
easy for a third-party fabless company to implement (they're available
as synthesisable soft-cores or hard-cores for a wide variety of processes
as well). It helps that they have low power consumption, but that comes
at a heavy price - poor absolute performance. 

  The reason ARM succeeded in the mobile world is that it is 'good enough'
for the kind of applications originally envisaged to run on cellphones
and PDAs. It ran out of steam for rich media applications like video.
It's pretty pathetic on a pure performance basis, which is why there's
all this nonsensical crap about coprocessors and hardware accelerators
like Jazelle and MPEG HW codecs and so on. x86 moved beyond co-processors
about 2 decades ago. If there's one thing that breaks compatibility and
results in software fragmentation, it's coprocessors. Wanna-be CPUs 
have coprocessors; real CPUs have integrated high-performance datapaths,
usually many of them, with multiple-dispatch. 

  StrongArm (originally DEC, later bought by Intel) is much better on a
performance/Watt basis, but does not scale particularly well beyond about
400-500 MHz. Still, the recent XScale CPUs are pretty impressive but
have not gained much traction beyond PDAs (like the Treo 650).

  You can't go out and design a competitive core after reading H&P, but
it will equip you with the foundation to go further. There's been more
than 20 years of development after the original Berkeley and Stanford
RISC work.

MySQL supports Unicode. So you have to change few setting in conf to

IMHO, IDE interface will survive only for use

Hi,

IMHO, You should probably be getting a more definitive 
answer from Magazines like Dataquest(India) or PCQuest.

You can catch the *general* trend in 
Indian enterprise Storage here:
http://www.dqindia.com/dqtop20/2004/ArtIndseg.asp?artid=59686

The expanding Telecom Sector, Banks, BPO firms etc.
Could be your potential clients.

Hi,

Though not want to be seen pedantic
I guess.. perhaps.. you meant 56kbps(7KBps)

It's easy to get confused by transfer rates if not
properly denoted. Usually capital B denotes Byte,
small b denotes bit and supposedly, data communication
standards use a decimal definiton of 1000 bits = 1kbit 
(not 1024 binary stuff). so, 56kbps is actually 7KBps
and KBps is what you read in most applications like
your browser.

If you actually had a 56KBps(448kbps) connection you
would have had no problem downloading ISOs. I know..
Sridhar managed to download "Revolution OS" DVD rip
even through his 64kbps connection.

Oops. Yeah I know the diff between the two. It was a typo.
I have a dialup 56000bps connection and I have downloaded about <30mb

Bit torrent is not actually like peer-to-peer file
transfer protocol. It is a different concept. 

Assume we are downloading an iso. The seeds are those
who have the full iso. The seeds distribute chapters
of the iso to the different peers. The peers interact
with each other to get the chapters that they don't
have. In case a peer leaves and the other peers don't
have the chapter yet, you can get it from a seed.

So, you can _always_ stop a bittorrent download and
resume from where you left off.

One of the Internet connections (touchtel) that I use
for downloading isos, I start download at 10 PM and
stop it at 8 AM (free, during this period). I repeat
the same the following day. So, even if the download
doesn't finish in a 10-hour period, I can continue
downloading the next day :)

You can always join their mailing list and ask for
code documentation/help. Or you can try to look for
perl-to-c conversion utilities if you dont' want to do
it manually,

Don't advertise/publicize the use of BitTorrent for
book-warez, software-warez on the mailing list.

Keep it offline.

This list gets archived and we don't want a google
search for "Linux Warez Chennai" to point to the ILUGC

with alsa+noatun in my 810 chipset on board AC97 audio and very ordinary 
desk top speakers, the sound is simply superb.
XP can never come near to this. The same song is full of life which is

Everything looks great.
Its nice to have classes on consecutive weekends than
on alternate ones.

Newcomers will not loose touch of the subject.

Can someone make a e-poster/brouchre for this.
I would do it, but my GIMP skills are nothing to brag
about.

I might end up with one which has ASCII art done in
vi.

I can start Perl on 29 Jan if Hariram finishes Bash
the  week before.
Else 1st week of Feb.

btw.
This is just to confirm, the Vidhyashram classes are
different from the Monthly Meet right ?

We *will still* be having a monthly meet, right
Mr.Bharathi ?

These two books are excellent follow-ons -

    Curt Shimmel: UNIX Systems for Modern Architectures: Symmetric
    Multiprocessing and Caching for Kernel Programmers, Adisson-Wessley.

The focus of this book is on the advanced features of modern CPUs (virtual
memory, caching, smp coherencey, etc) and how they can be used by the
kernel/OS.


Another brilliant one is -

    Charles Severance, Kevin Dowd: High Performance Computing, 2nd Edition
    (Risc Architectures, Optimization & Benchmarks), Oreilly.

This one should be called "The Dummies Guide to HPC" instead!  It's an
_excellent_ read.

Both books assume a solid understanding of computer architecture, and go on to
enlighten the reader on how to write code that exploits the advanced features
on modern CPUs.

Hi All,

I installed Acrobat Reader 5.0.1 in FC3 as root. I have problems in
starting it up. Search in adobe website didnt give much info on Linux
reader. whenever i go to the dir. "/usr/local/Acrobat/Reader/bin" and
execute the file "acroread" like "sh acroread" it says UTF-8 encoding not
supported and the program gets aborted. Please help me with this and also
suggest me how to make it the default application for the PDF files.

Also I would like to know how to stop some programs using my sound device.
For example, when I am using "konsole" and "XMMS", and if konsole makes a
bell sound, from the next song onwards, XMMS says sound device is busy or
used by another program. I couldnt figure a way out as to how I can make
the sound device availble exclusively for XMMS or how to make the sound
devices work paralelly for more than one application.

Is there any way I can customise(add or delete progarms, for example
Acrobat reader which I installed didnt create a menu) my KDE or GNOME main
menu. (I mean the start menu equivalent of both the GUIs).

Thanx in advance.

Best Regards,
Mahesh.

Use esound.
It's not pretty, but you can play multiple sound files using it.

I don't know if ALSA supports playing multiple files, but OSS does not.

I am having fetchmail to fetch mails from my mailbox
using the following config.
set syslog
set postmaster "mailroot"
set nobouncemail
set daemon 900
poll mail.abc.com
        proto pop3

        is anandhg
       keep
       no fetchall

The "keep" command is keeping the mails in the server
and then fetches the mails. I want only new mails to
be fetched, so I added "no fetchall".

But this doesn't help me, on every poll, it is getting
all the mails.
How to make it to fetch only new mails.

Thanks everybody.  Actually one of the reason I asked this question because
I wanted to download linux iso's and I wanted to find out how best it is 
compared
to programs like wget or DAP(windows side).  I talked on IRC #mandrake
list and I found out that it doesnt actually improves speed but it 
actually reduces
overload on server which allows bittorrent downloads.

Anybody want to add more.

1. Make your Fedora installation packages accessible by one of the
following means:
   a. You can setup a lean webserver/ftp server on your windows box and
copy the contents of FC3 DVD onto the webroot/FTP directory. There's a
README-en file on DVD that will guide you through (about maintaining
directory structure) the process. If you can share your windows folder using NFS
(I'm not sure how, though), you can use that option instead.

   b. Copy the contents of your DVD (from the shared windows box) to a folder in your laptop's windows partition 
(assuming that you do have windows and an extra partition/free space on your laptop to install linux).

2. Boot your laptop using Stage 1 installation CDROM. You can create this CD by burning the boot.iso found within the images/ folder of the DVD, from your windows box. The boot.iso file should be about 5 MB. If your laptop supports booting from a USB pendrive and you do own one, you can write diskboot.img file from the images/ folder onto your pendrive, and try booting from that device on your laptop.

3. After you boot from the Stage 1 installation CDROM, when you are asked about selecting the source media, select the relevant option (HTTP server/FTP/NFS/Mounted hard disk parition) depending on how you setup Step 1.

1. Make your Fedora installation packages accessible by one of the
following means:
   a. You can setup a lean webserver/ftp server on your windows box and
copy the contents of FC3 DVD onto the webroot/FTP directory. There's a
README-en file on DVD that will guide you through (about maintaining
directory structure) the process. If you can share your windows folder using NFS
(I'm not sure how, though), you can use that option instead.

   b. Copy the contents of your DVD (from the shared windows box) to a folder in your laptop's windows partition 
(assuming that you do have windows and an extra partition/free space on your laptop to install linux).

2. Boot your laptop using Stage 1 installation CDROM. You can create this CD by burning the boot.iso found within the images/ folder of the DVD, from your windows box. The boot.iso file should be about 5 MB. If your laptop supports booting from a USB pendrive and you do own one, you can write diskboot.img file from the images/ folder onto your pendrive, and try booting from that device on your laptop.

3. After you boot from the Stage 1 installation CDROM, when you are asked about selecting the source media, select the relevant option (HTTP server/FTP/NFS/Mounted hard disk parition) depending on how you setup Step 1.

Add a `uidl` before the poll. This will make fetchmail create a
file with the list of message-ids it has already fetched. Note,
pop3 does not make a note of read-unread mails. So, your client
has to do that.

No. VCD players can access CDROM media alone. DVD technology is
phenomenally different in ways they are used to store/retrieve
data when compared to CDROM media. Thus a CD drive cannot read DVD.

external RAM? What is your hardware setup? Firmware is
different from a driver in many ways. Remember, driver

Does RealPlayer *6* exist for Linux !!

Isn't that like a dinosaur among media players ?

You would be better off with mplayer or xine /w realmedia codecs.

I installed the NVIDIA driver but the resolution does not go beyond
800x600 as a normal user. But if I work as root, I am able to change the
resolution to 1280x960 and it works. Second problem, my firefox themes
never get listed whenever I log in as a normal user but if I am root, I
am able to switch between all the themes.

I got an AMD 2800+ machine with Fedora Core 2 installed. I downloaded
the correct drivers, they even got installed correctly. I searched the
archives but could not find anyting similar to my problem.

Actually i could dload files at 6.4kilobytes/sec using Azureus. The
speed is good only if there are many seeds and peers.

This is really fast compared to the speeds of 3-4 I get usually.

If there are no seeders then you cannot dload the file until someone comes up.
You can dload the ISOs from the mirrors using wget or DAP if you find
it is really fast.

What is your kernel .config (particularly block and

Message-ID: <20041220154937.73656.qmail@web12702.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello all,

	I was planning a Kernel Talk for the next LUG Meet.

Here is the Topic: Schedulers in Linux 2.6
		*Process Schedulers
		*I/O Schedulers

Here's the breakup of the talk:

I	OS Basics			10mins
	* What is a Scheduler?
	* Process Scheduler Introduction
	* I/O Scheduler
	* Multitasking/Types
		*Co-operative Multitasking
		*Preemptive Multitasking
	
II	Process Scheduler(sched.c)	20 mins
	* Types of Processes
		*CPU bound
		*I/O bound
	* Process Priority
	* Timeslice

III	Scheduling Algorithm		20 mins
	*O(n) Scheduler 2.4 kernel Scheduler
	*O(1) Scheduler 2.6 kernel Scheduler
	*Basic Datastructure for the Scheduler               
          -Runqueue
	*Priority Arrays in the Scheduler
	*Calculating Dynamic Priorities
	*Kernel Preemption and Context Switching

IV	I/O Scheduler Introduction	20 mins
	*Introduction
	*The Elevator Scheduler kernel 2.4 kernel
	*The Anticipatory Scheduler 2.6 kernel
	*The Deadline I/O Scheduler
	*CFQ and Timesliced CFQ Scheduler 2.6.10 ?

TOTAL ~70 mins

I need feedback from the community on the topics
covered and if they 
want any additional topics to be included.

If people feel its too long, I can split the session
into two parts and 
I/O can be discussed on the next week.

Regards,
Toufeeq Hussain

PS: I'm no kernel hacker :), I'll however try to
implement code walkthroughs within the talk.

open the acroread file in vim and type LANG=C or LANG=eng_US followed by
export LANG on the next line. Things should work once you do this. I
think this problem has been solved in newer version of Acrobat Reader.
5.0.9 i think. To associate files, just right click on any .pdf file and
change the properties.

Sounds good. But, on which date?

If you make slides, do upload them and provide a link.

It will be good if can show a walk-through of the
schedule function through a gdb-stub patched kernel?

As soon as the GNU/Linux Vidyashram poster is done, we
can give a link for download. So, you can take a
printout and make photocopies and distribute them to
the schools/colleges in your locality. Can also give
it to engineering students who can post it in the
bulletin boards in their departments!

I am wondering if we need to create a separate groups
(yahoogroups, maybe?) for GNU/Linux Vidyashram
discussions. Are we clogging ilugc a lot? We can of
course use ilugc just for announcements,

The ILUGC mailing list is just fine for
Vidhyashram.ILUGC has a good audience/members-base.
Otherwise we will need new signups/members if we are
to get one on yahoogroups.

I don't think the admin would mind. ;)

Everyone forgets that ilugc has it's own CMS -
http://chennailug.org/sandbox/drupal which will be moved to main very
soon. It has forum module, which can be used.

be done.

    What I have done is 

   I have created a proc entry....and set some values

I can do the appropriate action based on the value of
this proc entry....So what I need is...how can I

I am currently using FC3..
I did not list it since there was no mention of Fedora in my
RHCE study Guide 2004 edition.

I have not worked in any RHEL edition.

How similar is it to Fedora. I know technologies are introduced and 
tested in Fedora and fine tuned in RHEL.

I Fedora sufficient enough??.

Will the examples and excercises in the RHEL study work in Fedora ?.

Thanks for ur reply

True . Not everybody can google every day and find out the things he wanted. This is where lugs come in handy where knowledgeable can give immediate solutions.

So is the case with a good number of passive lugc members who can not attend the meets but are ardent fans of lugc.

As discussed in lug meet, it will be session on python by you. In
case you cannot make it, I want to fall back on perl [that's what I
know].

You need to start the apache in different port say 8080 if IIS is
already installed. go to your browser navigate to http://localhost.
you would see the apache page. if you see, then your server is up and
running. if not, then start the server. put your files in the apache
root /htdocs/ folder for the php or else create the a folder and put
it.try test.php
<?
phpinfo()
?>
and http://localhost/foldernameyoucreate/test.php

Dont use "phptraid".  It can sometimes be pain for configuration.  
Separately download:

* apache
* php5(zip version no exe)
* mysql(zip version no exe)

I tell you it is much easier to configure in winxp.  Just
follow these steps:

1. (apache)

* Install apache(its just an exe), better to choose apache 1.3.28.
* Select custom to change to different folder location i.e C:\Apache

2. (php)

* Extract php5 folder to say C:\php5
* Follow the steps given in install.txt inside php5. I
choose to install as module for apache 1.3.28.  You might have
to add 2 liner in your apache's httpd.conf.


3.

* Extract mysql to say C:\mysql.
* Inside bin directory of mysql double click winmysqladmin.exe
* It will ask for username and password, just give some decent
username and password and you are set.

How?

proc entry is just an interface from user-space that
reads values from kernel space. 

What is it that you are actually trying to accomplish?

Also tried Dan Kegel's cross-toolchain scripts:

I feel you need to check back on your kernel .config
options, overall.

Hi Raman,

I would like to volunteer for:

+ device drivers

If someone else wants to take this, I am ok with that
too.

If there are any other topics that need to be taken, I
will be happy to cover them. Will the place be
air-conditioned and are we having a projector?
(thinking of getting my laptop, if need be). What
about transport?

What about playing The.Code.Linux.avi?

Regards,

K Shakthi

Don't know why you are using the proc interface for this, proc interface

Is for user space to look into kernel space.Since you say that _you_
have
created the proc entry, it should be possible for the kernel module to
Set or read the values directly from the other module exported
functions.

Still if you insist, you can use a filp_open call to get the file
struct and then use the member fops struct inside it to do writes and
reads.
The following articles would be good

I think phptriad does a great job when coming to integrating all the

Atleast for me.  Because I would like to have latest and stable version 
of everything(including security
fixes).  You will be depended on the version that bundles with 
phptraid.  Tried maintaining multiple version
of phptraid :).

I am having a PDC running on Samba 3 on FC 2. I have
one requirement.

I just added samba users by smbpasswd -a. I want samba
to change the password of users, if they chage their
UNIX password. ie). I want samba to synchronize with
UNIX password.

Is this possible.

Infact vim solves most of the problems for programmers. I have made use of it for almost all of my programming needs. Infact i spend the whole day before a vim-window.

*TIPS*
ctags and vim are the best combination to start off with the Kernel source.

Many useful pluggins for vim are available at http://vim.sourceforge.net

vim can be used as a hexeditor :%!xxd

vim can be used for view difference in multiple files. :help diff

code folding is available :help fold

Split windows are available :help split

a set of quick tips at "http://www.rayninfo.co.uk/vimtips.html"

Hi Antony
     In addition to what Toufeeq  said you can also use

        1) free (command line)
       2) In code we can use  sysinfo(struct sysinfo *) system call 
which is declared in <sys/sysinfo.h>

Regards,
Joe.

You can consider using ldap. Ldap is meant for centralized user
authentication & we can configure samba & linux for ldap based user
authentication. Refer the following links for details:

Can this be made non-continguous?

I am also wondering if we can have talk sessions in
the morning and demo's/discussion/tech support
sessions in the afternoon. It would be really
difficult to make people sit and listen to talks,
talks and talks. Gets a little monotonous.

Can you confirm the date for this? Planning to have a
talk by Toufeeq on January 8, 2004 for GNU/Linux
Vidyashram at ilugc. 

After the RMK date is confirmed, Hariram (for shell
scripting) can also shift dates in case there is a
clash.

This probably won't help you at all but just gives you a data point.
I looked at it two years ago but decided that it was not worth the
effort.  However, of all the available Distributed File Systems around
OpenAFS seemed like the best bet.  Debian woody already had packages
for OpenAFS that worked at the time.  The trouble was, getting it up
and running and configuring everything to work seemed like a fair bit
of effort.  The docs were good but a bit too verbose IMHO (but verbose
is better than no docs).  My biggest problem was maintenance and
issues with what to do if one of the server disks crashed.  Although
you can have distributed servers and setup a backup server it was too
much to worry about.  Instead I went in for Kerberos for
authentication and used good old NFS for file services.  This was OK
since the setup was for one small lab and not for a real large service
provider.

I haven't checked if anything has changed since then.

We can. This is only a tentative schedule. We can add/modify/delete.

I agree with what you say it is little monotonous.
We had demo session in St.Josephs with sprawling lab. Not even 1
percent of the students turned up. Moreover, I noticed college
authorities don't allow students to go free. In fact in St.Josephs I
saw students coming in and going out only in line like in schools.

Our talks should not always be based on slide. It should be demo on
projector. e.g when we show development, let's do a small program on
screen. This way it will not be boring lecture.

Every session will have question time of 5-10 minutes.

Since things are at infant stage I cannot say anything about the
dates atleast for the next 3 or 4 days.

Every seminar/demo-day conducted by Ilugc must be logged either in the
Wiki or CMS.

For eg., this is the event page for this seminar
http://chennailug.org/wiki/Events/2005-January/RMK

Have a look at this now!

It never seems to get old. While I know we're past the "gee whiz" phase in analyzing Linux and open-source's growth in the industry, looking back at all the stories in the industry in 2004 still elicits eye-popping, head-scratching and, sometimes, fist-pounding reaction. So as 2004 closes, here's a rundown of some of the biggest stories in Linux and open source for 2004:

I got my set yesterday! Been going around office giving them off as
Christmas presents :-)
The beautiful cover and CD label give an excellent first impression -
the trust level immediately goes up in someone trying out Linux for
the first time.

Subject: [Ilugc] My thoughts on introducing linux to newbies
Message-ID: <200412230908.EAA26987@www23.ureach.com>

Hi,
 This is bit long .Read it in leisure.
 Here are some of my thoughts on introducing linux to newbies.
I want to share these thoughts because I see such efforts going
in the form of  the seminars in colleges and Vidyashram efforts
etc. Basically, it suggests how to make it easier for newbies.

Basically when we teach newbies we teach them how
to do basic things in linux.Unlike windows, linux because of
unix heritage has a legacy of some 40 years. ( Assuming  we are
using command line approach than GUI approach ).So naturally
people tend to teach
Shell ( bash shell ), perl, GNU tools like ls, cp, sed awk etc.

 In linux, there are multiple ways and tools to accomplish a
need. Say one may use a combination of sed, awk or instead use
perl or ruby one-liner.Some of the reason for the variety of
tools are, its software development model. More than that, the
timeline. Perl language could not exist in 60's but could grow
in 90's because of processor performance/price improvements.

 From the usage viewpoint, these legacy tools are gradually
losing the marketshare to new tools. Many people use
perl or python or ruby to accomplish something that can be
accomplished by awk. Simply because they don't want to learn
awk. Eric Raymond, articulates this in his book saying that
people don't want to give precious real-estate in their head to
a plethora of special purpose languages and tools when they can
do the same with one generic tool or langage.

 In short, there is a evolution of unix tools and their
adoption.In the 60's people were willing to learn sed, then awk
etc and use shell as the scripting language because the other
option was C language. Now with lavish processing power, people
feel they can be productive with one or few tools and starts
dumping the other tools.Infact in ruby discussion group, people
toy over using ruby shell as the command line shell. There is a
trend of consolidation to few generic tools.

 But most of the times, people who volunteer for free teaching
in terms of classes or writing articles in journals, are kind of
linux veterens that they tend to use legacy tools to accomplish
their need. I used to see articles where the author gives a 3
liner in awk or sed, something like that. The Newbies getting
exposed to that kind of stuff,  gets a feeling that these tools
are essential to learn  and be productive in linux.

 They start learning them. They kind of get a feeling that there
are too many special purpose languages or tools to learn and
feel overwhelmed. Most commands input itself is like a
mini-language. (eg. pstops ). When they fumble using them, like
find tool or awk, they feel inferior that they have not reached
that "expert" or "gurudom" status and that is the problem of
them,  not being productive.

 My suggestion is why pass on the "legacy load" on to the next
generation unnecessarily. Here are some of my thoughts on making
life easier for newbies.

1. A shell with consistent and familiar syntax.
  Bash and bourne-shell are good for normal use. But if one
starts some "if" statements, or loops their syntax is odd. It is
because it inherited the syntax of popular language before 'C' ,
ie Algol. Incase of syntax doubt, try finding the syntax from 
the man page of bash, which runs to 4000 lines. It is a
frustating experience. Most of the times, I end up seeing some
/etc/init.d scripts to refer the syntax rules.
  "rc" shell is better syntactically. It was written first for
plan 9 . It is written to address this problem. It is lot easier
for the head.

2. A scripting language that is good in string handling instead
of sed,awk,tr, cut etc.
   Infact shell itself is a scripting language.It was the only
scripting language available then, so piping using these tools
was the favourite then. ( from 70's .. )
   My preferences are in the decling order are.
   1. TCL
   2. Ruby
   3. Python
   4. Perl

   It is difficult to tell all the benefits of TCL here, very
simple syntax that borders with shell, but has the capabities of
other language. etc. But somehow it went out of people's radar
after mid 90's.

   Ruby for neat object orientation.After using the iterators,
code-blocks,  doing loops in other languages seems so painful.

  Again time-line comes here, Ruby developed in '95 became
popular some 2 years before. Python was before that. Perl around
88. Thus object-orientation is more good in ruby.

 They say unix principle is KISS, ie keep it simple stupid. No
one will say unix commands like "find", "ls" are simple.
Meaning, one cannot keep all their options and functions in
their  head. In that sense the functions of the scripting
languages follow the "KISS" principle. Part of the reasons
being, shell as a language is limited in flexibility so
complexibity is moved to the components . 
 I don't say  we should not use these commands. My
recommendation for newbies is use it for simple uses for
anything beyond, go to a scripting language. It (complex Unix
commands and optinos) is not worth learning to use them for
complex needs. That was needed in 60's not now.

IMO there is no one-general purpose tool for everything, even

(One of) Unix principle is one program does only one thing and does that 
well.  The purpose of "ls" is to list files, "find" to find files, 
directories, etc. Thats where filters, pipes, come in to the picture.

Hai, 
  Chance to learn scripting languages is gr8.

But just a thought, Jan15 will be a pongal holiday and
students in school,colleges may go to their native.

It will be nice if you start from Jan 22.

Message-ID: <41CA9BA4.000003.27705@SRL>

Hi all,

I have an IMAP server which has a lot of user mailboxes and mail which the
users read through their Netscape mail clients on Windoze. However, some
users want their mails moved from the server to their client machines so
that they can read their mails (through Netscape POP3 clients) even when the
IMAP server is down. . Any pointers to whether this can be done ? Right now,
they are able to see only  the mail subject headers without the text bodies

Hi! 
  
    I have two comps. One running FC3 and another running Debian sid.
I need to transfer files between them and I have Ethernet cards ( on
both comps) and a cable connecting both those ports. What should I do
to achieve the connection. I configured both their networks cards and
then I fixed their IP addresses to 10.133.1.5 and 10.13.1.6. What do I
do for the other parameters like their DNS server names, Subnet mask
etc.

Any pointers!!!

Set subnet mask to 255.255.255.0 in both computer. Run sshd in both PC

Hai
  I am using apache 1.3.26 on debian woody. Now I need
to customize http headers for security reasons. 

I have enabled mod_headers module, then I include as
 Header set Server "test"
But this is not set, I couldn't even unset also.

But If I include as
  Header append Author "myname" , then its working.

What may be the problem? I am not able to change
'Server' value only.

To set the background and my credentials and biases:
my language route was BASIC, COBOL, C, Clipper, sh scripts, awk, C++, 
Python, Java
And I have written production code in all of them (probably totalling 
200,000 lines)
My firm favourite is Python.

And I find myself in sympathy with the sentiment 'C++ is easier than 
PHP'
I could not easily relate to perl and php for very similar reasons. I 
am very uncomfortable with
languages where variables sport $s etc., In fact I found it difficult 
to learn Lisp and Dylan for similar reasons.
Despite infectious enthusiasm of some PHP experts (Cheeni and Suraj), 
and absolute demolition jobs by perl expert(BGa)
  I found it difficult to cross the $ barrier in PHP and perl; and I 
found ruby heavy going too.

In fact I find it even difficult these days to deal tolerantly with the 
braces of C/C++/Java.
I believe that many people who like python, do so for  its simplicity 
and its use of white space,
while the majority of those who dislike it do so for the same reason: 
white space!!

My advice:
	1. Do not restrict yourself to a single language.
	2. Write or read decent amount of code in one language from
the C/C++ group
	3. then try Java;
	4. then learn Python or Ruby.
	5. Then take a look at as many of the following
		Dylan		Lisp
		Scala		Scheme
		oCaml		Mozart
	
I hope to l talk about the functional programming aspects of Python and 
my dabblings in Scala and Dylan some time.

"security by obscurity" never works

there's about a dozen ways to detect just what version of apache you're 
running

so tell whichever idiot "e-security consultant" who told you that to get

1) The Header directives are processed just before the response
is sent by its handler. These means that some headers that are
added just before the response is sent and cannot be unset or
overridden. This includes headers such as "Date" and "Server". 
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_headers.html 


2) How can I change the information that Apache returns about
itself in the headers? 
Frequently, people want to remove this information, under the
mistaken understanding that this will make the system more secure.
This is probably not the case, as the same exploits will likely be
attempted regardless of the header information you provide.
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#serverheader
There are, however, two answers to this question: the correct answer,
and the answer that you are probably looking for....


3) ServerTokens directive - This directive controls whether
 Server response header field which is sent back to clients
 includes a description of the generic OS-type of the server
 as well as information about compiled-in modules.

Thx for ur responses

I already configured 'ServerTokens' directive as
'Prod' which now gives "Server: Apache" only

Other Config which I did was 
  ServerSignature Off, Run Apache as non-root user
without shell access

Any other tips to secure apache?

(my idea is instead of broadcast everything, we can
secure as much possible)

You are making a false assumption that it was _only_
for newbies. 

Also, one cannot teach kernel programming to newbies
who haven't had a taste of user-space. And if you are
going to work in kernel space, you will need to
understand the use of Makefiles and scripts in
user-space. Getting to learn scripting is only a start
:)

Subnet mask should be 255.255.0.0. Check connectivity
using ping before you try to use ssh/scp/ftp.

Redundant.  Apache starts as root but always forks as an unprivileged user

Dont worry about the security of apache

Worry about -

1. Security of the php / cgi etc scripts you are running on that server 
(poke around for security advisories on formmail, gallery etc .. and 
read up on how to write secure cgi and php scripts)

2. Security / settings on the apache modules you run - mod_proxy or 
mod_php4 for example

IMAP itself supports disconnected operation.  You mail client should have an
option like "make available for offline use".  Enable that and then sync with
the imap server and you will be downloading the message bodies as well.

Most IMAP clients can do a full two-way sync, so you can sync the same mailbox
mail from your home and office PC.

cross-over, if connecting the two systems directly. 

If you are using a hub/switch then a direct cable will do.

i have been following this thread , it could be good idea if we can come out with a video of the
whole session so that it can it can be put in public domain for the benifit of all.

if video is not possible at least a good text document will do the job.

Well, with the numbers that the original poster has given, that
subnet mask wont work. the mask 255.0.0.0 should work.

Yes. For out station people like me who would be going to my native
place at this time text stuff and documentation would come in really
handy. Though it would be sad to  miss out on the talks from
experienced people it would be really good if the speakers especially
give tips that thay have found with experience in the presentaion and
text coverage more stress. Newbies to the particular technology would
find it helpful this way as these things would not be covered in any
documentation and come with experience.

I have a request that the talk materials be please put up on the ILUGC
website or Wiki if possible. I would try to attend at least the first
session on the 15th. I have to then leave for Delhi.

But all the previous values set in this thread
{255.255.255.0, 255.255.0.0, 255.0.0.0} should work. I don't want to

tar -xf archive-name

Read tar --help, or man tar.
But, I suspect that the archive might be a gzipped
tarball because on some browsers use wrong file
extension when saving, so probably what you have
should be a filename.tar.gz.
In that case, use
tar -xzf archive-name.

Check the file type using the file command.

security by obscurity is a rather older, but still quite stupid concept

"ethical hacking" Ankit Fadia style etc - that's completely bogus though, I

Hi,

 1> Ensure that u use a ethernet_cross_cable to connect both the 
computers, and plug them directly into the NICs. Next ensure that 
atleast one PC is configured to be 10Mbps, leaving both the cards to 
auto_negotiate will give you problems sometimes. Its always better to 
start with the lowest config (10Mbps/Half Duplex) and then try fiddling 
with various options and settle at the highest config that works for 
you. And keep the length of the cable less than 100 meters gives you 
better performance.

There are many GUI toolkits in Linux, the most popular (possibly the
best) ones are

1. GTK+ - http://gtk.org - LGPL (C)
2. WxWidgets (C++) - http://wxwidgets.org/
3. QT - GPL (C++)

GNOME uses GTK+ and KDE uses Qt.  Both the toolkits has bindings for
many languages, means you can use then for any language you choose,
except that Qt has no C version (as it is written in C++).  WxWidgets
is known to be buggy.  GTK+ apps does not look very great under
Windows, but they come close (eg. Curve theme in Gaim Windows).

You can start from here
http://gtk.org/tutorial

For python GUI programming, see 
http://pygtk.org
http://wxwidgets.org/

IMO, GTK+ is a lot more easier to learn/use than other toolkits.

TODO: put this in the wiki :)

And the windows version of Qt is not free.  Either Gtk+ or WxWidgets
must be your choice.

I'm sorry but I think you are being a little too biased here.  Each
toolkit has its warts.  wxWidgets is certainly very well used.  I'd
hardly call it "known to be buggy".

You might want to read this not too technical but reasonable article:

I have used WxWindows (former name) extensively before I switched to
Gtk+.  So I am not at all biased.  It is not only me calling it buggy
btw.  I am not sure about the recent version of it--it might have
improved now. (but do take note that not all wx apps use all feature
of wx)

The problem with your comments are that they are totally
unsubstantiated, so I can't respond about anything in specific.  I
have no idea what you mean by "extensive", no idea of what you mean by
"buggy", no idea what version of wxWindows/wxWidgets you are talking
of.  

I've used wxPython to do fairly non-trivial things, like write a
cross-platform electromagnetics visualization package using wxPython.
This was circa 2001 -- which is quite a long while ago.  I also happen
to know how poor GTK+/gtkmm was way back in 1998.  At that time there
was no choice between KDE/Gnome -- it had to be KDE.  GTK+ has had a
huge face-lift since version-2.0.  However, it is still not the choice
for completely cross platform GUI development.  That does not warrant
a statement to the effect that "GTK+ is known to be buggy"!  :)

Right now GTK has matured vastly and the widgets are really nice.
PyGTK has almost always been extremely well maintained and developed.
I'll also agree that GTK it is the one toolkit that probably has the
largest Linux mindshare (along with Qt) and probably has the most
number of supported languages.  However, if someone wants to deploy an
application across platforms (read: if significant fraction of your
users use win32) then I'm not sure GTK+ is even today a good choice.
Qt is a pain because of its license but from what I've heard its an
awesome framework to work with.  The big deal about wxWidgets is that
applications written with it look "native" on each platform, for some
folks this is very important.

The choice of toolkit also depends on your personal programming
preferences.  If you really like all the typecasts in C, and hate C++
you'd definitely pick GTK+ over Qt or wxWidgets.  OTOH, if you like
C++ its unlikely you'll enjoy GTK+.  I don't know how gtkmm has
matured to comment on how good it is today.  Some people prefer FLTK
to all the other alternatives.

As with anything, you need to know what you need and pick the right
set of tools.  Blanket statements of the "bugginess" of toolkits are
IMNSHO meaningless.  There are horror stories on either side of the
fence. 

So in summary, all the mentioned toolkits are usable.  Each has its
strengths and weaknesses.  Do your research, find out what you need
and use the suitable tool.  Unfortunately, there isn't one tool that
does "everything" today.

cheers,
prabhu

It does have (had? .. what about now?) more bugs than other toolkits,
writing a solid wx app requires more thoughts .. in fact, wxpython
hasn't become standard GUI toolkit of python because of many reasons.

Let me stop this discussion, not productive to me anymore :)

 TCL/Tk is the first one that made GUI programming in Linux/unix

perl,python etc.
 I have not used Tk. Just an information. More info at

No point - you'll find that this is one of the oldest controversies on

What is so controversial about this. Most of the mails on the list
should be replied to the list. This needs to be set up right.

P.S. : this went to Mr. Subramaniam first. I had to repost it. Please fix this.

two copies of the mail. Really the arguments justified in the article

1. hit reply-all

2. trim out the CCs

or

3. use a mail program like mutt or emacs that lets you define ilugc a

Some people might want to get a personal reply which gets filtered into
their personal mailbox rather than the group mailbox.

It is better not to clog the boxes with this thread. Please search the
group archives. This topic has been raised several times before. Each
person has his/her own preferences and it is not possible to satisfy all.
Please adjust to the current settings.

What are you going to use, to generate the HTML pages? I mean --- what is the
input? Are you going to generate the HTML code randomly, or are you going
to read in a file, etc.

GtkHTML seems to be a HTML rendering/editing library. Are you developing a
HTML editor?

you dont need gtkhtml for that .. you need perl or php

and you need snmp to query the server about all this

Message-ID: <20041226143806.CA589329E0@whitebox.dias.ath.cx>


  Just thinking out aloud - it should be fairly trivial to develop a
PHP/Perl script that parses the USGS Earthquake Hazards site at
http://earthquakes.usgs.gov, retrieves information for all earthquake
events, and automatically sends out an e-mail alarm when an event
exceeding a certain magnitude (say 7.0) occurs within a well-defined
Oceanic region (say the Indian Ocean / Bay of Bangal). This would
be similar to the systems already in operation at the Pacific
Tsunami Watch Centre (PTWC) at Honolulu, Hawaii and the Alaska
Tsunami Watch Centre (ATWC), both of which parse a network of
seismometers and issue automated warnings.

  The reason this works very well for the US and Japan is that
the Pacific Ocean is fairly large, so there's a sufficient
delay between an Earthquake event (which can be detected in
less than 15 minutes around the globe from the fast-propagating
P-Wave) and the following Tsunami, which could take about 12 hours
to get from one side of the Pacific Ocean to the other. This allows
ample time for a warning to be circulated.

  In the case of the Great Sumatran/Andamans Earthquake of 2004
(which took place this morning), the P-wave would have reached Madras
in about 4 minutes, while the Tsunami took about 2.5-3 hours to reach
Madras.

The time difference would have been barely sufficient to get a
message out on the Radio/TV and evacuate the low-lying coastal areas.
Difficult, but definitely well within reach of present technology.
However, it's another issue whether we have the civic discipline
to actually perform an orderly and timely evacuation in India :-(.

If you're OK with C++ or Python, I suggest that you look into Qt 
(http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/index.html). It's quite easy to learn and use, 
and I always felt that the biggest use of object oriented is in GUIs.

Thanks SRS, Jim for the info.

I noticed that the USGS site had a time
lag, but it has the most accurate triangulation. Also, they have
automated e-mail notifications, but they have too much latency (hours
to days) to be useful (as Jim noted).

The International Tsunami Information Center (ITIC), Pacific Tsunami
Watch Center (PTWC) and the Alaska Tsunami Watch Center (ATWC) also
had bulletins describing the quake and rather bland 'no risk
to the Pacific area' and 'possible local Tsunami' observations. In
retrospect, rather accurate but ineffectual, since none of the bulletins
were forwarded to the respective regions that were most at risk.

The 2.5 hour lag between this quake and the Tsunami was certainly
sufficient to get a warning out, even if very few had actually heeded
it. There's nobody alive today who was born in 1883, when the last
Tsunami hit Madras (that was a meagre 1-m swell from the explosion
of Krakatoa volcano in Indonesia).

I also observed that the USGS has updated the name of the earthquake
to the Great Andaman/Nicobar earthquake, probably because most of the
aftershocks and slippage seem to be happening there - there are a
few aftershocks pretty close to Burma/Bangladesh also, and events
are still unfolding. The Tsunami risk has probably receded now,
although another magnitude 7-8 aftershock can still not be ruled out.

Please avaoid Message recycling. You need to start a new thread for a
new subject instead of simply replying previous mails.

Your question is about PostFix and the subject GtkHTML.

Message-ID: <20041228072744.81495.qmail@web41725.mail.yahoo.com>

I am running a samba PDC with samba 3.0 on Fedora 2. I want to have logon scripts to be implemented on it like the following.
 
* A public folder on the server should be mounted as x: in windows
* That users group folder should be mounted a y: in windows
 
So I added a script named groupa.bat
net use x: \\server\public
net use y: \\server\groupa
 
I have 3 different groups, so I will create 2 more like the above. I will keep all these 3 .bat files in /home and I will create a symbolic link for each user in their home folder (/home/user) for their respective .bat files(Like for a user in group A, I will create a link called logon.bat to point to /home/groupa.bat). 

The problem is, how shall I make samba to look for the logon script file in the user's home folder and if I make this will it work.

Stick it in your .xinitrc .. and watch what happens when the user drops 
to a different shell / does ctrl+alt+backspace to kill the x server etc

Compile and use the kernel version for which you have the source and
then install nvidia drivel.  Or install the debian package for nvidia
driver (google)

1. Patch qmail

or

2. Run a separate instance of qmail on port 587, and dont run rblsmtpd 
on it - limit access to this qmail instance only to smtp auth'd users, 
and to IPs that are in your dialup pool / LAN etc (IPs that you normally 
relay for)

Hai,

  I need some help.

My requirement is

   create one /proc directory "ser_eth" and one entry in it..."s_e"....which 
is of type char *.

  Valid values for this "s_e" entry are "YES" and "NO".

  If "s_e" is set to "YES" , I have to load another module.
  if "s_e" is set to  "NO", I have to unload or do no-op 
accordingly....based on previous value.

What I have done is

  I have associated read and write procedures to this entry. I used the 
"char *page" parameter of these procedures to read and write the 
value.....But I am not getting the result.i.e. I couldn't read from or write 
to the correct values into the entry....

   Can anyone help me out, as to how this can be done...i.e.,to read and 
write the values of proc entry from within the procedures itself..

Thank you,
Chaitanya

Hi!

       Sorry guys. I was out of station for a few days. Any way I read
all your replies. I'll tell you what I have done so far. I actually
used 10.133.1.5 and 10.133.1.6. There was a typographical error in my
message and I had used a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 and I left my DNS
names blank. Then I tried "ssh 10.133.1.5" from the other computer.
 
      The details of my cable are as follows. The socket resembles
that of a telephone cable although slightly wider. It is the same on
both the ends. I connected it's ends to the ethernet ports on both the
computers.

     I don't understand what is meant by a hub. My computer is not
with me right now. I will try out all the subnet masks possible and
then tell you what happened.

Bye!

So, search for a hub / switch (the IITM lab should have lots, or they're 
reasonably cheap), or search for a "crossover cable"

You will most likely be wasting your time adjusting subnet masks.

Use request_module,

int request_module(const char *module_name);

This is from kernel space, in the driver.

/proc is read-only.

This value is stored in the driver itself. Depending
on the value (YES/NO), you can do the appropriate
function in the driver. You don't need /proc itself.

Ganesh,

If the socket resembles as of telephone jack and
slightly bigger, it is a RJ45 a standard to connect
ethernet nodes. 

if you are just having two computers and would like do
data transfer you need to have cross-over cable
ethernet cable with RJ45 at both ends. 

if you do not have cross over cable, then,  you can
introduce a hub .the basic function of a simple hub is
to repeat the signals that it gets . i.e., it
amplifies the signal and nothing else.  you should
find a normal hub in every place of your computer lab.
the hub will have number of ports on its front side to
accept the RJ45 mentioned above. 

take two RJ45 cable and connect both the computers to
the hub. now try pinging or ssh .

Suresh,

qmail with RBL is  reactive spam solution.  hence, a
email submission has to happen followed by RBL
rule/lookup execution.

hence, smtp auth will happen first, the email will be
submitted to the queue and then RBL rule/lookup
exectuion would happen.

The problem is that he is using rblsmtpd.. so what happens is when 
there's an smtp connect from a blocked IP, it will open into an rblsmtpd 
daemon, which does nothing except issue a 5xx reject and close the 
connection

So running qmail on an alternate port for submission users is an idea ..

Hi 

I just wanted to know if anyone has succesfully configured the USB
modem that comes along
with the airtel DSL connection. I just bought the connection a week
back and it works great on windows, but i am unable to use the modem
in linux. I use Mandrake Linux 10.1 community edition.

If some one has, then please tell me what to do in order to go online

/proc is not read-only. There are many operations that can be done by
writing to the proc fs. Setting console log level, adding scsi devices,
disabling the magic SysRq key, to name a few. Just like the read
corresponding callback funtion there is one for writing too.

Isn't this a little complicated? 

"Fully featured /proc entries can be complicated
beasts; among other things, they can be written to as
well as read from. Most of the time, however, /proc
entries are read-only files"

http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/ch04.html#t2

Using ioctl(), read(), write() can be readily used and
are quite simple for transferring data/commands to the
driver.

When signals travel through the cable, over a distance, the voltage level reduces and beyond certain length it would not be possible to distinguish between 0's and 1's. Hub is a device connected to the cable before this critical length so that it restores the voltage levels.

When two computers are connected directly, the 'Send' pin of one computer should be connected to the 'receive' of the other, Cross over cables are used to achieve just this.

IMHO, its a waste of time. Don't just waste your time trying randomly all possible values. Instead understand the underlying concept and arrive at the best possible value. The time spent in understanding is worth it - You would have finally saved a lot of time.

I have seen people doing this sort of random manipulation, this is especially hazardous is the linux world. Enter one wrong command and you are easily in trouble.

SRS, I think you got me wrong. I meant *any* random manipulation, not limited to subnet mask alone, is a bad way of doing things and yes this holds good for whatever OS.

I meant that one can easily harm oneself by running a command without knowing what it does. 

I was of the view that one should know what he does and should be prepared for the outcome.

-- A little OT --
I wanted to stress this point because i have seen people using debuggers to decide the logic. When a program doesn't work they just substitute various values (random manipulation) and finally arrive at the required result. This is not the right way. Debuggers are used to find the bugs and not to fix it and should be used only at extreme cases.

Oh - very true.

You dont really need all that much rigorous QA for most projects but a 
little systems analysis at the start, sitting down with a pencil and 
paper or whiteboard, does help.

custom authentication, it would be better to write a pam

right. xdm can  be very cool to customize and run  apps right there on
the DM. I  haven't tried much with  gdm, but I'm sure it  can also let

So does Alessandro Rubinis quote mean that "/proc is read-only." ?
/proc fs I reiterate is _not_ read only. They are read only, only when
the write is not implemented. Chaitanyas question was clear, he needed
help with writing and reading in proc fs.

Kernel modules can be written for a lot of other purposes than device
drivers. One cannot go about registering a device whenever he needs to
interface with user land.

Btb Chaithanya never said that he is writing a device driver, he only
said that he has to write a kernel module. Doing something like 'echo
"YES" > /proc/ser_eth/s_e' would be easier for a _user_ to do, much
better than forcing the user to open the device and calling an ioctl.

Also I don't feel implementing a write/read in proc is that difficult.
Please read the following link which is an sample implementation.

http://lxr.linux.no/source/Documentation/DocBook/procfs_example.c

In my opinion using proc fs is better for simple operations like this.

Happy 2005 to all.

Hi Vishnu, you need to start by finding out what
chipset your modem uses.  I dont have the same modem
as you have.  Mine is a Zyxel Prestige 630-11.

If you run the same chipset as this modem (Alcatel
Dynamite Chipset MTC-20158) then you are in business.
Get to http://sourceforge.net/projects/zyxel630-11/
and download the source code and you would be in

Just for your information, I asked them to provide me router (instead
of modem).  It will cost you an extra Rs. 100/- rent.

Just as an FYI, these sites generally disappear after a while when
O'Reilly finds out about them. Pity they don't have a low-cost version
of Safari for the Asian market ...

Here is another link which seems to organize kernel-related information well:

      The server is accepting the log from the firewall and it stores in the /var/log/message. I want the sslog to log to a different file like /var/log/firewall. How should I do this.

Yes, you need grub.conf.  It must be in /boot/grub/grub.conf (or)
/boot/grub/menu.lst.

Which one did you install? You need a bootloader to
load the kernel and ramdisk (if used).

Set your default to Linux and remove prompt, timeout
in /etc/lilo.conf

The grub config file  is in /boot/grub/'menu.lst'.  Please install the
