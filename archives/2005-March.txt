the acer travelmate i bought some weeks back (and on which i' typing this)
had a rh 7.3 install on a 4 gb partition.

The rest of it was unpartitioned - the dealer basically said "this is so
that you can format it, get rid of linux and install any random copy of XP
you have handy"

WiLan - you have drivers for centrino for example (ipw2200.sf.net), also
for atheros, broadcom and other common laptop wifi chipsets, on linux

I dont know about pnet., just use DotGNU. DotGNU implementation is
clean of the catchy `patented` areas of the DotNET spec., so its
far safer. Unless you exactly know what parts of DotNET come under
ECMA., you should not be using Mono. You could land in a trap.

Hi,

I am using two different CVS server. Both are using the same set of files.
If I do some modification in a file which is corresponded to one server 
that Version control will be maintained in the corresponding server 
database.
If I move that source files to another Server will the Version remains 
same what I had in the first server.

Example:
Server1  : file1 version is 0.87
After I moved that file to another CVS server will the version be same as 
0.87 or the versiob which it had already. Because the fie1 is already 
available in another server with the version 0.86

Need ur suggestions

with warm regards,
Anthony Jesu Ashok S Ext : 7257

!! Why are you using two different CVS server to maintain the same
code ? Please be clear about your setup. If you meant to say that you
have downloaded (checked out) the source code from cvs server to two
different machines (typical need), then here is the solution:

Here, it is assumed that you have made corrections in one machine (m1)
and you wish to synchronize it with the other (m2):

1) Identify your cvs repository details of your project
2) Login to cvs using your credentials
3) Once you have made the correction in m1, please commit it in cvs
repository (Command: cvs commit filename.c).
2) Then, you should update the correction in m2. (Command: cvs update
filename.c)

For details, please refer the following link:

  First mistake - there's utterly no need to install
Windows 98. Also a descriptive error - Windows 98 does
not work at all, so it could not have been working fine.

  This is a problem with your hard disk, either a
loose power cable, or IDE cable, or bad IDE interface,
or in some cases, a failing drive or motherboard.

  Second mistake, and bigger than the first one (how did
the thought to delete Windows 98 not occur to you?)

  It's never necessary to re-install a Linux distro to solve
a problem, whether it's HW-related (like this one) or SW
configuration related. Anything that can be fixed can be
fixed with a rescue-boot diskette or CD.

  Anyway, check your cables and try again. If that doesn't
work, replace the drive and try again. If that doesn't
work, check the capacitors on the system board (motherboard).

hi all,
I had downloaded gaim 1.1.4 and tried to install locally.
When i run ./configure an error occurs
GLIB >=2.0 is required  and is necessary to run gaim.

I checked the version of glib2. it was 1.2

I downloaded glib2.0 and installed it locally( w/o make install)
Now how do I tell configure the place I installed glib2.0. Can I use
pkg-config? if so how? or any other way out ?

Hi all,

Can anyone help me why this warning message is coming.
The expected value of b should be 0 but it is displaying something else.

Doesn't the warning clearly say what is wrong? An unsigned int is 32 bits
on the machine you are compiling, and the argument to the shift
instruction has to be between 0 and 31 (both inclusive). The compiler
would usually shift that by shiftamount % 32, which is 0 in this case and
I would expect b to be equal to a.

gcc is smart. The value of b is undefined if the right operand 
of shift is greater than or equal to the number of bits of the 
promoted left operand.

You are trying to shift the bits greater than the width of the datatype.
Try with
'long long int' which is of size 64 bits.

Agreed.
 
Busybox release 1.00 is the latest. If they have any
updates after 1.00, you can check it out from their
CVS.

> ILUGC is not your Linux Tech Support Call Center.

Disagree. 

I think ilugc is a great place to learn and ask
questions. You can't call it as a call center because
there is a social togetherness in LUG activities and
discussions that cannot be compared to the
straight-forward, business minded approach at call
centers. 

Just my thoughts.

Yes. Agreed.
But the person should know how to ask the question.

He should first check Google or a HOWTO.
Then have a well constructed question.

Not a one-liner which demands an answer.

        The fellow who posted the question can just google and visit 
busybox home page and read their release notes to find out the latest 
version. Most of the ilugc members should read the rules from the welcome

Hi all!

Actually I agree with all. Let me clarify, after googling I cam to know
about busybox-1.00.

I guess lets keep with us our individual opinion which will be anyway of
no interest to others or out of the context and time waste!

If you have solution or possibilty/suggestion, say yes else ignore.

Hello All,

I like to monitor the FTP Traffic of our Network with SNMP. I have Googled 
but it didn't help me out. I like to know if it is possible to monitor the 
protocols like FTP, SMTP, HTTP with SNMP-MRTG.

Please help me in this regard.

Thanks in Advance,
Senthil Murugan.

You should have done that before posting to the ILUGC mailing list.

No.
This is a community mailing list, not yahoogroups.
Mail sent to this list gets archived, if you google, this list turns up.
You cannot waste disk-space for simple questions/spam, as this thread is
turning out to be.

> If you have solution or possibilty/suggestion, say yes else ignore.

Again, It's your responsibility to check if answers are available
elsewhere before posting to the mailing list. If what you say is
followed we'll soon be flooded with  "What is Linux?" mails.

Hi All,
Vanakkam,

I have uploaded updated Tamil Language pack for firefox 1.1 in this 
location: http://thamizha.com/developer/mozilla/ta-IN-ff-10.xpi

This pack is working fine in Mandrake 10.1 , Windows98 & WindowsXP OS.

Suggested steps for using Tamil pack in Firefox 1.1:
1. Download the Tamil Language to your local machine from 
http://thamizha.com/developer/mozilla/ta-IN-ff-10.xpi
2. Install the language in firefox (using Fire -> Open menu item )
3. Download & Install Locale switcher extension from this Location:
https://addons.update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&version=1.0&id=356
or
http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/switch-locales/
4. close & Open Firefox application.
5. Now you would be able to switch to Tamil or English using Tools --> 
Languages menu (which would now show English & Tamil under it)

Anbudan,
Mugunth

P.S.
Thanks a lot Vijay for your valuable feedback and help in creation of 
this updated Tamil pack

Hi!

   I know that my power cable is loose. By power cable I mean the cable that supplies the power to the hard drives. I know that because my system suddenly hangs and when I tinker with that cable it suddenly springs back to life. Nevertheless I am not able to shut it down. It keeps giving errors like " not able to access hdc .. some number  ..Journal aborted" By spinging back to life I mean that I am able to use the mouse, the keyboard responds but is unable to open any application. 

   Does anybody know a solution to this problem. I know that I have to change those wires. But is such a change possible. Will I have to change the entire power cable setup? 
    
     I have bought a harddisk recently and I don't want to spoil it. So far it shows 1.1% as non contiguous when performing those regular checks once every 30 mounts of the hard drive. By the way if the Operating system that I use is of any importance in this regard, I use grub with Windows, Debian and Fedora Core 1. I use Debian 90% of the time and that is where I saw those errors. 

Bye!

it'll be some sort of a discussion where MS student champs, employees

Hello All,

Thanks for your prompt response.

I am currently monitoring my network traffic through SNMP and producing the 
graph using the MRTG. Is there any other way for producing the FTP Traffic 
(MRTG graph) similar to monitoring the ethernet card interface through 
SNMP - MRTG.

Thanks,
Senthil Murugan

  Please try to terminate your lines within 80 chars, and don't
rely on auto line-wrap. It messes up the formatting of replies on
lots of text-mode mail clients.

  Anyway, there are several fixes possible:

1) Find one power connector, out of the 3 or 4 molex connectors from
the SMPS, that works well, and use it for the hard disk. Dummy out
the defective/loose connector or use it for a less critical peripheral,
like a DVD drive.

2) Try using a pair of tweezers to adjust the fit of the inner metallic
sleeve contacts on the defective molex connector from the SMPS. Slightly
tightening them usually works.

3) Replace the entire SMPS with a new, higher-quality unit.

Hi ,
I hope after switching the language to tamil , you have closed firefox 
and opened again.

Else please try this option:
type about:config in address bar.

And search for entry "general.useragent.locale" and change to ta-IN there.
Then close firefox and open again.

In Mandrake 10.1 OS I tried this pack, I already had few GPLed Unicode 
tamil fonts.
I am not sure if the problem is because of non availability of 
tamil(unicode) fonts in the OS. Need to investigate.

There are about 10 Unicode Free (GPLed) Tamil Fonts available with us.
Free Tamil fonts installer for windows can be downloaded from: 
http://thamizha.com/modules/mydownloads/viewcat.php?cid=6

I need help to create an rpm for Tamil Free Unicode fonts so that it can 
be used by Linux Community.

Regards,
Mugunth

P.S.
The version of Firefox should be 1.0.1 (not 1.1 as mentioned in my 
mail.) Its a typo error.

One Day One Command :-
====================

tee - Read from stdin and write to stdout and files

Summary : 

Tee will copy the stdin to file(s) and also to stdout output. Actually
tee is doing the redirection. The following ASCII art will shows "How
Tee works".

StdIn >---+---> StdOut
          |
          |
          |
          V 
        File(s)

Examples :

$ tee   -- Read from stdin and write into stdout.

$ tee f1 f2 -- Read from stdin and write into stdout, f1 & f2.

$ tee -i myfile -- Same as above. But it will ignore the interrupt 
                   signals (Ex: ctrl+C).

$ tee -a myfile -- Read from stdin and write into stdout & append to
                   myfile.

$ who | tee myfile -- Store the output of who to myfile and also write 
                      to stdout.

$ ls -1 | tee f1 f2 | wc -l -- Store the ls output in f1, f2 & write
                               the count of all files on stdout.

Read : man tee
 
Bye :)

Greetings!

We all know Linux is the kernel and the entire system
is referred to as GNU/Linux.

We need to emphasize the importance of the GNU project
and FSF. Over the years, the media and others have
been calling the system incorrectly as Linux. We all
know that without GNU softwares and packages, Linux is
not functional. We can't even compile Linux without
the GNU C Compiler (gcc).

As professionals, we ourselves shouldn't make the
mistake. 

I would like to make a request on changing our LUG
name to either:

Indian GNU/Linux User's Group, Chennai (IGLUGC)

or

Chennai GNU/Linux User's Group (CGLUG)

Thanks,

K Shakthi

I think GNU and FSF need to be emphasised. It might sound absolutely 
unnecessary now but in long run, it is going to surely help.

Not all. Only some people. There are others who think that the entire
download/CD/ISO/whatever is indeed Linux.

For someone deploying it as a webserver, it is not functional without
apache either. Someone who wants a fileserver - it is not functional
without samba. Someone wants a DNS server - not functional without
Bind. Mail server - not functional without Sendmail or Postfix or
Qmail.

So let us call it Apache/Samba/ISC/DJB/GNU/Linux?

IIRC, ICC could also be used to compile the Linux kernel.

I'd rather suggest a separate list altogether and leave ilugc alone.

Sorry for the topic highjack, but India would have survived and would have 
been in better shape without Gandhi, so Gandhi/India is the most 
ridiculous thing ever.

Mahatma Gandhi is more relevant today, than ever before. If we would 
like to save ourselves from the mischief of WTO, TRIPS and a lot of 
other Gattastrophes and Operation Recolonisations, there is no other way 
out, but to realise the value of his teachings, and act upon them.  
 FYI, the globalisation regime is shamelessly backed by brute force, and 
the humiliating perversion of Patent Laws forced on us, is a serious 
matter that will take us back to the days of colonisation Dr. Vandana 
Shiva has written about the relevance of //Gandhi in  the pressing 
matters of the day at http://www.navdanya.org/movement/gandhi_pf.htm 
 Satish Kumar has written a nice article which is avaiable at 
http://www.sustaindane.org/main/gandhis_swadeshi.html .  "Note on 
Gandhi" written by  Huxley, is available online at 
http://www.swaraj.org/huxley.htm  Swaraj and swadesh are still distant 
dreams not only for Indians, but for the rest of the world as well. 
 Please wake up and act in *our* own interest.

>From bash's manpage:

       When  bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-inter-
       active shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes  com-
       mands  from  the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.

I'd recommend anyone with doubts on the order bash processes its
various startup files to read the bash manpage (specifically, the
section called INVOCATION).

Hai,

I used to send mail from command line using 'mail'
command.I am running a smtp server for this.It works
fine.

Now I need to stop my sendmail and want to use one
common smtp server. How to specify smtp server in the
mail command?  ( I couldn't get from any source)

Is there any other way to send mail from the command
line using other smtp server?

Sarav

You can't do that. /bin/mail just calls /path/to/sendmail on Unix
systems - the actual processing of the mail is done by sendmail.

You could try some other options - like Nail
(http://nail.sourceforge.net) which offers a /bin/mail -like interface
for backward compatibility and implements an SMTP client.

Message-ID: <42271A4B.8020300@sancharnet.in>

Dear All
The Revised syllabus for Computer Science for Higher Secondary First 
Year consist of  the following
1) Introduction to Linux
2) File Handling
3) Linux Commands
4) Vi editor
5) Shell Scripts
Theory : 10 Classes    Practical : 20 Classes

But , the syllabus also includes Windows and its applications for 10 
Theory classes and 15 Practical Classes.
I am not sure what type of commands and scripting will be introduce.
More over, it is not continuing  in +2 Syllabus. [ where C++ is introduced ]

Hope in the coming years it will be converted towards GNU / Linux and 
Open Source / Free Softwares.

One Day One Command :-
====================

seq -- Prints a sequence of Nos to Stdout.

Summary : 

`seq' prints the numbers from Start to End in steps.  By default,
Start and Step are 1, and by default each number is separated by 
a new line. All numbers can be reals, not just integers.

Examples :

$ seq 6 -- Print Nos from 1 to 6.

$ seq 2 6 -- Print Nos from 2 to 6.

$ seq .1 .5 10 -- Real numbers with factional step value 0.1. 

$ seq 10 100 10000 -- Print Nos from 10 to 10K with step value 100.

$ seq -w 10 100 10000 -- All Nos are printed equal width.

$ seq -s' ' 1 2 10 -- Each number is separated by SPACE.

$ seq -f %1.f 1000000 1000001 -- Print Nos with no exponent and no 
                                 decimal point.

$ seq -f %e 1 5 -- Print Nos with exponent and decimal point.

Note: 
1) Fractional increment may NOT end with END value.
2) For more formatting detail is avail in info page.

Hi All, 

After googling, I want some more on this:

I am looking for only stable awk version that goes well for a gcc-3.4.1
arm cross tool chain I have.

Please, I don't need busybox support of awk, which is working fine..

I just want to know..if anybody has tried only awk or sed in this case
other than busybox..

Looking for a response..

Hi again,
      Is it possible to send mail from a shell script.
I tried the mail command but it doesn;t work. The
sendmail service was running.

mail -s test mail mail_id@server.com
Is there any additional configuration required ....


     I downloaded the CVS for linux from cvshome.org
installed it according to steps given in the same
portal. But I couldn;t run the cvspserver service. I
can see a entry in the /etc/services but when I run it
service cvspserver It tells me unrecognized service.
Any idea if i have missed somethuing

cd cvs_linux/
bunzip2 -d cvs-1.11.19.tar.bz2
tar -xvf cvs-1.11.19.tar
cd cvs-1.11.19
vi INSTALL
./configure
make install
vi /etc/services
vi /etc/xinetd.conf
services xinetd restart
man nmap
nmap
nmap localhost
service cvspserver
The version which i downloaded is cvs-1.11.19

It is really very good news. It will reduce our burden and now it is
easy to push other information abt GNU/Linux to the student community.

Thiagu, Do you know, Who is pushing this into syllabus ??

Would it make sense to include Python in +1? Read why Python is a good

You can setup sendmail to act as a 'smarthost', which means,
for all mails it receives with a non-local To address, it will send it
to the smtp server you specify.
Google for sendmail and smarthost, although, I should say that messing
around with sendmail's config is not for everyone. Try your luck.

It is for everyone if you follow the instructions and use sendmail.mc
instead of vi sendmail.cf

If you typed this exactly as it is, then it won't work. You need to
have single quotes to protect the '\' character. Like this:

--http-user='DOMAIN\USERNAME'

Hi,

My NetBSD box seems to die if left idle for too long.
The only clue I get is from /var/log/messages.

The culprit is:

Dec  2 01:30:11  /netbsd: viaide0:0:0: lost interrupt
Dec  2 01:30:11  /netbsd: type: ata tc_bcount: 8192   
tc_skip: 0

googling on google/bsd brings up results where this
error is associated with a Promise IDE Controller,
which is not part of my H/W setup.

Any suggestions?

Toufeeq Hussain

1. You need a Web page.
2. Your Web page needs a reasonable URL.
3. You need a regular meeting location.
4. You need a regular meeting time.
5. You need to avoid meeting-time conflicts.
6. You need to make sure that meetings happen as advertised, without fail.
7. You need a core of several Linux enthusiasts.
8. Your core volunteers need out-of-band methods of communication.
9. You need to get on the main lists of LUGs, and keep your entries accurate.

11. Design your Web page to be forgiving of deferred maintenance.
12. Always include the day of the week, when you cite event dates. Always check 
that day of the week, first, using gcal [2]  (or cal). gcal is your friend.
13. Place time-sensitive and key information prominently near the top of your 
main Web page.
14. Include maps and directions to your events.
15. Emphasise on your main page that your meeting will be free of charge and 
open to the public (if it is).
16. You'll want to include an RSVP "mailto" hyperlink, on some events.
17. Use referral pages.
18. Make sure every page has a revision date and maintainer link.
19. Check all links, at intervals.
20. You may want to consider establishing a LUG mailing list.
21. You don't need to be in the Internet Service Provider business.
22. Don't go into any other business, either.
23. Walk the walk.

LUG checklist.

The following checklist may be useful for your group, once established.

1. Web page:

a. Meetings:
[ ] Current meeting info? Is it prominent?
[ ] Day of the week? Beginning time? Ending time?
[ ] Double-checked day/date matches against a calendar?
(E.g., is the "Friday, March 28" you listed an error, because the 28th is a 
Thursday?)
[ ] Location?
[ ] Map?
[ ] Directions (car, public transit)? Parking tips?
[ ] Information on the next several meetings?
[ ] RSVP mailto link on meetings where this is needed?
[ ] Note that meetings are free and open to the public (if they are)?
[ ] If there's a special fee, is it disclosed next to the event listing?
[ ] If location / time / date formula has changed recently, is this noted 
prominently?
[ ] Have you checked for event conflicts with other nearby groups, or with 
holidays?

b. General:
[ ] Includes event date-formulas (e.g., 4th Tuesdays)? Prominently?
[ ] Maintainer mailto link?
[ ] Last-revised date?

c. Periodically (maybe every quarter):
[ ] Checked all links on your site for dead links?
[ ] Checked your Web server's logs for pages requested but not found? (You'll 
want to put a referral page at that URL.)
[ ] Read all your Web content attentively for outdated content?

2. Other, periodical:
[ ] Reviewed/updated all LUG lists that have entries concerning your group?
[ ] Reviewed all sites that link to yours? Advised their webmasters of needed 
corrections?

Last revised: 2003-08-04

Having seen (and run) quite a few Linux user groups (LUGs), and observed some 
thrive and others die, I can hazard some firm recommendations. If you're 
thinking of starting a LUG, or are running one now, please ponder these 
lessons, drawn from other LUGs' experience. In fact, please consider reviewing 
this list from time to time, as a kind of checklist.

via ide controllers are a fairly generic chipset
but yes it is a buggy ide controller .. hardware related anyway

This was supposed to be a DNS Server for my home LAN.
I guess that idea is out with the VIA IDE chipset.
I tried to mix-match IDE cables/slots but no luck.

Guess I need to maintain a teenie-weenie bit of disk
activity so that the box doesnt die down but is still
good enought to perform as a DNS Server.

Our response to the ordinance is enclosed below.  It is now clear that
the Patents (Amendment) Bill, 2005, to replace the Patents (Amendment)  
Ordinance, 2004 (No. 7 of 2004) promulgated on 26.12.2994, would be
taken up during the first part of the Budget Session, 2005, and the
same would be placed before a Standing Committee for further discussion 
upon the Bill.  Please feel free to comment on the representation 
prepared earlier, so that we may send in better demands to the Standing 
Committee.  Please confine this thread to the amendments proposed to 
Section 3(k) *only*, which is of immediate interest to the FSF India.

The others amendments are more serious and will surely ruin life, but
they have to be dealt with separately.

Thanks,
Ramanraj.

  Representation made  by the Free  Software Foundation  of India
     to the Government of India to immediately withdraw
 THE PATENTS (AMENDMENT) ORDINANCE, 2004 (Ordinance No. 7 of 2004)
with regard to amendments made to Section 3(k) of the Patents Act, 1970

Introduction:

The  Free Software Foundation  of India  is a  non-profit organisation
promoting  the development,  awareness, and  use of  free  software in
India.  We are very concerned  about the recent amendments made to the
Patents  Act,  1970,  by  the  Patents  (Amendment)  Ordinance,  2004,
amending the provisions with regard to computer programs as follows:

   "3. In section 3 of the  principal Act, (a) in clause (d), for the
   words new use  , the words mere new use  shall be substituted; (b)
   for  clause  (k),  the  following clauses  shall  be  substituted,
   namely:

   (k)  a  computer  programme   per  se  other  than  its  technical
   application to industry or a combination with hardware;

   (ka) a mathematical method or a business method or algorithms;"

Allowing  patents over  any  kind of  computation  seriously harm  and
hamper the  creativity, productivity and freedom  of all, particularly
software developers while writing code.  Many organisations, including
the Free  Software Foundation  have been campaigning  against software
patents the world  over. We are shocked and  surprised that amendments
to the  Patents Act,  1970, with regard  to computer  programs, should
have  been  introduced  so   suddenty  in  India,  by  a  Presidential
Ordinance, without any public debate or prior announcement at all.  We
hope  this memorandum  would  restore  the status  quo  as quickly  as
possible, for all the following reasons:

  1.  Amendment  is   ambigious  and   capable  of   easy   abuse  and
     misinterpretation:

Though under the amended clause (k), computer programs per se continue
to be not patentable, the  exceptions made thereto are not clear.  All
computer programs work in  combination with hardware, and all computer
programs have  technical application to industry,  particularly to the
software  industry.  A  literal interpretation  of the  amendment with
regard to  computer programs  is dangerously misleading,  creating the
impression as though any computer program is patentable.  However, the
Ministry  of  Commerce  and  Industry  has made  a  statement  to  the
following effect at http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=6074

   "In  IT, the  trend is  to have  software in  combination  with or
   embedded  in hardware such  as in  computers or  cell phones  or a
   variety  of  other  gadgets.   Software  as  such  has  no  patent
   protection (the protection available  is by way of copyright); but
   the changing  technological environment  has made it  necessary to
   provide for  patents when  software has technical  applications in
   industry in combination  with hardware. This has been  a demand of
   NASSCOM."

There are  significant differences between  the statement made  by the
Ministry  of Commerce  and Industry  and what  the  ordinance actually
says, and  the intentions are not  apparent from the  wordings used in
the  amendment.  However,  even assuming  that the  provisions  of the
Patents Act  have been amended to  enable and make  provision for only
embedded software, which is a very  vague term, it would make in roads
into  the freedoms and  liberties required  by software  developers to
peacefully  continue  with  their  work  and  services.   Any  special
provisions  providing  for  patentability  of  computing  or  computer
programs under  the category "embedded software" is  needless, and bad
because:

   (a) The classification of computer programs into embedded software
       and others  is very superficial.   The key advantage  in using
       computer  programs is  that  logic can  be re-written  without
       re-wiring or physically modifying hardware.  Invariably, it is
       easy to re-write, copy, improve, and modify computer programs,
       and it is  quite possible to extend the  life and productivity
       of  hardware  devices   that  are  manufactured  using  scarce
       non-renewable  resources,  merely  by modifying  the  computer
       program.  People can, and  often do,  install new  software on
       embedded  computers  particularly  when  the  source  code  is
       available or to improve usability of hardware. 
   (b) The  classification is arbitrary and opposed  to principles of
       equality, and the very objects of the Patents Act. Let us take
       an illustration,  for example a computer  program named `foo'.
       It  is clear  that foo  is not  patentable per  se,  under the
       amended  clause   (k).   But  then,  foo,   in  its  technical
       application   to    industry   is   made    patentable.    The
       classification, based  on mere usage, making  foo an invention
       only  in  "its  technical  application to  industry",  has  no
       rational nexus to  the object of the Patents  Act, and plainly
       violative of  Art.  14 of  the Constitution of India.   One of
       the  avowed objects  of the  Patents  Act is  "to ensure  more
       effectively that patent rights are not worked to the detriment
       of the consumer or to the prejudice of trade or the industrial
       development of the country".  Introducing patents for any kind
       of computer programs is detrimental and opposed to the objects
       of the Act.  The question how software patents are detrimental
       and   harmful  is  elaborately   analysed  and   discussed  at
       http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/industry-at-risk.html

2. Amendment is opposed to Article 39(c) of the Constitution of India:

The Directive Principles enshrined in the Constitution of India, under
Chapter IV.  Article 39 reads as follows:

   "39.  Certain principles  of policy to be followed  by the State.-
   The  State  shall,  in   particular,  direct  its  policy  towards
   securing-

   (a) that the citizen, men and women equally, have the right to
       an adequate means of livelihood;

   (b) that  the ownership and control of  the material resources
       of the  community are so  distributed as best  to subserve
       the common good;

   (c) that the operation of  the economic system does not result
       in the concentration of  wealth and means of production to
       the common detriment;"

The  software  industry  largely  earns revenue  by  providing  custom
services,  and  by  introducing  patents for  embedded  software,  the
software  service  providers would  be  hampered  by needless  claims,
litigation  and other  un-productive  disputes that  cannot be  easily
resolved.   Patents for  embedded  software would  lead to  increasing
concentration of  wealth and means of production  to common detriment.
It is  well known that Bill Gates  of Microsoft is the  richest man in
the world, and the patent regmime  would only go to promote the riches
of the  richest.  We  have no hesitation  in saying that  the needless
hair  splitting of computer  programs into  embedded/non-embedded will
only entangle the Indian  Software Industry in litigation, obstructing
progress to common detriment.

Other harmful consequences of the amendment:

The  amendment would  disturb  the peace  prevailing  in the  software
field, and  may raise contentitious disputes  between various hardware
manufacturers, software developers and  entities, resulting in loss of
peace  in the  first place,  coupled with  loss of  revenue  and other
damages.  It  would undermine the  peace of mind required  by software
developers to  write robust code,  robbing and sapping energy  away to
indulge in  meaningless patent searches and  other needless exercises,
that are totally not suitable for the software industry. The amendment
would only increase the cost of developing software, and take away all
the advantages that India has  enjoyed so far in the embedded software
field.

Conclusion:

Rabindranath Tagore, in his Gitanjali, wrote:

   "`Prisoner, tell me,  who  was it  that  wrought this  unbreakable
   chain?'

   `It  was  I,' said  the  prisoner,  `who  forged this  chain  very
   carefully.   I thought  my invisible  power would  hold  the world
   captive leaving me in a freedom undisturbed.  Thus night and day I
   worked at the chain with  huge fires and cruel hard strokes.  When
   at  last  the  work was  done  and  the  links were  complete  and
   unbreakable, I found that it held me in its grip."

It is trite to observe  that the amendments imposed will without doubt
chain and cripple the software industry in India, pushing the industry
into  the dark dungeons  of doubt,  confusion and  chaos.  It  is very
strange that NASSCOM should have invited the amendment, without taking
into consideration  the serious harm  and danger patents  for embedded
software  pose.    We  strongly  urge  the  Government   of  India  to
immediately  change its sudden  reversal in  policy, and  withdraw the
above Ordinance,  as soon as  possible, reverting to the  more mature,
and time  tested policies  and patent law  in force before  January 1,
2005, removing  the hurdles on the  way for the  smooth continuance of
our growth, progress and prosperity.

Therefore,

   FSF India requests the Government of India to immediately withdraw
   THE PATENTS (AMENDMENT) ORDINANCE,  2004 (Ordinance .No 7 of 2004)
   under Article 123(2)(b), with regard to amendments made to Section
   3(k) of the Patents Act, 1970.

Mandrakelinux and Conectiva announce merger

The biggest news this week is the merger of Mandrakesoft with the #1
South American Linux vendor, Conectiva. Mandrakesoft is buying all of
Conectiva's shares in a stock swap which will create a new, truly
international Linux vendor. Conectiva's enterprise connections and
know-how in South America and particularly Brazil will give a strong
boost to Mandrakesoft's enterprise development, and its research and
development abilities will combine with Mandrakesoft's to produce a
strong source of open source innovations. Decisions have not yet been
made on the form of the product line-up that the new company will
produce, nor on the name it will take, but we'll be sure to bring the
news to you as soon as it's available. You can read the announcement
of the merger here.

Hi,

What is the use of "test -a" in shell script

I have seen a script which uses the follwing statement like

test -a "filname"

what is the use of "-a" here.

Dear members,

We have heard  that smell sensations are stimulated artificially, is
there any technology to implant a circuit in the human body which
transforms the thoughts of human into electronic pulse which is
transmitted  via internet/wifi  to a computer and performs a task, say
when a man wants to know about a topic 'horticulture' , the moment
when he thinks to submit the key word 'horticulture' to a search
engine say 'google',  the implant circuit should take this thought and
submit it to the google and perform the search operation and pool up
the results back to the implant circuit which should be given back to
the brain. Is this possible any way ?.

cheers

Hi,

I wonder if the goverment is even listening. But if need be, we should 
make a lot more noise to make our voice heard. I was shocked when I read 
about the ordinance on slashdot, but it gives great relief that FSF-India 
is working on it.

The preparation in MIT is in full swing for the forthcoming festival
named 'carte blanche'.

There are about 100 student volunteers from MIT itself. However, many
of them are not familiar with Free(dom) software. A training
programme is underway for them, every day evening. For the past two
days, I spoke about what is free software and did a basic install. We
are planning to have this upto 15th March. I urgently need members to
take classes to the students. Any topic userful to entry-level linux
users are welcome.

venue : New Lecture Hall Complex,MIT,Chromepet
Timings: 5-6.15pm 

   Since, the programme will be upto 15th, members can choose
convenient date(s) and let me know along with topics.

There's a GNOME Intro talk at Ma Foi Academy this Saturday( by yours
truly :)
You can ask the MIT Students to attend, I'll extend the GNOME
Introduction so that 
Newbies can understand What are the different parts of the GNOME
Desktop.

Ex: Metacity, Nautilus, GTK(Basic Intro) , Firefox(Epiphany..) .

Asking them to attend session is not fair. There are about 100
students, all belonging to same college. They sit after their regular
classes are over. They are willing to provide facility. Hence, it is
fair that speaker goes to the place. Moroever Ma Foi talk is part of
regular lug activity, but this programme is special and specific to
the needs of a particular college.

Comments:

1) Software already has copyright protection, and in addition,
closed-source software also has trade-secret protection. It definitely
doesn't need patent protection in addition. 

2) This "application to industry" phrase is mumbo-jumbo. Every single
piece of software is applicable to industry - effectively, the phrase
provides a general catch-all exemption.

3) The "combination with hardware" phrase is even more mumbo-jumbo. All
software functions *only* in combination with hardware. How else are you
going to use the program, hand-simulate it with paper-and-pencil in a
computer science class? Another general catch-all exemption.
 
4) I think we definitely need clause 3(ka) - it prohibits the patenting
of a mathematical method or algorithm. Very good. 

Clause 3(k) should be modified to simply read:

  (k) a computer programme per se;

This would be acceptable to me.

Plz. when ever you start a thead then use appropriate subject to that.

To explain the usage of -a in test command,

/tmp/tst is a file
/tmp/tst.log is a file

Checking as,

# test -f /tmp/tst -a -f /tmp/tst.log
# echo $?
# 0

# test -f /tmp/nofile
# echo $?
# 1

-a is used to combine to test operationgs. -o is used for OR operation. -a is having more precedence than -o

HTH.

Thanks,
-Muthukumar.

I understand that test -a is used to combine the operator. I mean It is 
eauvalent to logivcal operator "&"

But in some of the source codes I find that

DIR="/home/user/file"

if   test  ! -a $DIR


what is the use of -a here

I want to know about that

with warm regards,

Plz. when ever you start a thead then use appropriate subject to that.

To explain the usage of -a in test command,

/tmp/tst is a file
/tmp/tst.log is a file

Checking as,

# test -f /tmp/tst -a -f /tmp/tst.log
# echo $?
# 0

# test -f /tmp/nofile
# echo $?
# 1

-a is used to combine to test operationgs. -o is used for OR operation. -a 
is having more precedence than -o

HTH.

Thanks,

Hi,

I'm trying to find the GNU wdiff (word diff) tool for Windows.  I've looked
through all GNU mirrors for a win32 binary without any luck.

If anyone has this as a part of their djgpp or cygwin install, can you please

Oh! How I wish the debian-win32 project was alive...

hi
        I think there was a mail suggesting "help test". Did u try that? 
>From the output its clear.

        See this

test: test [expr]
    Exits with a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on
    the evaluation of EXPR.  Expressions may be unary or binary.  Unary
    expressions are often used to examine the status of a file.  There
    are string operators as well, and numeric comparison operators.
 
    File operators:
 
        -a FILE        True if file exists.
        -b FILE        True if file is block special.
        -c FILE        True if file is character special.
        -d FILE        True if file is a directory.
        -e FILE        True if file exists.
        -f FILE        True if file exists and is a regular file.
        -g FILE        True if file is set-group-id.
        -h FILE        True if file is a symbolic link.
        -L FILE        True if file is a symbolic link.
        -k FILE        True if file has its `sticky' bit set.
        -p FILE        True if file is a named pipe.
        -r FILE        True if file is readable by you.
        -s FILE        True if file exists and is not empty.
        -S FILE        True if file is a socket.
        -t FD          True if FD is opened on a terminal.
        -u FILE        True if the file is set-user-id.

We can use test command in two ways as,

1. For using to combine two expression as,

/tmp/test, /tmp/ok files

test -f /tmp/test -a -f /tmp/ok
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]
then
   echo "Two files are available"
fi

2. For using to check the files availablity as,

[[ -a /tmp/ok ]] && echo "File is available"

-a is getting differed based on the test operation.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0503041734430.23226-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

"No Software Patents!" -- Allowing patents over software ideas will
seriously affect the creativity, productivity and freedom of all.
Link: http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/

One Day One Command :-
====================

fold -- Wrap each input line to fit in specified width.

Summary :

`fold' wrap input lines in each input file and writes the output to
standard output. `fold' counts screen columns by default.

Examples :

$ fold myfile -- Fold each input line at column 80 and print in the
                 screen/stdout.

$ fold -w 40 myfile > myfile1 -- Fold each input line at column 40 and
                                 the output is redirected to myfile1.

$ fold -s -w40 f1 f2 -- Fold each input line of f1 and f2 at column 40
                        and folding will happen at space only.

$ fold -b 40 myfile -- Folds at 40th byte place.

$ fold -c 40 myfile -- Folds at 40th character position.


Note:
1) Normally all the above options will give same output. Difference
can be felt only with multi-byte encodings, like UTF-8...

2) A tab may count more than one column, backspace decreases the
column count, and carriage return sets the column to zero.

Read : man fold

Shiv, thanks for your comments.  Before the amendment, Section 3(k) of

as follows:

"3(k) a mathematical or business method or a computer program per se or

It should be left alone in peace.

Correct.  TRIPS in fact obliges the member states, India, US and all the 
others there, to the do the following, which are very clear and 
self-explanatory:
<quote>
Article 9
Relation to the Berne Convention
1. Members shall comply with Articles 1 through 21 of the Berne 
Convention (1971) and the Appendix thereto. However, Members shall not 
have rights or obligations under this Agreement in respect of the rights 
conferred under Article 6b is of that Convention or of the rights 
derived therefrom.
2. Copyright protection shall extend to expressions and not to ideas, 
procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such.
 
Article 10 Computer Programs and Compilations of Data
1. Computer programs, whether in source or object code, shall be 
protected as literary works under the Berne Convention (1971).
2. Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable 
or other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their 
contents constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such. 
Such protection, which shall not extend to the data or material itself, 
shall be without prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or 
material itself.
</quote>

The amendment seriously goes against the grain of the above Articles.

The mischief, as though the amedment is required to cover "embedded 
software", is apparently done by misinterpreting Article 27 of TRIPS, 
dealing with "Patentable Subject Matter" which begins as follows: "1. 
... patents shall be available for any inventions, whether products or 
processes, in all fields of technology, provided that they are new, 
involve an inventive step and are capable of industrial application..." 
 It is meaningless to justify patents for "embedded software" on the 
basis of Article 27, and this should explain the source for the 
mumbo-jumbo below :

>
>2) This "application to industry" phrase is mumbo-jumbo. Every single
>piece of software is applicable to industry - effectively, the phrase
>provides a general catch-all exemption.
>
>3) The "combination with hardware" phrase is even more mumbo-jumbo. All
>software functions *only* in combination with hardware. How else are you
>going to use the program, hand-simulate it with paper-and-pencil in a

>
It would be clear that TRIPS plainly prescribes copyrights for computer 
programs, and the above mumbo-jumbo is merely a fanciful invention ;)

Message-ID: <20050304152314.96972.qmail@web54001.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I am not able to get my grub bootloader back after my
windows reinstall in my dual boot (XP and FC3). I had
formatted the windows partition before installing the
new XP. I tried mounting linux through a rescue disk.
It showed an error message that the linux could not be
run properly but that some of the files have been
mounted in /mnt/sysimage and gave me a shell prompt. I
tried chroot /mnt/sysimage and grub-install /dev/hda.
But it showed that such device do not exist and did
not do much. I did a fdisk -l and it gave me the
following. Looking at that I was wondering if my
partition table is fine or not. Any help to solve this
problem woul tbe highly appreciated.

Output of fdisk -l:


/dev/hda1   *   1  1912  15358108+  7 HPFS/NTFS
/dev/hda2       1913 2432   4176900  e  w95  LBA
/dev/hda3      2433  2445  104422+  83  linux
/dev/hda4      2446  4864  19430617+ f W95 (Extd) LBA
/dev/hda5      2446  3210  6144831   83  Linux
/dev/hda6      3211  3341  1052226   82  Linux
/dev/hda7      3342  4864  12233466  83 Linux

I tried googling a lot but could not find any simple
method to get my boot loader back, may be because I do
not have much idea of these partition table and stuff
like that.

With best regards,
Dileep

Message-ID: <1109950959.3998.4.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Maybe this is a really dumb question but is there an easy way to define
keybindings in Metacity (I'm on Fedora Core 3).
Currently, I'm running gconf-editor, going to the metacity section and
explicitly entering key-bindings and their corresponding command. 
The keyboard shortcuts item under Preferences only allows me to work
with predetermined commands. I want to be able to define my own.
There's got to be a simpler way, right?

Thanks,

U try this out.
boot in the rescue mount.
Create a temporary directory(eg test)
Now mount your root partition like
mount /dev/hdx test
chroot test
grub-install /dev/hda. or use the grub prompt to install.

On inspection of the code, wdiff invokes vanilla diff through heavy Unix
wizardry.  That probably explains why it is not trivial to port it over to
Win32.

But the best part is that wdiff's working is rather trivial.  It's pretty
easy to code it in a few lines of perl.  CPAN carries pure perl
implementations of vanilla diff, which makes life simple :-)

Thanks a lot for you help anyway!

thrice. If you harbour doubts about mails reaching the list:

[1] Visit your mail preferences page and set "Receive acknowlegement 
mail when you send mail to the list?" option to yes.**  You will then 
receive acknowledgements and you will know for sure that your post has 
reached the list.

[2] If you still have doubts, visit the archives and check if your post 
is listed.

It looks like you have a new gmail account, and fyi, gmail does not seem 
to bother you by sending your own posts to lists back to you.  I think, 
it is not possible to make changes to the filter for now at gmail.

BTW, a brief note covering the visit by RMS to TN is available at:

Letter from Peruvian Congressman - by suso (Score: 4, Insightful) Thread
This letter (http://www.opensource.org/docs/peru_and_ms.php ) by Dr.
Edgar David Villenueva Nunez that the linked article links to is
absolutely fantastic. I've never read such a good argument for open
source outside of its founders. Nor have I read such a great and well
thought out letter by a modern day politician. It makes me want to
move to Peru.
 
I think that you all should take a moment to read through that so that
you can remind yourself that open source is the "more correct" form of
software development.

Hi all,

It is a sunplus based chipset and its driver is spca5xx. The video is
good and everything is fine. But, as soon as i login to linux, the
webcam lights starts glowing, indicating that power is comming. I want
the webcam to be powerd on only when i use it. Is there any way to do
that. I even unloaded the kernel module (spca5xx driver). But still,
power flows. Is there anyway to switch it off.

If we are managing users and groups based file then,

/etc/passwd and /etc/group is containing informations.

Which type of storage informations for user and group is decide from /etc/nsswitch.conf file.

For users entries as,

passwd: files
shadow: files
group: files

so that your system will be using only files (passwd, group) for user and group management.

We can use LDAP, NIS, .. there.

See more in nsswitch.conf, group and passwd man pages.

Dear All,
I downloaded mpg123 src from:
http://www.mpg123.de/mpg123/mpg123-0.59r.tar.gz

Then, I downloaded this patch:
http://lassauge.free.fr/cygwin/mpg123-0.59r-patch
so as to build in cygwin.
I applied the patch to the src tree.
But when I did the build:
 "make cygwin"
     or 
 "make cygwin-esd"
I get the following error:

I googled for solutions but found that a similar

Can anyone please help me?

demo day, seminar announcements can be made in the website.  ... and
it is easy to set polls, etc. ...

One Day One Command :-
====================

fmt -- Simple optimal text ForMatTer

Summary :

`fmt' reads from the specified file arguments or stdin, and writes 
to stdout. 

Examples :

$ fmt myfile -- Format myfile and max line length is 75.

$ fmt f1 f2  -- Format f1 f2  and max line length is 75.

$ fmt -w 60 f1 f2 -- Same as above but max line length is 60.

$ fmt -s myfile -- Don't split the small line. Useful if your file 
                   contains some sample program codes.

$ fmt -u myfile -- Uniform spacing. One space between words. Two space 
                   between sentences.

$ fmt -p BB myfile -- Only lines beginning with BB will be formatted.

$ fmt -t myfile -- Paragraph indentation will be preserved.

Note: By default, blank lines, spaces between words, and indentation
are preserved in the output; successive input lines with different
indentation are not joined; tabs are expanded on input and introduced
on output.

Read : man fmt

For now, it should be atleast `GNU/Linux` instead of `Linux`. I
think, FSF-TN should be working with the governmental departments
with this.

Na., just make the text books talk about `GNU/Linux` instead of
`Linux`. That makes enough difference.

determine the chip you have. Something like nsc-ircc, sms etc. nsc is
for the national semiconductor. You can look at the manual that came
with the laptop to know what controller you have. Otherwise you can
download `findchip` which will check for the presence of the popular
chip controllers.

If you have serial.ko (8250)compiled in to the kernel, disable the
serial line for the port on which your irda controller is
attached. (setserial /dev/ttyS[0|1] uart none)

Otherwise, if you have it all as modules, rmmod the 8250_* stuff and
also serial_core. Then modprobe the serial driver (nsc-ircc, or smsrc,
etc). Then modprobe irda, modprobe ircomm, modprobe
icomm-tty. irattach irda0 -s will make the irda available for
communication between the mobile and the comp.

You can use `irdadump` to see if it all worked.

Good to hear Linux is in the syllabus! A year or so back, there was a
sub title in one of the texts discussing "The Advantages of Windows
OS"!!!! Curiously there were no sections for the dis-advantages! The $
in M$ should've been in active play.

Gmail doesn't show you emails that you sent in your Inbox unless there
is a follow-up in the conversation. You might want to look in the

There are quite a lot of people who think it should not be that way.

And let us not have any old arguments that Linux is nothing without

New versions of symantec ghost can take image of your linux box. But I think
there is no server from Symantec side.

Message-ID: <495e451205030703014f30ddfb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
    I recently(about 4 days ago) bought BSNL's Broadband connection. I
didn't install the rpm's given in the cd of theirs b'cos i had much
newer rpm (there's rpm was rp-pppoe-3.5-1.i386.rpm & mine was
rp-pppoe-3.5-22.i386.rpm). So i ran /usr/sbin/adsl-setup which asked
some basic questions & i answered them. It worked fine. Then i
mistakenly re-ran the scripts which produced some .bak files & then i
deleted those files. Now i am unable to connect to the internet
through my desktop pc. But it works fine under windows xp of my
notebook PC. I am using FC3 with Realtek RTL8139D based 100/10 PCI
based ethernet card. During boot up i find message "bringing up
interface eth0 [failed]" and message that follow it is "bringing up
ppp0  [failed]". The text in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ppp0
seems to be ok.

with regards,

Hi all,

        First and foremost, I am delighted to see so much activity in
our college after Shakthi Kannan's events here so I thank him and
ILUGC as a whole for visiting colleges/unis and doing these kind of
events.

Copyright Law gives the author(s) the right to due credit and honour in 
respect of their works, and no other special law is necessary to get it 
enforced.  AFAIK, FSF and RMS merely *request* that the GNU/Linux 
Operating System be called by that name. (see: 
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/linux-gnu-freedom.html )

But in schools, the issue could become a yes/no question like: "Is it 
correct to call the Gnu/Linux Operating System as Linux ?" and getting 
it wrong means losing marks ;)

Substantially, the inclusion of free software in the curriculum will 
result in significant gains for the teachers and students.

Our Supreme Court recently said: "An educational institution runs 
smoothly when the teacher and the taught are engaged in the common ideal 
of pursuit of knowledge."

It is needless to point out that Free Software helps to the utmost 
extent possible in the pursuit of knowledge.  Free Software philosophy 
have also brought in a sea of change, the way curriculums are designed 
and taught, the world over, and we are no exception.  The change to free 
software based on open standards is not by accident, but due to the 
efforts of RMS and several thousands of volunteers world wide, who 
deeply desired this change and made contributions for the better.

Thank you for your hospitatilty, faculty/management
support, wonderful infrastructure and your valuable
time.

We will continue to work every semester, every year.
Period.

I must give credit to our work model that we have
followed in continuing our GNU/Linux
workshops/seminars. I have observed this in two
colleges, so far:

[1] Kongu Engineering College, Erode.

Arvind Kalyan (final year, CSD), made the initiative
along with the support of the faculty/management in
bringing about the usage and awareness of GNU/Linux.
Now that you are in your final semester, the juniors
are ready to take over. Our next planned event:

1/ April/May - two day workshop for faculty/staff
2/ Next semester - ECE/EEE/Mechatronics on "GNU/Linux
Software for Electrical Engineers".

I am also seeing the above model at:

[2] Anna University, College of Engineering, Guindy,
Chennai.

Sridhar R (final year CSD) was very active and his
contribution is valuable. Now Prashanth Mohan is
taking over the responsibility. Good work guyz. 

As ilugc coordinators, we will continue to interact
with student coordinators or faculty/staff
coordinators in continuing the workshops every
semester, every year.

Looking forward to this weekend's workshop, Saturday,
March 12, 2005, in association with IEEE Chapter,
Crescent Engineering College, Chennai for CSD, EEE,
Mechatronics departments.

ILUGC presenters:
Bharathi S
Toufeeq Hussain
myself

Thanking you all once again,

Hope you know about Wipro Premj's Efforts to literate the rural india.
at present they are going to do it in Tamil Nadu with the help of SSA.
Their Objective is "How to use computer ", they have an opertunity to 
introduce Free and Open Software along with GNU /Linux.
but , i think , they use [ promote ] MS based application. [ i am yet to 
get a clear picture ]

Actually, Norton/Symantec ghost supports ext3...There is no Server
concept...Ghost can create a bootable floppy that can access a network
share with your image in it...

Hai All,

I have problem during HTTP benchmarking with polygraph tool on EM64T machine.

Benchmarking results are getting problem bcas of connection timed out system errors. Machine log information is as,

/var/log/messages.3:Feb 18 16:17:44 proxy64 network: Bringing up interface eth0:  succeeded
/var/log/messages.3:Feb 18 16:17:46 proxy64 kernel: eth0: Broadcom BCM5751 1000Base-T PCI Express found at mem dfdf0000, IRQ 16,

what may the source to make issues as "Connection timed out?"

Thanks,

  Actually, if anybody has seen or got their hands on one of these,
please post to the list. If you can boot it with Knoppix, even better.

(The main draw of these notebook, apart from its low price of Rs.29k,
is that it uses a Socket-754 mobile Sempron. In principle, it can be
replaced by a Socket-754 mobile Athlon 64 (Turion), which is due out 
shortly.)

Linuxense is conducting a server break-in challenge starting from 9 
March 2005 2 AM IST. In this event, Linuxense will make a GNU/Linux 
server available on the Internet which the contestants try to break in.

This challenge will give you a unique opportunity to test your security 
skills on a professionally set up server without violating any legal 
barriers. This event will also help you to understand the requirements 
of a secured server to be deployed on the Internet.

At the end of the event Linuxense will share the network packet dump of 
the event which will help you to learn various techniques used by other
contestants and do forensic analysis.

Details about the event can be found http://www.linuxense.com/challenge

Please feel free to pass this on to other interested institutions/

Hello,
For the same reason I shifted from sify to bsnl broadband. Sify
Narrowband(32-64 kbps if u call broadband) is most unreliable & the
wiring they have done is haphazard runs over 440-230volts line in most
places & over trees.. So far i have changed three ethernet cards due
to sify.

Bsnl Broadnabd though has minor problem some times, is giving
consistently between 256kbps to 300kbps. For a change a govenment
complany is doing well.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0503081927240.15481-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

"No Software Patents!" -- Allowing patents over software ideas will 
seriously affect the  Creativity,  Productivity and  Freedom of all.
Link: http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/

One Day One Command :-
====================

top -- Display TOP Intensive processes

Summary :

TOP provides an ongoing look at processor activity in real time. TOP
list the process, which is sorted based on the CPU usage of the each
task on the system. It can also sort the tasks by memory usage & run
time.

Examples :

$ top -- List the most CPU-Intensive processes.

$ top -q -- Runs with the highest possible priority.

$ top -d 6 -- List will be updated every 6 Sec.

$ top -n 5 -- Update the list for 5 times and then exit.

$ top -p 100 -p 200 -- Monitor only process with PID 100 & 200.
                       Maximum 20 processes can be monitored.

$ top -s -- Run in secure mode (Disables the potentially dangerous
            interactive commands).

$ top -c -- List the process with command line options instead of the
            command name only (default).

$ top -b -n 5 > myfile -- Run in Batch mode & dump the output in myfile. 
                
NOTE: 

1) Batch Mode is useful for sending output from top to other programs
or to a file. It runs until it produces the number of iterations
requested with the n option or until killed.

2) TOP supports few interactive commands to change the output formats 
like changing update time and few actions like killing a process.

Read : man top

Message-ID: <a1a2291205030807486c6736d@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,
Is there any LAN IP messenger common for both Windows and Linux PCs
with file transfer? I tried xipmsg ... The display is not proper. I
tried to compile gtkipmsg and gipmsg..Both failed. I googled but could
not get proper result.

Subject: [Ilugc] help in remote printing major mess up.
Message-ID: <205697105030808556b178693@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ilugc ppl,

I hope I can get some help in solving this problem which may seem a
little vague.

I'm using FC3, in one of my comps and configured the printer services
to use a SMB remote queue printing on my windows xp machine with HP
psc 1315 printer-scanner-all in one. It did detect the printer share
and server and seemed to configure fine. However when I tried to print
some document from linux, it sort of started, and the printer list in
windows showed 1 document queued. But all of a sudden the linux
machine just restarted.

Now whenever I try to boot into linux it ok's the cups, nfs,xfs and
when it comes to system message bus, it just restarts. I know the
problem is vauge but I do hope I can get some help without having to
re-install linux.

Thanks
Shiva.

Your ARP cache is overflowing. Put:

net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh1 = 8192
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh2 = 16384
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3 = 32768

in your /etc/sysctl.conf and run sysctl -p. Adjust the numbers above
as per your needs.

Are there any unlimited schemes in BSNL like we have in Sify? That is

Hello,
For the same reason I shifted from sify to bsnl broadband. Sify
Narrowband(32-64 kbps if u call broadband) is most unreliable & the
wiring they have done is haphazard runs over 440-230volts line in most
places & over trees.. So far i have changed three ethernet cards due to
sify.

Bsnl Broadnabd though has minor problem some times, is giving
consistently between 256kbps to 300kbps. For a change a govenment
complany is doing well.

Airtel has a Unlimited Broadbans Scheme.
You might have to check up with their call center(yuck!) for
availability in your area.

Rs.900 per month for 128 kbps connection.

As always ... put me under Tech Support :)
I shall also hang around with the other stalls if
students need help.

My suggestions:

- It will take hardly 5 minutes to introduce the
following topics to MIT students if they haven't used
it yet

- For demo purposes we can download webpages and keep
them offline to be used during the demo

- students have 1 week to learn to use the relevant
topics mentioned below, also consulting with experts,
if need be. Honestly speaking, one can learn these in
few minutes. GNU/Linux is so much fun to learn :)

- It would be better for ilugc members to cater to 3-4
teams when students need help

Please note that the following does not cover all the
topics for the stalls, but, only a sample:

The suggestions include 24 stalls (in random order)
with 3 students each, bringing a total of 72 student
volunteers.

1/ Openoffice (3 members)

8/ Audio editing software (3 members)

10/ File sharing (3 members)

I checked this model out when I visted Hyderabad recently... there was 
an Acer shop in Imax. It's 3 kg, and looks and feels quite bulky. Apart 
from that I felt that windoze (that's all they had in the showroom) 
responded pretty good unlike windows celeron laptops I've seen, which 
are terribly slow. And keyboard feel is not bad either (though I had to 
grope for the spacebar at first).

But it eats up way too much desktop space, me feels. And, if you're 
thinking of serious traveling with this beast, forget it. But yeah, for 
30 grand, it seems like a good deal, but don't take my word for it. Go 
check it out for yourself.

Vamsee.

You haven't provided much details. That config should handle about a
1000 mailboxes without any problems.

1. Are all your users polling the mailserver over LAN?
2. When the server becomes slow, does top show any intensive programs running?
3. Do your users habitually leave emails on the server?
4. Are your mailboxes mbox format or Maildirs?
5. Do you have any antivirus/spam filter installed?

I didn't understand your question, but if you mean sqlplus should not
prompt for username/password to connect to your database, then it is
possible. You should run sqlplus as:

sqlplus username/password@sid

I'm not sure if you can include username/password information in your
tnsnames.ora file.

If you want an application to talk to the database, then you should
really be using odbc/jdbc instead.

Hi,
These are my suggestions, others might tend to disagree :)

1. Make your kernel CPU Specific.
2. Avoid Modules , Compile all of your hardware drivers into the kernel,
though this increases the kernel size,
	 it reduces module loading/unloading overload. However some
modules might exist like Laptop Specific modules,cpu 	temperature ,I
see a few modules for Sony Vaio or Toshiba models which are better off
as modules. 
3. Use a patchset, using vanilla kernel from kernel.org will not give
you a optimised Desktop Kernel.
	Some patchsets like -nitro (Gentoo) and -cko exist which are
pure desktop patches.
	The above mentioned patchsets are in turn based on -ck patchset
by Con Kolivas.
4. Optimise your init scripts, that is where the main startup lag is.
5. Remove Unnecessary Services from xinetd etc.
6. Keep it *minimal*. Use a light GUI.
7. If you are paranoid about optimisations use Gentoo :)

Hope that Helps.

Optimization can refer to many things. It is
architecture dependent. It is system dependent. 

Basically, you will need to disable the modules that
you don't need, and thereby not compile it. There can
be kernel boot up time optimization. You can optimize
kernel code.

Either that or infinite patience!

I did my first (and current) install on 128 megs, but upgraded to 256 later...

When booting up, if you know that everything is in the kernel, there's no need 
to load the modules and waste time. Also, you can compile JUST what you need 
- for your own hardware - and cut down on unnecessary files 
in /lib/modules/*...

Also, hardware detection is unnecessary in this way - no need to go have a tea 
while kudzu works... :)

Use a different scheduler - there's some nice ones in the -mm derivatives 
(-ck, -love, -nitro, etc).

Use pre-emptible kernel from wherever it's located.

But don't try changing the gcc flags - it could destabilize the kernel, which 
is a Bad Thing! It compiles at -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer, anyway, so there's 
reasonable optimizations there...

One Day One Command :-
====================

kill -- Sends a signal to processes.

Summary :

The command kill sends the specified signal to the specified process
or process group.  If no signal is specified, the TERM signal is sent.
Signals are used for inter process communications.

Examples :

$ kill -l -- Print a list of signal names with numbers.

$ kill -l SIGIO -- Print the number for SIGIO signal.

$ kill -l 9 -- Print the Name for the Signal number 9.

$ kill 100 200 -- Send TERM signal to processes with PID 100 and 200.

$ kill -s 9 100 -- Send KILL signal to process with PID 100.

$ kill -n SIGKILL 100 -- Same as above

$ kill -SIGKILL 100 -- Same as above.

$ kill -9 100 -- Same as above.

$ kill -9 -1 -- Kill all your login sessions. But Not the current one.

NOTE:
1) Two kill commands are available. One is built-in SHELL (default)  
   and 2nd is in /usr/bin/kill.

2) We can use either Signal Name or Number.

Read : man kill, signal(7)

You can use aliases and add them to your .bash_profile or .profile

Add this to .bash_profile

alias sqlplus="sqlplus username/password@SID"

Logout--> login or execute you .bash_profile

The only issue is that every time you type sqlplus you will connect to
this SID

Subject: [Ilugc] Cool-running Xine/Ogle/Mplayer HTPC HW-platform
Message-ID: <20050310071522.93506334A2@whitebox.dias.ath.cx>

I'll have to eat humble crow today - I'd earlier claimed that the
Williamette/Northwood/Prescott P4/Celerons were unsuitable for 24/7 
server operation or any other application where thermal stability was
a limiting factor. This included HTPCs (Home-Theatre PCs) running Xine/
Ogle/MythTV/MPlayer etc., either as standalone devices connecting to a
TV/projector or as a component in a Hi-Fi video/audio stack. I had
recommended Coppermine/Tualatin CPUs instead to keep the thermals under
control.

Well, today I found a Northwood Celeron that runs as cool or cooler
than a Coppermine or Tualatin; works in any standard desktop 400FSB P4
motherboard, including the i845/i865/SiS6xx/Via motherboards, and is
significantly quicker than almost any Coppermine or Tualatin when running
media-rich applications, include MPEG/MPEG2 AV decode. This CPU is a
Northwood D1-stepping Celeron. These are sometimes erroneously called
"mobile" Celerons, since they consume very little power and are often
found in notebooks, e.g. Dell Inspirons. 

The key interesting feature of the Northwood D1-stepping Celeron is its
ability to run at Vcore as low as 1.25v, as opposed to its standard 1.525v
Vcore. It can assert VID (Voltage ID) encodings corresponding to either
voltage, depending on its internal ACPI/APM state; however, it continues
to run at the full core clock speed even in the lower power state. 

The power consumption in each state is not specified; the maximum power
dissipation in the high-power state is specified as ~60W. A quick finger
test on the heatsink (without the fan running) shows that it  runs very
cool on average (probably ~10W, which is almost good enough for fanless
applications)!

If you're looking for a cool-running CPU for fanless or HTPC applications
that's also very fast on floating point and runs GNU/Linux flawlessly, I'd
recommend looking for a D1-stepping Northwood - it gives >4k BogoMIPs at about
10W (average), paired with an i845 or i865 for maximum stability. This can
be installed in a Zebronics Pluto (black) ATX case for decent aesthetics.

Avoid the earlier B1- and C1-stepping Northwoods if you can - their thermals
are not as good. The D1s have S-Specs of SL6VR, SL6VS, SL6VT, SL6VU, SL6VV,
SL6W4, SL6ZY, SL72B, SL77S, SL77T, SL77U & SL77V. Not all of them may run
as cool as the one I tested (SL6VV 2.60 GHz/400 FSB/128k L2 cache) - the
average power consumption may vary depending on its process, batch, clock-
multiplier, etc. YMMV - I'd recommend looking for the 2.60 GHz SL6VV or
the 2.80 GHz SL77V, but I could not locate them in the local market - 2.4
is the highest that's available locally (Note: the Celeron D is a
Prescott, which runs significantly hotter than the D1-stepping Northwood,
but probably gives higher performance as well, due to its larger L2 cache).

a) If constrained by cost, choose the Northwood D1 - it will work on just
about any P4 board, so the cost of CPU + motherboard < Rs.6k.

b) If not constrained by cost, go for the mobile Sempron 2800+ with a
Socket-754 board - this will give a potentially higher-performance system
at a higher cost, very good thermals, and possible future upgradability
to Athlon-64 Turions and dual-cores.

c) The Socket-A 333FSB Sempron has poorer performance, runs hotter and
has limited upgradability in the future - Socket-A is reaching its end-
of-life. I wouldn't recommend it except on the basis of cost (~Rs.4k).

d) Tualatin Celerons are still an excellent choice, paired with an i810E or
i815E for about Rs.3k each (Boards seem to be short supply, not the CPUs).

Fairly simple - one these Northwood D1s came into my possession for
testing, experimentation, etc. A simple touch test revealed that it
ran very cool. A quick check on its S-Spec (SL6VV) followed by a few
hours on Google revealed that it had pretty good features, including
thermals and overclock potential (~3.2 GHz on a stock setup). So I
decided to upgrade my existing Xine box (which was earlier running
a Coppermine PIII that died due to thermal issues). The upgrade was
a fairly trivial motherboard+CPU swap; an i686 kernel as well as stock
RedHat 7.3 booted, and kudzu detected and configured everything flawlessly.
Hence the recommendation.

dig @ns1.kernel.org kernel.org axfr
host -l kernel.org ns1.kernel.org

It will not work if the DNS server (ns1.kernel.org) has zone transfers
disabled - which would be the case for any decently-administered DNS
server. AXFRs need 53/tcp connections, hence this can be blocked at
the firewall too.

HI all,
    Today India in IT giant but I could rarely find any OpenSource
software which is authored by Indian ? Why ?
Is this because we dont have time to write such software ?. All are
busy working for MNC's ?
Or we dont have resources to experiment and test ?. The most precious
resource being time.
Or nobody is interested in contributing to OpenSource world other than
reaping its benefits ?

    I would like to know India's contribution to developing new software.
    How many of you scratched your own itch ?

You are making a _wrong_ assumption that MNC's don't
do/use free software/open source.

In the field of embedded systems that I work on, there
are so many companies in India that write/use free
software.

application. u can see sify.com runs on LAMP technology.

i forgot to tell one thing.

Most Indian languages are implemented in distros are contributed by
indian developers i think. i read in a magzine that punjab language
for gnome is done by 4 people...

   Agree..

   But does using LAMP technology means, SIFY has contributed something to
   opensource (free software).

You are making an assumption that they have not
participated in forums/mailing lists regarding the
usage/troubleshooting of LAMP. They could have.

Usually, beginners who are interested in development
are asked to test free software and report bugs (if
any). This is also contribution to free software. They
are actually helping to improve the software.

Learning and teaching people to use free software is
also contribution to free software.

Are you sure that he's sending it?
In all likelihood, its probably spam generated from Hi5 or whatever.
Even though its got his reply-to address, if you examine the full
headers, you can see that the mail originated from mailer95.hi5.com
I've received several of these from other sources as well.

Bouncing mails from this sources looks like its difficult though, since
I think none of the headers actually give you specific details...

Yes exactly. The only project which comes to my mind is Anjuta. I don't 
expect anything from commercial entities. But I expect a lot of 
initiatives (apart from localisation projects) from educational 
institutions.

Hi5 is an Orkut-like service that lets a member to invite more people
by just entering the email address and "we will do the rest". In all
likelyhood the OP tried to use the ilugc address.

Well, in that case the said user could subscribe via a different email
address.  Non-subscriber posts are not allowed on ilugc and that
catches almost every bit of spam -- the only price to pay is that I
spend a little while *each day* approving (mostly discarding) a bunch
of messages.

That is waht a meant to ask. No new software I can see. People may be
using it for their work and reporting bugs and submitting patches but
nobody is in a lead position.

Hi
        May be everyone in India is  busy making money. Those people who 
are outside India may have both time and money, that helps them to spent 
some money and time for their passion, writing code. They code for passion 
not for money. Most of them are not computer professionals who spent their 
whole time in an Office executing what his boss says. They have other 
source for money and time for coding.

  Well, you are always welcome to start your own project on Sourceforge
or elsewhere - nobody is preventing you from doing so.

  For most people, the more practical and useful thing to do is to
contribute to an existing project that already solves a problem, and
to enhance and extend its scope, or make it more usable, reliable and
maintenable.

  If you had started using GNU in 1984, instead of asking inane newbie
questions in 2005, maybe you'd have been the lead maintainer of major
project by now.

Please don't top post.

Also, consider this..
Linus Torvalds leads the Linux Kernel Project.
His work is dependent on thousands of people testing/submitting patches.

Being the lead is not that big a deal.
Anyone can fork an existing project and call himself the lead.

Today, I can fork the Linux Kernel and start my own Kernel tree, but
whose going to submit patches and add new features?

Each person involved in that project plays a vital role in its
development.

So being a Project lead is not "that-biga-deal" in FLOSS.
Sure he makes the decisions but those decisions are made in full
democracy will all the project contributors.
So, just being the lead is not important, it's the lines-of-code which
matter.

Toufeeq Hussain

I posted this not to harass anyone. After all in opensource world
there is no barries of nationality and religion.
    I am thinking of this for several months. I am a Java developer
and mainly uses opensource software. I used to ask (newbie)questions
sometimes stupid questions at forums and mailing lists(one can search
in goole with my name). Many have answeered the questions and very
rarely I have seen an Indian answering the questions. That is what
made me ask this question.
    
    I have another question that I will as in another thread.

Agreably Indians' contribution is not very much when compared to
others (look at our population density).  But I do agree with shiv
too. Read these articles -
http://www.advogato.org/article/22.html
http://www106.pair.com/rhp/hacking.html

Another reason is the very poor educational system we have in India. 
Surely there are much more students scoring about 90% here. =)

Welcome. You have lots of company (and Indian). Check out the java 
open-source landscape. It's very, very rich. Check out places like 
TSS(theserverside.com) and O'Reilly's ONJava. There are a lot of new 
projects where they would readily appreciate any help, even if it comes 
from a Martian.

Are you sure? Though I admit that the number is very less, the landscape 
is about to change - very soon. You'll find a lot of Indian people 
answering questions in lists like struts-user. You should also remember 
that internet access until very recently is a costly proposition - 
something young people, with the most time to contribute, cannot afford. 
So there's less chance to learn from other projects, even lesser scope 
to contribute.

But that shouldn't stop you - check out projects like www.openwfe.org 
(where I contribute documentation). John Mettraux, the project 
maintainer, is looking for a good PHP developer. Perhaps you can help?

Good luck,
Vamsee Kanakala.

Really?  Nobody?  Did you atleast read the article I posted earlier?

 http://www.freeos.com/articles/4468/

There are quite a few non-trivial projects mentioned there with Indian
project leads.  And this is back in 2002.

Since it looks like some old timers of this list are forgotten ;-),
let me add that I still continue to be the sole developer of MayaVi:
 http://mayavi.sf.net

So your assertion is plain wrong.

Example:

Then If I open input_file the file the effect should take place in the

Is it possible to do that?

sed displays all contents of the file from its own internal buffer on

simple trick:
sed 's/<old>/<new>/g' input_file > tmp; mv tmp input_file

We can do with PERL directly as,

perl -pi -e 's<old>/<new>/g' input_file

so that pattern matching changes will be updated in the same input_file.

To accomplish with sed then,

sed 's/<old>/<new>/g' input_file > outputfile; mv outputfile input_file

HTH.

Can you tell me any project in Apache initiated/lead by an Indian ?.
You can find some Indian names in Struts.
Can you name software used in a modern GNU/Linux system that is
written by an Indian. I saw one Indian name in a commands manual page.
You have to exclude software that people write since they are directly
paid for it. I mean software developed by employees of Redhat, Novell
etc. How many Indians have written a device driver for GNU/Linux or
*BSD

In what direction do you intend to take this thread ?
I see that you are again coming back to sqaure one and starting the same rant all over again.

No wonder none of the Indian's replied to you on mailing-lists/forums..
Even after so many people trying to make you understand that being a lead developer/maintainer in a project is not important, you start all over again.

Simply put, What is your point? 
If you think India is not well represented in the FLOSS Community, just fork off some Sourceforge Project and make it better than the existing one.

If you think the existing ones are bad, start your own.
Just don't rant on and on...

Use Tusar Nayak's response to me as,

    use -i option for inline replacement.
    sed -i 's/<old>/<new>/g' input_file

It is also working perfectly as perl -pi.

PS: Tusar Nayak, please send reponse to ALL :-)

HTH.

Hi!

  The actual problem is like this. Whenever any one registers at
hi5.com, his mail addresses are taken from his account. During the
process of registering it asks the person if he wants to send an
invite to all his friends and assumes that all the mail addresses in
his account belong to his friends. However this question is not very
easily noticed and the default option is "yes".  I had a very
embarassing situation when it such an invite to the British Council
Library ( in which I was a member then ).
 

 I think we have already had such a situation before, when I
complained but I am afraid it went unnoticed.

Bye!

I've not used postfix in my network. But I hope you can use the system
user accounts with postfix for mail access as in sendmail.

When I last took a look at it, the thing that set it apart from other
Linux distros was Yast, its all-in-one configuration tool. Yast
absolutely rocked, but was not Free Software.

I believe Novell is now making Yast Open Source (or has already made it).

Kernighan & Pike has a general-purpose script that can be used to do
this for any filter; not just sed.

You are not supposed to type "<CRLF>.<CRLF>" literally. CR is carriage
return, LF is line feed. All you need to do is to have a '.' character
as the only character on a line. Like this:

hello world
.

====================

ps - Report Process Status

Summary :

ps gives a snapshot of the current processes. Lot of info, like CPU
and MEM Usage, PID, UID, Status,..., about the present status of the
process will be available in the ps output. ps can also be used as a
debugging tool.

Example:

$ ps -- Show all running in the current terminal.

$ ps -h -- Same as above. But with-out header.

$ ps -ux -- Show all processes owned by you.

$ ps -U sbharathi -- Show all processes owned by sbharathi.

$ pc -C bash -- Show all process with name bash.

$ ps -C syslogd -o pid=  -- Print PID of syslogd.

$ ps -aux -- Show all processes including daemons (without tty)  with
             username or UID.

$ ps -jx --sort=uid,-pid -- All processes will list in ascending order 
            of UID and each users process will sorted descending order.

$ ps -o start,time,etime -p 100 -- Show the current status of the
                                   process with PID 100.

$ ps -e -o pid,state,cmd -- Show all processes PID, State & Command
                            (Custom output format -o ).

$ ps -ho "Process %a with PID %p is owned by %U" -- Custom output.

$ ps -x -o pid,ruser=RealUser -o comm=Command -o stat=Status -- Output
with custom headers.

All Yahoo! Groups are rejected my ODOC mail with above reasone. 
With-out an Yahoo! account, I can't reset my account. :) So LUGs, 
which is running in YG will not get my ODOC mails.

Maybe you think I'm just being obtuse, but in all honesty, why do you

There are various ways to contribute to a software project, for eg:
http://live.gnome.org/JoinGnome

If you feel, Indians' contribution is less in leading projects, lead a
project yourself first.

Institutional style is needed for *some* projects:

In India, free software projects could thrive with Institutional 
support.  Many projects like Postgres started life in institutions.

Vice chancellor, Visveswaraiah Technologies University, Belagum, Karnataka.

Dear Sir,

There are thousands of engineering and polytechnic colleges in India. Each year 
lakhs of graduates and diploma holders earn their degree. They pay thousands of 
rupees as fees to get the best facilities. A part of this goes to buying the 
software's which they use either in college lab or for doing assignments at 
home.For every software which they use; there is alternate Free Software 
program available. Now this shows the amount of money which we can be saved if 
we start using Free Software. This will bring down cost education considerably.

Other than cost benefits, Free Software has other advantages

     * No-fee licensing
     * Ease of license fee management
     * Better large-scale programmability
     * Easier integration
     * Better performance
     * Development convenience
* Better support

There are hundreds of Free Software's programs which colleges or universities 
can adopt. As Vishweshwaraiah Technological University is one of the biggest 
universities in India, its time for VTU to moving towards using Free Software. 
This will make other Universities to follow. Let the VTU have pride to be the 
first. Here I am giving you an example of three such alternative Free 
Software's which can be used.

* (1) Operating System: Windows v/s GNU/Linux

I don't know what university generally recommends to colleges. But presently 
almost all the colleges use Microsoft Windows based operating system. We all 
know the best available operating system today is GNU/Linux. It is the best OS 
any educational institution can have. Students can not only use it but also can 
study.

* (2) Simulation: Matlab v/s Octave

Matlab is used in communication and electronics lab. Matlab for individual 
license for university (academic use) costs $500. Any college will have to buy 
minimum 25 licenses. Which means shelling out Rs.537500. Octave, which is 
simulation software written by University professors. This usually comes with 
the GNU/Linux Operating System. The advantage to students is that they don't 
have to buy a limited student version to use at home. They can use Octave both 
at Lab and at home. SciLab? is another open source competitor for Matlab. It 
uses sophisticated algorithms to analyze data and produce lovely graphics. Now 
you have the choice which one you want to include in your curriculum.

* (3) Office software's: MS Office v/s Open Office

Well, we all used Microsoft word to submit our project documents for review and 
for other academic purposes. Now we have Open Office which is as good as MS 
office and has some feature Microsoft Office lacks like PDF support, 
compatibility with older versions of Microsoft Office, HTML editor, a vector 
drawing application .... It gives you everything starting from word processor, 
presentation software to PDF generator [Fully compatible with Microsoft Office -- 
So already existing data in those formats can be used]. Don't you think it's 
the right time to save money of a poor student ?

The above are just examples. There are many such software programs from which 
the students can benefit. We hope the university understands the urgency and 
the need. We would be happy to give you any information/help if university 
needs. Here by we urge the university to make an effort in this direction.

Thank you,

3. Praveen Arimbrathodiyil (National Instititute of Technology, Calicut) Fri 
Mar 11 17:34:50 IST 2005 We use GNU/Linux in our main Computer center. It saves 
a lot of money of the college as there is no licence fee to be paid for each 
users. Since the source code of the softwares are available many computer 
science students do projects based on Linux kernel and other such projects. The 
possibility of use of thin-clients (which our computer center use) reduces the 
cost of hardware dramatically. It has proved to be beneficail to our college 
and I urge you to chose Free Software for giving a better alternative for 
students.

Here, you are using the word "institution" as a noun,
as in a place:

"institution. noun. 1: an establishment consisting of
a building or complex of buildings where an
organization for the promotion of some cause is
situated"

But, the 'cathedral organization' refers to the
organization of people and the _way_ they work. We are
not referring here about physical material, it is how
people interact in project development. In a cathedral
structure, a software engineer may not even have a
say, and the project leader and project manager make
design decisions. But, in a 'bazaar organization' each
one has a say and there is a "maintainer" who
maintains and patches the code.

>  Well, this list is supported by iit-m  :)

Again, this has nothing to do with the organization of
people.

K Shakthi

The OED defines "institution" as: "1. An important organisation or a 
public body such as a university.  2... 3. An established law or 
custom."  "Institutionalise" means to "establish as an accepted part of 
an organisation or culture."

Intellectual honesty is notionally, the highest at Universities.  They 
have considerable academic freedom, and the infrastructure required for 
doing research and development.  Eligible students are paid stipends, 
scholarships or other grants for their work.  A framework of formal 
rules are always present and the output generated is usually what would 
be worth archiving and using.    Originality of research output is a 
mandatory rule, but this does not mean that it has to be original from 
scratch, but only that the work done by the scholar has to be orginal, 
though built on work of others.  "Institutional support" for free 
software at Universities, merely means that the research output of 
students, hitherto copyright in favour of the University would be 
released under the GPL, FDL or other free licenses.  RMS left MIT while 
commencing the GNU Project, so that this issue would not be raised by 
the University, and now that the point has been made, Universities and 
its policy makers have enough justification to make the change for the 
better.  

Many Universities are already researching and trying out ways of 
providing institutional support for free software:

http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/webmaster-2004/talks/rahtz/html/
=> This does not mean Universities start competing with SourceForge. 
 Many live examples are discussed

http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=12034&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html
=> UNESCO and free software

http://www.isr.uci.edu/research-open-source.html
http://opensource.mit.edu/home.html
=> Research papers, etc. on this subject

http://www.chennailug.org
ilugc is easily an example of institutional support for free software.

"Cathedrals" like "IBM" are ultimately responsible to share holders who 
may value only profits[1].  Whereas,  Institutions have goals like 
"making provisions for advancement and dissemination of knowledge, to 
manage institutes of research, to organise labs, libraries and other 
equipment for research work, to institute professorships, teaching posts 
etc., to confer degrees etc." in the larger interests of the general 
public, and are governed by legislative Acts.  "Academic Freedom" also 
means having the freedom to choose the gap you want to fill, but 
nevertheless, the student is answerable to the guide.  The reputation of 
institutions rests upon the worthwhile projects they undertake, and that 
usually ensures progress.

Chinese company Lenovo.

If you want that sort of thing, this is not the list where that happens

You might be ignored however .. or maybe criticized. As you are being
already.

But as far as I can see ilugc is not the sort of list that kicks people off
or moderates them out just because they dont know what they are talking
about, and persist in raising silly arguments

My apologies for the long delay - I'm no Web-scraping expert and got
side-tracked :( I've finally managed to download about 130MB of
material and have burned 3 CD's (copies). The CD's are with Madan
Srinivasan who will be coming to MIT. I'm a little unsure about making
it to the LUG meeting since I've an appointment in Besant Nagar at
2:30.

Most of the files are .ps, .pdf, or .html. I've cleaned up the
refences to the actual website in some of the .html's (and they are
hopefully the ones that have .ps/.pdf copies). There may be other
issues that I've not found or thought of with the ebooks. Based on
feedback from this CD, I can add to/delete from/modify the selection.

To the best of my knowledge, the content stays true to the various
licenses. Please let me know if that doesn't turn out to be the case.

I noticed the LDP CD's are being sold at cost ($3.50) as part of an
inventory cleanup
(http://www.embeddedlogic.com/ELSweb/LDPCD_info.html). If somebody
gets a copy from the US and the contents turn out to be less than 800
MB, it might be a good idea to add the other material and generate a
fresh CD.

Message-ID: <000501c52726$32367f40$1ea841db@i0r1b2>

Hi all,
I am a mech engineer. If  there is one application which I felt Linux could
not match properly, I felt it was Autocad.

I felt really handicapped as in my regular work , I have to embed drawings
in my reports etc., make pdf files out of it and such other works. This is
the thing which hampers me going the whole hog to linux in my office work.

Pl do not suggest qcad as i struggled with it for a week and threw it
because user-friendliness is alien to it. Though I am not very proficient, I
can do Autocad work . But in qcad , it was a struggle even to draw simple
shapes.

Can any of you suggest a better application which is good enough and having
some of the major features at leasy of Autocad and capable of being
copy/pasted into other applns(like OO)?

dear linux people.

before somedays, i have tried to use smartlink internal modem with
suse 9.2 for internet.

I used the driver given by the modem cd.
I tried a lot. but failed., so ,i posed the log messages.

then, today, I googled for latest drivers and I got it from the
manufacturer's site itself.

After the installation of the correct driver, it works well. Thank u all.

It is really a very nice experience to surf in linux.

Thank You all.

I don't know about autocad. But, for drawings,
diagrams, I use either:

Dia (at home and office)
http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia/

OR 

Kivio (at office)
http://www.thekompany.com/projects/kivio/screenshots.php3

I save the diagrams as .png and import it in
openoffice.

Look at http://sourceforge.net/search/ and search for
autocad or cad for projects/software.

Pycad:

If you take a class of 40 final year students and
check their thesis document, how many of theirs will
be original authentic documentation? How many of them

How many UG engineering students in India publish

Maybe in IITs, RECs. What about other
universities/colleges?

Yes. You can count in India. That is one out of how

I accept all your statements if you talk about
universities/colleges in the
US/UK/Germany/Australia/Japan... But, if you take
India, and Tamil Nadu, in particular, we are still
following an old Anna University syllabus that doesn't
even come close to what the industry is working on. 

And we are doing workshops and trying our best to
create the awareness among
faculty/management/students, and involve them in free
software projects both from a career perspective and
for education. Whether we will see a large-scale
contribution from them is yet to be seen.

Well. I've seen it in all the presentations we did,
and I really like it. Although, the version is little
old, and some of the statements don't apply to the
current IT scenario.

This is too much of interviews and talks.

And yes, I have asked AB to get one when he flies down
from the US (in May), for ILUGC. Its about USD$22 (INR
1024 or something). Toufeeq and myself decided to
share the cost. If others want to contribute, you are
welcome. We can use the movie for our LUG activities.

Subject: [Ilugc] BSNL broadband modem options for Linux
Message-ID: <4233512F.8070101@email.com>

Folks:

There have been quite a few posts on ilugc in recent times stating that 
BSNL broadband works fine with Linux.

I have a few questions regarding the ADSL modem options:

1. I took a look at the application form at
    http://www.bsnl.co.in/service/dataoneform.php
    The form allows me to select whether I want a modem or not.  However,
    it does not allow me to choose an Ethernet v. a USB modem.  Do I
    assume that all their modems will be Ethernet?

2. The form allows me to decline a modem.  I am assuming that this means
    I can supply my own.  However, I am not able to locate the technical
    specifications of the modem required.  For example, what VPI/VCI
    settings would work.  Does anyone have these details?

Thanks.

Hello,
All modems are ethernet based only. No VPI/VCI required, it configures itself.
It is very easy to install on linux or anyother OS. Any modem which
supports pppoe(ppp over ethernet) will work

dull and boring. When creating presentations, many of us are
tempted to toss in every little feature the software
supports. Unfortunately, cluttered slides can be hard to
follow, and obnoxious design elements look cheap. One good
technique to enhance your presentations is to use the GIMP's
mask feature to make interesting text and cut-out objects,
and make those objects move on an OpenOffice.org Impress
slide.

Woo Windows Users with Linux-in-a-Box 
**************************************
In an effort to convince frustrated Windows users to adopt
Linux, Novell has introduced a new version of SuSE Linux
that bundles revamped applications and tools with the latest
version of the operating system. SuSE Linux Professional 9.3
includes the complete Linux operating system, more than
3,000 open-source packages, including the Microsoft
Office-compatible OpenOffice office suite, and hundreds of
open-source applications.

  The offering also includes a variety of graphics and
multimedia applications; multiple development tools; a
comprehensive set of Internet tools, including the
open-source Firefox 1.0 Web browser and e-mail and instant
messaging clients; an integrated firewall, spam blocker and
virus scanner; and support for VOIP (voice over IP) and
virtualization. By bundling such a vast array of
applications and tools, Novell hopes to woo Microsoft users
who may be frustrated with Windows' security bugs and might
be open to switching to Linux if the transition is smooth
and easy...

Desktop Linux wins plaudits for stability
*****************************************
CeBIT: Companies who choose open source software over
Windows for their enterprise resource planning tend to be
surprised by the absence of crashes, according to users and
vendors A company that migrated from Microsoft Windows to
Linux on the desktop has praised the open source operating
system's stability.

  Gnter Stoverock, the data processing manager at German
import company Heinz Trber, said on Thursday his firm had
decided against running its ERP software on Windows as it
considered it less stable than the open source alternative.
"We didn't want to rely on Windows-based systems as they
were quite instable and insecure," said Stoverock. "With
Linux there is no blue screen and no freezing - that was the
advantage for us."...

10 Reasons to Switch to Linux

1. It Doesn't Crash
  Linux has been time-proven to be a reliable operating
system. Although the desktop is not a new place for Linux,
most Linux-based systems have been used as servers and
embedded systems. High-visibility Web sites such as Google
use Linux-based systems, but you also can find Linux inside
the TiVo set-top box in many livingrooms.

  Linux has proved to be so reliable and secure that it is
commonly found in dedicated firewall and router systems used
by high-profile companies to secure their networks. For more
than ten years, it has not been uncommon for Linux systems

Fight Disease with Linux &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
Like SETI@Home, the Folding@Home project takes advantage of
distributed computing to analyze data for a singular goal.
However, rather than searching for extraterrestrial radio
signals, Folding@Home is focused on protein-folding
simulations; once doctors understand how proteins behave,
they can examine the causes of - and hopefully design cures
for - a plethora of diseases.

To make these projects more appealing, they're often
packaged as screensavers that display pretty pictures while
using your CPU's "spare" cycles to crunch data and send it
back to the project home (SETI, for example, had a cool

AmaroK is a step up for Linux audio players
*******************************************
With the release of amaroK 1.2 last month, I finally found
the Linux music player I've been wanting. When I moved to
Linux full-time about two years ago, the only software that
I missed from Windows was a quality audio player. Linux
audio players lacked features like cover downloads, smart
playlists, or easy burning to CD. Even worse, with a large
collection of more than 10,000 tracks, the Linux players
generally locked up when I tried to load them all, or at
least slowed to an unbearable crawl. AmaroK has all of the
basic features of modern Windows audio players, and some
features that I haven't seen in any other player.

  The name "amaroK" was taken from an album by composer Mike
Oldfield. Developer Mark Kretschmann said, "I've been a
long-time fan of Mr. Oldfield's work and thought the name
sounded nice, so I chose it for the application." Of course,
it doesn't hurt that the name already has a "K" in it. The
word means "wolf" in Inuit, which explains the various
amaroK logos....

Torvalds switches to Apple
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Linux creator Linus Torvalds said this afternoon that he's
now running an Apple Macintosh as his main desktop, mainly
for work reasons, although partly simply because he's a
self-described "technology whore". Torvalds, who initially
created Linux for the Intel x86 platform, revealed to the
Linux Kernel Mailing List in February during a discussion on
kernel size reduction that his main desktop machine no
longer featured an x86 processor. Hence, Torvalds said, a
patch specific to the x86 platform that he was submitting to
the list for consideration was totally untested.

  ZDNet Australia was intrigued by this remark, and sought to
question Torvalds on why the man who has single-handedly
revolutionised the use of Unix on the x86 platform would
move away from it, and where he had moved to. Torvald's
response came quickly and succinctly. "My main machine these
days is a dual 2GHz G5 (aka PowerPC 970) - it's physically a
regular Apple Mac, although it obviously only runs Linux, so
I don't think you can call it a Mac any more ;)" he said....

My Workstation OS: Linspire 4.5 **********************************
Built on a Debian Linux core, Linspire is designed for
simplicity of use, and it delivers this in spades. Linspire
eliminates the need for me to be technically proficient in
the nuances of Linux to successfully operate and enjoy the
OS. This includes loading software, staying updated, and
never seeing a command-line interface. It makes it very easy
to just get on with what I have to do and not worry about
the technicalities of using a Linux-based system.

  Installing Linspire is a often a pleasant surprise for
seasoned Linux users, as the operating system's hardware
detection routines are really top-notch. Many of the common
trouble spots for Linux, such as printers, USB keychain
drives, and DVD writers, are recognized and installed
automatically; no need to hunt for obscure libraries and

More-Secure Linux Still Needs To Win Users 
******************************************
The National Security Agency built a version of Linux with
more security tools that its technologists believe could
help make the country's computing infrastructure less
vulnerable. They've won over the Linux developer community
with the changes. But success depends on its adoption by
U.S. companies and government agencies, something that
remains very much in doubt.

  For more than a decade, the National Security Agency has
worked on a way to use a computer's operating systems to
control how software applications and users can access data.
The agency succeeded years ago in creating these "mandatory
access-control" features for specialized operating systems,
but very few users deployed them. Taking a gamble in 2000 on
the emerging Linux operating system, NSA started applying
its security approach to the open-source code. The result is

CLI Magic: Antiword *******************
It's a simple fact of life. Most people have not yet found
their way to freedom, and instead try to make themselves as
comfortable as they can be in captivity. They suffer the
burdens of the monopoly with only an occasional wince at the
thought of malware or a curse because of their latest crash.
This almost always means their word processing is done with
MS Word. We've got to learn to deal with them, and their
documents. Antiword is a very handy little tool for doing
just that. Shake the cobwebs of the GUI out of your head and
meet me at the CLI and I'll show you how to use it.

  Antiword is a GPLd, multiplatform labor of love by Adri van

The corporate desktop GNU/Linux distribution is a relatively

by Sun's Java Desktop System and Red Hat Desktop. But with
much less fanfare, Mandrakesoft released a Corporate Desktop
product last January. It's cheaper, has no minimum purchase
requirement, and has support options ranging from one to
five years. Compared to the alternatives, Mandrake Corporate
Desktop is suited more for smaller shops that need a
cost-effective and reliable desktop platform with corporate
support.

  Mandrake is traditionally known as a cutting-edge desktop
GNU/Linux distribution. It is often the first distro
recommended for many people when they consider switching to
GNU/Linux. Unlike other desktop distributions, Mandrake has
never been shy about including the most up-to-date software

The Oldest Trick in the Book
****************************
As the reach and deployment of computer technology expand,
the risks and problems associated with pervasive use and the
often breakneck speed of innovation and adoption impose more
and more frequently. And while numerous security advisories
are issued every day, those alerts probably represent only a
tiny fraction of the faults that exist and have yet to be
discovered - either by the good guys or the bad guys.

  One serious problem is vulnerability, where a fault or an
oversight in a software application allows unauthorized
access to the computer. While some vulnerabilities are
"mostly harmless" - for instance, spyware may be unwanted,
but is otherwise benign - others vulnerabilities can
undermine privacy and even breach security measures. A
significant weakness, or exploit, can even permit a
malcontent to trick a program into doing something it wasn't
designed to do.

  Oddly enough, the most commonly attacked exploit, the
buffer overflow, is also the oldest. Around since the
infancy of computers in the 1960s, buffer overflow first
gained widespread notoriety in 1988...

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Appeal from FSUG-Bangalore (about VTU)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
VTU-FLOSS Campaign

  Vice chancellor, Visveswaraiah Technologies University,
Belagum, Karnataka.

  Dear Sir,
  There are thousands of engineering and polytechnic colleges
in India. Each year lakhs of graduates and diploma holders
earn their degree. They pay thousands of rupees as fees to
get the best facilities. A part of this goes to buying the
software's which they use either in college lab or for doing
assignments at home.For every software which they use; there
is alternate Free Software program available. Now this shows
the amount of money which we can be saved if we start using
Free Software. This will bring down cost education
considerably.

  Other than cost benefits, Free Software has other
advantages
  * No-fee licensing
  * Ease of license fee management
  * Better large-scale programmability
  * Easier integration
  * Better performance
  * Development convenience
  * Better support

  There are hundreds of Free Software's programs which
colleges or universities can adopt. As Vishweshwaraiah
Technological University is one of the biggest universities
in India, its time for VTU to moving towards using Free
Software. This will make other Universities to follow. Let
the VTU have pride to be the first. Here I am giving you an
example of three such alternative Free Software's which can
be used.

  * (1) Operating System: Windows v/s GNU/Linux
  I don't know what university generally recommends to
colleges. But presently almost all the colleges use
Microsoft Windows based operating system. We all know the
best available operating system today is GNU/Linux. It is
the best OS any educational institution can have. Students
can not only use it but also can study.

  * (2) Simulation: Matlab v/s Octave
  Matlab is used in communication and electronics lab. Matlab
for individual license for university (academic use) costs
$500. Any college will have to buy minimum 25 licenses.
Which means shelling out Rs.537500. Octave, which is
simulation software written by University professors. This
usually comes with the GNU/Linux Operating System. The
advantage to students is that they don't have to buy a
limited student version to use at home. They can use Octave
both at Lab and at home. SciLab? is another open source
competitor for Matlab. It uses sophisticated algorithms to
analyze data and produce lovely graphics. Now you have the
choice which one you want to include in your curriculum.

  * (3) Office software's: MS Office v/s Open Office
  Well, we all used Microsoft word to submit our project
documents for review and for other academic purposes. Now we
have Open Office which is as good as MS office and has some
feature Microsoft Office lacks like PDF support,
compatibility with older versions of Microsoft Office, HTML
editor, a vector drawing application .... It gives you
everything starting from word processor, presentation
software to PDF generator [Fully compatible with Microsoft
Office -- So already existing data in those formats can be
used]. Don't you think it's the right time to save money of
a poor student ?

  The above are just examples. There are many such software
programs from which the students can benefit. We hope the
university understands the urgency and the need. We would be
happy to give you any information/help if university needs.
Here by we urge the university to make an effort in this
direction.

  Thank you,

About: Clone Linux System is a script that uses standard
Linux programs like dump, restore, stat, and parted to clone
and restore a Linux system. It supports ext2 and ext3
filesystems. RAID support is experimental. Changes: The full path of 
grub-install/lilo is now used in
restore.sh. All partitions detected by parted are now
removed in partition.sh. RAID and non-RAID system dumps are
now implemented in different scripts. A bug where /tmp was
used to perform a restore by default despite it not always
having enough space was fixed. A problem with detecting
inodes incorrectly was corrected and minor bugfixes were
made.

Actually, the Insitutional goals listed above, are from the Madras 
University Act, 1923, and the others in India too have similar objects. 
 Many free software components were researched and developed in 
Universities and making it a standard practice should not be too 
difficult.  

But a reminder is in place: Ancient India was far ahead in research 
because of a strong foundation built upon quest for truth.   
 Tarka-samgraha is a 400 year old commentary on more ancient "flame war" 
manuals  that lay the basics for any research.  Many of our ancient 
works on philosophy and research have the last say on the subject, and 
the reason why Marvin Minsky is researching them for his new book.  If 
the fire and passion for truth makes a come back - for a start, we will 
have high quality flame wars, research, prosperity and life which should 
solve many problems we face today.

Hi,

Is it just me or do people with Firefox 1.0.1 on
Debian/Ubuntu find a huge difference in Firefox's page
renderings ?

I think the reason is that firefox is now being
configured/packaged with the --build-for-pango (or
something similar) option.

This gives firefox a whole new look.
The best browser looks better than ever.

Do let me know what you feel or correct me if I'm
wrong :P

Quite obvious, you have an error in your tnsnames.ora file. Show us

Let's be practical.

Do colleges/universities try to achieve these goals?
Is there any law enforcement ... in India? It really
doesn't matter if you have laws or not, when there is
no enforcement.

Yes, I agree. We have been doing our homework.

My "Careers with GNU/Linux" presentation is
particularly for engineering students, which has been
presented by others too (Raman, Saravanan). It
explains how students can use GNU/Linux for their
engineering coursework. 

I have explained how Anna University syllabus is _not_
going to help them in the industry w.r.t. skills and
practical knowledge, when compared to what UG
engineering students do in foreign countries. It is
quite unfortunate that engineering students (a
majority of them) pay a lot of moeny for their 4 years
of UG study, but, really don't get any practical
knowledge out of it.

We can give to these colleges our precious time,
effort and knowledge, but, they should give back to
this community. Institutions have good infrastructure,
manpower, and time compared to the industry. We must
also not forget that we can only bring the horse to
the pond, but can't make it drink the water. Students
should take the initiative if they want to develop
their skills and learn. This approach will also
motivate them to continue learning in the industry.

Of course we have IIT-M, AU, UoM etc created by various laws, that are 
functioning and fulfilling their objects as per law, enforcing the 
provisions under which they are created.  The issue of introducing free 
software in the syllabus, and releasing research output under free 
licenses, is largely a matter of policy at the moment. They could also 
be  brought in through legislation to usher in uniform practices everywhere.

Shakthi, I hope you are not taking this too personally ;)

Volunteers have been doing quite a lot, and if the institutions get more 
involved, the contributions from India will surely reach fantastic 
proportions.  A lot of research output is generated every year, but 
because of policy issues, the research is either not published to the 
public or has very limited reach.  There is sure to be needless 
duplication of research when the output is not freely available to all. 
 Releasing them under the  GPL, FDL, or other like free licenses will 
mean that we could google or index them in more meaningful ways and get 
to them.  It is a mere case of making things more explicit and visible 
to the world.  Full access to research is very important to avoid 
duplication.  This in fact helps all fields of intellectual endeavour, 
and not just free software. Sometime last year, FSF India sent a 
memorandum to CSIR to publish output in open formats and also release 
them to the public under free licenses and that is available online at 
http://www.gnu.org.in/csir_memo.pdf .  AFAIK, there was no response to 
that memorandum, but it only means we should find other ways to seek 
"enforcement" :)

Kind Regards,
Ramanraj.

I told that I am not to harass anyone. I was just investigating why
nobody is in lead position. It is same as in sports.
    I am thinking of this for some time. On march 9, 2003 I came to
Chennai. This means from that day onwards I am having an always on
internet connection at office and I felt like I am in heaven. I
utilised that very much for my work and to acquire knowledge. I was
very much intereseted in open source software because of these mailing
lists. People in the mailing lists helped me a lot in solving problems
and learning new things. Hence I decided to contribute back to the
community. But I was distracted from this because of my work and
personal things. As the second anniversary was coming I was deeply
thinking of my achievements and I decided to ask this one here.

    BTW I am contributing to open source software by answering newbie
questions in some of the mailing lists.

    Thanks for all the replies and I apologise If I hurt anyone.

This is the problem. grep is having ability to do pattern search for few number of files.

Try as,

find <dir> -type f | xargs grep <pattern>

HTH.

you can use "dpkg" or "dselect" commands to install/uininstall packages.
You can also use rpm with debian. For this you have to first install rpm 
package using "dpkg" or "dselect".
I think using rpm on debian is not at all safe.

AFAIK it's best not to use rpm on a Debian System.
Use apt-get instead.

man apt-get

Have you tried setting the volume settings in the mixer in the Sound
and Video tab of the menu. This should mostly do it.

Also I am just curious but this is just the reverse of what happens
whenever I run a 2.6 kernel based distro on an i845 motherboards with
onboard audio chipsets.

KDE gives an error message on strtup that no sound device could be
configured and the default will be used. However strangely XMMS plays
correctly without any problems.

Hello,

I have couple of questions regarding BSNL broadband.

1. Can I see a DEMO from BSNL office before applying for the same?
    I tried asking them as well as their "Sangamam" call centre but they are
    clueless. Did any of you happen to witness a Demo?

2. If I buy the ADSL Modem not from them, where else can I get it?
    (Like Ritchie St., etc) Is it cheaper/reliable/compatible
    than the price offered by BSNL people? If anyone purchased from a vendor
    what was the price?

3. If my 1st question could not be answered, can someone (if possible)
    who has taken a Broadband connection at office or home, show me a Demo?
    Would really like to experience the speed it's offering beforehand I
    apply for one.

4. Do they provide a system (web interface sort of thing) to monitor the
bandwidth usage?
    Till June I won't have any restriction but after that will they provide,
so that I can keep
    an eye over my bandwidth usage.

5. How long do they take to give a connection after the application is
submitted?

I asked their call centre, helpline and other officials and couldn't get a
vivid answer.
So I thought of asking someone who has already taken a connection presently.
Sorry for asking too many questions but I would appreciate your reply. Thank
you!

Regards,
Franklin

P.S: If this posting might create ripples please reply me off the list :-)

That is an excellent contribution - one of the best ways to contribute

Leading open source projects is not all that counts

I agree that is important but there's definitely a lot of participation 
in open source projects and that is very useful too

Slightly OT:
I kind of find it annoying how globbing is done at the shell level and
not at the program level. 
Yes, this makes it easier to write your program but at the same time,
this causes all sorts of unexpected results.

My favorite is how someone's directory had a file called "-r" (created
accidently by giving incorrect arguments to some other program) and the
user executed "rm *".
The shell expands the "*" and "-r" is treated as a command-line argument
causing rm to recursively delete everything.
Lots of fun...

That is not a problem as such, just that your server is doing tls to the
recipient server, and the certificate doesnt get verified.

The error is elsewhere .. that sendmail transaction is spread across multiple
log lines. Check and post the full log showing this smtp transaction

I don't know about VI, but it can be simply done with shell 
for x in `cat usersfile`; do echo "$x@domain.com"; done

redirect that to a new file

Please sign this petition if you agree with it... it's an attempt to convince a 
prominent technological university in Bangalore (VTU) to be opened to the use 
of Free Software too.

Krishna Pagadala, San Jose, USA. I have benefitted highly from the Free 
Software movement and the Freedoms it has provided. Specifically the Freedom to 
learn from the source code has helped me in getting a high-technology job in 
the US. I wish that all students enjoy the all the Software Freedoms.

Pramode C.E, IC Software: I would like to add that there are efforts under way 
to develop innovative hardware experimentation platforms using GNU/Linux to 
improve the quality of Physics (as well as Engineering) education; and the best 
part is that it's being done in India. Please visit 
http://www.nsc.res.in/~elab/phoenix/ to know more about the `Phoenix Project' 
being developed by Ajith Kumar at the Nuclear Science Centre, India. The wealth 
of high quality tools and the open nature of the platform is of immense value 
to young engineers and scientists raring to unleash their creativity; the 
lessons in freedom and sharing that students learn by using GNU/Linux will also 
go a long way in shaping their character as caring and responsible human 
beings.

ashidhar b desai ,6th sem E&C, B.V.Bhoomaraddi College of Engineering & 
Technology Hubli,Karnataka,India ,FLOSS is an excellent alternative for the 
existing commercial softwares..Academics(colleges and univ) is the best way to 
promote and support "Free Software".It will be a great initiative if the univ 
adopts it(it will become an example for other univ & institutes). News about

OPEN SOURCE.

Praveen Arimbrathodiyil (National Instititute of Technology, Calicut) Fri Mar 
11 17:34:50 IST 2005 We use GNU/Linux in our main Computer center. It saves a 
lot of money of the college as there is no licence fee to be paid for each 
users. Since the source code of the softwares are available many computer 
science students do projects based on Linux kernel and other such projects. The 
possibility of use of thin-clients (which our computer center use) reduces the 
cost of hardware dramatically. It has proved to be beneficial to our college 
and I urge you to chose Free Software for giving a better alternative for 
students.

Debapriyo Sarkar. Final year student of BCA, Goa. As a student, I plead to 
every university, to adopt, encourage and spread the use of Free/Libre Open 
Source Software (FLOSS). The benefits are clearly far-more significant than 
cost savings (which of course is a huge motivating factor). The quality of 
software reviewed and worked on by virtually the entire developer community of 
the world is definitely at least world-class if nothing else. It is possible to 
save on costs with $0 priced closed source software often termed as freeware, 
but the limited resources of the single developer or the couple of developers 
behind the software makes future of such software bleak. Compared to that, 
software released under an open source license, helps user as well as developer 
involvement to happen as deeply and transparent as no other licensing model can 
support. As the letter includes the following (stripped) statement "...Octave, 
which is simulation software written by University professors. This usually 
comes with the GNU/Linux Operating System." which clearly shows that professors 
of universities elsewhere have contributed to the solution of making quality 
software available to the students and colleges alike under a license that 
welcomes further contributions to improve the project virtually endlessly. As a 
personal experience, I often have used open source alternatives whenever 
acquiring the proprietary packages meant depending on the lab assistant to 
provide the CD for illegal copying or genuinely going out and shelling out all 
those huge wads of cash for functionality that was already at my disposal with 
added advantage of continuing development and a long-life (of the software). As 
universities use and recommend use of open source software,rate of development 
is bound to grow with more and more students using the same version of software 
both at college and home (no limited cheap "student" edition which are "cheap" 
imitations with myriad "limitations"). Also professors' contributions in the 
form of bug reports, bug fixes, new functionality patches and their work in 
increasing awareness about the benefits of using open source software would 
help improve quality of free software to an enormous extent.

As others have pointed out, this is easy to do without vi, but since you
asked, you could just use a macro.
Go to the first line in command mode and type
@qA@whatever.com<Esc>j^q

(Replace @whatever.com with whatever domain name you want)
Then:
<Esc>:50@q
To apply the change to all lines
(where "50" is the number of remaining lines in the file)

Not as easy in this case as using cat or sed but this is, in-general a
useful technique when editing in vi

See :help q for more details.

I find that this provides a consistent behaviour across all
applications. It also lets application programmers NOT to worry about
file globbing in their applications. Why should every single program
handle * or ~ or ? expansion? How about environment expansion (things
like vim $OLDPWD/somefile.txt)?

And if you REALLY hate shell filename globbing, you could turn it off
with set -f.

All distros I have seen recently default to rm -i (usually via an
alias), so I don't think this is a real problem.

In vim:

:%s/$/@somedomain.com/

In perl:

perl -pi -e 's/$/@somedomain.com/' filename

Create a backup of your file before you try anything!

Yep, I noticed the error in this only later:

perl -pi -e 's/$/\@somedomain.com/' filename

On the other hand, the input redirection makes it pointless to use
perl's in-place editing features. Ideally, I'd do:

perl -pi .bak -e '...' filename

getting the best of both worlds.

Agreed. Very helpful  when doing things like replacing  stuff on a set

Message-ID: <614380C6B0E7AC498D4DAE964E2F553DD99447@chatgavsin.com>


At last, yestarday night, I could see my machine's  stats on a 16x2 
LCD display. Has been quite a while that I wished I could have this
working.

Good thing is that the LCD that I bought around 6 months is flooding
Ritchie street now. I forgot how much I paid for it - might be around
150-200 Rs. There is a grey area here - I assumed that the LCD has a
HD44780 controller. That's  because  I couldn't  see any chip on the 
exterior ( and I have not yet opened it up ;). I configured  lcdproc  
for HD44780 and went along with the 'winamp' connection scheme. This 
is an 8 bit connection scheme. Earlier I tried with a 4 bit connection, 
but it didn't work. Must have goofed up somewhere. 

Actually  I had it  working on Sunday itself. But I got the contrast 
adjustment wrong. So even thought the screen was flickering, I couldnt
see any data. Yestarday I realized that the contrast is max when pin 
3 is connected to ground. And voila! There was my CPU usage on the
display!

Things pending now is getting the backlight brightness and contrast
tuning right. Now, the backlight is so bright that it almost shadows
the text. The other problem is that I sometimes get garbled data.
This might  be due to a high data transfer rate. This parameter is 
tunable in  lcdproc with the help of a myltiplier. Will have to get
it right. 

This Sat I bought another LCD for Rs 350 from Omega electronics. The 
HD44780A00 chip is seen at the back of the LCD. Its a Solomon make.
But the problem with this one is that it doesn't have points to take
wires out. There is a delicate connector and I have not been able to 
find a suitable ribbon for it.

I wish to showcase this in MIT LDD.

I wished to! I don't possess any digital camera. Let me see if 
I can get it from my colleague today.

Why fiddle much with perl,sed,bash .... ?  There is only way to do it.
Do it in python

$ cat infile | python -c "import sys; print
'\n'.join([x[:-1]+'@domain.com' for x in sys.stdin.readlines()])" >

setting noclobber would be useful as well

having rm default to rm -i (and similar other helpful behavior) tends to get
irritating though.

One Day One Command :-
====================

yes -- Print a string until interrupted

Summary :

It prints the command line arguments, separated by spaces & followed
by a newline, forever until it is killed. 'yes' can be used to feeds a
continuous string of the character to another process and create dummy
process for learning the process control.

Example:

$ yes -- Prints `y' followed by a newline until killed.

$ yes Midas -- Prints `Midas' followed by a newline until killed.

$ yes `cat myfile` -- Print myfile content until killed.

$ yes | fsck /dev/hda1 -- Runs fsck non-interactively.

$ yes | rm -r mydir -- Same effect as rm -rf mydir.

$ yes > /dev/null & -- Dummy process.

Read : man yes

>From the Flumotion Website:

What is Flumotion?

Flumotion is a streaming media server created with the backing of Fluendo.
It features intuitive graphical administration tools, making the task of setting up and manipulating audio and video streams easy for even novice system administrators.
Flumotion is released under the GPL. 

As it's released under GPL, I believe it's open source :P

You could also try Gnomemeeting which is similar to NetMeeting on Windows.

That's cheap. I got one for 1,600 about  2 years ago!! Try LCD4Linux. It is
easier to use than LCDProc as you do not have to write a client but can have
arbitrary text or command output also redirected to the LCD display apart
from bar charts.

But with lcdproc, you can monitor remote machines by installing the

there. In fact that's what I am doing currently. To avoid major damage,
if 
any occured due to gross error, I connected the LCD to my Pentium I
machine
running RH 6.2. I ran the server in that machine. I installed the client

in my Debian machine and am monitoring it.

But yes, you have a point. LCD4linux is more configurable. That includes

the signals you send thru the parallel port!

Use yum. You just need to add the repository details, and yum is very
much like apt, in that it handles dependencies, package-name search
etc.

If you still want to use APT in Fedora, go for freshrpms or dag, and
get APT for FC3 from there. However, they do not have mirrors nearby;
so you must settle for low speeds!!

Plus, if you really must install from an RPM, use alien. It converts
RPMs to DEBs. Then, justuse dpjg -i <generated deb>. But always go for
the deb package when available.

Didnt understand what exactly you want. I assume that you
want a program that has write permission on /etc/passwd 
for all users.

Since only root has write permission you would have to give
suid with owner for your c program (executable)

If a.out is your executable
do 

chmod u+s a.out
(root should be the owner of a.out)

If your question is how to do this from inside a C program 
pls see

man 2 chmod

Gopu.

At CMI, like previous years we are organizing an Inter-College

can be found at the http://www.cmi.ac.in/fiesta05/.
We are also holding an National Online Programming Contest
alongside Fiesta '05, on 20th. there will be a trial run
for the programming contest tomorrow evening. I guess posters
might have already reached, or should reach you very shortly.
But, inany case, I would like to request you to please pass the
message among the students. This year there is abt 20K to be won
on the day of Fiesta '05, and another 7.5K in the programming
contest.

Dont know if it is ok to do a reply to all, 
but this is something all ebook searchers can do:

To locate the book, "understanding the linux kernel", 
Fire a search in google with the full string below in quotes

"understanding the linux kernel.pdf"

(this got a few hits for me!!)
or with chm, doc, zip, rar etc.,!

you can improvise on this...basically..how will you store a file which
has a long name? how will you archive the file?

BEWARE: Some of the links may take u to unpleasant sites, so watch out!
Also some of the links may be dead; With patience and "IF" it is out
there, Google will get it!!
This method has rarely failed for me!
And, Usually when you find one ebook, there is a high probability you
will find more books!!!

Finally,
Most Of These Ebooks Are NOT LEGAL To Possess.
So be aware of what you want to do with it!

Google Hurray!!!

You might have better results if you google:

"understanding the linux kernel" filetype:pdf

In which case it would search for the mentioned string in all PDF files it has.

Hi,

Its just an assumption.

I have see solaris source code has been released in their own licence
(CDDL). for many years the unix clone solaris source code has not been
opened to public by sun microsystems. now they just released the
source code. what does happen if Microsoft releases their windows
source code (its assumption) using some sort of licence ?? most of the
developers will be switching to windows development kind of thing??? 
Please dont give the suggesstions as "they will not release the code!"
In  that case whats going to the future of linux OS????

You could detect the source by:

tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags] == 0'

(if you and I mean the same thing by nullpackets).

IMO, it is going to be a question of momentum. Linux has generated so
much of it that MS might not be able to catch up. Further, opening
their code will open up all the hidden security bugs and sloppy code
that Windows is rumoured to contain that it will be a disaster for MS.

There's a user postfix already there, aliased to root, in /etc/aliases

suresh@etherkiller 17:50:02 <~> $ id postfix
uid=1001(postfix) gid=100(users) groups=100(users)

suresh@etherkiller 17:50:04 <~> $ grep postfix /etc/postfix/aliases
postfix:        root

So, the moral of this story is -

1. Read the postfix docs before you ask questions. They are incredibly 
detailed and will cover almost anything you want. Read the FAQ first.

2. Dont use the postfix user for regular mail delivery

  The issue is not whether the source is visible - rather, the
issue is whether subsequent modifications are allowed, and
who owns the code and the subsequent modifications. If
it's all going to belong to the original owner (like most
'shared source' initiatives), there's no reason anybody is
going to waste their time and effort trying to improve it.

  Very big difference from any piece of GPLed code, including
Linux. If I contribute a patch, I own the copyright to it under
the GPL.

  There's no particular reason I can think of to even
browse through the allegedly 'released' Windows CE source.
OTOH, there's every reason to avoid looking at it altogether,
to preempt tainting GPLed code through subsequent contributions.

Nowhere in that link does it say Solaris is a Unix clone.

though i dono much in Solaris..

this is wat i read in that link
==================
Solaris - (Sun Microsystems) Sun Unix-based user environment,
including the Unix operating system and an X11-based window system.
Solaris 1.x is a retroactive (marketing?) name for SunOS4.1.x, a
BSD-like version of Unix with some SVR4 features. Solaris 2.x (which
is what most people mean by "Solaris") includes SunOS5.x, which is an
SVR4-derived Unix.
===================

doesnt that mean its a unix clone? 
if not please explain wat they mean in the above statements...

"clone" has rather different meanings

perhaps this might put it into perspective for you

  First, don't top-post - it makes it difficult to understand what
you're responding to:

Second, check the Unix history chart to get the history of Solaris right:

http://www.levenez.com/unix/

Somewhere around 1985, you can see the arrows relating to SunOS and
Solaris. A quick backtrace shows that it is primarily derived from
4.1 BSD, with some elements licensed from System V later.

By no means can it be called a 'Unix clone' - it is widely known
from the terms of the legal settlement between USL (copyright holders
for Unix) and BSDI (successor-in-interest to the University of
California, copyright holders for BSD) that only
about 4 files out of about 17,000 in BSD had anything even remotely
similar to copyrighted code in Unix - and even those were very easy
to replace and work around if necessary. When this finding of fact
was made, USL chose to capitulate rather than be beaten to pulp in
court and be penalized heavily on the cost of the suit.

As a matter of abundant precaution, Sun had taken a Unix System V
license from AT&T earlier, but this does not imply that SunOS/Solaris
is/was derived from Unix. Rather, it was AT&T and USL that had stolen
considerable BSD code and incorporated it in System V without the
permission and copyright attributions of the University of California.

Perhaps, it helps the (otherwise) clueless Windows system programmer to 
maneuver around the dumb design/architecture and idiosyncrasies of the 
Windows OS. It rather sounds like playing minesweeper, but with 
cheat-code to know all the land-mine locations before-hand.

For a FLOSS developer, any of these "shared-source" 
license would be a bait (especially, for those who work on projects like 
Wine or Samba).

No drastic changes would happen to the Free software/Open Source arena, 
IMO; it would progess as smoothly, the way its been doing for so many 
years. Just that a lot of good developers might migrate to the Linux 
platform (after some comparison on source/design).

I doubt it. I suspect the reverse might happen (with a lot of "good"

MS releasing its source is not/never going to
happen.forget the if's and but's.

What will happen is the drop in price of the Windows
Operating System. You can already see this trend in
South East Asian countries as a legit copy of Windows
is almost equal to a pirated one albeit it's nerfed
off  most of the features.

I'm expecting Longhorn to be free or atleast sold at a
single digit price (dollars).Ofcourse the cheap
version will have any useful functionality stripped
off but will be good enough for Joe-Sixpack. Now, if
Joe-Sixpack wants the full Windows version, with all
the bells and whistles he's gotto shell out more $$ . 

I'm also expecting a price hike on MS's flagship
products like Office, Visual Studio etc.

So, MS sells the OS at a loss but makes up with the
applications.Now the catch is that these applications
will only work on a legit copy of Windows and maybe
incorporate TCPA aka Palladium. We are already seeing
TCPA enabled Hardware in Thinkpads, its not long
before MS too joins the party and I think Longhorn 
will be the occasion where the unholy alliance with
TCPA is finalised.

So, we all are in for an exciting ride in the next 2
years.I'm just glad I'm riding on the Free-way.

Weird you should mention it - I was just reading about this - it is
being launched in India in June:

http://sify.com/finance/fullstory.php?id=13693695

They might be able to sell this for maybe a few hundred rupees, but (quoting):

"With Windows XP Starter Edition, first-time home PC users could have
up to three programmes and three windows per programme running
concurrently. Further simplification of the operating system included
the display resolution set to 800x600 maximum and no support for
PC-to-PC home networking, sharing printers across a network or more
advanced features such as the ability to establish multiple user
accounts on a single PC."

Is that how a modern OS should be? No networking, no multitasking
worth speaking about, no high-res displays... Three programs will
include your mail, browser and IM - that means you cannot use ANYTHING
else - even a second IM or a game or your digicam or cellphone/PDA
sync app or... What use is such a "personal" computer?

I'm curious to know whether the three-window limit applies to
MS-shipped software as well - particularly IE. I have seen people
having upto 15 IE windows open at any given time. Also, are they
removing the TCP/IP stack altogether? Hooking it up with our ISPs is
going to be fun then.

> So, MS sells the OS at a loss but makes up with the

I'm not sure their antitrust settlement allows them to do that.

As I pointed out in the LUG-HYD list couple of days ago, posting such
a request should be grounds for an immediate booting/blacklisting from
the list, no questions asked. This is not even comparable with other
offences which might go through a warning-warning-moderation-booting
cycle. Any tolerance towards such antisocials will only tarnish the
reputation of the list/lug concerned.

On one hand, I agree. It makes sense to relieve the application
programmer of these details. On the other hand, I've seen many programs
(esp. gui apps) where entering "~/some_file" for the file path doesn't
do what you want.
Good programs that deal with files should be able to handle these things
without relying entirely on the shell.

Cool. Didn't know that existed. In any case, its not that I don't want
it. Rather, its important that people using '*' and such are aware of
whats actually going on.

If I remember correctly, the shell's file globbing part is actually
handled by glob(3), part of the standard C library (and specified by
POSIX.2). It really is sloppy programming if any software tries to do
globbing internally (rather than pulling in the glibc version) and
should be reported as a bug in the software.

A lot of software doesn't do globbing *at all*.
(I suppose that those that do, would use the existing library)
And its not just the expansion of wild-cards.
Even things like "substituting ~/ for the users' home directory" are not
done.
I believe this needs to be done manually in the program -ie, there's no
canonical library call to do these substitutions.

That's right. They don't do it because they rely on the shell to do it for them.

Haven't we come a full circle here?

No. Take a look back at what I said a few mails ago.

I'm talking about cases where you don't pass in the path as an argument.
I'm talking about cases where you need to specify a path in an entry field
in a gui dialog box. I'm talking about cases where you specify the path in
a .rc file.
In many of these situations, programs don't properly handle "~/" and
related syntaxes.

Thats what I was referring to in my previous mail.

Thanks,
Haran

People should use linux,opensource because its not free for cost,
but its free for freedom. And thats what users should understand,
and i think, releasing a wnidows version with limited features at low price
will make ppl think, what they are getting for price, and what they are
getting for freedom,
i.e paying some dollars they are getting a limted software with limited
features as well loss of  freedom,
and by choosing freeway, they will know what the real freedom can mean.....
all we need is good projects to make the best userfriendly desktops, so that
any layman can install and start using linux.... once we start makin this,
people will automatically switch over, this change will be slow but stable
and good.....

httpd.conf belongs to apache rpm. How would it be part of php your php
rpm ? Please double check your compilation process.

If you are using redhat/fedora linux, IMO you wouldn't require to
re-compile php to support mysql, pgsql. With regard to db2 please
check though. If you wish to install php and if you are not
customizing the package, just walk through the following steps to
install & configure php with mysql & pgsql support:

1) Locate php rpm for your distribution & install (rpm -ivh)
2) Locate php-mysql rpm & install
3) Locate php-pgsql rpm & install
4) Open /etc/php.ini & locate for following lines

;extension=mysql.so
;extension=pgsql.so

Uncomment them, now it should look like:

extension=mysql.so
extension=pgsql.so

5) Configure httpd.conf (refer apache manual for details)
6) Test your apache & php installation using phpinfo().

Use a live CD, such as Knoppix or Mepis, and boot into that
system. Mount your Linux filesystem to some directory. Then, chroot to
that directory using chroot /mnt/hda5 (or wherever you have mounted
you Linux drive). Then, issue grub-install /dev/hda. That might work.

If you are facing this problem too often than not, try this...

Assumptions :--
  You are having a dual OS { with LINUX one of them, and GRUB/LILO as
the boot loader } and any Windows OS as the other.

To Do :--

  (1)  Backup your MBR using the utilities like MBRWiz or MBRUtil from
your Windows/LINUX OS, while you're Dual OS booting is successful with
GRUB/LILO.  Save the MBR you backed up to some safe location, where your
reinstallation will not affect it.
  (2)  Re-install your Windows OS. { Yea, it sure wipes out GRUB/LILO }
  (3)  Restore from the Backed-up MBR.

Atleast it works for me.

I havn't used ksh but the grep command should be the same anywhere.
You can recursively search like this:

grep -d recurse * -e "expression-to-search-for"

"-d recurse" is  gratuitously verbose, I know, but I don't know if theres
a better way.

Blogger.com/Blogspot has this functionality.

I'm not sure about LJ, but I think even LJ should  provide this.

Your shell shouldn't matter. Which OS are you running this on? It
doesn't sound like GNU grep. If it is Solaris, then you can ask your
system administrator to install GNU grep from sunfreeware.com.

In case of sources do : "make uninstall" from the source directory. 

In case of rpm's do : rpm -e <package name>

You can have a look at GNU Stow, GNU Graft, depot, etc.

You can have a look at these two websites and decide which suits you best.

http://kernelnewbies.org and http://kerneljanitors.org

Both of these websites provide kernel related projects for newbies.

You could also follow LKML ( Linux Kernel Mailing List) to 
get an idea of what is the "in" thing in the kernel community.

But your mailbox will be flooded with 300+ emails/day.
Unless you have the right filters set dont join the list.

You have been warned ! :)_

An alternative to LKML is http://kerneltraffic.org

For the latest Kernel related News ( Linux + *BSD ) use http://kerneltrap.org

I typically run configure as:

./configure --prefix=/opt/foo-2.1

Then uninstalling is as easy as rm -rf /opt/foo-2.1. Managing is ls /opt :)

Sometimes the main makefile includes an uninstall target, which you can use.

For rpms, to list in chronological order of installation:

rpm -qa --last

You can extract tarballs, rpms, and debs for trivial packages into a
directory and still use stow.

No. The administrator usually follows one way of installing 95% of the
packages, and based on the method of installation, there are solutions
available deb, rpm, etc. It is not difficult to handle the special case in
a different manner.  A union of the output of all the commands would take
care of this. And the appropriate command to remove the package should be
used.

IMHO, any benefit offered by one program is minimal.

Some old versions of grep donot have the -r option.
I didnt have this option in the Solaris machine I used to
work on some time back. Thants when I found out the 
utility of the -exec option of find.

find somedir -type f -exec grep "the_expr_goes_here" {} \;

Since grep is not a shell built-in the version of grep is 
what matters here.

$ uniq -c myfile -- Print all unique lines with no .of occurrence.

$ uniq -d myfile -- Print only duplicate lines. If a line duplicated
                    then, only one line will be printed.

$ uniq -D myfile -- Print all duplicate lines.

$ uniq -w5 myfile -- Use only first 5 Chars for checking the uniqueness 
                     of the line.

$ uniq -f2 myfile -- Don't compare up-to 2nd field.

I believe JotSpot ( http://jotspot.com/) does this - not sure of the
licensing terms, or whether any blogging sites offer a jot based
service.

OK, I signed up for this darned Hi5 to figure out why I was getting
spammed like this. 18 invites in a single day!

The _first_ page after you signup says "Find Out Which of Your Friends
are on hi5". Basically, it allows you to upload all email addresses
from your (a) Outlook (b) Hotmail (c) Yahoo and (d) AOL accounts to
Hi5 and spam the whole lot. While the Outlook one needs an ActiveX
control (and by extension, IE),  the others just need your
account/password.

I tried my hotmail ID and password - they logged into hotmail for me
and picked up the address book. I could spam the lot with one more
click (which I didn't do - why bother them poor spammers?).
Essentially, Hi5 spams EVERY single address in your address book
without much of a warning.

Needless to say, the next dude to try this on the LUG list should get
the boot. I see Hi5 has already become a problem for a number of
online forums - check out http://tinyurl.com/4v7op

Karnataka State, India

Respected Sir,

         Re: Opening wider software avenues for your students through Free
         Software.

There are thousands of engineering and polytechnic colleges in India. Each 
year, a few hundred thousands of graduates and diploma holders earn their 
degree. They pay thousands of rupees as fees to get the best facilities. A part 
of this goes to buying the softwares which they use either in college lab or 
for doing their assignments at home.

For every software which India's engineering students use; there is an 
alternate Free Software program available. Free Software offers freedom, 
accelerated possibilities and wider vistas to our students. But in a 'talent 
rich, resource poor' country like India, it is also an issue of costs. Huge 
amounts of resources will be saved, and productivity gained, while deploying 
Free Software. This will not only make engineering education more 
cost-effective, but also more productive.

Free/Libre and Open Source Software has many other advantages such as 
reliability, performance and security; building up of long-term capacity within 
the state and country itself; the Free (as in freedom) philosophy; encouraging 
innovations; offering alternatives to illegal copying; throwing up many 
possibilities in localisation; helping students vastly by allowing them to 
learn from the source code; getting access to literally thousands of tools; in 
addition, of course, to lower costs.

Issues related to Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) in education are 
outlined very well at http://www.iosn.net/education/foss-education-primer/

Other than cost benefits, Free Software has other extremely pertinent 
advantages. We would urge you to serious consider the following:

     * No-fee licensing
     * Ease of license fee management
     * Better large-scale programmability
     * Easier integration
     * Better performance
     * Development convenience
     * Better support

Niranjan Rajani in a study on FLOSS in the developing world, notes, "FLOSS has 
a complementary and reciprocal relationship to education. One needs an educated 
section of the population to fulfil the full potential of FLOSS, and at the 
same time FLOSS helps, enhances, and complements education by providing tools 
to promote education."

In the case of education in computer sciences, FLOSS provides opportunities 
which nothing else can, as the Finland-based researcher Rajani points out:

     * Unrestricted access to the source code.
     * An environment of unlimited experimentation and tinkering.
     * Collaboration and interaction with a community of programmers,
       coders and users around the world.

In addition to providing ready and available tools, Free Software provides 
positive examples from projects around the globe. In practice, this means that 
if someone in some other place has created a tool to reach a specific 
educational goal, one can take it as a starting point and build on it, without 
the need to "reinvent the wheel". The Dspace project and the Koha library 
software, mentioned earlier, are but two simple examples of such possibilities. 
As far as collaboration is concerned, Sourceforge is perhaps the biggest 
collaboration project ever created, uniting tens of thousands of software 
projects and hundreds of thousands of people around the world. "FLOSS itself 
has been called the most collaborative human effort ever," as Rajani points 
out.

In addition to the above, the inherent qualities of FLOSS make it a prime tool 
for achieving local language educational software, especially for languages 
which are not deemed commercially viable for proprietary software vendors. This 
has the scope of offering both relevance and employment to so many of your 
bright young students.

There are literally hundreds of Free Software's programs which colleges or 
universities can adopt. As Vishweshwaraiah Technological University is one of 
the biggest engineering-related universities in India, its time for VTU to give 
the lead and move towards using Free Software. This would encourage other 
Universities to follow suit. Let the VTU have the pride to be the first one to 
adopt Free Software in educational curriculum, on a scale significant enough to 
make a difference to the future of VTU, its many students, and India itself.

Here we submit some examples of three such alternative Free Software programs 
which can be used for technical education.

* (1) Operating System: Windows v/s GNU/Linux

Because of the software tools prescribed in the colleges, and also a general 
lack of awareness of Free Software options, most colleges use Microsoft Windows 
based operating system. Yet, in terms of technological features, stability, 
learning possibilities, the GNU/Linux is increasingly being recognised as the 
best available globally. It is the best suited for any educational institution. 
Students can not only use it, but also can study its source code to understand 
its internal workings. Likewise, they can easily get in touch with the many 
volunteers who have put together this amazing set of tools, and collaborate 
internationally to created more suitable products and also hike their own 
skill-sets.

But many of the colleges use or have started adopting GNU/ Linux, starting with 
the server room, where it is well known for its stability and security now it 
has entered our labs and desktops.

* (2) Simulation: Matlab v/s Octave

Matlab is used in communication and electronics lab. Matlab for an individual 
license for use in a university (academic use) costs $500. Any college will 
have to buy a minimum of 25 licenses. This means shelling out Rs.537,500.

Octave, which is a simulation software written by university professors. This 
usually comes, along and as part of, the GNU/Linux Operating System. The 
advantage to students is that they don't have to buy a limited student version 
to use at home. They can use Octave both at lab and at home.

SciLab? is another Free Software competitor for Matlab. It uses sophisticated 
algorithms to analyse data and produce aesthetic graphics.

NG-SPICE is another GPLd Circuit Simulator which is based on the University of 
Berkley's Spice Version 3f5.

* (3) Office software's: MS Office v/s Open Office

Currently, we all used Microsoft Word to submit our project documents for 
review and for other academic purposes. Recent technological developments now 
mean that we have Open Office which is as good as Microsoft Office and has the 
same, if not better, features. Microsoft Office in fact lacks some features 
like PDF (Portable Document Format) support, compatibility with older versions 
of Microsoft Office, lack a vector drawing application, etc. Open Office gives 
you everything starting from a word processor, to presentation software to PDF 
generator. It is fully compatible with Microsoft Office -- so already existing 
data in those formats can be used. Don't you think it's the right time to save 
money and enhance efficiency of technological education in our country?

The above are just examples. There are many such software programs from which 
the students can benefit. We hope the university understands the urgency and 
the need. We would be happy to give the university any information/help that is 
needed. Currently, India has a wide range of volunteer GNU/Linux support 
groups, a list of which can be found at http://wikiwikiweb.de/LugsList

* (4) Computer Networks Subject Teaching: Ethreal, tcpdump, NS2 etc

We use the above mentioned tools for the teaching of Computer Networks and Data 
Communication subjects. There are a number of other GNU GPLed tools which can 
be used in a number of other labs for teaching and learning.

* (5) Content Management Systems: Drupal, PHP-Nuke etc

For building websites and info portals for students to make online learning 
possible. In the world of online forums, Free Software have a number of free 
options. You could well imagine the impact that the accelerated spread of such 
easily-reachable and usable tools would have, not just on the engineers of 
tomorrow, but on the wider Indian society as a whole.

We thank you for your patient hearing, and urge your reputed university to take 
speedy and decisive steps in this direction.

Thanking you, We remain, Yours sincerely,

If you think you've installed the deb, try dpkg -L mozilla-firefox to
see where the firefox binary is installed.

I usually put all the packages that I build from sources in the
/opt directory. i.e. I compile with --prefix=/opt/<prgname>. If I
want to remove a program I simply delete the subfolder from /opt/.
I'm not sure whether this is a good aproach. However, I think.,
with little effort you can construct the debs/rpms from the
sources.

Message-ID: <20050317061719.16866.qmail@web31002.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear Friends,

I have 10 systems with celeron 1.7/2.0 Ghz processors.
I installed FC2 on this systems. 

At booting time, When it changes to graphical mode,
there  is no display, the system hangs.

It is only possible to work in GUI, first i have to
boot the system in single usermode and then i have
switch to GUI using the command 'init 5'.

after this process there is no problem, it's working
fine.

This problem specifically only in celeron systems.

please give me a solution.

it's makes me great problem every morning.

Thankx in advance.

Babu. J

checkinstall is better than this approach. Instead of "make install",
you type "checkinstall" which will generate rpm/deb and install using
that rpm/deb.  No more or no less (commands).  To remove the package,
use your distro's package management tool/

This is a little anticlimactic.
But I'm withdrawing as a LDD volunteer.

Yes you can do!

Use GIMP.

Steps:
1. Open the file  you want to create.
2. Decrease the file size to 640x480
3. Go to Image > Mode > Indexed > there u use 8 or 16.
4. Save the file as filename.xpm.gz to /boot directory
5. reboot the machine 
6. go to grub prompt (I use grub) and type 

splashimage filename.xpm.gz

7. if u see ur image then it worked fine. if not u should decrease the
file size. remember the file size should be around 40-50k (this is
what i do)

I was looking for the kernel preemptive patch and other
patches(nitro,cko) and it seems that these patches are not supporting
this 2.6.x.y branch.

Yes, what you need is a KVM switch. But the one above looks like an
overkill - it has 32 ports and you have just 6 hosts. Unless you're
planning on a major expansion drive, I'd suggest you go for an 8 port
one.

Our FYP review is postponed to next week, so I have a big chance of
attending the LDD.  Perhaps, I could help in someway (which?) and also
I wish to participate in the events. :-)

Hi all,


The Carte Blanche website was not developed using Proprietary software. 

That particular page seems to be laid out in MS stuff.

We are taking immense care that we do use only free/open software.

Please remeber that this is organised primarily by students and that
too the website was developed by third and second year students.

And first year students have moved to GNU/Linux in overnights to
present at the Demos.

So kindly ignore one or two hitches...

We rather expect encouraging and supportive messages that will drive
us all the more to make this event a grand success!

Regards

Nawaz G,
Team Carte Blanche,

Yeah, i am using ssh. But, on some occassion, the boot up process is
interactive. So, i need to access the server during boot up process.
Anyway, i will have a look at kvm switch. Thankx a lot.

There are times when one needs console access to a server. Faulty
NICs, boot time problems, fubared sshd upgrade, reinstallation/upgrade
of OS etc. are only some of them.

Wrong route configuration, recent experience :). We are using 4 Port
KVM, it is fine.

Yes, but I appreciate the MIT guys for their interest in open
source/linux. I haven't seen anyone in my college (CEG) starting an
event like this. (except prashanth's work for gnu/linux workshop and
me screening revolution os). "IBM linux campus club" has never been
started in CEG. :-(

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0503181017550.9879-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

MIT-Chennai is organizing a 3 day National Level Technical Symposium
on FLOSS. Date: 18-20 Mar 2005. Visit: http://www.carteblanche.in/

One Day One Command :-
====================

rdate -- Get the time from Remote machine. 

Summary :

It connects to an Remote Time Server over a TCP/IP network, printing
the returned time and/or setting the system clock. The time in remote
server is maintained properly. So that all machines can get the time
from that server.

Example:

$ rdate -p 192.168.1.5 -- Print the time returned by the remote 
                          machine.

$ rdate -s remote.pc.com -- Set the system time to the time returned 
                        by the remote machine (Need Root permission).

$ rdate -u myserver -- Use UDP instead of TCP as the transport.

$ rdate -l myserver -- Use syslog to log errors and output (Useful 
                       when it is used in cron jobs).

NOTE:
1) Remote server should run the time service in port 37.
2) Firewall should not block port 37.

Read : man rdate

Greetings!

I have X up and running on GNU Hurd (Debian K8) on my
IBM T41 (ATI 7500)! Thanks to marco_g and bddebian
from ##hurd. Currently running Blackbox. Using rxvt
and xterm for terminals.

After the base installation, one needs to follow this:

http://hurd.gnufans.org/bin/view/Hurd/DebianX

to setup X. The touchpad is used for mouse control.
Have disabled loading "dri" and "speedo" in the
/etc/X11/XF86Config-4 file. Will check by enabling
them.

I shall put up a documentation soon.

Regards,

Subject: [Ilugc] command - Finding block size
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0503180135520.24311@chi.spunge.org>


Hi,

How to find the blocksize of any filesystem.
(Here I do not mean the total blocks that
should be occupied by the filesystem. I
want the size of each block(which is unique)
for any filesystem).

Though this group is dealing with linux,
if anyone  could tell the command to find
blocksize in hp-ux also, it would be helplful.

Thanks and Regards,
carti

It is defined in the filesystem header file.

ext2 for example:
http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/linux/ext2_fs.h
 
Some of the filesystems supported and used by ramdisk
are included in do_mounts_rd.c:
http://lxr.linux.no/source/init/do_mounts_rd.c

But, root can override it in BLKGETSIZE.

Hi,

Anybody staying near TTK road/CP Ramaswamy road, Alwerpet,

by 7 or so, in a car, and if you can give me a lift .. 
that will be pretty fine :) I will be carrying one machine.

Hi,

  On any HP-UX machines,

We can get file system informations as,
            1> bdf
            2> df
            3> /etc/fstab file
        
Or, simply  the SAM on 
         sam --> File system disks --> file system

The latter may provide you better result.

To: ubuntu-announce@lists.ubuntu.com



First Kubuntu Preview Released [17 March 2005]

The Kubuntu team is pleased to announce the preview of their first
release. Kubuntu is a new distribution using the solid base of Ubuntu
and the stunning KDE 3.4 desktop. This release follows the preview
release last week of Ubuntu 5.04. The final release of Kubuntu 5.04
will be on April 6th. The preview release includes both install CDs
and bootable Live CDs for three architectures.

There are CD images of the preview release in both Install and Live
CD format for Intel/x86, PowerPC and AMD64 here:

 http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/hoary/preview/

Kubuntu is a KGX distribution for the desktop or the server that
includes all of Ubuntu and comes with the latest KDE. We are part of
the Ubuntu community and use their infrastructure and support. Our
mission is to be the best KDE distribution available. As with Ubuntu
our releases will be supported for at least 18 months after release.

This preview release includes the latest KDE 3.4, released only
yesterday. KDE 3.4 brings many improvements including the excellent
KPDF reader, advanced groupware support in Kontact Personal
Information Management Suite and Kopete instant messenger plus HAL
support for removable media. We also include the feature packed amaroK
1.2 music and Kaffeine 1.5 video players.

Kubuntu would not be possible without the support of some major Free
Software contributors:

 * KDE for the best desktop environment there is.
 * Debian's KDE Packagers for sorting KDE the Debian way.
 * Ubuntu for their infrastructure and support.
 * Basse and Konqi for taking the time out of their busy schedules for
   an exclusive Kubuntu photo shoot.

You can find out more about Kubuntu and about this preview release on
our website, IRC channel (#kubuntu on freenode) and wiki. Our website
is currently at:

hey,

Keyloggers come in all shapes and sizes. Your keylogger may be a kenel 
module which means it will not obviously show up in a ps, and doing an 
lsmod is no guarantee you'll find it either (its quite trivial for a 
module to unlink itself from the modules list).

The keylogger may also work using shared library redirection, which means 
there will never be a separate program running, just the LD_PRELOAD env 
variable set to some evil library.

However, the previous two methods are usually used for tty snooping. X 
Keyloggers are usually (not always) implemented as separate programs. 
However, there may be a kernel module present which hides the process, so 
a clean ps listing is again no guarantee.

So, you can't really be sure :). But then, you're unlikely to have a 
keylogger running, unless your account or root on your machine was 
compromised. Why do you think that you have a keylogger running 
anyway ?

 IMO, it is going to be a question of momentum. Linux has generated so
 much of it that MS might not be able to catch up. Further, opening

Use squid + redirector do accomplish this easily.

Install squid and configure your own redirector as like as,

You can also use a meta tag in your index file at the document root of 
www.lugc1.comm. This will redirect all traffic from lugc1 ro lugc2

Ther are a many ways to get GNOME 2.10

1. Compile each and evry package by hand. :O
	This will take you around 6-8 hours provided you have all dependencies.

2. Get the binaries from yum/apt repositories.
	Ubuntu Hoary has 2.10 , doing a apt-get upgrade on any Debian based system will get you 	GNOME 2.10.

3. Use a automator scripts, Google for Garnome or jhbuild.
GARNOME: http://cipherfunk.org/garnome

visit the ILUGC wiki and see the talks section of GLV, there are slides available on how to setup GARNOME.

In your case you will need to modify the GArnome config file to get the packages from a folder rather than from the net.

Where this redirection should take place? is it in the web server side or in 
the client side?

1) Web server side:

If you are using the Apache server, you can add the following configuration 
in the the apache server configuration file of the www.lugc1.com

Redirect permanent / http://www.lugc2.com

and restart apache.

2) Client side:

If you are using squid as the proxy server, you can follow the link

Message-ID: <20050319131310.12029.qmail@web8510.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hello all,

I have installed MEPIS 06.2004 and have a conexant
modem. The problem is, MEPIS does not ship with the
kernel source, libc6-dev etc to help compile the modem
driver. As I can use apt from MEPIS, I do not know
what are the dependencies that are required to get my
driver compiled on my machine. Has anyone had similar
problems and corrected them. Basically, I am looking
for a list of deb's that I need to download (from a
different OS) so that I can compile my modem driver.

By the way, has anyone downloaded MEPIS 3.3 over at
Chennai?

Thanks in advance.
Shoban Jayaraj

Gnome 2.10 will not be put in the yum repos. apparently FC users will
have to wait until FC4 is released in June to experience Gnome 2.10 :(

Use Knoppix or some other livecd, mount the hard disk partition, chroot onto

Can you try the FC4 test1 repositories and let us know
if G2.10 is available in them.

AFAIK, FC4 will have G2.10, so I guess the test
release will have the packages.

Message-ID: <d1knbs$40f$1@sea.gmane.org>

Being some personal observations post-Carte Blanche 2005
---------------------------------------------------------

Carte Blanche (nee LDD) 2005 was a great success.  Like everything else
in this universe, it was not perfect, but still it was a success in a 
way quite different from the last LDD we had here.  Although the general
public did not turn up such large numbers as last time, I think CB has made
a big impact on the student community.  Carte Blanche will remain a
regular event on the MIT cultural calendar.  AFAIK, MIT and Symbiosis,
Pune (GNUnify) are the only two colleges in India to hold annual
festivals dedicated exclusively to Free Software.  Large companies working
in the Free Software space also appear to have taken notice of the
enthusiasm for Free Software in the student community here.

The students of MIT did an excellent job all round, ably supported as 
they were by several volunteers from this LUG.  Kudos to Ramasubramanian,
Shah Navas, and others of their great team at MIT.  Special mention must
be made of the sterling contribution of Raman, who, for the past two
weeks, has been training over 100 students, mostly from the first and 
second years, on various aspects of the GNU/Linux system, and on Free
Software in general.

I hope students from other colleges and schools in Chennai will be

One more thing, can different t-shirts be printed in bulk? I mean not
just firefox t-shirt, but gnome, slashdot, etc ... depending on the

Should say there was much more student participation this time
than any other LDD that I have seen. And  that's  encouraging.
The venue had  a professional look - with IBM, RedHat,Covansys
and Colabnet  supporting  the festival.  The CD  burning and 
distribution process was very well planned and streamlined this 
time.

Another change was the stalls that we had - looked like a real 
Expo! Some on  please put up the pics on the net. There was a 
food stall and ice cream outlet too along side other stalls :) 

Harish Krishnaswamy from Novel gave an inspiring talk, urging 
students to participate in the open  source movement.  Rightly 
said - it is not the government depts and competitors that big
companies are afraid  of, it is the students (working in garages
with gadgets? ;) that is their biggest concern! Students have
the power to topple just  any damn  company  making  inferior 
products.

Great work guys! And thanks for the 'GNU/Linux inside' stickers :)

I hope, you will use the latest destro. In GNOME/KDE, you have to
enable the local language keyboard layouts like Ta_IN, ... Once it is
enable, the KB layout will added to the active KB layout list.

At the run time, you can switch to all active KB layouts using some 
short cut keys (usually Shift+Shift OR Alt+Alt). 

Presently all KB layouts are based on Unicode/utf8. So if your appls
support Unicode, then you can type Tamil Char. Most of the latest
version support Unicode.

New GIMP supports this feature. :)

On behalf of ILUGC, I thank the organisers and volunteers of MIT for
successful conduct of Carte Blanche.

The 2 day demo attracted about 350 visitors. Out of them about 90 are
non-mit students/professionals.

The great improvement over previous demos are

1. Student volunteers- there were more than 40 student volunteers
    realy interested, capable and hardworking.

2.Stall organisation - It was professional

3.CD burning stall was up well organised.

Though I expected larger turnout following factors contributed to
reduced crowd.

1.Not enough publicity. An ad or small writeup in popular daily is a
must.

2.Banners,posters design should communicate better and easier way.

3.Clubbing of contests with demo, made students of other colleges, to
   forget about demo portion. Next time we better separte them.

4.Cricket- Killed our show. 


With the kind of student support we get at MIT, I am sure we can have
better show in future.

My thanks to ramasubramaniam and his team from MIT, with a request
--please pass on the enthusiam to your successor team.

Raman.P

I look back and ask myself, what have I learnt from
Carte Blanche 2005:

1. How to connect LCD with the parallel port on
GNU/Linux. Thanks to Anand Kumar Saha for the demo.

2. Got me started on Qt designing thanks to a visual
programming stall. 

3. Heard about the "AntiTrust" movie (MGM). Although
not distrubted freely, a must add to the collection
(The.Code.Linux, Revolution OS, ...) of movies that
one needs to watch.

http://www.mgm.com/title_title.do?title_star=ANTITRUS

4. Met ShivShankar and got information about Cascade
Systems, HP e-vectra systems, and other dealers with
trusted second-hand laptops, systems.

5. Got a copy of LLGP (Linux Live Gaming Project).
Didn't know of its existence earlier.

6. Got to know MIT students and made good friends.

7. Was able to get in touch with folks from Hindustan
engineering college, and Jaya engineering college.

8. Got to attend an inspiring talk by Harish
Krishnaswamy from Novell. 

9. Got to know that whenever I go to the food stall, I
know Anand Kumar Saha will be there.

The photos have come out well :) I shall upload them
soon.

Thanking MIT students for their valiant efforts,

There is no standard way. Redhat has a /etc/redhat-release file (from
the package redhat-release). Most other distros have something
similar.

[root@hercules root]# cat /etc/redhat-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES release 3 (Taroon Update 4)

Likewise, /etc/slackware-version for Slackware :-)

csb@phobos:~% cat /etc/slackware-version
Slackware 10.0.0

And /etc/gentoo-release for Gentoo!

csb@mynx:~% cat /etc/gentoo-release
Gentoo Base System version 1.4.16

Hi All,

Carte Blanche 2005 is kind of a dream come true.

But we do not want to rest on that. The event was a success but for
public turnout. But we learnt a lot from it. MITians got benefitted
immnsely. Very soon there will be a day when MITians will look at
other "proprietary" OS and say "Hey yaar something other than Linux
also exists".There is a wide spread awareness about Linux, Software
ethics and freedom of course. I myself was awestruck when I year guys
were explaing how to configure ip tables, firewall  and forget about
CSE, they were from instru, elex and other usually linux fearing
departments! Our heartfelt thanks to Raman P for making this happen,
for all the efforts he put up in inspiring and training these guys.
Our sincere thanks to all the ILUGC members who had spent their time
for CB. Please do not mind the hospitality, we could not do our best.


As mentioned by Raman we  are also thinking of seperating the
demos&lectures from the contests. Our Dean was quite impressed and
hopefully we could make this a four  day event - 2 for demos and 2 for
contests next year. Also he has recomended us to shift this event to
january and so a lot of school participation can be expected next
year.


We spent most of the time working out the sponsors and so we failed
marketing the event to public. And since we have established CB now,
many of the companies we approached have replied very positively to
support CB next year. So that should let our juns to market this event
on a grand scale to the students and public.

With warm regards,
Shah Navas G

  Is this any different from the stock Firefox-1.0-2 in Fedora Core 3 ?
For that matter, I like the anti-aliased font-rendering in stock
Mozilla-1.7.3-17, rebuilt from SRPM on Fedora Core 3, without any
Java Desktop dependencies.

Hi!

  See this link http://acharya.iitm.ac.in/   This might not be the
answer to Archana's question. Nevertheless a good site to take a look
at.

Subject: [Ilugc] Learning Linux
Message-ID: <20050322095734.7067.qmail@webmail29.rediffmail.com>

  
I am aged 50 
and am interested in Linux
for many years but unable to 
lay my hands as my office system
fully geared up with windows. But
I used to read abt linux regularly.

Recently I was having discussion
with my younger daughter studying
VIII Std. who is also showing interest
in learning Linux. 

First I would like to ask which institute
will be suitable for novice like us?
How much it will cost?
In case if  I buy a cheap computer
for my home , can I get a Linux system 
installed. Some of persons I knew in 
the hardware ( those who give supply 
to our office ) were not supportive of
Linux and frighten me !

I read that Mandrake or Suse is 
most suitable for Desktops.
If so where I can get a Box of it 
and at what price?

Whether we can learn linux directly
from the home system itself?
Whether Star office will also be included
because my daughter may have to prepare
so much for her classes. 
expecting the expert's opinions.

Thanks and regards

Hi,
To start with, you can run the live CD of distros like Knoppix to get
to know more. once u r comfortable with that because they give the
real picture of linux will be and  then try for the installation of
Fedora or mandrake which is very easy to use. Most distros contains
Office suites from sun microsystems named OpenOffice.org.  I recommend
mandrake linux for You!

Yes, it can be installed on most systems without trouble.

If you have specification of the computer you are going to
purchase,please post it,so that we can tell you right distribution to
suit it.

It is easy to install. If needed ILUGC volunteers will help you.

hi,
i tried to install the program qprint from tar.gz source. It asked for
another program ctangle to be installed.
i tried installed ctangle from tar.gz source , the make was ok but
make install gave the following error

mkdir /usr/local/bin/
mkdir: cannot create directory `/usr/local/bin/': File exists
make: [install] Error 1 (ignored)

inspite of this error, the ctangle program works.
next i tried to install the qprint, here is the output of each step

I bet they don't have the technical background or the
expertise. 

By evading with excuses, they are trying to avoid the
technical stuff :)

I would love to start an argument with them,
face-to-face.

Sure.

> > Whether Star office will also be included

I use OpenOffice to do all my documentation, and
presentations.

If I were you, I would do the following:

1. Use Knoppix LiveCD (that runs on the RAM) and get
used to the interface.

2. Try the different applications and software
packages. 

You can then partition your hard disk or get another
hard disk and then install GNU/Linux to hard disk.
Depending on where you stay, someone might may be able
to help you or you can simply ask for help in this
mailing list.

Have fun,

Again, it proves that Cricket , Entertainment,

than open their minds to see the bigger

We had Kargil during a Cricket world cup.
This is another Kargil only the intrusion by
terrorists is on our intellectual boundaries.

When are we going to wake up ?

Just a suggestion,

Should'nt the Makefile be using "install" rather than
"mkdir/chmod" ?

Atleast "install" seems to be the right way to go
about it.

Again, my suggestion doesnt help you in anyway.
Maybe yum/apt-get can help you here...

i wonder if the politicians who are trying to pass the bill know what wrong
in patenting the embedded software.....
they knew very little about technical thing, and some one should take the
initative of pointing this thing out, at least, the oppositions are there ,
to point this out and help in making necessary ammendments.
Is there anything we can do??
can we do this in any way?

The FSF people put up a good fight even when they are bound too loose. 
                                                                                 "Many people can only keep on fighting when they expect to win. I'm not

2) http://www.linux-india.org/index.pl?id=2203&isa=Category&op=show

One Day One Command :-
====================

ifconfig - CONFIGure a `network' InterFace

Summary :

Ifconfig is used to display/configure the kernel-resident network
interfaces. It is used at boot time to set up interfaces.

Example:

$ ifconfig -- Show info abt the active network interfaces like IP
              Address, MAC address, Subnet mask, and status.

$ ifconfig -a -- Show the status of active and inactive interfaces.

# ifconfig eth0 down -- Deactivate/Shutdown the eth0 interface.

# ifconfig eth0 up -- Activate the eth0 interface.

# ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up -- Activate an
                                   interface with specific IP address.

# ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.1.101 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255

# ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.1.102 netmask 255.255.255.0 -- Creating
       Alias for eth0, ie Assign more than one IP address to eth0.

# ifconfig eth0 arp -- Enable the use of the ARP protocol on eth0.

# ifconfig eth0 -arp -- Disable the use of the ARP protocol on eth0.

# ifconfig eth0 promisc -- Enable the promiscuous mode on eth0.

# ifconfig eth0 hw ether 09:08:07:06:05:04 -- Change eth0 MAC address.

# ifconfig eth0 mtu 1412 -- Change Max Transfer Unit of eth0.

Read : man ifconfig

NOTE:
1) Deactivate the interface before changing the IP/MAC.
2) Note down the original MAC, Otherwise Reboot needed 
   to get the original MAC Address.
3) Some command sequence needs super user permission.

Greetings!

This announcement is for students who are interested
in Linux device driver projects for their
thesis/project.

One, Jason Lovett (from Lexmark), had sent the
following link in linuxforum.com:

http://www.lexmark.com/US/products/info/linux/index.html

You won't be writing a printer device driver from
scratch, but, will be using Lexmarks' SDK. If you are
particularly interested in device driver programming
and you are new to it, this will be an interesting
project to begin with. You can also contribute in
testing.

Message-ID: <20050323080958.14864.qmail@web50206.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

We have been busy with Crescent and MIT the last
couple of weeks and hence we didn't conduct any GLV
sessions.

Toufeeq Hussain was suggesting that since students
will be heading for their exams, we can temporarily
stop the sessions and resume in June 2005. I do agree
with him. 

But, if you guyz want to have some sessions during the
summer, we can continue to do that too. Asokan Pichai
(Ma Foi Academy) has confirmed the availability of the
labs.

A summer break will also give us some time to prepare
for next semester's talks. Compared to Fall 2004 where
we did just two events (Asan and IIT-M), we have done
an _enormous_ amount of work this semester, Spring
2005. Hats off to the faculty, students, and
management of colleges, ILUGC members for their
support and time. We _will_ continue our work next
semester too.

Also, there is no hard-and-fast rule that only people
in the industry have to give lectures. Even students
who are interested in giving talks are welcome. In
fact, students will have more time to give talks than
industry folks.

What I have planned for next semester:
1. Careers with GNU/Linux, for colleges where I
haven't yet presented 
2. GNU/Linux Desktop, for colleges where I haven't yet
presented
3. Alliance VLSI CAD for Engineers
(ECE/EEE/Mechatronics)

My suggestion to volunteers would be to pick a topic
this summer, learn it (if new), prepare a presentation
and practice it. This way as soon as colleges give us
a green signal, we will be ready to go and do a guest
lecture/workshop. Usually, on Saturdays.

Let me know your views on the above.

Good luck to students for your exams.

Do we need such classification. What is point in knowing the gender,
after all they are also linux users.

Why can't we knock off this page?

Let us be professional, rising above petty things.

This page will be deleted, because

1. It is/will true that girls won't be interested in Linux
2. Many misinterpret it as "chauvinism"

I dont agree that "women arent interested in linux" as much as "a lot of 
them prefer to lurk" - and possibly "have better things to do than sit 
around on mailing lists, usenet, slashdot etc for most of the day" :)

Look for Abigail on comp.lang.perl.*, or Telsa Gwynne (Alan Cox's wife) 
on a whole bunch of lists .. just to pick two at random.

Agreed.
Lot's of ladies are are now taking up Development for FLOSS.

Debian as a few lady-debian-developer's.

http://planet.debian.org

Ayama(?) comes to mind, maintainer for lirc.

Telsa as srs pointed out is involved heavily with Gnome/Linux Bug squashing.

Then there is Eugenia, a BeOS hacker, who is an Editor on OSnews.org and a UI Specialist for GNOME and is the person incharge of http://gnomefiles.org .

Might look like nit picking, but instead of "Females in ILUGC", it 
would've been much palatable if named "Women in ILUGC"

Only problem I see (from seeing the same thing happen on livejournal, 
orkut etc) is that the people posting their names on that list / running 
a blog etc might start receiving badly spelled "hai, i want 2 b ur 
friend, will u marry me" type emails from random idiots ..

thats rather true..
that makes me think often to make my identity in lists/blogs similar
to that of a some boy...
but i dropped that idea, becas i wanted to be myself , and not having
someother name which isnt professional indeed

Hai

The linux ubuntu cd can be shipped to us from site:
http://shipit.ubuntulinux.org/
Register in the site
Enter the house address
Enter the no of cds u want  minimum (20) since
shipping cost for 1 and 20 doesnt make difference.
Lets give the cds to ur friends as an own copy and
lets spread linux.
There are live cds and cds for intel, amd and power

The antitrust movie can be downloaded using bittorrent

shall put a copy of the original images to a CD for
MIT students.

I don't have most of your names, but, if you guyz want
to move the pictures to the wiki site and add more
titles/subtitles, feel free to do so.

Regards,

K Shakthi

List admins, can we make the digest list read-only?

hi ,
i worked with FC2, with apache , mysql, php,
and all work preconfigered.. provided u choose those options while
installing , when u install fc2, in selecting packages , select all modules
for apache, like , module for php. module for mysql integration , same in
mysql, u need to choose module for php integataion....
and most of time , its preselected i think.....
but its really hassle free.....
but a work to remember is that.....
if u are reading old documentation, the apache directory is mentioned
elsewhere... but in fedora series.. its shifted to var/www/http or something
like that.

This is only a temporary posting. I will be moving all
my stuff to a domain, sometime soon. 

You have made an assumption that the pictures have to
be hosted at only one location. I already told you
that if you want to host it somewhere else you are
free to do that ... free as in freedom. Having data in
redundant servers helps too.

Sure Fedora Core 3 will be good if you do "yum update" regularly.
The only issue with Fedora is their MySQL version (its 3.23.xx) you have to
update manually to 4.x all other are latest (PHP4)

any distro that isnt bleeding edge will do really

using debian unstable, or ubuntu is bad (though with debian you might want to
see whether its worth running outdated packages when apache's added a lot of
good new stuff thats really usable in newer versions)

if he wants a rh variant, rh 7.3 + patches or better still rhel with a
purchased license

remember - he said he wanted it for a production server

Dear Members,
I am yet to find the right supplier whom i mentioned in my earlier
mail. I am  getting  my weekly off on the coming sunday which i
planned to visit tiruppur and finish off the deal. Regarding with the
price you have to give me couple of days more.  The  price would be as
quoted from the supplier+ shipping charges(tiruppur to chennai by
courier), if possible it can be given to our admins at lug in IIT(this
step is to avoid shipping charges for local delivery). already 21
users are there in the Lug wiki page. though the sizes vary from
person to person , lets make the color and logo of the t-shirt as
one.Making different colors for small quantum of orders will taxes us
some more penny extra :(. i am stepped out of chennai on 24 th on my
job schedule. I will update the much awaited price on 25th at the
earliest by evening.

Thanking you 

cheers

Can you please elaborate whose INDIVIDUAL interest is talked about here. 
Mr. Mallik, please do keep in mind that ILUGC is not a Non-Political list, 
atleast I havent seen the policy state that. If you are not interested, 
please keep off ...

I strongly object to this remark Mr. Suresh. Firstly, if you think no one 
in ILUGC is interested then the topic will die anyways. Secondly, the 
comment about people just discussing and not doing anything is absolule 
farce. It is not required that all should be active. One man can make a 
difference. Yes one man ! We were exactly the same way when the british 
ruled us, but did every one stop. One man made a difference.

Please feel free to voice your views but DONT ridicule the effort. The 
post was clear and take it as a news if you are not into discussing. Also 
I thought ILUGC was a free list where we would talk ALL about free 
software. This patents would effect free software and hence is a valid 
topic.

As far as personal slandering is concerned, all of us are very much 
capable, but it is just demaining ourselves. If required you can check me 
out some time.

Midhun.

I must put my remarks in context

There's two ways to deal with the situation

1. Do something about it - the actual FSF people (Eben Moglen etc), EPIC, EFF
etc are doing good work as are a dozen other orgs I can think of

2. Post long emails to /. and $linux_list with griping and criticism about the
bill and discuss it to death.

#1 is useful. #2 is a waste of time

Hi,

I am using FC3 and I would go with it, being the latest with the security 
patches done and would update it.

No one posted long emails here not did the discussion take off. All I can 
see is some one posting a topic and a small set bombarding him. Now are 
you telling me that it was a pre-emptive strike ? Even then, how do you 
justify the act of yours. I am talking here about the way the post has 
been received. I am not discussing the positive or the negative aspects of 
long discussions here. All I am asking is that members learn how to 
receive a post and also make their point in a soft manner.

There was nothing in the post which needed such an aggressive remark. 
Thats is all the point I am trying to make here.

Midhun.

Sure NO distro is secure or production level unless you make it as. A
simple CAD (Ctrl+Alt+Del) will reset a production RHEL if you have not
disabled it in inittab. Dear Sridhar  dont start unnecessary debate,
the question is all about choosing a fedora release. So try to provide
a solution for what he (osk) wants.

Production servers (rack optimised) are usually headless.

Production servers are also -usually- under strict access control.

Even if you disable C-A-D, there usually are other ways - like a power
switch, a power cable etc. that can be fiddled with to cause a
production outage. A decent datacenter will have protection against
all these.

Well, this has been going on here, and in various other linux lists / /. 
type forums, for ages now.

All the pontificating, all the calls for freedom, havent helped one bit

No point in starting the discussion again I guess .. I was unusually 
stressed out yesterday with work related pressures.  If I hurt your 
feelings, sorry. But my opinions on discussing software patents here 
tend to stand. There's nothing that the average reader of this list 
(engg students? people working as entry level programmers / middle 
management at one corporate or another?) can do a single thing about it ..

As much as I don't want to believe in srs's words, I have to agree.

"If you can't do anything about it, don't talk about it."

But, even if we want to do anything about it, what can we do?
Most of us have the "regular" 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM jobs.And those jobs are certainly not the right place to advocate the above mentioned thoughts.

I guess the common software-engineer just learns to compromise on these priciples, though that's the worst thing to do in such a situation.

Well, guys. Neat.  No suggestions from me hereafter. Go ahead and use
_whatever_  you feel like. It's your decision I know, but you also ask
others .. no flames .. just stop this thread.  I have learnt something

Why not go for RH Enterprise linux ? More often than not, the price 
of it will be a  fraction of the expenditure on the  service(s) you 
are running on production.

We have a Webmethods development environment setup on RH AS and its

A bit of  history on this - when we  had to choose a Linux distro
to host the Webmethods environment, we refered to Webmethods tech
pages. They recommened and support only certain versions of certain 
distros  and  RedHat Advanced Server was one of them. We went for 
this.

So  do  refer  the  pages of  the s/w you  are planning to run on

Making unsubstantiated overly broad generalizations and irrelevant
smart-aleck recommendations (recall that www.python.org
'recommendation' on the VB compiler for Linux thread ?) are unlikely
to be useful whether sent in private or public ;-)

Keeping your missionary zeal in check - now *that* would be very helpful :-)

Toufeeq, we could be happy that the  Patents (Amendment)  Bill, 2005, 
was  passed in  the  Parliament, after
dropping  clauses  3(k)  and  3(ka)  relating  to  computer  programs, 
restoring the  status quo.  Computer programs remain  outside the 
purview of patentability.   There is an official statement to that 
effect at http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=8096  Not many 
newspapers reported this matter correctly.

Programmers in Europe who maintain ffii.org supported the campaign 
organised by FSF India against the patentability introduced for 
"embedded software".  If they could spare some time, we most certainly 
can.  

Please never compromise on principles - it will reflect on what we 
write, be it posts or programs  :)

  Pure software idea patents were out of the ambit of the proposed
amendment, even in its original form. However, it sought to fallaciously
introduce the notion of two classes of software; software which was
either applicable to industry or bundled with hardware - which was
patentable, and all other software (presumably inapplicable to industry
and/or not bundled with hardware), which was not patentable.

  My observation is that this distinction is fallacious on both
grounds - *all* software in binary form can function only in 
conjunction with some kind of computer hardware, so the manner
in which it is bundled is irrelevant, whether with or without
the associated hardware. Secondly, virtually all software is
applicable to some kind of industry or the other - for instance,
computer games are applicable to the entertainment industry,
and so on. In particular, it would have allowed patents on
frivolous and trivial programs, as long as it was applicable
to industry, but disallowed patents on important and non-trivial
ideas, if they were not applicable to industry.

  It is a good thing that the proposed amendment was withdrawn -
it had legal loopholes that would have kept the legal system
busy for centuries. *That* was the real reason for the
amendment - generating an additional revenue stream for lawyers
by milking it from a profitable industry which has hitherto
not had a history of significant litigation in India, by
introducing ambiguity which is capable of subjective inter-
pretation.

(Consider this: in all countries with a uniform civil code with
clear rules regarding property ownership, succession, etc., there
are hardly any cases pending in the courts pertaining to these
matters. In India, which has huge ambiguities in these matters,
there are family disputes that are often over half-century old
that are pending in the courts. Simple, unambiguous legislation
is always a *huge* win for society; by contrast, ambiguous laws
benefit a very small group of people who are paid well to interpret
those laws.)

BTW, process patents are legal but equally stupid for many same reasons 
we reject "software patents".  But many won't notice it and
hopefully it will keep the PO and connected "services" sector busy 
until, probably farmers kick the wto and allied "systems" out of here.

That will be displayed when the script does 'cat /etc/redhat-release'

Software patents - fine

But the rest of your pointless rants about the WTO are shared by, perhaps,
those "farmer associations" that go around throwing rocks through McDonalds
windows.

Communism and "anti-people capitalism" etc went out of the window around
the world after the collapse of the USSR and Eastern Europe - I guess its
time Kerala and West Bengal wake up to some realities rather than spend
their time fulminating against the WTO and organizing bandhs 

OK this is getting way too political for a linux list, I'm done discussing
it

I use linux because it is a technically good OS and because i like the
community development model. Not because of license advocacy

yep. people sometimes forget the other-than-the-usual usage of these

a finer analysis can be  done with 'traceroute',  where one can know

Does'nt a "uname -o" throw up "GNU/Linux" on every
Linux Distro ?

Atleast I see that on RedHat and Debian.

That was what I meant too. It is not Redhat/GNU/Linux. It is Redhat

  Well, in this case (patents) they did the right thing for (maybe)
the wrong reasons. Perhaps if we did a better job informing people of
all categories of the facts, they'd be better equipped to form their
own opinions and take the appropriate decisions. Maybe the next time
this comes around, they'll do the right thing for the correct reasons.

That's the GNU fanatics working overtime. That info is hardcoded into
the uname binary (during its build process). How is this done? Via the
configure script. How is the configure script generated? Using

Justice Ayyangar Committee suggested several important reforms that led 
to the bare minimum patent law possible in 1970,  liberating the local 
industries.  Now, WTO forces changes that will take us back to pre 1970 
days.  Justice Krishna Iyer has written umpteen articles against this 
"Gattastrophe".  The Seeds Ordinance that came along with the Patents 
Ordinance, largely went unnoticed.  Looks like they are testing the 
waters for terminator seeds. We have FSF and others to campaign against 
"software patents" but what about poor things like seeds?    Not many so 
far.  To be on the safer side, Linux programmers may better learn about  
hunting GNUs or picking APPLEs from trees, which may help in future at 
lunch time ;)

The CPI(M) realizes and understands the dangers of software patents.

A CPI(M) leader was quoted to have said that software patents are a
threat to open source software. I don't remember the website.

Quoting from http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/1281/
Free software guru(RMS) meets CPI-M leader

Quoting from http://pd.cpim.org/2005/0130/01302005_snd.htm
Richard Stallman, the co-developer of the GNU-Linux operating system and
proponent of Free Software says, ?Software patents are patents which
cover software ideas, ideas which you would use in developing software.
That is what makes them a dangerous obstacle to all software
development.?

Message-ID: <ed2d3c00050324225467bb2849@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Members,

Warm greetings,The price of  T-shirt varies on the quality.
For a export quality t-shirts i got the quotation for 100 t-shirts as
follows.(below 100 the supplier is finding difficult to give it in the
prices quoted beneath)

Quality A
Desc: Export quality,150 GSM,Ideal for Summer wearing
Price/T-shirt:  95 Rupees (Ninety five rupees only)
Sizes : Indian sizes with export quality finish(
S-small,L-large,XL-Xtra Large ,XXL Xtra Xtra Large)
Specification: Sizes for S L XL XXL will be furnished with the height
and chest size in CM once i receive the spec.Spec yet to  receive
regarding the sample.
Additonal expense: total Courier charges/100 for a single t-shirt

Quality B
Desc: B grade quality,140 GSM
Price/T-shirt  85 Rupees.(eighty five rupees only)
Sizes : Indian sizes with second quality finish(
S-small,L-large,XL-Xtra Large ,XXL Xtra Xtra Large)
Specification: Sizes for S L XL XXL will be furnished with the height
and chest size in CM once i receive the spec.Spec yet to  receive
regarding the sample.
Additional expense: total Courier charges/100 for a single t-shirt



I am yet to receive the spec of the  t-shirt and the sample of the
cloth. depending on the quality of the cloth we can move in the
direction. I plan to put a portal for this purpose so that we can move
the entire 100 pieces of t-shirts.further we can think on catering the
future  needs with this online portal.I plan to put Zencart software (
http://www.zencart.com ) which is a LAMP software and free to
use.apart from t-shirts,we can do various other products like coffee
mug where OSS brands can be etched.

In this portal we can put the entire distribution of linux and oss in
cd format which can be mailed to the members on request. the price
pattern will be Rs25/cd (means Rs11 for moser bear or quality CD +EB
charges +Rent on permises + IT facility + the labour cost) just to
cover the break even, postal/courier and Local taxes charges will be
extra.further we can maintain the wishlist of the members/customers.

Since our community believes in open source, i would like to disclose
the source from where i am getting the quote. ;)

yes, in uname.c, one finds:

  if (toprint & PRINT_OPERATING_SYSTEM)
    print_element (HOST_OPERATING_SYSTEM);

The 'HOST_OPERATING_SYSTEM' gets defined during macro processing
and gets embedded in uname when compiling.

But that makes me ask - if that is the case, if I build uname in 
a RH box and then transfer it to a system running HURD and execute
it, what  will  it  show ?  GNU/Linux or GNU ? (I don't know if 
programs compiled on linux can run out of the box on HURD)
And if above is the case, then uname shows OS of the system on which
it was compiled, not of the system on which it is being executed!

A few queries:

trademarked logo on these t-shirts ?

** Is it possible to get t-shirts with other logos ? 
Ex: tux, fedora,debian swirl etc...

Have you considered cafepress.com
Instead of opening your own E-com store why not join
an international chain of stores setup to help small
clothing/merchandise vendors.

more info here: http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/sell/

One concern is the price, as the stuff is traded in
dollars, but you will have an international market and
you need'nt worry about the
sales/distribution/transport as all that is taken care
off.

http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy.html

a partial content of that is 

Aims

The aim of this trademark policy is to balance two requirements.

Requirement 1: we need to keep enough control over our trademarks to
make sure they are a sign of quality and safety. It needs to be
impossible, for example, for someone to release a product called
'Firefox' that has added spyware. We want to avoid someone building a
highly-optimized but unstable build and passing it off as official.

Requirement 2: we need to allow community members, Linux distributions
and companies we work with to label their products as Firefox, without
causing them either practical or legal difficulties.


Kindly read the full url and support me with any details if you find
on voilation .

Now ,  the success of  any web portal is that the manner in which it
is marketed.
I am going to club human forces to market this model. As i am a
service guy , i will impart the relevance of having a web shop for the
manufactures invariable of their financial status.

Think of a revenue from google adsense, to whom it goes? the cafepress
or the manufacturer. The idea is to cut the middle man commission and
give the benefit to
the consumer. I read and heard various article  that purchases from
webstore carries less price than the physical store elsewhere in
abroad.Relatively if you see here, there is no talk about webstore,
the market is lying in the hands of middle men.

Many of the webstore  developed here suffers failure because of 
development issues/marketing will. if you take a webstore
http://www.vegvan.com  which is primarily developed to support supply
of vegetables for chennai residents. but to my knowledge this is
suffered a blow  by the Tamil nadu vanigar sangham who is headed by
Mr. Vellaiyan a local person who openly declared  against the use of
computers.Let in the future we have direct converstion be there 
between the consumer and the manufacturer and no third party.

A small merchant can setup a web shop at a cost of Rs.3500 (domain
name + webspace of 100 mb) plus Rs 1500 for  service fees for  a
service person ( in this case for myself ;) ).
going behind any worthy webstore may have their own positive points
but still any manufacture needs their own product details stored in
their own portal.

If you have a laser printer like a hp laserjet, you can buy tshirt transfer
paper, print the image onto it and then hire one of the isthiri-walla guys
to just place the transfer paper flat on the tshirt and iron it on with a
hot iron. Just buy blank white tshirts from the tirupur people.

about the payment site - shopping cart is easy, but how about the backend
part - payment processing?  You need access to a payment gateway or
something like icici paydirect.

if there's demand for 100-150 tshirts get it printed at tirupur - all with one
logo 100-150 shirts that is

if someone wants firefox, another guy wants a debian or gnu logo, another guy
wants tux etc best is to tell him to buy blank shirt, give him an emailed high
res png or .ai file (find what format is needed) with the image, give him the
address of the nearest konica or other tshirt printer equipped photo shop

It is available from Rawhide. Add:

[rawhide]
name=Fedora Rawhide
baseurl=ftp://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/development/i386/Fedora/RPMS

and try. Not sure if Yum is capable of handling ftp: URLs.

Workshop on "TRIPS Treaty and Computer Programs"at UoM

The Department of Legal Studies, University of Madras, is organising a
workshop on  "TRIPS Treaty and Computer Programs", that is tentatively
scheduled  for 8th  April, 2005  (Friday).   The one  day workshop  is
intended as  an "out-reach  programme" for software  professionals and
students specialising in international law.

The  legal aspects  of Computer  Programs  are governed  by the  TRIPS
Treaty.   Globalisation, governance, and  almost every  human activity
hinges upon Computer Programs and its legal setting. The workshop will
discuss the  true nature  of computer programs,  and the  character of
rights surrounding them.  The harm caused by mis-application of patent
law  to cover computer  programs in  some member  states of  the TRIPS
Treaty, notably US  and Japan, and the possible  remedies against such
practices, will also be analysed threadbare.

If you  would be  interested in participating  in the  workshop, could
make a  sponsorship, or have  suggestions to make, please  write about
it to ramanraj.k@gmail.com and ambrose@unom.ac.in

Seems to be an attack. secure your sshd server by using tcp wrappers
(hosts.allow & hosts.deny files) or iptables.

The Department of Legal Studies, University of Madras, is organising
an one day workshop on "TRIPS Treaty and Computer Programs", that is
tentatively scheduled for 8th April, 2005 (Friday).

One Day One Command :-
====================

showkey -- Examine the codes sent by the keyboard

Summary :

showkey prints to standard output either the scan codes or the keycode
or the `ascii' code of each key pressed. It can be used to check the 
keyboard driver and key mappings.

Example:

$ showkey -- Show the interpreted keycode.

$ showkey -k -- Same as above (Default Option).

$ showkey -s -- Show the raw scan-codes of the keys.

$ showkey -a -- Show the Decimal/Octal/Hex values of the keys.

Note:
If Showkey is in keycode/scancode mode, then you have to wait 10 
Sec to exit. In Ascii mode, Press Ctrl+D to exit.

Read: man showkey

When you do a cross compile, the $host_os would be set to the OS
for which you are cross-compiling.

Nope., not possible (atleast till now). They are not binary
compatible.

Hi,

I just forget to ask about this in my previous mail.
How do I make sure that the one that tried to crack
into my machine, didnt do anything terrible, like
install a Trojan horse or something or steal my e-mail
password which i stored using firefox. Please help to
retrieve the whole mail onca again to have a look at
it, bcoz if I type mail command it says "At Eof". 

Thx in advance.

Mahesh.

Hi,

Thanks a lot. Thanks for making sure that its not a
crack attempt. I was really worried. Anyway, how to
install the firewall. I am not sure whether I selected
the firewall during my FC3 installation. How to make
sure it is installed? If not how do I install it?

Thanks,
Mahesh.

Hi,

When I was googling about the sshd authentication
failure , I came across this site which shows output
similar to one which my log shows which I sent in my
previous mail. Please clarify since this web page
claims such kind of output as brute force attack.

It is a brute-force attack. But let me ask you a few questions.

1. Why is this server on the internet in the first place?
2. Why is its ssh port open on the internet?
3. Do you have a separate firewall protecting this and other servers?

Once you answer these questions, we can proceed with protecting your network.

Hi,

I dont what this server is meant for. Also I couldnt
figure a way out as to how i can stop this server. I
dont know why that port is open, b'coz I am not aware
of the things like open ports and such. Now when I
googled, I found that iptables is a firewall and I can
use it. Eventhough I am not sure about it I started
that and it is on now. I didnt specify any rules! Iam
still googling to find help to specify rules.

Please help me figure out whether my machine was
compromised. If so how do I make sure that nothing 
wrong has happened. 

Thanks,
Mahesh.

Yes, I get a very uneasy feeling too. Does RMS know what he is letting
himself in for ? He is more of the western anarchist anti-big company
, anti-big government type which our desi leftist crowd doesn't grok
very well.  They automatically assume that he is anti western  when
they hear his rants.

I once heard a very well known Open source personality and founder of
a very successful open source project ( not a "free software" guy ) 
saying that some members of FSF India members were members of the
communist party. At that time I thought he was talking through his hat
- this link makes me rethink.

 They don't seem to support linux. The  bittorrent client bitlord is
.exe file that works only with win series. Can somebody point to a
client that has linux support for the same movie.

Message-ID: <73a10bbf0503270218278c738f@mail.gmail.com>

hi frndz,
I am trying to configure in.ftpd daemon to allow anonymous login. The
man page told me that a user by the name ftp must exist. I did as
given in the man page, but anonymous login was not enabled.
So here i hv a few doubts, which were not cleared in the manual:
1. Must there be any specific uid for the uset 'ftp'?

2. User 'ftp' must belong to which group? Should i create a new group
'ftp'? Is there any specific gid for it?

3. Must i set a password for the user 'ftp'?

there is usually a default "ftp" user defined in most standard linux /
unix distributions.

it has no privileges or shell. no password either

ftp is the uid/gid the ftp daemon runs under, typically - whether or not
you configure your ftp daemon to allow anonymous ftp access is another
matter altogether.

then the next step is carefully controlling anon ftp downloads, and
restricting anon ftp uploads.

i would suggest using a security oriented ftp daemon such as vsftpd,
that'll let you do this quite easily.

-srs

well, on knoppix on hd, there is no default ftp user.

i just created an ftp user, like a normal user, but it doesn't allow anon ftp.

While downloading a torrent file it doesnt matter which client you
use. You could install the linux version of "BitTornado" which is
available at http://bittornado.com/download.html Watch out for the
dependencies.

as i said the ftp user is for your ftpd to run as
next step is to actually configure it to accept anon ftp
read the manual / docs of whichever ftpd you are installing

linux friendly bband connection. I was able to set it up in a fraction
of seconds. I would like to save the IPTabs rules permanently. I have
used all the commands from

service iptables save to

The /etc/sysonfig/iptables file reflects the changes made.

But, once i restart my system, the old rules are only being applied.
How to make these rules permanent. I am using IPTabs on a FC3 box.

Dear All,

Can anybody elucidate the difference between Transport Layer and Data Link 
layer funtionality wise.

As per reference books,

the transport layer
"guarantees that the receiver gets the data exactly as it was sent"

and the Data link layer is mentioned
"The reliable delivery of data across the underlying physical network is 
handled by the Data Link Layer"

Any pointers / links / suggestions which would clear this doubt much 
appreciated.

Thanks

Message-ID: <48c7428d050327232045b53f2b@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends 

     We have a few test machines which we have reserved for trying out
various Linux variants. We can install only thru PXE /Network install
since CRDOM's are not allowed inside campus.

 Every other day we format and install a new flavor, although this
method works fine (Booting thru PXE and then doing a network install)
the problem comes when I start my PXE service since this will
interfere with some other service used for installing windows over the
network.

 Everytime I start my pxe service I am asked to stop it since people
elsewhere are not able to install windows .

Is there some way by which I can modify my PXE so that I gives an
option of booting /installing either windows or Linux

In other words a single server would handle the startup using PXE and
give the option to select which system I would like to install.
 
Is it possible to do such a thing ? 

Regards
Kannan

In short, transport layer ensures reliability of data
transfer w.r.t. the application, software-related. The
data link layer ensures data transfer w.r.t. to the
physical medium, hardware-related.

How? Which distro are you using?

System.map is useful if you do device driver/kernel
programming. Few applications like dosemu, lsof use
it.

Hi all,
    The advice I got on a previous post in optimising kernel is to
disable debugging support. So I understand that disabling debugging
support will boost performance of applications.
    If so which distros compile packages with debugging support turned
off ?. Is any distro is there ?. It is irrespective of free/commercial
distros.

hi

transport layer is end to end and data link layer is point to point.
data link layer takes care of reliable delivery of data to the next
hop and transport layer deals with reliable delivery of data to the
destination.

====================

locate -- Quick search for files

Summary :

Locate provides a secure way to index and quickly search for files on
your system. The index database to make searching faster and file
permissions and ownership info will give the security.

Example:

$ locate myfile -- Locate myfile in the DB and Print the path.

$ locate -i MyFile -- Same as above. But Case insensitive.

$ locate -q myfile -- Run in Quiet Mode.

$ locate -n 10 myfile -- Limit the no. of results shown to 10.

# locate -U mydir -o myDB -- Create index DB starting at path mydir 
                             and store the index file in myDB.

Read: man locate

Does it?

[root@snape root]# cp /dev/null /var/lib/slocate/slocate.db
[root@snape root]# time /etc/cron.daily/slocate.cron

real    0m1.084s

I'm sure this does not make any difference. If the slocate cron causes
system slowdown, something else is wrong in your system. I run slocate
on hundreds of thousands of files stored on HP StorageWorks arrays
(840 GB per array, 3 arrays per server) and it has never caused any
problem for me.

In theory, nope. Any OS that is going to be used by an "end user" and 
have more than say, 50% of the desktop market share is a potential host 
for virus/worm/trojans. The reason that a lot of UNIX (and clone OSes) 
had not many virus/worm/trojans was because, the UNIX user tends to 
"know" more about the system than a typical desktop/home user. Also, 
most crackers write viruses/trojans/worms targetting the desktop 
platform.

Its not that Solaris 10 as an OS is "highly" secure. Its just that a
Solaris user/administrator would be well-informed like every other
 sane UNIX administrator and that the crackers aren't trying too hard.

Also note that Solaris 10 is a brand new OS, which means, a potential 
cracker will wait for some more time till its being widely deployed, and
work underground collecting a list of bugs/exploits during this time.

On Fedora you can do "service iptables save" (without quotes) this
will make your configuration persistant.

Message-ID: <42485503.301@email.com>

Folks:

I have registered for BSNL by filling out their online form.  I had a 
few questions on what to expect:

1. The form does not allow me to specify that I want an Ethernet modem.
    Should I expect them to ask later?

2. Since the modem will plug into a phone line, does the modem feature a
    phone outlet so that I can still attach my phone?  Or would I need to
    separately purchase a splitter?

3. Does BSNL supply filters with the modem?  (A filter is a small device
    attached to those phone lines that are not being used for DSL.  It
    filters out high frequency DSL signals so that the voice lines that
    may be used simultaneously do not get affected.)  How many filters
    are included?

I plan to use the service with FC3.  FC3 has a lot of updates.  I hope 
the 1GB plan will suffice.

I believe since you have applied before March'31,
you'll get unlimited data transfer until June 30.

Yes so please dont waste other peoples' times here raking up old license

There are other lists for that, where license discussions would be to

I am not to start a flame war. As long as you people call this list a
GNU/Linux list the site should be designed using free software and it
is not followed. May be there are people who dont know about this.
    Best way to defeat patents is not to use pateneted products.

Who told that GIF can be created only with patented products?? GIMP
can be used to create GIF Images. in that case GIMP is a open source
Product which produces the GIF images.

we are not using any Patented Image Processing software. We just apply
the logic and write code of our own and generate the GIF Format
images. GIMP is doing that.

Gif's are now patent-free see burnallgifs.org. However, it is better
to use png to encourage anti-patent movement.

chennailug.org website requires facelift. Whoever has time, instead

This can be done in many modern processors, but in processor specific
ways.

Qutoring from chapter 7 of Linux Device Drivers,
"The most renowned counter register is the TSC (timestamp counter),
introduced in x86 processors with the Pentium and present in all CPU
designs ever since--including the x86_64 platform. It is a 64-bit
register that counts CPU clock cycles; it can be read from both kernel
space and user space.

After including <asm/msr.h> (an x86-specific header whose name stands
for "machine-specific registers"), you can use one of these macros:

      rdtsc(low32,high32);
      rdtscl(low32);
      rdtscll(var64);

The first macro atomically reads the 64-bit value into two 32-bit
variables; the next one ("read low half") reads the low half of the
register into a 32-bit variable, discarding the high half; the last
reads the 64-bit value into a long long variable, hence, the name. All
of these macros store values into their arguments."

Needs more info. Ethertype 0x8808 is flow control, which is typically
used by switches. What were you doing (the two MAC addresses you have
do not appear to be listed in any MAC address->vendor mapping)?

It could be a worm, it could be a DoS attack, it could be a faulty NIC
- anything so far.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0503301317220.5591-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

A Team of GLUG-Trichy Guys have developed a GTK-Binding for 
OCTAVE. Recently Version 0.3 is released. For more info
http://octave-gtk.sourceforge.net/.

One Day One Command :-
====================

nameif -- NAME network InterFaces based on MAC addresses.

Summary :

nameif is used to rename the network interfaces based on MAC
addresses. It is useful, when you have more then one network 
interfaces/cards & you want to specify the name (eth0, .. ) 
for each interfaces. 

Example:

# nameif -- Read the config info from /etc/mactab file.

# nameif -s -- Same as above. But error messages goto the syslog.

# nameif -s eth0 00:0D:87:77:74:5C -- Name the card with specified MAC 
                                      as eth0 and error goto syslog.

Note: 

1. Nameif should be run before the interface is up, 
   otherwise it'll fail.
2. Format of the /etc/mactab file:-
   # Comments
   eth0 00:0D:87:77:74:5B
   eth1 00:0D:87:78:7D:6B

Seems like someone traceroute'd to your server and then sombody else
tried to open a connection to an MS-SQL server - which didn't happen,
since you don't have an MS-SQL server I guess :)

Curious things:

1. The UDP packets could be a port scan, since they start very close
from 1024. All UDP traceroute programs I know use ports beyond 33000
or something.

2. Another reason to suspect portscan - the UDP packets are too big
(Unix traceroute uses 30 byte-packets, here I see 483-byte packets).

3. The UDP TTL too is interesting - seems like an odd TCP/IP stack at
the remote end, or custom made packets. You could try traceroute'ing
the other way and compare TTLs.

How do you know? Have you taken any course there? Who are the faculty?
What are their profiles/backgrounds/experience? Are you affiliated
with this academy?

To the OP: Do NOT throw away money. The best Linux training you can
get is Linux itself.

Hello!!!

In windows i used to run ScanDisk, Disk Defragmenter, Anti virus
regularly. In Linux as far i know... the file system (I use reiserFS)
does not need defragmentation. Also because it is a journalised FS...
i dont need to run fsck manually. and that There are no viruses for
linux so there is no need for running anti virus programs.

So does this mean that there are no system maintenance programs that i
have to run on my Desktop PC running Linux?

Subject: [Ilugc] Airtel DSl modem(New model) problem
Message-ID: <d2elnv$djv$1@sea.gmane.org>

Hi all

I am using Aitel DSL connection on fc3.

I am unable to setup the modem.

Trouble is it is NOT the tera-100U modem for which
a manual is available at Ilugc wiki..

i have installed the eciadsl drivers and i am able to
go online and browse in the tera-100u modem(borrowed from friend).

They(airtel) have given me a modem called "conexant accessrunner" modem.

The tera-100u modem seems to be replaced by this model for the past 3 
months.


when i do eciadsl-probe-device and the modem is not initialised it is 
supposed to show some thing
similar to

  ? (067b:2303)

since the firmware has not been loaded..

but what i get is

ADSL USB MODEM / - (0572:CB00)

even in the first time(un-initialised modem ,  no LEDs on)

eciadsl-probe-synch says

can't set interface 0 to use alt setting 4

and fails..


why is it being detected before probing...

Has anybody had any success in this new model modem in linux...

I am able to go online with the older model without any trouble..

Pls help..

Thanks.

QUICK UPDATE:

Dear members,
I asked for the second sample with my supplier.I am looking for 
Thickpick material(as i am told that it is the same material used by
polo shirts).I have queried with mozilla for licensing issues for
which reply is expected anytime. Kindly go through the specs on sizes
mentioned in our wiki page. Kindly update the sizes, few entries are
without sizes. I am planning the website www.rscomptech.org/STORES
just for the sake of holding the mailing address and some of us may
have few difficulty in giving addresses in open forum.The site will be
opened on 1st of april 2005(certainly not a april fool joke ;). The
privacy policy of this portal will be upholded strongly with highest
professionalism which means information will not be misused,leaked or
traded in any manner.Licensing issue is sought with mozilla after
reading the entire content of the trademark policies.

Further this is not a commercial operation and i kindly ask you to
order as per to your requirement, taking care the order list is not
flooded in any manner away from the actual requirement. Since i am
sending the t-shirts by VPP, kindly take personal care to honour the
parcel.The parcel is expected to reach you by between 6th to 10 of
april 2005.

Cheers

Guys  i am sorry, There is a sad ending to this firefox story. 


Hi Thyagarajan,

The trademark policy says (or should say) that you can only make 
t-shirts with our logo on if no money changes hands.

Our concern is that we want to prevent t-shirts being made and 
distributed that are not of high quality. That's why the t-shirts we 
sell are expensive - because we use good quality materials.

So, unless you are giving the t-shirts away, I'm afraid what you are 
doing is in violation of the policy.

Gerv.

Hi, 

We are not exactly a GNU/Linux list or affliate with them in anyway.  But
IMO, we dont lose anything in switching to PNG.  Its a lot more "cleaner"
and certainly is one way we can contribute to the anti-patent movement.  So
why not just co-operate with Antony Paul and hand him over the work of
cleaning our website of the gif files?  He said he has a lot of free time
and IIRC, he is interested in doing that.

What's everyone's opinion on this?

This is probably not the answer you're looking for but why don't you ask
them for an ethernet modem?
I'm running FC3 on an Airtel DSL connection and had zero problems
getting the ethernet modem up and running. (In fact, from install to
connect, it took about 10 minutes)

hi, 
   I am not affiliated to lynusacademy in anyway, nor I have taken any
course from them. I was just interacting with the lynsacademy staff at
MIT and found that they know what they are saying, they are not
bookworms. And the Synopsis of course materials are of high standard.
What I have said is my personal views. 

Cheers
senthilkumar 

Note : Not every one can learn by themself, it varies from person to
person. To open the door initially we need to give some bit of force, I
feel some person might have that force, but others might not have. I
feel for others this type of training centers will be door opening.

what do you mean by "ethernet modem"

The modem which is given to me is an USB DSL modem
Model seems to be "Beetel 100 CX".

This seems to be the only modem they are providing now.

Is there any other way to get a modem from the market
that suits both linux and airtel fine...

do you mean a router by ethernet modem ? .....

Thanks..

Dear Gerv,

Probably you can supply t-shirts either on discounted or as a gift to our
members who require that. Our idea is to put a campaign on Open source
software model.Honestly speaking i am unable to figure out with price
barrier how did you land up on the quality. I am certainly not in a mood to
argue but can you deliver some thing for our people.

OK. Let us take a sample synopsis from their website:

"LA102 Linux System Administration course is specifically designed to
rapidly train on skills required for administering a Linux Server.
This course focus on the advance level of Linux Administration,
through it starts from the basis. It provides training from
fundamental concepts with hand on session and emphasis on
administration through shell command."

Would you care to explain what exactly is of a high standard in this
drivel? Not even the spelling, idioms or grammar. I would really
appreciate it if you could post a summary of your interaction with
this so-called academy at MIT, and why you felt they knew what they
were saying.

While I agree with what you are trying to say here, I am positive that
this kind of fly-by-night operator is NOT the kind of push Linux
needs. Let this academy be a bit open about themselves - who their
faculty are, what are their credentials - I might give them the
benefit of doubt. Certainly not before.

> what do you mean by "ethernet modem"
This is not the same as the router.
Its a ADSL modem that takes a phone line into it and plugs in to your
ethernet port. Its like the USB Modem except, you know, it works through
ethernet.
When I was registering for the connection, I asked if the modem was
supported in Linux. The salesman bluntly told me No.
After I made a big production out of being dissappointed in this, he
called someone and then told me that if I get a ethernet modem instead of
a USB modem it should be OK to work.
The rental charges for the ethernet modem are the same (Its also a Beetel
modem - whatever that is).

> The modem which is given to me is an USB DSL modem
> Model seems to be "Beetel 100 CX".
Try and ask them if you can switch modems (I'm pretty sure the rentals are
the same and ethernet modems work in both Windows and Linux)

hi all,
i feel that the following features are lacking in Thunderbird mail client,
1. Offline Sending mail. (Outbox like feature), so that, once  
    it connects to net, the mails are sent automatically.
2. Having more than 1 smtp server configured, this hinders 
    from using more than 1 mail account for replying.
3. Exporting mailbox, so that we can use existing mail in another mail client.

Tell me if these features are provided already, and i couldnt find them out.

Yeah, I agree. 

It really doesn't matter to me which free software you
are propagating, as long as you are wearing a t-shirt.

I am ok with any FSF, GNU/Linux t-shirt.

====================

mtools - Utilities to access DOS disks in Unix

Summary :

Mtools is a public domain collection of tools to allow Unix systems to
manipulate DOS files: Read, Write, Delete & Move around files on an
DOS file system (Default floppy). Each program attempts to emulate the
MS-DOS equivalent command.

Example:

$ mdir -- List files from the floppy.

$ minfo -- Get DOS FS info.

$ mdu dir1 -- Space usage report of dir1.

$ mcopy myfile a: -- Copy DOS files to/from Linux.

$ mcd dir1 -- Change the current dir to a:/dir1.

$ mmove file1 file2 -- Move/Rename an DOS file/subdir.

$ mdel file -- Del a DOS file from floppy.

$ mdeltree dir -- Del a DOS dirtree from floppy.

$ mformat --  Create a DOS FS in a formatted floppy.

$ mlabel -- Make DOS volume label.

Note:
1) More tools are available in MTool Set.
2) Behavior of MTools will change depending upon the config 
   /etc/mtools.conf.

Dear Thyagu,

          I need one clarification, We are not going to do any exports
(or) counter sale that T-shirts. We just distribute ourself. The cost
is for buying T-shirts( matrial) only. Then how it will become
violation of their policy? any other way ?

There is an extension for doing this. Mozilla Thunderbird has a lot more
extensions to make your life simpler.

You can have more than one SMTP server configured. See the "Advanced"
button in the Outgoing server configuration.

Thunderbird uses standard 'mbox' format for storing mails. I personaly
feel that it is very convenient to share it across the mail clients as
most of the mail clients supports 'mbox' format. Hint: The each folder is
stored as a file in '.mozilla-thunderbird' or '.thunderbird' directory
under your home.

Googling would have answered most of your questions.

hi,
you can have more than 1 smtp account, but  by default you can use only 1
smtp for all accounts,
there is no mapping of account and its corresponding smtp...  you need to
manually change the smtp if u want to reply with that account.

I think you have not explored the features properly.

I have 3 different email account with its own IMAP/SMTP for each
account and happily using Thunderbird, to select the proper SMTP based
on the from email address.  I never switch the SMTP manually.

Once you associate which SMTP to use for a given accout, it will
remember it.  Say sometimes, when I receive email on mksarav AT comp
account but prefer to reply using my gmail id, and hence I select the
>From address as "gmail", then it automatically uses the gmail SMTP for
outgoing.

nope. if you set your account profile to send with a particular smtp server
for a particular account, it will do so

For simple applications try 'dialog' and for complex applications try
'ncurses'.

here you can add multiple SMTP servers and further you can set a

There is an interesting extension available for Thuderbird called

hi suresh,
i configured my thunderbird to server gmail and my company mail
successfully, and my default smtp server is my company's mail server, when i
am sending messages from my gmail account, its working fine, i am getting
responses to my gmail account only.
 but when i am sending messages to ilugc server , the messages i send from
my gmail account are bouncing back,....
This used to happen when i was subscribed to ilugc with my company's mail
id, as our company;s mail server is running on dynamic ip, but why is it
bouncing now when i am replying from my gmail's smtp?
this is because, although i reply with my gmail's account, my default
smtp(company's mail server) is serving the mail on behalf of gmail, so my
mails are bouncing back, moreover, when i am sending mail using gmails
account, the mails are being delivered at flash... no connecting and all
mesasges are seen... this is coz, i guess its using the comapany;s mail
server.... but it never happend when i was using gmail with outlook, is my
conclusion right?

Nope - you sent this from gmail to the ilugc list, and it didnt bounce

Maybe you have not configured smtp authentication (your username and 
password to send email) on thunderbird, or not clicked the checkbox to 
enable TLS?

Put in your shell profile file as,
script -qa /tmp/console_$(who -mu | awk '{ print $8 }' | tr -d '()').log
It will log all console log informations into it. And mail to during exit.

If you are using putty to connect to remote machine then simply do logging.

Hi guru prasath,
you are right, there is a send later option, but we have to explictly 
select that send later.....
even i was thing that this feature should be there, as i found that 
unsent messages folder.
I made a wrong statement that offline sending is not there.....

Ya this is also , true, but there is some glitch in this one, Actually , 
what thunderbird does it that, it used default SMTP settings only, even 
if u add another smtp server in the advanced options, and you will never 
notice the diference,  but its not a good idea, although it will do the job.

the people having expertise in diff areas must be noted and then there
must be proper integration of them to go ahead towards a goal
(software product)

but I think, since each one in the list wil be a student or wil be
employed in some concern, so wil there be time to contribute to such
software is a question..

I think a good coordination in sharing of work will do, although the 
work may be slow, but it will come out some day or the other.
all we need is, an individual who coordinates splitting of work in to 
modules , and integration of modules successfully.

It is always a good, useful and prestigious to contribute to the open
source community. There are already a lot of projects that needs
volunteers running in SF, Sarovar, Savannah, etc. My view is that we can
contribute to that instead of making ILUGC as yet another open source
developement portal.

This study says that most projects on sourceforge have fewer than 4

Well, I knew that paper. It is outdated. Anyway, what is the point you

Yeah, avoids the "useless use of cat"

What's wrong with uuencode filename | blah anyway?

Another alternative would be to use nail, MIME / IMAP[S] / SMTP Auth etc aware
mailx clone and much the same syntax as binand used for mutt

That every project isnt like the linux kernel, or gnome, or whatever, to
require several dozen to a few hundred developers?

That paper is still quite correct

Well I don't know whether spelling, idioms or grammer is helping you in
linux administration. If you are interested in that I think you should
have asked about the English teaching academy rather than talking linux
teaching. Each one has different options, what I have said is my
personel opinion. If you want take it, take it or else forget about it.

     I am not here to do a propaganda for any teaching center. I just
found they are good so I have said when someone had asked. If you much
interested to know more about them you better do a research on them and
then post it in the list. Personally I dont have any time or interested
in doing that, if you have time and interested your are welcome to do
that. I have no problem. 


> appreciate it if you could post a summary of your interaction with

I not employed by to you to post the summary on your request, if you
have so much interested in knowing about it, you should have come to MIT
and get the information you wanted rather than asking someone to post it
for you.  
  

> and why you felt they knew what they

  Every one has capability to judge others. In my judging I have found
what they said is what they are. And I believe them. I am not forcing my
belief on others. But I informed to list what i had felt about them. If
you want to more about them, as said before you can do your private
enquiry and post it on the list.

I never said in my statement that this academy is going to push linux. I
actually said when some one comes to learn they need to have push, and
lynx academy is one such academy I am across.

I have seen their faculty face to face and i am convinced if you want
you can go their academy and have you enquiry session and get the
credentials of faculty and post it to the list. Or else ask the MD of
the lynx academy do that.

There are 2 ways of  doing this thing.

a) Stick on to the trademark policies of  mozilla, and print the
t-shirts according to the norms laid by the owner of the trademark.

b) Overpower the trademark policies and do this operations.

If mozilla is not willing to share this offer , it is better for us to
get rid of mozilla firefox or any other brands of mozilla and start
concentrating on various other logo's of FSF and similiar kind of
thought logo's for T-SHIRT. I believe the orders which was posted in
our wiki page shows  the keen interest of our members to show the
world, the pride of using the  open source, free softwares like the
FSF brands. At any point of time we will not classify ourselves in
section b. lets not do postmortem on why mozilla is not willing or the
intregrity of making the logo of firefox on our t-shirts.The chapter
is closed as of mozilla firefox/any other brands of mozilla  is
concerned.

Lets be creative and put a logo which is legitimate and Free (as in
the word Freedom) to use and make this operation a successful one.Tux
is a good suggestion.Make a catch word for it. our people are strong
enough in creativity. lets do a magic catch word  and a theme for our
own t-shirts.

I believe i am right and all of our members endorse  it.Hope let the
suggestion flows as before.I got the sample of cloth material with me.
lets unify ourself in thought and find a logo on our t-shirts.

cheers

Thyagarajan.

Suresh -

I never said that contributing to open source means working on a team of
tons of people. It can be a single man show as well.

The point that wanted to stress was that requirements in
http://sourceforge.net/people/ other similar efforts would interest the
people who raised thier concern on open source developement in ILUGC.

I think the topic took a minor deviation. Do you have something to say to
the enthusiastic developers?

Thanks -
Praveen.
