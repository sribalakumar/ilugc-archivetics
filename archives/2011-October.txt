Raj,

Most of us are in the ball park of 300, and a few here may be much
more than that.

It is customary courtesy to quote a few lines when an URL is referred.
  Looking at your other postings, I am confident you can at least
do a min. like the following:

<quote>
copy/paste a few lines from the first para at the link
</quote>

Otherwise, personally, I agree with Ashwin.

It is great that your company is working on FOSS products.

However, please following mailing list guidelines [1].

Specifically:

(a) Compose a "new" message with a proper subject line - which is not
the case in your OP.

(b) Do *not* recycle other threads or reply to Digest messages - which
is the case in your OP.

(c) Take a few seconds to trim your post - which is not the case in
your OP.  Disk storage prices may have fallen (or come *free* from
service provider)  but they still consume energy.

Today volunteers of Free Software Foundation, Tamil Nadu, took a session for
CSE Speech and Hearing Impairments Problem(SHIP) students of Kalasilingam
University, on Web Technologies, Network Basic, Drupal, around 60 gems
attended it. By the response from the gems, we could definitely expect a

Hello team,

the project has halted the release of the 11.04 manual in order to catch the
11.10 release on time. One of the major problem of previous release was the
bulk of a whole chapter to fall on one or two authors. From this release and
on authors will be assigned to one or more sections, and not to a whole
chapter. The work will be divided in order to get this manual out in time.
By "on time" i mean to release the manual as soon as possible, at least in
the following 4-5 months.

If you are interested in becoming a chapter author or editor of the manual,
check http://ubuntu-manual.org/jobs

If you could also spread the word by forwarding this mail, writing about it
on your blog, or on social media, that would be really helpful :).

Thank you for your time, best wishes for a successful new release *on time*
!

Hi

http://ask.fedoraproject.org is a question and answer oriented forum for
Fedora.  It has been launched today to provide a community support
portal for Fedora community and build a knowledge base in a organic way.

You do not need to a separate id to post questions or answer them.  You
can use any openid to login including Google, Yahoo or Wordpress.  You
can use your Fedora identity as well (fasname.id.fedoraproject.org).

The full launch will be in sync with the Fedora 16 release.  I am
announcing it early here to have some feedback and to feed in some
relevant questions and answers.  Thanks to everyone who helped out
including PJP,  Kevin Fenzi,  Toshio Ernie Kuratomi, Matthias Runge,
Praveen Kumar,  Arun SAG,  Ratnadeep Debnath, Lakshmi Narasimhan,  and
Jitesh Shah.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Rahul

Hi,

The Shaastra team has been trying to get me to speak at their event
for many years. This year I wanted to make it, and as part of the
Hackfest at Shaastra 2011 [1], September 28 to October 2, 2011 at
IIT-Madras [2], Chennai, I had presented the talk on
"i-want-2-do-project. tell-me-wat-2-do" [3].

Most of the students were interested in participating in the Google
Summer of Code program. I was also able to meet and talk with past
Google Summer of Code students, who had already been introduced to
this presentation.

I visited the IITM Research Expo at the K V grounds on campus where
students had presented their research work. There were quite a few
interesting papers on MEMS [4]. I also attended the Paper and Poster
presentation by students at the IITM Research Park [5].

Few pictures taken at the event are available [6].

Just read and follow the instructions in the following link.
http://www.linoob.com/2010/02/setting-up-oracle-xe-10g-in-ubuntu/

If you use virtualbox in Ubuntu, then a package(libaio) installation will
cause issues in Virtualbox. If you are in Fedora, then follow
http://www.felipecruz.com/oracle-10g-install-guide-linux-redhat.php

Hope those two links will help you.

My friends are working on donating a computer to our street public library
at kanchipuram.

Need a collection of ebooks on various subjects.

They should be freely distributable.

Please share the info on this.

Thinking on the software to manage those ebooks.

Calibre seems promising.
Is there any other suggestion?

     This one is good for Mathematics:
     http://people.math.gatech.edu/~cain/textbooks/onlinebooks.html

Also, for books related to computers, GNU's books can be used.
Wikibooks is another option(We can download a few of them as PDF).

Yes, there are tools to reverse engineer Zend Guard encoded/obfuscated
code -- downloadable software like deZender ( zendecode.com ) and
online decompiler services like showmycode.com. However, these aren't
open source products and most of them are commercial. I would
personally avoid using any code that implements obfuscation as a means
for IP protection.

http://www.gutenberg.org might be the one that perfectly fits the
discription. But you will find only classics there mostly. You wont
find latest and greatest there. So if you are satified with classics
then gutenburg is a good option.

Dear folks,


I am using Mint 11 and VLC Player to watch movies and my laptop has 4GB ram
and 512MB of internal Graphic card on-board with i5 processor.
When i play any HD videos, the performance of the video drops and the frames
move slower than sound. How to boost up the performance of an HD video on
Ubuntu/Mint?

Same VLC Player plays HD well in Windoz? I do not want to log in into windoz
just for this reason. Is there any solution for this, please share with me.
Thanks in advance.

To: <mailinglist at fsftn.org>

"The Document Foundation has attracted more developers with commits in the
first year than the OpenOffice.org project in the first decade"

As for OpenOffice, Oracle modified its plans in April and cancelled its
commercial version of the productivity suite.

 A year after forking the OpenOffice.org project to create a
community-driven office productivity suite, The Document Foundation
estimated that LibreOffice has 25 million users worldwide.

OpenOffice.org developers originally created LibreOffice to break the
software away from Oracle's control after it appeared that the database
giant was not interested in working with the open-source community. The
Document Foundation was founded to make the project truly vendor-neutral.
Google was among the first companies to support the new project.

Oracle responded to the split by forcing TDF members who were also
participating on the OpenOffice community council to step down. Despite not
having Oracle support, LibreOffice has thrived in the past year, with more
than 25,000 code "commits" submitted by 330 contributors. Code commits
reflect major changes to code, the addition of new features and bug fixes.

       http://projectmadurai.org/ is a good source for Tamil books.
All of them are in the public domain. Thanks

Hi friends,

Many of you must have heard about the recent raids by software firms on
photography studios in Mandya and Mysore districts. Here is a news article
on the same,
http://www.deccanherald.com/content/190270/beware-using-softwares-licence.html.

FSMK, Free Software Movement Karnataka has recently released a press note
appealing to small scale vendors to try out FOSS alternatives,
http://www.fsmk.org/node/86

Photography studios associations have contacted us and requested us to train
them on FOSS alternatives. Hence we are looking for GIMP experts who have
worked extensively on photo editing to talk to few representatives of these
associations and understand their requirements. If their requirements are
fulfilled by GIMP, then we can plan for a large scale workshop and help them
migrate.
So please contact us if you can help us in understanding their requirements
and migrating them.

If this is not done immediately, then they will be forced to come to some
agreement with software firms and have to shell out chunk of their profit to
pay for the license fees.

Hello everyone,

I am pleased to announce that the next Ubuntu User Days [1] event is
scheduled to take place from Saturday September 24th 2011, 13:30 UTC
until Sunday September 25th 2011, 02:00 UTC. To quote the wiki page,
"User Days was created to be a set of courses offered during a one day
period to teach the beginning or intermediate Ubuntu user the basics
to get them started with Ubuntu". Logs [2] from the last Ubuntu User
Days event are also available for anyone who might be interested.

In order for this event to be a success, we need lots of help leading
sessions. To volunteer to lead a session, you can contact a member of
the Ubuntu User Days Team [3] by sending an email to the
ubuntu-classroom at lists.ubuntu.com mailing list or on IRC by stopping
by #ubuntu-classroom-backstage on irc.freenode.net. If you are unsure
of a topic for your session, you can use the Course Suggestions wiki
page [4] as a reference. Please be sure to pass this email along to
any of your friends who might be interested in either participating or
leading a session.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir,
I am working as Judge in Tamil Nadu, India. I have been using ubuntu
form 2006. In India till now all the Courts of India have been using Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 5 for past 4 years. Now Supreme Court of India has
directed all the Courts (approx 17000 Courts) to change over to Ubuntu
10.04. The Supreme Court of India also has given all the Courts to
Customized Ubuntu Linux DVD.

You should have created a new thread rather than hijacking someone else thread.
I believe you should check your BIOS configuration and enable PCI graphics card.

Technically yes, practically its of little use since articles are generally
not fully developed and provides little value. Tamil wikipedians have this
idea for very long time, however for a offline project to be useful, it
requires loads of manual effort on content. There was a project started (and
currently stands stalled)[1]. Some day it will see light at the end of
tunnel. :)

Please write to me offlist, I can help you more :)

There are some open issues for sometime now in database dumps and I guess
they are not fully supported by community, ie if you hit around issues,
solve them yourself :)

Hi Pandiyan,

I don't think you are allowed to install oracle 10g on fedora and
ubuntu by oracle. Last time i read the installation docs from oracle,
it specifically stated that supported linux platforms are only rhel ,
suse enterprise and oracle unbreakable linux. So you shouldn't be
installing oracle on fedora and such. Those are unsupported platforms
and will cause issues and might have stability problem post
installation. I assume you have bought oracle 10g from oracle. So you
are entitled for support and oracle should guide you on how to do the
installation if you ask them for free.

with regrads,
ashwin

Hi,

     The proprietary drivers for ATi are generally a waste. If you're
on F15, I recommend you to use the nouveau drivers, which are better
than the ATi drvers. Also, if you're installing ATi drivers make sure,
you build a rpm package and then install it through yum/rpm so that
uninstall is easier.

Dear Shrini,

Ever since you took over the mantle from Bharathi we have been having
 4 speakers at a monthly meeting.

I wonder how effective such meetings are.

I will try to attend one of these and figure this out myself.

But from my imagination I would imagine that 2 talks per meet is what
 people can take.

We want each speaker to spend enough time talking and answering questions.

Then you could have commented after you figured it out. The above comment of
WONDERING is unwanted, IMO.

I guess you assumed that the total meeting time remains the same. But it's
not; rather the time for a single talk remains the same (in fact there has
been no restriction imposed on time, AFAIK). If you feel the meeting is too
long, you are free to attend only the talks that interest you.

Of course he/she has enough time.

Hi,

     As we all know, the Laptops distributed by the TN govt. is going
to have only non-free software. So as a counter measure I had an idea
of making posters, banners, hand-outs and brochures, explaining the
ill-effects of using windows and the costs involved.

     Can people who are good in GIMP or Inkscape design such things so
that people can distribute it when a laptop distribution ceremony is
going on?

     We would need as many different types or versions of the posters/
banners hand-outs et al to do this. Expecting co-operation and help
from all LUG people. Please help to spread the message.

With Regards,

That is a great Idea. But try to mention as Proprietary software in common
as I am having many incidents (bad) that occurred when I simply used the
Name of the OS.  Especially in the crowd with Microsoft student partners.

 Hope Asking help to Free software foundation and Ubuntu-India teams will
give a better help and crowd.
A brief explanation about the laptop distribution ceremony will be good so
that we can know when and where it is gonna happen.

I have added ubuntu-in mailings list and FSFTN mailings list to get some
more audience. If I get a clear overview and a good explanation about the
release, then I can post it in my blog and some of my friends' blog too.

Don't run subversion edge as root.

You can start the apache server from the browser ui.

I think you locked the gmail login by port number (80). https runs in port
number 430.

Wait, did something change? I have an ATI 4670. The open-source driver
for this card is 'radeonhd' and I suspect the same driver is used for
similar cards. AFAIK, Nouveau is for Nvidia cards.

When i was using Gnome2, everything was fine. The driver is producing
trouble with gnome3 only. And the main problem is, without ATI fglrx driver
i can't play games, like braid.

You are confused.  Nouveau is the open source driver for Nvidia cards.
Radeon is the open source driver for ATI cards.

Radeonhd is the older deprecated driver.  The default these days is Radeon.

Is your gateway the local dns resolver for your network? If not, you
can do that redirecting all dns requests going out to the gateway's
resolver itself using iptables. Then, in the etc/hosts file of the
gateway, you can resolve gmail to any address you want locally that
will serve out the error page saying "gmail not allowed" etc.

However people can easily bypass this using a public DNS service like google
DNS or Open DNS.

Hi ilugs,

Thank you

The CSVN issue was related with user and file permission .

We just add a user in the name of  7039 then we started the csvn-httpd
service,now csvn server is working fine.

Subject: [Ilugc] Can we access the SWAP SPACE in Python
Message-ID: <CAK1T7EtQcnyL2zyPhHbWi24ZBPcmxDENgMeeELpGrLnt0eHyKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

My doubts :-
----------------

Is there any way to store the data (temporarily) in the SWAP SPACE instead
of RAM ?

When RAM overflows then only SWAP area will be utilized by the OS.

At the same time the whole system started to slowdown to do another jobs due
insufficient memory in RAM.

Is there any way to store some data in SWAP (but not in RAM) and get the
data from the SWAP partition whenever we need it in Python or C language ?

yup. It may be slower to access the swap area rather than RAM, but it is
much faster than access the data of files which are stored in the hard disk.


Explanation about my doubt/need :-
------------------------------------------------

I am running one computation program in python / CDAT [1].

In that program we need to access the data in numpy array size of (122 x 360
x 720). [i.e time x latitude x longitude in shape ]

By accessing two different data in the same shape (above), we are creating
15 different array variables in the shape of (10 x 360 x 720).

I have created the file object to extract the each latitude,longitude of
data,
to compute the 15 different calculations and store it in the temporary numpy
array.

Finally store the results into netCDF file format.

It takes 2 days to complete this job and eats 3GB RAM memory.

One of the reasons is ' 2 x 360 x 720 ( = 518400 ) times needs to access
python file object to retrieve the data of corresponding latitude,
longitude'.

So accessing the file object 518400 times to get the data makes the delay
time to complete our tasks...

Even though if we used threads, parallel python and cluster the system(s)
needs to access the file object 518400 times in my case.
Instead of these if we stored the data into swap space means, the accessing
the data should be faster.

[ Read my doubts again here ]

I may be wrong. Please throw me your suggestions.
Thanks in advance.

No, it's best to let the kernel handle memory management.  But read below.

Use mmap to map a file directly into your processes address space. When
you reference the memory address, the kernel will read/write data from the
file using the same mechanisms it uses to swap.  You will bypass all file
IO buffering and have direct access to the files.  This is how all DB engines
handle IO.  mmap() vs read() will give you a 3 x speedup for IO bound jobs.

Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment by Stevens has a good
example of file copy implemented using mmap.

> It takes 2 days to complete this job and eats 3GB RAM memory.

Mechanisms to speed up scientific code:

1. Make fewer passes over your data.  Ideally you want to read the
data once, complete all processing and never have to read it again.
Do not make several passes over data doing a little processing each
time.

2. Use efficient IO like mmap.

3. Use the correct algorithms suitable for your data size and work.

4. Profile your code to understand which step takes the most time.
Then start fine tuning.

5. Run a 64bit OS, you'll sometimes need to use more RAM if you
want faster performance.  It's a trade-off.

6. Code the hot spots in C if you need more speed.

OS, python libs will cache IO.  So you will not hit disk each time you
read the data.

Could you clarify? You initially said you wanted to store in swap instead of
RAM. Now you want to store in swap(which is essentially a 2nd class RAM)
instead of files in file-system. Do you mean to say you don't want in RAM
because you don't want to use precious RAM space but want to use swap as it
is faster than accessing other files?

I am not sure about SWAP access from program. But you can fine tune
the swap using the /proc/sys/vm/swappiness.

Swap is in HDD. So much improvement. You can try the mmap option
suggested by Raja. But you need to manage the data handling. Another
option, Create RamFS, load data files into it. So that you can access
it as if from HDD file and get the maximum speed. Remember, RamFS eat
a fixed amount the RAM and handle the data persistence.

I downloaded the source of dhvani version 0.95 and installed in ubuntu
11.04.

In ubuntu it need the following dependencies,

sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libzlcore-dev liblz-dev libgsm1-dev
libghc6-gstreamer-dev ripit alsa-base  alsa-utils libalsaplayer-dev
libclalsadrv-dev fp-units-multimedia libsoundtouch-dev

Then it should be installed.

But I am getting the following error when try to invoke that dhvoni command.

dhvani: error while loading shared libraries: libdhvani.so.0: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory


I suggest you to install the deb file by pre-installing the package called
libsoundtouch-dev .

 I Tried to install in his laptop via Team Viewer, when in ran the Perl
file, setup initiated and then while setting user environments it asked for
the location of header files of C that belongs to kernel. There were nearly
4 locations of kernel, but each of the location failed and now not able to
install due to this problem.

Check your running kernel and select the appropriate one.

Hi,

>>The TTS with Screen Reader (NVDA and OCRA) CD can be obtained on request
from Prof Hema Murthy (hema at cse.iitm.ac.in) and OCR can be accessed from
TDIL Data Centre (http://www.tdil-dc.in) .

I heard about a software called ORCA http://live.gnome.org/Orca , Is there
anything called as OCRA?., is it a typo in the press release?.pardon my

You could just use the PAE kernels to utilize the ram beyond 4Gb,
instead of going from 32 bit to 64 bit. I don't use ubuntu, but I
think you can pull the kernels off apt-get.

Vmware workstation is a paid product, so if you have a license its great 
but there is also Vmware player which also works as good with trimmed 
down features.

http://www.vmware.com/products/player/overview.html
http://downloads.vmware.com/d/info/desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/4_0

In the vmware player download section, after login, choose the bundle 
file available for download under linux. The bundle file, i believe, is 
like a shell archive so you can install it using "sh <bundle-filename>" 
on the terminal but you need to login as "root" user before doing so.

After installation, run the following command to start vmware services, 
"service vmware restart" or "service vmplayer restart", I think its the 
former but i seem to have forgotten which one.

To start vmplayer, check the applications menu, a shortcut has probably 
been created. To run from the terminal/console the command is vmplayer.

---

On a different note, you can run vmware-install.pl by launching the 
terminal and running the command "./vmware-install.pl" or "perl 
vmware-install.pl".

Dear Sir,

This is quite interesting.

Is there any way - i can send messages within a network (office
network - internal) from my Ubuntu 10.04 to any Windows XP systems ??

- what should I install
- what i should ask - others to install.

Thanks

with warm regards

i have already tried this on his system but it says that " The kernel C
header files are found in this location but this is not your kernel version
"
i tried with the kernel version from the output of uname -a only. But still
it shows the same.

On a different note, you can run vmware-install.pl by launching the
> terminal and running the command "./vmware-install.pl" or "perl

That was we were doing and we got to choose the location of kernel c header
files and the above was the problem .

Do NOT top post.

IP Messenger[1] is good enough for your purposes. It is a BSD licensed, free
software tool (Not a 'freeware' as someone mentioned above.)

It is enough to install IP Messenger on all systems. Look in your repository
for Linux ports of it. Ubuntu Natty has xipmsg and g2ipmsg in universe repo.

Hi,

Check Pidgin Messenger... There is Bonjour account in the account 
option. There is a windows version of Pidgin. But I don't know whether 
it has the Bonjour plugin or not.

Kopete Messenger is also having the Bonjour Account. And it can work in 
both Kubuntu(also in Ubuntu) and Windows.

Try different Messengers having the Bonjour Service Option.

Or try installing Jabber Server *jabber*d.org and configure Pidgin to 
work with that.

And there is also ipmsg for Gnu/Linux available I think.

Thanks,
Manikk

You have to install Apple Bonjour print services, to use it (proprietary
software alert).

SVN == Subversion

Shrini's links have documents for Subversion Edge(It is basically Apache
server + ViewVC + recommended setup of SVN). You asked for basics of version
control itself. My link has book that explains version control from basics
using SVN. :-)

Hi,

     If you're interested in network security, you can take a look at
nmap, wireshark, airsnort, etc,. Try contributing to these projects in
small ways like bug-reporting... :-)

Hi,

I have phpmyadmin running on 2 linux servers. One Debian machine and another
an Ubuntu machine.

In both cases, I see much better performance on the client side with IE
compared to Chrome. The responsiveness and the over all user experience is
much better in IE. What could be the reason for this? This is so perplexing
because the app we wrote are opposite. We get much better performance in
Chrome than IE.

Think you should use google uncle.

Have you tried the link?
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/

Please do some homework. If you don't your efforts (rather lack of it)
will turnout to be your own spadework.

Sure, this group helps a lot. In return,

It also expects people to their own relevant search before trying to
jump to this group for answers.

The esteemed Members (except me) care to spend time in reading mails
in SMS and what knows format, parse them and then tries to help the
OP.

Please have some respect. "Nobody owes you an answer."

Just the standard Thanks on the signature line is not enough
encouragement for such seasoned posters.


Apologies if I have sounded a bit rude. I wanted to be curt, rather

I dont think exe by itself will work in linux. This is a linux

Look at the source code of nmap (which is freely avaibale) and port
the code to java and your project is done.

Is it something like http://meraki.com/products/wireless/wifi-stumbler
(unfortunately, not opensource) ?
There's an old opensource Wifi scanner written in Java called Mognet.
Google for "Mognet-1.16.tar.gz"

By ns-3, I guess you mean the Network Simulator (nsnam.org). Velammal
and VIT conducted workshops on NS2 earlier this year:

http://www.vit.ac.in/events2011/NET%20WORk.pdf

http://www.velammal.org/pdf/NetworkStimulator2011.pdf

You may probably approach the resource persons mentioned in the
brochure or ask your query in the ns3 users group:

Did you try using it in chrome's incognito mode? If it works well in
that mode, perhaps one of your chrome extensions is creating the
trouble.

phpmyadmin uses Ajax to the maximum extent.? Scripting may be optimized to IE and Firefox.? You can note even more improvement in Firefox.

I couldnt use mmap( ) function in my case, since I am accessing the binary
file like NetCDF, PP, HDF, Grads which contains data
in formats of numpy.float32, numpy.float64 and some meta data also.

These files cant read it as like normal text file object such as
fileobj.readlines( ). i.e. These files are not string type.
So I cant use mmap( ) in this case.

Thanks for above suggestions.

I will use all the above in my project.

RamFS is really awesome.

Thanks for your suggestion. It should help me a lot.

Yes. Correctly...
I hope RamFS, TmpFS should help me to handle this problem.

If you are new to version control itself, give GIT or Mercurial a shot.

Message-ID: <CACbtZwSko1Bm3Jr2ik1boCB99zWaA=G8u68T4-PUwn2=5ENqBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

A Hackathon was organized by the ILUGC and Thamizha community members on 9th
October, Sunday at TalentSprint, Royapettai, Chennai. There were 16
participants in total.

The morning session started with Arunan demoing the setting up of git and
github accounts for the participants through Google Plus Hangout. Then an
introduction of the code version using git and how to commit to Thamizha
projects were given. There was a demo of Visaneri Project by Kishore Kumar
through Google Hangout screen sharing.

Then teams were divided based upon the personal fluency of programming
languages. The projects that the teams set on to work on are:

1. Drupal team: Creating a new Thamizha.com site with close integration to
the github and easy of use for the users to download software.

2. Python team: The python team started the work of moving an offline
wiktionary from the wxPython GUI framework to the PyQt framework.

3. JavaScript Team: This team members were working on developing a new
meaning lookup tool using the mediawiki API on the wiktionary site.

4. Content team: This team started to work on translating the
gitref.orgcontent to Tamil.

By evening Mugunthraj joined the rest of the team in the Hangout and demoed
the entire compilation e-Kalappai software.
I must confess we couldn't complete any of the projects by the evening, but
this hackathon provided  a nice platform for the developers to get together
and get hooked into a project that they can work during their free time in
future.

A big thanks to Ashokan Pichai sir for offering the venue and the Kanchi LUG
members for taking their time to come down to Chennai.

Personally, I learned a number of lessons regarding event organizing and
Open Source Volunteering.

Thanks a lot yaar..... i dint try this because 'Application -> Accessories
-> Take Screenshot'  does the same job as delaying the time to fire the
gnome-screenshot to trigger. Thanks for immediate response... :)

Greetings All,

Over the last couple of weeks a group of devs from Nitobi have been
putting together an Android Wikipedia App for us. They've been using
the PhoneGap framework to build the app and now it mostly has the same
features as our iOS app. I think it's finally gotten to a good state
for people to start hacking on it.

For those just wanting to get started here are the links

code: https://github.com/nitobi/Wikipedia
bugs: http://bit.ly/q1B9Bj
feature ideas:
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Projects/App_Features_&_Roadmap#Features_committed

Right now the code is sitting in github but the plan is to move it
into our own git repo, alongside MediaWiki.

How can you help?

* Fork the code and help us with open bug requests
* Critique the code and suggest cleanup
* Port the app to iOS, Symbian, BlackBerry, Windows, WebOS, & Bada ?
first get it running, then customize to each platform's look and feel
* Start to hack on new features like image uploads, starting a new
article, offline article saving, openZIM support, etc ...
* Localization for the user interface
* ... and whatever else you can come up with

Don't worry if you don't know Objective C, Java, etc .. All you need
to know is HTML5, CSS3, and JS. It's really simple to write these
apps.

Lots of pretty screen shots and a user flow diagram here :
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Projects/WikipediaAndroidApp

Come join us on #wikimedia-mobile and let us know how it goes.

Great idea!!

Can we have distributed and simul-conferences using centos and video
streaming etc.?

Obtaining Visa etc. are a major issue to Indians. I also marking this

I will explore the possibility in Mumbai.

I have no experience with rack mount chassis and the associated HDD
bays (active or passive)

To reduce the H/W cost, I am considering Linux mdadm RAID10 on a 2U
chassis.  However, I am not sure whether there is any visual/audio HDD
failure notification from the HDD bay to the OS.

Do the HDD bays that house the hard disks have the following feature?

(a) Indicate HDD failure. LED lights up and/or audio alarm?
(b) The failed HDD can be hot swapped.

To get the above functionality what kind of bays do I need to specify?

TIA.

Hi friends,


When we open Linux terminal and perform some commands like ' ls ' and then '
clear ' , Screen will be cleared but yet if we scroll up using our mouse or
keyboard output of previous commands can be seen.

For some reason i wanted this should also not appear, can this be done? and
i know that
' history -c ' command clears the previously used command. but how to get a
fresh terminal screen without previous outputs?

Please someone help me!!

You didn't mention which terminal you are using. On gnome-terminal, you can use:

  $ reset

MySQL's command line tools are same whether it is used in Windows or Linux.

In the source machine (Windows in your case):
Go the command prompt (Start->Run->Cmd)
*mysqldump* -u *username* -p *databasename* >* backupfile.sql*

Copy the backup file over to  the linux machine.
There in a shell:
*mysql* -u *username* -p *databasename* < *backupfile.sql*

make sure that the database 'databasename' exists in the target machine and
is empty.
To create the database in the target machine:
*mysql* -u *username* -p
In the mysql command prompt:
mysql>create database databasename;

Hi

I too faced a similar problem when I upgraded my computer from Ubuntu 10.10
to Ubuntu 11.04. Couldn't find any fix and hence settled for Ubuntu 10.04.
Is it because your hardware does not support Ubuntu 11.04? I wonder. Any
help would be appreciated.

It is most likely that video is not detected properly. Try to go into single usermode and look at log files in /var/log. Files like Xorg.log or dameon.log may give you some clue.

Hello Mr.Arun

Many thanks to you for your excellent tips towards migrating D/B. Migration has been completed. However, I am not able to see the end result from target m/c. (i.e.)MySQL server on RHEL server. It comes out with no 'entry found' message upon query submission through front end. I am using perl-cgi script on the backend for submitting and retrieving data from MySQL D/B. I checked the existence of D/B on target machine but it does not show up 'TABLES' for the exported respective D/Bs(Empty set 0.00 sec) The MySQL command prompt outputs entry not found. Kindly help further.

with thanks

MySQL's command line tools are same whether it is used in Windows or Linux.

In the source machine (Windows in your case):
Go the command prompt (Start->Run->Cmd)
*mysqldump* -u *username* -p *databasename* >* backupfile.sql*

Copy the backup file over to  the linux machine.
There in a shell:
*mysql* -u *username* -p *databasename* < *backupfile.sql*

make sure that the database 'databasename' exists in the target machine and
is empty.
To create the database in the target machine:
*mysql* -u *username* -p
In the mysql command prompt:
mysql>create database databasename;
mysql>quit


Hope that helps.

Regards,
Arun

Ensure proper permission for the user to access the database. Run 'show
databases" as root user from mysql console.

If you aren't comfortable using the command-line tools, you could use
phpMyAdmin to do the export and import. Login into phpMyAdmin, select
the database and select 'Export' and export the database in one of the
available formats.

Then open the phpMyAdmin for the destination database server and
create a database. Select that database and using 'Import' import the
dumped data from the saved dump into the destination database.

Refer - http://www.phpmyadmin.net/documentation/#faq6_4 and
http://www.phpmyadmin.net/documentation/#faq6_5

And please follow the mailing list guidelines
(http://www.ilugc.in/content/mailinglist-guidelines)  and do not top

The HDD controller is the bit that informs the OS about disk failures.
HDD bays are passive equipment.

mdadm can be run in daemon mode to watch for disk errors and alert
in a variety of ways.  You can use "beep" to beep the PC speaker on
errors. mdadm works with any SATA/SAS controller so you don't need
any special equipment to detect/report errors.

Unlike hardware RAID controllers, mdadm may not support true hot swap.
You may have to disable/offline the disk in mdadm before removing it from
the server chassis -- reboot is definitely not needed.

If you are getting HP/IBM/Dell/etc, just order hot swap drive bays.
You can use ILO to blink the UID LEDs.

mmap is suitable for all types of files.

If you aren't comfortable using the command-line tools, you could use
phpMyAdmin to do the export and import. Login into phpMyAdmin, select
the database and select 'Export' and export the database in one of the
available formats.

Then open the phpMyAdmin for the destination database server and
create a database. Select that database and using 'Import' import the
dumped data from the saved dump into the destination database.

Hi All

I owe my sincere thanks & compliments to those who responded to this thread & query as I have successfully ahcieved the result which I was looking for. The mistake was with me only because while importing the sql file to target machine I was using 'mysqldump' command instead of 'mysql'. This was the reason due to whcih there was slight hiccup. Thanks to all.

with sincere thanks & regards
s.mahalingam

TN Government must try to install both windows and Linux so that students
can decide whichever best suites them. If there are budget constraints then
they must drop Windows in favor of Linux. Laptop without WiFi is a stupid
idea. If Microsoft insists that Windows must be the first OS to boot instead
of giving a GRUB like menu then it must be dumped for its monopolistic trade
practice. If some one badly wants windows then they will also  know how much
it costs, where to get it cheap and how to install it. I think we  must seek
the help of communist Party of India to lobby the TN government  in this
regard.

It's already a done deal. They are preloading BOSS linux with Windows.
http://bosslinux.in/BOSS-In-TamilNadu

The question is, with such a large scale purchase of Windows licences
on Tax payer money, who is getting kickbacks and laughing all the way
to the bank?

> Laptop without WiFi is a stupid idea.

Forget WiFi, they will not get even a wired internet connection and
since most students can't afford a subscription on their own, there's
no way to pull anti-virus updates (If I am not mistaken, a 1 year AV
subscription is part of the deal). Students will most likely share
flash drives and get an uninhibited supply of malware. So yeah, stupid
terrible idea!

Their policy is to oppose crony capitalism and american capitalism. So they
may oppose Microsoft since it is allegedly using backdoor means to promote
their product at the cost of pubic money.

communist philosophy is not FOSS philosophy.
and I hope FOSS is not the opposite of capitalism.

Also, every bit of IT technology we enjoy today is mostly the result of
American capitalism.

Unless there is some political backing it is not possible to persuade TN
government to install Linux and include Wifi in free laptops. Among the
allies of ruling party, CPI is the most likely party to support us in our
fight against "windows only" policy. At this moment there is a coincidence
of interest in opposing unfair priority given to Microsoft windows. It
doesn't mean that we endorse all their political views and philosophies.
Yeah, suggesting an opportunistic partnership.

Senthil Nathan

You might be right about all the local  or Indian, 'stains' of the communists.

 But fundamentally communism is about collective ownership and freeing
resources  from private ownership, say, the idea that  all the Land
should be owned by the state, very much akin to what FOSS is doing in
technology.

 The concept ought to be good. Even though we despise the label called
'communism',  we can take what is good  from it. You know  the biggest
mafia/exploitation is in the real estate business.

regards

Nataraj

this is OT - but for your information they are clueless about open
source and are under the impression that it is akin to communism. It is
not. It is firmly embedded in the positive aspects of american
capitalism. Guess which are the richest among the newer american
companies - and then guess what technology they use. Never ever ally
with people who support your cause for the wrong reasons - they will
ditch you in the long run.

Hi Ken

Nope, haven't read any of those. For now i am bit too busy. Surely i
might have a look into those if at all i get a chance for a prolonged
retired life in Ooty like yours. ;-)

Don't  get me wrong. I don't subscribe for any of those 'isms' -
capitalism or communism. In this particular context I think we might
try to get the CPI to lobby for our cause. Just because  them are a so
called 'National party' and that they seem to have 'positioned'
themselves to oppose whatever comes from US, be it capitalism or M$,
we might have a chance to raise some noise through them. Like you
said, their actual intentions could be anything but helping our cause.

 Surely we can't go after 'captian Vijaykant' or Vaiko for that matter
who might as well ask what this thingy called 'FOSS' is. These CPI are
our only option for a political attack. And they have made some
substantial dent on behalf of Linux for schools in Kerala.

Nataraj

I believe both your assertions are wrong.
I am not a lawyer, but I don't think FOSS is about public ownership.

BTW 'Freedom' is the *ONE* thing communism take away from you. Capitalism's
greatest gift is freedom!

One a funny note, I would say FOSS is more inclined towards socialism-
Communism: You have two cows. The government seizes both and provides you
with milk. You wait in line for you share of the milk, but it's so long that
the milk is sour by the time you get it.
Socialism: You have two cows. The government takes one of your cows and
gives it to your neighbor. You're both forced to join a cooperative where
you have to teach your neighbor how to take care of his cow.

Looks so from a distance. Under US capitalism, socialism is for 
corporates where govt uses tax-payers money to help corporates. 
Capitalism's gift of freedom is a myth as it leads to monopolies which 
eliminate every freedom. Look at the US it is a uni-or bi-polar world. 
We don't have much options here, you can buy whatever you can as long as 
you are in Amazon.

Capitalism: You can't afford a cow. Pay heavily to the monopoly to buy 
synthetic milk.

US can't be the model for the world, Europe can be as it is mix of both 
capitalism as well as 'social welfare'.

Friends.

We do not need the suggestions on whom to contact, to whom to explain
this issue.

You are always welcome to contact anyone and discuss with any 'ism' leaders.

Discuss with them in person or in mail or phone.

We had enough discussions in the list. All these list discussions will go vein
if we do not take any action in real time.

Take some real time action and share your experience here.

Thanks.

Hi Srinivasan

I did contact MP from Coimbatore Mr.P.R.Natarajan today.  He is busy
till 19th due to local body elections. Asked me to meet him after the

Hope we have some time to rally our forces by then.

May be all of you can advise/suggest the tools for a decent demo in
case. Good case studies  as well.

I am lost touch with the mainstream distros for some time, since I am
more into embedded linux and X less servers.

FOSS is not defined in terms of the relationship of software to
ownership. But ends up being opposed to corporate dictatorships.
In fact many FOSS licenses have components that are not really
compatible with capitalism.

"Dictatorship of proletariat" does not fully define communist method
of running states. The reference to 'dictatorship' is in the sense of
something opposed to "autocracy of capitalists". According to Marx,
communist states and their management should evolve from objective
reality ... this ends up meaning different levels of decentralisation
of power,  democracy, etc. Yes communism would be FOSS compatible.

But FOSS does not by itself yield communism.  It can of course be
argued that even within plutocratic systems FOSS will guarantee a
certain amount of  social welfare on the people.

As different types of activists support FOSS, it will be best to
proceed in an issue-based manner.

As far as the original topic is concerned, TN GOVT's DECISION SMELLS
OF SCAMS LIKE 2G and ...

Hi all !

I've been trying to connect to Mozilla's IRC Server - irc://irc.mozilla.org/ via xchat. But with no success. I'm using Fedora 15. It was listed in the Mozilla's IRC Wiki page that, we could connect to it via 6697 port as well as against the normal 6667. Still, no hope.

Can anyone help me with this please?

I am surprised at the coverage (or the lack thereof) on this news
especially after seeing pages after pages of eulogy for Steve Jobs
even in the local media. Sure, Dennis isn't as famous but he is the
father of 'C' - a language that still is as important as ever; touches
everyday life silently -- and a key contributor to Unix
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoVQTPbD6UY)  to which every modern
Operating System is indebted. As a great inventor who stood humble all
his life, he deserves a better farewell than what he is getting now.

Thank you very much Dennis, R.I.P.

Did it give you an error message?

It works for me. The 6667 port is for a non-ssl connection and the
6697 port is for a SSL connection. So make sure you are using the
right port. If you got that right and still not able to connect with
SSL turned on, check your openSSL configuration.

Also, after upgrading I'm unable to login using GUI, though I can login to
the console (Ctrl + Alt + F1). After entering password, it comes back to the
login screen but says so error message or anything. Lot more people seem to
experience the same[1].

Expecting a fix from Canonical soon.

OR it shows my status as connected, but then it doesn't actually get connected. I tried to use command, /join #remo to join the channel but I still find it impossible. Giving below the message that I got from xchat client window.

Connection details

Server - irc.mozilla.org/6667 or irc.mozilla.org/6697

If I use the 6697 port, I check the 'Use SSL for all the servers on this network option' and 'Accept invalid SSL certificate'

Either way, SSL or non-SSL, it doesn't work out.


Also, if I need to make some changes with the OpenSSL configuration, what do I have to do?

Thanks,

I had the same problem and got the same solution on search. This issue
of coming back to login is for existing accounts only and not for new
accounts.

When I use Ubuntu/Ubuntu2d, the pointer freezes often. Will search and
check how to solve this.

The upgrade downloaded 1.2GB and took 3 hours to upgrade post download!

In my experience upgrading Ubuntu always seems to create some sort of
trouble, while clean installation proceeds nicely. Trade-off between
carrying your settings and not being locked out of desktop login. ;-)

No. I had 2 accounts already - one that created during installation (with
sudo permission) and the other normal account. The login problem was only
for the sudo user; I could login to the other account with no problem.

Just curious, what is that .Xauthority file (the solution given in the link
in my previous reply)? How did removing that file solve the problem?

Even settings get transported as the home directory is maintained. It
is the pain of having to reinstall packages that was getting me to try
this for the first time. I've done fresh installs all along. It
certainly saves a whole lot of time.

Something to do with language settings as per the posts I saw.

It is a cookie file used for authorisation of clients to xserver, similar to
cookies used in browsers for user access.(

Subject: [Ilugc] Unable to install You tube downloader
Message-ID: <1318686811.3170.4.camel@debian>

Hi All

I run Debian 5.0 in a dual boot machine.

When I ran "apt-get install youtube-dl" as root,
it says "could not find package youtube-dl".

I saw in Synaptic package manager, metacafe-dl.
That installed without any problem.

What could be the problem?

Will the youtube-dl install only in DEbian 6.0?

Please help out.

Srikanth

If you cant find youtube-dl then there is an beautiful plug-in available for
Firefox called as "FlashGot".
It fetches all the videos, not only videos from youtube. I hope Firefox runs
in Debian without any problem :)

Looks like it's not packaged for Debian 5. But youtube-dl is just a
single python script that you can download from
http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/download.html

Here's the direct link for the latest version, if you want to wget it:
https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/raw/2011.09.30/youtube-dl

> Will the youtube-dl install only in DEbian 6.0?

Python 2.5+ is the only requirement for youtube-dl and it should work
everywhere Python 2.5+ is installed including Debian 5 (or even
Windows for that matter).

That's fine except for the fact he would not be able to schedule an
automated downloading from a shell script or chain it with other
command line tools.

Do you notice any specific error message when you run the following?

openssl s_client -connect irc.mozilla.org:6697

Ubuntu didn't include GNOME Shell by default and never will but Fedora
does.  You can't upgrade to a newer version of GNOME without upgrading
your distribution entirely

Hi

Try if your microphone is working fine with Gtalk. You can also check in the
chat settings page in gtalk if your microphone is recognized or not.

Hi

I too had a similar problem while upgrading to Ubuntu 11.04 from Ubuntu
10.10. I then went ahead and installed Ubuntu 10.04. Try and install Ubuntu
10.04 and your computer should work fine. Then try upgrading to Ubuntu 11.04
in case you want. I guess this will solve your problem.

When you re-installed 11.04, the Grub configuration may not have been
updated properly.
Boot from a Live CD and try this:

Dear Rajagopal

You ask them to pay for your stay and transportation. Please provide the
training free of cost. This is in turn good for the free software
community.

I will also check with my contacts for the same.

Dear All,

I have a friend in chennai - who is now doing 'serials' for Jaya Plus
& Raj TV (generally 'pattimandrams' and other simple ones).

I had discussed with him - about 6 months back, about doing a 20 to 30
minutes 'serial' on FOSS & FOSS related ones. since he was busy and i
have come back to mumbai - did not proceed much.

After meeting people in SFD 2011 - at IIT Powai, Also, since now many
students are going to get 'Laptops' from TN govt, a new audience (if
we can call them) may be enticed to see (and get benefitted) a series
of FOSS related things in TVs.

Though this may take a lot of time to even start (finding 'slots' with
TV, finding 'sponsors', finding 'topics', getting approved, finding
'Hosts', etc), my only question is 'WILL IT WORK (not only
commercially but also 'in the best interest of all').

If he goes ahead - he will be in touch with most of you (who are in
chennai), to make this into a shape.

- need your "unreserved remarks - without any bias".

If this is not even treated as a 'topic', I will not take this personally.

thanks (and sorry if I had wasted your time)

with warm regards

Yes, It will work !!
Provided  you do not confuse audience with FOSS and Other Tech Terminology.
Just do a plane "Tech Show" like gadget guru or other where you devote 60%
time on Web Tricks/Info and 40% time on Cross Platform Desktop application.
You yourself make sure that you show "only FOSS... "

This will definitely work, depending on how the program is designed.  My
suggestion would be NOT to go deep in to technological aspects, but to
provide a story line on FOSS, its history, and comparison of day to day
softwares in proprietary & open source.   Since many people would be in some
way using computers, we have to start from common people's mindset.  Like
how licensing costs affect business, and why pirated software may lead to
legal issues etc..

We can best use these TV time slots to create a perspective, opinion, and
subtle understanding of open source and FOSS among common masses.

If such TV program materialises, it will be a boost to open source
technologies.

Senthil

Dear luggies,

If there are any entrepreneurs amongst you looking for a superb office
space that can house around 10 people or less
 then I am vacating my office in Adyar near bus stand. It is in the
terrace without lift. But for an all boy company
 it won't be all that bad.

Interested ones can talk to Irshad Jeddy, office owner
(irshadjeddy at gmail.com +91-9380198430).

Area is 320 sq feet and rent is as much as you would expect in a nice
locality. ;)

Dear Sirs,

Yesterday I spoke to this chennai person:

- he says he can get first - a spot for 10 to 15 minutes - mainly in Jaya Plus.
- this spot will be for 1 days / week
- after seeing the response he will get for every day (if needed)
- he feels to "start with how students using the TN Laptop better
using all the tools"
- it may start with Microsoft (1 or 2 episodes)  - and then PAN into FOSS fully.
- he will be in touch with most of the ILUGC people, who would want to
give simple scripts and also anchor (which may or may not be
commerically)


As soon as he gets this spot, I will ask him to get in touch with one
of the ILUGC members (who can introduce others if needed whenever
necessary) - not disturbing everyone's time always.

In the meantime i feel let me not waste other's time in replying to this topic.

Thanks for your views now (and later too)

with warm regards

Dear Supporters,

 * Please join us in signing the statement: *Stand up for your freedom
  to install free software*
  <http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/statement>

The free software movement has come a long way over the past 25+
years. While we still face many challenges ahead for us to create a
world in which it is normal and expected for computer users to have
freedom, we have made steady progress. Right now, however, there is a
potential threat that could put us back years. Microsoft has announced
that if computer makers wish to distribute machines with the Windows 8
compatibility logo, they will have to implement a measure called
"Secure Boot."

When done correctly, "Secure Boot" is designed to protect against
malware by preventing computers from loading unauthorized binary
programs when booting. In practice, this means that computers
implementing it won't boot unauthorized or modified operating systems.
This could be a feature deserving of the name, as long as the *user*
is able to authorize the programs she wants to use, so she can run
free software written and modified by herself or people she trusts.

However, we are concerned that Microsoft and hardware manufacturers
will implement these boot restrictions in a way that will prevent
users from booting anything other than unmodified Windows. In this
case, a better name for the technology would be Restricted Boot, since
such a requirement would be a severe restriction on computer users and
not a security feature at all.

We're looking at a world in which it could become impossible for the
average user to install GNU/Linux on any new computer, so too much is
at stake for us to wait and see if computer manufacturers will do the
right thing. "Secure Boot" could all too easily become a euphemism for
restriction and control by computer makers and Microsoft -- freedom
and security necessitate users being in charge of their own computers.

So please, join us in signing this statement against Restricted Boot,
and consider encouraging your friends, family, and colleagues to do
the same.

If you are part of an organization or company that would like to
prominently show their support, please contact us at
<campaigns at fsf.org>.

For your convenience, here is a list of additional articles and
resources related to this statement:

IMHO, the speakers should decide how best to approach the session
since they see them as the expert, not your point of contact.

Dear sirs,

This is exactly the reason - the person will be in touch with ILUGC
(and who ever wants to participate in this - when it comes !!) - for
good script and if possible any video clippings which can be shown /
used (with due permission from the owner, etc).  This will (I want it
to be) be one more step for FOSS introduction to students / and any
user of Computers.

The first step is to get :

- a good "Spot" in a TV channel (when every channel is fighting to
show Serials!!)
- some sponsors for this show
- even the name of the serial will be debated a lot
- and what not !!

with warm regards

I was also doubtful about mdadm being able to support controlling the
hot swap bay LED.   I suspect the failed disk would be taken out of
the array by mdadm anyway.  I am not sure if disabling the disk would
be required.

I have concluded that it is best to go with a h/w raid controller.

Even if windows restricts, the open source community can overcome this by another boot loader.
Why install windows first?  Install Linux First, and then windows, so that Linux boot loader handles all boot startup?
Atleast that's how i do in my system..

I don't believe you understood the problem. Microsoft has total dominance
over the PC market. They have 95% of the market share. They can require the
hardware manufacturers to include _only_ their signing keys in the boot
loader. This would lock out their competition.

When booting the operating system this keys uses a protocol that is based on
public key cryptography to check the kernel and other components of the
system for integrity, if it fails the system wouldn't boot. You can no way
install GNU/Linux in such system.

Even if the hardware manufacturers agree to include signing keys of Linux
vendors, Still people who wish to run their own kernel won't be able to do
so.

Hi everyone,

We went live with the public alpha of our online Ruby training
program, RubyMonk (http://rubymonk.com) last night.

We are on the Hacker News (http://news.ycombinator.com/)
front page and would really appreciate your upvotes.

In just 90 minutes after the launch last night, 698 people
solved at least one exercise, with a total of 8404 exercises
solved!

Here are some of the interesting things about RubyMonk:

* Has book style content built around real code that you get to write
* Tests - all the code that you write has tests run against it (so you
get used to Red/Green early on)
* Problems and Exercises - learn ruby by studying content in a linear
manner, or by solving problems that cut across multiple chapters

It's early days yet, and much of the workflow is rather rough, but
we'd greatly appreciate your feedback so we can make it better.

Thanks,
Sidu.

Subject: [Ilugc] Routing through VPN connected machine
Message-ID: <CAM4qvdEhReDqMAr+sOPW430hGCgCvHzAiBkse5=tA_z8j5gEQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi
Is it possible to route a bunch of machines through a VPN connected machine?
If so what are the precautions I have to take ?
The scenario is like . I will get access to a web app through a VPN
connection. After establishing VPN connection in a machine the application
has to be accessible for some 10 20 machines in my net work.
If it is a dumb question forgive me

The question needs to be framed and asked with more information. E.g.
It would've helped a great deal if you had a network diagram that
describes how machines are connected.

I'm assuming you have a machine that has established a VPN connection
to another network. This means the routing on the other side is set to
proper working order. It is also assumed that the VPN machine can
reach the web while connected to the VPN.

In such a case, all machines in your network can set the VPN machine
as their gateway. The VPN machine, once connected to the VPN should
have the default route pointing to the VPN interface or to the IP of
the fartherside endpoint of the VPN. On the network on the other side,
the route must be set up to send packets destined to your local
network via the VPN tunnel.

Then what you want should work.

Did you try LTSP?

BTW, pardon my ignorance, you meant "ten to twenty" or "One thousand
and twenty" machines? Dumb question? so be it.

IMHO, No question is dumb or stupid. Answers could be though sometimes.

     discuss how the pickling protocols (0,1,2, and 3) work as well as
     real-world issues (gotchas, backwards-compatibility, etc). We
     will concentrate on the basics of this stack-based protocol: what
     it looks like, how to encode/decode, speeds of different
     implementations.

Dear Friends,

Community Computing Center, an initiative of Free Software Foundation, Tamil
Nadu, to facilitate the underprivileged masses with the technology.

Life without information technology is unimaginable for many of us. Yet an
entire generation is growing up without access to any of the tools that are
so much a part of our lives.

Volunteers have found two possible places for Community Computing Center in
Chennai, Tambaram Sanatorium with around 150 families, and Mylapore with
around 5000 families.

With the team of 30+ passionate volunteers working on syllabus and course
materials as phase one, to implement the first Community Computing Center to
the earliest.

We need volunteers who speak in Tamil to teach students. We invite every one
to help us by donating money/time or both.

Share this with your friends and help us get more volunteers, Lets do our
bit for our society.

>From their onwards Ubuntu was a grant success with more than 20
million users across the glob. A totally free and open source
operating system attains much popularity than any other similar
proprietary operating systems with in seven years. This is a
remarkable achievement by the humanity behind Ubuntu operating system.

People who dedicated their free times to write code, test and use the
operating system and Cannonical Ltd. made it possible. And they
continues the journey to serve the humanity with better Operating
System that satisfies the computing needs of ?Common Man?.

Kudos to the entire team behind Ubuntu !!!

Message-ID: <4EA03E30.8020706@gmail.com>

Howdy everyone,

The Microsoft Corporation is pushing computer makers to implement a 
feature called "Secure Boot" in order to get that "Windows 8 compatible" 
label on their machines. The FSF has shown concerns over this 
development as they are apprehensive that this feature might make it 
hard for users to install other operating systems like GNU+Linux.

What now ?. Well, the FSF is sending a statement (a petition) to the 
computer manufacturers asking them to carefully implement this Secure 
Boot feature ( FSF is labeling this feature as "Restricted Boot") so 
such that it will be completely possible to install & use operating 
systems like GNU+Linux on these new machines.

You may sign the petition by going here : http://ur1.ca/5fg95

I regret my ignorance to understand the etiquette of this list. It also

What does this have to do with ilugc ? This is purely commercial.

Just a gentle advice, Please refrain from posting advertisement or 
commercials, there is enough in mainstream media already.

For networking type questions you *must* invest the time and give a
topology of your network.  'dia' is an excellent tool to accomplish
the task.

Otherwise, you will be clueless as to what to ask and the people who
are trying to help will unable to do so.

A picture is worth a thousand words - at least in the case of networks.

In a publicity stunt to create buzz around the upcoming biography 
written by Walter Isaacson, some stories from the book have been 
released. One, which was certain to make round on the Internet was Steve 
Jobs' misplaced belief that Google stole Android from Apple.

Hi

How to configure Apache 2.2.x to resolve a IP address for multiple hostnames on both LAN & WAN? Is it feasible?

(e.g.) Parent domain name: "peter.alex.com" using both LAN & WAN (192.168.1.2, 127.242.116.226) ---usual scenario.

With child domain name it is supposed to be resolvable to "xavier.alex.com using LAN IP of 192.168.1.3 whereas on WAN it should be resolvable to two same host name of peter.alex.com and xavier.alex.com using same WAN IP of 127.242.116.226.

In a nutshell...as follows,

192.168.1.2  TO peter.alex.com
192.168.1.3  TO xavier.alex.com

127.242.116.226 TO both peter.alex.com & xavier.alex.com

If it is achievable, kindly share your valuable thoughts with me.

Hi

There is a movie Pirates of silicon valley. The movie is based on the life
of Bill gates and Steve jobs and according to the movie both Windows and Mac
are not the operating systems that was created by respective companies. They
bought or stole from others and also a major chunk of windows was stolen
from macintosh. Watch the movie it is interesting.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley

Only Linux and open source does not have such controversies.

For domain name testing the domains example.{org,net,com} have been
reserved.  Choosing alex.com, although not owned by anybody at the
time of writing this, is not the right way to setup your DNS server
(IMO).

Perhaps, the "views" feature of BIND9 might give the solution you are
looking for:

<http://www.bind9.net/manual/bind/9.3.2/Bv9ARM.ch06.html#view_statement_grammar>

> With child domain name it is supposed to be resolvable to "xavier.alex.com using LAN IP of 192.168.1.3 whereas

Two different FQDNs resolving to a single IP is allowed in BIND9.
How the FQDNs get resolved depends on your BIND configuration.

> If it is achievable, kindly share your valuable thoughts with me.

Suggest you read up BIND docs, configure it and test all the perms and
combos of FQDNs before you start using the server in conjunction with
Apache.

Please do post the solution that works for you.

You didn't mention the version of Fedora you are using.   Fedora does
have Blender 2.6

http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=1400

However, older versions of Fedora don't typically have the latest
version of Blender

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Updates_Policy

If you want, you could try Blender built for a newer version of Fedora
or grab the srpm and rebuild it on your local system.

  It is always a good idea to use package management software instead of
manually installation. As a last resort, try to enable the appropriate
repositories behind  fedora15. Try enabling the latest repositories by
changing the "Options" in yumex or the usual  package manager in Fedora15.
Then see if the libraries you need are listed. If not, then do it manually.

+1. Read up BIND docs. There is a feature called split horizon
configuration where the zone lookup is done based on the
subnet/interface from where the query arrives.

However, for your need, I think just name based virtualhost would work
if you are just looking at hosting site. Why are you keen on resolving
the host names to specific IP addresses?

Can't you use CNAME? Or just add a separate A record?

This has nothing to do with split horizon.

Even 1000 domains can resolve to the same IP.

Only same domain resolving to two different IP is addressed in split horizon DNS

I am not sure whether I understand your question correctly. Why do you 
need apache to resolve the hostname ? Do you need the DNS resolution as 
a part of a server side script or something similar ?

Also, 127.242.116.226 is a loopback address (127.0.0.0/8), I am not 
quite sure what you are trying to achieve.

$ traceroute 127.242.116.226
traceroute to 127.242.116.226 (127.242.116.226), 30 hops max, 60 byte 
packets
  1  127.242.116.226 (127.242.116.226)  0.475 ms  0.027 ms  0.026 ms

It will help if you can give more details and if you are not aware of 
the special addresses, you can find here on wiki,

Right.  There are a few different options when the release you are using
doesn't have the latest version but a newer Fedora release does

* Upgrade to a newer release of Fedora

* yum --releasever=N update foo, where N=15 or 16.

* Download the SRPM and use yum-builddep to get the dependencies and use
rpmbuild to rebuild the binary against the release you are using

utf8_common_cli ?  Never heard that one before; even SHOW COLLATION is
not listing it. Did you mean utf8_general_ci ?

You may have to use utf8_unicode_ci (which implements the Unicode
Collation Algorithm as described here:

Hi

I have taken 127.... as an example but I should have chosen some other number other than 127.242..which is loopback address. However, the requiement is as such it stands.

It was with Compiz Configuration Settings Manager where Ubuntu Unity Plugin
was disabled somehow and i just enabled it and got it back.

I just used this command in terminal "ccsm" to open the Compiz configuration
settings manager and this just put a check box in it and even i have updated
in my blog too. Here it is the link :

Hello,

Unfortunately, we're having trouble understanding your question. Let us
see if we can work it out. First of all, resolution works in the
opposite way to what you seem to believe. You resolve a domain name to
an IP address.

I will attempt to restate your problem and you can say if that is right.
Then we can attempt to solve it.

You have a domain name (example.com) and two subdomains on it
(a.example.com and b.example.com). You want the following to happen:

1. When a user attempts to access a.example.com and b.example.com from a
LAN that you control, you want them to go to 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3
respectively.

2. When a user attempts to access a.example.com or b.example.com from
outside your LAN, you want them to go to 203.0.113.1 (assume this to be
the WAN IP of your server)

Is this what you want to do? Well, the question is, where is the
nameserver for example.com? If you want the same nameserver to serve up
different records based on the origin network of the request, then using
split-horizon will work fine. However, if you have one nameserver on the
Internet (say your host provides one) that already resolves example.com
and subdomains to 203.0.113.1, then let that be. Run a nameserver on
your local network, add a zone to it each for a.example.com and
b.example.com and give them A records pointing to 192.168.1.2 and
192.168.1.3 respectively. 

Also, you might want to check with the network admins at IITM. They have
some solution for the problem since ftp.iitm.ac.in resolves to different
addresses depending on the origin network of the request.

May i know using which tool you created it? From which operating system you
created the live media?

You can use the Startup-Disk creater which is present by default in Ubuntu
and fedora, or use Unetbootin tool from any linux distro and create a live
thumb.

How long does it go on - creating a flavor, abandoning before seeing light
of the day, merge it with another and repeat the cycle...

Surely does affect the moral of the core developers.

These are a couple of very fast mirrors for most distros (they are
also in close sync with the parent upstream)

Dear FOSSouls,


I have just come across an interesting online FOSS compiler and interpreter

Dear Luggies,

A friend of mine has this following query and he needs answer from our
community, Please suggest him and here is his query within quotes:

"i need to use software for drafting, 3D modelling and rendering then more
importantly Analysis and designs( Column load carrying capacity etc.). These
are the softwares which are used in windows (Auto cadd - drafting, 3D
modeling - REVIT/3DS max, structural analysis - STAAD PRO).. As i use
linuxi couldn't use those and am searching for the equivalent
softwares in
linux."

I have already shown him QCAD, SweetHome3D and am not sure about Blender. He
needs a STAAD Program.

I haven't used any of these tools, but from the experience of my friends,
QCad is good for drafting. Also they use OpenFoam for analysis of fluid
dynamics and such stuff (I'm not sure if that's what your friend needs).

Apolgies for butting in.

I had recoded the Structural Analysis program from Fortran to Pascal circa 1994.

It is a part of a product built by Indian Engineer for Indian
conditions. It is known as Build-Master by Ensoft Consultants, Mumbai.
Very inexpensive compared to Staad.

I am not sure it has FEA capabilities as due to DOS, I was forced to
recode it for only two node elements (Grid, truss and frame) It
generates drawings in DXF format.

I have to say it is proprietary. It's been a while since I had done
that and I have not checked recently whether it runs on Linux.

In the 80s, I remember Prof.CSK's dept having a homegrown FEA package
(Fortran) for standard elements used in civil structures (did not have
shells then I think). Maybe someone could take that and port it on
Linux rewritten in a  different language.

DXF imports are relatively easy to write too.

Just for information, He was the doctoral advisor of Raj Reddy who was the
doctoral advisor of James Gosling - the father of Java.

IIRC, the module I rewrote was based on Gere & Weaver book.

No. It is not Richard Gere of Shilpa shetty kissing fame.

Hi all,

Last week Arabic Wikipedians organized Arabic Wikipedia Convening (WMF Blog
Report [1]) hosted by Qatar Computing Research Institute at Doha. Since the
Qatar Institute was looking at options on machine / manual translation to
increase articles on Arabic Wikipedia, they had invited a Tamil Wikipedia -
Google translation coordinator to learn from the experiences of other
communities which did a large scale project. User:Sodabottle presented on
the community experiences and learnings[2].

Hi all,

Wikimedia would be a starting new project "WikiData". Details here[1] . I am
particularly excited about how the interwiki data and "API"  is made
available and hope it would be immense use to all Indic languages, many
possibilities of mashups, data extractions might be easier with the
infrastructure. Sundar's idea to target Indic users using interwiki
metadata, apps like interwikiredirector[2], can benefit significantly out of
this. We shall look forward to hear more details on the project and wish all
the success both technically, community wise.

Hi all,

     I'm planning to attend the Wikipedia Conference to be held in
Mumbai from 18th to 20th October 2011. I just wanted to know if anyone
from ILUGC would also be going there. Further discussion can be moved

Hi,

     I have a small requirement, I'd like to set up a video stream in
my school, from one room to another. It doesn't need to be streaming
technically, as it'll be only a short-term arrangement, for the
culturals.

     I thought of using X over SSH and using cheese to get the video
out-put from the webcam. Alternately I though of using VNC, but i
don't know if it'd be feasible to transfer video output through VNC.
Any comments/ suggestions are welcome. :-)

Did you try vlc? You do both unicast & multicast streaming.

Interestingly this is no small thing but it is doable with your technical
knowledge.

No, Just X over LAN will itself not work; with ssh it will definitely not work.

If you want video multicast over LAN you can try RTSP protocol.

You can look at live555.

http://www.live555.com/

Even though it is a .com domain it is 100% free.

I have programming experience but no practical experience with video multicast.

HTTP streaming is also a good option for this.

As to using VNC it is a great idea but VLC is better. ;)

VLC comes built in with RTSP and HTTP streaming support.

VLC with just UDP/RTP would do. Select UDP(legacy) at producer end, input
the client machine's ip address and select a port(1234 - default).
At the client side enter "vlc udp://@:<port_no>". Done. This should work
perfectly fine for a fixed address machine in a LAN.

I'm not sure, but there is a way with gst-launch, see gst-launch(1). In
that man page, section PIPELINE EXAMPLES have a subsection 'Network
Streaming', it gives the exact commandline.

However, we need to install packages which will provide those gst
elements in that gst pipeline. 'ffmpeg' is a must.

I doubt if it will work. These are USB connected internal devices and
need drivers.
as far as I'm aware, these devices use a Broadcom chip. Apart from
this, the windows login module has been integrated with this device
specifically.

Message-ID: <CAFe1ooJFQZHTJOKqiqC6+_u32qLhjeOvDhQ=6Riq869R0rkdpw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This is my scenario:
* A master database in the internet with data from multiple office branches.
* Each branch office has sporadic access to the internet. Hence sections of
the database need to be stored offline in the branch.
* Every evening, the head office should be a able to view/modify/delete data
from the branches (only operate on the master database) (changes from branch
uploaded in evening).
* Next day morning the branch office should be able to see updated database.
(download the modified contents overnight or early morning)

Both the master database and the branch run on Linux.

To my knowledge, I understand that MySQL replication is a one-way street.
One master many slave system and slaves only sync themselves to the master
and the master does not sync itself to the slaves. Am i wrong?

Any simple solution for this?

Regards,
Arun

If you are not bound to MySQL and RDBMS, do have a look at CouchDB.

Is there anything that is stopping you from reading the mailing list 
guidelines (http://www.ilugc.in/content/mailinglist-guidelines/) and 
avoid top posting? Interleaved, trimmed posting style is the 
recommended one. So *do not top post*.

This solves the update on the master side. With binlogs option in MySQL this
is very simple. It beautifully stores all the operations done and we can
replay it on the master. The problem is mainly on the reverse side as I dont
want to send mega bytes of unwanted updates on the non related branches to
all brances.

My wireless device is made by Broadcom and in additional Drivers it detected
and working fine. Do you know any driver that support my Finger Print Reader
although am not sure about who is the manufacturer. Thanks for your reply
too :-)

Now we are talking about distributed database with two phase commits etc.

Oracle of course has this feature. At a Price of course.

I am not sure MySQL does it. Checkout PostgreSQL.

Just now i tried to find the name of the manufacturer for my FingerPrint
Reader using 'lsusb' command and here is the output that gives the name:


Bus 001 Device 003: ID 138a:0005 Validity Sensors, Inc. VFS301 Fingerprint
Reader


Its Validity Sensors, Inc. and when i surfed on their site i found this
statement:

"Does the Validity fingerprint sensor support Linux based operating systems?

Validity does not offer Linux drivers and software direct to consumers. We
are working with our qualified software partners to develop Linux based
solutions. If you are a software developer and want to become a qualified
Validity solution provider for Linux-based solutions, visit
http://www.validityinc.com/solution_providers.aspx "

It looks like even though if they develop the driver for Linux Operating
Systems, it is not going to be FOSS driver, So is there any Free open source
driver that supports this device? Even i tried with pam_fprint , it does not
detects the device. From this issue i feel like i wanted to develop my own
driver for this hardware but don't know anything about how to program for
Linux drivers. All i know is Linux Device Drives has .so extension.

Any sort of help is welcome, either recommending any other driver for this
device or helping me to get started with Linux Device Driver development for
this driver. Thanks for reading this with patience.

You will require their hardware specification/data sheet. From the
partnership page, I assume that they expect you to sign an NDA, and
hence you might not be able to reveal the hardware details.

Linux device driver files have .ko extension.

IMHO, this is not something that should be solved by the database
software. This is something that the application should solve.

The application should be architected in such a way that, it syncs up
with the head-quarters when requested.

Ok fine.. so let me try with some other compatible drivers and even Validity
Sensors, Inc. is currently working with the development of the driver for
Ubuntu and have said it will be released soon. So waiting for that too and
They have already developed a driver for OpenSuse and it is in rpm package
and i even compiled it to .deb format using Alien but don't know how to use
it.

Message-ID: <CAEsGRy_B2uaL7wpm4V1fSGAmTg6XX45smHi4SCuv68OWf+COhA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We have run our Java community(http://jugchennai.in) for an year and we have
found that  not many women had participated in our regular meeting. reasons
are many....

To accomplish this, we have planned to form a Java women community in
Chennai, run and managed only by women.http://jugchennai.in/jduchess/ This
group is part of International JDuchess group. http://jduchess.org/

Currently this group is a virtual forum, once we form a good number of
members and a active leader we plan to organize monthly meetings, workshop
etc.

Feel free to join both Facebook and Google group. The site give the
difference between 2 groups. We are currently selecting a good women lead
for this group. once its done then the real activity will be started.

If you are women and you live in and around Chennai and love to learn and
share Java experience feel free to join.

Feel free to share this URL ( .http://jugchennai.in/jduchess/ ) with your
friends. For any further contact, please mail me.

Hi Prasanna,

I would like to help you in developing the driver. I have worked in
developing USB drivers in windows. I guess I could do similar task. I can
provide a user space module instead of a kernel driver as it is very easy to
develop User space app for the device using libusb. If you think I can help
you it will be great. I longed for developing open source software and I
would consider this as an opportunity.

Thanks,
Prasanna Kumar

Connect the camera to the computer and click menu button in the camera.
Click on USB connect and select PTP. This should work. It worked for me. I
am using Ubuntu 10.04 and I am using Sony Cybershot DSC-W35.

Thanks all for pitching in to help!
I am not in a position to change the database software from MySQL.

I guess the only way to do it is programmatically record all the changes at
the master side (all SQL update/insert/delete commands) on a per branch
basis and send that information for playback at the branch databases.

Hello All,

I use ubuntu.

I run some background processes from time to time.

I start the processes like below from my terminal.

perl script1.pl &

Subject: [Ilugc] [ILUGC] Let's all join in on Diaspora!
Message-ID: <CAHAVp8atwLSazUuBCjmb+kRmj_Kgis20fqi02ONHFPLtuiXngQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ILUGC,

I am a little embarrassed to say that although I've been a member of the LUG
for quite a while, I haven't contributed much to the mailing lists. As a
matter of fact, I think this is my first thread! So, in the same "noob"ish
fashion that new members, I'd like to say that I am sorry I am not abiding
by the Code of conduct. I want to make up for the lost time. So, let's get
to the topic at hand:

All of us who are dying to get a Diaspora login can get one right now! -
Yes, right now at diasp.org for free obviously.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with Diaspora, let me explain - It is an
open-source peer based social networking platform. It is like facebook or
G-plus, but you control all you data. You own all your data and have full
control over the privacy! No more corporate muscle people. The democracy of
the social network is here. Become it's netizens now!

If you get a membership at one diaspora pod (servers) you can access members
of all pods, ie., I have a membership at diasp.org but you can have your
diaspora id on your own private pod but I can still connect with you. This
holds good for all pods. Even the first official pod by the developers (
joindiaspora.com) runs connected to all! It's not like you can't with you
orkut friends from facebook! It's a universal platform.

You can get a list of a lot of featured pods and their up-times at
podupti.me.
You can also learn more about the structure and working about diaspora on
diasporafoundation.org.
Ruby on Rails experts can also start contributing to the project via code.
By the way, I missed the RoR session from last week and I'd love to have an
encore session.

Getting to the social side of it, I just opened up a chennai MAD(IASPO)RAS
meetup at our meeting next month! (12th November, 2011). The link is
here(meetup) <http://www.meetup.com/Diaspora/Chennai-IN/>. Please join in
and populate both diaspora and the meetup. (And oh, I hope the
office-bearer(s) doesn't/don't mind. :P)

I have also just started (i really mean just now. So, it's still being
modified) a blog for the Chennai diaspora community at
wordpress.com<https://madiasporas.wordpress.com/> and
I want some help from some "ruby" and "ruby on rails" devs as well as good
bloggers to help populate the blog with a lot of useful stuff on diaspora
both for users and other devs. I would love it if we get recognized as a hub
of activity for diaspora-chennai.

Cheers,
Suraj.

PS. I am really sorry for the long post though!

If you plan to implement the above. I think the following information
would be helpful. Mysql maintains a binlog file ( as specified in
my.cnf configuration file) which has a log of all mysql db changes
made. So having a application to reading it and updating the db would
be far easier than having to write a application to record all db
changes and relaying to the master db.

You can use inotify to detect changes. Whenever there is a change in a file
an event will be generated by the system. Your application can register for
that event and do necessary things, in other time the application can sit
idle (wait for the event without using any system resources).

Message-ID: <5e55a78733b07bfda3286ae00a308701.squirrel@www.glug4muz.org>

Hi,
 Myself Pankaj Kumar, working as a faculty in the MCA(Master in Computer
Applications) Course of B. R. Ambedkar Bihar University, Muzaffarpur,
Bihar, India (http://www.brabu.net/) on contract basis is also
maintaining GNU/Linux User Group (http://www.glug4muz.org/) for my home
town. I am spreading knowledge about GNU/Linux O/S to the student
community as well as other members of my society. Due to this reason
maximum computers are being sold only after installation of at least any
one version of GNU/Linux O/S. I started working on Red Hat Linux, then to
Fedora, then to Open SUSE and now a day I am working on Arch Linux. I
have installed Arch Linux on more than 50 computers without taking any
money for this. I am also not taking money for any help required by any
one in this environment. For my survival, I am earning  very little
amount (Rs. 8000 per month ~ $175 per month) from University and some
money by taking projects from http://www.freelancer.com/ in the LAMP
environment with identity of ccpplinux
(http://www.freelancer.com/users/30055.html). Now I want to expand this
project execution process by involving more and more students in this
work so that I can attract maximum students towards this operating
system. For that purpose I have divided the current running projects in
different modules and assigned them to three different students. You can
have a look at this distribution of work and money at
http://www.glug4muz.org/jobs_projects.php and then clicking on any
running project name. This process has attracted several students to work
with me due to transparency in work and money distribution. I think it
will further make popular the GNU/Linux O/S among the student community.
But now I am facing the problem of computers on which more and more
students will work on these projects. At this moment I am having only two
desktop computers on which students are working in shifts. But if I will
get any old and used computers or laptops then I am confident that I can
utilize them by installing Arch Linux on those computers and starting
development work in LAMP environment on them. I am confident that with my
present level of income I can maintain these old computers by earning
from them but I am NOT having so much money in hand that I can purchase
at least 5 new computers and start working on them to spread popularity
of GNU/Linux O/S. If any one of you are interested in donating old and
used computer for this purpose then please contact me. It will really
help me a lot and I will remain thankful to you for this forever. It will
also increase my confidence about support of GNU/Linux User Groups for
the development of this excellent environment of this world. If you know
any other person or organization which can be interested in donating used
computers / laptops then please forward this mail to them. I shall remain
thankful for this forever.

job in this regard. Other central and state government funded institutions
must come up with such an infrastructure. I studied in Anna university
chennai a state government funded institution. There even though they use
Linux there is no sufficient funding for providing a mirror. Hope this
changes.

Hi,

     I have a HP laptop and the fingerprint reader works fine in
fedora, but not so in Ubuntu... so perhaps the driver is already
there... :-)

oh great.. Who is the manufacturer of your Finger Print Reader?
Can you say which version of fedora are you using.
And in Validity Sensor's Website they have provided a Linux device driver
for the device but it is in rpm package and i think this is reason it works
in fedora, i tried to convert it to deb package using Alien, successfully
converted but it does not detects or i am not sure whether i am using it in
a correct way.

I'm not the person who you asked this question of, but my fingerprint
reader works just fine with `fprint`. If you're looking specifically for
a fingerprint reader that works with Linux, the best place to look is at
the list of supported devices for `fprint`:
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fprint/libfprint/Supported%
20devices

For instance, my reader `ID 0483:2016 SGS Thomson Microelectronics
Fingerprint Reader` is on that list and works fairly well with PAM and
Gnome in general. Unfortunately, support isn't as robust as in Windows
and so I can only use one finger to login (as opposed to the experience
on Windows where any registered finger will work).

I tried already with fprint but it did not detect my device and that is the
reason i posted in LUG.
Even i tried with libpam and it din't work. My device manufacturer is
Validity Sensor's Inc, and they have recently announced that their current
team is working for this driver to support in ubuntu operating system and
will be available next year. In the mean while am trying for some other
compatible drivers. Thanks for your reply sir.
