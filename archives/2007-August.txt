Hi,
Though I am using Firefox, I am forced to go to internet explorer atleast
to view this news site(http://thatstamil.oneindia.in).

When I see this site(tamil site) in Internet explorer, it shows in a
nicely readable format.
But when I see the same site in Firefox, though I could read, it is highly
difficult to read format(shows differently).

Can someone who knows what to do for fixing this can help me, so as to
read as nicely as it shows in Internet Explorer.

It is difficult to explain how it is difficult to read the site in Firefox
for that site. Please see in both the browsers, you will definitely
understand what I am meaning.

I used Firefox version - Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US;
rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6

and Internet Explorer version - 6.0.2900.2180.xpsp_sp2_gdr.070227-2254

thanks

Message-ID: <e43212340708010105l1c932aacxfff387a8abcafbbf@mail.gmail.com>

In Windows2000,
                       I use Single (realtek) eathernet card for class B and
Class C network without changing IP addresses in Local area connection
TCP/IP address.
That is First, I load Main Static IP by
       Start -->Settings--> My network places--> area connection
Here click properties, In new Window, selecting 'TCP/IP' and press
'Properties'

              192.168.42.3
              255.255.255.0
              192.168.42.100
Keep blank in DNS server addresses. and press Advanced tab,
                  In new Window, I add
Both Class b, C Ip adresses, subnet masks and gate ways.
      Then press ok for each windows (Save and Exit).

After that, In command prompt, I give the following commands,

c:\> route -p add 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 192.168.42.100
c:\> route -p add 172.20.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 172.20.16.1

        Here third IP is Gateway.

 Now system working for both networks. But not at a time for both. U can use
only Class b network and complete the job then u can go to Class C network.
For example, we can browse the web page of only Class b and close it then we
browse class C web page.

   Is it possible in Redhat Linux System?
If it is possible please post the script how to do it.

Hi Arnold,

I tried that, but then I am getting following error :

STOCADDRT: Network<http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=326465#>is

I already disabled loopback address before executing those route commands.

Thanks,

You will need to create virtual interface eg. eth0:0
And you will need to enable IP forwarding

Message-ID: <9a9bfc170708011247k28ba15d1va1ddbe4b47bc9877@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

[ I sent this mail and I guess it didn't reach the list. So sending
again.. Sorry if it appears in duplicate ]

I got a Nokia 3110 Classic recently and have been running into
problems using it with Linux through the USB (micro USB 2.0) interface
the phone provides...

I use a custom kernel... This is `uname -a`

Linux moonface 2.6.21-viper3 #3 PREEMPT Tue Jun 26 15:23:33 IST 2007
i686 GNU/Linux

I use Debian Testing.

When I connect the device, the mobile detects that it has been
connected, and asks me the mode to choose (Nokia mode/USB
storage/PictBridge). I chose Nokia mode (haven't tested the USB
storage mode as yet as I don't have the add on micro SD card)

dmesg however doesn't seem to get excited...

usb 2-2: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 8
usb 2-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice

and no further messages...

The userland apps (Gnokii and Gammu) both expect a serial device to
read/write to... I should expect /dev/ttyUSB0 to pop up, udev being
there, but nothing like that happens...

I manually modprobe usbserial, and repeat process... Same results...

This is what lsusb shows

Bus 002 Device 009: ID 0421:005e Nokia Mobile Phones

Taking a cue from Documentation/usb/usb-serial.txt, I rmmod usbserial, and do...

$ modprobe usbserial vendor=0x0421 product=0x005e

I reconnect the device, and this time a lot of messages get thrown up...

usb 2-2: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 9
usb 2-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
usbserial_generic 2-2:1.0: generic converter detected
usbserial_generic 2-2:1.0: Generic device with no bulk out, not allowed.
usbserial_generic: probe of 2-2:1.0 failed with error -5

(repeat last three lines for 2-2:1.1 to 2-2:1.9)

usb 2-2: generic converter now attached to ttyUSB1
usbserial_generic 2-2:1.11: generic converter detected
usbserial_generic 2-2:1.11: Generic device with no bulk out, not allowed.
usbserial_generic: probe of 2-2:1.11 failed with error -5

(repeat last three lines for 2-2:1.12 to 2-2:1.14)

/dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1 are anyway created and accessible (I am
a member of dialout and gnokii groups), so I try the apps anyway

$ gammu --identify
Error setting device DTR or RTS.

(Error Code: 255)

$ gnokii --identify
GNOKII Version 0.6.14

(and then it hangs there)

Could some one throw light on this?

it moves on...

Did you ask Nokia for the Linux drivers?

These are the modes in which the phone should operate in.

Is cdc_acm driver loaded?

That is correct. You might also want to try Wammu:
http://wammu.eu/

If and only if it presents the Communications Device Class Abstract
Control Model (CDC-ACM) interface to the host.

> I manually modprobe usbserial

Did you modprobe cdc_acm? Do it before you plug the phone.

> This is what lsusb shows

Because, USB device enumeration has succeeded.

You need BULK OUT and BULK IN endpoints to transfer AT commands and
receive responses.

> usb 2-2: generic converter now attached to ttyUSB1
> usbserial_generic 2-2:1.11: generic converter detected

Install gtkterm or open minicom, and connect to /dev/ttyUSB1. Try to
type AT commands. For example:

AT<hit-enter>
OK
AT+CGMI<hit-enter>
Nokia

> usbserial_generic 2-2:1.11: Generic device with no bulk out, not allowed.

Because the AT command didn't know the unknown BULK OUT endpoint to
send the data to?

Hi!

Half expected the USB guru of the list to solve this problem for me :D

> Did you ask Nokia for the Linux drivers?

Nope.. May be I should...

> Is cdc_acm driver loaded?

Ah! This was what I was looking for. Some module which I didn't have a
clue about and hence omitted from my kernel config. Things worked once
I compiled and loaded the module... Thanks :)

> That is correct. You might also want to try Wammu:
> http://wammu.eu/

Wammu is good, but seems buggy. I need a nice interface for editing
all fields of my contact list.. Wammu isn't that convenient (neither
is xgnokii) and is buggy also (Doesn't actually save all fields).

I tried gmobilemedia also, but it says my model is not supported. I am
at a loss to know what it's problem could be, when libgammu doesn't
have one :)

Yet to find a nice interface... That's the summary.. Anyway, that's an
userland problem. If I don't succeed in finding one, I guess I will in
typical Linux geekish way end up writing a shell or a perl script :D

it moves on...

Hi!

Half expected the USB guru of the list to solve this problem for me :D

> Did you ask Nokia for the Linux drivers?

Nope.. May be I should...

> Is cdc_acm driver loaded?

Ah! This was what I was looking for. Some module which I didn't have a
clue about and hence omitted from my kernel config. Things worked once
I compiled and loaded the module... Thanks :)

> That is correct. You might also want to try Wammu:
> http://wammu.eu/

Wammu is good, but seems buggy. I need a nice interface for editing
all fields of my contact list.. Wammu isn't that convenient (neither
is xgnokii) and is buggy also (Doesn't actually save all fields).

I tried gmobilemedia also, but it says my model is not supported. I am
at a loss to know what it's problem could be, when libgammu doesn't
have one :)

Yet to find a nice interface... That's the summary.. Anyway, that's an
userland problem. If I don't succeed in finding one, I guess I will in
typical Linux geekish way end up writing a shell or a perl script :D

it moves on...

How did you find this? Using 'free' command?

A kernel parameter will help you indicate the RAM to OS.

mem=nn[KMG] [KNL,BOOT] force use of a specific amount of
            memory; to be used when the kernel is not able
            to see the whole system memory or for test.

You have add this in the grub file (/boot/grub/menu.lst)

kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.20-8 ro root=/dev/hda1 mem=2G
                                           ^^^^^^

To interact with applications, you will need software that can support
SYNCML [1]. Most phones use that. You can also look at Funambol [2].

gammu was forked from gnokii2. I don't like the CamelCase coding
style. It is a strain for my eyes.

There is a cquery Perl script from:

ftp://gatling.ikk.sztaki.hu/pub/samsem/
http://gatling.ikk.sztaki.hu/~kissg/gsm/

It is under public domain.

Get together, invite all ILUGC, users-iitm folks, and ask them to
bring their USB phones. Plug it in on Debian. Test connectivity with
your Perl script. Make the application rock solid. Call it the "Plug
n' Play" project, or give it a good project name.

Have fun,

Sir,
     I wrote a small script for Auto shutdown in Linux. I add this in
/etc/crontab for proper functioning. It is working in root user only. How
can i do this in all normal users?
    I can not make an console message for all user about auto shutdown
startup. Hence i included 5 minutes delay in shutdown that makes itself
console message to other ttys and remote users in SSH. But it is not make an
alert to WinSCP users.
   My script is as below.

#! /bin/bash
# /bin/bash
su -C "shutdown -h 5"    ( 5 minute relay time)

Anybody help me to rectify the above problems? ie  Run level change to all
users and Console message to all ttys and GUI users.

Hello all..

One of my friend wants to record some of his voice with microphone in
debian. He is using *cmi8738 4-channel* sound card.
He tried with [1] sound-recorder [2] krec [3] audacity. But, his debian
cannot take input with microphone. Every option of his microphone is on.
But, he cannot do it. And as i can realize, his microphone is not actually
taking voices as input but his microphone is ok.

Can you please help him to do it?

Best,
Zico

Have you tried unmuting the mic input?

Have you tried with sox? (http://sox.sourceforge.net)?

Did you do a dd or cat of /dev/dsp to a file and try to play with
'play'?

Have you tried recording from line in?

I have never had problems working with sound recording on linux.

I have had noise issues but I could use skype and record voice using a 
microphone.

This sox command line should do it for you.

$ sox -t ossdsp /dev/dsp -w -c 1 -t wav voice.wav

But before that, check your mixer settings with rexima or aumix.

Best of luck!

Girish

that is the mistake - if every option on the mic is on, the input  
from the mic goes to the headset/speakers. In kmix, put the red  
button under the mic on and the green button above the mic off

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0708031306160.667-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

The interoperability and patent deals between Microsoft and various
Linux distributors and other companies became a hot topic in the Linux
world recently. After several articles were printed speculating that
Mandriva might be the next to sign such a deal, we decided to make a
definitive statement to remove any doubt about the issue: we will not
sign any patent agreement with Microsoft. We believe properly defined,
open industry standards are the best route to interoperability, and
that Microsoft has yet to demonstrate any plausible claims of patent
infringement in Linux. The full statement by Mandriva CEO Francois
Bancilhon is available here:

Dear Francis,

     I am afraid this is for OpenBSD but it should be very similar.

     http://www.openbsd.org/papers/opencon06-umts/index.html

     The good news is that the firmware does all the dirty work for you
     so the host computer never has to worry about any wireless protocol 
     handling.

     All you have to do is hook up the serial/USB port to use the
     right baud rates and other stuff ( comm bet host and modem).
     
     Best of luck!

regards,
Girish
PS : I dunno any further than this as I have not even seen the

Dear luggies

On 1 Aug 07 on behalf of ILUGC, I made a presentation in Murgappa
Polytechnic College, Avadi on Introduction to FOSS.

Similarly one more presentation was done in CN.Polytechnic, Vepery on
3rd Aug.

In both it was for 3rd year students.

The level of interest and awarness are similiar to Engg colleges -
few tried, few aware and majority don't know. 

However, few students in Murugappa seems to be really keen, having
done fair amount work themselves like installing and trying out
programming.

I thank Saravanan of Lynus Academy for arranging the presenations

Most of the RPM packages in the DVD ends with x86_64.rpm instead of i386.rpm

Hi All,

On Friday 3rd Aug, I made a small 1Hr presentation about GNU/Linux
in SRR Engg College, OMR, Padur. Many students know about the Linux.
But only 2 students are using it. Stuff said, they wanted to conduct
a one day event to give detail presentation and demo to students.

This event is organized by the 2nd Year CSE student Balaji. He is an
ILUGC member.

Bye :)

Hmm, on my mobile (k750i) I need to specify the airtel gprs APN.
Here's my /etc/wvdial.conf:

[Dialer Defaults]
Init1 = ATZ
Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","airtelgprs.com","",0,0
Stupid Mode = 1
Modem Type = Analog Modem
ISDN = 0
New PPPD = yes
Phone = *99#
Modem = /dev/ttyACM0
Username = crank
Password = bob
Baud = 460800

@francis: Are you looking for bluetooth or USB? Also if you're looking
for a nice graphical way of doing it, you might want to install KPPP.

The '1' refers to the number of the data-profile as stored in the phone. [1]
So if you have more than one profile, you could use *99***2# for
example. I think *99# should be same as *99***1#

Recently subscribed to the list? 

When you ask for suggestions of a project, do specify
your skill set. 

Search the archives of this list for keywords such as
BE Project, Open Source project etc for better
results.

Also, please use "please" instead of the SMS lingo
"plz". 

(Firefox marks it with a red-colored-underline: it
doesn't like SMS lingo :P)

I think you cannot. gnome-desktop depends on gedit. BTW why do you want to
remove gedit?

If you can, build latest gedit deb from the source you downloaded then
upgrade it. This is only a suggestion I haven't done that myself before.

In which case you will find yourself building and installing a brand new
set of gnome libraries first.

Welcome to a dependency hell that is unique to debian

You want to do that kind of stuff - I would strongly suggest that you
wipe your debian install and setup slackware or gentoo instead.

You will end up downloading sources for, and building all of a newer
version of gnome (several hundred Mb, several hours to build it) -
unless this new version of gedit has actually been backported to your
version of debian and gnome.

I think you can do it without removing the debian gedit... if you
install from tarball/cvs, `make install` installs to /usr/local, which
by usual PATH precedes the debian gedit in /usr/bin. So, typing gedit
will end up running your compiled executable.

it moves on...

        Umm. Why would that be the case?

> Welcome to a dependency hell that is unique to debian

        I think that is not the case.  I can build new versions of
 gedit, either to install locally, or as a replacement of the version
 that come with the OS, and I don't see a dependency hell.

        care to elaborate?

        I am confused by all the conflicting advice, especially since
 you offer very little rationale.

 Any reason you can't compile and install the new gedit in /usr/local,
 and have your path set to prefer /usr/local/bin/gedit ?

        Actually, the ideal solution would be to build a .deb of the new
 gedit, but that does take a tad bit more effort.

Improper quoting .. the comments about dependency hell were mine

You can build it - but if you build it from a deb that's not backported
you will end up downloading and compiling a bunch of new gnome libs

Message-ID: <07DC851109FF05499CC051E0AF27C07019AD03@corp-hyd-mbx01.entcorp.ttsl.com>

I have configured OpenLDAP server in linux and need to configure Solaris
9 & 10 servers as LDAP client for user authentication. I have created
the profile in the LDAP server. 
*********** profile.ldif **********

But still I am not able to login with a user ID created in LDAP, While
logging in it asks for password and again it asks for LDAP password

login as: ldapuser
Password:

>From the /var/adm/messages of the Solaris cleint I am getting the below

I have configured a Solaris 10 client in the same way as above, but it
got successfully configured. I tested the following in Solaris 9 client
and all the commands where successful
#su - ladpuser from root 
#listusers
# ldapsearch -h 172.17.4.37 -b "dc=example,dc=co,dc=in" "uid=ldapuser"
userPassword
uid=ldapuser,ou=people,dc=example,dc=co,dc=in
userPassword={SSHA}X7hmxPS2JKSyj48dSV/YUEYnnuZq7UEU

I think it fails only with password authentication for a user. Plz
suggest solution.

Subject: [Ilugc] Compiling 2.6.22 for Debian Etch.
Message-ID: <d5c9fe000708070449o45d8b208v2d702c0283bbce9c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I compiled the kernel 2.6.22 for the Debian Etch. While booting the system gets
struck with a message

"waiting for root file system".

I checked up the initrd image, it has the required filesystem
modules(ext3, in my case).

While checking the web, i found a suggestion to use mkinitrd.yaird instead
of initramfs. The resultant image of using this command was only 1/4
the size of the other initrd image and it did not even come till my
previous booting stage.
Another suggestion was to put a sleep command in the init script of
initrd image before the "mountroot" command. This also did not work as
it resulted in the same problem.

Mine is a SATA harddisk and I understand this is a problem related to
the sata disk.

Can someone help to solve this problem?

thanks,
siva.

Fedora core 6 doesn't have firefox 2 rpm's officially compiled. If you wanna
get firefox 2.0 for fc6, you have two options

1. compile from source
2. Add remi repo to yum.repos.d and then do a yum update firefox

how you compiled the kernel, what are the steps you followed?
have you used "make install"  or manually copied system.map and kernel image
file?

Yes.

Some searching in Google resulted in info that udev was not updated
properly. So, you have to boot from a LiveCD, chroot, do apt-get
update, upgrade. This should fix udev. Now, you can reboot to the
newly built kernel and ramdisk image, and this is supposed to work.

No LiveCD here to try it though.

Indian Names are an exception! (Rather, one would have
to explore how spell check works within Firefox!)

Download the firefox 2.x tar.gz from ftp.mozilla.org and use it.  That
should work just fine.

Doesnt seem to be able to resolve your pop3 server. Try adding an entry

Or it hasn't been able to find the module for your root fs

1. Generate system.map and make sure it is being checked from grub

and/or

2. Compile the module for your root fs (say ext3) into your kernel
instead of as a module.

Hi Anandh,

Can you try "ldappasswd" commad to change the password?
Can tell which encryption method you are allowing in slapd.conf?

Thanks,
Bhavesh.

I don't know what you mean by start up to end level but Linux system
administration hand book second  edition ( available at Land mark Spencer )
is in my opinion the  Book with out which i  will not survive a day.
it covers  Redhat, Fedora , Debian, Ubuntu , Suse Distros. It  gives  more
practical  advice than any other book i have seen ,  along with what happens
in the  server rooms and what are the things most needed for any sys admin (
including a pack of Beer  cans :-) )  but if you are looking for an
introduction to linux , get a book from teach your self series from sams

oops - bottom posting is as bad. The correct way is to trim  
unnecessary stuff and post inline. Please see shakthi's excellent

past few days i am on slow gprs and mail is taking a long time to

Will try it.
Is this a problem specific to debian and its forks as I could not see
similar problems in anyother forums. There should be some solution
other than this right, because the initrd images that's coming with
the system is able boot, but not this one.

May I will try some lower version of the kernel to see whether the
same problem exist.

Few ILUGC members and many bloggers are attended this Wrokshop. Events
are well planned and conducted as per the schedule. We got chance to
meet few media personals (Paper, FM & TV), most of them know the FOSS
and some are trying to use the FOSS tools(LAMP, OO, OS) for production
purposes.

Myself and Amachu distributed the Ubuntu CDs to the visitors and
showed the demo of "How to use Tamil in Linux Env".

Thanks to Ma.SivaKumar and team.

Is use IBM ThinkPad R52. I had the same problem. What I think is your ide
driver take precedence over ATA drivers. I googled and tried several things
but couldn't fix it. But this drity below hack helped me.

Dear All,
I want to recover the root password of one of my Solaris server(I think, any linux mechanism will work here too). Last used password is either changed accidently or expired.
Any kind of help or pointer will be highly appreciated.

Please reply soon.

Hey Nooral,

It did not work out, same problem persists. I am compiling a older
kernel(2.6.18)
to check whether there is any problem with the that one too.

Thanks man.

I don't think this works for Solaris (or GNU/Linux if you have set to ask for
root password for getting into single user mode).

That said, Deepak, did you search across Solaris forums?

This one helps I guess:

There are several webhosts around that provide stuff like this, 90% of
them your basic ensim / plesk / cpanel + minimal support shops

I would recommend that you go to one of the larger and more reliable
places. Sure it is a few extra dollars but much more reliable

Tamil Nadu schools go for SUSE Linux 
The exodus is to eliminate numerous proprietary software licenses and
reduce hardware costs 
MUMBAI, INDIA: The Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu (ELCOT) is
rolling out SUSE Linux
<http://www.ciol.com/content/developer/Linux/2006/106071801.asp>
Enterprise across 30,000 desktops and 1,880 servers in Tamil Nadu's
schools. Earlier, ELCOT had migrated its entire IT infrastructure from
Microsoft Windows to the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and SUSE Linux
Enterprise Desktop from Novell.


"The open source software in SUSE Linux Enterprise is superb," said C.
Umashankar, managing director of ELCOT. "In addition, we estimate that
moving to Linux has reduced our general hardware costs by nearly 25
percent. In case of high-end servers
<http://www.ciol.com/content/860797344.aspx> , the savings could be as
much as 80 percent. What's more important is the benefits that the Tamil
Nadu's students will get from this. There is a growing trend towards the
corporate adoption of Linux, both in India and elsewhere. So it will be
a real advantage in the job market to have experience working with open
source software. It gives us tremendous freedom and choice," he added.


ELCOT has been procuring hardware and software for the various
departments of the Government of Tamil Nadu, which serves a population
of more than 70 million, since 1977. ELCOT's main objective is to offer
the best possible IT solutions at the lowest price, thus maximizing the
return on investment of public money, says a release from the company.
ELCOT is also involved in consulting, implementation, support and
training to help meet the state's ambitious e-governance objectives.


Before the rollout of SUSE Linux Enterprise to the schools and
government offices across Tamil Nadu, ELCOT first migrated its own
in-house IT systems to Linux for its user-friendly, cost-effective and
security reasons, says the release. The organization then worked with
teachers to design a pre-loaded set of applications which could be
delivered to the 30,000 new PCs along with SUSE Linux Enterprise
Desktop. ELCOT also rolled out SUSE Linux Enterprise Server to the
schools' 1,880 servers, which are now 100 percent Linux-based.


Roger Levy, senior vice president and general manager of Open Platform
Solutions, Novell, said, "ELCOT was able to eliminate tens of thousands
of proprietary software licenses by moving to open source software
<http://www.ciol.com/content/developer/Linux/2007/107041801.asp> , in
addition to their tremendous savings from making better use of hardware
resources. The decision to move to a new platform rests not only on
immediate pricing considerations, but also on the potential long-term
hardware, software and infrastructure costs. Based on these criteria,
SUSE Linux Enterprise is proving its value to customers around the
world."


The next-generation platform for the open enterprise, SUSE Linux
Enterprise is the best-engineered, lowest-cost and most interoperable
platform for enterprise computing, from the desktop to the data center,
according to the release.

Thanks Bharathi. I followed u and password is recovered as it was expired only.
So I was able to use old password only.
But what if it is forgotten or changed accidently?
As, in that case "init s" will not work.
If I get any thing regarding same, I will update u all.
Thanks for the help.

I don't think this works for Solaris (or GNU/Linux if you have set to ask for
root password for getting into single user mode).

That said, Deepak, did you search across Solaris forums?

This one helps I guess:

http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.solaris/browse_thread/thread/f032bd8dc4d5a0aa/27d834bb791d1c0e?lnk=st&q=solaris+root+password&rnum=4#27d834bb791d1c0e

Good luck.

Subject: [Ilugc] Partition information lost on reboot.
Message-ID: <006301c7da6a$351510b0$140110ac@LOGUCO>

Hi,

I have a scsi disk on Adaptec ASC-29320 U320. I have created a linux
partition and ext3 filesystem over it.
Now the problem is, whenever the machine is rebooted, the partition
information to the OS is lost and I get an error saying it as a not valid
block device.
But fdisk tool shows the partitions, but "cat /proc/partitions" doesnt have
this. I need to do a "partprobe" and then have to mount it explicitly.

What could be causing this problem. Given below are some of the command
outputs.

my view is that you can go for a dedicated server and configure everything
yourself( if u r a hacker ) or else go where they do shared hosting... in
the dedicated environment you dont have to depend on others( except for
network and system failure) .. dedicated works out well in the department of
reliability( depends on the app pgmrs and the admin ) but not economical(
until you are very specific) .. you can at max put 2 servers and host close
to 10 websites depending on the traffic and system configuration...

its not uncommon for shared hosting providers to have upto 150 - 180
websites one a single machine - mostly like a p-4 3.0Ghz with 2 GB ram..

ya they do that ... but the performance suffers when all these sites get

They got too popular for their own good. And ran out of upstream
bandwidth, redundant connectivity etc.

pair.com on the other hand hosts PITX, the pittsburgh internet exchange.

And verio is part of NTT DoCoMo, which certainly doesnt lack for round
the world connectivity

one of my clients hosts a rack at NTT-Verio's Sterling facilities - and
their network has been quite good. They are not the sort of people who
do budget-hosting though :)

If you want someone with bandwidth exclusively from some cheaper outfit
like cogent or pccwbtn .. and "data centers" that are a closet in some
carrier hotel - sure, you get cheap that way. You might even find that
it works for you just fine.

But if you are looking at the kind of bandwidth he was talking about..

whats more important than who you get your b/w from is how your peerings
work, and how your clientbase accepts that. Getting cheaper connections
does not mean they are going to be worse. And you will also find in this
business, like most, smaller companies are more likely to accommodate
specific requirements. eg. its easier for me to get direct peering with
$BigAssHostingCompany working with a 5 man outfit than it is for me to
get savvis to jump their LINX endpoint and give me a direct link, so i
dont pay for transit when my webservers in the DC on the West Coast, USA
hit the db servers sitting in my office in London, UK.

> But if you are looking at the kind of bandwidth he was talking about..

I must have missed something, since he only seemed to want a few
gigs/month in the OP. which works down to a few dozen kb/sec in link
assurance.

the only sort of hosting providers who are going to struggle with that
are the ones who run their server from their bedroom on the adsl link
that their dad's pay for.

Dear ilugc,

Most of you might already be aware that the current (August) LFY is a
Debian special, and comes packed with all three Debian Etch DVDs
(though I'd just stop short of recommending them because of prior bad
experience with LFY's media). But the selling point, accoring to me,
is that Jaldhar Vyas (long time Debian developer and author of the
Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 Bible) has written two articles.

It also features a nice article by Kartik Mistry on building Debian
packages. So, check it out if you can.

I did mention that, kind of - pitx has lots of ASNs there, and pair.com
as the host peers with just about every one of them

NTT DoCoMo has one helluva good routing + peering guy - Dorian Kim - and
they have some of the highest peering densities around

Yes.  Agreed. We chew rather more than that, bandwidth wise .. but you
will agree, that is a bit more bw and dedicated server than I would
trust to j.random backalley webhost, if I wanted any kind of service
quality.

You will be surprised as to how bad the bw situation can get at
backalley webhosts with a single link from a cheaper provider

/etc/fstab entry (and mount -a) did not work that is why I tried mounting it 
manually.
Yes I have currently given the "partprope" on the init script and would like 
to know what causes this problem.

To give more information on this, Initially there were two SCSI disks 
connected to a hardware HostRaid (Adaptec ASC-29320 U320) adapter.
And it was configured for RAID-0 (Striping). Each conneted disk was of 73 
GB.

When I issued fdisk -l on the system it showed both sda and sdb as 73 GB 
each. I did not know (the device name) how to access the disk as RAID?. I 
checked the dmesg output but could not figureout the device name. And I am 
neither able access the disks using /dev/sda or /dev/sdb.

lspci showed.
    03:01.0 RAID bus controller: Adaptec ASC-29320 U320 w/HostRAID (rev 03)
    03:01.1 SCSI storage controller: Adaptec ASC-29320 U320 (rev 03)

I also tried disabling Host RAID on the bios and created linux partitions on 
the sda and sdb and tried creating ext3 filesystem. But the system said

# mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda1
mke2fs 1.39 (29-May-2006)
/dev/sda1 is apparently in use by the system; will not make a filesystem 
here!

Now I removed one disk and able to create the filesystem and mount it. But 
whenever the machine is rebooted the partition information is not 
automatically available to the kernel.
I need to a "partprobe" and mount it manually.

I would be greatful it if I get the information for the three questions.

1. what should be done access the disks as raid
2. why is it saying /dev/sda1 is used by the system even though the HW RAID 
configuration is disabled in the BIOS and no one is using it. (tried fuser 
and lsof)
3. What is the reason for the partition not being detected automatically 
with single disk.

Thanks

Well it made it clear that you have not configured HW raid.
(So, I'm assuming that "sda" & "sdb" is a real drive and not some
pseudo-drive which exists only in the firmware of the RAID
controller.)

Paste the output of "cat /proc/mdstat" after reboot and before you run
partprobe and second after you run partprobe.

mdadm --examine --scan  /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 > /etc/mdadm.conf
Edit /etc/mdadm.conf so that the devices statements are on the same
lines as the ARRAY statements, as they are in below listing.  Add the
"missing" device to the devices entry for each array member to fill
out the raid1 complement of two devices per array. Don't forget to
renumber the md entries if the recovery computer already has md
devices and ARRAY statements in /etc/mdadm.conf

Listing: DEVICE partitions

ARRAY /dev/md0 level=raid1 num-devices=2
 ?UUID=b3cd99e7:d02be486:b0ea429a:e18ccf65
 ?devices=/dev/sda1,missing
ARRAY /dev/md1 level=raid1 num-devices=2
 ?UUID=75fa22aa:9a11bcad:b42ed14a:b5f8da3c
 ?devices=/dev/sda2,missing

Then, activate the new md devices with mdadm -A -s, and check
/proc/mdstat to verify that the RAID array is active.

Note: Above config depends how you have built it up.

It was never in BIOS ( see above comment ) and fuser & lsof works only
for user space.

probable disk partitioninformation is not stored in a right way on
disk and the bootup commands out of box linux, does not have command
to retrive partition information.

come on luggies, we need to give better advice to this user. i suppose this is
better than the previous advice which was to run fsck! please try to understand
the problem before giving out solutions. adaptec hostraid is pseudo raid and it
is not possible to do hardware raid with this (meaning, adaptec's drivers will
give you equivalent of software raid functionality and that is all you can do);
when that is enabled, all drives will be pseudo drives only existing in the
firmware of the raid controller. but then, since the card only provides software
raid equivalent, the advice to switch to software raid (md device) provided by
the kernel is actually valid advice! it would appear that there is some problem
with the partition table being read by the system. it may be possible to clear
that by setting the card to straight scsi mode (disabling all hostraid
functionality), deleting all partitions from the partition table, rebooting and
then creating fresh partition table entries.

Hello,

You should have beryl installed and running in your system.Google helped in
installing beryl.Try it. Its very simple with apt :)

You have 2 hard disks(sda,sdb).
You can create software raid by-:
=>mdadm -C /dev/md0 --chunk=64 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda /dev/sdb
=>issue cat /proc/mdstat to see the raid device running
=> mkfs -t ext3 /dev/md0
=> mount /dev/md0 /mount_RAID
If there was an problem in creating RAID then I think(not sure) you will
have to recreate s/w raid.But if its under LVM  you can extend it and try to
add sdb.
You can mount /dev/sda or /dev/sdb (if /dev/md0 is not mounted) on other
directory and check for the empty space(as it is RAID0->stripping mode data
is stored in both the devices)

I think in /etc/fstab there is no entry for /dev/md* which is creating
problem in mounting the devices.Try entering
/dev/md0      /mount_RAID        ext3     defaults    0 0

You can find about raid in kernel dmesg by
# dmesg | grep RAID
# less /proc/kcore |strings|grep RAID>~/data.txt (This command will take
time)
will also give you some information about raid.

Do tell us how did you create s/w raid and the empty space/occupied memory
in sda and sdb.If I have misunderstood your problem then inform us.

P.S: I am not sure whether it will solve your problem or not but if it works
kindly let me know.

This is not enough to know the problem. We need more info
What graphics adapter do you have?
What is the output of
glxinfo | grep direct

And as Ambuj said, check beryl or compiz fusion for more
effects.

Maybe timeout is too short, you need to increase it?
As you've not specified the details I am just guessing
it.

No gaurantee but you can try this.
1) Boot solaris installed machine with linux live cd.
2) Mount the root filesystem.
3) edit /etc/passwd and set root passwd to blank
4) boot into solaris, press enter when prompted for root password
5) if login happens, immediately change root password

WARNING: This mechanism has worked on linux but not gauranteed to work
on Solaris. Tyr it on your own risk. This method might cause root to
be locked out for ever.

You need people with 15 years of expertise in linux?  Hmm.. Linus, Alan Cox, 
etc would fit the bill there, I think, as Linux was developed in 1991 :)

TAM and TAB are in 7 bit format.. To convert to Unicode use Python..
I got a logic to covert. Read the file that contains TAM or TAB characters
character by charater prints its equavalent in the terminal..

For example take 'L' is the TAM Character for *?.. *
if c=='L':
      print u'*?'*
**
**
The problem here will be.. Two or Three character of TAM will form a single
charater of Unicode then use nested If statements..
Finally copy the contents in the terminal to a text editor and save it as
unicode file..
thats it

Sir,
     In my Office Server, we use SAN. Operating system used is RHEL4. Oracle
database is used. Linux Clients are used. front end for database is PHP. My
server automatically unmount the partition
              /ltapp
which contains the PHP files for our application. ( Our application is
'Billing of Electricity Services'. ie TNEB computerized service for CC
collection). after unmount of /ltapp
             /Oradata or /OraHome1
was automatically unmounted and httpd service stoped. I checked the
/var/log/message file, which is also enclosed herewith. Our action is just
mounting the unmounted partition and restart the httpd service. I request
all to suggest their thoughts for rectification and also request a permanent
remedy.
Forgive me if you could not understand my details.

Error message

The SAN partition in the regional server was found unmounted and the httpd
server stopped on 07/08/07 at 08:20.The SAN partition was mounted manually

On studying the /var/logs it was found that an error was being thrown every
30 seconds. The same is being attached herewith .It is requested that the
same may be studied and the cause for error message may be informed to the
undersigned. Any preventive action to be taken may be done before the
situation aggravates .

This logs are generated by oracle cluster suite I guess ??

I have used NetAPP SAN for oracle and it used to show this kind of errors

How about inserting the following line here:

You may also want to give a bogus username/password instead of " ",
since wvdial is quite stubborn about having them... am not sure if " "
works...

I modified Init1 to AT&FX1L1 and commented Init2. It works fine. I use
N70 and airtel GPRS on Fedora7.

[dileep@param ~]$ cat /etc/wvdial.conf
[Dialer Defaults]
        Modem = /dev/ttyACM0
        Baud = 57600
        Init = AT&FX1L1
        Phone = *99#
        Username = ""
        Password = ""

Speed varies from 2-10Kbps. Cannot recommend GPRS for high bandwidth
demanding tasks. I use VSNL broadband (upto 2Mbps) also. I use gmail
app on mobile while traveling.

Message-ID: <809586140708150640x3bbc22caq288fa14cca912b9a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have been trying for the past 2 weeks to write a Perl script to send
a file through SFTP (interactve auth). The problem is that I have the
password of the SFTP account (a govt. account) to which I need to send
the file. It is to be noted that the SSH access to that SFTP account
is disabled. So, I am unable to exchange the public keys between the
hosts (I don't have .ssh folder in the remote host). So I need to know
how to write  a Perl script to access that host using SFTP with the
given password. I have googled and found the "expect" solution. But, I
am not convenience d with it. Is it possible for me to transfer files
using a batch with password auth. I tried all the combinations

sftp -b /dev/stdin or
sftp -b /dev/fd/0

but in vein. Can some one help me with this. Is it possible for me to
exchange the keys with the given password without the help of the
remote hosts admin (a govt. servant and I think it will involve lot of
formalities to take the steps by which my target date of completion
will be reached and moreover I don't know whom to contact there) or is
it possible for me to hardcore the password in the script (i know it
is insecure but no other go).

When I try to access that account using ssh I get ssh access denied by
admin. So, is it possible for me to exchange the keys with the given
password. I have googled a lot and found that it is something to do
with the shell and the stdin to access the sftp processes terminal.

Thanks

Hi all,

I am very much interested in Tamil Nadu E-gov project. Where can I get
more info. regarding it. I will like to know whether any recruitment
process is going. I am very much interested in it. I also came to know
that some volunteers are required for the ELCOT training pro gramme.
I would like to know what it is about? I have checked and added it on
the wiki. I am new to this training. Is it ok if I become a volunteer.
Where do I get info about it.

Thanks

Using:

OS: Etch
OpenOffice: 2.2 stable
Plan: OpenOffice 2.2.1

There is an icon on the top-right side of my OpenOffice program (
anything... writer,calc,draw,impress..); which shows that, there is an
update available. When i click on that icon, one page [0] comes, but as far
as i looked, there is no *update* icon from OpenOffice 2.2 into 2.2.1 there
in that page. Is there any incremental patches update option for 2.2 into
2.2.1?

Best,

Try the empty command (http://empty.sourceforge.net/). Before using
it, try to understand the empty example scripts. I used it to simulate
large no .of telnet connections to a server.

SCIM (I think if I recall correct) can be triggered by the Ctrl+Space
(default) trigger and the input methods can be changed by various
configurable hotkeys - do you plan to (re)use them or add functionality
in your application over and above this ? Or, is it like a particular
button in your application is proposed to be the trigger through
ClickButton (example) for a SCIM IM change ? Best would be to read the
SCIM docs to figure how to tie in your event with registering it as a
SCIM trigger.

Subject: [Ilugc] man in the middle attack?
Message-ID: <5180DEEC-6DD3-42FF-BB3C-9FF05D33D077@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

an installation with two PCs running Mandriva 2007. Connected to the  
net through an airtel routerr/modem. Modem address is 192.168.1.1 and  
the two machines are 192.168.1.2 and 3. The two machines share files  
over ssh. sshd is running on both machines. This morning when the  
machines were switched on - both reported 'ssh fingerprint changed  
and is different from that in .ssh/knownhosts. Suspect man in middle  
attack blah blah'. When the line referring to the host is removed, it  
first adds the address to the list of known hosts - but then a  
message saying ssh authentication disabled as man in the middle  
attack suspected. I am in Chennai and the setup in Coimbatore so this  
info is got over the phone. Both machines are also running shorewall  
with the sshd port open. Any clues?

This could happen if the ssh packages in the machine were updated, their 
ip address changed etc. In this case, I suspect that the modem was set 
to dhcp and the machines are usually 2 and 3. Today morning, it could 
have been 3 and 2. Either way, you need to delete the lines in the known 
hosts for all machines that have the same IP and try it again.

Hi All;
I am planning to relocate to Chennai/Madras and I am on the lookout
for jobs, preferably in Linux in the Embedded/Desktop space.
I remember there were a few links to some webpage that had a list or
something of companies known to work on Linux.
Can some one point me to that page ?
In case someone knows of openings in Linux, a pointer would be
appreciated.
For the record, I have around seven years experience, predominantly
in embedded Linux space.
Thanks

Certification will help only if he actually learn things and can prove
to be a production-ready engineer. Otherwise doing some sort of
"apprenticeship" may be more useful to gain actual real-life experience.

Subject: [Ilugc] Installing readline library to python.
Message-ID: <d5c9fe000708162158m57047993k522d6f83eed9f859@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Guys,

I was trying to install readline library to python. The python that
comes with the distros(debian, RHEL) has the readline library(one
which provides the history of command typed), by default. I wanted to
install the latest python in my system and
when I installed it, it did not have the readline library by default.

So, I downloade the readline library, compiled and installed. The
shared file readline.so, which should have been copied to the python
path did not get copied.
So, I copied that library to /usr/lib/python2.4/lib-dynload/

When I gave a "import readline", it through an error like this,

ImportError: /usr/lib/python2.4/lib-dynload/readline.so: only ET_DYN
and ET_EXEC can be loaded.

Did I do something wrong here? Can someone help out?

regards,
siva.

In my Debian (Etch/Lenny) system, dpkg -L python2.4 has the following
as one of the lines:
/usr/lib/python2.4/lib-dynload/readline.so

which means that it's supposed to be part of the basic Python package
(python2.4 in this case). It's also there for python2.5.

So, which latest version of Python are you trying to install?

Yes, it is available in the installed package in Debian Etch.

See, When I compile Python(2.5.1), there is an option to enable
readline(--with-readline=yes). But that option is not having any
effect during compilation and the build not generating the readline
library.

After some googling I found, that if I manually edit the Modules/setup
file, readline.so file getting created and installed. Is it possible
to enable the
readline option during ./configure.

siva.

I have been facing a couple of "weird" issues on
Debian 4.0

1. Every time (on a new boot) I have to "listen" to a
video song, I have to run "alsaconf". I can see the
video and listen to audio files but not the video
songs until i run "alsaconf"

2. GCC reports linker error while using "sin", "cos",
etc. However it is solved when i append a "-lm" during
compilation

Waiting for some insights!

Thanks

Message-ID: <46C56A91.2020907@dgbmicro.com>

Hello everyone,

                      I am using BSNL modem UT300R2u . My modem had been 
detected in Ubuntu 7.04 and was using it for net work connectivity.  
Recently due to unknown reason the modem stopped working when connected 
via the ethernet .

I pinged the  the following ip address  

1 )  local host  127.0.0.1 :  Got response 
2 )  Modem ip192.168.1.1 : No response . ( The led indicating the 
ethernet connection was not glowing )

I started using my modem via USB, driver was available for windows  so 
no issues. However the driver provided for linux was for older kernel 
version and was not supporting AMD 64 bit architecture.  The modem was 
detected by Ubuntu  as an per USB peripheral but not as device for 
networking  Can any one help with this  issue , connecting net via USB 
Modem ?

1. Do an "alsactl store"
2. Make sure your login user (say asaha) is in group "audio"

If you are renting the modem from BSNL then request them to replace it.  
MTNL in Mumbai is reasonably good at it - only problem you have to go 
the local exchange that provides your DSL service.

Hi,

The readline library is getting instlled. I did not check my

It is working properly. I am mistaken.

Easiest (but command line way, assuming ubuntu install CD comes with wvdial):

# sudo apt-get install wvdial
# sudo wvdialconf
<output.... hopefully you have only one modem device, if the modem is
not detected you're in trouble (internal winmodem?)>

# sudo vi /etc/wvdial.conf
Edit the username, password and phone number fields and remove the
semi-colon ";" in front of them.

At least earlier, I've found that for dialling to BSNL you need to
disable "Check for dialtone".So add the line:
Abort on no dialtone = off

If you're having problems with GUI's like KPPP, try to disable dialtone check.

Hi,

Your  certification gets  you the interview but it is your stuff that gets
you the job.
I am an RHCE and  it did get me  a couple of interviews , and it is the way
you face the interview , that is important.
Hope this helps.

Agreed 100%.  What you can do is the most important thing. I have
interviewed over 300 RHCE certified people to get only frustrated. Seems
the standards are falling. So, I take interest in only what one actually
knows and what one can do. I wish the Freshers start realising the need
of apprenticeship and take a practical down-to-earth approach to career.

They really have no clue how high the Industry standards and
requirements are when you are competing on an International scale.

There is a problem with the mindset.

* School kids think if they get good marks, they will get into MBBS or
engineering. Atleast they are made to think like that, by mugging up
answers and vomiting in exams. End of the day, they fail to gain any
knowledge/skill.

* College students think if they do well in a job interview, they can
get a job, and life is happy. They don't get any theoretical or
practical hands-on experience or knowledge during their college days
at all!

They don't realize that if they don't have the skills, they cannot do
anything at work. Nobody is going to keep you or pay you if you don't
do any work. You can sit in the bench in the industry without doing
any work, but, it is not going to help your profile or your
credibility in the long run. Only at work do they realize that they
have wasted their life in college. So, some start to work in the
industry in India and it takes them atleast 3-4 years to get a hang of
it, and few more years to become pro. So, this is roughly around the
age of 26-28.

On the contrary, I have seen kids in school in the US turning pro in
college (at the age of 18-20), doing really cool FOSS stuff. Yes, they
all have their own laptops (quite opposite in India). I guess it is
the same in the EU as well. So, you can really see the digital divide.

I have observed the lack of attitude in all the colleges that I have
been to in India. There are very, very few exceptional students. Sorry
if I sound harsh, but, welcome to reality.

I agree 100%. The students(looking only at a 50k job to start with, and
not bother about becoming a good human being who also earns good
money) , their parents (looking at a settled child in USA in the first
year of the career itself, to get a good dowry, and not bother about
creating a good human being), the institutions (out to just make a fast
buck, while they could have made good money even by giving great
quality), they are all to blame for it.
It will be unfortunate, but I will not be surprised if the crime and
suicide rate increases here also in future like in many other places,
where they left the "meaning of life" behind, stopped serious-thinking
and just ran after money. Its like running a race without the proper
shoes.
They all must change their thinking - the society as a whole needs to do
something about it.

Dude, thanks for your help. But, i don`t need this. Your procedure shows, "how
to install an updated Open Office.org"

And i wanted to know, "how can i upgrade my current OpenOffice? not by
installation, but only the *upgrade* way.. .from OpenOffice 2.2 to
OpenOffice 2.2.1"

Hello GNU/Linux users,
        I have been using GNU/Linux since I was in second year of my
college. I would like to share some of my views over RHCE certification.

@rajasekhar
>Your  certification gets  you the interview but it is your stuff that gets
you the job.
I completely agree.

@Sudhir
>What you can do is the most important thing.
No doubt about it.

>I have interviewed over 300 RHCE certified people to get only frustrated.
If the interview is for a development job I think RHCE is not the
certification. If it is for administration then RHCE`s do have a chance.

>I wish the Freshers start realising the need of apprenticeship and take a
practical down-to-earth approach to career.
Easily said than done. Freshers try hard to work as an apprentice.But they
fail to obtain one.

@SK
>They don't realize that if they don't have the skills, they cannot do
anything at work.
There cannot be any doubt over it.

>School kids think if they get good marks, they will get into MBBS or
engineering. Atleast they are made to think like that, by mugging up answers
and vomiting in exams.
If the mugging and vomiting is pointed to RHCE then yes you have to PRACTICE
a lot to get comfortable with the RHEL environment and commands.

@Sudhir
>The students(looking only at a 50k job to start with, and not bother about
becoming a good human being who also earns good money)
Why the students are targeted???? Its the company who make closed systems
not the students..All of us (I am a student too) are good human being. Every
one wants to keep his environment clean and tidy. But do other professionals
allow it?? Moreover we ,students want to come parallel to our fellow US
students and buy a apple laptop(1.10L) within 3 months of job. Earning money
is not bad (rather its necessary in present conditions) but its bad if it is
earned in a wrong way.

>where they left the "meaning of life" behind, stopped serious-thinking and

This is really bad and I would LOVE to HATE such students :#

Its true RHCE certifications does not help anyone in getting a job. It may
be a plus point but not the ace card. Why would a company select anyone if
he is of no use to that company!!! I am sure even RedHat would not hire such
a guy.

A good selection procedure should see the capability and willingness to work
and learn in the candidate.His work in the past always shows his capability.

I apologize for my harshness. But this is what I felt.

We interview RHCE professionals for Linux administration related jobs
only, so, there is no confusion there.

You like it or not, "you" face "your" life finally "yourself" only. I
graduate student, for that matter one getting into graduation is
grown-up enough to attempt to grasp these things. To say that "my
parents" decided this or something like that would only be an excuse. If
the parents, professionals, society, teachers or whoever do not allow
you to do what you want, then its reason enough to rebel and build a
society that you wish to have and not suffer the consequences of others'
bad things/actions. Those who expect the society to be good and have
everything ready-n-working for them, need to be born after another 25+
years.

I don't want to generalise this, but look at what the students (mostly
or many) aspire for today. I am facing plenty of students/freshers when
I go to colleges or meet them afterwards. They don't care for what they
know and don't try to learn the best that they can. They just want a job
anyhow, irrespective of what they know, not caring about their
performance. An IT graduate talking of programming career failing to
write Hello program in any language of his choice - if that is the
level, what have they been doing all the years in the college ? Which
senior or parent or teacher or society is to blame for this ?

I think, for the good of the freshers and the society, you need to be
harsh here. People need to realise the mess for which they themselves
are also responsible. It is not the case of diplomacy here, specially
because 60% of the IT freshers are without jobs in this country that is
being considered an IT super-power. We must see this reality; we must
feel ashamed of it; and we must take action to correct the course -
hopefully we are still in time.

dont you read the original post fully before replying? it is not a thin client -
the op had clearly stated what his hardware setup was - 2*(mouse, keyboard,
display adapter, monitor) on a single machine. may not be big deal, but it is
cool; the only thing 'extra' is the second display adapter. cant get much
thinner than that. there was an article in linux gazette last year on 6-seat pc
like this but that system was a bit unstable

+1. I didn't have too when I completed college. I did not do RHCE
(that does not say anything)

Honestly, not many people seem to care as long as they have their
bread made. The industries should teach the lesson by not hiring
incompetence. They won't since they badly need head count. Almost that
is all they need : head count, nothing more.

Same here. I don't want to sound harsh, but I can't really help sometimes.

I agree with you Abhishek on most points. I strongly think that young
people need to use their guts to break the chains of "lacks" around them
and work hard to grow beyond these limitations. That will show them the
way out.
They should realise that life is not rosy without buying the roses
oneself; That they have to work for it; that they have to stop depending
on anyone else and find their way out.
Look, everyone says : Youth are the future.
How is that possible with youth wanting to be just dependents ? They are
not dependents when they have to find girl-friends and boy-friends; they
are not dependent when they have to search for a new toy (cell, game or
whatever), then, why depend about building career and life ?

Hi,

Thanks for all your valuable thoughts. I don't know how valuable this
discussion is for newbies. Anyways, my thoughts below:

--- Ambuj Thacker >ambuj.mbp at gmail.com> wrote:

> not the students.

There is no relation. As a student, what you are as a person is more
important than who your teachers are, which school you went to, which
company you work for. They are not related. Who you are as a person
makes what you are, not where you are from and which school you went
to or for whom you work. This is where I see high-context cultures,
like India, trying to relate to each other. IMO, there is no relation.

When students put this dependancy on their plight on teachers, the
college, they lose confidence. They think it is their fate. What they
fail to realize is that by using FOSS on their old PII or PIII x86
boxes, they can still do shell programming, GUI development, embedded
development, and learn a lot. So, they never make an effort in the
first place.

Just because there are evil people around, doesn't mean you should
turn into one.

> Moreover we ,students want to come parallel to our fellow US

Really? Of all the freshers that I have worked with in the past three
years, the first thing they buy with a big salary is a cell phone, a
bike, spend all the weekends in pubs, going out on old Mahabalipuram
road on weekends to party. Not one, I repeat, not one I have seen buy
a personal computer to work. Even if they did, I'd suspect they will
still use it for gaming or watching movies.

I am not saying that you shouldn't spend on all these. Once in a while
its ok, but, not wasting money every weekend.

Every college in the US has ethernet jacks in the classrooms, where
students can plug-in their laptops during class hours. There is also
wireless LAN to which you can connect to. Every class has a projector
that professors can connect their laptops to and can use it during
class sessions. All assignments/lab reports are sent through e-mails.
Classes are also held through voice conferences. All this some 5 years
back when I was studying in the US.

Can you tell me how many colleges in India have these, today? Now, we
are talking numbers.

I still see students in India "writing" homework and assignments. I
have not seen any company in India asking their employees to write
hand written reports to their clients. So you can see that they are
not being trained for anything.

If you have not experienced real education abroad, don't even think of
commenting about it.

I know why Indian kids hang around near Satyam and Citi centers.

I agree. That is what I meant by digital divide.

That is what I meant by digital divide.

How to troubleshoot this....?

Greetings,

As usual ,i'm splitting my post into 'chunks of thought'..

I was just reading about the Mozilla Special Projects tour, where people
like Seth & Chris Hofmann (Mozilla's Director of Special Projects) toured
cities across to India to meet many of the Indian community members who have
been contributing to Mozilla. (read more at http://blog.mozilla.com/seth/ )

[1] why did chennai miss out on this tour ?
Would have been great to see come action here in chennai as well ( OR did i
miss it completely ). Any1 active on the mozilla community in this list ? Is
there any page to address chennai mozilla community .

Let's strengthen the Mozilla community here @ chennai and contribute to
Mozilla through : l1ion  , translation , special_projects , extension
development,etc . On a personal note, i'd be interested in webrunner ,
xulRunner projects, apart from extension and XUL development for Firefox.

[2] Taking the initiative, and planing ahead
Considering that there is a lot of scope for localisation and committed work
already at places like iit-m, au-kbc ,imsc ,cdac , other open source
volunteer -   i think we definitely have a very credible and established
sources for localisation.  We could probably invite guest speakers from
people who had the pleasure of interacting with people from the august 07
mozilla tour .I believe a few poeple from the chennai centres of cdac,imsc,
and few NGO's did participate . Maybe have a meetup for discussing what Seth
and Chris were talking about, future projects/initiatives , and the building
the Mozilla community at chennai .

What say ?

I am similar filesystem problems with ext3. X server fails to start because
of Input / Ouput error. I guess this is problem with ext3 filesystem. Need
to look at my log files.

Does it list xv?

It is not a good idea to try vidix(not mature yet) when the card's
native driver supports the XVideo extension.

mplayer rocks with hardware scaling in the graphic card's GPU, but then
it can also work well if your CPU is good enough using software scaling.

$ mplayer -vo x11 -vf spp,scale=1024:768 video.avi

The SDL,gl and other output drivers work well for me too.

Try

$ xvinfo

or 

$ xdpyinfo | grep -i xvideo

Hi,

mplayer -vo help display cvidix, mpegpes, yuv4mpeg but not Xv
xdpyinfo | grep -i xvideo gives output as XVideo.

and output of xvinfo I have attached. along with xorg.conf.
It seems that Mplayer is not compiled with correct settings, Do I need to add any options with ./configure.....?
Also I am on FC6-x64 is that a problem, though I compiled src package so it shoudn't be a concern.

Thanks,

Anurag

That is the problem. People come back from the US and the EU and start
cribbing about what is not there back home. How many laptops are
indegeniously made in India? Why not? Do not we know the technology?
As long as we will have to buy laptops from americans, it is going to
remain out of common reach. Was there a step taken in that direction?

If you don't know, IITM has similar facility. Of course ppl are not
required to have laptops, assignments are emailed, announcements made
to email and online.. Wireless access is not ubiquitous, though.

So do I. At least enough to take that example. Do we not have kids

I think the important points are :
# IT Engineer has completed his studies.
# He belongs to those 60% that do not get jobs (not that the rest 40%
got the right jobs, but let's first look at those who are still without
jobs)
# This engineer thinks he/she has the degree so the companies should
give the job. Companies think otherwise and this gets proven in the
interviews.
# Where does this Engineer go from here ?

Its a dead-lock that needs to be broken. Surely some creative way will
need to be found for this. Who should be at the forefront, leading the
solution-finding in this situation ?
What is the role of the Engineer in this situation ?
Why does this Engineer, who is without job, not adapt a positive
attitude of doing something here, leading the situation towards a
resolution ?
Surely, if they do it, others will support them, help them find a
solution. I will for sure.
Let's think about this; stop sulking and find a way out.
These Engineers are a rich resource of society and our common social
responsibility (provided of-course, those that want it) and we need to
work out a solution.

Subject: [Ilugc] Two day workshop in Mepco Engg college - Sivakasi
Message-ID: <361706.21637.qm@web7911.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Dear luggies

  I, with Ponnusamy of NRCFOSS did two day workshop on FOSS called
Lynx-07 in Mepco Engg College, Sivakasi.It was organised by the
students under Indian Society for Technical Education - Mepco
Chapter.

  The workshop was for 30 students of CS and IT branches. All were
final year students. Students practiced then and there, as it was
done in one of their labs. A brilliant set of students picking up
well.

  The awarness level is very low. But in two days they seem to be
enthused enough. I am sure FOSS will pickup in the college. 

   The students promised to start a campus lug soon and pass on
knowledge to their juniors. I am hopeful about it.

   On behalf of ILUGC, I thank, Raghav Preethi, Aswin and others of
ISTE-Mepco for organising the workshop. I should also thank the two
seniors who left the college who were instrumental in arranging this.

That is where you miss the point.

The emphasis is using FOSS on desktops for education and learning, and
not depending on others. Most distro CDs/DVDs have their own manuals
which you can browse. Need to learn to think "positively" and stand on
your own legs and not depend on teachers, the college, society, for
each and everything.

That is why I said, "Now, we are talking numbers", meaning, we can count them.
And that is "one" out of how many engineering institutions in this country?

Most GNU/Linux systems have mail servers, content management systems
that they can setup for intranet LAN for educational needs.

The emphasis is to see the best from others and see how you can come
up to their competence level. This is what I meant by
"A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E".

>  At least enough to take that example. Do we not have kids

That is where you miss the point again.

I accept the fact that there are bad things abroad too. But, why do
you always have to be negative?

Why can't you see the positive things abroad, and try to see how you
can improve yourself with it? Again, this is what I meant in my
previous e-mail as "A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E". You just proved the lack of it
:) This is exactly what I see with students in this country.

As an engineer, if you get stuck in one methodology of problem
solving, you backtrack, and try a different approach. I don't see
these engineering students doing this.

For example, a department in one college borrowed a server from
another department to setup their GNU/Linux user mailing list. It was
pretty active! Once, the other department took back the server, they
were very upset. I waited for a month to see if they will find another
solution. They didn't.

I had to tell them explicitly to create a mailing list for their user
group in googlegroups. Why couldn't they backtrack and think that we
can create an alternative mailing list for the group, an alternative
solution to the problem? This is the "lack of attitude".

> Exactly, then we should not crib about our lack of contrib.

That is what I again meant by "lack of attitude". You just keep
proving it again and again!

You should see how you can overcome that difficulty and prove who you
really are. That is where students seem to accept the fact that it is
their fate or plight that they are here, and they are not doing
anything to improve themselves. It only helps in worsening the already
existing digital divide.

Cheers,

SK

Interesting, comments are also very good - have arguments against it as well.

"Windows does not support the hardware. The hardware supports Windows.
While people complain that Linux does not have complete drivers for
top 3d graphics cards, *neither does Windows*. Windows does not have
full 3d drivers for these cards, Instead, these 3d graphics cards come
with drivers for Windows."

Hi,
   
  
  I am using to download my ftp file using wget command. The size of the file is 235 MB. Already I was using ftp command to download such a file, but if any network problem raised in the mid of download the download got failed so again i have to download from the beginning of the file by manually.
   
  
  While using the wget command to download the file even tough if any network problem raised the connection will be established automatically but i am facing a critical issue that the actual files size getting increased or accumulated depend upon the number of failures(upto 929 MB). 
   
  
  Syntax wget -t 0 -c ftp://servername/filename
  username and password included in the .wgetrc file.
  
   
  Could any one of you help me to fix this issue?

Nice discussion.

Americans are where they are (with Laptop for all students, Internet
connectivity etc), because of the hardwork done by the previous generation.
If we want our children to enjoy a better standard of living, we better (the
employed, unemployed and college going professionals) use the available
resources for productive use.

Satyam, ECR, Pubs are not the definition of High Tech economy. 100s of open
source projects, Kernel Hacking and start ups should be the status symbols.

Well.. I should have known better than to have talked. FOSS desktops
for education teaches software. Cannot make a laptop affordable. I am
not reading this thread any further than this.

I am happy that you spoke out, and asked good questions. Appreciate

1. You might want to check out AMANDA
http://www.amanda.org/

You can set it up to take backups from windows machines using samba.


2. You could write a script which uses rsync to take incremental
backups. And you could simply cron it.

rsync should work on Windows too. What problem you faced with it?
You can also try rdiff-backup (http://rdiff-backup.nongnu.org) if you want
snapshot style backups. rdiff-backup is also based on rsync.

IIRC wget can continue from the point where it was left off only if the
server supports it.

So, it might be a bug, try without using the "--continue" option.

A little preachy, and that would be a pretty dull economy :). They too 
provide employment to hundreds of people. And recreation to thousands 
more. Pretty essential things I would say. When you have disposable 
income, there will be ways to burn it. Better get used to it. Okay, 
that's way OT by now :)

Crappers, I thought they were talking about Sify, when they said
Satyam, and spent a while wondering what people were doing hanging out
near cyber-cafes.  Didn't connect ECR or Pubs to anything at all.
Which is weird, but then it should have been pubs, not Pubs.

And damn, I feel old now.  :)

But yeah, this is waaay OT, even though I'm not sure what the topic

Okie. That certainly deserves an OT tag and a "Huh??". Dude, what's the 
connection? Are you implying that they are bad (I'm not talking about 
the East India Company, btw)? Is that your job to judge, that too in a 
public forum, a technical one at that? It's your personal opinion, and I 
find it highly irrelevant to the topic being discussed.

You gotta compile mplayer with xv support. It is no big deal. 

And

$ mplayer -vo xv video.avi

will really rock!

Btw, xv is a really important extension and is heavily used by all video
players including tvtime, xine, ogle and more.

Hi,

I'm using Network Manager to manage my wireless networks. There's this
b-network that uses the same essid, but for some reason doesn't work
for me... and network manager keeps using it...

Is there any way to "blacklist" this AP?

Thanks,

Don't know about IE 5.5 but looks alright on IE 7 except for the footer.

Yes I too observed that recently.
I used ie4linux for booking ticket in irctc. It worked for me.
You can get ie4linux from here:
http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page

We should find a way to ask the irctc admins to make their site compatible
with firefox.

You can specify a particular channel / MAC address etc that your access 
point is on, and lock network manager to that

I think the summary is a bit misleading. The author is talking about an
instance when he had to change the motherboard on his computer when he
already had Linux and Windows XP installed on it.

He changed the motherboard to find that Linux was able to recognize most
of the hardware without any issues (as all the hardware modules were
already available in the Linux kernel) while in the case of Windows XP, he
had to install the drivers manually for each new device.

One of the comments to the article above refers to the problem a user
would face if any the devices are not natively supported in the Linux
kernel. This comment also included this interesting link to an article by
Shuttleworth which further clarifies this point:
http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/76

I think Shuttleworth captures the problem of device support on Linux quite
nicely in this post. Device support and quality of device support on Linux
is really a function of the market reach of Linux.

The reason Windows does not ship with drivers for *ALL* supported devices
is because:

a) The device manufacturers ship driver CDs on the disks which accompany
the devices.

b) Pretty much any device out there already has drivers for Windows. We
are talking about so many drivers that the drivers alone will fill up many
CDs.

c) Binary drivers are supported on Windows.

d) OEMs load Windows onto PCs.

I know I got flamed for saying this earlier, but frankly I don't care.
This is the truth.

Regards,
PK

Market reach - the % of linux desktops is 3.4%,
4% os x, windows rest.

They have to write their own drivers for each release of window$,
which is a PITA. They have to work with micro$oft everytime to do
that, which is again a PITA.

Basically, the device manufacturers sign an NDA with micro$oft not to
release any internal information. So, everything is internal. End
result is that end users are only made to think that the product looks
like it works, but, you don't get to see what really doesn't work or
the dirty unresolved work-arounds that go inside. Only developers know
what really doesn't work, and that is not included in the product
marketing :)

The result is that there can be crappy products in the market, that
may not follow any standard, unfortunately.

True.

We expect hardware vendors to release their datasheets. But, if they
have a crappy product, they get to work with micro$oft, so they don't
release the information to the public, and still make money.
Otherwise, it makes their bugs visible to the public, it may affect
their stock-holders, investors and business, in general.

They also fear that their product might be replicated by somebody else
if they release their hardware data-sheets.

Distros do have some proprietary binary drivers.

Just like a Free Software revolution, there needs to be a Free
Hardware revolution.

SK

The lack of market reach of Linux.

Please read:
http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/76

When Linux has more than 5 or 10% of the market, the hardware manufactures
will pay it more attention and be willing to release their drivers more
readily. As it stands, Linux has less than 3% market reach and those
manufacturers who release drivers willingly for Linux are the exception
and not the norm.

Right now, we do have some manufacturers who release their drivers under
GPL, but again, that is not the norm. Actually, a lot of hardware
manufacturers are not even willing to release the specs for their
hardware.

Perhaps when Linux has 20% to 30% market reach, hardware manufacturers may
even be willing to release their driver source files under the GPL.

PK

And I have no clue on how to do that (I swear I have googled :) )...
although I'd rather blacklist only a particular AP, since all the
other APs in the network work for me... All the APs have same essid.

If I do iwconfig and set channel/AP, network-manager takes me back to
the bad AP after some time (its signals seem strong, but don't work :)
)...

Thanks,

The Linux kernel developers have a policy of not allowing non-GPL'd drivers to 
make it into the kernel. Whether its non-GPL'd or non-free, I'm not sure.

Take nvidia's drivers for example. The kernel module itself is distributed in 
the form of the source code. I notice this because it has to be recompiled on 
Gentoo, everytime I change the kernel. `Binary' distros distribute the debs 
or rpms for these precompiled modules. Obviously, they're compiled by making 
sure that they work properly with the stock distribution kernel. The OpenGL 
libraries and all, however, are closed source.

Message-ID: <668653.42855.qm@web7614.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hello all,

GIMP plugins extend GIMP, we know that.

Is there any way to make GIMP plugins themselves
extensible. My point here is that, can we make a GIMP
plugin which allows itself modifiable
by a end-user to include a new functionality without
much of a hassle on part of the end-user. Does any one
know of a method to do this or any GIMP plugin which
already does this?

I would appreciate even the slightest of insights.

Thanks a lot!

hi,

I have a setup like this:

doze dhcp server with ip 192.168.1.2 with thin clients in the ip  
range of 192.168.1.4 - 25. Ubuntu server with two ethernet cards:
eth0 - ip 192.168.1.100 connected to a bsnl modem/router ip address  
192.168.1.1
eth1 - ip 192.168.1.126 connected to the lan (doze dhcp lan)
gateway of eth0 is set as 192.168.1.1
gateway of eth1 is set as the eth0 ip - 192.168.1.100

I have squid proxy server running on the linux machine.

When eth1 is not connected to the lan, internet works and i am able  
to ping 192.168.1.1 from the linux machine

when eth1 is connected to the lan, i can ping the doze machine from  
the linux machine and from the doze machine can ping both eth0 and

Hi,
I could not understand your set up
how are the two interfaces communicating ? did you do any ip forwarding?
how is the eth1 going to communicate with eth0 ?

Actually, there is more work involved in maintaining a Linux driver than
there is maintaining a driver for windows because the windows driver API
is pretty stable. This API hardly ever varies between service pack
releases, while on Linux the kernel ABI is not stable as Linux kernel
developers believe that stabilizing this API will mean reducing their
freedom to improve the API later..

Windows drivers don't have to be updated every single time there is a
service pack update. On occasion, the service pack update may drastically
change the driver interface, only then is the user required to change the
windows driver.

On Linux, you need to recompile the driver when you update even point
release of the kernel, which is why Novell has the Partner Linux Driver
Process.

You can develop hardware drivers for windows without signing a single NDA
with MS. The driver development kit is available for free download and the
API is nicely documented.

http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/wdf/wdfbook.mspx
http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/DevTools/ddk/default.mspx

If you need your driver to be windows certified, then you need to go back
to MS.

I think it is a little unfair to say that the only reason source is not
released is because the developers want to hide their dirty code. There
are so many other reasons why companies may choose to close the source
code to their drivers - proprietary algorithms implemented in the driver
is just one of those reasons.

An ascii depiction of your network would help - like so:

                     192.168.1.x
BSNL -----------------------------------------------
        |     |           \  ..  \  ....  \
        UbuntuSrvr       Windows  Thin clients

If the above is your topology then your Windows and Thin clients can by 
pass your proxy server.

Suggest you implement the following:

                     192.168.1.x
BSNL ----        --------------------------------------
        |        |           \  ..  \  ....  \
        Ubuntu_Srvr       Windows  Thin clients

Put the BSNL modem/router and Ubuntu eth0 on a 192.168.0.x network.  
Configure SQUID with Internet iface eth0 and LAN iface eth1.

IMO, putting multiple NICs on the same network makes sense when you want 
to increase network thru put.  For SQUID it is a no no.

All interfaces are in the same network and routing will be bit
confusing. So to simplify the routing, set eth1 to 192.168.2.100 and
client address as 2.4 - 25.

The Nvidia driver (and so also the ATI driver) comes in two parts. The
binary blob which holds the actual code of the driver, and several thin
kernel module interface source files - one each for different point
releases of the Linux kernel.

When you install the driver, the kernel module interface corresponding to
your kernel's version will be compiled and installed - and this kernel
module will in turn load the binary module and forward requests to it.

That is the kernel source file is actually a sort of an interface layer
between the Linux kernel and the binary blob which constitutes the actual
driver. This will most likely introduce some sort of performance penalty
on the use of these drivers on Linux, but I am not sure.

One point though - Nvidia (and I think ATI too) ship with a bunch of
pre-compiled kernel module interfaces for various stock distributions of
Linux kernel. So if you are using one of those stock kernels, the Nvidia
driver installer won't compile the kernel source file.

IMO, there is more headache involved when trying to work with
micro$oft. You can get excellent support from lkml, developer mailing

Just the API. Not what's beneath it :)

See (1) above.

For an end-user. For a developer/tester, prior to releasing the above,
its a PITA.

On the assumption that what beneath the API work fine. When they don't
(most of the time) it is a PITA.

How will this be a performance hit ?
When you run a benchmark test against the linux and windows nvidia drivers, you get the same results.
The same can be said for other drivers which follow a similar model, like madwifi.
You get the same network throughput in both the operating systems.

I am referring to the developer here. The developer will very rarely have
to change the driver or even recompile it for service pack updates.

That is the same binary driver can be used across service packs, for the
most part. So end-users will rarely have to worry about loading new
drivers.

When XP service pack 2 was released, MS had implemented hardware support
for the data execution prevention (DEP) on some chips which includes this
DEP feature. This required changes in the driver architecture and
therefore some drivers had to be modified.

However, for the most part, when you install service packs, you will
rarely have to change the driver.

Are you stating this from previous personal experience developing drivers
for Windows or based on the general assumption that anything from MS must
be bad?

It is one thing to criticize MS for its screw ups (and there have been
many), but it is yet another thing to heap criticism just because the
recipient happens to be MS.

I am no fan of MS, but there are things we can learn from it.

But anyway, my point wasn't about MS. My point was about the reason for
the wide availability of windows drivers for hardware when Linux drivers
are more difficult to find.

MS is not holding a gun to the head of the hardware manufacturers to force
them to release drivers for their hardware. These OEMs release the drivers
for windows willingly because they want their hardware to be used by
windows users who constitute the majority.

OEMs are far less keen to release drivers for Linux is because they may
have done a cost-benefit analysis of releasing drivers for Linux and have
obviously come to the conclusion that the slight increase in sales that
they would receive by making their hardware available for use by
Linux-only users is not enough to offset the investment in driver
development.

It is decision driven by business and not technical considerations.

If the number of Linux reaches a critical mass, you can bet that these
OEMs will be falling over each other to release drivers for Linux so as to
not to lose out on sales.

PK

The performance of Nvidia cards on Linux does lag behind that on windows:

http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=781&num=1

To go directly to the benchmarks:
http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=781&num=3

I am not saying that the reason for the lag is most certainly the
additional kernel interface module required on Linux as a layer between
the kernel and the binary blob which is the actual Nvidia driver, but I
think it may be one of the reasons.

Dear luggies

  I came to know that in SSN college Laptop is compulsory for all
students. I was told that they supply pre-loaded Linux Laptop to them
at concessional rate. It seems students find it difficult to handle
it, as, as  usual they are not familiar with linux.

   Can somebody who has some contact with college/students arrange
for a training session?

May be Aanjhan can take the initiave.

This is primarily in the end-user consumer market.

With "healthy" competition, I hope to see this in future.

To followup, the performance difference of ATI drivers on Linux and
windows is even more stark.

Yes, that is a known issue.
The same performance hit is seen in Vista too with the newer Geforce 8 series of cards.
One probable reason for this is because of the shared codebase 
between Windows/BSD/Solaris/Linux.

ATI has a horrendous track record of linux drivers.
I can personally vouch for this because I have a Radeon Mobility X1400 and the closed
source fglrx drivers absolutely suck.
Artifacts all over the screen and the performance is lower than the Intel chipsets which happen
to have open source drivers.

Hi all

That was good to hear.I was there till last year, and i know the amount of
interest people in my college show towards Linux.The number of people who
attended the couple of workshops which was organized last year proves that
fact. I will ask some of my juniors and will follow it up and if necessary
get help from ilugc and arrange some sort of workshop.

I dont know if the students who got the laptops are still with linux or they
had put windoz because of the lack of FOSS awareness among them(Laptop is
compulsory only for current First year students who are just out of school).

If it is compulsory from now onwards, I think we should use this
opportunity quickly, before students put on proprietory stuffs.

This has become usual in my case, I have given up all hopes and
expectations of getting it delivered at my home at all. I did not get
it for the past 3 months, but it has come this month. I have reported
them a lot of times. Sometimes I even got a reply that the courier guy
reported them that the consignment was delivered and signed by me,
leaving me to wonder who signed for me (surely none at home).

Same here! Right from December 2006 when I started my subscription, I
face the same problem. I used to send two or three mails each and
every month to get my copy. Even I ve asked the customer care dept,
whether I need to set up a cron job to send a mail at the beginning of
every month in order to remind them to send me my LFY copy ;)

As usual this month _also_ I haven received my copy yet :(

what linux? is it the commandline linux that is 'not a complete OS'?  
In which case it is impossible to train them on it as it is useless.  
I am cc-ing prof Srinivasan on this so the can find out exactly  
what's going on and do the needful

unfortunately not. You have to download IE and the ie license clearly  
states that you can only use it on specifically designated operating  
systems - the list of OSs is given and linux does not find a place  
there.

Even if gnu/linux becomes a monopoly on the desktop market., the
linux-kernel wont have a stable driver api. Reason being it is
simply not practical. And., the hardware-vendors wont be able to
match up with the kernel-developers in releasing drivers for every
version of the linux-kernel.

The preferred way of distributing drivers for the Linux kernel is
to publish the driver source under the GPL or provide the specs
for the hardware so that a Free software implementation can be
written.

Funny. The college was started by Shiv Nadar of HCL and they are a RH 
Linux support partner IIRC. A letter to Shiv Nadar will actually do the job.

better we all write a request to care@irctc.co.in so that we all can benefit 
in course of time...

also we can request our friends etc., to do the same...

if our request isn't met we shall think of alternate things..to achieve 
it.. :-)

I knew laptops are being given and made compulsory. One more thing is
Computer Based tutorials are being given on Cds. Something that is new
is that these laptops are being loaded with Linux.

Hi all,
         I was playing/trying around with the chennai mirror as its
listed as the only archive mirror from India & came to following
conclusions/observations. I'm sure a part of this I also put up
sometime back.  :-

1. https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors :- This lists the IITM
mirror as atleast a week back. Is this true? I find it hard to believe
that we are that back. Of course with 3 distributions there is quite a
bit of syncing to do everyday & I dunno how the priorities are set up.
As a ubuntu user so of course would be biased in looking after that.

2. First of all its cool, just great that you guys have rsync
happening. Now, while  I was playing around with rsync & decided to
give an another archive mirror just to see how rsync behaves with both
of them :-

First up just browsing one of  the mirrors in Europe

 rsync mirror.etf.bg.ac.yu::

centos          the iitm centos mirror site
ubuntu          the iitm ubuntu mirror site

Now that was a big let-down, somebody could have put up a nice ASCII
or something which tells about India or something, also the info. they
have given, for somebody like me or anybody who does rsync as to whom
to connect in case the server is down or something or some other issue
I have.

wow hit pay dirt & it was so easy. I could rsync to the .iso if I want to .

I tried to see if I could get the .iso releases somewhere.

I would be looking at it in another couple of days just to see if the
time-stamp remains the same or not. If it changes then clearly there
seems to be an issue with the way ubuntu is reporting about the
archive mirror.

I'm sure along with me you guys also found rsync pretty interesting.

May you rsync in interesting times ;)

Cheers!

Code for Freedom

Sun Microsystems, India launched the "Code for
Freedom" contest for University students in India.

http://in.sun.com/communities/univ/codeforfreedom/

Here is what the website has to say,

    Sixty years ago, just as India awoke to freedom,
we call upon the young minds of India to awake to the
clarion call of Open Source. The Open Source movement
is emerging as the new new world order making a
sweeping impact in the technology sector across the
world. Today, Open Source products such as Apache Web
Server, Open Office and Linux have dwarfed several
proprietary software corporations.

    Sun Microsystems, a front-runner in professionally
backing Open Source and one of the largest
contributors to this movement, takes this opportunity
to invite the young, dynamic academic community of
India to come and become a part of the exciting Open
Source wave. We encourage you all to embrace the Open
Source technologies with open hands and help take
these communities to greater heights.

    With this vision, Sun Microsystems is happy to
announce the Code For Freedom contest where students
across India contribute to the technologies that are
empowering the participation age. Participating in
this contest will provide you with precious industry
experience while still learning in college. And there
is more. We in turn reward you for your valuable
contribution in taking the first steps towards the
open source movement.

    Come. Be a part of this phenomenon called, Open
Source.

        Umm. Where can one find this "commandline" distribution? 

        I am also somewhat bemused by the assertion that a user
 interaction mode defines what is and is not a complete operating
 system. I always thought that the TI lisp machine had a complete OS,
 but hey.

I think KG is referring to the "command-line-linux" which laptop
vendors often talk about, wherein the laptop components will not be
fully functional till a fully functional OS (no, not Debian ot Ubuntu)
is installed.

Sad, isn't it?

Linux Journal Tech Tip: Automatic Login with MySQL

This tip comes from Sirgey in Ontario, Canada:

When running non-interactive MySQL commands one may submit MySQL
credentials on the command line, e.g.:

mysql --password=secret --user=username database_name < query.sql

This approach has two drawbacks. First, it is not secure. Second, if
you have many scripts with embedded passwords you will have to take
care of all of them when the time comes to change your password. A
better option is to use a special option file to store login
information. At start up, all MySQL programs read from one or more
global option files, and lastly from the file called .my.cnf in the
user's home directory, if such file exists. All option files have the
same format which consists of a section name followed by options. All
valid command line arguments can be specified in the option file. For
example to enable automatic login your .my.cnf file should look like
this:

# the following section will be read by *all* client programs
[client]
user=username
password=secret
database=database_name

Of course, when creating this file make sure it is only user readable!
Now you can run the batch query with a more simple command which is
suitable for non-interactive jobs, e.g., scheduled with crontab:

mysql < query.sql

And most certainly you can now launch an interactive session with this
compact command:

   mysql

If you need to connect to a different databases or use another user
names it is always possible to override the settings of the option
file on the command line.

Another advantage of using user's option file is that it is very easy
to create an ad-hoc MySQL clients that can be automatically
initialized with user's credentials and other private settings. Here's
how you can do it in Python with the help of the standard module
ConfigParser:

import  ConfigParser
config = ConfigParser.ConfigParser()
# read ~/.my.cnf if it exists but don't raise error if it doesn't
config.read(['site.cfg', os.path.expanduser('~/.my.cnf')])
if config.has_section("client"):
  # got options for MySQL clients
  if config.has_option("client", "password"):
    # got default password
    pass = config.get("client", "password")

IEs4Linux itself is athe sript which does the install for you, and is
GPLd. but the very same website says:
"But IE is proprietary, copyrighted, and you have to accept their
license."

Which means that "you need a valid Windows license. IEs4Linux will not
ask for it and you can run everything without any problem even if you
don't have a license. But it is illegal and a I have nothing to do
with this."

i completely disagree with storing password as plain text in my.cnf. since
any user can be able to read it if he has login, it is not advisable.

Why do you think it won't be practical?

If you want to know how practical (or not) the current approach is, please
do read up on the the kind of trouble enterprise linux vendors are facing
when it comes to managing the driver modules, please see:
http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/enterprise_kernel_future.html

If the driver API is stable, the OEMs will need to release drivers only
occasionally, and not as often as they have to do now. Which means that
they will be able to maintain the drivers themselves without requiring
external developers to write drivers for their hardware.

That would be the *ideal* case, but life is far from ideal.

far, so specific plan of action. HoD promised to get back by next week
with more info. She will also be checking with the lecturers who have
attended the FOSS Teachers' training programmes. Have offered her that
LUG / NRCFOSS could help out with trng/workshop/projects.

As often claimed in the media, we want to be the next super-power, we
are seen as the IT powerhouse providing world-class services to the
rest of the world; but, when it comes to providing such simple
services to internal clients in this nation, things go awry !

I have such on-going subscription problems with IT & non-IT magazines
of both genre.

No software is ever 100% bug-free. Every piece of software goes
through constant refactoring to make it better. So., if the OEM
guys release at such large intervals it means one of the two.,

     (1) Their driver code is perfect and does not need
     refactoring.

     (2) They dont care (not a business issue) that their code is
     performing poorly or has bugs.

I really dont think it is (1). So., it makes a lot of sense to
make the driver source available to the community so that the
community and other interested third party will take care of the
issues.

Yes., and we cannot deny that a lot of hardware vendors are moving
to this model. So maybe soon life will indeed become ideal :)

How about taking the read permissions away from everybody else except you?

API usually stays stable. Fortunately and unfortunately (whatever you
may call it), the in kernel API which matters to the hardware
manufacturers remains stable mostly. Only way it breaks is when a
major subsystem gets a rework to fix some xyz regression. Aliter still
then the API is kept intact for legacy drivers like ones OEM may be
using. The deprecated API may vanish but not so soon. There is a
certain time frame given. Linux kernel is fast, very fast moving
software. Terminally dead API get rewritten or removed entirely.
Porting a driver across API changes[and not kernels i mean here] is
not very difficult.
But as Joe rightly said the best way to get over this is to publish a
driver as a GPLed code and get it merged in the official kernel
tree(another difficult task).

If hardware manufacturers do not care about their drivers, its their
headache IMO. They should be ready to update the drivers like any
other software i think. And if they do not want to, better get it
included in the kernel tree.

My 2 cents.

Its actually quite interesting that the quality checking process
(peer review) in an Open Source project is more stringent than in
any other proprietary software company :D

yes, thats one of the reason you ll find occasional flamewars between
corporate kernel developers and kernel hackers. I wonder when will it
take for whole world to realize that open source development model is
a far superior development model than any closed source ones.

Every user history will have .bash_history file (if you are using bash
) which store the history of the commands issued by the user.

I don't think i am the best person to answer this but AFAICS you may
need something like

pinky

or a small shell script with some sed and awk included to find the
processes running on behalf which user.

Coming to the OP, I believe there are magazine editors on this mailing

The links I have posted and the one you posted both contradict your
statement that porting a driver across API changes is not very difficult.

Actually, it is *very* time consuming, tedious and difficult to maintain
the modules across so many different kernel releases. Please read those
links again.

The job of backporting changes from different upstream kernel releases to
various kernel modules literally takes months and is currently only
happening because Novell, Redhat etc have a lot of paid staff working on
this.

Are you sure? Ultimately all it means is that Linux users don't get to use
the latest and greatest hardware. As for the OEMs, we (Linux users) are
such a minuscule percentage of the market, they couldn't care less if we
didn't buy their hardware.

I don't want to repeat myself, but I have addressed this point earlier in
the thread. Market reach is everything when it comes to Linux user's
ability to get hardware manufacturers to provide drivers.

PK

No link was not to support me at all but just to tell that its mere
Greg's perception. We cannot say who is right and who is wrong
accurately. I guess i was unclear in what i intended to tell.
Apologies for not being clear.

And thus as by now you may have guess my last mail was my perception
not Dave's or Greg's.

I said across API changes. I do it so i know its not too much
difficult for a hardware manufacturer who has access to everything,
hardware specs , kernel src , API changes etc etc.

So if they are doing for their customers(read hardware manufacturers),
it should not be very difficult to use the backported feature. Maybe
roll out a new driver as a beta version to check something breaks, and
get it fixed in the upstream too in process. This is how Open source
benefits in the end i guess.

I meant headache to port, not users as they only have the access to
their specs .Give me the specs i ll do it for free. :)

Your point is justified. What are the possible solutions?
Ask OEMs to release GPLed drivers, get it included upstream? Or give
us the specs?

May be there is a NO for all these from the OEMs.

Only soultion i see. Do the homework before buying any hardware for
its linux compatibility. e.g try buying Intel's graphics card and
wireless cards as drivers are open sourced and thus well maintained,
you find a bug you get the fix in 1 day.

And who knows maybe this will prompt OEMs also to publish their
driver's as GPL code.

wishful thinking you can say .

Sorry again for being unclear in my last mail.

thanks

I agree. Open source is a superior model of development. I think the world
already realizes that to some extent.

However, the problem with the driver situation in Linux is not a problem
of the development model, but rather of architecture.

The Linux kernel architecture does not include a driver ABI - and that was
a deliberate decision to force companies to release the source for the
drivers.. actually, Linus did relent somewhat and released some support in
the kernel module architecture to allow for the kernel module interfaces
to be called from non-GPLed modules.

http://ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0110.2/0369.html

However, as a side effect of this, we have fewer hardware drivers.

Some interesting notes to this:

all it says is that you have to conform to m$ license. M$ license  
clearly says that it can only be used on specified OSs - win98, NT  
etc etc. So it is illegal to use it on linux

how is it OT? it is related to linux, members of LFY are members of  
this list, they regularly post to it, so this list is a good place to  
flame them

OP meant this to be a discussion on ways to make irctc sympathetic to
firefox users also. But the thread is hijacked into a discussion on how
legal it is to use ie4linux!

If we can get back to the topic........

How about putting up an open letter on the chennailug site with a request to
irctc, explaining the problem, how easy it is to solve, how unfair it is on
users, how a semi-govt web site is being used to promote a commercial
product etc and maybe even APJK's exhortation to use open source.....

Maybe addressed to Lalu Prasad Yadav. If soneone with contacts in the
newspapers can make them cover this.... who knows, he might take this
seriously :-)

Interesting response to a complaint from aggrieved customers, to say the
least! Do you know Kenneth well and is this response in jest, or was that
stated seriously? I hope it was said only in jest for your sake.

Nice move, Amachu :-)

Write back saying you cannot go through IE because you are on a linux system
and our ex-president told us not to use Microsoft :-).

It will be nice if you can host your mail exchange on the chennailug site.

Thats really great news :-).
Though India has voted against and i am very very happy for it , it
does sound alarming to me that some of the Indian IT companies were
pro OOXML. The reason some gave, MS standard give good compatibility
with older formats and smooth transition.
I wonder what makes these firms think on these lines?

Thoughts?
thanks

use one way replication. and run a shell script to back it up every 1 hour
or so if you need hard backup... If it is a production system, it is better
to use replication. Please check mysql documentation for details.

I dont want to schedule the process like you said everyone hour there
might be a loss of data if the server crashes between that.

I have one slice so i can't do replication too.  Sorry i forgot to
mention this.

If you are ready for performance trade-off, enable logging in mysql.
Write a script to parse the log file every minute and pass on the sqls
(insert, update, delete and which sql you like) to different mysql
server on same machine or mysql server on different machine.

Another possible work around is to mirror the data directory using
rsync command periodically. I'm not sure if this would suit the
purpose.

Again, if you are not willing to do it every minute, probably you can
write the mysql log to a pipe directly. Have a script to read from
pipe continuously, parse and fire the sqls for another mysql server.
I've not tried this before and I'm unaware of performance implications
if any.

Strange, as per their suggestion the BIS is only viewable in MSIE 4.0 or
greater.

---------Posting on behalf of Rahul Chopra, Editor, Linux For You----------

Hi all,

Niraj's post represents the confusion (and frustration) that the team was 
undergoing when they were trying to resolve customer complaints, and yet 
were faced with instructions ranging from--'keep this discussion off the 
list' to 'take action or else...'.

The latest issue of LFY (Debian special) has experienced some major problems 
w.r.t. delivery. We have pulled up the courier agency (Professional 
Couriers) and may shift back to the Indian postal system where the magazines 
and disks were sent separately--an Indianised strategy that seemingly 
results in least complaints.

However, we do apologise to:

1. Kenneth, for calling him... However, we do plead him to take us as part 
of the community world, and not treat us as some evil force :-)

2. The members of this LUG who had requested us to not to post any messages 
w.r.t. that complaint. We tried, but could not hold back, since it was clear 
that taking discussions offline might be interpreted as 'LFY not interested 
in their customers' by the rest.

3. Most importantly, our subscribers--who've faced issues since we've been 
experimenting with courier agencies. We'll surely correct this asap. In the 
meantime, if ever there's a delay in receipt of copies--please do shoot an 
email to support@efyindia.com and niraj@efyindia.com (he (tries to) build 
relations with the community). You may also mark me a CC at 
lfyedit@efyindia.com.

May the source remain with us too, through these testing times...

Yours truly,
Rahul Chopra

as Bhuvaneswaran already said, your best option is to enable mysql's
binlog. What size / type db are you running ? its usually a good idea to
put the binlogs on a different drive / spindleset from the main db
storage. Firstly, it increases data reliability but more importantly (
to me anyway ) it reduces the performance degradation you are likely to
see by enabling binlogs

I dont consider you people an evil force ;-} But I think you people  
should be a little more tactful in dealing with the community. And as  
far as the mailing list is concerned, it is best to respond on the  
list to the complaint made on  the list. There will always be some  
mutual suspicion and distrust between members of a LUG and a  
commercial institution. LFY is not the only one - there are people  
who look on Redhat with suspicion! And Indian companies very rarely  
admit that there is a defect, even if they rectify it - I  
congratulate you on your honesty in this respect.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0708241840480.2374-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

India_throws_Microsoft_open_format_out_of_the_window/articleshow/2305780.cms
(url has wrapped)

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday gave Microsoft a thumbs-down in the war
of standards for office documents. In a tense meeting at Delhi's Manak
Bhawan, the 21-member technical committee decided that India will vote
a 'no' against Microsoft's Open Office Extensible Mark Up Language
(OOXML) standard at the International Standards Organisation (ISO) in
Geneva on September 2.

"We unanimously agree on the disapproval of OOXML with comments. The
same will be submitted to ISO," National Informatics Centre head and
BIS technical committee chairperson Nita Verma said after a marathon
meeting that lasted over six hours. There was no need for a voting as
only Infosys Technologies and CSI supported Microsoft.

The Open Document Format (ODF) alliance, enjoying widespread support
from academia and corporates like Oracle, IBM, Red Hat, Sun
Microsystems, Google, were in a jubilant mood having succeeded in
stalling OOXML from being accepted as a standard in India.

Microsoft said it respect's the government's decision. "There were
only three options `Yes', `No' and `Abstain' to be taken and we
respect the government's decision," Microsoft's legal affairs head
Rakesh Bakshi said. He, however, added that India's 'No' vote will
become a 'Yes' if Microsoft is able to resolve all technical issues
with OOXML before the ballot resolution committee of ISO.

Prof DB Phatak of IIT Mumbai, who was instrumental in conducting the
meetings, looked relieved after being flooded with calls from both
camps over the week.

Speaking to ET outside the BIS premises, the Microsoft camp complained
that when ODF was being standardised by ISO, they did not oppose it
and now the ODF camp refused to return the favour. ODF supporters said
they would have no problems with OOXML if all the 200 technical issues
were taken care of.

Amongst hectic lobbying from both camps, the US government on Thursday
said that it will abstain from voting. China has already voted a 'No'
against Microsoft, while Malaysia, Denmark and Switzerland are
supporting the software major.

A global alliance of Sun-IBM, Oracle, Google, Red Hat have ganged up
against Microsoft which is being supported by Apple, Quark, Accenture
and Novell. 

On Indian soil, Infosys, HCL, Skelta, Sonata Software and Sify have
come out in support of Microsoft.

September 2 is the last date to submit the vote with comments to ISO.
About 123 counties are participating in the vote. Votes from most are
still to come. Canada, Czech Republic, Iran, Japan, Libya, Cuba, New
Zealand, UK are likely to back the IBM-Sun's ODF Alliance. On the
other hand, Belgium, Finland, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Singapore, Korea,
France and Australia are likely to abstain from voting.

Dear Bharathi S
already i made a request to Mr. Umashaker to include "Center" or "School
Tool" for school management along with "Moodle" in the computers which will
be given to schools.

we also need the following

# unique e-mail id for all the school based on their school ID [ Public Exam
School Number ]
# UserGroup for schools
# common website for TN schools to mange the technical issues
# Open / Wiki Database of school address
# List of FOSS suitable for TN schools
# Text books in PDF format
   and few more issues....

As you know, Education and Examination Dept. are also involved in the above
issues, ELCOT might have some constrains and considerations.

I am thankful to ELCOT and Mr. Umashankar for their continuing support for
computer education in schools.


kindly include this in your discussions.

have  a nice day

thiagu

note :
long back [ in 2000 ] i have created an usergroup called "tncomped" which
was requested by Dr. Anandhakrishnan, along with a link
www.geocities.com/tncomped.  Due to time constrain , i made it inactive.

You can do browsing from command line using lynx/links/w3m. OR If
you want to use GUI, then ssh with "Enables X11 forwarding (-X, read
man ssh)" and run the firefox from command line of remote pc.

Message-ID: <e977d4310708250304p69c6ea73k6b9ca2839f334326@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

For the past few months, I have been facing a funny (and costly)
problem. When I switch on my PC's power supply, all the peripherals
come to life, except the CPU. Though it powers on, it doesnt boot up.
I have to hold the power switch for 10 seconds (to switch off) and try
powering on again. I have to repeat this exercise at least 5 to 10
times before the PC actually boots up. I have not been able to trace
the root cause of this problem. Does the problem ring any bells for
any one of you?

Problem 2: quite strangely, the devices connected to my USB for a long
time have blown up. So far, I have lost a Web Cam, an USB Blue tooth
dongle, A printer cum scanner and a 4 GB SD Card connected to a Card
reader. The printer/scanner works fine as a copier when not connected
to my PC. But my PC doesn't seem to recognize the device.

The following is what I see in my System log.

Deskjet_F300_series?serial=CN6CFGK36304KH	INFO: open device failed;
will retry in 30 seconds...
hpiod	unable to Device::Open
hp:/usb/Deskjet_F300_series?serial=CN6CFGK36304KH io/hpiod/device.cpp
929

Google wasn't of much help this time over for me.

Has any one of you faced similar problems? what is the way out?


My system Config:
Pentium 4 2.4 MHz, 1.5 GB DDR1, runs on Kubuntu Feisty Fawn

TIA,

Regards,
Natarajan

Is your SMPS fine?
Looks like either your power supply is broken or may be you need to
replace your RAM.

If you want full desktop like kde,gnome  run
startkde or gnome-session
after connecting through ssh [X11forwarding enabled].

Alternatively, you can use Xnest inside present X to call remote.
xdmcp should be true in gdm/kdm.

Alternatively in runlevel 3, run X -query remote to get remote
display manager login. For this you should set xdmcp enable option to
true in gdm.conf or kdmrc

Loot at XDMCP-HOWTO in tldp.org for more details.

Yep, you might need to check your PSU.
My desktop had a PSU that one day decided to blow up in flames.
My motherboard was completely hosed.

Prior to the blowing up, I had random freezes and the CPU refusing to boot up.
Incidentally, the SMPS that I had was a Coolermaster 600W monster.

in that case:
1. It is advisable to have a stabilizer/UPS - if you use raw power,  
everything will blow
2. Check the earthing
3. Check that the line and neutral are not reversed
4. replace the SMS on your CPU

Message-ID: <809586140708260042k3273ddfau58b7eee94bc6a94b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am facing a similar kind of issue as the irctc.co.in issue on the
list a few days back. But this is more technical. I was trying to
register my HSBC internet banking from hsbc.co.in when I got this
error "SSL Enforcement"

"The browser you are using is currently set at a lower strength of
encryption than is required to access your HSBC Internet Banking
services.

Please click one of the following links below. These links will guide
you to where you can upgrade/download the 128-bit encryption for your
browser.

                                         Netscape         Internet Explorer
"

To let you know, I am using Firefox 2.0.0.6 (With SSL 3 Enabled and
TLS 1.0 enabled and even SSL 2 is tweaked to be enabled) on FC3. I
don't understand in which way is it less secure. I have already put up
this issue with HSBC. I would like to know whether my browser supports
128 bit SSL (I think it can upto 256bit). I have googled and came to
this already existing issue in Korea
(http://www.kanai.net/weblog/archive/2007/01/26/00h53m55s). I think
HSBC uses ActiveX controls. I would like to know the tweak in FF to
help me with this issue. I have already tweaked it to enable SSL 2
(which was disabled because of SSL3). I even tried changing the FF
identity as IE7 but nothing worked. Is the M$ monopoly playing here.
Can any one help me???

Strange. I can load upto the registration screen in firefox trunk 
(minefield) - and by then it is certainly ssl encrypted, shows me the yellow 
URL box with a lock in it that means the link is ssl encrypted.

Also - fyi, I have had an account for 6 years or so in HSBC Hong Kong, and 
those guys use the same systems .. have had zero problems accessing it using 
firefox on linux / windows .. haven't ever had to fire up IE 7 for this.

Thanks for the responses. I got my SMPS replaced and it does boot up
properly now. This is the third SMPS for my PC. At Pammal we get 240V
50Hz electricity from TNEB :(.

I did check my Earthing and neutral. they are fine. My printer started
working properly after changing my SMPS (!!!!????). I am not sure
about the relationship between these?

Get a good UPS - preferably something rated a bit higher - 650 VA or even 1 
kVA

And get a good brand like APC - dont buy cheap random / unknown UPS brands. 
A few hundred rupees extra for a good UPS will save the rest of your 
peripherals

Learnt that the hard way after an earlier PC that had an ATI radeon card in 
it blew .. and that too in Adyar, which has a rather better power situation 
than Pammal thanks to so many politicians and officials living in the area, 
so that the TNEB is a bit more careful about providing good service here.

Caution - don't power laser printers with an UPS.  Use a voltage 
stabilizer to protect it.

Next step - make sure your power strip that you plug into the UPS, and that 
has all your peripherals and your PC plugged into it, is ALSO of good 
quality, ideally with separate switches for each plug point, instead of one 
central switch, and with a line filter built into it.

Oh, and test the power strip sockets for proper earthing, polarity reversal 
etc

Another few hundred rupees on buying a good strip won't go wrong. And it 
will save you a lot of money.

You are very lucky. There is no problem with the HSBC HK Site
(http://www.ebanking.hsbc.com.hk). This loads the registration page
perfectly under my FF 2.0. They use RC4 128 bit encryption. Every
thing is fine with their HK site. But it is a different story in
India. I remember enabling RC4 128 bit in FF. For each site may be
they are using different encryption algorithms or some new kind of
strategy to avoid phishing. I don't know what is happening until I get
back from them.

Even I am from the same place. Sometimes there are power surges in our
area that can wipe out your PC completely until you have additional
protection in place. The power from TNEB is highly unreliable and
erratic. As everyone suggests, check the earthing and go for a good
branded UPS (an UPS that meets your power requirements and is stable
and reliable). Also make sure that you purchase a branded SMPS.

 Could you please verify the IP addresses you have posted. Given the
current setup, your windows and thin clients will easily bypass the
proxy. You need to break the setup in two subnets. 192.168.1.x talks
to the bsnl router and 192.168.y.z talk to normal lan. And yes do a
google search on 'NAT'.

Subject: [Ilugc] differences between konq and ff in playing sound
Message-ID: <6BCA137A-F88C-4091-BD92-67EAE2E147CF@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

I have this code:

       <script>
       function EvalSound(soundobj) {
         var thissound=document.getElementById(soundobj);
         thissound.Play();
       }
       </script>

       <embed src="success.wav" autostart=false width=0 height=0  
id="sound1"
       enablejavascript="true">

       <form>
       <input type="button" value="Play Sound" onClick="EvalSound 
('sound1')">
       </form>

In konq, it plays on every alternate press of the button. In firefox  
it plays sometimes. If i have another button that runs thissound.Stop 
(), in konq, the play button plays, the stop button stops, so after  
clicking the stop button, the play button will play the sound. If I  
dont use the stop button, it plays on every alternate click of the  
play button.

In firefox the play button plays the sound occasionaly. But on  
clicking the stop button it plays every time

if I do this:

<script>
       function EvalSound(soundobj) {
         var thissound=document.getElementById(soundobj);
         thissound.Play();
	thissound.Stop();
       }
       </script>

In firefox, it plays on every click. In konq it never plays. Any clues?

i dont know how to do it in doze - i *did* try to change the doze  
machines to 192.168.2.x - I could change the IP of the server, but  
when I tried to change the dhcp to 192.168.2.3-25, it kept saying  
'invalid address range'

I notice a considerable quality difference when playing music in linux
(debian , ubuntu , suse) and in windows.
I am using a via chipset.
Have noticed this in gnome and kde (using alsa and oss ).

I find the quality much superior when playing it in windows.
Am I missing something ?
or is it a driver issue .
I thought via supported linux drivers.
I have not installed installed any driver myself , as the kernel seems to
have via sound drivers builtin .

Kindly let me know , if there is any solution.

You have not mentioned the kind of music you play but presume you are 
playing the "same" source files through the same hardware under Windows 
and Linux and under same settings e.g. output levels, equalizer etc.

Nonetheless, this is subjective.  Each of us have different audio and 
visual capabilities.  For example, I can notice the flicker on CRT 
monitors for vert. refresh rates < 70Hz.  Whereas, many of my 
colleagues don't notice the flicker at all even @ 60Hz.

> Kindly let me know , if there is any solution.

Try updating to the latest version of the resp. codec libraries - just a 
thought.

It might be because of various reasons.. Check gnome log files under
/var/log and give the error messages..

It could be because of incompatible gnome configuration. Updating gnome will
usually leave the config files untouched.. Trace down which config file is
creating this issue..

Message-ID: <5ff65e910708270325o657dc1d3vfad0aca435f1bf4d@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have a firewall (Debian sarge 2.6.8-1) with 3 interfaces.
eth1 -> ISP (202...)                                        256 Kbps down /
80 Kbps up
eth0 -> Department 1 (192.168.0.0/24)
eth2 -> Department 2 (192.168.10.0/24)
(I use IPtables and squid as an intercepting(transparent) proxy)

This is what I want to do:

>From 7.45am - 8.45am and from 4pm to 6pm
Department 2 should get to use atleast 224 Kbps and Department 1 atleast 32
Kbps

Other times,
Department 1 should get atleast 192 Kbps.

(of course, any spare bandwidth can be used by any one).
As of now, my priority is not in classifying bulk/interactive traffic.

I am a little confused as to what to do.  According to LARTC, qdiscs are for
only one interface.  Do I have to do ingress policing ? Or IMQ ?


Please advice me.  As some other people also have to maintain the firewall,
a not so difficult to understand solution would be very helpful.

There are many logs you can look into..

/var/log/Xorg.0.log
~/.ICEauthority
~/.xsesison-errors

Instead of logging in with the same user, try creating a new user and try
logging in.

May Google bless you.. :)

Subject: [Ilugc] Reg MUKT open source festival at Govt Institute of
	Electronics - Hyderabad...
Message-ID: <ed2d3c000708270407r50f0d7b5tea47982512274d6b@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

It is indeed a pleasure to share my thoughts on mukt.in the open
source festival held in Hyderabad. Mukt is initiated by Atul jha and
Srikrishna, Supported by Pavitran of NRCFOSS, Sudharshan of
ILUGC,Students of Govt institute of Electronics Secundarabad,
Thejaswani and a friend from Google and of course myself.

I gave a talk on career oppurtunities through foss, and pointed to
fossjobs.wordpress.com. I joined the festival on the second day (25
aug 2007) Srikrishna displayed the power of beryl , installation
procedure done by sudharshan and on the third day Pavitran gave a talk
on Localiasation, i gave a presentation on agile web app development
with RoR. Indeed it was a great success, kudos to the team.

The difference made by these youngsters are appreciatable, they
exhibited leadership qualities and we had a perfect chemistry in
executing the work.
As usual (like Birla planetarium and Ramanujam Engg College) the HoD
was reluctant and however we manage to address about 200 students.

I could see and appreciate our unity when i heard that ILUGH is
divided into two groups and practically no support to this festival
other than the two friends came up to address the crowd. I heard that
the organiser of mukt approached several people for assistance , some
responded positively. With many hurdles guys had manage to pull a
success out of many odds.

I thank my company which supported me in  participating  in the event.
I will update the list with photographs as and when i get  the url.

regards

You need to use tc or squid pools. tc gives you better control. Squid 
can be used to mark packets (FWMARK or TOS) based on request originator 
address and use the mark in tc for classification into appropriate 
classes. Squid supports tcp_outgoing_tos directive in acl where src 
address cacn be used.

Useful sites are

Forgot to mention that fwmark is useful only if the m/c running squid is 
also the edge router else use TOS/DSMARK.

Reason: fwmark is part of packet context and does not travel out of the 
box. TOS/DSMARK is part of the packet headers and can be used by 
downstream edge equipment.

Check the PCM level in alsamixer. For me, if it is in red color, the sound
output is distorted.

shell to tcsh?

Hi Bharathi,
            I wish this same seminar happens in Pune. I would happily
pay the said amt. I really need to learn about Iptables, although its
for home but still would be fun.  ;)

Hi people,
I hope this is not a common question, but I just can't get yum to work.
I am using a fc6 machine behind the iitm proxy servers. They use squid I
think.
I have tried setting environment vars such as http_proxy=
http://username:password@proxy.iitm.ac.in:port,
but with no success. I have tried a million times but I keep getting an
X-Cache miss and Access denied from the iitm proxy servers.
Any help or insight would be appreciated.

You _have_ to use ntlmaps. Once you get ntlmaps running, the proxy
http://localhost:5865 will work fine.

NTLmaps instructions are here:

HTH.

Sorry, this was the wrong fix!

I aplogize for this reply, it was wrong! I thought this was asked in a
different situation, and belonged to a different list.

Oh no! It was the right fix, since he is using the IITM servers...

I think I should turn to meditation for concentration or something! :-(

Yes same hardware , same files and default settings , which is without
enabling the equilizers.
I do a dist-upgrade atleast once a week. So its all updated .
I am sure I am missing out some package or driver or something .
Just want to figure out what it is.

this is not a completely accurate. As far as I know, the Hyderabad  
LUG is pretty active - it has an active mailing list and fairly  
regularly has meetings on the last saturday of the month. I have  
attended one of the meetings and it had a good crowd. The speakers  
are funded and they have had some very good speakers at times. Each  
LUG is different, and I do not think that any LUG should comment on  
the internal affairs of LUGs in other cities. Every city has some  
dead LUGs - I think, looking at yahoogroups, there are even several  
so-called LUGs in Chennai also.

NRC-FOSS was approached by the organisers for support and funding,  
but we pointed out that the organisers had not involved the local  
LUG, and that we would like to support activities through the local  
LUG/FSUG as far as possible. The organisers were members of the LUG  
mailing list, and they should have put the proposal on the mailing  
list. If they had not got response, that is another matter. They  
should have at least tried. We asked them to address the mailing  
list, and they got some response, although it was very late in the  
day. Quite a few people were positive about it, and some of them  
participated. If they had done this at the outset, there would have  
been much more impact.

I am replying at length to this, as I feel that people should realise  
that the way to approach a LUG is *not* by privately speaking to  
office bearers, but by joining the mailing list and putting forward  
ideas there. Later arrangements can be done by private mails. So  
spreading something like ILUGH is inactive and didnt support the  
initiative is not good. The mailing list was approached at the last  
minute, when everything was finalised. What do you expect them to do?

I appreciate the good job the organisers have done - but it could  
have been much better if the LUG had been involved from the start. I  
hope at least in future they will do so. Any report of the event in  
the LUG mailing list?

True its strange. But with reference to the ntlmaps. I tried that long back
and it cupped too. Any idea why?
When I run main.py of ntlmaps, I get the following:


NTLM authorization Proxy Server v0.9.9.6
Copyright (C) 2001-2005 by Dmitry Rozmanov, Darryl Dixon, and others.
ERROR: Unable to get the IP address of this machine.  This is not a fatal
problem, but may cause problems for you using this proxy in some scenarios.
Now listening at annlab2 on port 5865

In yum.conf I have set the proxy as:
proxy = http://127.0.0.1:5865

Still get the same errors when I run yum:

Dear Friends


"this is not a completely accurate. As far as I know, the Hyderabad
LUG is pretty active - it has an active mailing list and fairly
regularly has meetings on the last saturday of the month. I have
attended one of the meetings and it had a good crowd."


" Each LUG is different, and I do not think that any LUG should comment on
the internal affairs of LUGs in other cities. Every city has some
dead LUGs - I think, looking at yahoogroups, there are even several
so-called LUGs in Chennai also."

I was not telling that ILUGH is active or inactive, instead i am
recording the fact about the population which turned for the event
because i was physically present there. I am not penetrating into the
issues related to the internals of lug, but certainly have *freedom*
to record my experience with the event.

If ILUGH is active, its a positive and good news as they do the same
job what we do. Please any one in the list correct me if i am wrong,
In my opinion, youngsters who come up with ideas of such, should be
greeted for reasons young minds are corrupt free,free from power
crazy, agile and pro development, if one individual float his idea, it
will be nice if  some one in the mailing list to take it
forward.Needless these young boys should be expected to float a thread
in the list. I learn it from them that they were literally not given
support from the FSF AP and some so called "stalwart of the
community". I could now understand they were missing the conveyor who
is a mailing list citizen.

I could learn from Kg's post the procedures of conducting a lug event,
friends in the same list can understand what hurdle we had when we
conducted our LDD at Birla planetarium, Some of us had the idea for
sponsorship, many said we can put it from our pocket and we did it the
way of the majority. in my thought principle and passion are par above
than  the procedures, when the deeds are right.

 I do agree with kg that there were lack of planning in some areas, I
am not blaming for some one not turning up, The thread was to record
my thoughts in appreciating the effort of the young boys who exhibited
the leadership qualities and character in the event. Importantly i
could see all the "I"'s are been dissolved and felt the "We" in the
event.  There is all ways second time, Great work team once again.

Kudos to tyago and sup3rkidoo for helping us in making things possible as we
wanted in order to have our event big success.
As far as LUG-H participation is concerned i have no idea about there
president,secretary &  office bearers and other big OOO.
well yeah it was supposed to have there monthly LUG meet at the very venue
of mukt.in on 26th.apart from  tejaswini (OUR irc buddy) and a guy wearing
google t-shirt rest members were invisible so that itself explains
everything to intelligent people about the so called ilug-h present
there.Soi don`t think anything could have changed in entire event
apart from this
that we could have been funded from NRCFOSS as to there Rule book sponsoring
a  FOSS event needs a LUG not individuals who are enthusiastic enough to
conduct event like mukt.in and spread the words of FOSS in each section of
society.
am also thankful to dr.s.srinivasan  a noble man from NRCFOSS who granted
leave to pavitran for helpin us out in organizing this event.thank you sir.

Good work atul , 

Definitely it was very nice of a 3 member team to pull in so much effort.
I have known all the efforts that you had put into this for over a month and a 
half . And how you even choose to stay over in a strange city over 2 weeks 
before the actual event , even without any funding at all. Wish you all the 
best and hopefully the next year , it will be a greater success. But do 
kindly remember to also post your activities in the ilugc mailing list , that 
we might be able to provide more speakers / help whatsoever.

Did you check to see that other applications are able to use the
ntlmaps configuration properly? That is, try setting the proxy to use
as localhost:5865 in Firefox and see if that works.

If it doesn't, alter your configuration file for ntlmaps.

Notification must be made atleast one month before any event. It helps
to spread the word.

Not bad for a start :)

For reference:

ILUG-HYD:
http://ilughyd.org.in/

Their mailing list (TwinCLinG):
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ilughyd/

IIIT has a user group:
http://students.iiit.net/tech/lug/

IEEE-Chapter, Hyderabad:
Dr. Madhav Negi

In future, if you are organizing an event in any city/event, please
make an announcement in any FOSS mailing list in India, and volunteers
can help you with your work. (Worst case, shoot me an e-mail).

Never ever hesitate to ask questions.

even if you have a paid-for genuine copy of IE, it is illegal to use  
it on any platform not prescribed by microsoft - check out the IE  
license page. The platforms prescribed are win95, 98, NT etc etc,  
linux is not there. As for bottom post, you should trim unnecessary  
stuff from the quoted post, you havent trimmed anything.

Our "Rulebook" encourages people to involve local LUG -- may be it is
because of our own experience with ILUG-C. -- unless, of course, they
are from a recognised (or at least recognizable!) organization.

Thanks for the "noble" sentiments, but it would have helped if you had
sent a specific proposal -- about the event, expense estimate and
funds needed.

As you might recall, there was a phone call during end July from Atul
Jha (based  in Delhi -- calling from Jaipur!) to Srinivasan (in
Allahabad conducting a Teachers Training Workshop) about an event to
be held in Hyderabad and requesting that Pavithran from Chennai (at
that time in Coimbatore for PSG Tech FOSS workshop) be deputed to
assist organization of the same.  talk of networking across the
country !!!

As our other friends have been pointing out, let us be better prepared
for future events.
thanks and best wishes, Srinivasan.

Might I add that the response from the students was the best I have
seen, I already have emails pouring in my inbox about some advanced
stuff I havent heard of before. The volunteers who helped us out were
the best bunch of guys I have worked with. From networking, handling
power, projectors..etc were also done by a dedicated team of students
who worked for us not out of force, but out of interest. I had fun in
mukt.in and wish the event greater successes in the future.

Hi,

One of our linux box did not show the correct output of "netstat -nap", when 
tried to list the process associated with a particular port. But the process 
was actually listening on that tcp port. We tried with the different netstat 
binary copied from other machine and it showed correct output. I checked 
with chkrootkit and it showed, two binaries ifconfig and pstree are 
infected.

Is this enough to confirm that my machine is comprimised by some rootkit or 
should I do some more tests to confirm this.

Thanks

Dear Experts,
                   Voltage regulation is an tedious job. In TNEB ring main
system is used. The distance between Power generation plant and the Load
point will vary from 40 Kms 300 Kms. From generation point to utilization
area  TNEB  maintains various  voltage levels as 11000 volts (11KV), 110KV,
230 KV and 440V 3 phase etc to reduce the Line loss . In minor variation in
High voltage side causes remarkable value in domestic side. In addition to
the above, there are drastically raised demand causes overload of Generators
cause low voltages and frequent power failures. In Hill areas like Ooty,
Kodaikanal, Vallparai etc fault rectification work is tedious.

                     I request you to all to take adequate protection
against surges and power fluctuations. It is quit useful if you make an good
earthing for PC Lines. I request u to buy an metal oxide surge divertors
cost around Rs.150/= per phase. Use good quality UPS. One more thing i
suggest u to take an Insurance against ur domestic or Office equipments. I
saw this in one Private Bank, they took policy against their Office PCs.

hi guys :
forgive me if I sound as a wet blanket.
as many of you have experienced, the student response is often good --
a major credit should go to the speakers and the volunteers/organizers
who put their heart and soul in making the arrangements.

our interest is -- how to sustain the momentum? If you find some guys
are good go ahead and help them out. NRCFOSS and others could also
pitch in by providing mentors & college support (Sudarsan is a test
case -- Openmoko kit has reached Mumbai and we are working on the
formalities to clear the customs). While Arunai was a very good show,
the real work is at Jaya Engg, thanks to the efforts of people like
Prof Kumaran.

Ask the students to identify such staff / mgmt persons whom we can try
to rope in -- thru university or industry channels.

Srinivasan.

Good observation.  I was not able to truly simulate the problem, as my
FF said, it can't recognize embedded WAV files. Anyways, here is my
observation based on your inputs and my little experiments with Konq.

FF tries to play the wave file as if it is a synchronous function
call. This means that FF will execute the next statement after finish
playing the sound file.

Konq. on the other hand invokes an external application (amarok in my
case) to play the sound file and doesnt care if amarok played it or
crashed or whatever. Therefore, after invoking amarok, konq. continues
to execute the next statement.

In this case, as said earlier, Konq. asks amarok to play the file,
goes to the next statement and asks amarok to stop playing the music.
This explains why you dont hear anything with Konq. with the above
script, whereas in FF you hear the music.

JavaScript by itself has not yet been standardized across all
browsers. When it comes to newer extensions, the problem is even more
prominent. AFAIK, you might have to code separately for each browser
by adding a delay for Konq. before calling Stop :(

Natarajan.

One hurdle we faced was that the students of the venue were final year
students who would be leaving in a few months time. We have identified
certain students in the institute who were with us throughout and have
suggested to start a LUG of their own and possibly conduct a similar
event like that of Jaya Eng, where the local LUG would come and offer
support, but the real stars would be the students.

One of the organizers, Krish is an alumnus of the institute, I must say
he _has_ some influence over the management there and from what I saw,
they were more than happy to carry the movement forward, especially when
they noticed that the turnout was good from outside. Hopefully, Time
will tell..

Thanks a lot.  I am looking at the documentation on those sites.

I didn't want to do with squid as, during peak hours - when traffic shaping
becomes necessary - lot of people use instant messengers.  I need to
consider all traffic.

Meanwhile, I was wondering if anyone in this list did face the same problem
as mine - that is shaping outgoing traffic on two interfaces.  It will be
helpful to hear from them.

OpenOffice has a math editor. http://www.openoffice.org/product/math.html

If you are going Latex way, have Lyx with you. The present version is a good
improvement over the previous version, but it is still a long way to go.

Just a quick update. With the altered server.cfg from the iitm wiki site,
and changing the ntlmaps server name to 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost , its
working finally!!!
A real big thanks to Kumar.

That usually means that /etc/hosts may not include a reference to
localhost at all, though I am not too sure.

1/ You must use squid to mark traffic as connections from squid will all 
have src ip of that proxy m/c which is what tc sees.
2/ try ipp2p or l7-filter on the outgoing interface to ISP to mark p2p 
and other protocol state/type based packets and then use tc.
3/ I did not notice your q on IMQ. qdiscs for shaping are used for 
outgoing traffic. As a rule, outgoing traffic is shaped and incoming 
policed. It is enough if you use tc on the ISP facing interface for 
outgoing traffic. IMQ is used to shape aggregate of incoming and 
outgoing traffic. Does not work well in most cases except for Indian 
ISPs who sell bandwidth by aggregate on in+out traffic rather than 
symmetric duplex bandwidth like in the US.
4/ In most cases, shaping outgoing is enough unless you've enormous 
downloads happening. Downloads happen using http and thus squid is a 
good means to control. IMHO, you must use a combo of Squid to mark and 
tc to shape traffic on the ISP facing interface. On each LAN facing 
interface apply tc based on dst ip to control downloads outside or 
inclusive of http.

Pretty common n/w config. Your case has only one ISP facing i/f. It gets 
very tricky when you get 2xISP facing interfaces leading to DGD, 
priorities, load balancing, aggregate shaping etc.

Dear Atul, Sudarhan, Pavitran and team (I dont know  names of others),

 You guys deserve a pat on the back for pulling this up. Good work guys.
 One thing  would like to suggest that let not people wait for one
year before mukt.in returns. Event like this should be repeated
atleast every six months.

 Also, I cant understand the mandatory condition of associating a LUG
for FOSS event ? LUG is a specialized group for advocating and
spreading awareness of linux. But at the same time linux is not the
only FOSS based software. What if we want to do an event for FOSS on
windows or a gathering of BSD users/developers ? Why should one
approach a LUG in such situation ? Such associations give birth to
confusion among end users, that FOSS means linux.

there is no mandatory condition of associating a LUG for a FOSS  
event. I was just pointing out that to get funding from NRC-FOSS for  
a FOSS event, the funding has to be applied for by a recognised body  
- be it a LUG, FSUG, BSD users group, Ruby users group, University,  
College etc. In the event of it being virgin territory, then we may  
recognise a group of individuals. Hyderabad is not virgin territory,  
there is an active LUG there and hence we will only fund initiatives  
that involve the LUG - there is an active FSUG also, and initiatives  
through them would also be funded. And, to put it very bluntly, we do  
not appreciate propaganda that the Hyderabad LUG is dead/inactive.

Hello friends,

Yet again with some share in this, When we approached Birla
Planetarium , we remember we are been questioned "What is your
*personal* benefit out of it, i was personally been warned by the Exec
director for not promoting any company(*bingo , no combination, only
confusion ;). Though our intentions where nobel we were been eyed of
suspicion because of ignorance.Mind you , the institution is also a
part and parcel of TAMIL NADU SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CENTRE
administration

Reg MUKT on the final day , a laptop which was provided by the college
which lost the touch pad control, where srikrishna was been viewed as
if he spoiled the touch pad (which is of hardware mal function) by
installing linux.

If some serious supporters lead the show(if NRCFOSS ) we dont mind to
pull the rope by standing behind, and also not stop do things on our
own, after all its our passion.


Cheers

Yes , I have .
Most likely it is a combination of many issues.

It starts with poor earthing and some component form the motherboard
touching your cabinet.
Components touching the cabinet is not a light issue as it short circuits
many things.
Due to redundancy and good design of manufacturers , the issue is bypassed
and doesn't come to your notice initially.
The cause of such short circuits is  using a poorly mocked up cheap cabinet
of a good brand or not using the right screws to pin it(cabinets come with
special screws to attach motherboards)  ,  or not using an insulation layer
even if it is provided with the cabinet.

At this stage ,  if you earthing is good , you won't realize it cause you
don't get any electric shocks , and it takes time to wear things out .

Slowly the SMPS  starts to build problems under such condition and the
different components in the motherboard grow weak , that is when you realize
that something has gone wrong. A usb cannot get excessive power only from a
fault SMPS , it is always through the motherboard.

You must consider getting your motherboard fixed properly to the cabinet and
if necessary to change the cabinet , if after inspection you realize that
there are electric leaks to the body.

Remember the backside of the motherboard is where the circuit is made up of
, and it is very sensitive to even small magnitude of current such as the
static electricity from your body . It really is a big concern when such a
sensitive circuit touches the cabinet .

I had 15 pc's with the similar problem and even stranger ones  because i had
compromised on the cabinet. Then I  fixed it by getting an plastic
insulation placed between the motherboard and the cabinet.

In all the situations , earthing helps.

good luck

In my opinion NRCFOSS should organise events and LUGS(and other FOSS
groups) should participate.

rpm -V; check the entire system, consider also running a process to find and 
document content that would not have come from rpm's or $package manager - and 
handle those separately.

yes, I would say check the binaries that have been reported, but also sanity 
check /sys and /proc

You can also use tripwire or aide.  Save the signature files on another 
system.  Both generate reports highlighting changes in file/directory 
parameters.

I don't understand why is the need for language aggression in the list?
posting a query or any information in the list for everyone in the list to
read. you may love your mother tongue(even i do)  but there is a place to
show i feel mailing list is not a suitable place for all this. It would be
better if you post something in English so that everyone can read, else
people will consider this as spam.

IMO, "aggression" is a pretty strong word to use. And, its not
aggression. He has properly tagged the subject line as 'Tamil', and it
is Free Software related.

It is a post related to Free Software, so what is the problem?

in my opininion, there are three types of tamil posts:

1. Where the subject is purely of interest to those who know tamil -  
for example, keyboard shortcuts in tam99, or translation of certain  
words and phrases into tamil. Or a link to some article in tamil.

2. Where the poster does not know enough english to make his point  
clear.

3. Where the poster knows enough english to post, the matter is of  
general interest to all, but the poster posts in tamil in order to  
encourage usage of tamil in the mailing list.

For the first type of post, it may be marked as something like [ROT]  
- Relevant Only to Tamil and others can filter it out.

For the second, the poster should put some indication of what he is  
asking in english, and the person replying should also give an  
english summary.

The third type does not have place in this list as it is an english  
language list - if sufficient interest is there, a tamil only list  
can be forked at some stage.

I personally feel that the first type of post has a place in the list  
as it is better to discuss the nuances of foss in tamil in tamil  
language. As for the second, it could be crutch to help people who  
find english difficult, but we have to accept reality that english is  
the language of computer science and that anyone who doesnt improve  
his knowledge of the same is going to suffer.

I have been following the practice of giving an english summary even  
in the first type of posts and I dont see why others cannot also do it.

Might be unless it is commonly understandable language how can all
read that? If that is not, everyone will start posting in some
language which they are comfortable with. If people are comfortable
with English what is the need to taking up some other language? Even
some native tamil speakers can't understand some technical terms
written in tamil. I am not against some language here.

Shiva,

did you try making the change in yum.conf?

sometimes the trailing slash matters... try something like this...

http_proxy = http://user:pass@proxy:port/

I guess I suggested the same before. If the person initially posting the 
mail can't translate, may be someone
else in the list who knows both Tamil and English can translate. I 
always wanted to read these mails, but my
Thunderbird does not render Tamil  characters.

Hi Vivek,

Thanks for the appreciation.

For our first event, we are receiving more interest from students than expected.
People are still calling me up, giving news of their successful installation of Linux distro on their boxes, some to ask doubts, some to ask for the date of next event!

While I am busy taking these calls; Koolhead17 is busy deploying Linux boxes.
The mukt.in team is still working actively on the aftereffects of the event. :)

Yes, we would love to have mukt.in again in next 4 months or so.
And we will try to have it more effective.

Thanks to everyone who directly or indirectly supported us.

 You guys deserve a pat on the back for pulling this up. Good work guys.
 One thing  would like to suggest that let not people wait for one
year before mukt.in returns. Event like this should be repeated
atleast every six months.

 Also, I cant understand the mandatory condition of associating a LUG
for FOSS event ? LUG is a specialized group for advocating and
spreading awareness of linux. But at the same time linux is not the
only FOSS based software. What if we want to do an event for FOSS on
windows or a gathering of BSD users/developers ? Why should one
approach a LUG in such situation ? Such associations give birth to
confusion among end users, that FOSS means linux.

Have anybody has experiences of running an LVM partition as 83 type? How
does it affect the partition initialization during system boot-up?

Can you share your experiences please.

Funnily, the headers get rendered in Tamizh like sender, subject etc in 
the summary/list and reading pane. Mail body rendition in reading pane 
is full of ?s and @s. I can read Tamizh albeit slowly. Hence did not pay 
much attention.

Who said you can't announce? It is just that translation of what is
written in the mail needs to be put in below. As the GNU feak or
whoever mentioned, I can say something related to Free Software in
french or german in this list?

I have told enough, and only very few if not one or two don't
translate or add a English snippet at the bottom for others to
understand and give the freedom to the reader to decide whether it is
not relevant to him/her or not. I personally would suggest to ignore
such mails from people who dont care about other's freedom but only
their's.

I understand that this list is open to all and not just folks who can 
read/write Tamil and have Tamil fonts installed on their resp. systems.

In my system (KMail 1.9.5), the mail headers appear with "boxes" (as 
with above quoted headers) for those who use the Tamil char. set in 
their header information.  I agree, it is their prerogative to do so.   
However, given that such lists get archived in global search engines 
and repos., IMO it would be better to use a common denominator language 
for such items.  The same applies to Devnagari, Bengali, Gujrati ...

On the subject of discussing something specific like translations or 
helping some poster who cannot express him/her self in English it would 
be appropriate to put the original thought in the "native" language 
with it's respective font but have someone translate it for the benefit 
of those who do not understand the language.

These are my thoughts - my two cents.

May the source be with you.

Is someone monitoring the wiki updates? If yes, can you "publish" the

off late, they call it the Europian Union.. 

visit,

europa.eu

"India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States" says the Constituion.. 

a nation which intend to have people speaking 18 major language should have 
and should make equal provisions for each one of them.. 

while saying that we do know the necessity of a common language and its 
limits... 

an andra pradesh GLUG should have place for discussion in telugu.. delhi user 
group should have place for discussion in Hindi and so on..

So, you want only the people who know tamil to take part in GNU/linux
discussion?

Make sure that you have set the connection type to SSL, and the port

The only reason this list exists is to promote and discuss Linux and by 
extension, FOSS. As long as the majority of the users of this list 
understand the message, it is perfectly fine (See, which language does 
not matter.. What matters is whether the message is reaching the 
intended audience, most of the time for most of the messages)

Yes, it is tyranny of the majority and forcing a language on all "I 
cannot understand that particular language" folks. Yes, it would be nice 
to provide a translation.

But won't it also be nice to ask for translation? I do not even think 
there are as many messages in Tamil as there are messages about messages 
in Tamil..

Ask and ye shall receive...

Cheers,
Vaidhy

question should then be, which language do you think can you express your
opinions best.. the mother tongue or some language called the common
language?

and what is said to be common language? for a nation and for a state in it?
who are the participants? and how are we going to decide them?

what if some one creates multiple user ids just as they did so by starting
this flame using an anonymous user id  and vote?

it was decided way back that its ok to have tamizh mails with tamizh tag..
why not agree to it?

sorry about the grammar mistake dude.

and what is said to be common language? for a nation and for a state in it?
> who are the participants? and how are we going to decide them?


common languages are mentioned in the options. if u take tamil nadu, the
common languages refers to tamil. if u take US, the common language refers
to English. i have asked people to vote for the common language to be used
in the mailing list discussions. i am not here for language politics :)

what if some one creates multiple user ids just as they did so by starting
> this flame using an anonymous user id  and vote?


thats pessimistic way of thinking. i am always optimistic. :)

it was decided way back that its ok to have tamizh mails with tamizh tag..
> why not agree to it?


 i too agree that its ok to have tamizh mails with tamizh tag. i never
disagreed that. i too like to discuss lot about tamil computing and tamil
open source softwares related. i created the poll not to go against this.
but just wanted to know the people's opinion through voting


PS: i too have my personal website site in my mother tongue(tamil).

        Depends.  There are certain topics in which I am far less able
 to express my opinions in my mother tongue, and in some areas where
 specialized ontologies are required, my mother tongue fails me
 completely. 

> and what is said to be common language? for a nation and for a state

        What is the context of those queries? Are we talking about
 primary education? Or are we talking about getting help on Linux
 related issues from people who are domain experts to people who might
 need help? The answer would vary depending on the context.

        I thought this was a english language mailing list for
 discussing Linux issues.  I would suggest that the goal be kept in
 mind -- and we should attempt not to conflate multiple issues into
 deciding the best language to meet the charter of this mailing list.

> it was decided way back that its ok to have tamizh mails with tamizh
> tag..  why not agree to it?

        That is not the question.  The question is why _not_ try to be
 inclusive, and provide an explanatory note in english along with the
 Tamil as a variant?

        That does not seem nice at all. And it short changes people who
 do understand the language, but need help -- which might only be
 available from folks who do not understand the question.

 +1

        Can I, then, ask for a blanket translation for future messages?
 Or is there some bureaucratic  need to have to send in a request for
 every mail? I can't know which mail to ask translations for, since I
 don't understand which mails might have content related to a Debian
 user asking for help.

Question would be - how can you best irritate a large number of people on 
the list by continuing this conversation ..

Give it a rest, guys .. post in english or post with an english translation 
at the end.  Accept that

1. Some people cant read tamil anyway ..

2. Some people dont have tamil fonts installed / dont need tamil fonts

Madras is a cosmopolitan city and we do have people signed up from other 
cities. So please respect their needs and stick to posting in english.

Start a separate tamil list if you want and post in tamil as you like, there

If the aims of this list is to target even those people who do not
understand / write English but who are familiar with Tamil, I think it is
fine to allow these people to write their questions in Tamil.

That will mean that a lot of people in this list won't understand the
question (including myself) and will have to ignore the email and carry
on. And that is ok, because there are obviously people who do read tamil
on this list and are capable of replying.

I know that some people who are fully conversant in English would also opt
to write in Tamil knowing fully well that by doing so, they are basically
excluding a lot of people on this list. Whether this is right is
debatable.

I think it would help if people who know English write their
comments/questions in English, but the list must remain open to those who
don't know English and who may write in Tamil.

Regards,
PK

LJ Tech Tip on Taking Screenshots:

Taking screenshots on your Linux desktop is one of the most powerful
techniques that can come in handy on a rainy day. The simplest way to
achieve this end is typing this:

  $ xwd -out /tmp/shot.xwd

And then select the window you want to "photograph" with your mouse
pointer. If you wish to capture the root window:

  $ xwd -root -out /tmp/rootwin.xwd

Typically you would invoke xwd from a different virtual desktop and
use the keyboard to switch to the desktop in which the target window
lies. This is to avoid overlapping windows occluding the target
window. Once you obtain the dump, convert will help you convert to the
format of choice.

  $ convert /tmp/shot.xwd ~/shots/xterm.png
    or
  $ convert /tmp/shot.xwd ~/shots/xterm.jpg

HTH :)

Though not to digress too much, I just want to point that these are
not just funky bunky names but nicks that are known and recognized in
the worldwide community. People mostly call Kenneth as lawgon, they
immediately recognize me and Shkathi when we say technofreak and
shakthimaan/mbuf respectively. IMHO, nicks are more than funky bunky
names, it is our identity in the community without our original
identity of nation, caste, etc being revealed. Second thing, it is
easier for people to remember our nicks than our names :)

Back to the OT, this issue was once raised by same me and it was
resolved (hope so) that posts can be in tamil provided they have a
[Tamil] tag, and either the OP or someone who is able to understand
what it is cares to posting the same post in tamil so as not tamil
members can also know what it is. Though this post was about a
document translated in tamil, which of course non-tamil members would
not have been able to read, if the message was posted also in English
they would have at least known that the translation of such a document
has been done in Tamil, and might point it to people in future.

I humbly request,
[1] Who ever posts in Tamil, please also try to give the same message
in English as much as possible.
[2] If you feel English is too bad to get embarrassed, post your query
in Tamil but still post the same in whatever English you know because
we can also help you to improve your English as well (may be some one
of us might privately post you with the right way to ask the same ;) )
[3] Non-Tamil readers, please do not discourage posting in Tamil
because as a Local LUG it is equally important for us to improve
documentation and resources in native language as well.

Hope this thread ends here and above requests are full filled :)

as far as i am concerned, i will take the responsiblity of giving a  
synopsis of all mails that are posted in tamil and are of general  
interest - if, within a reasonable time, a summary does not appear,  
you may assume that either I am defunct or that the mail is only of

Or the simple thing would be to filter out the people who post in
languages you don't understand, unless of course you feel that you
might want to listen to what they say, if and when they say it in
English.

Like I wouldn't filter the world famous lawgon, technofreak and
shaktimaan, but I have used filters to remove some posters.  Keeps
everyone happy.  And no heartburn here.

Hi ilugies,
As a part of Linux Migration project in school I would like to know whether
we can create custom profiles for users/groups in ubuntu.
If so can anyone give some pointers.
since the school is working entirely in windows  i should  look at every
point. If anyone in the list has hands on experience  in such a  project
please  let me know.


Thanks & Regards--

Message-ID: <e43212340708300638k62ec8de8hb232943afb41115b@mail.gmail.com>

Dear experts,
                 In my Redhat Enterprises edition 4 server, somebody
logged  through  winSCP software from Windows PC and doing something. I
accidentally run the command
                  ps aux
today on  11:55Hrs and i found one process ID contain  as
                  root@nostty  scp -d -l
etc in the COMMAND column and TIME 11:52 Hrs. Immediately i run
                 last
command it displays only pts/1, pts2 and not display the remote PC IP. I
contact some persons and finally find that  my  colleague  logged  into my
server from  other  city on that time. I wondered how it is happened. I also
checked
             /.ssh/known_host
list. But there is no record about remote PC IP.

Where is an log created when using winSCP?
Is any special script is required to log this action?

          please post me the solution.

Before creating LVM follow the below one.

while creating partition do format with ext3 file system

   # mkfs.ext3 -j /dev/hda<number> or  # mke2fs -j /dev/hda<number>

Yes, but there may be people who may just register into this site just to
get one or two of their questions answered, and these people may not know
passable English.

>From my experience with working with organizations in the smaller towns,
most of the people doing the system administration (those who require the
services of a mailing list like ilugc) know very little English.

It doesn't make sense to ask them to post in English as well.

I don't claim to speak for everyone, but as for myself, I am not too
bothered by the Tamil language posts on this list. Only a minority of
posts are in Tamil, and I don't think I am losing much by not
understanding them.

As for whether these Tamil posts are using up my valuable bandwidth, well
- there are enough posts in English on this list which may not be exactly
on the topics I am interested in hearing about. So if I count all the
posts in English that I ignore because it is not of interest to me and
compare that against the number of posts in Tamil, I am sure the posts in
tamil are far fewer.

In fact i have come across a server which was configured by someone
before me.... so i am trying to find out how does it affect running a
system with LVM on 83 type partition... i have very little chance of
trying my hands on the box as it is a production system... so that was
the reason i came out on this forum ...

I am trying to understand the following things regarding LVM...

	1. How much role does an partition type play in the kernel
initialization phase...? 

	2.does the kernel only initialize physical volumes of type 8e during
system boot up? 

	3. If yes, they when are physical volumes belonging to LVM of non 8e
type get initialized? they do work like this... I have seen them and
hence this mail..

	4. If no, then what is the normal LVM PV?VG initialization procedure...
my understanding was that VG are initialized by the kernel once the
dm-mapper is loaded into the memory.. which is generally done towards
the end of kernel initialization or during the initial phase of system
boot up..

my assumption was that, the partition type actually helps the kernel
read the initial FS/partition structures. 

Can anybody help me in clearing the clouds in my brain..?

Thanks & regards,

None. As long as you have appropriate module loaded during the boot up 
process, everything will play along nicely. This is true even for EFI 
architecture and any other architecture. All it needed is to properly 
recognize(meaning respective kernel modules) the underlaying H/W 
architecture

If you do not have the lvm modules in your initrd image, then you will 
need to load them manually. This could in case of where your root fs is 
not on lvm.

No, it is the kernel modules helps the kernel load and use the partitions.

Have you also enabled POP support in Gmail?

Also, I am not sure, but I don't think that POP3 connections can go
via a HTTP proxy... you'll want to configure IP forwarding on the
server...

Yes, you are correct. In the default settings, the proxy server usually
allows only ports 21 (FTP), 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). This means that
any other service has to be accessed through port forwarding from
another computer, or by relaying the request through HTTP, which I
don't think is possible without some effort.

For SSH port forwarding, a simple Googling of 'ssh port forwarding'
gives you enough results. I've just checked. man ssh also helps; see
option -L.

Hi
Developer works of ibm is the first place i would seaerch for any such
information. It is a treasure trove of documents and it asks for a
registration with your email-- go and get all the info you need and never
again say that IBM has never done any thing for you :-)

The same problem occurred on desktops too.
