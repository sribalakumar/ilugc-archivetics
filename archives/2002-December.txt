edit /etc/modules and add the names of the modules (just the module
name, not module_file.o)

The best solution is to make use of the update-modules script and
/etc/modutils/ directory. The update-modules(8) man page describes the
process very well.

Is this from the console login that you are talking about? If yes, it
could be because you have the TMOUT variable set to 900 (which is the
seconds equivalent of 15 mins). But I doubt thats redhat 7.3's default
feature.

If its the graphical environment, look at your graphical environment's
settings.

you hv not mentioned clearly whether this happens in your X Window session
or
a console session
if it is in a console session
check for the value of  TMOUT variable
$~ echo $TMOUT

if it is set
then unset this variable.

does this happen even if you are not idle (no kbd operation). ?

I'm having Windows 98 SE in my sytem with dual booting options
Partitions details

As per thier insturctions, Mandrake linux fow windows can be installed in a 
window partition in a separate folder.
Is it possible to install MDK without losing any data in my E or F

in windows, will it use FAT-32 or ext.3 File system?

Thanking you in advance

Hi
If the E or F drive is free, you can dedicate that partition to MDK and you
can install without distrubing windows. No need for FAT 32 format
installation.During MDK installation point to that drive having free space
(E or F) and choose "Auto allocate" . You are done. It will not disturb
windows unless otherwise you choose that partition. It will use ext3 format

Dear Srikanth

Thanks for your reply.  If I install MDK in E or F partition, there will be
3 OSes in the system (Windoze, RH7.2 and MDK9). Lilo is the bootloader now.
After installing MDK9, should I make any changes in the lilo-config file for
the proper display of the names of all the 3 OSes while booting?

In another system WinXP and RH7.3 are installed with GRUB bootloader.
Suppose if I install MDK9 now in an empty partition, what changes I should
make in the GRUB-config file. How much mininum space is needed for the
typical MDK9 installation?

What is Linux

Linux is another operating system like windows95/98/2000/XP.  The good
thing about Linux is it is easy to use and extremely reliable and
powerfull. Linux is free to use & it is legal to share with your
friends and is ideally suited for people like us in India. This comes
bundled with all the necessary software for doing most of the things.
No need to buy any extra software, =20
 =20
Come on. How come your Linux is powerful and still free? legal to
share?=20

linux-india.org lists a chapter in pondicherry. You may want to contact
the moderator whose name appears there.

http://www.linux-india.org/

But, the website doesnt seem to be updated in a long time (pre-2000, I
think), but the copyright is upto 2010 !

	Under this option an ext3 (assuming you use ext3 for Linux) image file
will be created under the FAT-32 partition, and this image will be used instead
of a disk partition. But, this results in performance loss, and also you are 
leaving your entire Linux installation (ie. the filesystem image) at the mercy 
of windows. If your FAT-32 filesystem gets corrupted, then the image file (and 
thereby your linux installation) is also screwed.

	These have already been answered. So, there's nothing more to say.

all the best to your efforts. :)

If you are thinking of starting a user group for all sorts of  free
software (that could be *BSD, GNU/*, or even Apache / X / whatever)
consider starting an FSUG. Contact gnu@gnu.org.in and find out how you
can start an FSUG in your area. In brief, an FSUG will not only give
technical support for Free Software users but will also discourage the
use of non-free software. If you think it is important that people
should realise the ills of non-free software consider starting an FSUG.
A GLUG (GNU/Linux User Group) would be fine too but that will narrow
down the users in your group (as was said earlier, *BSD, GNU/^(linux)
users may not be interested). I would personally discourage forming a
"LUG".

I bet you will find most of your friends "complaining" that it is not
easy to install. The issue is not about ease of use. Its not about power
either. There are more powerful / easy to use proprietary OSes, Software
available. GNU/Linux stands out in the fact that it gives you the
freedom to do anything with it.

Its powerful because its free :) (free as in swatantra, suthanthiram (or
as Mr.P.Asokan suggests - 'Thal(2)aiyaru Menkalam')).

there are HTML editors for Linux but i'm afraid there aren't any great 
WYSIWYG tools that can be an alternative to Dreamweaver. :-(

But u have some widget-based really good HTML editor's - really worth 
giving a try

check out

Bluefish(i've worked with it) (GPL) - very similar to "Screem"(i've only 
seen screenshots)

http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.php

Both "Bluefish" and "Screem" are NOT visual tools. They are HTML Text 
editors. But then u dont have to write much. These come along with 
plenty of widgets.

The best WYSIWYG/Visual tools for creating HTML content that i've seen 
yet are
Mozilla's Composer component and
OpenOffice's Writer(stretching tables/columns around are quite easy here).

i haven't come across a real equivalent yet! let me know if u do.

ramesh pallikara

Hi,

It's fairly simple. There should not be any problem with RH 8.0 Dual boot
Windoz,

Install Windows 2000 Server of Windows '98 leaving apart not less than 6 GB
if you intend to install everything available in RH 8.0.

Once the Installation is completed, Boot with the RH 8.0 CD and in the Disk
Partition Option choose Manual and Opt for Disk Drud

Create Partitions for Linux Swap (Minimum Double the Size of your System
RAM) then balance for \ or as desired by you for \usr \temp \var, etc....

Since the Linux Boot cannot be put before the 1024 Cylinders, it would
prompt you to create a Boot Disk (create it for safety reasons), choose
GRUB as the Boot Loader. The rest will be taken care by the Installation
Wizard.

Enjoy Linux...

Thanx
-Sriram

Just one small correction here.  Linux is NOT an Operating System by 
itself. Linux is the kernel
GNU/Linux is the Operating system.

very true ... but it's not just the cost factor.
India needs FREE SOFTWARE ( "free" as in "free country" ) and it doesn't 
have to learn this the hard way.

it's not "powerful and still free". i believe it's the freedom that

I cannot take credit for that. It is the usage of

'thaLaiyaRu menkalam' is the standard transliteration.

Install MDK and install boot loader lilo in the first sector of boot
partition of MDK installation. Boot through the boot disk created during MDK
installation, boot into MDK and see the entries in /etc/lilo.conf. Put those
entries in the "other" column in the /etc/lilo.conf file of your present RH
7.2 installation. Run "lilo -v ".
Reboot the machine. Now you should see the 3 entries : Dos, Linux, Mandrake.

	xfs is the best, and performs better than reiserfs.

	you may also try ext3, 

	(ext3 = ext2 + journalling.)

The "best" really dfepends on what you want it to do. I've been using ext3 
for a while now on my desktop machines with no issues, and afaik, ext3 is 
just a jounalling layer on top of ext2, so conversion may be easier...

ReiserFS seems to be best for a large number of small files.

I you have large files (ours are usually mangy GB in size, and we have 
hundreds of those), go with XFS. Its very well designed, superb data transfer 
speeds. I have pulled the power plug, literally (bad me :) on a production 
machine running XFS, and it comes back online without any problems. I have 
had no problems with its reliability. And feature wise, it would still be the 
best (for me, that is). For instance it supports ACL's and extended 
attributes. So ACL's would take care of micro level of security for you (if 
you want extreme security go for an encrypted fs). Extended attributes, are 
system and user definable attributes that are stored with the inode info. For 
example, our playout system verfies if each file is a legal video file (as in 
data format, you don't want somebody cat random_garbage > file.dv and send it 
on air) and marks it as suitable for playout. This is stored as an extended 
attribute by a daemon. The playout machines check the attribs to see if the 
files are production ready. In fact, ACL's are stored in the system part of 
the EA. A simpler usage of these might be id tags for your mp3 collection 
stored in the EA. So searching is very fast on all tag info (I used to do 
this on the BeOS), and if you have several thousand files, its invaulable... 
Before I get micro flamed for using the non-free mp3 format, lets me state 
you can use it for ogg too :) or pretty much anything...  

The latest release candidate is on the sgi site : 

http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs

Following the above thread, I am giving below my /etc/lilo.conf

prompt
timeout=50
default=DOS
boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
message=/boot/message
lba32

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-3
 label=linux
 initrd=/boot/initrd-2.4.18-3.img
 read-only
 root=/dev/hda9
 append="hdc=ide-scsi"

other=/dev/hda1
 optional
 label=DOS

other=/dev/hda11
       optional
       label=Mandrake

This is the /etc/lilo.conf  in Redhat 7.3 installation .First Win 98, then I
installed RH 7.3 and then  I installed MDK 9.0 afterwards in a 5 GB
partition carved out of windows partition.

The first thing you might want to try is KDrive Tiny-X instead of a full 
blown X server. 

For you file manager looks no farther then Rox Filer.

Another nifty alternative is XFtree from the XFCE project. I use both 
regularly, and have replaced konqui for me...

If you are running any Linux^W GNU/Linux ;) distro worth its salt
(Debian, RH, Mdk, Slackware etc.)  install the Python binaries (rpms,
debs whatever) and the python docs.  Under Debian its called
python-doc.  This contains a tutorial, the library reference and a
whole bunch of other docs that are of great use.  I recommend starting
with the tutorial.  These docs are also available online at
http://www.python.org/ .

If you want to buy/download a book look here:

 http://www.python.org/doc/

There are *lots* of resources both online and in dead-tree form.

You might also want to read this:

http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2001/02/07/pythonnews.html

and this:

http://www.andamooka.org/

It has a "Non Programmer's Tutorial For Python".

On Windows the Python installer ships with all the standard Python
docs that you can choose to install.

cheers,

If u r working on Linux u'll have python by default. If ur working on 
Windows then humm u need to download the windows version.
The documentation and installers are available on http://www.python.org.

Hello,

Activestate has an excellent Python distribution. The help should usually be 
sufficent (will include tutorials). http://www.python.org will give you 
enough to get you started. And the python cookbook (like all other cookbooks) 
is an invaluable resource...

publish these books.

  We have a CVS repository which we use for writing the books. One
Mr.Jonathan Bartlett has given his FDLed book (ProgrammingGroupUp).

http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/demo-schools/demo-schools/books/programming-ground-up/

  we also have a list of other books under development (some yet to
start). Please give your ideas/suggestions/work/time for making this
happen. :)

  We are giving a talk at Madras Christian College, Tambaram on the 7th

One word of caution though, check your distro for the python version. RH, 
afaik, is far behind, and this is usually cause for Much Pain(tm)

If it is unregistered, and not resolvable outside on the net, how the

Dear Sir,

   Currently I am working in Mahendra Engineering College as System 
Manager.  We have got around 2000 students in our college.  We are having 
Computer Science and Engineering, Information Technology, Information 
Technology and Management, Software Engineering, Computer Technology, 
Multimedia Technology, Data Communication and Networking Branches in our 
college.

   I am interested in starting a Linux users group at Salem for the benefit 
of the students at our college and in and around Salem, Namakkal and Erode 
districts. 

   May I request the details for starting a club at our place, so that our 
students also benefit in understanding the technical knowledge from the 
experts.  Expecting your reply in this regard.

Regards,
M. Kannan.

Hello,

It has from 2.5

> Can we do anything about it?

The trees are patched as per two critieria :
a) Stability
b) The tree maintainers wishes

So, if you can contrib to (a) (including testing) something can be done about 
it..

I guess this is because traditional GUIs have been rectangular. Win32
API does have some polygon functions, but its hard. (IIRC, ICQ99 had a
round startup window)

Anyways, these 'irregular' windows were just a hack. You have to remove
each pixel individually, and also remove mouse sensitivity within those
areas. Even then, there were some visual glitches, like when you move
the window, the frame is still rectangular.

This was all sometime win98-ish, when I used to program as a child.
Things might have changed now. (Win2K has some nice Alpha blending
functions)
 
For now, you could live with transparency. Thats the closest you can
get.

now u can use the new password on all the systems. alternatively, use 
the 'yppasswd' to change the password on the NIS server.

To use yppasswd, start the yppasswdd server.

# service yppasswdd start
$ yppassd

but 2.5 is a development tree and will not be put on
distros - 2.4 progress has been very slow - is a 2.6
tree expected to start soon which can be put on
distros?

Hi Suraj,
    What are the books you are expecting? if it is on programming
    which programming language you prefer?
   
    For me natural thing to introduce is functional programming.
    functional programming is "The" programming. We don't need
    to mud their mind with pointers and other implementation
    issues. there are many good books on functional programming.
    My preference is "sicp" structure and interpretation of
    computer programming. Instead of duplicating the work we
    can convince author/publisher to publish an indian editon.

    There are some good books  on  functional programming in
    general and Hakell in particular. Walder and Bird comes to
    my mind.

    One advantage of teaching hakell kind of languages is it is
    close to their class mathematics. 

    one question to the list. What is your first algorithm?

regards,
Sam

Fine - I don't think ESR claims that he has everything under the sun in

^W is, however, commonly used on usenet for the last several years as

Subject: [Ilugc] Motorola SM56 Internal modem- In which distro will it work?
Message-ID: <000001c29e77$dacc15a0$74a841db@k>

Hi Listers

I am trying to install GNU/Linux on some of my friends' PC's here at
Trivandrum. The trouble is that all of them have only internal modems. They
would very much like to try Any distro.
Having heard that it works with PCQ Linux 7.1, I installed it at a friend's
PC (dual boot). But to make internal modem work, it was no way. I installed
sm56 rpm, set it up and ran it . Setup was okay , but the modem will not
work. Either " it is unable to find the modem" or " modem is busy"(I made
the sym link, changed the device pointer  /dev/modem, /dev/ttyS01, 02 etc .,
"n" number of times). But no way.  I posted this query earlier. I am at my
wits end.

Now apart from RH7.3, I have MDK9.0, Slackware 8.1 and Debian Woody (3 CD
set) with me. Will the internal modem (Motorola SM 56)  work in any of these
distros without any hassle ?At least 5 of my friends have internal modem
only.
I would like to install GNU/Linux in as many PC's here in Trivandrum, but
only if this problem is resolved .
Any pointers or hints to help solve this problem ?

hello,

Thiagarajan wanted us to know:

Close. Necessity is the mother of all inventions. 

UI gurus have only been thinking about rectangular UI objects. There
hasn't been a need for irregular objects.

Tell me why you would want an irregular image.

Its much easier to store just four coods (x1,y1,x2,y2) instead of
numerous points along the border.

<!-- insert arguments about vector and raster stuff -->

A simple example. The mouse pointer is not a rectangle. But, if you open
the XBM or ICO (or CUR) file in a suitable editor, you will find that it
is rectangular. With some simple tricks (XOR), you can get any shape
you want. 

> is it not possible to make fundamental changes in the OS itsef ?.

What has the OS got to do with this ?

> is it not possible to make a new format of image where the base is not a
> rectangel ?

Sure, it is possible. But think of the amount of information you've got 
to store about each pixel. The best (and only) approach is to stick with
transparency. Transparency with layering (flat) can be neat.

yes, there is something to add here. the problem is clearly not the
question of rectangular objects or UI-lameness though it surely
is a factor. the real issue is you are always interpolating a
2d real coordinate system [your image] to a 2d integer coordinate
system [your screen]. the loss of precision here can be offset
cleverly in many ways namely anti-aliasing, shading etc. of course
increasing the granularity of what we call a `pixel` is really the
best way to get around such interpolative errors and thats why
as resolution increases your images appear sharper, better and more
"dense". taking this argument , at a more fundamental level its a
problem between analog [nature] and discrete [computer] domains. its
really the reason why we have to "sample" signals to feed into
"digital signal processors" [computers].

its a lot of math and i think foley, van damme [sp?] introduction to
graphics is a good book to start out with.

thanks. regards,
			Vikram

	The boxed set comes with "powertools" and other "goodies" that are
not shipped as a part of the regular ISO. Some call it "extras" as well. You
can have extra editors, graphics software, 3d image rendering software,
VariCAD, and other stuff in those CDs. They might also include extra printed
manuals, in multiple languages, and 30-day, or 3 month technical support,
and stickers, and other spam^W flyers, brochures etc.

	Because "opensource" does not mean "free as in beer".
	
	It only means you can peek at the sourcecode if you want. And if
appropriately licensed, play around with it, the way you want.

| what topics are you looking at? what is the audience you are looking

`----

The audience  is school students (also  college students if  we grow a
bit further). Practically, the students that we met seem to know a lot
more than  what we (or atleast  me) expected. Though on  the topics of
fundamentals of computing, fundamentals of programming, they are a bit
weak. Most still  think the 'start' button is due  to some chip inside
their computer. :) Yet they seem to know most of the 'practical' stuff
like browsing the WWW, using yahoo, etc., :)

We have the following plans:

a. Review /  Rework / Modify  Jonathan Bartlett's book  - "Programming
Ground Up". This book is more  of an introduction to programming for a
mature user (using assembly as its main form of teaching techniques in
programming).  We haven't  started the review yet, but  i find it very
good. This  could be something we  can take to  colleges. [*]

b. Our primary aim is to tell the schools that Free Software education
is viable  and that we can  support them frame  their syllabus, books,
etc.,.  The  bruises that  our friends from  the FSUGs got  from their
effort in the  kerala government's IT@SCHOOLS project is  a lesson for
us and we will have to make  sure we have all the books in hand before
we go for  a proposal to, say, an individual  school or the government
of Tamil  Nadu. Hence we  write new books  / modify existing  books to
make sure we give them enough infrastructure.

c. Currently these are our plans:

1. Arun (Kochi)  will write a  book on 'Introduction to  the GNU/Linux
system'.  Target audience: 6th standard [**]

2. Manikandan  is  thinking of  writing  a  book  on 'Fundamentals  of
Networking'.    We   would   use   MKS's  existing   work   for   this
purpose. Target Audience: 10th - 12th. [+]

3. I  just  started  out  on   writing  a  book  on  'Fundamentals  of
Computers'. Target audience: 4th standard. [*]

4. Jonathan Bartlett's 'Programming Ground up'  - yet to decide how we
can  use  this. I  guess  only college  students  can  take this,  not
schoolers.

5. stuff  from  gnupress.org,  etc.,  need  to  be  trimmed  and  made
dilute. save work as much as possible.

  Take a look at these from:

	     http://gpasokan.com/demo-schools/cvs/books/

(
Legend: 

[*] - compiled form of the book isn't available yet (maybe we will put
them up on the downloads section on savannah, not in the repository). 

[**] - pre development stage! 

[+] - planning stage - yet to commence writing

)

It would  be very  helpful if  people here can  come forward  to write
simple books (maybe 90 page stuff - typically like what the govt of TN
writes).  Topics could  be anything that you think  kids need to learn
about computing and  Free Software. Like with the  FSUG-Kochi guys, we
are trying to make sure that we dont teach just one particular product
(like, not  just GNOME when it  comes to a desktop,  but genrally talk
about  what  an  'icon'  is  and  what minimising  a  window  is  with
references to GNOME,  KDE, WMAKER, etc.,). Your work  must be released
under the terms of the GNU FDL (http://gnu.org/licenses/fdl.txt).

First. Please send posts in plaintext and not HTML.

I'm assuming GRUB is installed in the MBR after installing Linux and
hence points to the Linux 8.0 partition. If you have the Linux emergency
disk, you can boot with that and reinstall grub on the MBR. The GRUB
menu is in /boot/grub. While installing Mandrake, the bootsector must
have been loaded in that partition itself like you did for Linux. The
grub boot specification must point to that partition in that menu entry
for Mandrake.

Sorry. I did not read the mail fully while replying. In case Redhat is
giving problem with boot from floppy, what are those errors? My guess is
that while installing Mandrake, you may not have installed the boot
sector on the same partition.

To fix this, you need to execute fdisk /mbr from the Windows boot floppy
- dos mode. This will make the system boot from Windows default.
Mandrake can be booted from floppy anyway. If the Redhat boot problem is
due to floppy corruption, you would not have problems. Boot Mandrake,
mount the Redhat partition and check the menu.lst or grub.conf file.
Copy the menu portion pointing to Redhat to the Mandrake grub.conf. Boot
with mdk floppy and see if all the boots go thro' properly. Then issue
grub-install /dev/hda.

I tried to boot  RH 8 using boot floppy. It displays several error
messages 
and not booting properly.

Will the problem solved if I just reintall reinstall RH 8 ? 
To remove MDK9 it is suggested - Delete all partition from harddisk and
replace them 
by single FAT using Diskdrake. Is it the only way. If I remove MDK will
the problem solved.

Subject: [Ilugc] installing a package takes a long time
Message-ID: <200212090843.29417.mvikyk@yahoo.co.uk>

Hi,

I have downloaded the latest version of wine available at www.winehq.com.  As 
directed by the readme file,

I gave the following commands:
./configure
make depend && make

The problem is I gave the make depend && make command at 0815 hrs and it is 
still running now at 0840 hrs.  A similar difficulty was faced when I tried 
to install gtk.  It is running for minutes together.

I am installing them as a use and not as user.  I don't think installing a 
package will take this much amount of time.  Where I am going wrong?

Advance thanks,
c u /

Probably a typo, shouldn't it be ./configure ?

Are you low on memory ? And, how fast is your CPU ? 

I am not sure about WINE, but GTK 2.x shouldnt take more than 10 minutes
on a decent computer (IIRC, about 25 minutes for GTK on a PII 266, 64MB 
ram)

I compiled GNOME yesterday in about 2 hours.

Installing as root, you mean ? It shouldn't matter for compiling. Only
the "make install" part will matter if not root and without the prefix
to configure.

If you are memory-starved, try freeing up some memory. Try quitting
XFree.

or, better yet, upgrade to a newer version of the os. nis is one of the
things that is partially broken in older versions of red hat. it works
much better in 7.2 and later. also, with these later versions, there is no
need to use yppasswd on the client - pam is set up so that if nis is
enabled, the usual passwd command will work like yppasswd (you will need 
to run yppasswdd on the server, of course). also, this business of running 
a make in /var/yp will not be needed.

hi all,

i dont know how long i have had this problem, but i detected it only 
recently. i have redhat 7.3 on a server that provides nis and imaps 
services (and many others too). i noticed that in my default runlevel of 
5, ypserv is started before xinetd. and, ypserv decided to take the imaps 
port; so, when xinetd started, imaps was getting disabled. there must be 
something wrong here... what is happening? is a similar situation 
prevailing in debian, mdk etc?

sriram

ps: of course, i killed ypserv, restarted xinetd and then ypserv and 
things are ok. but, this should not happen, right?

I really dont completely understand what you mean by all this. But if
you are thinking of creating a device special file, use the mknod
command. mknod --help will do. women dont need a man always. ;/

The program u have written has to be compiled as a kernel 
module .as you are writing a device driover you have to create 
the device file for that using  mknod .b4 you do that get the device's
major no and minor no and the type of the device 'c' | 'b' 

> can anyone plz tell me how to make this sample code

compile the code and insmod the  testdata.o file which resulted 
from the compilation. now try reading/writing/whatever from the device


Happy Hacking

You can use webmin. It is great. I've been using it for over 3 years now.
However, it still does not take away the fact that you need to know what you
are doing. If not, even with the GUI, you can land up with a wrong/bad
configuration. Further, if you learn how to tune sendmail.mc, you could use
options not available in webmin e.g. smtp authentication.

Sendmail and Postfix are quite easy to configure without GUI - if you
stick to using sendmail.mc in sendmail, and just read the FAQs for
postfix.

I would strongly suggest that you not use GUIs of any sort for this.

What specifically do you want to accomplish?

i am not sure i understand your comment. yes, of course, ypserv was 
binding to the imaps port and that was the problem. but this should not 
happen, right? when i stopped ypserv, restarted inetd and then started 
ypserv, the binding was to a different port and things are all fine. but 
if i reboot the machine, there is a (small?) chance that the same thing 
can happen again. this is really a bug, no? is there something specific 
you are looking for in the logs?

Just an indication of just why it did so.  I can't think of any reason
for ypserv to do this.

hi,

there is nothing about this in the logs. the log message looks exactly the
same irrespective of what port ypserv binds to. there should be something
that tells ypserv (or any other rpc fellow) what ports not to use, no? or
is this how portmap works and one just has to live with this? of course,
ypserv can be started on a set port so that this does not happen, but the
default configs dont seem to have this (suggesting it may not be needed).  
maybe i have been lucky the last few years, but i have not seen this
happen before. what am i missing?

Hi ,

   I was just checking xfs some time back. I could help you with what i
remember.

Choose XFS for large filesystems, which would contain large files.
Choose ReiserFS for smaller filesystems , which would contain small files.

If you are not sure of the above, better stay with EXT3, which is in
between XFS and ReiserFS.

I too remember of a site which gave me some comparison chart. But it seems
my poor memory couldn't help it. Probably you can google for it.

  From that rating i understood that XFS is for large files which wont get
added/removed frequently,ReiserFs is for small files which would be 
added/removed frequently. And EXT3 as usuall performed moderately well 
with most of the tests.

   Hope this helps.
Bye and take care.
uday.

Hello,

Webservers usually have large number of small files, and XFS won't give you 
any advantages there (though I doubt if there will be any degradation of 
performance). Again, if you have a few hyndred thousand fles the inode 
managementin XFS will be useful...

That you will have to buy in boxed sets.  The last two CDs contain
proprietary / non free software as well, which can't be burnt and

You cannot be a kernel user.  Anyway, I think that you meant GNU/Linux
and are mentioning the  popular GNU/Linux distribution, Redhat. Please
read (http://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html).

The 5  CD set of which the  last 2 CDs contain  `non-free' stuff.  You
should  be very  careful when  using  `non-free' stuff  and this  gets
magnified when you  start deploying apps.  You may land  up in a legal
tangle if you are  going to install those apps for a  3rd Party !  All
said and done, `non-free' stuff is  an evil thing because it keeps the
community divided and  helpless.  Why go along with  such things which
does not guarantee your `swathanthriyam' ?

Some say that the core of an OS is the kernel.  But you will find that
other components which make up an OS are equally critical.

Here, the  source code of  the kernel Linux  can be patched  using the
patch command  and updated to a  later version.  You  can compile this
kernel for your hardware and  device needs and get better performance.
Please read the relevant Kernel  Compiling HOWTO which can be got from
(ftp://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/).

Do get  back to this  List when you  have pointed doubts and  we shall
help you help yourself.

Please...the rectangular object _is_ the issue. And its _not_ 
UI-lameness...its the UI's simplicity. Keeping things simple has always 
been the key. Contrary to intuition...a rectangle needs only four 
variables i.e., (x_1,y_1),(x_1,y_2),(x_2,y_1),(x_2,y_2). Even a 
quadrilateral would need eight variables i.e (x_i,y_i); 0<i<5; i belongs 
to N.
'Fractally', the pixel is a rectangle. Its easy to build an exact huge 
rectangle out of small rectangles. No matter how small the pixels, you 
cant build an exact triangle.

[OT] When things come to windows, mouse sensitivity within a window 
needs only one parameter specifying the boundary (the horizontal bound 
or the vertical) when the mouse is moving in a straight line along _any_ 
direction...this is very simple. But think about a quadrilateral...you 
would need to specify the slope _and_ an initial starting point for the 
boundary line...which means...we need two parameters. More 
complex...lets stay simple.

I dont see how this is relevant to the topic of rectangular images.
[OT] _Every_ image is sampled (digitised). Even our eye does this.
There are two issues involved here 1) the bit rate..or depth resolution, 
and 2) the screen resolution. The more of both...the better.
There is _no_ interpolation anywhere! There is only truncation involved. 
  For eg., draw a one-pixel thick straight line, with a slope, in an 
losslessly compressed or uncompressed format...say .png...and see the 
effect of resizing this image in a browser window. This should explain 
truncation.
And Anti-aliasing was brought in because our eyes do a lousy job at 
sampling...and because the computer monitor has a fixed screen resolution.

of course

One can never know the difference between the analog and discrete. We 
always 'see' digital. The eye does a spatial sampling (a frame) and a 
time sampling (movie). What we see is a movie played at approx. 30 
frames per sec.
So...the real problem is how to make things discrete so that its more 
acceptable and pleasing for us (for eg. anti-aliasing).

That is precisely why transparency was brought in.

Is there anything like a textual image viewer??? Its difficult for me to 
comprehend how this would work. Any references/links?

Now...coming to images...as to why things are easy when they are 
rectangular. They key is this: the encoding of an image is very orderly 
when a rectagle is maintained. _Any_ image encoder exploits this.
As mentioned before, if an 'irregular' image is needed, specify the 
necessary pixels to have 100% transparency (called alpha in most cases). 
I dont think JPEG can do this...any decent lossless compression scheme 
like PNG has transparency.

A nitpick:
A rectangle needs only two points = 4 variables.
Assuming that the vertices are numbered continuously,
(x1, y1) + (x3, y3) or (x2, y2) + (x4, y4) is enough.

This also equates to 'analog' vs 'digital' in some fashion.

Thats why the underlying 'bounding rectangle' is always used. IOW
whatever be the visual shape the system treats it as a rectangle
- technically the smallest rectangle with its edges parallel to the
screen that contains the shape.

I do not know if it really qualifies as a `text image viewer' but
zgv (or any other svgalib centric program) can display an image
without the necessity of X running.

Excuse me but please what ?

thanks but you are confused. the fact that it is even today keep-it-simple
doesnt detract lameness , in fact you only add to the argument. think
about it.

huh? what has this got to do what i said ? you are _emphasizing_ that
keeping it simple is the key. we [at least i] _know_ this. think about it
before flaming. the reasoning behind the original post was made was _why
the simplicity_ and you are just stressing a tautology [its simple and
hence done like this].  i dont disagree , i just think its known

wait . stop before you give me a lesson on parametrization. i know this
stuff. so please can we just cut it out?

again, so lets make the analogy: oh why doesnt linux have scalable smp
support ? "lets keep it simple. we handle UP fine....." . i _agree_ with
your statements but thats not what i even replied for.

my pt was there are some basic problems with imaging on the screen which i
think are key problems. lets go thro' this argument again shall we:
I think you are justifying the current setup saying its simple.  I am
emphasizing that `yes its simple [rectangular objects] hence lame. it can
be complex [irregular imags].  however note there are some limiting and
important points in imaging in general [analog to digital]`

now am i clear ? or do you still think that i live without knowledge of
what you say.

HUH. look , i bet you latched onto one statement and intended to flame
away. read the above statements again. i was indicating that there is this
inherent problem with

duh me. its definitely my bad. interpolation is a wrong term. i didnt see
that i had used it and cant believe it too - oh and i think thats what set
you off like a jackrabbit ?? please read on for what i actually meant. i
am surprised that you didnt understand what i meant but instead thought
"there is no interpolation  here! you are crapping!" . nice.

OT: please dont talk to me about sampling; i am spending my time daily
with DSP systems here so i would like to at least SEE something else in my
free time.

read your last line. if you hadnt jumped the gun you would have seen this
was exactly what i was describing.

so what are you trying to say ? 'the real problem is how to make things
discrete' ? which is also what i said.

look i know what you are saying. kiss is the principle but that is
tangential to the point i mentioned which was its limited by an
analog-digital transformation. [you can argue that what i said was a
tautology too] . i dont see how what you said in anyway contradicts
what i said.

BUT let me guess, it felt nice to flame knowledgably ? imho, i think you
could have said it in superposition with what i said.  your wish though.
thanks anyways for the post.

hello,

Linux^WGNU/Linux (srs, I am a quick learner ;)) is usually
"distributed". The one you are referring to is called Redhat. And, you
dont need CDs 4 and 5. Read the other threads.

The core of _your_ OS is the kernel, and its called Linux. The userspace is
from GNU and many operating systems share these tools, simply because
they are the best. eg: FreeBSD, "Linux", etc..

The kernel is compiled just like a normal program. Since Linux is a
monolithic (pseudo maybe ?) one, its a single, huge chunk.

Many projects (FreeBSD, GNOME) use a "build sheriff", which continuously
builds the CVS, and when it breaks, it sends an email to the
maintainers. Thats a good way to keep the CVS in a buildable state.
IIRC, GNOME uses Tinderbox.

Testing is done by humans. Linux is released very often (Oh no! not
another release). 

If you like receiving email (I do), I suggest subscribing to the
linux-kernel mailing list. It maybe an overkill at start. You have been
warned !

I can't understand this. Does your "screen" refer to the monitor

dude, you definitely have a sadistic bent recommending newbies to

i was subscribed for more than a couple of years - and found out that 
the amount of time i used to take to delete all the mails was more than 
the amount of time i spent reading interesting+relevant mails [~10-25%

seriously speaking though i highly recommend www.kernelnewbies.org and

I am supposed to specifically "see" something ? I am used to seeing the

Well, this is OT but what the heck, actually, you never really 'see'
what your eyes see.  You see a projected and interpolated/extrapolated

Yes agreed. kc is very nice. There are other projects too covered by kc 
[like debian hurd, kde etc]. 

I also forgot to mention 
             http://www.kerneltrap.org [1] 
which is really turning out great.

Hello All,

  How to setup automatic font download in website ?

  Suppose If Tamil web site is Viewed by GNU/Linux user and 
  the tamil font is not in the machine then that perticular
  font should get installed in his/her machine automatically.

  How its works ?

  Is it differ frm Dynamic font ?

Noticed this in the recent subject-lines of ILUGC. One optimum way of
sharing distros could be to set up a CD Repository. We, in Goa, make it a
point to buy one copy of the latest distros (say from linuxplaza.org or
from lincds.com) and then pass it around to as many people who want to
copy it. This way, the distro gets 'life' of its own, and there are enough
copies floating around our small state for anyone to get access to when
required. Of course, it calls for a small initial investment, of around Rs
35 to 50 per CD. Not a big price to promote GNU/Linux perhaps! The idea is
catching on, and we're trying to promote it among Little League LUGs (the
smaller groups) in places like Mangalore, Pondicherry and Belgaum. FN

not true. the last two cd's contain only sources and no binary packages at
all. even the 3rd cd is partly binaries and partly sources.

sriram

ps: there is perhaps more than one 5cd set. in fact, redhat seems to have 
several flavours with different combinations of support and non-free 
packages thrown in. the official boxed redhat cd's make almost no sense in 
india; what you get is mainly support and if you are in india, there is 
not much support you can get.

  Subject: [ilugc] Windows XP, RH-8 and MDK-9- GRUB bootloader problem


  Dear Luggies

  Thanks to Dr.Sriram for proving me the latest distros of RH8 and MDK.9 =
CDs.

  I was having Windows XP with RH 7.3 in my machine with GRUB as =
bootloader.
  I removed RH 7.3 and installed RH 8 with same GRUB as bootloader. Both =
Windoze and
  RH 8 were working fine. Partiion structure of my harddisk is
  =20
    C  10 GB Windows
    D  10 GB Windows=20
    E  10 GB Windows
    F  5+5  GB MDK9 & RH 8
  =20
  Later I installed MDK 9 in expert mode in a 5 GB Partition.  While =
doing so I did not=20
   install the GRUB boot loader in the primary partition instead created =
a boot floppy.
  I was having confusion where to write the boot loader so that while =
booting I will get the choices of 3 Oses to choose) Now I am able to =
boot into MDK 9 and Windows only through boot floppy which I had =
created. In the normal mode when I start the machine the system stops =
after displaying GRUB.=20

  From MDK 9 the output for /sbin fdisk /dev/hda is as follows

   start end block id
  /dev/hda1  1 1216 c win95 FAT32
  /dev/hda2  1217 4865 f win95 FAT32 Extd LBA      =20
  /dev/hda5  1217 2432 b win95 FAT32
  /dev/hda6  2433 3648 b win95 FAT32     =20
  /dev/hda7  3649 4228 b win95 FAT32
  /dev/hda8  4229 4241 83 Linux      =20
  /dev/hda9  4242 4800 83 Linux
  /dev/hda10  4801 4605 83 Linux swap =20

  Kindly suggest me a solution in detail. What should I do to boot my =
machine in normal way
  and for the GRUB to display all the 3 Oses.

  I tried to boot  RH 8 using boot floppy. It displays several error =
messages=20
  and not booting properly.

  Will the problem solved if I just reintall reinstall RH 8 ?=20
  To remove MDK9 it is suggested - Delete all partition from harddisk =
and replace them=20
  by single FAT using Diskdrake. Is it the only way. If I remove MDK =
will the problem solved.

  Thaking you in advance.

well, i keep making my offers to make the cd's and people come by. 
however, there are always people who join the list and immediately 
request the cd's (without checking the archives). maybe, we should have a 
faq section (we do already?) in our website and address this.

Along these lines...I have Redhat 8.0/7.3, Mandrake 9.0, Knoppix, 
FreeBSD 4.7. Anyone around Madras who wants a copy, send me a mail, come 
with good CD-R and collect them burned when you want to.

Also, anyone has OpenBSD and Debian 3.0 I can borrow for copying?

Thanks,
H.

Hi Guys & Gals (do we have any?),

There has been mention that we should do something for Christmas as a 
team, especially since we have grown so much since our conception a few 
of months ago.  I'm just sitting here thinking and off the top of my 
hear, how does this sound?

On a saturday (perhaps the 28th of Dec although reply and discuss) we 
have a bit of a get together during the day where we do general linuxy 
geeky type things, sit around and chew over issues.  There is a 
possibility I can get my place set up with a couple of tables for some 
PC's etc and we have a nice patio for sitting outside if the geekiness 
call for it.

After that, we head into town say about 7pm and go to some kind of 
resteraunt, possibly a curry or thai or whatever people can handle (I 
know what you're gonna shout out, Mark!).

But, how many people are going away for the holidays?  What dates would 
suit?  How about as early as this weekend coming (14/15)?.  Reply and 
let us all know.

Cheers!

Tldp has a howto on Intranet setup well written by Pramod Karnad -a
little dated but functional though.

TTF is true type fonts on windows. I was assuming browser was on
windows. If browser is on linux, similar fonts in X need to be linked I
guess. Before this javascript can be used to check environment and
redirect to appropriate page or check font availability and link in
needed.

Any browser cannot  run on the kernel  per se.  I have yet  to see one
;-) Do not mistakenly think that the kernel Linux does everything.  By
spreading this lie, you are committing a technical blunder.  The actual
system should  be called as GNU/Linux and  it is easier to  call it as
GNU.  Calling the system Linux is false, it is the GNU system.

[snip, stuff on GNU]

	I *am* using a threaded mail reader, but when I see the subject:
line reading "Automatic font download" and get a history on the GNU project
inside, I'm not completely amused. If you radically change the topic of
discussion, please exercise the effort to tag the change, appropriately.

	I'm surprised that I see "bad netiquette" email from a person like
_you_, that sends out an X-no-Cc: flag, which _you_ expect me to honor. 

	I was initially gonna say, "Lets not get GNU rant on the list at a
level of 1 per 2 msgs flying across, since the subscriber base remains
fairly constant, and anyone reading 50% of the mail flying on ILUGC would
know all about the GNU project", but I just dont have the energy to get into
a flamewar.

	Preach all about the GNU that you want. Just make it easier for
people like me that don't want to read about it, easier ...

well, actually you will probably need something that is neither gnu nor
linux kernel - that would be X - unless you are one of the few who still
try to use text based browsers. it is unfortunate that the gnu/linux
shouting brigade is not keen to give credit to X but would take about one
atto-second to s%linux%gnu/linux or even preferably s%linux%gnu as in the
above. why dont you try to convince red hat or mandrake (and so on) to
call their product as gnu/linux instead of posting off-topic followup like 
this? the original post subject is there above, but see how it has now 
gone in an entirely different direction. at least, have the courtesy to 
add something to the subject line like i have done above, so the archives 
will be meaningful in future.

	Amen to that and I have to admit, Mr. Bhat's totally irrelevant rant is
really getting on my nerves and wasting my time too. Apparently, he has
no freaking clue about what the 'Subject' header is meant for.

	I suggested to him in private email that he create a
gnu-linux-ragu-advocacy-aka-rambling-aka-absolute-junk-aka-subscribe-if-you-are-nuts list but it seems my suggestion fell on deaf ears.

hi,

if you want to do gnu/linux techno-blunder hubba-hubba preaching then mail
him off-list. please ? i bet if they look at stats for ilugc half the
posts will be your 'now here sonny, its not linux but gnu/linux'.

seriously, i agree with you. everybody does. the logic is there. then why
cant you even take the pains to say it nicely ? 'sinking ship', 'killing
people' , 'technical blunder' and other choice adjectives. what makes you
think people will know things just like that ? do you aknow other fields,
all of them ? what exactly is your point ? cut some slack for newbies.

having said this i will constructively offer two ways to do this. they
might be more, please feel free to choose. they are: a) reply to the MAIL
dammit and then in a p.s or as last line say 'hey you know the real name
is gnu/linux because linux is just the kernel and gnu is the system on
it'.  is that tough ? b) reply to them offlist with your pet rant.  both
of these are perfectly acceptable.

think about it.

everyday i hear __extremely___ intelligent people say 'oh linux. that geek
system', 'oh linux, yeah i tried it man and some guy came after me for
making some stupid mistake'. its frustrating because these are the same
people who will really understand the value of open source systems when
they see it. but you throw them off. maybe first few times they dont
understand. if you are so damn confident of gnu and its greatness then
eventually it WILL appeal to their senses that indeed gnu is the system
with lk as the core.

i think you will be absolutely surprised by the results. it will be `the
nice guy on the list helped me`....mentality is people will hear MORE of
what you have to say than less. thats Manners 101 for you.

technical life is not social life. please draw the difference between
flaming on technical issues rather than personal ones.

do what you do well. if you are a preacher then preach nicely.

frankly i started out much much more radical than you did [ask prabhu]
however i dont believe in it now, fundamentally dont believe in this kind
of zealotry, i would take the suits thank you . doing EE after CS has
helped me open up in that sense. i can sense frustration of a person who
cannot get a simple thing done and ask a small qn only to get immediately
flamed at the same being wholly competent in another field. its one word -
unprofessional.

if you want to be in mainstrame please grow up. otherwise you are always
indie, fringe, hippie whatever. go and cry on slashdot with the other
trolls.

i postponed this reply many times. now that ravi [hi:)] has spoken and
prof.sriram i decide to bite, because i am not interested in an individual
flamewar but vox populi.

thanks. regards,

			Vikram

hello all,

    I am a newbie to linux.  I don't know anything about Linux.  I have 
planned to start with MKS networking tutorial at MKS homepage.  So I 
downloaded the tutorial from MKS homepage (gnu-linux-nw-tutorial-0.2.ps).  
It is giving the extension as .PS.  I tried to open it, but it couldn't 
open.  At present I am working as a VB programmer and i am working in 
Windows 2000 Professional.

    How can I open the .PS file.

Linux is the kernel, GNU is the OS.

Read http://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html

Change the case of Saravanan sir's  tutorial to lower and open it with
the viewer  `ghostview'.  Ghostview  or xpdf can  be used to  read the
Postscript file.

	You might want to start looking at pine, or mutt, if you feel brave
enough. There are some graphical mail readers too, such as Sylpheed, and VM
from inside XEmacs, which are quite nice, and powerful. Kmail sends out
lousy email, so I wouldn't suggest it, though I have no idea if the
interface is any good. It probably is considering so many people use it.

	Dont you still have the folder with a bunch of dbx and pbx and
whatever files lying around? If yes, you can still run dbx => mbox convertor
programs and then view them with your favorite mail client.

	i.e. If outlook <whatever> cannot render your emails, thats OK. You
can still try and get back your stuff. If however your entire hard disk
died, tough luck.

	I have a cronjob that emails several different machines/hard disks
tarballs of my weekly emails ...

This is true.  RH has an enterprise edition of some sort, which was what

  Welcome to GNU/Linux World :)

  Easy. In X-Window Open a Xterm Terminal OR 
  use Run Command option.

  In the command prompt type: gv mksfile.ps

  By using gv, U can view PDF files also.

  Plz feel free post ur doubts in the list.

I've seen many a flame and have myself posted saying let us avoid flaming.
I've seen such posts many a time from a few trying to correct everyone else
on Linux or GNU/Linux etc. While I like opensource and mean it in spirit, it
is quite irritating when some one keeps plugging in/nitpicking on semantics.
It is no different from flaming.

Dalda is a brand but became a generic name for cooking grease. History has
its ways. Similarly, Linux is recognised and understood by many and the

Any browser cannot  run on the kernel  per se.  I have yet  to see one
;-) Do not mistakenly think that the kernel Linux does everything.  By
spreading this lie, you are committing a technical blunder.  The actual
system should  be called as GNU/Linux and  it is easier to  call it as
GNU.  Calling the system Linux is false, it is the GNU system.

Hi,
If u want to find the contents of that package ..here is the command to do that:
$ rpm -ql  <package_name>
This basically queris for that package and gets the files in that.

For more see ,just rpm <return>
this will show the options in that.
Thanks

Hi all,
Am planning to install RH 8.0 (thanks to prof sriram :) ), have 5.5 GB of hard disk space, 128 MB RAM. 
Which is the ideal partioning and how much space should i allocate for each partition. The comp is going to be used for general home use -- surfing the web, some openoffice applications, music and hopefully some games...

Cheers,
Venkat

Everybody likes to do this differently, and it also depends on what
packages you plan to install. Anyway, my notebook has similar
constraints and here is how it is setup -

Part.   Size    Used
/       200MB   22MB
/var    300MB   79MB
/usr    2GB    920MB
/home   2GB    1.5GB
swap    260MB
/tmp    sym linked to /var/tmp/tmp

Btw I run debian. I don't run gnome/kde/games/openoffice, if you want
to use any of these you should consider making /usr larger.

Since I suspend this machine to disk it needs the extra swap space
(equal to RAM size). You may want to setup swap according to your
machine usage.

Some useful docs to read -

[1] The Multiple-Disk Howto http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Multi-Disk-HOWTO.html

[2] FreeBSD tuning(7) manpage (you will have to skip the BSD specific bits)
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tuning&manpath=FreeBSD+4.7-RELEASE

The dosemu-HOWTO (included in the dosemu package describes) how to do
this.

Instead of redirecting LPT? to a device file like /dev/lp0, you can
redirect LPT? to an external program such as lpr/lp. The unix printing
system can then be setup for remote printing.

First, ensure that you can print to the remote printer using the unix
printing tools.

Once this is done, you need to change the relevent sections of your
dosemu.conf so that it looks something like this -

$_printer = "lp"    # list of (/etc/printcap) printer names to appear as
                    # LPT1, LPT2, LPT3 (not all are needed, empty for none)
$_printer_timeout = (20)# idle time in seconds before spooling out

$_ports = ""        # list of portnumbers such as "0x1ce 0x1cf 0x238"
                    # or "0x1ce range 0x280,0x29f 310"
                    # or "range 0x1a0,(0x1a0+15)"

In this example, the printer named "lp" is mapped to LPT1. You can also
assign different printers to the LPT1, LPT2 and LPT3 ports at the same
time.

Upgrade to redhat 7.3 - or redhat 8.  And do an "up2date".

Mandrake - get Mandrake 9

        as i told u sir, the topics shud revolve around programming and nothing else. yes initially we did consider on topics like n/ws os' dbases etc, but an unexplored area, where there is a lot of silent yet good progress happening seems to be programming. 
        am not clear as to what area(s) of programming i can pick up as a topic for this event...

As far as the swap partition is concerned, a guru suggested creating one 
  that is atleast twice the RAM size.

<DIV></DIV>&gt;Hi, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;krishna kumar wrote: 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; We`re running Dosemu 1.0.1-2, and I`m having trouble with printing 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; with a specific tailor-made application that we have here. I`m 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; trying to get it so that I can have a remote office connect to the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; system and print to their local printer. Printing from that 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; application doesn`t work unless a printer is directly attached to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; the computer. Is there any way around this, or any options or 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; something that I could use.. I`ve been looking for information, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; and I hope that someone can help me here. Thanks, kk. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;The dosemu-HOWTO (included in the dosemu package describes) how to do 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;this. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Instead of redirecting LPT? to a device file like /dev/lp0, you can 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;redirect LPT? to an external program such as lpr/lp. The unix printing 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;system can then be setup for remote printing. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;First, ensure that you can print to the remote printer using the unix 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;printing tools. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Once this is done, you need to change the relevent sections of your 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;dosemu.conf so that it looks something like this - 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;$_printer = "lp" # list of (/etc/printcap) printer names to appear as 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; # LPT1, LPT2, LPT3 (not all are needed, empty for none) 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;$_printer_timeout = (20)# idle time in seconds before spooling out 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;$_ports = "" # list of portnumbers such as "0x1ce 0x1cf 0x238" 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; # or "0x1ce range 0x280,0x29f 310" 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; # or "range 0x1a0,(0x1a0+15)" 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;In this example, the printer named "lp" is mapped to LPT1. You can also 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;assign different printers to the LPT1, LPT2 and LPT3 ports at the same 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;time. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;

<P>Iam sending this mail through hotmail hence it is appearing as html. <BR>Yes i went through the dosemu howto and proceeded as it was mentioned. <BR>The printer named "lp" is mapped to LPT1 only. <BR>Whenever, i tried giving print from my dos apps.

My remote printing (ie., sharing to the local printer is working well). This i tried by printing various documents from abiword/gnumeric. </P>
<P>I have the printer configured with address as /dev/lp0.<BR>0378-037a : parport0 (resulted when i typed cat /proc/ioports</P>
<P>What i wanted to do is whatever the default printer selected in the printtool should take the command and start<BR>printing.</P>

<P>I have just included base 03xbc as given in the dosemu website.<BR>But when i give print command from my dosapps it chooses the printer (lp) as given in dosemu.conf, <BR>only not the default printer(lp1) as shown in the printtool. </P>
<P>I went to dosemu.conf where the default entry is<BR>$_printer = "lp" and tried changing to lp1 but in vain. All along i have single printer. For which i want the apps<BR>to print at both local and remote ends depending on the default selection of printer in the printtool.</P>
<P>Then i went to printcap and saw it had two entries as lp, and lp1 with lp = /dev/lp0.<BR>I i thought that lp will be the entry for any local printer entered and rp for <BR>remote printer. <BR>I have added the second entry (lp1 as mentioned above) just to test if the printer prints, when the command from dos apps. </P>
<P>How to find configured printer's port address? How to add lp1 to $_printer in dosemu.conf? (both lp and lp1 is on the same port /dev/lp0 (single printer))</P>

add "-lpthread" to the gcc commandline. It will link

The Kmail interface is tolerably bad (imho, "The Bat" from ritlabs

to Linux I'll switch in a flash) . But I'd like for you to elaborate on what

Ugh.  Tried "The Bat" and found it extremely non intutive, though yeah,
I will be the last to deny that it is powerful.

My favorite for UI (clean and simple) is Eudora Lite, and after that
Outlook Express 6 (with OE-Quotefix - http://www.jump.to/oe-quotefix/ -
that makes a rather decent mailer).

Ximian Evolution is not bad at all btw.

Hi!,

anybody tried Mahogany (mahogany.sf.net) ?

Its written using wxWindows and hence cross-platform.

A super mail client is GNUMail which is a clone of NeXT/Apple's mail client. Its written in objective-c using the GNUstep framework. Sports a very intuitive user interface.

Hello,

My name is Henrik Nilsen Omma, and I am one of the project leaders of a new 
Open Source Project called TheOpenCD.  Our aim is to create a simple to use CD 
distribution of Open Source software for Windows, and in that way spread the 
OSS message. I'm writing to various LUGs to announce the launch of our first 
edition, and hope that you might find it a useful tool in promoting Linux and 
OSS to a wider public.

The disc allows new users can try out Open Source software (OSS) in the  comfort
of their own, familiar operating system, rather than having to take  the drastic
step of reformatting their hard drive to install Linux or BSD. The  collection,
which includes OpenOffice.org, AbiWord and Beonex is primarily  intended for
non-technical computer users. However, we expect that the disc  will appeal
first to experienced OSS users, who will hopefully find it a  useful vehicle by
which to introduce OSS to their less computer-savvy friends.

We invite all OSS enthusiasts to download the ISO, burn CDs and distribute  them
widely to friends, local schools, universities, and companies.  We  further
encourage you all to stop by our to comment, discuss and contribute!

http://www.theopencd.org/

Best wishes,

	Henrik Nilsen Omma
	& TheOpenCD Team

Will it affect other areas if i removed the old kernels. (Next kernel update i tried with "i" buy even then it display's the old kernel. Your help will be greatly appreciated.

In /etc/passwd, you can chroot a user to his home directory as jailed /.
I think it is /<home> /  in the home directory entry. However, then, you
will need to symlink bin, sbin etc so that utilities work else no
command would work with the changed root. Quite a pain to set up one
like this I think. Any ideas from any one else?

Mozilla is THE BEST on windoze systems - bit heavy but worth it

  Yes Possible. U can remove the display list OR u can 
  remove it frm machine itself. But 2nd is unnecessary it will 
  occupy only few MBs :)

  For the 1st
  If Ur using LILO BootLoader then edit the /etc/lilo.conf 
  For more info read man lilo.conf :)

  If Ur using GRUB BootLoader then "I DON'T KNOW" :)

  No. Correct me if it is wrong :)

In global login script check for the environement variable SSH_TTY and

command.

hi,

i suppose you are updating using redhats up2date feature. i would not
quite call it a patch since it actually installs replacement packages and
deletes exisiting ones - except for kernel. if you delete an existing
(working) kernel and install a new one which does not boot, you are really
in bad shape since you machine is not bootable anymore. hence, it is
recommended to install new kernels using the i option (which leaves
existing kernel intact) rather than the u or f options (which delete old
packages and leave only the new version of package installed).  once you
check that the machine is booting, you could do a rpm -e (package name) to
erase the old version of the package. in your case, you could do an rpq -q
kernel to get a list of the installed kernel versions and then do rpm -e
kernelxxxx for each of the old kernel versions installed (xxx as printed
out by the rpm -q command). on the next boot, you will see only you latest 
kernel in the boot menu.

sriram

ps: all this can be found at our local redhat updates mirror site readme 
file. visit http://ftp.iitm.ac.in/linux/redhat/updates

	Its the same thing. Just edit menu.lst (I think) and remove the
entry for whatever kernel image you don't want appearing as an option.
Infact, IIRC, grub didn't even need you to run the equivalent of "/sbin/lilo
-v" everytime you edit the file. It reads it while booting time, and allows
you to dynamically edit the config file at boot time.

	Disclaimer: This is from pre-1.0 grub days. Things have probably
changed now.

I find a console MUA to be convenient, as I ssh from school to

If the remote client is DOS based, local printing can be done by inserting
an escape sequence to the text displayed.(ie) If you need it on the
printer at the client side.

The exact escape sequence depends on the type of 'term' you emulate.

If you are new to grub and have been on lilo for a while, you will be
amazed at the capabilities of grub. You donot have to run "grub" or
"grub-install" everytime after you update your menu.lst file (the
equivalent of lilo.conf). grub reads from the menu.lst file everytime
before it loads and uses information from it. grub can be like a mini
OS! it can read many filesystems like ext2, reiserfs, etc.,. Many a
times I tend to forget my root partition and grub comes into the play...
at the grub menu I just have to do:

grub> find /etc/fstab
(hd0,5)
(hd1,3)

grub> 

now from here, I can even look at the contents of the fstab file:

grub> root (hd0,5)
root (hd0,5)
filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83
grub> cat /etc/fstab
...
...
(contents of fstab file)
...
...
grub>


now I have a doubt, will grub continue to work if I remove menu.lst;
defragment my /boot filesystem; create menu.lst and without running
grub-install reboot the machine? there are things that I dont want to
try ;) has anybody tried this?

Hi luggies!,

Yesterday, I ran out of disk space. So I decided to burn a CD containing the stuff I downloaded from the net. 

Is anybody interested in having the CD replicated ?

Stuff include:
compilers/interepreters, gui toolkits, free books, numerous articles on a wide variety of computing topics. CVS snapshots of popular sf.net projects. etc.

If intereted I can also add Win32 stuff such as OpenWatcom source tree and binary distrib that I built recently. 

So, interested people plz email me and not to the list. I'm working on a full index. 'll update the list when I'm finished.

cheers,
-Krish

i thought it was chroot, not chkroot; anyway, chrooting a user to their 
home directory can have very bad effects. as pointed out by an earlier 
reply, this chroot will take /sbin, /bin and such things out of reach. 
symbolic links in the users' directory will not solve the problem - in 
fact, it will probably create circular symbolic links which lead nowhere. 
even things like bash will be out of reach. if you really want to do this, 
here is the way to do it.

(1) prepare a list of commands/programs/packages that the user is going to 
be allowed to use (including shells like bash)

(2) place a copy of every one of the items from (1) within the users' home 
directory; hard links or symbolic links will not work and the binaries 
will have to be here.

does not sound too bad, but actually, the worst is yet to come. every one 
of the programs copied to the users' directory in step (2) must be self 
contained. for statically linked packages, this is not a problem. however, 
most things will use dynamically linked libraries. in that case, there are 
two (both painful) options. we can recompile each of the chosen packages 
from (1) with statically linked libraries - which will bloat the packages 
like anything. the second option is to use ldd or some such tool to get a 
list of all the dynamic libraries used by all the packages and copy all 
these packages to the users' home directory (with the proper structure 
like /lib, /usr/lib etc under the home directory).

in short, it is probably not worth the effort. if the intent is to 
restrict what the user can do, there are other alternate approaches like 
restricted shells.

well, i have (unintentionally) tried a few of these, so i can reply. grub
will work if you remove menu.lst, but since there is no menu.lst, you will
straightaway get the grub> prompt. since no menu.lst file was read, there
will be no entries for kernel, root device etc. but, you can boot the
system from here by entering all the required stuff (kernel, root device).
defragging the /boot filesystem has no effect at all. at the time of
grub-install, the /boot partition entry (hdx,y) information is stored. as
long as this is not changed, grub will look at the /boot partition,(load
the stage 1 from the boot sector of that partition), see the file system
there and read all the appropriate files, from inside that file system -
including menu.lst (or grub.conf), kernel etc. (actually, i could be wrong
about the above since i have not tried it; the stage 1.5 might not load, i
suspect). however, if /boot does not exist as a separate partition but is
part of /, defragging this partition will probably screw things beyond
redemption (have not tried this; have no machines without separate /boot
partition). but seeing how good the functionality of grub is, i would not
be surprised if grub is able to work around this too (by seeing the /
partition and looking for the /boot directory inside that; it anyway looks
for the grub directory inside /boot, so it should not be too hard to look
for /boot inside / first and then doing the rest).

Message-ID: <F8T47wvkY7ELxOjKIRR00010204@hotmail.com>

<html><div style='background-color:'><P>Hallo, </P>
<P>Hope i shall make my question simple. A remote user telnets in to the local machine and access the dos based apps. If he gives print in the dosapps it should start printing in the printer at his end. For that i had configured his printer as a remote printer in my local machine. So that whenever he logs in, the default printer selected in the printer will be the one at his end. Though it is remote to me. I have tried other apps like abiword etc., and the remote user could log in and take printouts at his end without any problem. Even with dosapps in dosemu this is happening but for that the printer name should be lp. Else dosapps is not printing. I would like to know by adding extra printer=lp1 in dosemu.conf. will the printing take place. This is the problem with dosemu config. rather than configuring remote printers. </P>
<P>Solution if any,</P>
<P>thanks,</P>

Hi luggies,

As promised, the contents of the "to-be-written" cd is attached with this msg.

Seems like it will take atleast 2 CDs.

NOTE: the file has "..." in certain places meaning that there is more that needs classification.

I forgot to mention. I live in Salem and not in chennai.

Mailertables don't work this way.

But my doubt is, whether a cache-only named server can be preferred

sending mails to LAN machines. 

Set up split horizon DNS.

Hi,
or should I say GNOME problem?

  did Win2k/RH8 custom install with grub loaded on   
/boot partition

 h/w config: 
  pentium4 1.7 Ghz, 256 MB Ram, 
  Intel 845 onboard graphics.

 Opened a terminal console from gnome as regular user
  and typed in slocate X*|less.

  was scrolling down with page down and next thing I  
  get: segmentation fault message and the terminal  
crashed.

  happened another time while using man command from
gnome desktop in terminal console

 Has anyone had any similar problems?

 Is it gnome or X-related or just problem with onboard
graphics?

 Using I810 driver with 800*600 for 15inch (HP
monitor). This is my machine at office.

Thanks,
Sanjay

I'm not sure about what you want. 

Three distinct pieces of code:
1) The chat application itself (ie, the GUI)
2) Networking code 
3) The server 

(Chat client code) > (networking code) > (Chat server)

I assume that you are interested in the second layer (networking code).

Some questions:
+ Is your net-code application specific (just for your application)
+ Do you want a generic firewall (with a proxy capability)


	regards,

	Ganesh.

Redraw bug in terminal. Not sure what terminal widget RH8 ships with.
zvt was unmaintained. GNOME 2.2 will use vte.  

So do not try anything that scrolls down too fast, like compiling code. 
Its awfully slow (even with GNOME 2.1.4 released today).

Gnome is reason. Should be fixed when you up2date.

I read this tip somewhere. You do not need to be
root to install an rpm file. `open' the .rpm file (if that
is what you mean) in mc by hitting enter on its name.
It shows the directories and files in the package. One can
even copy the files to a temporary location and use them
(is possible)

I did actually evaluate TurboVision clone for DJGPP, but it made no
sense to use "Text UI", when I can get 32-bit 800x600 with Allegro on
the same compiler. This was for a school project, BTW, so a "coolness"
factor is very important.

I find Turbo Vision to be overly complicated (probably C++ crud), when
you have much cleaner toolkits..

> Any other old time borland users on this list?

Many schools still use TC 3.0 and 3.1. Very fast compile times.

I thought RPM files were a simply a modified form of the CPIO format.

IIRC, while building garnome, it extracts the BlueCurve theme (which was
a rpm) using cpio. But watching compile lines scroll by for two hours is
insane, so I maybe wrong.

There is  Akaram TAB/TSC editor.   It also has a  nice Transliteration
keyboard using which you can  easily type tamil without having to know
the tamil  keyboard layout.  You can  download Akaram and  a few fonts
required for the same from:

		    ftp://ftp.tamillinux.org/apps/

Unfortunately  there is  no  such widely  adopted  standard for  tamil
typing. So  if you are planning  to write an article,  to say Kumudam,
you have to first  write a mail in english and ask  them what is their
Tamil Encoding Standard  and then send your document  in that standard
and send it across. Most do accept TSCII.

There  is a  mailing list  called tamilinix  (Note, not  tamillinux or
somesuch). This  is about tamil  computing on _any_ Unix  platform and
this isn't   necessarily  a free   software discussion list.   If  you
are a free software enthusiast, you can wear your anti-non-free filter
glasses and read their mailing list. because thats what I do...

I gather that you want to have two DNS "zones" -
	1. Public zone which is world visible, and a
	2. Private zone which is visible only inside your own network.

http://www.freebsddiary.org/privatedns.php will get you there in no
time. I've replicated this on our debian boxes running bind8 with great
success.

This document explains how to setup a single dns server to serve a
private and a public network with the correct restrictions on queries,
zone transfers, etc.

`free tools' to work on Wireless, I shall make it.

Honestly, I am not the right person to ask.  However I dont think you
will need to do anything special.  If you are coming in by car you
will need a pass anyway so just walk up to the guys and tell them what
you are planning to do.  I dont think they will bother you much.  The

<html><div style='background-color:'><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My knowledge about split-horizon dns is that it's not two DNS servers, it just means that your DNS server gives <BR>different ips for the same names to queries from internal vs external. <BR>Added to that with ISC's BIND, one can create a "stub" "zone" for each domain, listing the IP address of the replacement content DNS server in "named.conf" and reconfiguring the content DNS server to support the "zone transfer" DNS database replication mechanism. </DIV>
<DIV>Is there any webpage containing the practical example or instructions on how to setup split horizon using bind9. </DIV>
<DIV>Thanks,<BR>kk</DIV>
<DIV>p.s. Setting up of split-horizon was suggested by Mr. Balasubramaniam, based on my query, which goes as, <BR>sending emails to the internal domain (clients) without isp dns lookup (as we are connecting to the external world through dialup).

hi,

the password as above is meant to prevent access to non-standard booting
(for example, booting into single user mode; prevents interactive access
to grub, actually*). standard booting will proceed without the password.  
if you want to protect a particular boot image with a password, you will
have to edit the /etc/grub.conf file and put a lock or password statement
inside the appropriate image section. the password statement is more
flexible since it allows a per-image password while the lock statement
will ask for the common password. read the info page of grub (the section
on security) to get more details.

sriram

*: it may sound inocuous, but interactive access to grub is very 
dangerous. forget entering the system in single user mode; you can do 
more. since grub understands file systems, but does not implement file 
ownership and access controls, there are many many things you can do from 
the grub command line. you could cat /etc/shadow, for example (if you know 
which disk partition is holding /etc/); and, since the system has not 
booted yet, you will leave no trace in any log files....

You dont even have to know where etc resides... you could just do find
/etc/shadow and then do a root (hdX,YY) and cat /etc/shadow!

I wish it had a pager like less or more ;)

Message-ID: <F83o8yfogkJXrRjbDt30000f2e3@hotmail.com>

<html><div style='background-color:'><DIV>Hallo, </DIV>
<DIV></DIV>Hope i shall make my question simple. A remote user telnets in to the local machine and access the dos based apps. If he gives print in the dosapps it should start printing in the printer at his end. For that i had to be configured his printer as a remote printer in my local machine. So that whenever he logs in, the default printer selected (manually done by opening printtool) in the printer will be the one at his end. Though it is remote to me. I have tried other apps like abiword etc., and the remote user could log in and take printouts at his end without any problem. Even with dosapps in dosemu this is happening but for that the printer name should be "lp". Else dosapps is not printing (say for lp1 etc.,). I would like to know by adding extra step printer=lp1 in dosemu.conf. will the printing take place. I think this is the problem with dosemu config. rather than configuring remote printers. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>Solution if any, 
<DIV></DIV>

You have to add swap only if you have increased your RAM, increasing the size of the hard disk partition doesn't require you to increase the swap size. If you have increased the RAM this is the process for increasing the swap file size. 
Linux can happily accept more than one swap partitions. Infact,             
it doesn't need to be a partition. It only needs to be a file with 
continuous 
storage. (This is explained in man mkswap)

So you can create a file like this:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/usr/extraswap bs=1024 count=65536
# to create 64 MB swap (I think there's a limit of 128MB for each file)

Swap file needs a signature before you can use it:
mkswap /usr/extraswap

#Start using the swap
swapon /usr/extraswap

#See it in action
top

You can also put it in /etc/fstab so that it is picked automatically
after each boot (by swapon -a from rc scripts)


Also read the lines below for your reference

Actually it is an erroneous recommendation for most people. For kernels
2.4.0 - 2.4.9, There was a quite radical VM (Virtual Memory) system 
that
provided great performance, at the cost of some predictability (Rik Van
Riel wrote it, you can search for that name on google.com/linux and
probably get more info about it). One of the things that helped the
system function more effectively was to have 2xRAM as your swap. The
reasons for this are complex and I don't fully understand them.

What I do know is that the VM that was plugged in for 2.4.10 and later,
which brought more stability, has no such recommendation. I generally
make swap equal to RAM upon system install, but I don't fret over it
after that. On a workstation, if you're swapping a lot, you might want
more, but performance is only going to suffer. On a server, swapping is
probably out of line, and should be dealt with by popping in some more
RAM.

If you think RAM is too expensive... think again. 


I used to run my DNS, web, and mail server, on an AMD 5x86-133. This is
essentially a really fast 486. When I first installed the system, it 
had
24MB of 486 Parity RAM. I added some php and 5 email users to the
system, and things started getting ugly. Mainly because I had to switch
from using boa, to apache. I had 128MB of swap space, and about 40% of
that was in use at all times. I went online, bought 128MB of EDO RAM,
and threw it in there. Suddenly everything happened in memory, and I 
was
able to host my website, getting 250 - 1000 hits a day, and eventually
about 15 email users' accounts off that server. Only after I added 5
more websites, all using php, did I have to upgrade it.

My point is, RAM is cheap, and sometimes offers more of a performance
gain than CPU or even faster hard disks. Treat your box to some today!

Please include your existing partition table information as part of the mail 
for members to reply approriately, in case you need to retain the existing 
partition structure. Also indicate how much of free space is available on 
each partition. The best option would be to mail the output of the diskfree 
command
$ df
(assuming you have mounted all file systems)
Get back with more info.

Why do you want GUI on a server?

Did you try to find out why it's slow ? I think Redhat runs Apache by
default (I maybe wrong), so that can be a hog.

Like I've told before, please read the archives. Actually, I found out
that mailman hosts a mbox file, so life is even simpler. Download it and
grep it. See the archives page on chennailug.org

[OT]: Its a shame to see some people using kiddy MUA. :(

To make it really simple, read the threads "Enhance SWAP space" from the
month of August.

This is nonsensical. If I can't add more RAM, then the only other way is
to increase my swap. Ofcourse, I wouldn't be too happy with the
performance on Linux.

One of the problems that I can see here, is that vendors DO NOT ship
vanilla kernels (Debian being the exception). For example, Redhat in its
8 "dot oh" version seems to have put in some realtime kernel code, which
is not officially part of 2.4 series. uname will still report 2.4.x, but
its not vanilla.

This is nonsensical. If I can't add more RAM, then the only other way is
to increase my swap. Ofcourse, I wouldn't be too happy with the
performance on Linux.

One of the problems that I can see here, is that vendors DO NOT ship
vanilla kernels (Debian being the exception). For example, Redhat in its
8 "dot oh" version seems to have put in some realtime kernel code, which
is not officially part of 2.4 series. uname will still report 2.4.x, but
its not vanilla.

Personally, I don't care for fine-grained performance hacks. But, thats
just me.

 KDE is a Window Manager. KOffice is the one of the
 utility avail in KDE Environment.

Similarly

 GNOME,FVWM, TWM, AfterEffect ... are available. Use switchdesk 
 command to switch b/w this Window managers. 

What u mean by Tools ?

In RH 8:
  Download the font frm the website and put it in .fonts
  dir in ur home dir.

In lesser versions
  Copy it in /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ Dir. And U need
  XFSTT Server to render the TTF fonts.

Recent versions of XFree86 (starting from 4.x ?) directly use the FreeType module to render ttf/t1 fonts. So a font server is not required. 

IMO, to install fonts this is preferable:

1. copy the fonts to a seperate dir 
2. run "ttmkfdir -o fonts.scale" in the dir
3. add a "FontPath path_to_ur_fonts" entry in the X configuration file.

This way, if a buggy font causes u trouble (I recently got bit by a few buggy chess fonts!) u can simply remove the font path and everything will work fine.

Apart from this, if you add the fonts in your home directory in the folder
.fonts
it will automatically render those fonts into the applications. This is
possible in RH8.0

Hi,

 Was trying to upgrade mysql and mysql-server on my 
machine. I got  some  conflict and tried to remove old
package.

  I closed the terminal as it looked like it had  
   crashed. After that, rpm reports presence of my-sql

  server package but I am unable to locate any of the
  files associated with package.

 used rpm --c pkgname to identify files, but did not 
find the files on the machine.


 deleted lock files created by rpm db's crash. 

 did rpm --rebuilddb. 

 still have the same problem. still see the lock files
 ( _db.001, _db.002). referred to an online article 
for fixing.


 tried second method :
  1)made a back up of rpm

  2) verified the packages

  3) did rebuilddb with rpm

 still get rpm mentioning that the package
mysql-server
 is present though it is not.

 thx,
 sanjay

If you  want a  luser-friendly alternative (I  heard this one  is like
nero), you can  try kreateCD (its a debian package  in stable. i think
its not there in the testing CDs  that I gave you). You may first have
to use the woody ISOs to install KreateCD. You can do this as follows:

1. mount the ISOs over loop

for i in $(seq 1 7)
do   
  mount -o ro,loop -t iso9660 /wherever/woody/woody$i.iso /mnt/woody/$i
done

2. Add entries to /etc/apt/sources.list for using these ISOs:

for i in $(seq 1 7)
do
 echo "deb file:/mnt/woody/$i woody main contrib" >>/etc/apt/sources.list
 echo "deb file:/mnt/woody/$i woody/non-US main contrib" >>/etc/apt/sources.list
done

3. tell apt about you changes: goto dselect; select 'update'

4. install kreateCD:

apt-get install kreatecd

have fun!

Hmm... strange! Did u try cdrecord ?

I have used cdrecord to write boot CDs for Solaris 8, FreeBSD, Mandrake 8 etc and never had any problems.

If the ISO image is built with the el-torito flag then all u need to do is just burn the image. So if its a stock ISO image, then u should'nt have any problems. If u built the image, then checkout the man page for mkisofs (especially lookout for "-b")

Minutes of Ilugc meet 14th DEC 2002 (Sat)

As per the tradition of ilugc the meet started off late at around 3.30 pm.
There were a few people present.
The speaker who agreed to talk on Intrusion Detection (Mr Amresh) was not
there so we were in search of ideas to start the meet and to keep it going .

1) Our LUG coordinator - Mr Bharathi took the stage first and gave us all an
intro about how BangLinux was conducted. The entry to banglinux was 300/-
which included a T-shirt, lunch for 3 days and coffee. He said that there
were people selling linux distros and proggies.

SOmu distributed some T-shirts meanwhile :)

2) Somu came to the dias after this to deliver a talk on SSH, Basic features
of SSH and what ssh can do. The talk started with somu giving us an intro to
Public key, private key, session key , type of encryption used and
pass-phrases (secure way of using ssh).

        Then somu proceeded to talk on ssh-agents which are used to automate
processes which are tiring like remembering many pass-phrases. He talked
about how to go about adding public keys of various boxes to the ssh agent
using the ssh - add command.

        Then he talked about how to make other services use ssh using port
forwarding. He explained this using a scenario.
                Consider two boxes (one local and one remote). The remote
box has an imap server running on it and the local box wants to access the
imap server to read mails using the secuity of SSH. To attain this the ssh
tunnel is exablished between the server and the client and the imap port
number is binded to another free port on which the ssh listens.This is done
using the command

                                    #ssh L:2001:143:R
where L = local, R=remote , 143 = imap port, 2001 = free port

Then there was a part on agent-forwarding. This is turned on using
forwardagent yes.

Then there was again a case in which there are 2 boxes H (home) and W(work).
The box W is protected from the NET by another box B. When someone wants to
login into W, the person has to login through B to get to W. This can be
done by

1. ssh from H to B and
2 ssh from B to W.
But this case is impossible because the box B does not store any keys. So
agent forwarding comes into action. In this all the keys are stored in the
machine H itself.

BOTTOM LINE - The box B acts as a transperant layer between H and W. (there
were some questions from all sides on this one). Somu finished his talk with
this.

At this point the meet got over and veeryone moved out except a few of us
who were chit-chatting.Then the group of me,Suresh,Bharathi,somu went to
have some coffee in Nandhinee's where we met prabhu with a few of his
friends. There was a little conversation on flamewars there. With this the
meet ended.

Any corrections/ comments welcome :)

In your authoritative dns server, wherever it is for your domain.

No need that the dns server and the server the mx is pointing to should
be the same.

first, you will need to have some boot device on the machines - this could
be floppy or a boot rom on a network card. more importantly, you need to
decide first what kind of connectivity you want to provide from these
nodes. for example, you can put dos and telnet on a floppy and use these
as telnet terminals (sort of like dumb terminals). you could boot dos and
use these as vnc terminals with a vnc server (or servers) running
somewhere on your network - that will give you graphic terminals. at the
other extreme, you could build full diskless linux boxes out of these -
the user wont know it is a diskless machine. of course, with present linux
distributions, pentium machines will feel a bit slow. depending on which 
option you want, i can give a step by step solution.

Addendum to an earlier mail on chrooting to while I had replied and so
had Prof Sriram. I do not know if this would relieve you of creating
symlinks to allow access to common utilities. Have not tried it myself.
Will do soon and let the group know. In the meanwhile, other could try
this too.

Chroot all apps you want
The script http://www.chronox.de/chroot/chroot-0.1.tar.bz2 can be used
to put any application in a chroot jail, removing any capabilities or
let it run under a different user ID. 
Tested with Squid, rinted, SSH, Portmapper. 

Updated to version 0.1 on August 24 2002 

It uses a helper program
http://www.chronox.de/chroot/compartment-1.2.tar.bz2 which is an
upgraded version of the SuSE compartment from Marc Heuse.

The idea is not to keep your passwords in /etc/passwd which is world
readable. Have another file /etc/shadow to keep your passwords which is
only readable by root.

Any basic book on UNIX will explain this. You could also type "shadow
passwords" in google for further funda.

I don't know what gnome-toaster does but the command
# cdrecord file.iso
with proper options writes an image to disk. The image
has to be bootable. mkisofs will say how to make an image
bootable. mkisofs is not needed when the image is available.

The debian iso's are already bootable. You just need to burn them
correctly. Here is how I do it (and it works on x86, sparc and ppc) -

cdrecord -fs=16M -v -eject speed=8 dev=0,6,0 -data -pad diskimg.iso

You will need to replace "speed", "dev", and "diskimg.iso" with your own
values. Ensure that the disk image has an "iso" extension.

The debian_on_cd faq has more (including cd writing using windows
software) -

Googling for qmail + ldap + auth should help you.

Several patches around, several quite well documented howtos.

And the usual waste of time that is "patch qmail and recompile" every
time you want to do anything as simple as authentication.

Switch to exim / postfix / sendmail for a far simpler way to do things.

wvdialconf (a part of wvdial) will find out all the required
initialisation strings. General problem is when you want your modem to
_not_ wait for the dialtone. put ATX0 instead of ATQ in that case.

hi all,

 	Today ,I was working with C, I have the habit of going through 
the code in the Header file. I don't understand onething about 
them

 	* The header files contain just prototypes

 	Where does the actual code for performing an i/o , say using 
scanf() or printf() lie.  As far as i have seen the header files 
dont contain this code (correct me if i am wrong).

 	I beleive this is not off - topic as i was going through some 
source files in Linux

Header files have an extension .h most of the times, and all the

Subject: [Ilugc] C my doubt


hi all,

 	Today ,I was working with C, I have the habit of going through 
the code in the Header file. I don't understand onething about 
them

 	* The header files contain just prototypes

 	Where does the actual code for performing an i/o , say using 
scanf() or printf() lie.  As far as i have seen the header files 
dont contain this code (correct me if i am wrong).

 	I beleive this is not off - topic as i was going through some 
source files in Linux

Thanx all
Harris

you are right !.header files contain only prototypes.
the  actual code for scanf/printf/any library function for that matter are
linked
to the file.they usually exist as library files , in linux they are in .o
(object files ), .a(library archive file)
  .so (shared object file).scanf/printf are in glibc.you can find their
implementation in
glibc's source code.

Message-ID: <200212162118.26530.mvikyk@yahoo.co.uk>

Hi,

My kmail does not support html mail.  How do I make it support?

In case, I need to format my entire hard disk, how do I backup my mails?  
Which is the folder (~/Mail, I suppose) I have to backup and how can I 
retrieve the same?

To make my point clear, assume that I have folders a,b and c each containing 3 
messages a1,a2,a3,b1,b2,b3 and so on..  If I back up the folder to some other 
media and restore the folder to the same location, will I be able to get back 
to the same state of kmail after formating?

Advance Thanks,
c u /

That habit will have to be broken. I believe you were taught this in
school (with TC probably). I was.

> 	* The header files contain just prototypes

Exactly, header files should contain ONLY the prototypes.

Read the other threads.

GLIBC is a beast. You may want to start with something lightweight, like
uclibc.

Hi All,

I have a small doubt in Sockets..

We use sockets for sending data accross the processes.

I am using a TCP socket for such communication.

I need to send one structure using Sockets.

Now please let me know how can I write my structure into the buffer(one of the parameter of send System Call)

Please do reply

Thank you very much. I have arranged with Suraj to lend me that CD, but

Hmmm. Seems like its not a small doubt after all !

If the processes are running on the same machine consider using shared memory - its much faster.

XDR (try googling for it) is a pretty good solution and its the underlying encoding scheme in RPC. 

CDR (google for the spec.) is a variant of XDR that is used in CORBA. 

Another scheme is to use XML to encode structures. This is very simple to use but carries a bit of baggage as it requires an XML parser. But it can be easily debugged. IMO, its the simplest way to encode data. 

For some testimonials, checkout http://www.xmlrpc.com

Your Init1 is ATX0 (that asks wvdial to not wait for the dialtone) and
Init2 has  ATQ0 (which asks wvdial  to _wait_ for  a dialtone).

Try playing with linked list. If you think thats simple,
optimize ==> for(i = 0; i < 10; i++);

What will happen if you compile/run, aith an ansii C compiler, the following
code?

#include <stdio.h>

void f1();

int main (void)
{
	int x = 2;
	int y = 3;
	f1(x, y);

	return 0;
}

void f1()
{
	printf("Hello, world! \n");
}


How can you overload a function in C?

You caqn ofocurse google for obfuscated c programming contest and take a
look at the most weird codes in the world.

If you know the answers to all of those, please tell me the answer for the
last one (yes it can be done). 

Anoop.

My experience with Indian line conditions have been that wait for dial tone
option normally does not work half the time even though we can hear the dial
tone - something to do with the dial tone recognition being very stringent.
I use no wait for dial tone but sleep for 10 seconds using , in the number.
This works fine for me.

Please do not cross post.

Since you say you haven't worked with SQL before, it might be better to
get started with postgresql.

There are tons of information out there for you to get started. Make
sure you have a reference to Generic SQL, and not extensions like P/SQL.

There are also programs that "translate" your queries into SQL.

The best way to learn is by doing. You learn to code by _writing_ code,
and not by _reading_ books. Just like you learn to ride a bicycle by riding
it and not by reading how to ride. [1]

Can't think of any.... :(

********** it should be straight forward if you break those operations into
assembly language instructions.(okay I am not any good in assembly language
but this one is pretty simple.)



> What will happen if you compile/run, aith an ansii C compiler, the
following
> code?

It will print "Hello world". You don't use x and y in f1().

************ I dont use x and y in f1(). fine. but why will it not give a
compile error? Is there any way I can access the values of x and y in the
function stack?

> How can you overload a function in C?

I actually checked this up some months back. There is no way to do it
without kludge. One way is to use dirty macros. The other way is to use
some crude vector symbols. I wasn't able to get any further. The sample
code that I had did not compile on my machine (no errors, but just goes

I have been enjoying pseudo-overloading in C by using function pointers,

**************** yep. but using function overloading is not overloading coz
the signature essentially remains the same. So there must be another way. C
cant do without function overloading okay to save myself from many arguments
that my above statement will get me into let me say it already has function
overloading and by that I essentially mean, different signature.

A little googling would have helped.

What you have is a winmodem. Motorola no longer supports it. Beta
drivers were included with PCQ Linux 7.1, IIRC.

Binary drivers are available from Motorola's website. They _should_ work
with 2.4.5 series.

Maybe you could find a friend who is willing to swap. It works fine
under windows.

Hard Luck !

this is not quite correct. Q0 only turns on response mode so that the
modem returns results when it receives commands. the opposite setting is
Q1 which puts the modem in quiet mode (ie) the modem will not reply to any
commands sent but will quietly execute them (hopefully). X0 is not the
preferred setting for 'do not wait for dial tone'; actually, X0 puts the
modem in basic 300 baud modem response mode (yes, that is 300 baud, which
only oldies like me would have seen/used in real life). X1 or X3 are
usually the preferred settings for blind dialing. your modem documentation
(however limited that may be) may help. most modems will go into blind
dialing mode with X1 or X3.

Simply unroll the loop !

>How can you overload a function in C?
1. Macros in conjunction with the ability to change the name of the
generated assembly symbol ?
2. a precompiler ?
3. use a C++ compiler ;-)


----------Will it then be called overloading? Overloading essentially will
have to involve late binding and so the 1st 2 options are ruled out. 3rd
option is ummmm wellllllllllllllllll not admissible :>)

If you are talking about dynamic dispatch, then there are 2 options I can think of:
1. A VMT approach as used in C++ and most other OO languages.
This approach is fast but it is quite cumbersome to add features like reflection etc.

2. A runtime messenger approach as used in Objective-C and CLOS. 
This approach although slightly slower offers tremendous flexibility. It is very easy to add features like reflection, runtime loading of classes, modifying methods at runtime, adding methods to existing classes etc. Another advantage of this approach is that you can also dispatch events with the runtime messenger. 

btw, have u looked at Objective-C ?

--------------Now thats something really challenging. How about including
writing an operating system from the scratch? :>)

For your viewing pleasure, I've attached the source for an OS kernel !!!

To build the kernel, u need fasm (fasm.sf.net).

Hai

Thanks for the friend who gave the AT commands link. The moment I 
thought, if someone can help providing AT commands list so that i 
myself rectify the problem, the mail came, thanks for friend's 
USP.
Sometime ago somebody insisted to use ATX0 to stop expect dial 
tone instead of ATZ(or some thing, i don't no).Thats why i used 
ATX0, there is no secret. Also in windows i have to set the "don't 
expect dial tone" option to connect the internet.
Before using i used ATX0, Linux can only be able to detect my 
modem at the particular port.Whenever i dialed it gives "NO 
DIALTONE". I thought my modem may be a winmodem. Now i can able to 
dial but this time i get "NO CARRIER".Though now i got AT commands 
list, I need some more help(step by step wvdial.conf configuration 
would be nice).

Friendly,
Guru

Yes, but not directrly (as in there is no form property that will do it).

Wrong place to ask. Sorry.

Kylix from Borland. There is a "free" version too, but you are permitted to 
create only GPL programs with that, the pro and enterprise version let you 
choose runtinme licensing.

Kylix is source compatible with Delphi on Windows (if you use the CLX instead 
of VCL). We use it internally for cross platform development . Also, we do 
VB->Delphi->Kylix to move our desktops from Windows to Linux.

Subject: [Ilugc] [info] postgresql in a production environment
Message-ID: <200212181108.QAA22317@hd2.dot.net.in>

Hello,

	Last week, we at ETV implemented a postgreSQL backend for election results 
updates at Gujarat. There were twelve input clients, and three output clients 
which generated realtime on air graphics. Clients were all Windows 2000 
(anybody know of any good character generators ala CG2000 from matrox running 
on Linux?). 

	There were two Linux machines running postgresql, in an almost failsafe 
environment. The secondary database would pull the most recent data every 
minute via a cron job from the primary and update itself. In case the primary 
db failed, it would shoot the primary (if it was still alive), and take over 
by a simple ip change (I know I know, there are better ways). The clients 
with uncommited transactions would rollback, and the data remains online with 
a worst case scenario of 30 seconds downtime. When the first machine came 
back online in such a scenario, it would begin functioning as the 
secondary... 

	What would make postgres production ready is realtime replication, and I 
guess that would be available in ver 7.3 (any ETA for this?).

	Downsides : The developers were from the Windows world, and made certain 
incorrect assumptions (ex, setup and teardown of tables is fast in MS 
sql2000, and quite slow in postgres; and since they were unaware of this fact 
they were creating temporary tables all over the place for complex queries). 
So, the only problem was their unfamiliarity with the tools....

	in a related note, is anybody aware of MS-Access like DB's for Linux (as in 
ease of use) ? 

regards
BGa

There are plenty of frontend tools for Firebird. Quite a few of them are written using Kylix. Since you mentioned you use kylix for in-house development that should'nt be a problem. 

Another interesting alternative is to use Openoffice. OO has a mechanism for connecting to MySQL databases through unixODBC.

The documentation for MySQL is refreshingly good in my experiences and
like other SQL DB's (Oracle, Postgre) the statement syntax doesn't vary
much so using documentation for the navigation of one of the three can
be used across the board.

1) Take a look at http://www.mysql.com/documentation/ for some examples.
2) Read the Oracle 101 Series of books published by McGraw Hill/Osborne:
	a) Oracle PL/SQL 101
3) Download and install PostNUKE or PHP-NUKE to see MySQL in action
4) Google should return some HowTo's (I'd hope)

Yes.  Under GNU/Linux there is this package lm-sensors.  Lm-sensors is
a hardware health  monitoring package for GNU/Linux. It  allows you to
access   information  from   temperature,  voltage,   and   fan  speed
sensors. It works with most newer systems.

hi,

I have configured the KPPP dialer on my RH 7.2 and it works fine. But I 
am only able to run it as root. Is there any way of running the dialer 
from other user logins?
Incidentally rp3 has a separate dial up conficuration tool (which 
requires root rights) and an independant dialer (which can be run by any 
user).
thanks

For software controlled cooling, the 'hlt' instruction is generally used. But I think 'hlt' is a previlaged instruction and hence can't be use in user mode programs. So a kernel module is required. Did u check the kernel source for a similar tool ? Maybe there is already one.

Difficult to solve this problem.  Could be that you have configured it to 
expire every time you login.

But, before that try this.  As soon as you login for the first time, disable 
the root passwd usign #passwd -d root.  Reboot your system.  It shouldn't ask 
you for the passwd this time.  Then set your root passwd using #passwd.

Let us know how you solve the problem.

It is not required to reinstall it.  You can go into the recovery mode and 
reset the password.  BTB, which religion of linux you follow?

No you need worry not. This is general behaviour of
unix like systems. Once a programme exited, the RAM is
flushed only when there is shortage of memory for
something else. That's why you will see that,
generally programmes start quicker second time than
first time.

| How to send attachment through mail in php.  Please explain.
`----

A Mail attachment isn't a seperate entity in Internet mail.  The stock
mail functions in PHP donot have a way of adding attachments as simply
as  passing a filename  parameter!  (I've  heard JSP  has a  rich mail
class where you pass a filename as a parameter).

I'm  giving a  quick howto  on  sending an  attachment.  Before  doing
anything,  send  a mail  with  attachments  to  you@localhost and  cat
/var/spool/mail/you.   Try and  understand how  it is  formatted.  All
Internet  mails have  a  Content-Type header  and  a 'boundary'.   The
boundary specifies the start and end of each section within a mail.

The mail msg will use  the "randomstring" specified in the boundary to
differentiate between various parts of  your mail. For instance a mail
with a short message and a small attachment will be like this:

Mail header:

 Content-Type: <content type>; boundary="randomstring"

Mail Body:

 --randomstring
 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
 Content-Disposition: inline
 
 this is the mail's main message.  this is not an attachment. your MUA
 will display this.
 
 --randomstring
 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
 Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="attachment.txt"
 
 this is the content of the attachment.
 --randomstring--

 
Here,   the   various  portions   of   your   mail   starts  with   a
--<randomstring> and the entire  stuff ends with a --<randomstring>--
(note the trailing '--'s).

To sum up all this, the following PHP code should give a small idea of
how you can implement this:

<?

function random_string($len) {

	 srand((double) microtime() * 1000000);
	 for ($i = 0; $i < $len; $i++) {
	     $ret = $ret . chr (rand (65, 65 + 25));
	 }

	 return $ret;
}

function add_attachment(&$body, $boundary, $attachment_file) {
  
  static $init = false;
  
  $fp = fopen ($attachment_file, 'r');
  $file_data = fread ($fp, filesize ($attachment_file));
  $abs_filename = preg_replace ('/.*\//', '', $attachment_file);
  $buffer = "\r\n" . '--' . $boundary . "\r\n";
  
  $buffer = $buffer . 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii' . "\r\n";
  $buffer = $buffer . 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="' 
    . $abs_filename . '"' 
    . "\r\n\r\n";
  
  $buffer = $buffer . $file_data;
  
  if (!$init) {
    $pre = '--' . $boundary . "\r\n"
      . 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii' . "\r\n"
      . 'Content-Disposition: inline' . "\r\n\r\n";
    $init = true;
  }
  
  $body = $pre . $body . $buffer;
}

function end_attachments(&$body, $boundary) {
  $body = $body . "\r\n" . '--' . $boundary . '--' . "\r\n";
}

function get_header($boundary) {
  return 'Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="' . $boundary . '"';
}

//main

$message = "hi,\nhow are you?\n";

$boundary = random_string(10);
add_attachment($message, $boundary, "/con/con/foo.txt");
add_attachment($message, $boundary, "/con/con/bar.txt");
end_attachments($message, $boundary);
$header = get_header($boundary);
$to = 'suraj@localhost';
$subject = 'attachment test';

mail ($to, $subject, $message, $header);

?>

I would recommend  you to find a full-blown  attachment class first at
phpclasses.org.  What I've given above is just a sample to demonstrate
how to do attachments in PHP.  For sending binary data you may have to
handle a lot more different techniques (base64 encoding, etc.,).  Read
the appropriate RFCs (rfc822, rfc1521,  rfc1522), if you plan to write
your  own ones.  (note that  most of  the code  at  phpclasses.org are
GPLed,  so  it is  illegal  to  misuse  them for  writing  proprietary
applications).

If  I'm not wrong,  I remember  reading this  in Documentation/smp.tex
that the linux  kernel _does_ use HLT to save  power.  For that matter
most "cutting  edge" kernels like  linux, NT's kernel, OS/2,  etc., do
this, it  seems:

There is this interesting package that I found in this regard:

Ravi, watch your tongue.  Abusing folks does not educate them.  Not
everyone is familiar with netiquette.  Many people today do not
understand what the subscriber's responsibilities are on a mailing
list and many are hopeless when it comes to quoting messages.  These
are not dumb people they just don't know whats wrong.  Internet access
is fairly ubiquitous these days but most folks are new to forums and
mailing lists.  Unfortunately there isn't something like an "internet
license" (like a drivers license) which ensures that anyone using it
has a basic idea of the ground rules.  Whats worse is that
knowledgeable people like you abuse them rather than gently guide them
to sites that tell them how to use mailing lists.  For instance ESR's
"How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" is an excellent read:

 http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

I'd recommend anyone who is on a mailing list read it.

I've also been noticing a little too many off topic posts lately.  It
looks like no one reads or remembers the welcome message that is sent
when you subscribe to ilugc.  For instance programming related
questions belong on other lists a few of these on ilugc are okay but
this list was started as a FLOSS help list.  So here are the list
guidelines again.

  1. Technical queries may be posted to this list but you are likely
  to get a better response on linux-india-help@lists.sourceforge.net.
  More information on that list is available here:
  http://www.linux-india.org

  2. Please avoid flaming on this list.

  3. Please trim your replies and use quoting appropriately.

  4. Many users find HTML posts annoying so please post messages on
  this list in plain text.

  5. Please avoid posts that are not related to Linux and Open Source
  related topics.

  6. When you _have_ to send mail that is off-topic remember to
  prepend an [OT] or [Off-topic] tag to the subject.  Similarly if the
  mail involves something commercial please prepend a [Commerial] tag.


Come to think of it I think item 1 is a little too old and does not
hold anymore.  ILUGC is huge with more than 700 subscribers.  Many are
subscribed with nomail but its clear that we are a large group.  I
think technical questions on FLOSS related stuff is OK for the list
but dont push your luck with off topic queries.

cheers,
prabhu

Subject: [Ilugc] Grub -peculiar problem
Message-ID: <007e01c2a72b$43925110$5f0110ac@kovaiteam.com>

Hello all,
I am facing a peculiar problem with grub. I have two ide disks. hda-40gb and
hdc-3gb. Linux is installed in hda and winnt is installed in hdc.

This is my grub.conf or menu.lst.
----------------------------------------------
boot=/dev/hda
default=0
timeout=10
title Linux-Rh8.0
        root (hd0,0)
        kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-14 ro root=LABEL=/
        initrd /boot/initrd-2.4.18-14.img

title WinNT
        root (hd1,0)
        map (hd0,0) (hd1,0)
        map (hd1,0) (hd0,0)
        rootnoverify (hd0,0)
        makeactive
        chainloader +1
-------------------------------------------------------------

When I load WinNT  I get the folowing error for the first time.
-------------------------------------------------------------
        root(hd1,0)
        Filesystem type unknown, partition type 0x7

        map (hd0,0)(hd1,0)
        map (hd1,0)(hd0,0)
        rootnotify (hd0,0)

        Error 13: Invalid or unsupported executable format
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 Then I go into edit mode and delete the entries
        map (hd0,0) (hd1,0)
        map (hd1,0) (hd0,0)
        rootnoverify (hd0,0)
and then it boots.

So all the time I need to do the following 3 steps to boot WinNT.
1. load the winnt     (it will give error)
2. go back and delete the 3 entries.
3. then issue boot command

The point to note is, the system is not booting in NT if I leave the step 1
and go directly to step 2.
Is it a bug in grub? Or am I doing something wrong.

Please share your ideas.

hi,
Is there way to back-up the permissions and owenership of files under a

I want to know if simillar tools are already availble or I need to write my

	7. Wrap your lines at 72 chars.

	8. Do not cross post.

	9. _Try_ to use grammatically correct sentences. Speling not

Try using ACPI if possible. ACPI support is still incomplete in the
2.4.x kernels (and the 2.5.x kernels too), so you will need to plenty of
patience. The temperature sensors work fine, but features like
standby/hibernation are mostly broken.

I have a Transmeta Crusoe based notebook that runs 2.4.19 + acpi patches
and can display CPU temperature -

rsubr@igloo:~$ cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature 
temperature:             50 C

You can drop the CPU temperature by slowing it down and reducing the
voltage. The "longrun" feature of the Crusoe can automatically regulate
CPU frequency and voltage to match CPU load. If the CPU get's too hot,
it can also be forced to operate slower.

Intel's "SpeedStep" and AMD's "PowerNow" enabled CPUs allow limited
frequency regulation.  But I don't know if you can do this without a
reboot, etc.

In any case, ACPI is the way to go.

What relevance does a reply like  yours to a technical question on the
grounds of PHP  have here? How is S.Balasubramanian  or Suraj Kumar or
ILUGC itself going to care about Altosys' Rs.2500 crores?

Please send commercial information  with a '[commercial]' tag attached
to  the  subject line.   Sending  irrelevant  replies is  _absolutely_
senseless.  It  makes us feel disappointed  to see HR  ppl follow such
poor netiquettes.

I wish you understood  that this is a -technical-support-only- mailing
list  for both  free  and non-free  software  and not  a job  resource
center.  There have been people who have sent ADVTs for job offerings,
non-free  software,  etc., but  all  with  a  decent 'commercial'  tag
attached  (and thats  well  within ILUGC's  policy).   Please try  and
follow that.

Hi BGa,

    One commercial product called Enterprise Replication Server,
http://www.erserver.com/,  provides Replication feature for PostgreSQL.

Till sometime back they were offering free downloads but now they have
started charging substantially :(

Hi,

     Free memory is wasted memory!  Linux dynamically allocates free memory
to serve as vaious I/O buffers to speed up I/O operations. The buffers
automatically shrink when more memory is required to run applications.

Moinak.

If ILUGC  is to talk  only about FLOSS,  maybe ILUGC could ask  ppl to
post with a '[non-free]' tag attached  to its subject when ppl talk of
non-free  software in  this  mailing list?   That  would atleast  keep
people informed  that stuff  such as Oracle  on GNU/Linux is  not Free
Software.  If a  member posts a query /  reply about non-free software
with an  appropriate '[non-free]'  tag, Free Software  enthusiasts can
continue  ignoring mails  with  a '[non-free]'  tag.   

ILUGC need  not care  explaining what the  'Free' in Free  Software is
about,  but could atleast  prevent confusion  by asking  ppl to  use a
'non-free' tag.  Many  think that stuff such as  Opera on GNU/Linux is
Free Software  and I  swear it takes  a lot  of effort from  a totally
different angle  to understand  the free (as  in freedom) nature  of a
given software.   Many donot have  the time/patience to figure  it out
and continue calling such non-free  software as Free Software and keep
the confusion spreading.

It depends on  how ILUGC defines 'free'.  If ILUGC  goes by the saying
"Freedom defined is Freedom  denied" will GPLed software be considered
free by  ILUGC? because GPL _does_  put a few  restrictions to protect
the freedom and as a result removes certain lesser important freedoms.
(as  a consequence  iLugc itself  can't exist  because even  the linux
kernel is  GPLed!  hehe...  and if  my suggestion to  add a 'non-free'
tag  is approved  by Prabhu  (or bharathi  too?),  literally everybody
posting to this list will have to use a non-free tag!)

FYI,

------------------Start of Mail-----------------------------
We have localized OpenOffice.org on Windows and Linux in Tamil, with about
98% translation completed. (The rest will be completed within a week)

On Windows, support for editing and complex text layout operations along
with Tamil locale data containing Currency and Calendar translations have
also been enabled.
Some of the screenshots have been uploaded on our website
	http://www.ncb.ernet.in/bharateeyaoo

Work on enabling editing support and Tamil locale data on Linux OO is
going on.

We are currently using the font "Latha.ttf" available in the MS Office
language pack for our localization and internationalization work. Since
"Latha" on Linux gives some errors during combination, we would like to
have inputs on better OpenType fonts for Tamil.

Any feedback/comments/suggestions on our work are also welcome.

Thank you and Best Regards,

ILUGC is around to talk about _linux_ IMHO.  Free, Non-Free, Proprietary
drivers, FLOSS, whatever.

About the only tagging that is needed is stuff like [Commercial] and

Hi!!

I have a problem wherein the X server does not seem to load although the
same was working sometime for nearly 2 months.
When I give startx, it starts up but throws an error with the CUI coming
back
When I give xinit, the x server starts with minimal outpt with a term
view.Here when we try opening GUI based applications like gedit or gnotepad,
it seems to open up, but the panes at the bottom are missing.

The GUI .profile for Gnome is fine and does not seem to have a problem

The system is having Linux RH ver 7.2 with 256 MB RAM and 40 GB HDD

Can any of u suggest a remedy...

Welcome to this wonderful world of GNU/Linux and Free Software! We are
here to  help people who utter  'what the heck?' when  they hear about
partitioning and swap spaces and -what-not-buzz- words. :)

Before science, a bit of history...

the popular OS that you find everywhere and called as 'Linux' actually
fits  itself into  a project  called the  'GNU (GNUs  Not  Unix)'. GNU
started in  1984 to provide  a completely free operating  system.  The
free here  refers to the Freedom  that it gives (freedom  to study the
source code, modify it and share it) and not the 'free-of-cost'ness.

in 1991, Linus Torvalds wrote a kernel named 'Linux'. GNU at that time
did not  have a  functional kernel  and hence GNU  and Linux  was used
together to become a  fully usable Operating System named 'GNU/Linux'.
GNU     also    has     its    own     kernel    named     the    HURD
(http://gnu.org/software/hurd/) which is based  on a much more complex
and extensible 'microkernel' approach.

Now for your questions:

Partitioning is done with tools  like fdisk, cfdisk, etc.,. There is a
wonderful partitioning tutorial at:

http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/tutorials/3174/6/

Most  GNU/Linux distributions  have an  installation guide  (some even
have nice screenshots!). explore your installation CDROM :)

Network  card configuration is  generally in  two parts...  1. telling
your kernel  what driver  drives your network  card. 2. setting  up IP
Address, routing information, etc.,.

There are  wonderful (no I'm not  telling lies.. ;) )  man pages which
explain  these:   

 modules.conf(5) -  modules configuration files  (also as conf.modules
 in some GNU/Linux distributions)
 modules(5) - file  containing the list of modules  to load at startup
 (only on debian?)
 lsmod(8) - list the current loaded modules
 insmod(8) - insert a specified module
 modprobe(8) - insert a module and all its dependencies
 ifconfig(8) - configure your network card's IP Address, etc.,.

I agree with Suresh.
Free and open-source software is very important., but the rest of it is
also important.

Subject: [Ilugc] Indian Language support under Linux / X
Message-ID: <200212192037.CAA13471@hd2.dot.net.in>

Hello,

	I have been looking at various resources on the web for Indian Language 
support (fonts, keyboards and applications), but each seems to be pulling in 
different direction. Even ISCII and Unicode seem to disagree *sigh*. 

	I would like to see multilingual Indian language support under X / Linux and 
am willing to devote some resources to these.. if there are some standards 
that can be followed that would be helpful. Also, if the people on the list 
who seem to have managed Tamil support could provide pointers I would be 
grateful. 

regards
BGa

Mandrake 9 provides fairly decent tamil support (if a touch too literate
for my poor knowledge of tamil ... the tamil used there sounds very
textbookish / over-literate).

You get yourself a decent keymap for tamil and star office for tamil
(which someone posted to LIH yesterday) and you have a reasonably good
package.

I dont remember the context but a few years back, one of my friends, who is
not Indian, asked me, but why does Indian media pay so much attention to it?
By paying attention, you have given them the publicity, they desired. 
About 8 months back, in ILUGC mailing list, I had mailed(after reading
40+(by a very conservative guess) mails on asking a new joinee not to waste
precious bandwidth for some reason(again my poor memory fails me.) )  asking
people how much band-width we have wasted by sending back and forth so many
mails. I know perhaps what I am writing wont make much sense, but we can do
better by ignoring such mails in the future. Ofcourse its individuals
choice.
 
Thanks,
Anoop.

I agree with Suresh. 
Free and open-source software is very important., but the rest of it is also
important.

ILUGC is around to talk about _linux_ IMHO.  Free, Non-Free, Proprietary 
drivers, FLOSS, whatever. 


About the only tagging that is needed is stuff like [Commercial] and

Hi,
I think it is better to use the write() call than the send() with TCP 
sockets, especially when you are sending structures. Invoke as
write(sockDescptr,(char*)&structure,sizeof(structure));

read about the mysql API. its very simple...

you create a connection with the server with mysql_connect() and then  issue 
commands using mysql_query() and retrieve the rows using mysql_fetch_rows() 
function. use the manual that you got with the mysql distribution.

example source code for clients can also be found under the base dir of your 
mysql source direvtory.

  Thanks Suraj :)
  Our patch for GNU/Linux Kernel 2.2.17 (old :) )is presently
  available in the above.

  Similarly Solutions for X-Window is also available.
  
  Both soluction are NOT depend any Encoding and Font solution. i.e
  User can use any type of encoding (ISCII, Unicode, TSCII,...) and
  any fonts.

  Presently I am @ International Conference On NLP 2002 in Mumbai.
  So I sent more info after I reach CNI. Now Pl visit for Site.

The src.rpm that mandrake releases, where else?

Only thing is that you would have to download it off one of the mandrake
ftp / http mirrors.

I took a look at the site, and it is an answer to the problem, but I 
wouldn't think of it as a /solution/. IMHO, a solution must be based on 
standards, which will make it implementable (are the patches accepted into 
the X tree? kernel tree?). 

At some stage we need to have a standard for Indian languages, and adhere to 
it. There must be some convergence on this, say encodings for instance. Which 
might be right forum to bring this up? I know that the DOE has set ISCII as 
its standard, and I think it is the right direction to proceed in. Opinions?

best regards
BGa

<DIV>Hallo,</DIV>
<DIV>I have tried printing pages in Abiword, Gnumeric for columns greater than 80 and it works fine. Absolutely i had made no changes to the printer settings except that i had to change the paper settings (page size) for printing. If dosemu is independant of printer settings, but what is the default paper size (like US legal, US letter, 8 x 10 , 8 x 12 etc.,)?. I tried typing some junk in the dosemu editor and went to printer setup, where i saw the maximum column setting can no more be increased beyond 80. When i took the printout, i got the exact junk for 80 columns only and the rest of the junk being left without being printed. In all other applications that i had mentioned above like Abiword, Gnumeric etc., has printer settings field, where i can select the paper size. Where to modify the page setup in dosemu.conf, by doing this the 136 column printing problem would be solved. </DIV>

o GNU/LINUX UTILITIES FOR EDUCATION... GLUE: Ajith Kumar
<ajith@nsc.ernet.in> deserves credit for his work on this front. Recently,
Ajith announced that his product -- the "GNU Linux Utilities for Education"
CD is now hosted at "ftp.seul.org". This is a bootable CD that will install
a GNU/Linux system with OpenOffice, several educational software packages
and the Terminal Server Software "within 10 minutes", as he puts it.  Ajith
needs help in testing. You can download the ISO image from
ftp://ftp.seul.org/pub/glue/ Bowse the contents of it at
ftp://ftp.seul.org/pub/glue/GLUE/index.html

Recently, Ajith was demoing the CD to the Press. Says he: "It takes only 10
minutes to setup the lab. Method is extreamly simple. Create a RedHat (or
any other) installation and all other required software. Make a tarball of
it. A bootable CD with a small script plants it to another computer. "Kudzu"
does a good job in detecting new hardware." Free Software campaigners in the
Southern State of Kerala are convinced that the local government is "wasting
their money" if they sign a MoU (memorandum of understanding) for costly
proprietorial software to be implemented in their IT@School Project.

o MAKING FREE SOFTWARE/OPEN SOURCE A 'HOUSEHOLD NAME': Abhishek
<efylinux1@electronicsforu.com> of ElectronicsForYou magazine writes in to
announce the planned launch of a new Indian mag, devoted entirely to Free
Software and Open Source. Some key facts, as promised by this publishing
group, are as follows. Launch date: mid January 2003. Pages: 100 plus. Cover
price: Rs 50, or about US$1 (including a CD).

	This mag is likely to be called 'Linux For You'. It is being
	published by the same group that brings out 'Electronics For You'
	and the 'i.t.' magazines. Ideas, suggestions, doubts and inputs
	for editorial content invited. 

o LINUX-INDIA GENERAL: This is the list which still is working to play the
role of networking different Free/Libre and Open Source Software initiatives
across India. See the Linux-India General list at
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linux-india-general

o LITTLE LEAGUE: The idea is to help smaller LUGs around India to network
and share resources and ideas to grow and survive. If you belong to this
category, contact Sukrit D of Pondicherry <sd_root@yahoo.com>. There's also
an offer to help you get inexpensive (maybe even zero-cost) CDs of useful
distros... provided you undertake to share the same widely in your area.

	o BELGAUM LUG: Belgaum is a city of c. 300,000 in North Karnataka
	and home to one of the youngest GNU/Linux user groups in India.
	This was recently launched with most members being students of
	the Gogte College of Engineering there. If you'd like to get in
	touch contact Ashutosh Naik <a7ash@yahoo.com> and Rohan
	Kangralkar <rohankangralkar@hotmail.com>. See also their list at
	http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ilug-belgaum All the best to them.

o LINKING STUDENTS, PROJECTS, MENTORS: Mumbai/Bombay-based Trevor Warren
<trevorwarren@yahoo.com> or <trevor.w@media.mit.edu>, while still in his
early twenties, has come up with this idea of a Project Resource Centre. The
goal? To link students wanting socially-useful and challenging projects with
techies willing to play the role of mentors. Any volunteers?

Says Warren: "As of now...we are looking forwards to having a decent site
dissimanating information to the FSF/OS community on the following aspects.
--> What is the objective of the PRC. --> List of projects for (students) to
take up --> List of mentors with their skill sets (based on a Wiki-like
tool) --> List of projects students/community wants to propose --> Section
for commercial projects that the industry wants to offer --> Collabration
tool for all.

	Tripta <tripta@sarai.net> from Delhi, another young lady behind
	a lot of interesting work, volunteered to list some of the people
	who have already signed up at the PRC as mentors, some possible
	projects, and who's coming forward to work on the same.

Subject: [Ilugc] [Off-Topic] Free Software Consortium in search of Consultants and Agents in your area.
Message-ID: <E18PunO-00019j-00@barrier.vosn.net>

We would like to invite you to be a founding members of the FSC either as a
Consultant and/or an Agent.

http://www.fsconsortium.com

On the main page you will find links to subscribe as consultant and/or agent.

Free Software Consortium is a multinational consortium established to link the
companies and the independent consultants that use and promote free software.

One of the bigger obstacles to the development of the free software services
market is the fear of many companies to establish contracts with independent
consultants who do not have support of a well known Company, Corporation or
Consortium.  Questioning quality, support, experience and capability to
successfully complete a project are the companies manager's main concerns when
considering the option of migrating their systems to free software.

Like you, we know the excellent quality that Free Software offers.
We have complete confidence that Free Software is going to be the platform of
the future. That is why it's so important to work and consolidate together to
solve the problem mentioned above.

Free Software Consortium intends to fill this void joining the best free
software companies and consultants at the national and international level.

By joining to Free Software Consortium you or your company will have the
following benefits:

1. Possibility of being hired by other Consortium members.
2. Possibility of hiring other Consortium members.
3. Use of the Consortium image and name with your clients.
4. Use of the Consortium's resources like Publicity Brochures, Business Cards,
Banners for presentations and events, financial presentations, publicity
articles for the press and magazines, support via mailing list and forums with
the Consortium's members, marketing and communication assistance, CD's and
manuals from the Consortium, site and mail hosting (yourarea.fsc.cc) and other
future services.
5. Representation of the FS Consortium in your area to share administrative,
legal and marketing resources between the Consultant members in your area.

Free Software Consortium will establish a contract with an Agent company which
will have exclusive representation in it's area, in charge of organizing the
consultants in the area.  This Agent company will provide the administrative
services, marketing and sales with the local customers.

>From the business generated by the Free Software Consortium, the Agent company
will receive 20% of the value of the contract, and the Consultant or 
Consulting
company will receive 80%.

The Free Software Consortium is developing a new business model and invites 
you
to join as a founding member and contribute in developing this new business
model.  We need your valuable help to give us ideas and comments. Please write
to info@fsconsortium.com


Thank you for your attention.

h

in general, it is a bad idea to deny users write access to tmp directory.
it is temporary space, right? if you are concerned about disk usage, put
quotas. if you dont want quotas, but simply want tmp not to have junk,
use the tmpwatch facility. redhat 8 has a reasonably configured tmpwatch,
tweak it as needed. if you really dont want to do these but want users
to work with x, create an orbit-foo directory for each user foo. this
directory should be owned by user foo who should have rwx permits to it
(700 will work fine). x will work fine for users after this. it is also
possible to reconfig so orbit will use the users' home directory instead
of /tmp.

BlankDear all

I am having RH 8 in my system. Mozilla Web browser was working fine till
yesterday.
Now when I click the browser icon in the panel the mozilla screen just
flashes and disappear. I have not made any changes and it is working fine
when I login as root. I have no idea why it is not working now.   Will the
problem solve if I remove and reinstall the mozilla alone?

Hi

In my box I have installed RH 8 in a 5GB partition alongwith WinXP dual
booting with Grub. In another 5GB partition I would like to install MDK9.
How to share the swap  in thr RH 8 partition while installing MDK9 in expert
mode? Any tutorial or howto available about sharing swap among two distros?

My current partition table is below:

Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1   *         1      1216   9767488+   c  Win95 FAT32 (LBA)

Your profile might be the reason. Dont exactly remember where mozilla
stores the user profile.

Might be ~/.mozilla

Delete it:
rm -rf ~/.mozilla
(if its this folder)

You may want to see whats inside (maybe your bookmarks ?)

Hi Venki, 
U can log into the single user mode and make the system "rw" and change the password.

If u are using GRUB.just when the GRUB displays the lists of Kernels @bootup,just press 'e' ,this will take u to the restricted version of the shell.GRUB showing a command..
It will be something like //"GRUB>kernel....

At the end of the command add 'init=/bin/sh" and then enter

and then continue with the loading of the System..
It will take u to the 
# prompt..where the system is read only..

U can change the password of the root..from here...after making rw 

ASFAIK,this works for me.

Gurus,Correct me if this does not work...

Thanks 
Giridharan

hi,
   even i faced with similar problem...jus boot in
single user mode by giving 'linux single' at the
prompt where u choose between linux or win os.....open
up the file /etc/shadow....in the entry for root
delete the encrypted msg between first two
colons...then at the prompt give init 3(console
booting) or init 5 (x windows)....u can get inside jus
specifying the username(root) and need not specify the
pswd....then assign a pswd for root.

hope this workd out.

The OP  knows what the system  is called as.   You do not even  have a
clue and should read this http://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html

The  later  distros of  GNU/Linux,  particularly  a former  brain-dead
Redhat has woken up.  You may  not get shell access in `linux single'.
So what do you do ?

Mount root  partition and cd  to /etc.  Load  nano or vi and  open the
file `passwd'.  It will look like this

root:nTrVnuRFhSbGg:12022:0:99999:7:::
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Null the highlighted characters alone, be careful.  Save the file and
reboot.  Just pressing the `Enter' key would let you in as root.  Fix
the password by doing `passwd'.

If you have  enabled shadow password, the file  to edit is /etc/shadow

boot into your system by typing
#linux 1
at the boot prompt
you will be landing at the root prompt.
#passwd -d root
now give
init <runlevel>


Happy Hacking

hi
 u can use testdisk to salvage lost partition tables.
It is available for dos as well as linux (I have it on
my windows rescue boot floppy). It is pretty good. As
usual, do a google search.

Just another way to change the root passwd.

I am not sure whether you will be able to do "linux
single" in RH Gnu/Linux to boot in single user mode
(It has failed for me). If you have rescue floppy,
boot from it and edit /etc/passwd file.

Edit the second column marked "x" and remove it. Then
reboot the system and when you get the login prompt,
type "root" and you will get the shell prompt. Then
change the root password using 'passwd' command.

Regards,
Guru Prasad.

Message-ID: <000b01c2aa9a$5bfba860$9ca841db@k>

Hi Listers,

I am an RH user. Fed up with the lot of bloatware
RH is installing, installed Slackware 8.1 in a P I 200
MHZ 64 MB RAM PC today (the old h/w is also one of
the reason I did not go for RH).
After finishing my work in Slack, I was unable to
shutdown or reboot the PC. Only as root I was able to 
do that. In RH , I have to simply type"halt -p" or "reboot",
in a terminal and I am done. Is it the way Slack operates
 or am I missing something? Pl help

Hello,

	Select the country East Europe and reception as PAL. You can use
'zapping' instead of xawtv which is very flexible. The best feature I
like in zapping is that you can tune channels which belong to different
countries (i.e i can also have channels which come under the US or
Japan). This isn't possible in xawtv since you'll be stuck with one
country setting. Alternatively you can also try kwintv which has similar
feature sets and also has an option to tune the channels manually.

Hi
Can you detail me the steps you took
to make it work?
I installed RH7.1(PCQ) in my friend's PC
which had a motorola SM56 winmodem.
I setup sm56rpm and did the rest, but could not
make the modem work even after so much struggle.
Can you list out what were the specific steps?(like
device pointing to which port? or which irq setting
was used , things like that).
Thanks in advance

hello all,


I am posting this mail not just as an ilugc member but also in the capacity of the general secretary of the Association Of Computer Engineers of Sri venkateshwara College Of Engineering, Sriperumbudur.As part of the yearly activities of the association , it is customary to organize guest lectures on topics of technical intererst to computer engineers.Being a guest lecture and keeping in mind the time constraint( about an hour or so ) ,i would like to make an open request to experienced proffessionals who are members of ilugc to deliver one of such guest lectures at the college premises. I hate to sound picky , but there are a few things that should be kept in mind 

>> the lec-dem is definitely technical , but not overly so ,so that it caters to the average student.

>> It would be wonderful , if the speaker could also mention of opportunities in the area , as well as projects that are being implemented etc. so as to serve as an inspiration to the young proffessionals.This is especially important as, most of these 3rd year engineers are still groping in the dark regarding their future.

>> S.V.C.E is one of the leading engineering colleges in the city , and its C.S.E department has loads of talent ,therefore , the speaker is guaranteed an intelligent, attentive audience

>> The lec-dem will be held sometime next week , so it will be great if someone can come forward and meet this great opportunity to interact with students on a one-to-one basis , and respond to this mail along with a few necessary details etc. like what the lecture will be about , and when you can be free to deliver it etc. to my personal e-mail i.d.
Lot's of leading members from the industry have spoken at the college and i thought that the moment is right to infuse a more pragmatic approach to this entire lec-dem approach by calling someone who actually codes and the students might be able to relate to.I hope that , a few of you will defintely come forward and avail of this opportunity to deliver a lecture at S.V.C.E

you should create a filesystem using mkfs. The command shall be as follows.
# mkfs /dev/hdb (if its connect as secondary master)
After that edit /etc/fstab
/dev/hdb /home2 ext2 defults 0 0 ( I am not sure about the numbers after
default)
Else you can use a 'mount /dev/hdb /home2' for time-being/

sathish posts :

>> when i am fdisk adding new partition  , i am not able to mount that
>> partition

First partition  the new HDD  using fdisk, then format  the partitions
using mke2fs.  Read `man mke2fs' and `man fdisk'.


>> /dev/hdb	/home2		ext2		defaults	  1 1
        ^^^

You can  only mount partitions within  a HDD.  You  have not specified
which partition, just mentioning the drive is not enough.

Instead of hdb, use hdb1 or hdb2 or whatever.....


>> this was  the line  i added in  fstab the  message i am  getting is
>> invalid file system.

Sure you would.  Mention the slice number instead of the drive alone.

Maybe "localhost" is not in the locals file?

So try MAILTO=user@your-domain.com

Looks like ur trying to correlate traditional unix kernel with linux
kernel architecture. Traditional unix has uarea and proc as separate
entities. Linux doesn't.  In linux both the uarea and proc are clubbed
together in the task_struct structure. Instead of u.field, u can access
the fields of interest as current->field. This is different from the
"CURRENT" macro in block device driver code. Now dont ask me where the
pregion and address space structures are! Just follow ur instincts while u 
browse the code and have some linux kernel book handy.

Try this -

#!/bin/sh
if [ "$1" = "off" ]; then
        echo -e "\33[11;0]"
        echo "Bell turned off."
fi

if [ "$1" = "on" ]; then
        echo -e "\33[10;750]\33[11;250]"
        echo "Bell turned on."
fi

if [ "$1" = "" ]; then
        echo "Usage: $0 <on|off>"

 /dev/hdb	/home2		ext2		defaults	  1 1

the fifth and sixth fields are dump and fsck, if the
fifth field is 
zero, the file system will not be dumped, sixth field
is used to determine the order of the filesystem check
(fsck) at reboot time, usually for root filesystem the
sixth field is 1 for others 2, if it is 0 the
filesystem will not be checked.

   see $man fstab     for more details

you can use (without the quotes) "whereis ibgdbm.so" to locate it. Then 
export that path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (look up google)

whereis, which, and apropos are three /very/ handy commands

Message-ID: <200212262318.34980.mvikyk@yahoo.co.uk>

Hi,

I have installed Mdk 9 in many systems.  Some of the systems with 845/850 
chipset motherboards cause display problems.  After installtion, when I give 
the command $startx, the X doesn't start, instead gives error message - 
"Screen not found".  I have tried RH8.0/SuSe 8, hoping for a solution.  But, 
they too don't help.  I don't find any new version in www.xfree86.org.

Kindly help me/them.

Not really. You can create a filesystem (and mount it) on *any* block
device. You can certainly use the entire disk (eg. /dev/hdb) to create a
filesystem and not bother with partitions.

However, this approach is not recommended as some disk
partitioning/diagnostic programs may think that it is an uninitialised
disk and create a new partition table.

This could cause much headache as it overwrites the first few critical
blocks of the filesystem. It's far safer to partition first, and then
create filesystems.

These are the instructions that resulted from my googling

1. Install RealPlayer
2. Copy rpnp.so to your Mozilla Plugins directory
If you installed the RealPlayer 8.0 RPM, this file will be in 
/usr/lib/RealPlayer8

Hi,

Intel 845 Chipset family is supported in the XFree86 3.0 and above that too
in CVS only. The official release for the same is yet happen. Try
downloading the Source and re-compiling. You can use the 845 Chipset by
configuring the Video Card to VESA along with the Motherboard BIOS setting
of Video Memory changed to 8 MB from the default 1 MB.

Hope this helps.

Thanx

Hi ,

   We have planned to set up a deb mirror site. So, i was on the deb site
recently.  And u know guys there was a beaming smile on my face while i was 
seeing iit featuring on the deb mirror list. But a bit unhappy that we have
only one deb mirror in india.

   Currently we have planned to be a private mirror, but i will speak with
my people to get it featured in the deb mirror list.

   I have done some homework on this, and i hope people would go through 
it and respond with their suggestions.

* Space allocated 2.0 GB
* Mirroring only i386 binary packages.
* Gona to use rsync, as it seems to be the widely used one.

   Now i havn't evaluated the best mirror server, from where i could mirror.
So, if you guys have any tool to evaulate the best mirror, please let
me know.

   And i do have the deb woody 3.0 cds, so i think i could copy the
binaries from that, and start mirroring. Instead of starting from scratch.

That's it.

TIA.
Bye and take care.
uday.

No need to re-compile postgresql. Rather you can do any one of the 
following.

a. Re-compile php with '--with-pgsql' option while configuring 
b. Have pgsql.so as dynamic loadable library. It can be done by
uncommenting the below line in /etc/php.ini

;extension=pgsql.so

even with i386 binaries only, i dont believe 2gb will be adequate. the 
iitm mirror includes sources and binaries for i386 only and it is 26gb. 
daily update traffic is around 150-200 megabytes (100mb or so min, max 
around 400mb). because of the directory structures used, it would be 
madness to try anything other than rsync. the debian site has a sample 
script which you can tune appropriately. you can use the netselect program 
to find the 'fastest' site for you. we used to do from planetmirror in 
australia but lately, that site has become too slow. australia is a good 
bet since cron job run late at night ist are early morning in australia 
but peak time in europe and usa - but that logic is not holding anymore. 
we are mirroring from kernel.org and i am getting anything from 25 - 75 
kilobytes per hour. i doubt if luggies will be interested in more details 
- we can continue the thread in private.

Subject: [ilugc] Indian Language support under GNU\Linux / X
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0212271707160.10497-100000@lantana.iitm.ernet.in>

Hello Mr BGanesh and All,

Here is a short(!?) summary of our IndLinuX Team work:

Today the TeNeT Group (IIT-Madras) is involved in the wide scale
deployment of Internet kiosks across the countryside.  The kiosks
require local language software so that they can be effectively used
by the marginalized literate population of OUR country.

Given the number of Indian languages and different encoding standards
and fonts they use, it was felt that we need to develop Indian
language support that is essentially INDEPENDENT OF ENCODING & FONT.

Further, we felt that this support must be provided at the kernel /
X-Window system levels so that applications that run on top of the
kernel/X-Window system INHERIT the interface.

To this end we provide TWO different solutions under GNU Linux: kernel
based and X-Window based.

> Kernel based solution: 

Indian languages have variable width characters. To support variable
width at the kernel level, a multi-glyph approach is proposed, i.e. a
keystroke may correspond to one or more glyphs. Further, the number of
keystrokes possible on the standard QWERTY keyboard is not sufficient
to represent all characters and character clusters in any given
language.  This results in the problem that a sequences of keys may
correspond to different glyphs (in that a key sequence AB might
correspond to a glyph G1, while a key sequence ABC might correspond to
a different glyph G2). This requires that the system has a memory of
the keystrokes that have been made.  To address this problem a finite
state machine and a set of associated rules was introduced in the
kernel.

> X-Window based solution:  

Two different solutions are supported at the X-Window level, namely,
glyph based and encoding based.  In the first approach, similar to
that of the kernel, the parsing is done on the input side, while
glyphs are produced on the output side (file/display).  In this
approach, clearly the system is tied to the font that is used.  To
overcome this problem, an encoding based solution has also been
provided.  The problem with this approach is in cursor positioning.  
The position of the cursor is maintained by the application which
interacts with X to obtain the widths of characters.  The cursor is
positioned based on the keys typed (no memory/context sensitivity is
assumed). We are yet to address this problem.  We do feel that the
only solution available to us is to provide a set of cursor APIs in X
which can be used by any application.

In either solution, the language dependent information is provided in
parse rule tables.  This information is loaded at runtime.  This
ensures that changing the local language environment is SIMPLY a
question of manipulating parse rule tables.

> Applications:  

The solutions that we have provided enable a user to type in a local
language in most applications (Open Office/ KOffice/gcc...).  We have
further customized some of the applications (menus/errors in local
languages), namely, KOffice, Konqueror, gcc, pine, emacs.  We are
currently working on customising Open Office. We are also working on a
convertor which converts indian language documents from fonts to
encoding, fonts to fonts, encoding to font and it can also do
translitration across indian languages

> Current Support:

 Tamil (Glyph-based) - TamilNet99, Inscript
 Hindi (Glyph-based) - Inscript

 Tamil (Encoding-based) - ISCII
 Hindi (Encoding-based) - ISCII

The above supports are complete (This simply means that we have
populated the appropriate language dependent parse rule files). We are
currently working on Malayalam, Oriya, Marathi and Gujarathi.

> Major Bugs

  o Cursor position problem
  o Few Memory leakages

> Future Plans:

This work is part of a MAJOR PLAN to develop a MULTI-MODAL interface
to the computer.  By MULTI-MODAL, we mean, handwriting, keyboard and
speech interfaces.  We have started work on both handwriting and
speech.  We have developed a handwriting interface for Tamil and have
developed speech technology software for: Speech synthesis in Tamil,
Hindi, Telugu and Malayalam (Malayalam database was obtained from
ISDL, Trivandrum). Spoken language Identification, Syllable-based
recognition of continuous speech, Speaker identification.

Hi,

	I have added a bit more details (comments) to srs' script.

#---------------------- Script Begins -------------------#
#!/bin/sh
if [ "$1" = "off" ]; then
        echo -e "\33[11;0]"
        echo "Bell turned off."
fi

if [ "$1" = "on" ]; then
        echo -e "\33[10;750]\33[11;250]"
        echo "Bell turned on."

# The escape sequence \33[10;f] sets the frequency to f.

# And \33[11;d] sets the duration for which the speaker 
# generates the frequency f upon every beep to d.


fi

if [ "$1" = "" ]; then
        echo "Usage: $0 <on|off>"
fi
#---------------------- END of Script -------------------#

Hi,

	You may not always land up at the root prompt!

	By default GNU/Linux/Debian (let me be safe) systems start up 
slogin and not bash. Which means you need root password to boot into 
single user mode.

	If single user mode fails, then you may try using a rescue floppy.
Or an installation CD-Rom (choose rescue mode).

	Well, there's another neat way to do it by using the other kernel 
parameters! Go ahead and read the docs to find out!

GNU/LINUX TO GET A BOOST VIA PUNE: This message is from students at
Pune. We wish them all the best. Contact navhindhanuka at hotmail dot
com: "We the students of 'Symbiosis Institute of Computer Studies and
Research' (SICSR) want to contribute to the GNU project. With this aim in
mind, we are organizing 'GNUnify', with the whole hearted support of the
management of our institute." Set up in 1971, primarily to promote world
understanding between Indian and foreign students through education,
Symbiosis has a strength of over 16,000 students from over 32
countries. Says the institution: "We in Symbiosis believe that the 'World
is one Family'."

The annual fest of SICSR 'Unify', is composed of various cultural, academic
events & contests. This year the institution is adding on GNUnify, as their
own way "of contributing and encouraging the Free Software movement".

See http://www.sicsr.ac.in (to be updated by early Jan 2003)

The aim of GNUnify is to unify and encourage efforts of GNU developers
across the country, by "awarding the best and motivating the rest". Events
will include: 

1. Code-Presentations (open for all)
1.1 App Dev (Web Apps, Biz Apps, Edu Capsules)
1.2 Embedded Linux
1.3 Network Programming
1.4 Kernel Development / Device Drivers

2. Paper-Presentations (open only for students)
2.1 General (Socio-economic aspects of using GNU/Linux, Does GNU/Linux make
sense for India?, and Will China get ahead of India using Free Software?)
2.2 Free Software B-Plan Contest: The major concern of most developers is
that since GNU is free there is little / no money to be earned out it.  To
disprove this a free s/w or gnu based B-plan contest. People submit their
B-plans built around free s/w.
2.3 Technical (how to use Apache, migrating from ASP to PHP, Wirel)
3. Techie-Talks (under planning... if you know of any powerful speakers from
across the country, do suggest)
4. Hands-on Workshops [Under Planning]
5. Install-Fest of GNU/Linux [Debian, Redhat, Slackware, Mandrake, ...]
6. Screenings. [RMS's Public Lecture @ IIT-Mumbai & Linux-The Code Movie] 
Event Dates: 15 & 16 Feb 2003

NEWS FROM KERALA: Arun M <arun at freedevelopers dot net> reports that he
had a recent meet with the general secretary of the KSTA, the trade union of
teachers in the southern Indian state of Kerala. They're planning a meet on
IT education in schools, and want experts to talk about Free Software.

Meanwhile, Kerala's IT@School expert committee met and seems agreeable to
the view that Free Software must be used for the project. Logistical issues
of training, text books, and distribution CDs etc need to be taken up. Help
is needed for rewriting the textbooks, in a way that these don't exclusively
promote proprietorial software.

The Demo@Schools Project: The demo@schools project aims at demoing Free
Softwares to schools and make the schools adopt free softwares as a subject
of education in their syllabus. They also actively involve ourselves in
encouraging children to hack free softwares and learn more. "Schools are
increasingly putting efforts to impart software education to their students.
We are in an attempt to make schools teach free softwares before they become
dependant on non-free softwares," say the Demo@Schools promoters.

STORY FROM INDIA'S NEIGHBOURHOOD: Video Whale Project grew out of the
concept of Umer Anwar Sheikh and was developed by Zeeshan Ali Khattak
(zak147(AT)yahoo.com)

The video-whale project is an implementation of video-wall which exploits
the combined power of Gstreamer (www.gstreamer.net) & Xinerama. Says the
team: "We plan on using these videowalls in Pakistani universties and
schools to let them quickly set up videowalls for use in the classrooms when
need be. Anyone interested in the videowalls on a commercial basis is also
of course welcome to contact us."http://www.gstreamer.net/apps/vw/

SOME FEEDBACK TO GNU/LinuxINDIA NEWSLETTER: 

	From: Arun Sharma <arun@sharma-home.net>
	I understand that you can't fit an ASCII art logo mentioning
	"GNU/Linux India" in 80 columns, and hence had to abbreviate "Linux"
	part a little bit. But given all the controversy about the term
	"GNU/Linux", I find the above logo in bad taste -- it almost seems
	like you're posting about "GNU India", when in fact, the message is
	about what I'd normally call "Linux". I'm sure you could design a
	logo that displays "Linux" more prominently.-Arun

	From amish_munshi@sify.com Fri Dec 27 17:07:26 2002
	Can you change this artwork, it is not readable. I am very bad at

INDIAN-LANGUAGE SOLUTIONS FROM PIONEERS AT IIT-MADRAS: 

Dr Hema A Murthy <hema at lantana dot tenet dot res dot in>, associate
professor at the IIT Madras (Chennai) is one of the two coordinators of the
IndLinux effort, along with Timothy A Gonsalves <tag at tenet dot res dot
in>. You can also contact indlinux at tenet dot res dot in for information.

She recently wrote in to point to some of the shortcomings in an article
written recently. Our apologies for an inadequate representation; we have no
excuse other than the general difficulties in garnering information across
a virtual sub-continent, largely depending on e-mail. 

Says Dr Murthy: "Currently, the TeNeT group is involved in the wide scale
deployment of Internet kiosks across the countryside.  The kiosks require
local language software so that they can be effectively used by the
marginalised literate population of our country."

We are grateful for the explanation below to Dr Murthy:

Given the number of Indian languages and different encoding standards and
fonts they use, it was felt that we need to develop Indian language support
that is essentially independent of encoding and font.  Further, we felt that
this support must be provided at the kernel/X-Window system levels so that
applications that run on top of the kernel/X-Window system inherit the
interface.

To this end we provide two different solutions under linux: kernel based 
and X-Window based. 

Kernel based solution:  Indian languages have variable width characters. To
support variable width at the kernel level, a multiglyph approach is
proposed, i.e. a keystroke may correspond to one or more glyphs. Further,
the number of keystrokes possible on the standard QWERTY keyboard is not
sufficient to represent all characters and character clusters in any given
language.  This results in the problem that a sequences of keys may
correspond to different glyphs (in that a key sequence ab might correspond
to a glyph g1, while a key sequence abc might correspond to a different
glyph g2). This requires that the system has a memory of the keystrokes that
have been made.  To address this problem a finite state machine and a set of
associated rules was introduced in the kernel.

X-Window based solution:  Two different solutions are supported at the
X-Window level, namely, glyph based and encoding based.  In the first
approach, similar to that of the kernel, the parsing is done on the input
side, while glyphs are produced on the output side (file/display).  In this
approach, clearly the system is tied to the font that is used.  To overcome
this problem, an encoding based solution has also been provided.  The
problem with this approach is in cursor positioning.  The position of the
cursor is maintained by the application which interacts with X to obtain the
widths of characters.  The cursor is positioned based on the keys typed (no
memory/context sensitivity is assumed). We are yet to address this problem. 
We do feel that the only solution available to us is to provide a set of
cursor APIs in X which can be used by any application.

In either solution, the language dependent information is provided in parse
rule tables.  This information is loaded at runtime.  This ensures that
changing the local language environment is simply a question of manipulating
parse rule tables.

Applications:  The solutions that we have provided enable a user to type in
a local language in most applications (Open Office/ KOffice/gcc...).  We
have further customised some of the applications (menus/errors in local
languages), namely, KOffice, Konqueror, gcc, pine, emacs.  We are currently
working on customising Open Office. We are also working on a convertor from
fonts to encoding, fonts to fonts, encoding to font.

Current Support:   Tamil  (Glyph-based) - TamilNet99, Inscript
                   Hindi  (Glyph-based) - Inscript

		   Tamil (Encoding-based) - ISCII
		   Hindi (Encoding-based) - ISCII

The above supports are complete. (This simply means that we have populated
the appropriate language dependent parse rule files). We are currently
working on Malayalam, Oriya, Marathi and Gujarathi.

Future Plans: This work is part of a major plan to develop a multimodal
interface to the computer.  By multimodal, we mean, handwriting, keyboard
and speech interfaces.  We have started work on both handwriting and speech. 
We have developed a handwriting interface for Tamil and have developed
speech technology software for: speech synthesis in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and
Malayalam (Malayalam database was obtained from ISDL, Trivandrum); spoken
language identification, syllable-based recognition of continuous speech,
speaker identification. (ENDS)

Udaya posts:

`apt-get install apt-spy'

Downloads from debian.org a list  of current mirrors and tests each of
the mirrors for bandwidth.   Writes a /etc/apt/sources.list file based
on the responses it gets.  (blatant cut & paste job :)

Also install iftop and watch the juice flowing.....

Eg. to update  CD-1 of woody from 3.0r0 to 3.0r1,  read on, repeat for
the other CDs.

Do a  dd and create the  image, mount this  image at /loop by  doing a

`mount -o loop debian-30r0-i386-binary-1_NONUS.iso /loop'
`apt-get install jigdo-file'  

As su,  run `jigdo-lite' from  within the dir  where you have  the iso
image of  CD-1 and care should be  taken to free up  ample space here.
Read    the    docs   at    (http://home.in.tum.de/~atterer/jigdo/).
Articulate your problems, if any, and we shall help.

I've seen specific boot floppies on the Net that help you reset root
password. In case you cannot get it, just download tomsrtbt. It creates
a boot floppy and on boot copies (expands rather) the full filesystems
into ramdisk and operates out of ramdisk. You can then mount your root
partition, edit the /etc/passwd and/or /etc/shadow file, remove the
password and boot. No password will be asked. Change the password then
after boot.

Hi,

	You may not always land up at the root prompt!

	By default GNU/Linux/Debian (let me be safe) systems start up 
slogin and not bash. Which means you need root password to boot into 
single user mode.

	If single user mode fails, then you may try using a rescue
floppy. Or an installation CD-Rom (choose rescue mode).

	Well, there's another neat way to do it by using the other
kernel 
parameters! Go ahead and read the docs to find out!

You want to write a mailserver of your own?  Then read the RFCs, and
stuff about DNS.

Then go through the code of something like exim or postfix - those are
well commented and easy to understand.

That might help you.

Hi,

With reference to the display problems in 845/850 chipset problem posted two 
days ago, I thank Mr. Prabu<prabuanand@softhome.net> for letting me know the 
solution.  I am forwarding his mail, so that it might be useful for the needy 
ones.

His mail reads thus:

**************************************************************************************
"Visit http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/intel845g/linux.htm

Here is the page FYI

Do the Intel Extreme Graphics Drivers Support Linux*? 

Linux* graphics driver availability
 Intel Extreme Graphics drivers for Linux* are not available for download from 
Intel. Linux* drivers for the Intel 82845G graphics controller have been 
released for distribution to interested parties and directly to the XFree86* 
 website. Future releases of most Linux distributions should contain native 
Intel 82845G graphics controller support. For information on the supported 
graphics adapters for your version of XFree86, please check the documentation 
for your version of XFree86 or the documentation for the Linux distribution.

 If your version of Linux does not have native Intel 82845G graphics 
controller support, the VESA driver that comes with XFree86* can be used. To 
use the VESA driver, modify the /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 file and change the 
driver line to:

 
Section "Device"
 ...
 Driver "vesa"
 ...
EndSection
Legacy video memory reserved by the BIOS
 Both the VESA driver and the native graphics driver for Linux use the legacy 
video memory allocated by the BIOS for display. Because of this, it is 
important that the BIOS allocate 8 MB of video memory to allow a full range 
of video mode support. Check your system or motherboard documentation on how 
to determine and possibly adjust the amount of pre-allocated video memory. On 
Intel Desktop Boards, the setting is found in the BIOS setup under Advanced 
> Video Configuration > Frame Buffer Size.

 If your motherboard or laptop is limited to 1MB of legacy video memory and 
does not allow adjustment of this size in the BIOS setup, currently the only 
way to correct the issue is for the motherboard or laptop vendor to release a 
BIOS update. Intel Desktop Boards ship with the BIOS options of 512K, 1MB, or 
8MB for legacy video. At this time, there is no driver available from Intel 
to overcome the legacy VGA memory limitation.

Commercial Linux graphics drivers
A commercial provider of 3D accelerated drivers for Linux is available, but 
these drivers are not free of charge. Xi Graphics* has developed these 
drivers without involvement from Intel and these drivers are only mentioned 
here as a courtesy by Intel as an alternative proposal for interested 
parties. Intel does not support drivers from other vendors, and Intel does 
not warrant and cannot be responsible in any way for the content or operation 
of these drivers. 
XiG 

Additional Linux updates for the chipset
 The following additional, non-graphics related Linux updates are available to 
enable other chipset features: 
Intel 845G chipset family integrated audio 
Intel 845G chipset family ATA DMA support"
***************************************************************************

I followed the above procedure and I got the display up properly.  Still, I 
had to make a few more changes using #xf86config.  Namely, since the 
motherboard (Intel 845 original) took away 32MB of Ram as shared memory, I 
entered video card memory as 32768K, instead of default 8MB. Further, I had 
to enter 'n' explicitly for the question "Do you want to have the screen 
bigger than the physical screen?".   If this is not done, I was able to see 
only 1/4th of the full screen.

I thank everyone for the help offered.

Message-ID: <20021228182626.9594.qmail@web10403.mail.yahoo.com>

Guys,

    i have always wondered how i could make linux
available to the masses. i spoke to fredrick norhona
(ilug Goa) about starting a free CD distribution
system. the idea was good, but it didn't wok out too
well. then i realised that free wasnt necessarily the
way to go. maybe linux could be available to the
masses for very little money. this way I can actually
be available to the masses and not just to an
unfortunate few who can't afford it. and at the same
time I can make some money.

   so i created LinCDz. hosted @ lincdz.2ya.com i hope
this service will help people. i have always priced
the CDs rather low at Rs.30 a CD. and for
organisations who can't afford even this, im willing
to chip in a little myself.

                                           SD.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0212301230120.12188-100000@einstein.india.hp.com>

Has anyone got xawtv working for indian channels? Did it work out of the
box or was some tweaking required. I'd managed to get my Mercury TV tuner
card configured after some struggle, but am unable to view any channels.
There isn't anything wrong with the driver, only the channel's dont show
up. Everything seems to be pointing to the xawtv configuration/tuning.

xawtv claims to be supporting PAL, NTSC & SECAM, doesn't mention much
about PAL-B which I believe is used here. Also there is no frequency chart
for India.

Hope someone has got it working.

	Thanks,
		P.Basker

I have installed RH Linux 8.0 and am using IMAP .
When i try to telnet localhost on port 25 it goes thru ....however when i
try to telnet using ip address of the machine, the connection is refused,
what could be the possible issue.
I am using sendmail as the MTA ..
IMAP is thru in both instances.

The issue is that you have clearly not read either

1. The sendmail faq
2. The redhat release notes
3. /etc/mail/sendmail.mc

before posting here.

Any of these three, especially the last one, should give you your answer
within a minute.

telnet is invoked by xinetd. Access to this is governed by a file telnet in
/etc/xinetd directory where in disabled would be marked yes. Change it to
no. If this still does not work, check the hosts.allow and hosts.deny file
in /etc where IP masks may have been denied.

The issue is not that he is unable to telnet (aka port 23) - where your
advice would be correct.

The issue is that he can do (forget the word telnet, as it seems to
confuse the issue, try, say, netcat) -

$ nc localhost 25

but not

$ nc his.host.name 25

or

$ nc his.public.ip 25

when u switch on xawtv if the system hangs, switch it on with -noxv

Oops missed that one. It is the SMTP IP address listening that needs to be
set. In sendmail.cf the "O DaemonPortOptions=Name=MTA" is by default set to
localhost or 127.0.0.1. Set it to the specific IP or remove 127.0.0.1.

That would leave sendmail listening on your public IP but not on
localhost.

Actually, best not to fiddle with sendmail.cf - just remove the
DAEMON_OPTIONS line pointing to 127.0.0.1 from sendmail.mc and rebuild
sendmail.cf

Hello,

     You can have only one coutry setting in xawtv. Try 'zapping' which enables you to tune channels which belong to different country settings. Also try out 'kwintv' which has option to tune channels manually. 

     xawtv works fine for me (Pinnacle TV Tuner)

Most external modems are _not_ winmodems.

Try anything you like - GVC, Dlink, US Robotics, whatever.

Dear ladies and gentlemen,

                                            First ,I extend my thanks to
Mr.B Ganesh for shedding some light in this problem(mentioned below).As he
recomended to add the required shared library  in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.,I've
also tried it but without any sucess.Then,one website recommended me to try
ldconfig command which they recommended for FreeBSD Linux .They mentioned
that to add a shared library one need to use :"ldconfig -m <the path to
shared library>".But there is no "ldconfig -m" facility in the kernel
(Kernel version:2.4.8,Mandrake Linux 8.1 not as mentioned below).All I have
is"ldconfig -l" command to add libraries individully,which didn't add the
reqired library I wanted.I then used the setenv() function(mentioned in
stdlib.h) to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.Surprisingly,when I wanted to test the
the result by using getenv() function,the result was the particular path was
added to the environment variable(as from the value returned by getenv())
but I am back to the square one.Please suggest me a remedy as the
software(gdbm  in which the problem of shared files) is very imporatnt for
the project.

    Ps:I forgot to mention:I checked it using whereis command and it
mentioned that three files libgdbm.so.2 is installed in /usr/lib/ and
libgdbm.so.3(which is the problematic shared file) and libgdm.so is in
/usr/local/lib/. I've reinstalled the whole package but without much sucess.

Good Morning !
Thankyou for your continuing support on Linux !
well, kindly help me in the following
1) i am booting RH 7.3 only by using floppy disk, now the flopply disk fails
now, how to boot or how to create another booting disk, [ i have all 4 CD's
of RH 7.3 , attempted using "linux rescue " mode, but i do not know how to
make it ]
2) when i was using PCQRH 7.1, the time taken to display the initial login
screen is around 1 min.
but when i moved to RH7.3 on the same system it takes nearly 4 min. why ?
[using 233mmx, 128mb sdram, 4 + 8 hdd,  S3 ViRGE 4mb card ]
3) once i was accidentely booting with old boot disk [ pcq 7.1 ] to boot RH
7.3, it has been accepted and it was booting, How ?

well, few more words [ OT ]
nowadays i am realizing the beauty of  Linux !, such a wonderful OS with
usefull and flexible packages.
it took nearly 2 years for me to understand the beauty of linux. from today
onwards i am moving to 90 % linux and 10% mswindows [ vb and word ] .i thank
all the members of this list for helping me and others by giving a "down to
earth" reply to clarify doubts with suggestions with their selfless
motivation. i can not imagine how much time you spent on machines to
innovate and implement. all your efforts and experiences are coming to us in
a simple way. this is one of the rarest qulity in planet earth. May God
Bless you and your family ! Have a Wonderful New Year and Years to come !

      ^^^^^

Linux is  the kernel and people  mistakenly say that the  OS is Linux.
The system is the GNU/Linux system, can we call an apple an orange ?

There is no such tool to create databases for the kernel Linux per se.
But for the  GNU/Linux system, there are many  `free' tools to create,
administer and design  database schemas.  The choice is  varied in that
you may  get confused  selecting one.  I  have found  Postgresql quite
robust and easy to learn.  Read this link and come to your conclusions
http://www.fokus.gmd.de/linux/HOWTO/PostgreSQL-HOWTO.html

This FAQ on Postgresql is also helpful and extremely readable

  U may be unzip a readonly file or to a read-only file system.
  Check the file permissions.

  For more clear idea read man gzip

I am assuming that the filesystem is ext2 or ext3, and
access is available to  a computer running GNU and
the harddisk can be fitted there

If the dd command was invoked exactly as above, then
only 1440 bytes are lost. The first 512 bytes form the boot
sector. So only (1440 - 512)  928 bytes are lost.
The ext2 filesystem maintains several alternative copies
of the superblock. Run the e2fsck program by specifying
an alternative superblock.

Another solution would be to use dd again. Copy an
alternate superblock to the original superblock.
(Please back up the partition, and read the ext2 filesystem
format before doing this)

I am mailing this to the group so that someone might correct
in case I am wrong.
