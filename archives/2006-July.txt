i use a distro not many use in India. It is called ArchLinux.
It has a small base install which is abt 90 mb once u remove stuff like ppp
and xfs progs form the base. It s i686 optimized and so are all its packages
and it has a great package manager called pacman which  is lightning fast(
written in C). But this distro is highly dependent on a good net connection!
eg. to get xorg and openbox type
# pacman -Sy xorg openbox

Hi!

Is it possible to prevent a file in a CVS tree from being subject to
further updates. I would like to have a local version of those files,
and would not like CVS to try merging or reporting conflicts on those
files.

Regards,
Ramkumar.

I guess, it's not a general practice. CVS is a VC used for distributed
development. Why do you wish to have a file in CVS and prevent it from
updates done by other developers ? If you wish to prevent, it's also
good to have it out of the repository.

for eg:
It may be required when you have some config file which may have the
password of your database. But you want a file which has no password
mentioned to be maintained in the repository. Every user who checks
out may fill in the details according to the development machine he
uses

To hold a file in revision x.x, you can use the following command.

cvs update -r x.x <filename>

Further cvs updates will not modify the file. To get rid of the sticky revision
no. and to move to the head use the following command.

cvs update -A <filename>

Vijay

Dear friends,

Warm greeting,We need a venue to celebrate software freedom day. We will ask
the elcot administration to host the events. We can have Linux Demo Day and
seminars in the elcot campus. If we are going to have a software freedom
walk on the same day, we can have a shorter version of it. If we can start
it from Anna University- Guindy walk down via Kotturpuram and proceed to
ELCOT office at nandanam signal,Chennai.

 We can call this walk as "Guindy March". Remembering The dandi march is
for  getting the freedom for the country against the imperialistic british
regime, Guindy march is to symbolize the freedom of software in the
computing world. If Dandi march is a salt satyagraha , "guindy march" should
symbolize the begining of software satyagraha.

We are running short of time to decide on this, We have to plan, intimate
our college pals to participate in this event. We have to take permission
from Elcot administration,Police dept clearance for walk.We have to intimate
the media friends for publicity, we have to look for sponsor for
T-shirts/Cds if any. Please add your views and lets makes this idea of us
transformed into reality.

Thanking you,

cheers,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Some quotes which makes difference

Where there is no difference, there is only indifference.
Author: Louis Nizer<http://www.worldofquotes.com/author/Louis-Nizer/1/index.html>


Often the *difference* between a successful person and a failure is not one
has better abilities or ideas, but the courage that one has to bet on one's
ideas, to take a calculated risk - and to
act.<http://en.thinkexist.com/quotation/often_the_difference_between_a_successful_person/221910.html>

Never be afraid to do something new. Remember, amateurs built the ark;
professionals built the titanic. -Anon

Two roads diverged in a wood, and I... I took the one less traveled by, and
that has made all the difference. - Robert Frost

You're the only one who can make the difference. Whatever your dream is, go
for it. - Magic Johnson

Yes, I beleive this walk will make a difference.

If at all there is anything that has helped Linux stay despite Microsoft's,
as you say, money power, it is technological superiority, helped by the free
software model. And this continues to be it's best strategy for this
challenge as well...

it moves on...

Hi,
       
    I want to create an autorunning CD in Linux.  That is, my CD will consist of different debian packages, Once I insert the CD it should popup with an installer showing the list of packages available and install them as the user selects them. Its just like a Windows Operating system CD. After we install the OS if we insert the Windows CD, a window will be opened which will allow us to select the pacakges that we need to install. Simillarly for a mother board CD etc..,
 
 
 In Brief: Once we insert the CD it should start the installer. I will take care about the installer..
 
 Any Help Please

good old hardware and easy to use too. Infact Dapper boots much faster than
Breezy or Debian Sarge too. All 3 are equally recommendable for beginners.
Infact Ubuntu Dapper would be at the 1st place, does'nt even give you the
pain of choosing typical packages (assuming you have about 5-6 GB to
allocate for linux.

Vector...everything except I had to manually configure the boot loader from
Ubuntu's GRUB (run a Ubuntu-Vector dual boot). Thats bcos I had booting
problems, even booting Vector from the LILO Vector installed. Windoze booted
without any problems then.

Hi all,

A good friend of mine who is based in B'lore is working on an article
on... "How are educational institutions using Linux and open source to
provide IT infrastructure." The article will also peek into the
advantages they realise, and the problems they face.

She would like to cover the situation from all over the country, and
is looking for inputs from Chennai educational institutions as well.

Should any of you have any information to share, could you please
write to her at kanika<dot>goswami<at>gmail<dot>com

Thanks,

away from PalmOS to Windows Mobile, has seen sales far lower than
expected. Palm will pull the plug and move back to PalmOS (most
probably as an app on an underlying Linux virtualizer) sooner or later.

   There's now a consortium of Japanese manufacturers who want to
standardize a mobile Linux base-platform:

http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS2710208789.html

   Since it includes NTT Docomo, Samsung, Vodafone and consumer
electronics Godzilla Panasonic (aka Matsushita Electric), it should be
M$ that should be seriously worried now. Windows Mobile is more
or less extinct in Smartphones.

OTOH,

The HP iPaq's (and the PocketPC line) have been hugely succesful in
the smartphone area. The Dell Axim x51 is a very good PDA if you have
multimedia needs. Palm OS based Palm LifeDrive is a huge failure.

The O2 XDA line is another good smartphone. Windows Mobile has found
it's way into multimedia players, the Toshiba Gigabeat S is a
excellent example, the UI is better than that of the iPod. HTC has
done wonders with the Mobile OS, the HTC Universal and the HTC Wizard
are great devices.

yes, there is Linux based stuff out there, Archos/iRiver (IIRC) are
huge Linux supporters, but as it stands I see Windows Mobile in the
forefront of PDA/smartphone technology.

In multimedia devices arena, Rockbox is good, but is again not backed
by any commercial vendor.

Maemo looks promising but the reviews of the Nokia 770 have not been
great. There seem to be no future commitments from Nokia on it though.
The GP2X is great again but has failed to pick up due to lack of
thrid-party support.

I'm waiting for gadgets using OpenMAX , but apart from the PS3(which
is huge) nobody else seems to bother about it.

The problem is , the FOSS world has the development environment
problem sorted out it's just that the big-fish are not biting the
bait. Motorola is an exception here, but then again they just want a
free OS which can run Java.

There is going to be a huge gap in the embedded OS space as Symbian
fails to meet requirements, and the way I see it, M$ seems to have
cornered all the players in the field to have a bite of the Windows
Mobile pie.

Well... I would say not so fast. First of all, the king of the mobile 
hill, Nokia has brought out it's own Crackberry-clone. And worst enemy 
of M$ seems to be itself:

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/01/06/microsofts_masterplan_to_screw_phone/
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/11/21/what_sank_sendos_stinker/
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/10/23/were_being_spanked_by_nokia/

and finally this:

http://bink.nu/Article2527.bink

With that track record, any handset maker should be very scared to do 
business with Redmond. Plus, Apple knows very well that after a while, 
people would hate to carry two bricks in their pocket - it's either a 
cellphone or an iPod (you might have observed itunes popping up in 
motorola's phones). So future indeed seems to be interesting ;)

   Windows Mobile has overwhelming market share in PDAs, but not in
Smartphones. The thing to note is that PDAs are a shrinking market, and
cellphones are substituting them.

    PDAs maybe; Smartphones, no. They're almost completely out of the
picture in Smartphones, except for the Treo 700w.

Yes, according to a Nokia insider whom I met, Maemo was a learning
experiment which they're not going to follow up on.

some 1 billion people around the world are so familiar with it that it
cannot be easily substituted. However, a Series 60 port to Linux is
certainly possible, in which case Symbian will whither away and die.

  Windows Mobile will survive in the PDA space, but that's a small
volume niche. There isn't enough revenue in this space to support the
number of companies that are out there - some will have to pull the
plug, including HP and Dell. Only low-end Chinese manufacturers
like HTC and Vtech will survive. That's not the kind of revenue model
that M$ is looking for.

-Siva

P.S. The early Linux handhelds failed commercially, but those were
mainly PDAs. In phones, both the NTT Docomo i-mode units running
Linux as well as Motorola's Java units have sold huge numbers. The
platform standardization news that I posted is huge news, not least
because both Motorola and Docomo are involved.

Check for your modem/driver info in /proc if using 2.4
Linux kernel. In 2.6 Linux kernels, check /sys and
/proc.

unmanaged switches are dirt cheap

genuinely good managed switches are worth every paisa you pay for them, 
especially if you're on the sort of network that'll need managed ones.

poor quality managed switches have this nasty habit of falling over 
under high load, making an entire segment of IPs unreachable etc.

As far as my idea, SANS certificates in security like

Subject: [Ilugc] Scam covered up using technical complexities
Message-ID: <7a7d6df30607050059r4b4f4b91k75fb4b9540974add@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Luggers : (Slightly out of topic )

There is a scam to the tune of Rs 33000 crores of public money. The
defrauders are trying to cover it up by creating a fog of technical
complexities  so that  common men are not able to see it through clearly.

I thought it would be apt to bring the matter to public discussion to a
forum of technical experts.

Request you to kindly go thro the complete detail ( a bit exhaustive ) and
kindly voice your opinion.

some members of the nrc-foss team are keen on doing foss translation

Hi Kenneth,
Any specific FOSS in mind?
If you can specify which softwares they are intrested in translation, I can
provide some pointers and can send some power point presentations.

If you are organising a session for this on a saturday, I will try to travel
to Chennai and participate in the session.

Regards,
Mugunth

nothing specific. we are starting a major effort to get people to  
code applications in foss. So we need in house expertise in  
translation as it will be mandatory that all projects we house be  
localised at the outset (which means that there will be no button  
saying 'tamil' or 'telugu' which will say 'not yet implemented' when  
clicked). This implies that the tools they use should also be  
translated. Candidates would be things like django, pygtk, wxpython,  
various php apps, mediawiki? and the like, along with the  
applications we develop.

Hi Mugunth and Others,
  If you have set of FOSS applications specific for tamil, we can make a
yum repository out of it. We need a machine with say around 500MB space
and a shell account. More than that the machine should run Fedora. 
It is fairly easy to create and maintain yum repositories. May be the
next step can be creating a custom distro. 
  I can give a presentation on the same if needed. 
Thanks

Hi all,

Check this site - http://www.koobox.com/

This is what we lack here. We dont have any such companies selling linux
boxes here rather we wait for IBM,HP/COMPAQ,DELL to start theirs. This is
something which would make people buy and try Linux Systems. We could pack
the top 10 distros and separate them as Development, Entertainment,
Essentials etc.,

further to this, we are thinking of taking up moodle for translation

dont know what you think is exorbitant. unmanaged switches are typically 100 to
150 bucks per port while managed ones run about 1000 to 1500 bucks per port. it
is not just for the management capability that you pay - look at other specs
like max mac address table size etc. like srs has pointed out, cheap managed
switches and most unmanaged switches do funny and bad things under heavy load.

Take the nortel, or one of the cisco catalysts. Expensive but worth it -

Looks like a locale problem here... Please check if you have the
correct locale set and the program ran has support for that locale....

it moves on...

what are the advantages of a managed switch over an unmanaged one?  
Or, rather, why would one need a managed switch?

suppose your switch is sitting in a datacenter a couple of continents 
away?  connected to a big rack of servers, pushing high amounts of 
traffic?  that's when you need managed servers.

Tamil translating efforts are the need of the hour. There are many in lugc
who can contribute to this. Mugunths effort of tamizha.com , VArun's tamil
transliteration gaim plugin are some of the lead pointers. Count me in for
such a innovative effort.

Dear friends,

My friend gave me the fabulous explanation of what is the similarity between
salt satyagraha and software satyagraha.

Dandi March :
The salt march was aimed to send a clearcut message to the ouster of british
regime which enforced taxes for a mineral(salt) which is available free of
cost  in the coastline.

Gundy March:
We, The foss enthusiats convey the need of  FOSS software which is available
at  free of cost, instead of taking a proprietory solution to the common man
of India.

I read the meaning of what satyagraha from

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_March which quotes the words of  Mahatma
as

 *"Truth (Satya) implies Love, and Firmness (Agraha) engenders and therefore
serves as a synonym for force? that is to say, the Force which is born of
Truth and Love or Non-violence? [If] we are Satyagrahis and offer
Satyagraha, believing ourselves to be strong? we grow stronger and stronger
everyday. With our increase in strength, our Satyagraha too becomes more
effective, and we would never be casting about for an opportunity to give it
up."* --Gandhi
Lets give some momentum to this walk programme. members add up your views.


Thanking you,

Sincerely


Thyagarajan Shanmugham

A managed switch is one which has an IP address assigned to itself
through which you can access its console and configure its settings.
You can setup virtual LANs - where the same switch can make it appear
that one set of nodes are on a network different from the other set
(connected to the same switch). For example you can have the nodes of
the accounts dept to be on a separate (virtual) LAN from the rest - so
tools like packet sniffers do not help trouble makers.

IMO, for LANs with upto 100 nodes unmanaged switches would be the
ideal option. When you buy a managed switch you would also have to pay
for a CCNA type to configure it properly for your network and 'manage'
it on a regular basis - what good is a managed switch if there is no
one to manage it!

Folks,

   Go for HP Procurve switches.  Its cheaper than cisco & nortel.  Life 
Time warranty is available.  The IOS/Firmware commands are similar to 
cisco,  hence pretty easy to configure.  Almost all the features are  
available in HP when compared to cisco.

PS: Recently we migrated our entire network to HP Switches.

SKM

we have 120 machines on our lan. From the internet, we have an 8-port  
switch. 3 lines from this go to the servers (dhcp,mail, file,  
firewall etc), 4 lines are free and *one* line goes to a 24 port  
switch to which some machines are connected directly and the rest  
through 5 hubs. We were advised that we should have the 5 lines from  
the main 8-port switch go to 5 managed switches to which all the  
machines can be connected without using hubs.

the problems we are facing with the current setup:
1. slow speed for the machines downstream
2. some machines need static IPs for various reasons. We find that  
students in the labs put these static IPs on their machines creating  
problems.

any comments?

shouldnt be too much traffic - but a low end cisco router + a good 
managed switch to vlan static ip hosts into their own segment, and these 
other student lab IPs into a separate segment .. plus filters to stop 
ARP / MAC spoofing should help.

What are the applications it is slow ( it is net browsing/download/mail etc
)
what is the os in all the systems

in my understanding most of the network clogging  problems are due to
unwanted traffic caused by viruses.
If you ensure that the virus traffic is eliminated ( ie if all are running
on Linux else have a good  antivirus) then a network with 10 / 100 mbps enet
card and a simmilar ordinary switch stack should not be the bottle neck for
a  120  system network .
if you still have  speed issues , i suggest that upgrade the net back bone
connection which  probably is the bottle neck.
If the problem still persists , them you may look at upgrading the switches.

Poor quality hubs or cabling could also be a major bottleneck for even 
moderately heavy traffic (IM etc).  If you let wannabe skript kiddies on 
your college lan try packeting each other, run p2p etc then there's more 
problem.  Of course theres viruses and spyware (though a customized xp 
config and permissions should help there)

Dear friends,

Some time back in the television i have seen an advertisement. It struct me
once i saw it, The  ad goes like this, Few physically challenged children
will set for a race, one of them will fell down in the middle, all the rest
of the children will turn back and come to the child and pick him up,
finally they will form a human chain by clubbing their arms and pass the
finish line.The ad ends with a caption saying "Human spirits will never be
handicapped, NEVER".

This walk is to say "This is a community driven programme" for using
computer in a free legitimate way in the  ever expanding world of
technology. We are here for helping each other in the computing world. We
are looking for the human domain whether they are raw or expertised user. We
are showing our solidarity in the world of computing. By this , it never
means we are against any proprietory company like M$windows. We say about
the might of our community.

#1. I did not mention `microsoft' or `propreitary' anywhere.

#2. What I had intended was that the by doing `walks' it somehow takes a
political turn of events.

#3. While the targeted public is a computer literate (at least to a
minimum level), the achieved audience might (perhaps will) not be the same.

And I don't think ILUGC should take a stand _AGAINST_ proprietary
software. We can recommend Free Software but cannot condemn non-free
software.

I'm with Prashanth on this one. An electronic campaign (than a
physical one) will have a better impact on the IT crowd.

If you want a physical campaign, it should be targetted at the
colleges and schools. Maybe a walk _INSIDE_ IIT and then moving to
Anna University ?

2. Phase2 of Azma game platform project will be completely onsite, as
they cannot send the target board to india because of security and IP
related issues.



**3. Schedule and requirements:** Infact Phase 2 is already started and
is in the design stage.  Design would be completed by 10th of August
2006.  We are expected to join Phase 2 from August 10th till End of Sept
2006 (fully onsite).  The resource requirements are as below:



**August 10th to Sept 30th** - **I Project Manager and 1 Sr. Software
Engineer** (PL level)
             Note: There is a possibility that Sr.SE might be required
to come earlier - around 1st August instead of 10th Aug.   So please
consider the start date of Sr.SE as 1st August.


**Sept 1st to Sept 30th** - **2 or 3 Software engineers**



**4. Work specifics:** From August 10th to August 30th, it would be more
of design discussions,reviews, modifications, etc etc.  Both PM and
Sr.SE would be participating in it.  From Sept 1st to Sept 30th, it
would be implementation and testing. The target board is expected by the
end of August 06.  Implementation acitivities include Bootloader dev,
Board Definition (BDF) and OS related work (porting?).



**5. Skills required:** Experience in Linux (for embedded targets) -
should have good experience in compiling and debugging, Experience in
drivers, Bootloader dev, Root file system development etc.



Work scope after september is yet to be discussed and finalised with the
end customer.  I presume there would be some clarity in September.

Chennai is a Very big city with institutions like IIT-M and Anna 
University. Also, Chennai is also one of the major IT hubs and 
Techno-towns. So, its no surprise in seeing tuxians around.

Second, you are looking at a minor population of the chennai's entire 
computer-literate population. Even with ilugc, though there are more 
than 1000 members, only <50 members are quite active, either through 
physical participation or through mailing list.

So, what you are inferring upon is not quite right, IMHO !

Friends.

In suse 10, I got a tool called KBittorrent.
It is not working.

I have BSNL 900+ plan connection.
Got a router and connect 3 machines via NAT.

My friend told in windows the bit torrent clients works
after stopping firewall.

In suse10, i stopped the firewall.
But it is not working.

Is any direct connection to net is needed for Bittorrent?

How to make it work?

Thanks.

1. While not opposing proprietory software, we can hold banners against 
software piracy. Promote honesty among software users. If all the proprietory 
software being used are forced to be paid for, I am sure many of the users 
will consider open source alternatives.

2. Distribute CDs containing Windows versions of Open Source alternatives. A 
CD containing Firefox, Open Office, Gaim, Thunderbird etc can be prepared and 
distributed during the walk.

3. If it is going to be a Guindy walk, we should choose a working day peak 
hour time (8 am) and target the office/college going public. On a sunday as 
pointed out we might not reach the target audience. 

4. A walk from Guindy railway station to Gandhi Mandapam will cover a lot of 
ground. Office workers commuting to Tidal Park and beyond, Students going to 
Anna University campuses, government employees going to Anna Salai and beyond 
would be potential spectators for the walk. 

Count me in for such a walk in any form. It is a great exercise and improves 
digestion :-). 

Having benefitted so much from open source software and not having contributed 
back in equal measure I feel a personal obligation to participate in such 
events. 

Best regards,

Ma Sivakumar

So the motto of the Campaign is  "Use Open Source Software" rather "Use/Try
Linux" ?. So, our campaign would include M$ if it is opensourced, right?

It was just my suggestion :-). Why I said that was to convince some one to use 
open source software we should migrate them gradually. Providing open source 
alternatives for their current operating system (mostly Windows), will cut 
down their dependance on proprietary applications. 

Linux is a big jump for many ordinary users. We can ofcourse distribute Linux 
CDs. But as pointed out earlier, they should not end up being coasters.

While the long term objective can be to Use/Try Linux, to make an immediate 
large scale impact, promoting open source applications will be useful.

That is my belief, anyway.

Well, many people do not even know that they are using pirated windows
version...we have to explain the M$ EULA and make people understand that M$
at any time may take legal offense on anybody for using Pirated copies.

Linux is a big jump for many ordinary users. We can ofcourse distribute

errr...if we distribute cds, how many would be able to install without any
support :) . Just  a thought...anyway i think we can distribute the latest
Ubuntu...not for all, atleast for a few..

Very true. Perhaps explains why proprietary s/w vendors dont pust too
much against piracy in our country. If they do, with the resource pool
available in our country there will be a massive exodus towards OSS.

IMO the motto of the campaign is "Use FLOSS", rather than "Use Open 
Source Software", and I believe you know the difference between the two.

I always support open source software (in general terms) whether you pay for
it or you get it for free....

To achieve these goals, the Government would create an investor-
friendly environment and develop infrastructure. The Government was
aware of the strategic importance of promoting Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS). It would strive to make Kerala the FOSS industry
destination of the country.

Hi,

You don't have to disable firewall in Linux. Just
add the incoming port number to the firewall
to allow incoming connections to the KBittorrent.

You also have to set up port forwarding in your
CPE/router to accept incoming connections.
Check this link for configuring port forwarding
in your router/CPE.

Hello,

The "Ubuntu Linux" code named "Dapper Drake" was released on Jun 01
2006. In order to promote this release, i have printed the Ubuntu
Tshirt and distributing (selling) it to interested people. The rate
per piece is Rs.200/-. I'm planning to distribute it during this month
ilugc meeting (jul 08, yeah it's a late notice!).

For tshirt design details please visit [1]. If you wish to get one,
please include your name & tshirt size (S,M,L,XL) in [2] so i can
bring that many tshirts. Thank you!

BitTorrent is used to download files from the internet using peer to 
peer sharing, and it helps to reduce load on busy ftp servers and 
possibly faster downloads from a source close to you.

 From the file menu of kbittorrent, select "paste bittorrent url", and 
enter the url of the file you want to download.

For example, if you want to download the latest FreeBSD 6.1 release 
iso's, get the url from: http://torrents.freebsd.org:8080/

On Ubuntu, bittorrent may be invoked from mozilla or firefox. Using 
synaptic or other package managers, install bittorrent.Open mozilla or 
firefox.  Point the browser to a bittorrent seed. Click on the file you 
want to download, and select "open with default application 
/usr/bin/btdownloadgui " and do the rest.  man btdownloadgui for more info.

If download is interrupted, you could continue it later and manage it 
well. BitTorrent generally downloads the iso's etc into directories 
along with md5 checksums if any.  If you are using k3b to burn the iso 
to a cd, the integrity of the download is checked automatically.   HTH.

I am talking to the chairman of Jaya Engineering College tomorrow
morning probably, regarding the LDD (a more detailed talk then the one
I had previously with him early this week). If things go well I would
share the MOM.
Also I would like to discuss on what kind of a approach would be given
while doing LDDs at schools. What level of children will be targetted
etc. So that I can talk to couple of schools where I personally know
the prinicipal.
Bharathi please add these two to the agenda also :-)

Hi all,

This mail is not intended to create disagreement or war. Its just for
discussion.

I see many are interested in creating awareness about FOSS and OSS (somebody
told me both are different) thru a Walk or by taking other initiatives. I
thought i should share my views.

The first audience for these kinda awareness programs are The People.When i
say People, it includes all types of People.Refer people to Customers.
Customers are always with high expectations and if they find if some
requirement is not been provided, they would simply jump to another
alternative and they need not ask anybody for that.For Customers, it has to
work, thats it.So, this is also same for our People, whom we are targetting.

Yes, Linux (the Kernel) is free of cost.Many bundle it in distros and
integrate many items properly to make the newly built distro work. Some give
it for free and other charge a small sum for the distro. There is nothing
wrong in this.Developers spend a lot of time in developing it and in return
if they dont get anything, its like "whats there me working on it?". But
before you charge, you should be confident that your product is worth
charging.Now, why FOSS and OSS ?. Why cant people address just as OSS ?. The
term "Free" in the GPL License does not mean that it is "Free of Cost". If
you want everything for free of cost in this world, then nothing can
be.Anywayz, i wanted to address this becoz people are misleaded.

When we distribute CDs for creating awareness and say Linux Distribution is
an alternate to Windows Operating System, we should also think whether it
would suit their already going on day-to-day activities.There are many
issues with Linux distros like Webcam support,audio and video conferencing.
These, have developed a lot and now we can tell we have a viable solution,
but that solution to work we need to get them integrated
well.Butunfortunately, there are also many restrictions that those
software put. For
example, you cannot bundle Skype along with your distribution. So, telling a
noob user to install (eventhough we have tools), this being a basic need, he
would ask -" why should i,will you not provide me when i install your OS? ".
Even for mp3,dvd supports and other codecs, it is the same.Even if i give
Ubuntu, we dont have these formats included and the first impression once
the distribution is installed is,"i cannot play my mp3s".

There are still things to be enhanced in the Desktop usage side with Linux,
and i think we as LUG have to take care on how we can improve it and there
by create awareness.Becoz, once we propose or tell-> "please use this",
People will come up with many issues and am sure we do know those issues
already.We should have a team to address those issues and resolve. We cannot
give Distros as such and then forget it.

I think all these points should be considered during awareness
programs/campaigns.The main obstacle of people not using Linux in their
desktops, as i see, is the lack of Yahoo/MSN webcam support. Many parents do
Video Chat every week with their son/daughter abroad.How are we going to
tackle issues like these?. We need to discuss on several issues that we
would face.

Basically, i have the habit of categorizing Users/People into different
categories,like,
1) Normal Desktop Users (No Internet, just entertainment, this can also
include Media Center)
2) Normal Desktop Users with Internet Support (which may/not include
Video/Audio Conferencing)
3) Developers/Programmers (non MS developers, like Java/Python etc.,)
4) Gamers (may/not include 2nd type)
5) Combination of 1 + 2+ 3 + 4

I suggest User to try out Linux based on these categories.As far as today,
only for 3rd type of Users,i have been comfortable to suggest.For other
types, i was not able to convince a normal user(who has not been exposed to
Linux at all) to use Linux, there were many issues which were not
answerable.I dont know why, but we feel its easy but if you look at a normal
user and sit with him for 5 mins, you would have atleast 10 issues.

What i feel is, we have few areas to cover up.For example, we have to expose
people to Skype and what one can do with Skype, then Gaim (Gaim 2.0 has
yahoo webcam support), then aMSN (MSN webcam support), linux supported
hardware devices etc.,These have to reach people somehow, whether it is
through campaign or internet or advertisements or writing books or anything.

I feel we need to be ready before we start our awareness programmes.

Just my thoughts....

Hi Buddy,
Nice to see you taking solid efforts on this. Hope we could repeat the
same success story we had in t'vannamalai here to. Talk to him such that
we have a chance to implement the same LDD model here to, which means..

1. Some selected volunteers ( from CSE, IT, ECE and EEE ) can be picked
up, based upon their own interest added by the departments , and trained
for to handle the LDD by the LUGies.

2. Luggies will help and support this effort, but expect equal support
and interest, esp from the students.

3. Does the college have a local LUG ? Speak about it too ;)

4. For the schools, we can use edu-ubuntu and other edu tools. In
addition, special session by Shakthi on Tamil typewriting, which will
help tamil teachers type question papers in PC ;)

5. Also, we can help in installing OSS in the school comp labs and help
them use OSS, esp tools like Open Office etc. Ask them to insist the
students to use these tools also.

6. High school students belonging to comp branch can be taught about
Open source and *nix OS'es, even a general intro about linux kernels and
how things got developed. This will moot interest within them over FOSS
and Linux esp. :D

These are just my ideas.

Don't do that.

Actually I would say all users are of type 5. A user based in category
1 might not be a developer, but he would like it if his OS was
developer-friendly. Telling him that his OS is just for normal-desktop
use and is not supposed to be a development based desktop will only
turn him off. He might never become a developer but he will be happy
knowing that his OS can also be a developer OS.

My point is, all these custom distro's are good for solving one
problem and one problem only. These sort of problems are usually that
of the GEEKy-type (Ex: I need Media Center s/w on my PIII, I use a
MythTV-Knoppix based distro), not the casual user.

Unless there is major development upstream to address the common
user's issues I dont think we can do much but help out with what we
have now.

just my 0.02$

No.. I won't be happy. One of the reasons why I am happier with my
Debian than Windows is that it is able to provide for my system what I
as R.Ramkumar needs, not everything that I as a Mr. Generic User will
probably need. The rest is derogatorily looked down upon the former as
bloat :)

That apart, I think this is an issue which strikes at the heart of
what is the philosophy of the FOSS world, versus other proprietary
vendors. Due to the immense flexibility and freedom, it is but natural
for alternatives to be more specific and focussed. That's why we have
distros customized right for from routers to laptops, from the lay
user to the sophisticated geek.

So, how to make the common man happy? Without troubling him too much,
ask him a single question about what his needs are, and pull out
something out of the hat just perfect for him. When done just to the
right extent, I believe he/she would be happy with the the richness of
the FOSS world.

Adding two more cents to this thread :)

it moves on...

I have been discussing with Prof. M.Kumaran, HOD, CSD,
Jaya Engineering College on a half-a-day/one-day
workshop for them, prior to the LDD.

They are planning for a LDD in August, and require
guidance and support from ILUGC members.

"We are offering FOSS as elective to our Engineering
and MCA students. Last year out of 580 students opted
Foss as elective from various engineering colleges in
tamil Nadu, 150 of our students taken. They are very
much enjoyed with that course and passed with very
good score. This semester  we are offering for 100
students. We have active Linux Campus Club in our
campus. And we have seperate FOSS Lab. This is abt
brief outline of foss activity in our campus. "

How to enable the NAT entries for bittorrent in this?

Tha admin panel is tough to understand.

It can enable or disable ports by single.

How to give a range for bittorrent?

This is how they make money in the "service" industry.
You and me don't have the time to look into the code.
You just give the work to developers/admin folks and
they maintain the system for you for a premium charge.

Agreed. Nobody said it was. If you assumed it, then
what can we do about it?

Did you know there are companies who customize
distros, packages for client requirements and charge a
service fee for maintenance over a period of time?

Example: Red Hat

Aren't you an embedded software engineer at Novatium?
You should know this - Never blame the software if
there is no support from the hardware folks.

I've told this many times. If vendors don't release
their hardware data sheets, you cannot _write_ device
drivers for it ... (1)

If you don't understand the language, you cannot
communicate with the people who are using it.

You only said customers change their requirements
often - which is true. So, you can never say there are
only people of type I, II or III. Everyone is of type
V.

Do you know how long it takes to plan/organize an
awareness programme?

I would appreciate if you can first participate in few
LDDs/workshops before making any recommendations.

I never assumed, if you see some of the LUG posts, you would find it.And i
was mainly concerned about FOSS and OSS and not about money.If you had
interpreted in a wrong manner, sorry about that.

First take concern of the nearby people's need and then give examples
whether they(RedHat or any other company) are been supporting or not their
needs.When i say people, its not Companies/Organiztions.

Well , i think SuSe is doing a good job than RedHat in terms of Desktop.

Excuse me,irrelevant of where i work, i do know there are hardware devices
which linux already supports...and many distros make it work like
suse,linspire etc.,You have to agree there are issues with Linux distros, do
u think every people are satisfied like you do?...how many people you want,
come with me once to customer places and they will tell you what they want
and then answer back them in the same manner.....

This clearly shows that you are not exposed to the Customer Market,mainly
Home Users.Programming,developing,improving can make a developer or engineer
happy, but not the end users.

An awareness programme should not be conducted just for the case that it has
to be...we have to see how far this could improve.I never told that the
awareness walk which is going to be conducted should be stopped/cancelled.I
just gave my points IN THIS THREAD that we should address few issues.

I would appreciate if you can first participate in few
> LDDs/workshops before making any recommendations.


I think i am with the Linux Community already and i dont think participation
is the only way to prove that am eligible to recommend things.It is the
readers wish to take it or not.And i dont think i need to advertise what i
am doing.

Shakthi, i do appreciate if you could reply with some respect or better,
dont reply, which best suits for you. We are just discussing here and
already few people have agreed and discussed their concerns too in a
respectable tone.I would not have replied to your comment, but since you had
asked me directly whether am a s/w engg or not, i replied.One cannot tell
Linux is free of issues, and i do know where and how my contribution is
done.Just that you are organising LDDs/awareness programmes does not make
you to reply like this.

Members, i do appreciate if this issue is being taken.I have been
uncomfortable even before with Shakthi's way of handling
replies.Everybodyshould be given respect and taken
back.I hope members do understand this.

I do belive that for many products to work , developers have done reverse
engineering.

Shakthi, if you have told many times, what you want us to do with that "many
times"..sorry.You are not a tutor here, just a member of ilugc, as how
everybody are.

Hello Shakthi:          Attn.: parthan, kenneth, sujith, bharathi, raman

As you are aware, one of the activities of NRCFOSS is to promote FOSS
elective for B.E.(CSE), B.Tech.(IT) and MCA students. Towards this we have
designed two elective papers -- one on the basics and other on Enterprise
applications. Jaya Engg final year students from CSE and IT opted for the
elective during the last summer and Kumaran told me that all of them have
cleared. During the current semester, they want to offer it to MCA -- in
fact both the electives. Their M.Sc students are also interested. We should
appreciate the efforts by Kumaran, Janarthanan and their colleagues (and the
management and students).

Raman and Bharathi had addressed about 40-50 lecturers from different
colleges during the training program we conducted for Elective during last
month. Many of them are keen to conduct LDDs / seminars in their colleges.
We are also trying to set up FOSS labs in all the 50 colleges under our
program (some like Jaya, RMK, Kongu, Sona, Thyagaraja, etc., already have
fully functional FOSS labs).

In my discussions with Raman and Bharathi, we had found merit in one day
training of the students and enabling them to conduct the LDD later
(basically the Arunai experience). I would suggest that you please add
something for students who are not from core computer branches, esp.
Mechanical and ECE. At least one stall could contain demo / exposition on
QCad, Calculix, Scilab, etc. Senthil Anand and Sujith from our group have
done some work on it. Some of  you could come over here on a mutually
convenient day and we can fix up a set. Or else, Parthan (who is already in
with us) can take the lead in this guided by Kenneth.

We can work out a basic structure training and LDD / workshop / half-a-day
seminar. I would suggest that we focus more on the potential use of FOSS and
the various application areas, the opportunity for collaborative development
(and, forgive me, less on the history and philosophy). We could think of a
joint msg to the colleges that ILUG-C and NRCFOSS / AU-KBC are joining to
HELP THE COLLEGES TO ORGANIZE the LDD / seminar. If feasible, I can discuss
with Prof Krishanan (our Director) to transmit the msg thru our Teachers
Mailing group and also put in NRCFOSS portal.

I could then implore the colleges to (a) conduct at least one LDD / lecture
related to FOSS during July-Aug-Sep ; (b) the colleges which have LUG shoud
organize a lecture for the benefit of nearby schools on the Software Freedom
Day ; (c) all the colleges should have a local LUG -- inaugurated on the
LDD/Seminar or on SF Day.

Raman and I had discussed about zone-wise LUGs with apex members interacting
with ILUG-C. This is not to restrict membership, but to co-ordinate and
organize local events more effectively.

Thanks and best wishes, Srinivasan.

Shakthi also informed about the same, happy to hear that students have 
found FOSS electives interesting as well as easy.
  Many of them are keen to conduct LDDs / seminars in their colleges.

As of LDDs, ILUGC will wish to follow "The Arunai LDD" Model everywhere :)

Same as above..

Ya, I wanted to stress this. Other than CSE and IT, branches like EEE, 
ECE and ICE can also make use of open source tools. Embedded and VLSI 
technology very much uses *nix in them. So, as a EEE by grad, I support 
one or two stalls for Electical/Electronics based and Mechanical based 
foss tools. The former may deal with Embedded and VLSI and Tools for 
Electrical simulations similar to elec-autocad (Am not aware of any, but 
  if I get an opportunity, I wish to develop one in future, will ponder 
more into it ;) ). The latter may have QCAD and SciLab, perhaps taken 
care by Sujith and Senthil.

1. LDD will have to be developed further into routine lecture sessions, 
a FOSS lab hour - like the library hour and PT hour we used to have in 
schools, maybe CSE and IT departments may be encouraged to conduct "code 
a program" contests.

2. After a group of volunteers have been trained by the LDD, this group 
should be able to lead the process further in their respective 
institutions. They should train more poeple, so that we don't have the 
necessity to keep training ppl from the same college for LDDs, rather 
concentrate on other colleges.

3. As with arunai college, who have said that they will participate in 
the proposed "Guindy March', the colleges we visit should also 
contribute the community efforts, leaded by ILUGC / NRCFOSS or any 
local/national Linux comminities.

If not a LUG, atleast a Club of Linux Users. It may have volunteers who 
contact LUGC for help and support. this club will take efforts to spread 
FOSS in their own locality, ILUGC will just provide the Umbrella! :)

Looking for more active '2-Months' for ILUGC. Let us try to make some 
hay, while the sun is shining.

Yes, if the "protocol" of message passing is in the
public domain.

Most of the vendors form an implementor's forum, where
they prepare a closed/open standard for
interfaces/protocols. USB-IF is an open standard:
http://www.usb.org. All the IETF RFCs are open
standards.

How each vendor implements the standard could be
different and is proprietary. As long as they adhere
to the standard, their product should be compliant and
they can market it to customers. So, you can use Logic
Analysers, snoopers to capture the packets and analyze
what is being transmitted, by comparing the outputs
*with* the open standard protocol.

But, some forums are closed, so you will never know
what protocols are used. Secure Digital, for example.
You will need to pay heavy licensing fees, which
individuals cannot afford to pay. Only companies can
afford such pricing.

http://www.sdcard.org/licensing/hala.html

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_Card

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2003-July/008166.html

Yet, SD is supported in the Linux kernel, thanks to
feedback from developers in the community.

These days, lot of R&D companies use GNU/Linux, have
support for it, and contribute to it. Its just that
few players are yet to comply.

Sorry for little long post on this subject.

A fundamental points that the OP has raised some thing like this

What is the use of propagating linux if I cannot get my webcam
working?
Linux is not fit to be propagated at present, address all issues then
talk about it. Till then will you all shut your mouth?


Last year in India 5 million PCs were sold. But how many webcam? 1
million?

Computer software has diverse use. In a shop, in a home, in school,
in a office, in research and so on. The needs vary.

Yes linux has problems. But be honest, and tell me can't we use
present day distributions in atleast 80-90 percent of places where
computers are used? e.g
a. A office dealing with trivial typing and spread sheet.
b. In schools to teach children
c. In shops and other places of commerce.
d. In government offices

Well the above four itself will account for more than 80% of computer
usage as on date.

Is not linux fit in all these places?. 
If yes how many of these places use linux?

I am sure every body will agree that the usage is nearly 0 %.
What is wrong in creating awarness of FOSS atleast in these areas?
Why don't we look at the possible places where FOSS can already
satisfy the need.

Few months back I studied an NGO, who are working on Rural Health.
They don't need webcam, digital camera,TV tuner card, skype and ....
They just want to type, keep accounts and take printout.
Don't you think FOSS is fit for them?

Basically, OP, looks the world through his experience and feels linux
is not fit. Similarly I see from my experience, that Linux as of
today is fit for NOT LESS than 90% of the places where computer is
used for something.

There are some basic doubts raised about the awarness campaign,
whether it will serve any purpose etc.

My feeling, is let us do something, than simply fear about failures.
Think positively, act with confidence. True there is good chance of
failure, but what is the loss. After all the participant may loose

a.Few hours/days in participation. 
   But it is voluntary. Nobody is forced to participate. Only willing
   people donate time. This should be considered a donation with  
   asking for return.

b.May be some physical discomfort
   Only people who think they can endure and are willing to 
participate.

This is the right time for the walk... As u can see, Vista i released and
people have to spend another 15000 to upgrade.. Tell them linux is freee. As
the to join ilugc in case they hae some problems with hardware, Lastly dont
portray Ubuntu as the only linux distro.. IMHO we can even give the users

I will tell this to the chairman? I will speak to him only after we
meet then. Seems like a lot of people are talking to a lot of sources
in the same college which will lead to several organisational problems
which most of you would be aware of. So lets take some kind of a
decision as to how we go about a certain "Plan of Action" today. What
say guys?

But I have been talking about a July LDD to the chairman of Jaya
Institutions :-( See. Already one conflict.

NOTE: Please keep the list informed about any initiative being taken
so that others will help/co-ordinate with the same person to avoid too
many parallel processes without sync.

Cheers.

I am sorry to say this. But most of your posts nowadays have been
saying "ILUGC Members are people who dont know anything and are here
for the heck of it". Atleast this is what I interpret. Not good.

Did nt you read on the Arunai LDD and its effects on people. Ask me as
I have personally transformed more than 100 users till date to start
using GNU/Linux as their primary OS. Period. Most of them have turned
into contributors by submitting bug reports and wishlists and now a
small percentage are also trying to submit patches. A big success IMO.
Some of them have been planning to start businness on this base. So
Stop complaining and start making things work, what you feel does not.
I am not saying you are not contributing but asking you to stop
complaining and take initiative in making whatever you feel (webcam
support) work. I would appreciate such things from a developer like
you.

A request to Shakthi. Dont bring in Companies here.

You are not the one to take such decisions. Sorry.

Shakthi's post was also adding some points for you to take it up and
start working and not otherwise. I did not feel anything *insulting*
in shakthis post. If you have found it then you have not been exposed
to the *real* flames yet I guess ;-)

Aah. Once again. See issue above. I publicly state that *Shakthi* is
one person who is fiercely advocating FLOSS in both physical as well
as virtual manner. Very few of us have been going to institutions (may
be shuveb, Raman, THiyagu, Bharathi??) and we just cant afford to sit
back at home and happily comment on things. Not good once again.

Kindly take the criticism in a very positive manner and keep
contributing to FOSS as you are now doing. All the very best.

Cheers.

I don't see anything which should link up linux users with Java. But
it's true that many UNIX coders, atleast the general software
developers, prefer to stick to C.

it moves on...

Most linux developers are well versed in C and they love it becoz of its
flexibility and other thinks and "may" hate Java. Linux "users" as in the
case are not going to be the real developers. They just use the software. So
they will see the difference by the speed it runs. Java softwares run slow..
!! so what will they prefer. C softwares... It doesn't mean that they hate
Java...

i never heard people who using linux says that they hate java. if they
say like that, then they do not know what java means... or what OOP
means or what programming language means...

have  u tried JDK1.5? its much faster than earlier version of java.
java needs some good hardware to run. if u have the right hardware i.e
RAM, it will run like anything and better than anything. Every
language has hardware requirements. if u fulfill that, every language
will run properly.

> Do linux users really hate Java?

I am a Linux user for over 6 years now. And Java is what I work on to
make my living :-). In fact, a lot of people around me work on Java,
on Linux.

You really can't combine these two. If you look at most of the latest
J2EE servers (such as websphere/Oracle WebAppServer), they are
sometimes tailor made to run on Linux (particularly after pThread
fixes). Eclipse (a Java based IDE for almost any prog. lang), is
bundled along with RedHat Linux (and many others).

Do Java developers hate Linux? If the answer is NO, and if they also
work on Linux, they also become a part of Linux users :-P

On the lighter side, a joke that I read recently: (no offences meant)

A guy approached the priest and asked him, "can I smoke while I
pray?". The answer was "NO". The other guy went and asked the priest
"Can I pray while I smoke?".

Hi all,

I never complained, i told we(which includes me too) need to address few
issues. IMO ilugc is already doing them.It was Shakthi's mail which changed
the way it had to be. If members are happy the way Shakthi replied,then you
wont find me of much help. Thanks for all the replies.But i dont accept that
Shakthi did a good job by replying in that way JUST FOR THE SAKE HE HAS
CONDUCTED SOME LDDs/WORKSHOPS, am sorry about that.

Well, again it has been interpreted wrong.I did tell that we have to educate

I did tell the same thing what you have but in a differnt manner.So, again
you say i intended to tell "Till then will you all shut your mouth?" ???

When Prof. Kumaran met me in Thiruvannamalai, we were
planning for a workshop for July. I wanted a separate
day's workshop to spend my time with the
students/faculty.

It will be mostly introductory - philosophy of free
software, careers, free/open software, desktop
environment, a documentary movie.

If you would like to plan a two day hands-on mentor
training, like what we did in Thiruvannamalai, please
go ahead with it. I can join in too.

SK

I am afraid that is not the right interpretation of the OP's claim. I
suppose he merely meant that the lack of drivers for certain hardwares
(the web cam as he says and a lot of wi-fi cards I hear) might irk the
common computer user. He probably termed it badly after a long days work
:-) it happens to all of us doesn't it. And yes I agree with you that
the affected group is not a majority at all.

Skype as he mentioned might be proprietary but it is an excellent piece
of software. From Linux's point of view, it would help that more that
softwares creep in (perhaps not from an open source point of view).

On a related note, I was talking to parthan about promoting Linux in
colleges and schools. I was of the opinion that when promoting Linux,
care should be taken so that they adopt Linux along with support (say
something like RHEL). Along the way they may face problems and might
drop off. But if they do have some kind of paid support, they always
have someone to rant to :D.

Parthan on the other hand was of the opinion that Linux will not be
adopted if it is not free (as in beer) since the users who use pirated
versions of software will still not be willing to pay. The cost of an
Operating System with paid support is rather small when compared to the
entire price paid for the hardware along with its support. ``Free
Support'' will make them look forward for more freebies. The concept for
paying for support needs to be imbibed.

I think this lack of a ``commercial'' tinge to Open Source development
is what the OP was initially driving to. I understand that some people
are more comfortable with FLOSS (as I am repeatedly pointed out). My
question is why is it that people repeatedly say ``Use FLOSS not OSS''?
Is it any different in the open spirit if I was to pay for a piece of
software and thereby gain access to its code as against getting the code
with no monetary transactions?

Does it have an ethernet interface or USB interface? 

If it has ethernet, then you can use the ethernet port
on your GNU/Linux system to connect with it. Use
roaring penguin client to connect to your ISP.

I am very sorry that Prashanth didn't post the context in which my 
comment was made, as well as the other faces of the argument. That makes 
the above quoted commented of mine to be short-in-focus. We were 
actually arguing how the activities of LUG should be focused and what 
shall be the motive of it. As he said, he was trying to justify adding a 
price tagged model or may be said as commercial model and not as 'free' 
model.

IMO, the activity of the Linux community such as ilugc can be focused on 
three different kind of people,

1. Linux Users ( i.e. within the community)
2. Students and teachers
3. Common men who are in need of an economic solution.

Considering these 3 types of people, the approach of LUG towards each 
type is very different.

Considering the academic community, consisting of students and teachers, 
who are atleast computer literates to some extent, if not Open Source 
literates. And, the fact is also that they have been using proprietary 
software for a long time. Our aim should be to make them FOSS aware and 
with a little of motivation and effort we can achieve this. This is 
what, ilugc has been doing through LDDs and seminars held in various 
colleges/schools and plan to carry the same further in the future. 
Considering the schools,  who may not be as wealthy as colleges, is it a 
viable option for them to buy RHEL ? Do they really need things like 
RHEL, when they are just beginning to get into OSS. I do not commit to 
Prash's argument that 'along the way, problems might turn them off/drop 
them off". We, in ilugc, not only strive to create linux/OSS awareness 
but also ready to help academic people become OSS literates. We showed 
this with our arunai college experience, where ilugc was able to train a 
group of volunteers who were able to run the LDD very much upon 
themselves, backed by the ilugc. And for the kind information, we didn't 
put up any banner like 'free CDs' will be distributed and perhaps din't 
give any. Still there was a huge crowd turn up that day. Hence, we 
believe that the term 'Free' as in 'Free beer' is not mandatory w.r.t. 
academic community.

Considering the common men, who are need of support of computers but 
can't afford for costly solutions like RHEL support. These people aren't 
really computer savvy but the seek the help of computers to make their 
work simple. For these people, 'Free' as in 'Free beer' does matter a 
lot. In this way, the Open Source can help them a lot. It is also true 
that, the requirements of these people can be solved with 'free as in 
free beer' softwares available in open source world today. If not, a 
solution can be developed with an economically viable price tag for them 
in OSS.

People don't understand when you speak them the benefits of OSS, but 
surely when you show them. Thats what we do, by holding LDDs. Indeed, 
ilugc wishes and plans to reach more people in the academic community as 
well as the common men who are in need of OSS's help :)

Colleges definitely can Pay the dough. I remember that Joe Steeve and
some of his juniors in college setup a Linux lab in a college, after
sometime, they screwed something up and asked (rather demanded) Joe's
juniors to set it up again. Becoming free servicemen will only make them
expect more freebies. Had the college invested in paid support they have
a point of contact for support.

Awareness I agree. But not to become door to door service men.

This makes sense. But then I was referring to the few who would point
out FLOSS when I say OSS.

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0607082338n63adcfdbjd4efb07d1077a36e@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

After finishing yesterdays meet, me(Shrini) and buvan went to ELCOT Office.

Interesting matters held there.

Buvan installed Ubuntu in Mr.UmaSankar's Laptop.
Before, it had Redhat and XP. He had some documents at Redhat.
So, While buvan asked him to remove XP, He accepted with no thinking.

He installed it nicely.

Meanwhile, I went to make tamil unicode typing at Openoffice.

It is simple in Opensuse KDE.
In persenal settings->Region&accebility->Keyboard Layout
It is there to add tamil unicode.

Then put the ~ key to switch the layout.
Thats it. Well done, I hoped.

But there is some real problem in unicode tamil keyboard layout.
It is not purely 100% Remington Typewriter layout.
Sakthi has unicode layout in his site.
I phoned him and gave the people there.

They found some problem in this layout.
As they have 10+ experience in Remington layout,
They feel very tough to adapt this unicode layout.

And the font "Lohit tamil" give some space problems.
It adds ore extra spaces while typing. So alignment is tough.

The requirement is
1. A tamil unicode keyboard layout 100% compitable with remington layout.
2. It should not gice any extra spaces.

Any one has taml typing experience in linux?
How do u solve this?
please mail me,list or hi ur experiences.

Then, He showed the conference hall for GLV. It is nice.

Buvan installed Ubuntu. He likes its automounting options.
It played his DVD movie automatically.
It asked to open the folder when he inserted his thumb drive.

At last, he made his drive to drop me at villivakkam, my place, with some staff.

Thus, He is more interested in FOSS.
With his efforts, Tamilnadu may become FOSS Station.

Thank you all.

dear,
T.Shrinivasan.

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0607082345j284c6a0dx432dca60a37c4df8@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

ELCOT needs tamil keyboard layout 100% compitable with Remington layout.
It is the one the ordinary tamil typewriter has.
Because most of the government staff trained and certified by
typewriting institutes as has more experience on that.

So, they feel tough to adapt some modified version of it which the
tamil unicode has.

In windows, they pay for "vanavil", which gives the same functionality.

So, Is there any one compitable?

Or, ELCOT can pay to develop such a keyboard driver.?
Can any of use do it?
If can please contact Mr.Uma sankar.


If done, it is a greate contribution for the tamil community.

(If can, please write driver for phonetic also.
because a lot of people like me, who dont know tamil typing
can enjoy typing in tamil with phonetic layout :-)

Thank you.

I found a screenshot of Remington layout from Google:
http://www.supersoftweb.com/images/T_kbd_r.gif
 
Looks totally different to unicode-style.

Which editor did you use? Did you try
Abiword/Openoffice/GEdit?

We need to remap the keys and there are some
tutorials/HOWTOs on how we can do this:

http://docs.linux.com/article.pl?sid=04/06/03/1558258&tid=26

http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-mini/Intkeyb.html

I am no expert in Indic computing, but, the gurus
should be able to solve this easily. 

http://indlinux.org/wiki/index.php?KeyboardLayoutSwitching

I think you should contact the Indic computing folks
and thamizha group (Mugunth and co).

SK

Ya. this keyboard is entirely different.
But this is not the normal typewriter layout.
They need normal layout.

I used Open office writer, as this is the default offcie tool to be.

And the links are nice.
Let me try out with this.

But, I hope the tamil gurus can do it easily.

So, we can write a script to remap the keys
and give the script to them. It would be more user freindly.

Gurus!   please Help.

Sorry, what do you mean by normal layout?

Ok. I usually use GEdit and spacing is fine. Probably
for the specific font one needs to adjust spacing in
OpenOffice?

> So, we can write a script to remap the keys

Check /etc/X11/xkb/symbols/in that has the key to
character mapping for Indian languages.

We need to add another entry say:

 partial alphanumeric_keys  
 xkb_symbols "tam_REM" {
 ...

Contact e-mail addresses of all the keyboard layout
authors is available in the code.

I have no idea what each hexadecimal value represents.
Applications -> Accessories -> Character Map gives
only unicode values for Tamil.

Yeah, but he wanted to retain his redhat partition, as he had his data

With regard to Ubuntu installation, everything went smooth (including
network, audio, video, mouse, etc) except wireless. I've installed and
configured wpa_supplicant software. When i run wireless, i'm able to
ping their wireless gateway IP, but i'm unable to ping the wireless
nameserver. FWIW, they use static IP address for the laptop. I'm
unsure what kind of settings i must verify to fix it.

Is the nameserver the wifi server supplies actually usable - that is if

Hi!

I use Emacs from CVS (last built today). Just tried typing in tamil
using the tamil-itrans input method of quail with font -tharagai-tscu
paranar-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1. Unfortunately there
seems to be problems with the rendering - the modifiers get printed
after the main characters - I have seen this problem with app not
properly written for indic support (like Firefox without pango). Is
there any way to fix this? And is this a problem generally with
non-pango apps?

As a side-note, is there any font with tamil support which is fixed
atleast for the english characters? Fixed fonts look great on Emacs,
but choosing a tamil font means I would have to go for variable
widths...

it moves on...

The admin says that it works fine, but how do we confirm this ?
Mr.Umashankar has another laptop in which the wireless works well
(unfortunately, he didnt have it with him that day, but confirmed to
get it next week). So, i guess we can check the settings in that and
replicate. Anyhow, yesterday, i didnt try "nslookup www.google.com",
but i'll do that.

Hai linux geeks,

This is Subash, and am a newbie to Linux (and ILUGC). It's been almost 8 years of Windows reign, and I've finally decided to break the prison.

I am a new-recruit programmer at American Int'l Group (AIG), and will be buying a laptop soon. But I'm too much confused:
Which architecture to choose? Intel Centrino, or AMD64 (Turion)? Which one is best supported by Linux? (I did hear rumors that AMD64 causes problems on most distros)

Which distro? SUSE, Ubuntu, Mandriva or Fedora? And where to get that in Chennai?
I shall be using my Tux machine for development in J2EE, OpenLaszlo & Perl, with Apache running around. Yeah, and also for office, multimedia and the internet.

Any advice from the linux gurus here would be greatly appreciated, as I am in a great dilemma. Plz send your suggestions to: sjsubbi@gmail.com

Thanx, and bye 4 now.

:)

My thoughts below:

First thing you should choose is the laptop screen
size that you want. The bigger the screen, greater is
the battery size, and greater the weight. Depending on
how fit you are, you might choose between light-weight
or heavy laptops.

Never tried AMD64, but, you can browse here:

http://www.linux-laptop.net/

You can also google for HOWTOs or tutorials by people
who have installed x distribution on y laptop, or
simply GNU/Linux on y laptop.

> Which distro? SUSE, Ubuntu, Mandriva or Fedora? 

Choice of distro is a personal preference. I'd
recommend any recent distro.

> And

Check here first:

If you don't find the distro you want, just shoot an
e-mail to the list.

Enjoy your learning experience,

When I bought a laptop, I chose the best one which I prefer, Whatever it 
is, there will be one distro that will satisfy your needs. :) So, go and 
buy what u prefer. Intel Centrino is what i have, and i suggest, but I 
am not very much AMD literate.

First, the choice of distro is something a personal preference. I 
suggest Ubuntu Dapper, because it is the coolest distro on earth as of

I don't have pango installed.

But, the above is due to a VTE bug. I guess its still
being worked on.

Agreed. Am with you on this :-)

But should a language pay for it's creator's mistakes? How about gcj?
And all the open platforms (under Apache license) that are available?
J2EE for example is a open standard on which any one can build a
server (Apache TomCat being the reference implementation.).

Agreed., but only partially. If you look at majority of the software
projects that are being executed currently, majority are corporate
in-house projects (very much specific to business and has business
secrets built into them).

>From a design perspective, and implementation perspective (may be due
to marketing by companies like IBM, BEA, ...), people have implemented
some very good platforms for enterprise level architectures. I have of
course coded on C/C++, PHP, CGI PERL, VB, VC++, COBOL and Java. I am
not here to say that, something is impossible to do in C++ and is
possible on Java, but it is just the easiness of implementation that
is available on Java for ENTERPRISE APPLICATION projects, as per
CURRENT standards. There is no doubt that C/C++ is always superior in
terms of speed, but implementation and development/maintenance  costs
are of course higher.

Also, as a project architect/designer for some huge enterprise
projects, I do have some queries on implementation specifics. I will
post them shortly.

The Centrino vs Turion is a good debate and here are my thoughts..

The centrino is good if you want great performance-per-watt, meaning
you will get more done for less power which inturn means your battery
life will be more per charge. The turion is great if you are
interested in a desktop-replacement. If you are going to be travelling
a bit, go for the centrino, if performance and games are important
then turion. Both are well supported under Linux.

A point to consider, Intel's Core Duo 2 will be launched later this
month and laptops based on that should arrive soon after. The new
turion's are also impressive. If you dont mind waiting , I suggest you
wait till Nov-Dec and see how good they are.

I bought a laptop last week, the Dell XPS m1210, it's centrino based
and a compact one yet packs a lot of power. I wrote up a small preview
of it too: http://toufeeq.blogspot.com/2006/06/dell-xps-m1210.html

Since this is your first foray into Linux, stick to the road. Choose
either Ubuntu 6.06, Fedora Core 5 or Open SUSE 10.

have fun,

I don't know much about Firefox internals. But I was referring to the
similar problem faced in many Fx builds without pango (One such report
came to this group, for which the response was that builds with pango
work properly) Indeed I had the same issue with an optimized build got
from net which didnt have pango enabled, but the one shipped with
Debian (with pango enabled) had no problems.

it moves on...

Message-ID: <e977d4310607091000o2aa92488i56bbc8cca01f19a4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

For quite some time now, I have been wondering if there are any
platforms/architectures available for enterprise business applications
on a Linux platform? (if none available, lets start one :-) )

I will try to explain what kind of enterprise application I am talking about.

A business (lets say a bank) wants to build its software (may be from
scratch). It wants its software to be user friendly, scalable reliable
and future proof.

It should be possible to throw in some extra hardware to meet an
increase in usage, without modifying the software. It must also be
possible to add in new interfaces or business modules or change the
existing applications at will. Also the GUIs will be developed by
professional designers and ergonomics experts while the business
logic's will be done by geeks.

Certainly, we cannot put a Apache WS/PHP (alone) or LAMP for this
situation. Here in the corporate world, the database is HUGE. The
number of applications(modules) are also huge. Just as Mr. Umashankar
explained, in his application, the student councilors are interested
in the details of the students, while the Finance dept is interested
in the money that they have collected. The admin is more interested in
the courses/students statistics. We will be building separate
modules/applications for these. Some of these WILL NOT be web based,
while some WILL BE web based. Also, there are parts which are
accessible only to the employees while some are accessible to the
students.

Those who have worked with a Web Based application, would be familiar
with the number of fields that are available per screen and the number
of reports that are generated. A Discussion forum  application is
"NOT" an example for the kind of sophistication that I am quoting
here.

For this kind of applications, a few things are mandatory:
1. MVC 2 architecture
      The display logic should be independent of the business
implementation. a PHP code that writes out HTML output should not be
accessing the database directly.

2. Separation of Business Logic as a separate entity, which can be
accessed either though a desktop application or through a web
application or a B2B application. (may be through CORBA, for example).

3. A transaction manager which can do the work of Containers in a J2EE
environment or CICS in a IBM Main frame environment. (I don't want two
programs to access the same database. Don't even give an opportunity
even for two versions of the same program to access the same tables).

4. Message queuing.

5. Interface to other applications, across platforms and sometimes
across corporates (two companies have joined hands and so want their
softwares also to join hands).

6. Load balancing, clustering, distributed computing etc... as per
requirement or may be added in future.

The above list is NOT exhaustive, but these are essential.

The above features are available in a J2EE environment as well as in
M$ environments (though not as robust as in J2EE). Even IBM Z/OS by
means of CICS is able to handle such situations to a great extent.

I have seen people using Linux clustering and other frameworks as the
underlying platform, while using J2EE for their business
implementation. J2EE servers (such as WebSphere, WebLogic, Open Source
JBOSS), take care of the configuration issues (such as load balancing,
etc.,) and they also provide a separation between presentation and
business (Struts and EJB for example - slightly outdated)

Now to my actual question:
----------------------------------
Are there any "neatly packaged" platforms available in Linux which can
handle the above said situations?

-----------------------------------

I can very well use PHP.MVC for the presentation(v1 just released),
write a separate C/C++ program which has a CORBA interface for the
business logic, and connect them together. If some one wants to build
a desktop front end for the business, they can do so using CORBA. But
the process is too cumbersome. It is just not neatly packaged. I am
also not able to find any transaction managers for Linux from Google.
May be I did not use the correct key words.

----------------------
I am not expecting any out of the box answers to the question. But any
constructive discussion is welcome. If you want me to describe any of
the points, please do not hesitate to shoot your questions :-).

PS: My answers will be a little delayed due to  mail accessibility.

Natarajan.

Dear Shakthi,


It is an ethernet interface. I tried both adsl-setup and pppoE.  when i run
"adsl-start" after the adsl/pppoe configuration, i am getting an error as
"time out".

Note: Ehternet connection as none in configuration file (ifcfg-eth1) then=>
ifup eth1 up is working fine.
it fails in "ifup eth1 up"  if it is dhcp connection .

For  a  single system's  broadband connection , is it  require dhcp
connection?

please help me out for the same .

thanks,

We are not anti-M$, so please avoid mentioning the same until and unless 
it is very much a necessity to do so. You can use other terms like 
'non-OSS', 'propreitary' or any such names you wish to mention the same, 
but not offensive in any manner. :)

Hi all,

Here is an intial review of SLED 10 -->
http://madpenguin.org/cms/index.php/?m=show&id=7150&page=1

The New GNOME Interface screenshots looks kewl, i think Novell has
customized the GNOME interface a lot...its a good sign :).

The review is also good.

Hi Natrajan,

I have worked in one such project.
It is a J2EE architecture based application.

The adoption of J2EE architecture can be like this

Client [HTML/CSS compliant browser] ==>
Web tier [PHP running on a Apache server acting as Business delegate] ==>
Axis Web service ==>
Business Tier [ EJBs deployed in a JBoss App Server] ==> Hibernate for OR
mapping ==>
Information Tier [MySQL with InnoDB or Postgres]

The advantage is that you can open up your web services through Axis. Web
services compliant applications can access the needed web service based on
proper authentication.

Hi,

 I too have designed and implemented multiple projects on J2EE with
the said advantages(I worked on Websphere, with my own implementation
of webservices using JAXM, and have used Hibernate and EJBs).

What I am looking for is an alternative to J2EE for this kind of
enterprise applications. As I quoted earlier, I wasn't able to find a
alternative to the framework. Am I missing something somewhere?

Check your settings/values that you give in
adsl-setup. Is your ethernet, eth0 or eth1?

Let adsl-start handle this part. You shouldn't do this
manually.

1) Telnet

telnet x.y.z.w  -- It will ask you user name and passwd

2) Putty - GUI SSH Client for Win.

Can you post the bug messages? Did you get a original copy or a one

The one they ship is desktop intall CD. It can be used as live &
install CD. When we boot, the gui is loaded and we have "Install"
icon. We can double-click the icon to start the installation, and
yeah, it only has gui mode of installation.

To install it from console, I guess you should download the "Alternate
install CD" from www.u.c/download.

You can try going for an architecture based on Python(Business logic),
cheetah(presentation logic) and Postgres (backend). We have
successfully implemented this for a huge intranet portal and it really
rocks. Please have a look at

Never use telnet. It doesn't encrypt data before
transmission. Always use ssh.

Yes, putty with ssh, if you have no other choice.

Subject: [Ilugc] Minutes of Meeting - Jun 08
Message-ID: <4dc6c9040607100039i757531ccsa5bb1c5e7414960f@mail.gmail.com>

Let me summarize the minutes of meeting.

Around 15 of members met in the venue. As it took sometime for
Mr.Umashankar to arrive we discussed about organising the walk. There
has been couple of light comments about the way we co-ordinate this
event. We have plans to invite couple of colleges to participate.
Next, Bhuvan distributed the Ubuntu Tshirts to couple of members.

Next, a member (please update his name) explained about the purpose of
GPLV3. He stated couple of differences betweeen it and its
counterpart. We also discussed about its impact in GNU/Linux
licensing.

Meanwhile, Mr.Umashankar have arrived. Bharathi formally introduced
him to the group and left the stage for him. Mr.Umashankar explained
why he is here and what he expects. He spoke for around 2hrs (?) and
cleared indicated what he expects from the community.

Summary:

1) ELCOT is setting up a call-center to support the staffs of all
Govt. departments. The call center agents will provide support to
them. In case they cant, they will escalate it to the ILUGC volunteer
who may be on call. If he is available, he can attend. If he is not
available, he can send a message so it will be escalated to next
volunteer in queue. The volunteers would be paid for every
successful/unsuccessful call they attend. They are in the process to
building an website specifically for this purpose.
2) ELCOT is planning to setup software development R&D center. It is
expected to be opened during jan 2007 in chennai. He need volunteers
to recruit and train the staffs. The softwares developed by this team
would be used by many Govt. departments and it will be released under
an open source license.
3) He need volunteers across all district headquarters to support the
staffs of the Govt. departments when they face issues.

On hand he had an issue with setting Tamil unicode font for linux. He
needed someone from our group to setup. Shrinivasan volunteered to do
that. Next, he was so happy using opensuse. Couple of Ubuntu fans in
the group suggested him to try as it is very cool. He gladly accepted
it and needed someone from our group to install and configure. Bhuvan
volunteered to do that.

In addition, he also accepted to host monthly/weekly ILUGC meeting at
his premise. He also confirmed to provide coffee and tiffin to all
participants! (As soon as he returned to office it was the first order
he passed)

Finally, Raman acknowledged his requirements and confirmed that ILUGC
would devise a plan to address those needs. He also hinted about the
walk we are planning and we may seek his assistance!

Thats all i can recollect. Please feel free to correct/add more points
if i have missed any. Thank you!

have  u tried JDK1.5? its much faster than earlier version of java.
java needs some good hardware to run. if u have the right hardware i.e
RAM, it will run like anything and better than anything. Every
language has hardware requirements. if u fulfill that, every language
will run properly.

Hi,

Can external people join as mentors ? Also I noticed that, the project has
to be hosted in nrcfoss server only. If the project is already hosted in
some other site, student can't involve in such projects through nrcfoss ?

Thanks
Nagappan

anyone qualified can be a mentor - we *want* external people. He must  
at least mirror his work to our site - we need a way to measure the  
work done.

if they dont know how to code - we dont want them. This is not a  
school to teach coding. Our centre produces world class research, and  
we would want our projects to reflect this. Mentor ship should  
address issues of design, planning, implementation, supplying domain  
knowledge. For example, if the student is doing ERM, we would like a  
kick-ass MBA as mentor

Sigh,

Let me just take this chance to mourn the failure of our GSLV launch. Coupled with yesterday's Agni-III test failure, it seems to be the worst two days in Indian Aviation & Space Research in the last decade...

But, anyway, this should be seen only as a hiccup, and not a heart attack. The next INSAT series will be launched as-usual in French Guyana.

Again, Sigh...

Just curious, are there any examples of this world class research that
we can look at?  As in, I'd like to know if I am up to this, and I'm
sure there are others who are too.

What kind of work?  Crypto?  NLP?  or anything of our choice?  Is this
the first time this is being done?  Details, man ... :)

(I did look at the site, there isn't enough detail there.)

Dear N00B,

If you like to discuss any topics which is not directly connected with 
GNU/Linux or FOSS, then please use a [OT] tag. Perhaps, there is another 
  special ilugc-OT group to discuss non-OSS topics. I wonder you haven't 
yet been flamed :D What you have put is very much an OT considering what 
the mailing list concentrates at :)

you can look at au-kbc.org for details. You can do any work you want,  
but what i was trying to say is that these fellowships are not the  
charitable type - we want to attract the best there is to do the best  
work possible, not run of the mill final year student project kind of  
thing. Or the government 'money is there, lets spend it kind of thing'.

Hi,
 I have  "VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82915G/GV/910GL
Express Chipset Family Graphics Controller (rev 0e)" graphics card.

I find i810 in the driver section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf. But i am not
able to run system-config-display and setup->configurenetwork. I am
currently working only in the command line. I did do yum update and i am
running 2.6.17 kernel.

I guess I have to install  i915-20060309-linux.i386.tar.bz2 to get my
display working as per the site http://www.puzzle.ch/samsung_q35.html.
But i am unable to locate i915 driver for download. If anyone has any
experiences in solving the above problem please help me.

Thanks

I'm surprised Zope has not been mentioned in this thread yet.

Zope is a platform that nails every one of the six requirements you speak
about and much more.  IMO Zope is *the* killer python application and
the best app server I've encountered.  More at zope.org.

Thanks Shakthi!!

 I download the i915 drivers. 

When i compile   i915-20060403-linux.i386 i get the error cannot file
the kernel config file. I had install the kernel-devel package. I had
entered the following path details while installtion. I cross checked
for the existence of the same.

Xorg Dir         : /usr/X11R6
Xorg Modules Dir : /usr/X11R6/lib/modules
Xorg Library Dir : /usr/X11R6/lib

Kernel Version   : 2.6.17-1.2145_FC5smp
Module Directory : /lib/modules/2.6.17-1.2145_FC5smp


The error I got was 

Compiling...
ERROR: Kernel modules did not compile

The DRI drivers can not be installed without the latest kernel modules.
Installation will be aborted. See the dri.log file for information on
what went wrong.


The contents of dri.log

Makefile:173: *** Cannot find a kernel config file.  Stop.

I did try reading the make file. But could not figure things out. Can
someone tell me what a kernel config file is ?? 


Thanks

Check if you have a .config file in your kernel source
directory, probably /usr/src/2.6.17-1.2145_FC5smp/.
Its a hidden file so use "ls -a".

> The DRI drivers can not be installed without the

1. You need to have a .config file in the sources
directory. You can do "make oldconfig" to create the
.config file or do "make menuconfig" and then exit,
save to save the current configuration to a .config
file in the kernel sources directory.

2. The kernel sources should have been compiled, with
the modules installed at /lib/modules.

> Makefile:173: *** Cannot find a kernel config file.

Lack of .config file.

When you are compiling a driver module, you are
compiling and linking against kernel objects (which
should exist). 

Its like compiling a user-application against glibc
headers.

Hi Shakthi,
 I have a .config file in /boot
and /usr/src/kernels/2.6.17-1.2145_FC5-i686/


But I wonder why the install.sh is not able to find it. All paths have
be correct entered and verified.

How do i verify this ? I dont know if thinks the kernel is compiled with
all modules in /lib/modules. I did yum update, which i guess should have
compiled the kernels with /lib/modules.

I guess it is more a problem of not locating the config file. 
Will creating a copy of the config file in some other directories
help ?

Check the install.sh script to see where it is looking
for the .config file.

Probably, you can pass an argument to the script
indicating where the kernel sources are located.

If you use Ubuntu dapper, the i915 driver is just an apt-get away:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/i915Driver

I am sure the same exists for your distro too.

sorry to disagree - zope and plone are great platforms, as long as  
you stay within their parameters, once you start customising them,  
you are in trouble - especially if you want to build your app on an  
exterrnal rdbms which can be accessed by other applications.

Thanks everyone for the inputs.

I will do some homework (perhaps some PoCs) on Django, RoR, the trio
combination as presented by Mr. Senthil Kumaran and Zope, before I
start commenting on these. I had already been introduced to RoR, but
didn't know about its seriousness.

It is good to note that there are some good alternatives to J2EE and
.NET in the Open Market.

May be I am not fully right, but, I do find J2EE offering better
environment for the enterprise applications than the others. This may
be due to the wide spread patronage of the architecture. I am saying
this purely on the initial impressions that I got from the homepages.

Thanks once again for the inputs that I got.

With regards,
Natarajan.

just that it is not free - and all the big companies have huge  
investment in Java manpower, so they recommend it, not so much  
because it is better, but because it is what they are good at.

It went like this:

SLV - sea launch vehicle
ASLV - another sea launch vehicle
PSLV (was yet to be launched at that time -late 80s) probably sea launch vehicle

Jokes apart, a rocket is one of the most complex of systems ever built
by human beings and any one of a billion things going wrong could
wreck it. In fact our space department has been doing a commendable
job (considering the budget it has at its disposal) and this incident
is just a stepping stone. Remember, NASA has its own share of failures
too (even with their budgets)!

As and when you type the php script, emacs indents it automatically.
If you want to indent an existing script, select the region (maybe the
whole buffer: `C-x h') and use indent-region (bound to C-` in my
setup, i am not sure if this is the default)

it moves on...

I want to use gnus as email client to access my gmail account using
pop3. I have the following in my config file (.gnus.el)

<snip>
(setq gnus-select-method '(nntp "news.gnus.org"))
(add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnml ""))
(setq mail-sources '((pop :server "pop.gmail.com"

(setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
(setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)

But when I try starting gnus it is unable to fetch my mails. What is

The above lines is nothing but if you have an existing code in php and
wants to indent that code, then you have to open the file where the
code is and use the keys `C-x h', so that the whole file is marked.
Then use `M-x indent-region' which will indent the whole php file
(most accurately the buffer) which has the php code.

Just had a look at one of the centre's research project (I am not sure if
its world class).
http://au-kbc.org/research_areas/nlp/projects/sengine.html

This page talks about creating a search engine for tamil. Already google is
there and we can do searching using unicode tamil (or any other encoding -
but our google interface should be changed accordingly to show the encoding
correctly ). I find google does this job very effectively.
For example,
You please enter this tamil text ??????????? (just cut and paste) in your
google search and enter.
You will find more than 30K search results coming for thirukural !!!!

If the centre is planning to do something more efficient than google search
for tamil then we can appreciate it. In that case the project page should
atleast mention how its going to be better than existing google tamil text
search.
Or the centre can reuse opensoure Nutch project(
http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/) to produce a better tamil search.

Is there any projects/products of this centre released to the public use ?
if so can somebody give some pointers to it.

Mugunth

gmail has pop3 + ssl (different port)

it has smtp auth + ssl (again you need to enable ssl + login / passwd 
credentials)

.gnus.el:
(eval-after-load "mail-source" '(require 'pop3)) ;; pop3 with ssl support

(setq pop3-debug t)

(setq user-full-name "Name")

              :connection ssl

so far the centre is only doing closed source work. And as with all  
closed source work, duplication takes place all the time. That is why  
we are working on releasing some of the work as open source. And also  
on developing things in open source in the full glare of publicity as  
this will help doing effective work and also avoid duplication

ps are you coming for the translation workshop?

The USP of this search engine (Kazhugu) is the ability
to search content in 24 major encodings.
Tamil content on the web is in 50 different encodings.
(unicode being only a minor subset)
Google can search Unicode content only.

Watch out this list for announcements on releases.
Tamil Wordnet being one of them.

Hi All

some basic configuration .

Thanks & Regards

for indenting to work well with an existing php script, you will need
php-mode anyway... but since you say that indent-region worked well
for you, either php-mode is already installed, or you haven't got the
best possible results :)

Normally lspci is in /sbin/ dir. AFAIK, It is not the part of busybox. 
It is from pciutils tools. Copy the lspci command from PPC Toolchain 
to your PPC filesystem.

Vanilla gnus/gnus shipped with Emacs in CVS doesn't come with ssl
support, or atleast didn't some time back (I haven't seen pop3.el from
the CVS HEAD of late). A version of gnus, called T-Gnus has support
for ssl (apart from other pop3 features like uidl). See this page:

methods?

well... u will need a primary select method for gnus to work in the
first place! from the config file u included initially, ur primary
method is (nntp "news.gnus.org"), which is indeed a news server. looks
to me that it is the trouble maker. if you don't want that, you can
remove it and make (nnml "") the primary method...

it moves on...

Hi Claus.Gindhart

I am facing some problem in applying the patch.

I have copied the pacth to a file "patch-pciutils"

[root@localhost pciutils-2.1.11]# file patch-pciutils
patch-pciutils: 'diff' output text
[root@localhost pciutils-2.1.11]#
when i gave the command :
[root@localhost pciutils-2.1.11]# patch -p1 patch-pciutils
.
.
Nothing happens even after 3/4 minutes...so i am stopping it by ctrl+c.
None of the files are edited.

In the patch u sent , let me know wether it is complete one or configure 
file is left as it is after the lines
c=config.h
echo >$c "#define ARCH_`echo $cpu | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'`"

Thanks & Regards
Rahul

I ve set the above in my config file. I have a doubt whether if we set
the above parameter once will it remain unchanged forever, ie whether
it will be cached somewhere so that we should explicitly reset it
rather than setq each time gnus is loaded. I get the same error
still...

I ve pasted my .gnus.el file here
http://paste.lisp.org/display/22398

Now when I start gnus it asks for my gmail password and then gets in
but it stands still and am unable to do anything after that.

This is shown in my status bar

1. I hope there is no problem with the network, and that gmail is
accessible without a proxy.
2. See if the pop3.el which is getting loaded is the one you
downloaded and not the one from gnus... use `M-x find-library pop3' to
see the full path. If it points to the gnus thing, put your source in
some other folder of yours, say, ~/.emacs.d/shadow and insert `(setq
load-path (cons "~/.emacs.d/shadow" load-path))' in ur .emacs.

it moves on...

it would be unfair to blame linux for "new concepts" like package
manager, or symlinks, or X server. for a grandmother will be as
confused with those as Start Menu, Folder, or Run dialog or Control
Panel. not a hobbyist or someone passionate, but every1 who is first
introduced to a comp, with Windows, has to get used to it. it is just
that the terminology is different in linux, and had you started off
your comp life with Linux, you would have found shifting to Windows as
difficult. that's something we got to leave.

it moves on...

PS: ubuntu asked that guy to restart? :O

i agree with ramkumar.. i started using computers with windows (From windows
3.1 till XP).. when i thought of shifting to linux, i came across various
difficulties. When i think me as a normal user, i would have decided to not
use linux since i need to learn more new concepts.. But, as a developer, i
decided to learn and adapt and facinated by the GNU, GPL principles. and
eventually skipped Windows..

It took more time for me to shift from windows to Linux. for a novice user,
switching to linux takes some more time. But, I recently heard about my
friends who started using computers with GNU/Linux loaded.. impossible..
they dont like to work in windows.. and can easily differentiate the powers
of linux over windows..

So, the only way to stop comments that Linux is difficult is to "ask the
people who not even touched the computer to start working on linux".. like
grandpa and grandma..

More than me, here there will be many guys who started working on computers
with GNU/Linux.. Ur opinions will be better than me..

Message-ID: <1621.61.247.255.57.1152622104.squirrel@www.songbirdtech.com>

Hi,

I have just attended the Free (Libre) Software Meeting held at Nancy, France.

http://www.rmll.info/rub_1?lang=en

This is an annual meeting of free software developers and experts from
across the globe.

I presented seminars on free software usage for patient and healthcare
data privacy and security for the EU member states. We were also able to
showcase some of the software currently under development for the
monitoring of chronic diseases in India.

I was able to meet many of the primary developers of many interesting
F/LOSS software including:
- GDL - GNU Data Language
- R - Another language used for statistical studies
- Octave - An application growing more and more similar to Mathlab
- MedInTux - An excellent healthcare product developed by a very small team
- Zope 3
- TurboGears - A Python application framework
- RoR
- LinBox - Linux directory service
- ObjectWeb - JAVA Middleware
- GoSA2 - A package for managing directory services including LDAP
- TinyERP
- RoseGarden - An audio authoring / composing tool.
- Blender - An excellent tutorial was presented
- NetBSD - one of the primary maintainers was available.
- OpenBSD
- OpenWengo

I was somewhat disappointed with the lacklustre show from India
considering that F/LOSS software is used a lot here. I was only one of two
Indians to participate in any capacity in this conference. The other
Indian and I were team members and we presented some of the seminars
together - he is a physician.

It may be interesting to look at why India doesn't contribute as much to
F/LOSS as might be expected.

Friends.

Just now I installed ubuntu successfully.

Thanks for aanjan. I got a CD burned by him at IITM last saturday.

Previously i got some installation problem.
As one of my partition got some problems, it failed.

After removed the partition and repartitioning, it installed smoothly.

Thanks for buvan for his valuable suggestions on partitions.

and it looks nice.

I have a doubt.

I download a lot of packages from net by synaptec.
As i give the ubuntu cd for my friends, who do not have net connection.

Is there anyway to copy those packages from my pc to them?
In synaptec, i choosed the option not to delete the files after downloading.
where will they be? ccan i use them for other systems?

Thanks.
dear,
T.Shrinivasan.

these files would be in /var/cache/apt/archives

you could manually copy these files to your friends system and try to
install them using dpkg. `dpkg -i <file>'

As for your specific requirement, there is work in progress (the first
line will probably solve your needs but it is a little complex as of now):

However, if they still maintain a level of Debian compatibility,
dpkg-scanpackages is the way to go. It generates a Packages file,
which can be combined with APT to do the dependency work.

Is it not possible to put the local location in the sources.list and do apt
update and then install those packages? . I have done this via Smart where i
have new packages in my /usr/src/yoper/RPMS/ and add this to smart
channels.Once i do smart update, then do smart upgrade, it will install. If
this fits in for apt too, then it is much easier :)

I can take up PostgreSQL.

When php etc are included, we can look at html and web pages creation also.

I think ClusterKnoppix is a live CD. Though it is based on OpenMosix
clustering Solution.
So better if you install openMosix patch to your kernel. 2.6 kernel version
is still in developing stage.So the stable version is You need 2.4.26 kernel
with open mosix patch.I have tested and it works fine.

Hi Claus.Gindhart

Thanks for patch.
I have tried the same and could do it.
I have modified the lib/configure file manually and gave the following 
command
#make  CC=powerpc-linux-gcc
I could get the lspci, setpci commands.
Need to test this with my target board. Let you know after testing.


But when i tried with applying patch directly.. i got the following error:
[root@localhost pciutils-2.1.11]# patch -p1 < patch-pciutils
patching file lib/configure
Hunk #1 FAILED at 12.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file lib/configure.rej
[root@localhost pciutils-2.1.11]#
I have just copy pasted the patch from my mail and tried.

Thanks & Regards
Sudheer

apt does not look at the packages (debs) themselves.  It looks for the
Packages(.gz) index file.  As Kumar suggested, you need to use
dpkg-scanpackages to create it.  There are subtle issues with versioning
etc that you can run into if you are not careful.  dpkg-scanpackages is
really for advanced users (and people who have an affection towards man
pages!)

To the OP:  copying your *.deb files into your friends
/var/cache/apt/archives and then running apt/synaptic should work.  If the
debs are found in the said directory, apt will not attempt to download the
files again.  However, you still need to run the equivalent of "apt-get update"
first.  You don't need to run dpkg-scanpackages if you do it this way.

If you don't want to copy the debs to /var/cache/apt/archives, you can
set the Dir::Cache::Archives config item appropriately.  I think this can
specified on the cmd line for one-off runs, but I've never done it this
way.  I'm interested in knowing if this works for you.

On Debian, /usr/share/doc-base/apt-offline-usage-guide would be a good
read.

The OP's friend apparently doesn't have a net connection :-( so running
`apt-get update' is out of question.

I read an article about a web search engine that is developed by IIIT
which searches indian languages content. probably u could see that in
economic times. i think developing kazhugu is reinventing?

take a look at it in todays economic times

not really - we want to put some customised stuff up, so it is easier  
and quicker to write our own than to adapt something else. The  
customised stuff is in perl and python - which makes it a little  
difficult to interface with php - cleaner to do the whole thing in  
python

If ur program is "prog.pl" and run it like "perl prog.pl", try using 
"time perlprog.pl".

Hello everybody:
The multiple contacts are bound to be there. However, we can have a tacit
in-house understanding. Depending on the stature of the College persons and
the time-availability of the LUG guys [why no gals?], we can allow one of
our group to take the lead -- often one dealing with the topmost person.
Sometimes, it is difficult to get the top guy regularly -- so you get an
intro to the 'active contacts' in the college and work thru them.

e.g., in Arunai, to get the goahead you should speak to the Chairman [since
Mr. Velu has become Food Minister, his son has taken over], but for getting
things done you have to talk to the PRO Suresh. In many colleges it is
Chairman or Director, rarely it is the Principal and for getting things
actually done, we have to keep the HoD CSE or IT (which one?).

As for Jaya Engg, Aanjhan can apprise the Chairman, bring Kumaran into the
picture and then Shakthi-Kumaran combine can take over. [this is just a
suggestion -- please do as you guys deem fit]. The Principal is originally
from MIT (Mech Engg) and if anything is needed from him, we can talk to him.

Because of the NRCFOSS training  -- and our mandate to push in the elective
-- we are in regular touch with a large no of colleges / teachers. My
earlier stint at Arunai adds more members to this pool -- during my stay
around 20 lecturers resigned and went to different colleges . I have been
coaxing the colleges to conduct LDDs / workshop to create awareness.

I will do the following : do some initial interactions (mostly thru our
au-kbc mails) -- keep Parthan in the picture and once the date/program is
fixed, let him take over. Please keep in mind that many colleges would like
to have some 'VIP(!)' presence to inaugurate the show. I will try to do my
bit in the background -- whether initiated thru NRCFOSS or directly thru
LUG.

With best wishes, Srinivasan.

use the std c lib function `time' at the beginning and end of the
program and subtract the values to get the time taken...

Towards the end of the last meet at IIT-M, we had a small chit chat
where some one (if I am not wrong, it was Toufeeq and a few others)
offered to give a talk on PHP, while I can take up JavaScript. I am in
the process of preparing the slides. If someone can fix the dates... I
will be more than glad to share my 2 cents... How about the first or
second week of Aug? (Am under the assumption that the first two GLVs
will be taken up for newbie sessions at ELCOT).

This will not work.. i have tried time() function of C. It will not come up
to nanosecond precision because it returns time_t short int..
use clock function, it will give the processing time..or times() function..
many other alternatives are there.. google on..

it moves on...

You could put your command into time{command}.

For example,
*time { ./configure ... && make && make install; }*.

Dear ILUGC,

After Mr.Thyagarajan's talk and Shakthi's demo, I spent some time with
Debian Sarge, trying to get Indian languages to work. I wanted to
inform you that upon installing the package tamil-gtk2im and following
the readme in the package, Tamil works flawlessly on GTK based
applications, including Mozilla Firefox. The key is bound, by default,
to double shift (meaning press both shift keys together).

So, do try it out. Also, it'd be nice if someone could test Suse and
Fedora Core, as they are also bound to have this feature.

??? Debian Sarge????? ??????? ???? ??????? ???????????!

HTH. The advice was from the Debian developer, R.Ganesan.

What do you mean by `time' will not work? Every timing function has
it's precision, and for the function I gave, it was one second. The OP
had never given any idea of the precision needed, and hence I
preferred the most portable one. There are many other functions which
allow for more accurate representations but at the cost of
portability. for eg. many versions of FreeBSD do not conform to the
SUSv2 spec for the `clock' function you specified. Secondly,
representations upto a nanosecond (like struct timespec) never
guaranteed you a nanosecond precision. Various functions allow you to
get timing details as accurate as the OS can allow, but the precisions
reached are rarely to a nanosecond. These precision depend on the OS
and the hardware which form the clock sources for the OS.

it moves on...

You can find good info about Debian starting from here
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian and then going into their site

Think we got a lot of mails, starting with me, that they are ready to 
handle PHP. Think we have too many people opting for PHP, Perl and not 
for other topics. Think we should run into a consensus regarding PHP, 
selecting one among us and others taking up other topics which they are 
comfortable with.

Quite odd this time, we have more number of (physical) volunteers ready 
to take part. People, we have more n more LDDs coming up and we would be 
happy if the same physical representation is available for them too ;)

There should be no _single_ point of contact. I'll
tell you why.

Singapore LUG, for example, has elections and office
bearers. So, you hold a position for a year. 

But, in a year you might have lot of work that might
coincide with the time of LDDs. So, you may not be
able to do justice to both. Instead, if you keep the
contacts floating and use the mailing list as a point
of contact, whoever is available during the LDD time
_and_ willing to participate can contribute. The
probability of not getting someone is much less.

This has worked for many of our ILUGC members. There
were times when we did two workshops on a single day
by splitting our work.

You can approach the top guy as a AU-KBC or NRC-FOSS
member. As an individual, I can only contact
faculty/students and ask them to get permission in
their college for workshops - whatever be the
formalities.

And its easier to contact students/faculty through
e-mail/phone than the college management, from my
experience.

These things should change. As an NRC-FOSS, AU-KBC
person, I am sure you guys have the power to change
such things.

It is the students' show. Let one of their own
inaugurate it.

For all the hard-work that Arunai Engineering College
students put it, I really wanted one of their own to
inaugurate it.

Count me for JavaScript :-)

If any one has specific needs, then it will be easier for experienced
people to chip in their knowledge.

I think to improve the effeciency of Knowledge sharing, it will be
better that people request for their specific needs. Manytimes, people
who know the topic will not be knowing that what they know is worth a
session in GLV :-)

Why not start a threat for "Sessions" requests?? If Wiki is working,
we can have a page similar to CDs for grab and have "Sessions on
Request"....

I guess... am one of the oldest volunteers in the group, though not
quite active :-). I have made only a few visits to the meetings..
(starting from 2001 onwards...)

Hi Guys,
 This is for those people who are interested in making money through
adsense. There are lot of useful tools (for adsense) that many of us can
share with others. I use google analytics and some other webpages like
http://www.yourcache.com/ to keep in track of my progress.

 May be we all can meet sometime and discuss more about adsense.

Seems like July will be difficult for the LDD of the AEC format(2
day). Lots of work needs to be done. This is what I heard from Mr.

Hi All,
Sorry for not able to follow this thread quickly.

Regarding remington keyboard, I am not aware of it.
If Shrinivasan or someone who has gone to ELCOT can get the exact layout we
can hack tamil-gtk2im and creat a remington keyboard out of it.

anyone can send mail to the list admin with ANY from address. would you

should have received it already. so, someone could play a prank on you by 
unsubscribing you from the list and i have no way to tell if the request

these are not chain emails. ilugc is a legitimate mailing list that has 
been in existance for about 8 years now.

first off, dont issue such meaningless threats. i would have been happy to 
unsubscribe you once i have established the genuineness of your request. 
but if you want to issue such threats, i am not inclined to do so. you may 
unsubscribe yourself. go ahead and talk to your IT person. perhaps, your 
IT person can make more sense of this mail and explain to you what is 
happening.

> According to my knowledge i know that i havn't give my email id in any

perhaps, this email id was earlier used by someone else (who subscribed to 
this list)? you cannot get on this mailing list by giving your email id 
anywhere. there is one and only one way to get on this list. you have to 
first make a request (by mail or through the web); in response to this 
request, you will receive a confirmation request stating that a request to 
subscribe has been received and subscription to the list will be effected 
only if you reply to this confirmation request. so, it is not possible for 
anyone to subscribe you without your knowledge. perhaps, an earlier owner 
of this id was subscribed to the list - but then the account became 
inactive or was disabled, causing mails to bounce. as a courtesy to list 
members, we periodically re-activate bouncing mail addresses and if they 
continue to bounce, the addresses are deleted from the subscriber list. in 
your case, it would appear that the account was only temporarily bouncing, 
so mail service has resumed.

you have already been told several times how to do it - go to the web  
interface of the mailing list and unsubscribe there. If you dont know  
the password, ask for it, it will be mailed to you. Or hire someone  
to do it for you

And your incompetence in signing up to a mailing list and not knowing 
how to unsubscribe from it doesnt put your company's "security" at risk?

My 2 Cents: Why dont you talk to your "IT Person" and ask him/her to
conduct a "Extensive Crash" Course for you on email usage?

Friends.

In the following file, we can see all the tamil layout options.
/etc/X11/xkb/symbols/tml

so we need to create on e section as

default partial alphanumeric_keys
xkb_symbols "TYPEWRITER" {

> http://www.tamilnation.org/digital/tamilnet99/tamilnet99report.htm#Typewriter%20Keyboard

I hope tamil gurus can do this easily.

I also tried to edit the file.
 But dont know how to get those hexa decimal values for key strokes.

so please create such a section in that file.

or any other ways are there?

Thank you,
T.Shrinivasan.

Thanks for lot of volunteers for the sessions. As GLV is a continuous
process, any number of volunteers are welcome.

Bharati and I will goto ELCOT, make arrangement for PCs, projector
etc, and also ask MD/ELCTO to assign a  local co-ordinator, so that
sessions will go on smoothly. Time is too short to commence from this
weekend.

Hence, the GLV session will start from 22 Jul 2006.

I will post the updated course schedule and volunteers for the same
in few days time. More suggestions and more volunteers welcome.

Raman.P

Hi All,

I have an application, which send/receive ethernet packets to/from an
another PC thru socket(PF_INET, SOCK_PACKET, ETH_P_ALL) and interface
is in promiscouse mode. Locally generated Ethernet packets are filled
with different src MAC (vaild) addresses.

The probelm is, in my receivce I see packets, which I pushed into the
interface. Is it possible to avoid the dublication/loopback?

It would have been done if you had been polite.

80 % of the people wouldn't want to help idiots. But a 20 % do.
Even those 20 % wouldn't want to help an idiot who is also arrogant.

You may get some help from a  group of volunteers if you have HIV.
In addition to HIV you also have plaque - very difficult to help you.

Suffer both the lessons.

Subject: [Ilugc] help regarding powerpc and vga card
Message-ID: <44B6077E.9090004@gmail.com>

Hello All

I am working on a  powerpc board. I have placed the board on a PCI 
backplane and connected a PCI VGA card to the same. PCI enumuration from 
u-boot does not detect my VGA card whereas it detects other cards like 
ethernet in the same slot.

The VGA card details are as follows.

Vendor ID=0x1002 Device ID= 0x4752
Name: ATI Technologies Inc Rage XL

The VGA card is universal compatible. It is working with X86 PC.

In my target system , I have tested adding the vendor id and and device 
id in the u-boot/include/pci_ids.h and declared   the pci_device_id 
structure
in  a new  header file. uboot/include/vga_ragexl.h   . Even then card is 
not getting detected.

Anyone please help me if i am missing anything.

Thanks & Regards

FYI: Yday Mr Kumaran spoke to me. He asked, "Howto start the
preparation for LDD?". I gave the following tips:

1. Get the permission from the Mng.
2. Select 2 or 3 dates for LDD.
3. Fund allocation for Advt and logistics.
4. Form the local volunteer team, try to teach them the basics of the 
   GNU/Linux System.
5. For Adv topics, some of our ILUGC Members will help in training.
6. The Show is going to be managed by your Team. ILUGC team help in 
   this process.
7. Once dates list is prepared, Catch us to finalize the dates.

He said, "LDD on Sat & Sun may not work out. We are planning to 
conduct Fri and Sat".

From:   Ramesh Elamathi <rameshelamathi@yahoo.com>


Hello sir,

I am Elamathi, a reporter working in a small town in Southern India and
a user of Linux (not Ubunutu, though i have a Live CD) for a few years.

Linux is simply great. Let me come to the topic directly. The Tamil Nadu
government (A State in India) has introduced linux to the Plus I, that
is called higher secondary level-I.
The syllabus also has windows XP . But *linux has been given
importance*. The other part of the syllabus is Star Office and C. The
Plus II, the second level in higher secondary, has C++ and Star Office
in detail.

Simply it means, the s*tudnets need not to have work C, C++ and Star
Office in Windows environment*. All these are open source based, linux
oriented. Hence, the syllabus is basically oriented towards Linux.

Just one computer with Windows XP is enough to learn it.
The *rest of the syllabus can be taught in Linux* machines. That meens,
thousands of schools in the State, if we take initiative and are able to
pull it, can be converted to linux.

Sadly, there are no support or men to press this to the government or
even in one school. Ironically, the *Microsoft and Intel* have come up
with a lot of programmes, and *converting the students* to Windows oriented.

Let me describe how we can capitilise this situation and *popularise
linux*, particularly *Edubuntu* <http://www.edubuntu.org/> through a
district i am living. Salem (not the one in the US) district has more
than 2000 schools. Of which 60 schools teach computer science as subject
professionally. Each school has 10 computers.Though now they are having
old hardware, they are soon going get upgraded.

The *government *or other agencies are *not *able to *supply* software,
i mean *Linux *to these schools.
If we can provide *Edubuntu* <http://www.edubuntu.org/> to all these 60
schools, no body is going to oppose. It will *not take a long time to
get government permission*. If we can explain it to the secretary of the
school education and get permission first for one district, it can be
implemented easily throughout the state.

I can explain you more sir. Even i have worked out a chart (or a road
map) on how we can implement it.

If we explain that the *Edubuntu* <http://www.edubuntu.org/> has *tools
to programme in C and C++* and once you show the source code, all the
*students will be excited* to know it. Now, many students here have no
clue what is linux.

Sir, if you are *interested*, i am *ready to explain* this concept
*further*.
And please forgive me for the spelling mistakes and the informal way i
have written this e-mail.

Regards
Elamathi

extension on them. This initializes the card after POST - basically,
the motherboard BIOS transfers control to the BIOS on the
PCI VGA card, which then initializes itself. If control is not
transfered to the VGA BIOS on the card, the VGA controller
stays isolated and will not respond to PCI device enumeration,
etc. This is actually part of the PC-98 spec., which allows
multiple VGA controllers to co-exist on the PCI and/or AGP
bus.

   On a PowerPC system, the ROMscan BIOS cannot execute
(because it has x86 instructions in it), so there will be an alternate
way to initialize the VGA controller so that it can respond to the
PCI enumeration, etc. However, that method will be card/controller
specific - neither the card manufacturer nor ATI may ever have
released the specs for how this is done. Usually, it will be through
hidden memory-mapped IO (MMIO) registers on the VGA controller
chip, but there are numerous proprietary ways to implement this,
most of it being undocumented or controller-specific.

(Lots of things are taken for granted in the x86 PC world, which
are actually very complex and difficult-to-implement protocols.
That's one of the reasons why all the alternative PC processor
architectures have failed over the last 20 years).

Folks,
         FWIW, both VMware server as well as M$ Virtual PC
are free-as-in-free-beer downloads starting this week. You may
have to register and provide some info, and you get free
license keys.

http://www.vmware.com/download/server/

http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtualpc/default.mspx

The VMware server runs either on a Windows or a Linux box,
and allows multiple Windows or Linux clients. OTOH, the
Virtual PC only runs on a few M$ OSes like XP Pro, XP Server,
etc.

These provide full-virtualization layers, unlike the paravirtualization
hypervisor approach taken by Xen (which will not run any client OS
except specially-ported kernels).

Give VMware a try, it allows multiple Linux clients, which is great
for virtual hosting and other similar stuff.

Since, PCI is working fine with u-boot, you can write
a stand-alone main() routine to be run by u-boot to
read the PCI configuration space for the VGA card.
Check if you can read the vendor ID/device ID and that
the VGA controller is responding. If it works, you are
probably missing some configuration with u-boot for
your device.

VMPlayer has been free for use for many months now.  VMPlayer
has the same virtualization technology as VMWare Server, but
the user interface is simplistic.  VMPlayer also supported Intel
VT before VMWare Server, and is a 10 x smaller download (25MB).

Originally VMPlayer was intended to only run VMs created with
other VMWare products, but sites like www.easyvmx.com made
it possible to create VMs for free.  I'm yet to out growVMPlayer
and switch to VMWare Server.

I have not tried Virtual PC and would appreciate any comments.

I would gladly recommend everyone to give virtualization a go.
Having a VM is handy when you want to test different OSes or
create "clean room" development or demo environments.  I have
VMs for OpenSolaris, Debian, Win2k, Free/Open BSD on my
development box.

Again, don't put your company's "security" at risk by giving free email lessons.

Better luck next time in using your email for what you really intended to.

   Yup, I'll second this. Somebody also needs to tell Elcot to drop
their IBM mainframe purchase for running Linux/S390 in VMs and
go with x86 server clusters running Linux/x86 guests in VMware
instead. They can even benchmark and test this inexpensively
with free licenses - a Dell SC430 dual-core at Rs.18k should be
enough to get started on the HW side.

I have tried this option writing a small code in u-boot/common/cmd_pci.c
The code is below.

for(Device = 0; Device <32; Device++){
        printf("\ndevice %d", Device);
         for(Function =0;Function <8;Function++){
            dev = PCI_BDF(BusNum, Device, Function);
            pci_read_config_word(dev, PCI_VENDOR_ID, &VendorID);
            if (VendorID != 0xFFFF){
                    printf("\nFound PCI device %02x.%02x.%02x:    ",  
BusNum, Device, Function);
                    printf("vendor id 0x%x",VendorID);
            }
        }
    }
Even then the card couldn't get detect.

Thanks for your information.
Could anyone please suggest me which  vga card i need to buy so that it 
can be supported
 with powerpc boards and available in the market. Or can i have any 
other alternative solution .

So, does this print when you use the ethernet card on
the PCI slot? 

If yes, then Sivasankar's post on VGA controller
initialisation helps.

I have a doubt here. How does the processor know that the card  sitting 
here is a vga card
and control should be transfered to initialize it.  I think it can know 
that it is a vga card only by reading the config space .
And bios is necesary for vga card to work in its normal way. Is it 
necesary for bios to be initialised to get detected.
Please correct me if i am wrong.

I am not very sure, but here are my thoughts. IBM Z Series'
virtualization is, called as an
LPAR(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPAR). Though the virtualization is
full virtualization, but, I personally found, through  reports from
friends who actually did a performance analysis by deploying more than
1000 instances of Linux kernal, back in 2003, on a single Z/Server, in
addition to the Z/OS and other environments already running, that
IBM's virtualization is in fact, much better in terms of performances.

I think the packaging is what makes it more attractive. You can simply
go ahead and pull out two SMPS, 10 hard drives, one set of RAM and One
Air conditioning Unit out of the server and the server still runs
without a hitch (no restarting). This might sound familiar to those
who have attended Mr. Mark Dalton's session on SATA Hard disks, Blade
servers and Cray Super
computers(http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/Mark_Daltons_talk_-_Cray_XD1%2C_SATA%2C_Volume_management%2C_filesystems).

For an enterprise server for the size of TamilNadu (entire database
and ALL applications of ALL departments), I will not buy your
suggestion. The servers for such huge applications with 24x7
availability should be stored in specialized data centers, with
specialized cooling equipments built into them. I don't think you can
get that kind of cooling for an array of servers, and that can run for
months, if not for years, without restarting, for a mere 18,000
rupees..... I doubt, if enterprises like Tamil Nadu (with so much of
bureaucracy), will be ready/able to do such experiments, and draw
conclusions from their own experiments. They will surely buy the
solution, if already made by others and published. Perhaps DELL
themselves should do the experiment and sell the solution to TN.

Please correct me where I have misunderstood the requirements.

Natarajan.

Subject: [Ilugc] Doubt with Calling/Deeveloping OSS
Message-ID: <44B7C458.9030801@gmail.com>

Hello,
I ended up having a doubt about calling something OSS and using some 
widely available OS tools to build something whose source code you don't 
release. This is an advent of participating in a demonstration of a 
software package which is made 90% using OSS like PostgreSQL, etc. but 
the source code is not given along with.

Case Points:
1. The software uses many Open Source Tools available widely for use, 
example: PostgreSQL, Python etc.

2. The software openly declares it is making use of OSS fully.

3. The developer accepts he hasn't done any significant 'value-addition' 
to the individual sofwares he used as well as the combination of them.

4. Though he uses OSS for his overall development, he doesn't to release 
the source code. He intelligently never terms the software to be OSS, 
rather just says he is using 100% OSS and tools.

5. The sodtware is priced at an acceptable price suitable for Indian 
medium and small scale industries, mainly because all the pieces which 
make up the software as a whole is available free as in 'beer'

My questions are:

1. If someone is going to use some Open Source Tool and develop 
something (which he accepts doesnt have much value addition), is it 
right to hide the source code from the users who pay and buy the software ?

2. Though having a price tag is not opposed OSS, but restricting the 
main freedom to have source code, is it not condemnable ??

3. Isn't it ethically wrong to make use of OSS and in return give 
nothing to the OSS ?? :-S :(

Lol. Come on, do people really subscribe to these lop-sided views? It's 
really sad to see ILUGC's mailing list being used to spew RMS' communist 
propaganda. He might very well have done a lot for 'software freedom' 
(as in beer and speech), but this is a very broad generalization, aimed 
at nothing but to smear. Observe the first passage - explain a lot about 
all the bad things governments do, and throw in the word "corporations" 
in there, and now it's all the corporations' fault. Accusation by 
attribution. Clever.

Sure, there maybe some evil corporations (some oil and pharma companies 
for example), but there are lot many good corporations. Statements like 
"corporations are bad" are a very slippery slope, and not all of them 
aim to global domination and making puppets of governments. There's 
another side to this - we elect such easily corruptible politicians. Now 
who's to be blamed?

The source code for all those is gettable from the ftp site for those 
software

I am reasonably sure there's a copy of the GPL included somewhere in 
that software?

It is not like he's taking a redhat cd, doing %s/redhat/foo/ and selling 
it as "foo"?

If that is the case and if its good quality - then it sounds good enough 
not for you to waste time battling with your conscience over a license war.

As for "not doing much work" - it is tougher than you think to make a 
useful package that seamlessly integrates all the tools you mention, 
plus makes it work as designed, with a user interface that manages 
configs seamlessly, etc etc.

There are lots of mailserver + junk filtering appliances like for

   The processor (in an x86 PC) doesn't actually know that there's
a VGA controller in that PCI slot. However, the VGA ROM BIOS
is in a well-known range - usually 0xC0000 upwards. The PC ROM
BIOS does a quick presence check to see if there's a valid ROM
extension at 0xC0000, does a checksum and then just transfers
control to 0xC0000. At this point, the VGA ROM BIOS gets
control and does everything to initialize the VGA controller and
make it respond to PCI bus activity. Then it returns control to
PC ROM BIOS, which then repeats the exercise for other
memory ranges, like 0xD0000, etc. (where there may be other
ROM extensions, like a Network Boot ROM on a LAN card, etc.)

 I think it can know

  Remember, an x86 PC with any PCI VGA card still works fine with
an OS like MS-DOS-3.3, which knows nothing about PCI - it was
written before the PCI spec was developed. A VGA card must
work correctly in some default mode, with a text-mode character
buffer at a well-known MMIO range, and functioning ASCII-to-
character glyph mapping. All this is taken care off by the VGA BIOS
ROM sitting on the VGA card - which initializes the controller to
the default text mode when it gets control after POST. That's
also the reason that the very first visible text message that you
see on powering up a PC is from the VGA BIOS, not the
motherboard ROM BIOS.

The reason for the VGA controller on an add-in PCI card to remain
inactive on POST, until it is initialized, is simple: there may be multiple
PCI VGA cards, and there would be bus contention for the text buffer
if they all initialized themselves to active on say, the reset signal. Also,
many boards have on-board integrated VGA (like the i810), and there
has to be a way of over-riding the off-board VGA(s) and leaving them
inactive, if so desired.

     Back in the hoary old days of PREP and CHRP (IBM specifications
for PCs with PowerPC CPUs) reference implementations, there were
a handful of S3 cards which were supported by the PREP ROM
itself. However, you may want to ask the developer of the PowerPC
board about which VGA controllers are initialized correctly by the
PowerPC ROM BIOS code alone.

Running linux on linux for application/domain isolation does not
require full-virtualization layers as provided by VMWare/Xen.  The
RAM overhead of simultaneously running multiple OSes is just
too much.

Linux VServer (http://linux-vserver.org/) provides Solaris 10 Zones
like security contexts and allows adequate isolation between domains.
Incomarison to VMWare/Xen, or even User Mode Linux, the CPU and
RAM overheads are minimal.

I am not technically competent to talk about virtualisation, Xen, IBM
servers etc.

However, based on my experience in Government way of working, Google
model is the best for govt. Why one huge common database for all
application - except possibly a huge citizen database. Most of the
government work can be split into several convenient independent
databases. Interaction among different department are very minimal.

In last nearly 20years of GOI working I have not seen a single
instance of huge data is really analysed and some decision taken.
Essentially, what is required a data storage, which can be retrieved,
mostly with point queries.

What people talk about e-governance with large enterprise grade ( and
other high sounding words) will have no use unless administrative
reforms are carried out, and drastic change is brought in procedures.

In my estimate even a very determined, honest ministers+top_officers
should take atleast 20 years to bring about the kind of unified
database that will truely mean e-governance. Until, that time,
building in pieces (however keeping the design centralised and
compatible) will be cost effective way.

I know serveral offices who have IBM/Solaris/HP servers worth
8-10lakhs storing 50% records of what I am storing on p3-PC.

In my opinion government should not rush in spending on hardware,
before really developing,testing application. Generally the
implementation time is very long, and the full power of system will
be required about 2-3 years after serious start of implementation.

Delay hardware procurement as much as possible to get best
price+technology.

Message-ID: <1b338f0d0607142202u26856cd1sf3827eb1cf42d236@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I had a p4 system running on CentOS 4 (kernel - 2.6.9-11). Till yesterday it
was running okay. But today while booting it was directly taking me to grub
rompt. From prompt, I tried to boot by 'boot' command. It failed with this
error message
Error 16: Inconsistent filesystem structure.

After some googling I've found that this error is returned by filesystem
code to denote an internal error caused by the sanity checks of the
filesystem structure on disk not matching what it expects. So now my
question is does that mean my hard disk is gone! If so is there any way to
get back my data? btw my 80gb disk was partitioned as LVM.

Please help me in this regard.
Thanks in advance,

try booting off a knoppix livecd and see if you can mount and access  
the hdd. If so, you can put it as a secondary harddisk in another  
system and copy the data of it and then try reformatting etc

Hi!

I once got this error when I changed my partition table and forgot to
install grub after that. It took a livecd and a reinstall of grub from
there to set things in order. Something like that might help you as
well...

it moves on...

Hi,
Thanks for your reply. But problem is not yet resolved. I tried to mount the
filesystem using livecd.
mount -t ext3 /dev/sda2 /usr/local/tmp
it failed with this message

I tried
fsck -t ext3 /dev/sda2
that also failed with this message

Yes I too feel so. In fact I tried fsck with all the superblocks listed by
'mkfs -n'. But same error for all of them. It's really strange how can all
the superblocks get corrupted! Any way thanks to you guys for all your help.

Inside information always helps. Thanks for the enlightenment. But my
conclusions were based on my experience with some other Govt. based
enterprises (European and American public sector). Typically, over the
course of the past 20 - 30 years, they were also applying the same
kind of logic as expressed by you. But, of course, the systems weren't
always centralized. This has cost the companies dearly over time, and
that is why WE (as in Indian Corporates) are now making money, by
migrating these "distributed" pieces into one piece - distributed
systems :-P.

Good suggestion. But, the architecture of the software should allow
centralization or decentralization as and when required. IMHO, the
system design should also allow integration of the databases in a much
later stage, for data mining activities.....

the first is closed source and the second is considered, in many

foss is a child of the internet, and the main foss tool is the  
internet. In order, foss tools are:

1. mailing lists
2. forums
3. repositories
5. bugtrackers
6. wikis

all of which are publicly accessible (at least read, usually not  
write). Just because a software package is developed using foss  
packages, it does not lend any particular foss 'vaadai' to the package.

The power and stability of the foss model is due to public access to  
these tools in development. So a developer who is not using these  
tools cannot claim he is using foss tools for development. Nothing  
wrong with writing and selling good closed source software, but to  
try to push it by giving a foss halo round it is bad. And they cant  
prove it anyway as they wont show the code. I can say that M$ access  
is written with foss tools - can anyone disprove it?

Hello folks,

I just bought an Acer lappy and installed Suse 10.1 from LFY DVD. At home, I use an Airtel broadband connection (details below). As a first hurdle, I am unable to connect with it, and am stuck without patches and non-prop drivers -- trying the same for 2 days without any success. I have a separate XP machine with the same net connection running fine. Please tell me of any way to get the required patches & updates for my laptop...

Acer 3212 NWXMi:
--- Pentium M 740 (detected as i386)
--- Intel 915GM Motherboard
--- 512 MB DDR2
--- Intel Pro 2200 WLAN
--- Gigabit Ethernet
--- Modem port & Infrared
--- All hardware detected fine; GB Ethernet installed; ndiswrapper installed

Airtel Broadband:
--- 128 kbps
 --- beetel 220bx ADSL router
--- USB and Ethernet (PPPoE) interfaces supported

{ PS 1: I tried the trick given at http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:How_To_Create_a_Patch_CD but the total size exceeds 2GB! And I don't know which of the files can be safely excluded }

I thought this also will add sense in the same context :)

But I accept the above is not so exhaustive as the one mentioned in
the Framework Performance link. Yet it can give a crude idea.

What is the issue you face when you try connecting. The last time I 
tried Airtel, they had a USB modem and it was not supported. Now that 
you have a router and PPPoE is supported, what is the issue?

ya right balaji. if its got PPPoE support and u must have an integrated

But the "Online Update Configuration" module seems to hang everytime I try to configure it. It just hangs up at "Contacting server...". Wierd! So does the update notifier applet in the tray -- it hangs when I click configure (gets stuck up saying "Refreshing sources").

Hmm. It's a given that Ruby's performance has always been slower than 
Python's. One would be surprised if Ruby were faster, because Python 
received a lot more attention through the years, and lot more people 
hacked on it, to make it faster.

Now, things have changed. YARV (a Ruby VM) is going into Ruby 1.9, it is 
supposed to make Ruby much, much faster. But the point of a web 
framework is not performance (though it's still very important). It's 
programmer productivity. The little difference in performance between 
Ruby vs. Python vs. Java can be easily covered with a little more 
powerful hardware (for regular use, I would go so far as to say that 
this difference doesn't matter).

But, the point of Rails (in some ways, Django too - just not to be 
partial) is the tremendous increase of programmer productivity it gives 
versus, say J2EE. I've been a Java/J2EE fanboy before, worked on open 
source frameworks like Struts & Spring, so I know the pain (in 
hindsight). From  personal experience, Rails has made me at least 5x 
faster (now I'll don my asbestos suit). And I actually like webapp 
deployment now (don't remind me about the hoops I used to jump through 
to get Apache + Tomcat running).

It's a whole new ballgame. Rails, Django, TurboGears (another python 
framework - this is very decent too - wonder why Python guys are not 
talking about it?) are competitors in this arena, so choose what you 
want and like out of these. Ahem, that's after you take a look at them 
yourself, of course ;-). Good luck!

Fully agree. Programmers are expensive and need to be pampered
frequently.  Machines do just what they are told to do -- no need for
appraisals, counselling... pay rises :-)

Then there is 'trails' for java (IMO and unfortunate choice for a
project name!).

It is not so much the underlying language that is great about Rails
(of course, if you are from a java background you cannot fail to
notice the drastic reduction in the number of lines of code needed to
implement any functionality in ruby) but the fresh approach to
framework design. In other frameworks, one had to write (and write)
dozens of configuration files to get something working. But in Rails,
there is a default for almost everything and you need to configure
only those variables that need tweaking for your specific
functionality.

Hi Kenneth,

My understanding is that they are currently paying for a windows software
called vanavil .
There is a windows keyboard by name ekalappai created by us.
You can get it from here:
http://thamizha.com/modules/mydownloads/viewcat.php?cid=3

This is free as in beer (but not opensource since we dont have its source
code which is created by a closed source company and given to us under OEM
license  )

So I am suggesting, if I get the remington keyboard layout details, I can
create a free ekalappai keyboard for them. And they wont have a need to pay
vanavil to type in windows.

Regards,
Mugunth

OpenDocument is an independent consortium developing document formats,
while OpenOffice is seen as the cononical implementation of these
document formats:

I agree with you that these frameworks are far simpler to use than J2EE.
However, one of the problems I have noticed with these frameworks has
nothing to do with the frameworks themselves but rather with the
dynamically-typed nature of Python and Ruby which makes it very difficult
to catch some errors.

For very large applications, it is best to use a language which does not
have dynamic typing turned on by default.

There are ways of getting around this limitation ofcourse - such as
writing a whole range of unit test scripts for each and every aspect of
the solution. But in my experience, that is easier said than done because
it is almost impossible to unit-test some blocks of code such as UI
handling code.

Also, if I were to use unit-tests to get around this problem, it is in
anycase just a work around to a problem with the platform. This problem is
perhaps more elegantly solved if Python / Ruby includes a run-time switch
which turns of dynamic typing (but this will require fairly extensive
changes in these platforms).

I use statically-typed languages for coding for the same reason I set the
compiler preferences to display even very minor warnings when I develop in
C/C++; it is best to catch variable type errors at compile time rather
than at run-time.

Thanks,

Very nice but what they wanted was a remington keymap for tamil in linux

If they are already paying for vanavil and have a site license for it 
there seems to be no incentive to switch to e-kalappai

I got the link, i hope its what you are mentioning by remington keyboard.
http://www.tamilnation.org/digital/tamilnet99/tamilnet99report.htm#Typewriter%20Keyboard

But I think its the new Typewriter keyboard layout which is used by those
who learned tamil typewriting in typewriting institutes.

I got confused when you guys called by a different name i.e. remington.

I already have a ekalappai keyboard for it. Can package it and upload it
sometime next week.

For linux, i understand from Hari of NRC-FOSS that somebody else is working
on it already - I can contribute to it as when required.

Regards,
Mugunth

Oh boy. The age-old dynamic vs. static typing argument. Check out the 
recent comp.lang.lisp threads for a particularly long-drawn discussion 
on this. They are much more detailed and make valid technical points on 
both sides better than I can.

I don't know about desktop apps - but UI testing would be overkill for 
most webapps. Validation checks, yes - but writing unit tests for how a 
certain div will appear on your html page will quickly bog you down. A 
good web designer is all you need. So I would consider this a moot point.

Sorry, I have to strongly disagree. Just because you have static typing, 
it doesn't mean that you don't need unit testing at all. In that case, 
you wouldn't have JUnit, and all those XP methodologies and tools to 
make Java projects a little more manageable.

Unit tests are written mainly for things like clarifying design (when 
you do TDD, you will be surprised how many design flaws you find 
beforehand), enabling change (smaller feedback loops between coder and 
customer) and finally, to create a strong test suite (so that new 
changes don't break old code) - so as to enable better integration 
testing and the likes.

Yes, it would be nice to have the type errors flagged beforehand. But, 
type errors are one of the minor errors to worry about. You are going to 
find them sooner or later (either during unit tests or manual testing). 
What is more important to worry about is how fast you are able to 
market  your web product or how fast you are able to roll out the 
first-but-buggy version to your customer.

As we all know, release early and release often is a good strategy. You 
can always correct your mistakes in the second round. Static languages 
hobble you in this respect that you have the extra compilation step. 
Development becomes slower because you have to recompile the entire 
webapp or parts of it every time you make a change. Dynamic languages 
win in this respect that they will remove that extra unnecessary step - 
you're gonna write unit tests anyways (for the above reasons), so why 
slow you down with an extra step?

I know it can be argued both ways for quite a long time, but I think for 
now I support dynamic languages unless I really think they're 
compromising my web app. So far, I had no such complaints. In fact, I'm 
happier now because my compiler won't complain that I used a BigInt, 
SmallInt, WhateverInt instead of an Int. It's a friggin number dammit, 
now get on with it!

Well, this is where the subjectivity and religious wars come in - 
purists want type safety at any cost; pragmatists don't care about it 
until it hits them on their head - which it rarely does. I'm certainly 
in the latter camp.

remington-rand is a common manufacturer of manual typewriters .. in fact 
Remington and Christopher Sholes patented the QWERTY layout in the late 
1890s so they have been making typewriters for that long.

Java typing is dynamic enough to warrant all this... Especially,
pre-`generic' Java...

it moves on...

I don't get it - are you saying that you write unit tests in Java to 
handle its' type errors/dynamicity? Then it's certainly news to me - in 
all the agile books and articles I read, I've never seen this reason 
before.

Thanks Mr. Raman. I am already in the processes of preparing the
slides.(Assuming that there will be projector in the room, and a
Javascript enabled browser within it).

I am making some fundamental assumptions that people know a little bit
of HTML, CSS and some programming
language(C/C++/Java/PERL/PHP/anything of this sort). Kindly let me
know in advance, If I have to change the scope of my presentation.

But, I am not in a position to confirm my availability on this date,
due to my personal reasons. I shall confirm the date in due course.
But, I would like to have it immediately after PHP/PERL classes (Just
as aptly planned!!!).

I didn't make the assertion that unit tests are not needed. What I said is
that using unit tests to find errors which could have been caught during a
normal compilation stage is kludgy. Unit tests are good and have their
place, but a compile time error listing is definitely a useful aid.

If your application is simple, and it is not mission critical, then it is
perhaps useful to go with the line of reasoning that you expound here -
that is to discount errors which "rarely" occur. A compile time warning or
error is definitely a wonderful mechanism to detect errors which might
otherwise be very difficult to detect.

I have written and architected some very large enterprise applications in
Python: if I am asked to do something similar now, I would definitely go
with a language like Java. The problem with java is not the language but
rather the overly complicated mess that is J2EE and this crazy fixation
with "descriptive programming" using a million XML files for even
describing application logic. J2EE looks like it was designed by a
committee and it most certainly was.

The time it takes to compile code is quite often overstated. The compile
process reveals errors which can then be fixed quite easily. In a
dynamically-typed system, you will have to deal with the same errors but
you will discover them (if at all) only at runtime - and so what you lose
in compile time (on statically typed languages) is more than exceeded in
time it takes to discover the errors while programming using a
dynamically-typed language.

Also, the performance penalty of dynamically-typed languages may not be
suitable for some applications.

I am no purist - I continue to use languages like Python and Ruby (and on
occassion, groovy), but not for the large scale applications where java /
.net is more suitable.

Thanks,
Prem

Dear Friends,

I need some suggestions.

I am planning to purchase a desktop system (Linux comp). 

My budget is 20k +/- 3k. 

I prefer AMD. Need info reg which model I can go.

If you give me full details, it will be helpful. 

Thanks in advance.

What you just said is very true from developer perspective.. but...

I would like to strongly contradict you on this. In huge enterprises,
with hundreds of equally huge applications deployed in production,
"release often" is least preferred. Each deployment cycle takes up
huge resources(Time and human efforts), in terms of re-testing the
entire application, re-training naive users (if applicable),
maintaining downtimes (for 24x7 applications), etc... So, many times,
the IT managers prefer to "catch" all the bugs before the first
deployment, and for each and every release, they try to squeeze in as
many new/fix features as possible, so that, they can reduce another
deployment cycle.

The situation becomes worse, when it comes to desktop
(non-centralized) applications.

 This is wrt Enterprise application programs. But when it comes to
product development (including FOSS), release often and release early
is ofcourse prefered from the developer point of view.

See, touch and feel these 3 items before purchasing.  I would
recommend a TVS Gold mechanical keyboard, and a comfortable
Logitech or Microsoft mouse that fits your hand.

Consider an LCD monitor if possible.  Visit dpreview.com to
understand how your monitor shows various colors.

Buy atleast 512MB RAM (helps when you run vmware/xen/etc),
1GB RAM is preferred.

Purchase a Seagate HDD of atleast 120GB capacity.  IMO
Seagagte has better reliability than Maxtor, Samsung, etc.

Get a decent UPS.

Ensure all other hardware you get (video, audio, nic, etc) are
are supported out of the box.  Unsupported hardware is a pain.

Depending on your workload, any modern CPU should do so
I would give it the least importance.  Intel VT-x (found on Conroe)
is nice as it allows you to run an unmodified OS (WinXP) as a
Xen guest.  If you dont need this feature, buy a Celeron or Sempron.

Naturally, you will have to do some research before finalising on
your components, and from experience, it's usually good fun.
It will make you more informed about what you are purchasing
as a customer.

Ok, you might be right there. I'm definitely talking about 
run-of-the-mill webapps like wikis, CMSes and simple transactional 
systems. My experience has mostly been in this space, so I guess I'm 
generalizing too much.

Sorry, didn't mean to imply that you're a purist, but I understand your 
position now. Great points, though I'm still not convinced that dynamic 
languages are not suited for large-scale applications (maybe experience 
will prove me wrong? - don't know yet).

Friends.

I attended the tamil translation workshop conducted
at AU-KBC, MIT by NRC-FOSS on last saturday.

It is really interesting to do translation in tamil.

Thanks for the team.
Mr.Hari, Mr.Siva and Mr.vel murugan guided us well.

we, 15 people, learned how o install kbebel tool
and build database.

Started to translate django, a python framework
and finished in around 3 hours.

Thanks for NRC-FOSS.

Why does release have to mean release to the final customer. It could
very well be internal.

For quite a few years now, software process like UP have been evolving
which suggest many small iterations of design-development-testing.
What you say, sounds more like the waterfall model.

Agile methodologies are targeted at reducing precisely the consumption 
of huge resources when you are deploying (and in other steps too). If 
you can reduce the amount of cost and effort that goes with each 
deployment, then frequent releases are a good thing, right?

> in terms of re-testing the
> entire application, 
If you have a really good test suite, this would not be much of an 
issue. This will work as your safety net when you are making changes to 
the code. You would not need to re-test the entire application. If you 
use continuous builds, it will be even more easier to manage this.

> re-training naive users (if applicable),
Whether naive or not, frequent changes in application does raise the 
specter of re-training, but mostly the changes will be small. Since we 
are talking about a few weeks or at most a month to do a new release, I 
don't think the functionality changes drastically between two releases. 
So, you wouldn't need to invest so much in training.

You can take this as an on-going thing. Every new release, you train the 
users for an hour or two,  let them work on the new features, take 
feedback, and work on the next release. This way, you wouldn't have to 
do huge 3-4 day training programs, at the end of which nobody is sure 
how much the users learned. Let's face it, most of us learn how to use a

That is precisely the recipe for disaster in most 'enterprise' software. 
Lets face it, there is hardly any time to fix bugs when a release is 
looming. The major disadvantage is that, since the deployment cycles are 
so costly, there is less tendency to fix bugs after they miss the 
bug-fix phase. They are delayed until the next cycle, which causes 
endless cursing among the users.

Frequent releases make sense in most scenarios, except maybe in places 
like avionics software, or other real-time applications where having 
bugs can be quite costly in many fronts. In which case, obviously there 
would be a lot of pre-release testing. Also because specs stay the same 
for an entire model of a fighter jet, for quite some years.

In a business scenario the requirements change every quarter. The 
business changes, its competitors change, so the software has to change 
to cater to that need. Here, having long-drawn release cycles is quite 
bad, and that's why enterprise software projects (I read somewhere that 
it's as high as 70%) have such a high rate of  failure. They become 
obsolete before they even get deployed.

It maybe true that the scenario you explained exists in many enterprise 
software shops, and that's precisely the reason why they should move to 
Agile development methodologies.

afaik, unit tests are written not just for typing errors but for a
whole lot of reasons. it is just that the need for such tests
increases by quite a bit when the language is dynamically typed, coz
many of the type related bugs are not caught at compile time. my point
is that, under the hypothetical (note :) ) situation where the only
need for unit tests are possible type errors, java is dynamically
typed enough to need them.

it moves on...

Message-ID: <20060718021427.GA4865@localhost>

Dear ILUGC,

I want to profile code in a shared object, which is loaded at
runtime. Despite my best efforts, I could not use gprof to do this, as
gprof expects the program being profiled to return normally or call
exit() in order to print out gmon.out. I was wondering what the
workaround for this would be.

Thanks.

Hi Shrinivasan,
Great to hear that. Appreciate Hari, Siva and Murugan's initiative.

I like to make one request here. To help the future tamil translator we need
to have a common Tamil glossary in the internet.

As of we have a great infrastructure for that in http://ta.wiktionary.org

I request you and your team to create logins in ta.wiktionary.org and enter
all the words (English & corresponding tamil words) in it.

This would help us to take ta.wiktionary.org as as single source of
reference for Tamil words.

Lets grow this open Tamil Glossary for the better future of tamil
translations.

Regards,
Mugunth

It is a very good question but unfortunately there is
no such command and there never will be. 

Let me try to explain why reality is so depressing.
:-)

1) There are several 10,000s of packages which are
installed on a case by case basis depending on one's
need. 

2) Some of the categories are listed below

archivers   cross          finance      mail       
news       shells
audio       crosspkgtools  sysutils
benchmarks  games        math        parallel   
biology     databases      geography    mbone      
pkglocate  textproc
bootstrap   devel          graphics     meta-pkgs  
pkgtools   time
cad         ham          misc        print      wm
chat        doc            inputmethod  mk         
README     www
comms       editors        lang         multimedia 
regress    x11
converters  emulators      licenses     net        
security

3) So you can see no one can know all commands. One
command in bash that can give you what you want is if
you press the <TAB> key twice

Display all 3594 possibilities? (y or n)

is what I get bcoz I have installed packages that give
me these many commands. 

But it is not humanly possible to learn all of them
nor is there a need. :-) You can however try "man
<cmd>" for whichever cmd that has a man page. 

4) New commands are being created every day, every
hour. Even you can create one. How will others know?
It will take time. 

If I understand your need correctly you have to learn
the various "shell commands". By this is meant common
small small tools used for day to day productivity. 

I will try to list some of them but this is by no
means exhaustive. Please bear with me. 

ls
mkdir
cp 
mv 
rm 
cat
less
man 
tr
sed
awk
tar
zip
vim
ln
date
diff
mplayer
mpg321

Sorry it is impossible to even do that.:-)

Sigh! Just dive in and have fun! You will never be
disappointed. I promise you that much. 

regards,
Girish

you have 2 versions of python installed. (are you using sarge?)
if you do ls -l /usr/bin/python you will see that it points to
/usr/bin/python2.3

you can symlink it to python2.4 if u want to use the latest version of
python by default.

you have both python 2.3 and 2.4 installed in your system. /usr/bin/ 
python is symlinked to python 2.3. (the third number is a minor

Had a conversation with Parimala of
our office on the Remignton typewriter layout.

The layout at:
http://www.tamilnation.org/images/digital/key2.jpg
is mostly correct representation of Tamil remington keyboard.
Some of the incorrect representations include:
"A" key (shift+a) should represent ?? (RA) as in ????  (puRA = pigeon)
"Z" key (shift+z) should represent ?? (NA) as in ????? (aNNA = elder brother)

Parimala has defined each of tamil character key in the
Remington typewriter layout in the attached file.
First column is the actual Tamil characters starting from
a, A, i, I ..... to Sri plus a few symbols (313 tamil chars + 9 symbols).
The second column is the
keystrokes in an Engish keyboard that need to be pressed
to get the column one tamil character or symbol.
(tamil chars in unicode) There are 4 characters for which
we are unsure about the keystrokes. They are indicated
according in the file. Will confirm later.

Let me know if you have issues in viewing the file.

hari.

ps: One issue that needs to be solved
in this layout is that the order in which
keystrokes are to entered is different from
the order in which it gets represented in Unicode.
eg: for ?? *mi*  ? (i)+?(ma) is keying order in remington layout
requirement, whereas unicode text has to be stored as
?(ma)+? (i).

Its wonderful that someone was able to port their application to Ruby on
Rails and benefit from that, but I have real difficulty believing
applications such as banking applications will ever get any real benefit
from being ported over to Ruby.

Note that the page you have linked to does not talk about the nature of
the application which was ported over - all it says is that 4 days of Ruby
coding was needed for porting over a Java application that took 4 months
to code.

Another critical fact to consider is that the first time you write an
application it is definitely going to take a long time - if this same
application were to be rewritten from scratch in Java (without reusing
existing code), would it take as long as it took to develop it the first
time around? what if this was rewritten for .NET?

Also, a 4 month Java project by 2 people (at most) hardly qualifies to be
called "large."

Prem

if  visual studio is used, i dont think 4 days will take. but lesser than that

Have you ever thought of the person who invented "CTRL +   ALT + DEL" key combination. 
     
    "David Bradley"
    He is the One who spent 1 minute and 23 seconds in   writing the source code that rescues 
    the world's PC users for decades This extraordinary IBM   employee is retiring on 
    Friday, 25th March 2005 after a prolong service of 29   years. 
     
    His formula forces obstinate computers to restart when   they no longer follow other commands. 
     
    By 1980, Bradley was one of 12 people working to create   the debut. 
     
    The engineers knew they had to design a simple way to   restart the computer 
    when it fails to respond the user Bradley wrote the code   to make it work.
     
    Bradley says. "I did a lot of other things than   Ctrl-Alt-Delete, but I'm famous for that one." 
    His fame and success is achieved each time a PC user   fails.
     
    He Commented His relationship with Bill gates by saying   
    "I may have invented it, but Bill gates made it famous   by applying my formula 
    when ever any Microsoft's Windows operating system made   by him CRASHES, 
    thus I win when ever he   looses..........."

Hi,
    I am using emacs21 in my debian sarge machine.  I want to set 
syntax-highlighting(global-font-lock) on always.  I searched for .emacs 
file but i could only find ~/.emacs.d/ folder which doesnt have any 
files (except for auto-save-list folder).  I tried creating init.el 
file, but emacs didnt respond.

Can anyone help me?

Please put your settings in ~/.emacs file. If it is not there., create

Do you by any chance mean the builtin commands supported by the shell?
Because only those need to be "supported" by the shell, other programs
don't need a shell for their execution...

create it! emacs21 searches for ~/.emacs.elc, ~/.emacs.el and
~/.emacs; in that order...

fyi, emacs22 (yet to be released, still in cvs) searches for ~/.emacs*
, ~/.emacs.d/.emacs* and ~/.emacs.d/init.el(c). So, what you did would
have worked there.

it moves on...

Hi Chakkaradeep,

The tamil pack available there is for Firefox 1.0.x versions and it wont
work for Firefox 1.5 and above.

I am the one who created it. I havent updated the tamil pack for version
1.5.x yet.

I will upgrade the language pack in firefox site in a day or two.
Meanwhile I will send you the tamil pack for firefox 1.5 by private mail
tonight

Thanks & Regards,
Mugunth

create .emacs in ur home directory

below are some of the basic settings which i use that u can put in ur .emacs

(require 'font-lock)
(global-font-lock-mode t)
for source code syntax highlighting

(setq make-backup-files nil)
no backup will be created

(setq inhibit-startup-message t)
no startup message

(transient-mark-mode t)
highlights when selecting(yanking)

(menu-bar-mode nil)
hide the top menu

(setq standard-indent 4)
indentation set for 4 space - set based upon u r programming language

(setq show-parens-mode t)
used for track starting and ending and highlighting braces in u r source code

(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
indent based on tab

also u could add emacs to run on terminal using emacs -nw. for ease,
add in .bashrc

Message-ID: <dc538c3f0607182234t4853387dk251c66603bbe8da2@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

i am in the process of creating a custom live CD using knoppix as the
base. i have a problem when starting up the user which i chose.

for eg, bala is the user. i also placed the home directory under
/home. but everytime, iso boots, there is no folder called bala under
/home. can any one tell me how the user login in x window system is
handled in knoppix? i also wonder that knoppix user directory i.e
/home/knoppix is created on the fly i.e runtime. i want to make
similar kind of stuff.

any suggestion?

I just built my firefox with the script :)

There is one small mistake in the script, there should be a space left after
wget :).

Now am running Tamil firefox in my Linspire box .

Subject: [Ilugc] Help with PostgreSQL (psycopg)
Message-ID: <44BDECDB.5060506@gmail.com>

Hello,
I am trying to use PostgreSQL database in Python using psycopg. I have 
an issue, not basically with psycopg, but mainly with postgresql. I have 
created an account guest, with superuser privileges and permission to 
create tables, with a password 'guest'. When i try to use it for 
accessig database in my python program, i get an authentication failure 
error.

[python code]

from psycopg import connect
connection = connect("dbname=mydb user=guest password=guest")
cursor = connection.cursor()
cursour.execute("SELECT * FROM mytable")
......
......

[/python code]

But this gives me a "fatal error: Authentication failure" for user=guest 
incorrect password=guest. I made sure that the password is correct. I 
then checked the same using 'pgaccess' a GUI for accessing PostgreSQL 
database. I used the same dbname, username and password, and i was able 
to access my database, the 'mytable' table was there and had data i had 
earlier inserted from the command line.

when i give 'psql mydb' am able to get the 'mydb=>'prompt, and thats how 
i created mytable.

Where am i getting worng ? What is the proper method of setting up a 
user and password in PostgreSQL. I was earlier using MySQL and i had no 
such authentication problems. psql seems to a bit confusing as it 
doesn't have a 'user=<uname> password=<pword>' option as in mysql to get 
into mysql.

Hi Chakkradeep,
Great to hear the FF 1.5 indic build script is working fine in Linspere
also.

In the script document, the space after wget was not given deliberately.
Because when I tried to  give space after wget, mediawiki  is giving some
strange error. Not able to figure out why.
So removed the space hoping that users of this script can find and correct
it while using it :)

This is not a problem with firefox but with documents created using m$
word... Word considers it wise to replace quotes by what it calls
"smart quotes" (sic), where in a new character is replaced for the
starting and an another for the ending quote. This is not standard and
hence not all fonts support these characters (only the coding system
and ms' fonts in windows display them properly). The best solution for
this would be to use `tidy' with appropriate options to replace the
documents with less smarter, but saner quotes ;)

it moves on...

Hi Chakkaradeep,
>From the current version of OpenOffice(v 2.0.3) onwards, Tamil language pack
is made available by openoffice itself.
You can find the Tamil language pack (ta-IN) in this URL:
http://oootranslation.services.openoffice.org/pub/OpenOffice.org/2.0.3rc7/

Steps to install tamil pack:
1. Install english version of OpenOffice.org 2.0.3 first (you can get it
from http://download.openoffice.org/2.0.3/index.html )

2. Download and install the tamil language pack for your OS (seperate
language pack is available for linux/windows & Solaris) from
http://oootranslation.services.openoffice.org/pub/OpenOffice.org/2.0.3rc7/

3. Open the openoffice.org, go to
Tools --> Options --> Language Settings --> Languages
There there we can choose the Language of "User Interface".  Here Choose
Tamil,

4. Close OpenOffice and open again. now you should be able to see the
interface in tamil.

Please try and let us know if it works fine in Linspire..

Mugunth

i mean to say when we do " yum install mplayer" ..yum will look yum repo and
download and install the mplayer packages along with dependency pacages. My
aim is to only download these pacages.
I don't want to install.  I changed the /etc/yum.conf file [keepcache=1] and
i could get all packages under /var/cache/yum/<repo name>/packagesor as
specified . But the things is that after downloading this packages yum is
going to  install these packages which i don't want. I can achive this by
pressing ctrl+c before installion start . i don't want to watch when
downloading of these packages has been finished ...............

are there any [arg] available with yum which can do this thing?

Hi Parthan,

1. To get prompted for password when using psql try the following:
psql mydb --username guest --password

2. To always get password prompt change the authentication method in file  
/usr/local/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf. (Assuming your installation is at 
/usr/local/pgsql). 

 'trust' will allow any user to connect as any other user by specifing 
--username option. 

3. I am not sure why your python script fails to connect. Are you running your 
python script in the same machine running the database server? 

If connecting over network, you should enable tcp/ip connection in 
postgresql.conf and allow permissions to the ip addresses in pg_hba.conf 
file. 

Best regards, 

Ma Sivakumar

I guess so. Did you change this, restart postgresql and try connecting again? 

The set up 
"ident sameuser" means you can connect only as the user you are working as 
(unix loginname). With password or trust authentication, that restriction is 
gone and your script should work.

After you are through with this do subscribe to pgsql-general@postgresql.org 
mailing list. 
One of the high quality tech lists I subscribe to. The discussions are always 
on topic, except when someone brings up MySQL :-). 

With PostgreSQL things are not like MySQL, they are far better. That is what 
the PostgreSQL developers and users believe.

AFAIK, You can do that.. yum works with a python script.. After download, it
will run the installation as a transaction. You can see the script
/usr/bin/yum..

It calls.. yummain.py which is in /usr/share/yum-cli/
go to the section "Run the Transaction"
Comment the "base.doTransaction()" or add some code to ask for "y/N" before
doing this.

For sure that, some other easy ways too exist.. iam not recommending this..
go on with Google..

If its Linux, Fedora has Indic support build by default. 
cvs.fedoraproject.org and the SRPMS would be useful.

Thanks for your reply. Yes we can do that way. By the way  .
I just did " yum install yum-utils"  and  i got yumdownloader. Then i did
"yumdownloader -resolve gnuchess"  I  got the gnuchess packages without
installing. yumdownloader downloaded into my current directory.

Thanks for your reply

two solutions have been proposed, one using the rpm command and another
involving editing the yum python script itself - so, both are of limited use.
yum itself does not (yet?) support the download only option, but this option
becomes available if one installs the yum-utils package.

Hi, you might want to read this project report. These students have

FYI, If its Linux, it doesnt mean Linux means Fedora. may be u know
only fedora it seems. please take a look at other linux too.

there are still people using linux other than fedora.

coming to your point, if u r using fedora core 3, and u want firefox
1.5, fedora 3 repo didnt provide that. ok in that case you have to
build from source. none SRPMS work out.

Its got quite a few bugs, not ready for the mainstream yet.  I get more 
frequent crashes (may be I've not built it properly), but its got many 
blockers before it can be released.

Wow! How many releases do the firefox developers manage at a time?! I
mean, stable at 1.5 with two major releases ahead in the unstable is
something I am hearing of for the first time :)

Friends.

Al Last, after a strange struggle,
Hari, Parimala and their team successfully designed
a keyboard layuout for tamil as old typewriter layout.

Wow. This is great contributuion to tamil.

Tomorrow, i am going to ELCOT and will install it.

Here is the mail by hari to me.


-----------------------------------------------------------

hi Shrini,

Pl. see :
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/TamilRemingtonLayout

for instructions on installing Tamil remington on scim.
Sorry, I need to rush. Could'nt write the steps I did for
creating the scim tables. Essentially followed the steps
at :
http://www.scim-im.org/development/contribute/how_to_create_a_new_ime_in_about_15_minutes_with_scim_and_scim_tables
and used a modified form of the file I sent you yeterday.


-------------------------------------------------------------------


Hats off to the team.

This proves the power of open source and the community.
If there is no way, we would create our own.

Thanks for all wishers and contributors.

Which is why I pointed out the available of a public cvs repository to

Perhaps it has something to do with the web sites rather than the 
browser itself.

The Leak Monitor extension can help you find out which leaks memory:

http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2490/

PS. the DOM Inspector that accompanies FF2, FF3 leaks memory.

You'll have to put the start up script in /etc/rcN.d where N is the 
run-level.
I don't know if you have the appropriate READMEs in the directories like 
Solaris, if it does, read them to understand it ;-)

In Debian sarge you can write your shell script to start these
services and put in /etc/init.d/
Do remeber to give +x to the script. Then
$ apt-get install rcconf
$ rcconf

After the above step you will find the script which you just added in
the list but it will be unchecked. Just check that script. Then it
will automatically start while booting.

If you use apt-get to install apache, the beautiful
packaging scripts will take care of starting it up for
u since 99% of users will want that. You can also
configure ur port and other things. 

If however for some reason u want a bleeding edge of
apache and u have compiled  it urself, u can always
use the update-rc.d script after creating a chota
shell script called apache.sh or something and putting
it under /etc/init.d

I am attaching my apache script for ur reference. 

HTH,

flv format? I think it is the best format under the
sun. Both for audio and video. But market will not
move to it and away from mp3 easily. Many ppl dont
even know ogg vorbis. 

It is especially relevant in portable players since
flv  files compress remarkably well at no loss of
quality. I get at least a factor of two which means
double the number of mp3 songs in portable players !

Dear all 

    SCS Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Chromept, has given us
permission to conduct one day seminar to +1 and +2 students on 29th
Jul 06. There will be about 50 students. The school has about 20
systems.

I am planning to give atleast 25-30 live/install cds to the
school/students/teachers. Though I have Freeduc, it is very old. I
prefer to give edubuntu.

    If someone has it/can download it, please spare me a copy. I
shall make additional copies.

You need a cross compiler for that.

You need to look into building GCC as a cross compiler.
http://gcc.gnu.org/install/ can serve you as a starting point.

I tried as above in FC3 and Linspire.

For Linspire I think something is missing. I installed the Debian
UnstableTamil Language Package(as Linspire doesnt have Tamil :( ) and after
selection, i got all text in squares ! (Tamil Font is installed) ! .
However, when I installed the Hindi Pack for Oo which Linspire has by
default, Oo worked perfectly.

In FC3, I uninstalled Oo 1.1 and installed Oo 2.0 and the Tamil Translation
pack and hurray !, Oo in Tamil !

In my custom built FC3 distro, I got the same squares as how I got in
Linspire.

Is Oo using some specific tamil font which i have to install?

Thank You.

Well, VLC does that using mingw compiler and NSIS Installer :).

I think we have to use cross platform compilers like mingw instead of gcc.

MinGW is the windows port (sort of) of GCC in case you don't know.
So, cross compiling for Windows from GNU/Linux requires MinGW.

It is possible......check for how to cross compile in Linux using MinGW. We
have done and generated the full vlc.exe in Linux itself. The VLC Build
ReadMe has how to do it and what are the requirements.

3 GB of RAM? You must be kidding. I think your machine
is not setup with adequate swap space. I compiled
firefox 1.5 with 256 MB RAM and my swap is 700 MB.

Now that your machine is setup, if you have
partitioned properly according to standard
recommendation, I suggest you mv files from a
partition and convert it into a swap partition with
mkswap and swapon commands. 
Remember this is a dangerous surgery and you have to
be very careful. 

*If not it will screw up your disk and you will lose
all data. You are warned.*

Standard disclaimers apply. :-)

Also you have to add entry in /etc/fstab, reboot and
check with top whether ur swap is properly recognized.


But it is worthwhile to do this as without swap your
machine will gasp for breath even if you run firefox. 

If you are too scared to do this, backup and reinstall
with 1 GB swap. Doesn't hurt. 

HTH,
Girish

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0607200519p560f67c0rafc381bdfdadddb5@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

Today, I went to ELCOT.
There, I installed scim.
Then installed remington keyboard layout
developed by Hari and team.

But it too had some changes from their typing.
Hari guided me hoe to edit the keyboard map.

as i edited and reinstalled the scim keyboard driver,
IT WORKED :-)

They feel happy with it.

But the open office gives issues.

It worked with the original layout by Hari.

But, it shows only "Boxes" with layout edited by me.

But, both works well with gedit.

Let me try inhouse and saturday, i will give them a nice one.

Thanks for Hari and Team.

dear,
T.Shrinivasan.

Message-ID: <20060720160300.65643.qmail@web8902.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hi,
 
I am having problems with starting a graphical display manager with Suse 10.1. It was working properly, with all hardware well detected, until I clicked K-Menu -> End Session. This left me with the console. Now, ever since that, I have never been able to go into KDE again. Even the graphical login prompt does not show up.
 
I tried the usual: startx, kdm, startkde, etc. But no use. It exits with error codes saying that none of the hardware were detected. Come on -- I only clicked "End Session" -- no way my hardware configuration was lost by that one action!
 
Can any of you tell me how to get my KDE up and running again? Plz... Otherwise I have no other go than to painfully reinstall suse, patches, updates & software.
 
Regards,
Subash.

Dear All
Yesterday my niece rang up to me and asked for explanation on various "Project
Titles " for her final Year Engg Project [ B.Tech IT ].
I asked her to go for "open source" projects. 
She replied that , the ?seniors? who took the "open source" projects felt it
difficult. They have advised the ?Juniors? to avoid ?Open Source? projects, in
spite of the fact that the ?Head of the Dept.? is interested in ?Open Source?
projects. 
My niece also attended 2 seminars on Open Source  [ RedHat and Anna univ ] 

Is there any ?booster dose? of motivation needed ?. 

Have a nice day
Thiagu

the "seniors" seem to be lazy, so any placement / interview types 
reading this email might want to take note and avoid them :)

tell her, if she thinks she can do it, she can cheerfully advise the 
"seniors" to go to hell, or wherever else they choose to go.

Let us take this as an opportunity. Why don't you approach the HOD
through your niece, organised for session where ILUGC can explain the
project potential available in FOSS?
 We will tell them about the kind of help available on net, lugs and
NRCFOSS.

Let us approach students with a list of likely projects. 

I think we should collect potential projects for students in our
wiki.

Hi Kenneth,

The page gives the timings, not the date/day. I would be interested to join
in as a participant, provided it is during the week ends. Thanks for your
initiative.

we plan to produce a huge amount of foss code - and foss code is best  
written in scripting languages, of which python is one of the best.  
So we are doing this to build up a pool of python programmers

will do the same for perl and ruby if we get faculty for them

Sounds good.  I'm sure there will be lots more people who will be
interested in coming, if the talk is more advanced than the basics
(which don't really require supervision).  Some thing about designing
large software, organizing stuff in Python, etc. :)

I'm sure that people in Chennai.rb can handle Ruby.

In fact, Vamsee (of Chennai.rb) is also pretty interested in Lisp too.
 In case you are interested. :)

AFAIK, the main problem is most of the students are starting the
project only at the last 3 months of the course. Understanding the
basic concept itself takes nearly one month. In rest of the two, apart
from interview etc, they can spent very less time for the project. So
that most of them feel very difficult to complete the FOSS Project.

looking forward to seeing your name in the 'faculty' column on the  
wiki ;-). Please add your comments in the wiki as to followups and  
topics to be covered.

You misundertood me.  I am interested in "attending" a talk like the
one I outlined.  But there is no shortage of people who can (and want
to) teach. :)

If that refers to Emacs Lisp, I would be interested as well :)

hello everybody:
Linux-based projects (part of them using only open source tools, rest mainly
java-based) have been done by many students. Some of the colleges have
developed open source based applications and are using them in-house. In
most the cases, there are HoDs/Lecturers who are enthusiastic and
knowledgeable enough to assist the students.

We can talk to the HOD concerned (and other HoD), offer them project ideas,
provide mentor support. Already, the teacher group which came for NRCFOSS
training programs have given various project titles. Kenneth is driving the
whole action -- please see nrcfosshelpline.org.

Many students start thinking about the project in october, contact companies
in november, start reading / learning in december and work only for one
month, viz. Jan. Thereafter, they have to come back to colleges for theory
courses and project documentation. Even if they have 3 months, it is not
sufficient. [Some of my students had divided the project into 2 parts :
first part was presented as project report for the Anna Univ exam, after
their exams they went to the company and completed the project during
May-Jun-Jul. At AU-KBC a couple of groups of students have done in a similar
way. In Muthayammal College, the lectuer - Ms. Krishnaveni -- has got a
group of students who have just completed the degree willing to work on FOSS
projects].

We are now advising the lecturers to identify 1-2 student group per college,
give them project ideas and reference materials in Jul-Aug, so that they
could work in earnest during Nov-Jan. Our portal could be used as wiki /
repository, provided there is interest from students. Am willing to be in
touch with the concerned colleges/HoDs/Lectures to push the thing thru.
Whenever LUG/NRCFOSS visit the colleges, we can offer our assistance in this
regard.
We can ask them to send their initial queries to <nrcfoss@au-kbc.in> -- we
can then guide them to use wiki/repository.

Srinivasan.

NRC FOSS is supporting students to do FOSS Projects, provide mentors who 
can guide the students, provide all sorts of other assistance and the 
real bonaza is we have plans even to pay them for their projects 
(successfully completed and hosted in our  repos which can be used by 
anyone).

Actually this is a very good chance for students to try out their hands 
over FOSS based projects. Our wiki 
[http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/ProjectIdeas] hosts few projects 
and students are welcomed to add more ideas. We would also be happy to 
work with ilugc (as it is always :) ) in this manner.

As Raman said, you can ask your niece to contact their HOD. We will have 
a formal session in their coll for taking FOSS based projects, have some 
GLVs and LDDs also.

Further to that mail, and on Kenneth's advice, I have started a wiki
page for this

http://www.nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/ElispTutorials

This is just a basic skeleton. I think we can decide on a date in due
course. Please add your name to the "Faculty" or "Participant" lists
there if you are interested. Would like to hear Vamsee's comments in
this regard :)

it moves on...

As we have Python tutorial and GLV this saturday, we can have it next 
saturday. Anyday is ok, as far as it doesn't clash with ilugc's 
schedules ;) and it is possible for the interested people to come all 
the way to MIT.

Thanks Roshan, for suggesting my name. Though I would normally love 
doing this, I have to excuse myself, because I expect the next one month 
to be very hectic - lots of trips, personal work, etc. Sorry. But I will 
post it in Chennai.rb's mailing list, I'm sure somebody will take this up.

Message-ID: <44C0CE47.6030705@gmail.com>

Hi all,
I remember a post about Dzongkha Debian in this mailing list. Just now I 
got to see another such initiative, this time from Nepal called as 
Nepalinux [http://nepalinux.org/]. Its great to see small countries like 
  Nepal coming out with such a Open Source initiative, but why not such 
things happening in India. I am intending to mean that nothing happens 
in India, but I feel we are a but sluggish. Why don't each state come up 
with a localized version so that installing localization support is not 
an issue and regional languages are available on fly. Correct me if am 
wrong, but this shows low level of awareness about localized FOSS 
softwares in India ;)

Government support to the field of IT is negligible - just for name sake.
Compared to India, it is nothing.  Don't ask about FOSS.  Those in the
government don't know what it is.  Not to say the political turmoil.  But
even here, Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya came up with Nepalinux (I think it did
get something out of the IndLinux).

Of course, MPP is mostly govt funded.  It surely doesn't have the mandate
and money provided to the likes of NRC-FOSS or the RCILTSes or the likes.

If you are looking for volunteers also, it will be very difficult to find -
not like India.  Very few, but committed.

As far as I know, compared to Nepal, a lot of initiatives are there in India
in this direction.  But there is lack of co-ordination and co-operation.
Most of the times, many of those centres/groups will be just reinventing the
wheel.

Before starting to do something, it will be good if some time is spent
trying to learn what is going around in the same direction.

Message-ID: <e1f90c9c0607212142h41f8d4e9gd10cb89eb15b0586@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
       Although I was able to set up ADSL on my friend's laptop quite easily
due to the excellent tool pppoeconf & instructions given at
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/Chennai_Broadband_guide#Broadband_in_Ubuntu I
have few questions perhaps the group can give some direction. I have tried &
failed (Google) to find good pppoeconf resources which explain the same.
Here's the rundown :-

Code:

pon dsl-provider
Plugin rp-pppoe.so loaded


Then after surfing when I give

 Code:

poff
/usr/bin/poff: /bin/kill failed. None stopped


I gave the command again

 Code:

poff
/usr/bin/poff: /bin/kill failed. None stopped


the same thing happens.

Then again I gave

 Code:

pon dsl-provider
 Plugin rp-pppoe.so loaded


Then after reading the man I gave

 Code:

poff -a


I get some other error but the connection is off.

Then giving the command while the connection is on

 Code:

ifconfig ppp0
link ecap : Point-to-point protocol
inet address : 59.95.14.24

P-T-P : 59.95.0.1
Mask : 255.255.255.255

UP POINT POINT RUNNING NO ARP MULTICAST
MTU: 1492 METRIC :1
Rx Packets : 18 errors :0
dropped :0 overruns :0
frame :0

Tx packets :5 errors:0
dropped :0 overruns :0
carrier :0 collisons :0
txqueueclean:3

Rx bytes :932 (932.0b)
Tx bytes : 134 (134.0b)


Now question time,
1. what is this Plugin rp-pppoe.so which is loaded? Is it a library or what
& where is it reside(location with the whole path) ?

2. of the two addresses given, one of them would be the dynamic IP which is
given by the ISP. Now of the 2 which is dynamic & what is other IP from inet
& P-T-P ?

3. The Rx packets & Tx packets would be packets received & send right? If
so, what does tx queueclean stand for?

4. Lastly, the poff has many options starting with [-r] [-d] [-c] [-a] [-h]
[up-name] , what are these options & what do they mean?


All of the things are hand-written notes as they appeared on the screen so
if some of the things should appear on the same line but appears but on the
next line as I've written then it might be what I've written & not on the
screen. So content look might be different but the content itself is 100%
                                Thnx in advance.

#perl -MCPAN -e "install <modulaname>"

For eg.,

#perl -MCPAN -e "install Digest::MD5;"

will install MD5 module and all its dependencies from
the Internet. 

This assumes that you already have CPAN::Bundle
installed of couse.

Hi all,

Here is an article written by Kevin Carmony,Linspire CEO. A good one to
read,

Kevin Carmony :

Often people lump a lot of things together, that may or may not always be
found together in a Linux product.  Many assume all things related to
"Linux" are:

1. Based on the Linux Kernel
2. Free (no cost)
3. Open sourced

These are three different things, and they can at times be mixed and
matched.

For example, Ubuntu is 1, 2 & 3.  A lot of Red Hat product is 1 and 3,  but
not 2.  Linspire is 1, but not 2, and only partially 3.  The regular version
of Freespire is 1, 2 and partially 3, and The OSS Edition of Freespire is 1,
2 & 3.  So as you can see, when someone says "Linux," it could mean
different things.

Some people are drawn to Linux because of just one or two of these.  Some
just like the technology, regardless of cost or how open it is.  They just
like the fact there are fewer viruses, etc., and that it's good to have
something out there competing with Microsoft.  Some are drawn to it because
of the low to no cost, while others like the philosophy of the code being
open.  However, you don't need to want or appreciate all three before you
can find value in Linux.  This would be like saying someone couldn't enjoy
eating at McDonalds unless they want a burger, drink and fries.  Well,
sometimes, someone may just want a burger, or just a drink.

As for me personally, I'm drawn to Linux mostly because it's an alternative
to Microsoft's offerings (#1).  I do like and appreciate that most code is
open sourced, and I like that Linux tends to cost less, but I certainly
don't need every inch of code to be open and everything to be free for me to
run it.  For example, I think Photoshop is a great product, and if it were
available for Linux, I'm sure I'd buy it if it were reasonably priced, even
if the code wasn't open.  For me it's about trust in the vendor (Microsoft
has lost that) and a FAIR and REASONABLE cost (Microsoft, because of their
monopoly in certain areas, has taken advantage of this area).  Others,
however, would never touch Photoshop because it's not free and/or open
sourced.  I have no problem with that, and respect their freedom to make
that choice.  I don't object to them wanting to choose only FOSS, but
sometimes "they" do very much object to my freedom to only choose the
technology, without the happy meal of FOSS along as well.  Some get upset
when you are enjoying the technology of Linux, without joining the religion
of OSS.  They view this as someone walking into a church, and just enjoying
the peace and beauty of the church, without becoming a full-fledged member
of that church.

For those who are just looking for an alternative OS to compete with
Microsoft's monopoly, then Mac, Linspire, and others are doing that.  For
those who insist to never run any software other than open source software,
there are choices for that (although I have yet to meet, in person, such an
individual, because even the most ardent FOSS supporters, when I meet with
them, will admit they use Java, or Flash, or nVidia drivers, or...).
Freespire is about letting the user make that choice, not some religious
leader of a movement.  Total freedom, that's Freespire.

Kevin

Greetings!

The photos taken during the "Introduction to FLOSS"
workshop held today, Saturday, July 22, 2006 at Jaya
Engineering College, Thiruninravur, Tamil Nadu, India
can be viewed here:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album32

It was an introductory session with talks on career
opportunities with FLOSS, free/libre open source
software, and the GNU/Linux desktop.

I would like to thank Prof. Kumaran, HOD, CSD for
taking the initiative and following it up. Thanks also
to Harish for his correspondence and help.

There were about 200 students during the workshop, and
they are very eager to *learn* using FLOSS. They
already have a FLOSS lab setup. This mailing list has
been provided to them for technical support.

They are planning for an LDD for August 18, 19, 2006
(Friday, Saturday) - will be confirmed by them. It
will be open to the public and will be primarily
useful to the schools, colleges in and around
Thiruninravur, and Chennai.

To those new colleges/schools who haven't had a taste
of FLOSS, I shall provide them with the contact of
NRC-FOSS (Kenneth Gonsalves, Shrinivasan, Hariram
Aatreya and others), so they can take it further -
with support from ILUGC too. 

Next, MNM Jain Engineering College, Thorapakkam.

What errors are you getting? If it is something like

"Login failed : Get the latest version of the client"

then you might have to request them to allow your IP address to use
their older sify client for GNU/Linux. For more information visit:

Let us know as root,

#lspci -v -v

(Copy paste it here)

and also

#uname -a

also,

#dmesg 

and then, if in worst case if u r willing to get into
kernel compilation orgy. :-)

Believe me, it is a snap in Debian, kernel compilation
is assisted by several tools,packages and even stock
kernel images...

Best,
Girish

Check if you can play sound as root, if you can then the group
privileges are not correct. You need to add yourself to the 'audio'
group. man usermod.

If you are using GNOME there's an easier way, from the gnome panel, go
to Desktop > Administration > 'Users and Groups'. Then select the
username for which sound is not playing and choose 'Properties'. Then
select the 'User privileges' tab and select the ones you want enabled
for that username.

Logout and login again, and try playing sound.

As root run,
apt-get install alsa-utils alsa-base alsa-utils alsa-tools alsa-oss

Then after this is installed, run alsaconf and follow accordingly ..

Hi,

Looks like you are in luck. See below.

I didn't suggest ALSA bcoz many folks don't like
it(including me). OSS is much better. You already have
an OSS driver for this as I find here.
http://www.raubacapeu.net/people/yves///help/vaioz1sp.html

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<CUT<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Sound

I tried ALSA, but it failed in 2.4 , so I am using the
OSS i810_audio module. Here is the entry in
/etc/modules.conf (in fact, in /etc/moduils/oss, as
/etc/modules.conf is generated with update-modules or
update-modules.modutils).

alias sound-slot-0 i810_audio 
options i810_audio clocking=48000
post-install sound-slot-0 /usr/bin/aumix -L >/dev/null
2>&1 || :
pre-remove sound-slot-0 /usr/bin/aumix -S >/dev/null
2>&1 || :
	

David reported to me that the sound was cutting
sometime, this behaviour is linked to X activity. It
turned out that the new O(1) schedulers were the
cause, so a quick fix was to fix the nice level of X
from -10 to 0 in /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config.

Status: ok

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<CUT<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

So what you have to do is try to load the i810_audio
module for your kernel. 

#modprobe i810_audio

If this fails for some reason I am afraid you have to
do an 
# apt-get install kernel-image-2.6.8

After that you have to boot into the 2.6.8 kernel.
Then  you will have no more problems. :-)

But since i810_audio is a very popular driver I think
your problem should be fixed without much ado. 

Best,
Girish

your mail is not very clear. I guess the drivers for ur sound card will be
already detected by the Linux installation. Assuming that you dont have a
mp3 plugin to play the songs, do the following,

1. first try playing a .wav file
2. if it works then sound card is detected correctly, so, for playing xmms
http://havardk.xmms.org/dist/xmms-1.2.7-rh8-rh9-rpm/xmms-mpg123-1.2.7-21.i386.rpm
download this file
3. double click the file and install it.
4. after installation, start xmms and see whether mp3 plays.. :-)

Thanks..

Hi pushparajan, he has clearly stated that he is using Debian 3.1, but
you have given a link to an rpm :-S

AFAIK in Debian if you do a apt-get install xmms the mp3 plugin also
comes in handy and ready to use. So there is no need for the plugin
installation explicitly.

Also if he is able to play the audio file as root and not in the case
of the user he has created after installation, then it is related to
permissions to the /dev/dsp. I was stuck with this problem quite a
number of times in Debian.

The simple thing which I could do for the above is

$ su chmod 777 /dev/dsp

Then try playing the audio files in xmms.

oops.. sorry.. RPM was not supported by default by Debian.. you need alien

Check for what?

If unit testing is what you mean there is JUnit. For functional
testing of web pages you can give selenium a try.

JUnit is for java. However there is a similar testing framework for each lang.

The right (tm) way of doing this is, either run "adduser <user> audio"
to add him to the audio group, or edit /etc/group and add <user> to
the entry corresponding to audio. It's much more elegant, and the
right way to handle other groups like "video", "dip", "dialout" etc.

Hi,
  For Web based testing you can use Selenium - http://openqa.org/selenium.
For GNOME based application you can use LDTP -
http://ldtp.freedesktop.orgin Linux, for Windows based application you
can use Pywinauto -
http://openqa.org/pywinauto.

Thanks

If your system has support for NTFS file system either as a kernel 
module or built into the kernel, you can do:

shell> sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/partition /mnt # attach partition under /mnt
shell> sudo umount /mountpoint # unmount

fedora 4 does not have support for NTFS *built-in* but you can add
kernel module to add read support but you cannot write into it. You
may read http://www.fedorafaq.org/fc4/#ntfs for details on how to add
read support on fc4.

Here's a thought,

Why don't we put up a wiki page as the GLV sessions unfold, update the
wiki-page with the details of the talk (done by the presenter) and a
few comments from the audience on how that particular talk helped them
or how it could have been better.

Also, if we could have the slides made available online, then we can
have yearly GLV programmes. The material would be available online ,
hence the speaker can be replaced (if the original speaker is
un-available) too. This way we could start off GLV every MAY-JUNE
(vacation time) and wind it up by NOV-DEC (before the final exams).

This would we could have our own GNU/Linux Training programme which
will be conducted in a fully open manner.

Wiki page is already thought of. Since, we have problem with our wiki
pages, it is not done yet. Will be done once things are ok.

This is a nice idea. We can work on this line taking present series
as trial, continue it with required changes every year/half year.

Also, if such a thing is done, all members of ilugc can themselves 
handle some GLV sessions around the year, may be in schools and other 
local locations anywhere in India. Thus ilugc can become much more 
active and its scope wide spread rather than a few LDDs and occasional 
'outside' GLVs. :)

Message-ID: <20060726083945.GB30149@localhost.localdomain>

hi,
   I recently installed Debian Sarge 3.1 on my system(kernel-2.6.8).I am having problem in soundcard.The card is listed in

Try this as root. 

# cat (some-wave-file.wav) > /dev/dsp*

You should hear some noise. If you hear something ,
then it may be a silly permission issue for non root. 
For locating a wav file, 
Just run 
$locate .wav
after optionally running updatedb as root...

I think you are almost there ! :-)

Normally all apps use /dev/dsp. It could be
/dev/dsp1.1, /dev/dsp2 or any such thing. In case
there is a confusion you can always 
# ln -s /dev/dsp2 /dev/dsp 

in case no /dev/dsp exists and dsp2 is ur real device.


Also as an aside for such sound problems it is better
to use mplayer , mpg321 or even browser flash player
instead of xmms. Just a thought. 

Another good way is to try if aumix works.

Girish

Hmm, I suggest slides be available in a By-Attribution, Share-Alike,
Commercial(?) Creative Commons License. The Commercial tag there is a
bit iffy, are we ok with other's making use of ILUGC content for
commercial training, remember the original author will be attributed
anyways.

What are the next steps required to take this plan forward from a
"thought" to an "action-plan". Can we use a temporary wiki to plan the
GLV sessions, NRC-FOSS wiki ?

Yes. We could use the nrcfosshelpline wiki:

Hi,

I was thinking about the recent hype-hoopla w.r.t Web services. JAVA, XML, WSDL , SOAP, UDDI etc terminologies have been thrown around like volleyballs in a beach. I was just trying to find an analogy between RoR and the web services - in the sense, what constitutes a service as a web-service , as such? I do not have much understanding of the said concepts and would like to know more.

AFAIK Ajax is hot in Silicon Valley. Gmail and google
maps are good examples. Asynchronous XML + Javascript.

SOAP though originally from M$ seems to have good wide
spread use by folks including google. 

Ajax programming is hard; so I believe it has
potential ; also it is cool as it gives an excellent
end user experience hitherto unimaginable. Dynamic
updation of web pages and background fetch enable user
not to perceive the network latency as pages are
fetched asynchronously. Much before the user thinks of
clicking at them. 

Also the "applet" concept which failed works *very*
well with Ajax. The browser takes a good part of
processing onto itself. 

This deadly combo makes for powerful ammunition with
which web developers can design the next incarnation
of Internet and browser centric applications. 

Today the browser by virtue of flash and other things
is able to play video perfectly, even under linux. I
envisage a future in which the browser becomes a one
stop app for everything. 

Also Ajax forms a very important building block for
Web 2.0 (which is again hype).

I know nothing other than expansions for the other
terms you mentioned. :-)

XML also was big hype, but folks compare it with ASN.1
and I think it has not delivered on its promise though
it is a powerful concept. XML/SGML seems to be popular
with DocBook and other document preparation tasks. 

Also XML config files and information exchanges;i.e,
XML based protocols like SOAP are popular. But I think
sometimes XML is an overkill as it kills the
efficiency of binary protocols and adds too much
overhead as opposed to simple text based protocols
like SMTP, FTP or HTTP...

Bear with me if I digressed a bit. Also most of the
stuff are my opinions and not facts; hence they might
be wrong. Please correct me if you feel like...

If a service listening on a port can receive a text string (xml or yaml or
whatever), call the method specified in the text string with the arguements
passed in that string, do some action internally (like updating a db or
reading a field) and return another text string (like indicating success or
failure of the requested operation) then it is a web service.

This service could be implemented in Java/.NET/Perl/Python/Ruby/etc but the
application using this service doesnt know nor care what it is.

The acronyms refer to what format this 'text string' should be in and
specifies the protocol for exchanging the messages.

Its needs breaking new ground anyway. Just updating some part of a web page
without refreshing is not AJAX  - just JAX , although it uses
XMLHttpRequest. The new ground is in understanding what actions you can
allow the user while the AJAX call is yet to return (remember it might even
fail to return). Requires UI design skills different from the regular thick
client UIs and the regular webpages.

If the Internet is a true indicator of the technology and various advancements in communication and infrastructure thats happ arnd, then i feel a computer with just a broswr, should be able to satisfy ALL your requirements. What i mean is, there is no concept of an OS ; the browser is the only program running in the system and once its loaded, the user should be able to connect to the Net and get all his job done. Almost, all the desktop clients have their equivalent thin clients (or web-services) and hence this shouldnt be a problem.

However, when i envisaged this - i do have made reservations about the available bandwidth.

Your opionns solicited.

Well you can include a whole new set of accessibility problems that are 
brought in when you use AJAX, but thats not part of AJAX anyways.

So, essentially AJAX is easy, but the way to tackle problems it 
introduces is interestingly difficult.

You can see the draft auto-saving in GMail is a nice use of AJAX (yes 
its asynchronous), but tell me, would implementing it be difficult?  Not 
at all.

AFAIK it is impossible to do that in any modern OS.

However using a certain concept called CBQ or
hierarchical token bucket "qdisc" discpline, you can
achieve some QOS. Technically referred to as traffic
shaping.

But mind you; you only shape the "egress" traffic or
outgoing packets along the lines of the bandwidth
throttling code u find in FTP or HTTP.

It is much harder to shape ingress flows. And to get
it right both ways... Well I am sure you get the
drift.

All this is feasible only on different machines. A lot
of efforts should go in to make it work with different
users like the file quotas. 

Since networking code is in the kernel and does not
see users on top.

That said, it is trivial of course to work around this
and achieve what you want by simply associating
certain users with certain machines. :-)

You can find a truly fasctinating description of these
things in the advanced routing howto here

http://lartc.org

Enjoy!

As an aside in *BSD you have ALTQ which has
implemented  nearly everything got to do with QOS like
Intserv, Diffserv, MPLS what not. Take a look at that
too. I haven't yet got time to play with it yet. But
they are the pioneers; so it shud certainly be good.

Sun has been saying for many years that the network is the computer -
everything else is just a UI device. Only they thought java would be running
on all the UI devices. But looks like language independent http would
satisfy this dream.

Hi All,

I  have planned to buy an SBC (single board computer ) running linux on MIPS
or ARM architecture.
I would prefer a low cost board with minimum ethernet and serial interfaces
.
if any of one here have an experience please share with us.

Thanks,

When you buy a development board, you try to spend as
much as possible and get all that you want. You never
know what you might need later, and these things can't
be upgraded unless you have hardware provision for
peripherals that you can mount or solder later.

I have not used MIPS. Here are some ARM development
board links:

Thanks Hari.

GLV presenters please consider leaving in a link to your slides on the
wiki page.
For those people who can't host their slides, can something be done ?

Will using something like rapidshare (http://rapidshare.de) be considered ok ?

Is there any place in India (preferrably chennai or banglaore) where I can

its not part of AJAX i agree. but that should disturb the usual way of

auto saving draft in GMail is nice use. but it give me some jerk while
saving which makes me uncomfortable. implementing it may be easy. but
it should not affect end user's browsing experience.
Technology should be user friendly. and not because it is easy to
implement , it should be implemented

BTW I never said that anything that is easy to implement should be 
implemented.

AJAX is used for enhancing (preferably an existing) user experience. 
GMail's auto save draft is an excellent example, if you feel the web 
page is jerking, thats a bug you should notify Google about it. Think 
about implementing the same without the use of AJAX, you'll know that 
using AJAX enhances the experience.  Similarly, rating a post in Google 
groups or Yahoo! Message Boards.  If you disable JavaScript, the page 
still works, but with JavaScript, you have an enhanced/easy experience.

Its not the problem of AJAX, but the programmer that wrote the piece of

Use of AJAX doesn't consume a lot of bandwidth, OTOH it reduces by 
fetching the data to update only parts of the page.

hi all:
we can also have a set of basic packages : topics and slides --- for
half-day training, full-day training -- as a workshop. As and when situation
demands, additional modules could be added for a given session.

Since the training is generally given by LUG members, we could download them
on to a laptop and take to places where we conduct the training program.

For instance, I am giving below the msg from Thiruvalluvar College of Engg &
Tech. The LUG can handle the initial training part. Thereafter, I could
coordinate -- with suggestions & help from mentors (LUG and other groups) --
re the projects which needs  initial interactions with management and
constant prodding. We can check up whether it is feasible to call small
groups from nearby colleges -- depending on the interest of host & guest
colleges. If the guests are interested, we could offer separate programs for
them.
[e.g.: Adiparasakthi College of Engg, Kalavai ; AMACE, Vadamavandal ;
Priyadarshini Engg College, Cheavappanur ; Ranipet Engg College,
Thenkadappanthangal ; Sri Balaji Chockalingam Engg College, Irumpedu ;
Thirumalai Engg College, Krishnapuram]

think this scenario also,,in gmail i am reading a mail and if i
refresh the page, thats it. everything gets reloaded and go  to the
inbox instead of the message which i read before. if we use normal
stuff, it would not be like that. in yahoo mail and all, u could
referesh and stay in the message where you are.

Hello all,

Greetings from the Linux For You magazine team!

As you all know, two months ago we launched a new initiative called
CommunitySpeak where we pose a question to various ILUG mailing lists
and publish the top five responses (selected by our technical editors)
in the magazine. Thanks to all those who responded to last month's
question. The best among the responses received are to be published in
the August 2006 issue of LFY. We have contacted the chosen respondents
off-list.

This month we have chosen the topic: "What does one gain from
participating in an open source project that he/she does not gain from
a regular work environment?"

What's your take on this? Our eyes and ears are wide open and we are
waiting to listen to your views. Please write to us at
writetojanani@gmail.com with a CC to atul.goel@efyindia.com, before
5th August 2006.

The top five responses will be published in the September 2006 issue
of Linux for You.

Look forward to your responses.

Thanks,

Janani Gopalakrishnan, Freelance Writer
Atul Goel, Asst. Associate Editor, LFY

I just came accross this file .cvsignore. I guess, you can store the
files to ignore in this file within any CVS directory. Refer [1] for
details.

The above link has something for slackware. It should work for you also
because the kernel is independent of distro. After all its inserting a
module.

(Bangalore) August 23-24 2006
To: prc@sarai.net

Hi List,

Free Software Foundation, India
(http://www.gnu.org.in) is organizing the Fourth
International Conference on GPLv3 in Bangalore.

The press release of this event:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bangalore to Host the Fourth International Conference
on GPLv3

India will host the Fourth International GPLv3
Conference in Bangalore,
this August 23-24, 2006. A part of the world-wide
drive to create awareness
about the upcoming version three of the GNU General
Public License (GPLv3),
the two-day conference is expected to draw delegates
from across the
communities - legal, bureaucrat and academia. While
the first day will see
Richard M Stallman and Eben Moglen, the original
architects of the GPLv3
license, communicating latest updates on the GPLv3
final draft, the second
day holds panel discussions on localisation, awareness
and adoption of
GPLv3 and threat of Digital Restrictions Management
(DRM).

The event to be held at the Indian Institute of
Management - Bangalore
is a sequence to the Third International GPLv3
Conference that took place
in Barcelona, Spain. Similar events have already been
held in the USA and
Brazil. The international GPLv3 conferences are part
of a year-long public
consultation process to update the GNU General Public
License (GPL).

The version 3 of the GPL, essentially, takes into
account changes in terms
of legal and technical environment, in which software
licenses operate, and
the need to increase protection against new threats
such as software
patents and Digital Restrictions Management (DRM). The
worldwide awareness
drive for GPLv3, is to ensure that, all users of
software distributed under
its terms, have the freedom to examine, share, and
modify that software.

For registration kindly visit GPLv3 conference website
http://gplv3.gnu.org.in

For Details, kindly contact:

Arun M (FSF-I) arun@gnu.org.in

Prof Rahul De' (IIM-B) rahul@iimb.ernet.in

Abhas Abhinav (FSUG-Bangalore) abhas@deeproot.co.in

Catch hold of a local expert or a friend who has linux
experience. Don't lose money over sat, sunday classes.

Try to get someone who can help you thro' the install
and teach you the basics. After that you can learn on
your own. Don't get befooled by jazzy ads behind town
buses and posters on lamp posts. 9 out of 10 of such
are commercial with very little technical focus. 

That said if you are zero then it certainly helps to
get started albeit with errors if these courses cost
only a couple thousand bucks. :-)

All the best!

Linux recently became the most ported OS on earth
crossing NetBSD in terms of the archs it supports. 

There is really no question as to whether some piece
of hardware is supported by Linux as not. 

However drivers for certain very rare, very new TV
cards or some esoteric hardware whose data sheets are
not avaiable or companies that don't release any
hardware info don't exist.

Still using certain Windoze firmware and some reverse
engineering some linux folks have succeeded in
supporting some devices. For instance certain
Winmodems used for dialup come to mind.

By and large an unbelievably wide array of hardware is
very well supported by linux. 

In fact I find my TV card is better supported by
"tvtime" and linux drivers than the company supported
drivers for Windoze. 

What do u say to that eh? Cool, isn't it? :-)

check this one : http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/compaq.html

Note: My 'Lenovo 3000 N100 0689 5KA' is not even an IBM supported Linux
Laptop. Still, I run Ubuntu Dapper Drake pretty well in my Laptop,
though I had problems with FC5 and Suse10 (with the display and X
especilly, it couldn't detect my display device and was running in
600X480 mode) Dapper runs in pretty higher mode and as of now everything
works now. I haven't tested blue tooth but have got it detected. The
thing is miss is the finger print reader, for which IBM doesn't provide
Linux Drivers for my model :(. Still, am 99.99% happy with my lappy and
Linux on it :)

Forgot to mention some things. Sorry.

Certain "commercial" distros like Redhat/Fedora, Suse
may not support old hardware or certain laptops. 

But linux is a kernel and is not dependent on distros.
If you try something like Debian or Gentoo I am sure
you won't have trouble.

And laptops are quirky; so I think your question is
certainly valid.

Not too sure if it is a firefox problem or even the
"responsibility" of firefox.

Typically such things are done at the network
periphery by installing a firewall that blocks out
http, ftp, https traffic.

In which case you can't browse also. :-(

If you want to block certain MIME types like
mp3,videos, mail sites etc. then several companies
sell such software for a heavy price which again work
at the network periphery. 

I have heard that squid ( http://www.squid-cache.org/
) 
can do the job for free! There might be some experts
in the list ( I know at least one) who can help you 
with the setup.

All the best!

Message-ID: <adc51dea0607291222o6122e9c6yfaf07a338f2f5c4b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Luggies,

This years FOSS.IN is also gonna be in Bangalore after all the
discussions that happened for various locations including Chennai,
Goa.

FOSS.IN/2006 will be held on November 24/25/26 (Friday-Sunday) at the
National Science Symposium Centre of the Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore.

An extract of the mail sent by Atul Chitnis(a.k.a toolz) to the
announce list is below.

~---------------------~----------------------------~---------------------
All,

This afternoon I completed the formalities related to booking of the venue
for FOSS.IN/2006.

FOSS.IN/2006 will be held on November 24/25/26 (Friday-Sunday) at the
National Science Symposium Centre of the Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore.

This year's event will be formatted very differently, taking the best from
the old Linux Bangalore and last year's FOSS.IN events, and adding new
aspects to it, to ensure that it has more and lasting impact on the growth
of Free & Open Source Software in India.

Some of these aspects are being nailed down in the background, and I will
be discussing them on this list over the coming days.

But for now, you have dates and a place, so start preparing. The Call for
Participation will be out in a couple of days as well.

And start discussing. We had an initial discussion today during the July
BLUG meet, and many good ideas and suggestions came up, and we will be
presenting those ideas on this list as well.

Atul

Hi all,

I have some problem in receiving mails send from hotmail to mydomain.
The fetchmail logs says

fetchmail: SMTP listener doesn't really like recipient address

Here my MTA is sendmail.

But when i am using postfix MTA and a different version of fetchmail
its working fine.
Hotmail by default place a ; in between the addresses.

can anybody provide points to solve this issue?

Try out TLDP - The Linux Documentation Project - http://www.tldp.org. You
have got many guides, tutorials online and also I think they are
downloadable. It covers from basics to advanceed linux concepts too like,
writing kernel modules etc.,.

Hi,

I do collect ebooks; regardless of copyright.
Maybe its sort of a hobby for me. Why sweat, i dont sell it and i rarely use
it...

And,
believe me I feel its very difficult to read an entire ebook.
I rather prefer to read the hardcopy.
I do have printed version of this book.

My suggestion:
1. buy the book...

2. join a good library having good technical books.
If you are not in any institution/organisation to access their library, try
some private libraries in chennai, like Eloor(i assume they still have a
decent collection of tech books).

3. if you are working for some firm that does not have a good library, you
can always buy and submit the books for the library and get it reimbursed.

Thanks and lots of luck...

Dear all,

   Me and Bhaskar did an 1/2day seminar to +1,+2 students at SCS
Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Nehru Nagar, Chromepet. We
covered basic commands (as in syllabus) apart from an overview of
other  software like gimp.

   We installed debian/ubuntu in 4 computers. We showed other
educational software like gcompris, kanagram, kperiodic etc to the
teachers and management. They are impressed with them, especialy
gcompris. They planning to allow primary school children to use them.

  On behalf of ILUGC, I thank the Management, teachers and students
of SCS Matriculation Higher secondary school, Chromepet.

Raman.P

Nice Specs. Everything should wokr out of the box.
Yes, all Intel-x86 PC's will support Linux. If you have any exotic
hardware you might need to google a bit.

R&D is done in the mind, not on a laptop. :)

What I meant was a PC is just a a tool through which you implement a
POC or an idea. Just having a laptop will not fetch you new idea's and
epiphanies. People have done lot's of amazing with without owning a
PC.

-- Thanks for pointing that we need a medium like PC/Laptop to implement
ideas and do business communications in today's market.

-- Also I understand those ancient people who has done lot's of amazing
stuff with without owning a PC . At least, they didn't build the "Bird
Nest" Olympic stadium at Beijing.

Subject: [Ilugc] Weird network problem
Message-ID: <44CDB36D.4060501@gmx.net>


I'm facing a weird network issue which is not directly a Linux kernel
issue., but I'm not sure.

The following is the layout of the network which causes the issue.

{mailserver}------\
203.129.914.19    |
                  |---{switch}----{firewall}-\
                  |                          |
{proxy server}----/                          |
203.129.194.20                               |
                                       {cisco router}
                                       203.129.194.17
                                             |
                                             |
                                          {modem}
                                             |
                                             |
                                        {ISP router}
                                       203.129.194.201
                                             |
                                             |
                                         Internet


- The 'switch1' is a normal Dlink switch

- The 'firewall' is a PIII box running gnu/linux. It bridges traffic
between eth0 to eth1., and in the process denies some incoming
connections and unwanted outgoing connections (basic iptables +
bridging)

- The router is a Cisco router.

The problem: This issue happens randomly. We are not able to identify a
pattern or reason why this happens. At some random times.,
203.129.194.201 will not be reachable from the 'mailserver'. The 'cisco
router' would be reachable (via a ping) from the 'mailserver'. A
traceroute from the 'mailserver' to an external site (like
www.google.com) would end with the 'cisco router'. But all other
machines ('proxy server') would not have a problem. A 'ifdown-ifup'
cycle on the 'mailserver' fixes the issue.

I verified the route configuration which is as follows., and that is not
the one that is responsible for the problem.

Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use
Iface
203.129.194.16  0.0.0.0         255.255.255.240 U     0      0        0 eth1
10.0.0.0        0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 eth0
0.0.0.0         203.129.194.17  0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth1

I suspected the router., but the router's configuration has not been
touched in years., and it has been running fine for atleast 3 years now
(to my knowledge). A restart of the router did not solve the issue.
'ifdown-ifup' cycle on the mailserver solves the issue., so it does not
seem anything related to the router.

The rules in the firewall either allow traffic out or dont. If a machine
behind the firewall is able to reach 203.129.194.17., it means it the
firewall has passed it through.

Any clues or pointers would be very helpful.

ARP cache might be getting corrupted.

Execute this on ur mailserver as root.

# arp -d 203.129.194.201

might do the same thing as ifdown , ifup on the
mailserver. If this solves the problem then at least
you know what the problem is. 

But I am only guessing. So take it with a pinch  of
salt.

Best,

But., there is no way the mailserver would know the MAC address of
203.129.194.201. There is another router in the middle (the cisco
router) which routes traffic other than the subnet 203.129.194.16/28 to
the ISP router. And when the issue occurs on the mailserver., all other
machines (except the mailserver) work fine. So that means the ARP of the
cisco router is fine.

Try clearing the ARP caches completely once in a
while. You can try clearing the Cisco router ARP entry
then. 

Other than that what does ifdown/ifup do? It might do
much more but this seems to be a good reason to me. 

One good thing to do would be to figure out how often
ur mail server talks out on the network. Dumping
tcpdump to a file and analyzing what goes wrong when
would help. 

Networking problems can get really hairy. I suggest
you analyze your problem using as many tools as
possible. 

First analyze all packet data using a good sniffer
like tcpdump. Figure out a patten between when this
problem comes and the packet sequence just before
that.

Once we have data and zero in on the problem then the
workaround/ solution can always be worked out. 

HTH,
Girish

Hmm., I'll have to check the ARP cache of the 'cisco router' next time
this happens. But when the issue happens., the 'Cisco router' routes all
other packets correctly to the 'ISP router'., so that address could not
be screwed. It is possible that the cache entry for the 'mailserver' is
screwed. However, when the issue happens., the 'Cisco router' responds
to pings from the 'mailserver'. That means., it does have the correct
MAC address entry in the cache.

Anywayz., I'll check this the next time the issue happens.

This is something that should be helpful. I did not try this. I can do
this on the 'firewall' box.

You cannot rule out a hardware issue here in the NIC
chip of the ethernet card. What card is it? Realtek?
Intex? 

You can check for hardware problem by stressing the
receive path of the NIC. Only recv causes interrupts
and NICs normally expose their problem that way.

Try this at the mailserver machine.

$ scp -r user@cisco-router:/usr .

If you find that after a few minutes nothing happens
then you can rule out hardware issue.

If you get a checksum error or network disconnect in
the hub , then it is time to get your card replaced.

Anyway pls observe the problem for some time and
theorize after you have data. Observe tcpdump output
for a while. What particular packet exchange causes
this behavior? Or is it after a certain period of
time?

As Arthur Conan Doyle says,

" It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have
all the facts. You cannot build bricks without clay."

:-)

I enjoyed this thread. 

All the best! Kindly let us know what the problem
turned out to be in the end.

regards,
Girish

If its a dirt cheap and poor quality ethernet card like one of those, 
then it is quite likely to get solved by replacing the card

Another thing - if that router is also the NAT gateway for your office 
PCs, then see if you cant seperate your LAN gateway IP and your 
mailserver IP .. you wont have junk traffic from your LAN [and infected 
systems, older windows installs etc can generate a ton of that], and 
this problem would be minimized even more.

Greetings!

I conducted an "Introduction to FLOSS" workshop today,
Monday, July 31, 2006 at MNM Jain Engineering College,
Thorappakkam, Tamil Nadu, India.

I would like to thank Prashant Mohan (ILUGC), Vidhya
Shankar (student), Assitant Professor Muthu Sundar
(Assistant Professor, CSE) for taking the initiative.

I discussed career opporunities with FLOSS, introduced
the GNU/Linux desktop, and played the movie, "The
Revolution OS".

IBM has started doing some good projects using
GNU/Linux with the college. 

http://www-304.ibm.com/jct09002c/university/scholars/

Prof. Muthu Sundar is already in touch with NRC-FOSS,
and is planning to get more students to do FLOSS
projects with them.

Regards,

SK

P.S.: My camera was not avaliable during this time, so
I couldn't take any photographs.

*) Applied Cryptography by Bruce Shneier (around 40$)
(Bible of every cryptographer)

*)Handbook of cryptography 
(http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/) Too
mathematical - stay away from it! :-) But it is free
to download.

*) A simple google search will throw up lot of links.
Many of which are good. I used to like the FAQ in
www.rsasecurity.com

Bear in mind that certain concepts like public key
cryptography take a *lot* of time to understand and
sink in. 

Even "The Code Book" by Simon Singh is good. 

For practical exposure to crypto I suggest you join
openssl-users@openssl.org and install and try out
www.openssl.org

This comes standard with all Unices these days. 

You could also take a look at 

www.openbsd.org once you get really hooked onto
crypto. They have a browseable CVS interface of the
entire source tree and you will find lot of treasures
there. Especially kernel crypto used for IPsec,
hardware engines and so on.

I think it is /usr/src/sys/crypto for crypto code.

And IPsec is under /usr/src/sys/netinet

But take one step at a time. It is a penance of
several years. 

Wish you all the best!

Crypto is the most fascinating topic and the smartest
brains on the planet are at work in it!

Best,

Yeah ,NAG and SAG are both good. But you need some
basic crypto theory to start with or else everything
will go right above your head. 

And there is lot of confusion in terminology as
regards what people mean by "network security".

Does it mean SSL or IPsec?
Or does it mean IPS, IDS or firewalls?
Or does it mean Spams and viruses?
Or does it mean crypto like OpenSSL?
Or does it mean using tools like nessus,nemesis or nc?

In fact really everything related to security comes
under the broad umbrella called "network security".

And for someone asking for books or resources I
thought it pertinent to start with basic and crypto
was the least common denominator for everything. 

Best,
