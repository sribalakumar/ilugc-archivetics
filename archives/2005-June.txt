Mr Shakthi (ILUGC-Member) rewritten the Linux Device Driver example 
programs, from Rubini's Book, in a very simple manner. So that a 
beginner can understand the code very easily.
URL: http://www.shakthimaan.com -> Downloads

One Day One Command
===================

lsb_release  -- Show Linux Standard Base and Distribution info.

Summary:

If the installation is LSB compliant, the "/etc/lsb-release"  file
should contain the LSB_VERSION field and other optional fields like
DISTRIB_ID, DISTRIB_RELEASE, DISTRIB_CODENAME, DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION.

lsb_release will read the above config file and show the details in 
different format. It is useful command to find your distribution 
informations.

Example:

$ lsb_release -- Show the LSB version number.

$ lsb_release -i -- Display the distributor ID or Name.

$ lsb_release -d -- Display the single line text description of the 
                    distribution.

$ lsb_release -r -- Display the release number of the distribution.

$ lsb_release -c -- Display the distribution code-name.

$ lsb_release -a -- Display all of the above information.

$ lsb_release -s -- Show only field values, not the filed name.

$ lsb_release -ds -- Show only field values, not the filed name.

$ lsb_release -as -- Show in short format.

Read: man lsb_release

Lucky you.

I was not able to connect to BSNL for the past 10
days. The telephone line was ok, but, the WAN and
PPPOE port didn't blink at all. Thought it was a
problem with the exchange. I guess its somewhat fixed
now. Been calling 16004241600 daily.

Now I still get :

/usr/sbin/adsl-start: line 194: 3952 Terminated
$CONNECT "$@" > /dev/null 2>&1
---------------------------------------

I too get the same error , but am able to connect and browse sites and
receive mail too.
So I do not bother about adsl-start and adsl-stop. It is like a tap, just
open, have your fill and go!

But this is not the correct procedure, but since my needs are fulfilled, I
am yet to poke around. Will post back after I get some positive results.

Now, it connects fine on my laptop with
"...Connected!". 

But, it doesn't seem to connect from my desktop which
acts as a router. Have to experiment on NIC interfaces
and do lot of tests. Argh!

I think it is not supposed to be redistributed. You need to get in
touch Redhat to get a copy for yourself.

RHEL is not sharable like Fedora or other community distributions. If
you want this for testing I suggest you to try with White Box Linux or
CentOS which are made based on RHEL.

The ISO images even if you borrow them will not work for updates without 
RHN registration and you really need a updated machine to test it properly

It will be fine if it contains the explanations of each point. When I
started posting to this list somebody told me here not to top post. I
didint understood this and continued doing the same. The subscription

Hi all, 

I have a problem in sending a signals to a process which I created
through another program.

Problem defn:

I have 2 program "sig1.c" and "sig2.c". I want to create the executable
process of sig2.c while executing sig1.c output and I implemented  
in sig1.c with this call

system(sig2 &);  /* tried ecexlp also no success */ 

After executing 

#./sig1

#ps -ax shows both the process,  both the process(sig1 and sig2 with
different PID) are created. 

Here if I send signal "kill -SIGUSR1 to both the PID , only sig1 is able
to recieve not sig2.( like I am printing in a file some printf
statement)

I want signal to reach sig2 also..but its not happening...
Any pointers!

regards
Raja

Crossposting:
----------------
Do not crosspost. Crossposting means sending a single message to 
multiple mailing lists by putting all their addresses in the To: or CC: 
field of your message. Mailing list subscribers hate this because it 
sometimes causes people replying to the post to inadvertently posting to 
other lists 9which they do not want to, since it reveals their email 
address on lists they aren't subscribed to) and also insults the basic 
mailing list itself, but showing that you do not have faith enough in 
this mailing list to get an answer, and are therefore covering multiple 
bets. If you need to send the same message to multiple mailing lists, do 
it one at a time, so that the message appears to be only for that list.

If you do a BCC to the list, the entire purpose of group discussion is 
gone. When a user is replying to your message from a group that is in 
your BCC address, the group itself will not be included. It will rather 
become a point to point discussion.

There are other and better managed lists to choose from if you need
rules like this.

|
|
| How do I post to the list?
|
| When you subscribed, you probably received an information file about
the list. Included in this information is usually the mail address to
which posts should be mailed. Typically, if you contacted the address
wilma-request@mail.server.site to subscribe to the group, then the
posting address will be wilma@mail.server.site. Or, if you contacted a
LISTSERV or Majordomo server at mail.server.site to subscribe to the
list betty, then the list address will likewise be betty@mail.server.site.
|
| When replying to messages you receive from the list, you should
acquaint yourself with the reply options of your mail reader. Most mail
programs will have at least two reply modes: private and group. A
private reply will go only to the person who sent the original message.
A group reply by default should go to the original author, the list, and
to any people who received private copies of the original message. You
should be able to edit this list of addresses to reduce it to just the
list address, plus any other people you think should receive private copies.
|
| Please make sure that your postings have a meaningful subject line, as
many people use this to help determine which posts to read and which to
ignore when they're operating under time constraints. If you're replying
to a message and the topic of your reply is drifting from the original
subject, then edit it. A common convention is to change a subject of
``Wilma's hair'' to ``Betty's hair (was Wilma's hair)'' when you do this
to provide continuity between the threads. Try to snip off any obsolete
``was'' bits though, or subject lines can get unmanageably long.
|
| Finally, do not use deceptive subject lines that you think may help
attract attention. It may work once or twice, but like the boy who cried
wolf, if you keep wasting people's time in this way, they'll soon start
ignoring your posts entirely. Honesty, clarity and conciseness are the
best policy when composing your subject line.
|
|
| Is there anything I should not post to the list?
|
| The basic rule is that as long as your post has some content related
to the primary subject of the list, and does not contain much off-topic
material, then it is fine for the list. Specifically, for almost every
list, this will immediately rule out many or all commercial ads,
postings on how to make money (such as MAKE MONEY FAST), sociology
surveys, help with homework, hot international news, and requests for
people to send birthday greetings to your friend.
|
| Also, you should not post inflammatory (aka flame) mail to the list.
It is perfectly fine to disagree with people publicly, but be careful
how you do it. For example, if you think someone is lying on a subject,
it may be fine to say ``Betty's claims about Wilma's hair stylist are a
lie,'' but it is over the line to say ``Betty is a liar''.
|
| On the flip side, if someone posts something with which you are in
particular agreement, that's great. You should not, however, follow up
to the list with a post containing no more than ``Me too!'' or ``Right
on, brother!'' If you have something of substance to add to the
discussion, then by all means do so, but if you simply wish to express a
simple agreement, then do it in private mail.
|
| You should not post subscribe or unsubscribe requests to the list.
They won't do any good there, and will do little more than annoy other
subscribers (unless they're filtered out by the list server, in which
case they will only annoy the list owner: not exactly a winning move
either). When you subscribe to the list, you should receive a file
explaining among other things, how to unsubscribe: keep this! If worst
come to worst, and you really cannot figure out how to leave the list,
contact the list owner and ask (politely) for help.
|
| You should also not repost private email to the list unless you have
obtained prior consent from the author. Such reposting is at best
considered extremely rude, and in some legal jurisdictions may be a
violation of copyright, or other rights of the original author.
|
| See also the related section on binaries and other large files.
|
|
| Are there any important formatting considerations?
|
| Visual formatting is very important in a textual medium like email. If
your postings are poorly formatted, they will be hard to read, and
people will tire of them quickly. As a result, fewer people will read
what you write to the end, and many will begin to skip your posts entirely.
|
| Most importantly, learn to use the enter (or return) key on your
keyboard. The video display width of many network users is limited to 80
columns, and text which wraps beyond that length is quite a bit more
difficult to read. Since your text may be indented when quoted by others
you should keep your lines to a maximum length somewhere below that
point -- around 70 characters is a good target. There are of course
exceptions, such as wide tables, and long URLs, but the rule is to keep
it well under 80.
|
| Be careful if you use a program which wraps your posts when you send
them. If you wrap at a wider column than it does, you may end up with
alternating long and short lines where it wraps one or two words from
each long line, but fails to join them to the next. If you know that
your software operates this way, you may be best off to simply write
each paragraph as one long line, and let it do all the wrapping. Be very
sure that this is the case though, as postings that come through with
really long, single line paragraphs are also annoying to read.
|
| Wrapping at a considerably narrower margin, such as 40 characters is
also more difficult to read, as one must page down much more often.
However, don't be afraid to use blank lines to separate your paragraphs,
and do break your text into paragraphs. In fact, keeping paragraphs
fairly short is also easier to read; around ten lines is a good upper limit.
|
| Be careful when using tabs for indenting, as they will display
differently on other platforms. Also, avoid control characters and other
fancy visual effects which are likely platform specific. When composing
(and reading) mail, you're best to stick with a mono-spaced font (as
opposed to proportionally spaced), and avoid anything other than the
most basic text you can use to get your message across.
|
|
| Is properly grammer and speeling imprtnt, d00dz?
|
| Like formatting, grammar and spelling are also very important in a
textual medium. One author, whose name I have forgotten, has compared
posting material containing glaring grammar and spelling mistakes with
being dirty and unkempt in personal contacts. In any case, your postings
reflect on you, so you should be proud of them.
|
| Also keep in mind, that with the proliferation of network indexing
services, it is becoming easier all the time to quickly compile a
personality profile of a network user based on what he or she posts,
both to Usenet, and (currently to a lesser extent) on mailing lists. Be
aware that your friends, family, romantic interests, and employers
(current and future) will all have access to this information. Again,
others will judge you based on both what you say, and how you say it, so
give each posting careful thought.
|
| On the flip side, it is generally not worthwhile to publicly correct
the spelling or grammar in something written by someone else. For many
users on the net, English is not their first language, and even for some
for whom it is, they may have disabilities which prevent them from using
it as easily as others. Some people will appreciate correction, and take
it as a learning experience, but it should always be done via private
mail (never publicly), and you should tread carefully.
|
| Finally, do use punctuation, and put spaces in the right places around
it. Also, use capitalization properly (NO SHOUTING, please), and avoid
using short forms such as dropping vowels, or substituting 4/for, u/you,
r/are and so on. Such practices might make things easier for you, but it
makes deciphering your writing that much harder for everyone else who
you're expecting to read it. You can make an exception for smilies and
common acronyms, such as OTOH, YMMV, BTW, and such, but don't overdo it,
and be careful not to confuse your audience.
|
| In short, to borrow from the informal guideline given in many network
protocols: be conservative in what you produce and liberal in what you
accept.
|
|
| How long can I make my .sig?
|
| Ideally it should be as short as possible while still getting across
whatever you feel is important that it contain. The very best .sig of
all is probably just a single line with your name and email address.
Remember that while an ASCII graphic or witty saying may be cool the
first time, it's going to be boring by the time someone sees it five
times, and if it's large enough to attract the eye, will get annoying
very quickly.
|
| Unlike news, where space is relatively cheap, so larger sigs are more
forgivable, and four lines or more is typically the norm, mailing lists
feed into a person's private mailbox. Thus, each subscriber is paying
for every byte you send them, so if too much of that is a .sig which
contains no useful information, but is just repeated over and over, many
people will quickly start to feel less favourably inclined towards your
contributions to the list.
|
|
| Should I ``crosspost'' to multiple lists?
|
| Almost always, the answer to this is no. Most mailing lists are
topically disjoint, and there is very little that is equally appropriate
for posting to a number of them. It can also be annoying, as usually
subscribers will get a copy of your message for each list they're on
that you post to -- more than two or three of those and you can have a
lot of annoyed people knocking on your mailbox.
|
| That said, there may be some occasional instances where it would be
appropriate to post to a number of lists at once. If you think this is
the case, then you should probably contact the owner of each list and
make sure that they agree before proceeding.
|
|
| Can I post binaries, or other large files to the list?
|
| Almost always, the answer to this is no. Mail sent to mailing lists is
going into subscribers' private mailboxes, some of which are not set up
to handle really large pieces of mail. Typically, you should put large
files up on an ftp or web site, and then post an announcement to the
list with instructions on how to access the files. If you do not have
access to ftp or web facilities, contact the owner of the list, and she
or he may be able to help you out.
|
| There may be a few cases where posting such material would be
appropriate, but you should definitely contact the list owner first and
make sure you have his or her approval before doing so.
|
|
| When replying, should I quote the previous message?
|
| Most certainly. You should always provide some context to your replies
so that people who may not have been following the thread closely, or
who have other things on their minds will easily be able to determine
what you're talking about.
|
| However, when quoting, be very careful to edit the quoted sections
down to the bare minimum of text needed to maintain the context for your
reply. There is very little on a mailing list that is more annoying than
paging through a few pages of quoted text only to read a few lines at
the end. Also be careful that you clearly indicate what text you're
quoting (as opposed to what you're writing), and if possible, cite the
author of the original text.
|
| If your mail program wants to attach the whole message you're replying
to on the end of your replies, please do not let it do this if you can
possibly avoid it. It is a good thing to include excerpts from previous
messages with your replies to maintain a logical flow of discussion, but
it is almost always a bad thing to include the entire text of a message
being replied to, be it at the start or end of your reply.
|
|
| Should I mail a copy to the person I'm replying to?
|
| That depends, but usually the answer is no. Unlike news, where
followups may take days to reach the original author, and may sometimes
never make it at all, mail service is typically faster and more
reliable. Also unlike news, private copies of postings to mailing lists
will result in multiple copies arriving in the recipient's mailbox,
rather than just one. Unless you have good reason to believe that the
person needs your answer as soon as possible, then they'll probably
thank you if you stick with just sending it to the list.
|
|
| I've been insulted! How should I respond?
|
| Ah, congratulations. You've never been properly welcomed to the net
until you've been flamed. Your response can take a number of forms. The
first and most important thing you should do is to take a break and cool
off. Replies written in the heat of anger are seldom any better than the
postings which inspire them. Revenge is a dish best served cold, as they
say.
|
| Now that you've cooled off, go back and consider the offending
material again. If it's nothing but baseless lies and fabrications that
no rational person would believe, then the best response is to
completely ignore it. If it contains material that you would consider to
be of a slanderous or threatening nature, then you may wish to forward a
copy to the user's postmaster and request that they have a word with the
individual about the proper use of the net.
|
| If, on the other hand, the posting contains inaccuracies which you
feel need to be addressed, then it is perfectly reasonable to send a
followup message which does so. However, the ideal approach is to ignore
any hysteria, and stick with the facts. Be reasonable and rational,
point out your attacker's errors, and their attack will usually collapse
around them. In particular, avoid any personal attacks on an
individual's intelligence, age, character, etc. At the very least, if
you cultivate a reputation of being level-headed, then most people will
gladly give you the benefit of the doubt over a knee-jerk flamer.
|
| The final option is to flame them in return, but be very careful when
deciding on this course of action. Well crafted flames are a thing of
beauty, but are extremely difficult to write. The ultimate goal of a
flame should be that the recipient know deep in his or her heart that
s/he has been terribly insulted, but s/he should not consciously be able
to figure out why s/he feels this way.
|
|
| My posting hasn't shown up on the list! What do I do?
|
| Probably, just be patient. Sometimes the list server will be off-line,
or be too busy with other things to deal with your mail right away.
Also, some lists are restricted to posts by subscribers only, and if the
address you post from does not match the one you're subscribed under,
your posting may be delayed for approval by the list owner. If the list
owner is away or busy, then it may be some time before your message gets
approved.
|
| If a few days go by with no sign of your post, then the next step
should be to write the list owner and inquire if there's a problem.
Include as much information as you can regarding what your original
posting was about. If still nothing has happened after a week, and if
your message is still relevant, then it's probably entirely reasonable
to post it again. Mail is generally more reliable than news, but things
still get lost occasionally.
|
|
| I've been subscribed to the bounces list! What does this mean?
|
| This means that your email account has, for at least a short period,
been refusing to accept messages from the mailing list. This may happen
because your mailbox has filled up (i.e. over quota), or it may be due
to system problems at your site, or even network problems beyond local
control. Every time a subscriber's mailbox starts bouncing mail, a copy
of each posting to the list is returned to the list owner. Even if only
a small percentage of addresses on a list are having problems at any one
time, for a large and/or busy list this can add up to quite a bit of mail.
|
| Some list owners will simply unsubscribe offending accounts from the
list, while others will have the option of moving bouncing accounts to a
separate list. Majordomo, in particular, supports a bounces list, to
which bouncing addresses can be moved, and which will provide a daily
reminder to addresses on the list that their status has changed.
Included in these reminders are instructions on how to get off of the
bounces list, and rejoin whatever list(s) you were originally on.
|
|
| I'm not getting any mail from the list! What's wrong!
|
| Well, most likely this simply means that no one is posting anything.
If you've got something to say, then post it and see if you can start up
the discussion again. Do not, however, send a ``test message'' to the
list, as it's unlikely that all the subscribers want to receive such
junk mail. It's perfectly reasonable for a list to be dormant for long
periods between bursts of traffic, as not all topics can be interesting
all the time.
|
| On the other hand, it is also possible that you are no longer
subscribed to the list, whether due to your mailbox bouncing for too
long, or due to some other system error. The easiest way to determine if
this is the case is simply to resubscribe to the list. If you're already
on the list, then the list server should return a message stating as
much; if not, then you're back on the list and the problem is solved.
|
| The final possibility is that the list has died, whether this is due
to the owner not paying his bills, just getting sick of the whole thing,
or some other reason, who knows. In this situation, the best course of
action is to attempt to contact the list owner and verify the problem.
If it turns out that the list has been shut down on a permanent basis,
then you may be able to obtain the old list of subscribers and restart
the list yourself. If a full subscriber list is not available, then
you'll have to contact everyone you knew from the list and decide where
to go from there.
|
|
| I've got a problem not answered here! What do I do?
|
| Your best resource is the list owner. If you do not actually know who
that is, for a list named wilma@mail.server.site, typically mail to
either owner-wilma@mail.server.site or wilma-owner@mail.server.site will
reach the list owner. If neither of these work, then contact
postmaster@mail.server.site and inquire how to reach the owner of the list.

Also - when you bcc a list, several mailing lists, like mailman, will
either reject the posting or forward it to the list admin for approval

If you do this often enough you'll end up with a pissed off list admin -
not a very good thing to end up with, I assure you

No, it doesn't. If you really have to post to multiple lists, then use
the resend-message option of your mail client (Esc-e in Mutt,
Actions->Resend in Outlook etc.).

You read all those that is copied and pasted ?. For me it will take an
hour to read that and will definitely ignore such a mail.

Why don't you post the code that exhibits the problem? The behaviour

You can not expect the signals to be automatically propagated to every
child. You must invoke kill() manually if you want that functionality
in this case.

In this context Period = full stop, an end, and the like. Used to
imply that s/he is stressing a point.

Seems to me that either the shell or sleep() is blocking SIGUSR1. It
doesn't seem to block SIGUSR2, though.

strace output:

rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD], [USR1], 8) = 0
rt_sigaction(SIGCHLD, NULL, {SIG_DFL}, 8) = 0
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [USR1], NULL, 8) = 0
nanosleep({1, 0}, {1, 0})               = 0

Suggestions:

Don't use system(). It is bad to use library calls from a signal handler anyway.
Don't use sleep(). Use select() to sleep.

Don't know, but there is already a guideline about subject - not to

You are reading the first edition! That explains the 2.2 series. I
suggest that you atleast get the second edition that explains things
based on 2.4. I read somewhere that the authors are planning to write
based on 2.6 in the next edition that will be out soon. But don't take
my word for it.

You might as well pick up Robert Love's "Linux Kernel Development". It
is easily avaiable in all leading bookshops here in Chennai. It is a
good book to get started with kernel programming.

A very good suggestion. 

Anyone game for it? You can also talk and explore the
different links in the wiki. If there are lots of
things to discuss, we can keep this as a separate demo
too.

Let me know.

Supposed? What do you mean by "customized linux
software"?

An image file is usually a disk image having a
filesystem. Ramdisk is an example.

What is it that you are actually trying to accomplish?
Give us the big picture.

in the context of gmail specifically, i think top posting sometimes
makes sense...firstly, one of the disadvantage quoted of scrolling
down text and coming back again is not really an issue due to the way
it organizes threads (This is the case with quite a few new mail
readers). Secondly, bottom posting hides the snippet shown along with
the mail titles. Otherwise, many a time one cud read the entire

                      ,
                              Diary of an open source developer workshop:
                              Independent journalist Frederick Noronha
                              blogged his way through the Asia Source open
                              source developer workshop in India earlier this
                              year. Now he has collected all his writings
                              over the entire workshop and released them as a
                              small book which offers a fascinating insight
                              into the state of open source software, not
                              only in Asia, but throughout the world.

                              the Western Cape have been selected to
                              participate in a two-year global study on free
                              and open source software.

                              Unix systems and their derivatives, including
                              Linux, these days have one major thing in
                              common. They all use the same system as the
                              back end for their graphical interfaces.  This
                              system is called the X window system, or more
                              commonly X.

                              of free/open source and proprietary software in
                              public computer centres in Africa. It found
                              that where free software was well-implemented
                              there were many advantages but FOSS still faces
                              many challenges to widespread adoption. It also
                              found that many of the preceived advantages of
                              free software - such as cost - were not
                              realised in Africa.

Hello

In windows the Window key in the keyboard is mapped to the start menu
button. Is it possible to similarly map the window key to the
Applications menu of Gnome?

You can try : "ps -ax "  or what ever the syntax is based on your system 
(assuming you meant when I try to connect using linux). Next time please 
be more clear on what distribution you are using etc.

The Link was very useful thank you. But as also in the thread, I was
not able to map my left window key... my keyboard is a M$ basic
keyboard which has only one window key which is on the left side of
the keyboard. So i was not able to map the key... Do you know wat the
reason could be that the left window key is not being mapped?

Message-ID: <20050604044354.35004.qmail@web51806.mail.yahoo.com>

hi all,
 I have recently posted my mail regarding 'Server freezing'. Some of you
sugessted to stop unwanted services & etc.
 All the services have been stopped except squid (proxy). Squid is the only service running in our  server(Redhat 9 on IBM Xeon ) now. After continuous run over a weak, the machine becomes frozen. It needs a reboot. 

 Is there any other critical reason for this freezing?

I was told that the machine you are referring to, is actually a
redhat7.3. An upgrade on the machine should remove the problem.
Probably the old guy (7.3) doesn't know how to handle certain events
on a dual processor machine.

It is probably the PID on Hathway's RAS box. If it is the same PID
that's thrown out every time, you ought to call up their customer care
or tech helpdesk and ask them to kill that PID.

Linux is the kernel and it has its own address space.
The image file, ramdisk, for example, is present in
its own memory location. Don't mix the two.

Message-ID: <9a9bfc1705060408037579d6e8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I recently got an Acer Aspire 3002NLC. The pack seemed to indicate a
shipped Linux distro...seriously looked more of a conspiracy to
disgrace Linux....an init 3 setup with hardly any utils...many of the
basic cli utils were missing, leave alone X or any other gui
program...that apart...installing Debian Sarge by netinst was a
breeze...coming to the problem...the battery charge left doesn't show
up using acpi...

a chvt to any of the virtual console or a peek into the syslog
confirmed the problem...a continuous stream of message every few
seconds:

     ACPI-0352: *** Error: Looking up [Z007] in namespace, AE_NOT_FOUND
search_node c13f3e80 start_node c13f3e80 return_node 00000000
     ACPI-1138: *** Error: Method execution failed [\_SB_.BAT1._BST]
(Node c13f3d80), AE_NOT_FOUND.

http://www.cpqlinux.com/acpi-howto.html#basic_steps gave some insight,
though it was for a 2.4 kernel. So, installed iasl, disassembled the
ACPI dsdt and tried to recompile. The compilation threw quite a few
errors. I don't know the syntax / semantics of the iasl language and
the few common fixes mentioned in the document didn't help either. If
anyone knows about this, I would be happy to provide the dsdt and the
compilation log.

I am currently using linux-2.6.12-rc4-ck1 with the inotify patch.
external modules inserted - fuse, cdfs (I don't think the unstable
nature of the kernel is a problem - the problem existed in the stock
sarge kernel as well)

it moves on...

Message-ID: <20050604185220.65353.qmail@web50005.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,
I have an ethernet internet connection. I wish to
share this with a laptop. I have 2 NICs on the server
and have connected to the laptop through a crossover
cable connection. The specs are:

host
internet
eth0: 192.168.11.x
gateway : 192.168.11.1

eth1
192.168.0.1
gateway: none

Laptop
eth0: 192.168.0.2
gateway: 192.168.0.1

Both comps have WinXP/FC3 dual boot.
This setting works fine when the server is in windows
and the laptop in linux/windows

However when the server is in linux, two-way ping is
possible. Samba, NFS file sharing also works. Internet
access however is not possible from the laptop. The
problem seems to be with iptables. IP Masquerading
doesnot seem to work though i added the rules
ip_forward = 1
and enabled POSTROUTING.
I tried using firestarter, however that too doesn't
work. Does it have anything to do with recompiling the
kernel? Also i cannot run iptables other than as root.
Does that have something to do with this?
Please do help.

Free CDs spread open source in India
Published: May 25, 2005, 9:17 AM PDT

By Ingrid Marson
Special to CNET News.com

The Indian government is trying to encourage the use of computers across the 
country by distributing free CDs that contain localized versions of popular 
open-source applications.

The government has started distributing CDs containing Tamil-language versions 
of various open-source applications, including the Firefox browser, the 
OpenOffice.org productivity suite and the Columba e-mail client. It plans to 
freely distribute 3.5 million copies of the CD to Tamil speakers worldwide, 
according to R.K.V.S. Raman, a researcher at the Centre for Development of 
Advanced Computing, a Bangalore-based organization involved in the production 
of the CD.
Open Source Software
In India, seeking avenues for growth
There's no standing still in a competitive global market--just check out the 
tech action in Bangalore.

Raman told ZDNet UK on Wednesday that the CDs have been in considerable demand 
following a newspaper-and-television advertising campaign last month.

"We have had a tremendous response to this (initiative)," he said. "In the 
first two weeks of the campaign we got about 100,000 hits daily on the Web site 
offering CDs, and about 2,000 to 3,000 downloads (of Tamil-language 
applications). We have already sent out around 50,000 CDs and have a backlog of 
35,000."

Once the requested CDs have been sent out, more copies will be distributed with 
computer magazines and newspapers, according to Raman.

Even the president of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, has taken an interest in the 
project and earlier this month met the team involved in the production of the 
CD.

The next stage of the project is to distribute CDs containing applications in 
Hindi, the national language of India. This stage will be launched on June 21 
and likely will involve more than the 3.5 million CDs earmarked for the current 
phase, said Raman. Eventually, the government plans to release CDs in all of 
the 22 official languages of India.

Raman believes open-source software has two main advantages for the Indian 
population--it is relatively inexpensive and it can be modified fairly easily. 
"We are sometimes not comfortable with Western user interfaces--they don't make 
sense in our culture, particularly for rural people who haven't had much access 
to technology. If we want to modify the software we have to have access to the 
code," he said.

The Indian government's decision to ship free software in this way likely will 
be a blow to Microsoft, which plans to release a low-cost version of Windows in 
India soon. Microsoft originally hoped to release its Windows XP Starter 
Edition--a low-cost, feature-restricted version of Windows XP--by the end of 
March, but it's now aiming for a June release.
Ingrid Marson of ZDNet UK reported from London.

Hi!
I want to know how this, X screen resolution can be
set in Ubuntu. Ive got only 640x480 when I must have
1024x768.

[BTW  I think Ubuntu is *NOT* for developers, Its
really a sad version of Debian].

Thanks in advance for all help.

Check if you are using XFree86 or Xorg from the output
of:

X -version

Your XF86Config or XOrgConfig file is present under
/etc/X11/. You can add your resolution there, provided
your video driver supports it. You can also
reconfigure your X using xf86config/xf86cfg or
xorgconfig/xorgcfg from the terminal console.

i use gkrellm as well...i seem to have temporarily solved the
problem...there is a fixed dsdt in
http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/view.php?id=377. that seems to be for
Acer Aspire 3000, but I guess the changes aren't much. that reduced
the number of errors from 37 to 6. the interesting part however was
that it still produced an output file. including this using
CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT seems to work - i get the battery charge
right, and my syslog isn't flooded either. however, i am unsure of
what problems the six errors might cause. i have posted to acpi-devel,
and am awaiting a response. if anybody wants the fixed dsdt, please
mail me.

it moves on...

Is anyone interested in giving a session on

Ma Foi Academy, or any other topic? Well, there are
tutorials online, but, it is much easier to learn when
someone can teach you. Else, we can review some

Gosh., most of the people here (and any serious mailing list) use
some decent mail-client like GNUS, mutt, Evolution, Kmail,

There is a song `god wrote in lisp code`. Google it up. I think it
should be in the `fun` section of www.gnu.org.

In case u want to pay, I found a Debian CDs pack(not sure if its
latest) in Sai Bookstore, Indiranagar. Gangarams may also have it.

But (based on the cost), it wud be more economical i guess to run to
chennai and get the CDs from someone in Cds_For_Grab...or Find a way

Message-ID: <7e6ceab30506052146451f7364@mail.gmail.com>

Greets!

I hope someone can give me a few pointers on this.. 

I had 2 80GB SATA disks in a RAID0 (striping) config. /dev/md0
consisted of sda1 and sdb1.
It was working fine with reiserfs (3.6) as my gentoo (2004.3) root partition.

I wanted to switch to the gentoo 2005.0 profile and it was giving me
hell for over 3-4 days. So, I thought why not do a fresh install... :)

And from the gentoo live CD, I had to use mdadm to get /dev/md0
working. But instead of using

mdadm --assemble

I used mdadm --create. It did give me a warning that the two
partitions were already part of a RAID array, but I ignored it (brain
dead.. I know :)

Took some 5 minutes to realize what I'd done.. switched off system..
booted with knoppix.. used mdadm to assemble /dev/md0 and ran
fsck.reiserfs. It reported quite a few problems and moved a lot of
files to /lost+found. It did fix all problems though.

After this, if I try to mount the partition (from knoppix or gentoo
live CD), it generates
 a kernel panic and the whole box freezes. fsck.reiserfs still says
that there are no problems.

message:
-------
ReiserFS: Detected ReiserFS(3.6) ... ... ...
<PANIC>
-------

I tried to extract data from /dev/md0 using rfstool which can extract
files from a reiserfs partition. But it doesn't work. Tells me
something about "bad magic" and that it isn't a reiserfs partition.

What do I do now? I need the data badly..  Any pointers would be appreciated. 

Thanks
Deepak

I have  a dated  CD set of  Sarge (I  think October'2004). Mail  me in
private if you want the CDs.

(FYI: Sarge has changed a lot since the time I got my CD set, so maybe
its not  of any use to  have my CD set  unless you don't  want to stay
bleeding edge on Sarge.  This also means you will end up downloading a
whole lot  of packages if you think  of using the live  stuff from the
mirrors).

(FYI2: If you  can wait for a  few days, I can download  all the stuff
and if  you provided me with  the media I can  burn it and  give it to
you).

There was widespread talk of releasing it on June 6.
and the release date given was _Official_ .

Search Slashdot, they carried the news first.

Use MailScanner a sendmail addon it can use ClamAV for virus
protection and can block files by extension and/or by file types.

Subject: [Ilugc] Regarding Schemes for the GAME "FLAME"
Message-ID: <ed2d3c000506060042518cccca@mail.gmail.com>

Dear   Mr. Anand babu,

Thanks for the time you shared with us at mafoi academy, chennai on
5th of june 2005.
I have a fair knowledge on 'c' language. When i started learning 'c',
as you said 'Tower of Hanoi', where recursion is used, I was not
comfortable with 'c'. While learning in C i had attempted in writing
shaby code for the game Called "FLAME".
For some time now i am opting a selective amenetia to  forget what i
know in 'c'.


Given that two names
A is a String which holds the value "THYAGARAJAN"
B is a string which holds the value "MANOKARAN"

cancelling the characters common in both the strings and counting the
characters then which are left out

 A'=   THY G  JA
 B'=   M NOK  

total characters in both the string is 10

Then taking a string "FLAME" which is a abbrevation of (F)RIEND (L)OVE
(A)FFECTION (M)ARRIAGE (E)NEMETITY and counting the 10th character in
the circular list format
That is, FLAME scoring the 10th in circular list  becomes FLAMEFLAM(E)
 is removed,
Step 1.
FLAME  becomes FLAM.
Step 2
Counting 10 characters in Circular list in the string  FLAM  will
leave me with 'F AM'
Step 3
Counting 10 characters in circular list in the string "F AM" will
leave me with  "AMFAMFAMF(A)" is out and the result is  F M
Step 4
Counting 10 characters in circular list  in the string "MFMFMFMFMF"
will leave me with "M" in the word FLAME and "M" stands for Marriage
(I AM ENDED WITH A WRONG EXAMPLE LOGICALLY ;)..

I want to write a scheme implementation in guile and the same i want
it to give extension in  emac.
Can you guide me the link for the syntaxially ref which will enable to
do this job in guile.

Thanks in advance.

Blindly disabling SELinux or any security system is a bad idea. If you 
have a problem with the configuration, read about it

http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/selinux-faq-fc3/
http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/selinux-apache-fc3/

If you have questions about it after reading the documentation and 
verifying that you have the latest updates, ask in the fedora-selinux list

Yes I know that but this could be the right solution for a novice

Novice users should understand and learn the technology rather than 
disabling security measures. This is like logging in as root to prevent 
the password dialog boxes. If its  debugging process, then read the FAQ 
and relevant documentation to understand best on how to do it.

Specifically, you can use the command, #setenforce 0 to confirm whether 
this is related to SELinux at all . You can also set it in permissive 
mode. If you really need to disable it, then you can do that per deamon 
using system-config-securitylevel tool,  Applications => System Settings 
=> Security level or in /etc/selinux/targeted/booleans.

Again, dont blindly turn it off altogether.

Rahul

Hello friends...
  i am working with a PHP application 
where i want the following scenario to happen
 initially i have a page
  http:\\servername\index.php
and in the page i do some condition validation..using 
 if ... (true)
 statement1
 else
 statement2
 what i want is ......in statement1 or statement2 i want to redirect to 
another page say test.php
without affecting the the url ..
i.e, at any cost i want the url to remain as same
 http:\\servername\index.php 
 but at the same time i want the contents of the test.php to be displayed in 
the same url (http:\\servername\index.php)
  the conditions are evaluated when i click a button on the index.php( i.e., 
when the page is submitted..)
 hope i am clear the problem...!

You can use frames in the index.php file. 
for ex: Your index.php looks like

<html>
<frameset rows="*" cols="*" framespacing="0" frameborder="NO" border="0">
<?php
if ($_GET['ip']==1)
{
?>
                <frame src="test1.php" name="topFrame" scrolling="NO" 
noresize>
<?php
}
else
{
?>
                <frame src="test2.php" name="topFrame" scrolling="NO" 
noresize>
<?php
}
?>
</frameset>
</html>

Hope this gives you the solution

   You can do one thing, if PHP has page include facility like JSP has, you
   can use that technique to solve the problem. Search for page inculde
   facility in google.

And be careful to whom you're recommending solutions

The guy's programming for a bank. So, quite likely, he's facing a problem
with code he's writing at work, rather than trying to learn cgi

I would not recommend that any code that has the least chance of going into
production at a bank should have low security defaults. Banks have enough
crackers, phishers etc targeting them without their making it easy for
intruders to get into their systems

This doesnt look like a selinux issue at all, could be more like "your user
has permissions for the db, but the user the webserver runs as - say nobody
- doesnt have permissions granted for the db .. so the script runs just
fine on the shell but not when called from mod_perl"

Scheme (the language implemented by guile) is different from elisp
(Emacs Lisp). elisp is slightly different from Lisp. You can find
tonnes of tutorial on the Internet for programming in Scheme.

If you write your game in Scheme, invoking guile bindings in your
C program., I dont think that Scheme program will run as such on
GNU Emacs. Scheme is more generalized., whereas elisp is specific
to Emacs.

Are willing to contribute for ODOC?? If yes, then see the list from
our ODOC LJ Site and select any command which is not covered.

Write a ODOC note in our std format (strictly) and mail to me with
proper subject line.

One Day One Command
===================

tar -- Create/Add/Extract Tape ARchives files.

Summary:

tar is an archiving program designed to store and extract files from
an archive file known as a tar file.  A tar file may be made on a tape
drive, however, it is also common to write a tar file to a normal file.

Normally ".tar" file is not a compressed files, it is actually a
collection of files within a single file. ".tar.gz"/ ".tgz" is a
collection of files in compressed mode.

Example:

$ tar -cf myfile.tar mydir -- Create new tar file.

$ tar -cvf myfile.tar mydir -- With detail output.

$ tar -tvf myfile.tar -- List the content of the tar file.

$ tar -uvf myfile.tar mydir -- Update/Append files that are newer 
                               than copy in tar.

$ tar -xvf myfile.tar -- Extract the tar file.

$ tar -xvf myfile.tar dir1/file1 -- Extract only file1 from the tar.

$ tar --delete -vf myfile.tar *.doc -- Delete all files with .doc extn
                                       from tar file.

$ tar --diff -vf myfile.tar mydir -- Differences between archive & mydir

$ tar -czvf myfile.tgz mydir -- Tar and GZip the files.

$ tar -xzvf myfile.tgz -- Extract the tgz file.

$ tar -cZvf myfile.tgz mydir -- Tar and compress the files.

$ tar -xZvf myfile.tgz -- Extract the tgz file.

Hi All,

Am not sure if this has already been discussed;
Either way i request you to reconsider.

Is it possible to add a message trailer to any/all post done to this list?

I have seen so many posts requesting for CDs and someone sending out a
standard reply asking to look into the CDs_for_Grab link.

This way, at least it will be clear if a sender is aware of the list
proceedings.

Thanks

I think this is a good idea and it is seen in some other lists as well. 
The list admin can consider this.

Shakthi, thanks for uploading the photos so quickly.  One minor
correction: In photo No:30 of the album,Dhusasana and Duriyodhana are
seen (not Krishna).  The Special Kathakali performance was part of
Duryodhana Vadham upto the end of Dhusasana. I should thank Dr. Sasi
Kumar who explained in detail about the various costumes used in a
Kathakali performance.  The good characters are painted in green, and
the villains are usually painted red along with other fearsome face
props but also have funny noses.  Draupadi was also played by a male
artist.  A kathakali artist trains himself for as many as 15 years
before playing serious roles, and their perfection in performing their
role should be seen to be believed.  More information about kathakali
is available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathakali

It sounds very ironic to me that you want to discuss the relative
potency of various ways of shutting down a Linux server.

Hi,
I have a Athlon XP 2 Ghz machine with 256 MB Ram and
64 MB Nvidia card. 2 40 GB Hard disks on it.
Asus A7NVM266 Motherboard.

XP Professional keeps reporting 100 %  CPU usage.
Just got a few trojans and viruses. Mebbe thats the
reason I dont know.

Does Linux have any tools for monitoring Motherboard
and CPU Temperature? I Have Xandros and Redhat

Processor is running at 50 Degrees and Motherboard
around 38 Degrees.

Thanks in Advance,
Regards,
Sanjay

lm_sensors (http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/) should
help. Try searching 'lm_sensors' in rpmfind.net for
a redhat-specific package.

You can also monitor processor temperature alone by
using ACPI extensions as follows:

    modprobe processor
    modprobe thermal
    cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature

Huh ?! Full install of Debian Sarge ?
40 GB approximately, if you have the time to kill
and patience installing each and every package from
the 11 to 14 CD-ROMs, and thats close to 12,000
different software packages - not a recommended
way of setting up a Debian box.

Hardly interesting. Same old Microsoft tactics. The only thing I found
even remotely interesting is the new addition to my vocabulary,
"componentizing".

Wake me up when Microsoft is able provision a webserver in 6 minutes
(RHEL3.0 U5) as opposed to the current 3-4 hours (Windows 2000 SP4).
Yawn.

and whoever  does that can probably  claim record, for  being the most
patient man :)  Not only because the setting up  is difficult, you can
virtually forget doing apt-get upgrade. (maybe not with something that
is 'frozen'  but you can  certainly forget upgrading  a full-installed
'sid' or 'testing').

FYI,

-- mks --

http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/3.1_r0/

Note: 3.1r0 CD image problem
A bug has been discovered in the 3.1r0 CD/DVD images: new installs
from these images will have a commented-out entry in
/etc/apt/sources.list for "http://security.debian.org/
testing/updates" rather than an active entry for
"http://security.debian.org/ stable/updates", and thus will not get
security updates by default. This was due to incorrect Release files
on the images.

If you have already installed a system using a 3.1r0 CD/DVD image, you
do not need to reinstall. Instead, simply edit /etc/apt/sources.list,
look for any lines mentioning security.debian.org, change "testing" to
"stable", and remove "# " from the start of the line.

If you installed other than from a CD or DVD (for example, netboot, or
booting from floppy and installing the base system from the network),
you are not affected by this bug.

New 3.1r0a images will be available shortly to correct this flaw. We
apologise for the inconvenience.

Debian developers were slogging hard over the weekend to get it released 
by 6 Jun. I think that would have caused this minor but critical 
mistake. I have already downloaded the images from mirrors.kernel.org 
and I should consider downloading the first CD again after they fix 
this. On a deployment scenario, I can't expect all sysadms to know about 
this. They would assume the default behavior of debian that security uri 
is always uncommented when they want it to be included during base-config.

A few months back, on my way to my ancestral village, in a village
called Nathakadaiyur (about 15 kms from Kangayam in Erode dist) I came
across a poster advertising PERL and Python programming courses.

And in a hospital in Coimbatore, I saw a hospital management system
developed in Python by a company in Erode!

Perhaps our brethern in tier 2 (and 3 and 4) towns are way ahead of us
in leveraging the benefits of open source.

I have gone thro' several postings from members about the courses that
are available in Erode and other districts, I think LUGC should
conduct the training sessions to effectively draw others also into
this wonderful world.

Is LUGC is planning for a training on LAMP? So, we can follow our
people who are staying in Tier 2/3/4 cities.

Where did you get this "Tier 2/3/4 cities" from? On
what basis do you classify the cities like these? 

Standard of education within a universitiy
campus/training facility has nothing to do with the
facilities provided by the government in a city. Just
because a city may not have all the infrastructure it
needs, it doesn't mean that everyone inside it are not
sophisticated. It would be a wrong assumption. 
 
There are good universities in small cities/towns too.

I think it is from the Home Ministry of India - and the basis of
classification is population data obtained from the census.

Hmm... I'm not sure I agree. In India at least, while specialized
campuses (Roorkee, Kharagpur) with lots of funding can be found
occassionally in Tier 3/4 cities, an arts/science college of the level
of a St. Stephens or Presidency or whatever is very rare.

For the number of students who work on GNU/Linux at
MIT, you definitely should be having a GNU/Linux group
oncampus, and have talks/workshops/seminars/dicussions
every week.

I have quite up-to-date versions of Sarge, totalling two DVDs. 
Unfortunately I dont have a DVD Writer,  but you can copy them off my
hard disk if you could drop by.

I will shortly be updating them (using jigdo) to the latest stable
release (remember, sarge is now 'stable').

I am also having other distros like Mandrake, FC3, FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
Knoppix, PenguinSleuth etc.

I stay in Domlur, Airport Road.

I believe that a good institution is one which teaches you to think
and solve problems yourself.  Not one which solves the problem for you
and exhorts you to imitate. Usually in a big city one gets to meet
varied people and ones world view expands. This helps in overall
intellectual development. Though institutions in smaller towns are at
a disadvantage, where the institution itself takes the lead in
bringing people from many walks of life to interact and encourage
diversity it will turn out more well rounded graduates.

As for Linux to grow, I do not think it depends on the presence of
good institutions. All it needs is the presence of people with a
passion to solve problems themselves.

Forgive me if this way OT :-)

A majority of universities in the US, even the big
ones like Princeton, are based in a small city.
Actually, the city develops around the university.
They usually refer to the part of the city as the
"University Town". I believe it is the same with
universities in Europe too.

1. You could recompile your kernel after enabling
ACPI support in its configuration.

2. Download and install the lm_sensors package.

One Day One Command
===================

zip -- Package and Compress files in Zip format.

Summary:

zip is a compression and file packaging utility. The zip program puts
one or more compressed files into a single zip archive, along with
information about the files.

Example:

$ zip stuff * -- Create stuff.zip, add current Dir files in it.

$ zip -r myzip mydir -- Create myzip.zip, add mydir files in it.

$ zip -j myzip mydir/* -- Same as above. But mydir name will not be 
                      recorded.

$ zip -rm myzip mydir -- Delete the original files after zipping.

$ zip -r myzip mdir -x \*~ -- Exclude all files that end in ~.

$ zip -u stuff *  -- If myzip.zip is already exist then, update new 
                     and modified files from the current Dir.

$ zip -R foo '*.c' -- Travel the Dirs recursively starting at the
                     current directory and zip all C files.

$ zip -n .Z:.zip:.tiff:.gif:.snd myzip * -- Create myzip.zip file, add 
    files from current Dir and Don't try compress the specified files.

$ zip -rt 2005-06-06 myzip mydir -- Zip all the files in foo and its
              subdirs that were last modified on or AFTER 06-06-2005.

$ zip -rtt 2005-06-06 myzip mydir -- Zip all the files in foo and its
              subdirs that were last modified BEFORE 06-06-2005.

Read: man zip  (Lot of examples are available)

>From what I have heard, almost everyone has only positive things to
say about BSNL dataone.  In fact, I personally know of only one person
who had trouble.  That too was because he screwed up big time while
filling up the forms and stuff. Remember this - BSNL is an
organization with the soul of a govt. dept.  So you confuse them with
paper work (and oh, filling up the form in red ink has unintended
effects on the BSNL staff), and you are are asking for trouble.  Pay
extra attention to the procedures and stuff, and you will be
pleasantly surprised by the quality of your connection.

The service itself is quite good, in as much as I have not experienced
much down time.  At times I get more than 350 kbps on my 256 kbps rate
line.  But then I fully expect to run into trouble if ever I require
manual assistance from BSNL staff, but so far I have been spared.

And yes, the bsnl modems are linux friendly.  It's a big plus.

Count me for another. Though I don't complain about the speed, the
connectivity has become highly unpredictable.

These are 2 different services!

BSNL dataone = the government owned phone company's broadband service

Tata Indicom / VSNL broadband is what used to be called Dishnet till
recently, but VSNL took over Dishnet's DSL and dialup service sometime
last year (the dishnet service quality improved after this I must say)

I have been using tata indicom / dishnet for the last 3 years and its
quite reliable .. except when it goes phut, which happens once in
several weeks and sometimes takes anywhere between one hour to over a
day to fix depending on what got screwed up

I used to work for a small company in Madurai called Winways Systems.
while I was there, I worked on many Python/GTK+ based application
programs! Several business that make from a few lacks to few crores
are running those applications successfully.

I even remember designing a reporting system based on gnome-print that
was quite successful. Based on LTSP these applications run comfortable
on 486 clients!!

Hi all,

We all know that linux is been quite popular in web server, mail server 
and other network and server related areas. The discussions in ILUGC 
were predominantly regarding that. For the past 1 week we have few 
people discussing commercial software development in linux and that too 
from small cities.

I would like to know more about people and projects involved with 
commercial software development in linux. How about creating a wiki page 
in ILUGC site or some sort input mechanism where we can get some 
information about these projects and people. If the ILUGC site already 
had one please ignore this mail.

The page can have these information,

* Project name
* Brief project description
* List of Open/Free Software tools used
* Any other commercial software involved (optional)
* Project cost (in thousand/in lakhs/in crores. Exact figure not 
required) (optional)
* Optional - Contact information
* Issues faced regarding open/free software
* Areas in project where open/free software involved.
* Reason why they opted for open/free software, instead of a commercial 
alternative. It can be price, software support, client willingness, 
learning curve, etc.,
* Primary source of software development support 
(forums/usergroup/commercial)
* Comments

The information will help in certain aspects.

* Getting a clear demographic detail, how far the Linux has reached, how 
much reached.
* This will clear the doubting thomases , that whether commercial 
software development in linux will hold any future.
* Does the people involved in this project using any commercial support 
or fully depependent on free support forums/user groups.

Hope some of the like minded people agree with me. Would like to hear 
your views.

Regards
Guru prasath

I have been experiencing a lot of problems with the Home 1000 BSNL 
Broadband plan since two weeks ago.

My configuration:
OS: FC3, user space patched, stock kernel.
Modem: UTStar
Host obtains IP address from modem through DHCP

I was initially using RP-PPPoE with no problem.  Two weeks ago, RP-PPPoE 
was no longer able to establish a connection with BSNL.

Soon after, an engineer from BSNL showed up and configured the modem to 
be the PPPoE endpoint.  RP-PPPoE was disabled.  Despite some opinions to 
the contrary in this group, the engineer confirmed that BSNL supports 
this configuration.  He also confirmed that nothing had changed at the 
BSNL end.

The connection has never been good.  I have almost never been able to 
connect to Google or Gmail after that.  Most other websites don't work 
either.  There are timeouts waiting for the connection to the server.

FTP seems to work.  ping works as does Yahoo Messenger.  DNS resolution 
is ok.  POP doesn't work.

To troubleshoot this problem, we replaced the Linux desktop with a 
Windows laptop.  Internet Explorer was able to connect to various 
websites.  Speed was bad and the BSNL engineer is trying to investigate 
why.  I can't explain why Windows works but Linux doesn't.  Both use 
DHCP to obtain an IP address from the modem.

I'm not sure what the problem is.  We've tried with the iptables 
firewall disabled -- no difference.  We've setup NAT on the modem to 
forward everything to the host -- no difference.  BSNL does not know the 
cause of the problem.

The modem reports its connection status (LAN side and modem side) as 
good.  netstat shows that the default route is to the modem.

I am planning to use Ethereal to see what is actually happening on the 
Ethernet.

Is there a way to snoop on what is happening at the phone line end of 
the modem?

BSNL's incoming mail server seems to have some sort of overzealous virus 
checking turned on.  Most emails from Gmail are bounced saying that 
there is a virus in it.  From the bounce message, it appears that 
Sancharnet.in is uncomfortable with the character encoding used by 
Gmail.  BSNL's helpline does not know what is going on and 
postmaster@sancharnet.in didn't bother to respond.

I was very satisfied with BSNL for the first two weeks.  It has been a 
disaster since.

Subject: [Ilugc] Debian release numbering ?
Message-ID: <20050610110810.73277.qmail@web51905.mail.yahoo.com>


I just want to know why the version number of Debian
Sarge is 3.1 ?

Woody was released way back in 19 July 2002. Even
after doing a hell of changes from then, Sarge has
been released as 3.1 [ Sarge 3.1 = Woody 3.0 + 0.1
!!!??? ]. Almost all the major components has been
updated in Sarge.

Why they are changing just the minor number, even for
a major release ?

This is not the case, just for this release. 
Have a look at all the stable releases
# Debian GNU/Linux 1.1 ('buzz')
# Debian GNU/Linux 1.2 ('rex')
# Debian GNU/Linux 1.3 ('bo')
# Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 ('hamm') [ A Steep Jump from
1.3 ?]
# Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 ('slink')
# Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 ('potato')
# Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 ('woody') [ A Steep Jump from
2.2 ?]
# Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 ('sarge')

 What makes them to follow such an irregular release
numbering convention ?

An interesting fact looking at their switch to major numbering is

1.3 -> 2.0
2.2 -> 3.0

So, the next in logical sequence is

3.1 -> 4.0

Maybe the next release would be 4.0 ;-)

> Host obtains IP address from modem through DHCP

I'm using Slackware 10.1, with the same modem and I've had lots of
problems too. I have a nforce2 mobo and am using the inbuilt ethernet
card. The modem would just refuse to connect - no specific error was
ever recieved. I faced the same problems with Windows XP on the same
machine. After lots of head wracking, I did manage to get it to
connect, but that only worked once, and I dont know how, and I couldnt
get it to connect half hour later. I even tried the other modem -
Huwaei ? I never got it to work.

I then tried it on my other computer, which has a 815 mobo with a
realtek ethernet card - and there the connection was made perfectly
and with no problem. I am currently using the connection on that
computer - and it works pretty well mostly, though there are frequent
downtimes on bsnl's side - but the speeds make up for that!!

So, I think it was some incompatibility problem with the nforce2
onboard ethernet, though I am not completely sure.

Shiva,

Thank you for your response.  That may be the problem in my case as 
well.  I have an nForce2 chipset mobo and am using the inbuilt ethernet.

I'll try with a NIC.

FWIW - I too have a nforce2 chipset mobo (ECS-N2U4000a or some such). 
And I have no problems with on board ethernet.  In fact that is the
only NIC in the system :-)  Oh well.. :)

I faced the same problem when I was connecting to Sify (NO)broadband 
nForce 2 chipset. When I changed the speed setting of the NIC from 
"Autonegotiate" to "10 Base T- HD" it worked. That was because of the 
switch that was used. Thought it might be helpful; still not sure of the 
relevance to this thread.

PS: You can use "mii-tool" on Linux to do this.

There is so much tech support available, free and

Thanks to all you guys,
esp the WIKI on BSNL data was good.

I got Roaring Penguin [RP-ppoe] and it works 
like breeze on FC3. Ubuntu is maybe tailor un-made
for newbie-devs likme..

Cheers

mount code triggered because of my corrupt bitmaps/superblock. They
sent me a patch that fixed it. :)

Insufficient Information.

Which brand? Which model?  Provide sufficient
information while asking a question. Read this:

http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

Google for your monitor specification.

Greetings!

This is the announcement of ?cds for grabs? project at
http://savannah.gnu.org. 

https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cds4grabs

This is a documentation project in LaTeX. Separate
documents are released for each country. Each country
database will have a list of different states, within
each state there will be a list of cities, and the
cities will contain records on different
areas/counties providing the following details:

- Person's name
- Contact: e-mail or phone number or both
- Set of CDs available and number of CDs in each set

Because the project is implemented in LaTeX, the
end-user can convert .tex to any file format such as
.ps, .html or .pdf.

In the current economic scenario, the communication
system w.r.t. telephone, mobile services, courier
services is very good in a lot of countries. But,
there are also people who still use dial-up. They may
not have the time or resources to download huge ISOs.
But, there may be others who might already have the
GNU/Linux CDs.

There are GLUGs where people exchange CDs through
online websites and mailing lists. But, not every
city/town/village has a GLUG. So, this project aims at
providing the contact info of people who are _willing_
to share/lend/copy/exchange GNU/Linux CDs by utilizing
the backbone communication services (telephones,
mobile services, courier services) of their country.

Thanks to Sylvain Beucler for approving the project at
http://savannah.gnu.org.

https://savannah.gnu.org/task/?func=detailitem&item_id=4163

This project is an extension of:
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/CDs_for_Grab

In future, it can be extended to an online database.

I would appreciate your feedback regarding the above. 

Also, if you are interested in becoming a maintainer
for your state/county/city, do get in touch with
me. Please don?t reply to the mailing list.

Sample code implementation for this project can be
downloaded from:

A discussion in a list like this gets stored for others to search and
read. Not possible in chat. As Voltaire says, "verba volant... scripta
manent' (spoken words evaporate but written words are permanent). That
is if it is ok to apply the analogy of 'spoken' words to chat!

There are irc bots available which will record every word exchanged on
IRC.This transcript is then made available live on the web.Lots of
community based portals have such "live irclogs".

In chat a lot of mundane and trivial msgs will be exchanged. A chat
archive containing all these will be more difficult to sift and seive.
On the contrary, mails are distilled pieces of information (at least
they are compared to chat :-) )

Good one. I got myself a Wipro Little Genius15CP last year.

Yes. Mine was bundled with MS-Windows XP as well. I was able to
replace MS-Windows XP with MS-DOS 6.22 before purchase and paid Rs.
500/- for the MS-DOS program (ok, operating system).

http://www.linux-laptop.net

And by the way, my laptop is good. I was able to install linux 2.4.27,
2.6.4, 2.6.7, 2.6.10, 2.6.11 and get to use the hardware present in
it. I have not tested the ieee1394 port yet because I do not have a
device yet.

hi mano,
Generally theseday every model shipped with XP is also avilable with
Linux with some 3000 Rs leverage...
I got my laptop also like that , it was actually shipped with XP Prof,
but he told me that the same model is also shipped with Mandake,
so ask ur retailer if such model is avilable. it Comes from the company
it self, with a blank HDD and mandrake CDs.
My friend also bought a accer laptop with mandrake OS..
So just checkout

hi
I have installed Mandrake linux recently. In that i
tried mounting ntfs partition. I succeeded in doing
so. But this mounting stays only upto my login
session. I need to mount every time i login into the
session.Moreover i am able to access ntfs partition
files only through root and not with any other user
accounts. How to tweak to make the mounting permanent
and give access to users.

Hi All

I have a triple boot box with win98, deb(sarge) and MDK10.
I  thought of updating the deb portion using apt-get.
The present kernel is 2.6.8-1. I used apt-get update and it downloaded 330MB
and updated all other applications , but when I give "uname -a" , I still
find the kernel as 2.6.8-1.

Will apt-get update not update the kernel also automagically? Or do I have
to do it in the old fashioned way by compiling and installing?

Pl help.

It looks like it is derived from Xulwebmail,
http://xulwebmail.mozdev.org. Anyway it doesn't work with IE, and Sify
doesn't seem to have taken the trouble to detect IE users and redirect
them appropriately (a link to getfirefox.com :)

It is distrowatch.com <http://distrowatch.com> anyway url will be redirected 
to even if you type distrowatch.org <http://distrowatch.org>
 You montior details will be in the file as mentioned by others.
 But you can see what all the things are getting written by manually running 
Xconfigurator, immediately it will ask the name of the file into which it 
should write. Her by default the name will be given and here you select what 
i the name you want. And see with the new settings that you have chosen the 
X is working or not . If it is working you have a file where if you thro 
each and every section you will know what all the parameters that are 
getting passed.

Hello All:

 I have the complete set of Debian 3.1 R0a (Sarge) CDs with me. If anyone
is interested in making a copy of it, then let me know and I will give
you the CDs for copying. There is a total of 16 CDs out of which, one is
a Bootable Business Card CD and another is the Network Install CD. The
remaining 14 CDs are the Debian Install + Packages CD. It would be better
if any one of the "CDs for Grab" users takes this copy and makes multiple
copies and distribute it to the other "CDs for Grab" users. I live in
Anna Nagar and work at Adyar. FYI and Thanks.

Praveen and others,

Thank you for all the suggestions.  I rootcaused the problem to BSNL's 
DNS server.  Here's the analysis.

Configuration:
. nForce2 ethernet on system connected to UTstar modem
. System configured to DHCP to modem to obtain IP address, gateway, DNS
. UTstar modem configured as PPPoE endpoint, i.e., system is not running
   PPPoE
. DNS server address returned in DHCP response is the modem's IP
   address, 192.168.1.1

I used Ethereal to monitor traffic on the Ethernet when I connected via 
the web browser to www.google.com.  Here's the traffic:

1. DNS request for A record for www.google.com from system to DNS server
    (UDP port 53) at 192.168.1.1.
2. DNS response from 192.168.1.1 to system.  A record shows
    www.google.com at 1.0.0.0!
3. TCP SYN connection packet from system to 1.0.0.0 port 80.  No
    response (this is expected -- there is nothing at 1.0.0.0).
4. TCP SYN repeated.

I switched the DNS server in /etc/resolv.conf to 61.1.128.5 
(bgl1dns-a.sancharnet.in) but the problem persisted.  I then switched it 
to a public DNS server 219.127.89.34 (ns1.shimpinomori.net) (see 
<http://www.opennic.unrated.net/public_servers.html>) and it worked 
perfectly thereafter.  The speed is ok -- downstream 330 kb/s, upstream 
90 kb/s on Home 1000 -- tested through <http://www.testmy.net>.  It is 
below spec.

BSNL's inbound mail server, smma.sancharnet.in, does not work 
(arbitrarily bounces mail saying that there is a virus in it when there 
isn't any).  BSNL's DNS server doesn't work either (returns arbitrary IP 
addresses for some domains).  In particular, neither server seems to 
like google.com or its subdomains.  Looks like the raw networking 
connection provided by BSNL is ok, any other service should be avoided.

Thanks.

Subject: [Ilugc] mounting ntfs



hi
I have installed Mandrake linux recently. In that i
tried mounting ntfs partition. I succeeded in doing
so. But this mounting stays only upto my login
session. I need to mount every time i login into the
session.Moreover i am able to access ntfs partition
files only through root and not with any other user
accounts. How to tweak to make the mounting permanent
and give access to users.

saithilak


Hi Sai,

To mount a partition across reboots, you need to add an entry in /etc/fstab.

Check the man pages for details.

Rgds,

I have had some trouble accessing the iitm debian mirror over the past
few weeks (I tried a few times spread out over the period).  In fact
at the time of sending this mail I am unable to ping the server.

Any known issues with the mirror?

You mean you did not get a refund for XP but had to pay 500 extra for

Did you received any customs call memo? I had also
received the same in Bangalore for just 20 CDs. But
fortunately that memo arrived very late at my place
and two days after that they had sent cd-box to my
place :-).

As per Atul's reply on Bangalore Linux Users non-tech
group, you should try to educate him with that customs
letter. If you pay then it might turn out to be
problem for other users who will receive the cds
later.

Message-ID: <dc538c3f05061220108a0c241@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

i see most of the people having trouble with connecting bsnl using linux.

here are few which i followed when using with mandrake 10.1 to connect
to internet using bsnl broadband ut star modem.

1. please check for ethernet configured with a ip address

ipconfig eth0
this will tell what ip is assigned with eth0.

2. check for ipconfig

this will list eth0, lo0, and ppp0 if connected.

3. if u see ipaddress assigned for both eth0 and ppp0, you may not get
connecction.
ifdown eth0

4. adsl-stop 
5.adsl-start

6. ipconfig 

7. check for ip in eth0 and ppp0 or pppX - X-means some numbers

8. meanwhile if you have more pppoe running, check for it using
ps -ef | grep pppoe
ps -ef | grep ppp

9.kill all the process and then again start using adsl-connect and if
connected, ping for google.com

10. you might get connected if u did as i mentioned before.

sometimes the server get connected but u may not able to browse. at
those stop using adsl-stop and then adsl-connect

remember only one instance of pppoe should be running. for this check
using ps as i mentioned above step 8

i hope this will help you.

There is a customs form on their site, that they usually ship with the CDs
Didnt they include that?

The campus network has been very unpredictable over the past few days.
Many important servers have not been performing consistently.
As of now, the ftp site is not available even locally. At least for
the next few days, do not depend on it. They have some upgradation
planned (i think they are switching over on the 16th). The performance
will hopefully be better after that.

Wipro's policy, as stated by them, is to ship all PCs with Microsoft
software. So neither of us had other alternatives. DOS was the
cheapest Microsoft program that I could buy. So I purchased that with
the laptop.

One Day One Command
===================

bzip2 -- A Block-sorting file (de)compressor.

Summary:

bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text
compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
considerably better than the conventional compressors, and approaches
the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.


Example:

$ bzip2 myfile -- Compress & Save it in myfile.bz2. Delete the input 
                  file.

$ bzip2 -k myfile -- Same as above. But Don't delete the input file.

$ bzip2 -d myfile.bz2 -- Decompress & Save it in myfile. Delete the 
                         input file.

$ bzip2 -kd myfile.bz2 -- Same as above. But don't delete the input 
                          file.

$ bzip2 -fd myfile.bz2 -- Force overwrite of output files (by default 
                          not overwrite existing files).

$ bzip2 -t myfile.bz2 -- Check the integrity of the compressed file.

$ bzip2 -v myfile -- Show the detail status info about the operation.

$ bzip2 -q myfile -- Suppress non-essential warning messages.

$ tar -cjvf myfile.tar.bz2 mydir -- BZip2 thru TAR command.

$ tar -xjvf myfile.tar.bz2 -- BUnZip2 thru TAR command.

Read: man bzip2

There are many companies with openings at any given point in time.
Very few post job requirements in the mailing list, most of them use
consultancies or job portals.

> 1)System admin
> 2)Developer

SysAdmin - many companies will be happy if you are certified, RHCE,
etc, might help
Developer - There are many subdivisions here, some that I can think of now are:

1. Web developer - LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
2. Application Development (C/C++,Python, GTK+,Qt,MySQL, PostgreSQL)
3. Network/IPC Programming (BSD Sockets programming, System V IPC)
4. Embedded Systems (Settop Boxes, IP Phones, Device Drivers, Kernel
customization, PDAs, Smartphones)

If you want to be a developer, then you need to choose..

Oh ok. Wipro charges extra for the OS but you have the option of
choosing between DOS, Win XP etc.? Decent within the constraints

   Actually, from my experience with FC3, the Fedora releases are
rock stable, hardly bleeding edge.

   Could somebody with the bandwidth please download the CD
ISOs, including the SRPM ISOs? This promises to be a good
release.

The iitm ftp site is loading now.(atleast locally).
But as of now, there is no '4' in the core/  folder.
The net connectivity from the institute has been inconsistent..so even
if there is an auto script running for mirroring the fc4 isos..i guess
it will take time for the entire thing to be ready.
too bad that this had to happen when fc4 is being released!..hope it
gets better after the 16th

Hi,

This is a bit wierd, i downloaded an iso in linux and then in windows.
when i checked the checksum with md5sum utility, in linux i got the
correct checksum as listed on the website but on windows it gave a
diffrent one(I thought checksums are always supposed to be the same).
Anyone has any idea why this happens(/n and /r/n diffrences??)?

In any case, thats not a good idea.  If you still insist on downgrading, 
you might want to keep track of the security and bug fixes through 
fedoralegacy.org while they last.  I would suggest trying out FC4 
instead. Just curious, what kind of issues did you face in FC3?

Probably. What did you use to download on Win32? Depends on its
default settings if you haven't modified them, of course. If you had
chosen binary mode of transfer it would not have been affected on
Win32 either.

FC4 uses sha1sum and its documented in

The worst problem I face is that if I type the wrong password after
locking the screen, gnome hangs! Then I have to go to one of the
virtual terminals and kill gnome and log in again. There are some
other issues too.

I need a system that will let me do my job - internet, email, OO. Of
course there are ways to iron out these issues but I do not have the
time for it. I expect them to be ironed out from the beginning. I had
none of these issues in RH 9 which I had before FC3. So, to save me
the pain & time of fixing the system am planning to downgrade. Am also
considering Debian Sarge.

thanks & regds,

In fact a couple of my colleagues who also use FC3 do not face this
problem (even without the updates). They face different problems.

Thanks - YMMV, but when you download a DVD ISO:

1) There's greater risk of corruption and a checksum mismatch, in which
case you'll have to download it again, which will mean an entire 2.6 GB
wasted download - which may happen several times.

2) The CDROM ISOs are smaller, so there's a better chance of a clean
download.

3) The CDROM ISOs can be used to install on just about any machine,
including legacy machines with just a CDROM drive.

4) At any rate, you can always burn the 4 CDROM ISOs into a single
DVD-R.

Hiya,

I do get some stuff from GNU once a while (to my Indian residence), I
never pay any customs crap becuz the folks at GNU write the commercial
value to be NIL on the USPS shipping form. I don't know if  you  are
off your rocker to pay unofficial customs duty for free software.

You can simply choose to download the DVD ISO using bittorrent. Better

Something like this?

#!/bin/bash
# Usage: file.sh filename
array=( `cat $1` )
echo "${array[@]}"

Not the best example. But, what are you actually
trying to accomplish?

Hi,
look on net for advanced bash scripting guide. Its a
good reference. There is one more reference called
bash scripting guide. Both should be available on
linux documentation project site. 
Look for complete alphabetical listing on linux

Subject: [Ilugc] FC4 Xconfig problem
Message-ID: <42AF7C97.9060708@gmail.com>

hello,

I have downloaded & installed FC4 dvd  . I have an HCL 15" LCD Monitor.
Originally fc4 graphic mode had problems(monitor goes to stanby mode), 
so i installed in text mode.
When FC 4 starts the monitor goes blank. So i went to runlevel 3.  . 
/usr/bin/setup is not working.Monitor goes to standby mode.
Is there a text mode xconfig tool for fedora core X (FC3 ,FC4 must have 
similar tool). I also tried manually configuring
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.

Thanks in advance

Vasudevan

Message-ID: <001b01c57177$f7087260$0201a8c0@DATAONE>

Hi All,

I recently got BSL Broadband connection.
Just to test the speed , I went to ZDNetindia.com and clicked on "How fast
is your ISP" link. In windows it showed 140 kbps. I rebooted, went intoDeb
Sarge, did the same thing and it shows 484 kbps! This is done just now,
morning 6.40AM. Having doubts, I killed the browser, restarted and again did
it. It showed 490, 384, 452 & 412 kbps in 4 seperate tries!

Does anybody else have similar experience?

I recently downloaded FC4 at 200+ KBps on BSNL... though the speed
wore off to its usual 30 KBps the next day... BSNL does not give you
dedicated bandwidth.. so it is highly unreliable... you can also use
the bandwidth monitor at:

Subject: [Ilugc] PPPO failed - Help needed to clear the mess created by
	installing rp-pppoe in FC3
Message-ID: <99a2c78905061422006b2c12d5@mail.gmail.com>

I've FC3 and Modem is Starcom UT300R2,BSNL Broadband. 

I tried installing the rp-pppoe in FC3. I didn't realise that it was already 
available. To test if rp-pppoe was available or not I tried running 'adsl 
setup' command and the result was "command not found", so I assumed that 
rp-pppoe needs to be installed -One has to log in as "su -" to run 'adsl 
setup'...I learned about it hard way and late :-( 

Anyway I followed the instruction given in 
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/BSNL_Broadband to install rp-pppoe. I believe 
now this has created a mess.

I got an error while trying to install rp-ppoe (Error message: Following 
files have been found.....Conflict in files - It's a big error message 
listing the files that have been found).

I later learned about logging in as "su -", now the 'adsl setup' worked and 
I gave all parameters. However 'adsl start' timesout trying to connect. I 
checked 'adsl status' which give following message: "can't read PID file /*
var**/**run*/pppoe.conf-adsl.*pid*.pppo" 

Also 'pppo' fails during booting the system. 

I don't know where to go from here? :-)...thinking of clean installing FC3 
again.

Read the file in a loop and do all operations on it
like variable assignment,etc

while read Variable1
do

Check if you have the ppp kernel module, or that ppp is compiled into the 
kernel.

If it's a module,
	insmod ppp
should work. If it's compiled in (and you have the kernel sources, of course), 
you should be able to cd to /usr/src/linux, make menuconfig and check 
somewhere in device drivers->network or so...

Also, try running pppd from the command line. It may throw some light. :-)

try system-config-display in runlevel 3. It will probe the monitor, try 
setting up the configuration file and start the X server. Make sure you 
have xfs service enabled and running.

"Threatened" ?  You trying to be a but sensationalist, aren't you? :-)

Home 500 plan was always meant to be a 1GB cap. account.  And as a
special introductory offer for early adopters, there was no cap till
30 June.  Too bad if you did not bother to read the terms and
conditions properly.

Intead of configuring adsl, you want to reinstall the
whole system? Huh! Either way you will need to
configure adsl.

Please check whether rp-pppoe is already installed

If it is already installed, please continue with adsl-setup and

# rpm -ivh rp-pppoe....rpm

If it is successfully installed, then you can continue with adsl-setup

Hi,
 Is anyone using Iqara Broadband connection. It has 
just come to our area. Want to know how good they

   Good stuff - especially Xen. I noticed that they moved a great deal of
stuff that I use all the time (xfce4, freeciv, abiword, ...) from 'core' into
'extras'. Anyway, I usually reinstall from SRPMs, so this is not a problem.
Some significant performance gains reported from gcc-g++-4.0, for
stuff that depends on qt/kde. That includes qemu (by French demi-
god-hacker Fabrice Bellard) so this is looking good.

Note that Fedora Extras repository is enabled by default so you can do a 
yum install <packagename> for any of the packages you want to install 
from core of the extras repository. The release notes has other details

One Day One Command (By Vishravars Ramasubramanian)
===================================================

dos2unix -- DOS/MAC to UNIX text file format converter.

Summary:

Each OS will indicate the line end using Line Feed (LF,10) or Carriage
Return (CR,13). So when tranfering a file from DOS to Linux, you have
to convert the Line end from DOS format to Linux format.

dos2unix will convert the DOS/MAC Text file to Unix format.

Unix uses LF as line end, Windows/DOS uses CR/LF and MacOS uses CR.

Examples:

$ dos2unix dos.txt -- Convert and replace dos.txt.

$ dos2unix -n dos.txt gnu.txt -- Convert dos.txt and write into
                                 gnu.txt

$ dos2unix -k dos.txt -- Convert and replace a.txt while keeping 
                         original date stamp.

Read: man dos2unix

Bye :)

I recently updated my debian box by apt-get update & apt-get upgrade.
Now about 590 MB of spftware is sitting in /var/cache.

Problem is my deb partiton is cramped for space(it is installed in a 4GB
partition ) & I am left with a little over 400MB free space.

Since the box has all latest apps now, is it okay to empty /var/cache/apt?
Or will it break something? 
I am a newbie in this apt- things so please point out  if any problems likely
to occurr.

Save that patch somewhere (say /tmp/patch.diff).

Download the sylpheed source tarball - unless you already have it.
Untar it. Change into the source directory (cd sylpheed-whatever).

Run this command: patch -p4 < /tmp/patch.diff - keep an eye on the
messages it gives out.

Build sylpheed (./configure; make; make install).

That should be it.

All this, assuming you built sylpheed from sources.

------------------------

In my case, it was installed originally with debian sarge installation (PCQ
DVD) by apt. How to do for that?

I am also having the same prob, but I thought it is the BSNL broadband that
is playing the trick. This did not crop up when I was using dial up. I
cannot say for sure  exactly it has started  from the moment I  started in
broadband way. But anyway the problem is there.

One more thing, in Deb, the connection is there simply on booting. I
configured rp-pppoe , but adsl-start does not work, it gives an error mesage
> /dev/null 1&2

This error problem also is reported in ILUGC.

Does all this add up to something?

I am currently in baroda and i am using iqara broadband. I am
satisfied with the service, in that my surfing experience has
been good. 

I have been checking my internet speed using zdnetindia.com 
('How fast is you ISP' link) and during day time i get speeds
between 100 and 150 kbps. On certain ocations at night it
clocked above 300. Such is iqara 'broadband'.

But since i don't do any downloads here, surfing at 100-150 
kbps is a smooth experience.

It worked seamlessly with rp-pppoe on FC 1. Never needed to 
call the support desk till now (except for konwing their DNS 
IP for rp-pppoe configuration)

PHYs are usually located on a network interface card itself, but there
are cards available which have external MII connectors for attaching
external PHYs.

mii-tool display/checks/sets the status of a network interface's MII
unit.  Most fast Ethernet adapters use an MII to autonegotiate link
speed and duplex setting.

Examples:

# mii-tool -- Show shot status info about the network card.

# mii-tool -v -- Show detailed status.

# mii-tool -R -- Reset the MII unit to default value.

# mii-tool -r -- Restart the Auto Negotiation.

# mii-tool -w -- Watch the network interface and show if there is any 
       change in the status.(Run it and remove & reconnect the cable).

# mii-tool -F 10baseT-HD -- Forcibly set the capability to 10Mpbs and 
                            Half Duplex mode.

# mii-tool -A 10baseT-HD, 10baseT-FD -- Enable and restart Auto
        Negotiation, and advertise only the specified capabilities.

Message-ID: <895952550506210601171b5c9a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Ilugc,

Is there any tool that will tell you how much network data has passed
through an interface?
Something like a daemon that keeps constantly monitoring the traffic
and counting it and at any point in time can produce a statistics
report.

This could be very helpful in finding out, whether ISPs like
sify/bsnl/TI/Airtel are at least approximately correct in their
billing amounts.

I read in one of the magazines abt a tool called vnstat. Want to know
if any others exist?

I am interested tools that can run on Windows/Linux/Other x86 based OSs.

Thanks

If you mean to lock the file once a user checkout the file use cvs
edit command. For another OSS version control tool you can consider
Subversion which is an improved version of CVS.

 `--------

Actually you _can_ do that (lock files for single use) in CVS
with with the 'cvs admin -l' command, but only admin or those
in his group can do that. so not of much use while setting up
cvs for practical use.

The feature of allowing multiple users to edit the same file
and then diffing and merging the files is seen more as a 
'power feature'. But in order to use these kind of features,
programmers need to be mature and diciplined. 

You can use 'cvs watch' to track who is editing a file. You 
can make cvs notify you when a file is being modified. 

But somehow I don't think these will impress your department, 
will they ? ;-)

CVS handles this situation differently. If more than one user tries to
"write" (ie, commit) the same file, CVS tries to merge all the changes
together, and if the merge is beyond its capabilities, then it flags
the file with 'C' (conflict). The second person commiting is supposed
to resolve these conflicts.

 `-----------

1. Do you issue the cvs init command again after changing 
group of CVSROOT ?

2. Who is the owner of CVSROOT ? root ? In that case, does 
that happen when root (or owner) issues any cvs command ?

I had created a user called cvs with his own group(cvs), and
used that login to setup things. 
chown -R cvs.cvs /usr/local/cvsroot

Rip the DVD to .avi and then burn it to CDs.

Example:

$ mencoder -dvd-device /dev/cdrom dvd://1 -o file.avi
-ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:vhq:vbitrate=1800
-oac copy

Dear friends,

In my office also people were saying non-sense stuffs[afraid of conflicts 
so, no need to move from VSS to CVS].
Don't worry we can achieve reserved edit feature in cvs[cvs is client side - 
All users must follow these simple rules inorder to implement pure reserved 
edit].Usage of locks is not needed at all. Just the edit notification "cvs 
edit" is enough to implement reserved edit.
Server:
Host either cvs or cvsnt server. We have a cvs server [cvs 1.11.18].

Command-line clients:
1.Just install cvsnt for Windows[installer]/linux[RPM] and start working.
2. All users must have a .cvsrc file in their HOME directory containing text 
"edit -c"
3. Always do "cvs edit -c <filename>" immediately do "cvs update <filename>" 
[Replicating VSS behaviour "checkout"]. After this edit and commit your file 
as "cvs commit <filename>".


Windows clients Wincvs:
1. All users must have the "checkout read only" option in their general 
options tab enabled .
2. All users must have a .cvsrc file in their HOME directory containing text 
"edit -c"
3. All users must have a copy of updateedit.py in their 
WINCVSINSTALLDIR\macros folder
4. FOR RESERVED EDDITING A FILE:All users must use updateedit.py to 
"Reserved edit" a file. copy the below given content as updateedit.py and 
save it in WINCVSINSTALLDIR\macros folder.Assign a shortcut for the 
macro.All users must use that short cut to automatically 
checkeditors+update+edit the file.
5.No <http://5.No> one should remove the read-only option for files in 
sandbox[checkedout local copy] and do nasty things.[VSS is absolutely 
different from CVS]

4.All users must have the "checkout read only" option in their general 
options tab enabled .
5.All users must have a .cvsrc file in their HOME directory containing text 
"edit -c"
6.FOR RESERVED EDDITING A FILE: There is a TCL script called "Edit safely" 
in macros menu which does "cvs editors+update+edit" [use this option alone 
to reserved edit]
7.FOR COMMITING: After this just edit the content of your file and commit.
8.No <http://8.No> one should remove the read-only option for files in 
sandbox[checkedout local copy] and do nasty things.[VSS is absolutely 
different from CVS]

Eclipse IDE's cvs component:
1.Eclipse IDE comes with inbuilt cvs support- A very good frontent 
indeed[Annotations,differences,recover deleted files,etc., are very good]. 
2.Configure your eclipse: Windows-->preferences
In team-->CVS-->Wath/Edit : Check "Configure rojects to use Watch/Editon 
checkout"
: "Before a CVS edit notification is sent to the server" select the option 
"Always prompt"
3.The only drawback is that if a guy is already editing a file, and if you 
right click the file and click team-->edit Eclipse prompts that the guy is 
editing it and will ask you whether to send cvs edit notification or not. 
Just click
cancel and try later.
4.Similarly you have to manually update the file before editing.

In our office we are using wincvs in windows clients and Eclipse in linux as 
well as windows.
visit http://geocities.com/ignacius_n/ 
In the files section there are documents prepared by me[will be really 
helpful]. 
http://geocities.com/ignacius_n/files/index.html
1.It <http://1.It> contains the tool vss2cvs a perl utility to move VSS 
repository to CVS repository. 
2.Documents for configuring cvs server in normal mode and secured mode.
3.Documents for configuring CVSROOT - cvs administration files through gcvs.
4.Setup and work in gcvs with good screenshots.

Yes you can install freebsd in a single _primary_ partition.
Internally it separates that partitions in to different
slices(equivalent of linux partitions).

The freebsd boot loader can also be installed in the same partition
and can be multibooted using grub/lilo.

Subject: [Ilugc] TOP500 list released - Linux increases share
Message-ID: <a8f99012050622234876eb942e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,
            The latest TOP500 list of supercomputers was released yesterday,
with no real surprises - just continuation of the existing megatrends in favour
of clustered commodity systems running Linux. The list is here:

http://www.top500.org/

To view the 12-year trend chart as classified by OS, see this link:

http://www.top500.org/lists/2005/06/overtime.php?c=8

Linux has moved from 0% in 1998 to about 70% in 2005.
All M$ OSes combined are stuck at the same level
as in 1993, namely 0%.

To view the 12-year trend chart by manufacturer, see:

http://www.top500.org/lists/2005/06/overtime.php?c=7

The big increases are by IBM & HP, who offer both
proprietary and Linux clusters. They've have increased 
their combined share from about 5% in 1993 to about
80% in 2005, mostly at the expense of proprietary
vector vendors Cray, Fujitsu & NEC; and specialized
scientific computing vendors Intel & TMC. These 5
had a combined share of 80% in 1993 and have now
been decimated down to about 5% in 2005, with two
total wipe-outs (Intel Scientific and TMC).

Our little Penguin has come a long way, very
quickly, when nobody was looking.

On a related note, a large storage cluster (1500 Terabytes)
running Linux has been recently delivered to the Internet Archive,
home of The Wayback Machine:

Let me give you some general advice to avoid CVS file permission problems.

All users of CVS should be members of the same group (say, cvs). Their
primary groups could be different (your distro default).

binand@snape[~]:[03:39](20) id binand
uid=3001(binand) gid=3001(binand) groups=3001(binand),601(cvs)

Your CVSROOT (say /var/cvsroot) should be mode/owner 2770,
anyuser:cvs. In my case, it looks like this:

binand@snape[~]:[03:41](22) ls -ld /var/cvsroot/
drwxrws---    3 root     cvs     4096 Apr 23 06:44 /var/cvsroot/

If you already have a cvs repository, the best thing to do would be to run:

find /var/cvsroot -type d | xargs chmod 2770
find /var/cvsroot | xargs chown root:cvs
find /var/cvsroot -type f | xargs chmod 660

If you are running cvs pserver via xinetd, set the umask option to 006
in your /etc/xinetd.d/cvspserver file. If your users use cvs over
other means (say rsh/ssh), set the umask to 006 in your shell
initialization file (~/.bashrc for bash).

Unless you really know what you are doing (ie, have read and
understood the CVS manual completely), do not fiddle around with files
in /var/cvsroot/yourproject/CVSROOT. The defaults there are usually
fine to start a collaborative development environment.

===================

lsdev - Display information about installed hardware

Summary:

lsdev gathers information about your computer's installed hardware
from the interrupts, ioports and dma files in the /proc directory,
thus giving you a quick overview of which hardware uses what I/O
addresses and what IRQ and DMA channels.

This program only shows the kernel's idea of what hardware is present,
not what's actually physically available.

Examples:

$ lsdev

Read: man lsdev

Greetings!

Thanks to AB for purchasing an official copy of
Revolution OS DVD for ILUGC. 

In colleges, where we haven't yet played
The.Code.Linux.avi, we can play it first, and in
subsequent sessions we can screen the Revolution OS.
If you'd like we can simply play it during one of our
weekly meets.

This DVD _cannot_ be copied. We will inform T.J.S.
Moore whenever we screen it at any
college/university/institution, so he adds it to his
existing database.

However, all the Indian computers on that list (Kabru...) have been
displaced.

  Could somebody with some spare bandwidth download the
English version 'The Code' with English subtitles? That
Scandinavian version that we've been playing is a little
incomprehensible at times.

  On another note, the Philips DVP-642 DVD player can play
certain AVIs, include DivX-encoded AVIs, so this may allow
us to simply use a stock TV or video monitor, instead of
a dedicated PC/projector to play it, if someone can get
hold of one and check if it plays 'The Code'.

   Actually, depending on how you define it, there never was an Indian
computer on the TOP500 list. There were (and still are) several 
clusters (mostly IBM and HP) at Indian sites, however.

   Kabru (at Matscience) was just a cluster of stock Supermicro dual-Xeon
nodes that were imported off-the-shelf from the US and hooked up using
Fast Ethernet and running some Beowulf variant. Anybody can build a
2x or 4x version of the same thing anywhere in the world, and many have
done so.

   AFAIK, the Param cluster (which dropped off the list a few years ago)
was stock imported Sun UltraSparc nodes hooked together by CDAC.
Sun has been almostly completely wiped out of the TOP500 by commodity
x86 nodes running Linux, so it's no surprise that Param is also out.

I recently bought the Philips DVP642K, its pretty cool - plays most
DivX 's. I usually re-encode the ones that dont work with mencoder and
get them working.

I could test out if 'The Code' works (or re-encode if it doesn't) - I
have searched around for it on the net before, but couldn't find it -
could someone point out where I could download it ??

I'll bring a CD of the Scandinavian version to the next meet,

May be. I used install all commands during installtion. You can very
well install this command from source. lsdev is part of the procinfo

Not present in the default FC4 config too. Installed the package 
procinfo. The package has two more utilities :
/usr/bin/procinfo
/usr/bin/socklist

May be you can have them in queue next for the One Day One Command.

Sorry if it is little deviating from the topic, but,
what do you mean by "Indian computers"? Computers
manufactured in India? Computers running software
developed in India? Computers owned by firms in India?

Run fdisk to figure out your Windows partition (fdisk -l /dev/hda),
and just reformat it (mke2fs -j /dev/hdaN, where N is the Windows
partition).

Needless to say, you will lose all data, take backups etc.

Message-ID: <1119614584.1792.22.camel@mazda>

Hi All, 

I am trying to do load balancing over the 2 ethernet interface eth0,
eth1 I have.

I have placed both interface in two ip groups , like
eth0 : 192.168.1.XXX  and gw 192.168.1.1 -- coneected to Net
eth1 : 192.168.200.XX and gw as 192.168.200.1 -- connetec to Net

I am ising "ip" utility to set the following load balancing, so that if
any of the eth0, eth1 goes of the packets can be routed through the
other. I hope both does not go off at the same time.. :)

My Steps:

echo 200 T1 >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
echo 200 T2 >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables

ip link set lo up
ip addr add 127.0.0.1/8 brd + dev lo
#ip address show
                                                                                                                             ip link set eth0 up
ip addr add 192.168.1.141/24 brd + dev eth0
echo 200 T1 >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
echo 201 T2 >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0 src 192.168.1.141 table T1
ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 table T1
                                                                                                                             
ip link set eth1 up
ip addr add 192.168.200.103/24 brd + dev eth1
ip route add 192.168.200.0/24 dev eth1 src 192.168.200.103 table T2
ip route add default via 192.168.200.1 table T2

ip rule add from 192.168.1.141 table T1
ip rule add from 192.168.200.103 table T2

ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0 table T2
ip route add 192.168.200.0/24 dev eth1 table T2
ip route add 127.0.0.0/8 dev lo table T2


Also I tried deleting route for both and add

ip route add default scope global nexthop via 192.168.200.1 dev eth1
weight 1 nexthop via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 weight 1

Observation:

When I remove the link for eth1, 

wget --proxy-user=mallik --proxy-passwd=mallik 192.168.200.5
--17:19:23--  http://192.168.200.5/

I got a pretty simple solution :back up ur existing Data,
take the linux distribution and install it, it will definetly have a Disk 
Utility, and in with a gui or atleast ascii art. Use it and delete ur 
windows partition and install your new linux... the new lin distro will 
check for existing OSes and it will configure grub/lilo

Why uninstall windows? Just format the HDD over from whichever distro you want 
to use. They all have some partitioning system...

    We bought Montavista Pro 3.1 for a MPC 8270 (Powerquicc II) Based
custom board. Well my experience says " MONTAVISTA SUCKS" ...... Their
Support/Distributor in India -> Celestial <- have no idea about what
they are selling to you.They make huge promises and you get into big
problems....

     Infact we chose a ported distro from montavista to save time, and
after getting the package we figured out that most of the on-chip
peripherals were not supported and our project got delayed by months.
We had to extend help to them in bringing up u-boot/kernel on a
reference board and make them (celestial) realise that their package
had nothing in it. They got us a hacked port which contained the
source from another supplier called "ARABELLA" and still pieces like
DMA and PCI was lost.We wasted so much of time on them.

   If you are looking into POWERQUICC then "Arabella" is what you
should be closing in. They offer services that includes bringing up
the bootloader/kernel on your custom board (you save a lot of
resources and time).....

BottomLine: Just make sure you get all that you need from them and get
it confirmed via Emails.... ( Eg:- POSIX Messages are not supported in
many versions , etc ,etc ......... ) and dont use their NFS binaries
:-) .

Cheers,

Bharath.G

PS :This is my experience on the "Power Quicc" Platform with
Montavista... i really dont know about the Rest ........

When I last checked - sometime like 2 years back, it used to be around
USD 1500 plus, it was for a ppc development board. Same was the case
for timesys BSPs.

They can be recreated with little effort. basically you pay for their
'support' in case you are looking for ready made solutions.

Then I went about creating my own BSP. Took me 5 months the first time
- I did it part-time as a student. But experienced people should be
able to do it in less than a month (I can do it now in that time for
most of the boards).

data cable has RS-232 terminal/USB?. I am not sure about USB, never tried.

Anyway, this is what I did for Airtel on a Sony Ericsson k700i. I will
tell you what to do for Data cable RS-232 (I was using IrDA, which is
quite more complicated):

1) Make sure your serial link is detected as ttyS? (check with
setserial /dev/ttyS[01], you should see 16650 uart listed)

2) Modprobe 8250 fror serial_core functionality and if you see no
ttyS? stuff in /dev or dmesg. If you have IrDA port and if it is
enabled by default (er, usually not but just in case) then disable it
with setserial command (setserial /dev/ttySx uart none) and then
follow on.

3) Since it is 16650 uart if its datacable (usually) you should be
able to run wvdialconf to detect the modem. (command: mv
/etc/wvdial.conf ~/wvdia.conf; wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf)

4) Now open /etc/wvdial.conf and set the parameters for phone number
(*99#? stuff. For nokia if I am not wrong it is *99#1 if you have only
one connection parameter settings in your phone). Enter your Username
= and Password = parameters.

5) For your access point settings you should edit your INIT strings.
You might get the strings from either google (search?q=your model +
your service provider) or get it from your modem log on windows if you
have one.

6) Edit /etc/ppp/pap-secrets and add your "username * password" line.

7) wvdial

Thats it.

   I haven't used Montavista, but I can see some obvious discrepancies in
your story. You claim that your board was a custom board, yet you
expected an off-the-shelf tool-chain/BSP from Montavista to work on
that board - are you some kind of retards or something ??

  It's obvious, isn't it? Repeat after me, a processor port != a platform port
aka Board-Support Package (BSP). If you thought that they were the
same thing, you were the retards, and Montavista is not at fault.

   Better still, just use a standard reference design that already has a
validated bootloader, kernel and BSP, and forget about all this custom
crap. If you build a custom board, then bring-up is *your* responsibility.
If you think that you're going to be spoon-fed a binary ROM image that's
going to 'just work', I'd like to know what you've been smoking.

Thanks for the clarification. After reading about this in the Hindu

were present "in" India, but that's clear now.

Dear Members,
Regarding the T-Shirts issue, we have discussed the same in the last
meet held on Mafoi academy.Due to our  mail server problem we are
deserted. All this mail thread  dates are showing as 1st of
april.2005, i am not sure that am i replying for a older thread or is
this thread is a current one.  I am doing this assignment  on Non
profit basis. Kindly some one of you tell me how the payment mode is
going to be.
If it is a cash and carry, (well the decent way) we have to collect
money on placing the orders. Merely confirming the order
electronically, i am not clear how many are in serious look out of
T-shirts. My idea is that making a promo for  "SOFTWARE FREEDOM DAY
SEPT 10" will be  ideal. I request the members to define the payment
process, i can vouch for the real  orders to be delivered. Expecting
ur ideas/suggestion/guidance in this regard. Thanking you

Hi!

  I personally feel that we can collect a token advance from those who
are interested in buying the T-shirts at a meeting. Then place the
order for the reqd no. of T-shirts. Then we can get our T-shirts at
the next meeting paying the balance amount.

  I know it is a problem for those who can't attend the meetings. As
for myself, I have not attended any meeting ever since the venue
shifted to the Ma-Foi academy. But then, some one should come up with
a better idea to solve that problem.

Bye!

A very bad, and a wrong answer. Try to read the question first ..He
doesnt want to dialin to his ISP using a winmodem

What you want is to set up a dialin and radius server - google for it -
lots of documentations, TLDP howto etc etc.

If you can provide details of your board, we can help
much better in decision making process, means, should
we go for MV _or_ not?

Let's put it this way:
(If you can share this details)

o Which core is available on your board?
  - ARM (ARM7/9/11) [I only have exp. on ARM7/9/11].
  - PPC 
o Which semi. company provides solution (aka chip)
based on it for your board?

  - Texas Instruments, Motorola, Cirrus Logic etc.

o Is this your custom board?
  - If yes, do you have reference board (also called
as
Evaluation boards) port available in open-source
community? You can easily port Linux based on that.
[community will love to help you  out...]

  - If yes, and want to go for MV then pay them for
your custom board porting. 

  - If yes, and decided on MV then be ready to get
solution based on 2.4.x ?

  - If yes, MV and *not* 2.4.x then pay them more
money to go for 2.6.x.

o Choosing solution (BSP) based on 2.4.x _or_ 2.6.x is
based on your view/requirments of customer.

o MV gives cee versions based on 2.4.x - as it is
field tested and stable and many other things. But it
doesn't mean 2.6.x is having cool features. [again it
depends upon the view].

o Support: Yes, if you want 2.4.x then go for MV. As
community may not be able support 2.4.x. You have do
hacking on your own with MV.

o Money: Doesn't matter much, if you want quick
solution for client or for your product demos.

o If you decided *not* to go for MV:

  o 2.6.x kernel is the best way to go.
  o See that your architecture is supported or not.
  o Checkout arch/ directory under Linux then.
  o Decide upon the bootloader. (u-boot, blob, redboot
and more...).
  o Decide upon the toolchain( binutils, gcc, glibs,
uclibs, busybox, tinylogin - ofcourse support is there
for well-known archs. eg. ARM, PPC).


o Now, with 2.6.x ...start porting, with very good
JTAG. 
  o See that your core is supported there.
  o e.g. BDI 2000, Trace32, and EmbICE etc.

I hope this is will help you to decide where to go...

Message-ID: <20050625153154.19290.qmail@web54507.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all
 
I have been dual booting mdk 10.1 and win xp with grub. My system configuration is PIII /Intel 937Mhz /RAM 256/HDD 40GB. Mandrake 10.1 was working fine till last week. Suddenly I am not able to boot Mandrake. It stops with "calibrating delay loop ... and not proceeding further.
 
I googled a bit to find what could be the problem. Suggested causes were memory or some incompatable hardware. 
 
I tried Knoppix 3.6 and then Ubuntu Live CDs. Both are working fine without any problem.
 
Windows XP is also booting without any problem. So I don't suspect any hardware related issues. As a last resort I reinstalled the Mandrake 10.1. Installation completed smoothly. But while booting system hangs with "Calibrating delay loop .....
 
Did anybody face this problem with Mdk 10.1? What could be cause?   Will installing the latest Mandriva 2005 solve this problem?

Comparison:

Question: "How to solve 2 * 3 + 4?"
Your answer: "Hey, I know 3 + 4 = 7"

Result:
Your statement even if correct is irrelevant and inappropriate as an
answer to the question asked as such.

Happens with precompiled kernels that do not know how to handle the
local 8253 or friends. Possibly other reasons exist as well.

My suggestion: build a custom kernel. You could zcat /proc/config.gz
and base your new kernel config on that.

Tough to build a kernel if the system doesn't boot in the first place :)

I can't find a /proc/config.gz on my box - do I have to modprobe something?

IKCONFIG_PROC has to be set in the kernel config options to dump the
current running config in /proc/config.gz

The fedora maintainers dont seem to like the idea of enabling that,
especially as they (like nearly every other distro maintainer) ship the
config used for the default kernel as /boot/config [which symlinks to
/boot/config-(version)]

As he's able to boot other linuxes the best option would be to build a
mandrake boot floppy with a custom kernel and boot off that.

We are working on no. of platforms (x86,Blackfin,MIPS,ARM etc) and
most of our boards are custom boards. And apart from MV, you have
experience with any other vendors, plz share with us.

As root user, fdisk -l <devicename> where devicename  is usually hda

fdisk  and remove the entries from grub. That should do it. Having a

Subject: [Ilugc] Wine on the Rocks !?!
Message-ID: <f480bf1e05062523002816bc81@mail.gmail.com>

Wine  is now  more mature  and  almost on  the rocks.   I tried  using
wine-20040716-1rh73winehq.i686.rpm  on  a  MEPIS  Desktop.   It  could
install and run many windows applications with the simple commands:
 
#wine SETUP.EXE //set up program for foo.exe
#wine foo.exe

WinZip  and PKZip  work fine  on wine.   I could  install and  use the
following:

Free Software* by Mark Overmars
http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/markov/kids/
This  includes a  good  Drawing Program  for  Children, programs  that
describe basic problems  in robotics etc.  Most of  the source code is
available.

Home Planet by John Walker
http://www.fourmilab.ch/homeplanet/homeplanet.html

(The  binary is in  public domain,  but, John  walker has  promised to
release the source code by the end of this year)

Sonique Music Player
http://sonique.lycos.com/download/

http://appdb.winehq.org/ gives  a list of applications  that are known
to  run on  wine.  Wine  could help  many existing  windows  users, to
migrate to GNU/Linux with more confidence. Application like Visual Fox
Pro run well  and this may help many to migrate  to free software more
smoothly.

One of the key  issues may be that IE does not  yet run on wine.  This
means VC++ does not run well on wine (Why should installing a compiler
depend on an application like IE?  Amazing, but looks like that is how
things work in  the windows world.)  I could  run and install Netscape
6, and the  more recent wine versions could be set  up as servers, and
run Fire  Fox.  Mozilla is compatible  with the windows IE  API, and a
Mozilla Activex  Control is available  that could totally  replace IE.
But the issue  is that one has  to build Mozilla with VC,  and VC wont
install without IE. I am not sure I am correct here, but if any of you
are familiar with how these  things work, please think of contributing
to the wine project.  

Many  are attached  to windows  like  children are  attached to  toys.
Letting  them keep  their toys  at ~/.wine/drive_c/Program  Files that
looks  just like  C:\Programs Files  while wine  runs, should  be very
reassuring and  make the transition  from non-free to free  software a
very comfortable one.

The command parameter is actually 't' for tree, not 'b.'

Hi,

I have found few links in web which has the full copy of the
following books + many more interesting books(soft copy).

"Understanding The Linux Kernel" by Daniel Bovet and Marco Cesati
"Linux Kernel Development, Second Edition" by Robert Love
"Linux Device Drivers, 3rd Edition (2005)" by Alessandro Rubini, Jonathan
Corbet et al.
"Linux kernel Internals" by M Beck, H Bohme et al.

and other good books like

Advanced Linux Programming
UNIX Network Programming Volume 1, 2nd Edition - Richard Stevens
Richard Stevens - Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment
Linux Certification Bible
Integrating Linux and Windows
Linux On The Mainframe
and books on solaris internals and FreeBSD internals too.


I dont know whether it is good or legal to share these links in
this mailing list.

So, if anyone is interested to get the book, please mail me
offline, I would send the link.

With a hope that this would be very useful for many hungry minds.

Thanks and Regards,
carti

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0506271024120.25754-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

=== Fwd ===

From: Yann Forget <yann@forget-me.net>

So far the Wikipedias in Indian languages have seen very slow
progress. There are among the lowest ratio "number of articles /number
of speakers". There a number of technical and other reasons.

Some people from the Wikimedia Foundation think that a financial help
may boost these languages.They are willing to sponsor students who
might contribute writing articles in Indian languages on different
subjects for Wikipedia.

Here are some proposed rules:

* The articles should be written in Indian languages from scratch or
  translated (propably from the English Wikipedia).
* The articles should be encoded in Unicode.
* The articles sould be released under the GFDL licence (free to edit 
  and copy).
* The articles should be more than 500 words.

Here are a list of articles:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_articles_all_languages_should_have

This list should be completed with specific Indian topics (Indian
states and cities, personalities, events, etc.). A proposition of a
list of Indian subjects is welcome.

For each language, we will need at least two persons to review the
quality of the articles (teachers, writers, etc.).

So far, we got very few answers although we contacted languages
departments of all main Indian universities. So we want to spread this
offer further.

Please could you also transfer this message to people who might be
interested by this project?

Regards,
Yann Forget

Someone  still  managed to  find  my email  addy  listed  on the  site
somewhere as the  "webmaster". Never Mind.  

Seems they are in  need of "CDs" and are in a  remote place in Gujarat
where there is little access to  tech. I have suggested them to get to
http://shipit.ubuntulinux.org.

Thought someone here might be kind enough to send out some CDs to this
person. Unfortunately all I have  is lots and lots of various releases
of debian CDs.

Thanks,

   Respected Sir,

    I'm thaddeus from india. I've been using windows xp since a pretty
   long time and now i'm thinking over to switch to linux. Frankly
   telling you in gujarat we rarely use licensed versions of windows
   because the vendor's from who we buy our assembled PC's they
   themselves install the OS and could copy cd's for us and give us free
   of charge. You won't imagine we have more than 10,000 users in our
   city who use pirated versions of windows. It's very easy getting a
   pirated version you won't imagine less then 50 Rs. Moreover we don't
   face any problems with these softwares. Only companies like compaq,
   hcl etc give licensed versions while local hardware guys could give it
   at dirty cheap rates. I don't know of any anti-piracy squad that I
   could complain to in India. If you any idea obout such a group then
   please do let me know at the earliest.

   Sir, i'm thinking over to switch to linux. I've heard that redhat is
   the best for trying out. In our city there are no people using linux
   and all are afraid of using linux as no one knows anything about it.

    I even don't know where to look for linux that's why i decided to
   seek your help. I've been to local vendors but they say that linux is
   not used by the home user so we don't keep copies of linux.

     I don't have an internet connection at home so it's difficult for me
   to download the whole linux setup from any website.

    Would it be possible for you to send me a cd of any version of linux
   (suse,fedora,PCQlinux2005)? I'm keenly interested to work with linux
   and I really want to experience it for the first time. If given a
   chance to promote linux then it would be my greatest previlage.

    I would be very obliged if you could send me a cd of linux (home
   edition / desktop edition). Even an old version will do as you might
   not be giving free distributions.

     I'm making this request as I don't have access to the internet all
   the time. It would be a great favor on me if you could send me the CD.

      I hope you will consider my case and give me a favorable reply at
   the earliest.

   Looking forward to hear from you at the earliest.

   Yours truly,
   Thaddeus Fernandes

Hmm... He posted the same email to linux-india-help as well, and was
asked to get in touch with his nearest LUG, as listed at
www.linux-india.org. This morning I notice that someone from Ahmedabad
LUG has already replied to him.

Hi Smarty,

     It is usually off a BSP for a reference board. What makes you
think that the toolchain differs for the same processor / Family ?????
I am not sure if you really know  what a toolchain is ......

> It's obvious, isn't it? Repeat after me, a processor port != a >platform port aka Board-Support Package (BSP). If you thought >that they were the same thing, you were the retards, and >Montavista is not at fault.

  I dont think you understand what "On-chip" Peripherals are really
!!! And it seems like you have never used a BSP .

If you build a custom board, then bring-up is *your* >responsibility. If you think that you're going to be spoon-fed a >binary ROM image that'sgoing to 'just work', I'd like to know what >you've been smoking.

  I guess SMARTIEs like you do that. We port our bootloader to our
custom boards and to save time , we buy the on-chip components (in a
BSP ) which ofcourse is a reference board close to our custom board.
Like someone said, it does take time to write your own drivers for the
"On-Chip" peripherals. Well RETARDS like us dont reinvent the WHEEL.
Maybe SMARTIEs like you do ... :-) . Probably you should re-write the
linux kernel.

    In fact if you put in all the components that a reference design
has, you would end up getting astronomical BOM's (Bill of Material),
which i guess RETARDS like us would'nt like to do.We have very good
customers and we would not like to loose them.

  If montavista has paid you or sumthing i would not be suprised ,
looking at your Adrenalin levels,  looks like you need some serious
counselling.

    Well RETARD or not i aint STUPID like you to comment on things
that i dont know about.

Cheers and Have a great day,

.Bharath.

PS:  Watch your language before you mouth ..... this mail could have
been worse. You are always welcome to take this offline maybe we
RETARDS could teach you some quality Ethical Kernel Hacking.

Hi All, 

I have three network interface on my board. I am try to use

1) eth0 --internal network connected to my PC..
2) eth1 --external network connected to LAN with 192.168.0.0/24 and
gateway 192.168.1.1 
3) eth2 --external network connected to LAN with 192.168.200.0/24 and
gateway 192.168.200.1

Incoming traffic through eth0 should use either eth1 or eth2 as gatway
to net.

I want to setup the route table in my board in such a way that if any of
the link eth1 and eth2 is down, traffic should be able to switch between
eth1, eth2 depending upon which is up or down!

I have port "ip" command utility to my board, but not sure how to use
this to configure route table!

Let me know your views!  

Regards
Raja

IITM's ftp site is now loading.
I am able to see it from outside the campus.
It has the FC4 isos.
So, somebody inside  the campus can help pple with getting FC4 cds.

I would suggest grabbing the set of restricted packages*  from Livna 
repository available from   http://rpm.livna.org/fedora/4/  and putting 
it a independant CD if you are redistributing Fedora for end users

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] procmail recipe for removing signatures.
Message-ID: <20050628093253.GA3481@light.energy>

I thought some people might be interested in this. I subscribe to a
few mailing lists, and as you all know, mailman and other list
managers generally add a customized closing remark with unsubscribe
info etc. at the end. For SF.net lists, an ad is also added.

I have, therefore, come up with the following procmail recipe. It has
helped reduce the size of the messaged stored and replies are made
easier, as there is less to delete. It also takes care not to delete
the senders signature.

# For ilugc
:0 f:
* ^TO_ilugc
| sed -n '/_______________________________________________/ { N; /^__*\nTo\ unsubscribe, email ilugc/q}; p'


A similar recipe to remove the ads and custom info on SF.net lists
like Linux-India-Help:

# For linux-india-help
:0 f:
* ^TO_linux-india-help
| sed -n '/^-------------------------------------------------------/ { N; /^--*\nSF.Net email is sponsored by:/q}; p'


You might want to add these to your procmailrc. However, do check that
they don't remove some necessary data! They work for me, but YMMV.

Hope this was useful.

Kumar

Subject: [Ilugc] FC4 sha1sum error
Message-ID: <495e45120506280715749ebce6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am using FC3. I am using bittorrent to downoad fc4 iso images. I
have completed download of 1full CD iso, and 350 on the 2nd CD only to
know that the download has gone wrong somewhere. I tried sha1sum on
the first iso and it reported as

$ sha1sum ./Desktop/stentz-binary-i386/FC4-i386-disc1.iso
d0f6ce1e4dde5d25db5500ee7271f4e418ecf877
./Desktop/stentz-binary-i386/FC4-i386-disc1.iso

Which obiviously dosebn't match with the sha1sum publiushed at the
fedora.redhat.com site which says the sum to be FC4-i386-disc1.iso
(sha1sum: 3fb2924c8fb8098dbc8260f69824e9c437d28c68)
But the file size matches

[ashwin@localhost stentz-binary-i386]$ ls -l
total 1086772
-rw-rw-r--  1 ashwin ashwin 665434112 Jun 24 13:23 FC4-i386-disc1.iso

-rw-rw-r--  1 ashwin ashwin         0 Jun 19 19:43 FC4-i386-rescuecd.iso
-rw-rw-r--  1 ashwin ashwin         0 Jun 19 19:43 SHA1SUM

the file size as reported in the official download server is :
[ ] FC4-i386-disc1.iso 06-Jun-2005 22:54 635M 

(the difference , as u might hav known, is because of conversion from
Bytes to MB)

Now the question is how do i verfiy the packets as they arrive before
the are downloaded. So that i don't have to wait for several hours to
download a iso only to find its has to send to the trash.

with regards,
ashwin

You dont have to trash it. You can run a rsync the ISO images with any 
of the mirrors [1] that provide this capability and fix it.   For 
downloads, I would recommend bittorrent [2]which checks and redownloads 
the bits often during the download so you dont end up with a broken ISO 
at the end. It also works on a peer to peer basis which speeds up the 
data transfer much better than a http/ftp especially at release time.

Rahul

planned to start in the last week of july and full of august and the

No. I use the Intel 865 GBF motherboard. Does that qualify for new?

Mammon cowered in horror.

Depends, what's the kernel you are using? These are common and can be
ignored until some of your peripherals stop functioning as would be
expected out of them.

I have some suggestions. When conducting something like this for
multiple days., we often plan with the idea that a group of audience
will visit every day. But that wont be so. Many people who come there
come in curiosity to know what it is about. Many of them wont even be
people interested in technology/social issues/*. So, no matter on what
day they come., they should get their introduction to F/OSS.

So, it would be nice to have atleast a minimum set of stalls,
information talks/centres, screening of movie (revolution os / the code)
and such all the days. Each day may have some talk or special event as
additional for people who have been coming daily., or wish to come
daily.

Good that you have made a start.

It will be better if we could discuss this when we
meet (on July 9) rather than keep sending e-mails to
and fro? 

It would be nice for everyone to look at the venue
place before we plan our events, whether it is a big
hall or a set of classroom environments.

It is 90 minutes.

1. We shall see the place first (if not already seen).

2. We can make a list of volunteers.
3. We can then decide on the topics. 

We want to address the public, so it shouldn't be
hardcore technical stuff. 

4. Assign topics to volunteers and events.

We have to _make_ sure we advertise in the papers, and
to colleges, schools. Maybe we should have an A&M
(Advertising & Marketing) team :)

Just my thoughts,

SK

Thanks for you offer
I am willing for this session.

Instead of mere talk, we can additionally have 
1. Freeduc CD- A customised Knoppix for educational purposes-demo
2. Linux with Tamil enabled - demo.
3. Since Linux is introduced in Plus 1 syllabus we can cover
   some portions.[We can have separate sessions for teachers if req]
4. Do a live install.

You can call students and teachers in-around for this.

It is better to be pro-freedom.

Fuctionality should be exactly the same however the UI would be 
different in Windows, Linux and OS X especially the default theme and 
preferences setup.  You can have a UI  design strategy for  a 
multiplatform application in two distinct ways. One would be to have the 
same UI regardless of the platform. Another one would be to adopt the OS 
guidelines so that it doesnt look alien in the non-primary systems. 
Firefox does that latter.

There is no single tool that can do this (I googled for this). But I
overcame with this by writing a Java program (which gets the info from
pppstats) and writes it into a access db (which is a part of down2home
- a similar tool in windows). By querying the db i am able to get the
info  about how much packets are send.

Hello

i generally dont use pop/imap clients. are there any email clients out
there which organise messages as conversation akin to gmail's web
interface? I find that very very useful (READ addicted). Now that the
"Age of the Lynx" has dawn (bad bad BSNL for not extending the
unlimited downloads offer :p), perhaps imap mail will reduce the
downloads even further

Thanx

not really like gmail's web interface in terms of threading, but opera 
M2 (part of the opera browser www.opera.com) does this for you - same 
concept of labels instead of folders

thunderbird does imap and threading but is more conventional ..

Hi everyone,

I have a web application say abc.z. 
There is no CLI as it is purely a web based application.
How do I connect to a web based application from CLI (Unix).
Do I need to create scripts in order to acheive this?

Thanks,

Please define  "connect to a". Does  your CLI app  want to produce/use
the same output as that of the Web App?  

Ideally, both your web app and the  CLI app should use an API that can
be wrapped over without much difficulty.

But if that is not the case, then you could use a CLI web browser like
lynx:

lynx -dump http://www.yahoo.com/

See above, play with it and go figure :)

one more small suggestion. each member from ilugc can order for 10
Ubuntu linux CDs from the shipit.ubuntulinux.org and thereby collect
some around 200-300 Ubuntu linux CDs for free Distribution.

is this suggestion is good?

well yes , but they are asking for customs duty.. anyway i got some 15
