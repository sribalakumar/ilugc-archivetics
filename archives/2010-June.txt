Subject: [Ilugc] Require help in configuring SMTP in zimbra mail server.
Message-ID: <16180.96320.qm@web114018.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

My name is kannan.

In my work place we are having mail distribution server (locally mail id's and passwords created in this server) and we are having a catch all box in mumbai. every 15 min our local server fetch the mail and redistribute the mails locally.

We are using zimbra server. To fetch the mails we are using our catchall box ip and for sending mails it will go directly from our local mail server using Airtel static ip. 

We are having multiple domains in the same server most of them are hosted with the same service provider(softcell) and the ip's are the same.

My query is that at present my static ip is blocked by RBL sites. Now i want to use my isp (softcell / catch all box) smtp ip. is it possible if yes can you please help for the same.

And MY isp (softcell) is using SMTP port is 2525.

Kindly do the needful

Thanks in advance. 
 
 

 
YOUR'S 

KANNAN.A.K.

In your setup, it is best to use your Email Service Provider's SMTP
server as the "outgoing" host.  Otherwise, you will be constantly
fighting RBL list providers to unblock your IP.  Furthermore, assuming
that your IP is not blocked, some sites like AOL (IIRC) will not
accept emails unless the MX record and PTR  record (for the MX host)
match.

You have not mentioned which program you are using for your MTA
(sendmail, qmail, postfix, exim to name a few).    Each of them can be
configured to send outgoing message via "smart smtp host" which would
be your providers SMTP host.   Make sure your provider will allow
relay before attempting the changes in your settings o/w you will
going around in a circle.

Subject: [Ilugc] Best way to access an xml from shell
Message-ID: <1275376735.3022.323.camel@sivakumar-laptop>

Hi,

Can you suggest me the best option to parse an xml from shell ?

Here is some history on why I need this. I have a installer where I use
yum/zypper for downloading(just download) the packages to be installed
along with its dependencies. I have encountered situations where the
downloads at times fail due to network outages and it is not captured by
the package managers. Both yum/zypper use the same infrastructure at the
server end and the client downloads the header file (primary.xml.gz)
from the server and uses it for its dependency mapping. primary.xml.gz
has the checksum info of the files being downloaded. The above request
is to read this xml file to get the checksum value which can be
validated with the downloaded file.

Rgds,
Siva.

I should have checked before replying.
Some examples in perl and awk are shown here on how to work with xml
files http://www.issociate.de/board/post/265610/Parse_an_XML_File_using_Shell_script.html
Before that you could use something like

2. Python -> http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/module-zlib.html

What he wants to do is match the checksum of the downloaded file with

Thanks for these options.

Later today I realized that there is also a sqlite db for the yum/zypper
repo which resides in the client end. Hence I had taken the below
approach.

sqlite3 /var/cache/yum/<reponame>/primary.xml.gz.sqlite 'select pkgId
from packages where location_href like "%ZSI-1.7-2.el5.mdsc.i386.rpm"'

I had also come across xmllint, xmlproc_parse might have also solved my
need.

well the reception from the students side was little but due to certain
causes in my case. i work at tiruchendur and have students mostly from the
tamil medium stream. they try to listen up but once they feel they dont
understand it, they lose interest in it. but as usual there are students who
come  regularly asking me for more videos. now i concentrate more on them so
that they can easily spread it among their students rather than a staff can

i hope you should make ur friends and class mate look into it first. just
tell them something you have learnt additionally from those videos, and
peoples interest may be be tuned towards it. getting it through the staff
will be tougher. because in most colleges the staff have restriction about
what medium to use for teaching. so try it from ur friends

Message-ID: <AANLkTimkbAhf1uT628uW3t1bfd3qmB9tchWyAXDeU9SK@mail.gmail.com>

Finally, I got a tool with which I can manage the messages, contacts & files
in my N95 with Ubuntu.

This tool<http://series60-remote.sourceforge.net/index.php?module=Content&func=view&pid=7&lang=en>is
simply awesome and available for Debian, Fedora, Windows & MacOS. It's
based on Python and needs a
client<http://series60-remote.sourceforge.net/counter/getfile.php?id=24>to
be installed in your mobile. You need to install
PyS60 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pys60/files/pys60/> as well on your
mobile. I used PythonForS60_1_4_5_3rdEd.sis for my N95 8GB since that was
the latest available release. It uses sqlite or MySql in the backend for
storing messages/contacts etc.

Apart from these, I had to install obexftp & python-obexftp [both available
in Synaptic] as well.

Once all the required software are installed in your PC & in your mobile,
you should initiate a bluetooth pairing between PC and Mobile and then open
S60-remote in your mobile. I guess only bluetooth connectivity works as of
now and you can not use USB mode yet. The client needs to be running all the
time so you can not close it in your mobile but minimize it by pressing Menu
key.

Then, open up Applications -> Internet -> Series60-Remote in your Ubuntu.

The application will list all available bluetooth devices.

Select your mobile from the list and click Next.

Application will ask if you want to push the client and PyS60 to your mobile
if not done already. Ignore that and click next since we have them installed
already.

After couple of screenshots explaining how to use the mobile client,
application will connect to the phone and Ta-Da!

You'll see the phone is connected to the PC and it shows the battery and
signal level of your phone.

>From the left panel you can create a new message, manage contacts & files,
see device information etc.

To see existing messages, you need to select 'View history' from Messages
menu.

Once a new message come in to your mobile, the Series60-Remote in your
Ubuntu will show a popup, just like a gtalk or skype chat popup, and ask if
you want to continue as chat.

The app seems pretty neat, simple, fast and does a wonderful job.
Unfortunately, this is available only for Symbian60 mobiles though! But
still, great work by the developer.

So, those who have Symbian & using Ubuntu/Fedora/Mac or those who are not
happy with the super slow message management in Ovi Suite, this app is
exactly for you guys - GO FOR IT.


Cheers,
Jeeva

I use wammu (aptitude install wammu) for all my sms-from-comp needs.
It also syncs up all your other stuff (contacts, todos, etc)

Yuvi,

Wammu doesn't require you to install anything on your phone. And yes,
you can do management too :)

hi, 

I have been invited by one of the more pro-active engineering and 
manufacturing associations of the country to present a paper on the role of 
open source in helping our country compete with the best in the world. This is 
a great opportunity, because normally hard core manufacturers and 
industrialists have no exposure to such things. I do not have too much 
experience in these areas and request everyone to give inputs on this so I 
could make a dent in this sector.

I'd personally interpret Linux as GNU/Linux; especially when they say
"Linux operating system".

The answer would be: not to the best of my knowledge.

I'm sorry for posting this link at all. I actually thought several
times if someone would raise an objection about this, but then guessed
that it has at least some relevance and interest to the list.

Sorry, list members, for the noise; I shall take more care in posting
links and wording my e-mails next time.

That would make no sense whatsoever. A typical Linux distribution is a
combination of Linux kernel, GNU tools and others.  However Android
avoids GPL as much as possible in user space.  When Google open source's
something, their preferred license is Apache and Android user space is
mostly that way as well.  Android is a *very* different from any other
Linux based system.    Chrome - we don't know the details yet.

the link has relevance and interest to the list - it has been posted by many 
people on most of the LUG lists in the country. What I took exception to is 
the idea that by constantly renaming things, one can change their nature. Let 
us face facts - the GNU project did not write the linux kernel, and no amount 
of name changing is going to change that fact.

I am not a fan of the name but that's a weak argument IMO

http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html

There is a reason FSF calls the combination GNU/Linux rather than GNU
Linux.    My argument is there is no GNU/Linux operating system either. 
We have distributions which are essentially Linux based operating
systems that share source code and they have their own names.

Then we should also call debian as GNU/Debian , ubuntu as GNU/Ubuntu
according to you. But we are calling Debian as Debian GNU/Linux etc.

My two cents - please post a comment on the authors of the  article or

The advice from the experts is that you should not do the disable.
My problem is when the user clicks refresh or alt+ or back the time gets
reset to the beginning.
Pl. advice.

Wonderful application and has a lot of nice features. :). My favorite
is the chat facility over SMS, which is seldom provided in N series
phones. After frustration with gnokii and wammu, this application is a
great relief :). Thanks for sharing :)

Good that you did your homework :-)

Very true.

What you can do is open up a new window without the toolbar. This way,
the most obvious way of clicking the refresh button or the backbutton
will be out of reach.

The user can still do a Ctl+R, F5 or Alt+Left key strokes. You will
not be able to control it, and even if you do control it, it will not
be foolproof. there will always be a way to circumvent it.

The first step in achiving this is put up a huge banner which says
that the test will become invalid if the user tries to refresh or go
to previous page. Then, hold a random number in the "user session" as
well as in a  hidden field. keep checking this variable and make sure
that it is the latest. If the user tries to do a back button or
refresh, the numbers won't match and you can tell him that he has just
did the wrong thing and failed the exam :(. Or, if you have coded it
smartly, you can go back to the previous question.

basically RMS was miffed that he could not write a kernel and linus did - so he 
wanted a share of the credit. So he demanded that the word 'GNU' be added. But 
for those who do not know the history, the word 'GNU/Linux' implies ownership 
of linux by GNU. This also could be fair enough (although rather childish) as 
long as Linus agreed to it - he did not.

anyway, for any usable distro one needs not only GNU, but also BSD - like 
fedora would be junk without python - apache (httpd, subversion, etc etc) , 
MIT licensed stuff and about 30-40 other licenses. So would it make sense to 
call it GNU/BSD/APACHE/MIT/Linux? Everyone wants credit no?

oops, python, git et all are all written in GCC - so let us give them the 
credit - GNU/Python, GNU/Git ...

I find your reasoning very interesting KG.

Stallman is loved like crazy in the OpenBSD circles for his
sacrificial mindset and
  an overtly self effacing nature. ;)

Long ago there was a very friendly chat between Theo and Stallman. The
mailing list
was big fun then.

Nowadays we have to resort to some Tamizh serial instead for entertainment.

I have seen old men who get litigous because they have energy; not the
wisdom to
pursue God and not the intellect to pursue science; and most do not have enough
responsibility at home or work to serve society either.

So they take to what gives them some belongingness.

I think Stallman retired long ago from coding; he wrote gcc, gdb,
emacs and a whole
bunch of great stuff. Since then he has been evangelizing.

In fact even in Hinduism you find that the truly religious don't go
around preaching like
 Ravishankar...

Hi everyone,

I apologize for the cross-posting. I read this really interesting piece
about some women in rural Bangladesh on the DevChix list :
http://southasia.oneworld.net/fromthegrassroots/info-ladies-make-life-easier-in-bangladesh/.
They bring information and "answers" to questions ranging from health care
to pesticides to family planning, to villages in Bangladesh on netbooks, and
travel to villages systematically on their bicycles. To the impoverished (in
more ways than one - think "information") villagers, they're superheroes and
lifesavers.

I wish we had more such programs like these in India. I think I know what I
can do when am back there. Using FOSS for such a program in India would be
fantastic. Just thought it was worth sharing!

Cheers,
KD.

Uplifting story of the day: In rural Bangladesh, where most are plagued by
poverty and natural disasters, information is a life-saver. These women who
bike to rural villages, bringing information in a netbook, are pretty much
superheroes.

That's why using FOSS for something like that in India would be a great
idea! Maybe, I should have added OT in the header. My bad.

Using FOSS for initiatives such as this and "Teach for India" would be
awesome, IMO.

THAT IS NOT EXACTLY THE REASON FOR THE NAMING BEHIND GNU/Linux. I suggest
you people to see the film "Revolution OS" , or read some good books on the
history of free software.He wanted to call linux systems GNU/Linux because
linux is only a kernel and is not a complete operating system. A complete os
is a bundle of kernel and userland tools which is developed by GNU project.
Therefore he wants to call these combination GNU/Linux there is NOTHING
WRONG in people taking credit for their own work. Basically he wanted people
to take a look at why they took the pain to develop GNU and think about the
issues affecting software users and strive for freedom.
Debian infact has an OS flavour consists of BSD kernel and GNU userland
tools called GNU/BSD , there is also a port of linux kernel to bsd operating
system called BSD/Linux. Also there is combination of GNU and solaris kernel
called Debian GNU/solaris

Friends.

You all are welcome to open a new thread on how to call a
linux kernel based operating system, rather than hijacking this thread.

Discussions will be interesting, when they are relevant to the subject
of a thread.

Thanks for understanding.

@shrini
Is this your first mod msg ? ( nice)

BTW on topic  when will google video/audio be working out of the box
on GNU/Linux ?  Also will picasa or google earth be running on as
native applications ?

Google will now be using windows on VM  will they still be using
picasa on wine LOL

Also note that Google earth,picasa and google talk are all propreitary
and google has no plans to open source them .  I would rather
recommend Marble(with openstreetmaps) ,Gwenview(supports picasaweb,
flickr upload) and empathy !

Message-ID: <201006041658.42120.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

I have a server mainly using nginx. Recently a requirement to run php/cgi has 
come up. Looking at nginx documentation I find no native support for php/cgi 
and rather than do anything fancy decided to proxy to apache. So I installed 
php5 for apache (apt-get php5) and mods-enabled shows php5.conf and php5.load. 
Here is the contents of the two files:
load:

<IfModule mod_php5.c>
  AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml .php3
  AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
</IfModule>

and conf:

LoadModule php5_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so

but when the browser is pointed to a php file, a file open or download dialog 
comes up. What am I missing?

I got cgi to work without problems

If you're trying to use it with 'userdir' module, in the recent
versions, it is by default disabled for the user's public_html
directories because then the users could run arbitrary PHP scripts as
www-data user. In that case you may need to enable it in the module's
configuration file. Also a look into apache's logs might give a better
clue as to why the php script is not getting executed by mod-php.

that is all RMS's viewpoint. Why does everyone give so much weight to him and 
none at all to Linus (who not only wrote and maintained the kernel all these 
years, but also has come up with another killer app in git - how many people 
can you point to who have come up with *two* killer apps in a lifetime?). And 
yet I am still to see one post or person on this list in any way either trying 
to understand linus's viewpoint or propagate it. Why? 

 Anyway, RMS summarises his views in this article: 
http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html

to put it shortly, RMS and company thought of writing a kernel long before 
linus did - but could not (in fact they have been trying to do so for nearly 
30 years now but have utterly failed). Linus wrote it. So GNU people say 'we 
thought of it first so we want our share of credit'. No problem. But in our 
world the person who first implements anything gets the main credit and usually 
gets to name the outcome. Others cannot force a name on it. If Linus had 
agreed, no one would have any problem. He did not agree. So to foist the name 
and even refuse to talk to anyone who does not use the name as foisted is the 
height of childishness and is tantamount to petty jealousy. In the article 
mentioned above, there is a very amusing paragraph:

<quote>
If we tried to measure the GNU Project's contribution in this way, what would 
we conclude? One CD-ROM vendor found that in their ?Linux distribution?, GNU 
software was the largest single contingent, around 28% of the total source 
code, and this included some of the essential major components without which 
there could be no system. Linux itself was about 3%. (The proportions in 2008 
are similar: in the ?main? repository of gNewSense, Linux is 1.5% and GNU 
packages are 15%.) So if you were going to pick a name for the system based on 
who wrote the programs in the system, the most appropriate single choice would 
be ?GNU?.
</quote>

linux is only 1.5%!! might as well remove it (and certainly with only a 1.5% 
share it has no right to find itself in any part of the name!) But the most 
important point is that linux and GNU combined are only 16.5% - a small 
minority. What about giving credit to the people who contributed the remaining 
83.5%? why are they ignored? who are they? why are their leaders not crying 
for credit in the name? one possible reason is that they are not jobless and 
are busy refining and adding to their contributions ;-)

let us look at it from another angle - what would have happened if Linus had 
not developed the kernel (it is known that he just did it for kicks and not 
part of the great scheme of freedom framed by RMS). Then GNU would have been 
useless and we would all still be using windows. ILUGC would not have come 
into existence - without a kernel GNU tools are of no use (and GNU people have 
proved that they are incapable of writing a usable kernel). So if anything 
Linus would be justified in insisting that GNU be called Linux/GNU. And do not 
forget that it is only because of the success of linux that RMS, GPL and GNU 
became famous. Without linux no one would have heard of them. 

No doubt RMS is a visionary - a good thing. We need visions - but if he cannot 
implement his visions he has no right to grab credit from those who can 
implement them. Case to point: he was the first to conceive of a free 
encyclopedia (he called it GNE - GNE is not an encyopedia). It was a failure - 
Wales implemented the wikipedia which was a success. No doubt RMS would have 
like to call it the GNE/wikipedia - but it won't work because it is an URL and 
if you type GNE/Wikipedia in the address bar you will not get wikipedia. He 
also had visions of a DVCS - but GNU Arch was another flop - whereas linus 
quietly produced git without any fanfare.

We owe a tremendous debt to Linus - and it is fitting that the OS is named 
after him (he did not name it). We also owe something to RMS and his friends - 
there are lots of things named after GNU - more than enough to keep any 
reasonable person happy. But this kind of renaming is not reasonable. I 
request those of us here who have benefited from the work of Linus Torwalds to 
take some time out and also find out his views on the matter and respect them. 
Or if you really want to further the cause of GNU, please make hurd usable and 
use arch for version control.

a LAMP workshop at MIT tomorrow. I pinged Ravi Jaya, whose name was on

The key difference is that the GNU toolchain was used to build almost
all the remaining xx% and even today I am sure the toolchain which RMS
was instrumental in building is used to generate majority of the
content in a distro.

And that list of things built using the GNU toolchain includes the kernel.

Whether that justifies calling it GNU/Linux is a personal choice IMO.

KG's well written note tends to suggest that RMS wants credit and
thats the only reason--I see that insistence more as a continued
reminder of the principles he has espoused, in contrast to the
pragmatic(?) stance of Linus.

it is my personal opinion that he wants credit (although he himself keeps 
harping on the fact that he needs credit), but the main thrust of my argument 
is that Linus is entitled to decide - not RMS. After all Linus has given full 
credit to the GNU team - even to the extent that he has licensed the kernel 
under the GPL - and afaik has also licensed git under that. What more do you 
want?

ps. from the git faq:
<quote>
Why the 'git' name?

Quoting Linus: "I'm an egotistical ***, and I name all my projects after 
myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'".

('git' is British slang for "pig headed, think they are always correct, 
argumentative"). 
</quote>

maybe he should have named it RMS?

The credit goes to Welkin and his enthusiastic team of volunteers from AVIT.

Not to forget the huge support from Bhaskar. They did a fantastic job.

Thanks to all those who made this event a great success!!
I'd love to hear comments from those who are attending this event.

Linus is fully entitled to name the kernel,  Linux.  Noone is trying to
challenge that.  How the operating system should be called is the
subject of debate.

Message-ID: <1275664431.3362.9.camel@indimail.org>

I migrated to FC13 from FC12 yesterday. I had my script in /etc/event.d.
The script worked without any issues on FC9, FC10, FC11 and FC12.

On FC13, my job no longer gets automatically started after reboot.

I understand that /etc/event.d is obsolete and one has to have the
script in /etc/init with the extension '.conf'. I have done that but
my job does not get started automatically.

As of the moment, i am starting the service manually by issuing the
following command

/sbin/initctl start svscan

or 

/sbin/initctl emit qmailstart

My script as below. Is there anything wrong with my script?

% cat svscan.conf 
# svscan - runlevel compatibility
# Start deamontools watcher
# console output, owner, none
# to start - initctl emit qmailstart
# to stop  - initctl emit qmailstop
# start svscan
# stop  svscan

start on runlevel [345]
start on qmailstart

stop on runlevel [0126]
stop on runlevel r
stop on qmailstop

console none
respawn

@ Yuvi Panda, if really interested in the 'LAMP', then we can plan it one in
this month end.
since I can't make it tomorrow.

But you should assure you would get minimum 15 to 20 participants.  Let we

By that logic, (to pick one), no Moore, so no Intel, so no Linux, right?
Or, no Minix, then no Linux, right?

@ Yuvi Panda, if really interested in the 'LAMP', then we can plan it one in
this month end.
since I can't make it tomorrow.

But you should assure you would get minimum 15 to 20 participants.  Let we
talk to KG, if we can get the same
venue it would be great.

basically if 15 % belongs to GNU, then we must say GNU rather then following
to 1.5%
If GNU is not eligible term in your POV then Linux is also  not a eligible
term.
better always use like

Fedora is a GNU/Linux based Operating System.

'Linux Operating System' is a confusing term and must be avoided.

BOSS is handled by NRC-FOSS - C-DAC. Commercial is part of their agenda.

While I wouldn't really wish BOSS Linux on anyone and I am not a fan of
the entire initiative, I would hope that advertising on these mediums
increases awareness of Linux and FOSS in general and it is very much
welcome IMO to engage in commercial activities if it serves that
purpose.  As this is a government sponsored initiative, my concern is
for my tax money to be used in a effective way to improve the life of
the people in this country and if by deploying FOSS we can accelerate
the process, then it is money well spend.

I have seen the BOSS Linux ad on other regional channels too, but the
problem is they advertise it as Linux and not BOSS or atleast "BOSS
Linux" , it reads as "so and so program is sponsored by Linux, Rexona,
Clinic Plus .... etc etc "
not good.

+1. They can do (and have done) much worse with that money, so it's a 
consolation, I guess :)

wrong - you are under the mistaken impression that the GNU project has 
developed and maintains the GNU toolchain. That is not correct. Many 
individuals have done and are doing this - the only thing is that some of them 
use the 'GNU' word. In fact, if I am not mistaken, Redhat maintains and 
develops a good part of it. So without RMS and without GNU, the toolchain 
would still exist and linux would still flourish. As far as I can see, those 
projects that are directly developed and maintained by the GNU project do not 
work properly and are mostly useless - like hurd.

why not remove the 1.5% that is linux? that way the percentage of GNU will go 
up and you can call it 'GNU'. After all removing 1.5% of the distro will not 
seriously harm it.

It is pretty much impossible to explain Linux or FOSS within a few
seconds of advertising and if you try to conceptualize it, you will end
up with something like the IBM Linux super bowl ad.  Just in case you
haven't seen that, take a look at 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwL0G9wK8j4

I am not sure that is very effective.   Although it is a not a TV ad,
Red Hat's series of films
(http://www.redhat.com/videos/opensource/films.html) including Truth
Happens are quite popular and always evoke a great response.  End users
don't care about Linux or Windows or whatever.  That is a implementation
detail that people with a fascination for technology talk attach
themselves to and that is always going be a very tiny minority. 
Consumers care about specific products if it makes a difference in their
lives.  People care about their iPod's because it plays their music. 
They don't care the operating system it runs or the format of the
music.   So effectively,  if at all you see TV ads or ads via any medium
with "Linux" in it, it is guaranteed to be associated with a
(commercial) product.  Be it BOSS Linux or IBM on demand services or Red
Hat or Novell etc. 

We shouldn't be lamenting about it because regardless of the specific
product being advertised, it raises the profile of Linux on the whole. 
When I originally started out with Linux,  when I mention it in
bookstores or something, they would try and correct me and ask if I was
talking about UNIX.  That problem went away years back and that is a
positive step.  I think these ads might help regardless of whether BOSS
Linux itself succeeds in the market place or not.   In short, a rising
tide lifts all boats.

Yes,  Red Hat does maintain or contribute significantly to several GNU
projects including coreutils,  Glibc, GCC etc and while I understand
your point, you seem to make a false distinction between directly and
indirectly maintained projects from GNU.  GNU is a umbrella effort of
the FSF to create a completely free software environment and there is
participation from volunteers and multiple organizations,  commercial
and otherwise.  FSF doesn't employ anyone to directly to work on any of
the GNU projects anymore although they did in the past.  Some of the GNU
projects are more successful than others but that is hardly remarkable.

I am in complete agreement with you. The reality is that every component of 
the linux os is maintained and developed by some one or the other. Some do it 
under their own banner, others do it under other banners. FSF has always had a 
drive to enroll developers under it's banner and get them to add 'GNU' to the 
name and license the software under the GPL and also assign the copyright to 
the FSF. Fair enough. Unfortunately there are some people who think that if a 
piece of software has the word 'GNU' in it, then it means that the GNU project 
has developed and is maintaining that software. This is as silly as saying 
that any software maintained and developed on sourceforge is maintained and 
developed by sourceforge. I also agree that in the early days, support of an 
umbrella organisation like GNU could have given some benefits of help and 
protection to the authors of the software. But that was 25-30 years ago. The 
situation is radically different now. Huge volumes of code, licensed under a 
plethora of licenses and hosted all over the place have been produced. All 
without the 'protection' of the GNU project. 

Also I find that apart from RMS, no developer is really bothered about the name 
and banner under which the software he is developing is. If one joins any 
project, or contributes to one, one accepts whatever name is there. Sometimes 
in the case of a fork or in case of disagreement, there may be a name change - 
but this is rare. 

What I am fighting against is the idea that 'without GNU toolchain there would 
have been no linux'. The people who developed the components of the toolchain 
would still have developed them - they would have named it something else. 
That is all.

While that is also true, most end users are not dumb either, so if we 
can sell them the concept of Linux in a simple manner, they will 
understand it. People don't exactly know what "Intel Inside" means, but 
they know it stands for a proven piece of technology that runs their PCs.

If we can convey to people that Linux is free, open and secure and why 
they should care about it in a simple manner, I think even end-users 
respond to that. It's quite similar to why some people pay more to get 
greener cars: if they know the benefit, they'll go the extra mile. But I 
agree with your larger point though - if somebody is going to have to 
pay for educating consumers on a massive scale, a commercial entity that 
aligns with those interests is one of the more viable options.

1. Are you using mod_userdir? As guruprasad said, php is disabled in
user's DocumentRoot
2. Since you haven't mentioned it anywhere I'll ask this. Have you
reloaded/restarted apache after installing and configuring mod_php?

I put it in php5.conf in mods-enabled. Some progress - still a blank page, but 
I think that is the mistake of the guy who wrote the code

You need to add the path to ~/apps to the environment variable PATH in ~/.bashrc

this is a virtual host - and anyway I do not see any mod_userdir in mods-
enabled - it is there in mods-available

no - apparently there is no mysql database driver and so a fatal error is

Yes, I totally agree with Rahul..
    We need to under that it was "Free software movement" and not "Free
software project".
    Person who put tarch-light at starting point and visioned the things is
more important the followers and implementors. For the very same reason,
person who make a open standard specification is more important then open
source coder. For the very same reason, CEO who vision a technology is more
important then his employee. We put huge credit to Gandhi for Freedom Fight
but it doesn't exclude contribution to other.
     Finally, we have Linus's Kernel with such a wide spread, just because
of GPL license. RMS was the one who wrote it and put some rule which define
software freedom. He RMS was not there, then there was no license. without
Public license, Linux will be another Window.

0) Was that totally unselfish? A non GPL compatible license couldn't
have used the GNU OS tools anyway.

Tolvards has given us a really good kernel. Agreed. But

1) The Linux kernel is not really very advanced. It just does things
right.  Which is good for most purposes. If Stallman were to hack
together a monolithic kernel at that point of time, his group would
have achieved it. They wanted to get a real microkernel running. I
agree HURD is a failed effort even though some people are trying to
resuscitate it with Viengoos(Spelt right?) and Coyotos.

2) I think I am going to get flamed for this. But *a lot* of non-Linux
Free Operating System users (Read BSD or OSol) feel that Linux has
received undue credit because of heavy corporate backing and power
plays by organizations with deep pockets. I am not saying it is evil,
but Linux has not grown by itself. If the companies had been so
philanthrophic when the GNU OS was being developed, HURD
might have come out faster.

3) About the how many others have created "2 killer apps" question.
Look at Stallman's efforts
     a) gcc
     b) gdb
     c) *Emacs*

Thats atleast 3 killers. "Vi"zards can call it 2 killers :P

4) A few years ago, a few Debian users raised furore for Ubuntu did
not
    a) Mention Debian anywhere
    b) Did not give anything back to Debian

Now
    -> Ubuntu put in effort to make the distro usable by dummies. So,
can they claim that it was them who gave GNU/Linux a name and so it is
Debian that is living in their shadow and not the other way round?

After all this, I feel that the Linux distros will not lose too much ink
by adding the letters GNU/ in front.

*It is not a necessary thing. But it is most certainly very polite.*

Compile the kernel without gcc, debug without gdb and basically, don't use
the gnu toolchain.
Then call it linux os.
I'd say, we need to respect all those who contributed to the gnu "project"
and that can be done
by using its name in conjunction with linux.

> > > Tell me, What if there is no GNU, No RMS ? No Linux right?
The replies given to this state that he was not an active developer or
something.
Its not just the technical input that matters. Who would have thought of
something
as radical as the GPL and then who would have spurred the development of so
many free software
packages? Had the GPL been not there when Linus wrote the kernel, can you
imagine what would
have happened? I'd say it would have remained as just another student
project.

My 2 paise: I don't mind calling it Linux.

1) Practically, it doesn't make sense to call it GNU/Linux or for that
matter GNU/FreeBSD etc. It is awkward. Saying it Linux is easy - thats
all people want.

2) People want a Operating System to use, not the ideological baggage
around it. If a layman asks "why are you calling it GNU/Linux?", you
either end up saying "because RMS asked me to say so" that makes you
look less bright or you give a 5 minute instant biography of RMS and
his ideologies - that makes you boring (for the layman). Does the
layman really care what is meant by kernel and other stuff that makes
an OS? I don't think so.

3) RMS/FSF wants due credit for their work. I guess they have that
already. Just by forcing people to call it GNU/Linux won't help one
bit.


I just checked Fedora and openSUSE home pages, they call their distro
as a 'Linux-based' operating system. Thats 2 of the top 3 distros.

While we are at this topic, I wonder what people will say for Ubuntu.
IMO, the world as we know it, is slowly forgetting the word 'Linux'
(accept it or not, apart from RMS fanboys, nobody says GNU/Linux) and
moving to call it as 'Ubuntu'.

Checkout the home page of Ubuntu and search for the word 'linux' -
you'll be surprised.

I suggest that you use "photorec". It should be available in the repos of
Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch etc. I warn you - DO NOT write any data on to that
partition which contained the deleted files as the memory blocks may be
over-written. It only recovers the data. Although it detects file types, no
metadata is recovered. So, you'll lose the file names, tags in music files,
etc. Also, if you are hunting for videos, you'll have no seek. I think it is
because the metadata is used to store the video length. VLC media player can
be used to fix these broken video streams.

Sorry, it is "PhotoRec" and NOT "photorec". I had great success recovering

 Well, If you remove GNU from 'Linux', Eventually everyone will forget the
whole reason behind the development of the operating system.

It doesn't fit in the context of the discussion at all and I've
absolutely no clue how you think that these two are comparable. But
seriously - do you really think killing oneself is that easy?
apparently I did my market research and found out that it is not.

well yes. Try convincing a person who tried linux, said it sucks and
went back to windows just because it didn't play his/her pirated mp3
songs and avi movies off-the-shelf or because he/she couldn't play
their favorite video game, about freedom and RMS and his ideology and
why microsoft is evil.or just google for 'linux disadvantages' to come
to reality.

I find it very hard to convert a person to use linux as his/her host
OS. Mind you, they are really good developers. The  moment you say
that you need to type a command that goes like "sudo apt-get install
foo" - they just frown. They'll eventually get to know the terminal
and some may even end up liking linux, but the point to note is that
some like to change, some don't. And they DO appreciate linux as their
development environment, but it just doesn't fit their choice as a
desktop os.

That will be a whole different thread all together. linux desktop OS
share is a still scanty little 1%. (excluding millions of enterprise
linux servers)

Shouldn't our focus be on improving the UX of linux and reach out to
the masses? Will forcing people to call the OS as GNU/Linux address
this problem?

I believe we have a bigger problem to solve, Linux is still niche.
Meant for those who know code. RMS is god - emacs, FSF, GNU are his
legacy. Take a bow, but I don't think his childish behavior is helping
at all.

And why is it important that they *should* know the history of an OS?
Does Microsoft insist that whoever buys windows should know that the
first DOS was written by Bill Gates and his reason behind development
of OS --> A computer in every home.

See, Ubuntu is the most *user friendly* OS, IMO. They don't even
mention that their OS is based on Linux in their homepage. Few
iterations down the line, the won't even claim that they're a linux
distro.

Android, Chrome OS are based on Linux kernel (I guess google knew
which one is difficult to start from scratch)

Does Linus go around shouting foul about Ubuntu, Android, Chrome OS (yet)?

I rest my case.

It doesn't mean we can conveniently forget the ideological background.
Remember, it was the ideology that
spurred the development of the free OS. *Not the other way round*. The whole
thing was written
because people loved the ideology.

>3) RMS/FSF wants due credit for their work
I'd say we need to give due credit to the ideology. GNU project embodies the
ideology.
It embodies the spirit of freedom.

Creating a custom distro is so easy these days with Ubuntu & Fedora.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinUEFO1Q2wihgJb9lATDgsi5m48vP7uKdLTSVjo@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I have upgraded Ubunutu 10.04, a couple of days ago. The installation seemed
to go fine. However I can't log in: the login screen just seems to reset and
asks me for my password again.

It's not an authentication / incorrect password issue. If I stick in a wrong
password, I get "Authentication failure".

I've googled around, others report the same issue on the Ubuntu forums, but
there doesn't seem to be a fix. Does anyone know of a work around or what
the problem is?

Thanks

Actually there is really no good reason for NOT being able to compile
Linux using compilers other than GCC if it weren't for the fact that they
have used GCC extensions in the Linux code base.

There have been a number of compilers which have been used to compile
Linux before - IBM's C compiler, Intel C compiler, the new LLVM compilers
etc.

Actually, there are very good reasons to change the Linux code base to
allow other compilers apart from GCC - performance being one of them.

Take a look at the Linux DNA project:
http://www.linuxdna.com/

Also see this (they are claiming as much as 40% performance improvements
in parts of the kernel simply because of using Intel C compiler and an
average of 8-9% performance improvement throughout):
http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/linuxdna-supercharges-linux-intel-cc-compiler

There are other compilers besides GCC. Example: LLVM Clang which is BSD
licensed:
http://clang.llvm.org

Yes, if GCC wasn't around, it would have hampered Linus's attempts
considerably. But he may still have found a way - after all, GCC wasn't
the only free compiler in town even then. I don't think Tannenbaum used
the GNU tool chain to write Minix or Amoeba.

By the way, most GNU projects will compile quite happily using ICC. Even
the Linux kernel could conceivably be modified to NOT use GCC extensions -
thus allowing it to be easily compiled by other compilers.

Hi,

Just a word in sideways ...

Speculation is always limitless. I could argue that without the GPL, linux would 
not have grown while also remaining free (as in freedom define by the GPL) in 
the manner it has (see:OSX, Windows network stack ...etc).

The point of the matter is although RMS _is_ quite annoying in his insistence 
and almost fanatical in the naming aspect, it is credit to this very same 
stubbornness, that Free Software as we know it actually survived and grew.

Again speculation of whether this statement is true can go any ways, I only make 
that statement based on the creation of GNU Project, GPL and FSF. I can't 
imagine anyone but RMS being idealistic^Wstubborn enough to pull this off.

Whether in his absence someone else could have pulled it off is speculation. 
This is somewhat like your statement about the creation of the kernel, the 
person who created a free software license first(*) ought to get credit.

(*) just to ward off the pedants who are already frothing in the mouth, I am 
aware that GPL isn't the first free software license, but it is the first 'free 
software as defined by the 4 freedoms license' -- which ultimately *is* the 
reason why linux as well as a lot of software is as free as it is now. It 
probably is the only free software license that has been tested in court.

So, if on one hand it annoys you to call it GNU/Linux because it seems like 
attention/credit seeking behavior, don't just jump off to the other extreme and 
deny any credit whatsoever and dismiss the value of the contribution that has 
come out of the GNU camp (and particularly out of RMS !).

RMS might not be the nice guy you might expect him to be but please don't 
be-little his contributions. I'd say he has contributed to the FOSS cause in 
non-tech matters more than linus has through linux.

Call it Linux all you want but remember it /does/ mean
GNU/[Apache|BSD|...]/Linux with GNU being the most (philosophically and 
historically) important component.

cheers,

Many people advocate Free Software and GNU/Linux for its Freedom.
Getting maximum number of Linux users may not be the top priority for
some, but to teach people to value their Freedom. At the same time,
there are people who consider getting more market share for Free
Software is their ultimate goal, irrespective of whether the users
appreciate the Freedom or not. Depending on which side you are, you
can focus your efforts. Some of the disadvantages you highlight are
legal, except for the US, at least for now, there is nothing that
stops Free Software from being able to play mp3's of off-the-shelf
videos. This problem comes because US is a huge market, but there are
many distros that supports multimedia out of the box, like linux mint,
mandriva. Plus getting that fixed is not a big problem, but obviously
not easy for a new user.

If all you care is market share, go ahead and call it whatever you
like, the point of stressing GNU is to highlight the philosophy. There
are people already distributing GNU/Linux, without adding GNU or even
Linux to it. So asking to call it GNU/Linux is not to address this
problem. If you don't care about the philosophy, call it whatever you
want, like many others, problem solved.

That is your belief, there are people who share this and who don't
share this. So work with people who share your vision and cooperate
with others on matters which are shared - like patents, DRM or
whatever. But multiple visions/beliefs will continue their efforts to
influence the other.

Because unlike any other software GNU project was started for Freedom.
It taught the world to fight for it and built up a complete Operating
System which gives every user Freedom to use, learn, share, modify and
distribute. If you don't think it is not important you are Free to
call it Linux or Open Source or whatever you like. Many who already
does that.

It is not an accident that Ubuntu is user friendly. Years of hard work
is behind it.
If everyone was focusing on just the artwork or marketing, we wouldn't
have Ubuntu as we see it. Even now it the result of hard work many
distributions and up streams. If you think Ubuntu _alone_ made your
printer to work out of the box or have your system detect your hard
disk, or let you read and write disks formatted with Windows file
systems, or help you seamlessly work with Microsoft Office documents,
then you are not seeing the whole picture. It not same a single
company created Operating System. You may not care, many who may not
care either. Those who care would continue to push the ideas and
ideology that made all of this possible.

> Android, Chrome OS are based on Linux kernel (I guess google knew

> Does Linus go around shouting foul about Ubuntu, Android, Chrome OS (yet)?

Because Linus does not care. He has a different philosophy from RMS
and Free Software movement. Everyone is free to choose from whichever
philosophy they like or don't care about any philosophy at all.

GNU and Linux represents different philosophies and choosing a name
means you pick a side. It is fine that you pick a side which you are
comfortable with.

GNU philosophy gives most importance to Freedom of computer users, where as
Linux philosophy gives importance to best tool for the job. It is only
natural that some follow the GNU philosophy and some Linux philosophy
(Free Software and Open Source).

I feel comfortable with GNU philosophy and I call the system
GNU/Linux. If you feel comfortable with Linux philosophy go ahead and
call it Linux. Lets promote the operating system for our own reasons.

Quiet true. I have been able to tell people regarding Linux and its single
biggest merit when compared with Windows - 'security'. Even the n00bs
understand the relative non-virus nature of Linux.

Also, along similar lines, i was able to get a client of mine to convert to
Linux(webfaction) from Windows(hostgator). He understood the licensing part
the low cost associated with running of the servers and its maintenance.

what was the reason? as far as I know, most people who are behind the 
development did/do it for fun - because they enjoy doing it. I can not see any 
other reason for developing open source software.

who said so? people did/do it because they enjoy doing it - the guys with

IMO, the light/vision/implementations are more important than the person
from whose mind these things originate. Its understandable if these
visionaries fight/argue over bragging rights. But for proxies to indulge in
this is confounding!

Lets just raise a toast to the chef/chefs and enjoy the  pudding :-)

Also, IMO, there is no truth in arguments that claim that if person X did
not invent implement Y then the course of histroy would've changed. It is
the collective thought of the times that propel certain ideas to the
forefront. That people are associated with them is just a matter of detail.

Thats why we see many instances of simultaneous discoveries in many fields.
If Newton did not invent Calculus (if at all he did) Leibnitz was ready with
it. The only part history played here was to give Newton all the credit
discounting all the prior art of the Leibnitz, the orientals, hindus and the
arabs. And if Einstein did not give us the theory of relativity, Lorentz
would've done it.

To us, it does not matter. Its calculus and relativity that are more
important.

That is debatable. I stick by my assertion that the reason linux grew at the 
pace it did and yet continued to be free as opposed to being hijacked and 
^improved^ upon in a closed source manner is credit to the GPL.

If you want to use/modify/redistribute the code, you do so under the same terms 
that it was offered to you. It is not a choice. It is a /requirement/. So, while 
you may call this 'restrictive' of the "rights of it's users", I call it true 
participatory nature.

IMHO, linux grew faster and better than the BSDs because of this. IMHO, 
OpenSolaris has not gained the community participation that linux has because of 
this. IMHO, the reason there isn't an Apple/Sun/Novell/M$/Google OS based on the 
linux kernel which is 'oh-so-kickass-but-severely-user-right-restricting' 
because of this.

Everyone plays by the same rules so that everyone benefits.

Saying that the GPL is restrictive is saying that the linux kernel is 
restrictive to participation. That assertion is just ridiculous.

Yes:
http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/msg/2194d253268b0a1b?pli=1

Quote:
"""
ALERT! WARNING! NOTE! These sources still need minix-386 to be compiled
(and gcc-1.40, possibly 1.37.1, haven't tested), and you need minix to
set it up if you want to run it, so it is not yet a standalone system
for those of you without minix.

Note however, the other GNU project dependency I mentioned (ie: the GPL) came 
along much later ...and apparently was considered by linus as "definitely the 
best thing I ever did."

It doesn't have to be one or the other. Linus created linux because it was fun 
but he licensed it under the GPL, in fact *specifically* GPLv2, because he 
*deeply* cares about, understands and agrees with the ideology (note that 
agreeing/subscribing to an ideology != being a fanatic).

did you ever changed your root password?? As it is ubuntu root password has
to be set by the user.. ubuntu people donot provide root access by default.
if you had never changed it then you can change (or create) a new root
password by using current user name and password.
here is how you can:
1. login as current user
2. open terminal and issue following command:
$ sudo passwd root

the above command will ask for current user passwd so to authorize sudo
access then provide new password for root and confirm it..

i hope this had helped :)

but i cannot remember the root password

There is a small difference here.

The FSF (and rms) insist on the credit apparently because that would lead people 
to see, understand and appreciate the philosophy of free software.

Unlike pure science (and as a result most pure science discoveries) software 
does not happen in a open environment(*). FSF just wants to underline the 
importance of software advancement in the same vein as scientific advancement -- 
ie: the sharing of knowledge so that others may build on top of it.

So, I personally believe that putting a few words in about free software when 
talking about linux is not only nice but also necessary. That said, i still call 
the kernel linux and the OS whatever the distro is named. GNU/Linux ought to be 
a distro by the FSF.


cheers,

(*) I know that unfortunately that generalization about science is not really 
true, greed permeates science too where millions of dollars are spent in closed 
room research facilities without sharing results just so that the application of 
the science will eventually lead to making money. Here's an unlikely hero (and 
ultimately a hypocrite) who opposes this type of behavior:

That is exactly why RMS insists on mentioning GNU in the name. Because
GNU project was not started for fun, it was started to create a Free
Unix like Operating System. Linux was written for fun. So those who
believe ideology is important should continue to highlight why GNU was
written, and adding GNU in the name is one such way. If people don't
subscribe to this view, there are many, they can continue calling it
Linux.

Couple of articles by Rich Stallman:

Is it important whether people know the system's origin, history, and purpose? Yes?because people who forget history are often condemned to repeat it. The Free World that has developed around GNU/Linux is not guaranteed to survive; the problems that led us to develop GNU are not completely eradicated, and they threaten to come back.

***
When I explain why it's appropriate to call the operating system GNU/Linux rather than Linux, people sometimes respond this way:

Granted that the GNU Project deserves credit for this work, is it really worth a fuss when people don't give credit? Isn't the important thing that the job was done, not who did it? You ought to relax, take pride in the job well done, and not worry about the credit. 
***

This would be wise advice, if only the situation were like that?if the job were done and it were time to relax. If only that were true! But challenges abound, and this is no time to take the future for granted. Our community's strength rests on commitment to freedom and cooperation. Using the name GNU/Linux is a way for people to remind themselves and inform others of these goals.

It is possible to write good free software without thinking of GNU; much good work has been done in the name of Linux also. But the term ?Linux? has been associated ever since it was first coined with a philosophy that does not make a commitment to the freedom to cooperate. As the name is increasingly used by business, we will have even more trouble making it connect with community spirit.

Why are many of us bothering to even click on a Flash video(
propreitary) when OGG(freedom ) video is available!

Chrome and firefox play OGG by default and I can safely assume that
most of us are using latest versions of them !

Since this has turned into an OT (yet again), I'd like to specify an incident.
RMS came to our company in Bangalore and he gave a speech on freedom
and free software.

He asked the audience to stop using cellphones, because they're
proprietary and they can detect where you are. He said that he doesn't
have a cellphone, but he suggested to use a cellphone that is open
sourced. A person kept a bottle of Kinley water next to him, he said
that he doesn't use Coca-Cola products because he is part of the
wordwide boycott of that company. He said that sometimes he doesn't
drink a drop of water while travelling in flight because the flight
served only coca-cola products.

So, I hope true believers of freedom don't drinking coca-cola
products, don't use iphone, blackberry, (symbian is opensourced,
yay!), windows, mac osx, adobe products, mp3 songs, dvd movies, divx
movies, don't play flash games, video games based on windows, nvidia,
don't use microsoft docs, hell they shouldn't be even using google
docs. Reject .Net projects at work, Infact, we should have the guts to
quit the company where we work because they use only windows. Actually
you should throw your desktop/laptop (while you are at it, make sure
you break & burn it) because the bios used is proprietary.

lets all practice what we preach.

Apologies for the troll, had this stuck in my neck for so long.

I've tried wammu before with no luck but after seeing your email, I
decided to give it another shot. It's brilliant, even better than the
god-forsaken Nokia PC Suite. It auto-detected my phone (I picked the
bluephonet option at random from the two options it showed me), and then
picked up contacts, messages, battery level _and_ signal!

Great tip, Yuvi.

I tried the bluetooth connection method with OBEX over bluetooth, it
identifies the device and bluntly says your device does not support
this type of connection. Installing Gnapplet was also a failure as
installation of Gnapplet on the more recent Symbian releases is not
supported. Will try other options and get back. Till then
Series60-remote is the best I can get.

If you ever feel like syncing your calendar and contacts, you can use
multisync with multisync-gui. Setting it up is non-trivial, but
afterwards it's a breeze to use. My brick of an N73 (which hates the
Nokia PC Suite) syncs neatly with Evolution through multisync though I
only use this for the calendar and contacts.

Greetings,
??????????????? The 5 day Industrial Training conducted by Free Software Foundation, TamilNadu in association with SSN Engineering College ended today with a great blast! 220+ Students attended the 5 day Training and all sessions were fabulous learning experience. Mr.Ravi Jaya (Python Session), Mr.(Linux) Baskar (Linux Installation, Dir Structure) and all other speakers were great in delivering knowledge to all students. 

I need to specially thank Mr.Shanu, Mr.Praveen Chandrahas, Mr.Siddharth, Mr.Welkin, Mr.Shashan, SSN Management and all volunteers in making this event a great success. Mr.Shanu's session on FSF helped everyone to know what Free and Open Source Software is and how they can contribute. Mr.Siddharth handled enlightening session on Software Patents and FSMI. Mr.Praveen's session on Cloud and his complete presence helped all newbies to acquire clarity on many issues. Mr.Welkin's session on Downloading,Compiling and Creating Application was very interesting and informative. I (Santhosh.V) handled a session on "how to do Projects" and shared my experience with FSF, TN. 

This Event has motivated and gave a clarity of thought and usage to 220+ Students where you can see many of them already started working on Linux. Projects were assigned to every college participated. Hats-Off to FSF, TamilNadu for their good Work!

@Santhoh,
Why cant you organize a workshop of these kind in your college.
I hope the students in your locality would get benefited.
Think about it.
For any assistance we would be their to help you out.

@ FSF Team.  I like to thank the Team FSF-TN for given me an opportunity to
be part of great show.
Keep up the good work TEAM.

Special thanks to Welkin and others who had pulled me in.

Amusing mail :) sorry for going OT . I was just wondering why people
click on youtube link rather than the ogg video which more/less plays
by default in browsers . I am not commenting on individual but just
thinking aloud on why we weren't able to spread OGG well .

Well lets assume how a true believer will be . First he  will be using
openmoko with any n/w provider . Then for navigation he will be using
open street maps . On his home box he should be running gnewsense or
similar distros ( Here is GNU recommended free distros
http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html ) . His mail would be
checked via emacs . emacs would be the central point for his entire
works .  He would not be using any email service .. mostly will be
running his own server for domain and email services ( again in pure
free s/w )

+1, I hate flv video but i gave flv version for sake for playlist of other
RSAnimated videos.
I always submit flv version to tinyvid.tv for conversion. this may be a good
reason to open flv url
infact, youtube can be played in Chrome also... many a lot of videos are
available in html5 version..

Imagine RMS as a great "Sadhu/Mahatma/Avtar". If you try to follow him, that
does not means you "have to" become like him. If you like Ramdev Baba, you
need to be become like him Or you need not to perform all his yoga in single

Invalid.

*All* free operating systems follow the bazaar model. Only linux became 
mainstream and stayed free. Mach+BSD became mainstream in their OSX avatar but 
it is non-free:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X

Did you read the links I posted ? Here is a quote in one of them from linus himself:

"""
But for a project I actually care about, I would never choose the BSD license. 
The license doesn't encode my fundamental beliefs of 'fairness'. I think the BSD 
license encourages a 'everybody for himself' mentality, and doesn't encourage 
people to work together, and to merge."

     "Let me put this in source management terms, since I've also been working 
on a source control management project for the last few years: the BSD license 
encourages 'branching', but the fact is, branching is not really all that 
interesting. What's interesting is 'merging': the branching is just a largely 
irrelevant prerequisite to be able to merge.

     "The GPLv2 encourages *merging*. Again, the right to 'branch' needs to be 
there in order for merges to be possible, but the right to branch is actually 
much less important than the right to 'merge'."

"""

Do you really want to disagree with linus about his choice of license for his 
own OS ? He has said *plenty* of times (read the links I posted) that choosing 
the GPLv2 license was the best thing he did for linux !! ...and you want to deny 
it's effect ? ...if you do, you are just being unreasonably stubborn, pretty 
much like the character this thread talks about.

True as it maybe, it is not rms's genius, but his stubbornness to not confirm 
and take the easy path, as most others would've, that laid the foundations of 
the larger movement that we know as FOSS today.

Like I said in one of my other posts in this thread, talking about freedom and 
writing open source software are *not* mutually exclusive !

Linus, irrespective of what you want to imagine, cares *deeply* about freedom 
too (read the links), he just prefers to be pragmatic about it.

cheers,

any one is free to choose his own license. And linus was quite free to chose 
GPL - and since he has licensed git under the same license, it looks like he 
is still pro GPL. But I have to disagree with him in his assesment of BSD 
style licenses. I do not see anything untoward happening with projects like 
Apache, python, postgresql et al. I have been called unreasonably stubborn - 
and btw it is one of the things I appreciate about RMS.

where did I ever say that he does not care about freedom? All I am saying is 
that in order for software to be truly free, it should follow a particular 
methodology of development - for want of a better word, the bazaar 
methodology. And this is also in context of many of our local developers. They 
will not keep committing code - they wait till it is 'complete' - by which 
time it is too late for any one else to help out. So we get large number of 
one-man projects. One of the reasons for this is that they think that as long 
as the code is released under a free license, it is open source software. It 
is not - there is much more to open source software than just making the code 
available for download. A whole support system needs to be built - it is only 
then that the true power of open source comes into play.

I think he did. My memory of this is a little vague but the first time I
used Linux sometime in 1992/1993 or so, it required gcc. But Linus did
start developing Linux on Minix (I think he used Gcc 1.37 initially and
then 1.4) and only later on removed Minix apps and replaced then with GPL
apps. Actually one of the first things he ported over when Linux became
self-hosting was gcc and bash.

I think 386BSD etc continued to use their own compilers.

Prem

Oh ok. Sorry didn't read it. Other things - it was actually Linus who
ported gcc 1.4 over to minix.

"GCC development in the early days was a bit too conservative for the
tastes of many an eager hacker. Several of the frustrated developers
started their own forks of GCC in the hopes of getting their changes
much faster to end users. In 1997, several of these hackers got
together to create the EGCS project."

"In April 1999, after a long period of behind-the-scenes negotiation,
EGCS and GCC reunited, and EGCS was accepted as the GNU Project's
official GCC."

<quote>

As GCC was free software, programmers wanting to work in other directions?
particularly those writing interfaces for languages other than C?were free to 
develop their own fork of the compiler. Multiple forks proved inefficient and 
unwieldy, however, and the difficulty in getting work accepted by the official GCC 
project was greatly frustrating for many. The FSF kept such close control on 
what was added to the official version of GCC 2.x that GCC was used as one 
example of the "cathedral" development model in Eric S. Raymond's essay The 
Cathedral and the Bazaar.
...
EGCS fork

In 1997, a group of developers formed EGCS (Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler 
System),[11] to merge several experimental forks into a single project. The 
basis of the merger was a GCC development snapshot taken between the 2.7 and 
2.81 releases. Projects merged included g77 (Fortran), PGCC (P5 Pentium-
optimized GCC), many C++ improvements, and many new architectures and 
operating system variants.[12][13]

EGCS development proved considerably more vigorous than GCC development, so 
much so that the FSF officially halted development on their GCC 2.x compiler, 
"blessed" EGCS as the official version of GCC and appointed the EGCS project as 
the GCC maintainers in April 1999. Furthermore, the project explicitly adopted 
the "bazaar" model over the "cathedral" model. With the release of GCC 2.95 in 
July 1999, the two projects were once again united.

 Printer Sharing
Message-ID: <1275893867.20523.23.camel@mjolnir>

Hello, everyone,

I have a desktop running Windows XP with a Canon Pixma MP145 attached.
This printer is shared (no password) over the home network and this
allows us all to hit print on our laptops and then get the stuff from
the printer afterwards.

This particular computer will eventually become a HTPC when I find the
time but it will still need to dual-boot for other reasons. Is it
possible for me to set this printer up under Linux to mimic how it looks
under Windows? The objective is that on my laptop I should have exactly
one entry for the printer that works irrespective of which OS the
computer with the printer is running at the time.

The printer works through CUPS, and it has a working driver on Windows.
I can share it, but it shows up as a different printer (with the same
name and model) on computers on the network depending on whether I'm
booted into Linux or Windows.

Thank you for reading,

Dear Friends,

IMHO and of experience in associating  quite some time with ilugc, i am
writing this in my individual capacity.
Our meet is on second saturday every month and this information can be found
by regular watch on the mailing list.
We need to do activity and that needs *PHYSICAL* volunteer ship. IMO, this
sms idea to me does not hold any water in it.So instead of focussing on
something which is less important, lets join for the forth coming meet and
plan some foss related activity like LDD, which is  long due.

Thanks and regards,

I have no relevant experience and not the slightest clue what your
model number means.

I am going to buy a printer in a month or two but I am sure I won't buy
an industry standard printer bought in companies.

It is going to be a HP printer/scanner/whatever for around 7k.

Anyway I am hoping that your printer support TCP printing using LPD protocol.

Check if it listens at TCP port 515 for PS printing.

If your printer supports postscript then Linux can do better than Windoze.

If on the other hand it does not have an ethernet port at all then you are
 going to fiddle around with CUPS I suppose.

I hope that I can get a postscript printer for 7k. ;)

This is the problem, Girish. It's a cheap home printer, and so CUPS is
what I have.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimDOqKBcyqA19_ug48GSnS0edyh5y7bQv2DsuW8@mail.gmail.com>

The Ubuntu release party was celebrated again after 6 months
following the release of latest Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 at April 2010.

The vision of these parties are to share the features of Linux to the
general public.
So far, Linux is in the hands of students, programmers and geeks.
Bring it to public is the need of the hour.

We, KanchiLUG team decided to celebrate a Ubuntu release party this
time too, on June 6, 2010.

Unlike last time, we hardly get time for this event as
we have 2 major activities last week.

1. Programming bootcamp
2. Release of Ubuntu Manual in Tamil

These made our days and nights busy and sleepless. :-)

But still, we had a team for organizing release party.

We approached various schools for the venue and finally got the
famous ?Pachaiyappan Hr.Sec School?.

We printed pamphlet and circulated via local newspapers.

We Invited ?Ramadas (amachu) ? as Chief Guest.

It was a nice evening with little drizzling.
We were busy with arranging hall, fixing projectors, banners and audio systems.

Around 3.30, the hall was getting filled with public.
At 3.45, we started.

Ramya Invited everyone.


Arulalan started with a presentation of ?History of Gnu/Linux?.
Then, explained on ?Open source and its concepts?.

Rajkumar showed the beautiful compiz effects.
Yasir explained ?Why Linux??
Kabilan explained how Ubuntu born and how it is growing.

Suresh demonstrated some 3d games like openarena, torcs and tuxracer.
Balakrishnan explained that Installation is very easy and showed a demo on it.

Tea and snacks were provided in the meantime.

Malathi and Suji explained how they started their career with opensource
at their college and how students can contribute to open source.
They explained about their Tamil font creation project and
Tamil spell checker project.

The Chief Guest Ramadhas, started with his awesome speech.
He explained how the proprietary world is making us as slave.
The need of using opensource, the need of localizations etc.
People got enlighted and understood the concepts of opensource.

He released the Ubuntu CD and the ?Ubuntu Manual in Tamil?.
Mr. Anbu and Mrs. Umamaheswari Anbu, Shakthi ITI, received on behalf
of students.
Mr. Sundhar, Bank of India, received for public.

Myself explained the job opportunities in the FOSS world.

Arulalan introduced the activities of KanchiLUG.
Requested the audience to join in mailing list.
Shared the contact numbers for local support.

The Q&A session was interesting and public raised lots
of queries and we answered them all.

With National Anthem, we ended the show at 6.45 pm.

We had around 75 audience and show is a successful one.

We thank Nandha Kumar, Vignesh, Akilan, Nagaraj,
Rajeshwari, sathish, Arun who traveled from chennai
to attend this event.

You are welcome to download the Alpha version of ?Ubuntu Manual? in Tamil
at http://ubuntu-tam.org/avanam/lucid-lynx

Still it need more fixes, we are working on that and will release a
final version as soon as possible.

Here are the snaps of the event.

I have a system that has fedora12.
While installing i had opted to go with the default LVM options that the
installer gave.
Now i would like to extract 20GB from the total free space and create a new
partition for installing another operating system.
A single hard disk with size 240GB was used.

There's an interesting thread on the CentOS mailing list on
sys admin horror stories.  Amusing read.

http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos/2010-June/095423.html


I once had a vendor sys admin run an "rm -rf ./project/ subdir" and
delete the entire ./project folder and 2 months of live data.  Same
vendor had also not noticed that automated backups had failed for
many weeks and we were running without any backup for a long
time.  A penalty of Rs 2 lakhs was enforced, all because of one
extra space in the command.

Last time I used GParted on Fedora (few months back), it didn't
support LVM partitions.

As steve said, Fedora has its own tools for LVM management, you should
try those.

Is it possible to find out from which repository a package was

Thank you.

I remember using something called "apt-show-versions".

Example:

apt-show-versions -p autoconf -a

output:

autoconf 2.61-8 install ok installed
autoconf 2.61-8 lenny ftp.us.debian.org
autoconf/lenny uptodate 2.61-8

This works fine. Thanks. I found out that 'apt-cache showpkg' command
also gives some sort of information regarding the repository from
where the package was installed.

Thank you.

Sage Days 25 - An Invitation

What is 'Sage Days'?
Sage Days is a confluence of present and prospective SAGE Users and
Developers. It is an opportunity to come together to share ideas,
brainstorm and hack on Sage.

Sage Days 25 is the 25th version of Sage Days, and is being organized in
Mumbai, India. In order to cater to an Indian audience and scenario, this
version has been tweaked slightly. Sage Days 25 has beginner level
tutorials, in addition to the usual talks and sprints, to help new users get
started with Sage and help promote the use of Sage in India.

What is Sage?
Sage is a free, open-source mathematics software system licensed under the
GPL. It combines the power of numerous existing open-source packages into a
common Python-based interface. It's mission is to create a "viable free open
source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica and Matlab".

Sage has tools for a broad range of mathematical areas like Linear Algebra,
Calculus, Symbolic Math,  Plotting, Rings & Groups, Graph Theory, Number
Theory and Cryptography. Essentially, "it can do anything from mapping a
12-dimensional object to calculating rainfall patterns under global warming"
- as Science Daily puts it . Eager to get started? Start here. [#1]

Apart from being feature rich, it's usability is one of it's greatest
strengths. Sage Notebook, a web-interface for all the math you'll ever want
to do, is really the killer feature! As the Sage Marketing page says, "The
SAGE GUI surely works on your computer box, because it just runs in
Firefox!".  Try it Now! [#2]

Why should you attend?
Sage Days 25 is being attended by the creator and lead developer of Sage,
Prof. William Stein. It will also be attended by other developers of Sage.
This would be a great opportunity to meet and interact with them!

The conference will be attended by a plethora of enthusiastic people from
all over the country who use Sage or are interested in doing so. The
conference will also see the presence of many mathematicians interested in
software. Who knows, you may run into someone you'd want to collaborate
with, for your future work!

This event will be a great learning experience, if you are even remotely
interested in math and software for it!

When and Where?
Venue: IIT-Bombay, Mumbai, India
Dates: August 9-12, 2010

For the most of professionals, Sunday is the day meant for the family.
Don't mesh it up the family affairs, since the rate of divorce increased in
the urban, we don't need part it.

Just kidding !!!

This has been discussed at length in the past. It is one
invariant about the ILUGC Meets. Saturday only.

I have one more reason to shift it to Sunday now :P
  -> Linus Tolvards was a Sunday born. :P

But then, it is not going to happen :P

Their could be two reasons why you want to shift the monthly meeting to the
Sunday

   1. Your company might be working on Saturdays, do  switch to the  company
   where you can get Saturday off. If you want know the list of companies do
   GOOGLE it.
   2. You might be a single, so get into a family you will know the
   importance of Sunday.

This is the trend and those interested in software application
development should be considering this in their long term strategy
(both skill set as well as business).  iPhone/Android applications by
independent developers come to mind.

Good suggestion, to our best, we make efforts to make the questions far from
grammatical and spelling errors.
We would like to present the replies from the guest as it is. In a way, this
will help us not to misquote replies from our guest.

If there are grammatical/spelling issues in the replies, you should
correct them as part of your proof reading. If you are worried about
misquoting, present the corrected final edition with the interviewee and
get a acknowledgement.

Hi Team

I am trying to overcome the blocked access in my office somehow as I think the security restrictions have gone too far to carry on my daily activities. Here is the scenario. I cannot access any email sites, IM sites, entertainment sites from my office. The setup as far as I understood is that all traffic from the local systems are being tunneled through a proxy server. I tried using various methods to access websites & IM sites like anonymous proxy servers & few other ways. But what I found was that no matter what, I don't seem to be able to access any of the mail/IM sites. Just then I tried Firefox add-on sameplace [xmpp] which was little complicated to set up as it had few dependencies & the only thing that works for me now in gtalk. All the other Firefox addons like gtalksidebar, meebo, etc failed. Certainly, they aren?t blocking talk.google.com since any addon trying to connect to gtalk connects to talk.google.com. Few doubts on my mind now are:

* Is there a way to direct http traffic over xmpp?
* How do I know if they are blocking it via ports?
* I would like you guys to guess the rule or setup they have to monitor or block traffic.

For all those guys having the same problem, I am currently able to use gmail/rediffmail/yahoomail via http://www.noblewebs.com/postbox/ & as mentioned above, gtalk via sameplace firefox addon.

Regards
N Deepak.

Seriously, if it blocked the sys admins should have a reason to. The
reason is certainly not for us to work around it. If you think they
are insane in setting some restrictions, take it up with them. Looking
for ways to tunnel only makes your position more complicated.

It makes sense for them to block it as there are few other secure projects running from the same location. And I guess it's the same issue with every corporate office. Having said that, I still want to understand the setup they have & break it for my own communication purposes.

This is a non-technical dispute and working around it is likely a
contract violation and you can terminated for doing so.   Regardless of
the feasibility of such solutions, I would have to ask you and everyone
to refrain from this path.  Posting about this in a public mailing list
with archives is a bad idea as well.

sounds like already you've started violating something here; also don't send emails from your corporate email ID which always carry a big tail called "disclaimer", better to think before act on something which breaks your firm's policy system. May be it seems funny now but if they act on right manner,then it's gonna be real trouble maker for your career mate! have fun but not w/ firm's policies/values.

There's an excellent quote from the Camel Book (Perl):

"If someone hands you a strange gadget, asks you to hold
the barrel to your head and pull the trigger, you cannot assume
it will dry your hair."

Never mind your good intentions as to why you want to bypass
your corporate security policies.  Look at what you are attempting
from the company's perspective.  It's clearly 1) against corporate
policy, and 2) against the law. You may be faced with consequences
more severe than you currently imagine.

During my time at university, out of curiosity I tired such things,
and am thankful that I got away with only a good scolding. The
corporate world is not so forgiving.

If you still want to learn such things, suggest you setup a lab
at home and practice all you want.  Don't do it at office or on
someone else's infrastructure.

Alright, I'll try not to sermonize why posting something like this from 
a company mail id is a Very Very Bad Idea (TM), but if you managed not 
to get fired for this, here's something that always worked for me when I 
needed some exception to the access rules (most of them are there for a 
good reason, sometimes not) - make friends with your sysadmin(s) :)

Cheers,

actually most of these rules are there for very silly or no reason at all - 
but the fact is that rules are rules, they are paying you and you must have 
signed any number of papers undertaking to abide by the rules. And if you 
break them, do not expect the company to pay for your funeral expenses.

That is not a email, IM or entertainment site. So he won't be
interested :P and either ways, he'll ask you ways to crack the system

even i tried such stuff and found a way to bypass the proxy server in my
univ. wifi network, so mailed this issue anonymously to my college associate
director.. he never replied... :D but that was way safer option than getting
deeper into the intrusion and get caught at some point. :)

    When I do ssh from 192.168.6.82 to root@192.168.1.142, it has to

I cannot access any email sites, IM sites, entertainment sites from my office. The setup as far as I understood is that all traffic from the local systems are being tunneled through a proxy server. I tried using various methods to access websites & IM sites like anonymous proxy servers & few other ways. But what I found was that no matter what, I don't seem to be able to access any of the mail/IM sites. Just then I tried Firefox add-on sameplace [xmpp] which was little complicated to set up as it had few dependencies & the only thing that works for me now in gtalk. All the other Firefox addons like gtalksidebar, meebo, etc failed. Certainly, they aren?t blocking talk.google.com since any addon trying to connect to gtalk connects to talk.google.com. Few doubts on my mind now are:

This thread interested me just out of curiosity to know if someone had
mailed a technical answer to the question asked.

I have broken e-mail accounts, reverse engineered the DES cryptosystem
 and generally played a lot with crypto.

I am also very good at physically breaking locks and entering a house
without a key. ;)

Anyway it calls for ingenuity and resourcefulness and of course purity
of intent.

If you are sure that you are doing something conscientious and
meaningful then just go ahead. ;)

So what if they fire you? Find another job. I got fired from every job
for no fault of mine. Anyway lest us focus now. (Most likely they
won't even know any of this)


> * Is there a way to direct http traffic over xmpp?

With http-bind they way web IM works? You can tunnel XMPP over HTTP;
so ergo you should be able to do the reverse.

But I would not suggest that. See below.

> * How do I know if they are blocking it via ports?

Blocking what via ports? Run a security scanner like netcat or nmap or
nessus or nikto or hping.

Did you attend my talk at IIT in Sep 2007? ( I hope I got the year right).

> * I would like you guys to guess the rule or setup they have to monitor or block traffic.

Rule? What rule? Why should you care about it? You can get around
every such rule if you are clever and know the big picture. And of
course you should have access to the right tool and have lot of
perseverance.

Having blabbered so much I will also speak about the big picture of
access control and how things actually work and how to break them.

Look at tor anonymizers or port forwarding using SSH. In general you
need a third party machine somewhere for you to help get on to the
Internet without restrictions.

Use crypto to avoid getting detected. No tool can look inside
cryptographically protected packets; so tunnel traffic using ssh and
your sysadmin will be none the wiser.

Run your ssh server on the public IP at port 80. And use it to forward
all your traffic.

Once you setup remote port forwarding you can do anything you want!

There is a tor plugin for firefox.

To figure out which ports are blocked this command line should suffice.

# nmap -sT -p 1000-5000 192.168.107.6

This will scan TCP ports between 1000 to 5000 on the IP given.

To find out which machines on your network are up run this:

# nmap -P0 192.168.107.0/24

nmap is not the only tool out there. You could also use hping or SING to
good effect.

Have fun.

Dear Vellingiri,

Please search in ILUGC archives for ssh port forwarding tip. I had sent
one long long ago.

While I don't support his action in any way, let's not get sarcastic be 
hard on the chap - maybe just a kid who joined right out of college - 
either way, we're giving him a hard enough time already, so I don't see 
a point in rubbing it in.

I have a question on morality issue here. My apologies if this becomes
Off Topic, Shrini - delete this if it is not appropriate.

As ILUG-C member, should we encourage and answer a question that asks
for help to crack a system because the person "I cannot access any
email sites, IM sites, entertainment sites from my office"?

Aren't we better than crackers?

My personal point of view : we shouldn't do it. Being all hardcore
fans of Free Software and complaining about Adobe and Microsoft about
their ethics, I believe we can at least try to be ethical in our own
way.

If you really wanted to help such a query, please reply to the person
directly and do NOT use ILUG-C as the medium.

I fully agree - we are hackers not crackers - and such discussions have no 
place in this list. It just needs one person to slashdot it and our reputation 
will be soiled.

Hi,

> nessus or nikto or hping.

and how should you install it? if I know it right, then most
corporates give you windows machines with the least privileges. In
fact, the few things that work best in these installations are MS
Office, MS Outlook and your coding environment. But then, thats all is
needed. I am not sure about these tools (i've used them on a linux box
at home where I am the admin) on windows, but wouldn't they need
administrator rights to actually do port scanning? Just curious.

> Run your ssh server on the public IP at port 80. And use it to forward

Again, you are behind a firewall with NAT. I don't have enough fundas,
but can you actually get the reverse-lookup right for the public
server to get back correctly? I don't know, so I am trying to
understand.

One last query, would not an existing IDS installation detect port
scanning happening on a certain machine? Would that not put our man in
question? He seems to be using his Official ID to mail the list. This
leaves me with the feeling that he is not entirely aware of what he is
doing. He could meaning only to check his gmail, but then if an IDS
detects his login, they are not going to believe him. are they? By IDS
I am referring to Instrusion Detection Systems. Btw, I am not sure if
they are common in Indian IT space.

If he wanted to learn how to do this and thought that asking on a public general 
purpose linux users mailing list is the best way to go about it, he is better 
off being advised not to do it.

Also, handing over a gun to monkey, might not only cause harm to the monkey, but 
also puts doubts on _your_ ability to think about your actions.

What if he does get caught and it somehow leads back to you ? It'd be wise to 
always remember, our clueless cyber security cell policewallas are more than 
happy to jail totally unrelated people just because they could find a link.

What if the OP is not just a frustrated teen in an office but anti-social enough 
to cause harm ? what if ...

I am not kidding about being careful, before you know it, that cool hacking you 
do/teach for 'fun' might end up being considered as seriously unlawful 
activities (read major jail time).

Even cracking a WEP key can be twisted into 'engaging in terrorist activities 
and a threat to the nation', given enough massala.

cheers,

you have to issue the following command from the local system where
xx:xx:xx:xx is the remote server address:
# ssh -D localhost:1080 root@xx:xx:xx:xx
more on # man ssh ;-)
this will dynamically bind port 1080 on local system to the remote ssh
server.. you can use any web application like web browsers and im clients
which supports socks proxy.. yes you need to configure it to work..  :) for
windows use putty instead for the effect ;-)

ImageMagick can do that.

You can easily script it . netpbm tools are another option.

You can take a snapshot of the video from the middle using these tools too.

mplayer can dish out frames and you could use them.

I have written about these.

Hey,

Since you top post I will also follow suit. ;)

iptables has nothing to do with ssh port forwarding.

iptables will port forward without ssh.

You can do port forwarding at IP level or with an application at layer 5/7
like ssh...

I really hope no one actually tries any of these at work, especially in 
companies with a competent IT/Security team.

Running a vulnerability scanner against internal or external IP's from a 
corporate can get you into serious trouble. This can be caught easily. 
In any case, none of these will be help you get around web filtering. So 
you can get fired *and* not be able to browse gmail.

TOR : Downright dangerous running in a corporate network (even if you 
get it to work). Could get company into trouble due to unknown traffic 
relayed/exited etc.

SSH Tunnel on port 80: Safest of the lot, but there are tools 
specifically designed to look for such long running (but low volume) 
sessions to external hosts.  VPN's to home can also be detected in a 
similar manner.

Be warned that you might already in trouble!

You have sent this to a public mailing list from your company id. Google and
every other search engine will dutifully index it against your name. Any
future employer, as part of verification does a search on your name, this
might very well show up on the first page. I wonder if all this attention to
your mail will increase its pagerank!!

I suggest that you create a lot of noise - posting lots of interesting but
non-incriminating mails to lots of lists and hope that they all get a higher
pagerank than this :-)

Really, if you are this careless about your own interests, you should not
try any of the things you hinted. You might inadvertently expose company
data and may even get jail time. No joke.

best of luck,
mano

I cannot access any email sites, IM sites, entertainment sites from my office. The setup as far as I understood is that all traffic from the local systems are being tunneled through a proxy server. I tried using various methods to access websites & IM sites like anonymous proxy servers & few other ways. But what I found was that no matter what, I don't seem to be able to access any of the mail/IM sites. Just then I tried Firefox add-on sameplace [xmpp] which was little complicated to set up as it had few dependencies & the only thing that works for me now in gtalk. All the other Firefox addons like gtalksidebar, meebo, etc failed. Certainly, they aren?t blocking talk.google.com since any addon trying to connect to gtalk connects to talk.google.com.

If you really want to access the blocked sites, then use your mobile
and access via GPRS or 3G during work breaks. Corporate networks may
contain sensitive data and you might be breaching the terms of your
contract. No company will tolerate such behaviour and it'll ruin your
career.

Just my opinion.

Stop misleading others.  Encouraging someone to break the rules
is immature and irresponsible.

Organizations don't arbitrarily create rules.  They are made because
of 1) govt compliance regulations, 2) IT security policies enforced
by their customers, and 3) industry best practices.

It may be a prank for you, but breaking company security policies also
harms the entire organization as the company's reputation and business
is at stake.  Eg. would you trust your money with a bank that has a poor
security policy?

No enterprise firewall/security system is stupid enough to fall for this trick.

Enterprise HTTP proxy servers (Blue Coat, WebSense, IronPort) routinely
break HTTPS/SSL connections.  They call it "SSL visibility".

The best an nmap scan can do is annoy the security admins.  Most firewalls
will automatically detect port scans and take appropriate action.


Organizations of all sizes invest a lot of resources into IT security.
Bypassing them is extremely difficult.  Even if you bypass the systems,
it's near impossible to hide your tracks and you will be held accountable
for your actions.


As I already said, it's okay to be interested in cracking.  But do it using
your own infrastructure.

I would urge you to get your networking fundae in place if this is
your bread/butter job.   Once your networking fundae are clear, you
will be able to Google search with better precision.   Claiming "new
to networking" may work one or two times only IMO.

Yes what you want to be done is possible with iptables but it will be
for all users, not just root, because iptables works at the IP layer
and not the application layer.  Before you delve into iptables you
need to draw a network diagram and visualize the packet flow.  Then
you need to understand the functionality of the "tables" built into
iptables, then chalk out rules and implement them.

Post your iptables rules, tell us what errors you are encountering.
Perhaps, then list members can help you.

While you are doing it, also invest in O'Reilly's the  "Linux
Networking Cookbook" by Carla Schroder.   At Rs. 500 (minus15%
discount at most book shops) it is a steal, given that it covers
solutions for a lot of networking scenarios.

Good point.

To the original poster - please refrain from doing this. You can always go
home and check your emails what not.

If you want to learn how to hack, please do it on your own infrastructure
or get a clearance in writing from your boss to test the corporate
network's security.

If you are trying to bypass your companies security without written
permission, please be forewarned that these sorts of hack attempts are
usually logged and it will be very easy to trace the hack back to you.

If an hack attempt is detected (especially originating from within the
company's network), it can be very expensive for the company to determine
if the hack was successful, if any computers have been compromised, what
data has been stolen/manipulated etc, to close all loop holes etc.. So you
will be in a LOT of trouble if you are seen as the perpetrator and you
could easily face jail time and stiff fines.

NO ONE is going to be believe you when you say that you went to all that
effort to just check email and chat. The assumption will always be that
your hack was to steal or manipulate sensitive information and that you
may very well have accomplices both within and outside the organization.

Regards,
Prem

I have installed the astaro software (UTM) in my work place In my work as one of the VMs.

Iam having 2 on board NIC's and one pci broadcom NIC total 3 NICs.

Now i do not have any managed switches in my office.

a) I want to do VLAN for my LAN users and accounts depart.
b) I want to give restricted browsing for LAN and Accounts (same as what sites are allowed to Lan users will have access to accounts users). But accounts and LAN users will have different segments.
c) Wifi users will have no restrictions on the browsing and it will not come into LAN, browsing or accounts.

I want to configure this in astaro. I am able to ping from my system to astaro but iam unable to browse.

Can you please help me in this,

Thanks in advance.

ffmpeg is also a nice tool. It is usually more buggy when compared to
mencoder in the sense that it does not handle standards gracefully and
the quality of audio is usually poor.

I dunno about its ability to grab frames. It is pretty good at capturing video
from X11.

Your mileage may vary. There are no canned answers to such questions.

Which in other words means "I dunno." ;)

No probs. I got this response from the django group (posting just for
gyaan).
I actually liked the way how easy it is to get a frame from a video in 4
lines!

----------------------------------------------------8<------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would recommend using ffmpeg over mplayer for this purpose. ffmpeg
actually has releases, where as there hasn't been a release of mplayer
for over 3 years - the mplayer devs got frustrated at packaging it,
and now recommend users to use tip of svn.

Also, mplayer is based on the same libraries as ffmpeg, so you get the
same end results.

Oooh, theres also a python wrapper around ffmpeg, and their example on
their frontpage does precisely what you asked for:

Subject: [Ilugc] Pop Up not working with iptables DNAT rules
Message-ID: <AANLkTilus6XXj-LsdEULadOWcySO_vjkhLdJ8Gl3F1z2@mail.gmail.com>

I have a MPLS VPN setup connecting 3 locations, with one of the
locations being the GW to the Internet (for all three locations).
The GW has one public static IP with iptables FireWall (FW).

SNAT handles outgoing connections to the Internet for all three
locations (different private IP nets)

There are services within the VPN LAN at two locations that need to be
made accessible to a set of "select" IPs connecting from the Internet
e.g. ERP, DVR surveillance, IP camera.

I have set up DNAT rules for each "opened" service as shown below.
NB: EXTIF and EXTIP are defined at the begining of the iptables shell
script and default FORWARD rule is DROP

# DNAT to give access to DVR machine @ 172.16.0.131:80
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i $EXTIF -s <ext_IP_1> -d $EXTIP
--dport 8282 -j DNAT --to-destination  172.16.0.131:80
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i $EXTIF -s <ext_IP_2> -d $EXTIP
--dport 8282 -j DNAT --to-destination 172.16.0.131:80
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i $EXTIF -s <ext_IP_3> -d $EXTIP
--dport 8282 -j DNAT --to-destination 172.16.0.131:80
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -i $EXTIF -o $INTIF2 -d 172.16.0.131
--dport 80 -j ACCEPT

The above strategy is working for services that are on Linux (Apache)
without pop up windows but not on services with pop up.

The error conditions are different for each service.

For the specific example of the DVR box,  When I type:
http://<EXTIP>:8282/ in my browser (the IP number is one of the
ext_IP_? in above rule) I get:

<error code>
400 Bad Request
Your client has issued a malformed or illegal request.
</error code>

Instead of the pop up box that one gets when connecting to the same
unit from workstations on the VPN LAN.

Any hints/suggestions to debug and determine the location of the
problem welcome.

TIA

Well..you guys came really hard on me, but never mind cuz I was kind of expecting this as it happens frequently on this list. First of all let me make my intentions clear - It was to learn & not exactly to break/hack something that the company owns. You people should have answered the question & then disclaimed not to hold you responsible for, even if not in the public mailing list.

>> OMG.. OP is using his company email id.. :o

You are probably not reading the email properly. I have NO access to any kind of email, what were you thinking when you said that?

It is totally fine not to help or answer about something, I thought, you guys were good at. Rather than hitting the nail on its head, you guys were beating around the bush repeatedly. And I am not drunk when I sent this email to the list & I am grateful for all those guys so very concerned about my job & career. A special mention to somebody who has even spoken about being jailed. :) You should have realized that I would learn how to do it some way or the other.

> This thread interested me just out of curiosity to know if someone had mailed a technical answer to the question asked. I have broken e-mail accounts, >reverse engineered the DES cryptosystem  and generally played a lot with crypto.I am also very good at physically breaking locks and entering a house >without a key. ;) Anyway it calls for ingenuity and resourcefulness and of course purity of intent. If you are sure that you are doing something >conscientious and meaningful then just go ahead. ;) So what if they fire you? Find another job. I got fired from every job for no fault of mine. Anyway >lest us focus now. (Most likely they won't even know any of this)

The summary of the lines mentioned above was my intention. Thanks Girish to have at least said something rather than just giving FREE advice about my career like the others did [though they were being nice to me..err..my career! ;)].

> What if the OP is not just a frustrated teen in an office but anti-social enough to cause harm ? what if ...
Nothing much would have happened...then we would have had one less topic to learn - 'Ethical Hacking'! Have you asked the same question to yourself before learning things?


>also don't send emails from your corporate email ID which always carry a big tail called "disclaimer", better to think before act on something
The whole email was asking to suggest something else!

I guess we could drop this off right here & delete it off the mailing list if my idea's still feels murky on your minds. Putting the mailing list at risk has never been in my mind. Thanks to all those who tried to at least discuss & not advice.

Good point.

To the original poster - please refrain from doing this. You can always go
home and check your emails what not.

If you want to learn how to hack, please do it on your own infrastructure
or get a clearance in writing from your boss to test the corporate
network's security.

If you are trying to bypass your companies security without written
permission, please be forewarned that these sorts of hack attempts are
usually logged and it will be very easy to trace the hack back to you.

If an hack attempt is detected (especially originating from within the
company's network), it can be very expensive for the company to determine
if the hack was successful, if any computers have been compromised, what
data has been stolen/manipulated etc, to close all loop holes etc.. So you
will be in a LOT of trouble if you are seen as the perpetrator and you
could easily face jail time and stiff fines.

NO ONE is going to be believe you when you say that you went to all that
effort to just check email and chat. The assumption will always be that
your hack was to steal or manipulate sensitive information and that you
may very well have accomplices both within and outside the organization.

Regards,
Prem

I generally stay away from "asking for help" unless I need it.

And do not recommend people doing it.

It is good to get help once in a while from others but if we rely too
much on it instead of using our intellect and our personal
experience, then it hurts our confidence and ability and of course
knowledge in the long run....

Thanks.

I hope I was clear.

I meant that going to the Net for help in the form of mailing lists,
forums and so on is useful only after we do our homework and
are really sure that we have run out of options.

Your original mail said nothing about learning.  The $subject is very
clear that your intention is to break blocked access in the office.  You
can't teach someone to bypass a company policy and then disclaim
yourself from that responsibility.  It simply doesn't work that way.  
When asking for volunteer help, you can't dictate the responses you will
get either.   We can all just drop this and move on now.

different people have different learning processes - one process does not work 
for all. It is like finding the way to some new place - some people keep asking 
for directions and are soon there. Others refuse to ask anyone for directions 
and may never reach. Some people are only comfortable if they learn on their 
own and hate being instructed - others prefer to get instructions.

Arun,

We are there to help you. Don't worry.

Your mail is too heavy for me right now. I am in the middle of many things.

I will fwd this to my other account, take a look , think and mail back to LUG.

Hang on.

Meanwhile, I suggest that you leave out MPLS and DVR and so on and
just give us what you think is the problem.

People get worried when they look at terms they dunno.

Though I know MPLS quite well from a theoretical angle I dunno
anything from a practical standpoint.

Anyway I will get back soon.

Well, if you know what you're doing, then Vamsee's idea is the best ..
just talk to your sys admins, tell them you're interested in how your

break it.  You'll learn, they'll learn, everyone will live happily

Friends,

The OP wants a "how-to document" on cracking the corporate security systems.
we are not going to provide any assistance on this.

He is not willing to hear advices and suggestions.

:-)

Shall we stop here?

Thanks.

Sorry I dunno. I thought it was a networking question.

I have no clue why you are getting this HTTP error.

+1 That pretty much sums up the thoughts of most us on the term
'ethical hacking'.

Not necessarily so. In India they are created out of ignorance or arrogance
on the part of network admins. See this:

especially the info-graphic at the end. *But i don't recommend breaking the

You indicate everything works fine if the page has no popup windows.
So your network seems to be okay. The error seems to indicate a client 
side problem.

You can try :
1) Use a different browser
2) Clear cache, cookies and retry
3) Restart DVR box and retry
4) Check http error logs (if possible) that may contain more detail

Right. I learn more from #irc and stackoverflow.  IMHO, most people cant say
or are afraid to say 'I dont know' or 'can you help me'.  Humility
helps...and it helps a lot :) 'Asking' shouldn't be done without any
homework.

In this particular scenario, video streaming is not a simple arena to get
into and understand all the nuances of it, given that there is a raging war
on the video formats. I find it easy to 'ask' and also it lets me learn
different aspects of it. For eg. i was just about to get into mplayer and
learn more when someone brought about the point of 'last rev' which i had
completely forgotten.

Another instance: I had a simple Q on file uploads using progress bar and i
'asked', and i was surprised with the replies and the subsequent research
that i did. for eg. flash based or not, whether the django dev server would
run on it or not, whether flash based version is the ideal or not or whether
it 'actually' shows the 'actual' progress or not, and finally HTML5 which
has a cool fileupload drag-drop interface and many more. Hope you get the
point.

I would rate *humility *and *curiosity *as the 2 biggest virtues that every
person/programmer should have. No one likes to be instructed, but at the
same time, if they had the curiosity, i don't think anyone would ever be
instructed.

Indeed, but the same client (FF) on a "local LAN" workstation has no
problems accessing the DVR system!  That rules out client issue (FF)
but kind of indicates a bad implementation on the htttp server in the
DVR box, presuming the error code is being sent by the DVR box.

Same error with Opera and Konqueror

Will ask the client.

Yes, but they would be in the DVR box.  I have already given heads up
to client to get all vendors in one room.

Looks like sessions with tcpdump, wireshark and head banging with
vendors of these boxes :(

Don't understand what you are referring to?  HTML5 doesn't define any
such interface.  It might have tags but I don't understand the reference
even then.

The popup may be redirecting you to a different tcp port.

Eg. http://IP:80 would redirect the popup page to http://IP:8080.

and verify port numbers for all outgoing HTTP requests.

Ok.  To clarify,  the interface such as drag and drop itself can change
drastically between browsers.  HTML5 merely defines a tag and it's
functionality and the tags in this case is not limited to just file
uploads.  Mozilla is combining it with JS as well.

for example when I joined NRC-FOSS, everything was blocked except email and

Does ILUGC look like a GUI ml? ;)

Just kidding man.

Why don't you try some higher level toolkit like PyGtk or some such thing?

Doing low level Gtk coding may require a lot of expertise and pain...

@OP
this is what happen to most of us. in a academic or corporate institution.
this doesnot mean we should try to crack their network infrastructure. if
you really want a open Internet connection then buy a PDA or a data card.
use your own private Internet connection and if you want to learn then get
your own infrastructure or join such institution which provide such
courses...

>>>> OMG.. OP is using his company email id.. :o

>>You are probably not reading the email properly. I have NO access to any
kind of email, what were you thinking when you said that?

i mean to say that if you are the person who want to learn all this stuff
and do it against that institution then you shouldn't have used the
institution's email ID.. this will reveal not only your identity.. but the
company in which you are working, that could be a threat to you as well as
your company too, do what ever to yourself, no one will say anything... but
to the company.. they never gonna spare you for that..

ethical hacking: this term is rather oxymoron.. hacking is never illegal..
cracking is..

Actually it is a tautology

http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Atautology

oxymoron is when two terms are contradictory,

http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Aonxymoron

for example: 'unlawful hacking' or 'ethical cracking' (which, incidentally the 
OP wants us to believe is all that he was wanting to /learn/)

If begun with "curl http://IP:80" which will return (without
redirecting) the contents which can be fiollowed further before
deep-diving into tcpdump nervous system, may provide a better clue.

I have resolved many such issues when adding webservers to Zabbix NMS.

Why would you need multiple pointers? Just call
http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/GtkEntry.html#gtk-entry-get-text
(gtk_entry_get_text) on each of those GtkEntry-s from your GtkButton
clicked handler?

hi,

although I am on fedora 12 and kmail is behaving fairly well, there is still 
one problem that I have been having with all versions of kmail for the past 
several years. I have two main accounts - personal account being the default. 
Every now and then - about once a month, kmail fails to fetch mails from the 
personal account. I telnet into the mailserver and confirm that it is up and 
that there mails in the Q. Then I go to the settings and retype the password 
for POP and SMTP, and kmail starts fetching again. Any clue as to why this is?

One approach is to keep the pointers to the entry widgets global. But 
keeping them global is a bad idea, makes the code hard to read and
maintain.

The other solution is to create a structure for your application, that
keeps track of application state including the pointers to the entry
widgets.

struct AppState {
   GtkWidget *entry1;
   GtkWidget *entry2;
   GtkWidget *entry3;

   ... other application state ...
};

  1. Create an instance of the state structure in main()
  2. Update the state structure when the widgets are created.
  3. Pass its pointer to all g_signal_connect() invocations.

HTH.

Vijay

Never had the problem with KDE 3.5.x.

However, with KDE 4.3.1/KMail v 1.12.2 (openSUSE 11.2)  I am
experiencing similar symptoms with *one* specific account only and  It
is much worse than your scenario.  The password is good (even though I
have checked save password) is good for that KMail session.  I have to
reenter the password, for that specific acct. each time I start up a
KMail session.

No idea what could be the problem.   I am planning to open a bug
report on KMail.

this could be related to the fact that I have never succeeded in having two 
accounts with different passwords in any version of kmail. If you save the 
different password, the password for the other account gets overwritten. I have 
'solved' it by having the same password for all my mail accounts - although it 
is a security hole.

Great start. My wishes.

My suggestion is , why cant you start the Kovilpatti FOSS Club or
Kovilpatti Linux User Group instead of Sakthi FOSS Foundation.

Because Kovilpatti is public to all, the name is not for an
individual. But Sakthi is not to public. The name is for an individual
person,
not to public.

FOSS is for public, not for an individual only.

If you will start Kovilpatti FOSS Club or Kovilpatti Linux User Group
, then students/public will join with you to promote FOSS in
kovilpatti.
You give admin or writter permission to your city foss club bog .

So that, in future kovilpatti students will maintain / update the blog.

Think about it. or may we know, do you have any special reason for
created? www.sakthifossfoundation.blogspot.com? instead of
www.kovilpattifossclub.blogspot.com , etc.,

This is my openion.

Discuss with your city students/people and then confirm the name.

We will support to promote the FOSS in your city.

Let us rock! :-)

Is it happening when Internet gets disconnected for a while when Kmail is
running, then the Internet connection is re-established (Kmail continues to
remain open in between), then when you try fetching the mail, it pops up
 some error?

Nice name. But common people may, sakthi foss foundation is name of
some individual person think like me.

If you want this name as blog, the put some quotes on blog like "power of FOSS".

Form a team. ( Already you have team).

Now form a students team. Go to some college and conduct LDD.
Then surely you will get few students as volunteers.

With the help of the college students , then go to schools and promote FOSS.

Update your groupactivities in blog and mail to your group mailing list.

Keep rock !

I have 5 different accounts, each with a different password and bound
to different POP3/SMTP servers.  The problem I have is with one
specific account only.  Other four are OK; KMail auto fetches emails
from the respective POP3 server w/o any problems.

The access to the DVR system is SOLVED.

Thanks to all for giving helpful suggestions.

Last evening, just for the heck of it, I booted my laptop with Windows
XP, started Firefox and tried to connect to the DVR box (from one of
the ext_IP in the DNAT ruleset).

Lo behold, I got a pop up window for username/password.  Entered the
same and was prompted to install QuickTime plugin.   I also had to
download Quick Time.

After installing QuickTime and FF plug-in, I was able to connect to
the DVR system, select the camera and view the respective coverage.
The DNAT fw rule is OK.

>From my openSUSE 11.2 Linux desktop (same subnet as WinXP laptop), I
still get the "400 Bad Request" error.  Tried from an Ubuntu desktop
(10.04 + FF) and it is able to login into to the DVR but it was not
able to play the QuickTime stream (a separate problem).

The bottom line --  the problem is with my openSUSE 11.2 desktop setup :(

I wish the site admin(s) to add Facebook fans API, Twitter link icon, buzz
icon, etc . . onto the home page of ilugc.in once they are all set up, so
that, visitors would be aware of those existence and keep a track on all
instant updates by joining onto them correspondingly .. :)

Message-ID: <AANLkTim7zjBPvyNBUXpYqenktSKkRs7fqNv46fEv58qu@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,


     Finally we guys are translated the Ubuntu Manual in Tamil Localization.
So that every Tamil reader can easily read and understand the terms said in
that pdf. For this translation Kanchi lug guys work hardly and spend their
full efforts to complete this work. We also released that pdf as a Hard
copy.

     Translated pdf has been released by Kanchi LUG in Ubuntu 10.04 release
party celebrated at Kanchipuram.

      Still Some words want to freeze for standard purpose. That work will
be completed in Phase 2 and released within 10 days.

      You can download that pdf in
http://ubuntu-tam.org/avanam/lucid-lynx/ubuntu-manual-ta.pdf


https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual/lucid-e1/+pots/ubuntu-manual/ta/+translate
>From this you can give Suggestions and Corrections about translated terms.
By this we can make the pdf more easy to read by all tamil readers.


Thank you.

Congratulations!  Although I cannot read/write Tamil, I am sure it
will be helpful to many who want to use Linux.

Congrats Kanchilug.

I already saw that, and could see clearly the pains you all have endured.
Sometimes I used to think It is more difficult to translate than to write on
your own.

Well Done to all.

You can install it via external hard disk or a USB drive, thing is it
must be a bootable disk.

Sorry for the top post.

Search online for unetbootin.  It can convert most ISO images into a boot
able usb stick.  Change your BIOS settings to boot from usb.

You can also check the ubuntu manuals for alternate boot and install
methods.

Hello,

I watched my brother using the Google Chrome web browser the other day,
and it had this cool feature. When you use one of those upload forms to
upload files, Chrome displays a little box that goes "Uploading 45%..."
or something like that.

Does anyone know of an extension to Firefox which does this?

Folks, appreciate your suggestions/responses but for some reason
we started top posting to the list with or without sorry. Can we 
please stick to the list protocols? Also I see no reason why we ask
sorry first and then top post? am I missing something here?

You are missing the fact that top posting is not a sin.

Sometimes when you are busy you do that.

I have done that many times.

It is not as sinful as people imagine.

If you want LUG to get responses from busy people responsible for
businesses and so on(the people that know what they are talking)
then you have to put up with some inconveniences like this.

Well, I'm coming to the point exactly what you're talking about but the reply adds 
some flavor like privately owned approach to the list. What I was trying to say in 
my previous note we need to be more practical to all level of folks joining in this list. 
It's not something I'm forward on something today than others and follow things which may 
no where related to sin or any other related terms. It's all about how our own protocols being
followed or keep the things simple as it as. More over, it may well reasonable piece (quote from 
your reply) and I've no where near to that but I'm bit puzzled though.

Although I have never used browser on my mobile phone, I would imagine
it is not as convenient to edit the messages to look trim and proper
(as from a desktop or laptop).

Perhaps this was the case.   To some degree I agree with Girish; we
should not get too bent on rules and start missing valuable
information.    It happened to me way back where the moderator
rejected my answer  to a question that was posted on one of the ILUG
mailing lists.    Unfortunately, no one else had a clue to the OP's
problem and it remained unanswered.    A private email to the
moderator turned into an acerbic rant about posting rules and I signed
out of the list

I am considering a third system (desktop) with LKVM capability on the

As usual my answer is not going to help you. ;)

I run qemu all the time....

http://aplawrence.com/Girish/qemu.html

It is emulation technology and it does not have any dependency but
this is my idea of virtualization. ;)

I have heard of KVM but dunno a thing about it.

Have you run qemu anytime? It is incredibly useful for my product dev
activities.

It took me a very long time to really get comfy with it.

Why? Even this project was born out of the power afforded by qemu.

http://liveusb-openbsd.sf.net

I hope I did not end up hijacking this thread.

If you are familiar with the qemu options, then transition to the
qemu-kvm tools should be close to no-op (at least that is my
understanding not having used qemu at all).

I find top posting as annoying as everyone else, but in my situation
it's either that or no response at all.

Problem is that smart phone email clients (GMail app on Nokia
E series, and Android) do not permit you to edit the quoted reply.
It's not a question of convenience either, top posting is the only
available option.

Bit slow but fast enough for me on OpenBSD at least.

I can claim to have some patience I suppose. Even as I speak I run
qemu.

But KVM is a linux thing right?

And there is kqemu acceleration on OpenBSD already. I don't usually bother.

Everything just works and is fast enough for me.

I never guessed that both of us were really talking the same thing.

For me cloud/virtualization/emulation/vmware/xen/whatever means qemu. ;)

It's best to go with the most compatible hardware to ensure that
you can always try other hypervisors without problems.

This box which I use this at work is 1yr old now:

AMD Phenom X4 9650 processor
Asus M3N78-EM mother board
2 x 4GB OCZ Gold RAM
Dual port Intel EEPro NIC
2 x 750GB SATA HDDs

100% compatible with CentOS/Xen, and commercial Citrix XenServer.

VMWare ESX does not work --  cannot detect SATA controller.

KVM (untested) should not have any problems since most issues arise
due missing kernel drivers for disk controllers, NIC, etc.  So it comes
down to which distro/kernel you will be using to run KVM.

 scope for the new suggestions are limited, since you selected the topic.
Well I like to make few points as a guidelines [1] for announcing the topics
for the monthly meet.

   1. To do for Speakers


   -  Name of the Topic .
   - A brief note on the topic not exceeding the 50 words [numbers doesn't
   matter really].
   - URL for the subject.
   - Any samples codes or presentations if the speaker want to share with
   the participants.
   - Please send a off-line [private] mail to the lug organisers stating
   your interest, appropriate SUBJECT to the mail and  with the above mentioned
   details.
   - It would be easy for him consolidate the list of the talks for the
   monthly meet and publish it in the list as a single thread instead of every
   flooding the list.

Its my suggestions,
what did you say?

Identifying a locatily that is easily reachable on road is one way..

Chennai is huge. 1 tenth of the whole of Tamilnadu is dumped here.

Ways to have multiple LUGs within chennai need to explored, than pushing 
everyone towards a single meet.

there shall be multiple meets on a given date at many places.. 

but as usual, need more physical volunteers, till then ILUGC meet & NRCFOSS 
meet :-)

Sorry for sounding pessimistic . But finding 3 talks for 3 different
scenarios in one day of the month  is quite challenging !  Added to
that the physical numbers being below 20 . Maybe its an idea to bring
more participants as well as audience from different fields of
expertise .

>2.7 how to bring more people to monthly meets?

        I would suggest to plan something like announcing via
different medium(friend to friend ) a newbie talk which would IMHO
gather more newbies . Once you get the numbers the above thing(3
talks) would become easy .

Pavithran

I've given the admin privileges to four other guys in that facebook page,
its Azhagunambi Welkin, Aishwarya, Arun SAG, Shrini (our new office boy :P )
I have also enabled the posting permission for fans.. which means not only
the admins but all members can post useful foss infos
in our ilugc facebook page wall
Do share interesting stuffs there.

And the Web admins can now add our facebook fan page url in the website (
ilugc.in),
if possible install a drupal module/plugin which automatically posts infos
from website to the facebook fan page whenever a new blog post is done

Just noticed that facebook notes can import xml
so no need to add drupal modules for the site to publish infos to facebook
fan page wall.
I've added the xml link of our ilugc.in to import web contents automatically
to facebook (checks every hour for new content)

 I am taking CSIR-NET exam on Jun 20th 2010. So I removed my topic from the

We do use proprietary software personally, but still, as ILUGC?

They are the recent media where mass people hangout.
As we need to reach people, we have to go to their virtual worlds.
people discuss about many things there.
Why cant they discuss about ilugc there?

> We do use proprietary software personally, but still, as ILUGC?

As we dont have opensouce alternate to facebook, orkut, hi5,
people can discuss about ilugc there, till we get some opensource alternate.

Just like mailing lists, irc channels, websites, these social sites also
a way to reach people.

We can announce our events, meetings there.
so that, the people not in mailing list also get these informations.

Ofcourse, this is an experiment to reach people virtually. :-)

ILUGC promotes FOSS.

Do you think promoting ILUGC is not promoting FOSS?

off-course people can discuss about ILUGC anywhere.

But can ILUGC encourage it?

The way out is to call for/ announce development of such an alternative and 
call for contributors & sponsors :-)

mailing lists, irc, drupal/ django that powers the two sites of ILUGC are 
free. but these social sites?

> so that, the people not in mailing list also get these informations.

there can always be fans out there, any where, not wearing a formal cap of 
ILUGC doing all these stuffs for ILUGC...

Wearing a formal cap, such things should be strongly discouraged, IMHO. 

Whenever a clarification of any kind on Proprietary softwares are sought here, 
I have seen voices that says, this is not the place to ask.

I wish a similar approach is reflected in this regard too.

Hi,

I am not sure whether lug can enter with proprietary social networking
sites, but few of the lugs are using social networking sites.

<rant>
ahem,please do not ask whether these are cycle/auto rickshaw lug's, reason,
i am not aware of it .
</rant>

CLUG has a presence on following social networking websites:

   - LinkedIn <http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=157695>
   - Facebook <http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=217799745659>

Linux user group of davis has a presence on following social networking
websites

   - LUGOD Group on LinkedIn <http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=35879>
   LUGOD Group on Facebook<http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=20055331344>


from the perspective of getting the crowd, last meet we had only 18 members.
We need to do something in order to bring the crowd, in my opinion, if this
is an experiment, why not to give a try and record  the inference of it?.

regards,

Dear all,

I Saw shrini  mail in the mailing list regarding minutes of meet  and he
mention that we conduct the fossconf  either in jaya,ssn or south tamilnadu
colleges like mepco.i am belongs to National Engineering college which is
established before 25 years and about 6 ug degree and 7 pg degree is
there.It is located in Kovilaptti and situated in the National Highways,just
3 km from railway station,2 kilometer from bus stand and about 72 kilometer
from madurai airport(which in means there is a good connectivity to reach
our college in easy manner).we inaugurate the foss club before 3 months and
we now conduct evening classes on FOSS,Practice fedora13 for our sessions.As
a president of National FOSS Club i propose my interest to conduct the
fossconf in our college.if you guide us in this aspect,i believe we do the
conference a great success and i assure that if you give opportunity,we do
our best to our extend.

18 is a good number.

There are several other good ways, than to formally embrace a proprietary 
solution.

1) Start a foundation. Get donations. I am yet to see one such foundation in 
India yet.

Support few people full time in it.

Every successful Free Software project has a foundation to back. 

2) Take ILUGC in the language of the State. More crowd will understand & turn 
out.

3) Identify a location for the conduct of meeting that is easily reachable.

4) Having set an example for others to follow all these years I wish, we do 
not not fall for fame or want of crowd. 

My last mail on this thread :-) I have said whatever I need to, on this.

Hello friends,

I joined this group recently, I am working with Linux server more than 7
yrs,

The following article gave me a little shock, as a linux user we also should
have
a good spyware scanner.

+1 There is identi.ca instead of twitter. And in light of recent privacy
issues over Facebook it is not ideal to endorse it in official way through
ILUGC.

Even if you had a spyware scanner do you think it would have caught
the backdoor trojan that is embedded into the source code of the
Unreal IRC code?  I think not.

Similar incidents have happened in the past.   This compromise points
to lack of checking by sys admins of the servers - i.e file integrity
checking.   Such exploits can be done on any system for software for
any OS platform where the sys admins have gone to sleep :D   This is
amply reflected by the feedback posts on the article which you may not
have read.

<quote>
It appears the replacement of the .tar.gz occurred in November 2009
(at least on some mirrors). It seems nobody noticed it until now.
</quote>

(Notice that the compromise was on the mirrors and not on the
sourceforge server)

IMO, the article is a FUD and shows the lack of sys admin knowledge on
the part of the author.

My two cents.

It is an isolated incident. zdnet is a microsoft mouth piece . The article's
aim is to spread FUD.

Hi,

If Spreading open source via proprietary media is bad,
any open source enthusiast should not use the following services.

1. sourceforge.net
2. code.google.com
3. github.com
4. bitbuket.org

except launchpad as that is the only open source solution for hosting our code.

:-)

All these social media sites are just media to expose our activities.

This is an experiment to get new faces to ilugc.
Any social media content can be created by anyone.
They are not official. they just reflect what we discuss in official list.

Just looking media as just a media.
We will be happy if ilugc activities are published in any newspaper, TV, radio
regardless thinking what  proprietary software they are using.
same is applicable here also.

Thanks.

Hello Arun Khan,

I just want to make our users aware about the threat.
as you said the sysadmins should not be lazy or over confident,
irrespective of the platform they works.
Thanks for your reply.

Hello Arun S.A.G,

Thanks for you information about zdnet.
But zdnet also posted some good articles about Linux,
like 10 top Linux rescue  tools  and information about the Giant
companies are switching to Linux from Windows over security concerns.
Thats why I post the article in our group.


I am using Ubuntu 10.04 UE at my home.
could you please suggest any good scanner to find the trojans/worms
in the linux environment.

Thanks

If ILUGC runs a Newspaper, TV, radio, it has to make use of Free Software is 
the point. 

any news agency can publish any news happening anywhere, particularly when it

that is out right rude, and possibly you are missing a lot of people
and information there. But, yeah I do agree that top posting is no
good, but if that is the only option then apologising before doing it
is fine I guess.
And unfortunately there is more top posting in this thread that in any
other I have seen in the recent times on the ILUGC list.

Cheers

Requesting you to be spiritual and not religious, at least i am not getting
clear with the reason why you are asking to keep ilugc away from the virtual
world. I see like this, there may be some people in the virtual world, who
would need our support for training and making career in foss. It is the
idea of helping individuals through the 'per se' organisation called ILUGC.
I feel *delivering result* is more important than setting up of foundation
and collecting donation.

As long as you are not running any Internet facing services on your
desktop you system integrity should  be OK.  I always use the default
NAT option of the DSL modem/routers and get a "natural" firewall for
my network.

As for scanners None.   To the best of my knowledge the scanners that
run on Linux are for (possibly) detecting Windows based Virus.

Use "aide" or "tripwire" and save the initial sig files on a read only
media like CD/DVD; use cron to schedule aide/tripwire to compare the
sigs with the "ro" version and report differences.
BTW, this should be done after you do a fresh install as well as
security/bug updates from "trusted" repos.

as other fellow members of the list mentioned, it's about trying to get some 
good things done with the help of Opensource, FSF, FOSS, ILUGC etc., if I 
talk about the Java (Sun Micro Systems) then it's now owned by Oracle Corp, 
I can't write my java applications with this kind of thought.

Well, what makes you so concerned? How about firmwares running on network and 
storage engineering perspective? are we enjoying them freely? We just need to 
be practical. If facebook/twitter going be listed on Newyork Stock Exchange 
or NASDAQ on tomorrow, what do you then say? We must need to get out of this 
circle (especially when we associated with the public forum).

Hi All

I have a dual boot box, Intel 2.5GHZ,2gig ram, 250G HDD
dual booting XP and DEbian 5.0.

Today morning, it did not boot WIN when I wanted to do some
Office work (presentation with AtuoCad drgs).

Evening I returned, booted into Debian without any problem,
browsed net, e mailed.

Now from Debian side I am able to see WIN Partitions and see the
files also. I can view pictures, play movies etc, but WIN will not
boot.

I face a blue screen with message " UNMOUNTABLE BOOT VOLUME"

Message-ID: <AANLkTinH6wIPjVdC4VKfa6ukpOQH30_dL3aIl3V0Gz0l@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a 2GB Transcend USB pendrive formatted with FAT32 filesystem. All of
a sudden today, the USB device did not mount when I plugged it in.

I checked "lsusb" and the usb device was recognized. But when I executed
"sudo fdisk -l", the filesystem was not recognized. When I also executed
"dmesg|tail", I found that the partitions were not recognized.

The output of the three commands can be found at "
http://pastebin.com/MHZtTRH6".

I have used testdisk to recover data, but when I executed testdisk, only my
internal hard disk was displayed, I could not choose the USB device. Is
there a way to recover the data in the pendrive?

you really did not mention what you are trying to do in the so called
gtk programs. Anyway as a short description,

system() : allows you to run a binary from inside a C program, but you
don't have any control on the executing program, you just have to wait
until the call to system returns

there are other interfaces you can use though :

popen() : is very similar to system, but it also allows you to either
pipe input to the stdin of the binary you are executing, or pipe the
stdout of the binary you are executing and access it via a file
descriptor in the C program. You can only do one at a time and the
program waits for popen() to return.

the exec family of functions : allow you to run a binary executable
and you can control the process since when you run it a new process is
forked and you have control over the child.

may be a little more info on what you are trying to do will allow you
to decide better.

Cheers
Satish

plug in the usb disk and then wait for a few seconds (~ 5 seconds) and
see what you have in the kernel log ( run the command "dmesg  | tail
-n 30" on a terminal). Copy paste the output of that command in a
reply so that we can see if it is just an error with the partition
table (or something similar) or a bigger issue.

oops , sorry I guess I missed out the links in the first mail, if you
are looking at recovering the data on the drive the best thing to do
is to create an image of the disk and then do whatever you want to do
on that image. Use dd.

For example , say your pen drive is attached to the node /dev/sda2 ,
do something like this :

dd if=/dev/sda2 of=drive_backup

then you will have all the data on the drive also on the file image
drive_backup, you can then try recovery tools on the image.

Yes, but the problem is the partition itself (/dev/sdb* or similar) is not
recognized at all. I have also pasted the output of "fdisk -l" command and
it shows that the device "/dev/sdb" is not recognized. So creating an image
of the drive is not possible using "dd" i guess.

Hello Arun Khan,

Thanks a lot for your info about securing the system.
I am not running any internet services and   I have installed clamav
already.

But I haven't installed other suggested apps. I will start use those
security
applications.

Thanks,

While some of the lugs which i pointed earlier has the social networking
dimension,
I do not see this as evil. may be my opinion, i leave it to the list for
arriving its own decision

Some interesting facts about the last meet population

Jaya engg college guys = 5 (at the fag end of the session 2 left)
Kanchi lug boys           = 2
Shrini + 2 brothers       =  3
My kids + myself         = 3
Vatsala+ Raman          = 2
                                ----------
    Total participants:    15(13 at the end of the session)
                                ----------
Sorry for misquoting as 18 earlier, no freshers, all are directed/usual
members, at this rate we will find a place next to tigers in the endangered
list of animals.  An A/C hall which has a seating capacity of nearly 50
people had merely 15 people. The infra structure  provided by iit-m was
excellent but not at the best/optimum use.

IMHO, We are talking something else instead of addressing the core issue of
bringing the crowd.Social networking is one of the action items, i humbly
invite all for the next meet. Your presence is the biggest present.I will
close this as my last reply in this thread.

I do not think it is rude - if you look at mailing lists, you find that the 
best, well thought out, well formatted posts always come from people who are 
extremely busy. In fact I often wonder how these people manage to do this - 
they must be working 25 hours a day. The sloppily formatted posts come not 
because the person is busy, but because the person has too high an opinion of 
himself and does not care about the feelings of others.

nice point* *Ramadas. because that is the way their business model generates
more money to them. They don't want to be in open world.

This what I am expecting.  Thyagarajan you are in write direction. Can you
create new thread on this topic? So that people will discuss.  I am also
very interested to discuss this core issue in different perspective .

I don't thing making some kind advertisement on social networking will bring
good people to open world.  It depends upon how people are using  social
networking. I seen lot of people ( new generation) they are not interested
to waste their time to follow friends and girl friend on social networking.
I request you please think some other way to bring new faces to ILUGC.

if by taking image you mean to say you want to take backup of the
current OS then you can consider using the 'dd' command:

here are some details regarding it:

If the existing disk fails, you can boot from the external drive
backup and have your system back instantaneously.

This series will make a DVD backup of hard drive partition:
Code:

dd if=/dev/hda3 of=/home/sam/backup_set_1.img bs=1M count=4430
dd if=/dev/hda3 skip=4430 of=/home/sam/backup_set_2.img bs=1M count=4430
dd if=/dev/hda3 skip=8860 of=/home/sam/backup_set_3.img bs=1M count=4430

And so on. This series will burn the images to DVD+/-R/RW:
Code:

wodim -dev=/dev/hdc --driveropts=burnfree /home/sam/backup_set_1.img

and so forth. To restore the from the backup, load the DVDs in order,
and use commands like these:
Code:

 dd if=/media/dvd/backup_set_1.img of=/dev/hda3 bs=1M conv=sync,noerror

Load another DVD
Code:

dd if=/media/dvd/backup_set_2.img of=/dev/hda3 seek=4430 bs=1M conv=sync,noerror

Load another DVD
Code:

dd if=/media/dvd/backup_set_3.img of=/dev/hda3 seek=8860 bs=1M conv=sync,noerror

and so forth.

Other solutions for consideration:  Clonezilla, Partedmagic, RescueCD,
G4L (Ghost4Linux).   All have documentation on how to back up systems.

dump restore is the geekiest and the best way. Works incredibly
well for all situations.

I rely on it in a big way as it is a BSD thing and backported to linux.

Thyagu,

How do you think this will help in bringing in more crowd to ILUGC 
monthly meets?

We already have two websites (not to mention this list), you think this 
is not enough??

Even if ILUGC goes on Facebook/Twitter, we still need to get the word 
out to others to follow ILUGC on Facebook/Twitter.
We might as well just ask them to follow the websites and this list.

a point that I am frequently making on LUG lists is that ILUGC has more 
activities in a month than the rest of the LUGs in India have in a year. And 
there are so many children of the parent LUG that meet all the time all over 
the state that one can not even count them! In a big city, getting to a 
meeting is always difficult - and to add to the difficulty, more and more members 
are getting married and hence have much less time to turn up on a Saturday 
afternoon or on a Sunday. Mumbai LUG manages around one meet a year - and even 
then not more than 5 or 6 people turn up. Same is the case in Hyderabad and 
Bangalore. Pune is an exception in that they have several running courses 
where member can meet each other.

The scene where the people turning up are the old regulars and a few new 
students, will continue. One thing which will push up the attendance is a good 
talk - we encourage first timers to give talks at the LUG to get experience in 
a friendly atmosphere - at the same time if we can work at getting highly 
experienced people giving really good talks, the attendance will jump. When I 
am in Chennai, I try to attend - but I attend out of loyalty rather than to 
hear the talks, although I find I learn something new even when a raw newbie 
talks. Hyderabad lug, some years back used to take pains to get good speakers, 
and I have seen audience of upto 40-50 people for such talks. Which means we 
cannot sit back and wait for volunteers - we must find out who can give good 
talks and twist their arms and make them come through.

This is  just an experiment, I am not sure how it pans out to be, but, the
bone of contention of my argument is give a chance to such a venture and
lets record the inference,even if this turns other wise, we have nothing to
lose.

Your are right, content is the king, I have started contributing contents to
ilugc website and encourage others to do so, and our co-ordinator has some
plans for the forth coming meets, this messages need to be propagated to
masses, i think social networking fan club of ilugc is one of the action
items which we discussed in the last meet.This is an idea, lets give a fair
chance and record its merits

It's critical that /dev/hda3 is unmounted before you run dd.
Or at the very least it should be mounted read-only.

Problem with a backup which is not file system aware is that you
may end up using too much backup space/media.  Eg. if a 100GB
file system is only 5GB filled, your backup will take all 100GB.  A
file system aware backup will only consume 5GB of backup media.

Further, restoring through dd means that the target partition must
be exactly the same as the source partition.  Eg. if you backup a
100GB partition using dd, you cannot restore into a 60GB partition
or a 160GB partition.

As others have suggested file system aware backup tools like
dump/restore, CloneZilla, etc are better in these aspects.

Friends.

1. Social media activities are not official
2. They reflect the content from list and website
3. It is experiment to announce our activities to public
4. We are announcing in list, website, but still getting less no of
people in meetings.

We need people for all our activities.

If we reach more people, a few may come to meet.
A few of them may help to our activities.

If you check the threads,
We still not get any result for the request.
"Need your help - Get a place for workshop"

We still do not get ANY assistance from anyone in the list so far.

If we announce this in the social media, and
if anyone looks at it and helps to get a place for workshop,
Should we accept it or not?

To reach the public and students
who are not in the mailing list,
who dont know about ilugc,
who dont know our website,
Is there any other easier, effective, FOSS based way?
If it is there, please share the details on another new thread.

We can start a new thread on "How to bring more people to ilugc meets?"
But it will be nice if we all discuss that topic in person in the next meet.
I invite all the interested people to discuss on this topic to the next meet.

Let us meet in person in the next meet and discuss about the following topics.
1. The social media topic
2. Bringing more people to meet

Let us stop the thread here.

Thanks.

Regards,
Shrinivasan

Hi,
IMHO the following points may bring more crowd to ilugc meets
1. We can think of distributing T-Shirts at the end of each meet
2. By around 4.30pm (with the hope that meet starts at 03.00pm)
provide tea and snacks

Thanks

Eppidi intha ideas? ;)

Super but I am quite sure such ideas will do no good.

Once in a while it is okay. But can you distribute/sell T-shirts at
every LUG event? Every month?

Providing tea and snacks is not a good idea. Instead we go to Gurunath
or somewhere after the meet. That is nice.

People form groups on their own and have fun.

This is what is workable.

My thoughts are

1) One expert speaker presenting  a talk.
2) One beginner talk.
3) One OSS project/product demo
4) Lightning talk(s).
5) Job opportunity discussions( probably this at gurunath).

At the end of the session, the attendee should feel that he had a worthy
time in learning something new.

Just thinking way tooo loud, but if there can be a community project
that everybody gets to hack at and that gets discussed at least for a
while in the meet, I guess there might be more people for the meet.
For instance, it might not prioritize a meet in case I am not working
anywhere close to the topics to be discussed there.

Or simpler yet, if there is a talk that shows a good hack demo on
something very fundamental. Say change something in a device driver
and explain the differences. Again, just thinking loud. I could just
be crazy to make these points ;)

Hi,

I feel that we are falling short in the content part of the session.If we
deliver content rich sessions, i am sure we will have good crowd.
At this juncture, it is imperative that we need the support of  expert
speakers.

There are plenty in our group who can present good content rich sessions,
the name that flashes in my mind are

<partial_list>
<ul>
Raja Superman
Raaman Pandarinathan
Girish
Vaidhy Gopalrathnam mailrangam
Vamsee Kanakala
<outoftown>
Sakthi Kannan
Asokan Pitchai
Bharathi Subramanium
</outoftown>
</ul>
</partial_list>

@Coordinator : Could you please shoot a off line mail and request the
speakers on their availability
Personally, I would love to learn more on perl from the trio's Raja,Raman
and Girish

I agree with this. We should schedule atleast 3 talks totalling about an hour atleast catering to different interest group. 

As I have suggested during the meet we can have a series of talks

a. LPI/RHCE syllabus based - suitably modified to be generic
b. Teach langugages not taught in regular curriculam like  perl,python,php,ruby - systematically in a series of talks


In my opinion best cocktail would be 4 talks - total not more than 1hr 30mins like this
a.LPI/RHCE/Sysadmin talk -20 minutes
b.Programming series talk - 20 minutes
c.Demo of some application like graphic, animation,netmeeting etc. -20 minutes
d.A talk by student/newbie on what he/she learnt/used recently -20min
e.General disscussion

If we get some highlevel topics like device drivers, cryptography etc., we can add that also by reducing duration of talk-1 and talk-2.

There can be special sessions for newbies - from installtion onwards - if there is a demand.

personal teaching aka private tuitions will be charged,  only talks on ILUGC free.

My 2 rupee solution :
Ilugc officially dents at Identi.ca while our members re dent them in
identi.ca which if linked to fb/twitter will appear in their SNS's .
So it will be something like .  " next meet on 15th july -
http://bit.ly/sfrf " which in FB would translate into image and
description .  Interested people can click on 'like' and 'comment ' .
Similarly tweeps can retweet with their own tags !

That way officially ILUGC is not connected to any closed SNS/website
while the volunteers pread the message across in the closed SNS .
Hence we would get the advantage of the organisation being open while
volunteers try to get the numbers ( personal will )

+1 to that . we need to avoid them officially while at the same time
individuals who hope to get numbers can use them as per their will .

What is your goal?

As far as I know this is not something anybody has attempted.

If you can see a process that is running how can you affect its operation?

You can do that only by writing to its memory space. One way you
can achieve this is by writing to its stack using buffer overflows or by
 misusing the predictability in malloc or even by hijacking a TCP
connection by guessing the sequence number arithmetic.

Just by seeing a process running using top or ps does not get you
anywhere, does it?

So people don't try to hide processes like this. Instead they try to
do privilege dropping, revocation, chroot to /var/empty and by running
 with lower privileges as some other user than root disallow rogue
 processes to take control.

malloc space randomization and canary in stack growth ensures
protection against buffer overflow attacks.

Read papers by Theo on address space protection. propolice and
related technologies are used for guarding against buffer overflows
which are a bane of the C programming language...

At the time of every month ILUGC meeting, We have to decide some new topic
that should create interest among the people (it may be new technology,tool
what ever in FOSS).  Based on the topic we have to call expert people to
give talk. The thing is we have to decide the topic in different
areas(System Administration,Networking,Security,Linux Programming,Embedded
Linux,Scripting Languages etc...).


> 2) One beginner talk.
> 3) One OSS project/product demo
> 4) Lightning talk(s).
> 5) Job opportunity discussions( probably this at gurunath).
>

The remaining will be open to all.

6) . We have to send the topic at least one week before. If possible we need
to come up a way to announce the presentation topics and details to
surrounding colleges, university (may be schools) to all departments.
Putting more effort on academic(faculty,student,researcher  etc...) people
will give more result.

7). We need to find out an innovative way that has to force more (those)
people to attend the presentation.

8). We have to create an innovative learning modules for new comers.
Innovative learning modules means it has to teach open source philosophy,
create passion and enthusiasm among the new comers and it should make Linux
as more comfortable platform for them compared to M$dog .  Once we started
creating passion and enthusiasm among new comers they will create some more
enthusiast. This may give some more result for us.

>From my experience I had realised below core issue :

But generally what is happening is most of the activities,talks and
presentation bases on LAMP. Very less people from LAMP back ground  are
using Linux when they goes industry, the rest of the people are choosing
WAMP as platform. Those WAMP people never make any contribute for us or
FOSS. That is why I am saying that we need find out a way to create passion
and enthusiasm among the new  people.

putting more effort on other areas like System
Administration,Networking,Security,Linux Programming,Embedded Linux etc...
will give more power for us.

It will give more growth. I request you please increase both talks around 30
minutes. The talk should have continuity.

Rewrite top to hide process based on the name of the binary - just a
wild thought!

A way to do this is to create an alias named top, that uses text
processing to filter out the name of the binary one wishes to hide.

All the suggestions seem to be targeted on the tech savvy.
Unless Linux can be used on a desktop at home by the entire family, it's
difficult for it to spread.

My own experience - I forcibly installed a Linux distro on my home computer.
I was forcibly made to revert back to Windows because my wife could not run
a 300 kb Windows game on it. I did try Wine, but it was neither easy
or worthwhile as the performance was bad. Simple. For her it was just not
the same...

I think we need talks and mainly demonstrations on "how to do things in
Linux which you were doing in Windows". Of course the regular ILUGC
participants can be bored, but what about Sundays? Probably once in 2 months
with more publicity to get the average potential user in?

Alternatively alias the application that should be hidden to some obscure/common name. 

In any case there tools other than top - ps for example does similar job. So it should be futile effort.

More information about what you want to hide, purpose etc., by OP may help others to suggest solution.

Sir, but the month of june is duration of summer vacations.. most of
the students and potential participants cannot participate while they
are at home.. which can be far away from chennai.. i guess if june
month statistics is considered, we should also have to consider the
holidays in colleges during this time so ilugc can never be
endangered.

dear luggies,

college students is the base peoples,we can able to mould and teach foss..so
if you people able put a circular to all colleges regarding our activities
and the regular meet.i am sure,atleast two from the college get entered and
we fill that 50 seated room.then we have to give brainstorming and group
discussion to peoples,it will so attractive rather than give more talk.this
is the project time,we people can insist all colleges to do projects in foss
and make an announcement that your project can review here means,they are
much interested and hope the awareness spread over.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikJQUNh9v-JpU8dYefObHrYN9eY1h1RathEYIFB@mail.gmail.com>

Dear LUG friends,

I am tasked with handling corporate training for a big company in
Chennai on 24th and 25th.

I owe a lot of gratitude to LUG for acting as Guinea pigs since I
learnt training only by giving free/charity
 talks for LUG.

Anyway leave that aside. In nature we find that the strong always
learn from experiences and emerge
successful when the weak continue to complain/give excuses. Look at
the Satyam episode for instance.

All politicos made away with cash but look at our poor Raju garu. ;)

Anyway the end result of my experience with LUG is that today I know
fairly well how to teach technology.

But I am not very good at linux kernel and device drivers. That is
where I want your help. I think it is a win
 win situation. By collaborating in a mailing list like this all of us
benefit and at least for a little while I can
turn attention away from silly topics like attracting people to LUG
meets and why GNU should be added to linux. :)

Don't worry. I like "nakkal" a lot like our Parthiban actor.

So here goes.

I have collected a bunch of training material here:

ftp://64.85.171.142/ldd/

And Shuveb advised me to use Shakthi Kannan's free material:

http://www.shakthimaan.com

I am sure Shakthi is more than willing to help in such a cause. He he. ;)

So now I want you guys to help me out.

No suspense how I got so much material out there.

I simple googled for " linux kernel device driver filetype:pdf"

That is all.

Kindly pour in your ideas and share your driver development expertise.

I will try my level best to ensure that I don't take more than I give.
I always ensure that.

I will perhaps give a training to LUG on this topic FREE OF COST.

This is my promise. But only after I get enough traction from you people...

-Girish

Chennai population is 50lakhs+ I was told. So it is better to look at our own faults than blaming on holiday, cricket math, football match,  etc. [I am not joking - cricket match was one of the explanation given for low turnout in an event sometime back]

The baseline is clear- ILUGC has to improve its standard of meetings to attract audience.

If you mean a replicated MySQL setup by 'master-slave architecture', 
it's as simple as doing an insert/update/delete on the master and 
checking if the slave got the change or not. If not, something went wrong.

Make sure you didn't make any changes to the master since you took the 
mysql binary log position. If you don't know what I'm talking about, 
carefully retrace the steps listed here, you should be good:

http://www.howtoforge.com/mysql_database_replication

If those steps are not entirely clear, this is where you can also refer 
to (if you're using a more recent mysql version like 5.1, check the 
relevant docs for that version):

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-howto.html

Hi Girish,

If you are new to Linux Device Driver Development, one thing you need to
keep your mind is  speed reading will not help here (I mean one day or one
week). It is a learning process. Ok

The below information may be useful  for you :

Greg-Kroah Hartmann (one of -stable kernel maintainer) has just released a
"Linux Device Driver Kit" which was made based on the latest kernel
available up to now (2.6.16.18). It is a cd image that contains everything
that a Linux device driver author would need in order to create Linux
drivers, including a full copy of the O'Reilly book, "Linux Device Drivers,
third edition" and pre-built copies of all of the in-kernel docbook
documentation for easy browsing. It even has a copy of the Linux source code
that you can directly build external kernel modules against.

For more info about Linux Device Driver Kit :
http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/ddk.html

How to use Linux Device Driver Kit?

Step 1: Download ddk from the below link

http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/ddk/

I am using like this :
$ mkdir ddk

$ cd ddk

$ wget
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/ddk/ddk-2.6.16.18.iso.bz2

Step 2 : Decompress the file using bunzip2

$ bunzip2  ddk-2.6.16.18.iso.bz2

Step 3 : Create a directory to mount the iso and mount the iso

$ mkdir -p /mnt/iso

$ sudo mount -o loop  ddk-2.6.16.18.iso /mnt/iso/

$ cd /mnt/iso/

that's it. Now you have all information that is needed to learn how to
create Linux Device Drivers.

I am also using below reference book :

1). Essential Linux Device Drivers by Sreekrishnan Venkateswaran
Publisher: Prentice Hall

It is very nice and complete Linux device driver book you may try.

I hope it will help you.

Thanks & Rg

We both are using Firefox 3.6.3 (Mozilla Firefox for ubuntu canonical
1.0) on Kubuntu 10.04. The only difference is his Kubuntu installation
is Fresh (done in last month) whereas I am upgrading mine since last 3
years. Do I need to install any package?

Installing / removing ttf-devanagari-fonts didn't help.

I do not agree. Those who have passion for linux will be more
interested and contributing than college students. I think more focus
is given to college students. I believe true audience does not lie in
colleges. Anyone with true interest in linux would be the right
audience. They will be more contributing than college students. Take
my case for exmaple my true venture into linux happened just after
finishing college as a fresher. I learnt linux from the documentation
done at redhat, linuxquestions.org. Whenever i was stuck ilugc helped
me a lot. Now i have grown considerbaly in my career as linux sys
admin. The passion for linux drives everything. So i suggest the best
way to get more people involved is through media, like when we have a
paid session on Linux kernel device drivers or something which can
held once a year or something which is well advertised like in
newspapers , Linux magazine and sites like linuxquestions.org. This
will be enough to bring people for the rest of the 11 months meet.
They will be so impressed by the talk that will drive them to meet and
present talk for the rest of the year. We should have something like
linux conference at chennai. A big show. I know something like this is
happening in bangalore and delhi. Something on the same lines arranged
in chennai by ilugc at a different schedule will not hurt i think.

Hi Vellingiri,

I am also looking for similar information. The first link I got
searching for "custom cd ubuntu" is
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization

I hope you also studied this documentation. Did you find that the
instructions here are not sufficient? What problems you faced?

Best regards,

Ma Sivakumar

I have not got into creating the live cd yet (would do in the coming
days). From reading the  documentation at
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomizationFromScratch

To install or upgrade a package you run (in the chroot environment)

apt-get install APPLICATION
OR
dkpg install .deb filename

I bet you will be facing the same rendering issues with other Indian
languages . Firefox now a days comes with pango enabled which is the
case with your friends firefox hence renders correctly.
http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/web/firefox tells that its built with it .
Type in your address bar about:buildconfig

It will show you if pango is enabled or not .


start your firefox with firefox --enable-pango

Pavithran

	released under BSD License?
Message-ID: <AANLkTil2hEsoCRD2ZmakRo6l8dk9JBBguc90QBJx2kkW@mail.gmail.com>

Dear LUG Members,

Imagine I develop a software [not dependent on any library at all] and
I "release" binary under GNU GPL, now as I understand from the GPL,
anyone in public who has the binary can legally force me to provide
him/her the source code in usable form. But imagine if the binary is
released under BSD license, while anyone can still reverse engineer
the binary and redistribute it legally, can he/she force me to provide
the source code?

I might be wrong but my understanding based on
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php suggests that
releasing only binary does not violate any condition of the license
but does that mean that BSD is not a "free" license? [freedom to see
and modify source code is not available]

Note: I have already googled for this a lot and the only thing which
comes up is that "if you take the BSD licensed code, modify it then no
one can force you to release the binary but I have not found any page
which talks about whether releasing code is actually necessary at all
in the first place when the licensing is BSD"

Message-ID: <AANLkTim89khRZA_NeQsnU7XVcQFCk421VSzVcLkqv9qh@mail.gmail.com>

Hello friends,

I am a newbie to linux user group chennai.
I am following the mail list for the past 2 weeks.
I am excited to know that ilugc is conducting summer workshops on open
source technologies and I was willing to join the workshops
But the problem was that i was not able to figure out the time of the meet.
Sometimes it seems that meets are postponed or canceled.
In such cases (as i am a newbie) i find it difficult to decide whether or
not visit MIT.
Some of my friends and colleagues are also interested to visit ilugc meets
and workshops but they are also facing the same problem (They are also
newbies to ilugc)

My humble opinion is that meets and workshops timing and status of the meets
should be easily accessible.
You may consider a calendering service like google calendar or something
like that.
I think this may attract more people to the workshops and meets.

Please excuse me if i posted this mail in wrong place.

Cheers,
Poomalairaj

Providing source code isn't necessary if using a BSD license.

Friends.

We have been going to colleges for FOSS intro sessions,
LDDs, or any FOSS related Events for a longer time.

We need to find a way to follow them up and guide their
activities towards FOSS.

I hope we create FOSS club in each college we have some sessions.

Thinking on creating a list of FOSS clubs to follow up.

Please update here the details of any FOSS club you know.

FossClub Name,
College / Group
Mailing List
Web address

Thanks a lot.

to be developed/examined collaboratively.

If you are releasing only binaries only and want to allow to be used free,
then it can also be a proprietary licence enabling free usage of the binary.

Most licences, excepting GPL, like BSD allow folks to take published source
code, modify them for their use/ products and choose whether to contribute
the changes back to the community or not. The core stipulation in most of
these is acknowledgement of copyright.

I agree.

Also, in my humble opinion, LUG could really help : those who just started
using Linux, and those who want to start using linux.  If we can have a
session of 15 minutes at every LUG meet - only for clearing the doubts, It
can be the most silliest thing too.

Though using Linux for the past 1 year, I still feel inadequate sometimes.
I use my laptop only for regular usage - mail, office documentation, and of
course games (in XP booting).  I have installed quite a few times - for my
collegues, friends and to some of my customers too.  Some of them feel
really good, but many fall back to the XP since  they find it difficult
sometimes to get printing, and others - like opening a MS Office Word
document (using OOO Writer) but finding the format is not disturbed, then
spend some time in getting back the document to the desired format, and
append the document, take print.  etc.

Sometimes, some of the PCs do not have the CD boot from BIOS etc, or
sometimes, the display resolution does not permit to see all the
installation options in the screen, etc,  so installing is not possible.  I
do not know how to install through text mode.

Those who come and attend - if they come to know all these, they will start
experimenting, and also will be able to feel more confident, and also feel
belonging to the mighty LUG.

Even if one new person comes comes to the LUG meet every month - just like
sabarimala - kannisami.  He will bring in one more new person the next
month.

this is my humble opinion.

with regards,

I guess no. May be you can try if chroot will help you in any ways.
Recently when I came across a similar situation. I had written a small
wrapper which will use yum to just download. Then install it using a rpm
prefix.

If you can detail your requirement, I can give you a more appropriate
answer.

just give sudo permission to the user

To accomplish follow this

-> edit /etc/sudoers

<username> ALL=/sbin/yum , /sbin/<yum-relate commands>
-> save and quit

That's it.

Have a Great day

My problem is that i dont have root permission in my system in office. I
need to install some packages for my development, usually i used to download
the source, install using ./configure --perfix=path to my local directory,
and use make and make install, i have added my local bin directory to
bash.rc file so that i can use all the installed commands.

Similar way i need to use YUM to install in my local repos, because its very
difficult to install a source having toomuch of dependencies .

I am really sorry on that because for installing package u must have root

for use  rpm and yum command

u must be root

Fedora doesn't use sudo by default so no.  Unless he has root access in
the first place, he wouldn't be allowed to configure sudo.

Yum does support a --installroot option which you can use to install
packages into a chroot which might be some location under your home
folder.  Maintaining a clean chroot like that wastes a lot of space
however.  You might want to talk to your office sys admin instead.

Subject: [Ilugc] magic of qemu
Message-ID: <AANLkTilrPoTvwsZLBSWDgF8hhdl4BBxf3Wt--kfWe08l@mail.gmail.com>

This article starts you up on the topic in a somewhat odd fashion.

aplawrence.com/Girish/qemu.html

The idea is that qemu is my idea of virtualization. I have never got
vmware or xen working.

Instead qemu gives me what I want without any pain at all. Only a
learning curve which you cannot avoid
anyway.

qemu works like magic since I bought a cookie box PC from Delta  a
year ago and I can run qemu without a hitch on it.

The shopkeeper Kamal tells me: "Sir, this PC is for jewellery shops
billing counters. It is not powerful."

"Is that so? I will purchase it since there is a DVD writer in it."

It is an Asus Mini PC.

I can run many instances of qemu in it without hardware acceleration
with KVM or whatever.

Of course there is no KVM on OpenBSD.

But I can run linux or OpenBSD or any OS as guest on qemu.

And I can bridge multiple qemu instances for full networking with
linux bridging or OpenBSD bridging.

In other words you can run any host with qemu and connect multiple
guests either running off qemu filestores that behave
like hard disks or liveCDs or just about any ISO image or even USB sticks.

It will take some time to learn all the possibilities it affords but
then you can get many benefits of virutalization with it.

It is an emulator and not a virtualization environment.

But I don't like to do hair splitting.

It give us the ability to run multiple machines without multiple power
chords and multiple ethernet connections.

Each machine instance is ideally a qemu filestore created with:

$ qemu-img create filestore.hd0 2G

filestore.hd0 is the name of the file of size 2 Gigs.

Some suggestions

1. apt-get has an option
  -d  Download only - do NOT install or unpack archives

You can use a similar option for YUM, get the packages downloaded
(with all dependencies)
http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/yum-downloadonly-plugin/

then install with option

--root=<directory>         Install on a different root directory. (say
your home directory)

Look at this link for some discussions.
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/RedHat/2006-04/msg00254.html

2. alternatively you can download the src rpms (here again you have to
work out dependencies.

3. Get root access or sudo permissions explaining your needs.

Probably chroot, yum --installroot and rpm --root --initidb are the
options for you.

I think this is what you need to do. [1]

Well on a Ubuntu system for example,  sudo  su -  and entering your own
password would get your root access if you are first user in the
system.  This would allow you to reconfigure sudo however you want.

Qemu without hardware acceleration is unusably slow as a virtualization
solution.  It is a very flexible tool but performance is not a strong
point.

Probably chroot, yum --installroot and rpm --root --initidb are the
search keywords for you.

I think this is what you need to do. [1]

1. chroot <some local path>
2. install yum in the local path (using src installation)
3. build rpm db for the new chroot using rpm --root <some local path>
--initidb
4. install the base packages yum ?installroot=<some local path> -y
groupinstall base 
5. install any package using yum install --installroot=<some local path>
<package name>

you can try google about the above steps. Below are few links which came
quite close.

Essentially because RPM is designed for an user with root access.   One
could argue that needs to be changed and perhaps it can be. 
http://rpm.org if you are interested in sending patches :-)

not only in ubuntu - in any distro, the first user - they guy who installs the 
system gets the root password. And unless he gives it to anyone else, no one 
else has it. Ubuntu just has a weird way of doing this.

btw, I find that pressing 'reply' to any message from you to the list results

My guess one would not be able to use yum without root permissions. To
my belief yum needs permissions to update the repo data, hence it might
fail. which means we might need yum itself in a different location which
will not depend on files which are on /etc, /var, etc.

Yep it is going to be a waste of space !!. +1 on the above.

It is a more complex problem than it might seem at first glance but it
can be solved if someone motivated enough is wiling to step up and

In Ubuntu, the first user is root for all practical purposes. Any
privileged application can be launched by the first user by entering
their own password and getting sudo rights.

This just makes it easier for a single user to manage their system
without asking them to login as root.

Yes, Ubuntu also allows it only to the first user (who has root privileges).

Traditionally, it isn't assumed that the first user is the same as the

I do this a lot of the time on my Debian shared hosting provider
servers.  I've installed custom PHP, Python, and lot of other
smaller binaries/applications from the deb binaries directly.

I have absolutely no root access, so no chroot, sudo or
other hacks.

I have a ~/opt folder inside which I extract all my debs and
manually move the the files into place.

Set $PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH (for the .so libraries), and
set manually the config file path to your binaries eg.
"-c ~/opt/etc/foo.conf".

You'll have to manually resolve pkg dependencies, etc.

The same method should work for any linux distro.

What applications/packages are you wanting to install?

Err,  avoid guessing.  I know this method works because we use it
extensively in Fedora to actually build packages using a system called Mock

+1, My first project officially was Safe Browsing Environment, that's
heavily on Virtualization.
We initially started with qemu for its light weight, but the performance was
way too slow without kQemu(the accelerator module for qemu).

Then we had to switch to VirtualBox for the only reason that kqemu doesnot
work on 64-bit :(

I accept qemu is good and we were surprised to see the snapshot feeature
working just fine, but the performance is little bad.

And also Qemu doesnot support Hardware virtualization, yes it is an
emulator. i know.

The safe browsing environment on QEMU was not safe from key loggers, but
virtualbox did that fine :)

For home users with 32-bit systems, QEMU is really good :)

Though my reply to this thread/discussion is not relevant to the subject, I
am sure that, this might help us to understand what students/staffs think
about Linux/FOSS in colleges.

Just I wanted to share my experiences I had during my visit to few districts
in Tamilnadu  in the past few days (Districts Visited: Namakkal, Erode,
Coimbatore, Thanjavur, Trichy)

A college in Namakkal decided to conduct summer courses on topics like J2EE,
.NET, Multimedia, Soft Skills and finally on Linux Administration too.

The no. of registrants were J2EE - above 90, .NET - around 55, multimedia -
around 45 and soft skills - around 70 and imagine for linux administration
it was just 14.

I was requested to take up the Linux administration course (7 full days
continously) and myself made a  request to the college/dept. authorities to
give complete control of the Lab for all sort of experiments by their
students who have taken up the Linux Administration course.

On the first day, I covered the Fedora-13 installation (via network and
kickstart) and asked all the students to install the same via network on
their PCs and everyone installed on their own without looking at others
(some students tried more than few times) and PULLED OUT all the multimedia
packages from the rpmfusion repository (which was part of my install box).
The next day, the strength was increased to 18 and many students notebooks
from hostel got into dept. lab and now students were busy installing
Fedora-13 in all their notebooks and took the complete Fedora-13 everything
repository (17,500+) packages and started distributing among themselves.

The feedback from a girl student was like this:  Sir, I feel working on
linux much easier than windows.

Second day, the feedback from Dept./Staffs was that, all further lab
practicals can be done using FOSS tools for CSE/IT/MCA/MSc.(SE) depts.

Next, I moved from Namakkal to Erode and met the principal Dr. Arun Parwate
of Erode Sengunthar Engineering College and discussed about Linux/FOSS and
he called up the HODs of CSE/MCA/MSc and we discussed about, doing a Faculty
Development Program for all dept. staffs.

Then, I moved to J.J. College of Engineering and Technology, Trichy and
discussed with Director in implementing FOSS in their institutions.  Myself,
sivabalan, Director, Principal, HODs of CSE/IT/MCA decided to implement FOSS
lab setup in all the dept. labs and also to conduct a FOSS awareness program
for all the students of CSE/IT/MCA in the next month.

Now, @ Periyar Centenary Polytechnic College (Autonomous), Thanjavur, where
I have setup a Fedora-13 Everything repository server for remote
installation in all client Desktops and the dept. of CT/IT have started
doing their practicals using FOSS tools and within a year, they would be
completely switching to FOSS environment (thanks to Mr. Karthick-IT/HOD for
his co-operation in implementing FOSS throughout the dept.) and also given a
talk to IT/CT students about the importance of using FOSS tools for their
practicals (as I am one of the Programme Advisory Committe member in this
institution for the dept. of CT/IT)

It is our strong commitment for education, ensuring that, no Proprietary
Softwares / Tools to be used in engineering / technical education and
everything need to be done using FOSOSS (Free / Open Source Operating System
/ Softwares) and we look forward everyone's help/support in conducting
FOSOSS workshops/awareness programmes/FDP in all colleges/institutions
throughout Tamilnadu.

Thanks and regards.

+1 For Proof of Concept and on the desktop qemu is perhaps OK but
definitely not for production servers.

Besides, both AMD and Intel server hardware come with hardware
virtualization - so may as well drive the VMs @ 200 Km/h rather than
50 Km/h :)

This is an excellent idea.  I have seen such a thing done by The
Chicago Computer Society.  In it's monthly meet, the first agenda item
was Q&A for 30-45 mins.   Any computer related question was welcome;
the attendance used to be high 40+

You can accomplish this by:

$ cd ~
$ cat .mysql_history

This is similar to .bash_history file that is logged for each user.
You can direct the history to another log file by using:

$ export MYSQL_HISTFILE=/home/webtest/dblog

Such discussions do take place in regular monthly meet. We normally keep that as last item.

Dear All,

Installed Wine - initially using Ubuntu Tweak, but when tried using it,
could not find it in the applications menu.  Logged out & restarted 3 / 4
times, still the same problem.  then used synaptic to uninstall, and then
reinstall.  Still the Wine is not appearing in Applications menu.  Logged
out & Logged in, rebooted 3 times, still the same problem.

Using 10.04 on my laptop.

In the Synaptic Menu it is showing that Wine 1.0 & Wine 1.0-gecko both are
installed.

What could be the problem.

with warm regards

Hi,

No idea on how it is missed.

It gives various options on adding it manually.

Try it and update the results here.

Message-ID: <AANLkTik5SQfIg3FpS0bAJSD45hJUccVH4X3sF4n_d8j-@mail.gmail.com>

If you are on a LAN and wish to find out which computers in it
currently have access to that certain LAN,
you can use the following command:

for ip in $(seq 1 254); do ping -c 1 192.168.1.$ip>/dev/null; [ $? -eq
0 ] && echo ?192.168.1.$ip UP? || : ; done

This will ping each computer on the 192.168.1.x subnet one time, with
a one second interval between pings.
The output should be something like

192.168.1.1 UP
192.168.1.17 UP
192.168.1.24 UP
?


Alternatively, you can use netdiscover:

sudo apt-get install netdiscover
netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24

This will scan all the computers in that particular address range and
present the active ones
in a table that also provides a MAC address and a MAC Vendor line.

Another way is to use nmap

SuperTuxKart is an enhanced version of TuxKart, the kart racing game
originally done by Steve Baker, featuring Tux and a bunch of his

nmap package is pretty heavy. The first script with no dependencies is
probably the best way(out of the box).

FILES_V_VIIISEM/ICE/VITOVIIISEM/ECE24042010.pdf [pdf link] is the Anna
University Syllabus for 6-8 semesters, B.E Computer Science for those
admitted during/after 2008 (includes me). I'm excited to see that they
have something called "Open Source Lab" there - in the 7th semester.
And it is not an elective, but a compulsory course. Thanks to the
NRCFOSS guys :)

Next step would be finding ways to kick out TC.... :D

Well, apparently that's what I get when my university insists on me
doing the following before I can get a link to a PDF:

1. Showing the link in a slow moving upwards marquee on their site
with both useful and utterly useless links mangled together
2. Said link actually pointing to a Microsoft Word Document, making me
open them in OpenOffice
3. Right Click -> Edit Hyperlink -> Copy (since I haven't quite
managed to find out a way to get downloaded file's URL from Chrome)

Proper Link is:

Okay, color me stupid. GMail is messing up the formatting because the
URL had a 'SPACE' in it.

You would have used some URL Shortener services (like bit.ly) before
sharing such a long link to get rid of these kind of spacing issues :)

Anyways it's worth sharing those issues with us !

I don't quite like the extra layer of indirection - though it would've
been apt here. More reason I should get my personal url shortener
working fast ;)

> Anyways it's worth sharing those issues with us !

I thought ILUGC mailing lists weren't the place for long, scathing
personal rants. However, whoever maintains Anna University's Website
needs to get a clue, and find their own head fast.

This file does not have any reference to Open Source Lab in the 7th
semester. Is it in CSE syllabus? Could not find it in the website.

well now it seems to have got fixed - I pressed reply and got the list. I have 
a feeling you are pressing 'reply to all' in gmail as I notice some of your 
mails are to me and cc to the list.

Sir,

Excellent.  It was just the right answer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cut & pasted the article :

i don't know about kde (using gnome) but in gnome when you manually delete a
menu item like wine it writes an entry to /home/<user
name>/.config/menus/applications.menu
 Code:

<Name>wine-wine</Name>
		<DirectoryDir>/home/doug/.local/share/desktop-directories</DirectoryDir>
		<Deleted/>

remove the <Deleted/>
maybe kde does the same thing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One small thing to note was : that there were applications.menu 4 copies, 0,
10, 11 & 12.  I changed the menu as directed in the last copy i.e,
applications.menu12.

It just worked sir.

Thanks very much. (In fact I was planning to reinstall 10.04 on this sunday,
if this problem was not sorted out before).

Good News.

Why there is no theory paper?

Without knowing the concepts, will it be easy to do them in practical?

Awesome effort.

 * Could not get the theory paper details in that pdf.
 * Do they still have the Theory paper now?
 * Is it elective or essential?
 * Is that happens in any previous semesters?
 * Do they get any basic linux lab in previous semester?

Thanks.

1. I've sadly never heard of the theory paper :(
2. If it isn't in the PDF, it isn't in our syllabus. So I guess we
don't have that theory paper (we -> students admitted after 2008)
3. The Lab is Essential, which is *extremely* important - most
students don't really get to pick their electives freely (from what
I've heard)
4. We do get basic 'UNIX commands' - very basic bash and vim. Taught
without any understanding, as usual ;)

Message-ID: <AANLkTil6yuvjdmLdgnko6Bc4V30dB8O9nobqvmsFk9Iw@mail.gmail.com>

OBJECTIVE:
To expose students to FOSS environment and introduce them to use open source
packages
   1. Kernel configuration, compilation and installation : Download / access the
      latest kernel source code from kernel.org,compile the kernel and
install it in the
      local system.Try to view the source code of the kernel
   2. Virtualisation environment (e.g., xen, kqemu or lguest) to test
an applications,
      new kernels and isolate applications. It could also be used to
expose students to
      other alternate OSs like *BSD

   3. Compiling from source : learn about the various build systems
used like the
       auto* family, cmake, ant etc. instead of just running the
commands. This could
       involve the full process like fetching from a cvs and also
include autoconf,
       automake etc.,
   4. Introduction to packet management system : Given a set of RPM or DEB,
       how to build and maintain, serve packages over http or ftp. and
also how do you
       configure client systems to access the package repository.
   5. Installing various software packages
       Either the package is yet to be installed or an older version
is existing. The
       student can practice installing the latest version. Of course,
this might need
       internet access.
    Install samba and share files to windows
    Install Common Unix Printing System(CUPS)
   6. Write userspace drivers using fuse -- easier to debug and less
dangerous to
       the system (Writing full-fledged drivers is difficult at student level)
   7. GUI programming : a sample programme ? using Gambas since the students
       have VB knowledge. However, one should try using GTK or QT
   8. Version Control System setup and usage using RCS, CVS, SVN
   9. Text processing with Perl: simple programs, connecting with database e.g.,
       MYSQL
   10. Running PHP : simple applications like login forms after
setting up a LAMP stack
   11. Running Python : some simple exercise ? e.g. Connecting with
MySql database
   12. Set up the complete network interface usinf ifconfig command liek setting
       gateway, DNS, IP tables, etc.,
Resources :
An environment like FOSS Lab Server (developed by NRCFOSS containing the various
packages)
OR
Equivalent system with Linux distro supplemented with relevant packages
Note:
Once the list of experiments are finalised, NRCFOSS can generate full
lab manuals
complete with exercises, necessary downloads, etc. These could be made
available on
NRCFOSS web portal.


                                                  TOTAL: 45 PERIODS
LIST OF EQUIPMENTS:
Hardware:
     Minimum Requirements:
   - 700 Mhz X86 Processor
   - 384 MB of system memory (RAM)
   - 40 GB of disk space
   - Graphics card capable of 1024*768 resolution
   - Sound Card
   - Network or Internet Connection
Software:
Latest distribution of Linux

Much worried to think the status of the students who are going to mug up
every program and exercise as they dont have any theory paper to explain what
they are working in the lab.

Forget about the students, how many of the faculty members ready to switch from
traditional 8 or 10 programs (same lab manual being used for many years) and 
move to individual assignments to the students? I've heard many folks said "it's
not practically possible", that really hurts and certainly we're not mentoring
our students; just spoiling their hope.

As a student who sees this happen first hand, I'm incredibly worried
as well. What will happen is, ofcourse, staff will google to find
solutions to exercises, print them out, xerox them and give them off
to students to copy. Students will type in the xeroxed notes, make
tons of spelling mistakes - which the staff will have no idea how to
fix. Average impact of this course on the average student will not be
much.

Most we can hope for is that someone new will get impressed from the
NRCFOSS materials itself and want to find out something new for
himself. Looking forward to see the result NRCFOSSS produces.

Yes but most of the cases which I've seen - faculty members don't even "google"
it around but simply using the exercises/code that has been written years
back. Also they stick to some limited number game (like I will keep 6 to 12
programs only for this semester) and no matter whether students understand
them or not. I would appreciate if NRC FOSS requests university academic dean 
or curriculum council or respective authorities to come out from traditional
way of conducting lab exercises to mini projects which must be unique in nature
and allocate to the individual student. It doesn't whether he/she can 100% success
in running the code or not and I think that's way we look at, otherwise
it's going to like the same even after many years like what are seeing today.

Great, I did not realize it as it was not specifically mentioned in
the agenda.  I would suggest to place it in  agenda.

Great initiative though I wish this had happened sometime back. If
only the staff are exposed to some real world projects through the
FDPs, this initiative will succeed. Else it'll be rendered useless as
all (the existing) labs follow the same restricted set of programs,
written the same way for many batches.

First imperssion - looks like a portal consolidating the various
"monitoring" tools.  Too early to say how much value add it brings to
the table since most of the packages have their own mailing
lists/wiki/forums with their respective "gurus" participating therein.

My two cents.

Subject: [Ilugc] make tutorial
Message-ID: <AANLkTilLEvI7aS8B7L49OoXm_tW29MBy-VTT9WLzakgJ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

This mail is an attempt to teach makefiles in UNIX. Makefiles work the
same way everywhere even in
Windoze. There are also several names for the make tool. tmake, pmake,
gmake, nmake and so on. ;)

But all of them work similarly.

In the BSD world makefiles are more subtle and much shorter. Makefiles
also work differently in the
autoconf world with configure script, Makefile.in , Makefile.am and so on.

As you can see it is very complicated, complex and needlessly boring. But
this does not take away the fact that makefiles are a beautiful thing.

I shall try to illustrate this idea in this mail.

$ make

will try to execute the first rule in the makefile found in the
current directory.

makefile can be named "makefile" or "Makefile" or "MAKEFILE".

But it almost always is named "Makefile".

A makefile is organized as

rule :: dependency.c dependency.h foo.c ba.c
<TAB>gcc foo.c ba.c dependency.c -o rule

I think you get the idea.

rule name is also the target name.

In other words, you tell the makefile or in essence the make utility that
  to create the target "rule" you need to execute the line given with
a <TAB> character
 directly below the rule line.

And you also tell makefile that whenever any of the files

"dependency.c dependency.h foo.c ba.c"

change the target has to be updated.

In other words make helps you keep your targets up-to-date.

But all these are academic words without much meaning to hackers.

So let me now talk in practical lingo.

If you wish to create a mp3 file from a bunch of wav files or
 if you wish to dump a file an image file, you can write rules like these.

out.mp3 : in.wav
<TAB>ffmpeg -i in.wav out.mp3

You can also call it like this.

createmp3: in.wav
<TAB>ffmpeg -i in.wav out.mp3

The rule name need not correspond to the target file created.

It is just a name after all like Girish.

And the dependencies can be nil too.

clean::
<TAB>rm -rf *.o

will remove all the object files unilaterally.

Makefiles are a very powerful UNIX "power tool" and it takes a lot of
experience and
knowledge to use it effectively.

I have not been using it well yet.

But remember that there are makefile variables, shell variables,
makefile if conditions
and while loops  and they should not interfere with shell's if and while .

If you wish to write a shell script like this.

$ for file in `ls /etc/`
   do
        echo $file
   done

in a Makefile they have to be written like this.

printfilesinetc::
       for file in `ls /etc/`; do \
        echo $$file; \
        done

Reason being that the makefile rule line is exactly that. Just one line.

So if you wish to run multiple commands you need to run like this.

<TAB>cd /etc/ && cat passwd

and if you wish to background processes, you write like this:

           (rm -rf /tmp&) && \
           echo "started the removal in background"

Also if you wish to avoid echoing of executed rule commands you need
to prefix a @.

printhello::
<TAB>echo "hello"

should actually be

printhello::
<TAB>@echo "hello"

Try it and you will know.

Have fun!

To show an image file to X,

showimg::
<TAB>qiv -mtf *png

Also  you can call any rule like this.

$ make rule2

when you have two lines like this anywhere in the makefile.

rule2::
<TAB>echo "Rule 2"

some more questions again.

Sorry for troubling you much.

1. How many of the staff of colleges know the following things?

kernel compiling
virtualisation
package management
writing userspace drivers using fuse
GUI programming
Version Control System
Text processing with Perl
Running PHP/Python

I dont know why my son and his friends are laughing after
seeing the syllabus.


2. Do NRCFOSS staff goto each college and setup FOSS LAB Server?
    or guide them remotely?

3. How the colleges are going to get support for setting up the LAB?

4. It may take some time for NRCFOSS to prepare and study materials.
    Eventhough college staff get some PDF files,
    is it possible for them to teach those things to students practically?

5. Is there any FDP programme arranged for the Teaching staff in all colleges?

6. Is there any progress to make FOSS as essential theory paper?

7. Why they removed it from elective?

8. Why the syllabus has so many commercial products to learn?

The commercial products are.
-----------------------------------
Labs:

OOAD LAB -
Suggested SoftwareTools
     ArgoUML, Eclipse IDE, Visual Paradigm, Visual case, and Rational Suite


INTERNET PROGRAMMING LAB - Filled with Java exercises.

COMPUTER GRAPHICS LABORATORY -
LIST OF EQUIPMENTS:
1) Turbo C
2) Visual C++ with OPENGL
3) Any 3D animation software like 3DSMAX, Maya, Blender

-----------------------

Theory Papers:
VISUAL PROGRAMMING - filled with VC++ and .NET
ADVANCED JAVA PROGRAMMING - Full Theory paper
WEB TECHNOLOGY  - Theory Paper - Again filled with Java
C# and .NET Framework - Full Theory paper

---

I have to think on selling my house,
if my son wants those software -

Visual Paradigm, Visual case, and Rational Suite
 Turbo C
 Visual C++ with OPENGL
Any 3D animation software like 3DSMAX, Maya
VC++,C# and .NET


9. You can say that there are free software also mentioned like
    Eclipse, AgroUML, Blender.

    What to do if the colleges are not using any free software?
    What to do if the colleges insist students to use only commercial
software that they use/know.?
    If they do so, where to report it?



Sorry for the multiple questions and troubles.

Really, it may happen to pay much if my son ask those software
if the college asks him to use only commercial software.
I dont want to loss our house just to buy software.

Thanks a lot.

Victor

This is seventh semester for 2008 regulation students - who are now
entering 5th semester. So NRCFOSS has a full year - should hopefully
be good enough.

I'd like to see that happen too :)

> 7. Why they removed it from elective?

I have a feeling that was because not many people were taking it up.
Or being encouraged to take it up. Or even being allowed to take it
up.

For example, even from the pdf - I'd say most people will pick "Visual
Programming" as Elective I & "Numerical Methods" as Elective II -
partly because "it is easy to pass macha", "sappa paper da!" and
partly because staff have been doing that for ages. Atleast from my
experience.

Electives aren't 'truly' elected by the student's interest. I want to
pick "Parallel Programming" and "UNIX Internals" - and I'll keep you
posted on how hard it happens to be.

> 8. Why the syllabus has so many commercial products to learn?

Because you obviously cannot do any GUI programming in C :)

Hi ,

make is the standard against which all other build systems are currently
compared. Make is at its core a dependency checker that can execute shell
commands based on one file being older than another. Implementations of Make
exist on almost every software platform, although by far the most widespread
would be GNU Make. make is almost dead(virtually nobody is using today the
original BSD Unix Make).

Most Make implementations include a set of 'default make rules' which allow
very simple building of C, C++  projects. Additionally make rules can be
specified for other languages, but these tend to need to be customized from
platform to platform.

Make doesn't include dependency checking by default, although there are make
rules that can do this for you fairly easily in the case of GNU Make.

GNU Make's support for shell scripts under GNU/Linux means that GNU
Makefiles can be very powerful, but use of advanced GNU Make features will
usually render your makefile incompatible with other Make implementations.

see the article what-is-wrong-with-make? :
http://freshmeat.net/articles/what-is-wrong-with-make

Make implementations are poor and dirty by today's standards . That is why
we have few more modern alternatives GNU Autotools,CMake,SCons :

GNU Autotools
GNU Autotools extends GNU Make with a larger library of default build rules,
plus extensive dependency checking capability. It knows how to compile
software (executables, shared libraries, plus documentation, etc) for a
large number of targets, which is something that rapidly becomes tedious
when using plain Makefiles. GNU Autotools is the defacto standard build
system for large linux programs.

CMake
CMake is a principal competitor to both GNU Autotools and SCons. It is a
build system generator, i.e. after running CMake, the user has a native
Visual Studio file at his disposal, or a native Makefile, or nmake file, or
whatever their preference is. Off-the-shelf build capabilties are
comprehensive and proven for large scale software development. The
implementation architecture is far more unified than GNU Autotools and it
runs much faster. CMake has its own scripting language that runs on all
platforms that CMake targets. It is Yet Another Scripting Language, which
puts some people off, but it has the advantage of not introducing any
additional language dependencies to a project.

3. How the colleges are going to get support for setting up the LAB?

LinuXpert Systems has been already supporting many engineering colleges in
Tamilnadu in setting up of FOSS Labs using our FOSS Lab Resource &
Development Kit (customised installation of GNU/Linux with all the required
application is done via PXE based Remote installation)

(Almost FREE OF COST for the first time).

Sir, Let me assure you that your house is absolutely not at risk because 
a PDF file mentions these. Colleges themselves make sure they have a 
'few' software - to ensure their inspection from their certifying 
authority goes on well. One fine day I walked into my computer lab in my 
college to find "Visual Tools Lab" and "Operating Systems Lab" boards 
setup on top of a row of 8 computers per board.
And there was one Red Hat Machine setup which was called Linux Server 
which students were not allowed to touch as touch would disrupt the 
telnet connections from other machines  in the lab would get 
'disconnected'. That the LAN cable was in a bad shape dint matter.
And I am also sure that a lot of staff members will be wondering how to 
handle this "situation" - they will consider asking their friends (staff 
in neighbouring colleges) to loan some programs for the trainee 
typists(i.e lab students) to practice.

Couldn't help this rant. going by usual standards in the college i have 
seen, this lab syllabus looks pretty ambitious and I pray that this does 
not become another joke in the name of labwork as is usually the case.

Wait a second, why the double colons specifically? I've always used it

this is one many of us might have noticed in the engg schools (especially
during AITCE inspection or ISO/NBA auditing etc), new boards setup in front
of the computer labs as mentioned above. It's all for that day and everything
would disappear in the next day. I wonder why engg school mgmt's not showing
much interest in open source tools/free software but like to keep an inventory
of commercial/prop software installed and show it to the auditing commitees?
I think having FOSS lab in the curriculum is a good initiative but students 
and faculty members of all engg schools should take this further to other 
semesters/courses and areas. All the efforts on this front would be much 
appreciated. If any of the faculty members following this list/seeing this email
thread, kindly requesting to get rid of using standard programs for using lab exercises 
and come out with individual assignments for students.

In my view, it's not correct to mention that engg. college managements are
not showing any interest in free software / open source tools.

In the recent times, after discussion with many of the college management
authorities, (i.e. Chairman/Director/Dean/Secretary/Principal) we found
that, the management people have real interest in implementing free/open
source softwares in their institutions and no companies / vendors /
volunteers have approached any of these institutions in
supporting/implementing them.

a nice initiative. i hope this will make all the colleges know about NRCFOSS
and they will start looking for help from the organization, which will help
further in promoting foss.


i have a doubt. does this syllabus apply only to anna university chennai or
also to other anna universities. if it does not apply i expect NRCFOSS
should take steps towards that.

We convinced one (new) staff to actually make the students write their
own programs. Simple Data Structures. Linked Lists, Double Linked
Lists, Binary Trees, etc.

Result? Three months were down, and 90% of the class was *still
struggling with doubly linked lists*. That was not counting those who
still hadn't been able to get Singly linked lists to work. Most of
which was, mind you - still copied - from other students
(unofficially).

The staff are not entirely to blame. They're 'just doing their job' -
which is to help students get 'marks', and not to actually get them to
learn anything.

I walked into the *same* lab, saw the same boards - and assumed that
Operating Systems Lab was where people hacked on Kernels and Drivers.
Turns out it was the corner where older computers are kept, mostly
used for ..... Nothing.

Ofcourse, Visual Tools Lab is extremely popular - all new machines
with internat access! Facebook is blocked, but Orkut is *not* - and
I'll let you figure out the reason why.

I think the LAN Cables are now better off. The Red Hat card has been
replaced with a 'Windows VISTA Server, do not touch!' card. Two
powerful dual-xeon machines sleep mostly unused - the are usually used
as print servers and CD burners. Another one serves as the 'Anti Virus
Server'. I don't know where the Linux machine we all telnet into (we
are all 'user1' and our passwords are all '1234') is kept.

I planned to make things atleast slightly better - write those
programs myself (and have it reviewed by people with more
brains/experience) and hand it to the staff. Much better than letting
students copy the pos, buggy, really-badly-styled, and plain-ugly code
that they now have to use.

Yes - I'm sure copying perl from 'observation' to 'observation' is
going to be a *lot* of fun!

I agree, students also should come forward if staff open to ahead with
the new approach or giving choice on their own, take that as a
advantage and use it.

This made me laugh out loud, mostly because I can relate. 1234 indeed.

It clearly shows that the person who developed this syllabus dont have knowledge in kernel compilation. How one can compile a kernel without knowing Make tool?. And it is located in the 3rd topic after kernel compilation. The author of this syllabus is confusing with top layer an middle layer of Linux kernel and he also confused students/staffs.

FOSSLab server is an "Mummy" project. No idea, Why the author of this syllabus trying to give soul for "Mummy". 

Hint for "Mummy"::
It was born in end of 2005 and 1.0 released in beginning of 2006. Suddenly it died. Again after 2-3 years back NRCFOSS again announced version 2.0 and released. No idea what is the difference b/w 1.0 and 2.0. Again it died after Mr.Srinivasan left out from NRCFOSS-AUKBC. So I am calling "FOSSLab server" is like Mummy. No idea when it will come out and die again.

The suggested configuration is useless for kernel compilation. Linux kernel 2.6.x may take many days to complete the compilation for the above suggested configuration. I am wondering, first of all latest Linux will work on 384MB RAM. 

Minimum expertise skillset should be required to do all the above stuffs. But still the content is confusing the target audience. So the final target will not be like Linux application development or Linux kernel programming or what else. This kind of syllabus will create more panic for target audience about Linux instead of promoting FOSS/GNU Linux.

There is no point in lamenting about the system, unless we do our bit to set right. So from ILUGC let us do some thing. My ideas

a. Write detailed notes for the chapters given, in our wiki page. We shall cover background theory also.

b. Design exercises and publish in wiki. There should be two sets. One basic with solutions with lot of explanation. Other only problem statements.

c.Write notes from the angle of a teacher - i.e. some thing like hints, timings of each chapter etc.,

d.Create presentation materials in ilugc site.

e.Let us cover the syllabus in regular/special lug meets, record the video and publish

f.The videos can be screencasts also.

g.Conduct FDP in colleges.

Except for videos and FDP, we don't need any extra resource. We don't even need to meet. They can be in wiki page itself.

I will try to complete perl portion in a week's time.

The 'target audience' here are budding Computer Scientists and
Engineers, who *must* know the innards of the various software
described in the core courses, such as Operating Systems, Compilers,
Databases, etc. In order to know that, you must know how to work in a
DBMS and how operating systems and compilers work. Knowledge of how a
software works cannot be attained for proprietary solutions, but free
and open source software makes it possible. The text for Operating
Systems has a few interesting case studies which no one studies (it is
out of the syllabus, not an important question are the reasons oft
supplied).

I had an interest in Operating Systems and read some code from Minix
as I knew Linux was too complex. (Code reading is quite an interesting
journey in itself.) I didn't complete it for want of knowledge about
assembly language.

The curriculum for the Compiler Design lab is pretty good for an
undergraduate course, but most colleges supply the programs to
students, as Yuvi had remarked. However the curriculum for the
operating systems lab was measly, with basic shell commands occupying
one fourth of the syllabus. The only programs we actually coded were
the scheduling algorithms and a single memory management program. This
lab seriously needs a revamp.

I prefer not to rant on, but the abysmal standards of the practical
courses in CSE don't give students the practice they ought to have
before becoming scientists and engineers.

But the sad state of affairs in our current system produces more
people who can do what one says, but can't think of their own. Of
course, this is a majority and doesn't include all CSE students. The
major problem with the current system is that the curriculum aims for
a lowest common denominator of skills, and doesn't allow for
diversification even in the last few semesters. Colleges elect the
electives, rather than the students.

> This kind of syllabus will create more panic for target audience about Linux instead of promoting FOSS/GNU Linux.

I don't think the mission of this course is to promote FOSS. It is
rather to provide students with skills that they can use in real life
projects.

+1.

It should start something like this :

1) . Writing, Compiling and Executing C programs using GNU compiler.

2) . Writing, Compiling and Executing C++ programs using GNU compiler.

3).  Compiling multiple C/C++ source files using GNU compiler.

4).  Compiling multiple C/C++ source Using Makefiles.

without understanding the above stuff student never understand what is going
on when they compile the package from source OR kernel from source as per
syllabus .  It will give great confidence and first impression/passion among
the student. compiling the kernel without having those stuff may create
negative impression among student.

That why most of the Engineers are writing HTML code for web browser,
instead writing code of browser itself.

your long mail seems me that you also don't have the idea of configuring and
compiling Linux kernel .

Today night we had a good conversation with my son and his friends.
After seeing this thread those guys could not stop laughing for a longer time.
They immediately called their friends and asked to read it fully.
The laughing is spreading. :-)

But I could not answer for the question from a boy.
"Why Uncle, there is no reply to the list from NRCFOSS for any of the
questions?"

Do Anyone know?

I like this list very much.
I dont know how I missed it so far.

Please feel free to guide me If I am wrongly questioning here.
Do we have rights to talk about the activities of NRCFOSS?

If it is going to get the credits for creating that excellent syllabus
and pushing to academic labs,
It will be nice if they reply for the queries for the questions here.
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2010-June/057995.html


Thanks for the reply from baskar.
So happy to read about his activities in many colleges.
Those colleges are blessed with the holy blood of FOSS.
Thanks for wonderful contribution.

I like the reply from raman.
Instead of querying someone, Why cant we give some solution?
Never thought on this view.
Thanks raman.
Let us start our contribution to the student community.
Please give the url to the wiki page. I will do my best to add content.

so, the community gives
1. support to FOSS LAB
2. run FDP session
3. create notes for students and lectures
4. may be more things

my son may ask like "What is the contribution of NRCFOSS?"


Thanks all for being patient for accepting all this new man's shoutings.

Baskar,

Do you guide the students to create a lug or FOSS club
within themself when you reach so many colleges?

Like to know how you communicate to the
loads of students you meet in each college.

How do you follow the progress of their continuous
learning of linux?

Again thanks a lot for your service.

Myself has got involved in the FOSS promotional activitiy, mainly in
education since August 2003 when LinuXpert Systems was started (It was also
my aim that, the academic community should not be left behind in FOSS
development and keep trying to cultivate the culture of knowledge sharing
through Free softwares among the future young minds).

When I go for colleges, I request either the dept. / management authorities
to arrange for a introduction seminar about Linux/FOSS to create awareness
among the students and staffs and at end of the program, I used to
distribute GNU/Linux CD/DVDs to the students and ask them to try installing
in their computers.  (I hope many students/staff members in this list know
this very well)

The link is useful but I am getting some problem:
The Mblaze drive came with a .deb file named crossplatformui which i thought
would help in installing the modem but it was neither fully installed nor i
was able to remove it. now when i install any package (required for the
modem installation) it shows problem with the not properly installed
"crossplatformui" package. even I am unable to install "wvdial"

may be because the package is not properly removed and is creating problem,
so can you suggest me how to remove any package completely? I tried from
synaptic but i couldnot do it.
may after that I may be able to follow the link provided by you.

please ask any further information required to solve it.

Try
sudo apt-get install -f
or failing that try
sudo dpkg --force-all -r crossplatformui
to remove the package.

Comment out the line which looks for ztemtvcdromd in the file
/var/lib/dpkg/info/crossplatformui.postrm and try again.

@nellingiri: that was the first thing what i did, I think i have stated in
previous mail

@all: I was able to remove the package after editing file in /etc/info as
suggested above.

after that I installed both the packages suggested in the link and then
installed "wvdial" too. now when I give command wvdial cdma i get erros
like:

*chandan@chandan-laptop:~$ wvdial cdma
--> WvDial: Internet dialer version 1.60
--> Cannot open /dev/ttyUSB0: Device or resource busy

--> man pppd explains pppd error codes in more detail.

--> The PPP daemon has died. (exit code = 2)


*what could be the solution to it?

Subject: [Ilugc] software for B school
Message-ID: <201006191505.03779.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

I am happy to announce that the B school has decided to go in for a 60 seat 
ltsp lab with 2 servers. Special thanks to Basker and his team for their help 
in this matter. The lab has to pass AICTE inspection for which on the software 
side they require:
legal OS
and any 10 software packages. Due to the high cost of multiseat licenses, they 
have kindly restricted the required list to 10 although there is no upper 
limit - I hear that some posh B schools have upto 15-20 packages installed. I 
request list members to recommend packages in the list given under. Please 
only recommend packages that you have experience with - and give some feedback 
on the packages. The list is:

wordprocessor
spreadsheet
presentation
statistics
project management
operations research
mis
accounting and erp
rdbms
moodle
website building tool
bowser
language learning tool (language lab)
graphing tool
email
photo editor
video editor
crm
hrm

of special interest are statistics and language lab.

As far as the erp for running the college is concerned, they are going in for 
an open source package and will be funding and contributing back to the 
package - since the deal is not finalised I am not at liberty to disclose what 
package it is.

btw, if your kids, sisters, brothers or you yourself want to do an MBA in an 
open source environment Suguna Spark B school is a good place.

and from the NRC-FOSS perspective:

I have been teaching and training people for the last 45 years - I have toured 
the best and worst educational institutions from marathadi schools to IIT and 
JNU. And I have found that there are 3 ingredients to good education. They 
are:
1. Good teachers
2. Good teachers
3. Good teachers

No amount of course material, no amount of lovely syllabus, no amount of 
equipment will substitute for the above three.

and who is a good teacher? not an expert in the subject. not a person who has 
all the answers - he is a person with a passion for the subject and a mission 
to instill that passion in his students. 

if we want to spread foss - the solution is simple. Find the good teachers and 
convert them. I cannot do it - the 3 people who I have known as good teachers 
are no longer with us - but you people can. Please do so.

Dear Kenneth,

As part of my research work, I doing advanced Statistical Modeling using R.
I did this modeling with the help of IIM - Ahmedabad MBA student and Loyola
Institute of Business Administration(LIBA) - Chennai faculty.

I would like to recommend you GNU R for statistical computing, conducting
statistical analyses and graphics.

R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software
Foundation?s GNU General Public License in source code form. R is powerful
and highly developed (and very similar in syntax to S-Plus). The originators
of R are R.Gentleman and R.Ihaca from New Zealand, and the R home page is at
: http://www.r-project.org/

R is now the most widely used statistical package/language in university
statistics departments and many research organizations. Its great advantages
are that for many years, it has been the leading statistical
package/language and that it can be freely downloaded from the R website.

Here is a collection of document link about R :
http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html



Thanks & Rg

Many years back (20 to be precise!) it was possible for students to pick an
elective if enough students show willingness and they themselves get the
consent of a faculty who can handle it. Maybe NRCFOSS can help you here.

Hi,

Some thoughts below:

\--

This does happen with other semester papers too, so it isn't much
different anyway.

For imparting knowledge, the following three have to be inline:

  content -- presentation -- audience

The fourth dimension is time.

Content relevant to the topic of discussion is essential. The way it
is presented to the audience is also important. People like a subject
or topic, because, they like the way the author has written the
material (flow of content) or the way it has been presented to them.
The audience should also be interested in listening to the content.
Forcing participants to attend F/OSS sessions thus doesn't work. And
if either one of these is not relevant to context, it isn't fruitful
at all.

While, I am happy that students are asking questions, and asking them
openly in a public mailing list, it is also important to see how any
problems that arise (content, presentation, individual, institute) can
be solved. After all, our hacker culture aims at solving problems and
finding elegant, beautiful answers.

If one feels that content needs work, submitting suggestions to this
list is very helpful, and it can be reviewed and suggested to the
concerned. If the way things are presented at your Institute isn't to
your satisfactory level, then you can ask this list for more help, or
suggestions for more material.

As much as people can voluntarily help, we also need to hear about
your classmates (audience) participation, and feedback, and whether
they have really understood the significance and importance of the
subject, just as you have been participating in the list.

While we don't expect you to change the way faculty teach in the
Institute, it is important for you to gain as much knowledge as
possible during your college years, given the opportunity to do so. It
would be great, if you could also share your know-how, whatever you
have learnt from participation here or other user groups to your
classmates (and ask them to join such groups as well), so they benefit
from the same, as how we have over the years -- after all we believe
that knowledge is power, and we like to share, impart the same to
others.

Hi,
       I'm trying hard to identify a good web framework in PHP - which has
more features and extensibility as well.
Plenty of frameworks are available, but which one to choose?
According to the comparision in http://www.phpframeworks.com , Akelos has
more features than others.
But, those who have practical experience with them please suggest a nice
one.

IMHO, it may be absurd to say that an 'X' framework is better without
knowing what exactly you want to do!.

Been there. Done that. way back ifrom 2005-2008.

Check out.vpmthane.org

Watch out for problems in recognition of USB Pendrives from the thin
clients appearing ont he server desktop to appear. Make it appear
somehow.

Centos is a no-brainer choice, Two years of MBA is too long a period
for the Fedora/Ubuntu upgrade threadmill Unless there is a full time
admin running around fixing LCD projectors and device not being
recognised.

B-school entrants are not capable, by and large, to use a
sophisticated package like R. They want far more "easy" packages.
Hell, msot don't know what is SPSS/Tally.

Stick to Openoffice 3.2 as it is capable of reading Password protected files.

If you are brave check out openproject. rarely used.

Give them solid browser, Adobe reader, media players (yes, those
ph-MBAs and their stoneage teachers love animation, videos etc0

RHEL is commercial software.  You can request an eval here:
http://www.redhat.com/rhel/details/eval/

or download the beta iso from here:
http://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/rhel/beta/6.0/


Recommend that you use CentOS since FOSS,  100% compatible
with RHEL and fully community supported.  See www.centos.org.

RHEL is not free.

You have to pay to get it.

You can try its free sister "CentOS".

Thank you. Not really, I see some issues on the site with the issue
tracker. Besides, the content also seems to need some corrections. So
was wondering who I should talk to. In case I can fix them, maybe I
could give it a try.

Thanks again. I will get in touch with balachandar.

They are. I saw them too. But then the links seem fairly outdated. For
instance the planet link does not open. So I wasn't sure if I should
go by what I see there. Thats all. The site-run-by link does a mailto
to some other address, not the one shrinivas gave me here.

Many many opportunities. Do you want to work for Google? ;)

Waste of time.

But for people looking for a prop with no self motivation it is better
than nothing.

Chennai is the city to be man. :)

You have plenty of opportunities to learn. You have plenty of
companies in Chennai some
of which do world class work.

I will be conducting a seminar on linux device drivers sometime next
month(July).

Perhaps you could attend it.

Please don't depend upon seminars to learn. They only help you after
you have helped
yourself.

Start browsing and learning on your own. Or catch hold of a linux
person near you and start
learning on your own. It is not so hard. What is needed is will and courage.

Best of luck.

         Isn't it that we need to pay only if we need support ? Are
should we be paying for the software itself(without any kind of

we need support from RHEL. Thanks

All the software RHEL has, are free only.
You can get them in source format in their respective repositories.
You can get the source and compile them yourself.

Downloading the source, compiling, building RPM, verifying, certifying them,
monitoring them for any update, giving patches and updates to existing system
are the part of support and they all needs a lot of resource.
Thats why RedHat is asking money.

Murali Babu,


Please dont advice anyone to steal software.
Using RHEL without paying is not legal.

Please ask people to use CentOS.
There is no different from RHEL and CentOS.

Here in ILUGC we don't encourage or support any form of software
piracy or illegal stuff like this because Red Hat charges money to
give out these RHEL Operating System disks/downloadable ISO files. So
please avoid posting stuff like this on this list.

Limit the CPU usage of a certain application in Linux

You can do this by installing cpulimit. You can limit a certain
running application either by name or by process ID:

cpulimit -e firefox -l 30

This won?t let Firefox go beyond a 30% CPU usage limit.
If you?d rather go by process, you can do it like this:

cpulimit -p 3493 -l 40

i heard this is good. other considersations are symphony, cakePHP etc.

one opinion i have related to framework.
Almost every framework available, have some limitations or the other. rather
than asking people, its better you try and use it / customize it
accordingly.

there is a learning curve also. If you are interest in using web framework
to get the app, up and running, then go for it.
else learn the php language and code from scratch. you will learn a lot.

Hello,
Does limiting CPU usage mean the time taken by the application to use the
CPU?Would'nt limiting usage slow down the application?

Yes the applications will slowdown. For mostly IO application the difference will be negligible. 

Limiting cpu usage will be useful in multi-user environment, where few of the cpu hogs like firefox can be controlled so that other applications perform well.

For temporary/fix-by-hand  we can use nice level of the process to limit.
man nice, man renice will provide more information.

I have two options for you,

       1.Codeigniter : This works in MVC architecture so i think this will
be the better one. For details http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/.

       2. Kohana : This is same as codeigniter and this may also help you.

Ya I tried a few including Akelos, CakePHP and CodeIgniter.
CodeIgniter is much better in terms of simplicity, learning curve and
good documentation as well. Thanks for your suggestions.

Message-ID: <AANLkTilVlCnntLZIBUh2Yu8nexkMr8Rm838oAeCvc7lD@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

My dad used to work(now a pensioner) for the Central Govt; and recently he
suffered from an injury and i had to take him to CGHS - Central Govt Health
Scheme. CGHS is basically a small hospital/clinic wherein they do
preliminary investigation before sending them to a more specialized
hospital.

I went to the CGHS clinic in KKNagar(Chennai) and was surprised to see that
some of the operations have been computerized; and the doctors were using a
computer running on Linux (guess it was Red Hat). [Also, they were running a
browser based app which was developed by NIC.]

Just wanted to share.

You can search Google.com from the Linux command line without using a
CLI web browser like lynx or Elinks.
 All you need is the curl and html2text packages installed. Then you
issue the following command:

curl -A Mozilla http://www.google.com/search?q=Linux |html2text -width 80

where you can replace Linux with another keyword of your choice.
The results will be displayed in your console application with a width of 80. :)

Subject: [Ilugc] need help - visual effects
Message-ID: <AANLkTing9SKPZbJ8vqvXTKpUEONB16BQSvoQH-O8YipX@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

now using 10.04 in my laptop, have been using Ubuntu from 9.04 onwards.

2 days back when I was showing it to my friends what Linux can do, while
trying to raise the visual effects from 'None' to 'Extra', it took a long
time for changing it, and even then I could see the mouse pointer, but it
was not able to pick anything in the Appearances - it was just gliding on
that. But the 'wobbly' effects was ON, and could show them some of the
features, managing not to let them know of the problem.

I had a great diffculty in bringing it back to 'none' - which is my default
effects.  Thought it was some error then, and always keep my Updating
correctly done.

I tried it yesterday, still had the same problem.

I dont need this feature at all, but wanted to know, is this a bug (cannot
imagine it so) or something else.

Thanks,

s.sivakumar

If you have graphic card in the laptop try to update the drivers for the
same by 'System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers'. Mostly this
should solve your problem.

My 7-year old daughter has been playing around with Fedora for the past few
months.
She plays games, uses KWrite to scribble, Kpaint to draw her favorite
jewelery and other things, started tinkering with Atlas yesterday. Does it
make sense to have her experiences share with the group ?

Hi All,

        I am using "SendMail" to send mail from my localhost. Initially
there was no problem i was sending mail using "echo <message> | mail -s
<Subject> <Destination address>" command. It worked as expected, but now no
mails are been sent to destination address and the mail log shows like this
"http://pastebin.com/vrdvs0VL". Am using ubuntu 9.04 . Please help me to fix
this.

Thank you,

Does
$ hostname
resolve to
sateesh-laptop
If not you will need to correct it in /etc/hosts or where ever your
hostname resolution is done from.

this is a random topic list. What one needs are categories and levels. For 
example:

Version control

VCS - Subversion
DVCS - Mercurial, bazaar, git

levels - beginner, intermediate, advanced

Web deployment

Apache, nginx, cherokee, lighttpd

same three levels

once we have a list like this, then it is easy for people to select subject 
and level and propose a talk.

Mails over 10KB will go missing and your mails were both over this limit.
Present list policy restricts postings to 10KB per mail. This policy is to 
prevent indiscriminate forwarding / quoting. If list members want this number 
to be revisited, we can do that.

Message-ID: <4C21B7E2.5080808@virtu.in>

Hi,

Firstly, i do hope the post is within specified norms.

We are a startup looking for a linux administrator who will be able to 
carry out installations, troubleshoot issues on servers and networks and 
create POCs and basically do a lot of experimentation on applications 
and infrastructure. Ideally, we are looking at a person who has a good 
grasp of networks, servers and linux and is willing to go the distance 
given that this is a startup. No certifications or qualifications 
essential, however experience is a must.

Do send me a mail offline if you or any of your friends are interested 
in this opening.

Based in Chennai, might involve a bit of travel for implementations and 
PoCs.
Requirement - Immediate
Salary Range- Negotiable

Thanks,
Madan

Thank you,

I am not sure about IP table the command " $ cat /etc/hosts" shows like this

127.0.0.1    localhost
127.0.1.1    satheesh-laptop

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts

and $ hostname prints satheesh-laptop

please let me know what else i need to change.

Please Change the attitude KILL BILL,because we have a good package and
operating system as a open source.then we use it.there are around 40 million
peoples depends on microsoft and their services.stop the slogan,stop using
windows....instead insist use FOSS..this is my view...if any one found it is
wrong insist me.

Actually no.  If you believe in software freedom, the demise of any
company isn't a desirable trait.   Over 90K jobs would be lost not to
mention a lot of technology and wealth.  What would be desirable instead
is a shift to free and open source software.  Microsoft is a important
organization but hardly the only company practising a business based on
proprietary software.

Winning is defeating the enemy, not a defeat he scripted on himself. I
don't think the point is to see microsoft lose. It is microsoft now.
It will be someone else tomorrow, perhaps Apple with OSX. The worst
part is OSX is pretty much unix like that even the virus prone
advantage we have  now will soon be lost!

I do not see what is good about the news - if it is true, one proprietary 
company gets knocked over by two proprietary companies - RMS hates cloud more

I use Ubuntu 10.04 in my office/personal laptop. However one tool always
forces me to login into windows, which personally is irritating. I been
surfing the ubuntu forums/user guide for some time to find a way to it work
in Linux. Has any one been successful in hacking it or making it work in
Linux/Ubuntu 10.04.

This is the last thread which talks about the company's planns to provide

We need not be so magnanimous towards a company which caused so much harm to
the human progress by its illegal business practices in IT field.

All closed source software might not be evil. But this is one company whose
demise (which I do not think is imminent) would do a world of good to the IT
industry as a whole.

Just recall what happened with SCO's lawsuit against Linux companies? How
eager the same Microsoft was to fund and encourage that attempt! Without the
vigilance and efforts of open source community they would have been happy to
stifle Linux and associated open source software.

In an eco system, different type of entities should thrive. But some are
evil and actively damage everyone else. They should go.

It would be a good thing if Microsoft goes out of business taking with them
all their business practices.

That is my opinion.

There is an ancient Chinese fable called "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed
the Mountains".

It tells of an old man who lived in northern China long, long ago and was
known as the Foolish Old Man of North Mountain. His house faced south and
beyond his doorway stood the two great peaks, Taihang and Wangwu,
obstructing the way. He called his sons, and hoe in hand they began to dig
up these mountains with great determination.

Another graybeard, known as the Wise Old Man, saw them and said derisively,
"How silly of you to do this! It is quite impossible for you few to dig up
those two huge mountains." The Foolish Old Man replied, "When I die, my sons
will carry on; when they die, there will be my grandsons, and then their
sons and grandsons, and so on to infinity *we grow*. High as they are, the
mountains cannot grow any higher and with every bit we dig, they will be
that much lower. Why can't we clear them away?" Having refuted the Wise Old
Man's wrong view, he went on digging every day, unshaken in his conviction.

(??????????? ??????? :

)

===============================
FOSS community is like the Foolish Old Man and his family. With unshaken
conviction the community keeps digging one chip at a time. Any number
mountains will be moved away.

Nice story :) But wouldn't the most pragmatic thing to do be  1.
location the direction of the doorway, 2. move someplace else 3. Enjoy
the scenery, create a tourist spot and rake in the dough?

Mountains usually don't move. And if they do, it's not by any sort of
action from our part.

I differ.  While I do not advocate shutting a company down, no company
should be allowed to do whatever it wants; becomes a monopoly and
starts dictating terms to everyone.    For this reason, in 1984 AT&T
was broken down into independent manufacturing, long distance and
local telephone companies.   This led to opening up of the Telecom
market and thriving competition amongst  service providers in the US
resulting in more choices (at lower cost) to the consumers.   If you

This highly debate able.  The fundamental blocks (the TCP/IP stack,
Usenet, mailing lists, HTTP protocol) of how we communicate with each
other today were first developed on the *nix platforms.  MS came in
much much later.  AFAIK that the TCP/IP stack in their Windows 9x code
base was lifted from one of the *BSD code.   On the application side,
their famous IE is based on NSCA's Mosaic browser (open source funded
by the US tax payers).  Wordstar, Visicalc, DBase were available from
the DOS days.  That reminds me their cash cow product DOS was an
"purchased" product.   While there were other versions of DOS with a
lot more features they were unable to capture any market segment due
to the lic. practices adopted by MS.  AFAIK, Xenix was also a MS
product (lic. from AT&T) which later became SCO Unix.  Recall the
lawsuit by SCO on IBM/Novell for patent infringement?  It begs the
question, why did MS not make Xenix as it's foundation platform and
develop all of it's products on the same.  After all, during the DOS
days we CLI as the only interface.

MS embraces open standards, injects proprietary information in
optional fields making the setup un-interoperable (unless you are
willing to play by their rules with an NDA) - MS ADS (LDAP+Kerberos
plus prop. ext.)  is a good example.

My two cents.

Need more information on what you want to do with webcam in terminal.

To record video from terminal,

Use the following command line to record an AVI with a resolution of
320x240 pixels.

mencoder tv:// -tv driver=v4l:width=320:height=240:device=/dev/video0
-nosound -ovc lavc -o wcrecording.avi

Microsoft's Products and their services are good, but what we don't want is
to be "forced" to buy Microsoft products without any second option.

Almost every new laptop/netbook is pre-installed with Microsoft O/S and few
with MS Office too.. And we have to pay for that when we buy the laptop. If
this attitude of Microsoft is changed, may be we could try to respect
Microsoft..

But, as long as "HP, Lenovo, Dell, etc.," will "recommend Windows 7", we
can't kill Microsoft and had to bear the pain of this Cancer!!

For the sensors command to work you need to have the "lm-sensors" package
installed.
After installing the lm-sensors package you need to run the command
"sensors-detect" in root mode to detect the various sensors available in
your system.

It might just be that comes a time when you?ll need a terminal window

Install Eterm and start it with

Shrini,

What do you mean?

Eterm is englightenment term. You need to install it. I think you need to
install enlightenment instead. It is a window manager.

you have to fight hard with the vendors, but you can get a laptop, netbook or

I once asked a big shot from HP (which is anti microsoft and pro opensource) 
why they recommend windows. He said, if we do so then microsoft contributes 
towards the cost of the advertisement. As microsoft dies, they will no longer 
have money to pay the vendors and they will stop recommending.

Maybe one good thing . If M$ dies there would be no more vendor lockin
as the other biggest proprietary OS maker sells his own hardware .

Imagine walking into a computer store to see all GNU/Linux machines
and 'some' macs .

Since the OP is asking for a "Live CD" to recover the partitions . I
would recommend the nearby person to burn and give him Knoppix[1] or
other fully loaded live CD . That would show some cool applications in
GNU/Linux which are missing in Ubuntu default cd .

Thats great, Its very good idea but it would be fare and good if there is
any protocol to send the mobile number through SMS or to your Mail ID. Some
thing like, "ODOC:<User Name> <Mobile Number> (For SMS)". This will make you
to understand for what the mobile number is forwarded to you.

Subject: [Ilugc] Monitoringforge - The community
Message-ID: <AANLkTinDQpON4QzXVCtnoE04s8sElnBe-udXy_C9mj2j@mail.gmail.com>

*What is Monitoringforge [www.monitoringforge.org]? *
This was a site which was setup by GWOS, to provide a one stop shop for
anything and everything related to monitoring software. i.e Tools, Plugins,
Projects containing different applications which can be incorporated into
the Monitoring systems. According to the community "MonitoringForge is the
IT monitoring toolkit epicenter for all open source projects and plugins
that anyone can use and contribute to at any time. It's the monitoring
knowledge neighborhood".The community has been slowly and steadily gaining
new members and users who are contributing back to the community by way of
interacting in forums, wiki.  More details on the concept of this community
is provided in
http://monitoringforge.org/displaypage.php?content=footer&act=1

*How is the community run?*
The monitoring community runs in the concept of transparent governance. The
details has been provided in
http://monitoringforge.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/Www/transparent_governance.

*
What is the Benefit to the community/Sys-Administer?*
Excluding the vast amount of projects and plugins which is present in the
site. The community has been also running three important projects which can
be beneficial to the community

   1. Job Posting Board. The idea behind this project is to connect job
   opportunities with participants. Community members who are actively
   participating in the community, would benefit by been noticed companies, who
   would require the similar special skill set been exhibited by your community
   involvement.
   2. Advertise in Monitoring forge. Folks who have projects/plugins which
   would help the community as a whole can advertise in the site. If you are
   interested in learning more, please contact Tara Spalding at
   tspalding@gwos.com
   3. Write the Flippin' Monitoring Manual - This project allows all user
   and developers to learn about the various Open source monitoring system and
   management platforms which are available currently. They have also included
   HOWTO on general usage, options/way to extend your monitoring system with a
   plugin. They also talk about the various platforms API's and developers kits
   which can be used by Sys-Admin Folks.

Correct. Once I had a conversation with one of the Dell Guys on twitter. I
asked him why they "Recommend Windows". All they could say was, "There are
also models that come with no OS preinstalled."

That said, Take a look at this. Especially the 6th point:

Personally, I feel microsoft shouldn't die. It will be actually bad for the
open source community. Microsoft is the one that unites all Free Software
people IMHO. It should shift towards open source. Maybe it will..
eventually..

Yes. That was the real shocker for me... But as long as they comply to the
rules laid down by the Open Source Initiative / FSF, things are going to be
fine with Open Source within microsoft. What's astounding is the number of
open source projects they do..  They probably want to selfishly
get benefited out of it. But you can never say.. ;-)

and btw, check out their open source community site:
http://port25.technet.com/
<http://port25.technet.com/>and their open source project hosting site..
http://www.codeplex.com/

<http://www.codeplex.com/>Really interesting stuff.

their open source lab is huge - possibly the best funded lab for open source

Sadly, yes :(  But they also seem to be funding some open source projects
outside of Microsoft. Like Apache, it says on the site that they are the
platinum sponsors for the Apache project !! I don't quite understand why
they would fund a direct competitor (IIS). Intriguing..

Yes, as long as it is in English. My guess is Amachu wrote in Tamil.
For that 10 KB limit is small, isn't it?
We should figure out some way to make Tamil postings work well.
Mailman has problems with Tamil mails, especially in digest mode.

if they do not, then lot of people will start using apache on linux instead of 
apache on windows - which is why they also gave funds to php

Free world is not just a reaction to Microsoft monopoly / business
practices.

Hundreds of years of scientific / engineering development was based on
sharing information and learning from others.  That was artificially
interrupted using copyright to restrict freedom of others by clever software
vendors, Microsoft being the most successful and evil of the lot.

FOSS and ILUGC are the natural way to develop and use software, it is not
just a reaction to Microsoft.

Without Microsoft FOSS / ILUGC will very well exist and flourish.

Linus Torvalds quote:

"Really, I'm not out to destroy Microsoft. That will just be a completely
unintentional side effect."

I am wondering why there are no other FOSS groups in colleges.

"ILUGC and NRCFOSS are going to many colleges and conducting events."
Heard this from a college lecturer.

How do we follow those college students further?

we can ask them to join ilugc list.
What if they are not joining in list?

It will be nice if we start a small group in those colleges
and guide them to grow in FOSS world.

I believe the above link applies to the US market.   The Dell mini
store sales (in Croma) categorically told me Dell Mini is available
with Windows 7 only and that only the Vostro models can be ordered
with Ubuntu.

HP mini does come with FREEDOS and @ 15K is an attractive price.

"Patents" have existed since the 16th century.
Almost all scientific / engineering development is protected.
Forget the west, we had a big fight between TVS and Bajaj over an engine
technology and TVS lost...
The problem is definitely not what Microsoft created, it is something to do
with "business"

BTW I am not a fan of MS. I am a big fan of Linux.

I think no one from NRCFOSS is in list except Kenneth.

What the "Open Source Lab" syllabus is doing is

Giving a car to students and lecturers.
Asking them learn the following things.

traffic rules
driving
repairing
troubleshooting

in 45 periods.

There wont be any guidance to students and staff.
Yes. There may be PDF files, presentations on how to do them.

But, can you imagine what will happen?

Lot of accidents and frustrations.

Finally, somehow they will finish it.
But for the lifetime, they wont come near to any car.

The same will happen for the Anna Univ Students and Lecturers.
With no guidance, preparation, This syllabus will make the people
to RUN away from linux after their college.

I dont know who are the genius people
responsible for preparing and accepting this as syllabus.

It is clear that they have no idea on what they are doing.

If the syllabus is going to make the students RUN away from linux,
it is our responsibility to oppose it.

We should show them the right path and how to do it.

Can anyone say that is NRCFOSS responsible for this syllabus?

Can anyone from NRCFOSS accept or reject this?

As I've mentioned before, that syllabus won't be 'taught' atleast for
another year - so NRCFOSS has time.

If my understanding of the Anna Univ syllabus process is correct, then
the syllabuses are revised atmost once per four years. So if they
missed including the Open Source Lab this year, it might've had to
wait for a few years more before being accepted - subject to
edupolitical issues, it might've never made it. So even though it is
half-baked and incomplete now, it is better than nothing. And, I'm
sure that NRCFOSS will be able to develop competent supporting
material within the year's end. I hope.

However, it *would* be nice if we could get some news directly from
NRCFOSS instead of speculating and assuming things. Anyone?

Also, fyi, most students run away from programming after (and during)
college anyway, so it's not much of a departure :)

True.

Instead, we discussing about this,
Let us wait for someone from NRCFOSS reply
on their activities on Anna University Syllabus.

As I understand, patents are designed to +share+ information (for a fee),
not to hide.

Scientists publish papers which have to be peer reviewed, sharing of
procedures and other information is a must.

Engineers / inventors design new processes for which they can obtain patents
by filing information with patent authority. Anyone else using the process
should get a licence (paying a fee) and access the information.

Software vendors did not use patent where they agree to disclose their
processes for a fee,  but copyright to close source and hide knowledge.

FOSS is not about money, but about access to knowledge. Restricting that
access was invented by software vendors, Microsoft being the most successful
among them.

Going off topic, But Bajaj had a patent - do you think they would have
allowed TVS to use it even if they were willing to pay crores of rupees to
access the information? My point was even in the engineering world you can
control who gets to see what and who gets to use what.

I don't think it is that simple. I guess we need to start another thread to
discuss this!
Well if you buy a car with an ABS system, do you think GM or TATA or Maruthi
is going to give you it's embedded software source code or the source code
of the engine management software because you have bought their product and
you want the freedom to modify it?

Patents inherently are not *bad*. In fact, they are /required/ in mechanical 
related industries to protect and nurture innovation. However, Patents in the 
software industry are bad because creating a patent for software is equivalent 
to patenting ideas as opposed to objects/mechanisms (like the auto industry). 
Copyright suffices as adequate protection for software.

Like myself when I was beginning to appreciate the ideals behind FOSS, a lot of 
FOSS enthusiasts get carried away into thinking everything relating to FOSS 
ought to extend and hold true beyond software. This, I know now is incorrect. I 
suggest that people should read all sides of issues like patents, *understand* 
these issues and then decide for themselves the stand that they want to take.

cheers,
- steve

I am not a lawyer, but as a layman I would expect the patent laws to
stipulate a fee for which anyone can access the innovation and use.

Software,  yes. If they are distributing software (embedded or otherwise),
they better make the source code available so that user can be free of
vendor dependence.

GM, TATA or Maruthi cars can be serviced by third party mechanics. Only with
open source software similar servicing can be done for the software driven
components.

Definitely NO.

Do not expect the reply here from any one of NRCFOSS employees include Mr.Kenneth. There are many other present/ex NRCFOSS people are watching this list. But they cant take any responsibilities. They are here just because of their interest in FOSS/GNU Linux.  

So you have to reach them. Its very easy.
You may send all your comments/queries to Mr.C N Krishnan, Project Coodrinator of NRCFOSS, AU-KBC. He is the right person to clear all your queries reg the subject. You can reach him by cnkrish@au-kbc.org

I did not mean Unicode took up space. In fact i assumed English mails were
also encoded in utf-8 only.

It is bigger because:

* Tamil sentences will be longer (have more words) than their English
equivalents.
   Translate any English passage, you can understand what I mean.

* Words expressed in Tamil will take up more character space than English.
   (or equal. Its rare other way)
   Examples:
GNU - ???? [3 in Eng - 4 in Tamil]
Linux - ??????? [5-7]
Python - ???????? [6 - 8]
*All acronyms*

And if, as you say, english mails are in ascii and only other language mails
get utf-8 encoding
in mailman, then there is a three way increase in size, isn't it?

PS: I'm not arguing that size limit should be increased, or that Tamil mails
always get missing.
       Rather, my concern is that legitimate Tamil mails can end up blocked.

there is no proof for this statement - it is just a misapprehension - patents 
are bad because they hinder development, and this is true in all fields of 
endeavour. In the old old days, one had to employ a lawyer because only 
lawyers were allowed to know the law. Nowadays knowledge of law is open - but 
strangely enough people still employ lawyers - and there is constant 
innovation among lawyers. Imagine a lawyer who finds a loophole in the law, 
patenting the use of the loophole and preventing others from using them 
without a fee.

and don?t want to burn the image, you can view details of the volume
with a simple command:

isoinfo -d -i filename.iso

You?ll be given details like the volume size, if the image file is a

Absolutely not. We decided to sell off our Palio because we were not happy
with "big" service provider and our favorite mechanic could not handle this
car because he could neither "afford" to buy or "maintain standards" for his
tiny shed to be approved to take an analyzer/setting up application from
Fiat.

Again, all I am trying to say is that it's not just Microsoft which is
taking away freedom from us. It's just that most of us are software geeks
and we can play around with source code and we feel freedom has been taken
away. I am sure there are lots of mechanically inclined people feel the same
way when the car they "bought" does not allow them to tweak with the engine
setting to make it work the way they want it to...

it's going to be a disaster then! :) if one think patents should be there for
certain industries to preserve their innovation, then my question is why 
it's not applicable for IT industry? (It doesn't matter whether components 
are software or hardware). Actually from the article/link posted in the thread, 
nothing much to cheer about it rather continue to focus on what we're interested 
and I strongly believe the next generation people would recognize the advantages of 
F/OSS and also certainly think about the merits & demerits of prop software. One must 
understand, it may take longer time than what we anticipate since the depth of prop
product's dependency spread across in some of world's largest institutions/corporations.

For example, my firm have around more than 0.5 million people (approx) across
the globe, if you look at business units, they all prefer and continue to be with 
what exists there already (most of them are prop softwares and you can't change things 
or prop --> F/OSS within some specified time or even you can't talk about that more 
since they business; sponsors for all IT Ops! it may be like this: start building 
business apps and reduce the prop softwres dependencies, show the cost savings, speak to
then with facts/results, move ahead with desktop computing. 

I do this: Don't think too much the about the organization which keeps selling prop 
software and keep cursing whenever we talk about them with other F/OSS fellow/peers, 
nothing really going to stop them immediately! rather look at your community/region 
around,focus on promoting F/OSS and helping people either through any public forum 
or offline on how to come up with good things by using F/OSS tools.

+1
Absolutely true.

Coming back to my example - Bajaj vs TVS. TVS could have developed the
technology independently. Coincidently if it was the same a Bajaj - they
need to dump it. This will hinder development

Message-ID: <AANLkTimW8x6IkYDJ9SRMShOqRHJf03GVrV2Fa5Aktmfj@mail.gmail.com>

Hi friends

I am on Debian and  FreeBSD  for quite some years now. Don't use Windows at
all.

I am volunteer for http://missingindiankids.com. I get email alerts of
missing kids'  posters, in pdf format. My job is to take print outs and
stick those in public places. I concentrate mainly sticking posters in
Cinema Halls.

I would prefer to have the all information in the pdf posters to be in
Tamil, so that anybody can read and understand.

Kindly suggest some good tools to do the conversion.

Warm regards

Nataraj

No. ?? is stored as ? + ?. That is U+0B95 U+0BC1. Only during rendering they
are combined
and displayed properly. Similarly for all others characters too. See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_script#Tamil_in_Unicode
for Table listing of all letters storage. This is very illustrative: ????
--> 0B95 0BCD 0BB7 0BBF.

Although it is desirable to have one Unicode code for each character, it is
not possible since Unicode has allocated onle 128 codes whereas Tamil has
more than 300 characters including grantha forms. This has been a source of
many controversies.
See http://unicode.org/faq/tamil.html and
http://www.unicode.org/Public/5.1.0/ucd/NamedSequencesProv.txt for further
details.

please check out the unicode encoding.

you are right - I was thinking of the proposed scheme that each alphabet

Great work. We need more and more samaritans like you.

I don't have an answer for your question.

Perhaps you could use a vector font like latha.ttf which is freely
available for Tamil and
 do the conversion?

There are many in LUG who are very good at localization.

Best of luck.

I think, the posters are in English and received in pdf format.  There is no
Tamil content. OP is not looking for conversion but translation (pdf -->
text in English --> text in Tamil --> printout).

Translating from English to Tamil has to be done manually. Look at the
posters, type the tamil content in OO and export to PDF (not a solution
really!).

Hi,

Good work.

Please explain more on your requirement.
Is all the content in PDF in Tamil ?

If so, why converting again?

If the existing PDF content is in English,
we need to translate in to Tamil, then type it.

Please share a sample PDF file,
so that we can get the correct requirement.

Thanks for the service.

A lawyer finding a loophole in the law is probably again an idea (as opposed to 
a mechanism). Patents were created to grant protection for time and effort 
involved in inventing mechanisms. It is well suited to an /engineering/ environment.

Patents are awarded to the first person to *disclose* an invention, *not* to the 
person who would like to keep it secret.

Supposed you are a garage mechanic who spends years developing a new and 
efficient carburetor. This is a fairly tedious time consuming and costly affair 
for individuals. However, if you invent this new carburetor, you apply for a 
patent by *disclosing* the manner in which the carburetor functions so that on 
the one hand people understand how your carburetor works and can build on top of 
it and on the other hand those big companies who have the resources to can't 
just copy the design and mass produce the carburetor on their conveyor belts.

You might also reap the rewards for your invention to continue further 
innovation if one of the big companies licenses the use of your patent.

Now, to compare this with software I can't do any better than:
http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/basics/index.html
http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/basics/whatis.html

In any case, like i said, make your up your own mind on basis of what you makes 
most sense only after you've actually thought about it, not just because some 
geek god believes happens to think a certain way.

I for one, believe patents in the software and pharmaceutical field do not make 
sense. In software, for reasons cited in the link above and in medicine, for 
humanitarian reasons. OTOH, I think patents in the mechanical and electrical 
industry specifically are, or at least were, useful. If you need proof that 
patents actually help inventors, read up on:

there are always two schools of thought regarding patents - one that they 
encourage innovation and the other that they discourage innovation. There are 
enough arguments on both sides to convince anyone. What I find strange is the 
view that patents are bad in some fields - software, medicine and good in other 
fields.

But the point is how does innovation come about. When one says linus wrote 
linux - actually what he did was modify minix and release it as linux. When 
RMS wrote gcc - he took an existing compiler and modified it. So it is when a 
guy in Coimbatore made a submersible pump - he took an existing pump and 
modified it. Yes, there have been inventions that are totally from scratch and 
totally revolutionary and not built on work done by some one before (I cannot 
off hand remember one - but there must be any number) - so the concept that one 
has to pay royalty or get permission (or maybe even be denied permission) to 
use pre existing work ...

Subject: [Ilugc] Call for incentives to those taking up Tamil computing
	projects
Message-ID: <20100627123336.205950@gmx.com>

?for those who are interested in language computing: 

The State government should provide incentives to those who carry out projects in Tamil computing, Chairman of the Board of Governors of IIT-Kanpur and local organising committee of the Tamil Internet Conference (TIC) 2010 M. Anandakrishnan said on Saturday.

About one lakh projects were taken up in colleges in the State every year. However, only a handful of them pertained to Tamil computing, he told a function to mark the distribution of prizes to students who won contests organised as part of the TIC.

Deputy Chief Minister M.K. Stalin gave away the prizes to the State-level winners and also released a special souvenir that had 130 articles. Emphasising that greater support should be given to promote the use of Tamil computing, he said that the State government should declare a policy that in the computers purchased for government departments, schools and colleges, the opening screen should be in Tamil when booted.

In an effort to sustain the interest of children in Tamil computing, they should be encouraged to use computers for activity-based learning. For instance, students could collect data and information related to the local economy, history and social issues and feed these in Tamil in the computer and also sort the information in Tamil. The secretariat for Tamil computing should be located with that of classical Tamil, he added.

About 8,000 school students and nearly 3,800 college students participated in the competitions. Dr. Anandakrishnan said prizes would be given away to district-level winners soon.

Among those present were Ministers for Higher Education, School Education and Information Technology, K. Ponmudy, Thangam Thennarasu and Poongothai Aladi Aruna, Chief Secretary K.S. Sripathi and Principal Secretaries for Higher Education and IT K. Ganesan and P.W.C. Davidar.

Hi

Yes.

pdf -->text in English --> text in Tamil --> printout).

This is exactly what I want. I need to tell you that my native language is
not Tamil, but I am able to read Tamil well, but not quite deft at writing.


May be somebody can help me with the translation?  Please download from the
web site www.missingindiankids.com.

And if you don't mind please put up some posters somewhere many people can
view. :-)

Warm regards

I suggest you go ahead and inform the list when and where and what you are
going to teach.

People will come.

The general convention is that LUG marketing is suited and accepted only
for non commercial talks.

However you are free to charge money in case you provide snacks/tea/food.

I have learnt a lot by teaching various tech topics to LUG.

And I am planning to give a linux device driver training soon.

The trainer bio is not very important. What counts is how well you can
 share your knowledge.

Having ability is one thing. Being able to take it to the masses is yet another.

Only if you have a clear and deep understanding your knowledge can be of
value to others.

Just go ahead and arrange a talk. It will help you more than it will
help others.

Best of luck.

What's so strange about it ? I find at least two sites dedicated to the fight 
against software patents suggesting the same (albeit as a passing reference):

http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/basics/whatis.html (the last 2 points)
http://stopsoftwarepatents.org/myth (4th myth)

One should not generalize rules arbitrarily across non-associated domains, even 
if they appear to be similar on the surface. For instance, moving in the other 
direction, ie: from some external field to software -- it does not make any 
sense to apply the rules for broadcasting and publication to online media 
although that doesn't stop our Indian 'cyber police' from trying to do so.

Well, I don't know about the coimbatore guy's submersible pump but I am willing 
to bet if he hasn't patented his invention neither with anyone else.

Now, that i think about it, this issue is quite similar to the GPL/BSD debate.

Sharing of someone's creations, IMHO, should happen under the terms decided by 
the creator. With GPL this implies that if you want to build on top of the 
creator's work you recognize her, and offer the 'built-on' creation under the 
same terms as offered to you. You, if I am not mistaken, believe in the BSD 
philosophy that work should be open without restrictions, right ?

Anyways, returning back to patents, lest anyone thinks I am mixing up things, 
that digression in the paragraph above only goes to prove that patents are not 
necessary for protecting (or not) the rights of the creator of software. 
Copyright is sufficient.

As far as other non-software creations are concerned, that might not be the case.

cheers,

Subject: [Ilugc] Wifi Icon is available but Not able to find my modem
Message-ID: <AANLkTimNdqtzjl2SjBob4nXJxqjB82y_X30FiTy3efDz@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

 Recently I have upgraded to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Desktop Edition (32 bit) on my
HP TX 1003 Laptop. Now I cannot find my wifi modem, The wifi is enabled in
the system and able to see the icon still could not search the modem.
I have installed most wifi related packages using *Synaptic manager.*

Is there any packages to be installed?

Note: the wifi modem is switched on and is working find on windows machines

Thanks in Advance.

Dear All
I am upgrading my laptop from Fedora12 to fedora13.
Inserted the DVD and followed the instruction. Now it is showing a message
for more than half an hour.
The message is "Finishing upgrade process. This may take a little while.".
Is it safe to reboot the system ???

The quote from wikipedia about NRCFOSS
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRCFOSS

"NRCFOSS, an acronym for the National Resource Centre for Free/Open Source
Software, is an organisation created and financed in India by the
Department of Information Technology,
Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, Government of
India in April 2005.[1] It is jointly
administered by the Chennai Division of Centre for Development of
Advanced Computing (C-DAC) and
the AU-KBC Research Centre of Anna University. Some state governments,
for example Kerala, already have
programmes to popularize FOSS among the masses especially among the students."


"The founding of NRCFOSS is the first initiative by the Government of
India in the direction of making efforts for increasing the acceptance
of FOSS at a national level.
NRCFOSS is designed to give a boost to the efforts to popularize FOSS
products among lay computer
users of India."


The billion dollar question among the computer users in India now!


*  Has NRC-FOSS done its job in promoting FOSS in India since 2005 ???

*  If not, do we need such anorganization anymore ???

*  Will Government of India Listen to lay computer users of India ???

Friends.

It is being a mini-project time.

Getting a lot of enquiries from students for a mini project.

They are planning to do the same-old
ticket booking system, college website, library management system etc.
as their staff ask to do with database systems.

Instead of doing those, it will be nice if we make them to contribute
to real open source softwares.

Please share here, if you know any open source projects that needs contribution.
We can have a list and show to the students.
They can pick and work on them.
We can guide them to learn languages, use irc, mailing lists,version
management tools,
then we can leave them to upstream developers.

Please share your thoughts on this.

Thanks.

1)  Mobile App Developer : to develop the mobile version of the site. (to
allow easy additions to the map). This component will be release in the OSS
arena - so i am looking for an app in such a way that it can be easily
reused in apps which require easy additions to maps.

2) A good UI(HTML/CSS skils) designer would help in revamping the site.

For further details, please go through the site and then contact me.

Project idea:

A server that can speak bluetooth and/or wifi installed in bus shelters that
can tell commuters bus schedules. The commuters should be able to use their
mobile phones to query the server for the route numbers that will take them
to their destinations and the expected arrival time of those buses - which
have a GPS unit installed.

A server installed in the bus can update passengers about the expected
arrival time to their destinations!

Hi Girish

Its not quite  being a good samaritan.  Working on software involves too
much of abstract kinda life. Again dabbling in OS - varieties of those,
Linux,BSDs,arm-linux,  uclibc - being a kinda obsessed with anything... It
goes on, you know. Once in a while I need to come of out it, to be in
contact with the 'real world' out there, out of the computer room.  Real
world is not abstract but hard hitting, like say, visiting a goverment
office to get some certificates or roaming about to get a gas connection, or
else standing in the long queue of a hospital.

regards

Nataraj

Interesting idea. A system that uses an RFID sensor installed in bus
shelters can sense the arrival of buses (fitted with RFID transmitters) and
appropriately update its bus location database. But I think it would be much
more complex and the location information will be of a lesser resolution
than a GPS!

Forgive the use of terminology wrt to RFID!

This is already being/was done in India. I think buses in bangalore were
fitted with some sort of tracking device - but am not sure whats its state
of operation now.

RFIDs are generically very shot range. For it to cover the distance between
the bus and the bus shelter (especially considering the drivers stopping the
bus at will) you might require some exotic variant which might be costlier
than a GPS+GPRS solution. Effectively a smart phone with GPS is enough to
act the server in the bus.

I think even in Chennai, some buses have been fitted with a GPS+GPRS system
that will inform a server its locations. The project idea is to have a
communication system in place in bus shelters which commuters can connect to
and query the system.

Slightly making it OT, there is a site which makes the live MTC GPS data of
 available online but works only on IE. *Sick*

http://alert.net.in/eta/ Its been there for almost a year now, but wonder
how many people use it.There was no PR what so ever and sometimes the data
is not useful as not all buses on a route are GPS enabled.

instead of looking at wikipedia, I suggest you look at the following sites:
http://nrcfoss.au-kbc.org.in
http://nrcfosshelpline.in

I would say nrc-foss has done it's job - and a lot of it thanks to the active 
support and participation of members of the Chennai, Mumbai, Pune LUGs as well 
as very many FOSS enthusiasts from all over India.

I was wondering if a "NRCFOSS Partnered and Trusted" helpline wherein
the "Trusted" implies "It is OK for alternate member round robin would
take the current task at an agrred upon price (calculated based on
agreed upon price per bench per duration) which is payable to the
member who owns the process" plus whatever the service recipient would
like to award the "Consortium" as a token of appreciation which will
then be shared on the following basis: 1/2rd for the owner of the
process, 1/3rd for the consortium, 1/6th for the mebers of consortium
and 1/6th for further research and encouragement to the
NextGen-<whatever> by sponsoring students education etc.

Above, of course, are my humble opinions.

Regards,

Rajagopal

PS: I am cc-ing to ilug-bom and centos so that the idea can be
thrashed out and a viable support infrastructure can be achieved
before next "couple of years".

Thanks for the Ideas.

But, we need more inputs for this to get more students
to do some real projects.

Please think on your requirements.
Add your ideas here.

We can get the students to make the ideas into reality.
Your ideas/requirements will be a great starting point
to some students to contribute to the open source community.

I am not sure if I understand you, but when we get commercial orders for 
setting up things, we have asked LUG people to execute the work on a revenue 
sharing basis. At times, they do the work in the name of NRC-FOSS and we share 
the revenue with them. This is because being a government organisation, other 
university/govt organisations are comfortable dealing with us as they need not 
go through the 3 bid system. At other times, we just recommend and supervise 
work done by community members who deal directly with the client and are paid 
directly. This at present is being done on a case to case basis. But if it can 
be organised in a more structured way - no problem doing it. In fact it looks 
like a good idea to do something on the lines of what you are suggesting. 
Thoughts anyone?

I am not sure if there was an announcement . This domain now hosts a
wiki which was earlier/even now at wikia .
http://fci.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page

It had been started by praveen and other SMC(swatanthra malayalam
computing) team .

Unfortunately the wiki is getting heavily spammed . Hence the front
page keeps on getting vandalised.

Hi Murali,

Dont psot such blind messages. Did you read the documentation on
oracle site on installing oracle in linux. Do you have the required
packages. Is your installer running fine or what error messages it is
throwing. what steps you took. what is your machine architeture.

with regrads

it seems that you have not filled in the details required in

Between CentOS and Ubuntu, go for CentOS. I prefer Ubuntu for desktop and
CentOS or Open SuSe for server.

None. AFAIK both of them perform the same way. Apache httpd is most
widely used and has most support modules. httpd is pretty easy to use
and configure. If you want a web server that works fine for production
use with least trouble i suggest you go with apache httpd with worker
mpm. But there are other that claim to be better in performance than
httpd. Like lighttpd, ng-htppd, etc. Explore your options. I think
which web server you use matters more than which distro you use. If
you use non-conventional method of choosing other httpd than apache,
it would be interesting to know your experinces, esp if you are using
in high traffic environment. I have extensive experince in configuring
and troubleshooting apache httpd in high traffic enviroment. But i am
bored of it and looking for other web server bechmarks and usability
and stuff like that.

he said 'webserver', but the context shows that he is asking about an OS for a

balakumar,

Are you asking for "server on the web " or "webserver". Can you clarify?

0. Before starting installation, you should read installation documentation
more than one time.
1. Oracle installation required static IP.
2. Host name is not compulsory.
3. Before starting Database installation, Environment Variables should be
properly defined after DBA user creation.
4. Necessary Permission is required
5. After DB installation,  check out listener service and create if
required.

Message-ID: <AANLkTime48DeKmvVzFF_PK5b8tsbxXhZ4o2BUu-ajmc8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi LUG members,

I started with Ubuntu 8.04 but never enjoyed GNOME looks so moved to
KDE till memory hog named KDE 4 came out, even KDE 4.1 was slow on my
system(512MB RAM, 1.73GHz core duo), so I moved to Xubuntu whose light
interface runs pretty well on my system apart from the fact that X
server crashes [~once a week], I verified with other friends using
Xubuntu that XFCE is not very stable and crashes do occur. (I have no
intentions to debug or debate why these crashes occur, so I reuqest
you to please do not debate on that).

I wonder which releases do LUG members recommend with following four features
1) User has good enough experience with system(most work is done from
command line) the only reason to start X server for me is to run
Firefox and pidgin
2) Plain interface similar to XFCE but does not crash
3) Is not memory hog (like KDE 4)
4) must be fast(user hates compiz and any such flying effects)

I have heard that archlinux is fast and simple but unstable, any
comments on that?
(or may be on BSD based distros?)

Install 'openbox' and on start up don't load GNOME. I remember
installing openbox and having it show up in GDM as an option. Then you
can just do whatever else you like.

You might also be interested in 'awesome'.

Arch Linux would suit this user very well. Arch is simple, fast and
bleeding-edge.

Again, Arch linux is good. It is not unstable afaik. I use
Arch+Xmonad. Runs smooth as silk.
Their wiki is amazing and it will help you set everything up.

I personally prefer Slackware Linux for its simplicity and ease of use for
the power user. I would also recommend you to try out  Zenwalk,
Arch Linux and Vector Linux. All of these distributions boot
fast and are very lean on resources.

Regarding stability, I found Slackware to be very stable and
highly customizable while being light-weight and fast.

You might want to look into the following Window managers:
   - IceWM (Very fast, light weight and stable)
   - Enlightenment DR16 (Robust, feature-rich and yet light weight)
   - Window Maker (Light weight, fast and stable)
   - OpenBox (Stable and fairly light weight).

Of course, for a good terminal - I recommend using RXVT-Unicode
with GNU Screen.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

staff evaluation system. all the iso certified institutions have to get
feedback about the staff members from their students. in most colleges this
is done only through manual work. i suggest that a software can be developed
for this. this can be designed in such a way that it suits for all type of
organizations. because feedback are taken/necessary in most institutions.

additionally we should remove the fear of linux from the students. most
students beleive that if u want to learn linux, they should memorize a lot
of linux & linux is the most toughest language in the world. these myths
among the students should be broken.


i suggest that during any intro talks in colleges the speakers should plan a
session in which they must show that we can do what ever it is possible in
windows graphically can also be done here graphically

Hello  Murali Babu

Please check is there any entry for the host name "oel45.localdomain" in the
file /etc/hosts?

if there's no entry then add new entry for the host name  oel45.localdomain
with proper ip address
or if the entry is already there in the file, please check the ip address
for that entry.
