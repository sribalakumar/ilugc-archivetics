unless you change the code, python uses precompiled code - so the interpreter 
does all the hard work only the first time it is run

I remember some time in the previous century yahoo! stated they were moving 
from 'legacy C programming' to php (with a lot of reasons why they did not 
choose perl) (since google had grabbed python, yahoo! could not consider 
python without loss of face). I was a perl guy then and remember being highly

actually in today's 'web2.0' world, the only mantra is turnaround time - how 
fast you get into production. Resources (with the exception of developer time) 
are cheap and plentiful, so most of the criteria applicable in the previous 
century are only of academic value. (note that this is the personal opinion of 
a non programmer)

You look like a million dollars.  All green and wrinkled.

$ fortune -s

It is a game but meant for people who don't like computer games. It

They did not move from 'legacy C programming' to PHP. Rather they moved from
proprietary to open Source.
They had
- 8.1 Million c/c++ code
- 3.0 Million perl code
- 612 developers

They had Filo (named after David Filo) pages written in C.
The application logic was in C++ which gave them fast execution speed (which
is what I have been talking about that writing in C gives you faster
applications). The disadvantage was C/C++ not being conducive to rapid
prototyping.
Finally when they moved to PHP. After moving to PHP the learnt some lessons
and finally had to move to C/C++ extensions and traded off flexibility with
speed.

Even as of this moment all the platform stuff still happens in C. Some
examples used in very high demanding situation (mail - qmail platform,
filesystem to serve geocities, etc). And there is still lot of stuff that
still uses perl.

It is now a famous presentation by Michael J Radwin. It is good reading and
I was quite inspired
by this in one of my previous company when we took help (in 2002) of the
below presentation to convince our management and investors to move to Open
Source

Again, it comes down to the algorithm used. If the algorithm used in C is
poor, then it is likely to be slower than the same functionality
implemented in a higher level language using a better algorithm.

Ultimately, a language has to be decomposed down to a bunch of
instructions in machine code.

The number and nature of these instructions in machine code and the number
of machine cycles that it would take to execute will determine the speed
of the operation. Ofcourse, you can optimize this further by executing
multiple instructions in parallel (if your architecture supports it).

Since C is just a very thin abstraction over assembly language, it will
tend to be quicker than pretty much anything else out there. Which also
explains why the Linux kernel is implemented in it. The only thing quicker
would be to get the compiler to output the code in assembly language and
then hand optimize the code before running it through an assembler.

+1.
I agree to this. I knew the 'art of programming' was challenged when ORM
appeared on the scene :D
Nevertheless, this 'web 2.0' garb has forgotten the good old 'box softwares'
and the need-for-speed.
Cheap hardwares have taken precedence over writing some efficient code.

Also, a new sub-culture that i have seen in the last few years is the "I
read blogs - i know everything" thinking which continues to amuse/amaze me.

But, i think we cant generalize the observations based on web 2.0 arena
alone. IRC is filled with some smart a$$e$ who continue to humble me with
their intelligence.

1. Use a proper subject line.

2. Do not troll in the mailing list

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll

3. Use [OT] for off-topic, non-technical discussions.
But, don't misuse this to start flame wars or to troll
in the mailing list.

4. Do not top-post:

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting

Example of a top-post:

Because it messes up the order in which
people normally read text.

Top-posting.
> > What is the most
> > annoying thing in e-mail?

Always use bottom-posting.

> What is your name ?
My name is ILUGC.

5. Do not over-quote:

Example of an over-quote:

>>> On Friday you said
>>> blah blah blah
>> On Saturday you said
>> foo foo foo
> On Sunday you said
> foobar

6. Do not post HTML messages

7. Do not recycle messages

8. Do not send attachments

9. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical legal
disclaimers. If your company uses disclaimers, don't
use your company ID for the mailing list.

10. Do not reply to a digest. (If you are in digest
mode and want to reply to a post use ILUGC Gmane blog
interface.

Link:
http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc

11. Search for answers for your questions/problems in
google.com or any other search engine before posting
your query to the mailing list.

If any of the above are not clear to you, Please read
the detailed list guidelines:

Link:
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

12. Do not post messages in all capital letters. Mails
in CAPS is considered rude and is similar to shouting
during a conversation.

13. Following these guidelines could be helpful
http://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/

14. Don't send season's greetings or birthday invites
to the group. Its not mailing list etiquette.

We must use the above guidelines to maintain better
readability, proper archives, efficient bandwidth
usage, etc.

check out this link, here the author has used a perl script to create

If you want to stress Apache, there are plenty of options.

If you wish to develop something with shell tools there are many
options too like netcat, socat and so on. And specialized tools that
are meant
to do this.

I used to use an automated ftp mechanism. Also go to

http://search.cpan.org

and look for "apache stress" or get creative with search.

You are sure to find pearls.

Dear luggies,

I saw this page and liked it a lot for its poetry and wisdom.

http://www.hinduism.co.za/chanakya.htm

I went ahead and created fortune cookies.

This is how you need to use this.

Download these two files into /tmp like this.

$  wget http://gayatri-hitech.com/Misc/chanakya
http://gayatri-hitech.com/Misc/chanakya.dat

Now assuming that you already have fortune installed, do this:

sudo or su

# cp /tmp/chanakya /tmp/chanakya.dat /usr/share/games/fortunes/

Now become an ordinary user and check this.

$ fortune -f

If it lists Chanakya great. ;)

Otherwise ask me.

Now enjoy this with this command again and again.

$ fortune chanakya

-Girish

Please do follow Rahul's suggestion and look it up!

Take the following program in LISP:

 (def fact (n) (fact1 n 1))

 (def fact1 (n k) (cond
                    ((leq n 1) k)
                    (t (fact1 (sub 1 n) (times n k)))))

Let us translate this program/algorithm literally in C as:

 fact1(int n, int k) {
	if (n <= 1) 
		return k;
	else
		return fact1(--n,n*k);
 }

 fact(int n) { return fact1(n,1); }

It is quite likely[*] that the (compiled) LISP program will execute
faster and use less stack space than the C program. This is because
LISP compilers typically implement "tail recursion optimisation"
whereas C cannot (since C allows "side-effects").

These "operating system related" things is what C is optimal
for. There are a _lot_ of different uses for computers and for many of
them C is _not_ optimal --- even in the sense of efficiency.

Indeed, all Turing complete languages _can_ implement each other's
features through translation. However, such translations typically
involve a small per-instruction cost which becomes significant cost
when a big project is implemented. Thus, each language has its own
"domain of expertise".

A thought for this thread:

 "A carpenter who only uses a swiss-army knife would be a poor
 carpenter, so why do some programmers insist on using only one
 language?"

Regards,

Kapil.

[*] I have qualified my claim about this particular program since it
is not large enough for differences to really show up.

To access files via linux, you have to use the samba client. Type this in
the Nautilus addressbar or the "Connect To Server" in ubuntu:
     smb://<ip>/<share>
This will prompt you for authentication if needed. Please do tell me if I am
wrong or there are other methods.

Lovely. I too love fortune (using it since 1992). It is part of my signature
in my evolution mail client. Last year I managed to resurrect fortune and I
am maintaining the source as part of my IndiMail
<http://www.indimail.org>package. For those whose linux distro doesn't
bundle fortune can download it
from

https://sourceforge.net/projects/indimail/files/mailpack/mailpack-1.1/fortune-1.0.tar.gz/download

It has currently the following categories of fortune cookies.

art           definitions  humorists      literature        riddles
translate-me
ascii-art     drugs        kernelnewbies  love           paradoxum

I have included chanakya as part of IndiMail release 1.6.2. Your post has
given me the itch of compiling fortune cookies from (Thirukkural, Jataka
tales, Panchatantra, The Vedas, Bhagvad Gita, etc). Can we get together and
do something?

I have recommended this (and a host of other) accounting applications to a lot 
of people. However, one thing that keeps cropping up is, interoperability.

So, I'm just curious. Is there any accounting package that can 'read/write' or 
'import/export' tally files ?

Dear all,

Linux is fun, check it out 'sl' and 'sl -l'.

We all are aware of ls and ls -l, then  what about sl?

its all about the fun ride. lets check it out. A ride is small or larger

Hi

http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20091001154227155

"I love Red Hat. They stand alone alone so far among vendors, willing to
stand up and express what the FOSS community would really say if it
could speak with one voice to the Supreme Court. This is certainly what
*I* would say if I had that chance. And so I am satisfied. I was going
down the depressing list of briefs filed for Petitioner on the ABA's
list of filed amicus briefs, and it was so frustrating to see no one
saying anything like what I believe to be technically true about
software patents or addressing the specific needs of Free and Open
Source software. At last someone has told them what we wanted to say. I
just hope the Supreme Court has some techies in the clerk pool!"

I had to snip the output. It goes on and on in my Debian.

You also need to learn this ALL IMPORTANT command.

$ set -x

In all the shell scripts that you develop or use, you have to add this line to
figure out what is going on(Lot of debug outputs).

This is a life saver, hence my capitalization. Please
don't get me wrong.

Also I wish to wrap up with this bit.

$ var=10

$ echo $var
10

This also works in all shells.

It is useful to learn the shell semantics though you don't intend to
do shell scripting/programming.

Learning 'set' is a great way to begin.

No need to do this. Raman was quite correct. Fold is smart enough
not to break words!

And inside vim you want to do se textwidth=72 that does the same
thing. Wonder why you want to fold at 60 characters. The standard
is 72.

I wonder how to do it in perl/python. I don't have any idea at
the top of my mind.

I can perhaps spend an hour or two and do something. It is a great
way to learn when we tackle such trivial interesting problems with
rich real life value.

Unfortunately not right now. Maybe later.

If someone does it, of course it will be great and all of us could
learn. ;)

Could you copy/paste the exact invocation and error message ? Based on the info 
you've provided, it seems like a problem is with the capabilities of the 
terminal you are invoking gdb from rather than gdb itself.

For instance, on my system (Fedora 11) gdb is linked to libncurses, so I assume 
it would require a ncurses capable terminal. So, please also mention the 
terminal type that you are invoking gdb from.

Actually it did break the lines exactly at the 61st char and broke
quite a few of the words. Man of fold gave the following option
       -s, --spaces
              break at spaces

Thanks Prem, although, implicit in my request was the requirement for a FOSS 
tool to do this. The fact that someone has managed to build import/export in a 
closed manner is encouraging though.

Hopefully there are hackers out there with enough motivation and experience to 
try replicate this in an FOSS manner. The API used by rtslink is mentioned here:
   http://www.rtslink.com/rtslink.html
   http://www.rtslink.com/visualbasic.html
with samples of the XML data being used to communicate with the tally server here:

Converting thirukkural to fortune cookie ultimately turned out to be
quite interesting.
Shakthi updated me that Thirukkural's trademark is that it has two-line
representation of the kurals with four words in the first line, and
three on the second?

So I had to write a shell script to do this
#!/bin/sh
cat single.txt| while read line
do
    # fold all English sentences blindly
    echo $line | grep "[a-zA-Z]" > /dev/null
    if [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then
        echo $line | fold -s -w 72
    else
        # Fold only the lines other than the first 
        # two lines (which have 5 words or 3 words
        wc=`echo $line | wc -w`
        if [ $wc -gt 5 ] ; then
            echo $line | fold -s -w 72
        else
            echo $line
        fi
    fi
done

The script above is not efficient but it did the job. How would one do
that in perl/python?

That is really OK, whether he meant to insult or not, it was really helpful.
I found a better link for it in SSL
https://www.covalent.net/resource/documentation/faststart/2.1.0/userguide/html/sslfeatures.php
It gives you precise info.The reason i did not check out the wiki is because
it just has too much info.I do not require that much, only an overview

python is not in my mind. Here is perl solution.

 use Text::Wrap  $Text::Wrap::columns=60;
 $line='hello this is line very long and lengthy and perl will split it';
 print wrap('','',$line);

You are tempting me too much with perl+thirukkural combination. 

Here it is, but wrap may require some tuning for unicode
 
use Text::Wrap $Text::Wrap::columns= 72;
   
   open( $fh, "t.txt" );
   while ( $line = <$fh> ) {
       if ( $line =~ m/[a-zA-Z]/ ) {
           print wrap( '', '', $line );
       }
       else {
          $wc = split( ' ', $line );
          if ( $wc > 4 ) {
              print wrap( '', '', $line );
          }
          else { print $line; }
 
     }
 
  }
  close($fh);

As usual, there is more than one way in perl, indeed better ways.

Are the Fedora offline repository files available somewhere on the

It is the same as a Fedora mirror. Because we have it saved on an
external disk, we call it offline.

You can FTP or rsync any Fedora mirror repository:

I'd be quite interested to see the design / proposal doc for this, 
specially the bit about what problem you are looking to solve here. I 
know, there are many - and some interesting even, that need solutions at 
that level - just wondering which one you guys picked, why and how.

What are the chances that such a doc exists and something you might be 
willing to share ?

well, it has been quite convincingly argued that premature over

but sticking with common sense and knowing what you are doing, or 
reaching out to people who would, is always a good thing

I am not sure the question was so much about the scale of youtube's 
operations as much as the content side of things....

There are a few open source apps that try and give you a media portal, 
the sorts that would be welcome in an intranet. Out in the open its 
mostly a case of get the tools and components and build your own 
framework around it

Here's some python (<20 lines, no dependencies), with my test input.

Timing (in seconds):
python fold.py < fold.in > fold.out
0.0

# not unicode aware
python fold.py < thirukkural > thirukkural.out
0.0749998092651

# reads/writes utf-8
python fold.py < thirukkural > thirukkural.out
0.0979998111725

Speed it up, or reduce the loc (in the function fold, not the support cruft).

I had written a Thirukural browser -  Please feel free to use the following
to get the kural of your choice:
http://kavyasoftapps.net/thirukural/getkural.php?mode=2&kural=310
parameters:
mode=0 or 1 or 2
0 returns unicode Tamil kural with proper break formatting
1 returns English translation.
2 return the chapter
kural=1-1330, the kural number

I find this far less painful nowadays. Please install a CPAN module like this.

It is really excellent.

Now let us install

Audio::DSS

Do this.

# perl -MCPAN -e 'install Audio::DSS;'

In Debian, it justs asks me one question. Fantastic.

Before that find out which module you want from

the doc is in the making - and we live to share. Our thinking is like this: 
the vast majority of programmers produced by universities and institutes here 
are unemployable. Of course the mainstream industry in India which does 
outsourcing and does not produce software does not require programmers, they 
only need people who can produce code. But there is a growing segment of 
industry that *does* require something more. We are interested in certifying 
this competence. We are also backed by Annna University and the DIT in doing 
this certification. A person may pass a skills test with flying colours and may 
know the difference between an algorithm and an alligator, but may not be 
competent to enter the real world of producing software. We are leaning 
towards the idea of giving the examinee a code base in the language he is 
taking the certification in and requiring him to grok the code base and develop 
it further in specific ways. If he can, he passes, if not, he fails. The trick 
here is that the people who develop the certification should be experts in the 
language in question and should also have experience in making significant 
contribution to some FOSS product in the said language. And as with all our 
certifications the exam will be open book with access to the internet. Does 
this interest you? or do you think it is a load of crap?

This definitely sounds interesting.Most of the certifications around are not
'intensive' - the usual multiple choice Qs ; and that too stressing on the
syntax!
IF i read this right, i guess this is language certification or product
certification?

Also, am not sure whether you already have it in your To-DO , but i think
knowledge of version control would be great and a great add on.

like giving the examinee an existing svn repository and requiring him to 
perform various administrative tasks on it. The examiners sits remotely and 
regularly messes up the repo and the examinee will need to set it right.

Some might have heard of couchdb, an apache project, used for developing web

CouchDB makes Django look old-school in the same way that Django makes

Wait a minute. Am I missing something here? CouchDB is an erlang-based 
key-value store (ok, or more fancily, document-oriented distributed 
database). Django is a web framework. How are they comparable?

(-i prints MIME type)

file tells you the type of the file in question.

But DON'T trust file. It is only an indication. Sometimes it can go really
wrong.

For audio files like VOX and DSS you have other means to finding
out the playtime of audio files in that format. For reading id3 tags you
have other tools which one of you Luggers can tell others. ;)

Audio::DSS for DSS and sndfile for VOX. For all formats playable by
mplayer like
mp3, wav or whatever you can do:

$ mplayer -ao null -frames 0 -identify foo.mp3

You have to grep for the right lines and convert seconds to minutes if you want.

Even though the title is horrible, the article is worth reading for
the detailed information the author provides on what he considers are
the weaknesses of C.

Even though I/O has been pushed out to a C library we do not find many
people crafting their own libraries for these tasks. More importantly,
even those that do, stick to the "standard" interfaces.  This is
because "printf" and the like have been standardised.

There is no reason why proper memory management and exception handling
could not be provided by standardised C library interfaces.

There will always be programmers who will bypass the library and use
home-brewn alternatives but most people will use the standard way if
it is available (and hence taught in a first course on C).

Regards,

Kapil.

Functions like printf are so bad in design that you can't even use the
return status for checking
whether printf failed or succeeded.

Probably the best implementation of the C library is the
substdio<http://www.ezmlm.org/man/man3/substdio.3.html>interface
written by
djb <http://cr.yp.to/cv.html>. I use his functions extensively for my
IndiMail <http://www.indimail.org> project.

Some of the interfaces (I/O, String functions (stralloc), memory management
(alloc)) are given at
http://www.ezmlm.org/man/man3/

If you write functions like djb and use the functions in the way it is
intended, it is so difficult to write a buggy program. e.g. qmail was
written in 1997. There is a $500 award for anyone who finds a security hole
in qmail. The author's offer still stands
http://cr.yp.to/qmail/guarantee.html

To quote djb

"Write bug-free code.

I've mostly given up on the standard C library. Many of its facilities,
particularly stdio, seem designed to encourage bugs. A big chunk of qmail is
stolen from a basic C library that I've been developing for several years
for a variety of applications. The stralloc concept and getln() make it very
easy to avoid buffer overruns, memory leaks, and artificial line length
limits.

No, I did not say that! I did not mention who said that just to needle the

Coming from a high priest in the Django community, I guess they are
comparable!!

Its more than just a key value store. It speaks http (and only http). So you
want a resource, just use its URL to get it. Want to add a new record? Just
post it to the URL. No need for intermediate ORMs that will wrap a DB for
you and do all the translation.

It stores data in JSON format and its native language is javascript. So,
just knowing js is enough for the server side and browser side. And if you
get only JSON data from the server and build all the html in the browser, I
think that should make the server pretty fast - cuts all the intermediate
translation from native db format to html.

Add to this the ability to distribute it. So, I can have a web application
which can be entirely replicated in clients premises with a single command
(just get http://master_server_url/_replicate from the slave) and
periodically sync it with the master. Current web frameworks do not support
this use case! I think Karmic Koala makes it easier because it comes with
CouchDB built in.

If a component to component comparison is attempted, well, they are not
comparable. But if you look at it as serving 'http resources' they _are_
comparable.

There are no short cuts to writing a good bug free programs. Unfortunately, this is not taught in the schools/colleges.
I would like to give an example. The unix cat program. The original cat
program from ucb can be seen at
http://www.scs.stanford.edu/histar/src/pkg/cat/cat.c

It is well written and checks for error conditions. Any students in this
list should make a note of how each and every function is being checked
(including the printf's). Most programmers when writing a C program (or
for that matter even in perl, python, etc) rarely bother to check for
return code of very commonly used functions like printf, echo (in shell
scripts, perl, python, etc)

Example 1
==========
If i would write a program using the standard C library i would do
something like this

#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>
int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int             i;
    char            buffer[2049];
    FILE           *fp;

    for (i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
        if (!(fp = fopen(argv[i], "r"))) {
            fprintf(stderr, "fopen: %s: %s\n", argv[i],   
            strerror(errno));
            return (1);
        }   
        for (;;) {
            if (!fgets(buffer, sizeof (buffer) - 1, fp))
                break;
            printf("%s", buffer);
            if (ferror(stdout))
            {
                fprintf(stderr, "printf: %s\n", strerror(errno));
                fclose(fp);
                return (1);
            }       
        }
        if (ferror(fp))
        {   
            fprintf(stderr, "fgets: %s\n", strerror(errno));
            fclose(fp);
            return (1);
        }   
        fclose(fp);
    }
    return (0);
}

Example 2
=========
If I were to write the same program using djb's C library I would do the
following. (In fact I use the below in IndiMail in shell script to be
sure that if the output does not go where it is intended to go, then I
am notified of an error

#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

#include "error.h"

static char     ssinbuf[1024];
static substdio ssin = SUBSTDIO_FDBUF(read, 0, ssinbuf, sizeof ssinbuf);
static char     ssoutbuf[512];
static substdio ssout = SUBSTDIO_FDBUF(write, 1, ssoutbuf, sizeof
ssoutbuf);
static char     sserrbuf[512];
static substdio sserr = SUBSTDIO_FDBUF(write, 2, sserrbuf,
sizeof(sserrbuf));

void
logerr(s)
    char           *s;

    }
    logerr(error_str(errno));

Hey,

What's the point you're trying to make?  That substdio_* have
consistent error reporting by return value, while printf does not?

Also, as asides,
Why are logerr, and logerrf declared in K&R style?
What's "qmail-cat"?

This should be `s2', I guess.

You've snipped context, so maybe you're trying to followup on a point

Of course. Why not?

You need to put these two files on the same directory where you
run the CGI script and modify my path to point to that.

http://gayatri-hitech.com/Misc/chanakya
http://gayatri-hitech.com/Misc/chanakya.dat

For instance if you put it under /usr/lib/cgi-bin/, then you have to
modify the line to:

$out = `/usr/games/fortune /usr/lib/cgi-bin/chanakya`;

Best of luck.

I wrote my_error() much later. I used to write K&R style prior 2002. Bulk of

You can get someone with ubuntu on their PC to install apt-on-cd. This
package is simple to use graphical application. He just has to
download the applications you want, no need to install on that
machine. It will create an ISO file, which you can burn on CD/DVD or
copy to pen drive. Synaptic can use it as a repository.

Simply dumping the contents of the DVD to a directory, serving it over 
apache and adding the path to sources.list will work for a local machine 
as well as a lan with no internet access. There are probably automated 
tools for doing this.

I think this certification is for Open Source Programming Language like
Perl, Python and Ruby etc.. Not something like OS based certification like
Red Hat Certification .

I use 'approx' (with Debian but it also works with Ubuntu). This
creates an entry in '/etc/inetd.conf' for a server running at 9999.

You can now use the following lines (you must replace testing with the name of
your distro --- like jaunty or karmic) in /etc/apt/sources.list:

 deb http://localhost:9999/debian/ testing main contrib non-free
 deb http://localhost:9999/security testing/updates main contrib non-free

Finally, you can take all the debs that you have already downloaded
at import them with 'approx-import /path/to/downloaded/debs/*deb'

After this, you will not only get the debs you already have locally
but any updates will also be added to /var/cache/approx in a
directory structure like the one on the mirrors.

Kapil.

Alternatively, the entire ubuntu repository is available for download
as DVD images. You can download them, mount the isos, point to them in
your apt configuration and install packages offline. I think ubuntu
repository DVDs are about 5 in number.

So I heard, the only hiccup being the queries being in map/reduce, which 
makes it slightly more complicated to query than other key-value stores. 
Still, it being used to drive Karmic, is itself a pretty cool thing.

Agreed - but given the fairly sophisticated ORMs these days, I doubt how 
much of an upside that is. I don't mean to defend RDBMS too much though. 
They are lumbering giants of the past that need to go away, but we still 
need some of that relational goodness - so we have hybrids like MongoDB.

True. I think Twitter would've avoided a great deal of fail-whales if 
they went with a key-value store. But then, in 2006 nobody heard of 
NoSQL :). It's definitely cool that it's being used in Karmic - but I 
don't think CouchDB is ready to replace all sorts of web apps that are 
built by traditional web frameworks. I think Jacob is right about one 
thing though - this might very well be how the software of the future 
will look like. Thanks for the insights.

be made you can directly write a new file -
Hindi version of UI files
http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/editor/locale/lang.hi.js
English version
http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/editor/locale/lang.en.js
If you want to have translation in other language (ex tamil, telegu
etc..) then you can simply submit a new lang.<lang_code>.js file

You can read more on this technique at my blog -

Subject: [Ilugc] .a-tip-a-day (locate - find with batteries)
Message-ID: <7938ae610910031716s13578c1fic62e6cd84b85c6f3@mail.gmail.com>

locate searches for files/directories on the machine. It gives all matches and
does not work with a recursive listing from a given path like find. locate is
universal. find is local.

$ locate passwd
 /var/lib/dpkg/info/base-passwd.md5sums
/var/lib/dpkg/info/base-passwd.postinst
/var/lib/dpkg/info/base-passwd.prerm
/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.conffiles

I snipped out the output.

But beware!

su
# /usr/bin/updatedb&

Without the database having the latest entries locate cannot do its job.

But it is excellent when compared to find(if you leave out this defect that
it is not real time), since it finds in your entire machine.

Plus your nfs shares, samba shares and your local Windows mountpoints
if you keep
them mounted.

It is great.

-i ignores case.

I have never bothered to read the man page. But I know that locate is
married to updatedb. ;)

Wow. I am so glad that my firefox is able to show the Tamil text in
graphic detail both on the archive interface as well as quote it
correctly in this mail as well.

I am really glad. I installed the latha.ttf and configured firefox for it.

I hope you guys have all done it. But the kudos should go to
Google's efforts in localization and several other efforts in this
direction.

As to answering Kenneth's question I think he is right but the
difference is rather unimportant since many LUGGers do not live in
Chennai I think.

This in my opinion proves two things:
   a) ILUGC is superior to all other LUGS in India ;)

   b) The traditional Tamil respect for talent and outsiders

This is why we have Rajnikant and MGR making it big in Tamil Nadu.
We have close to zero xenophobia here. We are even better than
Americans in this regard as US has got very protectionist due to the
recent recession.

Vazha vaikum Tamizhagame vazhga!

By the way I did not grow up in Tamil Nadu though I am 100% Tamil.

Perhaps, and map/reduce querying might indeed have some other 
advantages, but you should not introduce complexity into an interface 
unless it's absolutely needed.

Maybe you could check GRASS[1] to see how much of the functionality

Many years ago, I was searching for a vector graphics web framework to
develop a web based fleet tracking application.When SVG was in its
infancy, I happened to see SVG being used for some of the above apps
in http://www.carto.net. I was amazed at what guys had done. That site
would lead you to more.

I've tried looking up the net time and again for pdf markup tools in
FOSS and sadly have seen none.There are closed free packages on
Windows like PDF-Xchange. The only way to do this in Linux is to
import the PDF file into GIMP/Scribus/OO and annotate. Sadly, these
are not PDF and annotations do not get saved as PDF markup elements
when exported.

The kind of annotations I'm talking of are typewriter inserts,
rectangles, oval, circles, lines, arrows, comments, link boxes etc.

Would some bright guys want to take this up under GSoC as extensions for Okular?

Sorry, but, I am starting to see this use of "equivalent FOSS tools"
in many new F/OSS mailing lists.

* F/OSS is not an alternative! It is a different system where people
are offered the source code, and that freedom is one of its most
important characteristics. Also refer:
http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm

* If you need specific functionality, check for existing F/OSS
software that may or may not have your requirement, but, avoid calling
them as "equivalents" to proprietary systems. It is perfectly fine to
say that if you want to do documentation, or presentations you can use
Openoffice.

* The moment people use the term 'alternative', they tend to compare
and contrast, without appreciating the fundamental beauty of
availability, and freedom to use the software.

It is like comparing a corrupt politician (who hides everything) and
an honest public servant (who gives you the sources).

I don't know about all these things so my suggestion may be a bit
off. I _have_ done PDF markup in two ways:

 1. Write text "on top of" the PDF file. One can do this with flpsed
 which is short for "fltk PostScript Editor".

 2. Fill up PDF forms by extracting the FDF data. One can do this
 with pdftk.

Kapil.

There are a number of alternatives. 

For "pure" text-mode joy of using vi try "elvis" which has a built-in
browser.

To get an a browser that is like vi in two senses (a) does only one
task --- web browsing (b) using vi-like "command mode" and insert
mode, try "uzbl" www.uzbl.org (pronounced usable I suppose!)

$ pyroom

It shows up a huge black window covering your entire display and a
pleasing green foreground.

Press Ctrl-H for help.

Ctrl-S for save and so on.

Good for one off editing sessions. Please try it.

I am covering a GUI utility for the first time. Tomorrow we shall see
xmessage(1), a GUI
utility to print messages.

Hey Manvendra,

You made my day!

I love vimperator. It has a certain irresistible appeal.

I can very quickly browse now. ;)

I switch tabs by pressing 'gt' just like in vim. ;)

Really cool.

Nice. But I still prefer my powerful editor. So, here's an addition to
the tip:

if you use Emacs, you can make it fullscreen (e.g. in KDE 4+, right
click on the title bar, choose Advanced->Fullscreen). Then, M-x
tool-bar-mode and M-x menu-bar-mode will clear stuff for you. Which
(regular) Emacs user uses the menu/tool bars anyway?

A similar effect can be achieved in gvim using:

:set guioptions-=m  "remove menu bar
:set guioptions-=T  "remove toolbar

HTH.

Message-ID: <7938ae610910041818ic8417d4wcc994c4368c1e5e2@mail.gmail.com>

Guys,

This is simply amazing. Try it and then see! ;)

Fire up vim and open a C file.

$ vim foo.c
:hardcopy %.ps

$ps2pdf14 foo.c.ps

$ xpdf foo.c.pdf

What do you see?

In case you don't have syntax highlighting enabled by default, you can
:sy on

before the :hardcopy step.

Here is a great sample:

http://gayatri-hitech.com/Misc/sqlex.c.pdf

Do you guys know any other way to create color PDF of syntax highlighted code?

I dunno any.

Enjoy!

I did not contest your claim. All I said is that using Emacs/Vim is
also possible.

Anyway, I understand, and thanks for emphasizing this.

It's interesting that the Pyroom website does not mention it is a

In most of these s/w, PDF needs to be converted as PS/ background
images and then edited. E.g GIMP brings them in as images. This is a
big issue when we have multi-page documents. If these were annotation
elements, then we can turn their visibility on and off, skip from one
to another while reviewing feedback given as annotations etc. Filling
up forms can be met by ftpsed or pdftk etc. as we do not need
extensive annotation capability. Comments and notes are the one used
most in reviewing. Arrows, box markers, highlights and link embedding
are use less but are important nevertheless.

As far as I've read, Okular does not have these features. It, however,
has the capability to read/render different formats. This makes it an
interesting platform for review/ annotation across multiple formats.

I did not know of Xournal and it does seem to explicitly support PDF
annotations. Need to check that out.

I had not dwelled much on PDFEdit earlier as it was described as a
library. Seeing it now, I see a GUI thingy. Need to explore this too.

Given all this, I still think it is a worthwhile project for some one
to take up on Okular.

Dear Rosh,

Very nice to know.

This reminds me of the fact that nothing is new.

Perhaps he got the idea from that. Perhaps not.

It is like K Balachander movies getting remade in Hindi.

People dunno which is original and which is fake.

Dear Giri,

You have a point.  Some might say that Bill Gates "invented the
personal computer, the graphical user interface, and the Internet."
Perhaps he did.  Perhaps not.

OO is giving enough hint to about the file in the error you have 
reported.  Most likely it is encrypted.  Request the sender to send it

Disciple to Lord Buddha: "I come to ask pardon for insulting you the other day."

Lord Buddha: "Which day? I don't remember."

Disciple: " It was only two days ago. I wonder."

Lord Buddha: "Oh I forgot. I am like the river that is constantly
flowing. What is past is
                      forgotten."

I think I got part of the story wrong. But you get the idea.

I gave a jQuery talk in Dec 2007 if my memory serves me right.

I chanced upon the slides just now. It might help the current LUG
crowd which may be
different from the crowd two years ago.

They used to but that would count as a trademark infringement. It is
better not to mention such things in a way that invites legal trouble.

When you click "Review" , you *should* be able to annotate the PDF. No?

To: Pune GNU/Linux Users Group Mailing List <plug-mail@plug.org.in>,



Dear all,

This is a formal announcement of Drupal Sprint India event happening
on October 30-31 2009. An event for those who love Drupal, geeks and
non-geeks alike.

Announcing Drupal Sprint India, a gathering of Drupal enthusiast from
all over India, to contribute to Drupal development.

The event is organized by Pune Linux Users Group with the support of
Bhaskaracharya Pratishthan as Venue Sponsors.

Drupal is probably the best community driven CMS in open source.
Community driven softwares need community contributions for regular
enhancements and this is your chance to contribute and gain karma.
Drupal sprint India is a two day non-stop event where Drupal
developers, documentation and translation guys will get together to
enhance Drupal. We will have code sprints, documentation sprints as
well as translation sprints.

Join coding sprints to fix patches for upcoming Drupal 7 release or to
port modules from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 or to develop new modules from
scratch.

Join Documentation sprint to document Drupal. Documentation sprint
will be headed by Addison Berry, Drupal documentation project lead.

Those interested in localization can join the party to translate
Drupal to local languages.

You need not have *any experience* with enhancing Drupal before hand,
even newbies are invited.

That is not all, we have more in store for you.

Got any Drupal success story to share or you have put Drupal to any
innovative use or any magnificent case study where you have integrated
Drupal with third party web services or web sites? This is the time to
showcase this. Parallel to sprint, we will hold talks and workshops to
showcase the capabilities of Drupal beyond CMS to build website. If
you have a story to showcase, register for the event right ahead.

Talks/Workshop registration ends October 15 2009. All talks and
registrations submitted will go through a community voting and top 10
talks plus workshops will be chosen for the event. We plan to hold
total of 8 hours of talks and 8 hours of workshops around Drupal over
two days.

Still interested in Drupal to use it in your next big venture... Just
drop in and learn from the best Drupal brains around the country on
how to put Drupal to best use.

So click ? http://drupalindia2009.plug.org.in ? now and register for the event.
The event is free, registration is free. ?All you have to make sure
that your code is also FREE.

So, what are you waiting for? Mark your calendar for the event dates!!

Message-ID: <200910060617.38774.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

I recently activated the tamil keyboard in FC11. Works fine in all applications 
under kde except the kmail composer. In kmail composer, tamil looks fine in the 
subject line, but in the body of the message, the characters are not joining. 
If I type ? + ?, I do not get ?? on the screen, but get the '?' symbol plus 
the '?' symbol - in sent mail and in the received mail it looks ok. Even if I 
do the entry in kwrite and copy/paste to the composer, the composer does not 
render it properly. This was not a problem in FC10, nor in mandriva on the 
same machine.

Hmm, it's tough to explain, but by native I mean a device that does

No h/w USB analyser, but will check out the kernel analyser when I get
a chance. I wasn't aware such a thing existed. Googling only pointed
me to a snoop analyser on Windows.

Seems so in one screenshot. Will check it out. However, when I went
thro' the FAQs, I got these.
Why the newly added annotations are not in my PDF document?
Short answer: Okular cannot change the annotations in PDF documents.

Longer answer: the library used for reading PDF documents (Poppler)
does not allow changing the annotations inside a PDF document. Also,
due to the fact that Okular allows you to annotate in any kind of
document it supports (even if that format does not support
annotations), Okular saves the annotations internally in the local
data directory for each user.

[Up to Questions]

How can I annotate a document and send it to a friend/collegue/etc?
Since KDE 4.2, Okular has the "document archiving" feature. This is an
Okular-specific format for carrying the document plus various metadata
related to it (currently only annotations).
You can save a "document archive" from the open document by choosing
"File -> Export As -> Document Archive".
To open an Okular document archive, just open it with Okular as it
would be eg a PDF document.

Earlier mail got sent prematurely due to some pudgy fingers. It is
important to have annotations as PDF elements for interoperability
with the larger universe of PDF viewer/editor platforms. Okular does
not seem to have this. Scribd also does something similar to what
Okular does for annotations. Maintains its own file formats and
separate files but can be saved as linked with the parent doc.

oops - for those who do not read tamil, this is a discussion on the proper 
translation of ILUGC. Apologies for not giving the english translation at the 
outset.

Recently I interacted with a person, who developed some application on
windoz using Opticon SDK. He said, if we want to directly interact
with device, then we need to get the command set from opticon.

And I heard that, some scanner will give the output in a encrypted
form!. I not sure about opticon, but plz check.

I felt that there must be some better word for group other than ???????. So,
when I saw the translations on the demo site for meetings, I felt ???????
would suffice for ???????. That is what motivated me to send the comments.
But if, as you say, that is not the case, is there not a better word for
group? ??????? sounds so colloquial. Also, i don't get why ????????? should
mean "act of meeting". Isn't it a noun?

it is - but it actually refers to when one or more persons 'bump into' each 
other. It does not refer to people sitting together in a meeting. The meeting 
of two rivers is ????????? for example.

Message-ID: <7f05469e0910052355q6c0a627n7cc8d2a2814361bb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am just practing the I2c driver development. surfed the net and read some
tutorials and most of them refered i2c.h header file for i2c driver
development.

But i came to know, there is another method for developing the i2c driver
using i2c-algo-bit.h header file.

Can some one help to understand the difference in the I2c driver
using i2c.h & i2c-algo-bit.h?
and detailed functionalities of each?

Advanced thanks.

Your question is too hard for me.

How do you develop using a header file?

What is it that you mean? Can you phrase your question better?

What do you want to do with i2c bus?

You want to develop a driver for what? TV card?

Looks like, if some online dictionaries are anything to go by, ???? seems to
be a better alternative for group than ???????.

Message-ID: <7f05469e0910060158q15e25d2eyaf4b279cf52278d7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Girish,

I am develping i2c driver for temperature sensor.
I guess two methods of available for driver development.
legacy method using i2c.h header file & using the legacy functuions like
i2c_detect(adapter, &addr_data, detect),i2c_smbus_read_byte_data(client, reg)
et.
another method is bitwise operations which internally uses the legacy
method  using i2c-algo-bit.h header file & using the functions like
setscl,getscl,setsda,getsda.

I just want to understand the difference of these two, and require some
guidelines for develope the driver.

thanks
suresh

Your question is too hard for me.

How do you develop using a header file?

What is it that you mean? Can you phrase your question better?

What do you want to do with i2c bus?

You want to develop a driver for what? TV card?

Yeah true! Just checked out by trying to Annotate in Okular and
opening in Adobe Reader. Didnt work. But Annotating PDF in Xournal
works (which I use most times if needed)

Check that out.

Subject: Petition to Cancel Proprietary Tender by NIC given to CJI and DG NIC

For Publication

Eminent personalities including Justice V R Krisha Iyer (former Supreme
court judge) and Dr. Pushpa M Bhargava (former Vice Chairman National
Knowledge Commission) have called upon the National Informatics Centre
(NIC) to cancel its tender (Ref. No: NIC/TPS/2009/18) form purchase of
laptops with preloaded software for the Supreme Court of India.

They were part of those who have signed an online petition, which was
launched on 24-09-09, opposing this proprietary tender. Justice V R
Krisha Iyer in his comment termed this tender reactionary and has
pleaded with the Prime Minister to intervene in the name of access to
Freedom of Information and Free and Open Source Software. Sixteen
organisations (http://www.swecha.org/wiki/index.php?title=Petition) and
370 individuals (http://swecha.org/node/23/signatures) have signed the
petition.

The petition has also been sent to the Hon?ble Chief Justice of India
Shri K G Balakrishnan and the Direcetor General of NIC Dr. B K Gairola.
There is confirmation from the respective offices that the petition has
been received.

The tender relates to purchase of proprietary brands of laptops (Apple
laptops) and the software installed (Windows XP) in it. Any fair
tendering practice should allow competition and only give system
specifications. In this tender, the only brand name given is Apple and
only operating system given is Windows XP from Microsoft. This makes the
tender a single source tender and is clearly anti-competitive since
there is wide choice of hardware, software and operating systems in the
market. Therefore, this is not a single vendor situation and no
exception should be considered on this count.

Moreover, the above mentioned tender is for laptops to be used by the
Supreme Court of India. As the supreme judicial body of the country, the
Court must set a proper precedent and not allow such unfair tendering
practice.

The tender also goes against stated government policy of encouraging
free and open source softeware, and open standards. The National
Knowledge Commission in its report on e-governance submitted to the
Prime Minister stated, ?Because of the enormous size and scope of the
E-governance effort in India and because of the availability of globally
recognized software talent of Indians,we must actively encourage open
source software implementations and open standards wherever possible.?

The Department of Information Technology, in its Elevent Five Year Plan
(2007-2012) has remarked that, ?If computer adoption has to reach from
current 1% of population to say 5% in next five years, we have to
seriously pursue some other route, viz., that of Free/Open Source
Software (FOSS).?

The current tender?s preference for proprietary suppliers will encourage
vendor lock-in as their data and files can be read by only their
software. Such a step by the Supreme Court would set the clock back in
the country, where increasingly Government organisations and others are
turning to Free and Open Source Software. In this context, it might be
noted that Allahabad High Court has already successfully converted to
FOSS and Open Standards (http://www.allahabadhighcourt.in/faq.htm)

Institutions like NIC under the Ministry of Information and Technology
have to ensure the adoption of software that complies with open
standards. It was therefore demanded that the current tender should be
scrapped forthwith and a new tendering process be initiated without
naming any brands and incorporating Free and Open Source Software.

This is the first time I am covering a BSD command.

# dump 0f rootfs.bin /dev/rwd0a

# restore rf rootfs.bin

dump dumps the contents of the /dev/wd0a partition(root partition)
into the file rootfs.bin

restore should be exected from the partition like above and it will
copy all files into the
freshly created partition.

Before restore, you have to create a partition and format it with newfs(8).

This is a BSD command. I think there is a download for linux also.

dump and restore deal only with actualy files and not with unallocated
space like dd.

I use it a lot and find it very nice.

Well, sometime back(1 or 2 years) MS was advertising Windows Server
using LSE as a case study for TCO and enterprise scalability. Now life
has indeed come full circle for LSE. This is a shot in the arm for
*NIX indeed. And all the crap in the MS ads are unravelling their true
colours now.

Makes sense.

I was hoping that wouldn't be necessary :(

Update: Opticon tech. support has been responsive on this, much to my 
surprise :)

Looks like I'm stuck with a Windows machine for much longer than I'd
hoped would be the case.

Update: They've reused the Symbol CS1504 protocol. The only (!) problem 
now is that the Opticon device doesn't respond, which is a driver issue, 
acc. to the Opticon support guy. There also seem to be some ongoing 
issues with USB serial code, from this Linux kernel thread:

$ 7z a foo.izo

creates a foo.7z which in my case is mostly 6 times smaller or roughly
600% efficient.

$ 7z e foo.7z

decompresses it.

Also known as p7zip it is fantastic. No comparison with bzip2 or gzip.
Of course bzip2 never
enjoyed much patronage anyway.

You also have zip and compress in UNIX by the way.

One more tip. Think of this as a "tiplet" like booklet.

$ ldd `which bash`

will give you the shared libraries bash is linked against.

You surely want to do

$ ldd `which convert`

If a library is found missing you can be sure that executable is not
going to work.

You also know what to do to copy executables from one machine to another.

By the way ` is backquote on the top left corner of your keyboard.

I promise not to give 2 tips like this any other day.

But this 7z is surely something worth trying. It is amazing and I
really wonder when it will
become widespread and get built into gzip executable... or tar

Basically, never. It doesn't make sense for gzip (which implements a
different compression algorithm) to implement XZ compression. Tar is a
archive format and not a compression format.  Some more information at

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/XZRpmPayloads

In particular, XZ with compression 2 (as opposed to the default of 6)
provides the best performance/compression ratio.

It goes beyond just adoption of Linux. As I understand it, LSE bought out
MilleniumIT. This shows a stronger commitment than just a licence purchase.
This may have well been a strategy to mitigate risk of support/ closure etc.
Be it as it were, this is still as a great win story for Linux.

hi,

all these years of using kmail, I just select the text I want to reply to and 
press on 'reply'. The text is quoted in the reply. 10 minutes ago this stopped 
working. Any clues on how to get it to work?

I forgot to mention that you can see for yourself how great it is:

My raw ISO image is roughly 650 MB but thro' different version of
SpamCheetah I have never
had a p7 image more than 110 MB.

http://spam-cheetah.com/download.html

See for yourself. Test it and find out.

gz produces more than double the size of 7z. So you can say that gz
achieves 300% compression
and 7z more than double that.

Of course I await the day when tar(BSD and GNU) embraces this great technology.

We shall take  a dekko at some mp3 related stuff tomorrow.

Does it have to? A few people I know over IRC still do a
gunzip foo.tar.gz | tar -xvf or
bunzip2 foo.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf

I am a relatively modern linux user (circa 2002) and I use
tar -xzvf *.tar.gz or tar -xjvf *.tar.bz2

I do not think the fact that tar did not have a x or j flag back then
hurt.

Also, some distro uses 7zip as one of its package compression options.
I think I
saw gentoo using it for its portage snapshot but I am not sure. Also an age old
distro like slackware included it in Slack13 (LFY this month)

Well, in the past few years, you don't really have to specify x or j or
anything like that. Tar automatically detects whether you are extracting
a gzip, bzip2 or xz compressed archive and call the appropriate tool
automatically. All you have to do is

tar xvf foo.<tar.gz/tar.bz2/tar.lzma/xz>

	editing)
Message-ID: <7938ae610910082119w5ea3df1bja655bc83b43af65f@mail.gmail.com>

mp3info prints mp3 related information of mp3 audio files.

$ mp3info foo.mp3
foo.mp3 does not have ID3 1.x tag

It doesn't print anything since some mp3 files do not have
id3 tags.

$ mp3info -p "playtime : %m%s  Bitrate:%r\n" foo.mp3
playtime : 718  Bitrate:64

$ mp3info -p "%m\n" foo.mp3
7

The above 718 means 7:18 mins which is 7 minutes and 18 seconds.

Here are some more options you can use with -p switch.

(Self-promotion alert)

Something I wrote, rather quickly, to scratch my own itch was
"taggrepper", to grep tags of MP3s, Ogg Vorbis and FLAC audio in my
collection. As the name suggests, it can be used to grep the tags for
certain patterns, with regular expressions. I figured some might have
use for it, so you can check it out here:

HTH, and thanks for the tips, Girish.

Oh well. I did not know that :)
But I feel that this is not a feature. It is more like featuritis. Shouldn't
each tool be independant of another. I might use my own gunzip
implementation. :(

This is one of those "moments" when I feel that GNU/Linux is trying too
hard to do the Windows idea of "One tool does it all" compared to
the more elegant "One tool does one thing and does it well" philosophy
of UNIX.

The original cat just concatenated files. Printing one file to stdout was
something more like an exception handler.

Now, cat prints $ at the end of lines with the -e. Worse still. -e == -vE.
-s squeezes out empty lines -t and -T are related to viewing tabs.
-u is ignored. -v shows non printing characters. -A == -vET
-b numbers non-blank lines and -n numbers all lines. None of these
seem to have anything to do with concatenation. Most of this work must
be done by awk(line numbering, removing blank lines etc).

Yes, you can. Before ranting, read up on how it is implemented.

Nice :-)


I've just deployed Fire Fly Media server and clients on my media
collection:

    http://www.fireflymediaserver.org
    http://fireflyclient.sourceforge.net

There's also a flash version called FirePlay -- your media collection
can be accessed through a youtube like web interface.

IIRC Firefox 3.5 supports Ogg natively, so embedding the media link
inside a html5 video tag should solve it.  Or am I missing something?


Btw, FireFly can transcode Ogg/etc media real time to wav for
end point devices which do not support these open formats.

I meant, in FirePlay, the app could use HTML 5 Video and fall back to
flash.

Message-ID: <4ACF317A.4070003@collab.net>

Hi Team,

Have an issue integrating Cisco meeting manager (webex) to Firefox.

Getting a setup error while trying to listen to a webex session.
Checked whether i can manually install the meeting manager plugin but 
cisco site
doesn't have an installable for linux they say it will be automatically 
installed when u browse the
session URL. I doubt whether any security rule to be disabled but not 
sure how to make it.

Note: Also tried in Google Chrome notice the same scenario - setup error

FireFox version used 3.5 Linux distro - Ubuntu 9.04

Please let me know your inputs.

Thanks
Sattish.

$mc

is a GUI Tool but an ASCII GUI.

It has its underpinnings in the MS DOS world and it has a distinct
turquoise and a very appealing colorscheme
with blue and red.

It is a fantastic file manager and I have hardly ever used it. Perhaps
you guys should help me out?

Please try it and educate us if any of you are mc fanatics.

It is short for 'midnight commander'. On the main menu at the bottom
all the items are meant to mean
that F1 to F10 family of keys on the topmost row of your keyboard.

Hope that helps. Have fun. It is incredibly powerful and very stable.

What was the price and source? Can you also let us know how long the battery

17500 - all dealers seem to be able to get it - but the one recommended by

Dear All,

I tried to download and install openoffice.org softwares for my RHEL 5. I
tried to install the rpm packages in the folder :
OOO310_m19_native_packed-1_en-US.9420 . I tried to install all the ooo* ,
openoffice* openoffice.org-userland-1.0-0.noarch and
openoffice.org3.1-redhat-menus-3.1-9420.noarch rpms : But after running the
setup program I got this error :

rpm --upgrade --ignoresize -vh

fixing the bug.

A set of combos that I use frequently

1)The F2 brings up a set of actions that can be done. @ allows
us to enter a custom command with which we run the file. The
It also allows us to compress folders and files.

2)Tab allows movement between the two frames

3) Left and right menus have a Tree listing option (Remember tree?)
The trees fold and expand too. And yeah. You just type F9 Down T

4) In the options menu, press enter on Configuration
Enabling Lynx like motion really speeds up your browsing speed.

5) I also have safe delete enabled.

6) The Left menu is for the left pane and Right is for the right menu
You can use Filter for filtering out specific patterns.

It is a great tool for web development. I have used it several times
to validate my javascript code.

But javascript is such a complex programming language that advanced
concepts like closures
have always stumped me. I still don't understand them. And
spidermonkey cannot help
with such things I think.

For that we have firebug, a Netscape plugin which is the greatest
friend for any web developer.

We will look at that tomorrow.

Did you add the repos through Yast or hand edit?  

Through Yast, the proper hostname and the repo tree therein is 
automatically added when you select the OSS or the non-OSS repos.

e.g. the OSS repo looks like this:
URL: http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.1/repo/oss/

NB:  download.opensuse.org redirects to a repo that is closest to your 
geo ip.  It could be that the "mapped" server you got was busy or it 
the mirror is broken.

Alternately, you can program to a specific repo, these are always 
updated and fast.
http://mirrors.kernel.org/opensuse/distribution/11.1/repo/
http://mirror.anl.gov/pub/opensuse/opensuse/distribution/11.1/repo

(assuming you are using 11.1)

in order to translate from english to tamil, one must understand english. None 
of the above reflect the english meaning - the english phrase has an element of 
irony and an element of subtlety, which is difficult to reflect in Tamil. I still 
feel my translation is the best reflection.

$ geoiplookup  74.6.22.167
GeoIP Country Edition: US, United States

You can install the package either using the Python tool or Perl tool.
In Debian it is called
geoip-lookup.

# apt-cache search geoip

Or just google for GeoIP.

It is useful to find out where your hits are landing on your website
since you can lookup
originating IP addresses from the Apache log.

You can also print this information(originating IP ) from a CGI script.

After you get the IP you can lookup the location using geoip.

Once you collate the information you can draw a Pie Chart and display
to the user
using Chart::Pie CPAN module.

Subject: [Ilugc] DNS records and MX querying CGI
Message-ID: <7938ae610910120251l601854f6x8de34bc300fb0ae0@mail.gmail.com>

Guys,

I have written a CGI script to figure out the IP address associated
with a domain.

It will also print multiple IP addresses associated with a domain.

Additionally what the script can do is print all the MX records(for
e-mail sending) with
their associated weights and IP addresses.

Take a look yourself:

http://spam-cheetah.com/dns.html

Of course you can download the CGI script and view the syntax
highlighted version
either here:

http://www.spam-cheetah.com/bgquery.html

Or you could go there from the query page.

Hope this is useful. In case you are curious you can read about DNS
from RFC1035.txt
which you can obtain like this:

$ wget ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt

And you can

# perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::DNS;'

and

$ man Net::DNS

I developed this code from the examples given in the man page.

Subject: [Ilugc] Help With OpenVPN
Message-ID: <d1d01b990910120722q75a5ba2eoa85857aba4821eef@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am in need of help with OpenVPN here. This is the situation:

I have the VPN server running successfully on 192.168.1.1 and the
clients are connected to it (192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3).

Computer 1
-----------------
      eth0 - 192.168.1.1/24     (This is the VPN server)
      tap0 - 10.222.222.1

Computer 2
-----------------
      eth0 - 192.168.1.2/24
      eth1 - 10.1.2.1/24          (internal network is 10.1.2.0/24,
and this is the gateway)
      tap0 - 10.222.222.2

Computer 3
-----------------
      eth0 - 192.168.1.3/24
      eth1 - 10.1.3.1/24          (internal network is 10.1.3.0/24,
and this is the gateway)
      tap0 - 10.222.222.3


I have enabled forwarding from tap0 to eth1 and vice-versa using
iptables on the two gateways and added this command in the VPN server
configuration file:
      push "route 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0"

This adds a routing entry in each client when they are connected:
      route add -net 10.1.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 10.222.222.1

On the VPN server, i have added the following routes:
     1) route add -net 10.1.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.1.2.1
     2) route add -net 10.1.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.1.3.1

By doing so, i am successfully able to ping from 10.1.2.x to 10.1.3.x.

My problem is that all the packets go to the VPN server and then it is
forwarded to the gateways. I feel this will result in too much load on
the VPN server as it keeps running and in burst traffic situations
(and might crash). Am i wrong in this assumption?

Is there a better way to do the routing, that is can I push the
routing entries 1) and 2) automatically from the VPN server onto the
clients whenever they connect so that traffic does not have to come
through the VPN server, it can go directly to the gateway?

If so, what is the command I have to specify in the VPN configuration file?

Also, I need to log traffic and detect burst traffic. I know this is
possible using iptables, and have tried it out. But, is there a way
where I can specify in the VPN server configuration file to
automatically push commands onto the client to prevent burst traffic
(DOS attacks typically)?

I must prevent computers from one subnet from DOSing the VPN server,
or the other subnets, or any computer in the VPN. How do I do this?

What is the difference between "dev tun" and "dev tap" in the VPN
configuration files? I know it specifies the tunneling device, but why
two separate devices? In what situations do I use each device?

I have also noticed this, in my VPN server configuration file, I have the line:
        server 10.222.222.0 255.255.255.0
If I specify "dev tun" in both server and clients, the server starts
giving out ip's to clients from 10.222.222.5, but if I specify "dev
tap" in both server and clients, the server starts giving out ip's to
clients from 10.222.222.2. Why is it so?

What if I enable forwarding using iptables from eth0 to eth1 in the
gateways? Will routing from 10.1.2.x to 10.1.3.x work even then? If
not, why?

I know there are too many questions to be answered :), but it would be
really helpful if I could get some answers.

If all the computers are on a common ethernet segment why are you
running a VPN between these machines in addition to the ethernet?
(If you want to encrypt data by default you are better of switching
all machines to IPSec.)

Note that tun devices are preferred to tap devices.

Again your requirement is not very clear from your description. If
your VPN is meant to encrypt traffic then the traffic must pass
through the VPN server which behaves like the hub of a star network.

In VPN parlance, what you are asking for is a full mesh VPN
topology where any VPN site/network can communicate
to any other site/network in the mesh directly.  Most commercial
firewalls Cisco/Check Point/Juniper support this topology.

OpenVPN however only does star -- central VPN server with all
clients communicating to the server only.  There is no direct
communication between clients.  If you want to do this, run a
VPN server and client at each site and establish multiple tunnels.

For just 3 sites, it's pretty easy, but scaling it to large number of
sites is difficult with OpenVPN -- management and dynamic routing
will become increasingly difficult unless you script/automate.

It takes a lot of traffic to overwhelm any OpenVPN server, my WRT54GL
wireless modem at home runs tomato + openvpn firmware and handles
1Mb/s DSL with ease.  I typically run 2-3 tunnels, and the hardware is
a 233MHz ARM with 16MB RAM.  Any typical desktop today will handle
most OpenVPN workloads easily.

If you have a commercial firewall then you can just use it to filter VPN
traffic before it enters your network.  You can set the DOS limiters on
the firewall.  Otherwise, iptables is your friend.

TUN is a Layer 2 device and which can carry any protocol over ethernet
frames.  TAP is a Layer 3 device used for IP protocols only.

Use TUN if you want to Ethernet bridging with OpenVPN. I use TUN
on my home VPN server to connect it to from remote networks. Use
TAP if you don't want Ethernet bridging and want to routed networks
instead.  OpenVPN Howto and Wikipedia have good documentation
on this point.

Bridging vs routing topology.  This question has been asked several
times on OpenVPN mailing lists.  No point repeating the answers here.

Will not work unless you implement a meshed VPN, or at least
simulate one with multiple OpenVPN tunnels.

Whoops!  It's supposed to be the other way around.

The network seems to be a lab network or something for you to try out VPNs.
One cannot talk of crashes without knowing where the bottleneck is. With a
PIII processor, 100Mb traffic can be handled with 1500 packet sizes. I guess
that is the ethernet card speed here and so processor will not be the
bottleneck.

Yes. Obviously all the machines are on one 192... network. Like Kapil asked,
there must be an intent for a VPN. Normally, VPNs are built over public
networks between remote locations. You can build a star or a mesh networks.
Obviously, a mesh will not suffer from a single point getting excessively
loaded as in a star.

*First task is to search. A google search yields "TAP (as in network tap)
simulates an Ethernet device and it operates with layer 2 packets such
as Ethernet frames. TUN (as in network TUNnel) simulates a network
layer device and it operates with layer 3 packets such as
IP<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol> packets.
TAP is used to create a network bridge, while TUN is used with routing."*

Thanks to Raja for figuring out that "mesh" toplogy is what
Hrishikesh wants.

As Raja has said OpenVPN only supports star structure (i.e. all
traffic goes through the VPN server) or point-to-point.

You can create a OpenVPN mesh network you need to to do a lot of
scripting to create many point-to-point networks and routing
tables will be long.

If the VPN structure is being used for encryption only and not for
tunneling, then a better alternative is to use IPSec or IPv6.

Kapil.

Hi,
Thanks for the replies everyone.

If all the computers are on a common ethernet segment why are you

I want to test out the VPN server on the LAN first before deploying it on

Install firebug

using the Mozilla adds on page or go here:

http://getfirebug.com

Then you get a cockroach image on the bottom pane of the browser.

Use

console.print() in your js code to inspect.

Firebug is very very very powerful. ;)

It can tell you the missing files/images in your web page.

It can tell you the CSS that corresponds to various <divs>s on your page.

It is a GUI tool, so I can't say much here.

I had mentioned that I will cover firebug "tomorrow".

Today is that tomorrow.

be found in the apache access logs and not in the error logs. As for other

Dear KG,

If you nurse somewhat "negative" views in your heart,
 it is best that you not out them thereby discouraging
would be learners.

People who have never heard about firebug before will
get a chance to look at it. That is the purpose of my tip.

But after reading your post, they may feel that it was
not worth their while to take a look.

By the way your argument is wrong too.

I shall explain.

Apache logs only tell you traffic stats and referrers and
of course 404 errors and web server problems. Problems
with configuring Apache.

But firebug is a javascript development and CSS development
tool.

Have you done serious web development with javascript?

It can be really painful since it is as rich a language as C
in certain ways.

You most definitely need a friend like firebug.

And I never said that you should use firebug after you have
the code in production. You debug it whilst developing.

Even spidermonkey which I sent few days ago does not
simulate the complete browser environment.

Anyway it is not my nature to argue. I shall not
 reply to this thread anymore.

Have a nice day. Happy firebugging! ;)

I am very good at bugging people, not sure about this.

-Girish

Firebug is a fabulous tool , guess its been misunderstood , using
firebug to correct path problems is not the idea . You can change css
attributes dynamically and see them updated , time to load individual
files . Now there are pluggins developed on the top of firebug . If
you are a jquery user firebug is invaluable .
Stuff like firepython / firephp have added support for python / php
debugging using firebug .

What apache logs can fetch is useless while developing css for a website .

Another use case: Using firebug you can modify javascript of a web
page page on-the-fly. I have seen many pages breaking due to simple
javascript mistakes. Using firebug you can fix many of them to make it
work with firefox.

I think it would be wiser to get a laptop with good configuration, then
install any GNU/Linux distro on them. That way you would have a wider range
to choose from :)

What do you exactly mean by this? Are you getting a pound/ euro sign
instead of a dollor? Make sure that you use a Generic 101/104 keyboard
layout (US). Check your Locale settings as well. If you had set it to
en_GB, you might start getting Pound symbols.

but all these libraries are almost >500kb size. since i wanted to distribute

can it be achieved with CURL? has any one tried?

I totally agree with this. I have been using it, with my team for
quite some time. It has saved me a lot of trouble.

Apache server logs can give only 404 errors. And if you are saying
that it is more than enough to find out why your page isn't showing up
correctly or not, is just because of 404 errors, it clearly shows that
you were, more often than not, using only off the shelf JS and CSS.
This is not the case for most of the applications "others" do. We do
develop custom JS and CSS for our own applications. 404 is rarely a
case in these situations.

What it can do for you is something like gdb/ Turbo C debugger for JS
and CSS (if you have ever used anything of that sort).

As mentioned above, firebug is not a tool to install and check off the
shelf JS and CSS, but for building custom JS. Quite complicated ones,
Complete Rich UI for example. Infact, even for checking off the shelf
products, its easier to see the graph at the bottom of firefox than to
open appache log files and grep for 404 errors and run through pages
of it.

Out of my 8 years exp in web-programming, most serious and difficult

JS and CSS programmers need it. If you are using off the shelf
products, it is still useful, you never gave it a try.

How did you develop a personal point of view without doing any serious
javascript development?

If your apps are no more complicated than a 'hello world' app (only
difference being 'hello world' being replaced by lot of text), you can get
away with scanning apache logs and fixing those 'wrong path' problems. OTH,
if 'behavior' on the browser side is involved (read js), firebug is
indispensable.

Apart from the other features others mentioned, the profiler is another
super tool in Firebug.

Acer also has a few medium to high end models that come without Windows. I
have a travelmate 6292 - Core 2 Duo, 2.2GHZ, 4MB L2 (I think it currently
costs around 35K). The only problem is... its HOT. Literally.

It was last evening I was in Tata Croma Anna nagar. When I check with the
sales person who stands in the Laptop section for the Linux based notebooks.
I am pretty surprised to learn from him that the Corma had a  policy to buy
only windows based notebooks.

WHen I bought it, I too noticed some hesitancy in the salesman when I asked
for non-windows models. But after I assured him that I will do the
installation myself he was back to normal :-) So, I think its the service
personnel's lack of skill in linux that makes them push windows - so the
customer will not come back to them when there is a problem.

I did not buy it in Tata Croma. I bought it in a shop in Phase 1 of
spencers, near KFC. I forget the name. They also have a branch at Shanthi
Colony at anna nagar.

 NUSOAP, is pretty old library which we used, PHP4.x, Now you can go with
PEAR:SOAP.

Yes it can be done.
http://pastebin.com/me9ee7b2, have a look at the sample code in  the paste
bin. Where they used CURL to send the SOAP elements. The missing point in
the code is the attachment, that we need to check it.

All,

I read an article about the Empathy in the LFY issue of this month, The
Empathy supports  the voice chat and the desktop sharing [1]. This is first
time I used gtalk voice chat service from the Linux box. In the same article
they convey  Empathy is still in the earlier stage to get stable. To know
about empathy [2].



[1]  I has not tested  the desktop sharing yet. That to when you use gtalk
this service is not available

Two options:

1. Upgrade to the next ubuntu jaunty release and install mysql-5.1.  This
will give you 5.1.30 (or there abouts) and many other new packages.

2. Grab the source 5.1 package from jaunty or the web and compile it
on your ubuntu hardy box.


You can search the entire package repository at packages.ubuntu.com.

That's cool, but nowadays, days turn to hours with Windows :) Not
every hour, every few hours, after installing software, after eating,
after tea, after whatever you do that isn't palatable to Microsoft.
Using Linux for 4 years has saved me from premature high tension!

Acer Aspire 5738 is seriously good. A review with *nix.

It now runs Archlinux. Sadly, you aren't going to be able to run
OpenSolaris and FreeBSD on it with X. The intel graphics card isn't
supported.

Message-ID: <47d9fe5c0910130618v1e669197y6ad7062a5bcde7f4@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have been using a Samsung R418 notebook for a month or so, but one
thing that beats me is configuring the brightness of the LED display.
The keys are Function+up/down arrows, but it doesn't invoke the
Brighness applet on any distro. The volume applet works fine with
Function+right/left keys. Can anybody help me out?

P.S. The keys work on LCD, only not on my LED.

Salva

(Not the direct answer).

You can use SCIM in KDE for tamil input. Unfortunately, the key board
layouts are not usable.

I use
a. tamil-gtk2im in gedit (need to install gnome).
b. tamilkey in firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2994)

Hope this helps.

What better way to start the day than take a look at my beautiful girlfriend?

http://gayatri-hitech.com/Misc/sreshta-navrathri/sreshta.JPG

The observant one will notice 2 things.

1) her name is Sreshta

2) the photograph has a 3D relief

Actually this is from a web page that I recently created and some
people did not
notice the 3D effect on the photograph done with

$ convert -raise 15x15 input.jpg output.jpg

You can create a frame with

$ convert -mattecolor peru -frame 15x15+3+3 input.jpg out.png

Write a script on all your images and publish online. ;)

btw, convert may not come in your box by default - if it is not there, you 
need to install imagemagick.

There are a lot of open source library management system available these
days but when it comes to the php based library management system the option
are really few and that to also not that much feature-full that might you
expect .

phpmylib  (Acquisition module doubtful)
PMB ( http://sigb.net/index.php?page=secteurs&id_rubrique=2&lang=en ) Hard
to use .

Non php based available solution :

Koha (Plz, check whether it accept INR or not but else it is th best till
date)
NewGenLib (It is by an Indian Company but its license is tricky )

Why would you consider GPLv3 a tricky license?

I don't think it is a tricky license but their previous implication that has
now been deleted (NOT of GPL 3 but of Versus System ) is that for books >
50000 they will charge 5000/- INR for software and for more then 2 user (

Please correct me if I am wrong as I am unable to retrace that link again
where they have given those restriction on books and users.

I have no idea. I just checked their license and it says clearly GPLv3
and they are not using any exceptions.

Hardly the first time a stock exchange is using Linux however. A large
majority of the stock exchanges these days are already running Linux.
Look it up.

Yeah, but LSE and NASDAQ are the biggies, if they move to Linux, that
would be real dominance. Now, if only NASDAQ had the shrewdness to
switch over, it'd be curtains for that big proprietary software
vendor.

"Biggies"?  Let's look at the list of largest stock changes.

NYSE is right at the top. Guess what it is running?

Dear respected Gaurav,

Please use firebug for tracking your website performance and do things like

1) use mod_gzip with Apache

2) Don't pack your js files, instead minify them using jsmin or whatever and
   concatenate them.

3) Use firebug and whatever tool you have to identify bottlenecks
     and minimize the page load time

4) Do good CSS hackery and reduce the images on your site

 5) Make your HTML, CSS and js code w3c standards compliant

I repeat.

Firebug is king.

It will be great if people avoided using Sir, Respected and Mr in ILUGC. ;)

Name is enough.

-Girish

Am not sure it'll keep running after you logout! The 'nohup' command should
help.

you could also use nohup
nohup python myserver.py &

However if its a server process, I would rather suggest  supervisor

Running in the screen is the safest and reliable way to keep running a
script after we logout. Steps are:

(i) type "screen" -- this will create a new screen and you'll be inside the
screen.
(ii) python myserver.py (while you're inside the screen)
(iii) Ctrl + A + d -- will take you out of the screen -detaches screen (but
the screen keeps running and also your script)
(iv) Now, you can logout of the server. Once you return, or anytime you need
to "view" the python process running, you need to RESUME the screen that is
detatched. You can do this by issuing : screen -ls (will list out all the
running screen's PID)
                  screen -x #PID of screen to resume


Note: You can do lot more than just running a single process in the screen.
"man screen" can explore those.

If you run a server you should daemonize it. What is necessary is to
make it the
session group leader of a different session. setsid() is also found in shells.

If you want to run a command at a particular time once,  you have the
at(1) command.

For servers, the preferred way is to daemonize either using perl or C.
Since you are a
python enthusiast I hope there is a way to do it in python as well.

I am too ignorant to know.

It is not humanly possible to know everything. I am flabbergasted at the
ignorance of people about adenine, guanine, cytosine and thiamine.

Not true. The entire state of Maharashtra contributes less than 10% to the
GDP.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_India_by_size_of_economy

*Lot of this data has been provided by NFHS. The National Family Health
Survey (NFHS) is a large-scale, multi-round survey conducted in a
representative sample of households throughout **India. Three rounds of the
survey have been conducted since the first survey in 1992-93. The survey
provides state and national information for India on fertility, infant and
child mortality, the practice of family planning, maternal and child health,
reproductive health, nutrition, anaemia, utilization and quality of health
and family planning services. **Each successive round of the NFHS has had
two specific goals: a) to provide essential data on health and family
welfare needed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and other
agencies for policy and programme purposes, and b) to provide information on
important emerging health and family welfare issues. *

uniq is very useful to know the unique IP addresses that visit your website.

Typically when users download SpamCheetah.iso they download around 7
files and they look at a whole
bunch of stuff in the website.

But when it comes to business/sales, I am only interested in knowing
how many different individuals download
my software.

For that even if we consider NAT, so far I have not had the same IP
downloading twice anytime.

So assume that your company has 300 employees and one NAT public IP,
then I will see only one unique IP even
when a 100 people download my software.

But this is not the way website statistics work. We often think that
people come from different geographies and that
is mostly correct.

Anyway now coming back to the tip, this is the line I use

$ grep -h .iso access.log*|cut -d' ' -f1|uniq
65.55.105.141
74.6.18.246
65.55.105.138
65.55.105.146
66.249.68.136
77.251.255.144
66.249.68.136
80.57.9.214
95.16.116.224
65.168.58.2
80.57.190.3
74.6.18.246
114.127.246.34
74.6.18.246
72.30.142.162
88.11.40.44
74.204.0.4
72.30.142.162
93.128.134.88
72.30.142.162
65.55.105.141
67.195.110.190
80.57.9.214
95.16.116.224
65.168.58.2
80.57.190.3
74.6.18.246
114.127.246.34
74.6.18.246

You can run geoiplookup on them in a shell script to figure out the
countrywide distribution.

This is the number of downloads in the present week which is not yet over.

$ grep -h .iso access.log*|cut -d' ' -f1|uniq|wc -l
      29

Too bad. I have to work on getting more downloads.

Anyway man uniq also shows these flags:
    -c, --count
              prefix lines by the number of occurrences

       -d, --repeated
              only print duplicate lines

       -D, --all-repeated[=delimit-method]
              print all duplicate lines
delimit-method={none(default),prepend,separate} Delimiting
              is done with blank lines.

       -f, --skip-fields=N
              avoid comparing the first N fields

       -i, --ignore-case
              ignore differences in case when comparing

_successive_ as it says above ... hence uniq(1) is often used with sort(1).

We should actually be spreading the word 'FOSS'. Ubuntu
is one of the various alternatives. People have of late started
equating Ubuntu to linux as many equate Linux to GNU/Linux

Rosh,

How right you are?

Cool.

I must remember to use sort with it. In my case it is not very
relevant since my
site is not so busy that I get multiple downloaders at the same time.
Then I would
have naturally arrived at sort.

But this is an old UNIX idiom that left my attention.

I shall cover sort separately in another tip.

Now that I am about it, I will mention two things.

           a) sort -nr is frequently used. $ du -hsc | sort -nr
                descending sort of file/dir sizes. IOW sort
numericlaly(-n) sorts
                in desending(reverse order -r) order

           b) sort's notion of "sorting" may not agree with yours. So
you have to
                either use cut to sort a specific field numerically or
rarely alphabetically...

Oops. I surely meant 'countrywise' and not 'countrywide'.

Also long ago I meant 'Firefox add ons' and not what I wrote.;)

I meant sort and uniq are used together often in general, not with
your specific case in mind.


IIRC, another idiom was,

... | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | ...

Actually ' sort | uniq ' is so common that there is ' sort -u '

This isn't the first time, that has happened either. Customers get
significant benefits if they agree to become part of any such studies.
Some of them migrate to Linux partially and won't tell that publicly
because they would lose the benefits that the other vendor offers them.
 Others dont want to because it might invite legal trouble such as the
competition sending threatening letters about unspecific patents. Some
other customers don't want to because they consider their use of Linux
as a competitive advantage and don't want others in the industry to know
about it and adopt a similar strategy.

If you are curious, it is easy enough to search specific names in such
campaigns in your favourite search engine and to know the real facts.

Or you could just use daemonize:

http://www.clapper.org/software/daemonize/daemonize.1.html

The package for you fav. disto might be available

Besides the other suggestions, if you want to measure the performance of your 
web-server(*) (as opposed to your web site), you could use 'ab - the apache 
benchmark'
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html

It should be included as part of your apache installation.

(*) Judging by your request of something similar to pylot

I installed xbacklight 1.1.3, and then tried to execute it, but 'No

with xrandr, but even that didn't work.

Hi

I have a requirement to download an entire website content for easy online
access.I would normally do that with a

$wget -r --no-parent <url>

The problem is that the site
http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/courses/Webcourse-contents/IIT-%20Guwahati/afl/index.htm
is divided into frames. The Left hand side frame containing the links, is a
tree automaticall generate by a js file "display.js"
When i try to download recursively, the js is dnlded but not the links, as
they are defined in the javascript intelligently(to prevent such dnlds i
guess :) )

Does anyone know a hack/workaround/FOSS that would solve my problem?

Cheers!

I am interested in the referer field that fetches the logo image from
my website.

I want to know which of my articles are drawing the most readers.

I can use to cut to find out. First the solution. Then the explanation.

$ grep Girish access.log | cut -d\" -f4

http://aplawrence.com/Girish/ntp.html
http://aplawrence.com/Girish/spiderweb.html
http://aplawrence.com/Girish/gv-rrdtool.html


What did I do?

I split the line into multiple fields using double quote(") as the
field separator. I had to use a backslash since the shell
gets confused when you use a single or a double quote without closing.

Think of cut(1) as a son/daughter of grep.

grep fetches relevant lines from a text file.

cut fetches relevant fields from a line.

cut is a very powerful command. Please learn it thoroughly.

It is very useful in shell scripts.

I will give  you one more real life example.

I want to find out the disk size of a medium on which the user wishes
to install SpamCheetah.

It could be a hard disk(IDE/SCSI/SATA) or it could be a USB memory
stick or a USB hard disk or a DOM flash.

Before I proceed I want to ensure that the disk space is sufficient
and I also want the user to identify the drive in question
from the size reported.

I use the BSD disklabel(8) command for that. But I want only the size
and not other stuff on the line.

There is one more detail. No shell utility will be able to multiply
the disklabel result with 512 without overflowing.

Nowadays you have massive disks...

So I resorted to using a high precision calculator bc(1) in batch mode.

There are many other uses for cut.

Message-ID: <98f424a30910162248t69f46a78y673c28d0a24203c8@mail.gmail.com>

Wish you all a very happy deepavali(not :) diwali )! I just was enlightened
by my professor with some info  i had no idea about. I think every Indian
ought to know this!

*Significance of Diwali*

India is a land of festivals where you will see at least one major festival
each month.* Deepavali* (or Diwali) which literally means "rows of lamps" is
one of the four main festivals of India. Throughout the world all Hindus
celebrate Deepavali or Diwali with great pomp and enthusiasm.

The celebration of Diwali lasts six days, beginning on the 12th day of the
month of Kartik (as per the North Indian lunar calendar). The day before
Diwali, in order to evoke the grace of God, women fast. It is not that God
wants you to go hungry or takes pleasure in your suffering - the principle
is that you gain only by giving up. That evening, devotees worship Gomata
(the cow) and her calf and feed them special food. Women pray for the
welfare of the entire family. This holy day is called *Vasubaras*.

The first official day of Diwali falls on the 13th of Kartik. People set
about cleaning houses and shops, and decorating doorsteps and courtyards
with rangoli or multi-coloured designs. They purchase gold ornaments, new
vessels, clothes, and other such items. Devotees arise early in the morning
before sunrise and take oil baths. If possible, they wear new clothes. In
the evening, people worship coins representing wealth. Families decorate
houses and courtyards with lanterns giving a warm glow to the night. This
day of celebration is called* Dhantrayodashi* or* Dhanteras.*

The second day is called* Naraka Chaturdashi*. People take an oil bath in
the early morning and then in the night they light lamps and burn
firecrackers. People visit their relatives and friends, exchanging love and
sweets.

On the third day, people worship Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth. People
decorate their houses with lit lamps and lanterns to welcome Lakshmi to
their home and hearts. On this day businessmen close old accounts and open
new accounts. The earth is lit up by lamps and the skies are coloured by the
multi-hued lights of fireworks.

In North India, the *Govardhana Puja* occurs on the fourth day of Diwali.
Devotees in the North build large mounds made of cow dung, symbolising
Govardhana - the mountain that Krishna lifted up with his finger to save the
villagers of Vrindavan from rain - and decorate and worship them. North
Indians observe this day as *Annakoot*, or the mountain of food.

The fifth day of the festival called *Bhaiyya Dooj* celebrates unique and
fun customs. Every man dines in his sister's house, and, in return, presents
her with gifts. North India calls it Yama Dwitiya. Thousands of brothers and
sisters join hands and have a sacred bath in the river Yamuna.
The Legends

*Dhanteras *
The scriptures mention the divinity called Dhanvantari emerging from the
churning of the ocean holding a kalash (pot) filled with Amrit (ambrosia).
Due to the fact that Dhanvantari, who revealed the science of Ayurveda to
the world, first manifested on this day, all over India, doctors following
the Ayurvedic system of medicine organise joyful celebrations during the
annual Dhanvantari festival.

*Naraka Chaturdashi*
There is a legend about a king of Prag-Jyotishpur, named Narakasura. He was
a powerful king who misused power to harass his subjects. Sri Krishna
destroyed this oppressive asura king on this day. Unjustly imprisoned people
celebrated their freedom with friends and family. The citizens celebrated
their deliverance from Narkasura's reign by lighting lamps.

*Sri Rama*
Deepavali falls on a no-moon day - in fact the darkest day of the year. The
illuminations and fireworks, joy and festivities, are to signify the victory
of divine forces over the powers of darkness. On Deepavali day, triumphant
Sri Rama is said to have returned to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana, the
asura king of Lanka.

*Goddess Lakshmi Devi*
The Puranas say that it was on this day that Goddess Lakshmi, who emerged
from the churning of the ocean of milk (Ksheera Sagara), married Lord
Vishnu, the repository of all divine qualities.

*Govardhana Puja*
In order to shelter the gopis and gopas and their cows from the torrential
rains sent by Indra, Krishna lifted a hill near Mathura called Govardhana
with his finger and sheltered all the people for a period of seven days
under it. By then Indra saw Krishna's greatness and asked him for
forgiveness.

*Bhaiyya Dooj
*The river Yamuna and Yama, the God of Death, were brother and sister. As
they grew up they went their different ways. On this day Yama supposedly
visited his sister Yamuna, who in her joy at seeing her brother after such a
long interlude set up a feast for him. Pleased, Yama granted her a boon. He
declared that every man that receives a tilak or vermilion mark on the
forehead from his sister and presents her with lovely gifts on this day
would attain higher worlds.

*The message of Deepavali
*The traditional name of India is* Bharata* and Indians are *Bharatias* - or
'those who revel in light'. During the night of Deepavali the myriad little
clay lamps (diyas) seem to silently send forth message of Deepavali: "Come,
let us remove darkness from the face of the earth."

The dharma of fire is the same wherever it is: in a poor man's house, in a
rich man's house, in America, in Antarctica, or in the Himalayas. It gives
light and heat. The flame always points upwards. Even if we keep the lamp
upside down, the flame will burn upwards. The message is that our mind
should be focused on the * Atman*, the Self wherever we are. The lamps
remind us of our dharma to realise our divine nature.

"The Self is pure consicousness which is self-luminous. The cognition of all
objects arises from the light of pure Consciousness." -*says Bhrihadaranyaka
Upanishad*

One lamp can light several others. You can even light another 1000 lamps,
and still the flame and the light of the first lamp will remain as it is. By
becoming manifold, the light looses nothing. The lights of Deepavali
represent Brahman and creation. It conveys the message of the mantra:

*"Purnamada Purnamidam Purnaat Purnamudachyate
Purnasya Purnamadaya Purnamevasishyate"
*

The rows of lamps teach yet another important lesson of unity. The light
that shines forth from the Sun, the moon, the stars, and fire is all the
same. To see and recognise that* one light*, the light of consciousness,
which is manifesting and pulsating in and through all of creation is the
goal of life. Thus, recognising all of creation to be an expression of your
true Self, spread the light of love and compassion.

The lights of Deepavali are displayed at the entrance doors, by the walls of
houses, in the streets and lanes. This means that the inner spiritual light
of the individual must be reflected outside. It should benefit society.
Passers-by may thereby be prevented from stumbling on their way to reach
their destination.
Feeding empty stomachs, lighting blown-out diyas and bringing light to those
whose lives are in darkness is the true spirit of Deepavali. This is true
prayer.

for *nix and dowthemall does not do a recursive download.

I see ... and this is relevant to ILUG Chennai because?

 1. The "I" stands for India so everything about it is relevant?

 2. Because if you circulate this message then it will instantly
    cause your knowledge about GNU/Linux to grow many fold!?

 3. The row of lights represents the successive versions of Linux and
    other GNU software which will defeat the evil (but smart) Ravana
    of proprietary software!?

I'm unconvinced. :-)

Having access to someone's mail address (or being subscribed to a
mailing list) does not mean that _everything_ of interest to you must
be circulated to all these addresses!

Subject: [Ilugc] .a-tip-a-day. (TERM variable and X colors)
Message-ID: <7938ae610910171749g742a6c74xe0a6b2d5b7a8013@mail.gmail.com>

Usually I do this:

$ xterm -bg black -fg green &

or

$ xterm -bg black -fg yellow &

or my fg could be " salmon, orange, turquoise, blue, red" whatever.

And

$ ls

showing colorized output needs some more work under UNIX. Under linux,
that is the default. And
that annoys some people.

$ colorls -G

is what works in OpenBSD.

Under linux,

$ ls --color

may be necessary.

You can also view man pages in color.

Just copy the /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm-color to ~/.Xdefaults.

Edit the lines:

! Set the default text foreground and background colors.
*VT100*foreground: green
*VT100*background: black
! Uncomment this to use color for underline attribute
*VT100*colorULMode: on
*VT100*colorUL: yellow

*VT100*italicULMode: on

! Uncomment this to disable underlining, e.g., if colorULMode is set.
!*VT100*underLine: off

! Uncomment this to use color for the bold attribute
*VT100*colorBDMode: on
*VT100*colorBD: turquoise

! Uncomment this to use the bold/underline colors in preference to other colors
*VT100*colorAttrMode: on

That is all.

I have no clue what to do on braindead commercial UNIX OSes like HP UX
or IBM AIX.

On Solaris you have the thoroughly boring color scheme of CDE which I
remember seeing in my
early Novell days. I believe in academic institutions and places like
IITM CS dept, you have them.

You can certainly make your life colorful without being distracting.
Needs effort.

No simple answer.

I normally do this.

$ export TERM=rxvt

or

$ export TERM=xterm-color

You could store them in ~/.profile.

On the console also you can get colors. Nowadays Debian has copied the
OpenBSD idea of
color man pages on the console in green.

I do

$ export TERM=wsvt25

in OpenBSD. This will certainly not work on linux.

If you have TERM variable set as vt100 or vt220, you will surely not get colors.

But that is guaranteed to work on any terminal.

Try your luck.

I get the fact that you are a cynic. But also take some time off to
appreciate when a festival like diwali comes along emphasizing the spirit of
giving and spreading joy. I was just doing my part in that. Everything in
this world does not revolve around GNU/Linux! Take some time off to enjoy
things around you!

PS: I mentioned the word GNU/Linux, so i hope this not classify as spam?

The content in the website is free to access :- both the videos and the
course material. In the case of restricted internet access, one can pay the
respective amounts for obtaining DVD's of the videos of the courses through

Yes, unfortunately. But, this mailing list is only about F/OSS! So,
you can be questioned.

Every one has the right to do what they want. You needn't tell them :)

But, when it comes to a mailing list where you send e-mails to
everyone, it helps to follow the list decorum.

Yes and Deepavali is not the only festival. In India, we can relate
most of the days to some event belong to some specific religion. Our
members also belongs to different religion and if every one start
sending seasonal greetings, then we will see only greetings in this
list. So please restrict your discussions only to FOSS related
topics.

DON'T SEND SEASONAL GREETINGS TO THE LIST. STOP.

Bye :)

Instead of polluting the environment, we are now polluting the web with
Flash files :-)  It does play with Gnash however.

please do not bottom post - it is as bad as top post. This is a bottom post to 
show how irritating it is to scrool miles down to read one line.

Message-ID: <7938ae610910172335o6cd80e49o90c793f875c1dd8d@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I had to write a stub code for reading and writing binary and text
files as part of my MAPI work.

I thought I will share this with you all since it is very useful for
you to learn C.

Please find the code with sexy syntax highlighting here:

http://gayatri-hitech.com/Misc/fio.c.html

Just copy paste it as fio.c

Then write a makefile.

$ cat Makefile
all : fio

 fio : fio.c
       gcc $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@

This sample also illustrates using the syslog facility which can
double up as printf to the console when given the
flags PCONS.

Have fun!

Ever yours,
Girish

Hi Kenneth

Well, i got a mail from the very same group earlier with a mailing list
etiquette where it was specifically mentioned that i have to top post. Well,
i really cannot suit my mails to the fashions of different people wanting to
read different mails differently.So please bear with it.

Check out 1 October 2009, Mailing list guidelines: monthly reminder , by
Shrinivasan T

PS:I did not find your bottom post irritating, as in gmail it shows old
posts as quoted text.

Cheers!

Sorry for not being clear, what I meant to inquire whether somebody could 
confirm if the DVDs were /really/ available at this point in time ? I tend to be 
a bit cynical/skeptical about any GoI efforts to 'disseminate education' -- The 
intent usually is really good, but the implementations fail. So, I won't be 
surprised to learn that the DVDs are not really ready.

Also, I wonder what are the redistribution terms, for instance, if I receive a 
DVD can I make copies and redistribute them ? Anyways, now that I am 
sufficiently curious, I'll send out a mail to the people involved and ask them 
about the licensing terms. I'll update the list about this.

cheers,
- steve

Hi

I have came across this software Stardict http://stardict.sourceforge.net .
It is pretty useful tool having some cool features like Adding
dictionaries,thesaurus and showing the meaning of a word when you double
click on it. It also has an amazing plugin to help you learn the
pronounciation of the word i.e it reads out the word to you.

It would be useful for people writing GRE/TOEFL/IELTS or just in learning
the language

Cheers!

this is wrong - it should read 'always use interleaved posting'. I have been

See, i am pretty new to the mailing list and dont know that much about the
etiquette. I just followed the ones stipulated in the guidelines, to
maintain uniformity. People like you who have been active in the list for
long, have to point me in the right way. I am pretty open to ideas.I agree
with you though, top posting is more convenient. Thanks for pointing it out
to me.
Hope to learn more :)

PS:Following your advice, will top post from now

I only changed it in my presentation (slide #9) with 'interleaved,
trimmed, bottom posting' as per yours and Kumar Appaiahs' suggestions:
http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/mailing-list-etiquette.pdf

You need to have contacted Bharathi (who had access) for the changes
at chennailug.org (earlier). Of course, now we have our own domains,
where anyone can do the document changes.

I would suggest to leave out the term 'bottom posting' and instead use 
'interleaved, trimmed, with each part of the post below the relevant quoted 
material, leaving one blank line between the quoted material and the post'

I think that you either suffer from a reading impairment, low attention span or 
a lack of understanding of the english language.

By saying that bottom-posting is wrong, Kenneth /did not/ imply that top-posting 
is right. In fact he was very explicit in pointing out that ...

>>  this is wrong - it should read 'always use interleaved posting'.

interleaved posting is what I am doing here, just in case it didn't register.

Sorry for being rude, but you started being rude by:

a. Sending to my mail box a post was utterly off-topic for this list
b. Defending your post when it was pointed out to be so
c. Refusing to read and comprehend the mails that were correcting you politely
d. ...and not once believing and accepting that you did any thing wrong.

Behaving in such a pompous manner will not gain you any regard in this 
community. Remember that for every person who takes the time to politely correct 
you, there are at least 10 others who feel the same way, but hold themselves 
back to avoid more noise on the list.

Hope you can understand this mail.

cheers,
- steve

Hi all

This is especially intended for Kapil, Bharathi, Shakti and Steve. I thank
Steve for letting me know my mistakes in a cut and clear way. I apologise if
i was being pompous, or downright irritating. I realize that i was wrong in
1.Posting seasonal greetings on the list
2.Failing to read the guidelines before replying
3.Replying out of spontaneity rather than thinking

Please do forgive me for the same

Varrun

If a person cannot top post to a Free and Open Source list, I really 
don't understand what is the kind of freedom we talk about all the time.

Of course, I do appreciate the list's guidelines.

OP is practicing the freedom he has. Freedom.

May be ILUGC (or the prominent ones in ILUGC) sould filter all he 
'wanna-be' members by screening them.

I joined the TurboGears list as my work involves the framework.
They do not even complain when there's a spam  mail to the list. 
(eventually it gets handled too).

I'm sorry folks, I am really tired of the noise in this list.

Thanks!
But I'd like to know what you think of the noise rate on this list!

I am a Linux noob, alright.
I wasn't talking about the FSF philosophy.

Is it so difficult to reply to a person privately, telling him not to 
top/bottom post?
Does it really require such a mail to be addressed to the list, with all 
the talking we've done over years to keep the archives clean and helpful 
to others??

Thanks,

If we start advising people off the list, then where will be the 
opportunity for those silent, non-participating "n00b"s to learn what's 
right and what's not?
And, is it so difficult to press Delete button than adding to noise?

There are two simple rules for peaceful life in this list - [1] when a 
spam comes just ignore, [2] when a spammer is pointed out to his 
mistakes, or even flamed, do not add fuel to fire or more to the noise, 
justifying his acts in the name of freedom.

The whole point of having a mailing list for discussion is that
everyone knows about the discussions.

Why do you worry about the archives? With people from different
backgrounds, it is not uncommon to have differences of opinion. What
is wrong in being honest and having open discussions?

The point is new newbies always join the list, and seldom know about
list guidelines. So, reiterating the same helps them and others know
about it. You are welcome to ignore the repetitive reminders, and move
on.

If "engineering curriculum" include these in their first semester
"Technical English" course, and people follow them in real life, I am
more than happy. Unfortunately, there is no other place where such
decorum are being taught! Yes, it is a shame that we have to teach
such things to "students". Sadly, F/OSS user groups are the only place
where these are addressed.

Subject: ML Noise and Community (Was Re: [Ilugc] significance of deepavali)
Message-ID: <20091018120343.GA9710@imsc.res.in>

Hello,

A long response to Anthoni Shogun's query about why we don't just
ignore bad postings in this list.

FOSS is largely a _community_ activity. If people behave badly with
the community then even great ideas, coding or philosophy cannot
excuse them. If you don't believe me then see the criticism of people
like Stallman, Schilling and Shuttleworth over the last few years.

According to me, the "freedom" in FOSS is more in the sense of the
fundamental rights granted by the constitution --- these come along
with some fundamental duties. In summary, if you will not work with
the community then the community will not work for you.

Thus, a big part of working with FOSS is learning to use your ego
to drive you to be more creative rather than use it to fight other
creators. This involves learning to use mail, irc, comments, commit
messages and the like to _communicate_ on those things which other
people want to hear _in context_. A long comparision on the BSD
licence vs. GPL license will not be welcome within a comment section
of a source file even though it may be completely relevant in an
online forum.

There are two ways in which most community members react to stuff
that violates community guidelines. One is to ignore the poster.
This is the method used on high-volume lists. Some other lists like
ILUG-C have many more newcomers and are low-volume enough that
attempting-to-educate is a legitimate alternative. The latter may sound
like "noise" to those used to the former kind of list. However, note
that elimination of such noise from one's mail reader is just a matter
of learning to "kill-thread" in incoming mailing list mail.

Regards,

Kapil.

Subject: [Ilugc] Handling mailing lists - part 1
Message-ID: <20091018122811.GA10728@imsc.res.in>

Hello,

Since handling mailing lists was referred to in my earlier mail here
is "part 1" of a tutorial on handling mailing list traffic. I hope
other parts will be written by others.

1. If you subscribe to many mailing lists then learning to filter
your incoming mail is a must. If you use a shell account and then
learn the use of "procmail" or "maildrop" or "sieve". I believe
most webmail interfaces also offer some filtering.

2. Distinguish between spam and non-spam. Almost all mailing lists
receive spam and so having a spam filter in place is definitely
useful.

3. Filter incoming mail into separate folders based on the community
involved. One folder per mailing-list is not essential but is
sometimes the simplest thing to do!

4. Do not make the mistake of marking "noise" on the list as "spam".
You could effectively be cutting yourself off from the list if you do
so.  The "noise" usually has _specific_ characteristics that mark it as
unwelcome. Use your filter to select based on these characteristics
(given in increasing order of severity):
 a. thread (usually given by the "In-Reply-To" or other message ID
 headers)
 b. topic
 c. poster (this is the last resort!)

5. Be prepared to deal with a lot of incoming mail! Since most
mailing lists are archived you may wish to stop receiving mailing
list traffic (or auto-delete mailing list traffic) when you do not
have time to read the mailing list.

Regards,

Kapil.

sqlite3 is a fantastic embedded database. It has none of the client
server complications of mysql or postgres.

Most open source projects use sqlite3 in some way or other. All
webmail programs do. roundcube does.

And my experience with it has been really pleasant though I learnt it only now.

It has many bindings in many languages. Of course it can be accessed
thro' perl, C, python, lua...

Drupal spreads it's data over the DB and the file system.  You need
to grab both if you want a backup of your entire drupal site.

This drupal module can help you backup your DB:
http://drupal.org/project/backup_migrate

To backup the files, it's probably easiest to just rsync your entire
drupal site.  If you use backup_migrate, you can grab the DB dump
as well over the same rsync session.

Here's how you can backup using rsync:

8.04 is LTS. If this is a server, running a version with a longer
lifecycle probably is better.

For those who are interested, I have a little more to say about sqlite.

1) It does not run as a server. So in languages, you can have only one open
connection on the database and you cannot have 2 writers. I learnt this the
hard way with sqlite-jdbc. I did not do my groundwork and later found that it
is documented in http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/usage.html). I don't
remember having any such problem in sqlite in ruby or python though.
Maybe I just did it right

2) Listing the tables that are present is very simple
sqite>.tables
<LIST OF TABLES>

3) Your database IS A SINGLE FILE!

4) .schema prints the table's create statements.

5) It lacks some SQL standard features like triggers. and privileges.But then,
I never needed them in my apps

6) Queries are evil-fast

The man page of mmv says :

But I don't care about the other features. For me this is very useful.

This is cool. I can also do many advanced tricks.

So far a one command batch move function was missing from the almighty
UNIX command line.

Now you have it. I should also profusely thank an IIT Roorkee student
who asked me to run a tip on
this to me in a personal mail long ago. Sorry I don't recollect his
name. I took a long time to learn it. ;)

mmv is safe(does not overwrite files), you can do advanced stuff with
it but it is a
cryptic utility made needlessly complex but
you will get your head around it in a while.

This article will be a great help.

http://linux.dsplabs.com.au/mmv-copy-append-link-move-multiple-files-under-linux-shell-bash-by-wildcard-patterns-p5/

It reminds me of par(1) in its unnecessary complexity but it is not as
bad as that.

Subject: [Ilugc] Fedora 12 Beta now available!
Message-ID: <4ADDC32E.6000605@fedoraproject.org>

Hi.

--

Fedora is a leading edge, free and open source operating system that
continues to deliver innovative features to many users, with a new
release every six months. We have reached the Fedora 12 Beta, the last
important development milestone of Fedora 12. Only critical bug fixes
will be pushed as updates leading up to the general release of Fedora
12, scheduled to be released in mid-November. We invite you to join us
and participate in making Fedora 12 a solid release by downloading,
testing, and providing us your valuable feedback.

http://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease

Of course, this is a beta release, some problems may still be lurking.
Should you trip across one of them, be sure it gets fixed before release
by reporting your discovery at:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/

Thank you!

What's New in Fedora 12?

* Optimized performance - All software packages on 32-bit (x86_32)
architecture have been compiled for i686 systems with special
optimization for Intel Atom processors used in many netbooks but without
losing compatibility with the overwhelming majority of CPUs. There is a
list of the rare CPUs which will no longer be supported.

* Smaller and faster updates - In Fedora 11, the optional yum-presto
plugin, developed by Fedora contributor Jonathan Dieter, reduced update
size by transmitting only the changes in the updated packages. Now, the
plugin is installed by default. Also, RPMs now use XZ rather than gzip
for compression, providing smaller package sizes without the memory and
CPU penalties associated with bzip2. This lets us fit more software into
each Fedora image, and uses less space on mirrors, making their
administrators' lives a little easier. Thanks to the Fedora
infrastructure team for their work in generating delta RPMs.

* NetworkManager broadband and other enhancements - NetworkManager,
originally developed by Red Hat's Dan Williams, was introduced in Fedora
7 and has become the de facto network configuration solution for
distributions everywhere. Enhancements to NetworkManager make both
system-wide connections and mobile broadband connections easier than
ever. Signal strength and network selection are available for choosing
the best mobile broadband connection when you're on the road. Bluetooth
PAN support offers a simple click through process to access the Internet
from your mobile phone. NetworkManager can now configure always-on and
static address connections directly from the desktop. PolicyKit
integration has been added so configuration management can be done via
central policy where needed. IPv6 support has also been improved.

* Next-generation (Ogg) Theora video - For several years, Theora, the
open and free format not encumbered by known patents has provided a way
for freedom-loving users to share video. Fedora 12 includes the new
Theora 1.1, which achieves near-H.264 quality, meeting the expectations
of demanding users with crisp, vibrant media in both streaming and
downloadable form. Thanks to the work of the Xiph.Org Foundation's
Christopher "Monty" Montgomery, sponsored by Red Hat, other Xiph
developers, and the contribution of Mozilla.org, Firefox 3.5 can deliver
free media on the web out of the box, using the Theora video and Vorbis
audio formats even better than the previous release of Fedora.

* Graphics support improvements - Fedora 12 introduces experimental 3D
support for AMD Radeon HD 2400 and later graphics cards. To try it out,
install the mesa-dri-drivers-experimental package. On many cards, this
support should allow desktop effects to be used. Kernel mode setting
(KMS) support, which was introduced on AMD hardware in Fedora 10 and
extended to Intel hardware in Fedora 11, is now extended to NVIDIA
hardware as well, meaning the great majority of systems now benefit from
the smooth, fully-graphical startup sequence made possible by KMS. The
Fedora graphical startup sequence now works better on systems with
multiple monitors. Also on multiple monitor systems, the desktop will
now automatically be spread across all monitors by default, rather than
having all monitors display the same output, including on NVIDIA chips
(where multiple monitor spanning was not possible without manual
configuration changes in Fedora 11). Systems with NVIDIA graphics chips
also gain initial support for suspend and resume functionality via the
default Nouveau driver. Initial support for the new DisplayPort display
connector has been added for Intel graphics chips. Support for Nvidia
and ATI systems is already under rapid development and will be included
in the next release of Fedora. Thanks to the Red Hat Xorg team including
Adam Jackson (X server), Kristian H?gsberg (Intel driver), Dave Airlie
and Jerome Glisse (Radeon driver for AMD), and Ben Skeggs (Nouveau
driver for NVIDIA).

* Virtualization improvements - Not content with all the improvements in
Fedora 11, we've kicked virtualization based on KVM up another notch in
Fedora 12. There are extensive improvements in performance, management,
resource sharing, and still more security enhancements. A new library
(libguestfs) and an interactive tool (guestfish) are now available for
directly accessing and modifying virtual machine disk images.

* Automatic reporting of crashes and SELinux issues - Abrt, a tool to
help non-power users report crashes to Bugzilla with a few mouse clicks,
is now enabled by default. Abrt collects detailed information
automatically and helps developers identify and resolve issues faster,
improving the quality of individual upstream components and Fedora. The
SELinux alert monitoring tool has also added the ability to report
SELinux issues to Bugzilla quickly and easily with just a couple of
clicks.

* New Dracut initrd generation tool - Up until Fedora 11, the boot
system (initial ram disk or initrd) used to boot Fedora was monolithic,
very distribution specific and didn't provide much flexibility. This has
been replaced with Dracut, an initial ram disk generation tool with an
event-based framework designed to be distribution-independent thanks to
the Dracut team including Harald Hoyer, Jeremy Katz, Dave Jones and many
others. It has been also adopted by OLPC which uses Fedora; OLPC modules
for Dracut are available in the Fedora repository.

* PackageKit plugins - PackageKit now has a plugin which can install an
appropriate package when a user tries to run a command from a missing
package. Another new plugin allows installation of software packages
from a web browser. Thanks to Red Hat's Richard Hughes and the
PackageKit team.

* Bluetooth on-demand - Bluetooth services are automatically started
when needed and stopped 30 seconds after last device use, reducing
initial startup time and resource use when Bluetooth is not in active
use. Thanks to Red Hat's Bastien Nocera.

* Moblin graphical interface for netbooks - The Moblin graphical
interface and applications are fully integrated thanks to Peter
Robinson, a Fedora Project volunteer, and others. To use it, just
install the Moblin Desktop Environment package group using yum or the
graphical software management tools, and choose Moblin from the login
manager. A F12 Moblin Fedora Remix (installable Live CD) will also be
available.

* PulseAudio enhancements - Red Hat's Lennart Poettering and several
others have made significant improvements to the PulseAudio system.
Improved mixer logic makes volume control more fine-grained and
reliable. Integration with the Rygel UPnP media server means you can
stream audio directly from your system to any UPnP / DLNA client, such
as a Playstation 3. Hotplug support has been made more intelligent, so
if you configure a device as the default output for a stream, unplug
that device -- causing the stream(s) to be moved to another output
device -- and later replug it, the stream is moved back to the preferred
device. Finally, Bluetooth audio support means pairing with any
Bluetooth audio device makes it available for use through PulseAudio.

* Lower process privileges - In order to mitigate the impact of security
vulnerabilities, permissions have been hardened for many files and
system directories and process privileges have been lowered for a number
of core components that require super user privileges. Red Hat's Steve
Grubb has developed a new library, libcap-ng, and integrated it into
many core system components to improve the security of Fedora.

* SELinux sandbox - It is now possible to confine applications' access
to the system and run them in a secure sandbox that takes advantage of
the sophisticated capabilities of SELinux. Dan Walsh, SELinux developer
at Red Hat, explains the details at
http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/31146.html

* Open Broadcom firmware - The openfwwf open source Broadcom firmware is
included by default. This means wireless networking will be available
out of the box on some Broadcom chipsets.

* Hybrid live images - The Live images provided in this release can be
directly imaged onto a USB stick using dd (or any equivalent tool) to
create bootable Live USB keys. The Fedora Live USB Creator for Windows
and the livecd-tools for Fedora are still recommended for data
persistence and non-destructive writes. Thanks to Jeremy Katz.

* Better webcam support - While Fedora 11 improved webcam support, in
Fedora 12 you can expect even better video quality, especially for less
expensive webcams. Red Hat's Hans de Goede, developer of the libv4l
library, has more details on his continuous upstream webcam support
enhancements at http://hansdegoede.livejournal.com/6989.html.

* GNOME 2.28 - The latest version of the GNOME desktop includes the
lighter Gnote replacement for Tomboy as the default note application,
and Empathy replaces Pidgin as the default instant messenger. The new
volume control application, first seen in Fedora 11, has been improved
to restore some of the popular functionality from earlier releases
without making the interface too complex.

* GNOME Shell preview - Fedora 12 includes an early version of GNOME
Shell, which will become the default interface for GNOME 3.0 and beyond.
To try it, install the gnome-shell package, and use the Desktop Effects
configuration tool to enable it. It will only work correctly from the
GNOME desktop environment, not others such as KDE or Xfce. This is a
preview technology, and some video cards may not be supported.

* KDE 4.3 - The new KDE features an updated "Air" theme and fully
configurable keyboard shortcuts in Plasma, improved performance and new
desktop effects in the window manager, a new bug reporting tool, and a
configuration tool for the LIRC infra-red remote control system.

* Cool new stuff for developers beginning with Eclipse Galileo, which
includes more plugins than ever before. Perl 6 is now included, along
with PHP 5.3. For Haskell developers, the Haskell Platform now provides
a standardized set of libraries and tools. But one of the biggest
changes for developers is that most of the nice new features of Fedora
12, from Bluetooth to WebCams is implemented through underlying
libraries, and many of the improvements will be included simply by
relinking your application. Also available in this release are SystemTap
1.0 for improved instrumenting and debugging of binaries, complete with
Eclipse integration, and the newest NetBeans IDE for Java development.

* Cool new stuff for sysadmins includes added functionality for
clustered Samba services (including active/active configurations) over
GFS2; and the ability to boot a cluster of Fedora systems from a single,
shared root file system.

* Multi-Pointer X - The update to X.Org server 1.7 introduces the X
Input Extension version 2.0 (XI2), with much work contributed by Red
Hat's Peter Hutterer. This extension provides a new client API for
handling input devices and also Multi-Pointer X (MPX) functionality. MPX
functionality allows X to cope with many inputs of arbitrary types
simultaneously, a prerequisite for (among others) multitouch-based
desktops and multi-user interaction on a single screen. This is
low-level work that applications and desktop environments will
incrementally take advantage of in future releases. More details are
available in the Release Notes and in the XI2 tag of Peter Hutterer's
blog at http://who-t.blogspot.com/search/label/xi2

This post is bit heavy so let us start with a joke.

Long ago when  there was an ad in Sun TV which
went like this:

"India tholai katchigalil muthal muraiyaga... putham puthiya thirai
padam Sun TV yil."

Another concept was the "Rajni vaaram" or "Vivek vaaaram" concept of
running related movies for
one week in KTV.

I want to spend some 3 days or so talking about lua.

Lua is a new programming language developed by Brazil I think and it
is Brazilian for moon.

That is why you find the crescent symbol in their websites.

Here is a nice sample:


-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- UDP sample: echo protocol client
-- LuaSocket sample files
-- Author: Diego Nehab
-- RCS ID: $Id: echoclnt.lua,v 1.10 2005/01/02 22:44:00 diego Exp $
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
local socket = require("socket")
host = host or "localhost"
port = port or 1234
if arg then
    host = arg[1] or host
    port = arg[2] or port
end
host = socket.dns.toip(host)
udp = assert(socket.udp())
assert(udp:setpeername(host, port))
print("Using remote host '" ..host.. "' and port " .. port .. "...")
while 1 do
        line = io.read()
        if not line or line == "" then os.exit() end
        assert(udp:send(line))
        dgram = assert(udp:receive())
        print(dgram)
end

Just copy paste this and use this server with it:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- UDP sample: echo protocol server
-- LuaSocket sample files
-- Author: Diego Nehab
-- RCS ID: $Id: echosrvr.lua,v 1.12 2005/11/22 08:33:29 diego Exp $
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
local socket = require("socket")
host = host or "127.0.0.1"
port = port or 1234
if arg then
    host = arg[1] or host
    port = arg[2] or port
end
print("Binding to host '" ..host.. "' and port " ..port.. "...")
udp = assert(socket.udp())
assert(udp:setsockname(host, port))
assert(udp:settimeout(5))
ip, port = udp:getsockname()
assert(ip, port)
print("Waiting packets on " .. ip .. ":" .. port .. "...")
while 1 do
        dgram, ip, port = udp:receivefrom()
        if dgram then
                print("Echoing '" .. dgram .. "' to " .. ip .. ":" .. port)
                udp:sendto(dgram, ip, port)
        else
        print(ip)
    end
end

Now you know what to do.

Is this post too long for LUG? ;)

I will analyze this program tomorrow. Since you guys have switched off already.

I shall teach lua in the next couple of days.

I am a little confused. I spoke to Bharathi just now and I am not quite sure
whether my approach will fly. How can I teach lua in 3 days?

As to why lua?

Well it is way too obvious. ;)

It is a small programming language. It is perhaps as small as a scripting
language can ever get.

I like all things small. jQuery, OpenBSD, C.

And it is not my preference alone that you should care about(if  you care
about that at all).

Small things are the most powerful.

lua is used for various tasks like embedding config file parsing in
the C UNIX daemons for instance. It is trivial to embed a lua
interpreter into C code.

I don't remember how I got to know lua or even how I got to know Shreya.

Nowadays it has become so familiar especially with the

'Call Mumbai like you call Madurai' ads that  I forget the initial introduction.

ion window manager has excellent lua integration. All configurations in
ion are done using lua scripts.

lua can be used for generating thumbnails of images, for socket
communication for simple text based protocols like HTTP, SMTP or FTP.

It can be used for math and whatever perl or python can do.

Its potential is already very obvious to me.

I think I have tried to sell it in a small way.

In case you are still not convinced perhaps looking at my sample code
would help? Obviously I am not the author. ;)

There are more things to Lua than just the size of the language.
llvm-lua [as with all other languages ported to the llvm optimizer and
code generator] is bound to make it uber-quick. There are quite
a few apps using lua. elinks, scite, some Windows games...

And of course. The fact that it is not "batteries included" like python
means that you have a good chance of implementing some
libraries yourself :)

P.S: This is a strange co-incidence since I got llvm-lua running
just yesterday and it was the first project I was looking forward to
seriously contribute to :P

Message-ID: <cdc8c4430910202225w23187a3cr3484cf313561e039@mail.gmail.com>

I was planning to install Fedora 7 (I agree it's a VERY old version, at this
point I don't have a copy of Fedora 10 or 11 CD/DVD) in my home PC.
With the first /dev/hda already running Fedora 5 (agreed, am out-o-f-date),
I backed up the data in /dev/hdb and booted via Fedora 7 CD.
Via the install process (GUI driven) I created fresh partitions in /dev/hdb,
formatted them, selected the packages to install and started the
installation; few minutes into the installation, install complained that it
didn't have enough space (aoubt 900mb) for /mnt/sysimage (something like
that).

So, I decided to defer the installation and reboot back into original config
with FC5 but GRUB complained with Error 22.

FWIW, FC7 CD came bundled with EFY Dec'07 issue and during the installation,
GRUB did not detect my existing operating systems in /dev/hda.
I had multiple FC5 running different kernels, Ubuntu (again quite old) and
win 2000.

Looking at Google search and browsing, and reading through the various
forums, it seems to me that the existing OS cofigs in /dev/hda is lost
forever ?
Is this correct ? or is there a way to recover and fix this permanently to
retrieve the working config ?

Thanks in advance for your time and consideration.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TAMTRANS] discussions on tamil translation
Message-ID: <200910211305.15508.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

Hi,

I am getting more and more fed up with the quality of tamil translation being 
done. I find a great emphasis on finding 'beautiful and esoteric' tamil words, 
and very little emphasis on conveying the exact meaning to people who only 
know Tamil. I feel that unless one has a thorough understanding of the source 
language (english), one cannot really translate properly. Unfortunately people 
are very uncritical - as long as it is in 'good' Tamil, they praise it without 
worrying whether it conveys the meaning or not. I am doing a fair amount of 
translation now, and would like to discuss these translations with people who 
are speakers of Tamil to see whether I am able to get the meaning across in 
simple Tamil that the common man can understand. So as not to irritate people 
who are not interested in this subject I will prefix all posts on this topic 
with [TAMTRANS] so that those not interested can filter out these mails with 
the keyword given. (please note that I am not a native speaker of Tamil and 
hence my grammar and spelling would need correction. I hope people on this 
list can help out.) One example I see is translating 'home' as ????, whereas 
according to the context it could be ????????, ????????, ????????, ??????? etc. Anyway, I 
translated one sentence as:

??????????????????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ???????? ?????????????. Does this make sense? If so, what would 
the common man understand from this sentence?

Thanks for the initiative. I would be happy to offer any help, I can, as a
native speaker of Tamil.

Your translated sentence does convey 'some' meaning but it could be
rephrased to be more simplistic.
It  would help if you could please post the corresponding English text.

It's a shame on me to say this but this is reality: I know it is possible to
mail, blog, etc in Tamil but I haven't made
any attempts until now: for example, how to type in Tamil using a regular
QWERTY keyboard layout? Anyway, that's
my problem and I will fix it.

a cool way is to use iok in fedora (it is now also available in debian). iok 
uses the inscript layout, and you can just click on it in case you forget the 
key for tamil (it also supports all Indian languages.)

As am mailing from workplace, let me put down in English what I understood
from this Tamil translation:

Photocopy those temporary areas marked / meant for pasting selective things
/ items.

To re-write the same in common man's daily English:

Copy (?) / Xerox the temporary places marked for pasting selected items.

What I understand from the translation:
Please copy the packages/files to a temporary directory to install.

For some reason Thunderbird doesn't show tamil text in the message body 
properly, but it does display tamil text in subject and summary correctly.
Any idea?

To me, depending on the context where I would find this sentence, the
english translation varies. Assuming this sentence is in the context of a
directory-file structure in a running operating system, I would translate it
as follows:

"Copy in the temporary space provided for selected files".

what I wanted to mean was:

'copy the selected items into the temporary space for pasting'. I do not know 
where terms like 'photocopy', 'files' and 'directories' came from. The actual 
english that I was trying to translate comes from JOSM and is aimed at the lay 
user. Here it is:
'copy selected objects to paste buffer'. So how would you translate that? If 
you are further interested, you could help correct the language in:

https://translations.launchpad.net/josm/trunk/+pots/keys/ta/+translate?field.alternative_language=ta&field.alternative_language-
empty-marker=1&show=all&start=0

there are nearly 4000 strings, and I have managed about 90 ;-)

????????? can translate to different things in different contexts. I was
considering the context of a directory structure, and hence translated it to
files.

Friends.

One of my friends, need a open source forum for his organization.

I suggested SimpleMachine and phpBB.

He asked for realtime online forums using those apps.

Suggest me some sites which uses simplemachines and phpBB.

Is there any other forum software that we can suggest?

Thanks.

I do not know the language but that's not going to stop me from offering an 
opinion !! :)

Seriously tho', this reminds me of an impressive effort (at least I thought it 
was impressive) to tackle the inconsistency in language translations:

https://fedorahosted.org/fuel/

It ultimately makes sense to 'standardize' on commonly used computing terms 
irrespective of the context (ie: the UI or application) which uses the terms. If 
this discussion is not directly related or relevant to my suggestion, i apologize.

cheers,

There are lot of problems involved in this,

for similar reason that you have mentioned, we opted for a slow pace
with KDE and did not opt for a place for Tamil by default in 4.2 

the complexities are lot. will write more later.

Hai,

My friend Dr. Gnanabharathi working in CLRI, Chennai is travelling to Cologne, Germany to present a paper in INFITT 2009(International Forum for Information Technology in Tamil). He is a handicap and he is informed by the flight authorities (Emirates) that he will be allowed to board only if some one volunteers to take care of him during his journey. He is catching the EK-545 flight on 22.10.2009 at 9.45A.M. 

If any of you or your friends are catching the same flight and willing to volunteer kindly let me know  (9445099343 ) or Dr. Gnanabharathi (9940350290). 

I regret if this post is out of the aims of the respective groups and I have posted as I am left with no other choice. 

Thanks and Regards,
C. Balaji,

Subject: [Ilugc] .a-tip-a-day. (lua programming - Python like scripting
	language [ Part II ])
Message-ID: <7938ae610910211825y69353df1u2829aeb8215dcbb9@mail.gmail.com>

I shall explain these programs line by line.

Before that in case any of you wondered this is how you would run it.

$ lua echosrvr.lua

In another terminal

$ lua echoclnt.lua
hi

will get printed on both sides as the text will be echoed back thro' the UDP
socket.

I hope you guys got that far at least if not any farther. ;)

Let us dissect the program presently.

My comments begin with a <comment> tag.


1) echoclnt.lua
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- UDP sample: echo protocol client
-- LuaSocket sample files
-- Author: Diego Nehab
-- RCS ID: $Id: echoclnt.lua,v 1.10 2005/01/02 22:44:00 diego Exp $
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<comment> All comments in lua start with '--'

local socket = require("socket")

<comment> we import the 'socket' module similar to perl 'use' or python 'import'

host = host or "localhost"
port = port or 1234
if arg then
   host = arg[1] or host
   port = arg[2] or port
end

<comment> The above lines are reasonably straight forward. arg[1] to
arg[n] stand for
 <comment> command line arguments. Also note if then ... end. You also have
 <comment> while do ... end and for do ... end


host = socket.dns.toip(host)
<comment> You get IP from DNS. You can do print(host) and check it
here if you want


udp = assert(socket.udp())
assert(udp:setpeername(host, port))

<comment> You see assert() in action here. If the value is empty
program will exit I think.
<comment> You can also do udp = socket.udp(). You are opening a UDP socket.
<comment> setpeername() is necessary I think in lua. Not sure

print("Using remote host '" ..host.. "' and port " .. port .. "...")

<comment> print() function like C printf or perl print or python
print. Just like python you also
<comment> an interactive interpreter. Just type lua. You also have an
alias for print called '='.
<comment> For example: lua>=3*5 will give 15

while 1 do
       line = io.read()
       if not line or line == "" then os.exit() end
       assert(udp:send(line))
       dgram = assert(udp:receive())
       print(dgram)
end

<comment> While loop in action. io.read() and io.write() will read and
write from/to STDIN/STDOUT.
<comment> Exit on empty line and invoke the send() function of udp table.
<comment>  Then receive...

Now let us move on to the server.

Just copy paste this and use this server with it:

2)echosrvr.lua
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- UDP sample: echo protocol server
-- LuaSocket sample files
-- Author: Diego Nehab
-- RCS ID: $Id: echosrvr.lua,v 1.12 2005/11/22 08:33:29 diego Exp $
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
local socket = require("socket")
host = host or "127.0.0.1"
port = port or 1234
if arg then
   host = arg[1] or host
   port = arg[2] or port
end

<same as above>

print("Binding to host '" ..host.. "' and port " ..port.. "...")
udp = assert(socket.udp())
assert(udp:setsockname(host, port))
assert(udp:settimeout(5))

<comment> In the server you have to bind. You also set a timeout

ip, port = udp:getsockname()

<comment> simultaneous assignment of two values like in perl or python

assert(ip, port)

<comment> Ensuing that both values are defined and usable

print("Waiting packets on " .. ip .. ":" .. port .. "...")

<comment> You give arguments to print() or io.write() using ..
operator. Like %s in C and
<comment> % in python and . in perl.

while 1 do
       dgram, ip, port = udp:receivefrom()
       if dgram then
               print("Echoing '" .. dgram .. "' to " .. ip .. ":" .. port)
               udp:sendto(dgram, ip, port)
       else
       print(ip)
       end
end

<comment> infinite loop. Please note the end placements to signify if
and while closing points

Please ask in case of doubts. This should get you started. Tomorrow we
will examine a lua
 sample to print thumbnails of images. With that lua tutorial will end.;)

If I get time to learn this language properly I shall organize a one
day programme on lua within 2 months.

If you want to sponsor a hall, please mail me or Bharathi in private.

Or you could always use "socat".

A simple "echo" over UDP could be implemented as follows:
 $ socat - UDP:loopback:2000,bind=:2000 

socat is a multipurpose data relay. See
/usr/share/doc/socat/EXAMPLE.gz for more.

By the *nix philosophy socat should have been written at the same
time as named pipes and sockets were created.

Kapil.

Try http://www.linux-ip.net. It is a good site for IP on Linux. What are you
terming as advanced NAT? If you've a set of objectives listed out to
achieve, it will be easier to give pointers. I'm surprised though that you
find netfilter documentation inadequate.

What do you mean by advanced NAT configuration?

What are you trying to achieve?

If you want a good tutorial on NAT technology then I suggest this
article.

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_7-3/anatomy.html

Are  you interested in doing a round robin of NAT source IP from a pool?

I dunno if Linux can do that. OpenBSD can.

Perhaps linux can too now.

Or do you mean DNAT? It is known as port forwarding or redirection.

I used to have slides on all this at sirsasana.org but now that material
is gone.

Message-ID: <7938ae610910212247g2e614e08yc4c63cb234938cb1@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Those of you who read the subject line well might not have to read this post.

I am going to start sending weekly language tutorial mails to
LUG(similar to what I sent today).

In case anyone is wondering, the tips will continue as usual.

I might teach any of the programming languages I know and love.

This includes perl, python, C, lua, javascript.

Of course I shall also deal with shell scripting once in a while.

The idea is to send a small easily digestible pellet every week. I
will time it on a Sunday and probably
send it in the afternoon or evening. That way it will not interfere
with the morning tip mail.

I will take a stab at it and see how it goes.

I may not stick to one language in consecutive weeks. That is
convenient for me and perhaps not a big
hassle to you as well.

Let us see how it goes.

I would suggest you tag these mails appropriately so that those who follow 
them may direct them to a specific folder (and those who are not interested can 
avoid them). Maybe [LANGLESSONS] or something like that.

s/standardize/standardise/, s/apologize/apologise/. Context is everything. In 
my inaugural post on this thread, I mentioned that depending on the context 
there are at least 6 translations in Tamil for the word 'home'. (and none of 
them actually mean 'home'). But consistent translatation in the same context 
is essential. That is one good thing about launchpad - it digs out 
translations from other applications and offers them as suggestions, so the 
pressure to standardise is always there. My beef about tamil translation is 
that there are too many poets around who do not realise that string 
translation is a matter for prose and not poetry.

this is not correct - better to have a crappy translation than no translation 
at all. If the translation is crappy, people can react and correct it. I have 
been planning to do translation 'tomorrow' for a very long time. But tomorrow 
has a habit of never coming. It is only seeing very inaccurate and shoddy 
translations that has irritated me enough to try and do something about it. 
And I am learning a lot of Tamil also - I thought of using ?????? for memory, but 
was diffident about it until Raman produced his jewel. Now I think I can go much 
faster. btw, I have found that the best way of polishing one's knowledge of a 
language is by doing translations. If one tries to understand english and 
translate into Tamil, and one is honest enough to listen to fair criticism one 
can learn both English and Tamil (as you well know, most people who have had 
english medium education are functionally illiterate in their mother tongue).

You can use KBabel to do that as well. It will match already done
translations, and if it finds the same in new .po files, it will
replace it, for consistency.

http://kbabel.kde.org/screenshots.php

IIRC, Tirumurti Vasudevan, Jayaradha N (Red Hat?), and Felix (Red
Hat?) use it regularly for tamil translations for Gnome, to maintain
consistency.

I could not find KBabel in Fedora 11 ;-). The good thing about launchpad is 

1. it is online
2. anyone can translate as much as he feels like. And even if one does not 
feel like doing hard work, one can browse through various translations and 
just select the suggested strings and add them if they are appropriate, thus 
doing the basic work and leaving advanced strings to the experts.

Indeed. There are other online translation toolkits as well. Namely,
Transifex (with Lotte enabled) and, Pootle. Both are extensively used
in several high profile FOSS projects.

Both online and offline tools use elements of translation memory
(searching through file-stores and providing suggestions) fairly
accurately.

KBabel -> KAider -> Lokalize. Please refer:

http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Summer_of_Code/2007/Projects/KAider
http://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize

On Fedora, you can do:

  # yum install kdesdk

that provides lokalize:

will look at that - btw, since you are here could you tell me how to get tamil 
fonts to show in a java app on fedora 11. I have JOSM running but only get 
little boxen when typing tamil - although it shows up properly after upload. I 
presume it is a question of compiling the app with indic support? How does one 
do that with java?

Could you be more specific, rather than "installing linux kernel". Could you
explain in more detail?

You want to upgrade to new kernel release??

What you mean install only kernel?? Because Installing kernel alone
with-out any user mode application is like buying a car engine alone
with-out any other components. It is useless.

If you any specific requirement in mind, Plz specify.

This was just a simple example program to teach a language. Much like
the "Hello World" :P (where echo "Hello, World" would always be enough)

I think the crux of this email was that lua makes it small and simple :)
and how we write Lua scripts.

First of all I am not great at time management.

I took more than 8 months to do the two day networking course.

I am able to achieve something in the technical arena due to my focus and
experience spanning 11 years.

I never learn anything when I have a need to.

I learn pro actively and with focus. I am also a poor public speaker as I
stammer.

But I constantly fight against my weakness and try to come out of my
shortcomings.

I have given several technical talks now. So I am effective at public
speaking despite my stammering problem(though how effective
is debatable).

I also fought my lack of knowledge in the technical domain by constant
 study, practice and application of knowledge and experience.

Once you fall down many times, you never fear the
possibility of falling down. ;)

I think a complete lack of shyness in learning and improving myself
helped in a big way.

Now when it comes to time management, I don't watch movies, television,
cricket or even read the newspaper.

I spend all my time in programming,learning and physical activity. So that
way I have a big advantage compared to others interested in cricket or
movies or girls.

I think time management will automatically come if you are passionate about
something positive.

If  you are passionate about  cricket you will not learn time management.

It has to be something that will help you live a better life in the long run.

Hope this helps.

You don't have to tell me that! I have often used 'sed' where 'tr' or
'cut' would have done the trick. TMTOWTDI as Larry Wall says.

I haven't tried doing that and, I have no idea (the limited knowledge
of java and i18n that I have just indicates that i18n has been one of
the strong points of java for a while) . I could ask around to see if
someone has pointers or, perhaps the JOSM developers could provide

indicates that the storage of the input is happening correctly, as to
why the display/rendering within the application itself does not
happen is something I don't have an idea about.

that is when you learn - you have to finish coding some project before the

I am keen to comment something on this(esp with ref to the last word), but
will not.
But since i alluded to it, you know the context and the hence the comment.

Nope, i am NOT referring to the direct correlation between 'physical
activity' and
how it can be used to impress 'girls' :) ... or probably was I? :D

'physical activities' for promoting FOSS is on topic here, but for impressing girls it is totally offtopic. Please stop.

Thanks, Raman. I'm sure the thread would've grown out-of-control if not for
the stop.

I've a few responses to the various comments on this thread, but I'd rather
adhere to mailing list protocol, consider this OT and bite my tongue.

I think you want to upgrade to a new kernel. Until you don't upgrade
from very old kernel to the latest, then you won't have any problems.

Upgrading form 2.6.x.y to 2.6.30.x would be fine.
There are only four steps (simple ;-))

1. Extract the source tree somewhere
2. give make old-config and accept the defaults if it asks anything more
(this is not bad, but if you know what you are doing then you can change
the options)
3. give make
4. sudo make install (or su - and then make install)

reboot and select your new kernel. (default selection will be the old
kernel unless you had changed in the grub file)

<comment> More comments
<comment> We start a function called thumbnail with 3 arguments
imagein, imageout and maxsize
<comment> Like all scripting languages we care two hoots about
datatypes. lua is weakly typed.

<comment> another comment and then we have the same construct we saw yesterday
<comment> local maxsize = maxsize or 200 is set to a default value of
200 in case overridden explicitly
<comment> local imageout = imageout or "thumb-" .. imagein is
interesting. We construct the
<comment> the output file name by concatenating "thumb-" string with
the imagein variable. Hence the
<comment> the output you see above.

<comment> local im = (imagein:match('%.jpe?g$') and
gd.createFromJpeg(imagein) or ...

<comment> the entire block does a pattern match on the image string
variable and invokes the appropriate
<comment> gd command to read from png, jpg or gif formats into gd's
internal buffer.


-- getting the size right
        local x,y = im:sizeXY()
        local tx = y > x and x/y*maxsize or maxsize
        local ty = x > y and y/x*maxsize or maxsize


<comment> We are doing some processing now. local x,y = im:sizeXY()
<comment> im now contains gd's internal representation of the image,
note the above
<comment> command in the previous block.

<comment> this line assigns two variables x and y to values returned
by the sizeXY() function
<comment> in the gd module. You can assign two or more variables
simultaneously unlike C.

<comment> local tx = y > x and x/y*maxsize or maxsize and the next
line obtains the thumbnail
<comment> X and Y values for scaling down. You could instead have used
the value of 200 pixels
<comment> for both X and Y. This math is done to ensure that we don't
exceed the thumbnail size
<comment> as x/y when y is greater than x will be a value less than 1
and multiplying by it will
<comment> will give us a lower value than maxsize = 200. Anyway we are
digressing..

        local tn = gd.createTrueColor(tx,ty)
        gd.copyResampled(tn,im,0,0,0,0,tx,ty,x,y)

<comment> local tn = gd.createTrueColor(tx,ty)
<comment> What does it do? God alone knows. I guess it creates a new
image in tn variable with
<comment> scaled height and width(X and Y values).

<comment> gd.copyResampled(tn,im,0,0,0,0,tx,ty,x,y)

tn is the sampled image and

<comment> documentation. I am sure we will have equivalent commands in
C or other bindings.

<comment> if tn:jpeg(imageout,75) Ah. I understand this one. The
output is always a JPEG image with
 <comments> quality 75 even if the input is gif or png. This command
prints the image to the imageout

      else return nil end

<comments> Otherwise return null and end of function.

end

<comment> This is cool stuff. We are checking for the command line
arguments stored in arg[1] to arg[n].
<comment> You are doing a pattern match against 'nil' in if (arg ~=
nil) to ensure that an at least one argument
<comment> is given.

<comment> Then for n,i in ipairs(arg) do will assign the array index
to n and array value to i
<comment> print(thumbnail(i)) prints the filename of the thumbnail to
STDOUT. If you remove the print
<comment> and say thumbnail(i) , then the thumbnails will be created
silently without printing
<comment> anything to STDOUT.

Phew! This was too much. Right?

Message-ID: <7938ae610910222200ida0dce9j2b514a8f3c18d271@mail.gmail.com>

I have captured KG's idea of using [ LANGUAGETIP] as subject for
filtering. Also you can filter on
.a-language-tip-a-week. similar to .a-tip-a-day.

And I shall mention the language name like this: [ LANGUAGETIP -
Python] or [LANGUAGETIP - Perl ] or
[ LANGUAGETIP - C] or [ LANGUAGETIP - lua].

This mail is not the weekly tip. I wish to clear the air before we
start. Some basic concepts in a brief bullet form:

         o Scripting languages are weakly typed. C is strongly typed.
Most scripting languages treat everything as string.

         o Scripting languages allow swapping and simultaneous
assignment. x,y = 1,2 and x,y = y,x to swap values.

         o Certain languages like javascript and lua allow strings to
be used as function names and actually call them. We
            call such functions as being first class objects.

         o Object oriented programming is a breeze in scripting
languages. Not the design pattern, polymorphism bullshit
            that companies, trainers and C++ programmers bullshit you about ;)

         o C programming needs a lot of care and domain knowledge.
Your ignorance will surely bite you unlike all the
             other languages we discuss. So please learn C with
diligent effort and understand what you are doing.Completely.

         o Here is a great lua reference:

            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)

And you have an online book on lua here:

http://www.lua.org/pil/

I shall be conducting a one day lua course in the next month or so
after discussing with Bharathi. Please come
prepared.

Hi again,
             I have my own mobile hardware on which google android mobile os
has to be installed. Google android os is a mobile os which is built on
linux kernel.

http://www.techflare.com.au/media/102-android%20-%20system-architecture.jpg

this link gives you the architecture.


I have a processor with ARM11 architecture, I have to port linux  kernel so
that I can build entire mobile os
on top of it.It is absolutly waste of memory and speed to me if I port
entire operating system with applications.


Second thing can suggest me the oldest linux distribution which works only
on terminal and having a very few applications
would be very helpful.


Thanks and regards

I do not know about Lua, but in the case of Javascript I think you mean
functions can be assigned to variables and passed around like other
variables (hence the name first class objects) and when its time to invoke
it append a '()' at the end of the variable! Strictly speaking you cannot
use a 'string' as referring to a function. Perhaps object['string'] but not
'string'.

Well then js is the only scripting language that does not allow that. ;)

Can you clear me what you want to do exactly.
You want to port the customized Linux kernel on top of your ARM 11 board and
later add Android with Linux kernel?. Or what else?.
Proivde me your hardware details too.

If you are looking for small footprint linux, look up the list in lwn.net[1].
Look up busybox[2] for a useful tool.

I think this is another too generic statement which is not exactly
correct. E.g, Python is a strongly typed language [1]. Also, there are
many references where people claim C is a weakly typed language.
Perhaps differentiating them in terms of static and dynamic typing
will be little more appropriate.

This is pretty dated, but it may give you a starting point as to what to
do next. This is about cross compiling for ARM 11.

http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/misc/66149-gnu-crosscompiler-tools-arm11.html

By the way, Linux has already been ported over to ARM 11. Android 1.5 runs
on this quite well.
http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/Shenzen-State-Micro-Technology/

As stated by another poster earlier, it would be a good idea to install
busybox on the hardware first. It will simplify the software setup of the
device considerably.

Debugging for the ARM platform:
http://www.dspdesignline.com/howto/218101448

By the way, Slackware does have an ARM port - but please note that I have
never tried it. Neither have I tried Debian's port.

Prem

I like your signature more than your mail. ;)

Anyway I think you are wrong.

Obviously I don't want to get into an argument.

C is strongly typed. You cannot use any variable without declaring in advance.

All scripting languages...by that I mean *all* scripting languages
allow dynamic
typing and weak typing.

This is a key point that everyone has to understand.

Sorry for the digression. Wanted to share with you and rest of the group
an(other) online English-Tamil dictionary.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of ambiguity in the term "strong/weak typing".
The definition that any language that disallows use of a variable without
declaring it first is a strongly typed language is just one of the many
definitions given for a "strongly typed language". Another feature commonly
cited for a language to qualify as a strongly typed language is that the
language should disallow all kinds of type conversion, either explicit or
implicit. Taking this feature into consideration, one can say that C is
weakly typed. So, as Sahid said, instead of using "strong/weak typing" to
classify languages, one could use well-defined terms such as "static/dynamic
typing" and "type safety" for the purpose. Using strong/weak typing will
only lead to arguments as there is not one universally accepted definition.
The following wikipedia link gives the various factors that are used to
qualify a language as strongly typed:

Declaring variable does not make a language strongly typed. That is
just a property of static typing.

Not sure, if you have gone through the link I had sent. That does tell
some reasons why Python is a strongly typed language. I think it's
important to understand what it means by strong and weak typing. In
short, strongly typed language prevents any operations for which
arguments are of wrong type whereas weakly typed language will modify
the type of the arguments to execute such operation successfully.
Consider the following example:

x = "23" + 4;

Strongly typed language will throw an exception but weakly typed
language will implicitly modify the type of one argument. Like,
javascript interprets this as "234".

Hello,

Making an assertion of intent like this:

What do you mean by a scripting language? Is C a scripting language?
You may be aware of CSL <http://csl.sf.net/>?

The key point to understand is that _everyone_ has their own language
biases^Wpreferences.

Since your intent is to educate us about Lua (or other languages) it
is probably most practical to:

 a. Give some examples of how useful programs are written in Lua (you
 have already done this ... so thanks!).

 b. Provided "counter"-examples of how such programs are written in
 other languages which illustrate differences from the Lua way of
 encoding the algorithm.

Let us worry about terminology and epithets afterwards.

Kapil.

the actual tip should be in another square bracket: [LANGUAGETIP][Perl]. that 
way we can focus on what we are interested in. btw, it is not my idea - 
linuxchix lists used to use this tagging extensively so that people could 
focus on that they were interested in.

If you have a tamil language translation file with the content in the format:

s2=\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f

etc, please do let me know. I can try it and let you know.

The locale for tamil is ta_IN. Is that what you are using?

Also, have you seen this?

my question is: I have indic enabled/installed on my kde desktop. so when I 
type in any application, I see tamil/kannada etc. But when I type in josm, 
which is run from a precompiled jar file, I only see boxes, and no font. So how 
does one enable the locale? does one compile the JRE with indic support? and 
if so how? or does one compile the jar file with indic support? and if so how?

in the geographical context 'primitive' refers to an object that cannot be

the thread says precisely what I said in my post - indic in JOSM appears as 
small boxes. So how does pointing to the thread help the discussion? or give a 
solution?

Message-ID: <7938ae610910232100oc13ebe2k16a1c0a393b0f05f@mail.gmail.com>

If you capture video with the mobile phone or a handicam and if the
video is in landscape mode
and you wish to convert into portrait mode or vice versa the mencoder
program in mplayer project
can help.

Nowadays you have mplayer only installs but mencoder should be there
if you install the mplayer package.

This command can do the trick.

$ mencoder -vf rotate=1 video.mpg -out out.mpg -oac copy -ovc lavc

rotate=0,1,2,3 can be used for rotatating 90 degrees clockwise,
anticlockwise, flipping 180 degrees and so on.

Try it out.

It can be very useful. In case the video is not mpg say it is avi,flv
or whatever just subjstitute mpg with the appropriate
extension in output. The "-ovc lavc" switch is important.

Hi

I am in a necessity to get my "todo" list organized and structured. Can
anyone suggest a good tool to do the same? I have tried gtodo but did not
impress me much. I need a tool with a good notification system i.e

Let me first confess that Tamil is the language I'm least proficient in 
despite it being my mother tongue. I'm not schooled in it either.

I believe download means to "bring here" rather than "bring down". Would 
right word be "inge konduvara"?

one of the purposes of this thread is to make Indians ashamed of being 
illiterate in their mother tongue and use the ample available facilities of 
the internet to rectify this defect. (and do not be too despondent, my mother 
tongue is Konkani, and I am very poor in it)

no - it means bring down (implies that the internet is somewhere 'up there')

Ethai inge podonama? :)

Colloquial yes, and I know that is similar to "Should this be placed here?".

If we aren't able to give you the translation in Tamil, perhaps we can
volunteer the text transliterated into English? That way, some more of us
may be able to participate.

Out of curiosity, what is "file" in Tamil? I would appreciate the answer
transliterated into English, if you don't mind. Also, would anyone have an
issue with using "file" itself as the word in Tamil?

English has absorbed a number of words from other languages - so it may be
better if the Indian languages absorbed many of the computer terms
directly from English.

Example: Byte, bit, computer, file, folder, directory, mouse, keyboard,
disc, trackpad, plug, USB, laptop, internet, network, switch, bus etc..
but these could be transliterated into Tamil instead of being written in
English.

I think that would allow an Indian language speaker to directly relate to
terms which are now ubiquitous across the world without having to invent
an absolutely bizarre sounding term (example for a network, computer etc)
because of some vain desire to remain linguistically "pure"

Also, it would allow for different indian languages to share some of the
same terms instead of adding to confusion.

I am not sure if these common terms are already transliterated in Indian
languages - if they are, please pardon me.

Thoughts?

Regards,
Prem

Yes, I did see that as well. But I was able to get Tamil to display within
a Java swing app. But this was on Windows not Linux.

It was actually pretty straightforward - just put a unicode tamil font in
the windows\font folder and be sure to select this font in the java app.
The unicode tamil characters display without any problems.

Prem

depends on what problem you are trying to solve. A person who understands all 
these terms is going to use english interface anyway. I recall reading a 
wikipedia entry in Hindi and came to the conclusion that only a person who 
knows English will understand it. The problem I am trying to solve is that a 
person who knows no English should be able to understand what is written. This 
is especially important for the user interface of applications that the common 
man uses - as far as the computer professional is concerned, one can coin 
esoteric words which he will have to master.

unfortunately we also have to live with the fact that Tamil (and French) are 
two languages where the desire to remain linguistically "pure" is very strong.

a lot of them have been translated, but there is a lack of uniformity.

Nice. What would be the singular for '??????????'? Because it specifically
mentions '???????', I think singular would be better.

I was able to type in Tamil in Freemind - a java app, by selecting a Tamil 
font. I see in preferences that JOSM has a choice of language - but no indian 
language is there. I am translating JOSM to Tamil in the hope that when it is 
done, JOSM will be recompiled to support Tamil. There is no dialogue box to 
choose the font just now.

I downloaded the latest version of TBird 3beta4 and began using it. I 
found something I'd not seen earlier. In the threaded collapsed view, 
when the cursor is taken to a thread, the complete thread is seen with 
additions only under the sender's name. Gives a nice synopsis like GMail 
for mails with single para replies. It completely disregards the inline 
quoting making one see the whole mail to make sense. A nice start, however.

I've changed the chrome to change back/ foreground colour. That reflects 
only in the individual mails but not the synopsis. Google did not throw 
up any pointers.

Anyone who has tried this?

Following the event conducted on Tuesday, today We
conducted a session emphasizing the importance of Free Software for
Schools at a meet Organized by Science City for the Headmasters &
Correspondents of Diocesan Schools of Chennai of Church of South India.

We elaborated them the importance of Free Software at schools to keep the
sharing spirit alive, the cost factors, various tools available for
various subjects, IT@school project of Kerala Government etc.,

Participants felt the session was an eye opener for them. 

We thank Science City for providing us with this opportunity.

I see your point. However, the reality is that those who are going to be
using a computer will at some point or the other have to invent new words
for disk, internet and so on because there are no words for this in
Tamil/any other indian language. The other reality is that people are
actually far more flexible than we think and are quite willing to use
terms which are not native to the language - a crude example: we don't
have equivalent terms in Tamil for "Tandoori Chicken" but pretty much
anyone will understand what it means.. other examples: how many tamilians
actually use the Tamil equivalent for bus, cycle, computer etc?

That is true. But yet, like I stated earlier, the common man on the street
is quite willing to borrow words from other languages. Some arm chair
pundits and others with parochial ambitions/thoughts will object, but the
average person on the street is far more pragmatic.

these are arguments like how many users use linux etc., 

despite the reality that many/ most computer users are windozed we work
towards proliferation of free software..

we do not accept the reality, rather we work for a change..

the same hold good for languages too..

Tamil does allow borrowing words since ancient times. Exchange of words
between Tamil & Sanskrit are standing examples..

Tirumandiram is oldest available text with ample examples.. But there
are conventions even for that..

I thought your point is that such words should _not_ be invented and
the existing English words used instead. This is a sentiment that I
wholly support. A language often borrows word from other languages for
concepts that it is borrowing.

Later on as new concepts (about computers) are invented by people
who speak Tamil (or other Indian languages) they will use concepts
from these languages to make words for these new inventions and we
will be only too happy to see these words entering languages like
English. After all "dosa", "chutney" and "tikka" are now considered
English words.

Kapil.

A few years back, the following 'dialogue' (recount of conversations heard
on the street) appeared in the Tamil magazine, 'Junior Vikatan':

person 1: 'Ayya, ungalukku  tholaipesi azhaippu vandhirukiradhu'
person 2: 'Appadina?'
person 1: 'Phone vandhirukkunnu sonnen'
person 2: 'Appadi Tamilla sonnathaana puriyum'

Tamil is what people on the street speak. Not what scholars decree.

I think the focus of this discussion is to translate english words to tamil
so the ordinary folks find computers easy to use. If it is also intended to
spread the use of tamil, neither objective will be achieved!!

If the "change" you are working for is to make the common man understand and
appreciate pure tamil, and hence use tamil the way purists use, then I am
afraid the way you are trying to bring about the change has some problems!
It is also totally unnecessary and meaningless to impose such difficulties
all of a sudden on the common man in the name of developing pure tamil,
given the current scenario in the tamil-speaking community.

Pure tamil is primarily for purists, poets and tamil enthusiasts, just as
pure mathematics is for mathematicians and math enthusiasts! I don't mean to
say that work on purifying tamil itself is a waste! Of course it should be
done, and new tamil words for english words that currently don't have a
tamil equivalent should be coined based on the rules provided, but all these
should not be imposed on someone who is already comfortable with a
modified/colloquial/dialect-of tamil, and who will definitely struggle if
presented with a text on pure tamil.  Language is something that is best
grasped by a human being when he/she is a child. Today, the situation is
such that, even some tamil medium students don't understand many words in
pure tamil after their schooling. And what about people who have their
mother tongue as tamil, but have had an english medium education? The
reality of the situation today is that there are very few people who are
purists, and a vast majority who just cannot care less!

As far as tamil web pages are concerned, a web page can give options such as
whether a user would like a pure tamil version or a tamil version that the
common man of today can understand. Developing a community of tamil-speaking
people who understand and/or use pure tamil, if at all it is possible, can
only be done very gradually, and depends on a lot of factors! Many aspects
in a person's life affects the kind of language he/she comfortably speaks,
and most of the important aspects are based on the cultural/social
environment in which the person grows up as a child, and things like
changing the way a tamil web page is presented to the reader are not of much
help if the major factors remain unchanged!

And, of course, a similar argument holds for linux also!

Vinod.

there is nothing as such as pure Tamil. If one doesn't understand a
Tamil word, he is lacking skills on Tamil, the ways to rectify it is to
refer to a Tamil dictionary.

translation is done for people who lack English skills. Say
Virtualization. It will take time for such people to understand what the
word Virtual means and then later its meaning.

But if it is represented to him as ??????????? - the word ???????? in
Tamil refers to ???????? ???????? ???? ?????????, he understands it even
better.

thats the whole purpose of translation. hope that makes sense, we will
maintain Linux as Linux etc., No worries..

Where there is no alternative (there will be certainly be cases of that
kind), we can take up the word itself converting it phonetically, just
like ??????????????? becomes Triplicane in English.

It will give bc(1) or any other tool a run for the money.

Here is a sample session.

$ wcalc
-> ?

sin cos tan cot asin acos atan acot
sinh cosh tanh coth asinh acosh atanh acoth
log ln logtwo round abs ceil floor sqrt cbrt comp
Gamma lnGamma zeta sinc

-> sin 60
 = 0.866025
-> cos 90
 = 0
-> tan 45
 = 1
-> sqrt(123234)
 = 351.047
-> log(e)
 = 0.434294
-> log(2.71828)
 = 0.434294
-> ln(e)
= 1

There is also a non interactive mode.

$ wcalc 'sin 90'
 = 1

which you can use in shell scripts.

Inspired by this e-mail I installed wcalc. It _is_ a truly useful
tool for those looking for a replacement for a desktop calculator.

> It will give bc(1) or any other tool a run for the money.

However, this is false! The reason is that "bc" is a _programmable_
calculator. You can define functions in "bc". As far as I could tell,
"wcalc" is missing this.

I meant, by pure tamil, ?????????, along with words in tamil not commonly
spoken by the common man. So, there is such a thing as pure tamil.

If a person who lacks English skills has to refer a tamil dictionary to
understand tamil words, he/she may as well go for an English dictionary! I
am talking about people who understand tamil, but certain words they use
cannot be considered as proper tamil, and yet they consider it as the tamil
they know and are familiar with. In that case, using words that they know,
and not words of proper tamil, will make it easier for them to read. Making
these people go for a tamil dictionary for every word they do not
understand(and if such words are used in abundance), then it is not
user-friendly and will discourage such users from reading the web page. And,
like I said before, the proper tamil version can be given as an option for
people who really understand such words!

Yes, I agree with this totally, but then I hope you also understand that I
am talking about the situation where a person has knowledge of a
not-so-proper tamil word, but not the proper tamil equivalent. In that case,
using the proper tamil word will not help him understand any better than if
the corresponding english word were used. He either has to go for an english
or tamil dictionary, which would defeat the whole purpose of the
translation! Using the not-so-proper tamil word here is definitely more
helpful.

Moreover in both OS they used POSIX 1000.1C standard. So its easy to migrate
your threads programs. But they mentioned that in solaris, they used some
proprietary APIs for some special purpose. So you should take care only for
this APIs.

No, you can define functions in wcalc as well.

Check out. I clearly saw that in the man page as well as the online help.

Okay. I have to backtrack here.

The rich set of inbuilt functions can surely give bc(1) hang its head
in shame and make it irrelevant.

But I wonder why wcalc does not have a lex yacc parser for defining user
functions.

Well well.

I am no mathematician. Obviously you should be right.

This tool is meant for people like you.

We will take a look at the randtype(1) utility's source code. It is an
amazing tool and I have
always been amazed by it. This is also the first OpenBSD port I developed.

$ randtype /etc/passwd

will type out the file as though a user were entering characters on
the keyboard.

You can see the source here.

http://gayatri-hitech.com/languageclasses/randtype.c.html

I will explain the juicy parts. If I explain everything you guys will
start deleting
my mails as it will be too long and untenable. I don't want that obviously.

Also before I start I wish to mention that the smart Debian
users(people who are good enough to use
raw Debian instead of *buntu or whatever) can obtain the source code
of a program by this command as
a user.

$ apt-get source randtype

or even

$ apt-get source wcalc

which is what I did this morning. ;)

Now let us take the juicy parts of the file randtype.c

static char chk_special(const char *str, char c)
{
    register char i;

    while ((i = *str++)) {
        if (i == '\\' && *str) {
            switch (i = *str++) {
              case 'a':
                i = '\007';
                break;
              case 'b':
                i = '\b';
                break;
              case 'f':

This function is typical of C string handling code. In C, the most
painful aspect is the care with
which you have to handle characters in a string. There are no
convenient string functions like in
other languages.

You have to do everything by hand. You of course have many string
functions like strchr(), strrchr(),
strpbrk(), strtrok(), strsep() and of course strcmp(), strcasecmp().

But despite all this, you don't have functions like in Python which
make it very easy to process strings.

Anyway the above function iterates thro' the characters in a string
and breaks out of the while() loop when
the character c in the argument  matches character pointed to by i in
the string. The line

            switch (i = *str++) {

is the loop iterator command which moves the i variable to point to
the successive characters in a string.

As I have said before, the only way to master C is by looking at other
people's code. And I have made most
of my money by working and improving on top of other people's code.
(including my present work)

Anyway now let us look at one more function before we wind up for this week.

static void randsleep(float ms, unsigned int mult)
{
    static struct timeval tv;
    long i;

#ifdef HAVE_RANDOM
    i = (1 + (int) (ms * random() / (RAND_MAX + 1.0))) * mult;
#else
    i = (1 + (int) (ms * rand() / (RAND_MAX + 1.0))) * mult;
#endif

    /* FreeBSD likes one less */
    if (i > 999999L) {
        tv.tv_sec = i / 1000000;
        tv.tv_usec = i % 1000000;
    }
    else
        tv.tv_usec = i;

    /* select() is unbelievably more efficient than usleep(). */
    select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, &tv);

    return;
}

There are two things that are illustrated in the above code.

        a) select(2) is better for timeouts and sleeping than anything else.
        b) You also need to know how to manipulate struct timeval fields.

There are other time() data structures like time_t, struct tm and so
on that you may wish to learn.

Hi Girish,

Nothing related to the post, but can you post your tips with a tag like 
[ATAK] and/or [ALangTAK] so that it is easier to filter or browse 
through. We had one such earlier for One Day One Command [ODOC] from 
Bharathi.

The reason I wanted to avoid square brackets was to allow the traditional list
semantics to continue as it is. Already [ilugc] comes as a subject prefix.

I will have only one square bracket like this.

[ LANGUAGETIP - C ] in the beginning.

I shall stick to this then.

I sometimes wonder why you really need to voice such strong opinions,
as "hang its head in shame"... it does make me smile though! :-)

As for bc's defense, bc -l on GNU bc does provide a fair set of useful
functions predefined. That apart, bc conforms to the POSIX draft
standard, so it conforms to a predefined (old) standard, which is one
of the reasons it doesn't do too much, but works well at what it is
supposed to do...

Thanks for your tips. I find them useful.

We do help such by providing glossary at the end of an essay/ book or by
giving the equivalent word in brackets when that incurs for the first
time in a given essay or book.

Yes, something like that is what I would also recommend. If it is being

Tt also depends on how much one uses Tamil in day-to-day life. 

That certainly makes difference. A Tamil Teacher/ Tamil Medium Teacher
is a common man & people whom you refer is also a common. I do consider
myself a common man & I do see the difference.

Taminadu people uses ?????????????? for using while Lankan Tamils
use ?????????. Those who use it there and here are all common men &
women.

????????? is a strange word that seldom conveys something at the outset
to a Common Man here in Tamilnadu.

it goes on..

Yes, common man's tamil varies a lot! But pure tamil is not common man's
tamil! What the lankans speak is their own modification of pure tamil. Same
goes with malayalam, telugu and kannadam, which are all, to varying degrees,
derived from pure tamil and other old languages such as sanskrit. Pure tamil
is what the scholars have developed over the years, and what is called
classical tamil. And that is unique!

I think the subject is self explanatory.

I am going to talk about two options of gcc.

-Wall is for warnings. Your code should compile without any warnings.
Throw away useless variables
 or comment them out and do appropriate typecasting when you have
const char * and char * and similar.

-g is for generating debug symbols so you can use the executable with gdb(1).

I don't think I need to talk more than this.

If you do a file a.out or file foo where foo is the executable, it should say
"Not stripped". Otherwise gdb will not be able to help you much.

That is ensured by -g. Also the command strip(1) will remove debug symbols.

The other thing you can do to figure out why some symbols don't
resolve is nm(1).

It is too much for a tip. ;)

That is right. I don't necessarily believe that NO words should be
invented but there are a number of very frequently used words (internet,
disk etc) which can be used as is - that is, we can continue to use the
English terms but transliterated phonetically into the
Tamil/Malayalam/Hindi whatever language.

There may be other words which aren't this frequently used which may be
better understood if it is *translated* into regional languages rather
than transliterated.

That is right. It also keeps the language dynamic and flexible. As more
people use a language, it will necessarily need to expand - both in terms
of vocabulary as well as in terms of different types of usage.

If completely new terms are to be invented in Tamil each time a new word
appears in English, then we will have a situation where even a Tamil
speaker cannot understand the word.

Also, this whole mindset that a language is diminished in some way if it
directly absorbs words (even proper nouns) from other languages is not
right and the extent to which some people go to translate words from other
languages is absurd.

Let me illustrate with an example in the opposite direction - the dish
"iddy appam" is sometimes referred to as "thunder cakes" by Anglo-Indians.
I have also heard it referred to as "Rice fritters" (or something
similar).

Thunder cakes is a direct translation word to word without considering
context - iddy is the same term used for thunder but in this case iddy is
also the malayalam word for pounding using a pestle. Iddy appam refers to
the cake made using rice pounded on a pestle. Cake is a direct translation
of "appam".

Rice fritters is a better translation but it is more of a redefinition of
the term - similar to saying oven-cooked-spicy-chicken as the word for
Tandoori Chicken. The problem with these types of translation is that it
does not take into consideration that "iddy appam" is actually a proper
noun. It would be absurd if my name (Prem) is translated as "love" by
someone abroad.

So while we do the translation, it would also be good to keep in mind that
proper nouns cannot be translated - they have to be transliterated.

Example: When I was young, we used to refer to trains as "Thee vandi" (in
Malayalam). Here "thee" means fire and "vandi" means vehicle. It made more
sense when we had steam engines - but now with electric trains becoming
the norm, this translation does not make much sense anymore.

That is the problem with translating names using detailed descriptions -
if I come up with a term for a bus in tamil/malayalam (example:
6-wheeled-people-carrying-big-vandi) and have a long winded name which is
actually a description of the bus, then it will quickly become outdated as
the technology changes. Also, long winded names are difficult to use and
will get truncated in common usage very quickly.. or not get used at all.

Also, even the English word "train" itself isn't a description of the
vehicle. At best, the word train only refers to the fact that multiple
compartments "train" each other.

If instead of using the tamil translation of
6-wheeled-people-carrying-big-vandi, I come up with a new shorter word in
tamil - example: buvandi :) (or something like that), then even tamilians
won't know what the devil I am referring to if I say I am going in a
buvandi.. then I will have to go to the trouble of expanding the tamil
dictionary to say buvandi = 6-wheeled-people-carrying-big-vandi = bus. The
common man would want to know why I didn't say bus in the first place
instead of confusing them. :)

So my suggestion is that we just use some of the more frequently used
words in English instead of:

a) Coming with long winded descriptive words in tamil/malayalam/whatever
which will quickly get outdated, be too verbose for common usage and will
therefore not be used

or

b) Invent new words which people won't recognize anyway.

That is right.

I have faced it sometimes that I need to give backtrace for certain
files that have segfaulted. In that case, I needed to run it through
gdb. But, to get any useful information it had to be compiled with
debug symbols enabled.

In RPM based distributions, the build system generally creates a
separate debug/debuginfo package that you can install to get the debug
symbols rather than recompile anything. For example, in Fedora, you can
just do

# debuginfo-install foo

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/StackTraces

Debian and derivates don't do this yet but apparently a major goal for
the next release.

Message-ID: <4AE5A1B1.4090906@fedoraproject.org>

Hi

http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=fedora_r600_3d&num=1

"Fedora 12 provides "out of the box" support for kernel mode-setting
with ATI R600/700 series graphics hardware, but it does not provide 3D
acceleration by default. However, Red Hat's X developers have made it
very easy to enable this 3D support for the ATI Radeon HD 2000, 3000,
and 4000 series hardware by just installing a special Mesa package from yum"

You have to get your e-mail quoting right while replying. ;)

Anyway don't get too worried about my language.

All I mean is that if you don't compile the code with
 the -g option, you cannot debug your program with gdb
debugger.

When you run gdb you want to see this.

gdb a.out
(gdb)l or list
< A bunch of C source lines here>

If that doesn't work you cannot debug. ;)

Is it clear now?

Until this goal is reached ... you can do the following.

 # apt-get build-dep pkgname
 $ apt-get source pkgname
 $ cd pkgname-version
 $ DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nostrip dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -B

This will create a debug package that you can install and run
to get a stacktrace. (Warning: this debug package will overwrite your
existing package unless you make some other changes. However, you can
revert to your existing package with 'aptitude reinstall pkgname').

Kapil.

Message-ID: <7938ae610910261643k2325f6c4h3edad8e88b307729@mail.gmail.com>

I don't want to give tutorials as part of tips but some of you may like it.

I want to teach make(1), the program to build source code.

make knows only directories. It looks for a file called Makefile or
makefile or whatever. In all cases
I have seen only Makefile.

A bunch of rules are organized like this:

target : source dependencies ...

Some rules have a method to tell make how to create target from the source.

A good example is this one:

foo: foo.c
<TAB> $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@

If this is too much for you, how about this?

foo : foo.c
<TAB> gcc -lm foo.c -o foo

Both are same. Except that in the former you need to define variables
like this usually done at the top of the
Makefile.

CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-lm

$@ gets assigned to the right side of the ':' of the rule, the source
files or dependencies.

And $< is the target specification.

Make always needs a TAB character to begin the actions after a
dependency specification.

It is a deep topic and I will wind up this session with a mention of
the .PHONY pseudo rule.

You say,

.PHONY: clean all

in the Makefile to indicate that the rules "clean" and "all" are not
real targets. They don't correspond to
files on the file system but names for rules.

This is to avoid collision when you actually have filenames by that name.

Usually you don't and it is good to know what this means at least for
curiosity's sake when you read
other people's Makefiles.

????/???????  is more appropriate as ?????  generally implies protect/secure than savings.

actually in the computer context, the word 'save' actually means 'store in 
some permament form' whereas to my ear ???? means to save up (as in money).

The apt-get source command can be run even in " *buntu " systems. All that
has to be done is to enable, download source option in software sources

Hi All,

In the recent days, this thread is getting more attention. Already few
lists are running for this purpose alone. So, it is more appropriate
to move this discussion to thous list.

Amachu, Plz give the detail of the lists related to KDE and GNOME
tamil translations. So that, interested people can join and work
togather in this task.

Bye :)

I do not agree - it is clearly marked so that people who do not want to read 
it may not do so. I note that the responses of people are from those who are 
not actively involved with translation, but are happy to help out with hints. 
So I do not see that any purpose will be served by moving to some other list.

Sorry for not able to clearly mention my requirement. Actually I want to do
this for my niece who is a singer and who wants to
practice some songs. So what I think needed is mp3 file file to create a
minus one track ( I hope)

Please suggest me something which will do the needful as I don't have much
knowledge in this.

Thanks for everything.

'?????', even if its already in use has to be discouraged. As others have
pointed out earlier its misleading.

I think it would make more sense to have these words put up on

As I read through this and then visited whitehouse.gov (which looks pretty slick 
btw), I wondered what powers our own Government websites. A quick google gave me 
this listing:

http://goidirectory.nic.in/welcome.asp

...and I cringed a bit on visiting each of those websites. Why do our government 
websites look like something created in the early '90s by a teenager who just 
learned to code html ? ...complete with the Indian tricolor as bullet icons and 
the <blink> tag ??

http://presidentofindia.nic.in/

...or why do we have the disclaimer "Best viewed with IE 5 & above 800x600 
resolution" ...

http://pmindia.nic.in/

Seriously ! This is depressing. Bad web site design, IMHO, is even sadder than 
the possibility that it runs on proprietary software.

I wondered if someone (possibly someone in the media ?) could use the 
whitehouse.gov news to ask questions about what process governs the sad quality 
of our government websites ?

Anyways, after venting a bit I decided to explore as much as possible myself and 
came across this ...
http://indiaimage.nic.in/

Which ...
"""
...is a popular programme of NIC with an objective to facilitate the 
establishment of a firm presence of Indian Government entities on the World Wide 
Web.
"""

...and has a nice big banner directing one to the "Guidelines for Indian 
Government Websites" which purports to ....

"""
...ensure that Indian Government websites, belonging to any constituent of the 
Government, at any level, are citizen centric and visitor friendly.
"""

Well, to obtain the guidelines, one has to register with the site. I did(*), and 
I am still waiting for my login to be activated.

So, to summarize, we do have a set of guidelines, which are at least in theory 
available on registration with the associated website. However, inspite of that 
NIC still thinks the <blink> tag is a good idea !
<sarcasm> Mera Bharath Mahan !</sarcasm>

Seriously though, is there a way to channelize this disappointment in a 
constructive manner(+) ? Comments/ideas/opinions ?

cheers,
- steve

(*) ...and also was amused in the process by options for the 'secret question' 
:) ...worth a look !!

(+) Look at my reply to the other thread "Re: [Ilugc] Downloading frame based 
sites with wget" ...to understand why I am in a foul mood today ! How the f*** 
does someone effect change without having to make a full time profession out of it ?

I did it the very same day but sadly, I haven't received a reply, yet ! So, what 
should I make of this ?

Anyways, I am posting this here so that I have something to point out to when 
people to think i am overly cynical or just a armchair protester when it comes

having a website itself is a great thing as of now. things will change over
a period of time. probably 1-2 decades i guess.

Having website is itself big achievement for us. lets not talk about whether
its proprietary or open source. our government should upgrade to latest
technology (whether proprietory or foss) atleast to serve people better.

For java applications, I'd suggest either GlassFish (3 is really good,
am using the preview now) or Apache Tomcat 6. They work very well with
MySQL, provided you have the correct JDBC driver installed. I've been
working on this platform on Fedora 11 for 4 months now, and Slackware
13 for a week now. Runs without a hitch on both setups.

Actually, considering that the NIC has been around since 1976[1] (yes, you read 
that right -- 1976 !! that's before I was born), No, is *not* a great 
achievement for us to have such shoddy websites. It is utterly shameful ! I 
resent the 'chalta hai' attitude that we Indians seem to have.

I'm not quite sure what you are trying to imply here. It is the NICs 
responsibility to, among other things, present the government's websites with 
which they have been entrusted in a manner that "...not only brands an 
organization (ie: it's clients -- the Indian government) as one 'keeping pace 
with the changing times' but also acts as its reflection before the entire 
world." (from http://indiaimage.nic.in/services.html#Web_design_development)

So, if the websites are shoddy, the government (as also, the tax payer) are not 
getting their money's worth -- ie: you as a tax payer are getting shafted !

I doubt however, that the contract for making government websites would ever go 
to private sector vendors who would likely do a better job, while it also 
encourages competition, stimulates the economy and reduces redtape. So I think 
we can all pat our own backs, for the shafts up our ****, thanks to our 
complacent acceptance of such crap.

Well, thanks, yeah, I sure will. Not that I am very hopeful of change. That's 
the reason why I meant to ask whether there is a more effective way to voice my 
opinion.

Read this on that page: "We also support state of.the-art web
technologies on our servers right from CGI, Perl, ASP, PHP, Front Page
Extensions, JSP, JAVA etc. Our capabilities include supporting a
variety of databases including MS SQL, MS Access, MySQL etc."

Seriously, is frontpage state of the art? And would anyone use MS
Access for a web site? I wouldn't recommend it to my enemy! Not that I
have enemies, though. CGI is also pretty dated IMHO. It's good, but
the load is quite unsustainable.

I feel your pain!

To make things worse, I just noticed that the following <sarcasm> minor
</sarcasm> ministries aren't even linked to from the GoI Directory
website.

# Ministry of Agriculture
# Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers
# Ministry of Commerce and Industry
# Ministry of Communications and Information Technology !!!!

Audacity has a "Voice Remover" function. Not fully functional. But

Hi

Well, talking about government websites i would like to bring to light the
state of state/city police websites. It is pretty sad that such a powerful
body should have such sick sites.
Check out

# Mumbai Police http://www.mumbaipolice.org/
Looks more like a travel site than a police site

#Kolkata Police http://www.kolkatapolice.gov.in/index.asp
The orange background on the site makes me blind :)

#Delhi Police ( the capital of India!!)
http://www.delhipolice.nic.in/
and many more....you can google them up

Though special mention has to go to
Tamil Nadu Police :http://tnpolice.gov.in/ really clean site :)
Kerala Police: http://www.keralapolice.org/

If funding for such web initiative are a problem, what is the problem in
switching to FOSS initiatives, like Drupal/Wordpress? I feel that the people
in the government should be educated about such things, and make them more
tech savvy.

Regards
Varrun

Usually, the maximum time on the server will be spent reading the DB and
rendering the html to send to the browser. So, just using a fast web server
will not be of much help! Fine tuning your db (denormalize) and your middle
ware will give you better results.

Of course you'll have to use a fast web server, but thats the easier part.

Something even more basic... why do some Indian Government
websites have .org domain names?  Haven't they standardized
on .gov.in or nic.in TLDs already?

Hurts national pride that Mumbai Police ultimately pays some
organization in the USA for registering their domain name.

Use tomcat to serve dynamic pages & apache httpd server for serving images.
This way you can serve your application faster.

Hello ,

I have c/C++ code in Solaris/AIX/HP-UX which is for big endian arch .

Now i am moving the c/C++ code to Little endian Linux X86 ,


i would like to know what are issues need to be addressed when moving from big endian  to little endian .

also is left shift and right shit oprs in C/C++  has issues when moving from big endian to little endian or will it simply run in both archs as is without any issues .

Not too sure, but recompiling should handle this automatically. Unless
of course, there is code that assumes big-endian and optimizes
something.

Not in my experience! Have a look at the web sites of private telecom
companies or various banks. While their "looks" are perhaps slightly
better, their "feel" is as 90's as it gets. Full of flash and
cumbersome navigation based on un-necessary use of Javascript.

The core audience addressed by both sets of web sites is the same ---
the bulk of our ignorant upper middle class who can just about use
Internet Explorer as it came with their pre-installed system.

If a program/web-site is only designed with the generic "customer" in
mind this is what you will get --- something that _only_ caters to the
least common demoninator. Obviously programs should not be designed
with _only_ the "3l33t hax0r"s in mind either! An appropriate balance
has to be found.

Message-ID: <7938ae610910271856n14401ee4m9922464d5ecf263@mail.gmail.com>

If you type make

$ make

the first rule is executed. If you type

$ make boorule,

It executes the statements given after

boorule: boo.c foo.c i.h ba.h
<TAB> echo "I got called"

So you will get,

$ make boorule
echo "I got called"
I got called

Why?

It is the habit of make to print what command it is executing. If you
want to avoid that,

Prefix a '@' before echo.

boorule: boo.c foo.c i.h ba.h
<TAB> @echo "I got called"

Now we are fine.

You can put any shell script in the action part. But you have to
ensure that they all are in one line.

A rule is always one line. Remember that. You have to use a bunch of
'\' characters like this.

Look at this:

boorule:
        @for i in `cat /etc/passwd`  ; \
        do \
                echo $$i |cut -d: -f1 ;  \
        done

It is very complicated.

All I am doing is getting make to execute a shell script for me. But
it is hard because we never bother
about writing all the script commands in one line. In a makefile, you
have to do that.

Look at the above excerpt.

You always use the \ only at the end of the line. Vim's syntax
highlighting can catch when you have  a space
after \. Be careful!

Moreover you have to use ; characters to delimit the various commands
of the shell.

Why am I using two $ signs in front of the loop variable i?

$i is a make variable. We want the value in $i, hence $$i.

Obviously makefiles are not easy to master. But they are very powerful.

We will see a few more concepts tomorrow and move on.

Okay.

Okay.

There are a few. Surely left shift and right shift are good examples.
There are many others too.

The way ntohs() , ntohs(), ntohl(), ntohl() works will be different.

Network byte order is big endian.

Intel is Little Endian. So you have to work around all that. Also
socket communications between
a little endian and big endian machine will land you in trouble if you
don't take care.

It is best to convert both sides to network byte order before communication.

Also ensure that you use character buffers and not integers as much as possible.

Endianness only affects integers(shorts, signed, unsigned longs)

As long as you use byte arrays, you won't have issues.

> also is left shift and right shit oprs in C/C++ ?has issues when moving from big endian to little endian or will it simply run in both archs as is without any issues .

Best of luck!

If you are reading/writing binary data (int, floats, structs), then you need
to ensure the appropriate byte swapping functions are used.  libc has
several functions for this purpose, as well as several 3rd party libraries
are also available.

Other than this, I don't think there are any endian issues to be worried about.


> also is left shift and right shit oprs in C/C++ ?has issues when moving from big endian to little endian or will it simply run in both archs as is without any issues .

Shift operators work as expected on both platforms.  Nothing to worry.

Ensure byte swapping is done immediately after read(), and just
before write() and there should be no problems.


You should consider the different sizes of int and long on 64bit and 32bit
platforms.  Sparc enforces stricter memory alignment than x86, so the size
of structs will vary between platforms.  Never make assumptions, and always
use sizeof() to calculate memory requirements for structs and arrays.

No direct experience here, but C bitfields might be another thing for
you to worry about.

OTOH, something stand along might just run.  Does this code read/write
from the network, assuming some binary format?  Does it read binary
blobs off the disk?

Give details, this is interesting.

are you talking about application server or web server?

Java based application can be used application server - tomcat, jboss,
websphere

If its to just serve web pages - apache httpd, iis and others etc.

which web server is good to use? you can find out by doing benchmarking your
application response against each of the server i mentioned above.

how to make application fast -

1. caching should page. cache pages, queries, images, chart images.
2. reduce no. of request to application server from you application after it
reachs the browser.

Very sorry for the belated reply.

What you are asking is too much. ;)

It is like saying that you will mix 3 colors in water and you want to
separate the 3 colors. Now you know that soil can be separated in a
glass...

Anyway sorry for the diversion.

You can try this:

$ mplayer -af karaoke foo.mp3

That should help you a bit.

I have faced some issues while porting the DES algorithm from Solaris
to some other OS on Intel(I dunno if it was Windows NT or Netware).

I was working in Novell then.

I had a very interesting and very long winded debug session in which I compared
the results of the complex crypto algorithm step by step until I
figured out that
the issue was with the left shift/right shift/rotate function in the
DES round key
generation.

The way I did that was instructive. I knew a lot about the internal
workings of DES since I was deep into crypto at that time. I ran the
same program on the target machine and on Solaris and I knew which
outputs at which step had to match.

So I did not have to follow the code much, my knowledge of the
expected output helped. It was a long time ago, so I don't recollect
many details but I was not good at coding then. I could still solve
the issue due to my grasp of the technology and
the big picture.

It was a thoroughly interesting problem to solve.

Does this satiate your curiosity Rosh? ;)

Actually I was asking the OP, but since you ask, no, it doesn't.  All
you've said is that you faced a problem, and you solved it.  The devil

No direct experience here, but C bitfields might be another thing for
you to worry about.

OTOH, something stand along might just run.  Does this code read/write
from the network, assuming some binary format?  Does it read binary
blobs off the disk?

Give details, this is interesting.

I haven't done anything like this, so I don't really know.  This
search seemed to throw up lots of relevant sounding results,
http://www.google.com/search?q=porting+C+between+big+endian+and+little+endian+machines

You might want to try Google first, hitting the list is fine, but in
most cases you will get only generic answers, unless you have a very
specific question to which someone can give a specific answer.  HTH.

Happy to see info about AWS Workshop/unconf info posted in the ILUG-C list.

While cloud/AWS leverages FOSS in a big way, there are a few important core
aspects of cloud that run counter to the spirit of Free Software. The
unconference session is designed to actively solicit talks/demos/showcasing
on alternatives of AWS. Talks that will shape the Thought Leadership on FOSS
in the context of cloud/AWS most welcome/solicited.

One of the barriers faced by the student community in trying out AWS is the
creditcard needed for maintaining a functional AWS account. The workshop
attempts to address the issue by issueing free credits. Since ILUG-C is
popular with students community, I thoght it is appropriate to mention about
the free-credits here.

I take this opportunity of my maiden post to ILUG-C to invite each one of
you in the LUG to take part in AWS Workshop/Unconf and make it a huge
community success.

Friends.

I want to get announced in a irc channel, when I get a mail.

Is there any IRC bot who check for email and announce it in a channel?

If not, how to develop this?

Thanks.

first, pycon is not strictly FOSS. Python is open source, but many of the 
developers are not FOSS people. It is a language conference. We basically need 
5-6 halls, with one or two with large seating capacity (5-700 or more). 
Preferrably AC with wifi facility. If the venue is outside the city - 
arrangements for transport also. Please join chennaipy@googlegroups.com if you 
are interested further.

Message-ID: <7938ae610910281859x3cd022b3pab22f17ac66cc2b4@mail.gmail.com>

Today is the last part.

make(1) also has its own for loops and if conditions.

There is also a BSD make and a GNU make. GNU make is called as
gmake(1) since both
are incompatible in certain ways.

There is no recursive make in BSD. The syntax also is different.

By the way make is not used just for program compilation. It is not
just a build tool.

make is used for keeping targets up to date and doing only whatever
more needs to be done to
achieve a goal.

Consequently make is used in the BSD world for installing packages called ports.

Each of the steps, fetch over HTTP or FTP from Internet, checksum,
extract, build and install are
given as targets in a huge makefile.

You can include makefiles and you can avail the rules in them.

Makefiles can also be used for doing audio processing for instance.
You can check whether some
step is performed and then do it for the targets that are missing that.

Shrini,

            I don't understand why do u need an notification in IRC when
mail clients ( e.g Evolution ) has the capability of doing so. All you need
is a plugin for evolution, to get notified.

Karthik.

But if you are creating a J2EE application, the choice of server can
even be at deployment time. you can develop in tomcat and deploy in
jBoss. There might be small tweeks that you might have to do though.

If you are thinking of using any EJB, then you can't use Tomcat.

All servers are good enough. they follow standards.

1. Follow good coding practices (use prepared statements, avoid query
in loops, etc...)
2. Use PMD, Check style
3. if the load is more, add more hardware (Clustering, dividing static
and dynamic content into webserver and app server)

You need to look at this slide:

http://quigon.bsws.de/papers/2009/eurobsdcon-faster_packets/mgp00010.html

By the way I implemented IPsec on the Nucleus OS for Midas Communications
 in 2003. My first LUG talk also was on that.

But it was a long time ago. mbufs are really great. Linux skbuffs are adapted
from that I think.

I couldn't get everything working on the Banyan router since it was
resource constrained. Today's technology should allow full mbuf
implementation.

My recent project for a Silicon Valley based company was on uClinux
running on a webcam like camera. It is only as big as the hand of an
average man.

My development experience was really pleasant.

I guess today's embedded systems allow you to run full UNIX.

In fact the camera supported both telnet and ftp. The cross compiler
also was really easy to work with. Everything was cool.

Hi,

Thanks for the replies.

I am working for different kinds of event monitoring.

There are two things.
1. event monitoring
2. announcing

The events may as change in a webpage, a new mail, a twitter update, a RSS feed.

These should be monitored for any change.
If found any change, it should be announced to some group of people.

Announcement may be done with IRC bot, sms, a sound, any notification etc.

Done with the event monitoring part.

now working on the announcement.

Is there any IRC bot available who can check for new mail and announce
it channel?

Thanks.

all irc bots announce in the channel - you need to notify the bot when to 
announce and what to announce. I remember long ago playing with supy bot.

yes - supybot is still around - can be configured to do something as trivial as 
announcements, although it is much more powerful than that.

that is not the function of bots - you have notifications from many sources, 
these are sent to the bot and the bot talks about it in the channel. IRC bot 
is nothing but a piece of software that logs in to an irc channel and has the 
right to speak there (as long as it is not banned). Usually bots are configured 
to respond to events in the channel, but they can also respond to events 
outside.

Subject: [Ilugc] [HOWTO] using 2 or more ISP links for Internet link sharing
Message-ID: <7938ae610910290312u47096f19iaf38038a7b90569e@mail.gmail.com>

I got to know that this question has been coming again and again in
ILUGC for several years now.

How to share three ISP providers say Airtel, BSNL and Tata Indicom or
Reliance wireless or whatever?

The ISP gives the routers that dish out a private IP to us. So the
idea is to divide the traffic from another
node on the network with just one interface since the IP routing
happens in software.

The goal here is to send the outgoing traffic to the Internet using 2
or more default routes instead of one default
route.

It is a very simple idea and easy thing to do in OpenBSD. In Linux of
course it is difficult. ;)

First the simple way. Just follow these instructions.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

6.14 - How can I do equal-cost multipath routing?

Equal-cost multipath routing refers to having multiple routes in the
routing table for the same network, such as the default route,
0.0.0.0/0. When the kernel is doing a route lookup to determine where
to send packets destined to that network, it can choose from any of
the equal-cost routes. In most scenarios, multipath routing is used to
provide redundant uplink connections, e.g., redundant connections to
the Internet.

The route(8) command is used to add/change/delete routes in the
routing table. The -mpath argument is used when adding multipath
routes.

    # route add -mpath default 10.130.128.1
    # route add -mpath default 10.132.0.1

Verify the routes:

    # netstat -rnf inet | grep default
    default     10.130.128.1      UGS       2      134      -     fxp1
    default     10.132.0.1        UGS       0      172      -     fxp2

In this example we can see that one default route points to
10.130.128.1 which is accessible via the fxp1 interface, and the other
points to 10.132.0.1 which is accessible via fxp2.

Since the mygate(5) file does not yet support multipath default
routes, the above commands should be added to the bottom of the
hostname.if(5) files for the fxp1 and fxp2 interfaces. The /etc/mygate
file should then be deleted.

/etc/hostname.fxp1
    !route add -mpath default 10.130.128.1
/etc/hostname.fxp2
    !route add -mpath default 10.132.0.1

Lastly, don't forget to activate the use of multipath routes by
enabling the proper sysctl(3) variable.

    # sysctl net.inet.ip.multipath=1
    # sysctl net.inet6.ip6.multipath=1

Be sure to edit sysctl.conf(5) to make the changes permanent.

using shorewall, it is dead easy - one can do load balancing also, the only 
problem is when some ISP goes down

I think you are asking for a ready-made solution for customized problem.

There isn't a high likelyhood of finding exactly what you are looking for. I 
think an easier approach would be to program a bot that executes a new mail 
check when specifically commanded to.

If you insist on a event monitoring bot tho', try creating on yourself, it isn't 
too hard to do. Look at the first result for the google query:

http://www.google.com/search?&q=email+checking+irc+bot

...that should give you an idea how to do it.


HTH,

the whole idea of monitoring events with a bot is silly. Every program knows 
what it is doing and is capable of sending signals/notifications when an event 
happens. My django app tweets whenever a new report is added, my hg repository 
sends a mail whenever a change takes place, my mailserver sends me a mail

which the bot can publish. Publish over email, sms, twitter, irc and what have

The route command does take multiple gateways including those for default
route with metric/ weights etc. ECMP works well too. Linux also has an
option of per packet or per connection based balancing which is useful if
upstream routers use stateful filtering. It is pretty simple and easy in
Linux too. Shorewall does use this.

option 1: use Julian Anastasov's DGD patches.
option 2: I did this very early os I did not want to patch and recompile the
kernel. Wrote a shell script to ping different ISP gateways and store states
based on return codes. Had old states and new states variables based on
which route was redefined. Put this in crontab and it worked like a charm.

heh ...same difference. In the end someone/something would ...

- either actually 'monitor an event' (the presence of a signal/mail/sms/tweet) 
synchronously and consume it when it occurs or
- would display the event asynchronously when command to.

(ie: the difference between mail/tweet/sms poping in front of you or you going 
someplace to read it -- the 'monitoring' is done by you or something else)

> Publish over email, sms, twitter, irc and what have

Yes. I think the OPs requirement is to have something to monitor the published 
event (in his case, the arrival of a mail) and announce its occurrence 
synchronously, using a bot rather than doing it manually in an asynchronous manner.

Thats fine.

Applications can send notifications. But, we should have access to the
code of the apps.

What to do for the apps, where we have no control?

For example, I can not request twitter.com to send notification to a
IRC or send mail.

It is out job to monitor twitter and send a mail.

My program should monitor a page/rss/mail for a change and notify in any form.

working on this and will update the results.

Thanks.

Hi,
I followed this link
http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/Networking/Spanning_Multiple_DSLsfor
load balancing of 2 ISPs.
But I'm unable to achieve the loadbalancing. even I'm unable to ping other
PCs.
I notice that ,route command gives the same output before & after applying
those rules (I followed that link)
Could you tell me how can I troubleshoot this issue?

Site needs login. Please give more info on
a. Internet links you've, how they are connected to the gateway etc.
b. What you meant by "unable to ping other PCs". If it is about PCs in the
LAN, the gateway has no role to play.

If you see the route command spec, it can take multiple gateways which are
by default ECMP and connection based. Alternatively use Shorewall.

Login to your internet/DSL router and ping an external IP
(4.2.2.2, yahoo.com, your ISP gateway, etc) continuously
and check for drops.  If you get any ping drops then your
ISP link has a problem, screenshot it and send it to your
ISP tech support.

Note that some machines on the internet block or rate limit
ICMP packets (eg. google.com), so even if you are losing
ping packets, your internet connection would still be working
just fine.

Are any of your services (browsing, mail, voip) getting
affected?


ICMP may also be dropped in case of network congestion.
So test during off-peak times to ensure you are not getting
any ping drops.

Message-ID: <7938ae610910291646s329c8d3ev963ab70613994a4@mail.gmail.com>

LOCAL port forwarding:

$ ssh -L 1234:127.0.0.1:4321 61.1.1.2
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                  <local portion>
will forward the local port 1234 to 6.1.1.2 4321.

I have indicated the local portion above.

You can check it like this.

$ nc -l -p 1234

on the localhost

and

$ nc -l -p 4321

or even you can port forward to the remote web server on port 80.

When clients connect to your machine on port 1234, all traffic will go
to the remote end 4321.

So after executing the above 3 commands, you can type on the local machine

$ nc 127.0.0.1 1234
hi

and hi will be printed both the nc servers above.

This command

REMOTE port forwarding:

$ ssh -R 4000:192.168.1.15:2000  61.1.1.4
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                               <local portion>
will forward the port 4000 on the remote end 61.1.1.4 to the machine
192.168.1.15 on your local LAN port 2000.

I have indicated the local IP and port above. So this is the way you
think thro' it.

In local port forwarding the first port and first IP are local as I
indicated above.

In remote port forwarding the first IP and second port are local.

Think for half an hour. You will get it. And PLEASE TRY OUT stuff.

No use reading my tips without hard work from your side.

My tips are not for reading and archival.

You have to learn by doing. There is NO other way.

You have to learn technology by executing commands.

Study is only 50%. Action is the more important 50%.

I can't make it any more clearer.

This is "almost" true. The correct statement is that this will forward
connections made on the local machine at port 1234 to the remote
machine at the address 127.0.0.1:4321 _on_ the remote machine.

Usually, network daemons listen on *:4321 (where * takes all possible
local interface addresses) so this should work exactly as if the
connection was made to 6.1.1.2:4321.

Sometimes ... you may get a surprising result :-)

So if you really wanted 61.1.1.2:4321 then that is what you should
use.

  $ ssh -L 1234:6.1.1.2:4321 61.1.1.2

Kapil.

Fix what the error message suggests is the problem. Try installing the 32 bit 
compatibility libraries on your x86_64 system:

$ yum install libstdc++.i586 libstdc++-devel.i586 libgcc.i586 glibc.i586 
glibc-devel.i586

Writing an irc bot is easy. For instance, the notifications about svn
commits are sent to irc bot by calling the bot script from svn
post-commit script. The bot script can send snippet of log message to
specified irc server/channel.

Right, you can monitor a page/rss and send notification to the irc
channel. As per email, you can if you have access to email server, or
keep monitoring the emails using a email client. Accordingly you can
send notifications to the irc channel.

Please refer to this link for a sample script that is hooked to svn
post-commit script for sending commit notifications to irc channel:
  http://happynerds.wordpress.com/2008/01/06/irc-message-after-svn-commits/

I'm sure you can write one similar, or tailor the above script to suit
your requirement. Thanks!

FOSS Achievement:

1. First thing was FOSS awareness campaign for Faculty Members- Done with help from NRCFOSS in 2008.

Why Awareness is the need of the hour?
?a. One faculty scolded me for installing Fedora 5 in FOSS Lab since I removed Redhat EL v4.0 and her lex program was not working. Like me she has graduated from Regional Engg. College but she doesnt knows the relation between Redhat and Fedora. Actually
 flex was there)

?b. HP LaserJet 1018 doesnt work in linux- View of System Admin & one Professor.
??? (Our FOSS team proved them wrong)

2. Installing Fedora 10 in all systems in FOSS Lab in our College. 

(I have visited all colleges in Zone 2 of Anna University Affiliated colleges. They use windows system, telnet to Linux based Server for Operating System and Networks Lab. I have given each student a Linux machine and also shared root password and have given freedom to explore for good. Since all the linux machines are NIS configured, during lab examination they are connected to the Linux Server which happens to be my desktop machine)

3. Developed a small shell script to alleviate the problems of Lab Assistant. 

(We have 980 1st year students and they have Linux based Lab. Our poor lab assitant typed 980 times login name and supplied 980 times with different passwords. This prompted me to
 write a 6 line shell script to solve the problem). 

3. Installed all systems in Interent Lab with Fedora 10.

(Always our lab assistants had to format the systems due to virus affecting it since windows xp was installed in the Internet Lab before. Now lab assistant are happy enough with linux) 

4. Adopted FOSS as an Elective subject for B.E(CSE) students last year. This year also our HOD has approved it for the coming semester.

Real FOSS Achievement? according to me will be when my student community develop software which would be accepted by Fedora/Debian community.

Tom Knight and the Lisp Machine

A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the power
off and on.

Knight, seeing what the student was doing, spoke sternly: ?You cannot
fix a machine by just power-cycling it with no understanding of what
is going wrong.?

Knight turned the machine off and on.

The machine worked.

This is not configurable (at least not without recompiling bash :)). This is a 
feature of the shell itself. Do a "info bash" and search for "Tilde Expansion" 
to learn more.

> also i want to use
> ls user1 instead of ls ~user1

If that were implemented, consider this case ...

$ ls pony

...how is the shell supposed to figure out whether you meant to list the file or 
directory in the current directory which is named pony or look up whether the 
user pony exists and list that users home directory ?

Message-ID: <467c0a9a0910300032t2c5cb4dcxa9649aa8d7c7818a@mail.gmail.com>

Has anybody in this group tried to port Linux into a phone?
I bought an IPhone clone from the bazaar to experiment.

>From a Bluetooth link from my laptop to the DUN (Dial up networking) profile
of the phone, I was able to get the following details through the standard
modem AT commands-

   - The phone has a MTK2 chipset.
   - The firmware version is
   M5120_NEWMMI_CQ_SW_EN_FR_TH_PU_SP_GR_IT_TU_RU_HINDI_MA_IN_AO2
   - Build Time 2009-09-24 17:23


The MTK2 is made by a Taiwanese company and I did not get any replies from
them to my queries even for the AT command list. MTK is a large (top 20)
semiconductor company. Googling shows that the MTK2 has an ARM9 core. The
phone most probably runs a Nucleus OS.

I am not much interested in the phone function (will be a great bonus if it
works). I want to use the touch screen (240x320), mic, speaker, memory card
and Bluetooth from inside Linux. The camera is very bad and it's not much of
an use for my application. At Rs.3,250/- it's simply a miracle of Chinese
production technology. It has got an IMEI number and an Airtel sim works
fine, but I don't know it's authenticity. I guess if I don't use the phone
function, I would be legally safe...

Google searches did not help much because nearly all good links were Chinese
and even the translations just sent me into circles.

Any experiences or pointers?

Regards,
Arun

   ls ~/user1/ will list the files in the directory named user1 in the
current user's home folder.

   ls ~/user1 will list the contents of the user1's home directory,
normally /home/user1

I think you'd need some help from the hardware vendor - atleast to hook 
up a terminal to observe and debug boot up process. Does it have a 
miniUSB port? Can that be used for terminal hook up?

Bash built-in "cd" can be setup to do this:
    export CDPATH=/home
    cd /
    cd pony   #   goes to /home/pony

man bash has the details on CDPATH variable.  Does not work
with "ls" or other commands.


To the OP, don't customize the shell too much, as it may confuse
other users.

Hi,

closest i heard of (i never tried this myself!) are these links :

They might or not work. the posts use the sdcard to hold the linux and

No! It does not even have a name. There is another variant called i9+++
which does not have Java. The nameless phone I bought has Java and I wanted
it. By IPhone clone I meant look and feel. Anybody looking at it will think
it is an IPhone!

There is a USB cable. When I connect it to a laptop, it shows as 2 removable
drives. One for the phone memory and the other is the external memory card
in the phone. I have to check out whether it works as a comm port during
boot.

I do have the flashing toolkit. But need to check it out.

On the top left corner of the keyboard below 'ESC' key. You have to press shift
and that key to get tilde(~).

Actually tilde expansion is implemented by the glob(3) function.I will
talk about
this in the weekly language classes in the coming weeks. I wan to speak
about a lot of related functions and many interesting programming features that
we use day in day out but don't actually realize.

You will be interested in reading the man pages of

glob(3)
fnmatch(3)
regcomp(3) and regex(3)

I plan to write an article on C programming with this in a little
while(around 10 days
or more ;).

Now to answer your question you can use cd $HOME if you don't like tilde(~). ;)

Do a

$ echo $HOME

or for that user, do a su of that user and then type $HOME.

~user is actually a different matter. ;)

-Girish

I have attached my glob.c test program which I will explain in the language
classes but check it out. ;)


#include <stdio.h>
#include <glob.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int
main()
{
        glob_t pglob;
        int gflags, gerr, i;
        char *filename;

        gflags = GLOB_MARK | GLOB_TILDE;

        gerr = glob("~/C/*.c", gflags, NULL, &pglob);
        if (gerr)
                exit(128);
        for(i=0; i<pglob.gl_pathc; ++i) {
                filename = pglob.gl_pathv[i];
                printf(filename);
                printf("\n");
        }

}

Benedict Jayaprakash Nicholas,

the reason for asking is to let everyone know what you people have done.
Hats Off to you.

Now you have informed about the infrastructure, its upto pycon members to
decide.

I agree. but for that, people should know about FOSS. you have done that.
Please update your college entry here http://demo.ilugc.in/foss-clubs

This way, many other colleges will come know what you people have done and
they soon start something like this in their college.

6.  Till now, I remember this argument with one of your staff. Last day I
talked about the FOSS migrations and asked to a staffs that, "why you are
using Visual Studio to run your C++ program in your lab?. Even many open
source IDEs can do it like Kdevelop, Eclipse,.etc". But that staff told,
"Bcoz in our syllabus they mentioned Visual Studio as a compulsory lab tool.
You better suggest our government to use Open Source IDEs instead VC++; Then
we will start using  FOSS IDEs". It was going like such a harsh argument
between me and your staff. Later all your staffs joined together and argued.
Immediately you interrupted and informed to them that, none of the
University says that We must use Commercial tools; They have given a sample
tools name. Thats it. We can also use FOSS IDEs or equivalent. Then they
compromised and accepted that their thought was not true. According to me,
its another achievement for you. Now your staffs understand that "Commercial
tools are not compulsory and FOSS tools can be used in academic areas"

Not only in your college, in many colleges staffs are misunderstand this
word from their syllabus, "Any C++ compilers/IDEs like Visual Studio or
equivalent". When you visit staffs from other colleges, please inform to the
same. Bcoz FOSS cannot be reach students, until they (staffs) not ready to
accept it.

All the Best and many thanks to Benedict.

what is the output of

ip addr show
ip route show

route command will only show the main kernel routing table. You must  
use iproute2's "ip route show table <table>"

The UNR is optimized for smaller screens - e.g. it looks great on my HP 
mini.

However, tt should work if your laptop works fine with other Linux 
desktop installed.  I have done it on my Toshiba laptop with 14.1" 
screen - I did not like it and removed it.

Only one outgoing interface with 125.17.111.157/8. Where is the second? 
Did someone actually give you a /8 subnet?!!! Is this an 
lab/experimental network?

No default route at all. You would not be able to ping outside the 125/8 
address range even if you did own the 125/8 range. If not, even that 
ping i.e 125/8 address will not work.

Please give an ascii network diagram or description of the gateway, its 
external links and internal links.

It is a great command.

Dear Mohan,

We have discussed this enough. I told Thanigai that I could come and
fix this issue for them in their office using OpenBSD.

But that proposal did not work. Thanigai is still stuck and networking
problems like this can be really hard.

Please take it offline and speak to him on his mobile.

I am sending his mobile number to you.

I also spoke to a big reseller in Chennai and got to know that the big
firewall vendors do offer outgoing link load balancing but the incoming
link level load balancing is the issue.

Hi,

Try

sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get -f install

Then try apt-get install kubuntu-desktop

But, you can install the latest 9.10 as it came yesterday.

Are they? Not with the help one can get on this list. The problem needs 
to be defined well enough with diag info.

I guess OP is not looking for commercial/paid gear. Subject seems to 
suggest outgoing load balancing and not incoming. In any case, 
simplistic incoming connection balancing can be done using RR DNS. I've 
also rarely seen incoming load balancing requests.

Information given so far is pretty sparse. I do not see 2 internet links 
anywhere in the info sent so far too. OP needs to troubleshoot and set 
up basic network.

Message-ID: <200910311254.03457.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

I do not know if it is only me, but I am in constant trouble wrt firefox and 
passwords. Here are some doubts:

1. on first logging in to a site, firefox asks whether to save the username and 
password. If you click 'not now' or ignore the question, the question vanishes 
and you never get to save that password. How to get it to ask again?

2. when the site design changes, firefox often does not remember the site and 
asks for username and password afresh - which I have usually forgotten. How to 
tell it that it is a site for which the info is stored?

3. I once typed the wrong username using 'k' instead of 'K'. Asked firefox to 
remember it, and then found it was wrong. Now firefox will not allow me to 
enter the capital 'K' instead of the small 'k'. Even if I enter the capital 
'K' it changes it. So I have to go to some other machine to log in to that 
site.

4. How to tell it to forget a username and password for a particular site?

In Firefox, go to Edit->Preferences  and open the Security tab. There
you can see for which sites passwords are not remembered and also the
list of saved passwords

Hi.

Check out this page:

http://gayatri-hitech.com/Misc/imgareaselect/

and this code:

http://gayatri-hitech.com/languageclasses/imgareaselect.js.html

The idea is for the doctor to be able to identify problems with the
eyes of patients.

Now I dunno how to select multiple areas in the same image. Obviously
the areas will not overlap.

One way is to make the user click a next button so that the new
highlight rectangle is shown.

Anyway this is food for thought.

There are many brilliant javascript programmers in LUG. Just that I am
very bad at it.

Highlight the incorrect username in the drop down using the arrow keys.
Press Shift + Del to make FF forget that user name.  The same also
applies to form entries, url history, etc.


Also recommend you install Xmarks or Mozilla Weave to backup/sync
your bookmarks and passwords to the cloud.

Thanks for sharing this. It would have been a bit more useful if you also 
mentioned in passing the actual plugin name and the source:

Dear Steve,

I think I already did that. The plugin name is imgAreaSelect. There is
another  plugin called jqzoom. I have linked to both pages. Please
read thro' my mail once again.

You could also google for them of course.

I modified their sample pages quite a bit to develop what I shared with
you all.

For passwords and other fields, I'd recommend sxipper plugin.

There fixed :). Good people, what we witnessed is called a 'race condition', 
something i believe Girish'll undoubtedly cover as part of his programming 
tutorial series :).

Thanks again for sharing your tips.
