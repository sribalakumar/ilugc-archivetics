Are you open to other brand names besides Dell.   That would open up
the playing field.
Toshiba has served me well over the years.   Latest is a Lenovo ultra
book, it came with Win8.1 which got replaced with Debian Wheezy.

A long time ago I asked in this group about how to plot bars on a virutal

out the answer was cesiumjs.

I have written a cesiumjs code so that an analyst could click and drill

Hi All,

I am a research scholar and newbie to Linux. My research requires a open
source software for simulation process. I have purchased a new HP Pavilion
laptop having Radeon graphics for this purpose which comes with Windows 8.

Whenever I tried to install Ubuntu / Debian or even booting live CD, it say
"low graphics mode" and always ends up with the console. I tried googling a
lot and find that the problem is with Radeon graphics drivers and couldn't
find any optimal solution.

Please help me to resolve this problem as it is much needed for my
research. I can also visit your workplace along with my laptop for
installing the Ubuntu / Debian.

Try installing the ATI binary blobs.

Use Ubuntu latest live CD.  For newbie Debian is not recommended without
proper guidance. I had a hard time, personally.
Debian by default ends up in console mode , if you use only the CD1.
Therefore, I recommend Ubuntu.

Check with hp support about your linux installation. They have to guide you
because you are a customer.

Other than that you can always check for the particular simulation software
which runs on windows . Search in sourceforge.net If it is not available
then you can go for full Linux installation

Hope this helps.

Good day.

Unless, the vendor certifies the hardware for a particular OS, they
will most likely tell to take a hike, politely of course.  Even for
server hardware, that are certified  for RHEL/Novell SuSE, it must
match the version on their site.   For an old Intel server board
(2006), Intel told me politely that it was certified for RHEL4 only.
The fact that RHEL 5 supersedes RHEL4 (a few years back) did not make
a difference to the Technical support chap in Bengaluru.

To the best of my knowledge, desktops / laptops are not supported
unless it came factory installed with Linux.

I would recommend installation from an alternate ISO/image of Ubuntu.
Installs much faster than the GUI install. Set the default to console
login. Install the ATI binaries and invoke X. If it falls back to the
console, see the error in the logs. This will give you pointers.

I've a AMD desktop with a Radeon card with HDMI and VGA interface at
home. I was able to get display on the HDMI display while installing
Ubuntu though to a max of 1440x900 resolution. Post installation, I
installed the Radeon 5450 (my card) drivers from the Dell site and
then was able to get full HD output.

If the laptop has a dual hybrid-GPU setup, things might be a bit more
complicated to setup. I was trying to follow all the guides to setup
the dual hybrid GPU on my wife's laptop using Debian/Ubuntu and none
of them worked. Then I figured out that there are multiple ways that
the dual hybrid GPU might be configured on the laptop. For instance in
my case, it was always the intel GPU that was exposed to the OS and
all the intensive graphics work, the intel GPU offloaded it to the AMD
discrete GPU and then rendered the result. So installing a fairly
recent version of kernel (Debian Jessie) and enabling just the intel
GPU first before installing the radeon driver solved the problem for
me. So you might have to do some research before trying the various
howto guides. If you don't understand any of the terms I have used,
please feel free to search for them and read up.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Subject: [Ilugc] Proprietary Product Company as a sponsor of FOSS event
Message-ID: <CAJ9BSW_qPE+BXSNM-7Jcv71g6EsAo5mq5KvnGEkuZeKEcPufdg@mail.gmail.com>

We are a bunch of hackers at Hacker's Den (http://hackersden.org) who
believe in sharing and openness. We are going to organise a FOSS event
in coming few days. But at the moment we are kinda puzzled over
sponsorship for the event.

1) To have a proprietary product company as a sponsor of FOSS event is
it morally right? I mean there will be banners, flyers of that
proprietary company all over the venue. In an event we are promoting
FOSS and on a venue we are promoting/marketing proprietary product
company. Isn't it contradictory behaviour?

But if we deny the sponsorship aren't we depriving that proprietary
company of doing a noble deed (of supporting a FOSS event)?

2) What about proprietary *service* company?  I mean the one which
serves it's client with say system administration or building a dbms
system (which is closed source suppose) for the client e.g. Infosys
(http://www.infosys.com/), Wipro (www.wipro.com), Persistent
(www.persistent.com) etc. Is it something different with the
proprietary service company compared to proprietary product company?

Should we accept the sponsorship or deny it?

3) A solution?
Accepting a sponsorship from a proprietary company (product/service)
and placing a large banner at the entrance of a venue as well as on
the website saying "We do not necessarily support any of our sponsors'
products or philosophy." as a countermeasure, will work? Or is it
similar to printing "smoking is injurious to health" on cigarette
packets and continuing the cigarette production at the same time and
later on denying any responsibility saying "We warned you"? Personally
I think printing a warning on cigarette packet is a big joke; because
if you really cared for the health of society you would have stopped
the production itself.

Thoughts?

Prior to asking this question, did you your research by searching the
web using your favourite search engine? If so, what were the results
pointing to and what were the limitations/issues you faced while trying
them out?

Anyways, searching the internet for the same, I found many resources of
which MathJax (http://www.mathjax.org/) looked the most promising to me,
ymmv.

Did you search the internet for the same? When I searched the web, I
could find a lot of links relevant to solving your problem. Please do
your research prior to asking questions here. Anyway here you go,
http://ashhar24.wordpress.com/2012/06/15/setting-up-wireless-driver-fedora/.
This should be helpful in installing the driver for your Broadcom
BCM4321 wireless adapter.

IIRC, Broadcom has open sourced the driver for it's WiFi chip set.
Sometimes missing firmware is the root cause of the driver not
working.   Look @ Fedora firmware rpms.

Alternately, try latest version of Ubuntu live CD, to see if the
driver is included.
I have found Ubuntu to be pretty good in detecting and installing
drivers for newer hardware.

Ubuntu 14.04. HP Deskjet All in One 2545.

Installed HP printer drivers and works well. Am able to see the status
using CUPS on localhost and also the printer URL by IP which allows
for scanning, diags etc.

Overall experience - Pretty good.

Thanks.  The above has ink cartridges.  I am looking for a printer
that has ink tanks rather than cartridge.  This is for my who is a
lawyer.  Unfortunately they need to print paper copies for almost

Epson L210 is the only one I have found so far.   Anyone has it and
used it with Linux?

Linux drivers are available from Epson's site <http://ow.ly/yOa5l>
I have had reasonably good experience with Epson scanners + their Linux driver.
Expect the same to be true with the printer.

j510 All-in-one Printer but it has cartridge.)

Cartridges, even when refilled by a 3rd party is a PITA and is
possible only when shops are open.  I used to mess around with them
but no more hence the tank  requirement.

Thanks but I have found only one printer with ink 'tank',  as posted
earlier.  Epson also provides the drivers for them.

Perhaps, but interestingly the Epson L210 is available only in Asian
countries from my searches in various online depots.

Dear all,

Free Software Foundation Tamil Nadu conducted 5-day long Summer Camp in the
green and beautiful campus of Indian Institute of Technology Madras on
various Free Software technologies and the philosophy behind Free Software.

The workshop was attended by 117 participants from not less than 43
educational institutions. The Free Software Foundation, Tamil Nadu has
always encouraged women participation in technology and has also taken
initiatives to ensure the  same. The Summer Camp?14 saw over half the
participants being women. The same holds good with the volunteers at the
workshop. This is a remarkable leap from the previous year and sets a good
benchmark for the next year.

Detailed report , blogs  of participants and volunteers are present here .

Hi Everyone,
Was at the Pych meet on 28th June. Got an opportunity to discuss with
Samuel Vijaykumar, and other members of the Pych team. It was good to
see people with lot of energy willing to promote Python in
Chennai. The outcome of the meet is listed below:

  1. The two groups will be merged into one unified group.

  2. Sam and team are interested in conducting events like workshops
     and hackathons. To run the group and help organize such
     events a core team will be formed. The core team will consist of
     volunteers taking up various roles. Example of roles include
     website maintainer, mailing list moderator, venue coordinator,
     meetings coordinator, ...

  3. We will be having a core team meeting, on 14th July 7:00 PM
     at Qruize Technologies. The address is given below.

---
Qruize Technologies,
#37, New #57, 53rd Street,
9th Avenue, Ashok Nagar,
Chennai.
---

     In the core team meeting, people can volunteer to take up various
     roles. We will also plan the next event -- hackathon / workshop.
     People interested in volunteering for activities of the group are
     requested to take part in the meet.

Regards,
Vijay

Not a very good idea to pip install arbitrary packages from pypi into
the system-wide python installation. It is a best practice to use
something like virtualenv or buildout to isolate such packages required
for specific project.

To achieve this using virtualenv, you might have to use the following
commands.

Install virtualenv

On Debian/Ubuntu based systems, the package to install for this is
'python-virtualenv'.

Once it is installed, create a virtual python environment using the
following command

$ virtualenv /path/to/name-of-virtual-environment

Activate it:
$ source /path/to/name-of-virtual-environment/bin/activate

Install the packages from pypi that you need for your project into the
virtualenv.

For example,
$ pip install timestring

When the virtualenv is activated, the 'python' command will be pointing
to the isolated python installed within the virtualenv. So you can write
your scripts and then run them by just invoking 'python' as you would do
outside a virtualenv.

Exit the virtualenv:
$ deactivate

To execute the script using the virtualenv without activating it, run
$ /path/to/name-of-virtual-environment/bin/python your_script.py

Just a word of caution, the day+date pattern repeats every 6+11+11
years. The calendar for 2009 was same as what we'll see in 2015. This
can cause bugs.

The first testing day of the cycle is coming this week on Thursday, June
10th. Elfy and myself will be giving demos and talking about running and
testing the development release of ubuntu.

You can catch the action live on ubuntuonair.com at 1900 UTC. After the
hangout, we'll transition to IRC and keep running tests, reporting results,
filing bugs and doing triage work. I'll be around until 2200 UTC, so feel
free to swing by late if you can't make it on time. The video will be on
youtube following the transmission and you can watch it later at your
convenience if needed.

This is your chance to ask questions and report some test results. Hope to
see everyone there!

Nicholas

P.S. We have a team calendar that can help you keep track of the release
schedule along with this and other events. Check it out
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Calendar.

While I wonder whether supporting a FOSS event is a "noble deed", it
would be nicer if you can provide examples of companies that match
your definition of a proprietary product company.

This of course means that you assume that the companies you list [i]
do not use an FOSS stacks for their services deployment/consultancy
[ii] do not contribute to any FOSS project [iii] do not see value in
encouraging an ecosystem by contributing in as many forms as possible.

I would be interested in understanding why you see it that way.

There are quite a few AutoCAD alternatives in Open Source. QCAD has most of
the options of AutoCAD. You can also try LibreCAD.

In my understanding most big companies (proprietary and others) support
FOSS. With FOSS lot of tech developments happen which is finally somehow or
other used to promote their brand/ products.

I heard the same about

Chromium browser vs Chrome.

Android and OpenJDK ?!

umpteen number of drivers.. and so on.

Money really rules.

It is in Tami. Read I here.

I realize and appreciate that there is great value in having such an
article in Tamil. Can I trouble you with providing a quick summary (in
English) of the points?

Hello,
Am new to this mailing list.
I'd like to communicate with relevant members of this group to talk about a
community project that involves high school students using Ubuntu OS to
help communities they work with.
Please let me know who I could contact.

Also is this the place to make such a request?
If not, could you please direct me to the group, list, website or even
person who would be appropriate for this purpose?

Thank you,

Yes please - like it or not English has become the global de-facto language.

Perhaps the first translated draft could be machine translation
(translate.google.com)?

Madan,
Thanks for the quick response.
Would it be possible to talk with you or anyone else about this over the
phone?
It would be far easier to make it a conversation so clarifications could be
made immediately.

A blog or online page will help folks understand and respond. Else,
the person you speak to will have to summarise and post a mail.

Hi Mohan,
Thanks for the response. Do you mean I should post to an online blog or
site? Could you suggest one?

The reason I should like to talk with someone before posting is to figure
out whether this is the right list for what I have in mind. I'd rather not
waste everyone's time / space etc.

I'm happy to post a summary of the conversation, if there is one, to the
list.

Regards,
Padmini

Dear Madam,

Since your request in related to Free Software, you have reached the
right place for posting what you have in your mind/thoughts.  We
everyone here is ready to help, as your community project involves
high school students.

Message-ID: <CACtiFJaax2Xfp=2nedqDd1bVM2hxi0yCJQ8QDSZfPhmO3TUQSw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Myself conducted FOSS workshop based on the subject 'Open Source Lab'
in the following Engineering colleges between 04/07/2014 and
13/07/2014.

1. Sri Bharathi Engineering College for Women, Kaikkurichi, Pudukkottai Dt.

Participants: More than 35 students from 3rd year and final year of
CSE attended the workshop.

2. E.G.S Pillay Engineering College, Nagapattinam Dt.
Date: 11/07/2014
Participants: More than 100 Students from Final year CSE attended the workshop.

3. Jayaram College of Engineering and Technology, Thuraiyur, Trichy Dt.
Date: 12/07/2014 and 13/07/2014
Participants: More than 70+ students and faculty members from various
institutions attended the workshop.

* Oxford Engineering College, Trichy Dt.

Also, we have been setting up 'Open Source Lab' using Fedora-20 in
various engineering colleges.  If any one interested in volunteering
in this effort, they may contact me offlist.  We are updating the list
of colleges were we have setup FOSS Labs in the recent times.

http://www.linuxpert.in/wp-content/uploads/opensource-lab-setup-in-engineering-colleges-2014.pdf

The good news is that, previously they requested for Dual boot option,
this time most colleges asked for Linux only.

Message-ID: <CABe_ZfJvX29i8Xs7uGaoP2eVs5_eAVRqqPT9arQ-JiYaRoA3Ug@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am facing a ssh connectivity issue in my CentOS 6.4. I installed OpenSSH
server 5.3p1 but I couldn't do remote command line login to ssh server
 from a remote PC. I have done the following troubleshooting methods but
still I the problem exists.

1. Verified that sshd is running and listen to the port 22 [ netstat -plnt].
2. I disabled the iptables (for temporary) and verified that the port 22 is
accessible [telnet serverIP 22] from remote PC.
3.  I changed the ssh port to 2222 [ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -d -p 2222] and
verified that the port 2222 is accessible from the remote PC [telnet
serverIP 2222].
4. I used tcmpdump to check the ssh request from remote PC [ tcpdump -n -i
eth0 port 22 and host IPaddress].I could see the traffic from remote PC.

Any help or suggestion to fix the issue will be appreciated.

Regards,
Jithin K

Bhaskar, Balu, all,
Thank you for expressing an interest in a possible project.
In FOSS I am familiar only with the Ubuntu OS (and its variants edubuntu,
kubuntu etc.)

Am exploring the possibility of getting HS students involved in learning to
format hard drives of older computers (that people want to get rid of),
install the Ubuntu OS and make these available to those with less access to
computers.
The students would then teach the recipients to use the OS and applications
that work with the OS. They would also help with regular upgrades each year
when the next version is released. It is an ongoing programme.
There are details of course which would be modified depending on the
context. But that's it in a nutshell.

I need to meet with those who could help teach the HS students about
Ubuntu, how to install, upgrade, find applications and put together
tutorials for those they wish to help.
Hope this makes sense.

@balu would like to hear about your experience with the free laptop scheme.
What are the obstacles?

Regards,
Padmini

@padmini, three factors - lack of academic integration, training (to 
both students and teachers) and support (peer/community/commercial) 
seems by far serious obstacles, in particular in encouraging use of 
foss, here BOSS Linux.
so if your training idea takes off, it would be interesting to see if it 
helps.

1. Enterprises deprecate full machines and just hard disks are rarer nowadays.
2. Getting hard disks, loading Ubuntu on them means you require
machines without hard disks. Trust you've folks who can teach these
kids how to plug in drives, do diagnostics etc or check BIOS
configurations in older machines etc.

I feel getting full machines and repurposing them with Ubuntu OS would
be a more manageable route.

Baskar,
Thanks for the quick and positive response.
I checked the link to find a site that is under construction. Shall keep
checking.
Meanwhile is a there another source from where I could get Ubuntu software
resources?

Balu,
I hear you. Valid obstacles indeed.
Which is why I'm writing to this community. If there are people who are
willing to help with the initial training, I should like to meet them and
take this project forward.
Hope to continue hearing from you.

Mohan,
I've done this with a group of students and I agree that most find the task
of clearing hard drives and installing the OS a chore.
However it could be done by a few while the rest of the group works on
other aspects of the project.
But yes, I do see the advantage of working with machines that already have
the OS.

What does 're-purposing' mean?
Am fascinated by the way people use words - so would appreciate a
clarification, in case I haven't understood.

These could be windows machines. One still has to format and load Ubuntu.

Re-purposing is just used to indicate making it usable for another purpose.

Hi Padmini,

Welcome to the ILUGC mailing list. Imho, what you are trying to do is a
very good thing, so my best wishes for the same.

Re-purposing means reusing for a different purpose. What Mohan was
trying to say is that, instead of targetting hard drives for the
installation of Ubuntu, you could get a full computer and repurpose it
by installing Ubuntu on it. That way you don't have to install Ubuntu on
hard drives hoping that it would work fine. If it didn't, you might be
requiring the correct drivers to be installed. This is because it is
better to install the OS on the computer where it is going to be used as
the OS installer will take care of installing the appropriate drivers
for the particular hardware.

I am located in Mumbai.

I am willing to participate in this activity.

I will try and take care of my expenditures (Not all FOSS activists are rich).

But I am fundamentally a core Centos (10 years support by Redhat) person.

HTH.

Great initiative. I suppose Ubuntu is a very reliable OS and stable
platform for new comers. One question here - Is Unity under
consideration? I thought, it could be bit daunting for new comers. I
could be wrong here.
Any considerations for other desktop flavors of Ubuntu, like, Kubuntu
or even Linux Mint with MATE or XFCE (older hardware) could be a
possible choice.
I think, latest Mint even supports offline driver installation for
certain hardware. (wifi)

Hi Guruprasad,
Thanks for the positive message.
I've worked with students in another part of the world who got such a
project going. It is now in its eight year.
Had wonderful support from an Ubuntu FOSS activist there, which made all
the difference.

Am wondering if such support is possible here as well. Hence this thread.

Thanks for the definition. Am learning.......

Hi Rajagopal,
Mumbai is one of the places I hope to see this happen as well.
If the expenditure is about travel, you won't have to do so as this project
could be set up in more than one city.

CentOS people could work with Ubuntu OS as well, yes?

Thanks for the positive response Anand.
You lost me on the technical stuff of course.
Me, I'm strictly non-technical - more about the idea, the possibility of
applications within a community and how young people could learn from the
projects.
That's why I'd turn to you all for the tech support.

I'm in Bangalore. Can muster up my nephew too for this.

Anand was talking of more friendly interfaces than the default that
Ubuntu offers i.e unity. Linux Mint has good reviews and is easy for
windows users to migrate to.

I guess you missed reading the part of my previous email which talks

please do read it once before you send your next reply in this thread.

Hi Guruprasad,
Looks like I did.
Am now working on figuring out how to post the 'correct way'. Will take a
while, so will post back when I've figured it out.
Appreciate your pointing out this error.

It depends on the interest, experience of the individual, and the
nature of work involved.

If the task is independent of the distribution and the individual has
the required skills, then it is possible to get work done.

If the task is specific to a distribution, and the individual is
interested to learn and get things done, it shouldn't be a problem.
Otherwise, you will need to find the right resource.

IMO, the first steps should be to see what hardware is available, what
the students already know, and what topics you would like addressed.

IMHO, please dispense away with the "local" hard disk concept and go
the LTSP (Linux Terminal Server Project) way.
Baskar, who has already participated in this thread,  has a lot of
experience with LTSP as well as thin clients and he is located in
Greater Chennai.

1. Maintain "desktop" servers that caters to the interest of the
student body -- let them learn the software first and then get them
into the hardware aspects.   Others have discussed the pros/cons
vis-a-vis  the desktop choice.

2. The 'local' disks can be bunched together to create "storage"
servers and/or create on premise "cloud" storage like ownCloud.

3. Also suggest, filter out students into "developer" and "admin"
tracks based on their aptitude, the mindset required for them is
different IMO.   Let those with "admin" aptitude delve into
sysadmin/netadmin and those with "developer" aptitude go into simple
application development.

4. Take the KISS (Keep It Simple and Stupid) approach and build upon that.

I am confident that we will discover a few nuggets in this initiative.

Best,

Whatever brand/model we may give is most likely outdated and you may
not be able to find it in the market.

Instead, I suggest, you contact *all* the local laptop vendors and
tell them you want a system with "DOS" OS or "No operating system" and
see what they come up with.

IIRC, Toshiba/HP do have laptops with "DOS"

Forget high end machines (e.g. i7, 8GB RAM); they are preloaded with Windows.

Thanks for the idea Mr. Arun.  Earlier, me too had the idea of
suggesting LTSP for old computers.   Hope your detailed mail would
have given enough idea for the OP to decide for thinclient based
setup.

Also filter the 'end user' types into a separate category/categories:

 1. The artists who'll want to play with Gimp / InkScape / Blender
 2. The managers / communicators who like to play with spreadsheets,
presentations etc.

They might not fall in the dev and admin categories.

@ Mr. Khan,

Mr.  Senan, has not asked for any specific configuration, promoting "DOS
OS" / "No Operating System" machine is not good option & idea,  because of
only high end machines only comes with preloaded with windows.


@ Mr. Senan,

Here is flipkart link [1], selling machines with pre-installed Ubuntu,
match your desire configuration,  though Mr.  Karthikeyan has already
shared raw formula for the same. This will help you to also lowering down
cost of machine compare to same model with other proprietary os. You can
also visit local vendors and ask for the same.

Guys,

I have written library ( Ruby gem ) for project_madurai (

title and author from that html page, and create cover image with these
values.

It was working fine. But i am facing some issue while working with this. I
am using Lohit font ( tamil version ). Font is not rendered properly in
cover image. Actual font is not problem, but when i render in image via
Rmagick or Imagemagick, it looks bad ( check sample image in below link:
word ????????? )

Let me know if anybody got/solved this issue. I can't find solution from
search engine.

Hi

Most of you must already know about the Google Cardboard based VR headset.
It is a virtual reality headset, which you can use along with your
smartphone to have an immersive experience with supported apps, like 3d
navigation, hubble space walk  and many 3d games are also available. more
info about is here http://g.co/cardboard

There's also a SDK launched by google, using it you can make apps for the
headset.

I got excited about it and decided to get it made in bulk, so that others
who are also interested in India, can try it out to. You can buy it too

 I am trying to build a TTS - Text To Speech - in Tamil.

<http://goinggnu.wordpress.com/2014/03/13/looking-for-sound-files-for-tamil-tts>
/

I can split the words now.

There is a software in PHP which can convert Tamil text to IPA.

http:// <http://anunaadam.appspot.com>anunaadam.appspot.com

You can find the source code here: https://
<https://github.com/virtualvinodh/anunaadam>github.com
<https://github.com/virtualvinodh/anunaadam>/
<https://github.com/virtualvinodh/anunaadam>virtualvinodh
<https://github.com/virtualvinodh/anunaadam>/
<https://github.com/virtualvinodh/anunaadam>anunaadam
<https://github.com/virtualvinodh/anunaadam>

Using your code, we can convert Text to IPA.

Hope we can get the sound files for IPA or we can record.

Once we get all the Sound files, we can do

Tamil->IPA->Play sound files.

Thus, we can build a TTS system.

Planning to do in Python.

Reply here if anyone is interested to join and contribute to this project.

Thanks to Vinodh Rajan - vinodh AT virtualvinodh.com
For sharing the Tamil ->IPA conversion code.

any specific area needed?

Check the code here,
https://github.com/virtualvinodh/anunaadam

https://github.com/virtualvinodh/anunaadam/blob/master/ipa.php
https://github.com/virtualvinodh/anunaadam/blob/master/transliteration.php

It converts a given tamil text to IPA code.

See the live demo here.
http://anunaadam.appspot.com

We have to implement the same in python.

Will be nice, if someone check the ipa.php and transliteration.php and
redo them as a python library.

The Kerala Legislative Assembly[1] (Kerala state , India) as of July
17, 2014 produces all its documentation, both printed and digital, on
a Free Software platform using Libreoffice .  Hon. Speaker announced
in Legislative assembly yesterday . The point which makes this
undertaking unique is the fact that the complete documentation at the
Niyamasabha is done in Malayalam, a complex text indic scipt

The migration process is implemented with the support of  Zyxware
Technologies[2] in association with ICFOSS[3], a govt centre to
promote foss  and Swathanthra Malayalam Computing(SMC)[4] , a FOSS
developer community working on Indian Language support and
localizations.

See below poster .

https://www.facebook.com/SMC.Project/posts/751600641550557

Some media reports about the same is published in vernacular language
press and it is available here

http://www.madhyamam.com/news/298250/140716
http://www.eastcoastdaily.com/2014/07/16/free-software/

The migration was in the light of Government of Kerala's recent order
announced its intention to transition computers in the Departments,
institutions and PSUs under it to Free and Open Source platforms, in
the opportunity caused due to expiry of support period to Windows XP.
[5]

International centre for free and open source software(ICFOSS) has
brought out a Handbook last month to support the process of migration

We are trying to build a spell checker for tamil using hunpell.

https://github.com/tamiliam/Solthiruthi2

https://github.com/tamiliam/Solthiruthi2/wiki

For that we need a huge list of root words in tamil.

Root words may have people names, city names, verbs, etc.

To collect them manually is a huge task.

Thinking of a browser plugin, where a reader of any tamil blog, Wikipedia
page, or social media can select a word and tag it with relevant part of
speech and send to a central server.

By this way, any tamil reader can contribute to build the huge list of root
words.

Looking for volunteers for building the central web application and Firefox
or chrome plugin to collect data.

Reply here if you are interested to contribute.

Thanks.

The wheels are in motion!

After a month of voting and an exhausting review process, the first
set of confirmed talks are out.  Head over to the funnel (
http://in.pycon.org/funnel/2014/ ) to see them.  All the workshops
have been finalized and we will be opening the workshop tickets by
21st of July.  The talk selection process is still under way and the
final list will be announced tentatively by the end of July.

A gazillion thanks to all of you who voted and took your time to
comment on the proposals.  We urge you to continue the communication
with the selected speakers so that they can work towards fine tuning
their presentations.

Bet that is incentive enough for many of you who are still thinking of
purchasing a ticket.  Get your tickets now !

I am now contributing to Firefox OS Tamil localizations, as a part of that
we are trying to build a auto-correction mechanism for Tamil keyboard.
A professor named Kevin helped us in that process by giving a word list for
Tamil.
I think that should help you. Word list here :

Message-ID: <CAND2794KrfJT18f2NZWWZQCQ9ttNeNaKRJJCqgnfZEn+hLnCfg@mail.gmail.com>

Mininet is a network emulator which creates a network of virtual
hosts, switches, controllers, and links. Mininet hosts run standard
Linux network software, and its switches support OpenFlow for highly
flexible custom routing and Software-Defined Networking.

Mininet supports research, development, learning, prototyping,
testing, debugging, and any other tasks that could benefit from having
a complete experimental network on a laptop or other PC.

Mininet:

Provides a simple and inexpensive network testbed for developing
OpenFlow applications

Enables multiple concurrent developers to work independently on the
same topology

Supports system-level regression tests, which are repeatable and easily packaged

Enables complex topology testing, without the need to wire up a physical network

Includes a CLI that is topology-aware and OpenFlow-aware, for
debugging or running network-wide tests

Supports arbitrary custom topologies, and includes a basic set of
parametrized topologies

is usable out of the box without programming, but

also Provides a straightforward and extensible Python API for network
creation and experimentation



Mininet provides an easy way to get correct system behavior (and, to
the extent supported by your hardware, performance) and to experiment
with topologies.

Mininet networks run real code including standard Unix/Linux network
applications as well as the real Linux kernel and network stack
(including any kernel extensions which you may have available, as long
as they are compatible with network namespaces.)

Because of this, the code you develop and test on Mininet, for an
OpenFlow controller, modified switch, or host, can move to a real
system with minimal changes, for real-world testing, performance
evaluation, and deployment. Importantly this means that a design that
works in Mininet can usually move directly to hardware switches for
line-rate packet forwarding.

Nice link, however if you could please let me know what are the difference
between ns3 vs gns3 vs mininet ?   They seem to be almost similar.  If yes
what are the pros and cons.

Hello friends,

Glad to announce that we are all set to conduct a Rails workshop on the
first weekend of August. It will be a full day event with curriculum
similar to the RailsGarden workshop (thanks Dheeraj).

The target audience is a Rails newbies. Over the past several meet-ups,
nearly 50% attendees were complete newbies, so there have been quite a few
requests for activities relevant to them. Newbie enthusiasm has been so
consistent we almost owe them a workshop like this.

Here are the some details:
Venue: Spritle Software (Thanks Balaji)
Date: 2-Aug-2014
Seats: 15-20
Laptops: please bring your own.
Registration: http://chennairb-rails-workshop.herokuapp.com

We'll need more coaches and coordinators. If you are experienced with Rails
and have the weekend free, please do join us. Just post on this thread, or
buzz Vysakh/Steve/myself anytime.

If this workshop works out well, we'll try making it a regular event. The
meet-ups will continue as usual - second/third weekend of every month.

Regards,
Abhishek

Subject: [Ilugc] Help required in kernel module development
Message-ID: <CAJK=4YbjFbPQT01q3BwMP_koQjTDc1d1X+-xHTaeaBcXbe6+KQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am working on the task 05 of the "Eudyptula Challenge" where i have
to write a kernel module which gets invoked when keyboard is plugged
into the usb.

When i plug in the keyboard, the kernel is reporting keyboard but my
module is not getting loaded.

The kernel iam using for testing is 3.15 and my module design is based
on the following article
http://www.opensourceforu.com/2011/10/usb-drivers-in-linux-1/

In the article "cat /proc/bus/usb/devices" is executed to find which
kernel module is for a particular device , but the kernel i had built
did not show any such path.

I had added a udev rule but that too did not help. I tried using
strace still i was not able to identify the problem.

I would like to know what steps should i follow to debug this issue
and module code is present in the following link

https://github.com/selvagit/little_penguin/blob/master/task_05/hello.c

Thanks,
Selvaraj

Firstly, that was a well-written e-mail.

Where in the kernel was the keyboard reported?

\--

This was released in June 2014.

This documentation is written in 2011.

You need to search on how to load USB drivers in Linux kernel 3.15 version.

ns3, gns3 are network simulators.
ns2/3 -  simulate your network devices and runs protocols. Its logical
simulation.
gns3 -   runs the actual network device (software) , you should give the
device image(cisco ios image) to  run the device and connects the topology.
mininet =  linux containers + openvswitch+traffic . just a python framework
to create a topology and runs.
I remember, i have taken a SDN session with mininet a year back in ILUGC
monthly meet.

udev generally loads the usb keyborad driver when a keyboard is connected.
So you cannot expect that your driver is loaded automatically. Writing a
udev should solve this I guess.

Thank you, any pros and cons ?

I have worked only on GNS3 so

One con from GNS3 is that you system would start struggling if it is not a
hefty build.

One Pro of GNS3 is you could take SDM or ASDM or router or PIX firewall.

Message-ID: <CAND2795z0FM81t_eQG8oCTTine+utG1aRE_Z3Eu1vh2js3ES3g@mail.gmail.com>

We are planning for a python hackathon at DGV arts & science college,
chennai.

The students learnt python already.

To make them contribute to Free Software, I had a discussion with HOD,
to conduct a one day hackathon.

There are 40 students and we can give a 50 programs for students to pick
one and do in that 6 hours span.

I have the following list.

1. scrap a flipkart.com and get rate of a given peoduct
2. resize some huge size photos and add some text to all the images.
3. get two dates and calculate the no of days between them.
4. upload images to flickr using flickr api
5. auto mate blog posting using wordpress api
6. analyse a apache log file and get statistics from it.
7. create a solver for crossword puzzles using the given no of words and
few letters
8. Download picture of the day from http://commons.wikimedia.org and make
it as wallpaper or a widget
9. test a website for its availability. send mail to some people, if the
site is down
10. backup all files in /var/www/html and databases and store in a remote
place.

Reply here with more ideas.

Thanks.

I am neither a programmer or developer. I am not sure if these are too easy
/ challenging tasks for students (with Python). I am even not sure even if
you can do these with Python. But, here are few of my suggestions:
(You may even think like some solutions I am searching for too.... LOL)

1. Implant a set of Meta Data (variable) to a set of documents
(I mean File A1 to have Meta Data B, C, D, "A1" ; File A2 to have Meta Data
B, C+2, D*5, "A2", etc)

2. Rename a set of documents based on Meta Data

3. Extract Data from Seperate Graphs and save them as one Big File!!

4. Create a Chess / Sudoku puzzle game

5. Check for Duplicates

Message-ID: <CADDQFRsMnKo67bkzyTtUQ01KtrK9vbjDNi2wMo9fG6SptS_5WQ@mail.gmail.com>

Is epub optimal for the purpose?

http://www.flossmanuals.org/news/booktype-floss-manuals-ebooks-learning-platform-future-cetis-2014

\quote

It's a bit simplistic but here's the essential argument. (excuse the
ACRONYMS google is your friend here)

most OER are shared by the person / team that writes them

online courses, Moocs, OER repositories are increasingly the place
where OER are collaboratively written using blog type, wysiswyg tools
which output HTML pages

format specs like Scorm and metadata standards like LOM are too hard
for self publishers to use

epubs are the most suitable candidate to allow importing and exporting
of OER into these platform allowing us the freedom to exit and remix
between repositories

EDUPUB is in danger of bringing a lot of complexity to the equation
and hindering uptake
l
et's not get hung up on interactivity - let's get the workflow working
with simple epubs first and use the web coding principle of
"progressive enhancement" to bring more interactivity to OER

exported ePubs work well on mobile devices (just saying)

ePubs - all the way - let's advocate for all VLEs, MOOCs, Blogs etc to
accept import and export of ePubs

i think one day would not be enough ,  do not know if they have covered any
of the following.

1) any version control system
2) setting up Virtualenv and using it .
3) PEP 8 http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ and any other PEP
people feel are important.
4) This book
http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/i-want-2-do-project-tell-me-wat-2-do.pdf
if not already covered.
5) Special emphasis on where to look for projects and how to communicate
while asking for help.

Would it not be ironic to ask for 'permission' to screen a movie on
Aaron Swartz?

I find it interesting that 'ironic' is being used more frequently [1]
Shakthi has a valid question -
<https://archive.org/details/TheInternetsOwnBoyTheStoryOfAaronSwartz>
does not explicitly mention anything about screening for a general
audience. The movie itself is available for download under
<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/> which has its own
set of "things you can do".

The trailer was brilliant. Great effort. And animation par excellence.
Kudos to Realwork studios. Great demo for Blender.

But comparing it with the original movie is taking it too far. Neither do I
agree with most of the points given by Realwork studios in the comments
under the videos. If you look at the original trailer of kochadayaan
(sultan the warrior) it is as good as the blender demo we are discussing
about. An industry insider told me at that time itself that the movie will
never be released because the team did not have the resources (time, money
and technology) to make a 3 hour movie at that quality. My point is you
could put in incredible effort to do a 4 minute demo. But sustaining it for
3 hours requires not just great software. A lot more.

I don't want to take this discussion forward since realwork studios is not
part of this mailing list and cannot counter if I am wrong.

Regards,
Arun

If you have contacts with the animation studio who developed/produced
this segment, please ask them to fix the spelling of "proprietary" at
0:10/0:11 into the sequence.

Hi ,

> >>

The movie is available under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 . The license allows one to

   - *Share* ? copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format

And there was no monetary benefit collected out of this . And it was a free
(Free as in Free Coffee) event for participants , which

ideally satisfies the *NonCommercial * aspect of the license .

And its further mentioned in the license  that "

   - *No additional restrictions* ? You may not apply legal terms or
technological
   measures <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/#> that
   legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits."

*Note :* If at all there was a violation , its a genuine case that we might
have misunderstood the clauses of the license . In that case , please let
us know so that we can rectify them .

I have a text file with tamil words.
one word per line.


cat test.txt

Let us sort this.

cat test.txt | sort

Let us use uniq for this.

cat test.txt | sort | uniq

uniq is not working for the unicode text.

We are collecting tamil words to build a tamil spellchecker using hunspell.
We need to remove duplicate words from the collection.

The uniq is not working.

Is there any other way to find duplicate words from unicode file?

Thanks.

I visited this page in my browser and saved it using Menu->Save as. The

wget -m url should work fine.

Sometime you might be in a situation where some scripts wont allow you
to make a proper mirror/copy .
In such cases I found the mozilla addon Down them all very useful.

Hi Prasanna/Shakthi

Thanks for the reply.

I was not able to get back since some how the custom kernel which i have built
is not booting properly, i am in the process of resolving the issue.

As Prassana mentioned i looked up the driver loaded when keyboard was
connected using

Hi Arun,

If you have to save a large number of pages automatically from a certain 
website, use *HTTrack Website Copier* available from http://httrack.com. 
It gives you an exact copy of website(With all images, IF you have 
specified the correct domain name from where image is served, and IF the 
image is not dynamically served).
     Browse the downloaded website's directory structure for your image.

In case you have to save one or more open pages, use the Mozilla Firefox 
addon *Mozilla Archive Format, with MHT and Faithful Save* available 
from 
http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mozilla-archive-format/. 
This one gives you an exact and faithful copy of the pages as you have 
viewed online. It even preserves the dynamically served ads.
     Open the saved archive with *7-zip*(http://7-zip.org) to get your 
image.

Regards,
Arun GP

Hi all,
The training was very informative. I gained new and/or expanded my
knowledge. Many of them have missed it. None of them will teach you the
role based skills. The presenter was  knowledgeable and helpful. I would
recommend the training to everyone who  is keen on learning things on
Linux. Don't   try to be a Linux admin. Be an expert at something.
SYSOPMINDS, the place where you can be. Thanks to Mr. Ganesh Hariharan and
Mr. Nivin.

involved with maker parties, teaching Appmaker and lot of other things.

To help application developers in developing open web apps, we would like
to create a consolidated pool of app ideas in the Google form shared below,

Subject: [Ilugc] How to create cover images for all the ebooks in
	ProjectMadurai.org ?
Message-ID: <CAND2795Kd_APFcZA1vt2-S689xsa8unM3_ejWdp6DXXCuB2Kcg@mail.gmail.com>

We are planning to convert all the ebooks in http://ProjectMadurai.org
as epub files, so that any one can read them on the latest devices
like andoid and ios devices.

We will be using http://pressbooks.com to convert them as ebub.
There are around 500 ebooks.

We are looking for volunteers to convert them all as epub and mobi.

In the meantime, They all need cover images.

On my request, sathia tried a rails app.

https://github.com/sathia27/project_madurai


But, it got unicode issue.

I tried using python to add a tamil text over a image.

The Tamil Text is displayed as splitted.

Sample Image: http://postimg.org/image/8z7ed377r/

http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc/84982



I too got the same issue what sathia gets.


Then, How to solve this?

This seems a great unicode issue and there is no programmable solution.

Here comes the power utilities of GNU/Linux.
when programming cant help much, shell can help.

There is a utility called "wkhtmltopdf" which can convert html as PDF.

Shall we create html pages with all the book name and author name details?
Then, we can convert as PDF.
Then, PDF to image.

Will it work?

I Installed wkhtmltopdf and tried.
In my latest ubuntu, wkhtmltopdf is installed, but it is too old.
Got some issues like "Not compiled with QT support".

We have to get the latest binaries from its website.

Download wkhtmltopdf from http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html

The websites gives latest binary with QT binding.
The one that comes with ubuntu in default is very old.

Download it from the site and install it.

It gives two utilities. 1. wkhtmltopdf  2. wkhtmltoimage

We use wkhtmltoimage to convert the html files into images.


Example :

wkhtmltoimage --height 640 --width 429  001.html 001.jpg




Using this method, we can convert all the html files to images directly.


Here is the detailed workflow:



1. Get all the book names,author name from
http://www.projectmadurai.org/pmworks.html

2. Copy them into a LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet.

3. Add serial number in a new front column.

4. Export as CSV file. Put $ as the delimeter.

5. Run the file parser.py

python parser.py


It will extract the book name, author and generate html files, with a
background image for the cover art.


6. Download wkhtmltopdf from http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html and install


7. Now, using a small shell script, we can convert all the html files
into images.

for i in *.html; do wkhtmltoimage --height 640 --width 429 $i
`basename $i .html`.jpg; done



Thats all.
We get all the images.


Background Image source:
http://pixabay.com/en/grey-background-texture-template-370125/
License     Public Domain CC0


Uploaded all the generated cover images here:
https://picasaweb.google.com/tshrinivasan/ProjectMaduraiCoverImages?noredirect=1


The source code repo:
https://github.com/tshrinivasan/project-madurai-cover-images



Now, we have all the cover images.
We need volunteers to work on creating ebooks for all the books on
http://ProjectMadurai.org

Contact me if you are interested in volunteering this.

Thanks.

This method internally creates html file with title, author and other
attributes and then it will take screenshot with help of phantomjs. Check
http://phantomjs.org/. you can look source code in
https://github.com/sathia27/project_madurai

So it is release as gem. You can just install this library and run to
generate images ( check project page for installation ).

Hi Sathish,

There is no Google Map api restriction for browsers. I think the problem
might be in your source code. Could you please share your source
code(JQuery/JS & HTML)? Then only i can review it, later i'll update you
regarding the browser issue.
