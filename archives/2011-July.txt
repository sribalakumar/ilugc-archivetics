The FOSS Lab Manual Part 1 is now available for download.

http://foss-lab-manual.googlecode.com/files/foss-lab-manual-p1-1.0.pdf

A reference to ILUGC has been included in the credits sections, as
suggested by Shrini. The FOSS Lab Manual project details have been
included, as suggested by Shakti Kannan. The download URLs (for disk
images) in the manual, have been modified to point to the project
download page, for now.

  Sorry for the delayed response...
  i have followed the steps in the above link, except that, i have not
changed the document root to
  /srv/www/  and so i have not created symbolic links
 instead i have left my project files reside at  /var/www/htm/project1 ,
project2...

 i have created a vhost.conf in the path /etc/httpd/conf.d/vhost.conf.
 here is the contents...

NameVirtualHost *:80

<virtualhost *:80>
      ServerAdmin admin at gmail.com
      DocumentRoot /var/www/html/dev_setup/
      ServerName dev_setup
      ServerAlias www.dev_setup.com
   </virtualhost>
   <virtualhost *:80>
      ServerAdmin admin at gmail.com
      DocumentRoot /var/www/html/cefpress.com/
      ServerName  cefpress.com
      ServerAlias cefpress.com
   </virtualhost>
   <virtualhost *:80>
      ServerAdmin admin at gmail.com
      DocumentRoot /var/www/html/dev.bobstores.com/
      ServerName dev.bobstores.com
      ServerAlias dev.bobstores.com
   </virtualhost>


and the entries in the /etc/hosts file are ...

127.0.0.1 wks17.isinfotech.com wks17 localhost.localdomain localhost
localhost4
::1 wks17.isinfotech.com wks17 localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6
127.0.0.1 localhost localhost
127.0.0.1 www.dev_setup.com dev_setup
127.0.0.1 www.cefpress.com cefpress.com
127.0.0.1 dev.bobstores.com   dev.bobstores.com



Now i am able to view the virtual sites,  as
http://dev_setup/
http://cefpress.com
http://dev.bobstores.com

but not able to view the sites which i create at /var/www/html/
 for example
 if create a new project at mobilesite at /var/www/html/mobilesite

and try to access it as http://localhost/mobilesite/

i get the following error  - " The requested URL /mobilesite was not found
on this server. "

do i need add corresponding entry to the /etc/httpd/conf.d/vhost.conf and
/etc/hosts files.?

Please let me know.
Thanks in Advance.

What is your DocumentRoot now? Also, check your apache error logs to
see what information it is giving.

I am currently looking for talks on android (a basic introduction) and 
bit coin ( http://www.bitcoin.org/ ). If someone could share their 
knowledge on the same, It will be very helpful.

I can do the bitcoin part. But expect it to be boring and very confusing!! I
can give also a very basic primer of android, the SDK, etc. Nothing hardcore
though.

Attempt to explain in a nutshell:

There are lots of projects "hosted" in so called "repositories" that hold
various versions of source code. You use a "version control system" to check
the code out (download) and then after making modifications, you push it
back into the repository (check-in).

Contributions can be anything. Some are:

* Bug reports / fixes (You'll need to look into "bug tracker" for the
project !
* Patches
* Documentation (of the final product as well as the internals like any
APIs, etc.) and translations

Search for terms you don't understand. HTH.

"isinfotech.com", "cefpress.com" and "bobstores.com"   are legitimate
active domains.  Unless you or the company you work for, has been
contracted to do work for the owners of the said domains,   you should
avoid them.  Instead "example.{org,com,net}  can be used for such
purposes.

I believe you need to define a **default**  virtual host which is missing - see:

Hello all,
I am writing this mail to invite those who are interested to lend
their hand for the Tamil Wikipedia CD project. Details of the project
can be seen here[1]. Technically we are reusing the wiki2cd[2]-
tool(set of python / shell scripts) to generate the CD with certain
customizations / few add ons. The alpha code is available here[3]
Please let me know if you are could help out. HTML CSS JS Shell /
Python scripting helps. Feel free to fork / report issues.

Kenneth,

How come you can say this? Can you please elaborate your thoughts? It
would be great if you *always* add few more details to your response
than responding mostly in just a word or a sentence to the list.

If Balaji's thought is wrong, can you please add your thoughts here
then. Your * 3 WORDS* response isn't useful to the list. I believe
it's just your thought.

A very nice effort vis-a-vis a quick intro to topics.

Is this going to be the final content is something more planned?  For
the latter case, may I suggest that you put in the place holder
(heading and sub headings).   Also a list of "Further Reading"  (as
Reference) would be helpful for the curious to explore.

I hope the original manuscript is written in Docbook or equivalent
(better) tools; can publish in multiple formats like HTML, PDF, RTF
etc.

My two cents.

Message-ID: <CA+MGHirvLj3wq5o38qtvBNWwi46k5SM_Qb+PL7xc3Hz0DPwEqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ilugc's,

I have seen from my experience in software based corporate world that
most opening are for developers are for java programmers atleast so
till recently in indian software firms (i am not considering the non
OSS world and also i think that java is now a more OSS than not )
afaik. Then how come PHP comes here
http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language/all
listed as the most popular web server side scripting(SSS) language.
And i do agree that it most be most popular SSS language. Since it was
designed to be like that. But isn't java also popular for its SSS
capabilties ? And isnt that what these software firms are after when
they say they are looking for java developers. Isn't there a tons of
framework and libraries for this SSS of java. Is these figures of java
nowhere near to that PHP. I know there exists pear in php as cpan in
perl. But still the hype these java devs bring about in my exp is no
where near those of any other language. I know java exists for its
mobile and embedded capabilites. Can someone add more clarity provided
you are sure of what you are taking about. i say this since i see that
as days keeps going on the noise to signal ratio is going high (more
noise than signal). Please pardon me if you find this bad. (my
memories of yr 2004 of this list when i joined to this list does this
to me ). I am a sys admin with some level of bash scripting exp. So i
am unware of this java thing capabilites level or the PHP capabilites
levels. I know one thing for sure that bash cannot scale upto these
progs. levels as it was not meant to be on the web or do things that
these things do. It is good at what it does best (automating jobs
normally done by hand and probably good at plain text prosessing.
Since most conf files and log files in Linux are text based)

We know that apache http web server is THE most popular web server in
the market by a huge margin. I know apache http server quite well in
the sense that i worked on it quite a long enough to understand every
configuration option to a decent level and to read from its access and
error logs. Now the question is , i see from this site
http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Web_Server_Performance_Comparison which i
think is pretty true, is that apache does not perform equally as its
newer cousins of nginx & lighttpd when it comes to performance when
overloaded. So i wanted to know is it b'cos it has been in existance
for a long time that code has become huge and difficult for anyone to
optimise it and it is further compounded by the fact that it has
support the huge number of modules that are grown on top of it and it
has to support those ? and that the software is being used widely and
it does want to disappoint its user base by changing it dramiticaly
for performance reasons ? If this is true then it would mean the same
thing would appear in any software that existed for long . or is this
one of the understood and non written part of software life cycle. I
have read the mythical man month and it doesn't say this or may be it
was too early for him to comment on this ?


Can somebody give me a good link other than wikipedia (which i think
is not updated for long, even wikipedia says this at certain spots) on
google's hardware infrastructure for its data centre. I know google
builds its own custom hardware based on commodity hardware on the
calculation of price per performance. So what interest me is which
combination of comodity hardware provides this. Since i would like to
buy or build a PC for my own if i have these data. Second it would
have better understanding of hardware. Similar to the one of the goals
of GPL's that exposure to huge code will have a good impact on the
coder to do better code, i think it has a similar effect on exposure
to infrastructure at Data centre level would have good impact on any
upcomming sys admin interested in that field. I know there are a huge
lot of sites dedicated to software and discussion about software. But
i am more interested in latest happening on hardware that drives this
software. Can you guys point to me them. I mean something like the
thunderbolt technology that intel released which i read few months
back in intel website . it is supposed to put network data transfer on
a super fast lane.

with regards,
ashwin

FOSS is a child of the web, which makes collaboration possible. Without
collaboration the whole of FOSS would not exist. And please explain how
to collaborate without version control?

facebook runs on nginx proxied to a pure python webserver (tornado) and

Message-ID: <CA+WoLTn-xtz8j_oYyHNgu6scX1mNhgS747JcBH9QTYaikTp_6Q@mail.gmail.com>

I have Dell vostro 1320 and from the day I bought this laptop wireless card
has been showing weird characteristic in my Ubuntu box while in windows it
was alwas fine. when I first installed Ubuntu 9.04 the wireless button acted
weird
when it was ON and then i use to log on to ubuntu it din't show wirless
networks ( in fact theres a indicator which dint use to light) but if i use
to log on to
ubuntu w/ hard switch off and after loggin in i use to ON it then it use to
work fine... I tried hard finding problem for this and found few solutions
too which can be seen in following threads


http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11001662#post11001662

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1594577

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1593649


but with the release of 11.04 the solutions are not working.
*
sudo rmmod -f dell-laptop


sudo su
echo "blacklist dell-laptop" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
exit*

was the solution and after that it was smooth for my dell laptop to detect
the wireless networks...
now I am stuck with Natty as this is not working..
Am I doing something stupid somewhere? or just missing something?
Please suggest.

Suggests buggy code; it happens.

Unless there is a compelling reason to upgrade, it is advisable to
stick with a version that works for you.   Maybe the "dell-laptop"
module is fixed in the new release and you can give it a try.

Laptops are quirky beasts (compared to desktops); even though they are
"x86" machines.   WiFi is the most quirky amongst the peripheral
devices.

You need to provide us with more details, such as,

- What do u use for internet, Wifi or LAN cable or USB modem ?
- Do you see any particular error ?
- What does Network Manager say (default: top-right of your screen) ?

Also, let us know your skill level so that the suggestions aren't too 
technical.

Here is the link:
http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/cities/chennai/profs-get-laptop-modules-ready-521

I think these professors are developing the modules for Windows Based and i
think we have to be faster than them and should provide appropriate
and world-class content for the Students.
Few days back i have read the mail from Mr. Narendra Sisodiya, that he and
his Co are working on Educational apps for this free Laptops.

Thank you for reading this mail.

Let us assume that you are right and you are the only person going to be
contributing to your software. Even then,  without the version history
and a clean record of the fixes you did and the rationale behind them, 
you are likely to forget them and end up having to figure out why the
heck you changed something a few months down the line   Also,  if this
is free and open source software, it can end up getting used in
surprising ways and sometimes long after you lost interest.  Having
version control that captures the changes goes a long way towards the
feasibility of someone else taking over.   I strongly believe that using
version control is absolutely necessary as a basic tool regardless of
the size of the software.  With software like etc-keeper, you can store
even changes in /etc/ configuration files in version control with a
apt-get or yum plugin and this too is quite handy

Subject: [Ilugc] Making two finger tap work as middle click
Message-ID: <1309800902.9100.4.camel@mjolnir>

Hello, everyone,

I'm trying to get a two-finger tap to work as middle-click on my laptop
touchpad. It's a Synaptics touchpad. On Ubuntu 9.04 this is how it
worked, but as any Gnome user knows, things like this will get changed
to some absurd default without any means to edit because that's what the
Gnome philosophy is.

All the solutions on the Internet use synclient. The problem with this
is that synclient needs to be run at boot, after waking from suspend,
and after logging in. Occasionally, it will stop working and require a
reboot before it starts.

Any advice would be helpful. I remember there being a gconf entry in
some earlier release that allowed me to switch back to more usable
settings but it seems to be missing. I'm beginning to regret upgrading,
but I had no choice: they removed the old repositories.

Regards,
Roshan

Check your /etc/exports file. Have you given permission to mount /opt/ltsp?

 I don't use Ubuntu and I don't have a Vostro  :(  It was more as a
general suggestion.  You need to find that out for Ubuntu.

Create a group and give that group sudo access to "synclient".   Add
all your laptop users to that group.

Your question is vague.

If you have not already read about Linux filesystems, then the first
place to start would be the basic ACL of the Linux file system - i.e.
owner, group, other permissions.  Move on to sticky bit.  Create
groups and make users members of such groups etc.  Most FS for Linux
also have extended attributes e.g. for ext2/3/4 you can use chattr and
lsattr.

Search the web for step by step tutorials on above topic.

This feature is available in Gnome as well. However, I wished to merely
tap my fingers on the touchpad. It's much easier than pressing both
buttons and allows me to scroll (with 2 fingers) and copy paste easily.
I understand this is possible in KDE as well, but not in Gnome.

Sadly, I don't know of a way to detect when the computer is returning
from sleep. Running the script manually is inelegant and frustrating.

Anyway, while searching through bug lists for this, I found Yuri Khan's
PPA: https://launchpad.net/~yurivkhan/+archive/ppa . Apparently, the
story is that the Gnome developers, in their infinite wisdom, decided
that gnome-settings-daemon must ignore hal and ignore the driver's
recommendations, implement its own hard-coded defaults, and finally not
provide any gconf settings to switch this back. The recommended
solution, apparently, is to upgrade to Gnome 3.2.

Fortunately, our hero, Yuri Khan, has patched g-s-d to act in a sane
manner. Praise be to him.

Could someone please explain the difference between the vmlinuz, zImage, and
bzImage kernel images?

Message-ID: <CALVLwtaoJsd0XWVdDDqn5okprhoj1+Ea-4++Y_Zd+vaJ0R-ooQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear guys,

I am looking for a network monitoring solution with Inventory which includes
both software and hardware.

I have tried OpenNMS and Zabbix in which NMS is very good but they are not
fetching the hardware and software information in the clients.
In both we need to give manual entry for everything. When I looked out the
OCS inventory it is very good.

I can understand that the first 2 products are in NMS track and the 3rd one
is in Inventory track.  please suggest me is there any NMS application which
can pull the inventory automatically and fills the asset info of every
client.

Hi all,

How would you all like to contribute to an open letter asking the Union Home
Ministry, The National informatics agency, and the like to start using open
source instead of proprietary software? It's a shame that most sites
including those of National investigation agency, National security guards (
both were hacked very recently ), etc still use IIS. Seriously, IIS? And
heaven knows why there was data in those servers that could be "siphoned
off". So I was thinking writing an open letter to those douc***ags in plain
english on what this is all about and how and why they should rethink about
using proprietary software that rely on security by obscurity.

Please share your views.

Writing an open letter is all fine, but you have to think from their 
shoes. These companies are led by bureaucrats who haven't been trained 
in god knows how long and they simply don't know any better in most 
cases. Most junior-level employees who can effect changes don't have any 
power to do so or the will to fight the system.

If you go and meet these guys, the response will most likely be, "thanks 
for bringing it to our attention. So who can set this up and give us 
SLAs, and where do we sign?". So unless you're approaching them with a 
reasonably complete solution that addresses this problem, you can mostly 
expect as much animosity as you're showing them in return.

So instead of writing them an accusatory open letter that is only likely 
to get them even more defensive, try meeting any of them and ask, "this 
is what I do for a living, how can I help?". That would help you 
understand the challenges they're dealing with, and help you propose a 
more meaningful solution.


Vamsee.

My PoV.

1. No software is bug free.
2. There is no substitute for competent System/Network Admins, DBAs,
Pen testing etc.  irrespective of the OS platform.
3. The org must have policies w.r.t to system (hw and sw) maintenance.

Points 2 and 3 were severely lacking in the DR situations that I have
been involved in, which BTW were Unix/Linux servers.

IMO, you should make a case for points 2 and 3 rather than making a
case against any specific product.

My two cents.

Vamsee,

I can't agree more with your point. There are people the government can turn
to for help in these matters. I can think of CDAC and NRCFOSS. I'm sure that
Microsoft did nothing more than to just sell them IIS. What about the guy(s)
who designed and developed the site. If it's merely a website that people
visit to learn more about the agencies, then there's not much to worry. But
if there's sensitive data that's at risk of being "siphoned off" then it's a
different story all together.

So are you meeting them to convey your concern? At least track down

AFAIK, there hasn't been any change in the ELF format, so they should 
just work. You can confirm by running readelf/file and making sure the 
version, abi version are the same.

These are just the first four chapters. The manual has been divided
into three parts, so that they can be released early to the colleges.

Sure a "Further Reading" section would be useful, we will definitely
add them up.

The manual is written in AsciiDoc, which is then converted to Docbook.

Message-ID: <1309989467.92070.YahooMailClassic@web161008.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

We run a *very* restricted website where people register with their email ids. We need to send confirmatory emails when they register. 

We were using google-apps till now but traffic has increased and we are looking for a reliable email provider to send approx ~ 100 emails per day and occasionally 500-1000 emails per day (during new customer acquisitions).

This is not SPAM as this is strictly opt-in. 

We are willing to pay standard rates and are looking for reliable email gateways and not fly-by-night operators.

Google search is not really useful as we cannot verify the authenticity. Please suggest ones that you have used in the past.

Thanks,

I have personally used jango mail(arnd. 100-200k mails in a month), and
their delivery rates are quite good.
I have heard a lot of good things about sendgrid & mailchimp. Both of these
services have a free plan, which should make it easier for you to try out.

Message-ID: <CAHRpNu3ffjMtwfF2JaxkUCMQE7_gzy6bdhcCi1vYO1RcnN-Pdw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Do we have an inventory management system software for a local kirana shop (
groceries shop/vegetable shop) which will take care of stock of shop as well
as the daily sales both at large and small scales.
This software must ideally scale to any kind of business, also should be
Free and open source software one.
We are planning it to be distributed to local shopkeepers and vendors in
northern AP, where people are in need of it.
If its in FOSS, we can even have a Telugu translation for it, which in turn
will have more widespread usage.
Lastly, it is urgently required! The earlier the better, as proprietary
people are trying to perpetuate here too.

Thanks and regards,
Rahimanuddin Shaik

Hi,

    I have CentOS 5.0 server. It acts as router. Its serving for web
application,SSH and VSFTP purposes. I have restricted iptables by mentioning
IP from where these services to be accessible. Sometimes this server is not
responding. Whenever I have this issue, its started to respond again after
restart the server. After restart the server, I have checked firewall rules
using "iptables -L". Here I can see unwanted entries which I didnt include
in iptables rules. I am afraid that server has hacked by someone.

    Kindly guide me to avoid this kind of situation.

    Thanks for your time.

Terminology please. What you are referring to is called 'cracking'.
Yes, the media has misused the term for ages.

Hacking is the art of solving challenging problems. Hackers are people
who are passionate about technology, and who take it to the next
level. Please read:

You haven't provided any logs to see what has happened to your system.

The flag you have to pass to `adduser` is `--force-badname`. For
example:

	sudo adduser cow.goat --force-badname

Worked for me on Ubuntu 11.04. Unfortunately, I'm not really aware of
the consequences of doing this. You're probably better off choosing a
different username.

How many people have access/rights to the it?
Did you check with them.
Could you run a rootkit / trojan scanner on it?

Do you have good deny all rules on it ?
The best way is to allow only few ports and deny everything else.

When the service goes funky, you should immediately check syslog and auth
logs.

Server not responding could very well be a DOS attack / Over flooding
requests.

Thanks Kenneth. I found what i was looking for years. The open compute
at facebook. i was looking for DC ops kind of thing and not a
developer centric, as i believe developer is not everything. And i
don't want to add anything here as it is likely to be considered flame
bait. And i would be happy if people didn't use this as flame bait and
instead concentrate on the next few lines.

http://opencompute.org/


This i found from the video titles "Open Compute Tech Talk - April 11,
2011 [HD] By Facebook Engineering" at
http://www.facebook.com/Engineering .
KG if you haven't seen it , you must watch. i think many here would
like it. i enjoyed it.

 If you are looking for a EDA solutions for shematics, PCB design...etc You
can go for gEDA package and also EAGLE is available in Ubuntu Software
centre (I donot know wether its the full version, but a restricted version
can help you with college projects, I used the restricted version in
Windows, it was enough).

There is also dedicated Fedora distribution called the Free Elctronic Lab
spin with a lot of tools to work with electronics.

Subject: [fedora-india] FUDCon, Fedora conference in November 4th to 6th at
COEP, Pune - India
To: Fedora India <india at lists.fedoraproject.org>


Hi

[For wider redistribution]

The Fedora Project leader has announce yesterday, July 7th that FUDCon
will happen in Pune in November 4th to 6th in COEP college

http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/announce/2011-July/002981.html

More details about the event is at

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:India_2011

We would like this event to be the largest FUDCon ever, in terms of
breadth and quality of the talks as well as participation and a great
audience.  I need help and if you are interested in participating as a
speaker or hackfest contributor or organizing the event or helping find
co-sponsors and anything else, do get in touch with me.   If you have
any questions or feedback,  feel free to ask me as well.

A bit of background for the curious (warning: long read):

FUDCon is in a typical and a long held hacker tradition, a play of words
and a dual acronym FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt or Fedora Users and
Developers) and Con (Against or Conference). So you can read it as
either Fedora Users and Developers Conference or against FUD.

FUDCon is the Fedora Users and Developers Conference, a major free
software event originally envisioned in US as a means of putting
together contributors and planning for the next release of Fedora and
then later extended in a more elaborate conference, that happens
globally and each major region (APAC,  EMEA,  LATAM and NA) gets to host
one event per year.

FUDCon in APAC has only happened once before in Delhi in 2006 as part of
the Linux Asia conference

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Archive:FUDCon:FUDConDelhi2006

Over the years, FUDCon has transitioned from a simple conference like
the one in 2006 with a list of talks to a international event with three
things:

 * A barcamp-style conference
(http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon_barcamp)
 * A hackfest (http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon_hackfest)
 * A FUDPub social evening (http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDPub)

Each year, the regional ambassadors and contributors in a particular
region can put together a proposal and bid for the venue to selected
according to the process outlined at

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon_bid_process

This year, we put up a proposal and had a competing bid from China and
we have won the bidding process based on the more mature community here
in India that we have grown over the years as well as the detailed
proposal we put together in a short period. There have been many many
people who have shown interest in participating and put up their names
as participants and several others who have helped me with this proposal
(names in the event wiki above) and I wanted to thank everyone for that.
 In particular, Shreyank Gupta for helping out with COEP contact, Amit
Shah for the detailed budget estimates and discussions,  Satya
Komaragiri for the travel information etc and Narayan Murty for agreeing
to help with the logistics.  Special thanks to COEP itself for agreeing
to host the conference.

The venue dates are on 4th to 6th of November,  Friday,  Saturday and
Sunday and we are planning on talks for Friday and Saturday with several
parallel tracks and a hackfest on Sunday, ending with the FUDPub to wrap
up the event and have some fun!

As of now,  we have 97 people pre-registered to attend the event,  36
talks and 14 hackfests and we expect the numbers to increase quite a bit
as we get closer to the event.

Thank you for your interest,

Rahul

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT]Online Payments
Message-ID: <CAN7tdFSwWekT1GAWpct46oUR4LzdgGi2TEiHiuw=Vbr-1=AMrQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Please correct me if i am wrong in here ...anywhere....I wanted to
understand the online payments arena better:

Simply put : i am launching a new service and i want my customers to pay me
via credit card OR paypal account.
The money can either go into my bank account directly OR into my paypal
account(from which i can withdraw later).

So this is what i have understood so far:
1. i can accept creditcard or pp payments using paypal using their websites
payment standard<https://merchant.paypal.com/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=merchant/wp_standard>.
This costs around 5$ for every 100$ worth of transactions.
2. I can accept the same using authorize
<http://www.authorize.net/solutions/merchantsolutions/pricing/>which would
transfer the money to my bank account. This costs approx 20$ per month +per
txn fee) and before that the setupfees. Lets say this costs 20+100*0.10 =30$
per month. (is it possible to link a bank account in India to this? - i
guess they call this as merchant account?

Now, i understand these 2 services, but how do
chargify<http://chargify.com/pricing-and-signup/>,
cheddargetter <https://cheddargetter.com/pricing>and spreedly
<http://spreedly.com/>work? I mean, do these also provide the same feature
of accepting payments online or are these just billing services(like a
ledger to keep track of payments).

Help?

I have a couple of 1GB DDR2 RAM modules (for a desktop) that are lying

them to any student who can give a talk on his favourite topic at the 
next (or later) ILUGC meetings. Get back to me off-list if you're

Well, that's still good enough for me - my initial thought was to give 
it out to anybody who gives a talk, but I thought students might find 
more value in it (not to mention encourage them to give talks). If you 
can give a talk and want it, it's yours :)

As far as chargify is concerned, it provides an easier way to charge

Subject: [Ilugc] Locked Root password,
	Debian 5 refuses to go into single user mode
Message-ID: <1310319861.1632.8.camel@mjolnir>

Hello,

I've got a terrible problem. After reading up on `sudo` and looking at
archived emails on [debian-user], I came to the conclusion that a nice
way of having multiple admins on my server is to use `sudo` to give them
powers and then lock the root user.

Unfortunately, on Debian this leads to a deadly situation. In the event
of a failed fsck, Debian gives you the bog standard, "Enter root
password to continue (or press Ctrl-D)" message. The problem is that the
root user is locked. There is simply no password. `Ctrl-D` just restarts
the OS.

To make it worse, this computer is a VPS running on VMWare, hundreds of
kilometres from me. The set up being fairly unusual, the sysadmins
aren't sure what to do. They can get to the bootloader, but can't mount
the drive elsewhere (limitation of the VMDK format) or do anything of
that sort.

Any advice would be appreciated. I'm having that horrible sinking
feeling right now.

Regards,

Hello,

I don't know if you can do much on deb, you do have an option to recover
from the VMDK.

I hope you do have back up of all your critical data.

This is *very easy* to recover.  I've done this several times.


1. In your boot loader, pass the "init=/bin/sh" option and boot
your kernel

2. when the kernel completes boot, it will immediately drop you
into a root shell.  Here you remount your root fs rw, run passwd
to reset root password.  See below.

3. mount /proc; swapon -a

4. mount -o remount,rw / # mounts root fs rw, if this fails run fsck

5. run passwd to reset the root password.  You are already root
so you will not be promoted for current password.

6. mount -o remount,ro /

7. exec /sbin/init  # will continue boot procedure

8. Once system boots up, I recommend you reboot immediately
to ensure system is up following correct boot procedure.

That needs to be "passwd -u" to unlock the root account.
I misunderstood that you lost the root password.

If that does not work, "vi /etc/shadow" and delete the entire
encrypted password field for root.  It makes the root account
password less (just press enter when prompted for the
password).

This only solves the root access problem.  fsck is a completely
different issue.


Btw, this is the first time in 15 years I've come across someone
locking the root account.  Sounds like a terrible idea.  Why are
you following this practice?

Wow hearing this for the first time .

So does this mean ' Finally the Year of Desktop linux has come' ?

On the op question , Ubuntu as a client does have a collection of web
browsers like firefox,seamonkey,chromium & konqueror
Instant messaging clients like Pidgin ,empathy etc .

Mail clients like evolution, thunderbird & kmail .

FTP,SSH client etc are all supported . If your windows server acts as
file server , you can use the default nautilus to browse the server
files via samba .

Pavithran

I believe the OP is looking for a "cyber cafe" package that has a
Linux client, through which access of that Linux machine to the 'Net,
can be managed using the "admin" part of the same running on a Windows
Server.

Whatever may be the motivation for selecting a Windows server, the OP
should be asking this question in a Windows forum.

I always profess, not to change the "admin" philosophy of the
distribution.   I suspect this idea came from Ubuntu wherein the
"first" user essentially is the root user except that s/he has to
prefix "sudo"

Raja's method should help you recover/reset the root password.   I
have never done it on a remote server or VPS.

I disagree, that VMDK cannot be mounted anywhere else.  Linux KVM does
recognize VMDK v3/4 as well as VBOX VDI disk image formats.   With
access to the VMWare disk image file (on a local machine), you can use
Raja's method to reset the root password.   You can also boot a VM
with a SystemRescueCD along with the image file and change the root
password the brute force way.

No worries - just be calm, come up with a strategy and I am sure
things will work out.

Success of the suggestions will depend on the competency of the VPS
providers tech support.

Unless this is a production server, if all else fails you can refresh
the VPS image I suppose.

My two cents.

No relationship.  Distributions haven't set a root password for fsck on
a emergency boot before Ubuntu even existed.  It just makes it easier to
rescue the system.  Distributions also don't set a grub password by
default.  If you have physical access to a system and it doesn't have
disk encrypted, then it is game over for security.     Everything else
is just a minor hiccup.

I have heard of Internet cafe's running Linux since early 1998 atleast.
Even before if you count Squid as a proxy server. Desktop Linux has come
for millions already.   I don't expect it to be the majority anytime
soon.  .

Hi,

Sorry for reposting. The earlier subject or content might not have
possibly made my point here.

Do we have an inventory management system software for a local kirana shop (
groceries shop/vegetable shop) which will take care of stock of shop as well
as the daily sales both at large and small scales.

This software must ideally scale to any kind of business, also should be
Free and open source software one.

We are planning it to be distributed to local shopkeepers and vendors in
northern AP, where people are in need of it.

If its in FOSS, we can even have a Telugu translation for it, which in turn
will have more widespread usage.

Lastly, it is urgently required! The earlier the better, as proprietary
people are trying to perpetuate here too.

Thanks and regards,
Rahimanuddin Shaik

Dotdeb [http://www.dotdeb.org ] provides a repository with PHP 5.3 for
lenny and it's easy to upgrade:

1. Add these lines to the apt sources (pico /etc/apt/sources.list)

deb http://php53.dotdeb.org stable all
deb-src http://php53.dotdeb.org stable all

2. Download and import the dotdeb key

wget http://www.dotdeb.org/dotdeb.gpg
cat dotdeb.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

3. Update apt and dist-upgrade

apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade

Hey, this and all is fine.
What i was looking for is an already existing implementation in Indian
context.
Is there already something thats implemented?

The situation now in some shops in Vishakhapatnam, Krishna and Godavari
districts of AP is that all inventory was on fingertips of people of our
previous generation and the current generation thats pampered with Computer
technologies has no clue to do these kind of stuff, and they require
some handy software.

So i'll customize in case no ready made one's available.

Thank you so much for the help, Raja. I forwarded your instructions
(with the modification to unlock the root account) to the tech support
team at my provider soon after receiving them but power failed in the
middle of the night here so I was unable to reply. I'm told they're
attempting to see what fsck is complaining about now.

As for how this happened, I don't really have an explanation. I
originally intended for this server to be where I test ways of doing
things but as time passed I started using it for more than I should
have. To top it all off, I moved from an older unsupported Ubuntu to the
newest release because they pulled the repositories, and so some of my
files were stored _only_ on what this server until I got a git pull off.

Locking the root user was one of these things I was trying out. You see,
Ubuntu runs by default in the following configuration:

1. One or more `admin` users who get elevated privileges using `sudo` by
virtue of being in that group.

2. One `root` user who can't be logged into but with whose privileges
you can run using `sudo`.

3. In the event of going into single-user mode it will drop you at a
root prompt.

There was no real reason to lock root, seeing as `sshd` has
PermitRootLogin set to no. I did it at the time to see if I could
emulate Ubuntu's behaviour. One of the first things I should've checked
was whether dropping into single-user mode worked.

Ridiculous, I know. A perfect storm of mistakes, one might say. I can't
wait to fix everything and do it right this time.

Thank you for the information about the VMWare Disk Images, Arun. I was
just parroting what the tech support guys told me. I'm glad to hear that
if all else fails I can probably just have them mail me the image for me
to get what I need out.

You were right with your guess that I was attempting to mimic Ubuntu's
method of dealing with root privileges. It seemed elegant at the time,
but obviously there were holes in the way I handled it.

My backups are a week or two out of date, so I'd really love to have the
files back but it's not something I can't recover from. I've forwarded
Raja Subramanian's detailed and helpful reply to the people there and
I'm fairly hopeful now.

Are VMDK files just plain disk images? If so, and if nothing else works,
I can probably just have them set me up a server for this month and
mount this image on the other server. It's good to know that such an
alternative exists.

Thank you,

To clarify, I was talking about my laptop here. The server runs Debian
5. I did backup most of my /home (excepting videos and the like) but for
some reason assumed most of the code was "safe" on the server. So much
for that, eh?

Kenneth,

I don't think Anu Nivas has asked just you, but to the entire mailing
list. Would have been nice if you give a valid response instead of
just responding with a blind 'no' which is pointless or rather
spamming this list. Thanks for understanding.

Hi Kenneth,
??? The way you have responded above to Anu Nivas's post is just *ridiculous* and *without* any point or explanation which is not going to help anyone here. It would be good if you give proper answers rather than *just* replies. Only responses with points and good suggestions would help us learn from the list. These do *not* help us in anyway.

This is not the first time you are pointed out with *pointless* replies like this, but you still keep doing it. Not sure if you understand the purpose of the list.

I can see others responding in a much better way, which helps us to learn from them.

I do not understand. Please explain why refusing to recommend windows
software is invalid, pointless and spamming. It was not a blind 'no', it
was done with eyes open.

I see a lot of criticism of KG's response;  I am not happy about
someone expecting to get an answer from the LUG about
proprietary software. And I am not sure that the list should encourage
people to answer such questions.

And KG's succinct (ok, cryptic) answer was to the point. I might have
told the OP politely not to expect such
questions answered here; or I might have done it rudely.

I am concerned that a large number of list members are looking up to
the LUG list as a general trouble-shooting
help desk. I for one would be very unhappy if that is the direction it turns to.

The LUG and the list are meant to foster a sense of community learning
and working together for FOSS
software.

I am considerably more offended by the question asked (and the
defenses for the same) than the
manner of KG's answer.

Problem is with the Indian way of Schooling:

In a train the trainer program, a "professional trainer" asked us,
what is Source Control? why should we use it? Why do you guys mandate
it?....

Hello,
I'm sorry that I didn't elaborate on my question. I had installed Ubuntu on
a client system of the net center which I frequently visit. As I was
permittted to do so on only one such system. The server admin system used a
cafe software which wasn't available for Linux. So I was looking for a
cross-platfoem Cafe Software and put the question to the mailing list

Gagan, am also a final year student of computer science and engineering
student from villupuram.

Rather than asking titles from someone, we shall kindle our innovative
ideas.

My suggestion would be " think of some issues that you have faced in your
real world situation, and try to find a innovative solution for it and
implement it via Open Source (as you are interested)." lets have a
discussion off-list if you wish. "

Hi all,


http://www.studentzleague.com/

The above mentioned is a website maintained by one of my friend from
Pondicherry.
This site is meant to help students in various aspects. Most of the students
of Pondicherry most frequently visit this site.

The Administrator of this website Mr. Deepak has asked me to get an Article
based on Open Source for beginners.
I think this place would be very useful for the students to get started with
Open source with our articles.

Please i request anyone of you to write an articles on the topic of " OPEN
SOURCE FOR BEGINNERS ".
This is not only they want, but also they are ready to publish any article
based on Open source and also any
information over it.

Interested please do reply for this.

Respected old Kenneth, 

I should laugh out loud that you are trying to divert the issue I am talking about :D

The purpose of the list !!!??? it is to share our knowledge with others and guide the newbies towards opensource, and *not* just replying with "yes" and "no". It is to share *meaningful* ideas.



I still could not control my laughter in your intelligence in diverting the issue towards your question "to encourage windows in cybercafes" :D

Hi Kenneth,

If you are doing things your way, *why* do you insist others to do things your way?  

If you are too old to change, I guess we are too young to bare these bad things and we like to have changes and that too good ones.You are too old? then you could be a role-model to us in a better way.

If this is your way, can I post as "No" "I don't know" for every thread that I don't know the answer ??? and claim that it is my way ???

Hi Ashokan,

I guess... "no" is never a pointer to any question. It would have been a *pointer* if he really gave any URL which atleast tries to explain something about opensource related to the question asked.

        You are dragging one thread into another. Kenneth did not say
"no" in this thread. He said "it is not software if we don't use
version control.". And went on to explain why. I guess that gives
enough pointers to start using version control. And as Asokan said,
people should not refrain from asking if they feel the response they
got is not clear. Now, I don't see any problem at all, except that you
seem to be complaining. May be this will help,

Friends.

I am seeing a lot of people FEAR to shoot a mail to the list.
It seems that the newbies should have thick skin to write to our list.

Did anyone hear the same from the silent members of the list?
Please check with your friends why they are not posting
or asking any questions to our list.


Just thinking on how to make our list more user friendly.
The users should not feel odd to send mail to our list.

The mailing list guidelines are there but we have to
think on how our responses and replies to the list
are welcoming the new users.

Yes. The new users will do mistakes like top/bottom posting,
mails in FULL CAPS, sms language etc.
But, we should teach them in a very friendly tone.


Quoting from the code of conduct of ubuntu community
http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct

<Quote>
Be respectful. The Ubuntu community and its members treat one another
with respect.
Everyone can make a valuable contribution to Ubuntu. We may not always
agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour
and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and
then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn
into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community
where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not
a productive one. We expect members of the Ubuntu community to be
respectful when dealing with other contributors
as well as with people outside the Ubuntu project and with users of Ubuntu.
</Quote>

Hope this can be applied to our ILUGC Community too.

Please share your thoughts on how can we make our list more friendly.

Thanks.

Indian Govt Takes The Open Source Route??- Interesting news

Visit
http://www.efytimes.com/e1/fullnews.asp?edid=65655&ntype=mor

The Indian Government has been talking of the open source-based
systems for long, but for the first time it is working on a policy on
the use of operating systems and device drivers in all new
e-governance projects.

Expecting others to change is a 'nice' way of living in the world ;) I dont
think we should
expect others to behave as per our wishes.  Newbies need not have a thick
skin, but they
should feel that this list is a grandpa, to whom they can approach easily
and get their queries
clarified.

I have consistently seen that a selected few do not have the naiveness while
posting
which is taken as being disrespectful.  The problem *is* with the former;
for they being
in the list for a long time should not take the liberty in 'owning' this
group; and should rather
help in 'promoting'  -- do understand that being curt in replies is
dangerous thing - and is often
understood as being disrespectful. Btw, i see the same behavior by those
*few* across mailing lists too;
so i have kind of lived that.

Been in this group since 2004-05, i have posted very less and i am always
flabbergasted with
the noise-to-signal ratio(!!).

Code of Conduct should be 'freindly' - like a marketing campaign, and not a
checklist.

Hi Shrini,

I think the results you see in the list and the resulting fear you
precive are b'cos you misunderstood/mis-interpreted the results. And
if i am correct we will continue to see decline in mailing list
traffic and newbie postings. So this is the best time to take the list
to next level by creating more discussion between long timers in the
list and linux expert gurus in the list. We dont necessarily need to
have to get novice level doubts. instead we can start discussions on
our experinces and get best practices. Start discussion on newer/less
discussed technologes in linux. the one that comes to mind immediately
is configuration management system. (not content management system)
like pupet or cfengine, etc. Open source app development for desktop
application (not OSS web app). I mean something like GUI app in python
with gtk+ bindings or qt bindings or wxwidget. One application which i
am trying to look into porting to linux is this
http://keepfocused.codeplex.com/ . Currently it is alpha but stable .
Code review by the peers of the app in ilugc seniors would be great.
that way we get to know differernt coding techniques. Now don't limit
your self to code. There is a world in IT filed out there that doesnt
do code as primarly but yet do wonders. Like sys ops. Try to involve
them in discussion by posting information related to them thereby
pulling them to the discuss in the list. I mean when faced by sys ops
problem andsolvedf by another sys ops. I don't mean usual stuff like
db, web server, app server, mail , etc problems. But problems on
lesser discussed items like cfengine maybe.
So Shrini the reason why you are seeing less traffic esp., from
newbies is that linux has become old enough that most of the common
problems are already discussed in length in lot of places online in
world. And this resulted in google able to pick the most problems and
their best solution. So when newbie face a problem he searched in the
internet and finds the answer , thereby never needing to post to list.
Second reason, most products have become mature enough after gaining
limelight by being under linux. For example , mysql, postgresql,
httpd, sendmail, samba, etc. And so most critical bugs are already
fixed. And company employees are officially asked to work in OSS
projects as a part of their part of pushing their commercial product
into the market by using the OSS product. For example, you may be
providing email service like mail.com. So they might be using sendmail
in place of exchange to serve its users., thereby saving the money
spend on software and support. So when there is critical bug in
sendmail then it is definetly going to affect our mail.com vendor. So
this vendor would deploy people in his payroll to fix that bug and
give them back to OSS b'cos he got the original s/w as free OSS so it
makes sense that he give back to community in what the community has
given him. That way the bugs are also getting fixed, atleast so for
the long time famous products. New products have the tough challenge
of getting large users mindshare. If they prove he worth they will
surive and get corporate hornors like our sendmail example got.
So the moral of the story: Linux has become old, since linux is in
existance for nearly 20 years. So here the waterhole has dried up.
Move to the other emerging field where the pasture are still green. i
stick on to it b'cos, it maybe old, but it is not going to be dead
anywhere near. In fact it has gained ground so much that it is going
to live for another few decades before something close to that
happens. That time i will move out . infact most people will move out.
But during this phase it will lead a life without much happenings. Its
grandpa(unix) is still relavent today and that shows some of the
strengths of linux and strong lineage it holds for the future.

This is how it is going to be . Accept and move on...

with regards,
ashwin

Am looking for a client side search tool for searching indexed web pages on

I am new to the list so I haven't grasped the exact purpose of the list 
yet. But, in my opinion, I agree with your thoughts and to promote the 
idea of free/open software it is necessary that newcomers from all 
sections of the society feel welcome. ilugc has got a lot of potential 
but if you ask me today whether I would recommend it to a beginner, the 
answer would be no. To change that, all questions asked should be 
considered as genuine and reasonable, even if they seem unreasonable and 
bogus.

Just my 2 cents.

before that analyse what is supposed to be wrong. This month, apart from
announcements etc, 14 questions were asked, of which 12 were answered.

May be this is because majority of newbie are college going guys/gals and
they are on summer vacations *or* may be a quick data analysis *may* reveal
that newbie questions are more when the college reopens and new student
join.

Srikanth,

Give Apache Lucene a try. Its open source and widely used search library.
You can index and search Tamil text as it does not suffer from unicode issues.
You can also create a RamDirectory Index, by reading the contents of
the CD into memory, if the data is not huge.
Else you can create a temporary directory on the client side to create
the persistent index and run your all search on that.

Best Regards,
Devjyoti

If this is the case then the number of people joining the list in past
months should also go down significantly.

Whatever might be the case, new comers look to the seniors in getting
ready to enter the world of FOSS.
It has happened with me, and I'm sure it must have happened with many
members of this list.
So if it does'nt harm our respected and beloved seniors in any way,
please do not criticize the person, but instead think that
if you are truly a FOSS evangelist, your answer should generate more
interest in him. I wont say that this is a responsibility but in my
opinion it definitely is a nice thing to do.

I am a passive member of the list. I am a Hardware Engineer who is sparingly 
using Linux. But I read all the mails for the last two years. I enjoy the 
questions and answers. This list is doing fine.

Linux is Free & Open Source, that doesn't mean when some member ask a 
question and expect a free answer from the other member of the list. If some 
one try to answer the question we should be thankful to him.

Let us understand what is freedom. When I drive my car on the road I should 
follow the rules, otherwise we know what will happen. The same way when a 
member like to participate in the list let him see the previous mails, study 
list rules and understand how to ask questions. Even  some one point the 
mistake let  the member say thanks to him and correct his mistake. I think 
now a days we are slowly loosing patience. The other member is taking his 
time to correct us. Why don't we accept it. Let us show our honesty on this 
list to accept our mistakes and correct them. If we do not understand the 
answers we can ask them to explain in details rather than criticizing them.

Thanks,

Balajee

Dear luggies,

Last year FOSS DAY WAS celeberated in Birla planitaurium by ILUGC in nice
manner.many colleges have participated in it and made their contribution to

And this year my suggestion is to celeberate FOSS DAY in busy place in
chennai.That i would select for ANNA CENETNARY LIBRARY that is located near
to IIT-M ie) kotturpuram.
Guys please suggest your views so as to make free and opensource to reach
the public more than last year.

Most new comers have zero idea about seeking support from the Internet. We
need to be polite to them. We should educate them. If you think we have no
business educating them then we should stay silent instead of rebuking them
the very first time. Repeated mistakes can be taken seriously. We should
first welcome them and then maybe point them to list rules.

Recently someone asking if he can use Ubuntu alongside Windows Server was
rebuked for no reason. For all we know, he might have had some good reason
for that. I was working part time at an Internet cafe and I have tried to
switch the whole cafe to Ubuntu. The proprietor told be "Do whatever you
want, just don't touch the server"! He had his own concerns. Everyone has to
start somewhere. I would certainly expect the senior Linux experts /
Veterans to be a bit more kind and forgiving.

And this thread is not about decline in the number of posts. It's about new
comers to the list and how they (and their mistakes) are treated.

Wow.. That was a cool tip. I have found some more commands for handling PDF
files.
like : pdffonts, pdfinfo, pdftoppm, pdftotext, pdftohtml, pdftops, pdf2ps,
pdf2dsc.

Please try those commands too.

Sorry, I should have put the question in a better way. By Client side I
meant "In browser" within the CD. The end user would not install anything,
just open HTML pages from CD, and search page has to exist in it indexing
all the contents of the HTML pages.It rules out any webserver(unless there a
"live" webserver which is cross platform). and hence I need a way to access
Lucene / Solr or any index with javascript. After few spending few more
searches i got this[1] as the exact scenario am looking for, but looks like
i have to do spend more time on it. :) Thanks.

 i disagree. ilugc is beginner friendly. i learnt linux mostly after
joining ilugc. But does expects you know working english and some
basic manners like reading completely before posting. Diluting these
basic principle, will be determinative to the list. We are already
doing a good job. Why do you think we are not. Please do not dilute

By beginner, in the broader sense, I mean those folks who use the 
computer only for basic purposes such as web mail, managing documents, 
playing music etc.. They essentially learn how to operate the computer 
through their friends and family.

Also, Please don't feel offended, it was just a personal opinion which, 
I hope, will change over time.

this a total misreading of ILUGC. ILUGC is *the* leading forum for linux
and open source in the country today. It is active both in discussion
and action. It is the best possible place for a beginner and for an old
hand. I always recommend it for beginners. Here people can not only
learn about anything under the sun - they can also interact with the
cream of the open source community in India. When I recommend people to
join, I also advise them not to jump in at the deep end - lurk on the
list, study how people behave, read the guidelines, take care and
trouble to formulate your posts. You will be rewarded. We are not social
workers here - we are a bunch of people with a common interest.

I would be interested to know what the OP recommends for beginners -
paid private tuition?

The trouble is that in our culture, when we criticise the question many
people take it personally. Well, if a person takes such criticism
personally, he is not going to go very far in the foss world.

rebuked? what was the rebuke? He asked if open source software was
available for ubuntu client and windows server. The answer was 'no'. And
the answer is still 'no'. And he did not take offence - he realised his
question may have been misunderstood and clarified. The people who took
offence were some do-gooders who where trying to educate people how to
answer questions - but the interesting thing is that *they* did not make
the slightest effort to answer the question. So please do not make wild

Wow, this is such a good point! Although, like with most other issues,
both sides have valid arguments. Meta-discussions such as these don't
go anywhere, so maybe the solution is that if anyone feels that a
question could have been answered better, or in a more sensitive way,
go ahead and provide that better, more sensitive answer.

         I would like to quote what Randal Schwartz[0] mentioned on
perl-beginners list mentioned when people on that list felt that we
should use kind and polite words when dealing with beginners.

<quote>

Here (and on monks and usenet and now StackOverflow), I'm (often)
reacting to bad code.  And I make no apologies for saying code is bad or
wrong or illpurposed or a security threat, if that's indeed what it is,
and I also believe that the person who creates such code needs to
understand that in *no* uncertain terms.  Softening the blow does nobody
any good there.  Weaselwording is counterproductive.

If they don't have a thick skin already, they'd better get one soon, or
they'll be useless as an advanced programmer.  Without thick skin, they
won't be able to submit their code for review regardless of how much
their ego is invested in it.  And down that path lies security breaches
and thedailywtf.com submissions.  I have no tolerance for that.  I'm
trying to make the world a better place, one correction at a time. :)

</quote>

      I am also linking[1] to the actual thread on nntp.perl.org. The
discussion started on a similar note, when some beginner used a bad
construct and was asked not to use that in a hard manner. The scenario
is much similar here. A lot of beginners ask questions, of course
genuine. But there might be something wrong, or something that would
have been better and hence someone tells that in strict manner. I
don't think there is anything wrong there.

PS: There might be people who "hate" Randal Schwartz. But he is no
doubt a respected perl guy. Let's just look at this comments from that
angle.

we need a josiyer to answer them ;-) I have been flamed innumerable
times on many lists worldwide for asking dumb questions or not asking
questions properly - or people have been extremely rude even while
giving the correct answers, or hints. But I persist, because I *need*
the answers, and, after all, I am not paying these guys. There was this
guy on IRC - insulted every one with pretty vulgar language, but had all
the answers. I met several deadlines because of him. If people do not
ask questions because they are scared, then they do not really *need*
the answers. Here is a thread where I *needed* the answer - you can see
what I went through. But I got the answer.

http://groups.google.com/group/django-users/browse_thread/thread/bc47e17b51cfc478/5f991b8823c4dcb5?hl=en&lnk=gst&q=russell%2Blawgon#5f991b8823c4dcb5

our list is user-friendly - we need to make some of our users
list-friendly.

Application: linuxdcpp

What it is:

Direct connect is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing protocol. Clients
connect to a central hub where they can view a list of clients or
users connected to them. Users can search for files and download them
from other clients, as well as chat with other users.

The most popular Windows client implementing this protocol currently
is DC++. LinuxDC++ is a Linux port of DC++. Though it is primarily
aimed at Linux, it has been shown to work on other Unix-based
operating systems as well.

Ok; my 2 paise

1. There is an opinion that the list needs to be 'friendly' for
    some values of that term

2. It appears that many newcomers `will' not know some
    things that all seasoned users take for granted:
    eg: top posting, asking poorly framed questions,
    all caps ....

3. Many people believe that such newcomers should be
    educated and that they are actually being scared
    away by the type of answers that are given

4. Many people (often those who do answer such queries)
    believe that the simple, direct, rude, blunt, offensive
    (Choose your pick) answer is the best way.

5. Many people (often those that do not answer queries)
    are going on record questioning the style of such answers

6. The defenders of newcomers are almost taking the view that
    we can educate the newcomers ONLY after answering the
    questions.

7.  I almost 'hear' an undertone of "If you try to educate them
     any other way they will be lost to the community

8. The seasoned users opine that in order to be a member
    of any group one has to first understand the rules of
    that group. Else the group will first ask you to do that
    before responding to your needs.

My stance:
========
If you want to be part of the group that nurtures the newcomers
please do so.

The people who answer questions will not (cannot, should not)
stop you.

You can explain to and educate the new comers about the
expected behaviour on the list and deprecate the attitude of the answers
as part of such mails.

But do not start send mails whose only purpose is criticizing and educating
those who answer.

These are not places of public visit. We can reach only people who visit our
stalls out of their own interest.

The benefit in conducting them at a crowded place is that most of the people
there will want to know what is happening and will at least take a glance at
the stalls, which may give them an exposure to FOSS.

       If we ban anyone because we don't like his/her replies, we stop
being a FOSS group in the first place.

> be afraid. No Offense.. Just criticizing the way he is behaving

        If the newbies are afraid of being told that they are wrong,
then it is more of an attitude problem. A lot of people in this list
joined this as a newbie, me included. And none is an expert in every
area, implying everyone is a newbie, one way or the other. Just that
we should look at learning from our mistakes - irrespective of whether
we get corrected in a mild manner or rough manner. Thanks

I take it very personally - this is the most insulting post I have ever
seen on this list. And since you are making comments like this kindly
state your qualifications and your contributions to this list.

I think you are confusing between criticising question(or the way question is put at) and criticising the person questioning. KG is more concerned about the question and not about the person.

Yuva Raj,

People have their ways of expressing ideas. You may or may not like them.
What this thread is intended to do is to express the opinion of people like
me, that it is a *better* thing to have a bit more tolerance and patience
when dealing with newcomers to the list. You are making things personal
here, which is unhealthy and very wrong. Kindly refrain.

@All,

We need to have some additions that goes into the mailing list guidelines.

1. The Objective of this list. ( Policies with respect to free software, use
of linux, evangelism, etc.)
2. Are we promoting free software aggressively ( or are we here to provide /
share technical assistance to Linux users?)
3. What is our policy on proprietary software? Do we refuse to help people
who want to use Linux alongside Windows?
4. More..

Quit unwarranted. In the guise of openness, we cannot have such
denunciation. I second what KG does. Everyone's time is precious and
this is voluntary. While we can remain silent to such questions, it
does get to us once in a while apart from the irk that we have to deal
with the traffic in our mailbox.

The fact that KG makes it a point to reply to each these posts albeit
tersely, is a service to the silent sufferers like me.

There have been several violations of the forum rules in this thread and

attempts to resuscitate. My humble suggestion is to stop posting to the

They are supposed to read the list guidelines.   The welcome message
has links to the relevant guidelines.   This is not rocket science
where we are dealing with multi dimensional equations.  Noobs can ask
for clarification regarding the guidelines itself.  The best way to
learn about participation is to lurk and understand how other members
are posting; correlate it to the guidelines.

It appears they  do not read the guidelines and the learn from others'
posts;  when they have a query they shoot off questions that have not
been well thought out.   I have experienced this via personal emails
to me "I am a noob, interested in Linux.   I am experiencing problem
with blah blah.  I expect you give me step-by-step instructions (read
spoon feed me)"   Sorry it ain't gonna happen.

> 3. Many people believe that such newcomers should be

You want to learn the fundamentals?  Develop a thick skin if that is
indeed your objective.   Most of the "seasoned" individuals have gone
through this path when they first dealt with mailing/IRC culture.
Initially, yes your face turns red but when you look at the greater
good that you achieved for yourself, it is a negligible price to pay.
Otherwise please look for a "Tutorial Classes" type place - pay money
and probably learn a little bit (if at all).

................

and reduce the S/N ratio :)  The entire thread then deviates into 2^n
discussion :D   The OP is wondering what the hell happened here?

It is like giving candy to a child to make him/her stop crying.  As
soon as the candy is gone the crying starts all over again.

So be it.   Help those who are willing to help themselves.  IMO, spoon
feeding is the worst kind of help.    Read the RTFMs, do some
homework, post the detail of the problem you are facing (to the best
of your ability) and members will chip in with answers and/or guidance
on what to do next.

Isn't this true for any activity?    I have seen kids make rules and
agree to them when they play "street" cricket.  When anyone broke the
rules they are not that friendly with offender ;)  Why expect anything
different here?

IMO, the list is to discuss technical issues related to Linux and FOSS
applications.    I am a member of many lists but this is the only list
where "user friendliness"  issue pops up every few weeks (IIRC)

................

I second this - no point in reducing the S/N ratio of the discussion.

Hi,

>>The benefit in conducting them at a crowded place is that most of the
people
there will want to know what is happening and will at least take a glance at
the stalls, which may give them an exposure to FOSS.

I think Birla planetarium administration is very supportive to our
activities , we have an ideal partner to put up our shows.
Any better place should be the one easily commutable by public transport
systems. IMO, Birla Planetarium is just a perfect fit for it.

Dear Sirs,

The intention of starting this thread is good - personally.

This could be due to some one take 'initiative' & 'action' - for
making this ILUGC - much better.

At the same time, please look at these threads - for a few days - you
would see some of replies are more 'reactive' than giving simple,
straightforward answer.  And if someone feels that the question 'does
not deserve' his time & answer - he 'may' leave it unanswered, instead
of just replying 'straight-forward', and then keeps 'reactively -
defending'.

Many organisations have closed down / not-looked-at anymore, because
of getting replies that does not convey proper respect to the asker.

It is the same Land - from where the Guru "never shouts at students -
when stupid questions where asked - since, he might not have taught
them proper" -(I have read this somewhere in the last month - and do
not ask me where & when etc).

If some body is trying to do something - for the betterment of all -
either support him or leave the thread.

I have learnt a lot by reading the ILUGC posts, but have sometimes
felt this forum is mainly for people who do know linux.

Thanks for not 'reacting' to my simple post.

Hats-off to Mr. Srinivasan, for this initiative.

with warm regards,

Right. This is what I have been struggling to explain in a different thread.

Yes! I am the living example. Also, few of my friends (whom I felt
would be a great resource if they start contributing for ILUGC)
literally stopped monitoring this list just because of the
not-so-necessary debates happening often.

Thank you so much for sharing the same thought that was about to convey.
There are few grannies in this list who are too old to change their
way of response as well.
Don't know what to do with them.

If you don't want grannies to answer easiest will be for the so called youths to answer even before grannies answer - thus making them obsolete. Unfortunately that doesn't seem to happen.

But don't forget today's youth will be a granny in future.

Judging by the dependencies, I am guessing that you would only need
the usb-modeswitch and usb-modeswitch-data packages. In particular, I
am guessing that you would need usb-modeswitch 1.1.0-2 and
usb-modeswitch-data 20100127-1 for Ubuntu 10.04. You can get them from
the pool of any Ubuntu mirror.

Hope this helps.

very simple two step process:

1. Check the gmane archives to see whether the granny's posts are worth
reading.

2. If you find that the person in question is completely jobless and
only posts to whine about the way other people post, then just add his
id to your twit filter and you will never be troubled by his posts
again.

 Good Idea to shift to arch , some of the mirrors in conf files no
more exist , check the list with the arch website , the latest version
is from 2010 , so u need to update the packages so run pacman update
as soon as u install , thats is all u need to do after installation ,
its a great distro so enjoy.

I by far is a beginner. Have met similar situations at various situations,
been told to get out of channels, branded as dumb, hopeless and what not?

I will suggest a technique that I follow online, that might help beginners
in such situations. You know the question is dumb/silly, ask it and think
that someone else has asked it, and watch that 'someone' getting bashed, and
be that someone until you get the answer. Once you get your answer, you can
drop that someone from your mind and get back to your work. This will help
yourself by large.

No one is going to spoon feed anyone, and call you dear in technical mailing
lists, so forget that goody-goody language and get seroius about the problem
you are going to solve, all those *fear* that you say is no way going to
answer your question, but sometimes bashing will get you to results.

Interesting module and here is a cgi-bin script
<http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=487045>  I do not know
PERL, use it at your own risk.  As always test it on a non production
system before deploying it.

Most of my ldap setup also require NT Domain user management.    The
package smbldap-tools provide a handy set of tools that can manage
both Unix and NT Domain users in your LDAP DIT; specifically
smbldap-passwd.pl for changing passwords.

Message-ID: <CACbtZwSJsqLkpXCr84ZxyqqqS4vv5eRmnX9Uq1vBsMErSf_82Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a friend who runs a textile unit. His father has been doing all his
billing and inventory management in paper till now. He wishes to computerize
them now. I would like you to suggest the way things are worked out in this
area in open source.

1. Is there a specific package for this or generic ERP solutions are to be
used? Comment about the customizations that can be done in generic ERP
solutions.
2. By how are the ERP solutions generally deployed? Is it pay for both the
software and service, or is free software available and people charge for
the service and training?
3. And a dumb one. Suggest a package / service. Preferably free license, as
he is going to test it out and convince his father before getting it
deployed in real world.

Debian?  It does have all the desktops starting from minimalist all
the way to GNOME and KDE.  Other options are CentOS (binary compatible
with RHEL), openSUSE.

Not aware of any specific package.  However, if their process is not
too complex, it might be worthwhile exploring a custom app using any
one of the CMS packages.   A friend of mine has done so for a  plastic
manufacturer on a Drupal platform.   You have to weigh the effort of
learning/customizing a canned package v/s doing it from ground up.

Typically with the help of a consulting company with domain knowledge
in the industry and/or ERP methodology.

Budget for a competent consultant (who knows both ERP as a methodology
and at least one software implementation).    End user training should
be part of the contract.   Convince the friend's father not be penny
wise and pound foolish in this aspect.  I mention this specifically
because I have experienced this first hand.   In one case, the CEO
wanted the system to be "distributed"  pan India in remote mills but
balked at the price.   He told me he could do it with a "networked"
version of the most popular accounting package starting with the
letter T.  I told him he was welcome to do what he thought was best
for his enterprise.

A well implemented ERP can pay for itself in a matter of couple of
years - the opposite can be a disaster.    Some of the biggies are
offering it as SAAS.

openBRAVO has a downloadable virtual appliance that you can experiment
with.   openTAPS also used to have one.

Hi all,

First of all , I am thankful to all the members of this mailing list.

Thanks to the experts who had already given the answers just when i needed
so that i just needed to search my inbox. And thanks to those who had
already asked the questions.

Thanks to those novice users(including me), who often get advised(sometimes
bashed) to correct themselves. That has helped me to post a proper reply(I
hope this is) today.

I have posted just one or two queries to this list. Genuinely speaking, I
did get some answers but not though the solutions. And also some *fear* and
a chance to get corrected before posting to a list. After that, I never
preferred to post a query to this thread without searching the previous
threads for an answer. And i almost got all, and I neglected the unanswered

search option like me, hesitating to post his/her query, just because he/she
isn't sure if he/she had really understand the mailing etiquettes
*correctly*  or because he/she is likely to be bombarded for a bad grammar,
might need it badly. I am sure, I will start contributing to this list at
some stage when I've gained some give-able amount of knowledge, before that
I would *understand* the mailing etiquettes completely. And I do not want to
hesitate to answer at that point of time, just because I would get a serious
advice to learn before trying teach.

Sir, the link you provided didn't show any serious trouble you went through
*with the person trying to help you* , but a polite warning. I welcome
*such* responses here, though, I am not assured of *only such*.

I am not sure,even after going through the mailing list etiquettes, if
posting replies to two different posts in a same reply is right or wrong,
but I'm just going to post this, so that someone might correct me if this is
wrong.

Thanks,

Hi,

On disk configuration part when going for manual partition i got this
error "Fatal error: bad logical partition 8:enlarged logical
partitions overlap".

Here is my fdisk -l output:

Disk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes

Partition table entries are not in disk order.

I want to install arch in sda7. (sda10 was swap space created by
ubuntu then for oracle i needed more swap space so i created sda6)

Tell me the possible solutions. I cannot format whole disk.

Balaji

A search for "Fatal error: bad logical partition enlarged
logicalpartitions overlap" throws up quite a few links.

Looks like others have encountered similar problem.  I suppose you
tried this already right?  (I hope so)

The fdisk out put that you have pasted is hard to read.   The
partition numbers are not in order but if you could rearrange the
lines in terms of start/end sectors sorted then it would be easier to
spot the problem.  See this post
<http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?p=71266>

I suggest  you boot the system with SystemRescueCD.  Fire up X with
startx and then use GParted to view how your partitions line up
visually.   Back up your data.

The error probably talks about these two partitions, the ending cylinder 
of /dev/sda9 and starting cylinder of /dev/sda10 are the same. I don't 
have much experience resolving these, if it was me, I would delete the 
linux swap + leave a small free space between the partitions and 
recreate the swap.

Hope this helps.

XFCE seems to be a good bet for a lightweight window manager and
Enlightenment e17 for a snazzy and snappy desktop environment.

There was thread on this list with significant traffic on open source
ERP  a while back. Of the options, I remember TinyERP having support
and implementation services out of Ahmedabad. Best to check all these
sites for implementation partners and see if you can any close by with
good references.

Or just delete the swap partition? One is enough, no need for 2 of them.

why should fear prevent you from posting? When you are new you *will*
make mistakes - and hopefully get corrected and learn from it. If you
never post you will never make mistakes and will never learn anything.
The first time you bat in a cricket match, do you think that the bowler
is going to spoon feed you with slow full tosses because you are a
newbie? And if he did will you become a better batsman?

wrong - you should have posted on both. The general rule is that a post
should contain precisely *one* issue and it is bad practice to
amalgamate replies to more than one post in a single post.

the above may be a bouncer, but I hope that you will face it rather than
complaining to the umpire that the bowler is being unfair ;-)

BTW, which  OS (fdisk) did you use to create the extended partition?

sda8 is a logical partition and sda3 is  a primary partition.
GNU/fdisk allows selecting a number for a "primary" partition but not
for "logical" partitions.   Please read up on  what is allowed w.r.t
MSDOS disk partition scheme.

Having said that,  yes it is possible with some juggling.    Note the
start/end sectors of the partitions.   **Backup** your data.    Delete
the partitions in question.  Make space for a primary partition.
Again I will suggest that you use GParted to do this operation.

A very nice analogy.

The problem with some newbies is that life has been very smooth
(everything taken care) for them with lot of spoon-feeding that they
expect everybody to help them the same way. They haven't yet seen the
(harsh) realities of life.

So, when they begin to face the real world with different
personalities (this list, for example), they are suddenly pushed to a
state where they find that people don't give them their doze of
spoon-feeding as how they are used to. So, they start to complain
about it.

The smart newbies will accept that life is different out there as
compared to what they are used to, thank this list for educating them
(optional), improve their competence, and prove their valour with
their work.

There is nothing called "best IDE". Everyone has their favourite

You have to try different editors and use the one that you like.

It depends on what options you need, and what your definition of 'user

like.

        It depends on what you mean by "options". And user
friendliness depends on the user. To quote an eg. people used to
vi/vim will find it more user friendly than other editors, but people
new to it will/may find it hard to use. Both eclpise and netbeans
support most options to create,  and maintain projects(like build
options, source code organisation, version control etc.). Thanks

All IDE sucks. Use real powerfull editor with syntax highlighting and
code completion with vim (though it requires plugins to do that and i
have seen that in action for C, for java a plugin must be there). it
does automated indentation (again through plugin) and code compilation
and pasting the output of the code excution in your editor for help on
ml or groups is just awesome within vim. Vim is small in mem footprint
(even with all these plugins) compared to bloatware called netbeans or
eclipse. There is no limitation as to what you c an achive with vim. I
have used vim extensively and i am still learning something new about
vim.

true linux geek feel commnad line is lot better than GUI. I think you
are a or aspiring Linux geek which is why you are asking in this M/L.
So one more reason to use vim.

There is no one size fits all approach, thats why you have so many editors
and IDE's.
If your aim is to be productive, I would suggest try each of those for a
month and settle down on one you are happy with.

Personally vim really works well for me.

Who decides the virtues of a true geek? A geek, IMHO, creates all the
required tools beforehand
(for posterity) which he can use when needed. Remember, most geeks are lazy
;)

Extreme Programming teaches you to complete the task by adhering to the
simplest
philosophies and there is nothing wrong in using an IDE. Using an IDE is a
matter of
decision -
#choose one which has the features that you are looking for;
#doesnt create too much boiler plate code which you cannot understand;
#if paid, then doesnt leave a hole in your wallet for the features solicited
#..etc

Would like to add another point.

Even the proprietary solutions have to be customized and homologated
to "fit" your company.    This interval can be anywhere from 3-4
months, the billing could be time and material over and above the lic.
cost.

I had a laptop with a VM on VirtualBox. The VM had some 5 snapshots. I had
to format the laptop for some reason. So I just copied the VM directory. Now
I want to import it into my newly installed VirtualBox. I am able to attach
the harddisk to a new VM which gives me the last snapshot. Now I want to
import my snapshots into it. I have a .vbox file which seems to have
information about the snapshots in some XML format. Please help.

Hi,

Got it. Did this in the terminal:

VBoxManage registervm /path/to/filename.vbox

This imported the VM complete with snapshots. :)

Working with Vim/Vi has the additional advantage that it will be available
preinstalled on most linux distributions and will be helpful when you have
to SSH into a remote server and edit some files on it.

Welcome to the club :-)

I would suggest that you learn the language and "proper" programming
first. An IDE is just a tool.

With almost 10 years into Java, I care the least about which IDE I/ my
people use. I go with whatever is available at that particular moment.
This includes Eclipse and variants of Eclipse, NotePad++, Kate, VI,
sed, grep, spreadsheets (!), Netbeans, and so on...

If you are clear in what you want to develop, the tool is just an aid.
And, switching between Eclipse and Netbeans is not a big deal at all.
So don't worry much about the tool. Just learn to code. In fact, if
you learn to code properly, even the language is not a barrier :D (Do
politicians hesitate to speak in a new language that they have never
learnt?)

I don't care if someone is a geek or not. But, I do care if someone is
productive enough. For being extreemly productive, it would be nice if
the person can learn to use whatever tool that comes their way. Even
if nothing fancy exists, you should still be able to do the job.

Vim is a great tool. I agree. But, don't disregard the IDEs. I don't
use IDEs for just syntax highlighting and auto indentation. these have
a lot more features. To start with, how do you like to know your
compilation errors, bad coding practices (static code review), dead
code etc.. as you type.... (even before you could save it).

I make a case for responding to two threads in one :-)

Like the other one who asked which is the best IDE, most newcomers, perhaps
because of our education system, expect an 'answer' (and only one correct
answer) to each of their doubts. And they are put off when each one has a
different 'answer - expressed in their own idiosyncratic ways.

I think it takes a little time outside the cocoon of our education system to
get used to the fact that there is no 'one right answer' to most problems in
real life.

A post lunch philosophical babble :-)

+1.  You can also add language, framework, OS, platform, etc is also
no barrier.

But this wisdom comes only after you complete the "Teach Yourself

I never use anything other than Vim. I have never worked on large

But a combo of UNIX command line know how and Vim is what I think UNIX geeks

actually the linux desktop is the best IDE - it is rather silly to run

Your point that IDE is not so important as the knowing the language is
good. But the point that language is not barrier is not quite correct.
This reminds of a tamil cinema dasaavataram, in which kamal's
(officer) assistance says that my boss can speak 5 language in telugu.
That how a X language programmer would program if he is asked to
program in language Y. If he studies thoroughly of of language Y then
it ok, which is not likely b'cos it would take at-least few months to
have some mastery over language Y. i mean to utilse the benefits of
language Y. Otherwise he would programming in language X with the
syntax of language Y when asked to switch to language Y. So in the end
he would not have utilized real stuff behind language Y.

When I had a requirement to work on j2me development on ubuntu, I found that
netbean + j2me combo was quick to setup and start working as  compared to
eclipse + j2me. If your intention is to get your app development started
quickly then go with one which fits the need. If you want to learn then  try
both.

Hi,

If you are a new java developer it's important that you start with the
command line. It helps you understand both the language and the IDE you
would eventually use for writing larger applications.

Regarding Netbeans vs. Eclipse, both are great. I have used them both
extensively. Eclipse does have an edge when it comes to choice of "official"
plugins (Android, GAE etc). But I feel Eclipse is bloated too much.

Netbeans has one USP which Eclipse cannot beat. The UI designer. If you are
into desktop application development with Java, nothing to beat this. It
gives the power of rapid application development (nearly VB like) for Java
developers. Eclipse does have a plugin but personally I feel that it does
not match Netbeans's internal support for UI design.

But Eclipse is not just an IDE. It is a platform. It provides a framework
for RCP (Rich Client Platform) applications. You can write applications
which runs inside the Eclipse platform.

Regards,
Arun

Please check log messages on the nfs-server. 
Check if there is is typing error in exports. I think the * is redundant there.
Try mounting /opt/ltsp/ manually in some other system in the network.
Check if some firewall rules prevents
what is the output /usr/bin/exportfs ?

Message-ID: <1310733479.29754.YahooMailClassic@web94708.mail.in2.yahoo.com>




Hello folks ,
?
I am interested to know which? is the best way os using the gcc compiler .
?
1) Should i use the gcc provided by the Linux distribution ?which comes with their own patches?and which is not the latest?gcc?( for ex: RHEL 5.x? or RHEL 6) or
2) Should i download the latest gcc from gnu website , install and start using it
?
option 2 has a catch , if? i?don't use? vendor supplied gcc , the warranty will be void if some thing breaks in production and if support issue is raised with vendor they will come back and ask which compiler is used .
?
But still i want to use the latest GCC compiler from gnu website because of lot of improvements and bug fixes .
?
Please advise , is it best practise to get the latest gnu gcc from gnu website or to use vendor supplied gcc for real time production .
?
Thanks
Narendra

Well, when I said that statement, I had already worked on VB, VC++,
Macros, eMbedded VC++,  Unix C++, PHP, PERL, Java, Delphi, Oracle
PL/SQL, DB2, MS SQL SP, SCHEME, Unix Shell Scripts, and a few names
that I forgot. All this across various OSs (DOS, Windows, AIX, HP UX,
Solaris, Various flavours of Linux, Windows for Mobile, etc..)

I repeat, when you learn to code properly, you don't have a language
barrier. But, you are more worried about the syntax.

Consider a carpenter. a Good one. If he is well versed in his skills,
would the tools, electric/ CNC/ manual stop him completely? He
wouldn't bother. He might strugle a bit, but evantually he will get
along. Polititians who make public speachs in various langugages are
also a good example. They might not be perfect, but they get the job
done. At the end of the day, thats what matters more.

Let me tell you a story that I heard long ago:

A ship was caught in a storm. The captain was old and weak. Each of
his subordinates boasted that they could tie a particular type of knot
and they are very good with it. And each one of them took turns to try
their luck, in vain.

Finally, the captain put a knot and saved the ship. He then said that
he is not as strong as others and the knot that he tied wasn't as
strong as the others might have been capable of. But his version
worked. By knowing what works where, and applying the logic correctly
actually helped him to save the ship :-)


Learn to code, Syntax is secondary.

You should use the gcc provided with the distribution, unless you have
a special requirement (a new feature, a new target architecture for
cross-compilation etc.).

> option 2 has a catch , if? i?don't use? vendor supplied gcc , the warranty will be void if some thing breaks in production and if support issue is raised with vendor they will come back and ask which compiler is used .

Yes, so why void the warranty?

> But still i want to use the latest GCC compiler from gnu website because of lot of improvements and bug fixes .

Most of the software included with distributions are fairly dependable
and stable. You should consider using an updated gcc only under the
event that you need a specific bug worked around or a specific new
feature. In my opinion, you can consider this option if you ever run
into such a situation (which, for ordinary usage, is unlikely).

> Please advise , is it best practise to get the latest gnu gcc from gnu website or to use vendor supplied gcc for real time production .

It is advisable to use the bundled gcc.

You need to invest time in seeing if the newer compiler improvements
actually make a difference to your application. Simply using a newer
compiler because it is 'new' is pointless. Most major bug fixes are
backported in vendor compilers (or you can get them backported), so
that should not be a bother. In fact the 'additional patches' you see
are almost always these backported fixes.

This could be because the mysql server is not running. Make sure that by
running

$ sudo service mysql status

If you are using XAMPP, assuming you installed it at /opt, use the following
command

$ sudo /opt/lampp/lampp status

This may help :

Obviously you are ignoring the fact that a compiler does not work in
isolation but in tandem with
 the toolchain and other utilities like gdb, ld, gas and so on.

Never mess with gcc. Use whatever you have available either using the
package system or in base.

Linux does not come default with gcc.

So you know how good an OS it is.

While the above statement may be true - please note that everyone
using Linux is not a C/C++ developer.   The flexibility is in the
packaging system each distro adopts.   Most distros have a
"Development" package group.    Developers can choose to install the
relevant group.

> So you know how good an OS it is.

l didnt tell that one who know one language well cant code in another
language. But the quality/performance of the code in the language (X)
in which he knows well will not be the same in the language he is
asked to code (Y). I mean in language Y he wont  utilize the unique
powers of that language.  So the benefits of switching to another
language is effetively shrunk. That why i have given the dasaavataram
example in my previous post. I think you convineanty skipped that
part. So a coder who is effiecent in FORTAN would be programing in
PASCAL in terms of FORTANT with the syntax of PASCAL. I am ***not
worried*** about syntax. But i am pointing to the fact that whether
the coder will be able to fully utilise the powers uniqe to that
language. One more example  to point out:
java offer OOPS. So when a pure structural C programmer is asked to
programs in OOPS. His code won't ultise much of the OOPS concept
powers and structures. This is just a example to clear my point and
not to be taken literaly and qoutes. Now a days all C programmer know
also how to do OOPS. Since it is a kind of basic things that gets
taught in college. So if he doesn't use the powers of that language, i
feel that it defeats the very purpose of choosing another language to
code. Lets take your example, I suppose you are expert in some
languages and not comfortable in few and in many language you are
comfortable but wont call yourself a expert. So i think i have made
myself clear enough.

Hi,

I am experimenting with Red5 Media Server. http://www.red5.org/
It is playing rtmp streams beautifully.

I have to make it play through rtmps (the SSL version of rtmp). Red5
supports rtmps. But documentation is very low and difficult. I have bought a
SSL certificate from GoDaddy.

Anybody in this list with experience on this?

Hi,

I use debian as upstream for a  package that i maintain for Fedora. Is there
any way i can get notified whenever the upstream maintainer updates a
particular package? For example
http://packages.debian.org/sid/lisp/emacs-goodies-el . I currently goto the
URL manually once/twice in a month and find out whether he has updated
anything. It is kind of  pain. Is there any better way?

You can subscribe to the package's tracking information by going to
http://packages.debian.org/e/emacs-goodies-el.html and submitting your
e-mail address bottom right form. That way, you receive upload
information, bug reports and other such details via e-mail.

HTH.

Message-ID: <CAOSkKiW8LHJQcjG5qRB1H8BLECJ3qBv_UKFEeyGwD-D+-4KpKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

My friend works as an IT administrator for a medium size Pharma
company that has 3 offices spread across India and lot of its
employees are mobile.
The company wants him to implement an open source/free enterprise
backup, and recovery solution. They also have some proprietary
analytics software that needs to be fed with the data that has been
generated throughout the day, across all their offices. They host this
proprietary softwares on a local data-center that is accessible from
all their offices. People so far used to upload all the data in the
evening, before leaving for home. But now, since they are expanding
and the data within the organization is growing at a rapid rate, they
want to have a local server sitting on their premise, where employees
from all their offices can upload bulk data (50-100 MB/employee/day).
This system should also enable people who are on move to access this
server sitting on their premise. So he is looking for a system where
people can upload the data at the end of the day and the system, in
turn, uploads this data to their data-center without needing any human
intervention. As data transfer over LAN is fast, people need not wait
long to upload their data.

Employees of this company use Linux, Windows, and Mac operating
systems. So if the solution comes with client software for these
mentioned OS's, it would be cherry on the pie. He need some
suggestions on choosing a smart open source enterprise backup solution
which can solve the said problem and also it would be very helpful if
someone can share his experiences with the security issues in such a
system.

Thanks,
DJ

Hi all,

Today (17/7/2011) few members from PuduvaiLUG went to attend the Opening and
First Meeting of Villupuram Linux Users Group.
Mr. Praveen Singh (Co-ordinator) of Villupuram Linux Users group was busy in
making arrangements for the meet to start.

The meet started by distribution of Juice, and it was Praveen singh, who
started his speech by explaining the need for a Linux User Group.
And then i took the chance to speak about the difference between the GPL of
Open Source  and EULA of Proprietary Software's.

Then explained the need for a change to Open source from Proprietary
softwares, played an audio clip which Mr.Shrinivasan has shared me long
back.
Then Praveen Singh displayed some videos showing graphical effects of Ubuntu
Desktop, and played a game called OpenArena (
http://www.openarena.ws/smfnews.php)

Then we explained the concept how Open Source works with the Example of
Mozilla projects.
Displayed the Video from Mozilla Website explaining how they are successful
because of Open Source ( http://www.mozilla.org/contribute/ ).

Then also showed the source code of Kernel, downloaded from Kernel.org

Praveen Singh also explained about the need for mailing list.

We strongly recommended that we are on the way to make india better by going
the Open Source way, against corruption (software piracy).

At the end we all gave a feedback in a written form of what can be done in
forth coming meets.

More detail about the meet will be updated in VillupuramLUG's Blog (
http://villupuramlug.wordpress.com ).

Dear Pudhuvai & Villupuram LUG group,

joining other people who wish you of keeping your good work - in
promoting / show casing FOSS for the general publlic.

What is surprising is - If I can say - backward districts !! like
vilupuram is having an own LUG, but other intelligent (!!!) districts
like trichy, tanjore, kumbakonam etc is not having anything on its
own.

I am not trying to start any flame war, but suddenly felt that
something is happening in some districts - which most of us are seeing
properly. Maybe if we could understand something from these
happenings, promotion of FOSS can be made more effective, and done
efficiently with less resources.

(This is what is the way that most of the commercial marketing
organisations does - for any products).

with warm regards

Please answer the question and help the community learn from your

I have been using GNU/fdisk since 1995 (in a plethora of Linux
distros)  and done *lots* of disk partitioning but never seen this
before.

In your place, I would encourage your "friend" to join such mailing
lists and forums and ask the questions directly, rather than use you
as a proxy.

IMO, you are asking for several unrelated requirement in one post  (on
behalf of your friend).

For clarity on each requirement, it is best to post the relevant
requirements separately.

**This is requirement no.1.**

The best practice for storage/backup is "online"  on fast storage NAS
or SAN, then close "inline" on slower disk storage or virtual disks
(tape) and finally on tapes (library).   Which part of this spectrum
is your friend interested in?

Take a look at amanda and bacula for "library" backup.  They are cross
platform but I am not sure about OS X client.

**This is requirement no. 2**

A "server" with FTP service will do.   You also have the option of
more sophistication with a DAM (Digital Asset Management) or DMS
(Document Management System).

A VPN server for remote users.   Once connected they have access to
the services on the LAN just as those in the physical office premises.
 openVPN is the easiest to setup.

**This is requirement no. 3**

On the FTP server your friend will need write software (could be a
simple shell script) that consolidates all the data for the
proprietary analytic package.

Both amanda and bacula are powerful tools with enterprise features.
Powerful tools also need system/network admins  with "AoM"  [1].

**This is requirement no. 4**

A well thought out set of iptables rules plus IDS like Snort should be
enough to get you started.

Your friend should set aside the time for RTFMs.    In my experience
they are the best source for information on setup as well as usage.
Join the respective mailing lists and forums if s/he gets stuck.
Typically, the developers of the software are also members.

A word of caution - some of them may not be as "user friendly" as this
list.   Therefore, your friend should do his/her homework and ask
specific questions.

In closing, I would suggest that you invite your friend to join the
mailing list and ask follow up questions directly.

Hi Arun,

Thanks for your elaborate mail. It helped a lot in learning more about
the backup solutions landscape.

>In your place, I would encourage your "friend" to join such mailing
>lists and forums and ask the questions directly, rather than use you
>as a proxy.

We were discussing his problem and I found it interesting for many reasons
and I decided to dig little deep into it. Considering your advice,
I've asked him to join the group and follow this thread.


>The best practice for storage/backup is "online"  on fast storage NAS
>or SAN, then close "inline" on slower disk storage or virtual disks
>(tape) and finally on tapes (library).   Which part of this spectrum
>is your friend interested in?

I was thinking that there must exist an open source alternative for
Dropbox (except
the share feature), which can de-duplicate and compress data before
backing it up "online".
We have the same data replicated on multiple laptops. So it would be
redundant to
store the same data again-and-again.

My apologies if this looks like another requirement. In future I'll
post the requirements separately.


>Take a look at amanda and bacula for "library" backup.  They are cross
>platform but I am not sure about OS X client.

Amanda serves most of our requirement. Digging into the source I could
see that it compresses and encrypts the data before transferring it to
the backup server. It also has plugins for uploading data directly to
some of the well known data-centers (Amazon S3 , Rackspace). But the
clients are closed-source. So if I'm using Amanda, We'll have to write
the clients (windows and OS X) ourself. My first impression of Bacula
is that it is not much different from Amanda, but I need to see the
source before I can judge.


Thanks,
dj

See duplicity and duplicati. It can compress, dedupe and encrypt data before
storing online.

These apps do not do global dedupe across backup sets from all laptops, but
that is something you can handle at a different layer.

GrandStream makes good soho ATA devices. Check your local reseller for
availability.

For hobbyist use, suggest you get used Cisco or Motorola ATAs off eBay.

I think you are referring to a GUI LDAP management utility whereas the
OP is about each individual users being able to change their
*respective individual* password w/o going through the LDAP

You can use ldapmodify command line tool and build a simple wrapper with some
 perl CGI code to make a web interface.

i execute "./configure", "make" and "make install" commands it generates .so
file which looks like this.

lib[name].so, in this case libjicmp.so

But i've modified the code to support traceroute too. Now, i want to
generate a .so file which reads "libjicmpt.so". And, i want to use these two
libraries simultaneously in my project. I tried replacing "jicmp" to
"jicmpt" in the configure file. But still my output library .so file is the
same "libjicmp.so" only.

Please suggest me the exact way to do this. Some pointers in the internet
should also be fine.

Thanks in Advance,
Murali V

Shouldn't you be modifying the Makefiles instead? If the project uses
autotools, check out Makefile.am.
All you need to do is add (or rename) 'libjicmpt_la_*' directives in
your Makefile.am.

Then you can proceed with a 'make distclean'.

As always the docs,

My answer is a little too late but I thought I'd voice my points,
having done some work on ERP.

I have fiddled with OpenERP in the past. It has a lot of India
specific modules. But, considering the nature of ERP, you will have to
end up making some customisation to the software. That will not only
require technical knowledge but domain knowledge as well.

> 2. By how are the ERP solutions generally deployed? Is it pay for both the

Software like OpenERP and OpenBravo are available free of cost and are
open source. There are other open source solutions too but IMO the
above are two of the best ones.
IMO, the ERP implementation process should go as below to achieve full
potential:
a) The internal process of the company are standardised and streamlined.
b) Inform the employees of the upcoming changes and make them feel
comfortable with the idea.
c) Setup the software as per the information obtained.
d) Carry out training.
e) Do trial run internally to make sure major issues are straightened out
f) Once satisfied, run ERP system in parallel with existing system.
This may go on for a full financial year too.
g) When things are deemed ready, discard the old system.

So, the costs  associated would include
a) Data collection and organisation.
b) Setting up the software
c) Customising the software
d) Training
e) Maintenance and support.

> 3. And a dumb one. Suggest a package / service. Preferably free license, as

As said above, OpenBravo and OpenERP are best suited packages, IMO. If
you want to try something really simple to begin with, try the
accounting and inventory modules.

Disclaimer: Above are my own views formed during the limited exposure
I've had to working on ERP systems. Do not take it as authoritative
source of information.

Hi Shrinivasan:

I got your contact details through the ILUG mailing list.

I am the Founder of ContractIQ - An intelligence platform for small
and midmarket firms to discover service providers. You can read more
about us at http://blog.contractiq.com/

We are looking for a contract-to-hire programmer/lead (with a bias for
extra-ordinary hackers from good universities)? in Chennai, who would
architect and code a part of our platform. This could turn into a very
rewarding full time role and some one who enjoys building internet
scale platforms and business intelligence systems (using FOSS), shall
absolutely love it. It also helps that we are backed by one of the
valley based startup accelerators.

For the start, we would have a contract for 3 months which would be
extended or converted into a full time role. We do intend to pay a
reasonable salary for the 3 month period and equity contributions if
it turns into a full time role.

If you happen to know someone, please refer our way.

Sorry. This could completely be an off-topic to the kind of activities
you generally engage in. Please point us to someone you may think
would be resourceful in such topics.

Appreciate your help!

Ashwin

Application: Pixelize

What it is:

Pixelize is a program that will use many scaled down images to
try to duplicate, as closely as possible, another image.

Pixelize works by splitting up the image you want rendered (or
duplicated) into a grid of small rectangular areas. Each area
is analyzed, and replaced with an image chosen from a large
database of images. Pixelize tries to pick images that best
match each area.

To know more about;

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install pixelize

Without a network diagram, it is **difficult** to understand the
topology of your network.

AFIAK, your "public" IP can be assigned only to the WAN port of your
router/modem to the ISP (in a typical setup).

See above remark.  Assuming that your VM is on "internal" network you
should assign it a "static" IP from the "private" IP number pool for
your LAN.  You have to assign port forwarding rules in your
router/modem to route packets to the "private" IP number of your VM.

IMO, one should have an understanding networking fundamentals under
one's belt. The Linux Network Administration Guide [1] is a good place
to start reading up about networking in Linux (as well as in general)

hi,

I have a deskjet F440 that works perfectly in fedora 14. But in 15 the

It appears, printer driver is not properly loaded. You can load it by
following commands:

~$ modprobe -l | grep "printer"

//It will display something like this:
kernel/drivers/usb/gadget/g_printer.ko

//then by use the following command as root:
//this will load driver module
~# modprobe g_printer

if the driver is properly loaded, it should work. Use different
application or command line "lpr" utility for testing.

Looks like fedora 15 uses cups-pk-helper-0.1.2 while fedora 14 used 
cups-pk-helper-0.0.4, thats seems like a major jump.

Both 0.0.4 and 0.1.2 have the same set of dependencies.

Fedora 15 Package Deps: http://bit.ly/oifRPR
Fedora 14 Package Deps: http://bit.ly/naBWwD

so you could try downloading 0.0.4. Try your luck with yum, although you 
might be better off directly installing the rpm since this one seems to 
be a simple package.

Message-ID: <CAND2795Tc8XQ5Vz==3WyfAT=z0BiNM5KHYhO2NM3FVwX_XJEdQ@mail.gmail.com>

With its ESA Summer of Code in Space, the European Space Agency (ESA)
is sponsoring the development of open source software that is space
related. As part of this event, which is organised in a similar way to
the Google Summer of Code, mentors suggest projects ? the list of
mentoring organisations includes the KStars virtual KDE planetarium
and the Marble desktop atlas; NASA, with its World Wind project; the
Spanish Universidad de Extremadura's Robolab; the Rock robot
construction kit; and the ffmpeg project.

The deadline for students to apply for one of the projects is 27 July
2011 and programming is scheduled to start on 1 August ? solutions
must be submitted no later than 30 October and will then be evaluated.
According to the FAQ, student stipends are to be paid on a similar
model to that used by Google's Summer of Code: an initial payment of
?1000 will be paid at the start of the coding period, with a final
payment of ?3000 at the end, provided the student's coding project was
judged to be successful by the mentoring organisation.

No, this is a bad idea. It might end up breaking his system. He should file

Baskar, you should perhaps collate all the colleges you've set up labs 
into a list and do a weekly announcement or something? Just wondering, 
as I'm seeing a lot of these mails lately, and don't see a reason for 
them to be separate announcements.


Vamsee.

Hi all

  It is looking like no kernel module is loaded for the printer.Compile
custom kernel with the following options

* Parallel printer support
* USB Printer support
* Printer Gadget

I like it the way it is, reading the college name & location in the 
subject. Please don't change it....

Baskar uses the same subject pattern in his email, a personal message 
filter might be a better solution.

Clearly from the output of the command 'lsmod', g_printer module is
not loaded. This g_printer module is the driver for usb-printer.
As a root it can be installed with "modprobe g_printer" command. (or
"cd /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/usb/gadget" and then as
root "insmod g_printer.ko")( Important note, for every reboot we have
to load this manually, if it is not automatically loaded by
scripts/utilities)

And the cups-pk-helper is an helper apps to configure printer. if it
is broken, we can use the "system-config-printer" utility to configure
printer. It can be installed from the repository. And it will not
broke the system.

Can you run this as a non-root user and check?

IMO, foss lab server at engineering college level is not  a right tool,
I believe teaching students on the installation process gives greater
understanding on various aspects of the trade.
Personally, I felt fosslab server announcement  is more of a noise and I
marked fosslab server poster under my spam tab.

          How does teaching installation "alone" help in understanding
various aspects of the "trade". I don't really understand what 'trade'
in this context means. But I don't see how not knowing the
installation of GNU/Linux or a specific tool will prevent a person
from using it well. Again, nothing prevents the students from learning
installation. Most of the FOSS labs are of the order of 30 machines.
And all colleges should have much more machines than that. Let them
try hands-on on those machines.

          You may classify it whatever you like and you are entitled
to have your opinion of calling it "noise". But you forget to see how
many students get exposed to FOSS with the efforts of Baskar. Without
this excellent efforts, most of those students would still be using
Windows and compiling C/C++ programs on Turbo C++ or MS VC++. The
objective of this group is to promote FOSS and to make people
understand the harm software patents and proprietary cause. And Baskar
is contributing in a great way towards that. Thanks

Hi,

>> How does teaching installation "alone" help in understanding
various aspects of the "trade". I don't really understand what 'trade'
in this context means.

In my experience with students, teaching installation is the first step of
exploring foss.

>> But I don't see how not knowing the installation of GNU/Linux or a

from using it well.

Self starters may find it easier to start from any point, but finger holding
students are those who need systematic way of imparting of technology. In my
experience I found the later kind of pupils are more at  private engineering
colleges in tamilnadu (samples from where i visited) .

problem solved - cups not installed. 15 has a choice of desktop,
developer or webserver for installation. I chose developer not realising
that in its zeal to prevent global warming, Redhat does not encourage
developers to use printers. Apparently developers are not expected to
use office or most of the system-config utilities also. Thanks guys for
your help. (did someone say that this list is unfriendly?)

looking forward to seeing your forthcoming announcements of all the installations you have done using the

They are two different things, and you shouldn't confuse between the two.

I agree that when students learn to install things (on their own) they
learn it better. What Baskar has been doing caters to a different need
and requirement.

I disagree. First step is let them use few good tools (preferably GUI) and
let them know that FOSS can produce better tools than proprietary ones, then
let them know how FOSS works(philosophies) and then teach them command line
tools and then go into hard part of they themselves installing and
troubleshooting stuff.

What you are suggesting is I need to first learn how to assemble a computer
before I can start using it. (Why not start with micro-electronics & chips?
even better! ;-)

Good suggestion, but i worked in a team that went from linux basics to

Different people have different styles of presentation. If the above
approach works for you, well and good.

It is not a question of what is learnt first. But, these are actually
essential things to know for budding computer "engineers".

It depends on where you want to draw the level of abstraction, who the

presentation.

I have actually found people who understand hardware to write better C
programs than others. But, that has just been my experience.

That's what I implied. So saying somebody is not doing enough to post on
this list about it is not good. They are doing what they think is best for
their goals & intended audience. Others are also welcome to post their
efforts at implementing their idea of how to teach FOSS. :-) I will be happy
to read about it and encourage them too.

Please trim your quotes.

Back to your posting - this is a whole new area for me.   I plan to do
some R&D with asterisk and freeswitch as well on a very small setup (2
nodes to be precise).

At this time my experience in this area is zilch.

Perhaps you could start a new thread with your own experience.

Best,

Application: Scribus

What it is:

Scribus is an open source desktop page layout program with the aim of
producing commercial grade output in PDF and Postscript, primarily,
though
not exclusively for Linux.

Features:

Scribus can be used for many tasks; from brochure design to
newspapers, magazines, newsletters and posters to technical
documentation. It has
sophisticated page layout features like precision placing and rotating
of text and/or images on a page, manual kerning of type, bezier curves
polygons,
 precision placement of objects, layering with RGB and CMYK custom
colors. The Scribus document file format is XML-based. Unlike
proprietary binary file formats, even damaged documents, can be
recovered with a simple text editor.

To know more about it:

Yes, Indian Students are not eligible but yet we can  view the list of
projects and respective organisations, i wish we can take ideas from those
and develop it. Is that legal? Since they have let the ideas open. Thanks

Thank you for your help.
I already tried the things you said.my APN name is "mizone" and GPRS
is enabled on my phone.
The problem is my phone uses a proxy setting for the connection .
Proxy : 10.0.0.10 and port :9401
But i didn't get any option to set that and and it always fails to
connect. I also did the proxy settings in Firefox.But the main
connection is not established.I have been able to get internet access
on Windows platform but not on Ubuntu.

As I found my FOSS lab setup (note, the context is not about our FOSS lab
server but the FOSS labs we are establishing in Engg. colleges) announcement
seems to create noise for few people in the list, I have decided to stop by
postings here and continue to post them in my fosslab list.

Some stats about the FOSS lab setups we have done so far:

1. Starting from April 21 '2011 to July 22' 2011 we have setup FOSS labs in
82 engineering colleges (and about to reach 130+ before August)

2. About 10,000+ students getting benefited by this effort. (almost many
students have done compilation of Linux kernel from source and have
successfully booted from them)

3. Almost many engineering colleges have temporarily stopped their purchase
of Proprietary software recommended by University and started evaluating
FOSS alternatives.

4. From the next academic year, many engineering colleges would start
teaching FOSS right from the first year (OpenOffice / GCC / Shell
Programminig and no more Turbo C / M$ Office).

5.  I can confidently say that the proprietary software domination in our
engineering education is seeing its end (especially in Tamilnadu).

Thanks for everyone who supported / supporting me all the time.

Please don't stop posting such news here.

It will help us some of us encourage us to slowly soften the rigidity
of the people who matter.


Remember numbers matter.

This will also help build up momentum to start the minor waves and
major FOSS tidal waves.

Please remember this list is also archived in gmane.org too which has
a much wider audience.

Of course, Proprietary software will be there.

I repeat my request please post your success stories here.

Ignore the usual 20% naysayers. They are required for us to do more.
After all what is the of say, a film critic? making films?

With best wishes and warm regards.

Baskar, as I seem to have started this, let me clarify: I'm in no way 
opposed to your posting the stats here. Usually I read the announcements 
and think "oh, cool" and delete it. I just thought it is a lot better to 
collate the stats and give a list of the colleges/places every week or 
so. That way, the numbers will be clearer to everybody and the impact 
will be more quantifiable. Just a suggestion.

Vamsee.

Subject: [SFD-announce] SFD 2011 registration is LIVE!!!
To: SFD announcements <sfd-announce at sf-day.org>, "Discussions about
planning for SFD (english)" <planning-en at sf-day.org>


Dear all,

This is with a great pleasure (and small delay) that we are announcing
registration opening for SFD 2011! In fact some of you have already
started to create you wiki pages and participated in the soft opening
and registration testing that we started 2 days ago. Most bugs should
have been cleared out of the way and I remain available for any problem
you may encounter through email or on IRC (#SFD on freenode).

Major highlights of the registration rewriting:
- I didn't get any help from anyone so it took more time (I am no developer)
- UTF-8 support, so all those South-American addresses we used to
struggle with because of corrupted letters should be problems of the past
- Better SFD Wiki URL check (I'd say 100% reliable now)
- Ported to python so I can 'maintain' it now
- The form asks for and matches SFD wiki login and email address which
will allow you to update map coordinates later (still need to code that
update bit)
- Fixed Open Street Map marker click offset
- Total event count on the global map page
- Easy integration with the current web site design, and any design.
That will make it easier for others to use it since we said we would
release the code (still needs to do some cleanup and documentation
writing though)
- Saves directly in CSV format making it a lot easier to handle that big
file at the end of the registration period.

There are still one or two known issues (like the phone number format
only gets check on the server side, requiring you to refill the form if
you got it wrong - but we're working on it).

Hopefully it should make the whole experience better and allow us to fix
or improve it based on the feedback we get. A special thanks goes to
Charles from Canada who spotted a very annoying address input bug and
Jean from Belgium who sent me an extensive report, and all the others
who participated.

The other news for the year is that we are cash positive again and
goodies are in production as we speak. This year we have raised
sufficient funds to produce team packs for 200 teams (50% of last year
total registered events).

I want to particularly thank our sponsors who are making this possible,
namely Canonical, Google, Nokia/Qt in China and Linode. We have also
attracted more media sponsors this year (from 2 to 5 in total now) where
we are running a A4/Letter size ad in the August/September edition for
most (some are quarterly magazines). In no specific order those are
Linux Magazine (long time partner), Linux Journal (yeah, welcome!),
Ubuntu User, Admin Magazine and Smart Developer. And we are still in
discussion with 2 or 3 other organizations.

This year we also had a lot of back and forth with the Free Software
Foundation about the impact of distributing non-free GNU/Linux
distributions and pretending 'it is ok'. At the end proprietary software
remains proprietary be it an office application or a device driver. Our
objective is to educate the world about using high quality free and open
source software and that is what we should be doing. This is a long
topic and we will get back to it later this summer.

Like last year there are about 10 days to goodies deadline (limited to
the first 200 teams and Canonical is still providing Ubuntu CDs), so
just go create a new team page under
http://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org/2011 (not continent this year) and
fill that form on http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/cgi-bin/register.py

Last but not least I want to thank all the new volunteers who have
joined the SFD global marketing team and are helping with global tasks.
One of the net outcome has been our new SFD logo for 2011 which we will
keep moving forward (thank you David, Jeff and Maxus Singapore) and the
multimedia DVD which we have finally managed to make (thank you Diego,
Marcos, Pockey). All artworks are available on
http://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org/Artwork and under a CC-BY license.

And happy SFD preparations!

Subject: [Ilugc] has anyone been successful in getting Chrome/chromium on
 rhel5.4 up and running
Message-ID: <CA+MGHiq7c-Su5ouoBZ7ajDo+GujLeEe6ipd2xRb3vneLhtY7vw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ,

I have a rhel 5.4 desktop for official work. I have been usign google
chrome on my windows laptop and got quite used to it. I like it very
much. Now i want to stop depending on windows laptop and migrate to
linux desktop. All problems have been solved in moving to linux
desktop except for one not so critical but good to have  requirement
being fulfilled . That requirement is having either google chrome or
chromium on my desktop, Right now i am using firefox for all the
activites. I have able to get exchange emails working with thunderbird
and vpn to connect, etc. But i am unable to get chrome up and running.
What google says is rhel packages are very old and they wont provide
pre build rpm s for rhel. And what chromium says is they need a list
of packages with the minimum required package versions. And some of
they packages are not provided by rhel5.4. The highest package
available in rhel repos are atleast one minor point below the required
package version. Thus effectively saying what google is saying at the
begining in simple words. You cannot install chromium on rhel5.4 Since
rhel 5.4 is too old. I cant raise a ticket with rhel guys b'cos it has
to be routed through the company and those are lot of hassle. If i
press through then then they will ask me to switch to windows laptop
they have given me. I see that a japanese guy have been able to
provide a repo package for getting chromium browser up and running in
centos5. But that refuses to install in rhel5 saying the obivous thing
that my platform is not centos5.  So i am asking the community if
anyone has been successful or know how to successfully get chrome up
and running in rhel5.4 x64. I would also require flash to be working.

with regards,
ashwin

You can use the src rpms(s) of chromium on centos and rebuild them for
RHEL5. use the 'rpmbuild' utility. Good luck.

It is an interpreted language.

If you want to hide the source use a compiled language. Even perl can
be compiled
 into an intermediate form.

Python is a choice for you.

Shell scripting is the most basic programming structure but then it is
very useful and
advanced since it gives you a lot of things that are incredibly useful.

Any specific reason to obscure source rather than keeping it open?

Hi All,

I have mounted  an nfs4 share on the client from a server with rw
permissions. I am not using any authentication methods for now.
On the  client side, nfs4 mount,  i am able to create files and folders
using nautilus which get reflected on the server.
But when I check the user permissions of the file/folder created on the nfs4
shared partition on the server, I see that it is created with someother user
on the server.
how do i map usernames on client to server correctly ?
please let me know.
Thanks!
KM

&gt; 3. Almost many engineering colleges have temporarily stopped their purchase
&gt; of Proprietary software recommended by University and started evaluating
&gt; FOSS alternatives.
&gt;
&gt; 5.? I can confidently say that the proprietary software domination in our
&gt; engineering education is seeing its end (especially in Tamilnadu).
&gt;

That is why M$ started this kind of MoU :

Thank you for your help.
I already tried the things you said.my APN name is &quot;mizone&quot; and GPRS
is enabled on my phone.
The problem is my phone uses a proxy setting for the connection .
Proxy : 10.0.0.10 and port :9401
But i didn&#39;t get any option to set that and and it always fails to
connect. I also did the proxy settings in Firefox.But the main
connection is not established.I have been able to get internet access
on Windows platform but not on Ubuntu.

Hi,

I needn't have to rebuild the src rpms. Instead i got a easier way out
through this link

Right now i am posting this message via chromium in rhel 5. I am happy.

These mappings are possible with user local uid/gid settings but it
can be an administrative nightmare.

You need some kind of a "directory service" that provides global
uid/gid mappings across all machines.

 LDAP is an alternate solution.     openLDAP  support CIFS (aka samba)
integration.

(LDAP has been discussed in this list a few times; check the list archives)

The package is provided by a third party that you are trusting
blindly.   The tar bundle contains a cache directory along with a
bunch of files in it.

How to open a application in the client side using Javascript/PHP page. I am

But its possible using activex control in Windows. Is any possibility for
Linux.

You need an applet/control to access local resources (must be granted
access by the user either one time or every time) like you've seen
even in Windows.

Search for XPCOM to see a DCOM like cross-platform object model. You
could do th same with Java applets too.

Are you talking about AJAX?

It is not specific to OS. Except IE, in all other browsers you can use
XMLHttpRequest [1] to load contents asynchronously.

[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest

I think the OP meant to ask some thing else. In any case, my teams
used aynchronous XMLHTTPRequest calls in IE first in 1999. It has been
a while and so I may be naming it wrong, but this feature first
appeared in IE as far as I can remember. It came to other browsers
atleast a year or two later.

Oh you are right. The concept was originally from Microsoft, but the
Javascript wrapper object named XMLHttpRequest was created by Mozilla which
has become the standard. Just this wrapper object was not supported in older
versions of IE, where you have to use the ActiveXObject.

Well I'm using loop mobile in Mumbai. my APN is "mizone" proxy address
is 10.0.0.10 and the port is 9401.The dialing number being *99***1#. I
have to set it same for all the protocols in firefox browser. I tried
out the proxy settings @ preferences > network proxy . But still the
connection is not established.
I think everything is all right just there is one ingredient missing
and I'm not able to figure it out what it is.

Very strange way of asking questions on mailing lists.

What research have you done?

What is your doubt?

Help is got when an attempt is made to help oneself.

Did you try finding out by googling?

Did you read any books?

Did you try anything? What was the confusion?

(Assessment year 2011-2012) and available on the same site,
http://freedom-matters.in . Kindly spread the word. Also, I just
successfully filed my own returns using the migrated spreadsheet using
LibreOffice 3.3.2 :-).

The goal of this endeavour is that no person who wants to file ITR and
does not have MS Excel should suffer because of this partiality by the
Government. But we are still a long way from this. The problem is,
every year the form changes, since tax rules change, so this migration
is going to be difficult in future. We need to get the Government / IT
Department to stop favouring MS Excel. They are only making it harder
for non-MS Office users. Kindly lets continue this discussion and
effort to put pressure on the concerned people to make a change in
this department.

Kudos! But may be a bit late with only 4 more days ?, also there was no note
on the site that Work in Progress for 2011-12 even last week. :( , filed
using proprietary software :(

Well they realized the problem of favouring MS Excel, so they released ITR1
alone on interactive adobe form which can be used without buying MS
Office(still needs Windows, didnt work on Adobe on Ubuntu). The problem is
they need to provide "free" alternative as well.

Ok solved! Solution:

1. Remove current httpd
2. Install mod_ssl ( httpd-2.2.17-jason.1 installed ).

Dear all
On behalf of ILUGC, Mr.Baskar Selvaraj and myself conducted one day wokshop on FOSS in Adhiparasakthi Engg College, Mel Maruvathur. It was attended by about 80 students of various engg college. The topic covered were -Intro to FOSS, perl,mysql,kernel compilation and virtualisation.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank the management and Prof.Mariappan HOD CSE and other faculty members for the opportunity.

Message-ID: <CAKzQhe5_=JS5W9ObRUiLZwJ=M-KnA-CqtN6v6wJ6nBP2BovGvw@mail.gmail.com>

Sir,
Since this is my first encounter with GCC, I am totally a newbie.
When I tried to run the following program using GCC it gave me some errors.

Program :

# include <stdio.h>
# include <conio.h>

 void main()
{
clrscr();
printf("First program using GCC");
getch();
}

Errors:

first.c:2:20: fatal error: conio.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

When I removed conio.h header file it gave me errors regarding clrscr() and
getch() since these two functions are defined in conio.h

So my questions are:
1) How to clear the output screen (replacement of clrscr() ) in GCC ?
2) Is there any similar  kind of replacement for getch() too ?
3) Why conio.h doesn't work in GCC ?

system("clear");      //You Need cstdlib headder file. so  do #include<cstdlib>

getchar();            // you Needs stdio.h so do #include<stdio.h>

<conio.h> is not part of the standard library. Any functions that are
prototype in that header are also non-standard.

Use system() for clearing the screen. The replacement would be:
system ("clear");

2) Is there any similar  kind of replacement for getch() too ?
>

conio.h is specific to some DOS compilers. Same functionality can be
acheived using ncurse library. Ref:
http://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/

Having said that, getch() is a function defined in ncurse library and you
should link the curses library when compiling your program.

After these modifications your program should look like:

****************************************
# include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
    system ("clear");
    printf("First program using GCC");
    getch();
}
****************************************

You compile the program with the following command:
gcc -lcurses -o hello hello.c--

This is not a C program at all. Just remove "include <conio.h>" and
 it will compile.

$ make f

if the program is f.c

or

$ gcc f.c -o f

of even just

$ gcc f.c

output in a.out.

Run it with

$ ./a.out

If you want to compile only and not link

then

$ gcc -c f.c

If you want to only preprocess then

$ gcc -E f.c

and so on.

You can also use the

$ gcc -O2

switch along with others like -fomit-frame-pointer and
 100 other switches.

You don't need this. It is a C program. Not C++.

These are nCurses calls. Include

#include <curses.h>

or just

$ man getch

Here is an except:


>urs_getch(3)                                                    curs_getch(3)

NAME
       getch, wgetch, mvgetch, mvwgetch, ungetch, has_key - get (or push back)
       characters from curses terminal keyboard

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       int getch(void);
       int wgetch(WINDOW *win);
       int mvgetch(int y, int x);
       int mvwgetch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);
       int ungetch(int ch);
       int has_key(int ch);

> So my questions are:
> 1) How to clear the output screen (replacement of clrscr() ) in GCC ?

It is not a compiler thing. This is a nCurses library feature.

C is meant to be a very thin language with most features provided by
standard libraries.

As opposed to perl or python where the language itself has  several
OS, networking and
 file I/O bindings.

> 2) Is there any similar ?kind of replacement for getch() too ?

Yeah. Without using nCurses you can do getchar(). This is available as
part of standard
 C library.

> 3) Why conio.h doesn't work in GCC ?

Because it is C++.

Don't learn it. C is a great language. Stick to it.

The following is what u need on Linux,

#include <stdio.h>
#include <curses.h>

void main()
{
     initscr();                         // initialize curses screen
     printw("First program using GCC"); // note the printw
     getch();                           // get single character
     endwin();                          // end screen
}

To compile include -lcurses. And, If you need more terminal 
functionality like creating boxes, adding colors etc., try to find a 
curses tutorial on the web, it will be helpful.

If you don't want/like curses, then the following code will do the job 
but this is a bit advanced,

#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <termios.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>

int main(void)
{
     char* ptr = "First program using GCC";
     char  ch;

     struct termios cTerm;

     write(1, "\033[H\033[J", 6);     // Goto Home + Erase to Bottom

     ioctl(0, TCGETS, &cTerm);        // Get Terminal Structure
     cTerm.c_lflag &= ~(ICANON|ECHO); // read char by char + no echo
     ioctl(0, TCSETS, &cTerm);        // Set Terminal Structure

     write(1, ptr, strlen(ptr));      // Unbuffered write to stdout
     read(0, &ch, 1);                 // Unbuffered read from stdin

     cTerm.c_lflag |= (ICANON|ECHO);  // Reset canonical mode + echo
     ioctl(0, TCSETS, &cTerm);        // Set Terminal

     return 0;
}

conio.h is a feature of DOS compilers as some have already mentioned. There
is no connection between C++ and conio.h and conio.h will not work even if
you compile using g++

In fact standard C++ headers that are not borrowed from C do not have .h
extension and even borrowed ones are now deprecated in latest standards.

Message-ID: <CABmCGuCbwcBVTEVgo0d7HnR6Q5PXnN81kUM7YmXsiojgV7u3yw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Back in 2007, Girish gave a very detailed session on networking for
two days. Though I wasn't able to attend the seminar, the slides that
Girish had prepared ( I thik T Srini also gave a helping hand) was
very deatiled and helpfull.

I was talking about this session to some of my friends and there is a
renewed interest in the topic. I was searching for the slides from
that session and hit a dead end, except for this:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc/41725/

But, unfortunately the 200 odd slides presented on those days are not
accessible anymore. Does anyone - Girish/ Shrini / Others still have a
copy of the same? It would be wonderfull, if it could be shared again.


with regards,
Natarajan.

I agree with you. It will be wonderful to have the slides.

Let me search. It must be in some hard disk.

It was hosted in a site called sirsasana.org which is no longer alive.

I had the PDFs with me somewhere but they have receded from
memory and importance; washed away by the sands of time...

There is a DOS/Windows line-ending character ^M at the end of the 
shebang line. Can you remove it and try running the script again? 
'dos2unix' utility can help you do that or you could do a global search 
and replace in your favorite editor or use sed or whichever way is 
convenient for you.

there is no ^M character in file I opened in vi editor and also in gedit,
Its only 6 lines of code.

when I try to run
$ sh yuicompress.sh

I get this error

$ yuicompress.sh: 3: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting "do")

My code i.e. in yuicompress.sh

#!/bin/sh
for file in `find . -name "*.js"`
do
echo "Compressing $file ?"
java -jar ~/yuicompressor-2.4.6/build/yuicompressor-2.4.6.jar --type js -o

cp youscript.sh test.sh

Delete the first line and save the file.
Add the #!/bin/sh line again.

Run the program and let us  know how that worked.

PS - What distro are you using?  (Doesn't make much difference.)

In VI, you could also try,

:%s/^V^M//g

which will remove the ^M characters.   The ^M character is the "Return" key on the keyboard.  Obviously there is a hidden ^M character.

Let us know if this fixed your problem.

there is no ^M character in file I opened in vi editor and also in gedit, Its only 6 lines of code.

when I try to run

I get this error

Subject: [Ilugc] SO_REUSEADDR in conjunction with INADDR_ANY  issue
Message-ID: <1311885979.132.YahooMailClassic@web94704.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

Hello all ,

How can we allow a server to bind to a port that appears to be held open by a client process?? The netstat below indicates that port 9521 is not being listened
to by any server process:

$netstat -an | grep 9521
tcp??????? 0????? 0 127.0.0.1:9521????????????? 127.0.0.1:9521????????????? ESTABLISHED
tcp??????? 0????? 0 10.1.235.31:47776?????????? 10.1.19.219:9521??????????? ESTABLISHED
?

The forum does not endorse any particular distro. Everyone have their
own specific requirements and they choose distros based on whichever
meets them.

For your second question:
All three. How many serious users have you come across have used
Virtualization on any platform other than Linux? And Linux is preferred
when you consider running "any" general server software.

> Please let me know if there is a Web site that show distro use break down in

None that I know of. In no particular order as far as I know, the
popular distros are:

Linux Mint
Ubuntu
Fedora
Gentoo
Arch

Hello friends,

World is gearing for the software freedom day celebrations.
If we are looking for alternative venues , I found an open air theatre at
Anna Nagar Tower Park, The other one which fascinates me is the Independence
Day park behind valluvar kottam. These places are looking prominent ones,
though the contact has to be established with the chennai corporation
authorities.
IMO, These places are good for lectures however not ideal one for
conducting   LDD kind of activities.
Birla Planetarium is good for both lecture and LDD activities.
Please suggest the ways and means of finding an alternative place.

Add your thoughts,

regards
Thyagarajan Shanmugham

Yes.

Irrelevant. Meaningless.

Some tech company exec told me that Google is using OpenBSD.

That is not something I care about. Should I?

If I like a girl who everybody likes would that be good? ;)

Anyway now that is beside the point.

Please don't go for what the world decides. People have different
reasons to choose something.

For instance India is a vegetarian nation by and large. The fact that
the entire West is
mired in something else does not alter the fact or make us convert.

Does it?

Think.

Ok this should be in FIN_WAIT or FIN_WAIT2 or something.

If it is connected how will the socket be free?

I know this question really really well.

I have faced this problem several times.

But I still can't answer it. I use

setsockopt( ... SO_REUSEADDR..)

and

setsockopt(...SO_REUSEPORT..)

under linux.

It is something similar for Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD or any other UNIX.

Now if you don't find that the port is relinquished after a few
seconds then some other resource is
holding on to it.

netstat should tell you.

My answer is not direct;that is deliberate.

Do your homework.

You have done a great deal of tech stuff I know. Hopefully this tip will help.

Best of luck.

I want every luggie to aspire to be like Narendra. Do your homework
with clear focus
 and share your results before asking something in forums.

Best,
Girish

Birla Planetarium will be an ideal choice. Instead of thinking about venue let us concentrate on publicity to attract more people.

Hopefully, you have understood the "root" cause of your problem.

DOS/Windows text files have two chars for each line EOL and CR.
Whereas *nix based text files have only EOL.  CR (^M) create havoc in
your shell scripts.

For shell scripts it is best to use the text editors on *nix platforms.

         The problem here was because of line endings as pointed out
by others. In DOS/Windows, line endings would be "\r\n", commonly
called CR LF. In UNIX, it is just "\n", or just LF. So, if you edit a
file in windows(say Notepad) and view it in UNIX, you will find ^M,
which is the "\r". This wikipedia link[0] might help. dos2unix removes
these additional characters and hence solves the problem.

         If you run into this issue again, try doing ":set list on" in
vi/m. That would show you the meta characters as well(like tabs,
spaces line endings etc.). IIRC, Emacs should show them by default.
Not sure about gedit others. etc. Thanks

Open a raw socket and send an RST to this port.  This will cause
the server to close the connection immediately.

If in doubt consult Richard Stevens' books TCP/IP Illustrated
Vol 1 and 2.

This shell script has other bad practices which should be
avoided:

1. Don't run programs like find in back ticks and capture output.
    If the output from find is large, then shell will end up using a
    lot of RAM or run out of RAM and break.  Back ticks is also
    a security risk.

2. Always protect your scripts from file names with spaces.  In
    your case a filename with a space character will break your script.


Best option is to use the -exec flag in find and invoke commands
directly.  See the man pages.
Eg.  find . -name \*.js -exec gzip '{}' ';'

If there are too many matches, then use xargs.
Change all dirs to 755 permissions like this:
Eg. find . -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 755

Have a look at the Zeitgeist Project (http://zeitgeist-project.com/).
It is a work in progress and there might be a lot of rough edges.

Search using your package manager for 'zeitgeist' and
'gnome-activity-journal' packages, If it is there, you could install
it easily. I haven't used Fedora, so someone else might be able to
provide a better answer.

Please avoid top posting. If you have no idea about posting styles,

Are you suspecting it could be malicious or is it that you know for

Nice suggestion, Is it possible for you to get in the contact and obtain
permission from the relevant authorities for conducting our activities. .

The most important think is the Finance component, I heard from Shrini that
we have around  2000/- . Need to think about giving prizes to the best
stalls(if we are going to have LDD kind of display for this .SFD).

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

You have an enterprise Linux installed in your system.   It has a
package management system that ensures integrity of the system;
package dependencies as well as trust worthiness of the packages.

It is best to install packages that are created from trusted source
and signed by the author(s) with a WoT.    Otherwise, it is best to
build your own from source code.

The package you have downloaded may well have been created from
trusted sources but without a verifiable signature how do you know
that indeed it is the "original" package posted by the author?

If you are using linux in your personal computer or laptop and if you are in
ubuntu just insert an blank cd and open the ISO file with Brasero Disc
Burner and write it in the cd and now you have got a live + installable cd.
put in your lab system and boot from cd.

It is true that i am running the not so trusted package in enterprise
system. But it is not a server, but a system used as my desktop. It
has enterprise linux b'cos it is also meant for testing the code i
develop and for logging into production machines, since the code i
develop must be working in similar environment. and it has to be
secure b'cos it is exposed to production machines. But apart from
these two reasons this is not a production server by itself. Used more
as a testing ground for the perl scripts and bash scripts i develop
quite frequently and for which i make heavy use of internet whenever i
am stuck. So the browser i use is important b'cos it affects my
productivity.

yes i understand there is a risk of untrusted code being injected into
the system b'cos of unsigned package. But the reality is, no one is
giving a version of chromium (OSS) that could be run in my version of
rhel (which is still active not eol'ed) . And when i try to compile
from source it becomes almost impossible to compile b'cos current code
in svn of chromium is dependent on a hell a lot of libraries that are
not yet made available in rhel 5.4. So which means i have compile
those dependency library as well. i am not sure if there are more
dependencies for these dependent libs. If true s then i would be in
what is popularly know as "dependency hell", further when compiling
from source you have no easy way to stay updated with security
vulnerabilities as yum wont know about these packages. So in the end i
am exposed to security risk either way, compiling from src or using
unsigned package. AFAIK what this guy has done is he has taken a
legacy code which can work with the exisitng rhel 5.4 libs . So there
is a security risk that this chromium is unpatched. But since i am a
part of ops team, i have fairly good knowledge on the types of attack
and fast enough to identify the malicious sites, etc. It will become
difficult for cracker to break through my PC, since it is not directly
exposed to internet, and has a layer of firewall in between that does
some level of filtering and my PC is fully patched except for this
one. Considering the fact the many people are on the internet with
windows 2000 and similar. The amount of threat i am exposed to is
fairly minimal. In case you know of any specific violation in this
version of chromium pkg then please let me know, in which case i am
ready to take a dig inside dependency hell and try out my luck. But
without that it is just too much effort to achieve too little.
Further i have a question, are all signed packages trust worthy ? i
think we can  take this discussion to another thread, if people are
interested. I know a popular thread that happened in late 2004 or
early 2005 between the then ilugc's of sridhar ratna and sriram K.
where they battled out if linux is better security than windows by
design? In the end conclusion was something like linux is not entirely
away from security problems of windows. Theoretically atleast what
happened to windows can happen to linux as well, as most security
vulenrabilites are exploited not purely by technical stuff but
involves a fair level of user stupidity. which no matter how secure
you build your OS , will be cracked if the user makes stupid moves. So
lets not discuss this here, create a separate thread if interested.
Please don't discuss this user/tech topic here and contain ourselves
to chromium issue. period. Please search ilugc archives if interested.

with regards,
ashwin

It will be helpful, if you *reply* instead of sending fresh mail. AFAIK, we
do not pay any rent to Birla Planetarium. So rent will also be a factor in
venue decision.

my wife and kids got fed up with mandriva - too slow and bloated and
have switched to fedora. So I cannot comment.

Did anyone try BOSS Linux ? It hasn't been mentioned once, considering 
we are all being very patriotic. The last time I tried, to try it, the 
download link was broken and their IRC channel was of no help.

Hi,

??? ??? I am using Ubuntu 11.04. Audio is not clear while playing any music, videos etc., I also tried alsamixer in terminal to adjust the settings, but still the problem exists.
If i watch any video clips online the sound is not working. Is there any solution? I know that Ubuntu doesnt want to install any sound drivers, its all built-in.

Solution please!

More details please!

What's your hardware? Processor, RAM, Audio/motherboard....?

Is it a kind of static that you are listening or is it crackling? Try
out a different set of speakers (headphones,....) and check if they
are alright.

Also, I have noticed that having your mic, front mic and line in
unmuted also causes static... try muting them.

Please post your question in a different thread instead of changing the

Do you have solution in Linux working ?, it works fine in Solaris .

I used the setsockopt( ... SO_REUSEADDR..) in my code , still its not working , still the same issue

?
?I believe SO_REUSEPORT is not portable , its more used in BSD Unixes and i believe that its functionality is covered by SO_REUSEADDR under linux as per manual 

I have tried? couple of more options for reusing the port by setting the kernel parameters (TCP_TW_RECYCLE and TCP_TW_REUSE)? , not much luck here also .

Nothing like that. These differences are normal between UNICes.

What? Why do you do things not necessary?

I have never heard of these. Look at

# sysctl -a

and grep for tcp or net.inet.tcp or something.

Narendra,

Your problem is that you are not doing the correct design.

No amount of digging around will solve that.

Certainly SO_REUSEADDR is unnecessary.

If you wait for few seconds, the port gets released by the kernel automatically.

You have connections in ESTABLISHED state and how do you expect to bind to it
again?

You have fundamental flaws in your understanding of TCP/IP.

Fix that. And stop bothering about these advanced concepts not at all relevant
 to your problem.

Keep things simple. That is the way all great programmers do
 great things.

You want to view the remote desktop from a browser?

I have not heard any popular program to do this. Perhaps there is something
 obscure that Luggies might know.

You have to download and double click the tightvnc viewer. It is tiny
and there is no need to
 install on a Windows client machine.

Try saving in RTF format which is an open standard.

In fact long ago I created a much better Word document using UNIX tools that
 would open perfectly in MS Word.

Try RTF. It might not let you down...

In you are using Fedora 15,

# yum install gnome-shell-extension-pidgin gnome-shell-extensions-drive-menu

restart your gnome shell,  alt+f2, press 'r" and enter.
