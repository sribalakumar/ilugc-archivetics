You need to buy Redhat Enterprise Linux. However, Fedora is free of cost.

I personally find Fedora very pleasing to use. Pardus is another distro
that does not receive the spotlight that it deserves. It is extremely well
integrated and is quite stable.

However, if you are looking for a Redhat based Distro, Fedora, Omega
etc. will do good

I have an older Nokia N73 and Ubuntu 9.04. I use multisync (and
multisync-gui) to synchronise contacts and the calendar between my phone
and Evolution. There's some sort of guide here:
<http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=260676> of which you can skip
the bit about adding repositories because modern Ubuntus carry working
versions. Good luck.

In the end result, you should be able to turn on Bluetooth on your
phone, and on your laptop and click sync and have everything happen
automatically (it will prompt for conflicts though). If you have Ubuntu
One and choose the appropriate address book then your contacts will also
propagate to other computers of yours on Ubuntu One. Nice, eh?

will work on it - just for the record I tried gnokii and gammu and wammu on 
fedora 11. No success. gnokii could not even detect the phone. wammu detects, 
says connected, but cannot retrieve anything say 'your phone does not support 
this'

Hmm, I had similar results with a Nokia 3110c on both those programs so
I didn't even try with the N73. I guess I should note that I haven't
tried using a cable with the N73, only Bluetooth.

Ask them to try kmobiletools. I have used it in 2007 with my old 6021 and is
works(contact backup, SMS) without any issues. So it should not be problem
with latest mobiles. It had a nice interface too.

Even last week, it worked properly.
But not now.

But, don't misuse this to start flame wars or to troll
in the mailing list.

4. Do not top-post:

5. Do not over-quote:

Example of an over-quote:

6. Do not post HTML messages

7. Do not recycle messages

8. Do not send attachments

9. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical legal
disclaimers. If your company uses disclaimers, don't
use your company ID for the mailing list.

10. Do not reply to a digest. (If you are in digest
mode and want to reply to a post use ILUGC Gmane blog
interface.

Link:
http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc

11. Search for answers for your questions/problems in
google.com or any other search engine before posting
your query to the mailing list.

If any of the above are not clear to you, Please read
the detailed list guidelines:

Link:
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

12. Do not post messages in all capital letters. Mails
in CAPS is considered rude and is similar to shouting
during a conversation.

13. Following these guidelines could be helpful
http://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/

14. Don't send season's greetings or birthday or social networking site
?invites to the group. Its not mailing list etiquette.

We must use the above guidelines to maintain better
readability, proper archives, efficient bandwidth
usage, etc.

I want to do it using gconftool,
I have Opened the gconf-editor and the corresponding key is *

ideally, the gconftool command for this will be


gconftool-2 --type list --list-type string --set
/desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/kbd/options '[terminate

but when I am applying the command , it is setting up the right
configuration but Ctrl_ALT_Backspace is not working. There must be some
mistake in syntax. can anybody look into it,

no - press reply. Delete all irrelevant stuff, leave the rest and post under 
the relevant stuff, leaving one line space between the quoted matter and your 
reply. That is correct interleaved posting.

No, that won't do because:

1. If a mail has multiple queries, the reader needs to know what part
is the reply to which query. (Interleaved posting works best here.)

2. There might be situations when a subscriber wants to reply to the
mail which does not immediately precede his/her reply in the thread.

3. A subscriber might reply to more than one mail in the thread in a
single mail.

Subject: [Ilugc] iptables SNAT for multiple VPN LAN subnets through one
	egress point
Message-ID: <i2s1f6793291004011252qd63f9042he98e2f0c596e5440@mail.gmail.com>

Suggestion on how to setup SNAT for multiple VPN LAN subnets through
one egress point.

At the head office, the ISP facing router has two physical NICs (eth0 and eth1).

eth0 is connected to the head office  "local"  LAN  192.168.0.0/24.

eth1 has *two* VLAN interfaces 105 and 689 (vlan105 and vlan689 in
Debian speak) connecting to the Service Provider's (SP)  Network
Termination Unit (NTU)

vlan105 carries VPN traffic coming in from remote locations e.g two
LANs subnets over MPLS VPN (a) 192.168.1.0/24 and (b) 172.16.0.0/16

vlan689 carries company <> INTERNET traffice

Internet access for "remote" locations, all Internet traffic comes to
above router over vlan105 sub interface and have it SNAT'd/Masquerade
to the Internet over vlan689 interface.

All the examples, that I have come across address the typical scenario
of one WAN facing NIC and one LAN facing NIC.  In my scenario two LAN
ifaces (eth0 and vlan105) need to be NAT'd through vlan689 (static
public WAN IP).
VPN LAN connectivity between 3 locations is seamless.  Hosts from the
respective LAN sub nets can ping each other.  However,  only the
"local" office LAN (hosts on eth0) can access sites on the Internet
SNAT/MasqueradeNAT.

Relevant code snippet from the iptables FW shell script:

INTIF1="eth0"        # physical interface for local LAN
INTIF2="vlan105"  # VLAN iface for VPN traffic to remote location
EXTIF="vlan689"   # VLAN iface for INTERNET traffic
EXTIP="a.b.c.d"

................

iptables -t nat -F

iptables -A FORWARD -i $EXTIF -o $INTIF1 -m state --state
ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i $INTIF1 -o $EXTIF -j ACCEPT

iptables -A FORWARD -i $EXTIF -o $INTIF2 -m state --state
ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i $INTIF2 -o $EXTIF -j ACCEPT

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $EXTIF -j MASQUERADE

One idea I am mulling is to add the "remote" subnets with the "-s" and
"-d" options in above (respective) lines to make it network/iface
specific.

Would appreciate any comments/suggestions to allow clients from
"remote" locations access to the Internet via the main office router.

TIA,

Did you gave any manual partition settings?

No way to recover windows, after you wiped out with linux.

Even fedora, is not installed in your machine.
Did you intrupted it?
or got any error in installation?

You did mistake in partitioning.
You should not touch the windows partition.
paricularly c: i.e /dev/sda1

if you remove it, all your windows is gone.

> still am in blank bind to loss my windows and not even get linux...?
>

search for dual boot installation with linux and windows.
you will get lot of links.

read more on the partitioning.

> is there any device or tools or software to recover the data from hard disk

No . you cant recover.
Try reinstalling everything.

I saw an article about setting your shell command history to a large

No, you can't just blindly make that assumption. For all you know the only thing 
wrong might be the installation of grub. Please don't ask people to reinstall 
without encouraging to at least learn what might've gone wrong.

To the OP: You post doesn't have too many details. Assuming that you are new to 
linux, even getting the relevant details and recovering your system might be a 
bit painful over this mailing list medium. I'd suggest you take the help of some 
local linux user to figure out and fix your problem. Send out a mail mentioning 
the area and mail id where you may be contacted and hopefully some kind 
enthusiast might be able to sort out your problems.

Note: since this mailing list's posts are archived and the archives are public 
its not a good idea to give precise contact details like address and phone number.

The easiest, but most effective, way to secure our connection to the VNC
server is to connect through an encrypted*SSH tunnel*. This way the whole
session will be encrypted.

The rest assume that you have the SSH server up and running on your remote
machine (server.example.com) and you know what SSH tunnels are.

So, what we are going to do is to create an encrypted tunnel, and connect to
our VNC server through it. We also want this tunnel to be *automatically
closed* as soon as we shut down vncviewer. All this is done with the
following command:

# ssh -f -L 25903:127.0.0.1:5903 leopard@server.example.com sleep 10;
vncviewer 127.0.0.1:25903:3

This is what it does:

   - *-L 25903:127.0.0.1:5903* forwards our local port 25903 to port 5903 on
   the remote machine. In other words, it creates the tunnel.
   - *-f* forks the SSH session to the background, while *sleep* is being
   executed on the remote machine. This ssh option is needed because we want to
   execute the following command (vncviewer) in the same *local* machine?s
   terminal.
   - *vncviewer* connects to the forwarded local port 25903 in order to
   connect to the VNC server through the encrypted tunnel.

The *sleep* command is of major importance in the above line as it keeps the
encrypted tunnel open for 10 seconds. If no application uses it during this
period of time, then it?s closed. Contrariwise, if an application uses it
during the 10 sec period, then the tunnel remains open until this
application is shut down. This way the tunnel is *automatically closed* at
the time we close vncviewer?s window, without leaving any SSH processes
running on our workstation. This is pure convenience! More information can
be found at the Auto-closing SSH
Tunnels<http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/11/24/auto-closing-ssh-tunnels/>
 article.

Using SSH tunnels to conect to your VNC server has two advantages:

   1. The whole session is encrypted.
   2. Keeping port 5903 open on your remote machine *is no longer needed*,
   since all take place through the SSH tunnel. So, noone will know that you
   run a VNC server on the remote machine.

For more detail info, check these links:-

Hi,
 I want to use Eclipse for code browsing. I installed the eclipse C/C++

Hi,
Can you help me to decode(decrypt) the  ISAKMP (IKEv1) packets in wireshark.

In Edit -> Preferences-> protocol preferences -> ISAKMP -> "Log Filename" option is present. Here we have to give the input.
I have googled and not able to find any detailed information , how to give the key etc.

If someone  come across this, please share it.
Wireshark version : 1.2.0

Thanks

By default, based on CPU utilization. But you can change this using
top's interactive commands. Read man top.

Linux use single Hierarchical FS, which starts with /. Windoz follow
multiple hierarchical FS and each one linked with a drive(C,D,..).

Use grep with appropriate pattern and redirect the output to an

for finding default block size, u can see this command with o/p

*tune2fs -l /dev/sda1 | grep Block*
Block count:              4980736
Block size:               4096

On different machines? Why do you want to do it? Not a good idea.

In case you want to do it, setup automatic keying by

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
(give no password)
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh remote "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

And start ssh-agent -s like this in case you use bash. `ssh-agent -s`

This is the hard part. You should see

$ ssh-add -l

should list your key fingerprint.

Then your automated login is working. Then write a simple script like this.

for i in `cat machines`
do
    ssh $i "apachectl restart"

done

That is it.

Apache log contains everything. access.log. There are several
visualizers and log
analyzers out there. A simple grep can also take you there.

mysql I dunno. A lot of LUGGies use it. Ask them.

top does not assign priorities. OS assigns. Read up the nice command.

Lower the number, higher the priority.

I dunno how to answer this one. I have not gone deep into either.

A file system should be judged by its ability to perform well with many small
files or few large files and not tire the hard disk.

It should also recover from crashes well. Linux file system was
immature but with
time it is improving I think.

As to Windoze, of course it is worse than linux. When I say Linux file
systems are
 not up to the mark I mean in relation to absolute terms or with other superior
file systems.

Well I am too ignorant to comment any further.

Used to 512 bytes. Not sure about now. You can easily find it out.

Just look at the LEDs. If you see a green and an amber light glowing on one,
you know it is up.

Go for IPsec VPN. You get free downloads for Windows I think.

On CentOS install a VPN package. The kernel has its own IPSec as well I think.

It is very difficult to get it working. Best is ssh forwarding.

Or OpenVPN which is easier to get working but not nework efficient.

Of course you have ssh on Windows using putty. Or else use Cygwin and
you can even have sshd server running.

I had it working and works well.

Do you understand your question well?

I do not mean to offend you but how can you decode ISAKMP without
having the keys?

The public and the private keys?

Or you mean to know what commands are sent in the clear?

I can easily see that with tcpdump.

What is your question? Come again please.

You might want to look at FUNC. but this would need initial setup.

https://fedorahosted.org/func/

alternatively u can go the SSH path. setup key based logins & any simple
script should do.

netstat might be a simple way. I am not sure if MYSQL let's u query that.

CPU, but you can change the sorting order.. check manpage

One way is you can setup your syslog to log the messages to a different
file. the default Syslog/rsyslog, doesn't offer you much room, you can look
at syslog-ng. It is pretty good & might just meet you requirement.

Yes. i have the keys. This is test network. both VPN endpoints are in my control. i can get the keys.
Please note i can able to decrypt the IKEv2 packets.
refer: http://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChIKEv2DecryptionSection.html
But IKEv1 or ISAKMP packets not able to decrypt. Wireshark manual says, pass the pluto log file under Protocol ref->ISAKMP.
I am not sure  what is that mean..

I'm not sure if this is the "right way" to write to do this.  Blocking
on FORWARD chain can cause some tricky problems.  Best
thing is to block all incoming on EXTIF and permit selected/all
on INTIF.  Pass all on outgoing and forward chains.

Additionally, you may want to selectively permit only management
IPs to access the firewall itself on INTIF.

Don't think that will make any difference.

Before you start troubleshooting NAT it's best to check if routing
is working correctly.  Best way to test is to ping EXTIP from remote
VPN clients.

Also, traceroute and see if remote VPN clients can reach your
Debian firewall over the VPN interface, and can touch the EXTIF
EXTIP.

If this does not work, then set your gateways accordingly!



Depending on who you speak to, it may be considered bad practice
to back haul internet traffic to HQ as it doubles WAN traffic, and also
increases latency for internet traffic.  Direct-to-net is a preferred approach.
That is unless you want enforce compliance/security/audit policies
from a central location.

please do not ask vague questions - maintain an apache server and then come 
forward with specific issues. Unless you have to write a project report on this 
- in which case you should do your own homework.

What it mean, either u don't have system or u don't have OS.
I think u r new to Linux platform....First u implement an Apache server, try
to display webpage...By default apache will look into /var/www/html...This
is the default path of apache server....
check this link..
http://httpd.apache.org/   Try to learn from this link, it contains lot of
information....The main problems what I find in Apache is the selinux
issue...Specially when u want local user to display their web page from
there home dir and lot other more issue...
Also learn what is name-based virtual hosting and ip based virtual
hosting...
There is a lot in Apache...not possible to tell everything in single mail...



> >>so i use this mailing list to ask my question...would u pls any one
> >>clarify my que....
>
First u put ur effort to implement it....if u r getting any error, first try
to solve by ur own....if u not able to do, then google it...If then also u r
not able to solve it then ask in mailing list...
Also mention ur doubt in details with error output and explain what research
u have done to solve that issue....

OTOH, I have used this plugin and i think using using Eclipse for c/c++ dev
is an overkill. I would suggest it only if you have some *small *project to
develop or you are a newbie(in which case you shouldnt be using ide at all)
and want to get onspeed with c/c++ syntaxes etc and the help from IDE w.r.t
the hints - otherwise get back to the vim/emacs mode.

To answer your Q : i am not sure what the problem is. Did you click on the
project and search? or chose the project name/workspace while doing the
search?

if you have access to the server end and client end, why waste time with 
VNC when you could just use NX instead ? it works over ssh by default, 
and will give you a near local desktop experience even over slow links ( 
eg. sustaining 19.2kbps is all that most people need for a 1024x768 
desktop area )

Google can help you better...!
Refer http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat
You can add a freenode IRC account in Pidgin http://bit.ly/9TAtRj or you can
use http://webchat.freenode.net/
In http://freenode.net/faq.shtml you can find the details of creating a
nickname, registering it, etc..
Hope this helps...

First you must understand what is cloud,without knowing about basic terms on
cloud you cant able to get into it...for my better advice that refer
http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-28.pdf
and then you can get a clear thing.

Hi,

I want to pull only code from a specific git branch. I am not
planning to resync or commit back to it and index files are too big.
So is it possible to quickly pull the code alone, with-out the
tracking details.

Bye :)

No, you will need to clone the whole remote git-repo.

FF3 needs this specific shared lib and you have to upgrade your
pango lib. Or You can try to create a link with this name, to the
old lib, which is normally available in /usr/lib/.

How?

@Bharathi:

If you already have a clone of the repo, then you can pull a specific
branch, but, you have to clone the full repo first, if you don't have
a local copy.

I have found the solution to this problem after a long time. I
installed the tool called xdebconfigurator. After installing it, i ran
the command 'xdebconfigurator' which show the configurations supported
by my display adapter which included higher resolutions than what was
being automagically used by X. Then I generated Xorg.conf file using
the 'dexconf' command and restarted gdm and everything worked fine. I
was able to select all the higher resolutions and frequency my display
adapter supported. :). Hope this is helpful to those with the same
problem.


Thank you.

Guruprasad.

> Talk 2: etcKeeper (Lighting Talk)
Speaker : Raman P
Duration: 15mins

Abstract:
etckeeper is a collection of tools to let /etc be stored in a
version control repository. It's quite modular and configurable,
while also being simple to use, if you understand the basics of
working with revision control.

> Talk 3: Alternative and Augmentative Communication
Speaker : Prof Anil Prabhakar, EE, IIT-M
Duration: 45mins

Abstract:
Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) aims to provide a
medium and a mode of communication to non-verbal users. While the
hearing impaired have successfully adapted to the use of SMS, and can
also rely on sign language, those with multiple disabilities still
cannot independently communicate their thoughts and wishes.  The 1st
AAC conference was held at IIT-M in Dec 2005, and it led to the
creation of Hope (software), Kavi and Vaani (hardware). We now need
customized applications, especially in local languages.

I don't have any cloud deployment experience.  In my company, We have large
data set ,  takes too much time to process the data and we facing some other
problem also.  The New Technology "Hadoop" will solves all our problem.  So
I am  evaluating HDFS/MapReduce/HBase/Hive/Pig to use  our company. For that
I have setup  4 node Hadoop cluster and doing the initial research on that.

newspapers, magazines, newsletters and posters to technical
documentation. It has sophisticated page layout features like
precision placing and rotating of text and/or images on a page, manual
kerning of type, bezier curves polygons, precision placement of
objects, layering with RGB and CMYK custom colors. The Scribus
document file format is XML-based. Unlike proprietary binary file
formats, even damaged documents, can be recovered with a simple text
editor.

Dear ankitcs,

We're thrilled to announce that registration for Google Code Jam 2010
has opened! And even better, the onsite finals will be held in
Google's Dublin office.

Visit http://code.google.com/codejam to register, get up to speed on
the rules, and practice on problems from previous contests. It is a
good idea to check out the competition arena and get comfortable with
the interface, competition format, and types of problems that you will
encounter in the contest
(http://code.google.com/codejam/archive.html).

The qualification round starts on May 7th, 2010 (find your local time
at http://code.google.com/codejam/schedule.html), and after four
rounds of online competition, the top 25 competitors will be flown to
Google's Dublin office to match wits for the $5,000 first prize -- and
the title of Code Jam Champion!

- The Code Jam Team

Scribus is an amazing app. We use it in our college to bring out the
newsletter of the electrical engg. department.
Automatic hyphenation is the best feature according to me.

Message-ID: <t2t328077851004080209v8da50176yeea7601aa4f4a90b@mail.gmail.com>

dear friends :

as you might be aware, NRCFOSS worked with Anna Univ to get two FOSS
electives in the curriculum since 2006. So far, about 3000 students have
taken the courses successfully in B.E. (Comp Science), B.Tech (Information
Technology) and MCA. Anna Univ Coimbatore will be having FOSS as core
paper in 3rd in B.E.,

an offshoot of this exercise was to get institutions like Jaya Engg College
which -- thanks to the sustained support from LUG & other FOSS enthusiasts
-- have made greater impact on the growth of FOSS.

FOSS electives have been approved in Shivaji University, Kolhapur Rajasthan
Tech Univ. Final year B.E. CSE Networking labs in UP Tech Univ are tuned to
run on FOSS platform. Punjab Tech Univ & a host of others are in the process
of introducing FOSS.

FOSS subjects -- especially Linux, Python -- have also found their way into
the non-engg currirula, especially Biotechnology. Of course, many
colleges/univ have got linux as one of the papers (some time a regular one,
often for a term or so depending on the efforts & enthusiasm of the
concerned staff member).

I would appreciate if you could send me the copies of / links to FOSS
subject offered in the curricula. I also welcome related suggestion /
queries. As part of my official duty at NRCFOSS, the syllabus info will be
updated in the NRCFOSS portal HRD page ; we have also been involvin local
FOSS community as and when efforts are made to interact with the various
academic entities.

the info can be sent to* : srinivasans@cdac.in    and/or    srini.it@
gmail.com

thanks and best wishes
Srinivasan

* CDAC Chennai is moving into new premises inside Tidel Park. Hence the
NRCFOSS / BOSS portals are down. Once they are activated, I will update the
available info in the HRD page, and send the link thru the LUG group mail.

Message-ID: <20100408100316.786BE1DB257@www.ae.iitm.ac.in>

Dear all,

On behalf of ILUGC, myself have conducted a two days GNU/Linux workshop @ Sethu Institute of Technology for 
Technical Staffs of all departments and also for Office staffs.

The Sethu Institute of Technology, Near Kariapatti, Virudhunagar District wants most of its existing windows  PCs to be converted to 
GNU/Linux, Open Source Softwares (including ECE, EEE, Mech. Departments).  So, the training was planned for all sys. admins / lab technicians in the college.

The training focussed on

1. Fedora-12 Linux Installation (Local / Remote using kickstart)
2. Local Repository Setup for Package management
3. Samba for File Sharing Services
4. NFS / DHCP Setup
5. LTSP (for setting up Terminal Services in existing Labs)
6. Introduction to several application development tools (codeblocks, netbeans, eclipse, openoffice, mysql, umbrello etc)

I also had an interaction with all department staffs, regarding their doubts about the  existing proprietary software and their equivalent applications in Linux / Open source software and how far other colleges have been using FOSS in other departments.

They are planning to have a separate Linux lab for the first year students from the next academic year.  They also have
planned for a one week training program for Teaching staff's by first week of May (Interested persons, may contact
me offlist).

I would like to thank Dr. Senthil Kumar (Principal), Mrs. M. Sheerin Banu (Dean, Profesor & Head-CSE) and Mr. Nageswaran (System Admin) for the support.

Message-ID: <j2q47d9fe5c1004080749q79cd94c2l29f9c940415e760@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

I started downloading the release directory from a cygwin mirror
today. I was curious to find the size of the directory, and used ftp
and df -sh to find the size. But the operation took very long and I

What keywords do you exactly mean? Those in the browser, elsewhere in
the desktop environment or the terminal?

Sorry, I noticed the schedule clash after announcing 
the bootcamp.
 
> Why do you not speak at the LUG meet 
Well, mostly due to my hectic weekend schedule for a 
long time. I will plan my schedule in the coming 
months to speak at LUG meets :-)
 
I believe LUG meets are for talks, discussions and
peer-to-peer knowledge gathering - NOT for intensive
training/workshops/bootcamps. Any session that demands
attention-span of more than 2 hours should be off the
LUG meet agenda in my opinion.  

>- 8 hours is anyway way too much to introduce python.
A good programmer needs to introduction to Python. 
A newbie programmer would need not more than 1 hour
of Python induction (and he can self learn and explore on
himself).
But for someone from a non-programming background, 
my experience states that even 8 hour session could be
too less and unjustified in getting them to become fully
productive and competent with Python.
(FYI, I have conducted 80 hour sessions in Python to a 
couple of companies - but thats a different thing 
altogether).

Chandrashekar

Dear Friends,

On Kenneth sir's directions, I'am posting this mail to our group.

Our college is having a Centre for TIFAC Core in Machine Vision. Dr.
Sheila Anand, Dean(R&D) requested me to explore FOSS Tools for live
image processing, so that training could be provided for
staff/students this summer. We have chosen OpenCV tool and we are
searching?for resource persons who could contribute in a Two or a
Three days workshop on OpenCV.


I have heard?OpenCV could also be used with Python apart from C++.

Kindly mail me if you know any Resource persons who could help us.

Thanks and Regards,

Benedict Jayaprakash Nicholas,

To configure Redhat repositories, you would need a RHN subscription.
rhn_register would guide you thought the registration process and also
setup the repositories for you.

Do you ping a external site or ping internal machines?

If you ping external site, activate only one net connection and check.
then, check with another connection.

so that you can find if the issue with the ISP.

If you ping the internal machines,
check your physical connections and check for any IP conflicts.

Update us with your results.

I have done some work with OpenCV as part of my work . I have released it
Open Source in sourceforge at :http://sourceforge.net/projects/autocrop/ .
But currently I am not working with OpenCV. I am preparing to start my Phd
in CFD simulation, so spending time with other task will be difficult for
me. I have already motivated few student from ILUGC. But still they need
some help from me because of time constrain I am not able to help them. If
you really still need to explore OpenCV, there is no any other resource
person to help you. please feel free to ping me, As a ILUGC member I am very
happy to help you. Again I will spend some time with OpenCV to help you.

Hi,

It is all about what you require and what you like.

Each language has its own special features.

No one can say which is best.

you only have to decide on which you are comfortable with.

Learn as much you possible and then conclude yourself.

Wishes.

Hello,
Just asking out of curiosity.
Cant we have some deamon running in the background which constantly monitors
all the keystrokes pressed. Like a keylogger in windows and pop up a dialog
box or something when a banned word is pressed?

Yeah, you can do that with Xlib. Of course, if you find yourself doing
that, it is time to seriously evaluate your computer access policies,
and possibly your life. I can't think of a good reason why anyone would
want to do this.

IIRC a fundamental philosophy during Unix design was to keep 'policy' and
'mechanism' separate (according to Kernighan, I think). The OP's question
was about the mechanism.

In many cases the person implementing the mechanism might not have a say on
the policy! Mixing the politics of policy with mechanism is not a good idea.

+1, some way to recognize series of key strokes not key combinations.

with xmodmap / similar tool, we can map key combination (eg. ctrl+alt+r) and
not series of key strokes that matches the keywords (eg. typing "word") to
be banned.

Any better ideas?

Linux is not only X.
Think on a shell.

How can you achieve this in a shell?

Very Well known fact. May be you did not get my question right.

> Think on a shell.
> How can you achieve this in a shell?

Infact we can, Simple, both in X/shell they are keystrokes directed through
STDIN, that can be monitored and correspondingly a daemon can trigger
something like N backspace key presses where N is the length of the keyword
to be banned.

Okey.

Think of it.

All the best.

But, what is the use of a computer with linux,
if you dont have freedom to even type some words?

Hi,

>>AFAIK, There is no such option available in any parental control software.
so planning to work on it.

I do not have a straight solution for this, however i would like to add my 2
cents here,
There is a software for faking the keyboard and mouse system, take a look
at  http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/swinput .
This is one which will fake the keyboard and mouse event and in the project
web page it is said that it is used  for testing purpose of software.
Probably digging this software and manipulating the input system, you may
achieve to block the key words.

Regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Good.

This may happen, when you deny the user from typing a word ban.

                  so, you will eat "ana" , use "ner" for publicity,
will go to "k" for money,

prefix 'ban' in the previously quoted letters.

Take a look at systemtap - its trivial to create a hook that would 
'watch' keyboard input and take actions based on that. In fact one of 
the demo scripts does just this.

Probably modifying keyboard driver should help.

But how to prevent copy+paste is a different problem.

Hello,
> Probably modifying keyboard driver should help.
Before stdin gets mounted to proc, if we can run our keyboard daemon which
will act as stdin, and act as a filter before passing it on to the actual
driver, as suggested I think we can do this.

As for the ana ana problem, one solution is to look for complete words
instead of patterns. But still if I want to ban the word "bank" I can type
it as bankbank and it works. So an intelligent list of banned words need to
be prepared.

Try nautilus-actions. It is used to add commands to the right click menu.

There is nothing which is best or worst. Its on how much expertise
that you have yourself on which language. each have it's own
advantages and disadvantages. If you ask me, I would vote for Java. KG
would vote for python, others might vote for RoR.


But I found the following (my own observations)

PHP does not enforce good programming techniques. Hence a lot of
programmers tend to write ugly code that is hard to maintain.

Python forces you to write neater code, but if you are bad, it can't help

It depends on where you want to run your server and for what purpose.
Java might require higher resources to start with, but can scale to a
huge data center. PHP needs lesser resources to start with and faster
to initially develop. I am sure Python will also have something
similar.

Recently Twitter moved away from RoR , because it wasn't scalable
enough. Facebook wrote their own PHP pre-compiler to make their pages
faster (scale up).

Finally, I would prefer anything that separates logic from
presentation (MVC / MVC2).

Choose something that you are already comfortable with. Stick to
standards and make sure that there is a community to support you.
Learn programming basics first and be very clear about it. This is the
most important part. Programming basics is language independent.

+1.

and +1 for Srinivasan's note on banning the word "ban".


There was a huge problem reported in a bank and that caused flutter
all around. The SPAM filter in their email was blocking anything with
a $ symbol in the subject line. End result was that a bank staff sent
a message, a very very important and urgent message to some one else
inside the bank and they never received it.

So, pls re-consider what you are exactly trying to achieve. Try to
solve the problem and not a solution. Ask "why" and consider "is there
any other way" and most importantly, "will this affect me adversely?"

Natarajan.

That is the way the SP has sold the solution to my client.  I was not
involved in the pre-sales or even circuit provisioning stage.  I came
in to install routers and that is when I realized that my client and I
were dealing with an organization that can be best described as
"Pandora's Box"

I had tested my router's routing tables in my WAN simulator using the
IP number schemes the SP had given my client (I do realize that my WAN
simulator would not be a 100% mimic of SP's setup)
Everything worked fine in my test bed.

However, the deployment was an entirely different beast because the SP
had given us incorrect information (a) incorrect IP numbers, (b)
incorrect VLAN IDs, and finally (c) configuration being ready at it's
end.   "your circuits at our end has been *ready* for the past 2.5
months!, the problem is in your routers!"

(c) was also incorrect because the SP did have to have  knowledge
about my client's sub net at each location.   I had asked the SP's
senior sales engineer repeatedly and he said they did not care what
our LAN IPs were - the NOC guy (rubber meets the road guy) had an
entirely different opinion.

After much haranguing tech support calls to the SP's NOC, changes
w.r.t to our LAN subnets were made at the SP end.

LAN 2 LAN is working
LAN 2 Internet is working

I had to tweak the iptables rules @ HO to allow ingress/egress between
the VPN LAN interfaces.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <164677.11043.qm@web33105.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

This is going to be so much fun !!! 

1. The comparison itself is not really fair. php and Java are languages while RoR is a language+framework combo. The correct comparison will be php vs. Java vs. Ruby. My order of preference here is 1st Ruby, then Java and then php.

2. php and Java have MVC frameworks too which compete with Rails. php has 'Symfony' and Java has 'Struts'. Hence you can have Rails vs. symfony vs. struts.

3. The nitty-gritty 

3.a. php + symfony - good to excellent for small projects. php started as a procedural language and is not fully OO. Hence, code gets increasingly difficult to maintain as proj size grows. But php is easier to learn, very mature libraries, lots of php developers and in general easier, cheaper both for development and maintenance. 
Yahoo front end is pretty much entirely php. I think the total amount of PHP code available on the net is 2nd only to 'C'.
I personally detest php due to the inline html part. Also the language/syntax is not 'elegant'. php is also aged - parallel will be that php took up a lot of space where initially PERL was used. Similarly, ROR is eating into php territory.

3.b. RoR - my personal favourite. excellent for upto medium-large sized projs. Absolutely a programmers delight. Ruby is fully OO. Rails is excellent MVC and the ORM is great.
By 2009, even the libraries and plugins sorta caught up with php - rubyforge.com
High productivity - much higher than php due to the native methods of Ruby. i.e. You do not have to write code for sorting, searching, ordering etc in ruby - just use the inbuilt stuff unless you are Knuth's Ekalavya and know a 'better' optimisation.
Same for Rails. The framework does so much that you just concentrate on the business logic rather than algorithms and n vs. n^2 vs. log(n).
jquery is the only major library not fully integrated with ROR but that should be integrated in 1-2 months with the release with Rails 3.0
RoR is perfect for almost 90%-95% of web apps where CRUD is the main concern. 
For the remaining projects that don't require MVC, do NOT go for RoR. 
The number of RoR programmers are lesser and hence more expensive. Shared hosting of RoR is not as popular as php. 

3.c. Java/Struts - This is for 'industrial strength' projects. Java has a lot of good stuff going for it but I really don't think you can compare Java/Struts with RoR/symfony - they are aimed at different categories of applications altogether. Java is more resource hungry. Java is a bit of a pain to develop and test due to the building+deploying latency and unless you need Application Server features, you really don't need Java/Struts. Java also requires more effort to deploy and maintain.

Have a good look at what your planning to do and then take a decision based on your comfort zone.

+1 each to Raman.P for pointing out, with little AI work as mentioned by
swamynathan, things should work as desired.

Thanks KB, gonna try systemtap, seems interesting.

This may not for every end user, but a module/standalone parental control
app.

What is the purpose of two service providers?  How is your gateway

(a) load balancing ? or

I tried this but it is only for the right click menu which opens when a file
or folder or both is selected. But my purpose is to have this command at all
places when right click is done. I have found a solution though.

Put the script in the following folder

~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/

Now where ever a right click is made a new option called Nautilus scripts
appears in the context menu whose sub-menu lists all the scripts in the
above mentioned folder. When I have added my script to the folder, it
appears here and when clicked, the wallpaper changes.

Problem Solved.

 Hmm.... I haven't seen RoR. But Yes Java app servers have a lot of
security features built into them, along with caching frameworks,
schedulers, business components, webservices, and the list doesn't
end. I agree; the turn around time might be slower. But you need to go
to java only when you want the App Server features....

MVC is not a RAILS buzz word. it has been around even before RAILS.
MVC, MVC2 are the basics of separating presentation layer from
business layer. Infact, if you have this feature, you already have
some kind of MVC with you. You should seriously look at MVC/MVC2. For
all you know, you might already be using MVC/MVC2 ;-). Most *plain*
PHP programmers will never know it.

As I said... everyone have their choice. If you don't know to code,
anyone can write a bad code in any language. infact most people write
bad code for the first 3 - 5 years of their work exp. :(

back to facebook - at one stage they were deploying 200 servers with 16 gb RAM 
each and using memcached to put their whole database in 3.2 tb of memory 
(nginx, tornado and memcached). I do not think that memcached is written in 
java.

I am quite sure that I am not using MVC - django describes itself as a MVT

most people never stop writing bad code ... my point is that to write good 
secure code in php one needs to be a brilliant programmer - most of us are 
not, which is why we are well advised to stick with python.

Subject: [Ilugc] Scrpit for automatic CPU frequency scaling
Message-ID: <m2ze6b5008a1004110156n161b0ba4se1f0e2a71da5b037@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was lazing around this morning when I thought I could do something fun.
The result is the bash script below. I'm a beginner to bash scripting. The
script uses temperature and AC adapter information from /proc/acpi to scale
frequency using cpufrequtils. This is, assuming that cpufrequtils has
already been configured with three governors - performance, ondemand and
powersave.
I did a chown root <script-name>.sh to give it root permissions.

Please let me know if I can do more with this. I want to try and improve it
(just for fun though).

---------

#! /bin/bash

ACPI=/proc/acpi
interval=5
ond='sudo cpufreq-set -r -g ondemand'
psv='sudo cpufreq-set -r -g powersave'
per='sudo cpufreq-set -r -g performance'

        thermometer()
        { # output list of temperatures
        read X Y < $ACPI/thermal_zone/TZ01/temperature
        echo ${Y:0:2};
        }

        acad() { # output the AC Adapter state
        read X Y < $ACPI/ac_adapter/ACAD/state
        echo $Y;
        }

        while true; do
        temp=`thermometer`
        adapter=`acad`
        if [[ $adapter = 'on-line' ]]; then
               if [[ $temp -ge 60 ]]; then
               $ond &
               else
               $per &
               fi
        fi
        if [[ $adapter = 'off-line' ]]; then
        $psv &
        fi
        sleep $interval
        done

Dear luggies
I am sorry for those who didn't attend this month meet(Oh .. no I am not talking about my presentation anyway). There was a fantastic presentation by Prof.Anil Prabhakar of EE, IITM.

His presentation was about creating a device to help verbally challenged - those who cannot use normal communication like voice, writing etc.

He along with his team has created a device which consists of
A small box with begule board, linux on a SD card.
A small display - I thing 7inches.
Audio output
An input device which is a sensor.

Commonly these people can use only one form of input - ie. just a click or a touch or a nod. The challange is to form sentence using this single input.
What has been done is a program which displays a keypad - similar to cell phone. There are buttons to select a select, select a word, erase and accept. The cursor keeps on moving from one object to next. When the cursor is on the right object a click is pressed/touched/nodded etc. The program processes this selection and depending on the object proceeds further - may be selecting a word, sentence or letter etc.
If the selection is over the corresponding text is translated into speech and played on the audio output.
The above is brief description - by no means complete. The challenges in this project are
Cost - Should be low something like Rs.7500/-
Two audio output - one for the person and another for the teacher/listener with independent volume control.
Good prediction of words and sentence to reduce time and effort
Optimisation of OS and application for small memory

At present they have ported Ubuntu/Linux and main program is written in WxPython. They face lot of challenges in porting Linux and writing application. They welcome any help.

In my opinion there is a lot of scope for developement in this project especially to students. And I am sure even a tiny one-line contribution should give great satisfaction considering the target persons.

I urge students to have a look at the device.

Note:I have given just a description of a thing which cannot be described easily - something which should be seen to be understood.

More information needed on what exactly you want to achieve. If you are
looking at hosting cheaply and you are writing yet-another-blog-component,
you are better off doing this in PHP.

If you are writing an app to be deployed in a windows environment and has
to integrate with other windows apps, then your choice could very well be
.NET.

If you are writing an app to be massively scalable, then the choice of
language is actually a minor decision - what you should be considering is
all the other aspects of the solution such as the caching architecture,
clustering etc.

If you are looking at millisecond response times, you may be looking at
writing the entire web app in C/C++ like the solution LSE is currently
using.

My advice is to select a suitable framework first - and then use the
language that works best with that framework.

Of course some frameworks allow you to program using multiple languages -
example: you could use the python syntax (groovy) or the ruby syntax
(jruby) and still deploy on the jvm.

Regards,
Prem

Once you confirm that the ping packets are indeed going to the
respective ISP, then In my opinion you should contact the ISP tech
support and lodge a trouble ticket regarding packet loss.

Subhojit,

            I have an experience in working with Linksys products. Can you
please try adjusting MTU value in Linksys router. I assume you would know to
login to the linksys router via browser.

I have already done that, the ISP tech person also not able to resolve the
issue...I have doubt that there may be something wrong in my router
configuration, since both the modems are getting same issue...The airtel
modem has more issue...I will check it and will update you.

Hi,

log

Add the following line:
   log=queries.log
in the [mysqld] section of my.cnf file and restart mysqld. the logs should
be
stored under the mysql data directory by default.
For more information, lookup the following URL:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/query-log.html

Cheers,

Subhojit,

           The forum link you pointed has correct MTU. We always start with
1500. Then, if I still see the packets dropping, I will reduce it to set it
correctly.

            In your case, I suggest you start with 1500 and reduce it,if you
still see packets dropping. For every change, router restart is mandatory.


Regards,
Karthik

Just curious, why are you trying to install xine from sources rather than doing 
a 'yum install' ?

Are you aware of the EPEL repositories for CentOS ? A quick lookup tells me that 
the non-free (aka -- patent encumbered and other random 'bad' media related 
packages) are also available for CentOS in the rpmfusion repos:

http://rpmfusion.org/Configuration/
(note: read the bottom of the page for enabling EPEL)

Hi Guys,
   I am using BSNL Huawei EC325 modem( Provided with NIC connection,White
color dongle ).It has a slot to insert a sim card.But currently i am using
no sim card to connect to internet.I referred that it is capable of 3G 
network.Can i use a 3G sim in this modem to get high-speed internet
connection.Do i need to unlock the modem ? I dont know what to do and a 
google search is also not fruitful.The modem features a Serial No and
a ESN no on its back.Thank you guys.Eagerly waiting for your valuable

Hi.
About clustering I have little knowledge, one month before I attended a
seminar on clustering in GNUnify in pune.
The pdf is available here..
http://brainfunked.org/files/gnunify2010/gnunify2010-darwinsing-networks.pdf
I will suggest u to go with RedHat cluster suite.
Also u can use pacemaker. http://clusterlabs.org/

In Debian side RedHat cluster is not proper...

some good links :-

You can possibly use a CDMA SIM in the slot to access the internet
using other providers.

I don't think this modem supports UMTS (or 3G in plain English). The
product page at [1] caps the data rate at 153.6 kbps.

I want a Linux software that multiples desktop.

A software that can make 5 monitors connect to one system unit with each
monitor behaving like an independently

Each behaving as a computer set with each monitor having it own keyboard and
mouse.

Is there anything in linux? It will be great if it is for fedora or ubuntu

Sorry for the top post.

You can't do this with a KVM device.

KVM is a multiplexer - ie, you connect 1 monitor, kdb, mouse to
multiple computers.  What you want is the exact opposite.


Search the web for "Multi Seat X Server" and you'll find what you are
seeking.  This setup is very sensitive to make/model of your graphics
card, X Server config, etc.

Raman had presented this during a lug meet a few months ago.

There's a European group which has crammed 13 Nvidia GPUs into a
single workstation.  They use all the GPUs for running medical
research code using CUDA.  The workstation runs a modified BIOS and
patched Linux kernel.  Their videos are on Youtube.


The latest AMD/ATI graphics cards supporting Eyefinity technology can
power 6 displays from a single GPU. It should be appearing in laptops
anytime now. Why in laptops - because a high end laptop has an
internal display, and combinations of VGA, mini DVI, display port,
SPDIF or HDMI external displays.

Apache modules can help you impose a bandwidth cap per IP, session,
request, etc.  See mod_throttle, mod_bandwidth and the newer
mod_cband, mod_bw.  Some of these modules are not a standard part of
apache, so you'll have to compile them from source.


Other webservers like lighttpd support bandwidth limiting natively and
don't require any addons.  If you have any ddifficulty with compiling
or installing apache modules, switching to lighttpd for this testing
may be easier.

The concept is called multi-seat linux 

What is multi-seat?
Here on a single cpu box, we have pci vga card, extra
keyboard,monitor,mouse. Allow two persons to simultaneously
use system.
What is required
a.Regular system with preferebly 1gb ram
b.Install debian lenny
c.Add PCI VGA/agp card like nvdia. Or if existing card has two monitor
support the same can be used.
d.Add extra monitor to this card.
e.Add usb keyboard and mouse
f.Now  install mdm.

LInks

I would suggest rpmforge. add that repo and simply do a 'yum install vlc'

I know, I know you q was about xineplayer, but this would pull in all
the dependencies.

Subject: [Ilugc] Fedora Graphics Test Week :  This Week
Message-ID: <4BC42063.1040500@gmail.com>

The Fedora project announces that this week is Graphics Test Week.

This is the highlight of the Fedora 13 Test Day cycle, with Test Days
for NVIDIA, ATI/AMD and Intel graphics all falling this week. Tuesday
April
13th is NVIDIA Test Day [1], Wednesday April 14th is ATI/AMD Test Day
[2], and Thursday April 15th is Intel graphics Test Day [3].

Although these are Fedora events, the results will ultimately benefit
almost all distributions: Fedora tends to use the latest versions of
graphics-related components and sends all its changes upstream, so the
fixes that result from these events will end up in all major
distributions. Even if you're not a Fedora user, you can help Linux as
a whole by contributing your test results.

The testing can be done using a live image, so there's no need to
install Fedora onto your system to contribute to the testing: just
download a live image, write it to a CD or USB stick, boot it, and run
through the tests. Comprehensive test instructions are available on
the Wiki pages, and you
enter your results into a table on the Wiki page; there's no need to
have a Fedora wiki account to do this.

QA team members and developers will be available on the IRC channels
throughout each event to help with testing and triage, and to work on
some of the problems immediately. The more results we get and the more
bugs we expose, the better it is for everyone, so if you have time,
please check out the Wiki pages and join the IRC channel -
#fedora-test-day on the Freenode network - to help out!
You can use WebIRC [4] if you're not a regular IRC user - just click
that link and you're in the chat.

Message-ID: <4BC43092.6070602@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am going to running a workshop via #fedora-india IRC channel in
freenode coming Friday.   You should have a recent Fedora system running
and make sure to install fedora-packager before coming up.

# yum install fedora-packager

Reading material at

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/A_Short_RPM_Tutorial

I will be covering the basics of RPM Packaging in Fedora and you can
follow along and build a "hello" package.  I can continue the session
for a couple of hours or until everyone gets their package built and
verified, whichever comes first.  My nick is mether and I am usually
available in #fedora-india if you have any questions about getting
started.

Subject modified, sorry for that. To give you some more information on the nature of the application: It's like a distributed cache, getting messages (like streaming data) and keep them for a while in memory and pass it to the respective clients/users.

thx, well - I've tried couple of things from ltp tools base. What I see here is not the data loss or something like, all I need to understand the reasons behind the delays in streaming of data. Also I'm not sure how to check the app performance running on two different operating systems parallely.

Subject: [Ilugc] Announcing the release of Fedora 13 Beta!!
Message-ID: <4BC480BC.1090106@gmail.com>

The countdown is on: Fedora 13, "Goddard," is set to launch in mid-May.
Fedora is the leading edge, free and open source operating system that
continues to deliver innovative features to users worldwide, with a new
release every six months.

But wait! What's that? You can't wait a whole month to try out the
latest and greatest in Fedora's leading-edge technologies? You want to
be the first to see what's new? Well, you're in luck. The Fedora 13 Beta
release is available NOW. Hop on board and take a tour of the rocking
new features.

http://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease?anF13b

What is the Beta Release? The beta release is the last important
milestone of Fedora 13. Only critical bug fixes will be pushed as
updates leading up to the general release of Fedora 13, scheduled to be
released in the middle of May. We invite you to join us and participate
in making Fedora 13 a solid release by downloading, testing, and
providing your valuable feedback.

Of course, this is a beta release, some problems may still be lurking. A
list of the problems we already know about is found at the Common F13
bugs page:

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Common_F13_bugs

If you find a bug that's not found on that page, be sure it gets fixed
before release by reporting your discovery at
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/. Thank you!

A universe of new features for end users:

      * Automatic print driver installation. We're using RPM and
        PackageKit for automatic installation of printer drivers, so
        when you plug in a printer, Fedora will automatically offer to
        install drivers for it if needed.

      * Desktop enhancements. The Shotwell photo manager, Deja-dup
        backup software, Pino Identi.ca/Twitter client, and Simple Scan
        scanning utility are all delivered by default to provide a
        enhanced desktop experience out of the box.

      * NetworkManager improvements include better Mobile Broadband,
        Bluetooth, and new CLI abilities. NetworkManager is now a
        one-stop-shop for all of your networking needs in Fedora, be it
        dial-up, broadband, wifi, or even Bluetooth. Mobile broadband
        enhancements now show signal strength. Old-style dial-up
        networking (DUN) over Bluetooth has also been added. And now,
        you can even use NetworkManager from the command line in
        addition to the improved graphical user interface. Getting a
        connection when you need it has never been easier to figure out,
        whether you're at home, at work, at the local coffee shop, or
        riding your city's wi-fi enabled public transport.

      * Color management. Do you like your printouts to look the same as
        they do on screen - or your scanner output to look the same as
        what you just scanned? Color Management allows you to better set
        and control your colors for displays, printers, and scanners,
        through the gnome-color-manager package.

      * Enhanced iPod functionality. Newer Apple iPod, iPod Touch and
        iPhone models are supported by some of your favorite photo
        management software, and music library applications such as
        Rhythmbox. The devices are automatically attached using the
        libimobiledevice library, so you can work with your content more
        easily.

      * Experimental 3D graphics support extended to free Nouveau driver
        for NVidia cards. In this release we are one step closer to
        having 3D graphics supported on completely free and open source
        software (FOSS) drivers. Fedora 12 saw the enabling of a number
        of ATI cards; this time around, we've added a wide range of
        NVidia cards to our list of liberated video capabilities. You
        can install the mesa-dri-drivers-experimental package to try out
        the work in progress.

      * DisplayPort support improvements - Fedora 12 added initial
        support for the new DisplayPort display connector for Intel
        graphics chips. Support for Nvidia and ATI systems have now have
        added in this release.

      * Experimental user management interface. The user account tool
        has been completely redesigned, and the accountsdialog and
        accountsservice test packages are available to make it easy to
        configure personal information, make a personal profile picture
        or icon, generate a strong passphrase, and set up login options
        for your Fedora system. Try out the work in progress.

For developers there are all sorts of additional goodies:

      * SystemTap static probes. SystemTap now has expanded capabilities
        to monitor higher-level language runtimes like Java, Python, and
        Tcl, and also user space applications, starting with PostgreSQL.
        In the future, Fedora will add support for even more user space
        applications, greatly increasing the scope and power of
        monitoring for application developers.

      * Easier Python debugging. We've added new support that allows
        developers working with mixed libraries (Python and C/C++) in
        Fedora to get more complete information when debugging with gdb,
        making Fedora an exceptional platform for powerful, rapid
        application development.

      * Parallel-installable Python 3 stack. The parallel-installable
        Python 3 stack will help programmers write and test code for use
        in both Python 2.6 and Python 3 environments, so you can
        future-proof your applications now using Fedora.

      * NetBeans Java EE 6 support. The NetBeans 6.8 integrated
        development environment is the first IDE to offer complete
        support for the entire Java EE 6 specification.

And don't think we forgot the system administrators:

      * boot.fedoraproject.org (BFO). BFO allows users to download a
        single, tiny image (could fit on a floppy) and install current
        and future versions of Fedora without having to download
        additional images.

      * System Security Services Daemon (SSSD). SSSD provides expanded
        features for logging into managed domains, including caching for
        offline authentication. How does this help the sysadmin? This
        means, for example, users on laptops can still login when
        disconnected from the company's managed network. The
        authentication configuration tool in Fedora has already been
        updated to support SSSD, and work is underway to make it even
        more attractive and functional.

      * Pioneering NFS features. Fedora offers the latest version 4 of
        the NFS protocol for better performance, and, in conjunction
        with recent kernel modifications, includes IPv6 support for NFS
        as well.

      * Zarafa Groupware - Alternative to Microsoft Exchange. Zarafa now
        makes available a complete Open Source groupware suite that can
        be used as a drop-in Exchange replacement for Web-based mail,
        calendaring, collaboration, and tasks. Features include IMAP/POP
        and iCal/CalDAV capabilities, native mobile phone support, the
        ability to integrate with existing Linux mail servers, a full
        set of programming interfaces, and a comfortable look and feel
        using modern Ajax technologies.

      * Btrfs snapshots integration. Btrfs is capable of creating
        lightweight filesystem snapshots that can be mounted (and booted
        into) selectively. The created snapshots are copy-on-write
        snapshots, so there is no file duplication overhead involved for
        files that do not change between snapshots. It allows developers
        to feel comfortable experimenting with new software without fear
        of an unusable install -- automated snapshots allow them to
        easily revert to the previous day's filesystem.

      * Dogtag Certificate System It is an enterprise-class open source
        Certificate Authority (CA) supporting all aspects of certificate
        lifecycle management including key archival, OCSP and smartcard
        management. Brought into the fold as part of the Red Hat
        acquisition of Netscape technologies, this certificate server is
        fully free and open source and now included in Fedora.

And that's only the beginning. A more complete list and details of all
the new features onboard Fedora 13 is available here:

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/13/FeatureList

We have nightly composes of alternate spins available here:

Message-ID: <20100413181612.14360@gmx.com>

First of all, it's happy to see that you're interested in Linux but I would like recommend you to go through this one first: http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html (take some free time, read it completely).

Read through the basic concepts like "what is operating system, Linux, file system, kernel, shell, memory, I/O" etc., from internet before you start asking questions. (or email me: open[DOT]source[AT]gmx[DOT]com)

I think links like http://www.linuxdocs.org is a nice place to start with but there are tons of other web pages available there in www. If you're interested in programming and advanced stuff: try this http://www.advancedlinuxprogramming.com/alp-folder

There are many flavors (http://www.linux.org/dist/list.html) in Linux; you'll get to know which OS to install in your box once you understand the above basics. 

PS: I'm not sure how many people entitled in this list, may be in thousands. Let's not spamming others mailbox!

Subject: [Ilugc] how to install linux which os is best ?
Message-ID: <20100413181612.14360@gmx.com>

First of all, it's happy to see that you're interested in Linux but I would like recommend you to go through this one first: http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html (take some free time, read it completely).

Read through the basic concepts like "what is operating system, Linux, file system, kernel, shell, memory, I/O" etc., from internet before you start asking questions. (or email me: open[DOT]source[AT]gmx[DOT]com)

I think links like http://www.linuxdocs.org is a nice place to start with but there are tons of other web pages available there in www. If you're interested in programming and advanced stuff: try this http://www.advancedlinuxprogramming.com/alp-folder

There are many flavors (http://www.linux.org/dist/list.html) in Linux; you'll get to know which OS to install in your box once you understand the above basics. 

PS: I'm not sure how many people entitled in this list, may be in thousands. Let's not spamming others mailbox!

You're right that there are thousands of people on this list. It
helps everyone if you adhere to mailing list guide lines while
posting here.  See:

So, a few quick notes:  You will have to actually describe why I would
want to pay for this service instead of using the dozens and dozens of
free and open source hosting providers available elsewhere.  Lack of git
support and lack of transparency in pricing is a downer.  Have you
published the custom scripts anywhere?

Have you looked at Redhat MRG?

and oh you better focus on the storage IO performance if you are
serving out video streams. spread them across lot of spindles.

looks like there was another reply on the subject change:
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2010-April/056454.html

it's RHEL (v2.6.18-128.1.1.el5) and Solaris (SunOS 5.8
Generic_117350-39 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Fire-880), no SUSE here.

As Arun mentioned, he/she has to give other details such as 32 or
64-bit etc. I think one way of testing the performance of the app in
one machine/OS model at a time and compare it against w/ the other
one.

Many small enterprises and college students who wants an efficient
project tracking tool, doesn't want to make their source code and
project info public - atleast till the project ends. In our service
people can make their projects as *private* and I think almost all
free project hosting providers require the project details and info to
be made public. This we see as a key differentiator among the dozens
of free hosting provider available out there.

> Lack of git

For the start, we have added SVN and Hg support. In future we are
planning to add almost all VCS's that Redmine supports.

>

We have clearly mentioned the prices and there is no hidden charges
other than that.
The corporate customers will have varied requirements - so we will
decide the cost for
them after discussing the requirements and needs with them.

The custom scripts will be published soon, and the custom built
modules will be contributed back to the Redmine project :)

We will soon add a FAQ section, which will have all these queries answered.

Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of committing early, and often
to a "Free/Open Source Software" project, and thereby providing your
changes to everyone for review at an early stage in the project,
rather than completing a project, and then realizing that there
already exists another project that has a better design, and that does
things efficiently?

shell is like a DOS prompt for Linux based OS.

Linux is a Kernel.

I do not find his presentation online, it will be better his
presentation be made online along with all the video clipping he
showed. Apart from the source code , picture reading relating to the

Yes but nevertheless some companies want to operate in that model.  
Look at Android development for one example of this.  I suspect any
takers of such hosting options would be proprietary companies not having
their own project infrastructure and willing to outsource the
maintenance for cash.

Can somebody help me enable 5.1 in Ubuntu. I have tried to Google it
but haven't got a solution.

Also, how do I find if the default sound system is ALSA or PULSE in my
computer? Is there some kind of a tool to collect data in Ubuntu like
the 'Belarc Advisor' for Windows?

5.10 is ancient. It was release 4.5 years back.

Pulseaudio didn't exist when Ubuntu 5.10 was released so you cannot
have pulseaudio. And pulseaudio isn't hardware, it's a software.

@Mehul : I think , Deepak points out 5.1 to be the sound system attached to
his PC
and he needs to enable it,it seems !

and there is no Ubuntu 5.1 version , as the Ubuntu team 'll release 2
versions per year ,that is at the mid of April (like 5.04) and October (like
5.10) .. .Guess I'm right

Sorry, I goofed up there.
As to viewing what hardware is there, OP can try lshw, which is a
command line program. There's also GUI for it in Administration menu,
if you use GNOME. Can't recall it's name though.

Dont ask two irrelevant questions in a single thread.

Here is the list of 80 of the Best Linux Security Applications
http://www.linuxlinks.com/article/20080429140249467/Security.html

You can mix those tools and get an alternate to Belarc Auditor.

I like BackTrack linux.

Friends,

Thanks a lot for your continuous support and encourages for
maintaining this blog http://fossjobs.wordpress.com

I am working on this blog from March 19, 2007, for 3 years. So happy
to see the hits crossing 2 Lakhs.
It shows the thurst of Indians to work with the Free Open Source
Software technologies.

When I decided to find a job in FOSS in 2006, it was so tough to get
the job details.
After some struggle and patience, I got a job which I love.

Then, decided to open this blog to share all the job details I get to
the public.

It is so easy to open a blog like this and publish the details we get.
This is to inspire the people to share and contribute to the community
without spending any money.

As the blog get more content, more visitors come and leave their comments.
As I see, most of the readers give comments with their entire resume,
instead of applying to the mentioned email address.

The companies wont look on the comments posted in this blog.

As I was thinking on how to make this easier, My Friend in Delhi,
Narendra Sisodiya, [ narendra.sisodiya AT gmail.com ]
came up with a new website for FOSS Jobs.

http://fossjobs.in

It is powered by the popular open source job board software ?JobberBase?

It has the following features.

    * job posting without account;
    * powerful job searching;
    * apply to interesting jobs;
    * administration panel;
    * RSS feeds;
    * javascript badge/widget;
    * homepage-featured jobs management;
    * locations management;
    * ? and many more!

Yes. It is a community movement to gather all the FOSS based jobs and
publish in a common place.
Anyone can post a job requirement. No registrations are required.

Me and Narendra has the admin roles, who can review the posts and publish them.

I request all of you to review the site and share all your job opening
details there.
That will be a great contribution to the Indian Job Seekers in the FOSS domain.


I am not closing this blog. Will be publishing interesting articles,
interviews, and suggestions related to FOSS jobs.

By FOSS most of you guys stop with Linux. I am going to create an OpenBSD
based mail server soon. We have our own mail daemon called OpenSMTPD.

It has been in development and it is not mature yet. Still when you
compare with
popular industry standard solutions like qmail I think it will excel it.

I am going to create a web interface for user management soon.

I can use roundcubemail for webmail. I will use dovecot for IMAP and some other
thing for POP3.

It can send and receive mail through SMTP. I also need to enable
submission port on 587. Need SSL certificates for secure access and I
need to do something about enabling access from Blackberry like
handheld devices.

These are the basic set of requirements.

Some more basic things include mail monitoring, network monitoring,
producing graphs for mail traffic, inspecting mail queues and so on.

The advanced features include ability to search mails, achiving and indexing
mails, backing it up, mail controls and scanning for keywords and so on.

Of course the most important thing these days with mail servers is
spam control. I can give that also.

I am just building this product and it requires real life exposure to know what
all people expect from a mail server.

I think bundling FTP server from pure-ftpd is require for my customer
at least. Others may also like it. So will file sharing using Samba I
suppose.

Of course all my products are boxes and this is no different. It will
be a plug and play hardware appliance which people can configure using
the web interface.

If this is ur requirements, then I would also suggest you to look the
security feature of Lotus Notes/Domino.... Its a proprietary s/w, but has
good security feature....
Here I m not advocating the Lotus Notes, I m just suggesting you to look its
security and other features, so that it will help you to understand and
create the cross certification between OU, replica etc like concepts.

Hi all,

I compiled the latest vanilla kernel from the kernel.org - 2.6.34-rc4. I enabled all the necessary CD/DVD related switches during compilation, but the drive (LG DVD Writer) is not working.

CD drive is working in Debian kernel 2.6.32. Can someone help me with this?

This does not seem to work for 89V51rd2. It has options for 89C51RD2
though. What can be tweaked to add another device type in the code and
what are the differences between two. and oh I am consulting my buddy

I already mention that I m not promoting Lotus notes,  I have just suggested
to implement some of the concept which I find useful, for implementing this
u doesn't need code but need idea such as reverse engineering.

The device is not detected during bootup. Following is the error that gets thrown up when i give 'eject' command

   eject: tried to use `/dev/scd0' as device name but it is no block device
   eject: tried to use `/mnt/cdrom' as device name but it is no block device
   eject: unable to find or open device for: `cdrom'

freenode today at 7:00 PM. You should have a recent Fedora system
running and make sure to install fedora-packager before coming up.

# yum install fedora-packager

Reading material at

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/A_Short_RPM_Tutorial

I will be covering the basics of RPM Packaging in Fedora and you can
follow along and build a "hello" package.  I can continue the session
for a couple of hours or until everyone gets their package built and
verified, whichever comes first.  My nick is mether and I am usually
available in #fedora-india if you have any questions about getting
started.

Oh! That reminds me of one Idea which has never been attempted before;
TTS Using sanskrit as basis/reference. You bet it will have a huge
impact in the mobile and other sectors.

Hi
Sorry, Let me explain it once again.
To Upload files(through form submission) to backend server's script which requires it as tis input files. The requirement is that once the form submit button is clicked, the backend server's script supposed to get triggered to execute itself so as to deliver its output using php and Javascript or any other method.
with thanks

When a form's submit button is clicked, the server side script specified by
the 'action' attribute of your form gets invoked. What else do you want to
do?

More details.

Create your html form using this:
http://www.tizag.com/htmlT/htmlupload.php

For action attribute set your server side script as value.

FORM action="http://somesite.com/prog/adduser" method="post"

http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html

Hope it answers your query.

hello
here things are little complicated. there are three components as follows.
 
 a. front end( any html, php)
 b. server side script with action attribute from front end (php)
 c. final target script on server (php)
 
 the files to be uploaded through (a). with the help of (b) should reach over to or become input to (c) and once the (C) recognise and accepts by validating the input files, it suppose to start execute its function so as to deliver its output as per the given input file.
The event to trigger  th eexecution of final target file should start once the form submit buttion is clicked. This is what the requirement.  the complication involves in synchronizing first two with the third one.
with thanks

I hope the posted file is just data and not some executable which your users

By code base if you mean the "source" code, then postfix might be

Besides what Raman has presented, other solutions for consideration.
(a) thin clients (old PCs with PXE bootable NICs)
(b) NComputing (sandwich box devices that connect to a desktop server
- solution comes with it's own "desktop" server software.  It is not
FOSS though.

Both are commands to search for files. find walks through the filesystem and
prints the files that meet a test criteria. locate searches through a database
that contains the list of files present in the system. The database is updated
by the updatedb script that is run periodically under crond.

find results are more accurate, but the program is slow, because it has to walk
through the filesystem tree. locate results are generally less accurate, because
the database might not be up-to date. If you are searching through a folder
whose contents change frequently (Ex: /home) then use find. If you are searching
through a folder whose contents do not change (Ex: /usr) then use locate.

the users will be uploading their data in the form of text through form submission(interface) and the script (b) will parse them and place in the designated folder in the server side. Then the backend server script will pick up these input files from these folders for further processing as input before delivering the desired output. These exercise should be automated right from file uploading till the target script execution. I have individually created all three files using php but waiting for synchronization & automation.

Your 'backend' server will be listening on some port and uses some
application level protocol to consume and output data. From the php script,
feed the input  and get the output from it using its protocol.

IMO, it would be simpler to do away with the 'backend' server and put all
the processing logic in a script that gets invoked from your php!

Hey team,
Tonight I whipped up a short video advertisement for our project.

It cannot touches my heart! Why? Because of is tinyness and lack of
information. I mean, the video could be little bit longer and could be
supplied with more text and some other links and information.  :)

You are looking for multiseat.

You can get this working with multiple VGA cards and USB keyboards/monitors.

Any reasonably good Linux programmer can do this using the event
interface in a day or two.

There are some commercial products that do this too.

I am not aware of any limit.

Find is real time, locate uses an old database. It is much faster but
not current. It won't show
files changed after the DB was built. You can rebuild the DB using the
updatedb(8) command.

> ?3. what s the major difference between linux and windows filesystem?

Windows filesystems are very different from Linux filesystems. I
wonder how to answer this question.

I am not really a file systems guy.

I care about stability and disk write performance and there UNIX file
systems are quite good.

Recovery from crashes like power failures and such also matter.

Hi All,

I am new to this group and just joined up last week sometime. Just 
wanted to say hello :)

Anyway, here is a simple explanation of your query:-

Cloud computing is nothing but technology that have all computing power 
in the Internet. For e.g., right now, when you use email, you already 
use the cloud. However, in cloud computing case, even your operating 
system will boot from cloud. You will only have a dumb terminal in front 
of you with no capabilities.

The future is what Pano Technologies have introduced. 
http://www.panologic.com/
<http://www.panologic.com/>

A true virtualised desktop with no computing power. This is what cloud 
is all about. And when the company needs more processing/computing 
power, they just buy it from the cloud services provider, instead of 
buying it on their own. Imagine the hardware/maintenance cost savings if 
this model is implemented.

The only true major hurdle with this type of implementation is the 
security of the cloud.

Hope this helps :-)

Regards,
--

check these links to know more about cloud computing.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing
http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/
http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud

To simplify, its like utility service such as electricity.  You use
electricity whenever and whatever quantity you need and pay for it at the
end of the month.  With  cloud computing one can demand for  computing power
whenever and however  much  needed and pay per utilization unit.

This requires considerable amount of  infrastructure  to be set up at the
provider's side. At the user's end, its sheer convenience. Imagine you have
a startup with limited costs, no IT resources, you have to get started
immediately and get the product live etc. All you do is, go to a cloud
provider, demand for resources, start  using it right away and pay per usage
unit. Its a win win for all.


Thanks

I don't think you can disable sound on your "host" OS (running
natively on the computer hardware) and expect to get sound out of the
guest OS in VirtualBox.

Message-ID: <x2id88cc5d41004170823n1495d4c5y7b533f9e6e956642@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am trying to compile KDE Marble from source.
I wanted both Qt and kde version on my system.
How can I accomplish this ?

I did the following:

I needed to change the default installation locationi.e. /usr/local
(otherwise both installation will overwrite each other)
I used cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= /usr/exportqt ../marble
 (exportqt is the directory where I want the Qt version to be installed)
Any other way ?


after this I used "make install"
Then, I set the environment as export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/exportqt/bin/marble
(marble is the name of the executable)

Any other alternative to set environment ?

But when I invoke marble from the shell, it says "marble not installed". On
clicking the marble gadget icon from the applications directory it says "
marble executable not found".

How can I overcome this problem ?


Thanks

Message-ID: <1271517948.3986.8.camel@mjolnir>

Hey, everyone,

This is a bit of a silly question, but does anyone know if there is a
simple command-line application which will trash files as per the
freedesktop.org spec? <http://www.ramendik.ru/docs/trashspec.html>

I know, I know, I should write it myself, but if it's just an `aptitude
install` away, why not use that?

What I understand from VirtualBox is, it uses the host operating system to
run the guest operating system. No sound in host => no sound in guest.

For example: Internet/LAN usage in guest OS. If you see the LAN ip address
of the guest, and if you see the actual ip of the packets(genrated from your
guest OS) that are going out of your system, it contains the ip that your
host OS has obtained. There is NAT running in the background to translate
the ip addresses. I hope you understand.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

You should set this marble bin path in PATH variable. Like
PATH=$PATH:/usr/exportqt/bin/marble

I think we have discussed (in march foss meeting) this item informally
but I've missed the last meeting (april one), not sure if any decision
was taken or not. Hopefully we can setup something in the college

VirtualBox simulates a PC (processor and peripherals). The simulation is so
complete that any general-purpose operating system can be run within the
simulated system, without modifications. The operating system running within
VirtualBox is called the guest. VirtualBox achieves speed by trying to execute
the guest instructions natively on the host processor (instead of simulating
them in software), as much as possible.

For more details, please see http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox

Vijay

Hi ppl,
         ILUG group has been doing a wonderful job of organizing workshops and seminars about open source softwares, spreading the awareness.I request the organisers to record the proceedings so that people who are not able to attend the events will be benefited.There are many free video hosting sites who can host the videos ..(like NPTEL lectures which are really helpful for the student community)!

I am not referred you. Generally, every LUG activity/task needs a
physical volunteer. With-out volunteer nothing will happen.

Hai all,


I am using Ubuntu Server 9.10  as a my FTP server. I would like to create a
FTP user account with two passwords ( Rather than sharing the passwords).
And to set privileges to the user who is logged in based on the passwords.
Your suggestions are welcomed.

Any specific reason not to have two usernames ?

Message-ID: <4c265c9be673024eeeb13d11251cd160.squirrel@nic-nac-project.org>

Hi,

Storing/organizing the notes when reading is very important I feel.
This would be handy when searching and during quick retrieval with enough
of features. Also that is the way our brain organises the information.

I had been using "The Guide" a very nice windows based open source
software(Now available for Ubuntu/Debian as well). Based on the
name(Mahadevan R) of the developer it appears that it was developed by a
Tamilian. The author is not showing interest to enhance it further though
it is a very good tool.

Though I liked it very much, it lacks few rich features.

Can somebody suggest few small, open source feature rich tools which
supports rich text and embedding images with multiples pages shown as
file/directory multi-node structure. Essentially it needs to have
control+F/search facility.

Online tools are not very interesting as I do not want to give any
personal/"need to be secure" information to someone to access easily and
freely.

I have tried, freemind, evernote, ubernote.

Other than this, if someone can suggest any tool, that would be helpful
and great.

Note: Those who have not tried "The Guide", give a try, you will like it.

Thank you very much.

Can u tell me why u need two password for an account and what I know is that
an FTP user can have only one password at a time, explain your requirements
briefly....so that it will be easy for us to understand ur requirements.

  Why not have just two usernames instead with full-rights and partial 
rights? I think it is a better solution and more secure than what you 
are trying to achieve.

(Never heard of a user having two passwords. That's a first ;-) ;-) )

Subject: [Ilugc] Oilsville: a new open source game
Message-ID: <v2pbc5cb461004182352o9c1d255dva96455ccc4daba2b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I hacked up a game to illustrate Peak Oil[1] and christened it
"Oilsville". My hope is that people will now be able to grasp the
phenomenon of peak oil - how any finite resource (or even a renewable
resource stripped faster than it is being replenished) will reach a
"peak" in how much volume can be extracted and eventually start
declining, no matter what improvements in technology are made.

The premise of the game is simple: There is a new oil field waiting to
be exploited. You got a rig (with configurable "size of the straw")
which will start pumping out oil. Every well will start yielding
lesser and lesser over time as the underlying geology dictates that
the pressure must decrease. Larger sized rigs, as with reality,
requires larger amounts of energy to operate and are also costly to
operate. The only way to ramp up production is therefore to drill
more. But the catch is... the more you drill, the closer you are to
peaking production and you'd eventually reach a point where no matter
how big your rig is, you cannot increase production! But given this is
Oil Money, rest assured you'll be a millionaire oil tycoon!

Feel the frustration as you ramp up your fight against Entropy! :)

Check out the screen shots: http://peakoilgame.com/scrshot.html

Download: http://peakoilgame.com/download.html

The game source is perl + SDL. perl pod documentation exists but there
is lot to be desired in the code documentation area. I've tested this
on Ubuntu (karmic). The source ships with a script that builds the deb
and doubles up as a (hacky) non-ubuntu installer.

I'm seeking volunteers, code contributors and hackers for the following things:

1. Port to Facebook - the core game is SDL agnostic so it should be
quite easy to port, I believe. I'm specifically looking for hosting a
Farmville contender (hence the name "Oilsville") :)
2. Port to windows - I'd ideally love to have a windows installer,
much like what the Frozen Bubble[2] folks have done.
3. Port to Flash - since I have peakoilgame.com[3] registered, I'm
looking for a flash version that can be played online - hosted on
peakoilgame.com but also available for free download.
4. writing test cases, documentation, etc., (you know, the part that
developers typically avoid :) ).

... of course, I'm willing to get surprised by new, creative
applications of the code. The code is general enough to be used for
any "peak anything" types game/simulation.

I would love to contribute on IT Infrastructure, But I am at Mumbai
and not Chennai. Somehow Either I or Chennai did/could not like/afford
each other in our recent previous stint.


<SIGH> If only ILUG-BOM held such workshop, If only I could give back
something of my 26 years of experience to our community.

No, it goes against the grain of user security model in any OS.

I strongly second the solutions that others have suggested i.e. have
separate logins for your developers and customers.

Besides the above you can attain additional ACL via group ids, sticky
bits, and your file system's extended ACLs.

Please read them up, do some testing on your desktop before embarking
on any implementation on production systems.

Hi Sri kumaran ,
I am Jeyanthan, Student of KLNCIT, organizing OSUG/GTUG SUMMER CAMP
2010 on 17th of May !!
I havent got any clue on what you are talking about !!
Where have you seen that Mr.Subramanium is coming to our College (KLNCIT) ?
and who is he, actually ?

Meanwhile , we already have the habit of archiving the past events
(with its slides and photos) and updating with all the future events .
.so my request to others those who dont have a site is to maintain a
site (probably on a free ones like Google sites or a on blog like
blogger.com / wordpress.com) along with the slides and photos and
videos too, if possible.

One may have a look at the archive of past events of one of our user
groups here http://madurai.gtugs.org/gallery-1
I will try to upload videos, as well, from next event onwards !

Message-ID: <q2v4a9fbd51004190231y63fc90ccm788f8919efa82a21@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Environment :
Ubuntu Server 9.10-*Karmic* Koala. (Grub 0.97 beta4 came with the OS itself)

*Scenario:*
The machine is installed with the OS mentioned is doesn't have Monitor or
Keyboard/Mouse connected. Using this as a server to do some specific taks
without user/admin control.

*Problem:*
When sometimes the power fails and during restarting it didn't boots up and
stops at Grub boot loader menu. And not loading the default OS. Only it
boots when we pressed Enter key by connecting keyboard. So i would like the
machine to boot the default os at any cause without stopping at Grub boot
loader menu. Please let us know the solution or any option are there to
configure in grub configuration.


*The grub configuration are follows:*

# If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update
# /boot/grub/grub.cfg.

GRUB_DEFAULT=0
GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=1
GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true
GRUB_TIMEOUT="10"
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""

# Uncomment to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)
#GRUB_TERMINAL=console

# The resolution used on graphical terminal
# note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE
# you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'
#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480

# Uncomment if you don't want GRUB to pass "root=UUID=xxx" parameter to
Linux
#GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true

# Uncomment to disable generation of recovery mode menu entrys
#GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_RECOVERY="true"

Dear Mr. Jeyanthan,
                                 I only requested the organisers to record the proceeding meaning all the talks , sessions where ppl come and talk (both audio and video) so that it can be used by others to learn in future.
Its like the opencourse ware where ppl give the lecture videos for free so that student community gets benefited.

Cheers,
Sri

Hi Mr.Sri Kumaran,

Oops !! I have totally misunderstood your first line cos of a comma
misplacement in that first line and replied with anxiety :P
Anyways pardon me for that :)
I'll plan for a video recording during sessions and upload it once I'v
done with that :)

My Suggestion is to share their Session slides too, so that, if any
others are planning to take sessions on the same topic, they wud reuse
it with some alterations.
Is my suggestion worthy ?

I do not know if you have noticed - Chennai LUG as such conducts practically 
nothing. LUG guys go out and do things on behalf of the LUG. I fail to see why 
you are waiting for Mumbai LUG to 'use' you. Go out, fix something, announce on 
the LUG list, ask for volunteers - and just go ahead and *do* it regardless of 
whether the volunteers turn up. I know the youngsters in Mumbai - they have 
never failed to turn up for any event I have announced in the area.

As far as I know, it is not possible in any FTP server software I have
looked at. The user name is mapped to a single password.

What you can do is to have multiple users with different access rights to
the same folder. You could give your clients one username with the lower
access rights and give your developers separate usernames with greater
levels of access to those directories. It is not hard to do.

Technically, its possible. At worst you can modify the src of some open
source ftp server to achieve that!

But the idea behind a 'username' is to give an identity to some entity
that's performing some actions on the system. And the password is just to
ensure the entity is the authorized owner of the 'identiy'. In your case you
want to restrict actions based on identity. So, its clearly a case of two
usernames!

Hai Prem,

I think that its a good idea. If two passwords with single user breaks the
security criteria. Then i would like to follow your method ( Which u posted
here).


Thanks & Regards

Hi,

I don't know how to explain the below usage in shell script. But I will
explain the usage in C. I have created this very simple  program to show you
the usage of getopt(). Let us assume that the below program is your
application(calculation.c). This program will call the function sum(),
sub(), mul() and divi()  depending upon the option (-S,-s,-m,-d). This is
the one way parsing command line argument within your application. compile
and execute the program. You will feel the usage .

//This very basis example will show you the getopt usage
//calculation.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>


int sum(int , int);
int sub(int , int);
int mul(int , int);
int divi(int , int);
void usage();

int main(int argc , char *argv[])
{
    int c;
    int input1;
    /* process arguments */
    while (-1 != (c = getopt(argc, argv,"S:" "s:" "m:" "d:" "h")))
    {
            switch (c)
        {
            case 'S':
                input1=atoi(optarg);
                printf("Sum : %d\n",sum(input1,2));
                break;
            case 's':
                input1=atoi(optarg);
                printf("Sub : %d\n",sub(input1,2));
                break;
            case 'm':
                input1=atoi(optarg);
                printf("Mul : %d\n",mul(input1,2));
                break;
            case 'd':
                input1=atoi(optarg);
                printf("Div : %d\n",divi(input1,2));
                break;
            case 'h':
                printf("usage goes here\n");
                usage();
                break;
            default:
                exit(0);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
//addition
int sum(int x , int y)
{
    return (x+y);

}
//subtraction
int sub(int x, int y)
{
    return (x-y);
}
//Multiplication
int mul(int x, int y)
{
    return (x*y);
}

//devision
int divi(int x, int y)
{
    return (x/y);
}

void usage()
{
    printf("./caculation -S <num1>\twill add: num1+2\n");
    printf("./caculation -s <num2>\twill sub: num2-2\n");
    printf("./caculation -m <num3>\twill mul: num3*2\n");
    printf("./caculation -d <num4>\t will div: num4\2\n");
    printf("./caculation -h \twill display this help message\n");
}

Compile :

$ gcc -Wall calculation.c -o claculation

Execute the program with deffent option:

$./claculation -S 10

$./claculation -S 10 -s 20

$./claculation -S 10 -s 20 -m 5

$./claculation -S 10 -s 20 -m 5 -d 30

Hi

You've already got quite a few responses with suggestions, so, I am going to 
repeat that. However, I just wanted to point something out ...

On 04/19/2010 10:18 AM, JITHIN K wrote:

Think a bit about what you described and you'll see what you are describing is 
one user (the customer) and a group of other users (the developers). So, an 
alternate way to go approach this would be to make a one to one mapping between 
actual users (customers as well as individual developers) and implementing 
access control based on groups.

cheers,

Why cant we just go for video conferencing or request Mr. Swaminathan to record his speech , play it during the workshop.And for queries we can use the group ....People like him who have a lot of industrial exposure are difficult to find even if you find one they wont be interested in doing it for free.So I request to use whatever means we have to get the knowledge to flow..

I do not know if you have noticed - Chennai LUG as such conducts practically 
nothing. LUG guys go out and do things on behalf of the LUG. I fail to see why 
you are waiting for Mumbai LUG to 'use' you. Go out, fix something, announce on 
the LUG list, ask for volunteers - and just go ahead and *do* it regardless of

Dear Mr. Jeyanthan,
             Sorry for that comma error ..Uploading of slides will be useful but videos are more important for students like us who are new to this field.It may be the reason why most of the universities have started uploading videos of lectures and not only the slides and notes.NPTEL has been doing a really good job!!

cheers,
Sri

Hi Mr.Sri Kumaran,

Oops !! I have totally misunderstood your first line cos of a comma
misplacement in that first line and replied with anxiety :P
Anyways pardon me for that :)
I'll plan for a video recording during sessions and upload it once I'v
done with that :)

My Suggestion is to share their Session slides too, so that, if any
others are planning to take sessions on the same topic, they wud reuse
it with some alterations.
Is my suggestion worthy ?

there is shivaji university in Kolhapur - 20-30 engineering colleges in the 
area with a lot of staff who are just longing for people to come across and 
conduct workshops. They have foss labs and if anyone is interested in taking 
workshops they just need to contact me - I will give them the contacts and

Do you have any other OS installed? As a workaround, you can try setting 
the GRUB_TIMEOUT=0 instead and for troubleshooting purposes when 
something goes wrong, you can try out the USB boot disk or a CD instead, 
since the other GRUB loader options will not be accessible.

We  at ILUGC can do a tutorial every week if you want. But where are the students you are talking about? Everytime we try - remember weekly GNU Vidyashram started by Sakthi- the response was very poor. This is the reason why we want others to organise and ILUGC provides only the technical resource.

However, we are willing to retry weekly tutorial if there are atleast 10 students in each session.

True, but he should get an NXDOMAIN then.

I'm not sure about this, but I think /etc/resolv.conf is where the
nameservers to be used are listed. So it's probably worth checking to
see if there are any there.

What does `dig @8.8.8.8 pc1.example.com` say?

I guess, what you are looking for is Path-Based Authorization. Please see

Dear Mr. Raman,
                               I can understand your position and I greatly appreciate the efforts you have taken to spread the importance open source software.There are few things which I want to discuss here.
Our academic system is too narrow minded making the students to learn the subject only for scoring marks in the sem exams(even in higher education) and not to learn by experience(taking up project, class discussion).Over the years it has created an image among student community that doing projects is waste of time..so they have lost interest in these kind of activities.Having said that I know few people who come from different background like Biotech ,chemical  they are greatly interested in programming(linux.etc) again under parental pressure they were forced to take streams which they have no interest and pursuing them only for a job in IT field..So there are lot many factors which makes the students to shy away from doing projects especially in open source...

Students of my age in other countries especially in US and EU  have contributed a lot for open source but we (majority of engineering students in India)  dont even know what is GPL..:-) this is current scenario...Slowly this trend is changing but at snail's space.Only thing we could do is to use whatever resource we have to make the knowledge available for the students by recording lectures and in many other ways.Let the interested students use those resources and come up with good projects(remember when we have a workshop in Chennai it doesnt mean that an aspiring linux beginner in  a not so famous engineering college of remote India will be able to utilize the resource  )So please divert your efforts in making the resource available for the greater mass and not just concentrate around certain pockets of the student community).I am in no position to judge about the quality of the efforts you have taken to spread the knowledge but I am only sharing my
 thoughts with you.

Cheers,
Sri Hari

It sounded more of like snubbing anyways hard feeling apart...The main reasons why i started this topic was to request the organizers to record the proceedings.Did it involve more of talking Mr . Ravi ..I dont think so..

Am sorry, my intention is not hurt an individual.

The main reasons why i started this topic was to request the organizers to
> record the proceedings.Did it involve more of talking Mr . Ravi

My humble request is why cant you set a trend for others to follow.
1. Organise a workshop, let the list know about it.
2. You would get the resource persons from list, based on the subject you
are interested in for the workshop.
3. print "Record" X 1000

YES. It is just talking. Organize if you can to record; or organize
for some x students to be present and ask ILUGC people to come and
conduct. We will do it.

IOW, say specific things like
"I will ensure X students are present at Y place for topics Z on so
and so dates. Please bring volunteers to train."

Dont tell people who are already volunteering how/what to do

One thing I'm not sure why are we not understanding the importance of volunteer's time. Already I see there are strong points made by fellow experienced members/volunteers of this group (earlier in the thread), again capturing the talk/lecture in some format would be a good idea but in the same time, that needs human intervention ie. volunteers.

Also one more thing, "I would definitely try to find group interested in foss call.." appreciate if you could try to form that "interesting group" from your neighbourhood/college/school/friends circle. Just get 5-10 people and discuss things periodically, no matter how are the depth of topics and thats going to be a real platform for showing your skills. It may be a small meetup in your town, village or even coffee shops, parks etc. Just make it in action and I would like to see you coming here with topics.

PS: thanks to the folks who gave me some suggestions (during my previous posts); 1. top posting (corrected) 2. my first name & last name in the email (updated)

Suggestions and feedbacks are  useless by themselves. Because from the
1996 LDD we have been receiving those by the tonne. But without any
work whatsoever these are bound to remain just that. Take the idea of
videos. Where is the camera? Who will take the effort to record and
upload?
You seem to be coming across as "You guys are anyway doing the other
thing; please do this also"

>..Thanks, made yourself very clear.
I sincerely hope so

>I would have organized workshops if I had the expertise .
Organising requires effort not  expertise.

>I would definitely try to find group interested in foss call ILUG ppl to give a workshop ..
That would be very welcome.

Why do you need a DNS set up...

anyways, here is the procedure...

as root run the following... I am assuming you are using CentOS5.4

yum install dns
you will need some basic DNS zone files. If you are using GUI then
install system admin scrips

yum system-config-bind

run the system-config-bind. It will complain that you don't have
certain zone files. It will offer to create them for you... accept it.

now you can use your favorite editor to create your zone file...

nano / gedit /var/named/chroot/etc/named.conf

You need to create your DNS server config file... it is our of scope
of this email...

after which you need to create 2 zone files (forward and reverse zone
files)... it is out of scope of this email...

after which you need to restart your dns server by issueing

service named restart

well, when you restart if you want your DNS server to start automatic then type

chkconfig named on

that is it...

You'll find the answers in the deployment guide:

http://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/Deployment_Guide-en-US/


Next time, please check documentation on the CentOS
website.  CentOS/RedHat documentation is plentiful, a
web search should turn up plenty of useful documentation.
If you get stuck following the documentation, post back
for help with error messages and other details.

As a person from who has over 26 years IT Industry experience, My
observations are stated below.

1. After the LPG wave every student wants to be as rich and successful
as Shri. N. R. Narayanamurthy.

2. The non technical (Marketing) side wants to be Shri Vijay Mallaya.
Surprisingly no girl wants to be <Whatshername> Biotech Queen.

3. The finance oriented want to be THE Ambani.

So open source does not ring a bell.

People rely on word of mouth sources for their decision taking.

Above IMHO.

Agree, maybe the OP is unable to articulate the requirement.  I am
guessing that OP wants to convert a .deb package to .rpm or something
like that.  In such "alien" does it.
Caveat, every distribution has it's own dependency change irrespective
of the "package manager" it uses (DEB, RPM or TAR balls) and therefore
it is recommended to use packages specifically meant for your
distribution.

I agree with Asokan's view point having organized quite a few meets
(professional as well as social).   There are lots of suggestions on

back.  Sad to note, at most of the meets I have tried to get the
younger generation involved but found no takers;  they come to one or
two meetings and then drop out  with "too busy" with their careers.

So a message to all those who have suggestions  - provide a means to
execute your suggestions and do not expect the organizer to carry the
torch all the way.   Remember the organizers may have limited/no
access to the kind of resources to execute your suggestions.

There is a famous kural 
????????? ?????????? ???? ????????
??????? ?????? ?????.

Roughly translates to

To say(suggest) is easy for anybody, but it is difficult/rare
to do as said/suggested.

LUG is not starved of ideas, it is starved of physical volunteers.

This is a great place to deal with CentOS specific considerations.
However, IMO, it is also imperative to understand how DNS works (or
for that matter any service that one wants to deploy), at least at a
macro level i.e. action/re-action between client, server and root
servers.   I find this kind of research/curiosity lacking from the way
the questions are posed.- just tell me what to do, I don't care how
the service works.   The result is that we end up with unbaked
network/system admins who claim they know "xyz" service.

To the OP please do the following:

(a) spend the time on understanding how DNS works.   It is the most
essential service that forms the platform for practically all other
network services.d   If you don't get it right then nothing else will
work. TLDP (www.tldp.org) has  a nice HOW-TO which delves into the
basics of DNS a good starting point.  "DNS and Bind" by O'Reilly is
another great resource for DNS workings just as this is
<http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/>.  Both start from the basics and
then move on to BIND configuration.

(b) BIND is the default DNS server in most Linux distros.   However,
the config files can be organized in different ways.  The config file
organization in  RHEL/Fedor/CentOS is different from that of Debian
which is quite different from that of openSUSE.   Therefore, mention
which distro you are using and the version of BIND as well.

Dear all
Is it possible to run haddop in non-cluster or non cloud environment.

Suppose I have five Linux system connected through lan . With hadoop is it
possible to run a distributed job(Map reduce) in the five system.

I am a beginner in hadoop. If anything is not clear forgive

If it do not fit to your requirement then do not download it. Tell me just
one answer : "Ankur, a 10 year student do not have Internet at Home, He want
to use Linux on his system with LAMP, Netbeans, and Blender. Can you tell me
how he can do it with Ubuntu Or Fedora ?"
Also, ask the same question with Mint, IT@School Distro and various other
remix.

PS:Linux Distro as just great, you need to be great to use it. Think
something which your neighbour can use.
PS:Linux Distros are not made for common public because They has 2 stupid
design fault. (1) The FSH (2) Packages Management (no one click). If you
want to argue me on this statement, yes, you are allow to do so, but before
that please try to install Linux Distro in school, your friends, Govt
office, your neighbour. Because I have tried this and I am making something
based on my experience. also I do not listen to BlindLover who has tendency
for "not to listen" for improvement.

Hey aishwarya,
If your mobile provider is from the one listed already in the list of
network connection then its fine. Otherwise you may have to choose "I
cannot find my service provider" there one thing you got to keep
manually is "APN" of your connection which you can find from your
mobile in "internet settings" under which plan you have activated.

For eg: if you are using aircel you have to input "aircelgprs"

and then you are done.

Thanks.

If you don't have enough system to evaluate hadoop.  You have two option
still you can practice with Hadoop/MapReduce.

1). Standalone Operation : By default, Hadoop is configured to run in a
non-distributed mode, as a single Java process.

http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/quickstart.html

2). OpenSolaris Live Hadoop :

HDFS has a master/slave architecture. An HDFS cluster consists of a single
NameNode, a master server. There are a number of DataNodes, usually one per
node in the cluster.

The MapReduce framework consists of a single master "JobTracker" and one
slave "TaskTracker" per cluster-node.

If you have 5 box(Say box1, box2, box3, box4, box5). what you have to do is,
first install and configure HDFS NameNode(master) in box1 and install and
configure HDFS DataNodes(slave) on all other box(box2,box3,box4,box5).
then install and configure "JobTracker" in box1 and "TaskTracker" on all
other box(box2,box3,box4,box5).

1). box1 act as both NameNode and JobTracker

2). box2,box3,box4,box5 are acts as DataNodes as well as TaskTracker .



Resource :

1). http://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/

2). http://hadoop.apache.org/

The above two link has very good information about Hadoop/MapReduce. Please
take some study about HDFS and MapReduce.

In case of any further technical help, please feel free to replay.

Hi,

And here is the shell code,



[parseoptions.sh]
#!/bin/sh
# script to parse options using getopts

while getopts 'ab:' OPTION
do
         case "${OPTION}"
         in
                 a) echo "-a supplied";;
                 b) echo "-b supplied with '${OPTARG}'";;
                 *) echo "Wrong option '${OPTION}' supplied";;
         esac
done
shift $((OPTIND - 1))
echo "Remaining Arguments '${@}'"


$ ./parseoptions.sh -a -b apple orange banana
-a supplied
-b supplied with 'apple'
Remaining Arguments 'orange banana'
$





[parseoption.sh]
#!/bin/sh
# script to parse options using getopt

PARSEDOPTIONS=$(getopt -o 'ab:' --longoptions 'long-x,long-y,long-z:' -- 
"${@}")
set -- ${PARSEDOPTIONS}
while test "${1}" != "--"
do
         case "${1}"
         in
                 -a) echo "-a supplied"; shift;;
                 -b) echo "-b supplied with ${2}"; shift 2;;
                 --long-x) echo "--long-x supplied"; shift;;
                 --long-y) echo "--long-y supplied"; shift;;
                 --long-z) echo "--long-z supplied with ${2}"; shift 2;;
                 *) echo "Wrong option ${1} supplied"; shift;;
         esac
done
shift
echo "Remaining arguments ${@}"


$ ./parseoption.sh -a -b apple --long-x --long-y --long-z orange banana
-a supplied
-b supplied with 'apple'
--long-x supplied
--long-y supplied
--long-z supplied with 'orange'
Remaining arguments 'banana'
$



And finally, one of the key difference between these two is, 'getopts' 
is POSIX shell built-in, where 'getopt' is a separate executable living 
inside '/usr/bin/'. Another difference is, 'getopts' cannot parse 
options like '--big-option' whereas 'getopt' can.

I hope above examples will help you to understand getopts and getopt. 
Its a standard practice to parse options inside your shell script using 
getopts/getopt. Please read 'man getopt' and 'man sh'(then search for 
getopts) for reference.

Thanks,
Mohan R.

Friends.

It is a sad news that
Oracle is charging $90.00 U.S. for the ODF plugin for MS Office.
http://www.sun.com/software/star/odf_plugin/get.jsp

The Sun ODF Plugin for Microsoft Office gives users of Microsoft
Office Word, Excel and PowerPoint
the ability to read, edit and save to the ISO-standard Open Document
Format (ODF).

It was available for free before Oracle bought Sun.

It is too bad for the community.

Will it happen to OpenOffice and MySQL?

Unlike the ODF plugin,  Openoffice.org and MySQL are open source.

Message-ID: <t2k34d63e2b1004211902re4d0d91ag6300ea78725c7ba8@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Dasher

What it is:

 Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by
natural continuous pointing gestures. Dasher is a competitive
text-entry system wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used - for
example,

    * when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen,
trackball, or mouse;
    * when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by head-mouse
or by eyetracker);
    * on a palmtop computer;
    * on a wearable computer.

Features:

The eyetracking version of Dasher allows an experienced user to write
text as fast as normal handwriting - 29 words per minute; using a
mouse, experienced users can write at 39 words per minute.

To know more about:

http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/

To install:

sudo apt-get install dasher

It does have books pertaining to the curriculum if I understand it

How to support Edubuntu, I am shipping with lots of packages, modified
bashrc, lots of right click scripts etc. If I do this with any distro, I
have to rename it. I cannot use somebody's trademark when I planning to
develop full support and training programs and other things.

It would be useful if you provide a detailed list of changes you are
making:  What packages?  What configuration changes?  Which books/other
content and where can we download them?   If you are pre-installing more
packages, it helps to ensure that they are connected to a repository to
get updates if necessary and rely on a release with a longer lifecycle
assuming that you are not rebasing that often.   Assuming your target
audience doesn't have bandwidth for updates,  they are not going to
bandwidth for regular upgrades either.

perl has good modules for reading/writing pdf and doc file formats
look at cpan.org 
e.g
http://search.cpan.org/~rkinyon/PDF-Writer-0.06/lib/PDF/Writer.pm
http://search.cpan.org/~johanl/Win32-Word-Writer-0.03/lib/Win32/Word/Writer.pm
Though I have not used above module spreadsheet::writeexcel is working well for me.

This is not the ideal setup of a proxy server.  It suggests that
everything is on "flat" bus and any machine can by pass your proxy
server defeating the purpose of the proxy server.

However, IMO, what are trying to do can be done but  readup on
networking fundae and you should be on your way.

ipaliasing?  bridge-utils with tap0 and tap1?  virtual lan?

Google search with above keywords should give plenty of sites with
helpful notes.

If you would like to create PDFs, then have a look at ReportLab Toolkit
http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/rl-toolkit/

Cairo is also capable of rendering to a PDF backend. http://cairographics.org/

Hi,

I am trying to make sure that the users can access/mount a specific device
(sdb1) only from console pts/2 (just for experimenting purpose). I followed
the below steps. Please guide me as to what I did wrong.

1.                      vi /etc/security/console.perms

# /etc/security/console.perms
#
# This file determines the permissions that will be given to priviledged

#   file-glob|<class> perm dev-regex|<dev-class> \
#     revert-mode revert-owner[.revert-group]
# the revert-mode, revert-owner, and revert-group are optional, and default
# to 0600, root, and root, respectively.
#
# For more information:

Message-ID: <u2la8e2ecc11004230216w808d15a9l1939208eb1eb1637@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Documentation on sudoers file states the below:

jack           CSNETS = ALL

The user *jack* may run any command *on* the machines in the *CSNETS* alias
(the networks 128.138.243.0, 128.138.204.0, and 128.138.242.0). Of those
networks, only 128.138.204.0 has an explicit netmask (in CIDR notation)
indicating it is a class C network. For the other networks in *CSNETS*, the
local machine's netmask will be used during matching.

My question is that, how would the systems on those networks know that they
have to use the configs mentioned on one specific system. Does it mean that
the user (jack) can run any commands *from* systems on mentioned networks *
on* the system with the sudoers file?



Regards,

Ashish

You left out find I guess.

$ find /var/log -name *.log -type f -size +64k

translates to this in English:

 Find the files recursively under /var/log directory of name "*.log"
and of type file(-type f).

We also put another condition that their size should be more than 64 kilobytes.

Until this point it is clear.

now the remaining part.

-exec cp {} /home/

translates to

copy the files that match these criteria to /home.

{} stands for find results.

&& is used in shell to give one command after another in such a way
that the following command
will run only if the previous command returned success.

dd if=/dev/null of={} will truncate a given file to zero bytes. So in
this case, we are truncating all
found files to be of zero bytes length.

Now I would write the same thing like this.

$ find /var/log -name "*.log" -type f -size +64k | xargs -J ^ cp ^ /home

Somehow dd does not take more than one argument for of=.

So it has to be done in a loop.

Something like this would work.

$ find /var/log/ -type f -name "*.log" -size +64k > /tmp/files

$ for f in `cat /tmp/files`
  do
       dd if=/dev/null of=$f
  done

What is the issue with that?

Of course you can do that.

Packets will come to us and we will cache stuff and reply back to
internal network from our cache and
send packets out through the router/modem connection to the Internet.

There is no need for squid to run on a multihomed host.

Only routers/firewalls need to be on a multi network card machine.

Even firewalls can work with one network card. ;)

Only routers need to have multiple physical ethernet or some other
network interface(s).

In the case of a firewall you only need to block packets before they
are sent out using the router/MODEM.

In fact recently I got a firewall working for Khazana showroom in
Cathedral road opposite to Stella Marys
 college with just one network card.

Sorry for this long digression. I myself dunno much about squid.

Well I dunno about Centos.

You need to edit zone files and so on. They have an arcane syntax.

In OpenBSD you have a chrooted named that drops privileges and runs securely
 with a non root user ID.

Everything is preconfigured.

All you need to do is have a line

named_conf=""

in /etc/rc.conf.local file.

And reboot.

You get a fully functional DNS server.

It is that cool.

That is only if you want bind to be SOA for a specific domain.
Otherwise, no changes needed for a cache only name server.  Do
"chkconfig named on"  named could be bind - not sure about CentOS>

But the OP was *absolutely* ambigous about what s/he wants.

You mean I don't need to setup _any_ files if I want to be setup a DNS
server for say "intra.example.com" which has 'x' no. of hosts on
Intranet my network?

Yes you can run two different version of Apache or two different web server
(IIS and Apache httpd) in a system. Let's say you have two different version
of Apache, then can make it to bind in two different ports. By default
Apache httpd binds with 80. You can configure second server to bind with a
different port, let say 81.  To access the servers you can use the following
address.

Server 1 : http://localhost:80/
Server 2 : http://localhost:81/

I hope somebody would answer you for this question.  Good Luck

It would be highly appreciated, to google before you post your query to the
list.   Thanks.

Most of the chaps I have interviewed have all the right credentials
but within 10 mins. of interviewing it is apparent that they are paper

I would urge you to interview the candidates with your own quiz and

Since when does Linux have the "blue screen of death" feature? :-)

Rebooting, doing a memtest, checking if all components are OK, doing a
file system check (using a live CD) is my normal sequence of events in
case of a kernel panic. There are many reasons for kernel panic, such
a inability to mount root FS (a fsck should set things right in this
case);
"not syncing", so init being killed: memtest, followed by a hardware
test should be the course of action for this one.

I've seen only these two error messages commonly, but there are tools
to handle just about every error message. A replication, and solving
by trial and error on a test machine should help.

Multihomed is not a synonym for multiple network interfaces. It is possible to 
have multiple network cards and not be multihomed and it is also possible to 
have a single network card and be multihomed.

And so can routers. Routing is not necessarily between physical
networks, it could be between logical networks sharing a physical
medium.

[example information deleted]

I dont know about the point of a firewall that does not sit between two 
physical networks (i.e. firewall between logical networks that share a 
physical medium). Since the physical medium is shared, there is no isolation 
between the input and output sides of the firewall and hence it may be 
possible to defeat the firewall. It is somewhat like having a walk through 
metal detector but not requiring everyone to walk through it by providing a 
side path.

I wouldn't dismiss AK so lightly; he has been in IT since before the term was

Although you are saying this in jest,  it is a important feature that
provides better diagnostics than merely getting "struck" as it currently
happens in X if there is a serious issue.  One of the benefits of KMS
(kernel mode setting) will be the eventually ability to provide a
similar feature.

I think you are right.  Next time I interview candidates, I will keep

Identify which section of your page takes long time(Firebug is your
friend). Try cache, optimizing your code/database design. If you still
have a reason  to do large computation better solution would be load
the basic JavaScript first and load different section of the page
later and show a spinner or any other animation that you want. For a
good user experience, user should be seeing the core content in few
seconds, iterate over the optimization till you achieve what you want.

Hi,

Sorry, changed the subject since it was not related to what you were asking.

Two sites are

http://fossjobs.in

They are both run by the members of this forum, a.k.a Shrinivasan. T and

Hope you find what you are looking for :)

The subject has nothing to do with what is being discussed.

If you wish to simulate slow Internet connection use rate limiting with ssh or
 trickle or OpenBSD pf firewall.

You can do it in userland.

Take a look at trickle.

With 'tc' and 'iptables' you can control the amount of bandwidth
allocated to applications.  Perhaps you can use it to simulate the
"slow" net speed connections for your http traffic.

Google search "linux qos" will give you reference material.

Hello List,

I am trying to install Ubuntu 9.10
(http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases/karmic/release/ubuntu-9.10-alternate-powerpc.iso)
on IBM eServer System p5.

I get a boot prompt where I enter
"expert install video=ofonly"

It loads kernel then ELF and then I get a b/w screen saying,

and then system freezes.

Same is the case with Debian Testing

What can be the solution for this problem?

Hi,

I will be conducting an introductory workshop on GNU autotools in
#fedora-classroom on 03 May, 2010 at 13:30 UTC. The aim of the
classroom is to get people started on autotoolizing C code. I will use
an example project and will go through the following:

* Downloading the sample application
* Creating files for the application
  => configure.ac
     -> Initialization
     -> Checks
     -> Output
  => Makefile.am
     -> Build programs
     -> Install additional files
* Generating scripts

Prerequisites for those wanting to attend this:

* Familiarity with make, gcc
* Ensure that autoconf, automake, gcc, make, etc. are installed on your system.
  `yum groupinstall "Development Tools"` ought to get all of it

The session will not be covering autoheader and libtool since:
* The sample I'm using  does not need it
* Those concepts are slightly more advanced and may require more time

In other words, the session is for people who have never worked with
autotools before.

Message-ID: <z2pa8e2ecc11004262114k7b561b1bwee94ad0e08a3ab7d@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi,

Documentation on sudoers file states the below:

jack           CSNETS = ALL

The user *jack* may run any command *on* the machines in the *CSNETS* alias
(the networks 128.138.243.0, 128.138.204.0, and 128.138.242.0). Of those
networks, only 128.138.204.0 has an explicit netmask (in CIDR notation)
indicating it is a class C network. For the other networks in *CSNETS*, the
local machine's netmask will be used during matching.

My question is that, how would the systems on those networks know that they
have to use the configs mentioned on one specific system. Does it mean that
the user (jack) can run any commands *from* systems on mentioned networks *
on* the system with the sudoers file?

 Hi,

I am trying to make sure that the users can access/mount a specific device

the below steps. Please guide me as to what I did wrong.

1.                      vi /etc/security/console.perms

# /etc/security/console.perms
#
# This file determines the permissions that will be given to priviledged
# users of the console at login time, and the permissions to which to
# revert when the users log out.
# format is:
#   <class>=list of regexps specifying consoles or globs specifying files
#   file-glob|<class> perm dev-regex|<dev-class> \
#     revert-mode revert-owner[.revert-group]
# the revert-mode, revert-owner, and revert-group are optional, and default
# to 0600, root, and root, respectively.
#
# For more information:
# man 5 console.perms
#
# This file should not be modified.
# Rather a new file in the console.perms.d directory should be created.
# file classes -- these are regular expressions
<console>=tty[0-9][0-9]* vc/[0-9][0-9]* :[0-9]+\.[0-9]+ :[0-9]+

*<ptconsole>=pts/2*

# device classes -- see console.perms.d/50-default.perms
# permission definitions -- see console.perms.d/50-default.perms


2.                vi /etc/security/console.perms.d/51-default.perms

"I have 37 LDAP servers made by all major vendors, like AD, ITDS, Sun ONE,

Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant of Sophos, has responded to my
blog asking not to use word hackers for criminals. What is your opinion?

"Uh-oh. I've really annoyed Swapnil Bhartiya.

He's written a blog
post<http://www.katonda.com/blog/1090/sophos-thinks-windows-computers-hackers-are-criminals>
at
Katonda which, amongst other things, takes me to task for referring to
cybercriminals as "hackers".

Bhartiva's complaint is one that many in the IT field share - that the media
has taken the word "hacker", which used to mean simply someone who was a
computer enthusiast, and now use it to mean someone who breaks into computer
systems, writes malware or causes other forms of online mischief.
I have some sympathy with Bhartiva's pedantry (after all, I'm the chap who
blogged at length about how we should all say "Trojan horses" rather than
"Trojans"<http://www.sophos.com/blogs/gc/g/2008/07/17/is-it-a-trojan-or-a-trojan-horse/>),
but he and other zealots for the preservation of the older definition of the
word "hacker" are missing one fact."

IMO, the right word is cracker. 

Checkout http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1392.html

<snip>

hacker
      A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the
      internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in
      particular.  The term is often misused in a pejorative context,
      where "cracker" would be the correct term.  See also: cracker.

Subject: [Ilugc] PXE Boot installation of Debian Lenny throwing up "Bad
 archive mirror" error
Message-ID: <4BD6ADC7.3010903@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to configure a PXE boot installation of Debian Lenny for
which I have set up pxelinux, downloaded the net install images setup
tftp and dhcp server. The PXE boot happens properly and the installation
starts successfully. In the 'choose the mirror of the Debian archive
step', I have mounted the debian first CD iso image in Apache's document
root in the folder named 'debian' but I get this error "Bad archive
mirror - The specified Debian archive mirror is either not available or
does not have a valid Release file on it. Please try a different
mirror". The net install and the cd image are same releases - debian
504. It is not possible for me to point to an internet mirror and do the
installation. How do I debug such a situation and find out what is
wrong? The NIC is detected, IP address is assigned through DHCP.

Thank you.

Message-ID: <p2q233257431004270604xc84b105fme6c2deb291c840cd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have installed nfs server on centos-5.3 and exported "/usr/share/abcd"
directory on x.x.x.x machine. I added firewall rules for nfs. So no problem
from firewall.

I want to automate the nfs mounting. So I have installed autofs on another
client running centos-5.3  and configured autofs for auto mounting as
follows.

-----------------------------------------------------
*root@y.y.y.y*$ cat /etc/auto.master
/mnt /etc/auto.nfs
*
root@y.y.y.y*$ cat /etc/auto.nfs
test     -fstype=nfs,soft,intr    x.x.x.x:/usr/share/abcd

*root@y.y.y.y*$ cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
automount: files nis

*root@y.y.y.y*$ service autofs restart
-----------------------------------------------------
service is restarted, But i do not see anything mounted on "/mnt" or
"/mnt/test" directory.

Now i tried manual mounting. Its mounted successfully.
*root@y.y.y.y*$ mount -t nfs x.x.x.x:/usr/share/abcd /mnt

Before posting my query, i done so many search and testing, nothing worked.
Please tell me where is the problem. What am i missing inorder to acheive
automount ??

IIRC, you need to mirror the debian-installer section as well to be able

from /var/log/*.

Autofs will only mount directories when "accessed".  Often a
"cd /mnt/test" is needed before /mnt/test will get auto mounted
from the server.

I googled for the same and I couldn't find anything coherent along the
lines I was trying. I was assuming that since I could install from
debian CD, mounting the iso image and serving it through apache was
enough for the installation after booting from PXE using the
net-install images.

mountpoint "/mnt" is specified in "/etc/auto.master" config file. and "test"
is specified in "/etc/auto.nfs" file. I thought that "test" directory will
be created at mount time

otherwise Give me clear configs for "autofs" setup.

I struggled a lot.

You could look at access_log and see what's missing. That "Release file

What type of modem is this -- wireless LAN/broadband?  What steps
have you done before declaring that you're unable to connect, and
what errors are you getting?

So many questions. Only one answer.

Use http://liveusb-openbsd.sf.net

Or if you wish to have linux there are many alternatives.

www.slax.org

or www.pentoo.org

You sure can use 8GB. ;)

I have never used 8 GB pendrives though.

Best of luck!

Friends,

I have a problem while setting up mailserver using Postfix,Dovecot,MySQL in
Ubuntu 9.10.

I followed the link http://workaround.org/ispmail/lenny

The actual problem is
1) After i restart dovecot the /var/log/mail.log file shows message as
follows:

Apr 28 10:24:09 catfoss dovecot: Killed with signal 15
Apr 28 10:24:09 catfoss dovecot: dovecot v1.1.11 starting up (core dumps
disabled)
Apr 28 10:24:09 catfoss dovecot: auth-worker(default): mysql: Connected to
127.0.0.1 (mailserver)

2) After sending mail using telnet there is no change in the
/var/log/mail.log file

Give me suggestions

Sure, there are many distros that are releasing USB image or tools to
convert LiveCD/DVD iso images to Live USB versions.

I am guessing you want to *install* CentOS on a pen drive and not make
a Live USB image (from a Live CD iso file).

Take a look at this link
<http://www.pendrivelinux.com/usb-centos-5-live-install-via-windows/>
if you want to convert a Live CD to a Live USB image.

If you want to install the OS on the pendrive, then you can boot from
the install CD and instead of selecting the hard disk (typically
/dev/sda), you can point to the pen drive disk for example, with one
hard disk on your system, your pendrive will show up as /dev/sdb.
Make sure that the grub menu points to the correct device name i.e.
the pendrive device.  Warning, do not create swap partition on a
pendrive.

The installer must have created an ext3 or ext4 file system which is
not a "native" FS for XP.

> So that 2 gb pen drive is not in use.

You can always reformat it.

The problem is after sending the mail, log file should be

..., status=sent (delivered via dovecot service)
postfix/qmgr[...]: 5FF712A6: removed
postfix/smtpd[...]: disconnect from localhost[127.0.0.1]

but i am getting log file as:

I added the option 'debian-installer/allow_unauthenticated=true' to the

available, or does not have a valid Release file on it. Please try a

Let's separate the problem, to set the base clear (a) postfix does
SMTP and (b) dovecot does POP3 and IMAP.  Both are unrelated vis-a-vis
their respective functionality.

>From your subject line the problem is with your postfix setup.
Therefore showing logs about dovecot is does not throw any light on
your postfix problem.

Suggest you read through some of the stuff here
<http://www.postfix.org/DEBUG_README.html> if you have not done so
already.  Suggest that you increase debug verbosity such that postfix
logs debug data.

If this is an academic/R&D type exercise and you are using example.com
as your test domain, then I suggest that you set up a "local" DNS
server with a MX, NS, A, and PTR records pointing to "localhost" to
completely resolve *all* records for example.com *within* your box.

rsync along with scheduling as cron job can accomplish what you want.
Rsync and crond are available in every linux distribution. Read up on
rsync and cron to get the syntax you want.

In addition to the other suggestions, also try rdiff-backup.

It provides snapshot like incremental backups to disk.

DVD and tapes are passe I think.

Tapes can carry a lot of data but is very slow and optical media are
very unreliable and get destroyed
very easily.

Remote network backup seems like the best bet.

If your data volume is low rsnapshot is good. Or rdiff-backup.

Dear Friends,

I'am using Fedora 12 in my labs and the monitor is Samsung 17inch TFT .
I have found the default font size in CLI to be very small. How to increase its font size?
In GUI mode, terminal's font size can be increased with CTRL+SHIFT++

In Fedora 10, I faced same problem, which i solved by adding vga=784( i dont remember the exact no.) in the grub.conf file.

Kindly suggest remedial measures.

Thanks in advance.

I have setup the system ip which was given by them, as well as dns and

They have provided extra six static ipaddress. When I do ping or ssh it

Please help how do that? Really I don't know how to do this. Please any

This is the "peer" gateway on the reliance end of your leased line.
In such setups it is useful to have reports from ipcalc or sipcalc
(see below)  to remove any doubts while doing the setup/config.

How have you tested your connection?  Can you ping any 8.8.8.8 on the
'Net?  Can you ping www.google.com?

Not sure what you mean by above.  Have you assigned the 6 IPs to
different machines on the LAN side of your network?  if you really
want to test connectivity to the IP numbers you need to do it from a
system which is *not* in your LAN.

You also need to enable IP forwarding
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/forwarding

Given that your LAN IP's are 'Net visible ensure due diligence
regarding security on each system.

So far so good. Assign the System IP to your machine that connects to
the upstream router/gateway 115.248.76.26.

Since both are in the same network you can use the machine as
gateway.

Remember, you can only use machines in the same network as
gateway.

So if 115.248.76.26 is to act as gateway for 115.248.76.25 then
you have to check the netmask to see if both fall in same network.

Good. Both are in the same network.

Go ahead and use it. You can also use DNS servers or run your own
BIND like I do nowadays.

I don't understand this at all. These are not LAN(RFC1918) IPs.

LAN IPs are private IPs that are either 192.168/16 or 172.16/12 or 10/8.

Try pinging the gateway after assigning the IP address.

What?

I can see the six LAN IPs you mention. But they cannot be used since
they lie on a different network. Look at this.

Probably they meant that you use these IPs elsewhere. Then they
did not give any gateway.

I am lost here.

I'm hazarding a guess here.

What I think the OP means is that Reliance is routing 2 subnets
115.248.76.24/30 and 115.248.77.48/29 to this link. If this is so, the WAN
link must have one IP address in each of these subnets.

Like the case below, a similar set needs to be set for the second subnet
Wan IP: 115.248.76.24/30 and 115.248.77.48/29
System IP: 115.248.76.25 and 115.248.77.49 (example)
Netmask : 255.255.255.252 and 255.255.255.248
Gateway: 115.248.76.26 and 115.248.77.<gwip last octet> (to be given by
Reliance).

Once this is done, set up DNAT for the available 4 IPs in the
115.248.77.48/29 subnet to internal systems. Like some one pointed out,
mapping external IPs to internal LAN IPs means these internal systems need
to be fortified well. Please be careful. One good option will be to
expose/install only secure services and maintain strict vigil.

Please paste here the error message you get while giving the mount command.
using the error message, we can track down the issue.

Not necessarily.  Agree with your comment in today's time frame but
one can use "Public IPs" on the LAN.  Although it would be waste of
valuable resource.   Companies had to buy block of IPs pre RFC 1918.

> I can see the six LAN IPs you mention. But they cannot be used since

Not true -- OP needs to install a router with 2 NICs, one for the LAN
115.248.77.48/29 subnet and one for the WAN subnet 115.248.76.24/30.
The router can be a Linux box or an embedded appliance.  The ISP, in
it's cloud, has routing entries to subnet 115.248.77.48/29 behind gw
115.248.76.25 or something similar.  It does not matter as long
packets leave and arrive w/o the OP having to go through the hoop.

IMHO, the OP is unable to articulate what he wants to do with the
bunch of IPs that he has got and needs to consult a professional
network engineer.   IMO, network setup should be presented in a visual
form rather than in words but unfortunately very few people do.

I am hazarding a guess as to what his company wants to do.  They
probably want to run a few servers with the public IPs in the
115.248.77.48/29 subnet, with one IP  to be used by the GW to it's
corporate LAN with RFC 1918 IP numbering scheme behind this gateway
like so:

                                       ISP

Hi,

The most probable reason is you don't have ntfs-3g driver installed. See if
it is the case. And please paste the error message here.

Dear Guyz,

As of now, i see fossjobs.in grows thick and fast. kudos to the maintainers.
a small suggestion, if the job listing is separated by two heads like
1)those jobs posted by companies and 2)jobs posted by man power consultants
will be great.

In my opinion this will serve 2 purpose.

1) Clear distinction between the real companies and manpower agents
2) To avail statistical feature on a company/job versus applicants

Add your thoughts,

Cheers,

Hello Arun Khan,

Thanks for your reply. I am new new to linux.

Without Swap Partition OS Works all functions?

and also I want to use NETBEANS IDE, without swamp partition 

it is possible, what is the use of swap partition?

Thanking in advance.

Sure, there are many distros that are releasing USB image or tools to

convert LiveCD/DVD iso images to Live USB versions.

I am guessing you want to *install* CentOS on a pen drive and not make

a Live USB image (from a Live CD iso file).



Take a look at this link



if you want to convert a Live CD to a Live USB image.



If you want to install the OS on the pendrive, then you can boot from

the install CD and instead of selecting the hard disk (typically

/dev/sda), you can point to the pen drive disk for example, with one

hard disk on your system, your pendrive will show up as /dev/sdb.

Make sure that the grub menu points to the correct device name i.e.

the pendrive device. Warning, do not create swap partition on a

pendrive.

The installer must have created an ext3 or ext4 file system which is

not a "native" FS for XP.



> So that 2 gb pen drive is not in use.



You can always reformat it.
