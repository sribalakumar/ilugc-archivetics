Please do prior research on the internet by searching on your
favourite search engine before asking questions on the mailing list.
As for your question,
here is the answer - http://lmgtfy.com/?q=openstack+ubuntu+12.04. You
might want to refer to the links from the official docs.openstack.org
website.

Yes it is enough.
But, the last release was in 2011.

Have you considered Web2Py (http://www.web2py.com/)
If you have HTML5/CSS/Javascript knowledge, this is brilliant. We are using
it in production.
Python back end code with Javascript/HTML/CSS front end. Also a fully MVC
architecture.

Bar code reader does not require any special treatment.
Almost all bar code readers work like a keyboard. They scan the code and
send it as key codes. The end user just places the cursor on the required
field and presses the scan button. The scanner will send key strokes to the
computer and the value will just appear on the field.

Arun

As ILUGC have grown much, we should have more patience to answer the new
comer/learner/fresher.
The audience who reads your mail gets impression that,  this forum is only
for experts. And people may hesitate to raise a query in this forum.

The another perspective is,
If you google it, you can get 100s of pages(out of it 80+ pages are not
relevant info). But only experienced people(who works on this ) can
suggest  or guide the good one.

This mail is not intent to hurt you. Just  sharing my thoughts.

Thanks
suresh.

We are very tolerant and patient with the newbie posters on this list
these days. In addition to providing answers and solutions to the
posters, we also try
to educate them on the mailing list etiquette so that they will do
prior research and work before asking questions on this list instead
of treating this list as a free
technical support forum, which it is not. Most of the long-time
subscribers on this list are people who are interested in GNU/Linux,
Free(dom) software and the associated
ecosystem and want to share their knowledge and at the same time learn
from each other. There is a very good reason why "How to ask questions
the smart way" (http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by
ESR is often
recommended on mailing lists like this to newbie members.

"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and
you feed him for a lifetime" goes a very old and popular saying which
is very relevant here. I know that searching on your favourite search
engine (say Google) can be a daunting task with 100s of pages of
results. Knowing that, though people rarely navigate beyond the first
few pages, I had pointed out the official documentation
docs.openstack.org (which happen to be within the first few results on
the first page) to the OP to help him narrow his search scope. Shrini
had suggested devstack.org which is primarily for setting up OpenStack
development environments. OP had not stated what is his purpose of
setting up OpenStack - whether for hacking on the OpenStack code, in
which case devstack.org would be a good place to start or to setup an
OpenStack production environment, for which the docs.openstack.org
links would be the best place to start.

> This mail is not intent to hurt you. Just  sharing my thoughts.

No offense taken. I stand by what I did to help the OP and at the same
time educate him. So no problem :-)

      If you had pasted the very same questions in your search engine,
you would have got the results below. I would like to reiterate that
ilugc is not a "free technical support" group. It is a group that will
guide when you are stuck in your efforts to use free software. Which
means, you have already taken some effort/steps and you are not able
to solve your problem with those steps/effort.

     Also, finding answers to our problems using search engines is a
good skill to have. It will definitely help us. Thanks

some logical thinking.

The guy who ask about openstack, and knows ilugc.  definitely he would know
how to search in search engine.

There are Two possible reason of that mail.
1) Just throw the ball. (heard about the term somewhere and throw the ball)
2) he failed on the openstak installation. he wants some light to move on.
    In this case, he doesnt know how to frame the direct question?

Thanks

Microsoft(NASDAQ:MSFT) <http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/default.aspx> has 
revealed the results of a startling study of the banking sector in India 
today.?  Conducted by Ascentius Consulting, the study has revealed that 
some 34,115 Indian PSU bank branches are at risk due to their reliance 
on Windows XP. Windows XP will no longer be supported by Microsoft 
beginning April 08, 2014 
<http://www.microsoft.com/india/msindia/pressreleases/banks-in-india-could-be-at-major-risk-with-only-100-workings-days-left-for-windows-xp-end-of-support/512/>, 
but the study shows that the penetration of Windows XP is still high 
at 40???70% in the banking sector.

Amongst the greatest risks facing banks that maintain their Windows XP 
installations, despite the end of support, are their ability to respond 
to customers and manage waiting times.? Besides, there are several IT 
risks that will require extensive effort to manage. In the light of 
these, CERT-IN has also come out with an advisory recommending immediate 
migration.

We have been advising our customers to move off Windows XP for a long 
time now. There are a significant number of PCs out there that still 
need to be moved as per a plan. The move to a modern OS like Windows 8.1 
will not only alleviate the risks for users and businesses but will also 
open up opportunities posed by modern technology, like the cloud, for 
them, said Amrish Goyal, General Manager, Windows Business Group, 
Microsoft Corporation (India) Pvt. Ltd. 
<http://www.varindia.com/Krrish-3-Game-comes-exclusive-on-Windows-Platform.htm>

According to the most recent Security Intelligence Report by Microsoft, 
Windows XP users are six times more likely to be infected than users of 
modern operating systems like Windows 8.1, despite encountering the same 
amount of threats. Windows XP users are also twenty-one times more 
vulnerable.

guru

Is there some kind of insurance against losses that incur from new
technology adoption? Does that cover linux?

Turning the question around - are the banks insured against losses arising
from bugs/malfunction of their software? Or is it a risk vs reward balance
for them in adopting new technology?

Where there is more market share for Windows (say pirated), there is
more market for Free software also (say GNU/Linux).

For them it's easy to make handsome bucks by providing pirated
solutions than giving customized solutions.

If there are hundreds of ways out there to make money from proprietary

What kind of services you are planning to provide for your customers.
You have to be more specific about, how you have prepared yourself for
serving your customers.

Recently I had pointed out an instance where my passbook balance had
shrunk by 5000 after I withdrew 600. The Branch manager had no clue
whom to contact. eventually they got sorted it though. basically it
was not printing few lines.

Linux may be found in some of the core DB Backends.

But smaller banks heavily rely on Windows.

Actually many banks have no clue regarding program / data insurance.
They leave it to their vendors.

Mostly, yes.

Anyways, RBI is evelving many best practices guides in this regards.

In any case I am not in touch with this topic for over 11 months or
so. (The report was submitted last Holi)

I am sure there are at least a few ILUGC members who do freelancing work
or run a sole proprietorship firm.

How do you pay taxes on the income from the freelancing/company? Is it just
like paying taxes for the individual?

For freelancing you should pay income tax as it is an income. Don't
know about sole proprietorship firm.

Thanks Prasanna, do you know how freelancers declare business expenses
for claiming tax deductions? Should the proof copies be sent along with the
ITR-V form.

You can declare business expenses like travel, phone, mobile, internet,
hotel, salaries to assistants, office rental, power consumption etc. You do
not have to send the bills but you have to keep them in case they come
calling.

And you should be paying advance tax on sep 15, dec 15 and march 15.

Its easier to do it through an auditor and I think if the income is above
10 lakhs you have to have your accounts audited even if you are an
individual!

If your billing is in INR and if it exceeds 10 lakhs per annum, then you
have to register for and pay service tax. Not necessary if its in forex.

Hope than helps.

Regds,
mano

Not sure what you mean by the last line. So if you received in forex, then
no need of ST?

Apparently, yes. If you are a registered company and want to have the
service tax on forex earnings waived, you have to get some exporter code or
something. But if you are an individual then nothing needs to be done. At
least thats what my auditor tells me! Would like to hear a second opinion
on this :-)

No second opinion - I think this is absolutely right. The thumb rule is
"Tax services and not exports". I do this too - my indian customers have to
pay an ST, while my foreign customers dont have to. I still bill in INR,
but the origin account is a non-INR.

More importantly, the service has to qualify as  'export' - so, pl. ask
your auditor whether your service qualifies.

Madan

So an individual doesn't have to pay Service tax on software exports even
if he doesn't have an IEC code?

I am supporting for a New Zealand client and I receive the payment from
nzforex.co.nz to my indian bank account. Should I have to pay IT or is
there an exception?

Thanks

No - IIUC, what is important is
1. The nature of the work - does it really classify as export
2. The source of the funds - is it a non INR account. PayPal is only an
intermediary

(I would love to hear other opinions - am only sharing what I know and

Like Madan said, You have to pay income tax if you earn money in India. It
is a legal requirement

Export earnings as professional fees have some IT rebates which gives one
greater tax savings than India revenues.

Christopher,

We welcome the good discussions here.

It is completely ok to agree or disagree on any discussion.

But, mind the words in the public mailing lists like ours.

You may be living in any english country or seeing loads of english
movies daily.
But this is not the place to practise those bad english words.

Please use gentle words and keep the discussions healthy.

AFAIK, there are no rebates except for the service tax waiver.

Whatever's posted here is mostly conjecture. So people with taxable income
are best advised to seek an auditors help. Saves a ton of work and stress.

I agree with stress and related advise from a professional. What I said was
not conjecture though. In 2002-03, I got  50 percent rebate under 80HHE. I
do not know what is allowed today.

Hi,

Was wondering if there any open source projects whose bug database can be
accessed (i.e, read-only)?

yes , pick any of the projects from Github or other public repos there
issues/bugs are readable , also you can check
https://openhatch.org/search/where they list bugs from various open
source projects .

still it would help if you can explain briefly what you want to achieve.

Well, I do not want the webaccess, i.e, I do not want to browse;
but the database schema access.

I want to check out a few trends and do some analysis.

Not a rest api, but the connect string of the database :)

Looking for something like the database that connects to Bugzilla.

Michael Hoye (mhoye AT mozilla dot com) provides a dump of the Mozilla
Bugzilla database. The temporary location from where you can download
the same is at:

  http://people.mozilla.org/~mhoye/bugzilla/

It is a sanitized version after removing sensitive information. He
provides a new dump (not incremental) every quarter.

You can file a bug at Bugzilla.mozilla.org in the "administration"
category regarding request for latest dumps, and you will be notified
of the same.

I am not sure if they have found a permanent storage location yet. You
can write to him if you need any specific information.

HTH,

SK

 8th, 2014 in Academic Institutions
Message-ID: <CACtiFJaY_fGovKy4Wx5iWpuNCaGSr6aQ28k-iJsSUhYZT0yH2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

The Engineering colleges in Tamilnadu have started moving from
Proprietary operating system to GNU/Linux operating system.

We have setup Fedora-20 based Open source lab in more than 15+
engineering colleges after its final release on December 17, 2013.
The latest version of Fedora has attracted many of the colleges
towards GNU/Linux platform and most colleges have decided to migrate
atleast 50% of computers using Linux in all departments (one of the
engineering college located within Chennai city has already migrated
10% of computers completely to Fedora-20 and would switch another 40%
by the end of March ' 2014).

After interacting with several engineering college management
authorities, I found that, the colleges were no more interested in
paying for software license for proprietary software and therefore
decided to migrate to Linux platform and train all the faculty members
for using them.

Hence, based on the feedback and response we got from colleges, we
have decided to setup more than 100+ FOSS Labs on April 8th, 2014.

We are looking for volunteers support who can support this initiative.
 Any monetary benefits we receive from colleges would be shared with
the volunteers.

I am ready to offer FREE training / resources for the volunteers who
wish to support this initiative.

Would like to hear your thoughts / ideas.

Baskar: Congratulations; this is a wonderful initiative from your side.

I have a thinking: Please go thru and send me your views:

Can you draw up a user manual or tutorial so that the College can do thi migration by themselves? If so, we can make it a co-ordinated event and get publicity also.

The migration process has to be done by college only.  The volunteers
will help in setting up a FOSS Resource centre using Fedora-20 /
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with complete repository in the colleges on that day
and will offer training for the technical assistants and system
administrators in setting up the lab.  (The whole objective of this
program is doing on that specific date)

The volunteer should have Laptop and Raspberry Pi (or) BeagleBone
Black (these are used for automated deployment using PXE) for setting
up the FOSS resource centre / lab.

Regarding user manual/tutorial, if someone could help me, I can
prepare a short tutorial for doing the above.

I am not a software - coder - person.

I am willing to help in any way - NO COMMERCIALS at all.

I am at chennai - loving to use UBUNTU - from 9.04 onwards - still using
10.04 (just because of Gnome 2.0)

you can use me in any way - for Linux Propagation, etc.

In the meanwhile - KV-IIT may want to have some courses - for 10 / 11 / 12
- basically either Python / Ruby or equivalent.

If any one is interested let us provide that too.

with warm regards

Hi,


I am new to yocto and trying to build a package for raspberry pi.
I am using the BSP layer from https://github.com/djwillis/meta-raspberrypi.

Am able to build the image using BSP without any problem. But when I
added a new layer to add packages, am getting error.

I tried testing with the hello world auto tooled package. This hello
world is the hello world autotooled package downloaded from
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.7.tar.gz.  When trying
to execute that bb, am getting the error as follows,

| make: *** No rule to make target `install'.  Stop.
| ERROR: oe_runmake failed


My bb file is as follows,

DESCRIPTION = "Dummy"
SECTION = "package"
LICENSE = "CLOSED"
PR = "r0"
SRC_URI = "file://hello/"
inherit autotools gettext

After executing this bb file, i took a look at the logs of configure.
It says nothing to configure.


Please help me with what's wrong with this process am following?

Join us by editing as many articles as possible during these the days.
We want to cover all of them. Apart from creating articles, you could
also help us by correcting or expanding existing ones. Adding names to
the existing list of parliamentarians would go a long way too.


Find more details about the event here. Please add your name as a
participant and feel free to start editing over a cup of coffee :-)


A second edit-a-thon on Indian women scientists is scheduled for the
15th and 16th of March,. Sign up for this event on the event page in
advance here!


There is an opt in we would like you to fill up so that we can
understand editor behaviour better. Please fill up this form if you
are participating in the edit-a-thons.


In case you have questions, do write to Netha, Parul or Jeph!

Base URL is defined in application/config/config.php. Why do you want
to change it? From version 2.1 onwards it's auto detected and that
should work well.
That said, here's the base_url I use in my applications and it is
portable to any hostname without fiddling with config files.
$config['base_url']     = ((isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) &&
$_SERVER['HTTPS'] == "on") ? "https" : "http");
$config['base_url'] .= "://".$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
$config['base_url'] .=
str_replace(basename($_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']),"",$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']);

You may get some rule of thumb practiced by fellow free lancers here.
 Different rules apply as to how you are doing business - sole
proprietorship, partnership, LLC, Pvt. Ltd.  etc.

Seriously, you should retain a CA who is conversant with taxation on
local IN / foreign earnings etc.  S/he will also advise you what /
when to file.  S/he should also do your tax returns and answer all
questions to the auditor.

You need to provide some basic info on your setup and apache logs
before anybody can help. Right now it can just be wild guess work.

You have missed out a large part of computer science and electronics.
Seriously consider learning C programming. You will be able to
understand how a computer works and can write efficient code.

Yes, you're right. Market is too big for everyone. But we have to hit at
the exact point to be a successful entrepreneur. And as of now I am not
able to locate that point where should I hit.

What you have tried to do for colleges/universities and what kind of

I visited my university and talked to few teachers and students regarding
Open Source Training programs but they are not interested in any such
programs. They simply said that they are too occupied with loads of work
and when teachers shows lack of interest then what can we expect from
students. Majority of students only study to pass the exams (while being in
student life or till they realize the importance of being versatile).

Yes, there are but how to find those ways or generate those ways? Could you
please elaborate few ways or solutions on which new and young entrepreneurs
can work upon?

What kind of services you are planning to provide for your customers.
> You have to be more specific about, how you have prepared yourself for

As of now, I am not going very vast in my services. I have few services
like using Open Source OS and Apps for day to day computing, office works.
For students like: Client-Server Communication using Open Source OS,
Networking, Automation of day to day tasks using python, ruby as PL's,
Compilation process of Linux Kernel from its source code etc.
Usually what I have seen so far is that students only study what they have
in their syllabus and Linux or Open Source Technologies are not in their
curriculum so there should not be any inclination from students perspective.

Majority of students are working on Java, .NET, PHP for their final
semesters projects and few upcoming engineers don't even know how to host a
website or what steps should one to follow to host their website (they are
working on a website using PHP as PL). Students don't know even about
Github and how to host your code on it. Because, teachers who are teaching
them too don't know about it.

In short, I want to open and run my own computer academy which will use,
give training and provide solutions entirely in and using Open Source
technologies. This is what I have all in my mind as of now.

I hope I made my points very clear.
Kindly throw some light on the same from your vast experience so that all
can get benefit from it.
Please ignore grammatical mistakes and typos if any.
Thank you.

 This is the right method Or try the below.

$root = "http://".$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
$root .=
str_replace(basename($_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']),"",$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']);

$config['base_url']    = "$root";

If CSS or JS or not loading please do check firebug for the url getting
loaded for the files.

say for examples, if css and js are present in $CI_root/includes/css and
$CI_root/includes/js then the url construct for them will be like below.

<link src="<?php echo base_url() ?>"includes/css/style.css" />

Just Launched
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.smc.inputmethod.indic


Indic keyboard is a native free and open source Indian language input
keyboard application for Android mobile devices. At present supporting
almost 15 Indic languages, this application uses fonts in Android system in
both direct input (characters mapped to keys) and transliteration. Though
support for Indian languages was already available in some phones, Android
officially started support with Jelly bean (4.1) version.

Users can directly type in their native language to any app installed in
their phone. An installation wizard is included with the app to ease the
setup process. Any novice user can install and setup the app for their
language easily.
This app extends Android?s default keyboard and adds support for languages
such as Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi,
Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sinhalese, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu. The app
supports any device which has Android 4.1 and above installed. Most of the
supported languages have 3 layouts - phonetic, inscript and
transliteration.Do note that font support for all languages may not be
available in all makes and models.

This keyboard requires Android 4.1+, and is developed by Jishnu Mohan of
Swathanthra Malayalam Computing?  with the support of DIT R & D Project
undertaken by ICFOSS, Govt. of Kerala.

Source code is available at https://github.com/smc/Indic-Keyboard

The keyboard will work with all AOSP variants like cynogenmod, replicant
etc

We will soon publish apk  in f-droid too

The instructions in website should be clear. You have not sent a plain

Dear sir,?
Both Linux deploy and Unix installer failed to install unix in my android 2.3.4 tablet (1 GB RAM, A9 Cortex processor, 16 GB Micro sd card). Especially i get the error message 'failed to connect SSH and VNC'. When i tried to connect VNC, the error message reads ' Permision refued'.?
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? I have, however, installed upbuntu in my Destop. Unless i am able to install Libre office in my tablet, it is of little use for me. Is there any way to install libre ofice in android tablet. Pl. guide me in this regard.

Subject: [Ilugc] Looking for sound files for Tamil TTS
Message-ID: <CAND2794KiCF-Cz0sTS82yDJHE0+ntBznaN4YAgiCsBajkwPCtg@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to create an open source tamil Text to Speech Engine.


https://github.com/arcturusannamalai/open-tamil/

Using the above open-tamil library, I can split tamil words into letters.

========

cat letter.py

import tamil.utf8 as utf8

letters = utf8.get_letters(u"??????? ?????? ???? ????")

for letter in letters:
        print letter


==========



python letter.py
??
??
?
??

?
??
?
??

?
??
?
??
??



---------



I can split the tamil words into letters using open-tamil.

Now, looking for sound files with the sounds of all tamil letters.
So that we can map the text to sound files.


Do we have such collection online?


Thanks.

The sound symbols is decided based on how a langauge is spoken. In
Dhvani the logic is available in src/phonetic_synthesizer_ta.c C file.
The C file has logic to get the sound db file names also. Database is
availble in separate folder. Please have a look at it. I will need
some time to understand the logic. I did not spend time in that part
as I need to know how a language (tamil) is spoken.

Thanks and Regards,
PrasannaKumar

To: mailinglist at fsftn.org


On International Women's Day (March 8), a Wikipedia Workshop for Women was
conducted at College of Engineering, Guindy, (CEG) Anna University. It was
jointly organized by Free Software Foundation, Tamil Nadu (FSFTN) and CEG's
GNU/Linux Users Group (CEGLUG).
Conducted as an all-girls workshop, the workshop was attended by 40
students from the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and
Information Science and Technology (IST).
The one day workshop was aimed at encouraging women to contribute to
Wikipedia and thereby reducing the current gender bias.
The participants were not only taught how to contribute to Wikipedia but
also about the importance of their contributions and how they can make a
difference.

The session was handled by Mr. Sibi from Free Software Foundation, Tamil
Nadu. At the end of the session, the participants were encouraged to start
contributing to Wikipedia as well as its sister projects. The feedback
collected showed positive response and a few had requested for follow up
sessions.

I am very amazed and sad to see the response of ILUG-C members regarding
this topic. Only 3 people showed interest and took time from their busy
schedule to write a reply and shared their experiences (in whatever way).
Where are other experienced members? If young and new Open Source
supporters will not get any mentor-ship and guideline then who will guide
them?
It's really a serious question.
Thank you.

The number of people who do business is less. In that people who do
business in technology side is less. Among that people who do business
with open source software is very less. In that small group people
being in ILUGC is difficult in my opinion.

The main theme of open source is contributing to society and along
with the myths of money and open source are not related etc etc we
have very less people doing business with open source.

Hope this helps,

Subject: [Ilugc] "Recursive entry to debugger" panic seen with KGDB (PowerPC)
Message-ID: <CAFE+A7mUSpLp3v2oD6qrvr3z6XQdFO9SBRGvw1y6M_phYYcM0w@mail.gmail.com>

I am using Linux Kernel Version 2.6.34.6 SMP for powerPC 64 bit. I tried to
debug kernel using KGDB and ended up in Kernel panic reboot issue. Here is
the list of steps I did.

1) I enabled the following in the config file

CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y
CONFIG_KGDB=y
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER=y
CONFIG_KGDB_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y

Built and loaded the Kernel.

2) My Linux PC is connected terminal server using ttyS0 and I enabled KGDB
over serial port by doing

"echo ttyS0 > /sys/module/kgdboc/parameters/kgdboc"

3) Trigger KGDB by issuing sysrq-g. echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger

4) Kernel Panic reboot is seen with the following reboot log

sw0:root> echo ttyS0 > /sys/module/kgdboc/parameters/kgdboc
kgdb: Registered I/O driver kgdboc.
sw0:root> echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger

Hi,

I am using Linux Kernel Version 2.6.34.6 with powerPC. I knew that KDB was
merged with Kernel mainline 2.6.35. Hence I need to apply KDB patch with my

But I couldn't find any patch for powerPC in the following place

Can you help me to get patch for powerpc?

This is what is expected I guess. With "echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger"
you are triggering a kernel panic. You should have connected the
target to gdb before a kernel panic. Try connecting the target to gdb
and then trigger kernel panic.

Hope this helps,

Prasanna,

According to the documentation given by official KGDB, I have been asked to
try connect KGDB only after triggering.

https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/kgdb/EnableKGDB.html

Once the trigger is done, it is supposed to hang and I need to connect. But
in my case it reboots.

I also tried connecting before triggering KGDB, but connection failed
because there was no KGDB hang in other side

*GDB Log*

Then tried triggering KGDB, it failed with same reboot.

Correct me if I am wrong.

I have debugged linux kernel over ethernet. Thought it would be
similar. Debugging over ethernet is faster but required an out of tree
patch (when I used it).

Generally it is easier to go through the code and fix issues if any.
Even Linus prefers this instead of debugging a kernel.

Thanks,
PrasannaKumar

Can you forward the steps to debug over ethernet? I hope in this case also,
we will end up in doing triggering which will reboot. Isn't it? Please also
mention about the patch.

Can anyone please let me know where can I get the latest stable version of Linux Kernel source code tree and what are the steps to compile. I however want to use its image to boot thru qemu emulator rather than installing it. How can we set various config params values like - CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO

How can we set various kernel configuration based on a working distro kernel configuration and enable kgdb related params while building. How can we can attach kgdb to kernel at its boot up time?

Hope https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jwessel/kgdb/ch03s04.html
will help. Please google for the kgdboe patch. I am not sure whether
it got merged with the mainline kernel already.

Note: I have tried this only with x86. But I guess it should work with
PowerPC also.

But I think many XP machines will not easily be able to work with Linux; unless the hardware was verified for Linux support during purchase. Things like ACPI, Graphics card, network card etc. have been known to misbehave in Linux while working perfectly fine under Windows XP.

Also, to my knowledge there are some applications built in client-server model using .Net, how will these applications run under Linux?

In our College, a batch of more than 300 Wipro machines are working only with CentOS, and network card is working only in 10Mbps mode; but in XP 10/100Mbps is supported.

GPU, network cards do work well with Linux than with Windows I guess.
BIOS developers don't properly confirm to ACPI spec fully, if windows
runs they assume it confirms to ACPI. So its not linux's problem.

> In our College, a batch of more than 300 Wipro machines are working only with CentOS, and network card is working only in 10Mbps mode; but in XP 10/100Mbps is supported.

Please try to get more info and ses if there are solution for this in
google. I feel there should be some solution. If not filing a bug in
the vendor's support page is what you can do.

PrasannaKumar

In windows if a new software is required  software can be downloaded

Dear All,
     I am not sure any one here working on this open source CNC machine. Introducing, DIYLILCNC project is a free & open-source set of plans for an inexpensive, fully functional 3-axis CNC mill that can be built by an individual with basic shop skills and tool access. DIYLILCNC is working with Linux, RTLinux, QCAD and CNC machine. Apart from the open source software, you required to buy the stepper motors, motor driver board, drilling machine and obviously customs duty. You probably required ~1500$ to prepare the entire setup.

http://diylilcnc.org/

We have this machine with us and done a R&D project for key cutting. We would like to offer Internship/project opportunity on this machine. Mechanical, Electrical/Electronics & Software background students can work on this open source project. 

Hobbyist may required basic knowledge about how to draw a diagram on QCAD/AUTOCAD. 

Entrepreneurs can also contact us in case if you are interested on this machine. Usually, the CNC machine cost is always costly in the market. You can build your own low cost machine which is suitable for your customer. Refer this link for what you can do with this machine, http://diylilcnc.org/blog/

Prakash A S.

Hi. The LinuxCNC (Early it was EMC2) has been already used by DIYLILCNC project and the CNC machine is controlled by the LinuxCNC software inside of the DIYLILCNC.

Because there are many GNU/Linux distributions with variations on the design.

GNU/Linux applications are developed as multiple parts and libraries.
They are interlinked and called with the application is running.

These libraries can be used by multiple applications.

Example: aspell is a spell checker.
This can be run as stand alone application.
or called from any text editor, or word processor.

Thus, gedit, vim, kate or libreoffice can use the same aspell spellchecker.
We can use the aspell in our own developed application.

On the Windows OS, all the libraries and utilities are bundled with
single software.
We can not use the spellchecker comes with MS Office in any of the
other application.

If we write our own application, we have to write our own spellchecker.

As all the components are bundled, Windows application installers are portable.

In GNU/Linux, all the applications depends on someother utilities and libraries,
Thats why the size of the software are very little compared to Windows apps.

but, they are not portable, usually.


The installation systems line apt-get, yum, ubuntu software center,
synaptic take care
of installing all the dependencies along with the single software.

I do not know whether this gets top posted or not - forgive me.

You can also give this message to MSME (Micro, Small & Micro
Enterprises)- guindy, who are trainers for a variety of small scale
industries.

Also, there are a large number of Industrial Estate Associations, who
would be interested in this.

And, there are around 80 ~ 100 OEM companies like - ACE Design, HAAS,
HMT, Batliboi, who may be interested to know about this.

I was in power conditioning - which supports a lot to these companies
- so I know a little on this, now.  I am not in this for atleast 4 -5
years, and have lost touch in this.

Hope this may be useful to someone.

with warm regards

as this free software switching their is an serious issue that BANKS IN
INDIA over 34,000  branches in india are using WINDOWS XP where their
official support of microsoft is going to stop supporting XP from april
8,2014 they have to migrate to new version .

"according to a study conducted by ascentius consulting on behalf of
Microsoft revealed that penetration of windows xp in the indian banking
sector is about 70 per cent,which is a pretty high figure."

so we should make a team to react in a way to help our banking sectors to
migrate to open source . thus it has some issues to migrate fully but we
have to initiate it ..

i would like to volunteer this with shrinvasan sir..
we need some volunteers to help us to make it happen..

Hi Purushothaman - Incidentally, I use Linux Mint as well and a recent
convert from Windows. Installing applications / software is much
easier in Linux, provided the application is available :-)

My answers are from a layman perspective and maybe incorrect from
tech. standpoint. I am not a programmer and hence no itching to
understand what happens under the hood. ;-)

Like Google Play store, the distro (Mint in your case) has a
repository of all essential software packaged for users. You can use
software manager to search for software and install. Mint (derived
from Ubuntu) has a pretty good collection of most software.
http://community.linuxmint.com/software/browse
Note, these may not be latest since application versions tested to be
stable are usually offered.

If the application is not available in Software Manager , then

1) Search for *deb file (similar to .exe file in Windows) in the
application's website. There maybe multiple versions available, e.g.
32-bit or 64-bit version. You can just click and install if it is one
file.
Else in case of multiple files, you can got to terminal and navigate
(cd) to folder, type sudo dpkg -i *deb installs all deb files in the
folder.
By default, applications installed through software manager gets
downloaded to /var/apt/cache and for future can be installed later by
apt-get install command. If you ahve another machine with similar
setupo just copy stuff from here to avoid multiple downloads.
2) Search for PPA of application. Some noble souls package
applications for users w/o us worrying about dependencies or whatever.
You can use Software sources in Mint to add PPA's or if you want to
feel like nerd there is some apt-get command which I do not want to
remember. ;-)
3) If it is not  / no equivalent available at all, then for some
applications, you can run using WINE.

Hope this helps.

That's great! Shall we collaborate and have an event together?
We have confirmed the venue as Thoughtworks, but not the agenda yet :)

Hi all,

We're having another set of hack days next week. We're spending time
focussed on 6 of the core apps - but welcome contributions to all the
apps all the time of course!

I've blogged about the hack days, and the fact you can test and
develop the apps on the desktop too. We hang out in #ubuntu-app-devel
on freenode, everyone is welcome :)

IMO, since the said RPMs are targeted for CentOS/RHEL, it would best
to build the RPM on a CentOS/RHEL platform itself.
In VBox or LKVM guest, you can install a "Development" type desktop,
it will have all the tools needed to build the RPMs.

You have changed the topic under discussion aka hijacking.   Your
query has zero correlation with Asterisk / FreePBX
With such disregard to mailing list guidelines, you are unlikely to
get any useful response.

The best way to ask a query is to  'compose' a *new* message with an
appropriate subject line and post it.

Please note that simply changing the subject line is *not* sufficient.

Best,

Subject: [Ilugc] Managing kernel-updates in rpm
Message-ID: <CAK25hWOBJSizJQw4O3C1sVi4fiy_=pptcfNVYw0=ohrcZWZBYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

       We have a rpm which installs a linux kernel driver. Now this
driver has some kernel-level dependencies especially Development Tools
(kernel-headers etc) such that they depend on running kernel version.

Now in the rpm we provide drivers for different kernel versions since
the user can update the kernel. In the rpm's SPEC file, we match the
running kernel version with our driver for that particular version and
install it.

If the user has updated its kernel to such a version whose driver is
not present in the RPM, the installation fails. We tell user in the
error message to update the kernel to a supported version.

Now this is very cumbersome and we plan to replace it with installing
a yum plugin through our rpm which allows user to update the kernel
level dependencies.

Is this a right approach?

Regards,
Saket Sinha

You have not provided much data along the lines of kernels being
targeted or, so forth. However, is this not the functionality that is
now built-in to yum (and was previously available via the yum-kmod
plugin)?

I am assuming that for installation of packages and handling of
dependencies your workflow invokes the package manager rather than RPM
commands.

Message-ID: <CAK25hWNQEeL4f85TGeyjbfi44e29D6QDHNo9UXeURzq2sk0EgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Let me describe a scenario to explain my question -

I first deployed a RHEL machine which happened to boot into
kernel-2.6.32-358.14.1.el6.x86_64.
Some time later I decided to install kernel-headers and kernel-devel,
and therefore I ended up with kernel-devel-2.6.32-431.5.1.el6.x86_64
and kernel-headers-2.6.32-431.5.1.el6.x86_64. Note that these differ
from the running kernel in minor version (358 and 431). This is normal
and expected with RHEL but it breaks the installation of my driver.

I will also explain why my driver has dependencies on these packages

In this condition, my driver rpm will try to install a driver for
version 2.6.32-358.14.1.el6.x86_64 which is the currently running
kernel. Since the rpm does not contain a driver for this exact kernel,
 I do not fail my driver.

NOW HERE WHAT CAN I DO. I HAVE FOUND THE FOLLOWING SOLUTION.
 In my rpm's SPEC file, I try to build my driver with kernel-devel &
Development Tools. Thus my rpm has dependencies on two packages
kernel-devel and development-tools. Most of the times this is
successful. But look at the above scenario.
What all I have in the above scenario-

kernel-devel-2.6.32-431.5.1.el6.x86_64
kernel-headers-2.6.32-431.5.1.el6.x86_64
kernel-firmware-2.6.32-358.14.1.el6.noarch
kernel-2.6.32-358.14.1.el6.x86_64

 And although it appears that kernel-devel is installed, it is
installed for a different version from the running kernel, hence the
failure.

Now I thought of installing a yum plugin with my rpm to handle kernel
updates rather than the above approach. Is this approach right?

Saket Sinha

Based on my understanding any code that links to kernel and uses its api
becomes GPL code (except user space code). So you have the right to show
the code. If you want help from other kernel developers then you need to
provide the code.

There is no point in helping a closed source software in ILUGC. So please
take the question to the proprietary driver vendor's support.

All the best,
PrasannaKumar

We've used FPM in a VM in the past.
This has ruby dependencies.
This should work if your Solaris satisfies them.

Great solution, but the OP did not want to build package for multiple
package manangers; the OP mentions only RPM.   I still I do not
understand why the RPM has to be build in a solaris environment when
it is you can do in on CentOS platform (on native hardware or a guest
VM in VBox running in Solaris).

3. what should be  my dns server ip address? can  i configure google dns
address for forwarding request.

4 . How should need to configure my dns server for forwarding.

Need to enable auto proxy discovery used wpad.dat

I sympathize with your situation.  As a developer you are not familiar
with server setup and IT infrastructure services.

You need help in too many areas and there is a learning curve in each of those.

You can try using some of the appliances like pfsense, ipcop etc. but
still you need to have a reasonable understanding of the services you
want to use.

If time is of essence, to your organization, then I would suggest you
request your manager to seek professional help with all of the above.
A competent sys admin can do your setup in about one day's effort.

A different perspective - I have a PHP application that needs some
customization.  I am able to understand bits and pieces of the code
but not enough to go through the source code and figure out where to
make the changes.  I could teach myself PHP through books, various
fora, become competent to read the code and make the changes.  This
may take me 2-3 months but time is of essence to me - my client will
not wait that long.  I would be better off assigning the job to a
competent developer, get it done and have a satisfied client :)

Hi,

       There are already good SVN administration tools in the market. And
they do exactly what you need.. Few are Svn Edge, Uber SVN.  You can try
that .

Thanks Madhu for your information,

As per my understanding suggested tools will support my requirement? 

Am looking for tools which will support SVN Administration through GUI (want administrate the tasks User adding, Deletion and Repo's creation etc.,).

Please suggest me with few links.

Thanks in Advance,

You are doing great job on making 4K resolution videos on Thirukkural.
If you are planning to send multiple mails on such videos to this
list, I would recommend that you mark it [OT] as it is not directly
related to the topic of this list. You might also want to post this on
the ILUGC Tamil list (iirc, it was created a few years back for Tamil
discussions in ILUGC).

+1.  I watched the first video and saw a bunch of text slides (in
Tamil) with accompanying audio.

The YouTube video was certainly not 4K (even 720p requires about 4
Mb/s for a decent user experience).

I cannot read Tamil so the content went over my head.   Nevertheless,
I was wondering what is the value add of 4K for a bunch of slides with
text in it.

Hi there,

4K video is just for future protection.
Video will look good when people use higher than 1080p in future.
Also, our master video we upload is 4K but youtube serves in several
formats to fit bandwidth and device.
other than that, yes, we use just text as of now.

FWIW,  I received the Release 8.0 announcement a couple of hours ago
and found that it is supported on only one OS platform -- MS Windows
server 2012 / 2008R2.

If you are using Zimbra on any other OS platform and wish to migrate
to rel. 8, then you are choice is limited.

Zimbra Community is a separate product and always run on Windows OS. Zimbra
Collaboration (the email suite), on the other hand only runs on Linux OS,
still!.

If he could make fpm work on his solaris box he could build rpms right there.

Hmmm ... but at that time it was part of VMWare (or Yahoo - I don't
recall).  Telligent may have different plans.
If it is a prank then their cron job is off by a couple of days

Solaris has it's own package manager.  I don't follow your logic --
what is the difference between make and build?

BTW, trim your quotes and do not top post.

I would rather try and understand why it has to be built on Solaris. There
exist pretty robust build tool methods which work perfectly well on Linux.

Shortly after Brendan Eich was named the new CEO of Mozilla
Corporation last week, it was revealed he had donated US$1000 to
support California's anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 in 2008. The
proposition passed the same year and was only struck down in 2013.

Multiple employees at Mozilla have openly called for Eich's
resignation over his anti-gay marriage stance, posting similar
messages on Twitter.

Dear all ,

I have a query regarding licensing .

Is it possible to take a code released under , Apache License, Version 2.0,
make modifications to it and release it under GPL V3 ?

That would invalidate the requirement that all Apache software must be
released under Apache 2.0 license?

You can combine Apache and GPLv3 code in a project. Also read:

Good that they open sourced the code.

AFAIK, Apache license does not mandate that the source be released.

It depends on what you mean by contribution.

If you make changes to an existing code released under Apache license,
then, it will continue to be released under Apache license, and they
are not obliged to release the source code.

---

\--

Yes. But, if yours is a new contribution to the project entirely under
GPLv3, then, they will need to release this source under GPLv3.

As mentioned earlier, IANAL. It will be good to have a discussion with
the respective project team members before you start contributing to
the project.

Best wishes,

SK

Thanks all for your suggestions. My Target stack is a mix of solaris, linux
vm's . So i need a single jenkins job for a project release to do the build
and create packages for solaris and linux VM's . I've used .pkg for solaris
and RPM for linux , so far i've been using two build servers solaris and
RHEL to build RPM's and solaris package respectively.  But having a single
server to create both RPM's and Solaris package would help me to remove the
Linux server and save some cost.

The fundamental principle behind creating RPMs for Fedora/RHEL is to
_always_ do native builds. So, if you need to build RPMs,
cross-compilation is not recommended.

Thanks Shakthi, but i don't care about compilation mine is a java
application , so i believe i can compile it anywhere and run it any server.
It's just about packaging, what is the issue in having an rpm created in
solaris server and deployed in RHEL servers.

This has more information. That is useful. If I understand the above
correctly, you do have a single CI job that uses two different build
systems to generate the appropriate packages/package_format. In a
separate response you mention that this is a Java application. That
you do care about proper packaging/package format would indicate that
you want to stick to the native packaging system for your target
deployments. In that context, Shakthi has provided an important input
- doing native builds will help you derive greater value from
packaging/deployment/administration and also help in debugging causes
of build failure, if any.

Yes. Sadly, this has been a bit of a trend on this list lately. Not
enough data/information to be able to provide a response that is
useful. Playing 20 questions over email is a task for the patient :)

You can definitely run it anywhere, but compilation, by definition, is
compiler and architecture dependent. The RPM macros will differ
depending on the platform you use.

The ability to re-create any binary RPM from source is cleanly
possible through native builds, and that is the reason behind RPM
packaging in Fedora/RHEL. It is a bit tedious in cross-compilation
environments, and, hence not encouraged in these distributions.

It was not meant to be used this way. Use the tools the way they were
designed for, instead of having to fight with the tools to do what you
want them to do.

SK
