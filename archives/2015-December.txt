Looks very similar to Zentyal (Ubuntu based)..  Reading the User
Manual; the feature set is comparable to Zentyal.  I looked for
content filter (Dansgaurdian) and Time of Day rules (ToD) but I did
not find it (or I missed it).

BTW, host the ISO on sourceforge or similar service.  The ISO download
takes forever (816 MB and counting -- too big IMO).   Most others like
zentyal, ClearOS, Nethserver fit in a CD ROM.

Is it based on any distribution?  If so, just provide the packages
rather than the ISO.

Please share your workaround so that others with a similar use case
scenario can benefit from your knowledge.

+1 about upgrading your OS to a supported version.  I have seen cases
of Fedora 4 still running on public facing interfaces!

Most security incidents are caused because of lack of system upgrades
(OS + application stack).

The RPM tool set  is available as a deb package.   It is useful to
have it on a Debian based system to examine RPM based packages.

I would not recommend installing RPM application/library packages on a
DEB based system using the RPM tools.

In fact, the packages should be **native** to the distribution e.g.
not to mix Debian package with Ubuntu and vice versa.   There may be
subtle artefacts (bugs) that show up on "out of the box" use cases.

What error? Please try to write in detailed when posting a question.

vsphere is from VMWare and you need to ask them for support. This

Hi Arun,

My objective was to move SVN repos to a new platform so I used svnsync
command to create a mirror of SVN repos in the new server.

 I used svnsync over http and restrict access limited to source and
destination server. I enabled SVN over HTTPS after the successful execution
the svnsync.

Hi,

I am looking for an Opensource monitoring tool with the following facility.

1. White Labeled dash board for each company [ for each company they need a
separate dash board and logins, users of one organization cannot see others
servers.]
2. Have a report (pdf/jpg/etc) generating facility.
3. Good to have RMM [ tools like reboot , ssh etc ]

Checked Nagios /zabbix/shinken/opsview etc, but they  don't have facilities
like separate logins/report generate etc.

Install one instance for each company so that all the data is separated.

If you want one single software for all customers like salesforce, you have
to customize them.

Use nagios or zabbix as your central tool and then create individual 
dashboards with something like
http://grafana.org/

This way you centralise monitoring but give customers they're own view.

Can we have the meet on 19 Dec. I haven't checked clashes with other
events. Just a suggestion since I feel it will take this weekend off for
the people to settle from the floods and also many are involved in relief
volunteering efforts.

I would prefer it that way as well,  people whose houses got flooded are
planning to clean up during the weekend, etc.  Would the 19th work for
everyone planning to attend?

	firewall
Message-ID: <CAP6xenkibxbi2ZvJGDFWyY0xTkrBe0z1Hzs8nGuxGQNipX9e2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Namaste Friends,

I am trying to install bitmask (https://dl.bitmask.net/linux/) on my ubuntu
machine (14.04 Trusty, 32-bit) but unable to install it. I have gone
through their installation guide and followed the steps but failed to
install it.

There is some error related to Python Leap. Did google on it too. Has
anyone installed it earlier? Any pointers would be of great help.

One more doubt I want to clear is that I want to access INTERNET (blocked
sites via fortinet firewall) from an organization's network. Will it
trigger an alarm if I try to access blocked websites via bitmask if bitmask
allow me to access sites?

My question is silly but guide me on this so that I may never have a doubt
on it.

Look forward to hearing from you guys soon.

Thank you.

Will paste it soon. As far as I remember it was about python leap not
supported or facing dependencies issues while installing leap. Will confirm
the exact error and paste it.

I don't think so that if I ask them then they will allow me. They have even
blocked Ted.com and plenty of other education related video sites.

You are bound by the terms and conditions put forth by the
organization. So, you will only need to work with them in this regard.

Without explicit permissions from the org administrator, you might be
violating their policies and perhaps giving an opportunity prosecuting
you.

You need access to certain sites? I would suggest you ask them to
allow, with specific justification e.g. you need it to execute your
job assignment.

Fair enough. I checked with the Aerospace department, and they are
fine with having our meet next Saturday, December 19, 2015.

Did you check line number #92 in /etc/neutron/neutron.conf for
'auth_strategy' as mentioned in the error?

Hi,

I had requested Shanthakumar to add me as a co-organizer at the ILUG-C
Meetup group, where I shall try to update the agenda before our
monthly meets.

  http://www.meetup.com/ILUG-C/

I shall request the Meetup members to subscribe to this mailing list
as this will be our primary communication channel.

Shanthakumar will continue to be the organizer at Meetup for our group.

With kind regards,

Hi,

Can any one suggest me a good monitoring tool for monitoring server,
processes, applications, databases (mysql, redis), daemons etc.

I had a look into Monit and Zabbix(http://www.zabbix.com/). Is there any
other similar tool like Zabbix. Just  wanna try various options.

Thanks in advance.

It might be helpful if you define your requirements first and then
look for a suitable product that meet them.
As stated by others there is a slew of products in this domain;
nagios, cacti, opennms, observium and more ...

This is the error when I try to install Bitmask (via ubuntu software center
or via .bz2 file).

Package dependencies cannot be resolved

The following packages have unmet dependencies:

bitmask: Depends: python:any (>= 2.7.5-5~) but it is a virtual package
         Depends: python-requests (>= 1.2.3-1) but 2.2.1-1ubuntu0.3 is to
be installed
         Depends: python-keyring (>= 0.9.2) but 3.5-1 is to be installed
         Depends: python-zmq (>= 14.4.1-1.1) but
14.4.1-1.1+0~20150512163425.14+trusty~1.gbpc12fc5 is to be installed
         Depends: python:any (< 2.8) but it is a virtual package
         Depends: python-argparse but it is a virtual package
         Depends: python-twisted-core (>= 14.0.2) but 14.0.2-1ubuntu1 is to
be installed


Any sort of pointers to this issue would be of great help.

Thank you in advance.

Is your Ubuntu version LTS? Open a terminal, and paste the output of
the following command:

  $ lsb_release -a

>From a terminal, can you try do an "apt-get update" first, and then
install the package?

  $ apt-get update

The instructions are here:

You can try this at home, but, please don't do such things in your
organization without their consent. You are responsible for your

I have done this too and did google on the error (unmet dependencies) but
to no avail.
Viewed /etc/apt/sources.list file but didn't find anything awkward.
apt-get clean
apt-get autoclean
apt-get update

sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt-get install -f

Followed instructions too but failed to install the same.

I have discussed this with them. I am asking this just out of curiosity.
Organization do have a vpn connection service if you want to access the
public network sites for your work so that's not an issue. But I want to
know what type of events fortinet firewall triggers if someone wants to
establish a vpn connection. Rest I don't have any bad intention.

Kindly share your valuable thoughts on the same.

Thank you.

Okay, it is LTS.

So, there is a package dependency problem. You could file a bug with Ubuntu.

You need to ask Fortinet, because they are the people who wrote it.
