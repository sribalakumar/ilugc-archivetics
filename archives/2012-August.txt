Zimbra uses jetty web server, Configuring VPN in corporate firewall is the
recommended way
to allow users to access webUI. What type of VPN you are planning to use
either SSL or IPsec etc.,
This could be more specific to search for the client.

 From a browsing centre through VPN?
The system to which they get access, in a browsing centre need to have 
VPN client installed right?

WebVPN?

That would be the expectation when the server has a public IP address
and a "global" domain name.

If that is not the intent then put it in a DMZ or within the LAN and
allow access to "LAN" users and  other users over VPN or port
forwarding (see below).

See above - DMZ/LAN.

Yes,  openVPN is the best out there for SSL VPN (layer 3).   There are
clients pretty much for all the popular desktop OS.   This will work
for road warriors and tele workers who use their own ISP connections.

However, a VPN solution may not be feasible from cybercafes wherein
you are restricted to the app stack provided by the vendor (as Amachu
has pointed out).

Having said the above, if the browsing centers are handful, they have
static IPs and you know that users from there are within your purview,
then you can port forward connections from such sites into the ZCS
server.   Open up special ports for each center and forward each of
those connections to the ZCS.   This way you can also log how many
connections from each site.   iptables is your friend in this
solution.

See above.

I guess you have to start ibus daemon. Once it starts things will be smooth.

    I am not very sure what he is trying to say. But these past few
days, I have moved away from Gnome to Fluxbox. And I am finding it
really wonderful. It is extremely customisable and very very light.

Gnome 3, though better than the Unity desktop that we have in
Ubuntu**, has been quite an irritant for a while. A lot of short cuts
that I have been used to over the years have changed. And trying to
figure them out, reconfigure them hasn't been as easy as it ought to
have been(at least for me).  As for Ubuntu,  with the HUD thing in
Unity, they made sure they drove me out of it. Thanks

You might want to try cinnamon desktop. Another project from linux mint. It
tries to stick to the traditional desktop metaphor(Gnome 2 look) but is
based on modern technology (Gnome 3). It has some cool features, but still
a young project with some rough edges.

Personally, I am sticking with gnome 3, as I have got used to its
features(or lack of it) and like it.

Hardly There are around a month for SFD.We are Suppose to fix the venue and
celebration agenda.I wont found any team registration from ilugc in sfd
website.hence we missed out swags and goodies.what about the agenda.My
Suggestion is to call for some competition for school and college students
about FOSS.So that we can expect the crowd and we can able to reach many
young minds.In the previous thread regarding this,lot of peoples are
interested to sponsor too.How much earlier we plan,that much output we can
produce.any suggestions and action plan.

Chromium may be released at fairly short intervals, but its upto your
distribution to maintain an updated package of the software. If you are
using a LTS version of ubuntu, you will recieve minumum updates. The goal
in LTS is to ensure stability. So they may provide you with well tested but
older versions, regardless of what is the current version of the software.

You have many ways by which you can process audio and video.

SoX is the best tool for command line audio processing with ability to
add echo, reverb,
 fade, crossfade, filter out noise, add flanger, panning and so on.

Audio junkies should know.

Now SoX supports a lot more than what it did when I wrote an article
long ago. Google for it.

Then you have audacity, a nice graphical tool for zoom audio waveforms
and edit them.

You can convert video to audio using ffmpeg.

$ ffmpeg -i foo.mpg foo.mp3

It is that simple.

Audacity is a very powerful tool.

It is a GUI that runs on many platforms so you should be able to edit
audio fairly well.

You can combine mp3 files or split them using mp3splt. You can id3
tags using id3ed.

You can easily amplify the volume without the annoying clipping effect
if you combine it with a
 bandpass filter with sox.

Or you could use normalize for the same.

If you play a lot of songs in unison you can use normalize which does
two passes and modifies the
 volume levels of all audio files.

Now let us talk video.

mencoder and ffmpeg are excellent. you have transcode which can do
things these two can't.

You know that video is nothing but image frames shown at high speed right?

You can get back images using a simple mencoder command line. It is in
my mplayer article.

You can create a DVD ISO that can play on your home DVD player using
dvdauthor and mencoder.

For audio and video player you also have vlc. ffplay, totem and so on.

For youtube video download you have youtube-dl , a python script.

If you want to add subtitles mplayer can . You also have OSD menus
that add a transparent layer on top.

You can probably come up with a home multimedia system with these tools.

We can do the following things.

1. One day Workshop for hardware engineers
2. Demo stalls for a full day in a public place
3. One day Hackathon to contribute to any free software
4. Dubbing for the film Revolution OS

Thus, we can have one event for every week of september month.

We need the following.

1. Place for one day workshop for hardware engineers. Any college or
office is fine
2. Place for demo stalls and volunteers for demo.
3. Place for hackathon - Any college or office with net connection is fine
4. Need some people to give voice and need a place to gather and record.

Please volunteer to get the places.

Share your thoughts.

Hi,

2. Demo stalls for a full day in a public place

sounds very good. I am not sure whether other action items can be done or
not!.
we can opt for Birla planetarium for one day. Birla planetarium authorities
asked us  to keep the companies out in the past. if this one clause is okay
with us, we can plan to have the demo at Birla planetarium else we have to
find another place.

Thats very sad and shocking news . I first saw the message on twitter,
couldnt believe it .

I remember seeing his mail to this very mailing list like 3 days back
. The community of Indian linux user groups will miss such an active
member .

I personally am indebted to Kenneth Gonasalves for being my mentor . I
am very grateful to him and am very much grieved at his loss . :(

Regards,
Pavithran

Kenneth was an asset to the Python community in India
and did a lot to bootstrap IPSS. His demise is sad news
for us.

I came to know about this shocking news via a SMS from a mutual friend.

A very sad and dark day indeed for all of us.

His sharp and witty postings will be missed in all the forums he
participated in.

May his soul rest in peace.

Is there an address (online or snail mail) to send our condolences to
his family members?

KG - RIP

I am very sad to hear this. I learned a lot from him and admired at
his works and talks. I cannot make myself that he is not anymore.

We will be missing our dear KG always...

Really Sad. I wanted to meet him sometime in my life. It is sad that
the privilege has been denied.

A no nonsense person. May his soul Rest In Peace.

Hi,

    Indeed, he was a good person, a very jovial person, full of life and an
excellent sense of humour.
As an example of his good humour, see his article on irctc madness
http://lawgon.livejournal.com/85000.html.
As for his good naturedness alongwith an excellent sense of humor, see
1) http://lawgon.livejournal.com/83481.html and
2) http://lawgon.livejournal.com/83805.html

The title of the above articles is an apt description for the demise of KG
himself  "A light has gone out ... ".

That makes me ponder with the death of "the Captain" in KG's article above
as well as the death of KG himself
if that is all there is to life or *is there something more*? I mean both
people were real but, in some sense
they were like cool characters right out of some well-planned novel.

I remember the last time I met him in person was in IIT Madras for an ilugc
meet. We had
good fun. Even then, I wanted to ask him a question but I was not able to
overcome my own
inhibitions to do so. Maybe I can ask it here, "*What is the real purpose
of life?*"

Is it not something worth reflecting on?

It is a very sad day for us. We lost a very valuable mentor :-(
His experience, wisdom and very valuable guidance will be missed.

May his soul rest in peace. My heartfelt condolences to his family.

Huge loss to the Indian FOSS community. Am fortunate to have met him at
PyCon held at IISc Bangalore a few years back. No one kicked Atul Chitnis'
ass like him.

Hi,

There are 4 host that are pointing to the same dns name and by round
robin rotation when you ssh into dns name you land in any one of the 4
servers. The filesystem of these are nfs mounted. So what comes in one
server appears in all servers. But the ssh keys dont change no matter
which server you land in. I want to know how ssh keys negotition works
in this senario.

with regards,
ashwin

Subject: [Ilugc] Kenneth Gonsalvas a short bio
Message-ID: <CAM4qvdH4rdcoajgXv-cC-e+_8Pj4wY25zwyi2=OEZZFWc3bE5g@mail.gmail.com>

Kenneth Gonsalvas (KG / lawgon) passed away on 3rd Aug 2012. He was leading
light, mentor, evangelist and practitioner of Free and Open Source
Software. He was a geek up to his last moments. His demise is a great loss
to FOSS Community in India. May his soul rest in peace.

A short bio of Kenneth Gonsalvas (Prepared by KG only)

"Although he has no formal training in the IT field, Kenneth Gonsalves has
been programming since 1986, starting with Turbo Pascal, then moving to
Perl and finally to Python in 2003. Since then he has focused on Python in
general and the Django web frame work in particular. He is an open source
enthusiast and has spoken and written on open source right from 1995 when
he was first introduced to it. He has conducted over 50 seminars and
workshops in python and Django. He was the founder president of the Indian
Python Software Society and a member of the team that has organised the
highly successful Indian python conferences from 2009 to 2011. He is now
based in Ooty where he writes and consults on open source. He also conducts
a job oriented course in python and django. His other main interest is golf
and he holds an international certification as a golf referee and has
refereed several national level golf tournaments. He writes a regular
column called 'Foss is fun' for the LFY monthly. Most of his code
contributions are here: http://bitbucket.org/lawgon/"

He was a good mentor and friend to many of us.

Some of his contributions, writing and rambling can be found

Dear all,

Could someone tell me the following please?

1) Age of Kenneth
2) Cause of death - Was it a sudden bout of asthma that the doctors
could not treat?

I know his brother Tag very well. He was very active and energetic,
extremely strong man.

I have met Kenneth exactly once and he resembled his brother a lot.

Does anyone know what really happened?

Thank you.

Oh this is so sad. I remember Kenneth arguing with me all the time on 
this list, and also remember when he said 'he's friends with those whom 
he fights with'. This is so much loss to me I lost a friend to be. My 
sincere condolences and 2 mins silence for his soul rests in peace.

I like this new [opinion] tag - hopefully it will get wider usage and
reduce flame wars and jingoistic statements that cause them. Congrats to

It's indeed a great loss to so many communities :( RIP KG.

We are planning to have an article about this great man in Kaniyam
this month. People who have valuable information about him (other than
what has been already shared in this thread), please share it here.

Very very sad news. My condolences to his friends and family.

Kenneth was special in this LUG. He was one person whom I made a note in my
`todo` list to meet someday. Very rarely you find people with his level of
conviction for what he believes is right. And never posts anything without
the backing of his conviction.

Dear all,

Personally & on behalf of all of you who would have wanted to take part 
in Lawgon's last rites, myself & Anand Balakrishnan Pillai of Python 
Society were there yesterday to pay our homage.

The cremation took place at Crematory near Wellington at 3 PM.

I have seen many mastering Open Source Technologies ending up making 
Proprietary Software with them or ending out working for companies that 
do so for a monthly salary.

He was lawyer, left it to become a free software developer, proponent & 
lived true to its cause, to the best of my knowledge & understanding.

from what I have gathered, he reported to his wife that asthma had returned to him after several years (1979?).

had some upset the earlier day. was supposed to conduct an event at PSG Tech.

he found uneasy around 12:30 PM and within 10 minutes, before his wife could gather people to take him to hospital he collapsed.

he belong to Gonsalves family (famous family of lawyers at Ooty, as I was told), always kept a low profile about himself & was anti-establishment to my understanding.

Not to be pedantic, but it is "Gonsalves" and not "Gonsalvas".

Nice work and thanks for putting it together on the wiki.  (Please do
take care of the typos as pointed out by
Prem Kurian Philip)

@ Shrinivasan: perhaps the ILUG-Chennai web site can reference the
above link since KG was very active in this forum also.

Thanks.

Dear jaganadh / shrini:

Kenneth was among the prime motivators and organizers of the (first)
"FOSS Conference" , initiated by ILUGC, held at MIT Campus and there
was a followup at Thyagaraja Engineering College, Madurai. We could
possibly revive -- have another this year. I hope some college could
come up to provide the base. It may be ideal if some Coimbatore
college (e.g. Sri Ramakrishna) takes the lead. I will also try my luck
with PSG, Amritha etc. If it fructifies, we could have it in the
memory of Kenneth who was keen to take the conference to different
part of the state.

Srinivasan.

Hi,

As a linux administrator, have learned so many things which is related Operating system perspective, memory manangement , monitoring,volume management and so and so. Now I am looking on moveup to unix so which unix flavour is good as high technical exposure and if i  prefered as solaris how is scope of that ? will it suites when moving from linux to unix as solaris ?

I don't have any perspicacity of solaris in production as well as how the concepts differ from linux ?
What actions be needed for carrier growth in linux ?

Please let me know if anyone aware or mention some key points. Even most of the guys having some kind of thinking on this sure it will give the pathway for upcoming Linux administrator.

A carrier is a ship. You want to use the word career.

Of course carrier also can be used for other forms of transport but
usually it is used to
 refer to ships.

Your mail also shows poor English and muddled thinking.

Along with that you want to become a systems admin instead of a programmer.

So it is all wrong.

Anyway Solaris is old commercial UNIX.

Today by UNIX people mean FreeBSD, NetBSD or OpenBSD.

Start with FreeBSD. After you find that you are comfortable with it
then graduate to NetBSD.

Then you can get to OpenBSD in the end.

This process will take 3 years.

I started my career with Solaris though I knew Linux from college.

That was 98.

Nowadays Solaris is hardly used.

People use either FreeBSD or OpenBSD.

In certain cases NetBSD is used.

You wanted points.

I dunno how to prove that UNIX is better than Linux.

Lot of people simply don't understand it.

And they cannot understand it.

As a systems administrator if you set your sight very low at any rate
you cannot
 understand much because your target itself is so low.

In general people have high goals and they end up reaching somewhere. But if
 the goal itself is set low then it is certainly going to not help.

It is not easy to answer this question but I will try.

1) Linux has bad file systems, it is a fragmented world with many
distros, even kernel
 is not standard. Many commercial people like Redhat has spoilt the charm

2) There are too many ways to do the same thing. No agreement, too many egos to
 satisfy and the project is being pulled in too many directions as
finding consensus when
 there are too many interests is hard. Even in things like epoll or
inotify or udev or whatever

3)Linux is not an OS. It uses the GNU toolchain, bash and other
userland from GNU project
 and only the kernel is maintained. A distro puts together all these
and does package management
 like RPM, DEB etc.

4) Linux is immature and a kid compared to UNIX as it does not have
ftp, ssh or make  or gcc or
 gdb in base install. The very spirit of UNIX and engineer mindset is
lost in trying to make it
 everything for everybody

5) I can go on and on and on ;)

Now UNIX is what started it all when Dennis Ritchie and Kernighan
wrote C to write UNIX.

Those brains had some vision and values behind what an OS should be.

Today OpenBSD is the only OS that upholds that spirit and resists
rampant commercialism.

The key difference between Linux and UNIX is that UNIX is one single thing.

By FreeBSD people know what it is. It is one single thing. There are
not 1000 distros in FreeBSD.

It is a combination of entire userland , kernel and base system.

All source code is maintained and audited in a single repository.

You can get the source code of entire toolchain used to create an OS
including X.

In short it is the lack of commercial interests and proper team
management, leadership
 and focus that creates a good quality OS suitable for engineering purposes.

To: ilugd at lists.linux-delhi.org


Here is an offering to keep you geeks on the cutting edge of your Linux
console usage skills.

This is a service I provide, called, "GNU Coreutils Tips".

In this service I send one mail everyday from Monday to Friday, about the
basic Linux utilities like head, tail, cp, cat etc (which form part of GNU
Coreutils package).

The idea is that we use these utilities daily and yet keep forgetting their
correct usage and even are not even familiar with all their features. This
service, with its drop-by-drop, slow-learning approach aims at long term
knowledge retention.

I can provide a free trial of 2 months to anyone interested. Charges for
this service is 2500/- per annum.

Just send an email to sendtoanoop at gmail.com with the subject
"Interested" and your 2 months free trial will start immediately.

Sincerely,
Anoop

      There are lots of ways to do a thing even in the UNIX world. It
is the availability of options that makes it good.

     That is in fact a very trivial thing. And if enough people make a
request to their distro, they are going to make it available in the
base install. The idea is to separate policy and mechanism - You have
a mechanism to install, and you have a policy of what goes into the
base install. It is very easy to change the policy and add 1 package -
for eg. build-essential in case of Debian, to get what you want.

Yes we have to revive the same. I talked to PSG Tech yeterday regarding
some major FOSS events in Coimbatore. They are interested. I will be
folowing up the discussions with them. KG had an idea to conduct a FOSS
conference at Coimbatore. Last year he tried to bring the Python conference
at CBE but not materialised. My team will be putting some effort to make
that happen with in one year or so.

Suggest you use a personal mail id (Google, Yahoo, Outlook or any of
the other free service) for mailing list and web forum activities.
It will help you maintain your identity even when you are not with
Logica.   Besides  Corporate email servers append legalese at the end
of each message which is very annoying to put it mildly.

There are opportunities in the Linux domain itself.   Some of the
commercial Linux offerings have Unix to Linux migration as a line of
business.    Nonetheless, having Unix admin. domain knowledge can be
plus for certain industries like BFSI which does have significant
investments in Sun products.

See above.

> What actions be needed for carrier growth in linux ?

Watch the curriculum for the advanced level Redhat and LPI Linux
certifications.   The curriculum keeps evolving on the latest
technology (which is driven by market demand) and it will help you
ascertain the areas that you may be interested in.

Virtualization, Cloud Computing, Security are vast areas.   You can
delve deep in anyone and strive to become an expert.

This is hard work.   No pain, No gain.

The OP at the outset says he is a Linux admin. and not a  programmer.
 I did not get this impression that he wants to be a programmer.
What I gathered was that he is looking for a career path in the Sys
Admin domain.

It may be old but I believe Oracle is still putting out newer versions
of it and it is still in use in the BFSI market segment.

Any references?   To my knowledge the above are derivatives of the
original AT&T Unix from Bell Labs.  Besides,  to call anything Unix,
it has to be certified by the OpenGroup which owns the Unix trademark
<http://www.unix.org/>.

Potentially any OS, including Linux, can be called Unix if one wants
to take it through the certification process:

Oracle would not put resource in to newer releases if they thought it was dead.

Hi,

I see that ilugc members are keen in promoting foss in colleges. I
know foss in colleges are a good idea, but foss also lives outside
colleges. I think foss could become more widespread if we talk about
foss and do foss in terms of the project, like helping user, and
contributing to the project via docs, bug filing and bug fixes , etc

I think ilugc is stressing on colleges bit too far. Remember KG didn't
learn foss in colleges.

with regards,
ashwin

Great if we could get this under KG brand name (referring to college as
well as kenneth !)
while chennai-cbre LUG could work out the agenda, i would make the
following suggestions:
a) approach to the college authorities could be thru ILUG (expert
resources) as well as NRCFOSS ("academic/govt" support - even if only
nominal)
b) sessions could include a workshop on Python and a half-day session on
industry/entrepreneural focus (invite participants from local industry
group, SME association

w.r.to a mail from Jaganadh, PSG could be approached, among others, thru
CSE HOD Prof Venkateswaran (I think) and Prof Karpagam. I could pitch in
once he makes the intial approach (could quote me).

There is no mention on the page about him being a lawyer.
Another point which I'd like to add is his role in attempting to start
a NRCFOSS node in Mumbai. Though it failed for various other reasons
but he took the initiative to get it started.

I am a silent spectator of this group. Certainly KG was a great asset to
this FOSS community, nobody can replace his position.

As far as event concerned, i would like to run a FOSS event in Madurai,
please ping me if any body is willing to take a leadership role for the
same.

Thanks,

Oh, common. What is wrong with being a systems administrator and how

	file
Message-ID: <CABtcFXR_h_A0-CTK+Xfi0+K2F6S=TpcXfkXt7GfEwopvAFAb-g@mail.gmail.com>

I want to use GCC's front end for a project. As a first step i tried
installing GCC from the source code downloaded from the official
website. But i couldn't install it. Please help me out for the same.

I have Ubuntu 11.10 (32 bit OS) in my computer. It has gcc-4.6 as the
default compiler. I tried installing gcc-4.4.6 from the source package
(gcc-4.4.6.tar.gz) which I downloaded from gcc official mirror site
but I couldn't install it successfully.

I downloaded gcc4.4.6 core package (tar file) , Unzipped it and tried following
      ./configure
      sudo make install
which showed me the following error
      vidhya at vidhya-Reserved:~/Desktop/gcc-4.4.6$ sudo make install
      make[1]: Entering directory `/home/vidhya/Desktop/gcc-4.4.6'
      /bin/bash ./mkinstalldirs /usr/local /usr/local
      /bin/bash: line 3: cd: host-i686-pc-linux-gnu/fixincludes: No

      make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/vidhya/Desktop/gcc-4.4.6'
      make: *** [install] Error 2

Can anyone suggest how to install any version of gcc supported by
11.10 from its .tar file.?

Dear Girish,

As usual, a cryptic (!!) and punishing teacher(ish) answer.

Please help the OP - with your vast knowledge (of Solaris, Unix - any by
that you can also include linux !!!). Your studying in REC helps you in
very good english - I understand.

May be you can teach another language as mundane as English too - so that
many people who post can write in good english.

(Psst....... I do not know about my english - you can call me and correct
me).

with warm regards

You don't need to install GCC from source code to work on the
front-end. You can always write dynamic pluggable front-end passes.

You should never run configure from the top-level directory. It is
customary in GNU packages to create a separate build/ directory inside
the sources, and run configure in it.

Please go through the slides and documentation from the GCC Resource
Center at IIT, Bombay [1] on working on front-end passes, and the GCC
wiki [2] page for compiling from sources.

         I don't think we should be criticizing someone's English to
this extent here. We are here to learn the technology from each other,
not English grammar or sentence formation. There are people on this
list who had their education in the vernacular language. Yet, they are
making an attempt to communicate in English because that is the medium
of communication on this list. We need to appreciate that and help
them out, and in a gentle manner.

    Solaris is old and commercial. But when we talk about 'old', a
great many things in the computer world are just as old - including
emacs and vi. And there are free variants Open Indiana, Belenix,
Joyent, Delphix - There are many of them out there. All of them stable
and reliable.

Disclaimer: I am not a sysadmin, but have seen many accomplished sysadmins
in action, and have a few good friends who have made a living in the field.

You can make a comfortable living by mastering administration of Linux
distributions like RedHat. There are plenty of jobs going around. But there
are many benefits from learning the differences between Linux and other
flavours of Linux - the most popular of which are: Solaris, HP/UX, AIX in
the server segment, and Mac OS X on desktops.

In terms of specific recommendations I would suggest you do the following:

1. Buy this book: Nemeth and Evis Unix Administraton Handbook is the bible
in this field. It gives you everything you need to know in your day to day
job as a Unix admin.
http://www.amazon.com/Linux-System-Administration-Handbook-Edition/dp/0131480057Note
that the book covers many Linux distros, HP/UX and Aix in many places
where there are significant differences. So this is the ideal book for you
and for all Unix admins.

2. Once you get a full hang of this whole deal, you may become curious to
understand more about the internals of Unix. If that happens, I would
recommend the following books: "The Design of the Unix Operating System" (
http://www.amazon.com/Design-Operating-System-Prentice-Hall-Software/dp/0132017997)
and "The Unix Programming Environment" (
http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Environment-Prentice-Hall-Software-Series/dp/013937681X/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b
)

3. You will realize in time that to be effective in this field you will
also have to have a solid understanding of networking and TCP/IP. At which
point you think of some certifications like CCNA/CCNP and more networking
books.

Happy Hacking!

-Karra

Hi

I guess around a week ago someone discovered a vulnerability in Nvidia
possibly driver.  Because of which people can gain root access to your GNU

ready to patch up.

I guess this is in straight relation to what I have mentioned.

<snip>

If you are an open source professional, you have an advantage over
others, when it comes to finding a job. Professionals with exposure in
open source technology are considered better engineers and have an
edge over others. Companies like CollabNet are always on a look-out
for such professionals and provide them adequate platform for
exploring their love for open source.

"If I have to hire for the engineering teams, I would look for open
source exposure in every hire. We are always glad to hire such
professionals," said Karthi Swaminathan, vice president, site
operations and engineering, CollabNet.

It will be nice if we log all the IRC discussions as we started to
have some nice discussions in the #ilugc-in channel.

Is there any free solution to archive all the IRC discussions
automatically like http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/ ?

It is done by IRC bots. I have one running on my server. I can set it
up to log discussions on the ILUC channel and then those logs can be
displayed wherever you like.

We could probably look into using google+ hangouts or skype or similar
methods. Personally feel that it would be a little better than irc. We can
also record the sessions for future reference.

You can point that subdomain to my server. I will do the rest. In case
you prefer to keep it on the existing ilugc.in server, I can setup a
mechanism to transfer the files periodically to that server.

I hope that keeping the logs in ilugc server is fine.

Subject: [Ilugc] Adding a Calendar to our site
Message-ID: <CAND2795ZGmdzMT4gd=dZQZia5S141C_4UU1mvAmHFVixYMELig@mail.gmail.com>

Found a nice wordpress plugin to add events and show as a calendar.
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/

We can see all the upcoming events in the sidebar of the site.

We can see the posterboard,mothly,weekly,agenda view in the following page.
http://ilugc.in/calendar/

We can subscribe to google calendar or any other desktop client like
thunderbird, evolution etc.

Hope this will help people to remember the events.

Evolution is not showing events with the default webcal URI,

webcal://ilugc.in/?plugin=all-in-one-event-calendar&controller=ai1ec_exporter_controller&action=export_events&cb=1863045861

Instead, use this URI, You must install 'evolution-webcal' package to
handle this URI.

Perhaps your friend and more importantly his "professor" should be
made aware of Scilab.

the said issue is now a non-issue.

Message-ID: <CAND2796ugwNTJPuJnDAdq2X6W_pi_+qPOyOyFwix2QaWg4jpCw@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

We need to collect data from people for the upcoming events like SFD, hackathon.

We can use our wiki, but still I am looking for any easier way.

Is there any nice form creating plugin for wordpress.

The requirements are
1. easy form creation
2. easy form validation rules
3. spam control
4. submitted values should be viewed and edited.
5. anyone should view previously submitted data
6. Login should not be mandatory.

Please share your thoughts on this.

Also this seems to be a good idea of pointing the above url, referring
no(s), when someone doesn't follow list guidelines.

Perhaps the Prof. has the right to technical support from Matlab If it
is a licensed copy.

Also please do not top post.

In google docs, we can submit the forms, but the public can not see
what others submitted.

I want a wiki kind of stuff but with forms infront of it.

you could always share a public link to the sheet created/embed it
elsewhere. This has been the simplest method for me over the years. Ymmv

Hi Shrini,

There are certain plugins to achieve this. I am listing a few.

1. *Gravity Forms* - One stop solution to all your form based needs. Its a
paid plugin. But its worth the cost. Here is the link
http://www.gravityforms.com/

2.  *FastSecureContactForm *- Free plugin.  But its not a mere contact
form. Comes with some promising options.
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/si-contact-form/

3.   *Custom Contact Forms* - Free plugin. Like FastSecureContactForm it
comes with more customization options.


4. *Contact form 7*- A simple but powerful contact form solution. Its free.

I'll vote for this one. It has lot of features and also has a few
other plugins built around it.

I've used this. Though this is mainly a "contact us" form plugin, you can
add any custom fields to it. But once a form is submitted, the visitor
cannot go back and edit it. I think the other contact forms suggested here
are similar in this aspect.

We need something like custom content type in drupal, if I understood the
requirements correctly.

1.  based on "user" going to various "sites"
2.  based on "sites" visited by "users" from the LAN.

An elegant and beautiful audio framework I'd add is the Jack audio
framework: http://jackaudio.org/ Jack audio folks brought "real time" to
Linux. Jack has plenty of super high quality software that fit the Unix
philosophy of "do one thing and do it right", which surprisingly is also
the philosophy of real audio hardware. You can have stand alone effects
processors, standalone drum machines, standalone midi sequencers,
arpegiators, synthesizers, recorders, etc., all being co-ordinated by the
jack audio framework. You can mix, master and even have remote computers
act as parts of these standalone components using netJack (works over UDP
and in an experiment I found it pretty ok to use remote MIDI apps (which is
the whole point because this way you can consolidate all the CPU power into
a centralized place where all the cpu intensive audio processing can be
carried out)). Jack simply kicks ass and is ought to be the dream come true
for DIY audio studio'ers.

Distributions such as AVLinux (semi proprietary), Studio64, Ubuntu Studio
are customised and packed with a lot of jack audio software (and even then,
I end up occasionally finding a better jack gem out there on the interwebz
somewhere, like qmidiarp). These distros typically come with jack support
by default or atleast make setting up jack easier.

One of the main hinderances of using jack with regular desktop apps (like
firefox / flash) is that regular apps are compiled against, typically,
pulseaudio framework. In contrast, the main step in getting jack to work is
to stop pulseaudio first. So this becomes a pain to play alongside your
favourite youtube video or even have a working browser while you are making
music. With jack you can not only do that but also rewire the
inputs/outputs to send the "Audio-Out" of firefox to some effects processor
or a recorder (or if you've got multiple sound outputs, then to different
output ports). AVLinux folks have taken the pain and care to recompile
general desktop apps like firefox/flash against jack so that you can have a
seamless audio experience. It almost feels like a mac without all the jazzy
graphics ;)

So, there, jack audio: http://jackaudio.org/ and I highly recommend AVLinux.

Cheers,

Hi,

Am having a strange problem on Ubuntu 12.04 (also on 11.04 earlier). I have
setup the network properly and am able to ping any website (google.com,
yahoo.com...) but not able to access the web pages via the browser nor
wget. Wget says: 'HTTP request sent, awaiting response....'. This happens
only in Wifi. If I try through a wired connection it all works without
problems. Even while Ubuntu cannot connect via Wifi my mac works on wifi
without problems!

What could be the problem?

thanks,

Suspect a DNS problem.  Check the following:

1. /etc/resolv.conf contents  (the servers listed here *must*  allow
queries from any network e.g. the servers from opendns and google.
2. DHCP server configs.

This is one is commercial though; unless you are subscribed you have

There's no http proxy.

I will try your suggestion when the problem laptop and the router meet
again (one's in my office and the other at home). I think there was another
thread a few months back where this MTU issue cropped up! But what makes it
curious is that one Ubuntu m/c can connect while another running the same
version (11.10) cannot!

Thanks very much to all who responded.

Hi all,

One of my friends, who has installed Ubuntu 12.04 in his System, is facing
a problem. He could not connect to the Internet using 3G data card. While
trying to connect, his device is not being recognised.

We tried connecting "Mobile Broad band Connection". But, under "Setup a
Mobile Broad band connection" the drop down box just shows "Any Device" and
clicking on it does not show his device.

Please help us to connect to the internet. Thank you in advance.

*DATA card model:  Leoxsys 72(v) White model*

P.S:
As of now, I know only GUI. Hence, I request you to kindly suggest GUI
methods as far as possible. If not possible, I am ready to try command line.

Nice ...

@ OP - if this script works out for you then make the effort to give
feedback to the author of the software and also contrib. information
regarding your setup and service provider.  India is missing in the
list.    I suspect it is because people who use it do not bother to
give information upstream.

not necessarily.

I feel, all we need to desire is that such events happen then and there 
spontaneously on their own, realizing the need of Software Freedom.

Hi,

Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it
happen.
- Micheal Jordan

let us desire to be  in the others category in this case.
Many colleges emulate what we do at ilugc.
I was asking in order to find is there any possibility to rope in some
volunteers.

Maybe we should highlight that ilugc is a non-profit working for spreading
awareness about free software, mentioning some recognizable open source
software?

Hi,

>>i checked with jaya engg college.they have yet to get management approval
for software freedom day on sep 15

Nice to hear JEC is hosting the event this year.

>> last year we and JEC did in same day. we got low audience.

I seriously doubt that as the  reason for low audience.


IMO, if we host it by inviting one or two students(I st or II nd year) from
each college, they can get experience while working along with us and
They can emulate such events in the near future in their respective campus.
Confining to a college may have advantages, but for sure will miss some key
benefits.

@Shrini,

As suggested by Thyagarajan, prepare a formal invitation and post it
in ilugc website and I will take some responsibility in informing this
to all the colleges through the FDPs which I will be conducting this
Month.

I would be reaching about atleast 50+ colleges through the FOSS FDP
and I will request them to send their students for SFD event.

i have some ideas to bring up the audience like competition for
schools/college students like drawing,slogan writing,installation
fest,hackathon and software demo...and in last year i hope there is no such
technical sessions are there except expo..plan some 1 hour session all over
the day.multiple topics like android,python,ruby,linux
administration,php,blender,wikimedia will bring the crowd
automatically.since lot of peoples in our list is in software company,we
can have a corparate sessions too on business improvement via open source
model like that.

Aeronautical Engineering is another.

Usually SFD is celebrated in september third saturday.

Last year, we and Jaya Foss Club celebrated the SFD in the same day.
Due to this we got some suggestions like having in a separate day will
be nicer to all
to attend both the events.

Checked with JFC. They are planning for third saturday.

I think having SFD celebrations on fourth or fifth saturday will be
easier for all
to share the resources and to attend both the events.

Please share your thoughts on this.

Hello Karthik,

I am also an electronics engineer. I never soldered. I have done electronics
 experiments during my semesters in college.

Electronics as a business proposition is very hard unless you live in
US, Taiwan or China.

So put up with writing code. ;)

Best of luck.

FYI, it is on 15th September
It would be better to keep it on the day.
We are having it on 14th in Kolkata.

Hi ,

My thoughts are

Jaya foss club has grown up and practically speaking they need little or no
assistance from us .

In my opinion, there are more private engineering colleges like JEC which
needs our support.

Govt of Tamil Nadu has given free laptops, we need to support those
students.

We need to explore new audience, create more colleges which will consume
foss in their usage.

IMO, *Thought of moving the date is a hindrance to build the momentum and
enthusiasm that leads to the event* .

Let us focus in building the volunteer base.

Happy Software Freedom Day :).

regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

I only wish more such events occur on same date & all information be 
gathered & presented.

MIT also will have I suppose.

Probably if we conduct SFD this year at a college, next year they should 
be able to care of it on their own.

It can be a dedicated staff driven as in case of JFC or student driven 
as in case of MIT.

So you want to become the next Steve Jobs? :)

Good that you have decided you need a partner. First step.
Realizing one's shortcomings and finding a complementary person is good
business acumen.

All the best. Problem is, in India there are lots of Wozniak-s but too few
of them are willing to take a plunge into entrepreneurship. But you will
find one if you try.

...and you do not have to be in China. You will use China to your benefit.

Hi Friends,

I have installed Ubuntu_12.04_x86_64 on vmware hypervisor esxi 5.0 and

connecting to my ubuntu server. At the same time i am able to connect from
xp machine to our SAP Server which is in the same subnet.

This is wrong. DNS is irrelevant. Leave it out.

Your gateway has to be the in subnet in which you configure your IP.

You cannot have 192.168.1.197 in a 172.16.1.0/24 subnet.

from your mail

Ubuntu GW - 172.16.1.97

XP GW - 192.168.1.197

Let me know this is a typo error.

Please login and check your GW router, whether you can able to ping the SAP
server IP 172.16.200.27

If you can able to reach the SAP server in your gateway router , please
route add your SAP server IP in ubuntu machine, else check the routing in
the gateway router.

Eg: $ sudo route add -net 172.16.200.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw (eth0 ) or
(172.16.1.197)

This must be typo.  From the Ubuntu setup I am presuming it is indeed
172.16.1.197.

Is there some kind of firewall that is not allowing connections from
172.16.1.6?   This could be either at the egress fw/gw/router or @ the
datacenter end.

try this and see what you get

telnet 172.16.200.27 <sap_port>

substitute <sap_port> with the port number on which your SAP
application is available.

So should your ubuntu server as well.   Me thinks there is some kind
of egress filter out of your 172.16.1.0/24 subnet or an ingress filter
@ the data center end.

I would suggest consult the resident Network Admin and get his/her opinion.

Oops.  You should do this both in the Ubuntu as well in the XP systems
and note the similarity or differences in the response from the SAP
server.

First of all your posting is over quoted; please *trim* all irrelevant
quote from previous postings.

The traceroute from both ubuntu and the xp system shows the same path
and that your SAP server is reachable from your ubuntu server.

While the traceroute out put helps, it does not mean that the SAP
server is reachable from the ubuntu server.

I strongly suspect firewall egress/ingress rules within your network
that is not allowing connection from the ubuntu server.

This can be established form out put of the telnet command I gave you
in my earlier posting.

A  "time out" means somewhere a rule is *dropping* packets from the
ubuntu server to the sap server
A "rejected" means somewhere a rule is *rejecting* packets from the
ubuntu server to the sap server

You can also try tcptraceroute to the SAP server (see man tcptraceroute)

$ tcptraceroute <sap_server>  <sap_port>

Ask your Network Admin about the sap_port if you don't know what it is.

BTW, how do you access your SAP server, from a web browser or it's own
thick client?

DigiKam 2.8 with kipi-plugins 2.8 comes with a feature to upload
images to any mediawiki  directly.
We can add all the required metadata within DigiKam itself.

We can use it to upload the images to commons with a very simple workflow.

links to read: http://www.digikam.org/
http://scribblesandsnaps.com/2012/06/25/export-photos-to-wikimedia-commons-with-digikam/

In ubuntu linux, using the following commands, we can install the DigiKam 2.8

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:philip5/extra
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install digikam


Hope this will help us to upload our creations to commons with ease.

I did both Electronics/Communication and Computer Sciences.
Soldered quite a few stuff... planned to make total intercom for college
(but institution wasnt ready to fund it)

As of yesterday I repaired my blackberry headset (still have the 10 yr old
soldering iron with me).. multimeter must be lying somewhere.

But alas, I don't have a current interest in Electronics business.
I do have interest in Robotics and AI now, but I lack the skill.

Free advice:  DIY - Do It Yourself .. first and then later try to pull in a
partner.
If you are not ready to do it yourself, it isnt very lucrative for another
person to be interested in making a business with you.

Did you ask your Network Admin what was the problem with the previous
IP number?   Until you know the answer to this question, I would not
consider it resolved.

AT this point of time you are clueless as to why the SAP application
was not reachable from your ubuntu server with the x.y.z.6 number
(presumably given to you by the Nework Admin).

Why did your Network Admin give an IP number in the first place and
change it later?

I had asked you to give the result of the "telnet:" test and you did not.

I am interested in confirming my suspicion of whether there were any
firewall rules preventing access to SAP application(s)  from the first
IP number but you have not done that.

IMO, this is the least you can do when people help you in these kind of forums.

Unless you start asking questions like these you will *not* grow your
knowledge base.   The next time you encounter similar symptoms you
will still be at base 0.

I believe 5.4 is no longer supported,  I would suggest investigate an
upgrade strategy to the latest release, factoring in  due diligence.

This is a quota defined by courier but your SMTP server is postfix.

What was the previous version?   Did you save it's config files esp.
main.cf file before upgrading to 2.9.3-1?

To the best of my knowledge, postfix will apply quota upon receipt of
mail as per it's own settings and not read courier settings.   I think
you will need to tinker with postfix's configuration to enforce quota.

Besides, if the Maildir in the user's home directory you also need to
factor in the file system quota.

Previous version of postfix is 2.8.3. Before up gradation of postfix i had
abackup of old versions of main.cf & master.cf.
I configured the courier-imap, quota option is there, I enabled that one.
After that i mentioned in main.cf file as below

virtual_mailbox_limit_override = yes
virtual_overquota_bounce = yes
virtual_mailbox_limit_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/vquota
virtual_maildir_limit_message = "Sorry the user's maildir has overdrawn his
disksapce quota, Please try again later."

Support quota is exceeded, mail is receiving instead of bouncing.

First of all please do *not* toppost.   go through the mailing list
guidelines that you agreed to when you signed up for this list.

Please *explain* why (with reference URLs) you keep mentioning courier
quota option when your SMTP server is postfix.

postfix != courier; to the best of my knowledge it's configuration
file is main.cf.

> After that i mentioned in main.cf file as below

Keep in mind that there are many postfix addons that may not be built
into the standard CentOS postfix package.

> virtual_mailbox_limit_override = yes

This does not make sense to me.   yes implies override the limit, have
you tried setting it to no?

Besides it does not appear in this list
<http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html> suggesting that it is an
extended parameter from an add on patch; so that may be your problem.

> virtual_overquota_bounce = yes

The output of 'postconf' will show you the parameters that postfix is
honoring irrespective of what you have put in main.cf.

I would strongly suggest that you look for clues in the postfix log
files found under /var/log/ and also look through postfix
documentation <http://www.postfix.org/documentation.html> for the
stock parameters.   From what I have seen, quota on maildir style is
not standard in postfix but provided by 3rd party patches.

Debian turns 19 today! And the current implementation of dpkg, the package

Here is the awesome story of a hospital in coimbatore migrated to
GNU/Linux, written by a doctor.

The Great Dream ?

    This post is my dream .. or has been for about 4 years.

A day that my hospital runs on full Open Source Software.

First a little about me. I am a practicing Paediatric Orthopaedic and
Spine Surgeon. I am a Open Source enthusiast. I started using Linux 6
years ago and for past 4 year I am using it almost exclusively at work
and home. The only time I use Windows is for the odd gaming. I do
Python programming ? web & desktop.

I dreamed that the hospital will implement an all Open Source
Solution. I advised them likewise.

Thanks for our young kid Kumaran (http://www.kums.in) for support and
Dr. Easwar T.R. for the great efforts.

Subject: [Ilugc] Need help on issue with ldaps in zimbra
Message-ID: <CAND2796YZX=e3D5utrqT7nB-uwy5qi2bXZUM4Nq3V+xRwUAExw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a zimbra mail server.

Recently I wanted to move to ldaps from ldap for higher security.

Did the following steps to do this.

zmlocalconfig -e ldap_master_url=ldaps://mail.domain.com:636
zmlocalconfig -e ldap_url=ldaps://mail.domain.com:636
zmlocalconfig -e ldap_starttls_supported=0
zmlocalconfig -e ldap_port=636
zmcontrol stop && zmcontrol start

wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/How_to_enable_ldaps

But, after this, external ldap tools can not connect to the server.

I can query the records within the server using ldapsearch.

If I do ldapsearch from external server, throwing following error.


ldapsearch -x -v -H 'ldaps://mail.domain.com/' -b
'ou=people,dc=domain,dc=com'  -D
'uid=test1,ou=people,dc=domain,dc=com' -W -d -1
ldap_url_parse_ext(ldaps://mail.domain.com/)

TLS: peer cert untrusted or revoked (0x42)
TLS: can't connect: (unknown error code).
ldap_err2string
ldap_sasl_bind(SIMPLE): Can't contact LDAP server (-1)


What is mean by the error?
TLS: peer cert untrusted or revoked (0x42)

In server side, in the file /etc/openldap/ldap.conf

I tried with both the settings.

1. TLS_REQCERT never

2. TLS_REQCERT allow

But still, getting same error.
Because of this, can not use the addressbook from any of the email
clients I use.

Please help with your suggestions to solve the issue.

Thanks.

my suggestion isn't to put efforts on non-LTS ubuntu releases.

the changes are happening too fast to be continuously done, maintained & 
sustained at our end with limited infrastructure, resources & volunteers.

suggest you to focus on bringing it for 12.04 LTS in another three 
months & maintain it till 14.04 and even till 17.04 until when it will 
be supported by Canonical.

    Siebel is not a technology that I know, but I know that you would get
more answers if you give some more details... like

1. When you say you want to 'connect' - do you mean you want the client to
access siebel server from a linux box?
2. How is the usual siebel 'connection' from windows happening - this will
give us some ideas on equivalents in linux
Also,
3. How do you think you will achieve cost cutting - by not buying doze
licences? Or is there any Siebel licenses that you think you can save on -
pl. elaborate.

Sorry I was not  specific in my OP.   I am looking for Web UI to
manage, Squid + content filter (Dansgaurdian) + LDAP auth.

ISP Config is similar to CPanel more appropriate for web hosting
management, I looked around the feature set and did not see any LDAP
and Squid administration.

Cursory look @ Virtualmin looks promising but I will have to dig
deeper to see if it meets my requirement.

Thanks.

Thanks for the suggestion will look into virtualmin.

Please trim your quotes and do *not* top post.   It only takes a few

Thanks for the suggestion but I am having problems with Zentyal 2.2 on
Ubuntu 10.04 (amd 64) server and looking for an alternate solution.

I can hand craft a Debian server to achieve my objective but all it's
administrative activity will have to be done with hand editing the
.conf files.   I have no issues with it but the client's network
administrator is not too comfortable with it.

Do you have any experience with Zentyal 2.2. on Ubuntu 10.04?   I can
post the problems here and perhaps you can shed some light on the
problem I am encountering.

I have found the Zentyal forums not very helpful.  My staff and I have
posted issues but no responses - whether I am right or wrong in my
approach.

Thanks,  ClearOS was my first evaluation.   It looks very promising,
the interface is sleek.  I have taken the 5.x and 6.2 for a spin.
Could not implement Captive Portal in 6.2 as it is missing.  Posting
on the forum has remained unanswered.

Decided to switch to Zentyal.  IMO, Zentyal integration of the
Gateway+UTM services (FOSS stack) do work out of the box (except for
one problem that I am having with Squid).

I'll post the Zentyal problem in a new thread.

Yes, you have willfully broken the beautifully crafted Debian package
management system when a simple
 "apt-get install dnsutils"  would have done the job and not comprised
the integrity of your system.

nslookup is provided by dnsutils.  On my Kunbuntu 12.04 the contents
of dnsutils is:

$ dpkg -L dnsutils
/.
/usr
/usr/bin
/usr/bin/dig
/usr/bin/nslookup
/usr/bin/nsupdate
/usr/share
/usr/share/doc
/usr/share/doc/dnsutils
/usr/share/doc/dnsutils/copyright
/usr/share/man
/usr/share/man/man1
/usr/share/man/man1/nsupdate.1.gz
/usr/share/man/man1/dig.1.gz
/usr/share/man/man1/nslookup.1.gz
/usr/share/doc/dnsutils/changelog.Debian.gz

Also, even though nslookup is available in most distro, it is
deprecated.   You should be using 'host' or 'dig' instead.

See above for dnsutil package content - you must have pulled these

You are a brave man playing with library dependencies in such a way.
I would not mess with moving/replacing library files especially when
you have no clue to which package they belong to.     At the least,
it is always better to do 'mv -i'  if you must do the above.

Only you know the time you spent on getting this to work but I think
it would have a lot faster to do a simple "apt-get install dnsutils".

I would advice you not to play around with libraries installed by the
distro package manager; rather have them installed through the
dependency chain that each package painstakingly maintains so that you
are guaranteed a sane system.

I think the Op know how to do apt-get, but he decided to play with
libraries.

As long as *Machine1* and *Machine2* is ABI compatible (OS word size,
binary format, endian etc.,) this 'mv' method will work, assuming that
the mv-ed libraries' dependencies are already present in *Machine2*.

Well, instead of 'mv'-ing libraries, why cant you just download the
source tarball of dnsutils and do-yourself source compilation. Trust me,
its a real fun!! welcome to the dependency hell!!

I don't know what the above do but presuming it is all on the server side.

Post the command line from an "external" server.

I believe you need to configure your ldap client to do TLS/SSL as well
and also use the -ZZ option on the CLI for StartTLS (man ldapsearch)

-ZZ is missing see above.

Can you contact the LDAP server in text mode?  i.e. telnet <ipNumber> 389

LIke so:

$ telnet sas-alix 389
Trying 172.16.0.1...
Connected to sas-alix.xxxxxx.xxxxxx.xxx
Escape character is '^]'.

I believe this is the conf file for the client.   The server side conf
file is slapd.conf (man slapd.conf for TLS settings)

Also suggest reading
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security> if you have
not done so.   It gives an overview of how TLS works.

Yeah, I know OP knows about it but what he is trying is dangerous.
One smell of success with a small utility like this and he will try
with something bigger and when he breaks the system, he will not know
what him on his head.   He may also end up doing this on production
systems and make everybody hopping mad.

IMO, this is dangerous.

Please read the entire thread from ILUG - Delhi:

Again, with package managers and pre-compiled packages esp. like
dnsutils it is pointless IMO.  It is better to install it from the
repo.

This is a better method.  The ./configure shows what is required and
missing and what is optional (can be ignored) and everything is
installed under /usr/local so chances of contaminating the "installed"
system libraries is low.  It is a great start to learn how to build
"full" packages with it's external dependencies met.   I had to
install MythTV from source and yes there is dependency hell but you
don't bugger up your installed base system.

Of course the OP is free to continue this method.  Unix/Linux will let
you shoot yourself (cd /; rm -fr *).

Actually, I spoke to the doctor this afternoon and asked the  same question. The  software itself is based on java I believe, but it is now completely deployed on servers and clients running open source operating systems. The source code is however been provided, but under NDA,  so it is not open source.

I met these folks a year ago in Bangalore. Seem to have done well with a
large free hospital management system with paid support model.

When virtualmin was mentioned, the name sounded familiar but I could
not place it.

Upon web site visit, I realized that it is a complementary product to
webmin [1].  They also have another product called Cloudmin.

[1] <http://www.webmin.com/virtualmin.html>

I am still trying to resolve the Zentyal issue.   However, if push
comes to shove i.e. go for a Debian solution then webmin may be the
only option w.r.t a Web UI for administration.

Someone in a private email suggested Untangle (see below)
<sidebar>

> try untangle

Thanks for the suggestion.   I have already tried it.  It is very
resource heavy and some of the basic functionality like WAN load
balancing + failover which is handled in iptables is a "commercial"
add on.   In ClearOS and Zentyal it is integrated into the base
product.

BTW, you should have posted this on the ILUG Chennai list so that
other members also come to  know about the products in the market and
make their own choices.

Thanks to all who responded.

Thanks for everyone's feedback, I did that as a test on my test machine as
my net was flapping to download the additional tar ball or do a apt-get
install.

Okay I figured out that it is not safe to do what I described by copying
and moving and I also figure out what is OP which is Original Poster :-)

Finding the dependency was not very hard we can very well use strace
<command> to see what are all the files which it requires before working
correctly.

Is it 'strace'? or 'ldd'?

I think you didn't get the meaning of 'dependency
hell'(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell) Its not about the
dependency files you see from ldd output. Its about how those dependency
files installed into your machine. Just try to compile dnsutils from
source, you will understand what it means. If you want more fun, go for
Gtk (http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/gtk+/3.4/gtk+-3.4.4.tar.xz)

+1.   I have seen a couple of such messages from the same email id.

I don't know if mailman support an out of box filter.  In the past I
have logged into the mailing list and put my email id on hold i.e. I
don't receive messages so my vacation auto responder does not flood
all the mailing lists I am part of :)

<treading on thin ice>

We could put in guidelines to request members to put their accounts on
hold when they turn on their vacation auto responders.

Yes, but there are more appropriate tools for DTP viz. scribus.

Hi ILUGC,

     Sorry for the delayed response.

The software vendor is Insta Hospital Management Solutions.
http://www.instahealthsolutions.com/
The software is not open source. However it has been deployed on a
Ubuntu 8.04 server, which has not been updated. Although they do give
root access to the system. Which was how I was able to  these details.
I didn't update the system either lest some dependencies should fail
to work.

My blog post regarding the same is getting ready. Will be out soon.

With Regards,
~~Kumaran R

Depends.

I did this in OOO 2.x
http://vpmthane.org/pub%20-%20research%20vol%202005-6/VNBMem-Vilas.pdf

Except the Colour Cover. It rocked as the document went from 100 to
500 pages to its form now. Some of the stuff I used -- Styles, auto
generation of TOC, Multiple column layout, inline and framed
images/boxes, line drawings using draw, charts, page styles etc. The
Navigator (F5 key) was absolutely useful. I can go on and on.

This document was purely monochrome. except for couple of pages.

But if you are looking at 4 color stuff, .001 pt accuracy et. al. +1 to scribus

Tremendous work.   I retired from writing code a long time ago  but
with your book I might just start writing small programs again  :)

I realize you have taken care to proof read, still there are a few
typos some of which spell check should have caught.

What tool did you use to generate the book?   With docbook (or latex),
your content is plain text and one can use ispell to interactively
correct spelling errors.

Contact me offline to explore further publishing ops. in case you are
interested.

Best,

Thank you Sir..
Scribus was not rendering Tamil fonts correctly. Hence, I planned to switch
over..
Inkscape is a good solution!

Up to my knowledge latex is more often used in vast documentation areas and
book publishers.

Unlike Office suites, LaTex is not a WYSIWYG way of creating the document.
Rather you write markups and styles, (think of HTML and CSS) and then you
export it to PDF or other formats to view it.

With LaTeX, you can do much complex things, like complex mathematical

Lyx provides a sorta WYSIWYG.

LaTex is very mature and has tons of addons, extensions etc. as it has
been around for a very long time. It  is a derivative of TeX
(pronounced as tek -- the last letter is supposed to be the greek chi)
and designed by none other than Donald G Knuth.

The input is pure text (images\drawings originally were in EPS format,
again pure text).

Has a learning curve. but worth it.

Open/Libre office Math can do that too.

Really? Things like multiple levels of superscripts, absolute positioning
of individual characters (like in the way how LaTeX is usually written) are
possible in Libre Office?

nice work.

one think I would try see in such books is to take up a simple 
application idea & show implemeting them with the lang.

try if you could bring it out in next release.

django poll app is an example: 
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/

just a suggestion.

Equation 2 in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LaTeX_Output.svg ?
And the way the word "LaTex" is written, with 'A' and 'E' out of regular
position, as you can see in the above image too.

OK, I understand the issue better now.

Out of curiosity, has anyone used Docbook to render Tamil or any other
Indic fonts?  Please share your experience.
(I realize the tags would have to be in English and the automatic
numbers  may be still be rendered in English).

I tried a similar thing with OOwriter back in 1Q/2009 (don't recall
the version number).    However, the book had a *lot* of screenshots;
as it was end use oriented.

OOwriter could not handle it; it would take ages to load and save changes.

I asked my staff to switch to Docbook.  At first there were protests
but upon insistence, it it took them about 5 days to get the hang of
it.  After the switch it was possible to script the entire post
production of the document.  Downside, it is *not* WYSIWYG but then it
tickles your brain to imagine what you want the out put to look like
and then put in the relevant tags.   After this experience, they did
not want to use any WYSIWYG for tech. papers/documents :)

Hi Kumaran,

Great job and congrats on your joint efforts to close the windows and
open the doors for the hospital suite.

One suggestion, please following the mailing list guidelines.

Specifically:

1. Do *not* top post
2. Trim your postings with only the relevant portion you are commenting on.

Most FOSS mailing lists follow the above and it is best change the
habit sooner than later.

Best,

I do not think it is a big issue. One can always turn off graphic
display, using toosl>options>LibreOffice Writer>View and uncheck
graphics and objects.

The slowness could also be caused if the image is not "inline" i.e not
actually inserted from file and rather using copy-paste.

Perhaps we can revisit it sometime. :)

Inkscape is great but is limited to a single page. You will have to use a
separate file for each page of your document. This is not feature issue
with Inkscape, but it is it's nature. Inkscape is a SVG editor and SVG does
not support multiple pages.

Inkscape works best to design logos and icons. Also single page brochures.
Scribus provides much better DTP (read text handling) capability.

Message-ID: <CALK=M4acooivx3jNQQOZLQUohCq+YU2=qodjgFCThpgZyHmgfg@mail.gmail.com>

hello,
        1. The problem is with my desktop.
        2. I have installed windows7(long ago) and ubuntu12.04 in it.
        3. ubuntu is the 2nd installed one.
        4. Recently I wanted to repartition my hard disks while trying that
I accidentally deleted the partition that contains the ubuntu 12.04.
        5. Now the problem is that ubuntu GRUB is the default loader which
I deleted.
        6. Inside which the windows loader is present.
        7. Now the grub is not loading...
        8. The system is showing " error:unknown file system ".   and
showing a prompt as  " grub rescue> "
        9. I googled about it in the internet and tried some commands.
       10. But it requires the GRUB to be present atleast in another
partition.
       11. But I have totally deleted every thing. now what can I do.?
       12. I have also tried to install windows7 but it shows same error..
  " error:unknown file system " and again the prompt comes.
        13.Is there any solution for this..?

 Well, probably the equation is pretty simple. I believe there are complex
equations that cannot be represented in Libre/Open Office but can be in
LaTeX. But I'm not an expert with either of them to be so sure.

LibreOffice supports importing of MathML.
You could create the most complex formulas with MathML too.

So, shall we desist from making "forward-looking-eat-one's-foot" type
statements in future and stick to facts? Or add a
ignorance/speculation/opinion disclaimer at least?

Of course, everybody is free to believe in anything. and Of Course, it
is fine if one is unaware.

An instance of ODF dicument such as .odt, .ods etc _is_ an XML document.

Just rename it to a zip file, extract it and see.

So document corruption is relatively rare and many times recoverable.

So the problem is *not* with the desktop (as you assert in point 1)

Which commands exactly did you try?  so that we do not repeat the same

A fresh install of Windows should have overwriten the MBR and point to
it's boot loader on C:\, something must have gone wrong in your
install process.

Hopefully you have a small partition of say 2 GB of disk space (no
swap).  Install ubuntu server minimal.  This would restore your grub
along with the Windows in the menu.   You can then boot Windows
(assuming it is not brain damaged - see above comment)  and do 'fdisk
/mbr'  from the CLI.

The error message is saying that something is undefined, probably

I recently came across this post from Slashdot which suspects the nature of
MySQL Database server being turned into Closed source from Open Source.
Here is the link:-
http://developers.slashdot.org/story/12/08/18/0152237/is-mysql-slowly-turning-closed-source

I think this is definitely not a good news for a lot of community and

I have been shouting at every place since 2009 that one should choose
PostgreSQL instead of MySQL for serious projects for two reasons: 1.
technical superiority
2. impending takeover of Sun by Oracle.

At the time I migrated from MS-SQL to PostgreSQL against a lot of
opposition for PostgreSQL from developers and Management.

A few listened.

Lets look at this as a great opportunity to dive into MySQL to
PostgreSQL migrations for all upcoming professionals and entrenched
ones too. (Silly, Its mostly production systems, of course money is
involved here  and yeah I am interested)

They are happy and sleeping peacefully now.

We inherited the half baked OOwriter document from the client (done by
it's previous vendor).
I do not recall the details of our working.  However, I had instructed
them to pull in the screenshots  through the "Insert>Picture>From
File.for graphics.  We also tried a "master" document approach.

See above.

Thanks,  but it is not worth while spending any further time on it.
Libreoffice has a long way or perhaps it was a pilot error on our
part.    At that time, I solved my issue with converting to DocBook.
 I have used DocBook on and off for 12 years now and I am comfortable
with it's workings.   Their mailing list is very active and have found
solutions to my issues searching through the archives.

Hi all,

I have read several articles regarding the comparison of Gnome, KDE and
Unity. But, Still, I could not come to a conclusion on which one to suggest
as a desktop environment.. All three are awesome.

For people who came to Linux, bored on Windows Methods, Unity and Gnome
seem to be attractive.

For people using Windows for a long time, KDE almost looks like Windows.
Hence, it may be similar and easy to adapt.

Which one suits more for begineers?
Which one is for experts?

And which one has the capability of turning more people towards Linux?
Please offer your comments.

Mageia 2 with KDE, as most things in Mageia resembles Windows and I
have switched to it now and also recommend it for beginners.

Which commands exactly did you try?  so that we do not repeat the same
solutions to you.

velmurugan:- I have tried prefix, ls   commands. But these commands are
useful only when GRUB is present in any of hard disks. But I said that I
deleted the partition. so these commands won't help that's what I'm saying.

 Hopefully you have a small partition of say 2 GB of disk space (no
swap).  Install ubuntu server minimal.  This would restore your grub
along with the Windows in the menu.   You can then boot Windows
(assuming it is not brain damaged - see above comment)  and do 'fdisk
/mbr'  from the CLI.

velmurugan:- I have allocated 11GB or more for that.


A fresh install of Windows should have overwriten the MBR and point to

velmurugan: I tried to install win7 but the process didn't even started..
Boot from CD/DVD option didn't worked. It worked for ubuntu(12.04) But I
opted to quit the installation.

One main advantage of LaTeX is the visual output.

In short, you need to use:

  $ cmake .
  $ make

| I dont understand the terms.

Do some homework first. Read the README, BUILDING files in the sources
on how to build the project. Also read:

  http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake_tutorial.html

  http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake

Learn to use a search engine to understand terminology, and tools that
you don't know.

Write to the list only if nothing else works. When you write, you
should also explain what attempts you have made to solve the problem
in the first place.

*Here is What I did and What I got: *

aalunga at ARUN:~/DeskDocs/S$ ./configure

Scribus uses the CMake (http://www.cmake.org) buildsystem instead of
configure.
CMake uses different options than configure, but some have direct
equivalents:
   <srcdir>           : the source directory
   --prefix=<dir>     : -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<dir>
Once CMake has run successfully, you can use "make edit_cache" to view and
modify all settings.

Your current configure options translate more or less to:
   cmake . ; make ; make install

Read the output! You are again not following instructions. Did you do
some homework on finding which package is required to be installed for

@Bharathi:

I have already visited UCH (probably 3 years before) and really got
excited by the performance of those children using Linux.  I already
assured them to setup GNU/Linux in all the systems and I have not
heard after that.

Again I wish to spend some time with those children and I am ready to
help them to setup a Mageia 2 GNU/Linux based server/client system.

@Prasanna Venkatesh / PuduvaiLUG:

As UCH is very close to Pondicherry, I hope PuduvaiLug can give better
support for UCH.

I am much concerned about the alignment of words and paragraphs in a
document , which may end within a page or run to 150 pages.
Can LaTex Help me in this regard?

One good example is a manual or a book with multiple chapters. This is what
I call a compilation, especially when different chapters have different
authors. The whole compilation needs an uniform look and feel. One example
is the format of a note or a symbol giving a warning, foot noting etc. For
a large compilation, it is too laborious to check uniformity in word
processors even if it came from the same source. The person compiling can
ensure uniformity when he uses tools like Latex.

I hope you mean adopt KDE.  Adapting KDE to look like Windows (theme
wise) is not that attractive (Windows 95 widgets).

IMO, no difference whether user is a beginner or expert.

** It is in the mind set**

My observation about "experts", shall we say power users on Windows,
migrating to the Linux desktop;  their expectation is that the Linux
desktop settings and configuration should be the same as in Windows.
They nit pick and  cite the "learning curve" etc.  rather than accept
the Desktop FWIW and learn how to use it with a fresh mind.

Whereas the n00b or the completely un-initiated person (to desktop) is
more receptive.   I have done a couple of "Intro to desktop computing"
sessions with kids (10-14 years) from under privileged background.  I
asked my engineer (who was teaching the workshop) to switch the
Desktop each week.   Started with KDE, then GNOME, then XFCE, then
IceWM.  Within 30-45 mins. they got the hang of how to navigate.

> And which one has the capability of turning more people towards Linux?

It depends on what the people want to do.   GNOME and KDE both have a
plethora of applets.

There is NO universally applicable answer to this question. For
beginners, gnome shell may suit better as it presents a clean and
clutter free desktop. Experts may prefer KDE as it offers a lot of
customization options.

In general the answer to this question depends on what kind of person
the user is. Some people get excited about new designs and new ways of
doing things. They like to explore all things new. For them Gnome or
unity will offer a new experience away from Windows, which will get
them interested.

Then there are people who are stubborn and refuse to use learn
anything new, they want everything to work as they want and in the
only way they know (as in windows). For these kind of people, KDE is a
better solution (or may be cinnamon). (Warning: Do not introduce them
to Gnome, they will stop using linux the moment they realise that
there is no 'My Computer' icon on the desktop or no right click on the
desktop). Some people cannot live without constantly 'refreshing' the
desktop every 5 mins. I cannot recommend anything to them.

In the end it all boils down to the applications installed. After
playing around with the desktop, changing wallpapers and themes,
people need to get their work done. There should be a proper suit of
applications to fulfill their needs.

Fair enough.  However cite the articles and tell us what parts you do
not understand.  At this point your request for help is a broad sweep.

You don't have to be a programmer to use the command line.
Overcome your phobia and ye shall find nirvana @ the CLI end of the
tunnel.  No pain No Gain.
Suggest you keep a copy of the  O'Reilly "Linux in a Nutshell" handy.
 It has organized the tools in sections per their functionality.

This is fine and OK for the end user.   You are trying to move to the
next level, especially in the case of the Scribus with Unicode
support.

1. Open a terminal and play around (except for cd /; rm -fr *)
2. Learn to use man <tool>.    When the information is available in
the man pages right in your own computer why get it second hand?
3. experiment and read the warnings/errors carefully.  For sysadmin
activity read the log files.   The applications will give you enough
information as to what is wrong.

I am aware of it.

But being somewhat a purist, and having led an Oracle team (back in
5.x and 7.x days), I found postgres nearest hit. SAP DB, sqlite etc
were in my mind. At the time the Geo-location datatype was available
only in Postgres and is a fairly clean follower of Codd's Rules.

Ok, As a disclaimer, I would say I am a bit biased here having tasted
production successa. :)

Actually in the last few days I have been playing around with sqlite
which I found quite fine for apps upto say 50-100 users or so.

Dear All,

Postfix with quota is working fine on postfix-2.8.8-1.


I installed squirrelmail plugin vaction and autoresponder in centos5.4
x86_64. I configured everything (proftpd & ldap). In that, i select the
option vaction message. so it will not deliver to sender.

I don't unerstand what you mean by documents --  short documents or
long documents?

Would you rate a six pane brochure as a long / short / simple /
complex document?

What you are probably referring to are the bibligraphic elements,
cross referencing, auto-build of TOC, TOF, TOT, Index, Table of
citations, Tableof authorities etc.

I have been doing all the above on an off from wordperfect 5.1 (yes
DOS) / Ventura punlisher days. I still have manuals of WP, Ventura,
Quattro pro etc.

Unix was expensive then and Linux was not available, Internet came to
India much later.

While not being a fanboi of any of the product that you mentioned, I
would tend to disagree as I have successfully incorporated those from
DOS on 386 with 4mb RAM days.

Not to mention the LO or OO. I did a 100+ page document of a book with
german, english, sanskrit rendered in roman with diacritical marks in
MS Word 6.0 under WFW 3.11.

If the issue is better laid out then we can discuss and make a useful
Decision tree for choosing the right tool.

Ok, I am not able to lay my grubby hands on that ever moving ubuntu box ;)

On Centos 6.3:

I did bump into imagemagick as one of the posters pointed out. It is a
swiss army knife. And it produces humongous file sizes.

Then there is a pdftk.

and both are multi-platform. That helps me a bit to script out the tasks.

Currently off that task for few days. will update

I meant short documents. I did explain what I meant by a compilation later.
I've also done these on WP, WS, MS Word and OO too. One is talking of
relative ease and not whether it is feasible or not. It is easier for
compiling large sets of documents.

Sir, I never said or claimed that Open Office or Libre Office cannot do
that!!
In fact, I type documents/ reports in Libre Office only atleast for the
past 2 years.

I have successfully created documents of 150 pages with many sections (Few
with Portrait and few with Landscape), auto TOC, Conditional Page
Numbering, and many more.. [I could not do everything with MS Office but,
with Libre Office, everything could be done]

Now, since I have heard about a new term "LaTeX", I am a bit curious on how
it would help me or whether it will simplify or complicate the work.

Arun,

Since you are hearing Latex for the first time, you might feel
addictive to this tool in the coming days.

Message-ID: <CANSdqMr1JAw32o_CgMX5v4xF6OzJnAXQW5gFxg_-zbcUqu=OWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

My friend has a Acer Laptop with Windows 7 (which he loaded recently). We
tried to install Ubuntu 12.04 alongside and dual boot the Laptop.

After rebooting the System, during installation, The System shuts down
automatically after displaying an error message as shown below:

"Critical Temperature reached 103 C. Shutting Down"

We have tried a dozen of times both through Windows Installer and for fresh
installation. But, the same error persists.
But, the Laptop boots into Windows normally. Only on selecting Ubuntu, the
error occurs.
*
Why is this problem occurring? How can we  eliminate it?*
Please guide us. Thank you in advance.

You should check the bios for the temperatures, it might be an actual issue
like processor
not being seated properly or heat sink being loose.

I don't know to read/write Tamil but hopefully you will take comment
on the web site.

The pictures, in the slide show, are great.   However the left/right
arrows mar their beauty.   Is there a way to disable the arrow images
and show them only when the mouse cursor is in the image area?

Nothing apart from the file utility claiming that it is a Flash Video file.

I think nautilus or other Gnome applications use gstreamer,  through
totem-video-thumbnailer to do that.

Hi!

I'm in town for a project and having a tough time procuring components
through my client's hardware vendors.  (1 week, and I've not even got quotes
for most items.)

Can you recommend any hardware vendors who are prompt and capable of sourcing
products from multiple manufacturers/distributors. (And not solely interested
in pushing whatever stock he has lying around.)

TIA,

Obtaining hardware in India is a constant challenge.

I wanted a simple multiport ethernet mobo or a card and I know how
hard it is to obtain.

Even simple things are not available.

The best option is to find out a friend living in Singapore or Taiwan
or US to ship it to you.

Or as some people do, directly order from abroad and pay for customs,
shipping etc.

This situation will not change because very few people in India buy
special hardware.

Hello,

This is Sriram, Third Year CSE Student from Arunai Engineering College,
Tiruvannamalai. My College is planning to organize an one-day event to
celebrate Software Freedom Day.

Obviously, they will invite someone to talk or give a demonstration on Open
Source Software. But, I want to know what else we can do to make the event
interesting and innovative. For instance, we are planning to arrange booths
in which we will create Live USB Keys of Ubuntu and Fedora.

Any other ideas?

Add Mageia 2 GNU/Linux.  I can provide Install/Live ISO's and repos
for 32/64 bit (about 80+ GB) and it will definitely attract the
participants.

            GNU/Linux User Group Of TCE(Thiagarajar College of Engg.
Madurai), and the GNU/Linux User Group  - Madurai have been
celebrating FStival, in commemoration  of the software freedom day for
about 7-8 years now. This is how it is done there.

1) First, they create pamphlets and posters, and spread the word to
schools and colleges nearby. The posters are also pasted in all
prominent places in colleges.
2) On the day of the event, they organise "demo stalls" - They are
classified into various categories like day-to-day, type setting etc,
programming and development etc. Students volunteer to handle these
stalls and there by learn these tools well, and demo it.
3) In parallel, there will be demo of installations of Ubuntu/Fedora.
4) There will be booths where we burn images of various distros for
the guests(They need to bring blank disks).
5) There will be talks on various topics(by volunteers, so the topics
are decided by the speakers).

So, you can start with some of these, and over the years, do other
things as well. All the best. Thanks

Here is an idea I think will be good to try out.

1. Give some tutorials on using any source code management system
(SCM) such as Git or Mercurial. The general opinion is that mercurial
is simpler and easier to learn, while git is more flexible and
powerful. So Mercurial maybe a good choice for intro to beginners.

2. Once the basic concepts are explained, try to organize and create a
collaborative software.

The software MUST NOT be a full featured application. The goal IS NOT
creating opensource project, but to introduce people to collaborative
development. The program must finished in the allotted time.

Here is an example, by now almost everyone will be familiar with some
basics in C or C++.

Create a program simple console application (say a calculator).
A menu is displayed.

1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
etc etc

The user selects the function by entering a number. The corresponding
function is called. Simple as that.
Now every participant can be assigned a function to work on, while
someone manages the menu.

People will get some hands-on experience.

You can always take it further from here. At the end of the day, you
can brainstorm some opensource project, gather volunteers and start
something in github or bitbucket etc.

Message-ID: <CAFe1ooKvJTU5B1R5XJR8Mf0CQojzm9KpOfwhiS2U=gO8JMD=Ew@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying out a FreeSWITCH based VoIP system. There is a considerable,
around 1.5 seconds lag on the audio. Some improvement was seen when the
server was switched from an Amazon EC2 small instance to an Amazon EC2
medium instance. Considering India specific customers and usage, is it
reasonable to assume that I will get substantial improvement by moving to a
dedicated server (quad code, 4GB RAM) based geographically inside India?
Can anyone throw some light on this? Also would like to get recommendations
to an India based dedicated server provider. Thanks.

dear sriram,

most of the time, FOSS events are getting confined to CS / IT. you
could use the demo stalls to attract other depts : e.g., Scilab,
Octave, QCAD. Hope you can talk to some of the friends in other depts
to entice them or go thru you HoD.

other demos could be
(a) check thru sites of the projects like Sahana -- some modules, eg.,
to locate mssing persons, could be customised to deploy during Deepam
Festival. you could make a start on this : let the people view the
demo and get some interested persons involved.

(b) software for schools : geogebra, etc. -- you will get good samples
from OSCAR project of IIT Mumbai, HBCSE, etc. [if there is interest,
you can contact them directly or I can put you thru. Please check with
Prof Chellatamilan, if need be.] Since you have got an associated CBSE
school, you could invite the students for demo stall.

with best wishes
Srinivasan.
CDAC Chennai.

Yup - this thing works, if not for the money, atleast it gives you the
satisfaction.
I recently was approached by BBC Worldwide for one of my clicks - gave it

Message-ID: <CACm7z1YCOSpXuxg=YRxNgfoRq9_1vxH-n_Av-LNb+RxRSFduTw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Objective:- I need to view web pages in my smartphone. The Web-pages are in
my laptop running Apache Web-server inside the directory "/var/www/html"

Operating System:- Fedora 16

1. I have a D-Link Wireless Router which is connected to Internet.
2. Connected both Laptop and Smartphone wireless to the router to access
internet, so they are in same wireless local network.
3. I have set static Ip for my laptop as "192.168.1.3" and the default
gateway is the ip address of my router " 192.168.1.1", 8.8.8.8 as DNS

Problem:- I am not able to access "http://192.168.1.3/index.html" from
smartphone's browser, it says " Cannot connect to server". Whereas the same
address works locally in laptop's browser. I do not have another Laptop or
computer to test if it works in that.

Is there anything am doing wrong? Do i need to configure Apache?
I have turned SELinux disabled.

Hello,

I am trying out the new Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit server. I find the scripts in init.d are not starting up on boot. The permissions are correct. I can manually start with service <servicename> start (whereever service works) or /etc/init.d/scriptname start.

The last version I used was 10.04 server and have never experienced this issue on any other distro before.

Regards,

Mahadevan

You should look around in the drupal bug tracker. And drupal mailing
list are more suitable for these kind of questions as the people there
are more likely to use drupal day to day. There would be drupal people
of this list but very few so you'll have less chances of getting
information here.

Assuming only your manually added script is not running,
did you run `update-rc.d`?

In case you haven't seen the forwarded message below already.  I think
there are some 15 people in Chennai (don't know them), and some 45 in
Bangalore who have already registered.

Registrations close this Monday, so if you're interested sign up.
Maybe someone can organize a study group in Chennai too.

The issue is solved, thank you very much. It was not only manual scripts I added, but also apache2 and mysql and others installed with apt-get. 

I did 
sudo update-rc.d -f apache2 remove
sudo update-rc.d apache2 defaults?
reboot

I did this on the zimbra server to enable ldaps.

followed the link  http://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/How_to_enable_ldaps

>> ldapsearch -x -v -H 'ldaps://mail.domain.com/' -b
>> 'ou=people,dc=domain,dc=com'  -D
>> 'uid=test1,ou=people,dc=domain,dc=com' -W -d -1


If I run the above command within the zimbra server, it works well.
i.e it gives all the entries in the ldap server.

If I run the same command from any other machine aka my laptop,
It ends with an error.

TLS: peer cert untrusted or revoked (0x42)
TLS: can't connect: (unknown error code).
ldap_err2string
ldap_sasl_bind(SIMPLE): Can't contact LDAP server (-1)


> -ZZ is missing see above.

adding -ZZ gives the same error.

I can connect it via telnet

telnet <ipNumber> 636

gives the same output as above.

/etc/openldap/ldap.conf is for server side only.

Can not find the file slapd.conf in my zimbra server.

If you just want to run unetbootin, right click the file, in
properties/permissions tab give permission to execute it as a program.
Double click it, it'll run:-)

Message-ID: <CAND2795EK16Qs1jYzAJ6_cDiJE_usuMbpeE_iOAWLjR_UyQHaA@mail.gmail.com>

<snip>
When you post a photo to Instagram, you retain the rights, Instagram
gets to use it, and that?s that ? legally, your photo isn?t supposed
to appear anywhere else. But while Instagram gains users, the users
share more photos, and those photos increasingly appear on Tumblr and
other outlets, there?s still no easy way to organize the rights.

Although some users ? especially professional photographers ? are
concerned that Instagram?s licensing agreement amounts to a rights
grab, others, like Philip Neustrom, are looking to make their images
more free, not less. Neustrom created I Am CC, a service that
automatically releases your photos under Creative Commons license.

To the best of my knowledge (openldap mailing list), port 636 although
supported, the recommendation is to use port 389 with StartTLS; rather
than having two ports open.

<http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/185.html>

What does

                 "nmap -PN <your zimbra server>"

show?


The ldapsearch command, from the "foreign" system, may be defaulting
to port 389.   Try -p 636 to specify the port.

Also, I believe this foreign machine has to know about the CA that has
issued the cert. being used by  Zimbra.  The client is complaining
about untrusted cert.

Listed at the end are the search strings I used.   Searches throw
quite a few links on this problem.

What is your base OS?

Again, to the best of my knowledge slapd.conf is the server side
config. in openldap.

In Ubuntu 10.04: pkg name is slapd version 2.4.21
.
Try 'find /etc -iname slapd.conf'  and see if anything surfaces.

If /etc/openldap/ldap.conf is the only file, then the Zimbra team has
modified config files for openldap; I would suggest search and/or post
to the Zimbra forums/lists.

Alternately, you can configure openldap package from the base OS and
tell Zimbra to use it as the LDAP server.
<http://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/LDAP_Authentication>

[1] Search string "TLS: peer cert untrusted or revoked (0x42)"
[2] Search string "openldap use of port 636"

Hello people,

Saw I love Ruby digest Aug 18 just today. Ya there are typos, I think I
have fixed it. You can mail errors to mindaslab at gmail.com and I will be
happy to fix it. The book corrected with errors I have found is now
available at http://is.gd/r2012

I am updating the book on a weekly basis now. But who knows i am lazy and
might stop it any time. The book was written with libre office (i don't
know what doc book or latex is).

And ya, I think I have copyright for the pictures as both Shreya and
Anushka had proposed to me, but then I got bored and rejected them. ;-)
They sent me those images in proposal email.

Having someone's picture does not give you copyright.  Unless they
gave you specific written permission to publish them in public forums,
you have no right to put them in your book.

> had proposed to me, but then I got bored and rejected them. ;-)

That is a personal matter; please do not discuss them here; respect
their privacy.

> They sent me those images in proposal email.

Most likely in good faith that you would respect their privacy and not
circulate them in public.
Receiving them by email does not give you implicit permission to do
whatever you want with it.

I would suggest find some unencumbered alternate pics. for your book.

Ha ha. This is seriously funny. Someone cracking a joke and then
someone else replying
 such that the joke is not apparently understood. ;)

Anyway I could not help smiling. It is a nice stroke of humor.

Well done.

Hi,

I hope you folks already heard about chamba open movie project. If not
you can learn more about it here http://www.chambaproject.in/wiki/

Tomorrow (26th Aug Sunday) we are meeting near Shaniwar wada to work
on storyboard (it is one of the steps in animation movie making where
each scene is drawn on paper by hand). More details about the meeting
here.

http://www.chambaproject.in/wiki/index.php/Meetings/2012Aug26#Pune

You can also join in if you like drawing. You can bring any of your
friends who are interested in drawing or animation as well. Or you can
simply come down and learn more about chamba project and also see how
an animation movie is being made -- all the behind the scene fun and
excitement :) You won't often get to see how a movie is made.

If you can't come down physically, you can join online too via IRC.
Our channel is #chamba on FreeNode. If you are new to irc use this
link http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=chamba

Current status of the story board can be seen at

Its funny if taken in a funny way, Will the same fun continue for OP If the
author name is ripped off and put someone's
name, and sold in some market as a ruby guide?.

Giving things for free (both as beer and freedom) does not give right to a
person to steal other's work, may it be artistic or intellectual.

The OP has given his dedication and time to make this book, which is
already a good effort, why screw it?

OK, the jokes on me for not catching on with the names :)

Nonetheless even though this list is Chennai LUG, it is public domain
and archived in places like gmane for instance.

What may be local humor may not be understood by the global audience.

+1 Totally agree.

There is also the issue of the cover page on the book.   I hope the OP
can prove that he owns the copyright to it.

+1 - a moment of weakness should not eclipse the content.

Greetings,

Disclaimer: This is a query from an ignorant/muddled myself

I am trying to accomplish the following:

Write a small application which will allow data verification/data
entry with sources from scanned images.

My requirements:
This application should be portable across platforms
This application should be self contained.
It should show the fields allowing validation
It should show multi-page tiff/PDF files on one side (left, right, top
or bottom) of the data entry form
(The fields in the form can be in any page of the multipage images)
The tiff/pdf files are residing as files in a multiple locations (on
local or network storage-- nfs or cifs) with the record number as
their names
It should not assume that anything other than a minimal O/S with GUI
is installed
I should be as small as possible and should not require
root/administrator privilege (I am using sqlite as the database)
Runtime environment will be purely userspace.
Installation has to be done as a normal user and _not_ superuser

I am avoiding Java. There has to be a simpler way (Logic: If sqlite
can serve my purpose of RDBMS, there should be a simpler way for
forms)

Effectively, the application footprint on the disk will be four to five files:
Application itself (executable)
Database file (containing the records)
Shared objects/DLL to handle PDF and TIFF files
Configuration file (to contain location pointers to the location of
the Tiff/PDF files)
Optionally, a lookup table for record number to tiff/pdf filename

Web based could be an option. but cannot guarantee installation of
much software on webserver.

I working on libreoffice as an option, but
1. I have this gut feeling that such an overkill is not neccesary and
Base requires Java and sqlite connector is a slight pain
2. Installing Libreoffice may not be possible always

Any ideas, suggestions?

(<sigh> Really miss the good old days of simplicity where applications
size were much smaller than data</sigh>)

Silly question: will the jquery etc serve the purpose? (no fancy Input
here only numbers and strings -- not even dates)

TIA

I am glad you caught the bug :)

INR 55 maybe the official rate - purchase reality is around INR 60

OK, here is how I own the copyright of  the image. If you compare Bhrama
gupta's genes and mine they are very similar, hence I am related to him. He
invented zero and these photographs use them without paying me a dime,
hence I can sue them back if they can sue me ;-)

And if you want to know how these girls proposed to me, go and ask
questions in their fan page. :-))

This group is really funny. Any way added some correction to Regular
Expressions chapter ad this book is available in http://is.gd/r2012 with
updates.

And ya, if some one want to rip my name and put up theirs and sell this,
they are perfectly welcome. This book is released under GFDL. So please
share it and modify it as you wish.

You can't license something you don't own the rights to under GFDL or any
other license.

By your extension of 0s and 1s, you should try publishing every commercial
software and latest movies release in the same manner and see how long before
you get picked up under the Goondas Act.

When people point out that you are wrong, the smart thing is to accept the
feedback and fix it. Justifying your position with bogus reasons and
illogical statements, only make you look immature and silly. And people do
judge a book by it's cover, so you've already turned off a lot of potential
readers with your mails/arguments in this thread.

Try this in a court of law in case you get sued for copyright
violation, your logic and winking will not help *one bit.*

Under GFDL any derivative work has to be attributed to you, so you
have ensured the glory of your name in any derivative but have no
qualms about using other's copyright work in your book.

@ Kingsly - very well said.

My last post on this thread -  if OP does *not* get the message then

Well, no photo copying shop could operate if these are seriously taken. ;-)

Since there are copyright laws in existing world, we claim that right 
and then leave it to others wilfully, as that is how it can be done, 
legally.

Own it to disown.

If sqlite is not mandatory, give Couchapps a shot. Looks like it will be

Thanks for the reply. Looks nice

But links returned by google and download page (http://couch.io/get)
seems to be down.

Is it one of those abandonware?

And I already have about 40 MB of CSV files as data.

Simple tabular data.

A small example: imagine the data displayed using Excel Data>Form in
one window and Another displaying the tiff/PDF contents.

I know Libreoffice requires a extension for the Data>Form Excel
functionality and have used it.

One of the major issues I run into is of installation without
root/Administrator rights.

CouchApp will require python.

Will the developed application run from the pendrive?

Try this link: couchapp.org

Its a rather simple python script that outputs a couchdb design doc (I
think!) so there's not much to keep tinkering with it. So, its age does not
matter.

Couchapp requires python but once you develop the app and convert it to a
design doc, its just a couchdb db with a design doc.

You'll need to have couchdb installed on the machine on which it will run.

Can this whole bundle be installed in a pendrive, taken from an ubuntu
to a centos or xp box or a win7 box and run without any installation
as it is not possible to install *anything* on the box (reasons:
Corporate IT Policies, password not known and the such)  into which
this pendrive is plugged in?

I had in mind windows apps like irfanview/notepad++ "portable".

Is it possible to pool in some ideas to develop a methodology of
making "portable" application, its requirements, packaging,
development framework and the such?

I will pool in whatever ideas I have tried and implemented
successfully and unsuccessfully in the past.

Most of the installation nowadays spray files all over the place and
sometimes "pollute" the installed base.

Cool it. Everybody in the list wished you well and appreciated your effort.
The only advise was for a seriously bizarre cover page. Obviously you think
it is OK and normal to have an actress as a cover page for a technical book
forget copyright issues. It is beyond argument. All the best.

Watch your attitude and words. you are lucky I am in a good mood today.

I do not want to start a flame war here.

Suffice to say that it is this level of arrogance with a cretin level
IQ is what is making serious s/w developers a rarity.

All you have done is banged up a few words, do a bunch of copy paste,
put in a licence and call it some work.

Look at my other post regarding cross platform portable application
and take up that challenge. I doubt you will as you simply do not have
it in you.

Stop puking nonsense on this list.

When you build from source, a well designed 'make install' will put
everything under the
/usr/local/ dir. structure.

A similar philosophy could be adopted for your scenario.

The problem is with the other OSs or rather convincing their powers to
be, to put in place, a similar structure.

Are you referring to all OSs in general or a specific OS?

Thanks a lot for weighing in.

More or less,  that is what I had in my mind. just as kernel
compilation allows various options

A RAD tool for a simple app as this where only things which are
required are packaged in a neat little directory would definitely help
in knocking quick and dirty small apps without going through a whole
lot of wrestling /relearning with minefield of arcane semantics of
semicolons and colons in the landscape of the "latest and greatest"
languages which prop up every now and then. :)

As it is %,$,*,.  are enough to give/get a divorce. :)

But the part "a well designed 'make install'" is sometimes tricky in
the world of Open source in the fringe application areas at least. One
such experience was when I was trying to convert a PDF to flipbook
with page curls... It is a bit of WIP now..
of course swftools did help in flip book there. but the "page curl"
thing did me in.

Sometimes I wonder if many of the software developers ever understood
the concept of code cohesion or "small is beautiful" or KISS principle
or robustness or reliability or "utility computing" or "bird's eye
view of the problem" at all.

I wonder if many of the software developers are Engineers at all or at
least aware of the principles of engineering at all.

Apropos, to convince the powers to be in open source is more or less a
lifetime mission.

When do we deliver on time then?

I have faced this issue in (of course) windows more frequently.

In the Centos world, for some apps, where no native packages were
available, like mysql workbench for centos 5 (Incidentally for Centos
6 though it is available -- Oracle Linux effect probably), I had gone
through the dependency hell. and generally any
config-make-make-install cycle has potential for such things, I would
guess.

I know that Centos is "ancient" by design as far as the version of
packages goes compared to other bleeding edge distros.

And yes they do spray files in man, bin, and the such in often distro
specific directories -- sometimes not in the places where one would
expect. and yeah, I do R a lot TFM. :)

As it is we have enough pains dealing with "I don't know anything
about computers" types who parade their android tricks and PHBs.

Apologies for all the whining.
I am sure you understand and empathise the labour pain a typical
technology consultant/solution provider has to go through _every_ day.

Copyright and sharing are not mutually exclusive. In fact, without
copyright protection, GNU GPL itself cannot be enforced!

By sharing one's email id as such in a publicly archived mailing list, you
are feeding spam bots. If you really want to share them, use munged form.

And, please do not cross-post.

ILUGC is not against copyright, but is against non-sharing of the copyrighted materials.

I am a member of this group for over 10 years. I don't remember to have seen such an UNCIVILIZED post. 

If the list is ready to ban someone for simple things like sending out-of-office or invitation-from-xyz kinds of post, in my opinion this post is worse than those and deserve same treatment.

No-one wants to see anything like Apple vs Samsung, including some 
judges. For the simple reason that it is petty and there are better 
things to do. Following is an article by US Federal judge after 
dismissing the Apple vs Motorola case.

http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/why-there-are-too-many-patents-in-america/259725/

But we cannot forget about copyright, this is the way the world works. 
So, We have created our own copyright ie., copyleft which gives us 
freedom within the system. So, my only suggestion is, don't ignore 
copyright because people looking at your work won't.

Good thought.  In future, I have planned to discuss more on the
Copyleft ideas / philosophy when talking about FOSS among the academic
community.

looks like you are loosing patience , nobody is trolling out here ,
there is a point which has been aptly put if the op does not
understand and is hell bent on behaving with an attitude at the wrong
end and place then nobody can help him.

We as a community also come with counter checks and balances so that
nobody out here behaves like a "rabid dog" , we have a responsibility
towards each other  to correct each other but if the other person does
not understand "to err is human" and take it from there then he will
be ostracized , which again is not correct way to treat civilized
human beings  since as community "contributors are priceless" as
members of the community we all belong to.

The github link has only ruby codes.
We need the source odt file.

Hi Karthikeyan A.K,

Please share the link of the odt file.

Yup, I agree that I Love Ruby is a Somalian Pirates book. No problem with
that. Those who want to use may,  those who do not saying many legal
reasons (or purity of soul) may not. That isn't my problem.

I just mailed this group in a hope that I will get mistakes spotted. But
all I get that some one some where wants to try me in court or some stuff
like that. OK it might not be in compatible GFDL. I will change the licence
to Kopimi or No Copyright so that one can be truly free rather than be
shackled by GFDL.

The book is totally disintegrated, a chapter here and there, I will gather
it, modify the master document so that things wont be left and release it
as zip. But it may take time, I can do only when I have mood for it, its a
huge work. Please try using PDF editor now to manage changes.

If you want to say anything about the book that really seriously needs
consideration, please try posting in its facebook page. Gmail sucks and I
don't know using this mailing list. Some one accused me of creating new
threads every time. I don't know how to bypass creating new threads, I used
the mailing list page and frankly it sucks and not user friendly and I
couldn't find don't create new thread settings.

Final Word: I Love Ruby  is a book I created for my self, personal
reference. Don't intend to make this effort come to a grinding halt
listening to too many rule enforcers. Its just a waste of time.

In Gmail, hit a reply to the mail you want to reply, trim the content
appropriately and interleave your replies. Ask if you have any
queries.

Dear Goswami,

I take back my words - sorry.

your explanation - particularly the second para - really really makes
sense. I do not know about all these.

Thanks for patiently writing back on this, aptly and very briefly.

sorry once again,

with warm regards

normally, though you may be the actor, writer, worker its the producer, 
publisher, employer who owns the copyright.

so, i can only say, if you ask them they would say ask the one who funds me.

one fine morning, what if shreya & anushka passes across me & I take a 
snap of them and use it? who owns the copyright, then? it becomes 
intrusion of privacy ;-)

at times, beyond abiding by laws & fighting within system - civil 
dis-obedience has helped :-)

we are presuming why not give them a chance, before jumping to conclusions.

again two different presumptions , so far i have seen kalyan verma
(http://kalyanvarma.net/)  is doing something in that direction again
his website says  it is under CC BY-NC-SA 2.5 , talking about the CC
as a license i still have to read
http://freeculture.org/blog/2012/08/27/stop-the-inclusion-of-proprietary-licenses-in-creative-commons-4-0/
in order to understand how it is inclusive or exclusive and what the
author is trying to point what is not ok in CC version 4.0 .

the picture i get is no matter what systems we are talking about they
are not perfect or still involving and Law of the land at large has
lots of mines and has catching up to do .

>> at times, beyond abiding by laws & fighting within system - civil
> dis-obedience has helped :-)

What is your suggestion give up taking pictures or using pictures :-)
, yes this is now becoming way OT we need to meetup sometime to talk
about it.

Very good application for file management to the entry level. The following
are the features listed.

1.There is no database available for this application.

2.The uploaded data are stored in the files folder (path:
/var/www/ajaxplorer/data/files)

3.You can create roles, users and assign rights according to the
requirement. Not sure how this users are maintained without DB.

4.If you have read only rights upload option will not be available.

5.You can set expire date for any files from viewing in the share option
and also the download counts.

6.Password options are also available for any files which will create an
url link to mail for some users.

7. Recycle option available.

I am not a developer to check in the code level. But I really impressed
with this application.

It's never too late to help out Kubuntu in the cycle Here's our work
items for this cycle.
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/quantal?searchtext=kubuntu

Some of the easier ones:

    track down and update install docs everywhere for having a USB/DVD
image but no CD image
    review kubuntu active for app selection and good experience
    Kubuntu Quantal Docs - carry on where top contributor LittleGirl
had to leave off
    Update ubiquity to match GTK frontend (the GTK frontend is getting
a load of features which will mean the alternate images can go away
like LVM partitioning)
    ensure OwnCloud juju charm works (we like owncloud here at Kubuntu)
    deal with Kubuntu unique strings now we aren't using Launchpad
(should be translated separately either in KDE or in Launchpad).

and many more

Subject: [Ilugc] Awesome
Message-ID: <CAFum4P=tVoKA53uL+gYBxkTN6X0RrhAScgkKCRXYhamH0Be1Ag@mail.gmail.com>

I came upon this window manager by chance on a sporadic mention by another
linux enthusiast. Used it for a day and switched to it completely.

It is very fast and so a boon on my netbook. Gnome applets work with it
too. Default has no window decoration and windows operations are all driven
by Meta key combinations. some key combos are cumbersome e.g. Shift+Meta+C
for close, more due to the closeness of these keys and the need to use 2
hands. I mapped the context sensitive menu key on the right side as an
additional meta key and using the WM was true to its name.

Awesome came as on offshoot idea of dwm to build a minimalistic WM... dwm
interface/ keybind customisation is done by changing the code and
recompiling it. Awesome does it by customising a Lua file.

This we checked thro' other connection. When we made con.commit then the
data is stored in MySql
We have not initiated any transaction or set autocommit=false. How MySql
switches to that mode?
Any help please.

Hi All,

Is there any command to know which process occupies more cpu,mem etc
for a week/month. ?

To be specific , by using "sar" with several options we can get the
details of whole server.

Like that can we get the details for a pid ? (Whole history of "top"
command for a week)

Whole week? Load average maybe. But there is no tool to do that unless
you use a network monitoring
 or server monitoring application like cactus, ganglia or many others.
Something starting with Z.

You have to use rrdtool and use top in batch mode (-b) and dump it and analyze.

I think it uses PHP serialization or something like that.

Reading thru the docs, it supports may auth models -- LDAP/AD,
htpasswd and so on and so forth.

Nor am I. I am just a dumb user.

I find it very interesting after going through a lot of hoops and
jumps across platforms, across sites, across people, across corporate
politics, through complicated DMS and being an open source fanboi that
at last some semblance of glue is there for the simple task like
fileshare which cuts across protocols (it seems to have "drivers" for
CIFS, FTP, webdav, SSL (sftp), NFS etc. etc.). All of them can appear
as a simple repository, or so it seems.

It even has a mysql driver.

imagine a small office (or for that matter a large corporate with say
> 1000 seats and their share of PHBs),  where there is a static IP
(with MTNL here it is about 2k / annum) exposed with this application,
one can access many shares with just a browser -- even on a portable
device like android.

This surely can make life of IT infra personnel much easier.

Have you installed latest hplip and related stuff?

I could not understand clearly your SMS lingo. please be definitive
and descriptive.
eg:

"its working fine but dont print text edit and black color" ???? (Does
it work or does it not?)

"...it ll print only color i change the setting also but it ll not
work " ???? (What works and what does not work? and when?)

"..please fri some body help me..." (I am a vegetarian.Why should I
fry *any* body to help you?)

Please spare the members the headache of parsing your language. They
have enough headaches of their own.

Use simple english.

I was interested in hearing the experiences.

I can give scenarios.

I am using Ubuntu 10.10 . The system is  connected to a printer.
The problem is the PDF files do not get printed automatically (on clicking

This happens irrespective of the printer connected (tried 3 printers so

Any solution?

Message-ID: <CA+3=755gi01KZ5zGGsoZfQXR13kcqdCUWciCq4k=1GO+OVcKjw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi friends,

We have setup pfsense primarily for VPN from Windows machines to access the
SAP which is on AIX.

We have implemented pfsense and enabled OpenVPN.

We are able to connect from Windows XP machines to SAP but we are facing a
problem with Windows 7.

We are able to connect to the server but we are not able to access the SAP
server the way we are able to do with XP machines.

There are multiple Windows 7 versions like Home Basic, Professional and the
same problem is there with every machine.

We are also using McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8 in all the clients.

Any help in this would be highly appreciated.

Regards

Ravi Kumar Tenneti

Have you tried to give exclusion in Mcaffe for your SAP application and
corresponding port.

Because AV sometimes create unusual problems. Also try to uninstall Mcaffe
in one pc and check.

Do you have McAfee installed on XP as well ?  If yes check what is the
policy which McAfee Virus scan engine has on both XP and Win7, because
McAfee's policy can block application from certain folders.

I asked to give all the details here, if editing wiki is tough.
I dont think sending email is tough :-)

>> @Srinivas have a simple form in google doc or some place then put the
>> info wherever or what ever form you  want  , i have seen people being
>> very uncomfortable  with wiki style :P

if we use google docs, for each form submission, I have to copy and
paste the data into wiki. Imagine 100s of form submissions, I have to
keep on doing the same copy paste work for the whole day.

If any organization want to get some publicity for free, adding their
info themself wont be a huge task.

The entire wikipedia is working with the same very uncomfortable wiki style :P

Learning wiki editing is like learning GNU/Linux Commands.
It has a steep learning curve but has its own advantages.
Editing a wiki page is a easiest way to share our knowledge as a
contribution to the community.

As I told already, I have requested to give the details here in the
list so that anyone can add in the wiki page. :-)

As a foss based organization they must know how to use wiki..because
wiki pays more attention and reachout.instead of cant,please try.its
so simple.just create a login,login into wiki and copy the previous
organization list starting from | to |- and edit your company name
there and paste it in any place you want.

yes that is different angle to it if they do not play along the
ecosystems people will sooner or later will come to  know  and they
will soon be out of business this market place is bit different in the
sense if they do not know and have money to employ people then they
should even for tasks like these or other, which ultimately will build
the brand and create credibility , my interest is to have as many
companies like them , since we need more companies like these and many
more to fill the void of  frustration and  unemployment youth of this
nation faces.

Common, I don't understand this. If some one wants to be with foss, why he
must do everything in a difficult way. If things are made easy they are
termed childish.

These FOSS people make things difficult and blame the world not adapting to
it. Common!!!!

There is a reason why all have a telephone with them rather than a
telegraphic machine. What next? Post to this form using binary ASCII codes?
:-))

We need to wake up.

I didn't fully get your explanation here: Please correct me if I'm wrong:
I'm assuming you have a FreeSWITCH based system in India which talks to the
"business logic" server hosted out of EC2.

Although Amazon claims the "IO performance" to be moderate for both Small
and Medium instances, I've personally noticed significant variations in the
small instance IO performance due to contention for resources (more small
EC2 instances on the same machine, lesser medium EC2 instances on the same
machine; medium instances are pooled together and you may never usually
find medium and small together on the same real servers)

Some things you may want to check:

1. Is singapore your EC2 availability zone? If not, it may be worth moving
it to singapore to see a significant improvement in latency between your
indian FreeSWITCH service and the
2. Instead of a dedicated server, you may want to look at the High I/O
instance: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ (I'm not sure if this
is available in the Singapore availability zone; I haven't personally used
high I/O instances)
3. Monitor your app and the system's performance. Is Network I/O your
bottleneck? Is disk I/O your bottleneck?

cheers,

How have you made this easy? You have only posted your gripe! This wiki is
a place where you post for free publicity. If you dont want it you just
walk away. Not throw mud at people for not wanting the pleasure of your

Absolutely. Many smart, budding enterprises I know of are asking potential
engineering recruits to show what they've done in github. But that said,
github doesn't work so well for sysadmin / operations types people.

first follow the list guidelines
http://ilugc.in/mailinglist-guidelines/ it makes everyone's lives much
easier .you have been asked multiple times by different people.

> These FOSS people make things difficult and blame the world not adapting to
> it. Common!!!!

difficult and childish are relative terms , who is  blaming who ? they
are just point of views , ideas and approaches these are the arguments
all about  no matter what you try to do  in Life or Foss  there is
always multiple ways to do it , some people warn about being
fragmented etc.. these thought processes and people are like this
because no two people are alike hence no two approaches to a situation
would be similar , once you understand this you would be surprised to
see best of friends arguing , just like  politics and politicians they
all argue but that does stop them from being good friends , its just
the ideology which differentiates one from another , i feel  arguments
are good for a healthy community.

so far i have seen five kinds of people in Foss world once you
identify the type its really easy to deal with them , be warned anyone
can become the other in due  course of time you have to make a
judgement based on the topic and arguments.

1)Newbie
2)Radical
3)Moderate
4)Cusp
5)Suckers

correct how many people still know how they used to work , again its a
perception issue and belief system if someone appreciates a
telegraphic machine or the Ham because of its historical perceptive or
the way it was build , what is wrong in that , you decide what you
want to do and just move on.

> We need to wake up.

Who was  sleeping :-) , wake up to what ? all is well and this is how
the things were and will be .

Message-ID: <CAMbkTgKoUbGUFcU_3d+h65hvo5i9scXYdtxH7VEF8i3mwANu6w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

         I am using postgres 8.2. I would like to know if there is a
way to get the definition of a 'view' by running a query.

For eg., to get the list of views, we can do something like(of course,
there are other ways)

"SELECT table_name from infromation_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'VIEW'"

Can we do something similar to get the definition of the view ? The
normal way of doing it is by running "\d+ view_name" in the postgres
database prompt. Thanks

no it does these are the people who showed to the world how to
maintain your cv's in a version control systems,  i use them
extensively to store my presentations and reference documents as
backup , a list of people who are devops guys use it extensively here
http://forge.puppetlabs.com/tags/webservers and one such example here
https://github.com/ghoneycutt/puppet-apache , yes it is useful for one

No one is asking you to write validated HTML + CSS  + JS to add an entry.
Editing a wiki is trival and there a millions non-foss/non-techie people that
edit wikipedia without any problems.

> These FOSS people make things difficult and blame the world not adapting to

This is a purely commercial listing and if you don't care to be listed there
it's your loss. FOSS will survive just fine without you/ your company being
listed there.

Have you ever tried to get an ad printed in a newspaper/magazine or shown on
TV? They have very specific requirements about the format in which
submissions should be made. Why should this be any different?

The OP is spending valuable time building this resource for the community at
large,(isn't charging anything for his effort and neither is he getting a cut
out of any business that is generated from the directory). So the only thing
he should be concerned about is making his work easier.

What next? You'll complain about how your listing isn't generating any leads?
That your business isn't earning millions of dollars and it's all the OP's
fault?

Hi,

          I am not sure if it was shared here. Noufal Ibrahim[1] has
done a great work by creating screencasts that help people learn
emacs, and customise it. They are located at the emacs movies[2] site.
So, emacs beginners(and probably even long-time users) can benefit
from it. A great many thanks to Noufal for that. Thanks

    It is normally not a good idea to reply to cross-posts. And
definitely not right to top post. But since you asked - vimcasts.org
is the equivalent. Thanks

Is this what you are looking for?

SELECT definition FROM pg_views WHERE viewname like 'yourviewname' and
schemaname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema');

I went around and looked at his emails to the list. Each of them seem
to be bordering either trolling or immature behaviour. It is just
adding noise to the list without adding any meaningful content.

    I too feel that it is adding a lot of noise, without useful
learning. It will be nice if either Shrini or Raman can  step in.
Though I don't like moderation in general, this attitude of "I will
behave the way I want, I don't care about others/guidelines" doesn't
look right to me. Thanks

The culture of ignoring what you don't like is not prevalent in this
nation. Unless that grows, people will focus and comment on things they
don't like and miss their goals.

I find tolerance abundant in cities like Rio and London, but very less in
Indian cities.

Two days before, myself had a discussion with the Director of
MSME-TDC, Chennai.  During the discussion, he expressed his concern
that he could not find right organization/people to get FOSS support
for his project.

Hence, I requested our ILUG-C co-ordinator Mr. Shrinivasan to make
arrangements in finding / listing such organizations in both
Kaniyam/ILUG-C where many organizations like above could benefit.

So, I request the list members, whoever maybe commercially supporting
FOSS to list themselves with complete contact details which would
benefit not only themselves but also a wider section of the society
who may be looking support for FOSS.

With regards

S. Baskar
CEO/LinuXpert Systems

I requested the community to add about FOSS organizations in the wiki.
anyone can

1. update the wiki directly  or
2. send the details here or
3. send to me < tshrinivasan AT gmail DOT com >

There is nothing to discuss about this more.

Let us stop here.

Dude whatever you are trolling at I dont care but the first rule of
this LUG is not to top post especially from someone who understands a
bit of "technology" as you seem to be . Why do you repeatedly top post
?

If you don't like the group please do unsubscribe , but please don't top post .

Imho, setting the moderation bit on this user or if manually
moderating posts is difficult, banning this member, though very harsh
is the best thing to do. Considering how he has been turning deaf ears
to what people are saying to him and trolling non-stop, he has earned
it.

I think that?s quiet difficult. Because people simply don't know how many
email accounts one has. I think one must submit his passport or some
details to the moderator before being let into this mailing list. In that
way duplication and reincarnation can be stopped.

Or a small fee could be charged for each member on a monthly basis.

Trolls, snide remarks on the community and his penchant for picking up
cudgels apart, this poster insists on top posting inspite of being told
politely many times. I vote for this being knocked off the list immediately.

Sir,

Don't accuse me of top posting, I did not know what it was. One of the
group member informed me what it was and why it shouldn't be used. Now is
this post OK?

Looks like some one must write a tutorial on posting to this group. WOOOH.

IMHO thats not enough :(

The article is not as appealing / simple as

I don't know if this post is legal or not, but I see that this mailing list
is written with python software and is too complex to understand and
configure. I also see that top posting and having many dots can be detected
by automation and possibly rejected. Can any one take this as a project and
do it. This might make this one human friendly and less geeky.

We have guidelines and etiquette to be followed on this list. You

Hi Karthikeyan,

This community is to help and interact. We have a specific and simple
guideline.(any one knowing English can understand)
Every community has guidelines to be followed by members.
Nothing says you to wear a coat. Everyone here is telling to post with some
common sense.

so please try to post reasonably.

Except for those peddling viagra and other dubious products am against
kicking out members. However much I disagree with the person being
discussed, I do agree with him that the art of ignoring should be
cultivated by all.

Proof of many times? I said I know what's top posting just hours ago. The
person who said it confused me at last (when I sent a direct email to him)
:-( Possibly u must include a rule that those who have 50+ years experience
in forums must join here :-))

But one thing is sure, I just know that this group consists of people who
do more talking about FOSS than any credible thing. One user accuses me of
posting a pirated link to a book, other one accuses me to have written a
book for Somalian pirates. What they don't say is weather the software they
had been or are using were 100% un-pirated or not. I could have asked them,
but.... Strange Strange humans.

Hi all,

" Necessity is the mother of Invention " - My necessity always kindles me
to develop things for myself. And I share it to the community, it may be
other's necessity too.

I am using Fedora 16 with Gnome Shell 3 and Ubuntu 12.04 with Unity.
Whenever battery reaches low-level, I get notification to charge it
immediately. But, I did not get notification when battery charge is full, I
personally felt, Charge being full and that goes out of our attention will
lead to some amount of electricity being wasted. So based out of this
written a very simple Python script that does the job (And, that's what i
meant Go-Green here). I request you to take a look at the page and you can
find the source too. Post your feedback.

* Plug-out page:- http://prasannavenkadesh.github.com/Plug-out/

It is also possible to intervene at a personal level.  I have added
the offending email id into my kill filter and I don't get to see the
offending posts ruby or !ruby.

the roads. some countries asks to go right side. we have to follow the
rules for safely.

as free software activists, we respect copyright laws.that's why we told
not to share a pirated book in a public list.

we urge people to share the code for the software. in the same way we asked
the odt source of your book. we have all rights to ask for source when the
book is in gnu fdl license.

please dont share your copyrighted works or pirated materials here.

please learn the list guidelines and try to follow them. it wont require a
50+ age to learn the guidelines.

please dont ask why the guidelines are there and why to follow.

let us stop the discussion here.

hope you learn some little stuff and participate in the healthy discussions.

Hate to be the bearer of bad news, your logic is flawed. (That's why such an
indicator doesn't exist yet!)

"Once the Charge is full, Please plug-out the power cable. Go Green."

It's greener to run your laptop on electricity than on Lithium-foo batteries.

The longer you run your laptop on battery the sooner your battery will die
and you'll be forced to replace it, causing more Lithium to be mined(exposing
miners and others to harmful elements) and increasing the chance of a lithium
battery not being disposed off properly and ending up in a landfill and
polluting the environment/poisoning wildlife etc.

So it makes economic and environmental sense to run your laptop and other
battery powered devices on the mains whenever you are near a power socket.
This will increase the life of their batteries and thus the device itself.

I request you to remove the line "Once the Charge is full, Please plug-out
the power cable. Go Green." from the website to ensure this untruth isn't
propagated further.

The script itself would be useful for other purposes.

I have used a few appliances from Turnkey

Their offering is amazing.

Thanks for sharing the link.   A couple of years back I have switched
to Debian on the server side and have come to appreciate the way the
distro is put together and supported by the Debian developers across
the globe.

IMO, it puts to shame many a well funded companies that ship out
crappy software.

I think i should replace "Go Green" with "Save some Electricity
consumption".

Thanks for enlightening. I don't know that. What I personally felt is that
" Laptops could run on battery for quite couple of hours, thus once the
charge is full, you can disconnect the plug and let it run in Battery, and
for those couple of hours we don't need the direct supply of current, thus
we shall avoid using electricity for laptops until the battery drains to
minimum level. Doesn't that interval between charging and discharging would
count for Electricity ? ". Keep telling suggestions, whatever it is
positive or negative, i would like to get enlightened.

You aren't doing that either. Charging the battery isn't 100% lossless. So
you'll actually spend more electricity charging the battery than you'll get
out of the battery. So you actually waste electricity while running on
battery and save electricity by running the laptop on the mains!

Nope the rule is "run on mains whenever possible". In case you are running
solely on mains for a month or more(not really possible with power cuts and
all in India) You might have to do a discharge/recharge cycle to calibrate
the battery meter reading.

Battery university is an excellent resource on how batteries work, and how to
make them last etc.

For those interested in a summary of sorts, I'd written about it on my
website a few years ago

Lenovo's Thinkpad comes with default App for Battery Monitor which does the
same thing.

Ok, the below article shows, Overcharging a laptop running Li-ion batteries
would not reduce lifespan of the Battery. Overcharging may cause problems
in Li-ion batteries only when the Charging circuit malfunctions (This case
is considered to be exceptional).

http://computer.howstuffworks.com/laptop-battery-overcharged.htm

And thanks to Kingsly for pointing out. I am taking it down. I request
other's not to comment on this anymore or not to complain about the link is
no-longer available.

@Srinivas OK. Ya working on pulling ou all ODT files of my book. Think will
put them on Github, but wonder is is good for odt? Its not plain text u see.

@Manokaran Yup! Poor guys (my employees), they must have earned lot of bad

It is plain text. just rename it's extension as .zip and unzip it. If
you find gobbledegook, it is most likely a password protected file. If
you find pure/plain text in XML (ask google uncle who is XML) then you
have either displayed your arrogant ignorance or you deserve to be a
PHB or you cant read ASCII.

And I am in my golden year, FWIW.

Now, "show me the code", I demand under the license.

Have you checked Windows 7 firewall?


Have you done a tracert?

nuff said.

Why don't you contact the vendor of Win7 Machine or other MSCE infested list?
BTW this is a Linux list, so do not expect too much support on
windows. People may know, but honestly, this is an elementary MSCE
job. Not for professionals.

An integrated development environment is expected to be built around
the programming language that it helps application development in.
What are the shortcomings that you see ? Could you provide an example
?

He does not seem to know how to run desktops.
Has lame and baseless complaints.
Finally does not understand the variety of desktops available and
specifications.
Which third party wants to target all the desktops at once?
... and are desktops meant for third parties to tinker with ?

Your statement is incorrect, he is the founder of GNOME, Mono and many
other projects ! I worked directly under him and he is an amazing person to
work with.

I'm really sorry but I can't stop ROFL after this one. Is it really you

Hi, 

>  http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2012/Aug-29.html

A very interesting article. The points made by Miguel de Icaza
are pretty much valid in relation to Linux. Diversity amongst
Linux distros are a "good" thing - but have often led to 
complexity and confusion both amongst end-users and 
developers. Drivers that work on one version of kernel might
break on another. 

Even user-space application developers are not spared from the 
nightmare of maintaining proper compatibility amongst various 
Linux distros and their supplied libraries versions - it is indeed
a challenge. 

But Miguel's quote about OSX as being more refined or rather 
appealing to developer community seems a bit exaggerated
to me. Most OSes provide "one" way to do things and
are somewhat locked-down in my opinion, and that includes
OSX too. Linux on the other hand - only serves as a base
platform for us (as in developers) to innovate and do things
the way we like it.

The way I see it - Linux has created an ecosystem for 
"power-users" to build, share and promote our ideas and 
products. The so-called "desktop" paradigm is dying fast and 
is going to vanish in the coming times (like MS-DOS, AmigaOS
did in the mid 90s) leading to appliance devices and apps 
hosted on the cloud and accessible using web browsers.
Linux already has a good market share in these area and is
future-ready.

The traditional OSX vs Windows vs Linux debate are getting 
obsolete already, being replaced with Chrome vs Firefox vs Safari, 
Android vs iOS vs Blackberry OS and so on...

Cheers!

For those who suffer from unity of ubuntu, there is gnome fallback mode.
We can get almost our old gnome functionalities like menu, top bar,

Check the link for how to enable it.

Even though Lcaza is one of the founder of Gnome, This article is bit
overstated, The entire argument about linux not maintaining backwards
compatibility is bullshit (Just my opinion). Linux Desktop's base API's
(either Gnome libraries or KDE libraries) are very stable.

I'm not sure if he is still in Gnome Foundation, or kicked out of it
long time back with his Mono. He noticed an opportunity now to FUD,
because everyone hate Gnome3 and Linux Desktop is in dilemma with
various DE projects(cinnamon, mate, XFCE-revival etc.,).

Yeah, Everyone hate Gnome3, Let it be!! But as a follower and user of
Gnome I have to say it has the best subsystems which have potential to
beat OSX or Windows or Android anytime. All they need is developers.

Gnome's base libraries (Gtk, Glib family) are rock-solid and no major
changes happened AFAIK. On top of it we have GStreamer, PulseAudio,
Telepathy, Avahi subsystem which have long proved their potential. On
the lower, we have these *Kits,d-bus and systemd from freedesktop.org
(pollkitd, udiskd, packagekit etc.,) which are making life easier.

The only problem is, not all of these layers (Kernel + service-layer
(feedesktop.org stuff) + Gnome3) synced well in major distros.

Fedora is the only distro which put all these things fully, to some
extend Arch. Ubuntu went their way with Unity, Debian going their way to
Xfce, Mint went with Cinnamon and Mate, Gentoo accepted gnome3, but not
so quick to accept all freedesktop.org stuffs because they play big in
service layer(Yeah!! Lennart (Po[e]*tter)(ing)* f???ed udev with his
systemd http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/gentoo/dev/259045)

I think Linux Desktop is alive and ready for BigTime. Its future will be
decided not by the DE projects, but by the distros.

That is not completely true. The libraries that make up the toolkit do
keep changing and backwards compatibility is more shoe-horned in than
a principle.

The list is visible from <http://www.gnome.org/foundation/membership/>

If you do read what Miguel writes the theme of his argument is that
Linux ended catching up with OS X rather than setting things in place
well up front. Now there can be merit in the argument that the
community driven development provides a collaborative space wherein
the strict 'stack' control will not really work out. The issue that
his piece skirts is the scope of the "Desktop" - that entity spans the
usual "computing hardware at home" and, the "computing hardware at
massive deployment of workstations" to "computing hardware doing
client side crunching"

This is interesting - you take Miguel apart on his choice of Mono and,
you take apart Lennart on systemd. Step back for the moment without
prejudice and think about this - Lennart has practically re-jigged 3
fundamental pieces of the Linux architecture (and, Miguel/Nat along
with other re-jigged the desktop environment with enough horsepower to
make it relevant).

The distributions are the carriers - the upstream is where the
decisions matter. Changes therein decide how much the distributions
can release-engineer and ship.

Recently, my cell's (Nokia 2730c) behaving totally mysteriously. It
used to work normal everywhere, but these days, it shows range only
under certain towers, for example, the second I cross mamablam coming
from nungambakam side, the signal just goes off to zero bar. Same
happens when I cross Marina, where it shows full range and it goes
zero once I reach Santhome. It doesn't work anywhere else in Tamil
Nadu. But it works fine once I reach Pondicherry.
First I thought its issue with the SIM or provider(BSNL), but I tried
using it in another Samsung phone at Tambaram, its working perfectly
fine.
Then I thought its got to do with cell's antennas, some frequency
issues, since both 2G and 3G(WCDMA) are not working, but l8r I
realised that even when there's no range, my internet's working super
fine. (infact, i'm sending this mail from my cell, from Tambaram, and
cell's showing zero range, no calls, messages allowed.)
Third reason I thought was that its some issue with software, S40, and
I reinstalled OS and still its all same. Not OS, not provider, not
hardware, then where's it failing? Any explanations?

I thoroughly enjoyed this mail. Nice analysis.

However you have to do more analysis along the same lines and arrive
at a solution.

That is as far as my hardware knowledge goes. Your ability to send
e-mail without signal
 for voice does not seem reasonable. And I have no knowledge with
phones though I
 know little bit about antennas, CDMA etc.

Books themselves have become a collector's item as even the Hindu
scriptures are available online
 even with original Sanskrit and Tamil PDF full with images even.

So I am not sure how many takers will be there for books.

Best of luck. I am sure you will find someone to take on your request.

When I read the topic "What Killed the Linux Desktop" It did not reflect me
that
this statement comes from a GNOME founder.

Does he mean Linux Desktop is already dead?  Then why working on window
manager for dead stuffs?

Isn't it more to do with preinstalled OS?  With the success of Android its
clear that preinstalled OS is going to stay in box longer.

May be Raspberry pi or something similar can prove Linux desktops worthy,

And next, GNOME is a WM and it has been running in other OS too, and Often
there have been criticism by Linus himself about it.
http://www.osnews.com/story/25022

may be this is one is something like that in return.

This happens quite often on my phone as well. Atleast, in my phone, this 
is due to switching between UMTS (WCDMA) and GSM ie., 3G and 2G. While I 
am browsing, everything will be fine until it goes to 0 bars and comes 
back with full signal. The full signal is actually with GSM/EDGE. To 
test this theory, I disabled UMTS on my phone and this was no longer 
happening. Without UMTS, I get full signal almost all the time. But then 
I was able to browse only at EDGE speed instead of HSDPA. So, I have 
reverted back to the old configuration with UMTS enabled.

As the 3G coverage improves, this problem should go away over the years.

He may be one of the founders of Gnome, but that does not make his

By desktop he understands Gnome only and is quite possible that he may
cause more nuisance.

I have not read the article but I believe that Linux or UNIX never had
desktop potential.

Ubuntu and Redhat almost got there but I am not sure if they even got
as far as Apple did.

Linux is still heavily used for server applications. That is its forte.

Geeks use it in desktop. These facts may not change.

I know that, and I usually use only 2G or 3G, never work with dual mode
becz of it.  My issue is different it goes zero beyond some place and never
comes back even while its in coverage area!! :)

This happens because of some error in network selection in Dual mode, they
at times tend swithch to 2g and search for tower again, by the time they
find 2g tower, phone jumps back to 3g! Use 2g or 3g alone (Nokia u got net
mode selection, think there's option for frequency selection in Samsung and
others!) to solve it!

And thats the tricky part of it! Totally confused! That rules out the
chance for it to be some problem with antenna!

	~2GB
Message-ID: <CABtcFXR8H8i=849ErF1jfJmtKzU_76VfDuAUrNj8B3Jx0qrdPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Can anyone suggest a schema visualization tool that can help  me get
an ER  diagram for a MySQL dump file(.sql file)  of  ~2GB in size?

I tried sqlfairy for this. But it gives:  out of memory!! error.
I tried Atantis surf, but it didnt detect SQL server in its database
pane. Can this problem be resolved? Also, I dont know much to work in
Atlantis.

Plz provide suggestions..Thanks in advance.

Mysql workbench?

Perhaps running the script on a test mysql instance may help you better....

Hard to say whats going on. In my case, when I change the mode on the 
phone to WCDMA (3G) only, it loses signal very often. And, at times, 
takes upto 5-10 mins to find the signal back. So, I tend to prefer this 
dual mode.
