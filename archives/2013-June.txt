If they are suitable, I'll recommend you to add them in Tamil
Wikibooks (if you want to generate pdf book, thats also possible). It
will help strengthen that project, also it will be accessible for
everyone.

Rails Girls Summer of Code helps Rails Girls students get into Open Source.

Just like in Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code, students
will be paid so they're free to work on Open Source projects for a few
months. Unlike those programs, the Rails Girls Summer of Code is about
helping students to further expand their knowledge and skills by
contributing to a great Open Source project (rather than producing
highly sophisticated code).

http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/

If anyone is interested to apply or want to know more, talk to me.

Thanks
Praveen

Dear All,

With a lot of sadness, I have to tell you all that Atul Chitnis is no
more. I can write a lot but for now I think the following is enough.

Without him there would have been no FOSS.IN without which there would
be no KDE-India and this list. I know many contributors on this list
who started out at one of the FOSS.IN editions. Please do pray for his
soul and his family and friends.

RIP Atul Chitnis (toolz). Thank you for everything.

Pradeepto

Really sorry to hear this. FOSS in India has lost many stalwarts recently.
I still recall reading the first article ever published in PC Quest about
Linux and I recall Mr.Chitnis' contributions to open source.

Again, another person who will be hard to replace.

I know 3 techie guys who lost their battle in their 50s.

1) Steve Jobs
2) KG
3) Atul

Of course India can only be expected to produce these people.

We have to come of age in our attitude and opportunity to produce
better guys to produce
 a Samsung or LG or such companies so we have good people that die in India. ;)

Do you have the file extconf.rb in your current directory?

This error means that the file is not in current directory.

Found this interesting web  based translation system.
http://weblate.org/en/

It is free software.

Debian Handbook http://debian-handbook.info
project uses this for translation of the book into various languages.
http://debian.weblate.org/projects/debian-handbook/

With this we can setup our own instances for
managing and organizing the translations.

Programming is a way to solve business problems.

Programming is a way to apply creativity to serve the society.

C coding is not the only way to solve problems. And programming like
everything else
 is not learnt just in college. You don't stop learning by 25 or 28.
You actually keep learning
 till you are 50 or so, sometimes even after that.

There are plenty of programming languages, programming techniques,
methodologies, ideas,
 approaches and so on.

Learning a good quality editor like Vim is key. Learning a good
environment like UNIX is key.

And understanding the big picture from a 35,000 feet level is key.

Programming does not happen just with software development for a product.

You have database SQL coding, you have configuration file editing, you
have to read several
 RFC documents, standards, you have to understand the English in man
pages, what a website
 says and you have to know technology in depth.

Such skills are not acquired in college or with just 5 years of
experience. It will take many decades.

Even a simple thing like writing an XL formula or an MS Word macro is
also programming.

Writing shell scripts is also programming.

Do not approach learning as an activity that is reactionary or only
for solving a problem at hand.

You should learn for the joy of learning. For remembering and applying
your knowledge later.

Only open ended learning outside of the syllabus will help you.

Life does not have a syllabus. Exams and grades do not help you after
your first job.

Have you contacted your network administrator with this problem?

If you are the network administrator, then you need to share some of
the Proxy server settings.  Have you looked at the logs of the proxy
server?  Can you share the relevant log entries specific to your
Thunderbird access?

hi mohan..,

          you configure the "Transparent proxy" in server and do the
"NATING" between local server private ipaddress with isdn provider's public
ipaddress.

        Then u can able to set the proxy settings in mail clients..,then
only it will work (ie allow to send and receive the mail like direct
connection).,


                        All The Best..,

What is the magic trick to make a PHP based application to initiate a
TLS/SSL connection to a remote MySQL server?

I have done this with the mysql client (with the resp. client cert) on
host B connecting to the mysql server (with the resp. server cert). on
host A over an encrypted connection (native mysql server TLS/SSL).

No success in doing this from MantisBT and RoundCube (both PHP apps.).
  The requirement is that all PHP apps must connect to a 'centralized'
MySQL db server on a remote host.

I have looked at the .inc.php files but do not see anything there to
initiate a TLS/SSL connection to MySQL.

I am not a PHP developer, so beyond the above, I am not aware of how to do it.

I am sure there must a generic way to do this in PHP that would work
with all PHP application.

Any pointers / nudge would be appreciated.

TIA,

Forgot to mention --
In the db.inc.php (Roundcube Mail), my associate has tried the code
snippets from here.

i know, there are hundreds of websites explaining it - with page-long
code-snippets .... meh this is mostly gruscht - if you do not understand
what happens do not implement it

why giving PHP - a obvious insecure language in the wrong hands - the
right to initiate the db-connection? Maybe a simple, quick and dirty
solution outside php/mysql works for you to solve your problem for now?
- until someone comes up the perfect solution ;)

point your application-config to your localhost:localport and tunnel
this localport to your remote server
ssh -L 3306:localhost:3306 ssh_user at remoteServer

for a more persistent connection just write a script to keep this tunnel
in state

i know lame ;) - but better than messing around with code and odd
scripts and that others wrote and nobody else understand ;)

Hi,

Can I install Linux on a branded laptop preloaded with Windows8.

Some of my friends told it is locked internally so that hard disc cannot be partitioned to install Linux.

Thanks,
Selva

As far as I've seen, windows pre-loaded laptops do not bar you from
partitioning the hard disk. If you want to use Windows and Linux on
the same laptop, I'll recommend either
(a) use a VM for linux like VMWare or Virtualbox.
(b) use wubi installer if you are looking at Ubuntu which will allow
you to load Ubuntu without partitioning (uses a raw file).

This command is asking to execute the file extconf.rb
you have to create the file.

Hope you are trying to create some extension for ruby.

if so, check this link

else, explain what you want to achieve.

Friends I was trying to compile and install dhvani .Initially I was
following steps here

http://dhvani.sourceforge.net/doc/compiling.html

Initially there were lots of error  so I followed these steps .
http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc/75166

Now I am having a new problem .When I try to run dhvani it gives the
following  error :

root at ubuntu:/home/hammad/Desktop/dhvani/dhvani# dhvani -h
dhvani: error while loading shared libraries: libdhvani.so.0: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory

Any idea what might have caused this .I am on a 64bit Ubuntu 12.04
installation .
I followed following steps to install dhvani .

$ make distclean
$ aclocal
$ libtoolize
$ autoconf
$ automake -a
$./configure -with-soundtouch=no --with-oggvorbis=no
$ make

If you buy a laptop preloaded with Windows 8, the hard disk will be
partitioned as GPT and the BIOS will be an UEFI one.

1. Format your entire hard disk and install Windows 8 on your own with 2
partitions (one for OS and one for Data)

2. Keep the remaining space in your hard disk as unpartitioned space.

3. Install the UEFI supported linux flavour the left space.

4. Now you can select Linux/Windows on boot time.

I am using feedly to collate my rss feeds and provide it as a dashboard.
For some reason part of the tamil content(headings) is not showing up

I notice that there are some font installers available but I am not sure if
font is the real problem as I see partial content its only the heading
which is missing.

On paper a client (application) connecting to the server over TLS/SSL
looks great.   The gotchas are in the implementation :(
I guess, for database connectivity, all the apps developers assume it
will be localhost.  Thus, the code lacks the necessary hooks for
encrypting the connection.

I wish the developers would assume the db is on remote host and build
in encryption for db connectivity.  Even when the db is on localhost,
the encryption would be built in.

Indeed, this is my plan B and yes it does work.  My engineer found
autossh [1]  to keep alive the connection.

Thanks for your input and alternate suggestion.

Create a separate partition for Linux as usual. You can install Linux
without any problems (latest Linux distributions support UEFI so no
need to worry), if older Linux distribution before installing change
from UEFI mode to BIOS.

Hope this helps,

Hello,

Does any one have experiences to share on out of the box 'drop-in' replacement of MySQL with MariaDB version 5.x ? Also, using Aria tables in place of MyISAM ?

Thanks,

Subject: [Ilugc] Media Server - Live Transcoding and Streaming
Message-ID: <CAK2rq7wWHKxx7mV36697K5Yaz4+M7pQ2s6zVu=Fwh1c5BztX8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am running Linux Mint 13 on my laptop in which I have a collection
of movies and TV series. My bro an iPhone 5 on which he likes to watch
them and i watch them on my laptop. Currently I use iTunes on Windows
(its a shame that i dual-boot for this alone) to transfer to iPhone.
Since many of formats are unsupported on Iphone, I use Handbrake to
convert to mp4 and then copy them over which is a tedious process.

One thing that I have in mind is to setup a local media Server that
will host all this content and probably transcode + stream the content
and access via wi-fi?

http://alternativeto.net/software/plex/ - Options I have looked at are
1) Plex 2) XMBC 3) Subsonic

But some of them do not have an iPhone app that can be installed
freely. Tried Air Video, it works well in Windows though with limited
features.

Am looking for FOSS applications that work in Linux env to do the job
? Any ideas / prior usage experience, please share? Guidance will be
much appreciated.

You can try with MediaTomb- Opensource UPnP media server for streaming the
media through WiFi.
http://mediatomb.cc/

Am sure you can find lot of players for DLNA/UPnP streaming
Video/Audio.MediaTomb is also providing an web-based interface for playing
Videos.

About OpenStack:
OpenStack is a python based open source cloud computing framework.

It is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing project
that is free open
source software released under the terms of the Apache License. The
project is managed by

the OpenStack Foundation, a non-profit corporate entity established in
September 2012 to promote, protect and empower OpenStack software and
its community.

More than 150 companies have joined the project among which are AMD,
Intel, Canonical,

SUSE Linux, Red Hat, Cisco, Dell, HP, IBM, NEC, VMware and Yahoo!.
It is portable software, but is mostly developed and used on the Linux
operating system.

The technology consists of a series of interrelated projects that
control large pools

of processing, storage, and networking resources throughout a
datacenter, all managed
through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering
their users to
provision resources through a web interface.

Happy to release the 15th edition of the Kaniyam, an eMagazine for
Free/ Open Source Software in Tamil.

This is an excellent initiative Srini. The articles in the eMag are nice. Only thing that matters is the size of the pdf. The size is unavoidable. However, you can try reducing its size, while maintaining its clarity, through this site: www.smallpdf.com

Wishing your team all success!

Yes, A lot based on your skill you do it.

Is there any investment required to start up of these websites.
- Yes. If you need such a website or some other then think of free blogs

I dont know html also.Can any one guide me to develop these kind of
websites- Any website offers free service. If required I can give some
materials.

1. What is the Minimal amount required to develop these kind of websites ? It
starts from 1000 to .....:) It depends on scope of your need.
2. Do we need to require get license from International Domain Flight
Information?
3. How much server needed, which one is the best server ?
4. I dont know anything from Html , what is server ? how can i develop . ?

Dear Kumar,

>From reading your email, I developed some sense of who you are, and what I
could do to help you.
So I will give some advice, which might sting a little.

1. Hire some experts to do research for you. How much do experts cost?
Where can you find them? Research that yourself.
2. Do a cost/benefit analysis. You have a plan for a service that is
already out there. What is your distinguishing value proposition? Why will
it be profitable?
3. If you can't hire experts, that's Ok. It will take longer, but you can
do the research yourself. Google is your friend.
4. Don't expect handholding on lists like these. People may kindly point
you in the right direction.
5. Please, don't call yourself basically an English graduate student. It is
insulting to BASIC, and English, and graduates, and students. But that is
unkind of me to say. Quite simply, it's not profitable for you. If you want
to be a businessman, then be one. Don't basically be an Englis gratuae
stuudent. Who cares if you don't speak English? Hire someone.

Best wishes,

- Ashwin.

All,

I am plan to work as independent consultant on opensource softwares.

Plenty of questions in mind,
the top questions are

1)

Installing & supporting the opensource software (majorly GPLv3 licence,
GPLv2, apache, other licences too) to the customer , is it legal?
Here support means - configuration & admistration support?

2)
Customizing the opensource software. (Note: I will send the customization
to the software mailing group. Here the group may reject this or take this
or put on hold to make it on official delivery)
But, still i can use the customized software  to my customer?
And install & support the customized software to customer?

Is it legal?

3) Writing documentation for the usage of opensource software and share it
with customers?

Making money out of those items (1,2,3) , is it legal?

thanks
suresh.

[suresh] Thanks.

Some more questions.
What are the important items we should take care (regarding licensing
terms) , when we deal with open source software..
I mean, how do i mention (in marketing slides, brouchers etc) opensource
software services,  I guess the words should be used carefully?

Any reference web portals...existing business cases ,etc , will help me to
tune myself...?



thanks
suresh.

What you are planning to do is engaging in a service provider
agreement with the customer where the scope of the contract/agreement
includes installing specific software, configuring it according to the
production environment and, providing support for administering. This
has specifically nothing much to do with GPL (or, any other license
that your software stack will have).

The answer to this depends on the definition of "customization".
<http://opensource.org/faq#linking-proprietary-code> would be a link
that would be useful.

However, if your contract with the client does not prohibit it, you
are always welcome to put your patches to the upstream project and,
follow their processes for making it a part of a future release.

If you customer is intending to provide the software to others ie. you
are an application developer providing services to a client who
desires to make a commercial offering from the combined product
(application+custom_patches) then you'd want to read the FAQ I've
linked to.

Yes. Again this is a services agreement ie. documentation services.

Message-ID: <CABKAokWvxk=pmAmVzXUTA_11-xu38V2GDUHE0z5QUoECDULX4A@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Currently, i am using a IP datagram socket for sending and receiving packet
between two processes. There may be cases where a process can send multiple
packets to the other. The receiving process doesn't know this. And it
always reads only one packet.

1. What happens the other packet??
2. Is there a way to know the number of packet in the socket's receive
queue?

It sits in the buffer till you read (and thus remove) it from the buffer. Note 
that even if you send only one packet, it's possible that the recipient gets 
dupes.

socket.select() is the answer to this. See this stackoverflow q&a:

Beg to disagree. By having a practical goal, one can learn how to do
things practically. Then get inspired by how it worked and dig deeper.
But if you've got a hundred interesting, practical problems to solve -
then keep doing it. Achieving rewards our brain (dopamine circuitry
and such) in ways to reinforce learning way better than 'organized'
learning attempts. Thus, classrooms (and syllabuses and standardized
tests) are ineffective ways of learning (and here I agree completely
with you).

Actually, nowadays, not even for the first job... and I HOPE the trend
continues and forces the system of education as it is practiced today
to become utterly useless and obsolete. Flipkart is probably going IPO
soon, this may be an interesting change to a long recurring trend
(where the only kind of IPOs that happened in India in the IT sector
were "services" companies which mostly sold indian labour, much like
what happened in the 19th century). The many emerging indian startups
are thinking radically different - for once, as I may have mentioned
here earlier, they are open to hiring anyone with any background,
irrespective of their academic performance, provided they can DO WORK
(read: solve problems, writes good code, understands fundamentals well
and can learn). Afterall, what's more to keeping pace with the world
of computers than constant self-learning?

Many times reaching a goal is the ultimate aim. Once the goal is met, the
tools and the path taken may seem irrelevant. At that moment, learning
ceases to happen. If I have a good enough internet connection, i can google
up or look up stackoverflow for references to solve the problem at hand.
Learning does not happen! Very few are actually inspired to go beyond the
problem they just solved.

Ok. I did not attempt to prove a point or disagree with you or others in
the thread. Its just a thought I felt a need to share!

On the contrary, I agree with Girish 100%. I have seen people who learn for
pleasure and not forced upon  bya a goal seems to have true knowledge (but
not money :( )

Hi everyone!

I'm so very happy to send you this email. If you'll visit the Tamil
dashboard you'll notice something spectacular (https://l10n.mozilla.org/**
teams/ta <https://l10n.mozilla.org/teams/ta>). I have visited this
dashboard so much that when I begin typing in the URL for the l10n
dashboards, Tamil is the first autosuggest :-)

Congratulations Tamil team, you've produced the first up-to-date version of
Firefox in Tamil since Firefox 5! In approximately 2.5 weeks, this release
will move from Beta to the more widely distributed Release channel.

Fantastic work everyone! You all deserve a celebration, and I certainly
hope that the local Mozilla Reps are currently working on one (if you need
any help with this, please let me know). Please keep up the fantastic work!
You all are astounding! The people of your country and region should be
very proud to know of all of your hard work in making the internet more
accessible by localizing Firefox into Tamil.

Thank you,
Jeff

Nice. During the regular meetings of the LUG and, at other places
where it can be pitched, would you consider insisting that users give
the build a try? Feedback is essential to keep the process going.

Subject: [Ilugc] the whole web 2.0 and javascript world
Message-ID: <CALDskywOtbMRxh8AtJGaTsiytMsYwcvHGrYWEqHjnKK=O_ujLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Actually I started learning javascript in early 2008.

I thought web technology and javascript coding and HTML DOM, CSS et al
were trivial
 and I could easily master as after all that was application coding.

And I have always been a systems and networking programmer working on C, perl
 and UNIX.

But how wrong I was?

Javascript is no joke. It is an amazing programming language.

Even two days ago I had a very serious programming challenge as I had
to synchronously
 execute a loop and I had to work really hard to tackle it.

Javascript is like a scripting language, it is object oriented and it
is incredibly powerful.

It is not some ordinary thing.

It takes a lot of concerted effort and long focus to master web 2.0 programming.

And Ajax is a cool way to communicate with the server backend and
populate your web pages
 with dynamically generated CGI output.

With HTML5, canvas , video and audio and drawing facilities things are
becoming even more
 interesting.

But javascript is not going away. jQuery is here to stay.

And you cannot do much with javascript without knowing jQuery, css and html.

A lot of background knowledge, experience and hard work is needed to
deliver a web application
 of value.

PHP is being used by a lot of web programmers. I never use. I use perl
instead and get the same
 results.

If you look at the typical web application that I create it is some
4000 lines of javascript code and
 4000 lines of perl CGI.

Along with that you also have to execute certain commands as root.

So you will have CGI talking to a perl daemon over a UNIX local socket.

A web based networking or multimedia project has many parts and the
most interesting parts
 are in the javascript side.

Git is, technically speaking, the most advanced version control system
on earth right now. However this does not itself justify why everybody
should learn it. The real value of git is that it has taken
collaboration to a new level. Just like social media has made
friendship cross barriers of space, git has helped developers work
together across continents. Git is the backbone of developers working
on huge projects like the Linux kernel. Git is also the choice of
countless designers and can be used by visual artists and authors as
well.

This amazing tool costs nothing -- it is free.

Free to use and to modify as well (courtesy GNU-GPL V2). Nobody can
stop you from becoming an expert in git.

Get started with Git through our workshop.


Regards,
Satabdi

Subject: [Ilugc] starting with jQuery and javascript
Message-ID: <CALDskyxktGM1y293AKxvo6gEJUw+FQ=v1EF0sTm1gTD6Ygva3w@mail.gmail.com>

I am going to send a mail series talking about web programming with
javascript and also perl CGI in the backend.

I will also give some live samples for you to play and learn.

You should do a view source of the page to learn the code. And the
server CGI code cannot be seen, so I will send
 it separately.

Let us get started first.

Before we go very far let us start with some babysteps in javascript
and jQuery programming.

You can either download jquery.js and use it for your code or you can
fetch the jquery toolkit when the page is
loading using a HTTP URL.

I prefer to download it and use it.

The structure of the basic web page, this has to be a html file on a
web server or even a file:/// URL.

You need a web server when using Ajax , CGI and server side processing.

So let us say you have a file called first.html.

This is the structure.

-start-

<html>
<head>
          <title> First jQuery page </title>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/stylesheet.css" type="text/css" />
          <script type="text/javascript" src="/jquery/jquery.js" ></script>
          <script type="text/javascript">
           $(function() {
                   alert("hello I am jQuery");
            })
           </script>
</head>
<body>
              <h1> This is just a jQuery test </h1>
</body>

-end-

Just try this code.

We are using external files /jquery/jquery.js and /css/stylesheets.css.

These two files need to be present.

I will talk about cascading stylesheets later. But I wish to introduce it today.

The paths have to correspond to the file system paths.

If you run this code you should get the output as a very annoying alert.

If that works then you have started yourself as a web programmer.

We will slowly build on top of this. If you do this today(and not just
read the mail), then
 you will be able to do some cool animations, some effects and some
mouse events or keyboard
events can be harnessed.

But unless you learn through trial and error you will never learn.
Just reading the mail will not give you anything.

Message-ID: <CA+kPnBkYKbOUCqvgzBDN4P2bwU52ZG8vazjqR8Q-wrRgf+VpVA@mail.gmail.com>

I had sent a mail sometime back asking for help on compiling open source
network simulator, OMNeT++. I received no reply, I assume that there's no
one working with that software in this group.

I managed to set up the simulator after almost a month's research, and
noted down my observations in the attached link, hoping that it will be
useful for someone in future.

I have tried to structure the articles such that each article is
independent of  other unless mentioned. That is, to build OMNeT++ alone,
you can follow this
article<http://atjesse.wordpress.com/policy-based-resilience-simulator/installing-omnet/>and
for INET, this

Subject: [Ilugc] If you have gotten the output
Message-ID: <CALDskyxeAZM2jWLVkCSGrXAAtMV+3eDKiieN6dFVpHBpu7qfRg@mail.gmail.com>

of the last program I am going to give another very interesting code snippet.

This deals with what is called as DOM manipulation using html, css and
javascript.

Remember, jQuery is not a new programming language. It is just a high
level toolkit
that uses the object oriented facilities in javascript to make web 2.0
programming fun.

And there are 1000s of jQuery plugins for every imaginable use. It is
just so much fun
 and enjoyment that for a long time some 4 years ago I was busy with that.

But even today I am not so good at jQuery. I have not authored a
single plugin. I may do
 that sometime.

Okay now let us look at some interesting code.

As I said, don't make the mistake I made. Web programming starts to
get interesting
 and gives you joy only after you have spent some 3 years or so
learning the various
 components.

It is not logic like if condition, for loop,variables and arrays like
perl or python or shell scripting.

Web programming involves understanding the big picture of html, css,
javascript, closures,
 functional programming, and DOM manipulation.

What is DOM?

DOM is as the XML folks would say, document object model.

That is actually a tree view of various html nodes or objects.

I will illustrate in a really simple way.

look at this html code.

<body>
        <h1> I am here </h1>
</body>

Actually this is what we used in the last example I gave.

The DOM here is this:

body
  |
  |
h2(I am here)

Okay so you have a model.

Now I will give you one more example.

<body>
    <h1 align="center"> Just  a title</h1>

        <div id="someid"> A paragraph </div>
</body>

Here the tree is:

body
  |
  |   \
h1   div

As you can see it is not very hard.

And each node in the tree has what are called as attributes.

We have two attributes, align = center and id=someid

If you understand things so far we are ready to try this code:

-start-
<html>
<head>
        <script src="jquery.js"></script>
       <script type="text/javascript">
$(function() {
           $('#someid').text("I created this text dynamically");
})
</script>
</head>
<body>
             <div id="someid"></div>
</body>

-end

So what we are doing here is basically manipulate the html of the web
page on the
fly and not as static html. We can even do simple counters, a delay,
various colors
 using CSS, simple animations and so on.

I will illustrate that in the days that follow.

I do not understand why you need to do this. If you run the update command "
*sudo* yum update", it should automatically pull all the latest available
updates. Why go hunting? Lack of internet connection maybe?

hey

i apologize for the word for "help", moreover i novice to this FOSS
groups...

when i look at the wordpress page, i understand that we have to configure
the PATH settings.

its looks similar to ns2, i usually setup th path setting in ns2 in windows
OS as well as Linux version too... if you do it properly it works.

I assume you're looking for package updates. You may visit Red Hat's Errata
page [1] to see a list of recent updates available for your release. These
updates are grouped into security, bugs and enhancements.

[1] https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/rhel-server-6-errata.html

Or, are you looking for the actual patch files?

I second Karthikeyan. Both sound like good solutions!

Yet, you haven't specified the problem.
What are you trying to do with a database?

How much data is your application going to handle?
Is it going to be read-mostly, or write-mostly, or some other blend?
Is the data tabular ( like a spreadsheet ) or hierarchical ( like an HTML
document ) ?

There are so many parameters involved in deciding which database software
to use.
>From your email, it seems that you need to gain some expertise, firsthand,
or secondhand, in databases.
I suggest you use Google ( or DuckDuckGo if you value your privacy ),
books, or any other resources you can get your hands on.
Merely asking questions on this list probably won't help you enough to
choose the right database.

Yet, if you are risk-tolerant, you can just pick a database, skip the
research, and see what happens.
If you don't know what you're doing, you will very likely fail in your aims.

Take a shortcut: install Postgres, and start developing.
As a wise Software Engineer once said -- "Plan on throwing one away. You
will, anyhow."
Just code a prototype. Your code will be unstructured garbage. Learn from
it, throw it away, then start from scratch.

All the best,

Don't pick something because it is cool. If I get it right, mongo and
postgresql address very different needs! But then am not the expert and all
I can suggest is understand your problem before looking a solution.

Reading your question, it sounds like you're in the early learning phase when 
it comes to databases. Here's what I'd recommend:

1. Get a firm grasp of relational database concepts from a book.
2. SQL is the language that is used to manipulate data (and structure). It 
comes in many flavors and most are compatible (with some syntactic and 
semantic differences) with one another, conforming to various versions of 
ANSI SQL. If you pick a traditional RDBMS like postgresql, you'll pick up a 
good chunk of knowledge that can be applied with a number of other database 
engines. The newer pseudo-RDBMSs are designed to suit a different niche and 
while they may be a bit different, you should be okay with MySQL or even 
SQLite.
3. AFAYAC, MariaDB = MySQL. So, either should be fine.

Is there a particular domain you're interested in? That might help provide a 
more useful answer.

Yes there are lots of options. I assume you are a beginner.

Today's world, there are 3 major types of databases which are in use -
Relational (MySQL, Postgres etc), NoSQL (Mongo, Hypertable, Riak etc) and
Graph (Neo4J etc). If you are a person who is looking at computing as a
career, you need to understand how all the 3 work, but need not be a master
of all. For any traditional employment do become thorough with SQL, it is
the core of any relational database. It will always be helpful for whatever
career path you are going to take. But if you love something new and want
your "resume" to be noticed with keywords like "scalability" welcome to the
world of NoSQL. Graph databases are used by social networks and there are
very good implementations like Neo4J.

Arun

I learnt a lot from this thread.

You guys seem to be in that line.

The Indian IT depends a lot on DB.

Airline ticketing, railway ticketing, banks and many real world applications
 depend on databases in a big way.

But I have learnt only what I need to do my job.

I use Postgres and sqlite. Now I am slowly moving to Postgres.

I have no idea about noSQL or graph databases.

Thanks for pointing me in that direction.

always learn the concepts , never be satisfied with one ,use what gets the
job done, brand names have nothing to do with it,  including you getting a
job , change your thought process think what did i learn today not what and
why i should be doing any of it to get a job. People are miser in even
there thoughts and are driven by fear ... the moment you loose that you
start learning and all other things fall in place .

Subject: [Ilugc] interesting things you do with jQuery and HTML DOM model
Message-ID: <CALDskyy+_8otEECdP=uQbnPi2cvMV9YNkSG4irAearn1x0EyXQ@mail.gmail.com>

We saw few examples for getting started on web programming.

But I am not going to repeat the general structure of code.

You have to know how to write a complete html document, the javascript
will go into the head section.

And CSS also will go there. You can include multiple CSS or javascript
sources using the same syntax I
 showed.

The main part of the code is what you write under

<script type="text/javascript">
$(function() {
                                    <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Here
})
</script>

So this is called the document.load() callback. Once your page load in
the browser either using file:/// or
 http:/// or https:// URL locally or remotely after the whole page
finishes loading the code snippet
 inside the above container will execute.

So I am only going to write the code that goes into this location.

jQuery plugins are included like this.

<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.timer.js"></script>

above the code we write.

Instead of the timer plugin you can include any plugin this way.

You can start learning the way I did by playing with plugins.

You can also open the plugin source code. But javascript is such a
complex language and very unlike
 any other language I am familiar with, so it will take a long time to
get your head around it.

Be patient.

No hurry.

Once you get the joy part of jQuery and web programming and its
possibilities then you will be able to
 justify yourself the pain that is needed to acquire javascript
programming skills.

Let us now look at a simple animation. jQuery does animation in
several different ways.

You have delay(), fadeIn(), fadeOut(), animate() and several other
ways to do simple animations.

But we can also animate using plain javascript.

Basically it is all about causing a slowness, writing some text,
deleting some text or moving DOM elements
 around, changing colors or font characteristics, moving this around and so on.

I am going to write this code tomorrow.

I am finishing this mail.

I will send only the code. You have to figure out the rest. How to get
it working.

Hello Manikantan,

Basically, it seems like many things are wrong with your system. Your Linux
installation is fubar.
Troubleshooting is a waste of time. Backup your data, and your
configuration files, and reinstall Linux.

If someone just chooses adhocly like this, it's a recipe for disaster.
PostgreSQL as well as MongoDB are not just popular but very good DBs to
use. But, they may not always fit for each situations.
What I would suggest is to understand DBMS concepts and then start learning
particular DBs and see how they fit and where they lack.
NoSQL are the big thing today but to understand them better, you need to
understand SQL itself first, NoSQL stands for Not Only SQL, it is built
over and above the SQL concepts instead of being an alternative to them.
Learn the basic SQL concepts, look at your favourite FOSS project and which
DB it uses, learn that DB and look at how the FOSS project uses that DB.
Try to find out why they chose that DB, how do they use it. Find out what
are the cons, pitfalls, workarounds of the DB that they use. Start
contributing to that project. That way you'll not just learn the DB but
acquire many more important skillsets.

You can ask if there are job openings or see if any one puts a need for job
here. This group is best to mentor some one who wants to learn the
technology, the right way.. You can ask what should I do to get employed as
a free software developer or so on. A job consultant will answer that
question eying money, here we just do it because we love tech.

op does not respond to these kind of queries/suggestions , neither he

Thanks karthikeyan for the information.
I am not from a recruitment firm. I try to help people who are looking for
job openings,
by forwarding the CV to known friends/relatives who are working in IT firm.

This is a technical mailing list.   Please let it remain so.

The general guidelines in most LUG mailing list (even though it may
not be specifically mentioned), for job seekers is not to post their
CVs to the mailing list in text or attachment format.

On the other hand, people/companies with JOB openings who are looking
for candidates with domain knowledge in open source do post them from
time to time with special tags like [JOBS] or [COMMERCIAL].

If you are interested in helping people find jobs there are other
venues that cater to that market, plus you can search the archives and
approach such individuals/companies who are potential employers in a
polite/professional manner and not spam them.

How did you manage to remove crontab?    Yum would have warned you
before going ahead with the deletions!

http://techrights.org/2013/06/09/reddit-infiltrated/

?Mind Control: To control mental output you have to control mental
input. Take control of the channels by which developers receive
information, then they can only think about the things you tell them.
Thus, you control mindshare!?

?Microsoft, internal document [PDF]

\quote
Those who like Canonical can pretend that Microsoft has changed [1, 2,
3, 4] are doing everyone a massive disservice, helping to lend
credibility to what clearly remains a criminal enterprise where
ordinary people get abused and accomplices share a loot with Ballmer,
Gates, and the rest of this legendary Mafia. If you had been on the
receiving end of their attacks, you too would understand how serious
this whole matter is and why federal action is needed. The FTC hardly
did a thing when I filed formal complaints about these abuses by
Microsoft; the FTC is there to serve corporations (as in rich managers
and shareholders), not people. This means that nobody is regulating
against AstroTurfing, not in the land of PRISM anyway

Subject: [Ilugc] some web animations
Message-ID: <CALDskyyCbW-x1T5x366_Ns+RWhEoFoacpM40NtF7dGY9ToWBhA@mail.gmail.com>

Now we will see some simple jQuery animations.

We can do some really amazing stuff with jQuery without even getting the
 first ideas about javascript.

At least that is what happened with me.

And even now I don't claim to understand javascript.

It ha many elements of C and syntax and has many ideas from several
different programming ideologies
 that I don't even know.

It is thoroughly object oriented, it works only inside a browser, it
is fully asynchronous which makes
 programming really hard and along with jQuery has a fabulously
economical syntax and power of
 expression like C.

Alright, I wish to make one more general observation.

Yesterday I showed you where the code should go.

Today I will tell you where the data should go.

The HTML DOM that we manipulate with code is the data for us.

</head>
<body>
                  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Data goes here
</body>
</html>

Our data goes here.

In my samples I will show the code and data and occasionally give
complete samples but you
 should know what is what.

Alright. Let us see a very simple animation. Text vanishing after a
few seconds and text appearing after a few seconds.

Code:

  $('h1').fadeOut(6000);
        $('h2').fadeOut().text("Newly added text").fadeIn(6000);

Data:

  <h1> Hi there this will vanish </h1>

        <h2> </h2>

I checked up with them.
It seems they do not discuss policy or FOSS adoption :(

The whole exam system can be easily done in FOSS.

Amazing stuff, Girish. I admire your zeal to share knowledge.
I have done my share of JavaScript programming, though I am still learning
jQuery.
So this is very helpful and welcome knowledge indeed!

I agree with Karthikeyan -- you should start a blog.
Your educational-style is like a mafia-style drive-by shooting. Very hit or
miss!

Organize thoughts, and code more examples.
Have a discussion forum to get feedback from readers.
Maybe you will end up converting all that content into a jQuery book!

Best wishes,

Hi All,

Dhvani is a TTS converter for Indian languages. It will be very
helpful for Indian people. As more and more people are using mobile
and portable devices a TTS with support Indian language will really
improve their lives. Interested people can contribute to this. Please
see the forwarded mail thread for more info.

Dhvani was started some time back and the development slowed down as
the original developers were busy with other stuffs. Now Shrini and I
are planning to improve the code. Shrini has put the code in
https://github.com/tshrinivasan/dhvani-tts for easy collaboration.

As the code base is small more people can easily understand and
improve it and it is a great software for students to contribute code.
This can be a great platform for everyone to learn, get introduced to
many like minded people and have fun.

Thanks and Regards,
PrasannaKumar Muralidharan

Through hosting it in github we are planning to continue the good work
done so far.

Need to update doc and readme files to point the github repository
instead of sourceforge. Pointing it out will help users in getting the
latest code. Migrating other content from sourceforge will be better.
Having a custom page with dhvani's description will be great.

Expecting to have more contributors to dhvani and more users.

Thanks and Regards,

I don't have any such aspirations.

Just ask questions if my code does not work or if there is anything
technical to say.

I can do without non technical comments.

Ok, I have some technical comments for you.
First, you say that JavaScript is thoroughly object-oriented. This is not
true. I have personally gotten a lot of use out of JavaScript without
object-orientation.
Second, you say that JavaScript runs in the browser only. This is also not
true. I used LiveWire, a server-side JavaScript technology in the 1990's.
Today, we have node.js, another cool technology that runs out of the
browser.

My intention in pointing you to the blogosphere, my dear Girish, is for you
to educate yourself, before you try to educate us.
A blog, with a forum lets readers post educational technical questions and
comments, in perhaps a more confrontational style than is appropriate for
this list.

I do wish you would reconsider. I am eager to learn more about jQuery!

Best wishes,

- Ashwin.

Do more and more coding.Less and less talking.

Talking will not feed you. Coding and experience will.

I will be really happy if you ask me technical questions.

I tried your code, your style sucks, your explanation is not
 adequate, this is wrong, you can add this etc.

But I think LUG will become like that when I am 80 years old.

We will now look at how to do a simple counter using jQuery.

Counting can be done in many many ways.

I am illustrating one such.

Code:

var cnt = 0;
function counting() {
        cnt++;
        if(cnt == 10000) {
                cnt = 0;
        }
        $('p').text(cnt);
}

$(function() {
        $('h1').fadeOut(6000);
        tmr = setInterval("counting()", 200);
        $('#stop').click(function() {
                clearInterval(tmr);
                $('p').text('stopped');
        });
        $('#start').click(function() {
                tmr = setInterval("counting()", 200);
        });
        $('#reset').click(function() {
                cnt = 0;
        });
})

Data:

 <h1> Hi there this will vanish </h1>

        <p> </p>
        <input id='stop' type="button" value="Stop counting" />
        <input id='start'  type="button" value="Start counting" />
        <input id='reset'  type="button" value="Reset counter" />

Result?

Code explanation:

It is simple. If you know C programming, javascript and something about web.

You have three different buttons, 3 different ids for each.

id is an attribute of a HTML DOM object or node.

Each of the buttons have an identifier. There can only be one id in one page.

You cannot repeat the same id in a page.

Now you register click() handlers for each of the buttons. We want the
buttons to
 do something for us. That is why they are there.

That is done with this code.

$(selector).click(function() {

           BODY

});

So here you can specify that when you click on the particular id or
button the BODY will be executed.

That is what I use to do the counting.

And setInterval() and setTimeout() are two basic javascript functions
used in all animations.

Hi all

Starting a Series of 1 Day 1 Command for beginners
starts with vmstat command

command: vmstat
purpose:  Reports virtual memory statistics.

syntax: vmstat [ -f ] [ -i ] [ -s ] [ -I ] [ -t ] [ -v ] [ -w] [ -l ] [ {
-p | -P } pagesize | ALL ] ALL ] [ PhysicalVolume ... ] [
Interval [ Count ] ]

The vmstat command reports statistics about kernel threads, virtual memory,
disks,
traps and pocessor activity. Reports generated by the vmstat command can be
used
to balance system load activity

examples:

1.  To display a summary of the statistics since boot, enter:
     # vmstat
2.  To display five summaries at 2-second intervals, enter:
     # vmstat 2 5
3.  To display a summary of the statistics since boot including statistics
for logical disks scdisk1 and
     scdisk2, enter:
     # vmstat scdisk1 scdisk2
4.  To display fork statistics, enter:
     # vmstat -f
5.  To display the count of various events, enter:
     # vmstat -s
6.  To display time-stamp next to each column of output of vmstat, enter:
     # vmstat -t
7.  To display the I/O oriented view with an alternative set of columns,
enter
     # vmstat -I
8.  To display the VMM statistics for all page sizes that are supported on
the system, enter:
     # vmstat -p ALL
9.  To display all the VMM statistics available, enter:
     # vmstat -vs

file: /usr/bin/vmstat contains the vmstat command

it is a performance tuning command

Hi,

Planning to conduct a hackathon for dhvani tts.

Things that can be done include:
1. Packaging dhvani
2. Writing test cases, sample application or improve the existing ones.
3. Simple bug fixes and code improvement. The code base is small and
people can easily understand.
4. Porting to Android and Windows.

We require space to host the hackathon. It may need to accommodate 15

Subject: [Ilugc] CSS anime part II
Message-ID: <CALDskyxusBdd87GmbB2S-k+Lff-UcntxbXhSOPk2Vpgx-qrCGg@mail.gmail.com>

today we are going to see some more CSS color animation.

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/cssanime2.html

Code:

  off = 10;
function changecolor() {
        off += 5;
        $('#block1').css({background: '#ffcc' + off });
        $('#block2').css({background: '#ccff' + off });
}

$(function() {
        $('#stop').click(function() {
                clearInterval(tmr);
                location.reload();
        });
        $('#start').click(function() {
                tmr = setInterval("changecolor()", 200);
        });
})

Data:

 <h1> CSS anime part II</h1>

        <div id="block1">First block  </div>
        <div id="block2"> Second block </div>

        <input id='stop' type="button" value="Stop CSS anime" />
        <input id='start'  type="button" value="Start CSS anime" />

Just some change of colors.

That is all.

Tomorrow we will see a variation of this concept.

 St. Joseph's College of Engineering, Chennai, India, June 14, 2013
Message-ID: <CABG-yt0GBYzt1XGUf9cNvr5aes8p82uDqW6dFheu1dcM240TpA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

A Fedora workshop was organised at St. Joseph's College of Engineering
[1], Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India on Friday, June 14, 2013. The
participants were students from the Master of Computer Applications
(MCA) department.

The forenoon session began with an introduction to Free/Open Source
Software (F/OSS) and Fedora. I explained the various project and
communication guidelines [2] that students need to follow, and
mentioned the various Fedora sub-projects [3] that they can contribute
to. System architecture, and compilation concepts were also discussed.
The need to use free and open standards was emphasized. Copyright, and
licensing were briefly addressed.

After lunch, a programming lab session was held to see how students
solve problems. Their code was reviewed, and suggestions for
improvement were given. Klavaro [4] was shown to students to learn
touch typing. I also gave an overview of GCC using the "Introduction
to GCC" [5] presentation. The concept of using revision control
systems was illustrated. A demo of Fedora 18 (x86_64) was shown, and
the same was installed on the lab desktops.

Thanks to Prof. Parvathavarthini Mam for working with me in organizing
this workshop. Thanks also to Prof. Shirley for managing the
logistics.

Few photos taken during the trip are available in my /gallery [6].

SK

Subject: [Ilugc] jQuery and Ajax
Message-ID: <CALDskywqCB8N9wDhx_2boMOHsAvJVFsFLoCJtC06Cxp6vY83yg@mail.gmail.com>

This example uses jQuery and Ajax. Instead statically typing text in
javascript a server side script, perl CGI
 generates this.

This is very powerful. Now it is lame. But tomorrow we see how to do cool stuff.

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/simplejquery2.html

<html>
<head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/stylesheet.css" type="text/css" />
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.min.js"> </script>
        <script>


$(function() {
        $('#add').click(function() {
                $('#container').load('/cgi-bin/text');
        });
        $('#clear').click(function() {
                $('#container').empty();
        });
})
        </script>
</head>
<body>
        <h1> Simple jQuery II </h1>

        <input id='add' type="button" value="Add Ajax text" />
        <input id='clear' type="button" value="Clean up" />

        <div id="container"></div>

</body>
</html>

The CGI is:

#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI;

$q = new CGI;

print $q->header;


print "<br/>";
print "<br/>";
print "<h2> This is from Ajax </h2>";
print "<br/>";
print "<br/>";
print "END";

Message-ID: <CALDskyydgSm9Re8iEC5PmZWF+bk4ew_sCxkgyid=+4G+EH=g2w@mail.gmail.com>

It is very easy to make money.

It is very easy to create a software product.

It is also easy to sell on the Internet.

Okay?

Do as I say.

Don't ask me why I am poor and unsuccessful. I am only good at giving
 practical advice that works.

Netflow is a Cisco standard for measuring the traffic flows in a network.

By that I mean your LAN.

Nowadays packet traffic determine how busy your hotel business is.

Think of a hotel.

100s of tables, 4 at each and 10 waiters. Food is being served. Plates
are cleaned.

And people walk to wash their hands.

Also cash is collected and change given.

People move around carrying the "business".

In the software equivalent, this happens using packets.

In your LAN, say college LAN some are playing games, some watching
p0rn, some watching
 some youtube movie, some reading up , some playing with network protocols.

Netflow gives you a way to instrument a node in your network, say your
router or firewall to
 passively identify the traffic patterns, how many packets are coming
in from Noda A to Node B,
 how many going out, which protocol and so on.

SNMP or simple network management protocol is used to query a network
entity that runs an SNMP server or
 agent to report the various system statistics. But netflow has
nothing at all to do with SNMP.

Netflow passively measures the traffic flows. And tells you which IP
address is using up how much bandwidth
 and for how long.

It is a really cool tool.

SNMP works differently. You have managers and agents and you query
every node to know which processor,
 how much RAM, what disk usage is there and of course, how many
network interfaces are there, what their
 usages are etc.

SNMP may or may not be enabled.

It works by querying. But netflow will tell you everything by just
running a netflow daemon, a collector that
 sits in the node that sees all the packets in your network. Typically
a forwarder like your default gateway.

And once you have to data, then what?

Create graphs, tell the sys admin that you have to provision more
bandwidth or block p2p traffic and so on.

It is a really fantastic forensic and educational tool to study your
demographics.

What does this have to do with money making?

Well Zoho has been making money using this technology and many others.
They created useful dashboards,
 they created useful tools to collate the data, to visually represent
and analyze this.

Despite there being 100s of free tools they are able to make money. Why?

People pay money for convenience. When they don't have to work hard.

Almost all open source tools require you to work a little bit to see
pretty graphs of netflow.

There you go.

Products don't have to be made from scratch. You can piggyback on a
really good concept.

Hi
I am using Fedora 18, when i run the above explained(iostat) command it's
giving error. No command found.
Is this command come with default installation or have to install later.

The way to find out which package provides it is to use:

  $ yum whatprovides "*bin/iostat"

You need to install the sysstat package that provides iostat.

Please don't top-post when you reply.

Hi to every one.

my task is send to email with using AWS.

so i have sign up for (Amazon Web Services)AWS . and i have got secrete
keys, and keys.i have downloads SDK for PHP and i have copy,past to my
direct path(/opt/lampp/htdocs/amazon/aws)


i have write the initals(fresh) code.below these codes


<?php

// Include the SDK using the Composer autoloader
require 'amazon/aws/aws-autoloader.php';

use Aws\S3\S3Client;

// Instantiate the S3 client with your AWS credentials and desired AWS
region
$client = S3Client::factory(array(
            'key' => 'AKIAI3RFK7VX6KPAVWQQ',
            'secret' => 'nfvjefVOCfGmCkwDfWtwdyJi12Prvum3K86ab5hZ',
        ));



$bucket = 'bala';

$result = $client->createBucket(array(
    'Bucket' => $bucket
        ));

// Wait until the bucket is created
$client->waitUntil('BucketExists', array('Bucket' => $bucket));
?>

and save these codes and run  browser ,

but its not working, i have found below these errors


Warning: require(aws/aws-autoloader.php) [function.require]: failed to open

You have to use AWS Simple Email Service(SES) to send mail.
http://aws.amazon.com/ses/

Currently your using S3, S3 is used for storing files not for email service.

This is a simple PHP library designed for easy interaction with Simple
Email Service. Documentation and example code can be found here:

I am doing it in a future occasion.

I figured out netflow after nearly 4 years. So I am happy.

I shall send a command and dump.

We need two components:

1) netflow collector(softflowd on openbsd)

2) netflow reader (flowd-reader)

Using these two we can obtain the packet flows.

I shall give you a sample soon.

It is a very good initiative to send emails every day about various
Linux commands and I fully appreciate that. I feel it would be better
if you added the name of the command in the email so that it becomes
easier to later search for a particular command.

However, it might also be worthwhile to start a blog and start putting
stuff there - get exposed to a much wider audience.  Others can chip
in with their own favorites.

FWIW - I have discovered dstat; it combines the functionality of some
of the tools posted thus far.

    I think Bharati Subramanian started a blog for his ODOC series, to
which posts could be made via emails. May be he will have some
pointers on how to do that. Thanks

One needs to deliver something to make money. If software is free, just giving software does not deliver any value and this no business can be transacted.

If free shows is used as a bar and deep knowledge of the software, domain and integration is packaged and sold as training, configuration services, customisation, integration with other packages, there is able money to be made.

Who says there is no money to be made? I am a living counter-example.

I have been programming with Open Source software since 1995.
All my money has come from participating in the Open Source bazaar.
Salaries well above Rs. 1 crore / year are not unheard of in the Open
Source world, if you are in the right place at the right time with the
right skills.
The money to be made comes from your reputation.
And reputation comes from having released quality Open Source software.
Code, publish, self-promote on social media, repeat till you land your
dream gig!

Best of luck!

- Ashwin.

I felt a little silly, having to "prove this claim". Yet, I did.
I used to be the Webmaster of ei.org and a Perl programmer, in 1995.

LOTs of them. Yet, I won't mention any names in order to keep their privacy.
We are all from India. We made it to the exotic shores of USA, learned to
program in Perl, on top of Linux, and Apache, and mySQL, etc.
We all made $200,000+ / year. We were driven home in company limousines,
served delicious lunches, received massages, champagne etc.

And yet, I hear that those benefits have not quite trickled down to India.
The world is up for some shaking upping.
Don't try to emulate success stories of the past. It's pointless.
Write your own success story.

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

this whole article is misleading and done in a hurry , like blaming the
west for all the rapes in our country.This one is a clear case of
mismanagement in execution ,on the face of it  there was nothing wrong in
the basic idea and they had customers to back them too. Again there are
sparse details we can just speculate.

in any business there are two situations when partners do to get along,
when they have plenty and/or when they do not have any . This looks like a
case when the goose got killed just because of debt.

No there is nothing to feel bad or silly about it , thanks for sharing now
we all know you  better as a person and from where you are coming :-) .
There is one more thing about this market place where people try to bs so

I am in Santa Monica, California at the moment.
Attended a conference called, "Bitcoin: The Future of Payments" in San Jose.
Even though there are risks involved, bitcoin and math-based currencies
like it, are the future.
My feeling is -- money itself is going to be open source.
I would urge Indian techies to take special interest in these math-based
currencies.

in both the above cases you are talking about software as a service , the

from the Free software you write in most of the cases ,  There is one very

This is a very simple concept with setTimeout() but the animation is
very interesting.

<head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/stylesheet.css" type="text/css" />
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.min.js"> </script>

$(function() {
        $('#add').click(function() {
                $(this).attr("disabled", true);
                $('#container').append("<h3>How are
you?</h3><br/><br/><h2>This is sample
text</h2><br/><br/><span>END</span>");
                setTimeout("$('h3').fadeOut();", 5000);
                setTimeout("$('h2').fadeOut();", 15000);
                setTimeout("$('span').fadeOut();", 10000);
                setTimeout("$('#container').html('<h2> I am left

        });
})
        </script>
</head>
<body>
        <h1> Timeouts demo</h1>

        <input id='add' type="button" value="Start demo" />
        <p> Vanishing text demo</p>
        <div id="container"></div>

</body>
</html>

It is actually very simple logic.

I have 3 one shot timers. And together they make a nice animation.

And I also do a smart thing.I disable the demo button till the anime is over.

This is definitely true. Being a contributor to open source is a good way to build skill. Applauds in this space it's seen as a greater endorsements of skill than from an organizational context.

This isn't a AWS problem. PHP is throwing an error, telling you that it
can't find the file aws-autoloader.php in the include_path. Probably it
should have been require(aws-autoloader.php)? Check your directory layout
to figure out what's the correct path.

That's a big true.  As myself being specializing in providing customized
Thinclient solutions for reusing old computers (which I have been doing
since 2002), this expertise has helped my company in bagging a order from
a Government organization for developing Linux based Thinclient OS for
implementing in 10K+ computers.

>From my experience with open source development, there is money to be made
IF the software being developed is more applicable for enterprises rather
than for end consumers.

If you are the author/contributor of an open source product, library or
framework or even if you are not the author but an expert in that product,
companies are willing to pay to have you *consult* with them on the
implementation of that product.

That is where the money is made - in consulting. When I refer to
consulting, I mean:

a) Modifications to the software to meet a specific set of requirements
unique to a client.

b) Implementing the software for the client

c) Rebranding the software with the client's logo, corporate colours. This
can often be charged at a very high rate.

d) Support post implementation

e) Training

Other avenues for revenue generation:

f)  The authors/experts can make money on selling books, guides, and other
sorts of documentation.

g) Some classes of software are dual licensed - open source licensed for
non-commercial use, and commercially licensed for everything else.

h) In the case of software like Mozilla, there may be option to default to
a specific search engine / site. For this the search engine or site will
pony up the funds.

Examples of opensource software which is making a lot of money:

Redhat/JBOSS, Springsource, Eclipse, Joomla, Drupal, Typo3, Liferay,
Alfresco, PostgreSQL, Apache Hadoop.. and most Apache products

In the case of Mozilla,

However, it is unlikely that an end consumer - a retail customer, is going
to pay to receive support or consulting from you.

That was the problem with the Songbird music player. It was a product
intended for individuals to use in their homes. There was a small niche
segment of enterprises who may have been willing to use Songbird for their
own products - example: Philips for the Mp3 players etc, but the value
proposition wasn't strong enough. Someone at Philips can easily download
the source code, make a few changes and brand it as the Philips player.
There wasn't a lot of scope for consulting.

BTW, the name of my company - Songbird Technologies, has nothing
whatsoever to do with the Songbird music player. We were established in
2003 - well before the Songbird player came on the scene.

I think the thread has been misunderstood. No one says that we cant make
money using FOSS. people have said that its hard to monetize.

i am sure there are benefits on learning the foss. i myself in this place
because of FOSS.

most of the FOSS developers are service providers atleast in india. I wish
that these developers would one day build FOSS products that will be used
by worldwide users.

In Songbird case, they were trying to monetize the music player which is a
product (alternative to itunes). Its very rare to see FOSS products that
makes huge money as far as i know.

In services sector, yes i completely agree with various people's comments
related to knowledge, training etc. you can flourish using FOSS.

huge , good and bad are all relative , in fact the whole concept of money
is skewed . Why does one only try to see things with the only one point of
view . What happens to the tons of people who make money using Foss and pay
there Taxes to Govt and help in the economy . Why do we not consider  this
as the one of the ways to get educated when colleges mafias with there
money making schemes are running amok . Why is that someone needs to have
some X amount to be consider successful . I think even the success criteria
in the present society needs to be re looked into . Now we are reaching a
point of being way too OT :-)

This is a very simple concept with setTimeout() but the animation is
very interesting.

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/timeouts.html

<html>
<head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/stylesheet.css" type="text/css" />
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.min.js"> </script>
        <script>


$(function() {
        $('#add').click(function() {
                $(this).attr("disabled", true);
                $('#container').append("<h3>How are
you?</h3><br/><br/><h2>This is sample
text</h2><br/><br/><span>END</span>");
                setTimeout("$('h3').fadeOut();", 5000);
                setTimeout("$('h2').fadeOut();", 15000);
                setTimeout("$('span').fadeOut();", 10000);
                setTimeout("$('#container').html('<h2> I am left
still</h2>');$('#add').attr('disabled', false);", 20000);
        });
})
        </script>
</head>
<body>
        <h1> Timeouts demo</h1>

        <input id='add' type="button" value="Start demo" />
        <p> Vanishing text demo</p>
        <div id="container"></div>

</body>
</html>

It is actually very simple logic.

I have 3 one shot timers. And together they make a nice animation.

And I also do a smart thing.I disable the demo button till the anime is over.

Better load jQuery from  a CDN like this

Message-ID: <CAND2794BoStscrjugV=1+8vwM959PEKZdjw2jpw3f6iE5m8ePw@mail.gmail.com>

Source: http://www.muktware.com/5644/libreoffice-404-available

The Document Foundation [http://www.documentfoundation.org/] , the
organization behind the development of LibreOffice, has announced
LibreOffice 4.0.4
[http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2013/06/19/the-document-foundation-announces-libreoffice-4-0-4/]

This is the last release before 4.1 branch and brings minor updates.
One of the most interesting feature of the upcoming release is that
users will be able to open PFD files and edit them.

According to the press statement, "LibreOffice 4.0.4 features many
improvements in the area of interoperability with proprietary document
formats. This ongoing activity has been instrumental for the choice of
LibreOffice by all major migration projects to free software since
early 2012, including several central and local governments in Europe
and South America."

The next major release 4.1 will introduce many new and exciting
features, including the long awaited font embedding in documents,
which is pushing forward the Open Document Format.

Those of you who wonder when will LO offer a brand new UI, just keep
in mind that the team is cleaning up the huge pile of 'dead' code it
inherited from stagnant OpenOffice. Quite a lot of work is going on
under the hood which may not be visible to an average user.

Subject: [Ilugc] jQuery selectors demo
Message-ID: <CALDskyyfmUXCLeTPmbmA0Tt-A=VHatDrkPVCke0J1hwRJf0e+Q@mail.gmail.com>

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/sel.html

It illustrates how you can do a javascript or jQuery method on a
particular HTML DOM element or a class of elements.

the id= field is used to identify a particular element.You can only
have one id of the same name per page.

The class= field is used to aggregate a class of elements. You can repeat them.

There is much more to it.

CSS selectors and jQuery selectors are identical. jQuery has some
changes but largely you can rely on CSS3 selectors.

Here is the code.

$(function() {
        $('#d').click(function() {
                $('#divex').css({border: "5px solid blue" });
        });
        $('#l').click(function() {
                $('#listex').css({border: "5px solid blue" });
        });
        $('#sec').click(function() {
                $('#listex li:eq(1)').css({border: "5px solid blue" });
        });
        $('#for').click(function() {
                $('#listex li:eq(3)').css({border: "5px solid blue" });
        });
        $('#pa').click(function() {
                $('#paraex').css({border: "5px solid blue" });
        });
        $('#res').click(function() {
                $('#paraex,#listex,#divex').css({border: "none"});
                $('#listex li').css({border: "none"});
        });
})

command: free
purpose: Display amount of free and used memory in the system
              displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap
              memory in the system, as well as the buffers used by the
kernel

Syntax:  free [-b|-k|-m|-g] [-c count] [-l] [-o] [-t] [-s delay] [-V]

options:

Options:
       -b    Display the amount of memory in bytes.

       -c count
              Display the result count times.  Requires the -s option.

       -g    Display the amount of memory in gigabytes.

       -k    Display the amount of memory in kilobytes. This is the default.

       -l     Show detailed low and high memory statistics.

       -m   Display the amount of memory in megabytes.

       -o    Display the output in old format, the only difference being
this
              option will disable the display of the "buffer adjusted" line.

       -s    Continuously display the result delay seconds apart.

       -t     Display a line showing the column totals.

       -V    Display version information.

example:

1. by default free command shows the free and used space of physical and
swap
    memory in kb
    #free
2. switch the free output in bytes/kb/mb/gb
    #free -b
    #free -k
    #free -m
    #free -g
3. To display the totals line at the end, execute free command with -t
option
    #free -t
4. Free command displays the output with buffer line normally. we can
disable
    that line in the display by using -o option
    #free -o
5. With -s optoin, we can activate the display of free to show it in every
    regular intervals for 5 seconds
    #free -s 5

Hello Girish,

This is a Linux list, and we are all interested in learning and teaching,
right?
I like your lucid style of writing. Yet, I would like you to be a better
prepared teacher, Guru-ji.

There really are plenty of technical things wrong with your code.
Back and forth over this list is probably not the best way to gain, and
organize reader feedback.
Here is some feedback from me, which could easily be changed in a
programming blog.
For example: why don't you consistently use the "var" keyword?

In India, traffic lights are more loosely followed than in the US.
Yet, your code should be World Quality, and follow Best Practices, if you
really want to monetize it.

Free advice full of inaccuracies is like pissing in the wind. You're
impressing nobody, but yourself.
Come prepared, because I want to really learn about jQuery, and your stuff
is disorganized, and scattered.

Just my 0.02 BTC

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

The '#' prompt signifies that the user is 'root'. You don't need to be

It is not an overnight affair.

Anybody who says that he is a capable software engineer with just 2
years experience is not
 talking sense.

It is true that capability, attitude and hard work can offset
experience in some cases but nobody
 can become good at complex stuff like web 2.0 coding in just 2 or 3 years.

Anyway I will try to help in my own small way.

Nothing can help you other than your work work.

Stay away from LUG discussions. LUG culture is negative. It is only
talking and not doing.

Anybody who does anything useful in life is not a LUG member...

There you go.

You have to keep on hacking, keep on hacking and pray to God.

Single minded focus will make success come to you.

When you start on something like web programming you must take the
time to learn the concepts
 that go behind the coding.

It is not just logic, coding and mathematical thinking like C or Java
or perl or python.

Like I said yesterday there are selectors, there are HTML DOM
elements,there are class identifiers,
 there are id identifiers.

There can only be one id in a page, but you can have multiple classes.

CSS determines the looks, how a HTML DOM element is positioned in a web page.

And most of jQuery work involves playing with the CSS attributes.

There are many attributes that HTML elements can take. For instance
you can make an element visible
 or invisible.

That is a CSS attribute:

visibility: none

or

display : block

Then a CSS block is written in a specific way. Semicolons, parantheses
and so on.

#foo {
      width: 200px;
      color: blue;
      background: yellow;
}

This is the example of a HTML DOM element whose id is foo.

An ID is preceded by the '#' character in the CSS selector. Same case
with jQuery.

So if you act on the element with id "foo", then you write,

$('#foo').hover(function...

$('#foo').click(function...

and so on.

For instance this element could be written as:

<div id="foo"> </div>

Or it could be,

<p id="foo"> </p>

it could also be,

<ul id="foo">
       <li> first</li>
        <li> second </li>
</ul>

Get it?

Now, if you want to select a bunch of items you use the class attribute.

You can say,

<div class='fooclass'> </div>

<p class='fooclass'> </p>

You can have them in the same page. The class attribute is not unique.

$('.fooclass').hover(function() ...

This is the way jQuery acts on the class name.

The CSS would be,

.fooclass {
          width: 100%;
}

Remember, in CSS, the paranthesis should close, the attribute should
have a : in between and a semicolon in the end.

If you make mistakes it will not work.

As we all know coding is about dotting the i s and crossing the ts...

Then why are you a member of this LUG mailing list and troll endlessly
with your email posts? Didn't you find any other place that is
tolerant to voice your opinions as facts? I find this comment very
offensive and while I can filter your emails,

I think it would be a better idea to set the moderation bit on for
Girish or if that is too much work to moderate, temporarily ban him
from this list.

I think feeding the trolls is going against the list guidelines. You are in
breach of it. Learn to ignore - after all the OP has been on this list long
enough to be annointed the resident troll :-)

Girish has just expressed his opinion about LUG. BTW, I am not trying to
feed the troll in anyway. His opinion might be harsh, but he is entitled to
a point of view. The members should try to understand what is wrong with
the LUG culture from him and see if we can make it better.

I am against any kind of ban on Girish. He is the only poster in the group
who actively posts about his learnings on various topics and that should
continue for the benefit of LUG.

I still see many Sawp twice the RAM, but now I find the best way to go is swap = ram, and swappiness is zero. Adding in more physical memory suits high memory usage best, of course. An example in Ubuntu is at http://askubuntu.com/questions/103915/how-do-i-configure-swappiness

Message-ID: <CADOy0YoOnJVtCn+J4ym2XwTgsBBJajE7Tv2og0gXv-jmvgq86A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all, I need help in writing the SQL Query i am struct at a point.
here goes my case.


I have two tables namely "member" and "payments" example structure of
member is
=========================
|       Id      | Name                |
=========================
|       01      | Red                 |
|       02      | John                |
|       03      | Patrick             |
|       04      | Jane                |


and the payment table is as follows
========================================
|       Id      | Year                |      member_Id      |
========================================
|       01      | 1947                |            02           |
|       02      | 1958                |            03           |
|       03      | 2000                |            03           |
|       04      | 1988                |            04           |

i want to fetch the records from the member table who are not made the
payment in the given year. for example if i enter 2000

it must return
=========================
|       Id      | Name                |
=========================
|       01      | Red                 |
|       02      | John                |
|       04      | Jane                |

can any one tell me how to query it.

thanks in advance.

select mem.id, mem.name from member mem
inner join payment pay on pay.member_id=mem.id
where pay.year<>2000

I'm not sure which ID you would like to return from member or payment. I
have referred to member.

thanks.

I am also against a ban on Girish.

I may disagree with what he says, but I will defend his right to say it.

Girish wastes time, bandwidth, and disk space by posting disorganized,
inaccurate code.
In addition, he is insulting to LUG.

Since Girish is also a member of the LUG list, he is clearly admitting in
his own words, that he is not doing anything useful.
I don't really see his postings bringing much benefit to LUG, unless he
listens to the audience.
There are plenty of books and blogs where this material is well-organized.

Many of us are actively learning technologies, yet we don't see any need to
impress this list with our half-digested learning.

This list is not a Free Speech forum.
His web site / blog is a Free Speech forum where he can post what he likes.

Here, we should learn to participate in community.
That means listening to the audience and adapting accordingly.

Yet, you have to admire this guy's attitude:
I don't care what anyone says! I will code nonsense, and talk nonsense.
You are all negative and useless, but I will teach you anyway.

Girish Guru-ji, we are not worthy of your teachings.
Please go do something useful.
Join Microsoft, and then you won't have time to lecture useless LUG people.

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

Pressing "1" will toggle display of number of cores and load on each of them.

W.r.t 'top' , I like ttyload, a nice tool to visualize cpu load and spikes in a simple plotted terminal graph. I run it in a screen so i can look at it any time by attaching to it.

screen -S myttyload? -> creates a screen called myttyload
screen -x myttyload -> attaches to it ; 
ctrl+A, then d -> detaches from screen without exiting.

Message-ID: <CALDskyyJ5kwVQ2gMmoJukrV=3qJtc7j3w9pa49ww09LjF0PZcA@mail.gmail.com>

Okay now you know that I am using the word animation for any live
update on a web page
 you do with jQuery.

Here is a progressbar animation.

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/progressbar.html

The code is easy. I am using a plugin here. Many of my jQuery classes
will use certain
jQuery plugins that you can download either from my website as I
indicated last time or
 even from the other websites out there.

I am using the jqueryprogressbar.js plugin here.

Also it is worthy of mention that the spidermonkey package can help
you learn javascript.

You can try out many different things using the

js>

prompt that you can get on any UNIX box.

It is not a browser environment but you can certainly benefit by the
logic of javascript and its syntax.

Always remember.

Javascript is an ASYNCHRONOUS programming language.

Everything that you do it does in parallel.

This is unlike any other programming paradigm. This makes javascript
coding very complex and
 challenging.

But we are beginners now. Let us first get our feet wet.

Learning CSS is not easy. I have still not learnt it. It can be fun.
So don't feel bad if you are having trouble
 mastering it.

It is not just UI design or artistic. CSS is the heart of web
programming. So be  cool and learn it.

Guru-ji, now that you have shouted a word in all caps, could you kindly
explain it further?
What does asynchronous mean? What does multithreaded mean? Is there a
difference? Which one is JavaScript? And which is jQuery?

Instead of duplicating the year entries in the above, you can create a
separate table for Year with "Id", and "Year", and use Year_Id in the
above.

You can see javascript recursion.

You can also guess why I am using it if you think a little(async).

And this is a nice effect.

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/vanishimage.html

Code:

function onebyone(el) {
        el.slideUp(6000, function() {
                el = arr.shift();
                if(el == null) {
                        return;
                } else {
                        onebyone(el);
                }
        });

}

Code explanation:

Perhaps you are getting some whiff of what I am talking.

This language javascript is an amazing thing.

It allows not only creative thinking and several animations, it also
forces you to
 do the right thing.

Otherwise you will not get the result you want.

Are you confused what is javascript and what is jQuery?

That is fine. I also went thro' the same.

Now, the initial bottleneck I had in this code was the CSS.

How to align the images next to each other?

After I cracked it with the float attribute and few other CSS techniques my next
 challenge was to make the images slide up and disappear one by one.

As you can see, there is an automatic sequencing enforced by HTML DOM when you
 place the elements on the page.

And jquery each() function will help you iterate through them using
the class selector.

I used the class 'vanish' I selected using '.vanish' and I also
selected the images which is a
 child of vanish div.

$('.vanish img').each()

will iterate through each of the image elements one by one.

Then I stored them in a javascroipt array arr and I used the slideUp()
callback and recursion to
 go through them one by one.

If you don't understand the last sentence that is okay.

One thing at a time.

God almighty! Have you heard of github at all?
And why don't you just create a new.html file, instead of asking the user
to do extra steps?

My friend, I am beginning to wonder if you really are as stupid as you

It is great and refreshing that you have come up with that topic.

AFAIK, There is no *one* method, the silver bullet. And No IIT has any
specific course on maintenance/troubleshooting.

There are no formal books that cover that, though most are covered and
spread across various books/articles

The important thing to know is there there are many subsystems to
understand as each has it own set of tools (very powerful ones at
that).

If you can elaborate, perhaps some of us can share our experiences.

I will try and outline some broad points below

0. Ensure that there is trouble and determine if it is persistant
(like a data centre on fire/No power), intermittant or transient.
1. Isolate the fault in the following main areas - Hardware, Software,
Connectware or Humanware. (some inspection tools/monitoring tools)
2. Use the right tool to shoot the problem in the head
3. Collect your money and live happily ever after wishing that another
trouble will be there (well maintenance people need to eat too)

This is also a cool animation.

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/appearimage.html

Code:

            return;
                } else {
                        onebyone(el);
                }
        });

}
        var arr = [ ];
$(function() {
        $('.vanish img').css({display: "none" });
        $('.vanish img').each(function() {
                arr.push($(this));
        });
        onebyone(arr.shift());
})


Notice that I use the CSS display property to blank out the images and
I also use a callback function at the
 end to signal that the effect is over.

Actually every slideUp() or slideDown() body is a callback.

That is why the operations happen one by one.

Most jQuery API functions have callbacks.

They are optional. If you don't specify anything the API will still work.

Ditto with Ajax calls.

Ajax is by nature async. Moreover uploads and downloads do take time
even in the LAN.

So typically page load event, mouse hover event, mouse click event,
ajax download event and so on
have callbacks.

A javascript callback function is very funny with plenty of special characters.

function() {

});

Something like that.

I took a long time to wrap my brain around so many brackets.

And javascript functions are first class objects just like lua.

So you can easily attach them to objects. And jQuery has the concept
of object chaining.

But I have been able to achieve a lot without giving much thought to
such advanced OO ideas.

1. Go to your browser's location bar. It is usually white, and horizontal,
and should be located near the top of the screen.
2. Once you have found the location bar, as referenced in step 1 ( see
above ), you should give it keyboard focus. I will write about how to give
keyboard focus in the next step. Keep learning, Ok?
3. To give keyboard focus, you have to click into your browser's location
bar. Clicking is explained in the next step.
4. To click, you have to move the mouse. You know what a mouse is, right?
It is ASYNCHRONOUS!

I will write the rest later.

128738127361873. And then type "Linux troubleshooting" in the Google search
bar.

I going to integrate these ideas into an image anime demo soon.

I will also illustrate not just click button even which we have been using so
 far but also use a select event to change behavior.

HTML form elements, input text box, password field, drop down menus and so on
 can all be manipulated well using jQuery.

We will look at them soon.

Actually, a 'callback' function is no different from any other function in
javascript. And it does not have any funny special characters in it either.
The above snippet in wrong syntax! The ')" at the end is the closing
bracket of the invoked function to which this anonymous function was passed
as an argument.

So, this function is only:
  function(){
  }

Pls take your time to wrap your mind around this fact and appreciate its
just another function definition.

Now this need not necessarily be a 'callback' but could also be a function
that does some useful work inside of the calling function.

If the intention was to learn something and to put it to good use, it would
not have taken much time to wrap your mind around it!!! But your intention
seems to be to post half baked snippets, without even understanding it
properly, just to massage your ego and rile other people's coding
sensibilities. So, its not surprising!

If the intention is to help, then we want to support you.
Use non-invasive tools, like a github repository, and a blog.
We will all send you changes, and suggestions, which you may decide what to
do with.
Seeing elegant working code in one location is a lot easier to wrap one's
brain around, than having it scattered all over a mailing list.
This could grow into a community resource for learning about jQuery.
Perhaps even translations into multiple languages will appear.

Incidentally, has anyone used Backbone.js ? I hear it is far more
structured than jQuery, and was designed with jQuery in hindsight.

Learning to interact with people is a must. Single-minded coding did not
make Linux a success.
Linux got started because Linus actually listens to people, and people like
him, and want to learn from him.
Without Social Engineering skills, you are just a robot. Communication has
to be two-way, or you are talking to an empty void.
When you don't listen to your audience, your audience does not listen to
you.

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

If you are new to javascript and want to learn it, do so without adding
jquery to mix. It will confuse you - especially so with the meaning of
'this' inside functions!

Do not mistake me - jquery was (and still is) a fantastic tool that made
web propgramming interesting to many including me. But now that web apps
have got complex, separation of concerns (like model, view, event handing)
have become a bigger issue than just selecting elements and animating them
- jquery's primary strength.

To think in terms of 'separation of concerns' or the big picture
'architecture' of your applications (you do if you want to make a career
out of programming), learn the language well first - without being
distracted by frameworks. I have said this earlier and will say it again:
read the Rhino book.

Then learn a framework like Backbone (I know only backbone and like it, but
there are others too) that operates at the app architecture level.

Following is a link to a pretty good explanation of backbone and jquery in
stackoverflow:

http://stackoverflow.com/a/9730645/751002

Once again, learn the lang javascript well. Its being used in more than
just the browser (nodejs: appserver, couchdb: db server).

>From my experience with open source development, there is money to be made
IF the software being developed is more applicable for enterprises rather
than for end consumers.

If you are the author/contributor of an open source product, library or
framework or even if you are not the author but an expert in that product,
companies are willing to pay to have you *consult* with them on the
implementation of that product.

That is where the money is made - in consulting. When I refer to
consulting, I mean:

a) Modifications to the software to meet a specific set of requirements
unique to a client.

b) Implementing the software for the client

c) Rebranding the software with the client's logo, corporate colours. This
can often be charged at a very high rate.

d) Support post implementation

e) Training

Other avenues for revenue generation:

f)  The authors/experts can make money on selling books, guides, and other
sorts of documentation.

g) Some classes of software are dual licensed - open source licensed for
non-commercial use, and commercially licensed for everything else.

h) In the case of software like Mozilla, there may be option to default to
a specific search engine / site. For this the search engine or site will
pony up the funds.

Examples of opensource software which is making a lot of money:

Redhat/JBOSS, Springsource, Eclipse, Joomla, Drupal, Typo3, Liferay,
Alfresco, PostgreSQL, Apache Hadoop.. and most Apache products

In the case of Mozilla,

However, it is unlikely that an end consumer - a retail customer, is going
to pay to receive support or consulting from you.

That was the problem with the Songbird music player. It was a product
intended for individuals to use in their homes. There was a small niche
segment of enterprises who may have been willing to use Songbird for their
own products - example: Philips for the Mp3 players etc, but the value
proposition wasn't strong enough. Someone at Philips can easily download
the source code, make a few changes and brand it as the Philips player.
There wasn't a lot of scope for consulting.

BTW, the name of my company - Songbird Technologies, has nothing
whatsoever to do with the Songbird music player. We were established in
2003 - well before the Songbird player came on the scene.

Prem Kurian Philip

Trouble shooting methods cannot be "parroted"  You learn it from the
"School of Hard Knocks"  i.e. working in the trenches and "applying
the tools" in an intelligent way.

As for material -  here is a scenario that you can trouble shoot -

1. Your server NIC; the "link" LED is lit (indicating that everything
is hunky dory at frame level).
2. No error messages in the log files.
3. ifconfig -a shows the eth0 device i.e. the driver is properly
loaded.  It also shows the IP parameters (static) configured for the
interface.

4. When you ping a remote host - it fails.
5. When you ping this host from a remote host - it fails.

What will be your next steps to diagnose the problem?

It is not easy.

I took a long time to do this page.

I thought in Javascript I could pass a function name as argument and invoke it.

Though that works in jQuery I could not do it.

But I somehow got the results.

Then I had some CSS bug in which the page was getting mangled with some effects.

But as you can see this is the longest code I have written so far.

Typical lines of code is less than 15. But since this page integrates
a lot of functionality it is much
 bigger.

You also know how to use the switch statement in javascript.

Also the drop down menu using select.

I also use some more logic to ensure a smooth user experience.

The animation has to be reset, the images blanked out or made visible and so on.

Tomorrow we will see how to use HTML forms with CGI.

Clarify your understanding rather than getting results, which suck anyway.

Ok, Girish Guru-ji, you do know that Common Gateway Interface is an
elegant, long-dead, still-alive technology.
We are entering a minefield where ignorance on this topic will be visible
under a microscope to the whole world.
I have done CGI programming myself for a few decades. Let's educate each
other, and the audience on CGI.
Come prepared.

Cheers,

You have to use the netboot supported kernel/initrd image of Ubuntu 12.04

Yup, good idea - I recommend installing and using Gentoo - will pose more
challenges to help you learn. I hear slackware installation is also quite
useful...

Subject: [Ilugc] jQuery and HTML forms
Message-ID: <CALDskyxZBPcBVCECWy5ayhrTMJcZWFhmtE8FLKNo-+4k0njNZA@mail.gmail.com>

HTML form processing is very very critical.

Yesterday Zico asked me how jQuery is useful to an engineer.

First let us figure what makes an engineer.

Engineers are BE graduates, not MCAs but at least 30% of the engineers
I have seen
 in software companies are MCA graduates. They may be doing coding but
they are not
 engineers. And I also rarely find arts graduates doing coding.

Then out of the engineering graduates some go to pursue IAS, some MBA,
some something else
 and so we are left with around 4 engineers from a class of 40.

Now, the general mindset is that unless you work abroad or work in
some big MNC your engineering
 talent is not adequate. That is somewhat true. So count out the
public sector guys. Some public sector
 jobs may be high quality like ISRO, DRDO and so on.

And of course the man makes the job. The job does not make the man. If
you are motivated enough any
 environment can bring out the engineer in you.

Some engineers go on to teach. Now that is not engineering. Unless the
college is Stanford or something
 in which the teachers also stay in touch with engineering.

So as you can clearly see the definition of who makes an engineer is
rather subjective.

Now as a programmer/engineer what importance is to be given to GUI or UI?

It forms a useful addition.

As an entrepreneur without money I have to do all my programming
myself. Even if I had the money I won't
 get the quality I want if I outsource the UI work to somebody else.

Moreover as a networking professional all my products are accessed
using a web panel, a web interface.

You need to know html, http and what not.

And from what I have painfully learnt over the years people pay for
the engineering work only if the work is
 complete with a front view with graphs and html forms and say a
little bit of animation as well.

In the commercial world people pay money for complete polished
products with enough technical information
 given in the form of a UI. And in today's world UI means web interface.

But Zoho makes money using windows UI products. They also have several
products with web interfaces.

At least in my world and in my scheme of things the customer's window
into my product is using the web interface.

And I would not have stuck to web programming if Javascript was a
language like Java or php.

Javascript is a genius and so is jQuery.

And moreover the code that I have written in the last 20 days to LUG
has got such sex appeal that it can easily
 floor anyone.

Including of course the creator.

Okay now let me get to the chase.

HTML forms done in two ways:

using jQuery:

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/jquery_tutorials/htmlforms.html

using CGI:

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/cgi-bin/trial

The CGI version alone has value. The jQuery thing needs to blend with
the CGI backend to save and retrieve data.

And we have to use Ajax for that.

We will see that in the following days.

So I have moved out of animation now. But I am sure we will go back to it.

jQuery is so delightful.

If you want the markups to be sent to another person, I think he needs
the same software atleast as far as Okular is concerned.

I depserately wanted a markup software for PDF files which can travel
as a PDF file to be read in any standard PDF reader. Started using
Foxit (free but not OSS) and now Adobe 10 also has that feature
(Windows only).

Girish,

Pardon me but why are you posting javascript and html related information
on a linux user group? There are excellent mailing lists which deal with
those subjects - wouldn't it be better to post there instead?

Girish,

With due respect to your efforts on sharing thoughts and content pertaining
to javascript, html and CSS I believe your inputs would reach the right
audience if its in a different platform.

With respect to the various content you post, I agree with Prem. Many
people will be benefit out of it, if you can share the content pertaining
to JavaScript and HTML to the respective audience by joining and sharing
such mailing list.

I believe this forum would appreciate anything pertaining to Linux or at
least LAMP.

Hope you would agree with our thoughts.

regards
Siva.

Do you mean that (or rather think) Engineers who do not know some software
coding are not eligible to be called so?
 If so, How come you live in a house?
how come you got a car or bike to travel?
How do you get electricity and computers to type all these stuff?

India has hundreds of Engineering Colleges. Are not some 40000 Engineers
sufficient for making coding for a population of 130 crore?

*Atleast, Can you try to clear UPSC Exams for Engineering Sake?*

If so, Can you please explain me how you learnt Engineering (without

Message-ID: <CAP6xenkZw4JcpD6+tmZbh0z=KsWb0_0ueA8K80Vtt1cEhZ41sQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Friends,

Please refer me some Open Source alternates to:

1) Adobe DreamWeaver
2) Adobe Photoshop
3) Adobe Illustartor

Actually I started learning Web Programming and Designing so my friend
suggested me to use these softwares but I want to use Open Source softwares.

I searched and found few alternates to:
Photoshop >>>> GIMP
Illustrator >>>> Inkscape (not used so far)
DreamWeaver >>>> ????

Please help me.

Thanks in advance.

> DreamWeaver >>>> ????

For HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP development, any plain text editor is enough.

Ask them to come out of Dreamweaver and to use any other text editors
even in windows.
It will make the shift to GNU/Linux easier.

If you want bulkier IDE for easier tasks, you can try eclipse too.

Hello suresh,

This is a mailing list and not a job portal!.

The reply which you posted is to a thread discussing on a technical
subject, you turned that discussion into a job query. This kind of
change of  subject of the discussion is called 'thread hijacking'.
Please do not do so, it is not a part of good email etiquettes.

I guess you are new to this list, job announcement will be coming when
there is need. Do keep a watch on this mailing list.

Hi,

My take on this discussion.

ilugc is a Linux user group and supports all foss tools.

In my opinion , writing on JavaScript is good, provided the code  is
free from all sorts of errors.
If this kind of technical write up is placed on a blog, it will help
the reader a lot comparing to be laying in scattered mails.
Having said that, If the writing is confined strictly to the subject
and not ventilating ill formed commentary will be good for this group.

regards,
Thyagarajan Shanmugham

It appears to be free (as in beer) with an unlimited eval time (for
now).  Did not see any statement about license except for having to
purchase license key.

The OP wants opensource alternatives; presumption being the package is
available under one of the several open source licenses.

Subject: [Ilugc] jQuery cycle plugin slideshow
Message-ID: <CALDskyxKsWarfFWqUv4sZtFL-VN+qEiaRJSP9VWXbjDqd91sNA@mail.gmail.com>

Look at the bottom of the page:

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/jquery_tutorials/

The source is simple:

<html>
<title>jQuery slideshow</title>
<head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/stylesheet.css" type="text/css" />
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.min.js"> </script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.cycle.lite.js"> </script>
        <script>
$(function() {
        $('#gallery').cycle();
})
        </script>
</head>
<body>
        <h1> Photo gallery</h1>

        <div id="gallery">
                <img src="/images/forest1.jpg" />
                <img src="/images/forest2.jpg" />
                <img src="/images/island1.jpg" />
                <img src="/images/island2.jpg" />
                <img src="/images/mount1.jpg" />
                <img src="/images/sunrise.jpg" />
        </div>

        <div id="footer" >
                <p> jQuery cycle plugin simple demo </p>
                <p><a href="http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle">jQuery
Cycle plugin</a></p>
        </div>
</body>
</html>

I shall henceforth add new tutorials to the bottom of the above page.

So bookmark and keep checking for my daily updates.

However there is a problem here.

The very first image is shown towards the right side. But the rest of
the slideshow
 happens centered.

I could not fix it.

It is a CSS bug.

First time I confess my ignorance of CSS. I am sure I have many dark corners.

But so far I have been able to achieve what I wanted with jQuery.

The integrated image anime thing was truly satisfying.

I do not frequently post on ilugc, but I do read quite a few of the posts
that come in and I am really sorry to say that the quality of the lug has
gone down considerably since some of the stalwarts left the list (Kg).

Now ilugc is now more of a web developer's user group with random
discussions about Adobe Dreamweaver alternatives, jquery, html and so on.

All of those are interesting discussions, no doubt, but they are offtopic
on this list.

If most of the content is going to be on HTML, Javascript and so on, those
who are interested in linux content will go elsewhere and the list will
become a place where web developers hang out.

I request the moderators to take note of this.

Also, I request those people like Girish to please find another place to
post content totally unrelated to linux.

Girish - like Thyagarajan pointed out, it may be better to post the
tutorial/tip type of content that you are writing to a blog or a wiki. I
am sure it will be useful to those who are interested in that sort of
thing and in any case a mailing list isn't the best format for doing
tutorials.

Girish, if you create such a blog, I will be happy to both visit the blog
on occasion and perhaps even contribute content.

I thank you for your understanding.

Regards,
Prem

Sir, I apologize if my question seems to be as #OtherTopic but my intention
was not that. Even I am also an OpenSource Enthusiast. Learning new things
and their alternates to Open Source is also important because for some task
you must need a software/framework. I searched on google for the same query
and posted my question on LUG so get some expert views on this.
If my mail was #OT for LUG then I will never do this again.

IMO, it is OK to ask for open source alternatives on any topic
(developer, sys/net admin, advocacy ....).

AFAIK, this is where a lot of open source geeks hang out and someone
may know the answer to a query.

I don't think there is anything wrong about what Girish is trying to
do here. This is LUG but that does not mean we have to close our minds
to other technical concepts. Only rarely do we some truly 'Linux only'
posts, and most of the them are about people asking for simple noob
stuff without even googling, or people asking about software
installations etc ... oh and even obituaries. Most of these rarely add
value to the knowledge of the community. And what was it about this
being for web developers? For those of you who don't know,  javascript
is now a firstclass citizen in the gnome community. You can develop
full fledged GTK3 and gnome DESKTOP applications using javascript. You
may find it usefull to learn.

Who are the people using linux anyway? Right now, only people willing
to experiment with cool new stuff (mostly programmers) and your
average Joe who uses it only because its installed in their work
machine. I doubt the later will join a mailing list like this. And I
don't see why we should not discuss the programming languages (even
web). Girish and few others here take time to type long mails to share
their knowledge with us. When people with long experience and strong
industry background have something to say, its better to listen
instead of trying to find faults.

Its true that we are LUG, but by bashing anything and everything
nonlinux (including windows stuff), we are not behaving any better
than those apple and windows fanboys. We have to be more open to FOSS
stuff in general and discuss anything of interest. We can gain
something just be seeing two people discuss BSD instead of chasing
them away in the name of linux. I hope we see more posts like this in
the future.

Source: http://www.theorangenotebook.com/2013/06/feeling-saucy-help-us-test-new-release.html


Join the ubuntu quality community team's effort this week! As a
community we test different things about every ~2 weeks in ubuntu, and
share the results to flesh out bugs and problem areas.

So what's up for testing this week? The daily images, the default
applications in ubuntu and a new version of the sound stack for
testing.

Ready to help? Full details are here.
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Cadence/Saucy/Week1

Need some help on how to contribute? Have a look at this page and the
walkthroughs [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/QATracker] listed. Of
particular interest is the ISO
testing[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/ISO/Walkthrough] and Cadence
Week testing walkthroughs.[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Cadence/Walkthrough]

Do note that you don't need anything special to participate in cadence
week testing! Both an installed version of the development branch of
ubuntu (aka saucy) in a VM or on a real box, or even a live session of
the latest daily image will work. For more information on how to use a
live session to test, check out the Cadence Week testing walkthrough
or watch the youtube video of the
same.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw7SrLUzW6U]

Happy Testing!

What is a VSP?  or did you mean VPS?

Item 15 in the list guidelines refers an URL on how to ask for help
<http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#beprecise>.

Without detailed errors, even the fedena developers will be clueless
vis-a-vis your problem.  At a min. you must mention your distro,
version, cpu arch, installing from repo pkg or latest tar ball  etc. +
the error messages you get on the console and/or in the relevant log
files.

> can anyone please help me. any guides or

You don't mention what docs you have referred to so far.

search key words "fedena install guide" lists the fedena install guide
in the first hit!
<http://www.projectfedena.org/install>

Have you read it and met the system pre-requisite *before* attempting
to install fedena?

Maybe this fedena appliance will help you get going

Dear Mr Rao ,
                    Do not try to do this again , you are
creating unnecessary clutter by cross posting something which does not
 belong here . If you do want to share something write few lines about it
what is it about then give pointers to the mailing list the discussion is
happening , people who are interested will participate there.

i still do not get what is the point in posting with links which do not
work too , i presume you did not bother to look into it yourself.

Have you tried searching with keywords (lifted from your OP)  ".net in centos"
and read any of the search results therein?

Is it free/open source software? Otherwise, you will need to ask the
vendor (Cisco) for support.

Firstly,   you need to follow list guidelines and *not* top post.

Secondly, list guideline also suggests to provide all the information
/ trouble shooting  that you have *already* tried.
After Shrini posts you links, you come out and say that you have
already tried it.  You could have done this in your OP.

Remember that all members who help,  do so voluntarily w/o any
monetary gains; so use their time without wasting it.

Thirdly, as Kannan pointed out WebEx is a proprietary product, you may
get more focused  help from their user support forums.

I don't disagree that javascript is useful or for that matter any web
technology is useful. The problem is if it is decided that ALL any ANY
technology should be discussed on ilugc merely because some of these
technologies may be deployed on linux, then we can might as well entertain
discussions on how to do 3D modelling in Blender, how to use Hadoop, how
to programme in PHP, MySQL query optimisation, Node.js programming, Java,
Boost libraries in C/C++, Android development etc.

Again, not that any of those technologies aren't useful. But then we would
have made ilugc so generic that pretty much any software can be discussed
here. If that is what the moderators want, then so be it.

About who is using Linux - Linux is heavily used in various industries
now. Linux is no longer the niche OS that it used to be. I use it pretty
much exclusively and so also a lot of people who work with me. Some of the
larger firms even here in India use Linux for hosting their servers, and
quite a few of the organisations even have their desktops running on
Linux.

When people like me come to ilugc we come with the expectation that there
will be content here which is closely related to linux and not just
tangentially related.

Examples:
Linux installation and setup
Linux kernel
Core applications - eg: X, Gnone, KDE, Unity, Wayland, ..
File systems
Discussions about drivers and issues with drivers (example, how to get
Airtel/Aircel/Whatever 2G/3G Dongles working with Linux)
Upgrade issues
Security issues and alerts for Linux and core services such as Apache,
Bind, etc
Linux networking
Package manager and related updates
FOSS Conferences
News on organisations, colleges etc requiring help with Linux
Tips on unusual linux commands
News about any government initiative related to Linux or opensource

And of course obituaries. All the people whose obituaries were listed here
were stalwarts in FOSS circles in India - Kg, Chitnis etc. Many of us have
dealt with these people personally.

I have been involved in Linux since at least 1995 and I subscribed to
ilugc around 1997-1998 or so, I think. (I don't have the old posts with me
anymore).

It will be sad if ilugc loses focus. In my humble opinion, it would be
better to concentrate on a few areas and have a clearer focus for ilugc
even if the volume of discussion reduces rather than opening up the
discussion to any subject however tangentially related to Linux.

But of course, this is just my opinion. The moderators will need to decide
the direction.

Thank you,
Prem

About ILUGC 
ILUGC was started on 1997 and it is an one of the oldest Linux Users Group in India. We are a heterogeneous group of computer users from the South Indian city of Chennai (aka Madras), united in our use of Free/Libre/Open Source Softwares and support of Software Freedom in general and the GNU/Linux in
particular. Most of our monthly meetings see a technical talk, not
necessarily on GNU/Linux but also on FSF/GNU/OSS/BSD related topics
such as Perl, Python, PHP, FreeBSD, TCP, IP, etc,.

    $ ifconfig -a

3. To disable an interface
    $ ifconfig eth0 down

4. To enable an interface
    $ ifconfig eth0 up

5. To assign an ip-address to an interface
    $ ifconfig ethh0 192.168.1.33

6. To change subnet mask of interface eth0
    $ ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0

7. To change broadcast address of interface of interface eth0
    $ ifconfig eth0 broadcast 192.168.2.33

8. To assign ip-address, subnet mask, and broadcast address
    at same time to interface eth0
    $ ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.33 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.2.33

9. To change the maximum transition unit to xxx for eth0
    $ ifconfig eth0 mtu xxx

10. To enable promiscuous mode
      $ ifconfig eth0 promisc
      in promiscuous mode  the eth card does not drop the packet whether the
      packet belongs to itself or not it allow the packets to flow through it

It seems "ifconfig" is being deprecated in favour of "ip" command

This is a little difficult to explain. But I will try.

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/jquery_tutorials/events.html

I have implemented the events, mouseenter, mouseleave, mousedown on

In the green block I have mousemove and mouseleave.

In the input box I have hover and focus out.

If you keep testing you will figure what I am trying to do.

Javascript has a very rich event subset.

The best I know in working with various software components all my life.

There is of course the page load event, document.load() which is what
jQuery's starting
 point is.

Then till now we saw the click event handler in every project we saw so far.

If you haven?t noticed already, we think our localizers are pretty awesome.
We?re proud to announce that, on top of all the teams that follow the rapid
release process, today?s update to Firefox desktop 22 (and Firefox 23 Beta)
contains major updates to a few localizations that we?d like to call out.

We?d like to thank the teams for their rededicated efforts and commitment
to provide the users of their regions with the best localized browser on
earth. In order to demonstrate the potential impact their efforts have
made, I have outlined the potential number of native speakers of each
language based on the populations of the language?s regions (see
 Ethnologue?s
research <http://www.ethnologue.com>):

   - Gujarati (gu-IN) = 46,633,190
   - Hindi (hi-IN) = 260,302,820
   - Kannada (kn) = 37,739,040
   - Malayalam (ml) = 33,534,600
   - Northern Sotho (nso) = 4,101,000
   - Oriya (or) = 50,137,290
   - Punjabi (pa-IN) = 29,518,600
   - Songhay (son) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songhai_languages> =
   3,400,000
   - Tamil (ta, India) =  68,763,360
   - Telugu (te) = 74,049,000
   - Zulu (zu) = 10,349,100
   - Thai (th) = 20,421,280
   - Maithili (mai) = 32,800,000
   - South African English (en-ZA) = 50, 500,000
   - Hungarian (hu) = 12,319,330
   - Ukrainian (uk) = 36,028,490

Thank you very much and congratulations on your success!

	Now ?
Message-ID: <CAND2796TRm4Q=BuGxWaNruewwWNPxbAP8zAOVunsGgO84xF--g@mail.gmail.com>

Source: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/06/pitivi-survey-2013
Does open-source video editor PiTiVi need improving? If so, in what way?

Those are just two questions that the team behind the tool are hoping
you can help them answer.

A short multi-choice survey is asking PiTiVi users, as well as those
who would use like to use it, where they think development resources
should be focused.

Do you favour fancy effects over stability? Or would you rather have
support for multi-camera editing and automatic audio sync?

The team behind the editor hope that by asking the people who use the
software what they want to see added will ?help make Pitivi a better
tool? for all.

Hit the link below to take the short survey. Answer as honestly as
possible and when done be sure to pass the link on to anyone else you
think would be interested.

It is not what I wanted to do.

But I got almost there.

This scrolls a page automatically.

But I wanted a smooth effect. Looks like I will have to do some
javascript math to get it.

Or of course I can use a ready plugin. There are plenty of scroll plugins.

But I enjoyed doing this one.

hi to all,

currently i'm working on the Xcode to create a database. with in formations
i found it easy with core data. As i was progressing through it was easy
and no issues with it. once the project was over and i tested it in IoS
Simulator only once the table was view and soon it turned into a black
window screen.

The very next time when i tried to run the simulator the error stated as
thread saying the program has received SIGABRT. i also tried suspending the
thread but of no use.

Some experts through Internet advised me some tips as apply break points or
suspend the threads i tried both even then the Error seems to occur the
same way with the Black simulator window

NOTE: As i could have edited the main.m file so i also tried to typing the
whole program once again
the error seems to be in the first line of main function just saying
Program has received SIGABRT

need to know how to kill the thread...

Subject: [Ilugc] hanging on futex call
Message-ID: <CABKAokXKNxw36jV42nF5G9qwtG-O4XDS_ax+YMy5se50m6CDwQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I am writing a program that uses select call to check if a packet is
available in the socket to read. the program has also a timer running
(setitimer) and the resulting SIGALRM is handled using a handler.

the select call is time and again interrupted by the SIGALRM signal. to
avoid this problem, I set sa_flags = SA_RESTART in sigaction structure (i
know SA_RESTART is not a universal solution).

But the program hangs after running sometime. I used strace and found that
it hangs at the system call:

futex(0x763360, FUTEX_WAIT_PRIVATE, 2, NULL

I have some idea as to for what futex is used. But unable to find why my
program hangs over there. Is it the select call that leads to calling of
futex??? apart from select and recv i don't use any other blocking
functions.

This list is for discussing stuff related to Linux and free/libre open
source software. The question you are asking seems to be regarding XCode
and iOS both of which are proprietary. I don't think this is the right
place for such a  question. Asking in forums or mailing lists pertaining to
application development for iOS platform might be of help.

Subject: [Ilugc] jQuery math
Message-ID: <CALDskyx=dAkvYGzUbhJUU2O3XqPtv+gORdn6PhgcXR7DXg7gvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Okay this article is not about jQuery or math.

I am only reasonably proficient at jQuery or javascript math.

I should actually call it javascript math.

jQuery plugins use math but it is all javascript.

Mostly it is offset manipulation, simple math that goes behind easing,
smoothing, curve algebra
 and so on.

So you should know the mathematical background necessary for fx work.

Then you should know javascript syntax which is object oriented.

And the math functions have a syntax similar to C with some OO pooled in.

Then you got it.

If you read the source code of most plugins you find math.

https://raw.github.com/logicbox/jquery-simplyscroll/master/jquery.simplyscroll.js

Not much.

But yes, almost as much math as there is in usual programming but usually more.

I have read lot of source and if you contrast with the source of wget
or curl or less or OpenBSD kernel or Apache or OpenSSL
 then the math content in jQuery plugins are slightly higher.

But the skill required to follow what is going on is a combo of

1) guesswork
2) experience
3) confidence
4) syntax mastery
5) problem domain
6) math skills

But it is not all that hard.

Message-ID: <CALV9omatiBBPW8zXchWAtFGA=+k9y3M=B8qP7V=MSKfF0sqkiQ@mail.gmail.com>

command: reboot
purpose: reboot, halt, poweroff - reboot or stop the system

syntax: reboot [OPTION]..

options:

-f, --force Does not invoke shutdown(8)  and  instead  performs  the  actual
      action you would expect from the name.

-p, --poweroff Instructs the halt command to instead behave as poweroff

-w, --wtmp-only Does  not  call  shutdown(8)  or  the  reboot(2) system call and
       instead only writes the shutdown record to /var/log/wtmp

--verbose Outputs slightly more verbose messages  when  rebooting,  useful
               for debugging problems with shutdown.

examples:
1.  To reboot the system
     $ reboot
     sudo permission needed for user or
     # reboot

2. To reboot system with message to users before reboot
    # shutdown -r time "message"
    -r reboot
    time to reboot
    message to all users

    # shutdown -r  +10 " system going to reboot save your work"

3. To see log of system reboot
    # last reboot

        Though I am not directly answering your question, I would
suggest using epoll(and non-blocking sockets). So, you will be
notified of data when it arrives. You don't have to block for some
timeout secs(or milliseconds). Once you have a EPOLL_IN notification,
you can use recv() and read all available data. Thanks

These above are often used in same area of system administration on Linux boxes. 

In
 general, the man pages for 1D1Cs will give you a list of related commands 
to see, typically found toward the last paragraphs of the man pages and 
this will make for an interesting further study.

In this era of Internet, it is important to be self conscious on what
you are doing and sharing. Waiting for government to act does not make
any sense as you can see recent SC ruling on this.

I have been concerned about this for some time now.

We need more privacy awareness for common people.
The Free Software Movement has a crucial role to play in bring privacy
tools to the masses.

Don't look to the government to save you.
The government, as it exists, is an outmoded institution.
But being outmoded can be forgiven, and corrected.
The real problem is that the government is essentially corrupt.
All other problems will be fixed only after corruption is addressed.

If your Windows machine has been hacked, do you just sit there while rival
hacker groups ( political parties ) fight for control?
Or do you install Free Software?

The government is like that Windows machine, offering windows into our data
to the NSA, and anyone with a backdoor.
We really can not and should not trust our own government. To do so, is
anti-democratic.

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

I kind of disagree here, the government is not offering a back door
here, because the data is not residing in India. We cannot go and ask
them to build Indian version of Facebook, Google, Yahoo, et al. Or we
can be next China.

The clock is big as I have done some CSS.

It is here:

#jqclock {
        margin: 0 auto;
        padding: 0;
        position: relative;
        width: 600px;
}

.clockdate {
        text-align: center;
        margin: 0px;
        display: block;
        font: 3.8em normal Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;

}
.clocktime {
        font: 2.0em normal Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
        margin-top: 0%;
        text-align: center;
        margin: 0px;
        display: block;
}

This uses the jqclock plugin.

But it is really easy to write  a simple clock yourself using the
Date() object in javascript.

Friends,

I am looking for a free php based ecommerce application, to setup a
online portal.

The customer needs everything in the UI in Tamil.
Hope we can change the UI using the localization.

Is there any ecommerce app that has been translated in to Tamil already?
If not, planning to translate magento in Tamil.

Share your thoughts.

Thanks.

   You can have a look into jquery cycle2 plugin (

Please note that SELINUX is a very powerful subsystem and has several
associated/related commands as a family.

Kindly treat them as a group.

I must note here that many admins disable that (the equivalent of
disabling firewall) rather than keeping them as permissive or Best yet
"enforcing". I cannot attribute it to anything else other than
laziness/incompetence. Beyong India, such admins will face severe
retribution. Sometimes even loss of job.

Hence request you to publish each command in a series as that can be accessed

Rajagopal

Hi Giris,
   your judgement towards engineering is wrong.
Also UI can not be created with just jquery and html alone. These languages
used to convert creative works to usable product.
Moreover we need to understand the DOM and how css,html,js works together
gives the better UI. not simply jQuery.
If a person knows above technologies, without jquery u can create better UX.
Also i dont understand why people are talking about php,jsp,cgi for UI
creation.These server sides scripts are used to gather and give u the
response.
If people are capable to write servers and engine to handle http requests
we can call them as engineers .but every so called programmers are just
comsumers of frameworks.

I would add lack of time.  One would have to read the docs, understand
the MAC concept.  Experiment the custom setup on a non production box
before migrating it to production.

It may come easy to some but I am guessing most people get daunted by
the entire thingy.

I recall, that a default install of apache on CentOS would not work
with SELinux set to enforce. One had to set it to "permissive."
This might have been fixed in the latest incarnates.

Do you have any data to back this up?

To the best of my knowledge SELinux is installed and ON (default IIRC)
 only in Redhat and derivative distros.

On other distros (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE) it is available but
*not* installed by default.  openSUSE / Ubuntu defaults to App Armor
(IIRC).

> Hence request you to publish each command in a series as that can be accessed

SELinux is non trivial.  If you have domain knowledge (beyond n00b+)
in the area, please help Dhana Sekar.   Additionally, please blog it
with use case scenarios.

Nice.  Wish you all success in this venture.

Couple of quick comments.

1. You already have a domain courseeplus.com.  On your contact page
you have a Gmail id!  Suggest you use an email id with your company
domain name.  It would look more professional (IMO).

2. Suggest that you get the content proof read by an independent party
(typos and grammar).

Best,

I did some browsing of the animation source code for page scroll that
I sent today.

The plugin is written in javascript using some techniques in object
oriented programming.

Javascript is different from other OO languages like perl in which OO
is optional.

There is concept of class and object.

But Javascript is a language in which functions are first class
entities.It is a prototype programming language.

So you can as well use a function as a hash value. And pass a function
as a parameter to some other function.

It also supports functional programming constructs like closures and
anonymous functions.

The usual programming style in javascript is actually assigning
functions as a huge associative array or hash data structure
 as key value pairs. Function name is the key and the function
body/definition is the value.

Objects are used in perl also similarly.

In perl also objects are nothing but hash tables.

But javascript uses it in a very efficient and totally different manner.

And jQuery plugin uses certain javascript constructs that confused me a lot.

But I am slowly coming to terms with it now.

You extend the jQuery $ object and act on the object using the each() method.

Anyway the idea of functions being used as data itself is something
that was foreign to me having come from a C background.

Functions are code. Not data.

But in javascript and in jQuery plugins you find that functions are
stored as data as hash values.

Just like perl the array and hash syntax are similar.

Please install spidermonkey and type this.

$ js
js> a = [2,2,3, 40 ]

It is an array.

$ js
js> a={1: "Girish", 2: "Lug"}
({1:"Girish", 2:"Lug"})
js>
js> a[1]
"Girish"
js> a[2]
"Lug"

This is an associative array or hash.

Dear Rahman,

Please provide some more details about your web application and environment.
Is it breaking on a single browser/OS/device or on some, or on all?
Which language is the application written in?
Do you have a public URL for your application?
Could you post it to github, and let fellow LUGgies send you fixes?

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

I am sorry I missed out this.

BTW, I tend to believe that people do not have priority rather than
time, most often.

Blame it on my impression that this list is heavily populated by
developers rather than Admins like the Centos List

The last Centos install I did asked for the mode and default is
enforcing and things work pretty well out of the box.

Not much but one data point at least. I cannot reveal names, I know of
at least one incident where a fairly good linux administrator (in
India) was forced into, lo and behold!, a windows desktop support
engineer as an escape route for fiddling with SELinux and firewall
settings and the customer could not access to test the app from across
the ponds.

I have sorted out SELinux related issues in the past, but have not
documented it. Gotta pick my brains for the details.

To begin with, I would suggest one should install setroubleshoot app
and watch closely what it says and understand... kinda reverse
engineer. That approach would slightly make learning easier.

As of Centos 6, I can vouch that the out of box stuff works as
advertised with SELinux in enforcing mode.

The stuff starts when people, say, copy PHP/java app tree of  "hot
new"  in the /var/www/html and expect it to run and then complain.

Actually I was thinking sharing my experiences using the story-telling
technique (kinda from-the-trench-war-time memoirs) very soon.

That perhaps would also help partially answer the query earlier in
this list "how to troubleshoot".

I was away from core tech for last few months and was caught up in the
IS audit and the such.

I am sure after the Snowden event, many PHBs would start tossing
around the "security" related jargons like they have tossed around
"firewall" and "anti-virus" for a decade or so to gain brownie points
at least.

Hope you get the picture

Of course I must congratulate Dhanashekar for bringing the serious
subject of security and that too security in depth.

Thank you again, Dhanashekhar for bringing up this topic and Thanks
Arun for pointing out

Regards,

Rajagopal

I appreciate that you are taking some efforts to organize your code better.
However, I have to point out the technical inaccuracy here.

Although Perl 5 objects are commonly implemented as hashes, this is NOT
always the case.
Perl programmers can, and do, implement objects using arrays when
appropriate.
As a C programmer, you know that arrays are more memory efficient than hash
tables.

        reverse-i-search is not related to wc. When you are replying
to a mail/thread what you ask/tell should be related to the topic of
discussion of that thread. Replying to a thread and posing a question
not related to thread is called "thread hijacking". The list

Apart from the fact that the 2 sentences above are not related at all ...
what the heck is a prototype programming lang ? Perhaps you read something
about inheritance being prototype based in javascript and came up with this

Do someone know the equivalent command for (reverse-i-search) in tcsh shell?

In bash we use ctrl+r , whereas in tcsh this doesn't do the trick...

Thanks!

Subject: [Ilugc] Storage requirement -- mirrors for Debian 6/7,
 Ubuntu 10.04/12.04 and Centos 5/6
Message-ID: <CAHhM8gA-Skj+ifhsV6579B2O1rBf1jgD2oif=qO8BPH5yx-BZQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am planning to setup up a "local" mirror for  Debian 6/7, Ubuntu
10.04/12.04 and Centos 5/6 (all distros amd64 only).

Debian  - main contrib non-free back-ports + updates
Ubuntu - main multverse universe restricted + updates
CentOS - main extra epel

I need a ball park idea for the storage allocation.
The mirror will be running in a VM with storage provided by a separate
block device (virtual).

If you (or someone you know) has done something similar and know the
storage requirement, please share the info here.

TIA

Are you humoring us? ;)

Is it really that hard to make that out?

Just login to ftp.iitm.ac.in , go to the mirror directory root and type:

$ du -hsc *

Or to any of the public mirrors, rsync, ftp or http.

OpenBSD 5.3 i386 packages alone take up 17 Gigs.

Rest won't be more than 2 G.

Perhaps not it can be figured out by doing 'ls -l' on the directories
of interest ... but some one who has done a mirror can give the answer
from his/her local system.

Going by your suggestion  I tried

                      ftp  ftp.iitm.ac.in

gives me anonymous access to the system but the 'ftp help' client does
*not* display any  du command.

Perhaps you have a shell login in to ftp.iitm.ac.in?  Or do you use
some specific ftp client that has the capability to size a 'remote'
dir?  If so - please share that here.

Thanks but I did *not* ask for openBSD and I am *not* interested in
the openbsd mirror size.

Read the list guidelines if there is any doubt in your mind.  And
please don't give excuses for your Gmail composer, as many have given
you help on this list on how to compose properly.

Page formatted printing of a table from a browser has always been a
problem. I struggled with this early last decade. I do not know if printing
support has gotten better in HTML over time.

The way I was able to handle this:
a) ensure that the contents fit well within a page and give page breaks
b) ensure no cell is blank but has atleast one space if it has to be blank.
Prevents cell collapsing.

I'd recommend you give a print button in the screen and do a PDF generation
on the backend which supports the HTML tags properly for printing.

It does seem like HTML5 does have good support including tags like header
footer etc. IE8 still has problems with these as I read on the Internet. If
the environment is under your control, maybe HTML5 is the way to go.

But table page breaks works fine with the firefox, the problem with the
firefox is since i m using tamil unicode fonts it prints a circle with
thunaikal and all. if that circle issue is solve i will stick with firefox.
is there any way to solve that?

Hi all,

Today we had our meetup and discussed several things which includes topics
covering Internet Democracy, Tor, Tails, Software Freedom Day celebration,
Idea of creating a custom distro, etc.,

As a part of discussion we have decided to change the name of our group
from

PuduvaiLUG - Puducherry Linux Users Group

to

PuduvaiGLUG - Puducherry GNU/Linux Users Group.

Also we have changed our blog URL as http://puduvaiGLUG.wordpress.com

List of things Changed
---------------------------------
1. Group name - Puducherry Gnu/Linux Users Group
2. Blog URL - http://puduvaiglug.wordpress.com

List of things remain unChanged
-----------------------------------------------
1. Mailing list address - still you can send mail to "
puduvailug at freelists.org"
2. Facebook Page URL - http://facebook.com/puduvailug

The reason for changing the group name
------------------------------------------------------------
LUG - Linux Users Group. Where Linux is a kernel and as we are not dealing
with Kernel at it's level, rather we are discussing about GNU/Linux as a
Operating System and so the change was required. Also when we include GNU
it also means we are not just a technical group, but also Philosophical
group.
