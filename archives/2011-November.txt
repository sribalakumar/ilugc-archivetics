Subject: [Ilugc] GNU Health-1.4.1 released
Message-ID: <CADDQFRuMBjaO7TcBiAF0Wjt2mEyKxEmdxkj-ZC2FkvT7qk06qw@mail.gmail.com>

http://health.gnu.org/

GNU Health 1.4.1 released !
I'm happy to announce the release of GNU Health 1.4.1, in which we
have incorporated support for PyPI, the Python Package Index

This version is compatible with the latest tryton release (2.2.0). Now
GNU Health is also a set of python modules, fully integrated to the
Python community.

Thanks to the magic of pip, and the help of the Tryton community (
Cedric Krier, et al ), installing the latest GNU Health version is as
easy as running

pip install --user trytond_health_profile

This will install the requirements ( the tryton server and all the
standard GNU Health modules ) automatically and in your "$HOME/.local"
directory. I will be updating the installation process at the wiki
today.
The main site is the GNU Savannah where all the development and
discussion takes place.



There are many improvements, bug fixes and news features, some of them :

    CalDav compatibility (it allows complex calendar views and
settings for appointments and hospitalizations)
    Support for JSON RPC protocol
    Fully Tryton 2.2 compatible
    Enhanced Medication form
    New Medicament categories
    Medication pregnancy category
    Included the latest WHO essential medicines (17th edition)
    New translation engine (to be used with .po format)
    Improve Laboratory model and functionality


Thanks to all of you for contributing with your code, testing,
translating and documenting the project !

Intel motherboards are good. A processor does not exist in isolation.
You won't get good performance without a good motherboard. In fact
processor frequency is one factor; many things don't require much CPU
intervention.

I have no clue about i7 or any of the others. I find that even Atom is
sufficient for my needs though for desktop use it is not great because
the graphics chip on board the mini ITX does not support big
displays(more than 1024x768).

http://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.html

look for the one on top of the chart for the best. of course, it will be 
expensive. Just a week back intel slashed their prices and i7-2700k 
seems to be the value for money at high end. although, it is debatable 
whether 20k for a processor is worth it.

Very nice. A superb stepping between Arduino class and the Single board
computer (SBC) class.

For people who have not seen it yet, I am also eagerly waiting for
the Raspberry pi to be available to general public. It is $25 and has HDMI
out built in.

Use data cable. Connect it to the PC/laptop.

Unless you have utility like `powertop` running and have suspended your USB
ports, it should just mount the drive and also pop up an dialog asking what
you want to do with the mounted device.

With `usb suspended` using powertop it takes a while for the camera or any
usb device to get detected due to poll frequency. in such cases USB is not
always on.


Btw, Works for me using Ubuntu 10.04 and Sony cybershot W-570

Dear Mr. Ashok,

you need  not reply / react to people who give such remarks.

He never answers to questions, he only retorts it with a question.
Maybe a very good & useful mind, getting bored & wasted.

Maybe I am wrong.

with warm regards

Try forums like TechEnclave and Erodov. They have people who will help
you with benchmarks, information, just general advice. They're full of
tech enthusiasts so you can count on up-to-date information.

Message-ID: <CAEphupC_XtoCs8egiAFEjROod0nZDZvtYre5vhQQQdmg=xhwcQ@mail.gmail.com>

HP has rolled out ultra-low-power servers designed for large Web

termed as Project Moonshot. These tiny servers from HP make use of cell
phone-type components in a server architecture. The company claims that
they consume 89 per cent less power than conventional servers. The servers
will run only Canonical and Red Hat Linux, and not Windows.

"Red Hat Linux" was discontinued around 2004. EFYTimes might like to
get the proper distribution names. For example, I assume that the
article meant Ubuntu and not Canonical.

Diksha,

I notice that all your emails are just headlines of news from 
efytimes.com. You don't seem to take part in any discussions but just 
send out emails.

My current conclusion is, you are part of email marketing and you don't 
read any responses. Prove me wrong by sending "No" as a response to this 
email.

The nomenclature of the Linux distros, in the article, are indeed
correct (RHEL and Ubuntu).   The names got mangled in the
transcription.  It is better to quote verbatim and give proper
attribution.

It is a matter of choice and freedom.

LIC task workers, Maharashtra State Transport Corporation ticketing
PoS use Linux desktops (to name a couple of examples). I personally
know people in the above orgs. who use the Linux desktop and have no
issues with their daily tasks.

A few days ago, I saw the Samsung netbook with MeeGo as the factory
installed OS.

Personally, I choose to use Linux desktop and have been doing so since
early 2000 and will continue to do so.

Dear Sir,

I am new to the community and have just got introduced to the world of open
source. I am working at EFY, which uses open source software. I would be
candid enough to say that I am in love with this. I follow every single
discussion on LUG, but I am not technically sound enough to be a part of
them.

Besides using the open source software, I am keen on collecting information
on it and writing about it in our publications. With my emails, I wish to
share information with the community.

I understand your question well. I do not have any answers in hand as of now.

But I do know there is thing known as CPU affinity which can be used:

man top

Search for "SMP", there is a field "Last used CPU" which can be enabled.

Here is the snippet,

j: P  --  Last used CPU (SMP)

           A number representing the last used processor.  In a true SMP 
environment this will likely change frequently since the kernel 
intentionally uses weak affinity.  Also, the very act  of  running  top 
  may break this weak affinity and cause more processes to change CPUs 
more often (because of the extra demand for cpu time).

I tried using this product two months back, but could not understand the 
workflow.  The UI is exactly the same as that of OpenERP.  I think, it 
is developed on top of it.

I am very much surprised and happy, that it was released by an indian.  
Wish that this project kicks off.   I would once again study this 
software and spread this among my friends circles.

All the best and congrats!
The App's UI looks good and well designed.

Just a small suggestion:
In screen shot No 1 (Patient main screen), you might get into trouble with
the photo. Even if the lady's photo was in public domain, associating it
with the listed disease genes might get you guys into trouble :-) Why don't
you go for a icon?

This Moonshot thing is really badass:

89% power savings
94% space savings
63% cost savings
2,800 servers into a single HP Redstone Server Development Platform rack unit
Each Core consumes 1.5 w
Each server unit (card sized) consumes 5 wats

No common, I was just trying to share what 'some people' "think" about

Mani, I intended the mail to be private, but wrongly sent it to the list. I
am sorry.
Request people in the list not to derail this thread based on my comments.
Let's appreciate the work done by the team.

I hope Mani takes my input positively and does remove the pic as it might
create trouble.

But it uses ARM and not meant for general purpose computing. IMO, This 
limits the platform greatly and HP is just trying something different. 
Although, It will be good see a platform challenging the dominance of 
x86 and ending Intel's monopoly.

I don't see how it limits platform. They are servers after all and are
supposed to run in data centers. I see so many distros (if not done
already) coming up with ARM builds. Ubuntu is one. With this level of
cost savings, and savings in other aspects, all cloud players are
going to be interested. BTW what do you mean by general purpose
computing?

I missed it. I use it almost all the time to find out how many cores
the system has.

Just press the "1" numeric key and you will know the percentage usage
of each core. I am not sure it shows task/process wise breakdown.

The following link is to an article on HP website,

http://bit.ly/tpXDx1

"In contrast, Moonshot is targeted at sharing almost everything ? at 
scale points never previously conceived.  Of course, Moonshot is not for 
everyone.  In fact, we believe it will only be a fit for a relatively 
small number of applications, but these applications are the ones that 
run at hyperscale. "

It looks like, it is meant for running highly parallel applications. The 
more I read about it, the more I see it as also competing with Nvidia 
Tesla or AMD Firestream which have very high power consumption.

By general-purpose computing, I meant something like running adhoc 
applications on the CPU. Moonshot is meant only to run certain types of 
applications.

Message-ID: <CA+xw+KiESuMif51QDG4=JHQY6qwaAsPLWJiK=bUK=Uzh81h35w@mail.gmail.com>

For some reason, I went to the LFY site and noticed a Poll on the homepage:
 "Which is the most active and helpful LUG in India ?"

I thought it would be a landslide win for ILUGC but to my surprise the
Bangalore LUG is also equally placed in votes with ILUGC.  I know
ILUGC has been very active since those early days (no mean feat,
this!) but had no idea about the Bangalore LUG. Google tells me their
old site is http://linux-bangalore.org/blug/ -- which looks very much
dead -- even the linked Yahoo Groups have no posts for months,years.
Much worse, I am not able to connect to their new site http://blug.in/
 (the most recent wayback machine mirror informs us that the site is
to be re-created).

Am I missing something here? Is there a Bangalore/Bengaluru LUG that's
*active* now?

Kumaraguru

Only 11 emails last month and a mere 5 the month before it.  One of
the emails is someone's wedding invitation and another is from someone
apologizing for sending spam to the list. Not exactly active in the

Message-ID: <4EB1DC2A.3050203@gmail.com>

India is kind of somewhat a sad situation. Compared to the amount of 
educated people, I think India is fairly low on the list compared to 
what it could be. Culturally it should be fairly easy, because language 
barriers should not be there. If you are educated in India, you know 
English even if it is not your first language. So India actually should 
have an easier time being involved in some of the discussions. Don't get 
me wrong, there are developers, but just not as many as I would expect. 
And I don't know quite why.

There is a fair amount of really enthusiastic local LUGs and I get to 
hear about them. But, at the same time I don't know India, you know much 
better. My gut feeling is that a lot of the actual professional 
developers in India see software development as a job and not as a 
hobby. That's the kind of picture I've gotten, I don't know if it's 
true. If you see it [software development] as a job and not as a hobby 
the whole open source thing is not as natural anymore.

I second it..  The whole life style of an indian student is spoiled 
within 4 walls of the class room..  In reality, there is no hobby for 
much of indian students, except for cinema, cricket and drinks..   The 
common attitude we find among our people is to be jolly, which means. 
free from any responsibility..

Another reason is that students in college are not taught anything 
practical...  There is no direction, no vision, and no purpose..

I wish, LUGC could research more on this and propose solutions.

You have succinctly captured our fundamental problem: we would like some
one else to solve our problems - do the ground work, analyze and propose a
few options so we can easily pick one and implement it :-)

The much derided college education system is only a reflection of the
larger issues in our society!

Don't get me wrong, am as much in the same boat as you!

IMO, cultural difference is just too great to even compare the two 
worlds. Open source contribution in India will evolve and adapt over 
time that suits our culture, the existing western style doesn't work 
very well in India. This is NOT a sad situation, just in Linus' opinion.

The following quote from the interview are interesting, in a way, to 
indicate that attributing success of Linux to one man would be 
disrespectful to several others who have contributed in the last decade.

"There are about 70-80 people that I come to meet here. And honestly I 
know about half of them pretty well. So there are almost 40-50 people I 
have worked with so long that I know what they look like, probably I 
know where they live, but, for every release there are a thousand 
developers."

The most important problem is the poor quality of education and curriculum
set forth. Final year engineering students are studying HTML and believe me
ive seen people by hearting the tags, and scratch their heads when doing a
practical exercise in HTML. Its that bad. To add to this, the quality of
faculties, people who have just completed thieir PG's which they obviously
completed immediately after their UG is taken as a lecturer. Without any
real world knowledge what good are they to the students they teach.

If you compare the faculties with that of foreign universities, all the
faculties would have done something significant in their field of expertise
but right here, you can never expect that. A good faculty amounts to half
the knowledge what the student gains in college and if they themselves have
no real world exposure how will they be able to transfer the knowledge.

I am not sure about other parts but im from tamilnadu, and there are about
400 engineering colleges under anna university and i can tell you the above
mentioned is the case with all the colleges expect the top 30 or so.
License are being sold like cup cakes without any inspection for standards.
The Curriculum is 10 years behind, how will the quality of engineers who
pass out would be.

Some of the corrective actions could be
1.Updating the curriculum atleast once in two years (@ tech is growing this
might have to come down to twice a year)
2.Issuing licenses to colleges which meets the standards
3.Setting proper standards first for each and every discipline
4.frequent inspections to the college to check they maintain the standards
set forth
5.setting criteria for lecturers

"Necessity is the mother of invention"

I believe the initiative can come from the industry.

What if an IT major posts an ad for fresher vacancy (maybe even tomorrow)
and includes the following lines in the ad

1) Must have completed your final year project independently and must be
verifiable.
2) Must have shown interest in at least ONE tech group and must have
contributed significantly during student days.
3) Must have authored a  tech blog.

and so on and so forth

I have seen vacancy ads with the above lines come up from startups but not
from established companies.

If big companies could just include some of the above lines in their ads,
automatically the students will follow suit, which will in turn force the
"powers to be" to include these in their standard curriculum.

Interesting discussion this.

I have trained many batches in companies like CTS, Wipro et al.

Quality of students are a function of the starting pay and the brand of the
 company. I found good students in a Ford fresher batch and guess what,
 they were wearing T-shirts. Even girls.

So obviously they understand what they are doing. They say they are paid
 4L per annum.

People in general work well and learn well if they are paid well and
groomed well.

I really don't think Indian engineering talent is in any way inferior
to Western talent.

The difference lies in focus and passion for continuing on and on and on.

You won't get skills in 5 or 7 years. It takes more than 15 years.

hi,

being a faculty member i thought i would share my ideas on the issue
discussed. all of your arguments are true regarding the state of
educational institutions and quality of staff members. Being head of
department i am also incharge of recruiting staff members to myh department
and one sad thing that i see is that all the students who are very bright
and could be a staff member like u discuss do not want to get into
teaching. They prefer industry. then how are we supposed to get good
faculty members if the brightest students are not willing to enter into the
profession.

Also any working member gets experienced only during a course of time. if
all of the faculties appointed should be experienced, then how are
graduates supposed to get jobs. what if all the industries want only
experienced persons and not freshers.

Coming to the students part i have observed most students not willing to
try anything other than what is given or prescribed by the curriculum. What
they want is good marks because the first entry point to an interview
process is marks. People who have the capability to memorize more win in
the race. a very few who try anything other goes to the industry.

I have seen a lot of faculty members who have and are trying to bring the
students into what we want or linus expects in his interview. i hope all of
u must have met atleast one faculty member like that in your college days.
Yes thats not enough ofcourse. i think suggestions by christopher could
bring some changes.

What if an IT major posts an ad for fresher vacancy (maybe even tomorrow)
and includes the following lines in the ad

1) Must have completed your final year project independently and must be
verifiable.
2) Must have shown interest in at least ONE tech group and must have
contributed significantly during student days.
3) Must have authored a  tech blog.

and so on and so forth

you have to believe that Microsoft has really submitted code to the Samba

What we have is what we get. Things are improving and it will continue 
to improve. We have just built our universities and colleges, as 
supposed to western universities which are 100 or 200 years old. Give it 
time, I am sure we will find our share of good faculties.

I am already doing this for the past 3 years, at the individual 
capacity..  and today, i have around 5 persons whom i trained supporting 
me.  and i had networked with few like minded people in my region.  As 
an individual, i could only do what is possible in my surrounding and 
environment.

Why i called in ILUGC is, to create a systematic decentralised 
framework, to bring in a change at the state level.  In my 
understanding, we dont have a direction.  We cannot expect student to 
learn all by themselves, to search for themselves a suitable open source 
project and then to join it.  Because, they lack the basic essential skills.

There are around 600 engineering college in tamilnadu alone.  I believe, 
atleast 100 of them would have good facilities.  If we could make 
atleast two or three students in each of these selected 100 college to 
participate in an open source project, we would be having atleast 200 
students from tamilnadu alone contributing to open source.
But we dont have that big initiative.

Only Linux Baskar from this group has covered most colleges in tamilnadu 
in installing open source labs, which is mindblowing.  Why not we 
utilise his network for bringing the next push?

PS:  When some one puts forth a suggestion, please dont bang on him 
asking "What have you done"..  Focus on the idea being suggested.

Adding to it, the daily tests being conducted even in engineering 
colleges.  Recently i conducted a small meeting for students in my 
relative circle.  They told, that they have no time to spend for 
learning other things, as they have daily drill tests.    Can we save

IMO, it is a similar attitude by the college managements towards students
that is driving them to have daily tests and drills! To me its
contradicting to think one can hand hold and tutor youngsters to be
independent and self-motivated!!!!

Sure, apart from just tests, there are bunch of useless activities, like
writing assignments, which are nothing but copying chunks of text from
various sources, with a bit of graphs, which students mostly copy, writing
observations notebooks and so forth. The question is are any of these
actually adding value? Giving assignment is not wrong but it must be
something that students will gain some knowledge, like giving them a
problem statement and ask them to write an algorithm or bring up their own
solutions and stuff like that, but to do this the staffs must be proficient
so as to give the problem sttatements in the first place which brings us
back to square one. So its all interconnected. Like many have said, this is
not something which can be mutated but should be evolved over a period of
time.

I am totally self taught  and converted my favorite hobby to work.

OK, then I did have my father's company to work for (small 8 member
engineering company then). But it was the single most important decision in
my life.

I am not asking people to not to go to college, but the crux of the matter
is, nobody can teach you programming or an OS. you need to do it yourself.
Computer science, and theory, yes, a good mentor or tutor makes a
difference.

Unless you get a kick when you see your program compile without errors (at
least at some point in life) or when you see the output of a well designed
algorithm, you should not have career out of it. The problem is, almost
entirely, the IT pool in our country we are talking about does not relate
to this...

I would compare this to actors like Rajnikant who cannot be imitated even by
 Simbu or by taught by any college. ( I don't think he knows how to
act or dance but he sure can deliver a hit movie)

For instance an MBA does not know what all troubles I go thro' in
business. The social
 stigma, the poverty and so on.

Likewise autodidacts are special. There is a certain impish charm in their
 struggle and the adaptability.

Since they learn all on their own their survival instincts are very high.

In life nobody gets to do what they studied. You always learn new
things later. And more than  learning what counts is learning ability.

Coming to Arun who I happen to know well for the past few years, I
would put him at a much
 higher level than the best educated people I have met. So I concur.

In India, we all want to make our parents proud. Fundamentally our
value system places a lot of emphasis on education and I do not talk
about any particular community or ethnic group.

This seems to be a cultural trend in this subcontinent.

Consequently choosing the educational stream is the most important
decision for all of us.

Well Arun, I will share you told me in private. I hope you do not mind.

Arun used to teach computer science basics(not sure if it was
programming) to a girl who is now one of the top guns in Google, USA.

Yes, some innate inborn talent and appropriate initiative taken at an
individual level
 is a must.

The point both Arun and I are trying to make here is that blaming
educational institutions is not very appropriate.

It fundamentally rests with individual and of course the atmosphere.

India lacks both. Committed motivated individuals are less and hard to find.

And even the good ones that have initiative are killed by the system.
Be it college or industry. Both are kaput in India. I have worked in
IIT Madras EEE department(not for IIT) for around a year and I have
worked in the best corporates in India(Bangalore and Chennai) and
surely some correction is necessary at all places.

As to my college days, yes I felt that the curriculum was extremely
competitive and appropriate the evaluation system was not.

This observation may partly be due to the fact that I never did well
in college. ;)

Definitely our educational system does not reward people like us...

I will leave at that.

It is like this.

Many Indians( I get reminded of Neeya Naaana programme in Vijay TV)
are doing engineering under duress. They are not really passionate.

Today America is facing problems in basic education and they wonder at
the math and language skills of Indians.

That is a very deep cultural thing. Nobody can erase it. Nobody can improve it.

We are born that way. The same way we are born with a certain nose and
have a certain height.

Though I am not happy with the availability of local talent for high
technology work this is due to various factors like brain drain, lack
of sustained interest in engineering, poor recognition for technical
people and so on.

Despite all this I think that Indian engineering and technology has a
bright future.

Even today do you have a single Indian technical innovation that can
stand up shoulder to shoulder with the world's best?

Most of us only want to do third rate services work in companies like
CTS, TCS, Wipro.

This has to change. And this will not change overnight.

Only then you can expect technology people to thrive and attract others.

How does someone get attracted to say something like and IIM MBA?

Only when various articles are published about how IIM guys make crore
salaries and have car, bungalow, power and so on.

Similarly we want success stories coming from millions made by top
technical talent in India.

This I think is a much bigger problem than out academic institutions.

Okay my comment was not globally applicable. I am talking only about
fresh batches
  I have trained.

No offense meant to CTS, but the quality of students I found in CTS
though it is the
 biggest IT brand in Chennai I think(It is an American company on
paper but it is
 Chennai based for all practical purposes) was very poor.

But I found better folks in Wipro.

And the college factor also matters. If you did well in 12th standard
you would have got into a great college and a great branch like ECE.

So that is another factor. It is not binding and universal, only a ballpark.

Well when I chose my job in campus I did not care about it. But well
it usually is that
 you get paid really well if you get into a really good company.

Pay has something to do with attracting good talent both as freshers
and later but it
 is not the only thing.

What is grooming? Having good seniors at work and getting engineers to do real
 engineering instead of plainjane testing, enhancement and low challenge jobs.

Freshers cannot expect sexy work from day one but your chances are
really high if
 you are placed in good places.

Sorry I was not being very clear. Even now I am not. Nowadays my brain
has numbed probably due to age. ;)

Anyway my point is that people become competent when their passion for
technology and learning offsets all other social pressure.

The mysterious Indian middle class in which all of us belong want
money, social acceptance and face up to peer pressure.

In this complex situation even highly motivated people cannot stay
technical beyond the
 fifth year of working.

There is simply no future for them if they stick to technology.

And until one gets around 15 years of experience one cannot do great work.

Nice observation. ;)

I have no idea about golf. I was talking about middle class and you
are talking about a
 sport that is the clearest indication of extreme affluence. ;)

I dunno if Gilli which is a beautiful Indian game for the poor takes
that long. ;)

Just joking.

Scilab is better than Matlab, so they are providing support for less
capable users to see it.

The author's name is Salman Khan. He is the real life hero in my
opinion. His videos on Mathematics, Finance and Astronomy are amazing and
very detailed.

You are right. I fell in love with programming while studying 10th standard
(It was always fascinating to see something I created, work). So I joined
B.Tech IT and passed out this year. For past few years, I was creating open
source java applications and browser addons and participating in other's
projects in the evenings whenever I'm free and my projects were well
received (and also helped me get selected in interview. "Shortest
interview" my HR said). I wanted to influence all others in my class and
make them understand that we can learn ourselves and create whatever we
like. But others were not interested. They were just interested in the next
Vijay mass movie, Cricket, bunking class, going rounds etc like you said.
Even Mark scorers were convinced that it's enough to learn when the company
trains them and for now only marks are important and no need to "waste
time" like this.

In the end I could only change 5 friends who got the passion and made their
own projects individually and/or collaboratively and even taught me back
things I didn't know. All the others who memorized lab programs, who made
silly ugly errors like putting semicolon after if() statement in c and not
knowing it, who couldn't even "run" the project sold to them by project
centers(high profit business!) are now still searching for job. I did what
I could at first but then later I was more focused on improving myself
further as I thought it's useless to try to change people who don't wanna
change.

In my opinion, I guess the solution if there will be any should follow
bottom up approach. First enlightening students and making them passionate
in a field of their wish. It'll make talented faculties out of them if they
prefer that profession.

No..  The current trend is very recent one, triggered first by craze for 
Government Jobs, and then later by IT sector.   People went to college, 
to get a degree, because, only if they get a degree, they will get 
government job.  And if they get govt job, they will get good bride 
(Good looking, good dowry, etc etc)..   The rot is somewhere else..

Prior to these government jobs craze, education was purposeful..  please 
read *www.dharampal.net *on the indigenous education system.   We had 
more than 1 lakh schools in Madras Province alone during 18th century, 
while at the same time, Britain had just 15000 schools..  The British 
took lot of things from Indian education system, implemented it there, 
and then destroyed the original setup in india.

For eg, from 1800 to 1850, Sanskrit course was the Top Most sought one, in most universities across Europe.  That's how the europeans learned the art of structured language, which was later incorporated in programming languages.  The Backus Naur form is essentially the Sanskrit Grammar.

On the other hand, we had been de-sanskritised, and de-educated using the macaulyte system.
(Please dont link sanskrit with religion..  i am writing on generic angle)..

This loss of native education system, pushed us few centuries back, whereas the west stole our concepts and advanced further.   ( Can any one understand the link b/w Trigonometry, and Tiri Gona Mathy..  Thiri-Gonam = 3 angles )


Indian society places lot of emphasis on education..  but it was once 
upon a time..  NOT present..  today, indian society uses education as a 
tool to attain status, luxury.. and in that, we lost the purpose..

> It is like this.

> Many Indians( I get reminded of Neeya Naaana programme in Vijay TV)

NOT just engineering.. Every college degree is without purpose..  Has 
any of the educational institutions solved any problems in our society?  
(Including IIT??)

My district namakkal is a transport hub, now facing so many problems..  
there are around 30 engineering colleges in this... but NONE of the 
mechanical students know anything about engines or other automobile 
parts..   But, an ordinary worker in the workshop, will find the fault 
in the engine, just by observing its sound..

> That is a very deep cultural thing. Nobody can erase it. Nobody can improve it.
>

This is pessimistic..  As explained above, this is not cultural thing..  
we can change.. but for that, we need to understand ourselves, our 
history and our native education system..  (again refer  
www.dharampal.net )

Senthil

Hi,

In continuation to Senthil's mail, I would like all the members of ILUGC to
go through the Macaulay's speech in British Parliament in 1835. Sorry for

I had read this article by KE long back.. but i would like to quote 
another phrase of Macaulay, which is authentic..

-----quote---
?I have never found one amongst them [the orientalists] who could deny 
that a single shelf of a
good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and 
Arabia. It is, I believe,
no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has 
been collected from all the
books written in the Sanskrit language is less valuable than what may be 
found in the most paltry
abridgment used at preparatory schools in England.?
--Minute of Lord Macaulay on the 2nd of February 1835

--end of quote ---

The above clearly shows the extreme contempt of macaulay over oriental 
education.. The reason is that, the nature of indian education was 
different from european variety..

In india, focus of schools was primarily for literacy and iculcating 
good character.. The technical, and professional education was contained 
within the Jaathi Setup. ie, there is no equivalent of engineering 
colleges, but since each community collectively did a profession, they 
innovated, and invented, technologies, as per their requirement. More 
importantly, these technologies are NOT documented.. It was a living 
knowledge, which continued to successive generation..

For eg, in the same dharampal website www.dharampal.net , there is a 
description of how plastic surgery was practiced by a particular 
community for thousands of years.. a team of doctors from england, tried 
to know how it was done, but they were able to crack only 60 years 
later.. and this was the starting point of plastic surgery field..

Like the same website describes about how small pox was contained with 
simple techniques, how high quality steel was produced cheaply, and so 
many arts and technologies being professed in india..

And all of these was destroyed by this education system.. otherwise, 
where were the people, who built magnifient temples, where were the 
people who professed plastic surgery in india?

Coming back to sanskrit, Please read this article by Rajeev Malhotra, on 
how europe misappropriated sanskrit..

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rajiv-malhotra/how-europeans-misappropri_b_837376.html

------ Quote---
 >>"Sanskrit and Indology entered most major European universities 
between 1800 and 1850, challenging if not replacing Latin and Greek 
texts as a source for "new" ideas. Many new disciplines were shaped by 
the ensuing intellectual activity, including linguistics, comparative 
religion, modern philosophy and sociology. "
---end of quote---

I dont know how far these debates on non-technical things like history 
is going to shape our mind.. but in my view, technical cannot be dealt 
isolated.. Science and Technology is always part of a civilization.. and 
Claude Alvares, from Goa, had beautifully explained this in his book 
"Decolonising History".. it can be downloaded from the below link..

http://www.indianscience.org/essays/29-%20E--F-Decolonising%20History.pdf

So, i hope, we should be by now, having a perspective of our patetic 
state of today's education, and the root cause.

If we want to try any solution, we need to analyse those root causes.

Senthil

Dear all,

Myself and Mr. Jai Sathish Kumar Ashok conducted a two days (December
3rd and 4th) FDP on FOSS for System admins / lab assistants in United
Institute of Technology (www.uit.ac.in).  Nearly 25 participants from
various colleges attended the training programme.

For the next 3 months, I have planned to conduct a one day free FDP
(mainly focussing System Administrators / Lab Assistants) for all
engineering colleges in the coimbatore and surrounding regions in
setting up FOSS labs (The great news is that, at present many colleges
have started introducing FOSS OS/applications in the first year
itself) .

During the training programme, I am also providing all the FOSS
distributions/repositories to the institutions without any charges.

While this may be generally true, IMO it is the mind set of these
youngsters that is more important.   Regardless of how bright and
sharp they are, most seek jobs in the "big" names and end up doing
mundane stuf v/s working @ small companies and really learning a lot
of stuff in a short period of time.

The primary reason cited a by a few I have discussed this factor - so
that their parents can brag my son/daughter works @ so and so place,
this in turn feeds secondary factors like marriage prospects etc.

Totally agree - what I see missing is the application of mind.    What
I also see missing is the doggedness to dive deep in a subject matter
and achieve some level of expertise.  They know the stuff but don't
know how to put 2 and 2 and perhaps get 5 out of it :)

> The difference lies in focus and passion for continuing on and on and on.

The crux - is the mind set and lack of passion to excel in your chosen
field.  I have come across youngsters chasing certifications right
after graduation.   They think a RHCE and/or CCNA will get them some
extra bucks but at the same time are not willing to invest time in
gaining practical experience - self study [1], internship or working
at start ups.

> You won't get skills in 5 or 7 years. It takes more than 15 years.

I differ.  A person with passion and the right mind set can achieve
enough expertise in a subject matter within 2-5 years.

[1] Example - basic networking can be practiced using Virtual Box VMs
but I have not come across any student who has taken the initiative to
do so.

I am going to send a separate mail for employees. Now what is the
quality of the students  I will attract?

Can I get good talent? No.

I don't think it is an easy answer. I can't claim I learnt nothing by
joining Novell first.

I learnt a lot not just tech stuff. I had a real feel of how working
for big superb companies could be. Definitely it was enjoyable,
meaningful and nice.

However I learnt the most by working for small companies in Chennai
and even Bangalore.

The lure of the lucre and social status cannot easily be erased from
the minds of people.

There is nothing fundamentally wrong with this thinking. We do not
like certain realities particularly if we are not benefiting by it. ;)

Fundamentally we are gifted people. Our nation and culture has placed
emphasis on the right values on education for more than thousand
years.

Now technology is not just knowledge. It is application and
engineering is not just memory or IQ.

It is a lot of skills gotten by experience and attitude.

Our attitudes need change. Not the basic skill and gene makeup.

You left out a 1 before this number. 12 to 15 years. ;)

As I said engineering is not just knowledge. It is a lot more than that.

No use arguing with reality. If technical genius takes more than 10
years accept it.

You may not have the patience to pursue it. But that does not alter
the truth in
 any way.

Since the partition has been written to, by the installer. The chances
of getting your data back are lesser. Still you may want to try
testdisk. You can find tutorial on how to use testdisk here

In the essay Peter Norvig quotes studies showing that it takes "about
ten years to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of areas" and
speculates that deliberate practice of over 10000 hours (which works
out to ~2.75 hours per day over a 10 year period) is what is required.

hello folks ,
?
?
?Kickstarter? , it's a site that allows people to invest in various projects, giving people real money to develop an idea. Those ideas vary from film-making to programming video games, but the concept is the same regardless of the project
?
http://www.kickstarter.com/
Kickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every week, tens of thousands of amazing people pledge millions of dollars to projects from the worlds of music, film, art, technology, design, food, publishing and other creative fields.
?
A new form of commerce and patronage. This is not about investment or lending. Project creators keep 100% ownership and control over their work. Instead, they offer products and experiences that are unique to each project. 
All or nothing funding. On Kickstarter, a project must reach its funding goal before time runs out or no money changes hands. Why? It protects everyone involved. Creators aren?t expected to develop their project without necessary funds, and it allows anyone to test concepts without risk.

It looks like a MS Windows product.  The OP has lost his MS Windows
partition.  Where will it be installed?  Is it a bootable CD image
that can recover partition table and related "lost" files?

Also, please ensure you are not violating any license agreements that
you may have accepted when you purchased/installed the software.

Hi All,

Im using centos with sendmail in it. It is a LAMP development server.
I need to restrict all outgoing emails and need to allow only to my domain

Please let me know how to do this.

I have tried following entries in /etc/mail/access, but it doesn't work as
I expect
To:xyz.com REJECT
server rejects email to my domain xyz.com whereas if I give
To:* REJECT
it doesn't work.

Thanks in advance.

Just give "to: xyz.com RELAY". All other domains will get rejected and
xyz.com alone will get relayed.

Six Good Reasons to Try Fedora 16
Just declared 'gold,' the latest release of this business-focused Linux
distribution will make its official debut on Tuesday.
By Katherine Noyes
Nov 4, 2011 10:19 AM

There are many different Linux distributions, each offering a slightly
different flavor of the free and open source operating system.

fedora linux
Most readers of these pages are probably at least aware by now of
Canonical's Ubuntu Linux, which tends to dominate the headlines by far, but
another very popular and excellent choice is Fedora, the free, community
version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Fedora currently ranks at No. 3 in DistroWatch's popularity listings, and
late Thursday the project behind it announced that the next big
version--Fedora 16, or ?Verne?--has been officially declared ?gold? and
ready for release on Tuesday.

If you've been considering sampling a taste of Linux's many benefits for
your business, this new release could be a great one to try because of its
particular strength on enterprise features. Here are six good reasons to
test it.

It's on the homepage of  http://www.linuxforu.com/
Look for it in the right column, half way to the bottom of the page.

I am guessing it was started years back and hasn't closed yet.

Perhaps Diksha Gupta can help. She's from EFY but LFY is part of their Group.

I hate to hijack the thread, but this is a question I couldn't resist to 
ask. So, we (ilugc) are not in good terms with stallman ? Also, What is 
his philosophy behind GLUGC ?

Stallman has a policy that he will not address a LUG unless it renames
itself as a GLUG. In those days Mumbay agreed - so he spoke to them.
Chennai refused, so he did not speak. That does not imply any fight with
him. He had, and still has a lot of devotees in ILUGC.

I tried the above and it doesn't work. This is my content of
/etc/mail/access

Connect:localhost.localdomain           RELAY
Connect:localhost                       RELAY
Connect:127.0.0.1                       RELAY
To:xyz.com                       RELAY

Also, please note that both the LAMP application and sendmail is running on
the same box.

Anyone please guide me..

Thanks in advance.

He is an idealistic person, who never compromise on things. He can't accept
using "Linux" for "GNU/Linux". The same applies for LUGs as well. He wants
them to be called "GNU Linux User Groups".

Hi luggies,
I visited Tamil Nadu Agricultural University-(TNAU) yesterday world class
university ,suprised to see 30% of computer's woking in LINUX OS.Now FOSS
is in Agricultural University too.Nice work by College Professors.But the
sad situation is Engineering college HOD's find difficult to switch to
FOSS.RTI's should be given to these Engineering colleges.

TNAU-  are in need of community support now.

Wherever there is possibilities like the syllabus not pressing on a
particular software to be used, i have seen lot of HOD's use alternative
softwares. FOSS is a best solution to us in financial terms also. only now
the software requirements from universities have stopped pressing on a
particular software, that too only for certain labs.

I am trying to restrict the size of the git push using a pre-recieve

the size of the transaction file. I am not sure how to do this with

You can set up a pre-receive hook in git, on the remote (server-side hook).
Assuming that your remote is 'origin', you can do
$ git remote show origin
to get the url of the remote.

Then move to the path in the remote. There will be a 'hooks' directory with
sample hook scripts. You can either rename the pre-receive.sample file or
create your own. Don't forget to chmod +x the file.

Like many other things in Gnome, the information is stored in gconf. Use
`gconf-editor` and look under `/apps/gnome-power-manager/thresholds`.
You might also consider looking at the `use_time_for_policy` key in
`/apps/gnome-power-manager/thresholds` if you decide to use percentage
instead of time to judge when to do things.

Ubuntu 11.10 (which the OP is using) is using Gnome 3 -- gnome apps
have migrated from gconf to Gsettings (with dconf backend). The dconf
backend is binary, so you won't be able to directly change it from a
text editor.  If you have dconf-editor installed, navigate to

 org -> gnome -> settings-daemon -> plugins -> power

in the left pane and you can edit the power configuration in the right
pane. Alternatively, you can also use gsettings from the command line.

gsettings   list-recursively   org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power

will list all the keys and their values under this schema. If you want
to change a value of a key, say percentage-critical :

gsettings   set   org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power
percentage-critical  10

You will find description of the keys here:
http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-settings-daemon/tree/data/org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power.gschema.xml.in.in

Note: You should also set use-time-for-policy key to false if you use
percentage.

Fedora 16 (Verne) Released

About this blog
Coretech

Jamie's Mostly Linux Stuff

Various thoughts and adventures, including but not limited to Linux,
assorted bits of hardware new and old, and occasionally Windows XP/Vista/7.
Fedora 16, codenamed "Verne", is due to be released today. Fedora has
decome the "poster child" for the Gnome 3 desktop, since being the first of
the major distributions to use it (in their Fedora 15 release). So there
are a lot of high hopes associated with this release, people are really
anxious to see if the Fedora/Gnome 3 desktop is improving as it matures. At
first glance, it doesn't disappoint.

A stupid versioning system which started with Google Chrome. Looks like 
Mozilla just copied it. I liked the old days when it took like a year or 
two to jump major versions.

5.0 - June 21, 2011
6.0 - August 16, 2011
7.0 - September 27, 2011
8.0 - 8 November 2011

Just ridiculous release dates. Now that people are complaining about 
frequent updates, in 10.0 they are possibly adding silent updates 
feature like Google chrome.

Postgresql did jump from 7.4 to 8.0, but that was a major change, and
since then they have stuck to the convention of major and minor release
numbers.

That is probably the right way to do it, or something like the recent 
kernel version change from 2.6 to 3.0, just because 2.x has been a 
couple of decades old, also seems okay.

How would you visualize an alien? My friend Bal shares his views on
what he thinks an alien should look like

http://www.universalsubtitles.org/en/videos/Vh5i1DLBM9DI/en/189676/

You can share with us how you think an alien should be like and
participate in Chamba Swathanthra Cinema Project
(http://chambaproject.in)

Record a video of you talking about it, write about it the way you
like it or even better draw it or animate it.

Want to see some of the ideas already there? Check this

We are making this movie combining ideas from everyone who is
interested. Why should we let only a few people enjoy making movies
when all of us can?

Come, lets play and enjoy!

Share your ideas here http://www.chambaproject.in/wiki/index.php/Ideas
or use #chambaideas hashtag on diaspora or your favorite social
network

Script for the movie is

Yes, 8 :D Firefox has too fallen into this trap of numbering minors as majors.
There was a bigger jump between 3.5 and 3.6 than between 5 and 7. :(

Rant apart, Firefox is still awesome. I urge you all to try it. In fact, in
several Javascript benchmarks, the newer foxes have been really really fast

And by the way, (for those who like living on the edge) Firefox Nightly
(currently at 10alpha) is kinda stable too. Do try it :). Also, pentadactyl
works with it.

Hi all -
We are excited to announce that tomorrow, Wednesday, November is the 7th
birthday of Firefox! To celebrate, we are bringing back Firefox Live, the
24 hour live stream of baby red pandas (aka fireboxes) at the Knoxville Zoo
in Kentucky.

We are going to do press outreach in the US and our European markets
(Germany, France, Italy, Poland, UK and Spain) when the announcement is
live.


If you have press contacts, feel free to send them the pitch when the news
is live  - otherwise this is just an FYI.

Thanks!

Celebrating 7 years of Firefox with the newest (and cutest) Mozillians!

Today, we are excited to join together as a global community to celebrate
the 7th birthday of Firefox. As the only independent browser  with a
mission to make the Web better, we are proud of how the last seven years of
Firefox have pushed the Web forward:

   - The latest release of
Firefox<http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2011/11/08/mozilla-firefox-adds-twitter-search-and-new-features-that-make-web-browsing-easier/>
is
   more than 32 times faster than Firefox 1.0.
   - We recently shifted to a new release
cycle<http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2011/08/25/rapid-release-process/>
to
   deliver features, performance enhancements, security updates and stability
   improvements to users faster.
   - Leading edge HTML5 support in Firefox ensures that developers can
   create beautiful and exciting Web experiences for users.
   - Favorite features like tabbed browsing, built-in phishing and malware
   protection, the Awesome Bar, Do Not Track and our gallery of thousands of
    Firefox add-ons give millions of users around the world more choice and
   control over their Web browsing experience.

To celebrate, Mozilla has once
again<http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2011/04/12/firefox-live-trekking-with-pandas-and-new-adventures-for-spark-and-ember/>
adopted
firefox (a.k.a red panda) cubs at the Knoxville Zoo. For the next few
months, you can watch these baby firefoxes play, live and grow via a 24
hour live video stream at Firefox Live <http://www.mozilla.org/firefoxlive>.
Please help spread the word by sharing the cuteness of our newest
Mozillians at Firefox Live <http://www.mozilla.org/firefoxlive>.

*Pitch: *

Happy Birthday, Firefox!

Firefox, the only independent browser, has come a long way since Mozilla
released Firefox 1.0 seven years ago.  Earlier this week, we proudly
released Firefox 8, the latest update to the Firefox browser.
 Firefox continues to drive and advance the Web with the key Mozilla values
of openness, transparency and interoperability.

In honor of Firefox's seventh birthday today, Mozilla has announced
the adoption of three new red pandas from Knoxville Zoo.  Mozilla would
like to welcome Burnadette, Dolly and Winston to the Firefox family!
Mozilla is officially re-open its Firefox Live project for
constant cub-watching starting today. This time, however, Firefox Live
will include ways for users to engage with the cubs and share all the
things they love about Burnadette, Dolly and Winston with their friends.

I invite you to take a moment and visit our cubs!

Thanks,

How many have tried surf, the single C file browser?

http://surf.suckless.org/

It is only 878 lines or so. Use it with tabbed by the same author and
it is cool.

But on a fast machine you won't know any difference with firefox.

Over the years firefox has become very fast and reliable though it does crash.

What is the format of the contents you want to stream? Bit rate?
Simultaneous connections?

Two open source media servers:
* Red5 (Java based) : I have tested this and dropped this because it was
too big for my use case
* crtmp server (C based) : Brilliant standalone, native server. I use this
for one of my clients.

A movie show would be wonderful. Revolution OS is a very good movie. But I
feel it would be of little or no use if only we watch it. We need people
attending for the first time. Most of us would already have watched the
movie many times over. :)

The movie is quite technical, it will most likely put half the crowd to 
sleep. Even though it has a lot of information, the presentation is not 
the best.

Are there any other movies related to GNU/Linux/FLOSS/Mozilla etc.. ?

Your webhost will be able to give you the details regarding the ftp 
server and your credentials for the same, if ftp is available.

Firefox is moving towards a model where end users don't have to care
about version numbers much and get rapid improvements.  They also have a
long term maintained version for enterprises etc.  I think it is
absolutely the best strategy to compete in a fast moving web.

Perhaps, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. Or better still 12.04 (When it is released).

       I guess he is asking about hardware configuration. And that
mostly depends on what you will be using the computer for. I still use
a desktop that is P4 with 1 GB RAM running Debian. Suits me for most
of my purposes. But I guess a lot of people now go for more than 3GB
of RAM and intel i5 kind of processors. But to do that, you most
probably have to change your mother board as well.

      As for the GNU/Linux compatibility, I guess Ubuntu 11.04 works
on most the most recent hardware. If you are looking at stability and
your hardware is not bleeding edge(i.e. say about more than 6-8 months
since it was introduced), I would recommend Debian Squeeze, or may be
Fedora/CentOS(Ihaven't used these two, so don't know about their
hardware support). Thanks

I had been using for Ubuntu for a while, I had faced quite few problems in
the recent releases. I just moved to Mint few months back and I am happy
with it for the last 6 months. IMHO, Mint is quite stable than Ubuntu,
However ubuntu has the latest packages than mint.(I still use Ubuntu too)

    Try gentoo.More stable, no need to depends on rpm/deb.Only source
packages will be installed.You can configure it like desktop,server and so
on.

Nice. Also, It will be good to have a brief demo on how one could add 
the tamil subtitles themselves. So that similar work can be done for 
other movies independently.

I saw recommendations for Gentoo and Debian. Leave Ubuntu.

Gentoo will not run on old gear. Debian happily will.

I recently bought desktop hardware for running fedora and everything 
looks good so far. The following is the configuration,

1. Asus M5A78L-M LE motherboard (Rs. 2850/-)

http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AMD_AM3Plus/M5A78LM_LE/#specifications

1.1 Realtek 8111E NIC

The default NIC driver for linux r8168 works only at 10Mbps/half duplex 
so you will have to download the driver from realtek which unlocks the 
full potential. The following is the link to driver download page,

http://bit.ly/t284yb

2. AMD Phenom II Quad X4 - 840 (Rs. 5250/-)

Works great, Cool'n'Quiet also works, so automatically throttles CPU b/w 
0.8 to 3.2 Ghz.

3. Kingston RAM 2 GB (Rs. 750/-)
4. PC case Qori Q3335 (Rs. 1750/-)

http://bit.ly/stjDAG

You can probably get the same cabinet at a lower price.

5. Hard disk

With the flood in Thailand, hard disks are expensive right now. So, I am 
just running the machine out of a 8 GB flash drive. Although, you should 
know, flash drive have very low performance.

If you are looking for hardware which has been reviewed, you should 
check out http://www.phoronix.com/ but cannot guarantee whether you will 
find the hardware in Chennai/India.

I prefer AMD chipsets over Intel since they are usually backward compatible.

Also, Next time start a new thread instead of replying to a thread and 
changing the subject. It just messes up the threading.

Centos (Which has 7 years support cycle from redhat if you choose to
buy support) perhaps?

Mind you it is designed to work on "older" but very reliable hardware
that usually server class machines have. Servers need to be reliable,
up and running 24x7 usually. I have been using Centos on (different)
desktops since 2007. Rock Solid, I should say.

oops! I got a little carried away. Go with Intel motherboards (and an
intel processor) with Linux support.

Have a look at:

He does mention pIII which is what confused me. Usually I don't get misled.

Anyway why talk about PIII if you are talking in 2011. We live in a
very changed
world no? ;)

Anyway if you want to buy fresh hardware just buy whatever your budget
allows you and I bet you can run Debian on it.

It is a non issue.

However if you wish to run Linux on your PIII that is not a problem if
you can run Debian.

Remember, always.

People's recommendations are based on preferences and knowledge.

I may write something in C because I like C. Someone may use something else.

Similarly there are no clear answers.

a client of mine had to get a new system, and the hardware guy, knowing
that I would put linux on it, asked for specs. I said that as long as it
has a cpu, motherboard, petty, harddisk and RAM and the client was happy
with the price anything was ok with me. I have been following this
policy for many years now and the only problems I have faced have been:

1. an atom board did not support puppy 2.5 - but was ok with earlier
versions
2. some pen drives cannot boot - but otherwise work.

it is only with laptops that one has to worry a bit about some of the
peripherals - I am yet to face any problems there. Projectors, cameras
and mobile devices are still problematic.

I recently bought desktop hardware for running fedora and everything 
looks good so far. The following is the configuration,

1. Asus M5A78L-M LE motherboard (Rs. 2850/-)

http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AMD_AM3Plus/M5A78LM_LE/#specifications

1.1 Realtek 8111E NIC

The default NIC driver for linux r8168 works only at 10Mbps/half duplex 
so you will have to download the driver from realtek which unlocks the 
full potential. The following is the link to driver download page,

http://bit.ly/t284yb

2. AMD Phenom II Quad X4 - 840 (Rs. 5250/-)

Works great, Cool'n'Quiet also works, so automatically throttles CPU b/w 
0.8 to 3.2 Ghz.

3. Kingston RAM 2 GB (Rs. 750/-)
4. PC case Qori Q3335 (Rs. 1750/-)

http://bit.ly/stjDAG

You can probably get the same cabinet at a lower price.

5. Hard disk

With the flood in Thailand, hard disks are expensive right now. So, I am 
just running the machine out of a 8 GB flash drive. Although, you should 
know, flash drive have very low performance.

If you are looking for hardware which has been reviewed, you should 
check out http://www.phoronix.com/ but cannot guarantee whether you will 
find the hardware in Chennai/India.

I prefer AMD chipsets over Intel since they are usually backward 
compatible.

I originally sent the email first time around @ 11.08 AM but didn't see 
them appear in the archives till 12.00 PM so thought something went 
wrong and sent it again. Besides, I am not getting the emails I send to 
the list, will start a thread for that soon.

After sending an email to the list, usually you get a copy of the email 
back. But unfortunately, I don't get any for ilugc. I checked the 
options on the website here,

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/options/ilugc

For the question, "Receive your own posts to the list?", I have set it 
to "Yes" but nevertheless, I don't seem to be receiving it or just don't 
know where its going.

Are there any known problems with gmail + imap + thunderbird ?

that must be some setting in your mail client. I have a gmail account
for some lists, and evolution (or gmail) does not get my mails to the
lists.

There is a huge demand for Linux developers but the supply does not
match the demand. The Linux Foundation cites crunch of Linux developers
as one of the top challenges faced by the companies. As per the stats of
IT employment site Dice.com, demand for Linux developers is growing at a
rate of 31 per cent. For those wanting to cash in on the opportunity,
there are numerous options available online to learn Linux and fill this
gap in the industry.

After searching around a bit, I found this,

http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6588

"When you send a message to any mailing list you subscribe to, Gmail 
automatically skips your inbox and archives the message to save you time 
and prevent clutter. The message will appear in your inbox if someone 
responds to it or if there is an error delivering the message. If you'd 
like to view your message, you can find it in Sent Mail or All Mail."

How convenient, I no longer know whether a message is delivered in time 
to the mailing list. I guess, I just have to enable ack in the mailing 
list options and live with it, until I switch to a different MTA.

I don't think we have the hardware to play 1080p, lol. I think we got an

I've attended a couple of his sessions and they were awesome. In both of

Ahem, 31% per year. Do you know what that means?

I think this is plain fantasy. Not real.

At least in the Indian market there is no corresponding demand for Linux geeks.

On what basis do u make this claim ?

Only a proper survey can tell whether the job opportunities on Linux 
have been growing year over year or not.

This is true for atleast one of my clients.
HPCL, a fortune 500 company.

I was so shocked that our project which is getting transferred to their
servers is the first Linux based web application they are going to host.
This was also possible only because of a very big fan of Linux sitting in
a managerial post in their Hyderabad data center.  I had a very interesting
conversation with him. He claims the company is not averse to embracing
Linux, but still has not done because they feel that there is not much of
employable talent in the market for system administration. Again, they have
their own issues being a PSU. The company got seriously impressed with open
source when they moved to an open source mail server a few years back.

Arun

that define the ftp username and password.But the same result occurs.

Greetings again;
 Am running Linux with LXDE on a PIII(10 yrs old). Recently it has
started crashing frequently with the vedio output freezing up. Seems
to be a hardware problem which I am unable to fix, although I am happy
with it. So I need to upgrade.
Not keen on spending too much about 20,000 or so and should be
relatively future proof. 0 at 0throot.com reply seems closest to the
requirement, though no GPU is suggested and RAM probably can be
increased. Any other inputs are most welcome; am posted to Coimbatore
and a hardware vendors name would be appreciated too.
 Regards
    Podi

http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AMD_AM3Plus/M5A78LM_LE/#specifications

1. It has an integrated GPU, it is mentioned in the specifications.

Integrated ATI Radeon? HD 3000 GPU
Multi-VGA output support : DVI/RGB ports

Also, it has both DVI-D and D-sub VGA output so u can use both Analog 
and Digital monitors.

Integrated GPU should be just fine for Linux unless you do gaming or GPGPU.

2. This motherboard supports Dual-channel memory, so 2x2GB will be 
faster than 1x4G. So, you might want to read about dual-channel memory 
before buying RAM.

Please follow the mailing list guidelines
(http://www.ilugc.in/content/mailinglist-guidelines) and do not top
post. Interleaved, trimmed posting style is the recommended one.

No.

I don't think a survey can reveal anything.

We can smell it in the air you know.

Linux is still a very much niche area and I have seen that this has
not changed much since late '98.

And the other thing I realized is that the job opportunities in
Chennai are far fewer and far between compared to Bangalore.

This also has not changed.

So if someone says that Linux professionals are in demand and
increasing at 30% a year I can't but wonder at that remark.

Even for sys admins where Linux knowledge is mostly desired it is
still only a fraction.

If a company maintains its UNIX servers elsewhere or if it is relying
on commercial vendors then sys admins who are good at UNIX once again
are not in much demand.

And the projects that Indian IT companies do only rarely involve UNIX.

Wipro has a reputation amongst all Indian companies for UNIX and good
work. I think that that is largely true.

It also has a very healthy employee firing policy in which
underperformers are very clearly given the pink slip.

Well this was not the case at Novell where I was one of the underperformers. ;)

Anyway now I can never accept that a market that relies on service
projects like India will value technical people and look for Linux
people.

Only companies with a strong product focus and doing hardcore
development work like embedded systems or automation or some such
thing which involves a lot of UNIX will look for good brains.

Such a thing has not happened in India in the last 60 years or so when
IT has been prevalent.

But I have not lost hope.

Huh! I am almost 49 (Come Jan I will be) and in the IT sector for
(well come January) for 28 years, worked in captive and core IT
companies, I have seen it enough to point of nausea.

But your claim of "60 years" is just too much...

o VM changes in DragonFly reduces Memory usage considerably

http://www.shiningsilence.com/dbsdlog/2011/10/29/8604.html


o More multi-core improvements

"Matthew Dillon wrote up an explanation of how performance on systems
with a lot of CPU cores has been significantly improved ? up to 300%!
(He says 200%, but I think he?s treating it as a percentage of a whole
rather than percent changed.)  Apparently finally getting rid of lock
contention is the trick."

o You can now have, in theory, up to 32 terabytes of RAM on your
64-bit DragonFly system.

Dear Sir,
                I would like to point out a few glaring mistakes in
Pavithra.S. Rangan's article on Drupal  in your
newspaper (http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/article2621473.ece )

The author writes "While over thousands of developers maintain the
software, ?tens of thousands' of community volunteers across the world
continuously add new features, called modules, to the license-free
software". But Drupal is licensed under GNU GPL >=2 and is not
"license-free". It is Free (as in Freedom) software under a copy-left
license.

>From the Drupal site: "Drupal and all contributed files hosted on
Drupal.org are licensed under the GNU General Public License, version
2 or later. That means you are free to download, reuse, modify, and
distribute any files hosted in Drupal.org's Git repositories under the
terms of either the GPL version 2 or version 3, and to run Drupal in
combination with any code with any license that is compatible with
either versions 2 or 3, such as the Affero General Public License
(AGPL) version 3."

Well LUG had both plenty of negatives like ego and plenty of positives
like knowledge and techie stuff going on when I joined back in August
2006.

I have always been critical of 4 talks in one LUG meet. That sort of
thing never happens anywhere else.

Now it has become quite its opposite I think.

Anyway physical attendance and talks foster friendship and fun and
also some nice learning.

But I think LUG is largely about using e-mail to learn and share
knowledge. These days very little of that happens here. Perhaps
someone should start sending tech tips daily.

I will see if I have time to do it.

 I used to send those and before me Bharathi did. And even the tips by
some nice soul from Kanchi LUG(sorry dont recollect his name) even
were quite brilliant.

It was hardly any effort for me to send those tips but it was a good
learning experience for me.

I could perhaps try this again.

We need more knowledge oriented tech discussions rather than
discussions about jobs and talks and quality and so on.

It is okay provided the tech topics dominate.

There are plenty of first time talkers, so give them a chance and
some encouragement!


> IMO, proactive leadership is what ilugc missing.

If nobody volunteers to give a talk, then what exactly is the leader
supposed to do?

Since the LUG provides no extra powers to its leaders and we are all
treated equally, it makes everyone a leader. With this in mind, please
put forward some ideas on how we can improve the lectures.

What I mean by proactive leadership

<quoting from http://www.palconsulting.net/leadfyi.asp#Q1 >
what is proactive leadership?.

ProActive Leadership is a function, not a position. It is a composite of
all of the skills a person applies that influence and inspire others to
think, say and do the right things to achieve the worthwhile vision,
governing operating values, mission and vital goals of the organization.

You quoted a very good piece. So who is willing to do that 'function' now?
As already mentioned ILUGC also doesn't ascribe any special power to its
coordinator 'position'. Everybody is welcome to do the 'function' of
soliciting quality lectures from their friends, propose quality lectures by
themselves etc.

Hi,

It is our collective responsibility to see these meet-up go on with quality
sessions in monthly meet.

All the engineering college final year BE - IT/CS students about to take
their final year projects,

my thoughts are as follows,

a) Invite students from all the engineering colleges for the next meet
b) Propose various topics on projects
c) Form  working groups
d) Assign mentors to these working groups
e) Inculcate Bazaar style of code development.
f) Contribute to the projects through code development,testing and
documentation

It will be nice to have the agenda for the next meet up.

regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

Message-ID: <CALDskyzADMJJJ7_Z0Ddag6Sp931GbLiK-WTdpA3Os1oXvb+_aQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am attempting this tip business again. I cannot promise anything
about regularity and stuff.

There are many problems now. I don't have a sustenance situation that
is normal and nominal.
I don't have ....

Anyway now I will send whatever tip I feel like and whenever I can.
Without repeating this more than
 once a day.

Now goes:

$ lftp ftp://ftp.kernel.org/
> mirror linux-2.6.32/

It is just an example. lftp can be used to copy an entire directory to local.

And it can talk ftp, http, https, ftps, sftp and so on.

lftp can also be scripted and you can queue downloads(background).

For instance this script does that:

$ cat lftp.txt
open ftp.foo.org
queue get file.iso
quit

You run it like this:

$ lftp -f lftp.txt

This way you can download without waiting for it to complete.

In fact DDG's search with "barcamp chennai" lands in a similar error page

Late last night, word began to spread around the tech community that
one of Diaspora?s four co-founders, Ilya Zhitomirskiy, had passed
away. With much sadness, we?ve now confirmed this terrible news with
the Diaspora team.

The news is incredibly jarring, to the point that much else I could
say escapes me. Ilya was just 21. To see any member of our community
pass is sad, but for one so young to go is absolutely crushing. The
cause of death is currently unconfirmed.

Our sincerest condolences to Ilya?s family, friends, and the entire
Diaspora team.

It is really a shocking and terrible news :( It is hard to believe he
wouldn't talking to us any more! He was always so excited whenever we
talk! Even though we had only known for a small time, it is really
hard and I hope his close one would be able to cop with this tragic
loss :(

Message-ID: <91d39d4028c52bc002bacb16121cbc3e@192.168.2.4>



The state government's Information Technology department has now
resorted to Bharat Operating System Solution (BOSS), bidding farewell to
Windows. The move has come after a request from the Union Ministry of
Communications and Information Technology. A government order was
released in this regard, which said that the IT department would use
BOSS, a free and open source computer operating system. BOSS has been
developed by the National Resource Centre for Free/Open Source Software
of India. All the computer systems in the department will run on BOSS
from today.

Google has released the source code of its latest version of Android

"JBQ" Queru, software engineer, Android open source project, Google,
"Over at our Android open source project git servers, the source code
for Android version 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) is now
available."

However, the process of uploading the code is still on. So
the developers are advised to wait till the process completes. But the
source code will be available very soon. The blog post says, "However
since this is a large push, please be aware that it will take some time
to complete. If you sync before it's done, you'll get an incomplete copy
that you won't be able to use, so please wait for us to give the
all-clear before you sync."

Message-ID: <CALDskyxLwC2_vy0QK6O6ev7Pt0bqfhuELhPrct5X+_LyB7p+nQ@mail.gmail.com>

This is not just a simple tip. This is a tip cluster so to speak.

Here we are going to see how many different ways exist to download a
file using the web(http) or ftp.

There is also a way to download from Windows share using a Samba tool
but I have no need to use it at the moment.

So let us stick with the web and ftp protocols. In fact sftp can also
be used to download but it is not very prevalent.

In the UNIX command line world where memory power is the key factor in
getting your job done, be it vi(m) key strokes or mutt keystrokes or
even one of those popular commands like grep you ought to remember the
appropriate switch.

Moreover just like every language has its own idiom, in Tamil you
always address elders by neenga and in Telugu you always use "ri" or
"di" and in Hindi you say "ji", in English you don't have any such
term.

Similarly in C programming you have to use pointers to do anything at
all which is more than basic programming.

Likewise in the UNIX world even if you are using a kid Linux like
Ubuntu or Redhat, you still have to use the command line.

I think many people shy away from the command line due to their
distrust of their own memory.

And funnily enough Tiruvalluvar has very clearly said that a person
without memory can never succeed in life.

So most of the tips I send need to be memorized. However much you
dislike mugup (as they say), you cannot get away
 from it.

And that is indeed the UNIX idiom and that is why it is most powerful
and comprehensive.

So using a browser or a GUI to do what can be done with the command
line is not style. It is frowned upon.

Now let us see how many ways exist to download something.

Let me adopt this URL for our purpose. It is a live working URL, so
you don't have to change anything while running.

Just copy paste and it will run(remove the dollar sign).

http://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.6.tar.gz

Now the "ftp.openssl.org" is a host name which will be replaced by IP
address internally. It does not mean that it
 uses FTP commands.

As you well know if you paste this URL in a browser you will obtain
the zip file using HTTP.

Now there are multiple ways in which to obtain this from the UNIX command line.

$ lynx --dump http://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.6.tar.gz >
openssl-0.9.6.tar.gz

$ curl -s http://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.6.tar.gz >
openssl-0.9.6.tar.gz

$ wget http://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.6.tar.gz

$ lftpget http://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.6.tar.gz

All these do the same thing.

$ ncftpget http://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.6.tar.gz

Now you can also use FTP URL instead.

Interestingly the same URL can be converted to FTP by(yes you know)

ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.6.tar.gz

Now you can use FTP commands underneath to fetch the file for you.

OSes like FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD use makefiles to build its ports
subsystem.

In that process one of the first steps is to fetch the zip files and
also the patches(in most cases patches
 ship with the OS) , so the fetch is done using a command line like
this and then
 this is made into a Makefile rule.

I will be talking about makefiles in a subsequent tip.

       Or install manpages and be happy for the rest of life :) It's
good to have(debian package names) manpages (manpages-dev as well if
you are writing C) in all machines. We don't really have to memorize
the whole thing fully. The command names - yes. The command line
switches and their meaning, no. Thanks

wget -c "url" is the one i use always.. If the download stops in mid way
this command will continue from where it stopped.

e.g., I accidentally closed Firefox yesterday while downloading ati driver
in my friends system (it downloaded around 95%). To continue i just found
the url, and in terminal typed "wget -c <url>" and it continued from the
point where it was left :)

thanks for the news item and the help offers/wishes. initially, the BOSS
team members are working with the Dept of IT, and then spread out to other
depts -- Agri, Forest, etc., Of course, one needs patience, and catch
in-house Open Source enthusiasts from each dept.

NRCFOSS/CDAC/BOSS is planning a mini workshop with about 20-30 participants
from engg colleges (staff/students) and ILUG membes -- to discuss about
BOSS community portal, maintenance, participation by members for FOSS/BOSS
support, etc.,

Since exams are on, am checking up with them to fix a convenient date
(preferably sometime next week).

will update you as to the progress.

Subject: [Ilugc] Google Releases Honeycomb Code!
Message-ID: <4EC232A2.3060100@gmail.com>

While everyone is talking about Android 4.0 code, what is worth 
mentioning is that Google has also released source code of Honeycomb as 
well.

Despite Google's repeated clarification that holding back Honeycomb code 
was not intended to make it close source but to stop OEMs from starting 
to put it on their devices. Honeycomb was a work-around to put Android 
on the tablets while Google works on Android 4.0.

But now Google has released the source code for honeycomb as well.

Queru writes in his post, "This release includes the full history of the 
Android source code tree, which naturally includes all the source code 
for the Honeycomb releases. However, since Honeycomb was a little 
incomplete, we want everyone to focus on Ice Cream Sandwich. So, we 
haven't created any tags that correspond to the Honeycomb releases (even 
though the changes are present in the history.)

I already have sent quite a few tips one year ago I think with the tag
.a-tip-a-day.

I did not like that tag much. Someone in this group must have archived
all that somewhere.

This time around I wanted some tag. I think this is a great idea. I
will use the [TIP] tag.

Good suggestion.

Hmm. It is a matter of perspective. In MBA phraseology I would say as I said:

It depends.

Or some such crap.

But I am not a management guy. I was never part of any management
leave alone senior.

Despite my 15 years work exp I have only been a programmer. For some
reason God made me that way. Anyway I learnt the need for memorizing
from my manager in my third job in Bangalore.

At that point I used to think like you. I thought that remembering
switches were not important.

But what a star my manager was? I think the only guy who I thought was
really my metier.

But then only when I saw him applying those master strokes on the
keyboard I found how great memory was in UNIX.

And though you might now get away with being lazy with command
switches you cannot come up with an argument for vi(m) keystrokes.

Sure, you can refer the online help shipped with vim. But will that
make things easier or difficult?

> Arise Awake and stop not till the goal is reached.

Out of childish innocent humor I will bite.

Do you know what a great memory power Swami Vivekananda had?

The key to memory power is good ennobling divine thoughts and a stable
calm mind.

And also a very pure lifestyle.

For those without adequate memory, there are 100s of excuses.

Even stuff like what you read in Sherlock Holmes.

" I don't put things in my brain that will elbow out useful things."

That is rubbish. Our minds are infinitely capable if only we know how
to cultivate it.

Is there any plans to release BOSS CD free of cost (or at some nominal 
cost), to the students, just like Ubuntu does?   This is one of the way 
where we can popularise our local version of linux, and build an 
ecosystem out of it.

Guess you missed seeing it , but every BOSS support centre located in
CDAC centres of Major cities in India has a local distribution going
on . Mail / call them up for a CD .

Good one , hope it continues on a regular basis rather than a one time
workshop . I think its better a regular theme of BOSS this month goes
on regualr ILUGC meets , though its a huge expectation baby steps
could be made .

In short, the answer is, As much as possible. Of course, thats just my 
opinion.

If you look at the forums for BOSS, http://forums.bosslinux.in/ , the 
last post was on Jul 09 2011. It seems to be pretty dead right now.

As far as development goes, I personally do not like the idea of a 
consumer operating system developed by the government. For a simple 
reason that the vested interest lies is National Security which could 
curb our liberty at a later point. However, this opinion might change if 
the development is largely done by the GNU/Linux community itself.

Why NOT CDAC promote the consumer operating system separately, with 
partnership from Universities and colleges?

Why? Writing obfuscated code is an art too. Look at the previous
entries. It is beautiful. Perl Golfing has been around for ages. Is
Larry Wall angry?

Its not duh because the point of the competition is to obfuscate. KISS is a
rule of thumb to ensure good design when developing software that someone
else is going to use. This is a competition for fun.

If you don't like it then please delete the email from your inbox. To each
his own.

Have you ever heard of something called "Anvil Shooting?". It is soo not 
the way of using an anvil.

I don't think, its an insult/disrespect to the guy who invented anvil. 
Its just fun! Same is Obfuscation, fun and pointless.

Dear boys and girls,

Here we have a cool C program to download from the command line.

It is self contained and does not take care of URL handling and will
fail in some
cases but I bet it will work in nearly all of the cases.

Now the code is here:

$ cat htdl.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <netdb.h>

#define HTTP_GET_CMD "GET /%s HTTP 1.1\r\n\r\n"

int
dl(char *url)
{
	int c, ret = -1, fd = -1;
	int bytes, off;
	struct hostent *h;
	struct sockaddr_in s;
	char *p, *p2, host[1024], ip[40], outf[1024];
	char cmd[1024], buf[8192], path[1024];

	c = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
	if(c < 0) {
		perror("socket");
	}

	p = strstr(url, "//");
	p += 2;
	p2 = strchr(p, '/');
	strlcpy(host, p, p2 - p + 1);
	strlcpy(path, p2 + 1, sizeof(path));
	
	printf("Performing DNS Lookup for the host [%s]...\n", host);
	h = gethostbyname(host);
	if(h == NULL) {
		printf("Lookup failed, are you connected to Internet?\n");
		exit(128);
	}
	strlcpy(ip, inet_ntoa(*(struct in_addr *)h->h_addr_list[0]),
	   sizeof(ip));
	s.sin_port = htons(80);
	s.sin_family = PF_INET;
	s.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(ip);
	printf("Connecting to %s\n", ip);
	ret = connect(c, (struct sockaddr *)&s, sizeof(s));
	if(ret < 0) {
		perror("connect");
		printf("Could not connect...exiting\n");
		exit(128);
	}
	printf("Connected!\n");

	p = strrchr(p, '/');
	strlcpy(outf, p + 1, sizeof(outf));
	/* Now we are connected, now we can download and write to a file
 	 * , so let us open the file first
	 */
	fd = open(outf, O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC | O_CREAT, 0644);
	if(fd == -1) {
		printf("Could not open downloaded file into current dir,"
		 "check permissions\n");
		perror("open");
		exit(128);
	}
	
	/* Let us send the command to get the file and figure out how
 	 * the server responds */
	snprintf(cmd, sizeof(cmd), HTTP_GET_CMD, path);
	ret = send(c, cmd, strlen(cmd), 0);
	if(ret < 0) {
		perror("send");
		exit(128);
	}

	printf("Sent command [%s] to get the file using HTTP GET\n", cmd);

	bytes = read(c, buf, sizeof(buf));
	p = strstr(buf, "\r\n\r\n");
	off = (p + 4) - buf;
	write(fd, buf + off, bytes - off);

	while( (bytes = read(c, buf, sizeof(buf))) ) {
		write(fd, buf, bytes);
		printf("Wrote %d bytes to file\n", bytes);
	}
	close(c);
	close(fd);
	printf("Wrote %s to file\n", outf);
	return 0;	

}

int
main(int argc, char **argv)

	if(argc < 2) {
		printf("Please give the URL to download!\n");
		exit(128);
	}
	dl(argv[1]);
	return 0;
}


You can look at the code with vim colors:
ftp://tulip.pye.org/htdl.c.html

Or download this from there:
ftp://tulip.pye.org/htdl.c

Once you download it on your Linux box,compile it like this:

$ make htdl

Then it will create an exe by name htdl

$ ./htdl http://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.6.tar.gz

Or you can give any URL that uses HTTP.

It will download the binary file(or even text file) into the current
directory under
 the file name part of the URL(the last part after the final /)

Now do you want me to explain the code?

If you want it I will send a separate mail.

But you have work to do now. Play with it and see how it works.

Would be good to avoid magic numbers. #define the values.

The dl() function is too long. It can be split into functions to
initialize, connect, and download. The following can be used for
reference:

Please don't reply to this thread. The other one please. Looks
horrible in the archive view.

It may also crash some people's mail clients.

Your points taken. But the dl() function ain't long.

Answering to your reply on dl() function not being too long. It is not
just that. It is a question of being modular.

Tomorrow, if I want to change the way I connect or download, I only
need to change the function that does that rather than the dl()
function. In fact, one can have multiple functions for different types
of connections, and let the user choose based on options
(static/dynamic). A function must do one job and do it well. This
allows the design to scale, rather than having to maintain multiple
versions of the dl() function.

Of course, this is a trivial example for demonstration, but, good
habits start early.

Okay man. Please send your version. People can choose what they want.

I am going to send the same thing in perl and python on subsequent days.

I will also try to do it using lua with the luasocket library.

We can't do this with shell scripts.

       Not nitpicking, but I guess that's an RFC violation ;) HTTP 1.1
says Host header is mandatory. From RFC 2616, :

"A client MUST include a Host header field in all HTTP/1.1 request messages ."

And nice initiative. People on the list, new to socket programming can
possibly start with this. Thanks

Okay. I only get irritated when people don't talk technical. You do and it is a
 genuine flaw. No problem. I am only glad.

Only that I dunno how to fix it. Are you supposed to say something like:

"HOST foobar \r\n\r\n"

or something?

I am sure it is before the GET right?

I am aware of many other flaws too. Like this won't work with HTTP 301
redirects as is the
 case with tinyurls which is what Shrinivasan is fond of.

And I am definitely not RFC compliant since I said that URL encoding
is not handled. And I don't
 handle all the header responses. So this is not a surprise.

Can you throw some light on your point please?

Moreover my point was only a broad example to illustrate the concept.

One has to build on top of it. It has educational value and gives a
real life kick.

For something professional more work is required.

But it is also a truth of life that majority of professional
commercial grade code is not
standards compliant.

libcurl is quite mature, and I am giving an example to show separation
of functions. It can also be used with https URLs. Make sure you have
libcurl, libcurl-devel installed on your system. Compile using:

  $ gcc test.c -o test -lcurl

Test with:

  $ ./test

=== BEGIN ===

#include <stdio.h>
#include <curl/curl.h>
#include <curl/types.h>
#include <curl/easy.h>
#include <string.h>

size_t
write_data (void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)
{
  size_t written = 0;

  written = fwrite(ptr, size, nmemb, stream);

  return written;
}

int
curl_initialize (CURL **curl)
{
   *curl = curl_easy_init();

   return 0;
}

int
curl_download (CURL *curl, FILE *fp, char *url, char *outfilename)
{
  CURLcode res = CURLE_OK;

  if (curl) {
    fp = fopen(outfilename,"wb");

    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url);
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, write_data);
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, fp);

    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  }
  else
    printf ("curl is NULL!\n");

  return 0;
}

void
curl_cleanup (CURL *curl, FILE *fp)
{
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);

  if (fp)
    fclose(fp);
}

int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  CURL *curl = NULL;
  FILE     *fp = NULL;

  char *url = "http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/simple.html";
  char outfilename[FILENAME_MAX] = "/tmp/result.html";

  curl_initialize (&curl);

  curl_download (curl, fp, url, outfilename);
  curl_cleanup    (curl, fp);

  return 0;
}

=== END ===

There is scope for further abstraction, and refining of APIs - left as
an exercise.

No, it is after GET. It is something like this

GET http://someurl.something/xyz HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: someurl.something\r\n
\r\n

       True, but since this is a simple program to download
something(I guess this is intended more towards learning than
real-life usage), we cannot be fully RFC compliant with regards to
HTTP responses. :)

> Can you throw some light on your point please?

      The point is, since it is an RFC "MUST", I am not sure if all
servers will process the request if it doesn't have a HOST Header. If
we are sure they will process, then this is not even an issue. For a
simple learn-networking script, it should be more than sufficient.

       I assumed it would be part of the TIP itself :). Thanks for the

Subject: [Ilugc] Tech talk in Chennai?
Message-ID: <CALDskyz7dmOvZe8A9evX-Zyn_4d_8uqL3vdPjSD2zL+fV+QsEg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

It has been a really long time since I did a tech talk for one day.

It will be on a Sunday from 9 am to 4 pm or something. One tea break
in the morning,
 one in the afternoon and a lunch break.

Based on my experience now there is some data about how this works.

If you charge 150 per head then that gives us allowance for providing
tea/coffee and biscuits.

The rest can go towards paying for the hall.

In other words,

"Hall/place is the only problem."

Moreover we also need a projector and about 10 PCs. People can share
computers ; in fact I feel that
 it is even better than individual computers. In other words we are
looking at a place with projectors and
 computers. So it is a hall + facilities for training.

And based on experience I feel that a workshop/training is much better
than a simple classroom of theory.

This works very well with all experience levels; just have live code
samples and little bit of theory to make
 a story.

If this formula is adopted the hall business need not become
somebody's obligation like ever before.

I am tired of going to people asking for charity/help in arranging a venue.

Now please guide me where in Chennai we can get a place like this. You
know something about
 the business side of things. Assuming a minimum of 30 people turning
up we have Rs.4500/- to work
 out the rest.

In other words  if we fund ourselves then there is no obligation
anywhere. The college can make some
 money as well.

Can some college help us?

IIT's ADI-Tenet comes to mind but let us avoid IIT.

Any thoughts?

Dear all,

This is further to the tech talk idea I mailed just now.

The talk is at least a month away. Most likely it will be in December
or January depending on
 the availability of hall and other logistics.

Now as to topics, I can cover any of the following.Based on public
vote I will declare the topic
 in a subsequent e-mail.

Unfortunately I still dunno how to build a voting portal. :)

So you can just reply to this mail with the preference.

Here is the list I can cover.

1) Perl
2) jQuery and javascript
3) UNIX/Linux shell scripting
4) Networking and security(for sysadmins)
5) C, pointers and common examples(sockets, linked lists, common data
structures)

I won't do the topic 4) right away. Later only.

Programming is what interests me. Networking class is more trouble and
can't be done with several
 variables like now.

It depends on your perspective on Free / Open Source Software. If you look
at it just as a collaborative way of building software, the OP may sound
off-topic. But if you understand the true essence of Free Software [1],
which is freedom to the computer users rather than a technical approach to
software development, it is well related to ILUGC (remeber we don't talk
only about *Linux*).

AFAIK, ILUC is not just about Linux, the kernel. It's also about *Free 
Software*. FSF and EFF are fighting to oppose these bills as they take 
control over our computing. These bills also aspire to break the 
Internet as we know it. How can it not be of significance?

I agree with your argument on the definition of free. But, in this 
current context we are talking about Internet in US as free which is 
just out of scope of this list, in my opinion. And, besides, the issue 
is related to American legislature where we don't have any role. A 
debate on the topic is not much useful to us since there is nothing much 
we can do about it, other than learn a couple of things about the 
corruption in American system.

But if you would like to change the debate towards something similar 
happening in India. My opinion might be entirely different.

Internet is not the problem of the US. If the Protect IP and SOAP bills 
are passed they can bring the Internet down which will affect everyone. 
The Internet is not region specific -- we all are connected.

The Internet is like the climate of Earth, doesn't matter who started 
the global warming it will kill us all. So, in my humble opinion it is 
of extreme importance.

My argument is not about significance of the issue, it is about 
relevance to the list. And, the discussion is not about the news but the 
article that has been shared.

I still do think, the article is out of scope of this list, my reply for 
the argument on "definition of free" applies here.

Agreed. As an individual, here in Chennai, what can I do about it ? 
Within my limited thinking capabilities, I couldn't come up with 
anything. Its a political problem which the American people have to 
stand against.

So, you are suggesting that the news is not relevant to the list even if 
it is all about opposing the dangerous bill. A quote from the article:

This bill would establish a system for taking down websites that the 
Justice Department determines to be dedicated to copyright infringement. 
The DoJ or the copyright owner would be able to commence a legal action 
against any site they deem to have "only limited purpose or use other 
than infringement," and the DoJ would be allowed to demand that search 
engines, social networking sites and domain name services block access 
to the targeted site. It would also make unauthorized web streaming of 
copyrighted content a felony with a possible penalty up to five years in 
prison.

*a legal action against any site*

Since you said it has nothing to do with India, let me quote the article 
again:

EFF writes, "Proponents of the latest disastrous IP bill , the ?Stop 
Online Piracy Act? (SOPA) insist it only targets the ?worst of the 
worst?: so-called ?rogue? foreign websites that profit from pirating 
U.S. intellectual property. But the broad definitions and vague language 
in the bill could place dangerous tools into the hands of IP rights 
holders, with little opportunity for judicial oversight.  One very 
possible outcome: many of the lawful sites you know and love will face 
new legal threats."

*foreign websites that profit from pirating U.S. intellectual property.*

India is a foreign country for the US.

You still think the article is irrelevant to the list and to India?

1. Learning is good.
2. US of A controls the parts of internet that for all practical purposes
is a major portion of our use. It controls most blogging providers, cloud
services, GMail, all .net, .org, and .com domains (which I can see you are
using; If you care about USA telling Verisign to cut your domain off from
DNS then you should know about this. ;-) ).

Often? No. Once in a while and that too of importance yes. I did not 
know that Linus Torvalds' exclusive interview should have not been 
posted on Linux Users Group.

It's not a 'personal' blog, it's news website. If the list has issues I 
won't post anything from now own wards.

Yes, we don't have much to do about it, but sharing a bad thing happening
around need not be taken as a call for action. It can be just an effort to
create awareness on the issue.

Also, voice from outside the country may encourage the Americans to look
into the issue and raise their voice as well. *Sharing* is an essential
part of Free Software, after all.

May be if the OP had added [OT] tag, this debate wouldn't have started.

AFAIK, There is no rule on the mailing list which says, commercial 
organizations shouldn't send an email for commercial gain. So, you don't 
have to go that far as to even think about not posting. Please do 
continue to contribute to the list, in the spirit of FOSS.

I agree. May be, I should have mentioned *that* in my first reply. But, 
anyways, a healthy debate is good for the list, gets us thinking.

Message-ID: <CACm7z1an4a_F4FnKZ7036gj11mkD_vU=z0S5WPmqFHRs-4=fZg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear folks,


Myself(S. Prasanna Venkadesh <http://prasopensource.wordpress.com>) and
S.Sathianarayanan(http://sathia27.wordpress.com/) has created a terminal
application called WHIZ-CHAT - through wh application caich Debian / Ubuntu
Linux users can do the following on their Google account from terminal
itself:

1. Login and set Status Message.
2. Check number of Unread Mails.
3. Chat with the contacts in your Gmail Account.
4. Get voice notifications.


Here is our page that consists of the source code (
https://github.com/PrasannaVenkadesh/Whiz-Chat/downloads), and i request to
take a look at "README.txt & features.rdoc " file before running for first
time.

Inspiration:

Most of the linux users spends time either in Web-Browser or in Terminal,
and we were thinking how nice it would be if we are able to chat from
terminal itself instead of opening a Web-browser. This saves your processor
from consuming more power (since no GUI), Faster than Web-browser, and
especially for those who use internet via mobile phone would love it
because using internet from mobile and opening Gmail account takes nearly
10 min and our app log in into your chat box in just 10 seconds (Max.).
This was our inspiration to develop this and future versions will be still
more better.


And we love any sort of feedback from you.

Great Job!

Have you looked at talk or screen or write which are already available?

Just a thought. I have used these for support across continents using

Super. Congrats.

First thought:

Why don't you put this up on sf.net?

Sourceforge will give you lot of exposure and capabilities.

Are you using Google's APIs?

UNIX even today does not have a neat conferencing tool on the console.

We have xchat but that is a boring GUI.

Only available choice is irssi or icb.

Can you elaborate if you are using nCurses?

Also I believe using Google API is neat because these days everyone
has a Gmail account.

However this should also work with UNIX usernames.

That is my idea. Sorry for hijacking the thread.

Best of luck and may God bless you with success.

I like the idea and it is good to see that you have implemented it.

Looking at the code, I notice that there several things that needs to be 
done to bring it to a reasonable quality.

- Proper Indentation of code
- Try avoiding system() as much as possible
- 'reset' will clear the terminal emulator's (xterm) history find 
alternative.

I don't know Ruby so I cannot comment on code any further. Ruby experts 
in the list might be able to help you better.

I did try to do the setup but ruby gloriously crashes with libc's buffer 
overflow error.

$ sudo gem install gmail
*** buffer overflow detected ***: /usr/bin/ruby terminated
======= Backtrace: =========
/lib/libc.so.6(__fortify_fail+0x4d)[0x5dec5d]

$ gem list

*** LOCAL GEMS ***

colorize (0.5.8)
highline (1.5.1)
mime (0.1)
mime-types (1.17.2)

Hi,

Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi and Pure are participating in the Global Day of
Coderetreat 2011!

Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event focused on the
fundamentals of software development and design.The unique coderetreat
format (which eliminates the pressure of 'getting things done' and focuses
on practicing basic principles of good design) has proven to be a highly
effective (and fun) means of skill improvement. Check out to Corey Haines's
coderetreat site (http://coderetreat.com) if you want further details on
what to expect.

On December 3rd, Coderetreats will be held at cities all over the world.
It's going to be a lot of fun!

You can register at:

Bangalore: http://blr-global-coderetreat-11.doattend.com/
Chennai: http://chennai-global-coderetreat-11.doattend.com/
Delhi: http://delhi-global-coderetreat-11.doattend.com/
Pune: http://pune-global-coderetreat-11.doattend.com/

You only need to bring a laptop with the development tools you require to
write code using your chosen programming languages. A breakfast and lunch
will be provided.

Please spread the word amongst other developers and mailing lists.

This event is hosted by ITT (Innovation Technology Trust) and co-sponsored
by ThoughtWorks and C42 Engineering. If you have any problems registering,
or have any other questions, feel free to contact me (niranjan at c42.in).

Just now checked Screen and thanks for your idea. I think now i can use
Screen as a emulation terminal for my chat app and it ends when exit is
called. I hope i am right. If not please correct me!!

Yes, i had a thought of putting it and will surely put it in sourceforge,
since i started to learn VCS using Git so i initially did all my commits
there and got a account in Github and now its time to do it in Sourceforge
soon after my semester exams are over :-)

No, we are not using Google's APIs but Rubygems that access the Google via

yeah, i have tried it, not so experienced with it.

No, initially i got advice to used nCurses but since Ruby already has a gem

Your point is right. We need to make it a quality product.

We have used 'reset' because the reason is the command 'history -c' clears
only the history of commands used but not the chats that we exchanged using
our app. When the terminal window is scrolled up it shows what all we had
in chat, and its violating the privacy, so used reset to erase of
everything.

Ya looking for their feedbacks too. I think our code should be packed well
(like separating into individual modules).

Ah ok. "reset" is the right one to use here. But, what you really need 
is cup mode. Although, they are not supported in some terminal types.

Cup mode is not very well documented so you might find a hard time 
getting details on them. Here is a short tutorial on that. On Unix 
Terminals, there is a feature to open an Alternate Screen which is 
essentially what cup mode is. To try it, you can do the following,

$ echo -en "\033[?1049h"; clear; echo "abcd"; sleep 5; echo -en 
"\033[?1049l"

The above commands create an alternate screen, stay on it for 5 seconds 
and exit to the original screen. The first echo line is to enter cup 
mode and the last echo line is to exit cup mode.

And, To check whether a terminal supports cup mode, you can do the 
following,

$ infocmp vt100 | grep smcup #vt100 doesn't support cup
$ infocmp xterm | grep smcup #xterm supports cup
         sgr0=\E(B\E[m, smacs=\E(0, smam=\E[?7h, smcup=\E[?1049h,

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl script for downloading using HTTP
Message-ID: <CALDskyxw8J-K7dofg5j0cwvRe=udJ8OUaPt3nuf3sU+dz3proQ@mail.gmail.com>

Before I begin I have to thank Balachandran Shivakumar for his
suggestion to add
the Host header. I have done that in the C code as well as Perl. Many thanks.

I also appreciate his help.

Now this time around we are doing the same thing in perl. Tomorrow
will be Python.

Then we will shift gears.

Look at the code.

$ cat htdl.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl

use IO::Socket::INET;

$url = shift;
if($url !~ /\w/) {
	die "Please give URL to download!\n";
}

$url =~ /http:\/\/(.*?)\/(.*)/;
$host = $1;
$path = $2;
$2 =~ /.*\/(.*)/;
$file = $1;

$sock = IO::Socket::INET->new(PeerAddr => $host,
			 PeerPort => 'http(80)',
			 Proto => 'tcp');
if(!defined($sock)) {
	die "Could not open socket to $host\n";
}

print $sock "GET /$path HTTP 1.1\r\n\r\nHost foo.bar\r\r\r\n";

open F, ">$file" or die "Could not open file in current dir, check perms\n";

read $sock, $buf, 8192;

$buf =~ s/(.*?)\r\n\r\n(.*)/$2/ms;

print "Wrote " . length($buf) . " bytes to file\n";
print F $buf;

while($bytes = read $sock, $buf, 8192) {
	print F $buf;
	print "Wrote $bytes to file\n";
}
close($sock);
close(F);

print "Wrote $file to disk\n";

You can download from
ftp://tulip.pye.org/htdl.pl

The code with syntax highlighting
ftp://tulip.pye.org/htdl.pl.html

Now you have to run like yday

$ chmod +x htdl.pl

$ ./htdl.pl http://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-source-0.9.6.tar.gz

If your perl is not in /usr/bin, then you will have to change the shebang line.

You also can run it like this:

$ perl htdl.pl http://ftp.openssl.org/source/openssl-source-0.9.6.tar.gz

Now I will do a bit of code walkthro'.

Before that I did a performance benchmark. Both the C and perl
versions take the same time.

Lines 10 to 14 use regular expressions to split the URL into host,
file and path tokens.

However I should have used split like this.

($d, $d, $host, @path) = split /\//, $url;

$file = $path[$#path];

$path = join "/", @path;

Instead I used the regex pattern capture operator () and the
backreference $1 to do the same thing.

The split idea would have been neat.

Anyway as you can see there is no need to do DNS is perl. It is a high
level language. Moreover number of lines also is
 less not because I am using perl. It is because I am using the
IO::Socket::INET module.

I think this is not a separate CPAN module. It is a standard perl distribution.

In using that I avoided some 15 lines of painful code of opening a
socket, connecting and so on.

This does it in one stroke(line 16). Also it uses Perl OO.

Remaining stuff is opening a file handle F and writing to it using print.

print $foo

will write to standard output.

print $sock $foo

will write to the TCP, UDP or UNIX socket we open.

prinf F $foo

will write to the file descriptor opened with open() call of perl.

Doing socket I/O in perl is easy. Just like regular socket I/O in C
except that you don't have to use
 buffers.Use scalars instead.

In both C and perl we are not using any HTTP library. So the header in
the response needs to be removed.

But tomorrow in python we see that this is not necessary since python
ships with httplib.

That is tomorrow.

Hi,

I introduce myself as Sathish kumar.
Basically web application developer in LAMP technology.

I would like to know about setting-up mirror server and database server in
sync mode.

we have one server at one Geo-location and we need to set-up another server
at another Geo-location on different network.
Same application will be running in both server, and separate Database
server running on each on various host ip.
All database operations will be done at both server. So that i need to
set-up both databases always in synchronize with each other.

It would be grateful if anyone give idea or suggestion on doing the same.

Thanks.

Regards ,
Sathish.M Kumar

Look up on Database Replication[1].
And what Database are you running? If its postgres check out

Application in on PHP,  Database server is mysql and also postgresql for
another kind of application.

So MySql and Postgresql.

If the apps and databases are isolated and don't interfere with each
other, just set up replication separately for MySQL and Postgres and
you are done.

Various host ip? What is meant by that?

Typically directory syncs are done every 5 minutes or so.

If you are talking about a database then syncs are done much quicker.

But all that is only when you have a colocated setup. That is not the
case for you.

You can use VPN to connect the two locations, use something like IPsec
or even SSLVPN.

Then you can synchronize the database using the hints given in other posts.

If nothing works you can use rsync between them.

Basic flow is this:

1) setup a cron job to invoke the sync operation every n seconds

2) sync both ways(no master/slave relationship), the cron job is run
at every location

3) Make sure the DBs are not written to when the sync is
happening.Lock the DB whilst performing
 the sync

I really like your attitude. It is the first time after several years
that I am seeing someone
 with the humility and bhava that makes great techies.

I am very glad to see you here. And I am very certain you will scale
great heights with your
 great attitude.

I see many people in LUG who lack the Bhava. Looks like God has given
that only to certain
 chosen individuals.

Anyway.

Well it took me little over 3 years to learn.

So please be patient and keep at it.

Perl is very messy because it has way too many special characters and
complications.

But it is fun nevertheless.

My spam control product is almost entirely written in some 30000 lines of perl.

Won't this lock entire tables every n seconds? If the OP wants
immediate replication this 'n' will be very small.
And rsync'ing raw database files is never a good idea.

Yes, i understand the difficulties of rsync'ing the raw database files.

I need to proceed with DB replication procedure for database tables and
data synchronizing.

Is anyone come across replication middleware available for Mysql and
Postgresql ?

For postgresql, you can use the two phase commit (Prepare and commit
across servers to maintain consistancy) at the application level.

If the geolocation are very well connected, say by redundant fibres,
perhaps you should look at DRBD for block level replication. I have
done DRBD, but within a campus where reliable connectivity could be
guaranteed, and not across districts/continents etc.

Tamil Wikipedia is conducting a Media Contest. Participate and upload
your photos, audio and video files, animations, graphs and maps
related to Tamil and Tamils.

The TamilWiki Media contest is being organised to increase the quality
media content related to Tamil and Tamilians in Wikimedia projects,
 To attract non-text contributors like photographers, graphic artists,
animators, map makers and videographers to Tamil wiki projects.

Not everyone can write articles can Wikipedia. Some may don't have
enough time to write articles while some may not like writing
articles. But taking photographs or videos might be easier and
preferable for them. They might also possess many multimedia files
they have created in the past. Moreover the procedure for uploading
files to Wikimedia has become simple now. So anyone can take part in
this contest easily and contribute to Tamil Wiki projects.

By uploading the files to Wikimedia Commons - a sister project of
Wikipedia, they can be be used not only in Tamil Wikipedia but also in
other language wikipedias and other Wikimedia projects like
Wiktionary, Wikibooks and Wikinews

My humble suggestion is not to go with google. The billing system is 
painful from my past experience since you cannot renew your domain 
registration until the last moment. On failing to renew on time, the 
domain goes into the vault which can cost you more to unlock. On failing 
to unlock, it goes into the public domain after a few months.

http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google%20Apps/thread?tid=1ef303706ea554ef&hl=en

The thread is a little old but it was valid on Sep 2010 and I think, it 
is valid even now.

"If you do not renew domain registration within the 19-day window of 
opportunity, your domain name will be 'vaulted' by the registrar company 
(GoDaddy.com or eNom.com). A 'vaulted' domain name is not publicly 
available for registration, nor can it be redeemed without additional 
charges.

To recover a 'vaulted' domain, you must contact the registrar company to 
re-obtain the domain at an additional fee of $89 for GoDaddy.com and 
$160 for eNom.com. You can find contact information for Godaddy.com or 
eNom.com in the Advanced DNS settings section of the control panel."

Once you get a domain, you can still register with Google Apps for 
getting the services.

+1.

As a general practice, I register my domain with an ICANN approved
registrar.   Get DNS service for the respective domains to be hosted
by another provider, email by Google Apps or the web hosting provider.
 Administration is a bit more work but when it comes to switching any
one service, I am not beholden to one provider who holds all the
apples :)

Subject: [Ilugc] Technical talk on perl from 9 am to 4pm on 18th Dec,
	2011 Sunday
Message-ID: <CALDskyxx05GJghfviBAkQbNH11P9CUtvBCb6-KZNAnypV=RnUg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear LUGGies,

Mr. Asokan Pichai , one of the founding members of ILUGC has kindly
helped out with all the
 arrangements needed for the one day training I promised just a couple
of days ago.

It goes without saying that without his support this would not have happened.

We owe a lot of gratitude for this kind gesture.

Details are below:

Topic: Perl programming
Date: 18th December Sunday (9 am to 4 pm)
Venue: TalentSprint
             66 Gaudia Mutt Road
             Royappettah

             Right next to Gaudia Mutt
             A little ahead of Ponnuswamy Hotel
             5 minutes walk from Music Academy

Fee per head to cover expenses: Rs. 150/-

Good. Now for the other blurb.

It goes without saying that tea/coffee,biscuits will be served once in
the morning and once in the afternoon.
Lunch is on you. ;)

Both of us plan to make this a monthly affair. So if all goes well God
willing we can
 have monthly classes at  the same venue and you will be notified at least
 10 days in advance.I however have my doubts whether this could happen every
 month. Let us see.

We will try to rotate topics as we move along. Sometimes shell
scripting, sometimes C,
 sometimes web programming and javascript and so on.

It is again a google initiative, but with:

This is very short code and also very different from the C and perl
versions past.

Partly due to the fact that we use httplib module but I think it has
also got to
 do with python's elegance.

Let me do a code walk thro'.

Lines 8 to 11 deal with using split() to obtain relevant tokens.

Unlike the perl and C versions we don't get to know live feedback and print of
 how many bytes were read from the network.

Moreover python slurps the whole file from network into a huge data buffer and
 then writes to a file at one stroke. So it is all or nothing.

If you press Ctrl-C when the script is running you get nothing.

But in the perl and C case you get a half filled file.

Though I am not a python geek this proves python's elegance in a small way.

#1 If you decide to use features, you will want to integrate it with
Cucumber [1]

#2 You will need to use the copyright header notice as mentioned in
the GNU website [2]

#3 Avoid using system(). If you decide to use shell commands, you can
enclose them within backticks, and return the result to a variable. It
is good to check the status, always!

#4 Follow Ruby coding guidelines, strictly. Fix your indentation.

#5 Write variables in full. @choice instead of @choic.

#6 Ruby is also about being concise. You don't require the parenthesis
in the if() statement.

  if @choice == 'y'

instead of

  if(@choic == 'y')

The same goes with function invocation: quit instead of quit().

Did you do some research on finding available chat clients that work
from the terminal? If yes, how different are they from your
implementation?

Emacs has jabber support [3]. irssi has xmpp support [4] to talk to a
Jabber network. There is also the option of using BitlBee [5] that can
act as a gateway for multiple chat protocols. This allows you to use
any console client of your choice.

Another example with urllib2:

=== BEGIN ===

#!/usr/bin/python

from optparse import OptionParser
import urllib2

parser = OptionParser()

parser.add_option("-u", "--url",
                  action="store", type="string", dest="url",
                  help="http download url")

(options, args) = parser.parse_args()

if options.url:
    u = urllib2.urlopen(options.url)
    local_file = open('/tmp/result.out', 'w')
    local_file.write(u.read())
    local_file.close()

=== END ===

Feel free to customize it to suit your needs.

Subject: [ILUG-Cochin.org] Firefox
To: <mailinglist at ilug-cochin.org>

Here i have a small trick to make firefox more secure,for me it is a new
experience so i wish to share it with you.

if you have an opened ff close it via , file->quit

open terminal and type: firefox -p

add a new profile and start FF.

quit FF and cd to : /home/$USER/.mozilla/firefox

then: vi  profiles.ini

you can see : [profile x] tag

place the flag: default=1 in a profile which you wish to open as default

then open terminal and type: firefox -p <your personal profile name>

go to: http://nic-nac-project.de/~kaosmos/profilepassword-en.html

you get an extenstion to set profile passwords , install it . then go to
tools->profile passwords set a password.but i can't say we can trust that
extension.

then you can launch firefox : firefox -p <profile name>

then FF will ask you for password.you required to enter correct password to
launch FF.but anyone sharing your account can use the default profile and
cant use your personal profile.

Forget urllib2 and httplib, use requests

I have a need.

All of you would have seen newspaper print and PDF documents in which
two columns of text are displayed.

The first column will be half the page, there will be a vertical line
or a just a space and the next column will be
 alongside.

So people read the text from the left column and once they are done
they switch over to the right column.

I hope you get what I mean.

Now I want to do this with plain text. How to do that?

I know that fmt can format the text to wrap around at 36 instead of
standard 72 chars.

After that how to "paste" text into the right side?

Any ideas?

For all the effort exerted, for every minute of the year, some gave of
their time talent or treasure. There's the Ubuntu Community
Apreciation Day, when everybody -- whether user, developer, or
non-developer contributor anyone who gives a hand making Ubuntu what
it is today -- everybody takes a moment to thank someone for their
contribution. Every contribution counts! Take time to say, "Thank
you!"

The word Thanks inspires and gives a huge amount of motivation to
encourages people to become even better contributors thus making
Ubuntu and the community even better.

Greetings,

What steps are needed to ensure that a particular USB external HDD is
always mounted on a different mountpoint than /media/<VolLabel> and
one particular non-root user gets rw access to that drive.

The 2TB drive has a NTFS partition with about 200GB of data in it. So
formatting is out of question. It will be connected to other Widows
(XP/7/2k3/2k8) machines.

TIA

Thanks for the quick response. But there comes the thing: does
udevinfo gives us information of uuid?

If so what rules should I write?

Should I add an entry to the /etc/fstab?

As this drive is to store as a backup (will be acting as amanda vtapes
on a centos amanda server) and removed every evening offsite and
possibly another hard hard disk (if I can get this to work), How will
get that to work? of course probability of both hard disk being
plugged in indeed low as one will be plugged to the system and another
will be offsite.

and what about the permissions? amanda requires a user level
permission. I found that the automount results in only root having
permission.

I had implemented amanda waaay back in Nov 2008. And I have Centos 5.x
as my server (stability) wwhich has amanda version something like 2.5
and the latest amanda version is 3.3. My windows clients have Zmanda
Windows Client is something like 3.x.

I have another battlefront open there too ;)

Thanks in advance

How about using autofs? I'd write a script for autofs which would
check, say the UUID, and then automatically mount it.

However, one thing I wouldn't know is whether this would supercede
the current (udev based) automounting feature; my experience is that
it works well.

Should you need some information on autfs scripts, please let me know.

My purpose in doing this is to automount an USB
drive. http://www.autofs.org has much information, but if you want to
mount it using a script, specify a script in the /etc/auto.master
file. For the scripts I adapted, I used this tutorial, which does much
more than what you want, but you should be able to simplify it:

http://www.einval.com/~steve/docs/gpg-autofs.html

Please let me know if you want some more specific information, but the
autofs website should be sufficient; the latter is much more detailed
for a specific task, and mostly unneeded, IMHO.

HTH.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] CGI tutorial
Message-ID: <CALDskyyovihhA5H7r99099m8+FYmAYSuAzuOb45CqQs_OZ2YgA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface.

It means nothing to us except that we have heard this being used for
 using executable programs with the web.

What is meant by the web?

It is a combination of HTML, HTTP and related technologies like CGI, Ajax and
 javascript to give the user a rich experience.

There is JSON and web APIs for sending data using HTTP between two
unconnected hosts.

All this takes time to learn. So I am going to focus on this theme for a week.

What is CGI?

It is a way to obtain dynamic data between the parent HTTP server and
the browser.

Whenever you visit a website using the http:// URL instead of the
file:/// URL even if you
 access a resource locally you are talking to a web server like Apache.

CGI is the only way to dish out freshly generated content using which
we can run any program on the
 web server and display it on a web page.

So CGI works within HTTP and HTML. There is no exception to this.

And this can only work between one browser and one server.

Now let us look at a very simple example.

Most CGI scripts are written in perl. You can use any language, even C
but perl is what we will use.

If you dunno perl you can use python or shell scripts. But perl used
to be the best choice long ago
 and I think it still is.

There are several frameworks built on top of CGI like Ajax(which we
will see very soon) and Catalyst.

But if you understand CGI you will know how

a) Google search works
b) online banking works
c) ticket reservation for air or train or bus
d) online purchase like eBay
e) Paypal

Nearly every website that offers a service with a DB backend uses CGI.

Usually CGI in the server is neatly handled by javascript in the
browser(browser is the OS for javascript)
 to give the user a thorough user experience.

We will conclude today's tip with a CGI sample.

# cat first.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use CGI;

$q = new CGI;

print $q->header;

This is the simplest CGI skeleton you can get.

After this preamble you can use any executable perl code like this.

$uname=`uname -a`;
print  $uname;

Instead of perl you can use shell like this:

#!/bin/sh

echo "Content-Type: text/plain";

echo " How are you?";

In the beginning you will have trouble. execute permissions, location
of CGI script,
 how the server invokes it etc.

Look at error_log in Apache's logs to find out. But once you cross
this stage we are
ready for tomorrow's CGI examples.

Message-ID: <CAFe1ooLJiBTb8txQqvjyH6y7KR0tBxTQUE7SOfpXE9yU_Py+wg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need a CD-ROM bay form factor gadget that will gave a 2 line or a 4 line
text/graphic LCD which will display system stats on a rotation basis. It
should start of saying 'Starting up' and once Linux boots, it should say a
welcome message. After that, it should show various system stats on
rotation basis. Apart from this, there should be a library which 3rd party
apps can use to show their own messages as additional slides.

Any college student / individual who is willing to do this please get in
touch with me. I can mentor (both software and hardware) this project as
well as fund it. The entire project can be released opensource.

I do know of a few projects doing the same, but I want an India specific
project which can use locally sourcable components.

I need this for one of my headless Linux boxes.

Regards,
Arun

Preferably, connect to internal USB connector in the motherboard.


Another option (I have never used it)
Some motherboards come with i2c connector too.
I have also seen a i2c driver in the kernel.

I2C > 8 bit Micro controller > 2/4/Text/Graphic LCD display.

Old project based on LPT port, mostly non existent today:
http://www.mv.com/ipusers/cdwalker/lpt_driver.html

A mature project:
http://ssl.bulix.org/projects/lcd4linux/wiki/CoolStuff

Another one:
http://lcdproc.org/


There are many more.
Most of these projects depend on serial or USB enabled LCD modules.
These are very expensive when we import it from the US.

kindly put quotes when you quote - we just had a very funny thread where
everyone was congratulating a person thinking that he was the author of
some software because he omitted to put quotes. In this case, stating
that Ubuntu gives a 'Human' experience implies that other distros give
an animal experience. It is ok if the Canonical gang does this - we are
used to it and can ignore it. It is not good if we repeat it, especially
when there are many Fedora and debian developers who are valuable
members of this list.

No, it does not imply so... it does not say it is the only distro that 
gives 'Human' experience. If someone introduces Fedora as free, fast and 
stable, does that imply others are non-free, slow or unstable?

It is ok (good) to praise the project one supports. To feel insulted by 
someone else's praise is outright kiddish, and narrow-mindedness.

For the hardware, look at CrystalFontz.com. I agree these are
expensive. I've integrated these for headless machines in 2001. These
used to come at $60-100 then.

I work with LCD displays now. We can get displays at a price points of
under $10 for 20x2 and 16x2 displays. Most of these controllers come
with SPI and UART interfaces. Look up http://www.trulydisplays.com or
http:/www.everbouquet.co.tw.

In the US, there is a DIY electronics site called Sparkfun
http://www.sparkfun.com and in India, we should get some such from EFY
site powered by element14.

It would be a good thing to take cheap displays, make a USB to SPI
convertor board, a bay mountable fixture possibly with buttons.
Overall cost budget should be pegged at $12-13 which is achievable.
Typical components and prices are LDO $1.5 ( 5V to 3.3V), a
microcontroller with a USB device (PIC or MSP $1.5)  and board would
cost approx $1 with passives.

We may need a library to be written to provide high level functions to
be able to write formatted text etc or interface this to lcdproc.

I've a hardware company that will work on this hardware for a small
payment, if someone can sponsor this. If someone can anchor the
software on the PC side, define the APIs to be implemented in
hardware, we could have a reasonable thing going.

I think the PIC18/24 is better to go with as Microchip has a library
that supports multiple display drivers from Ilitek, Solomon, Philips
etc. This will give us the flexibility of choice of LCD modules that
one would want to use.

PIC also has a processor series in DA series which has an inbuilt
display processor/driver. Only the display glass needs to be bought
and interfaced. This is a little more expensive as its pin package is
larger to interface to the glass.

I'll recommend the first approach - likely to be cheaper and less
hardware bound.

Yes, the cost is one of the reasons why it is better sourced here.

I will take a look at these links.
The 16x2 lines are available here at ritchie street from Rs.150/- but these
are all parallel interface. No serial interface.

I'm building a PIC based product with a display that interfaces on
SPI. The LCD driver also takes parallel. It is quite likely these
displays in Ritchie street can be stripped off the parallel interface
chip and be interfaced to our microcontroller directly. USB to
parallel i/f chips are expensive as they are low volume products.

Since I'm building a consumer product, I'm getting prices that are way
below sample pricing. I'll try and get some good prices.

Some other indicative pricing - 1.6" square 128x128 pixel LCD @ 3.5
USD, 128x32 pixel LCD @ 5.5 USD etc are achievable.

We can use software character generators in uC instead of having a
character generator chip in the LCD driver thus bringing down the
price. I've found dedicated USB <=> serial/parallel devices to be more
expensive (almost twice) than uCs that have USB/SPI etc and enough
general purpose programmable I/O pins to implement a 7 - 14 bit
parallel interface.

We will need to implement the parallel port handshake and protocol in
software. We've done that for SPI (softSPI) which works well.

Meant for headless PCs powered from the mains and so power should not
be a worry. Nevertheless, i think under 30milliamps budgeting
25milliamps for the display.

I read the datasheet wrong. 16x2 LCD display says max 2.35mA. uC takes
about 250microamps per Khz thus 2mA for 8Khz. Maybe 10mA would be the
max.

I do have a few headless PCs which I run 24x7 for testing & other 
purposes. It will be great to have this LCD display. Looks like 10mA on 
5v rail should be ~0.05W which seems like negligible.

I suspect the actual current rating and price would be a function of
the size of the LCD we choose. The displays I'm talking of are
typically 3"x0.75" graphics display units.

All of you might have an idea about document root for a web server.

That is the base directory from which static html pages are dished out.

Likewise there is a cgi-bin alias directory. You have to run all your
CGI scripts
 from under that.

You will realise that CGI is not too much fun in itself. Only when
Ajax and javascript(Ajax
 means javascript) come together we will have fun.

Today we are only looking at form filling and data transfer between
user and backend using CGI.

The browser signifies the user who enters a value for search or a
select drop down. Based on this
 the server can fetch some data dynamically.

Okay let us get started.

As I said yesterday CGI is all html. So all the html constructs can be
used with CGI.

You can google for CGI form elements and you can also read the man page of CGI.

$ man CGI

will tell you the way you can use the perl CGI module to construct
simple CGI scripts like
this.

$ cat first.cgi
#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI qw/:standard/;
print
header,
        start_html('Simple Script'),
        h1('Simple Script'),
        start_form,
        "What's your name? ",textfield('name'),p,
        "What's the combination?",
        checkbox_group(-name=>'words',
                        -values=>['eenie','meenie','minie','moe'],
                        -defaults=>['eenie','moe']),p,
        "What's your favorite color?",
        popup_menu(-name=>'color',
                        -values=>['red','green','blue','chartreuse']),p,
        submit,
        end_form,
        hr,"\n";

if (param) {
        print
                "Your name is ",em(param('name')),p,
                "The keywords are: ",em(join(", ",param('words'))),p,
                "Your favorite color is ",em(param('color')),".\n";
}
print end_html;

The same CGI script is used for both asking for data and showing the
results after
obtaining the data input by the user.

As in this case:

http://tulip.pye.org/cgi-bin/first.cgi

Ok this is bit of fun.

But you cannot do any animations with CGI,not even a simple page refresh.

Once you have browser cookies, javascript and JSON you can do quite a
bit of magic.

But the key to all this is Ajax(Asynchronous javascript and XML).

I dunno what the XML in it means as I have only used HTML which can be
argued as a subset
of XML.

Now CGI in its raw form has problems; like the page will be loaded in
full instead of a portion of
 a web page(a div). The only way to fight problems with CGI is to
combine Ajax and js magic.

Now Google Maps uses Ajax in a big way. And the only way you build
very user friendly apps
 in the browser is by using js techniques with CGI.

HTML5 promises 3D and drawing and several other things like gradients,
shadows and so on.

The canvas tag allows a lot of cool things and this works even in IE
with the explorercanvas js lib.

But first get yourself familiar with CGI.

Another useful CGI is;

#!/usr/bin/perl
use CGI;
$q = new CGI;

print $q->header;
$out = `fortune`;
print $out;

You can reload the page with F5 to get a new page everytime.

You can run just about any program inside the CGI script provided it
does not use
 nCurses or requires root permissions or relies on user input.

CGI scripts normally run as a different user from root. This is to
guard against web exploits.

CGI uses either of HTTP GET or HTTP PUT to obtain form filled data.

Now you see that CGI does its job using HTML and HTTP.

HTTP only has few methods.

GET
HEAD
PUT
OPTIONS
TRACE
POST

In the case of GET the parameters are passed to the CGI in the URL
itself. That is why you
 find Google search URL having the search term.

in the case of POST it goes as part of the page and in both cases the
CGI script sees the params
passed in standard input.

What CGI prints on standard output goes to the browser HTML rendering.

This gives a powerful dynamic HTML building capability.

Even javascript can write HTML and manipulate DOM.

We will see what a DOM is tomorrow.

GET or POST.

It uses PUT for file uploads. Here is a sample of file Upload CGI.

$ cat upld
#!/usr/bin/perl
use CGI;
use CGI::Carp qw ( fatalsToBrowser );
use File::Basename;
use Sys::Syslog;

$CGI::POST_MAX = 1024 * 5000;
my $safe_filename_characters = "a-zA-Z0-9_.-";

my $query = new CGI;

print $query->header ( );
$upload_dir = "/var/www/htdocs/upload/";
my @upload_files = $query->upload("file_upload");

my (@sha1sums, @md5sums, @sizes) = ();


for $upload_filehandle (@upload_files) {
        $filename = $upload_filehandle;
        if ( !$filename )
        {
                print $query->header ( );
                print "There was a problem uploading your file (try a
smaller file).";
                exit;
        }

        my ( $name, $path, $extension ) = fileparse ( $filename, '\..*' );
        $filename = $name . $extension;
        $filename =~ tr/ /_/;
        $filename =~ s/[^$safe_filename_characters]//g;

                if ( $filename =~ /^([$safe_filename_characters]+)$/ )
                {
                        $filename = $1;
                }
                else
                {
                        die "Filename contains invalid characters";
                }

        open ( UPLOADFILE, ">$upload_dir/$filename" ) or die "$!";
        binmode UPLOADFILE;

        while ( <$upload_filehandle> )
        {
                print UPLOADFILE;
        }

        close UPLOADFILE;

}

The CGI can only be called from a HTML file input form element.

You have to construct the HTML page like this:

<form action="/cgi-bin/upld" method="POST">
     <input type="file"></input>
      <input type="submit">Upload</input>
</form>

On form submit the file is uploaded.

But today with js and jQuery you need not wait till submit is pressed.

In fact I don't use submit at all. I use simple HTML buttons.

Hey

If you haven't heard about Google Code-In, it's a program to get
younger students involved in open source. It's Google's program for
pre-university students age 13 to 18. Please tell your younger
siblings and younger friends about it! Also, the program has
*non-coding* tasks as well!! So you don't need to code to be able to
contribute.

http://code.google.com/opensource/gci/2011-12/index.html

Also, here's some pimpage for KDE's proposed task list:

I guess, there might not be just one person or a few persons who we can 
call linux/FOSS gurus in India. IMHO, You might find a few persons who 
are experts in their own fields such as MySQL, Drupal, RoR, Subversion 
and several other open source technologies.

A Q&A section where practical problems are addressed will be more 
appealing to me such as "VPN & How to Setup OpenVPN" or "Blu-ray & How 
to get blu-ray working on Linux" etc.

Is there any requirement that it should be fedora 12. Since AFAIK,
fedora 12 is too old. Most likely you wont face this error in latest
fedora where the libraries will match the compiling ns.

I endorse what Ashwin has said. Even Fedora 14 will be reaching end of

This fetches data from http://ta.wiktionary.org/wiki/ and displays the

Problem is that it does not print tamil font clearly. I cannot read that
font. Eventhough I

installed tamil font in my system. What is way to print unicode character

Greetings!

One of my friends is looking to startup a company in Chennai and wanted
help assembling a team.

This will be a subsidiary of a consumer electronics company from the US.
The first product that will be worked on is small linux multimedia device
(form factor like a SheevaPlug).

Skills he is looking for are:

Optimizing and developing for embedded linux platforms (ARM based - not
necessarily android). This will include both kernel level work and user
space applications in the consumer multimedia area (DLNA, UPnP etc.)

Android app development to interface with said devices over the cloud or
directly.

Development of cloud infrastructure to provide services for such devices.

Understand working in a startup environment and how attitude is important
as much as skills/experience. This will be like a grounds up startup and
will come with related perks and responsibilities. :)

If you are interested, please contact me (strictly off list) and I will get
you in touch with my friend.

Thanks

What terminal emulator are you using ? I have tried tamil characters on 
both xterm (248) and gnome-terminal (2.28.1). Even if you set the 
terminal emulator to UTF-8 mode, xterm just doesn't know tamil while 
gnome-terminal doesn't use fixed width to display tamil characters which 
is what seems like happening in your case. Try the following in the 
command line,

echo -e "#\0340\0256\0205#"

If you notice that the tamil character is not between the '#' characters 
but instead overlaps with one, thats the problem ur facing then. I don't 
know of a solution to this, other than considering tamil characters to 
take twice the width and leave a space between some tamil characters you 
print.

Fedora 12 is outdated but yet i think the problem is not Fedora 12 but if
you check this download link of Network Simulator
http://nsl10.csie.nctu.edu.tw/products/nctuns/download/download.php it is
strictly mentioned that the latest version runs only on Red-hat Fedora 12.
I think this is the reason he is sticking with Fedora 12. any suggestions
for solution on this error?

Hi,
ask him to try installing it in a fedora 12 system that is natively installed and not in virtual system. I think its the virtual system that is creating problem.

I suggest you study the history of Ubuntu propaganda - there is a long
thread on this in this list (search for 'african spaceman'). It is
unfortunate but true that Ubuntu does not follow the norms for healthy
competition between distros that are followed by *all* the other
distros.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] HTML client side processing to talk to CGI
Message-ID: <CALDskyxWiC2H2L-pb6xDwCChM2QaC3n3N3niYzdBGi-fkzeAzw@mail.gmail.com>

Typically the CGI is not directly exported to the user like yesterday's example.

It forms part of a HTML Page that allows us to do Ajax and other javascript
 processing.

HTML has got a DOM structure(Document Object Model) tree hierarchy.

For example,

this page,

<html>
       <head>
                <title> Test </title>
       </head>

        <body>
                     <div id="left"> </div>
                     <div id="right"> </div>
        </body>
</html>

has a DOM structure like this:

                        html

                 head        body
                title        div(left)   div(right)

So as you can see, it is very easy to understand how this
structure works.

Now both CSS and javascript uses this model to act on
various HTML tags.

For instance we identify the <div> tag with id attribute "left" like this.

$('div[#left]').

This is also jQuery. We will talk about jQuery tomorrow.

Only when we use all this do we get a smooth user experience of giving
  CGI functionality in a very interactive way.

So to talk to the CGI script we saw yesterday we use javascript and Ajax
 like this:

<script src="jquery-1.6.2.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
   $(function() {
             $('#right').load('/cgi-bin/first.cgi', function() {
                  $('input[type=button]').click(function() {
                      param = $('input[type=text]').val();
                      $('#right').load('/cgi-bin/first.cgi?param=' + param);
               });
        });
 });
</script>

This portion is coded in the <head> container of the above HTML structure.

As you can see we are deeply into javascript and jQuery.

We will see that tomorrow.

Length or number of lines is not important. With backticks, you can
return the results to a variable. system() only returns the exit
status. Also read:

 $ man system

\--

One way to debug this is to try to redirect the output to a .txt or
.html file and check the output in gedit or firefox browser that
understands the encoding.

If rendered correctly, then the problem is with the gnome-terminal.

#1 Please put a header, copyright, license info if you are releasing
code to the public.

#2 You might want to give a detailed example on how to use your
program in the README with examples. I am not sure if you expect
English/Tamil text as input at various prompts.

#3 Add your contact e-mail address in the README

#4 Your exception cases need to be clearly specific. If you test for
Internet connectivity, then clearly say so.

#5 You have imported re, codecs, textwrap and not used it in the code

#6 It is good practice to check function return values before
proceeding to use them in your code

#7 Please add docstring when you write Python code

#8 Avoid magic numbers and strings, please. Move all your prompt
strings to separate variables, so tomorrow if you have to change them
you only have to do it once

#9 Fix your indentation

#10 Run pylint on your code and fix the warnings

If people need to be able to reproduce the error, they will need to

The following says NCTUNS has now become Estinet and only commercial

I don't think Nilekani ever worked for Wipro, only at Infosys. And everyone knows how Infosys and MS are very close to each other.

Regarding details, can RTI be applied to get the needed info?

The guru shishya mode of teaching worked out when the materials to
learn were scarce and it was politically volatile to have them spread.
Now, Linux or, any FOSS structure mandates collaboration and sharing.
Shouldn't you be looking away from the single "guru" idea ? As it
stands, available source code+documentation+IRC+UGs etc do make it
easier for a willing participant to acquire knowledge and demonstrate
enough caliber to be known as an expert/architect/name_what_you_want.

(I know this is OT, but just wanted to point out the down side of
fixating on gurus rather than working on a larger group of talented
individuals)

You will run into the age old squabble of "how do you arrive at who is
an expert"

By Guru I did not meant that, guru in today's terms is basically an 
'expert' in a field.

Agree.

> Shouldn't you be looking away from the single "guru" idea ?

We are thinking of profiling people. Just the way Linus is a guru, Greg 
is a guru, Alan, Maddog, Ts'o  -- they are all gurus. To have a page on 
each with their work will, in my understanding, encourage more people. 
And here we are talking about Indian contributors.

I am totally with you but at the same time do want to highlight 
individuals who have contributed to the growth and development of the FLOSS.

Ts'o to me is a filesystem expert/ Greg a device driver expert. I thinks 
let's start. There is no end to things stopping us from trying something.

It is fine if you put it that way. However, in your original post you
mentioned :

"So, I am thinking of a sub-section in Muktware where we profile/feature
one Linux/FOSS expert *from India* every week."

(the emphasis added is mine and is absent in the original)

James Vasile of FreedomBox foundation talks about importance of
privacy. Its a long speech but I strongly recommend everyone download
it and watch it completely. He explains things in easy to understand
language with lot of examples.

Subject: [Ilugc] Indian UID, Aadhar Project Is A Proprietary,
	Non Open Source Project?
Message-ID: <4ECA1DE5.7080309@gmail.com>

http://www.muktware.com/bitsnbytes/2983

I worked on the story and found oss is only a smoke screen. The entire 
UID project seems to be a pure Microsoft stack.

This document provides step-by-step instructions to install the AADHAAR 
Enrolment Client and Biometric components needed for Biometrics 
capturing. The document is not intended to be a user manual for the 
AADHAAR Enrolment Client. The application has been built to work with 
the given pre-requisites.

1.1 Installation Pre-requisites
? Operating System: Windows XP SP3 OR Windows 7 (only 32-bit editions)
? Windows Installer 4.5
? Microsoft .Net Framework 3.5 SP1
? Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Express
? Aadhaar QSS SDK Setup
? Vendor Device Manager

You can see how the UID project has made Microsoft technologies 
mandatory. You can't use it without Microsoft. There is no mention of 
Linux in this important document.

That clearly states that other than the already popular and powerful 
open source technologies such as Apache and MySQL rest of the stack is 
proprietary. Calling UID/Aadhar and Open Source project is like calling 
a Tata tractor a Mercedes just because one of its four tyres is a 
Mercedes tyre.

I feel this is a very very sad thing happening. Sometime back I read the only proprietary component used was for interfacing the devices since biometric devices come only with Windows drivers. Now it appears the entire stack is Windows-based.

Mr. Nilekani must be exposed and removed from this project. He has no vision for India and Indians; he appears to be a mere pawn working for the interests of MNCs looting India.

I found the database used by Aadhar was most probably SQL 2005;  which is absurd.

The lifetime of Aadhar  project is very very large compared to the lifetime of Microsoft products. Every 3 years versions of the OS, database, .Net Runtime etc. keep changing. It is a continuous upgrade treadmill into which the Govt of India project will be sucked into.

The biggest IT deployments (in my view) - or atleast some of the biggest IT deployments - are the Indian Railways ticketing system; and the Life Insurance Corporation system; both of which use Open Source.

ALL the biggest stock exchanges in the World use Linux based software, not Windows. The London stock Exchange was using TradeElect by Microsoft and Accenture; which they recently abandoned and went  back to Linux after crashes and performance hangs.

I request all members to suggest concrete methods by which this project can be rescued and made into Open Source stack, instead of merely complaining on a  mailing list.

Please post your constructive actionable  suggestions.

Thanks

I feel the same way. It is worrying to see our biometric data stored in 
such an insecure/unreliable system. While trying to gather more 
information on this, I came across a draft on NPCI (National Payment 
Corporation of India) integration with AADHAAR dated Oct 2010.

http://www.npci.org.in/documents/AADHAAR.pdf
http://www.google.com/search?q=npci+aadhaar

(This is a technical document so people who know about the working of 
credit/debit card retail payment system might be able to understand it 
better)

I find the mere idea of bringing in fingerprint check with every 
transaction very revolting. The added security/availability concerns in 
a windows based solution, makes the whole thing just scary.

IMO, If we can get some details on the architecture from UIDAI, we might 
be able to justify our concerns. So, I guess, the first step is to 
establish contact with the UIDAI technical group (atleast, one among the 
various departments/modules)

I have a suggestion. Can we rope in Dr. Abdul Kalam to mediate in this matter?

I am quoting from what Dr. Kalam said about open source software when he was president of India:

"I would like to narrate an event that took place in Rashtrapati Bhavan a few months back when I met Bill Gates, the CEO of Microsoft. While walking in the Mughal garden, we were discussing the future challenges in Information Technology including the issues related to software security. I made a point that we look for open source codes so that we can easily introduce the users built security algorithms Our discussions became difficult since our views were different.The most unfortunate thing is that India still seems to believe in proprietary solutions. Further spread of IT which is influencing the daily life of individuals would have a devastating effect on the lives of society due to any small shift in the business practice involving these proprietory solutions. It is precisely for these reasons open source software need to be built which would be cost effective for the entire society. In India, open source code software will have to come and stay in a big way for the benefit of our billion people."

The entire speech was available on NIC's website for the President  of India; itpromptly was completely removed from existence the day Dr.Kalam completed his  tenure!

Here's a link in my company's site: (the speech is now available only in private company links, so I am sorry for the shameless  plug:

http://fossible.kgisl.com/fossible/users.php?mode=apj_speek

I feel a  person of  Dr. Kalam's stature is needed in this fight, and the vested interests will have to bow down and give way. Does anyone here have contacts with Dr. Kalam?

Please let us keep this chat going.
---------------

Incidentally, a similar topic by Swapnil was categorised as off-topic by some, I would like to opine otherwise. FOSS is very much a social phenomenon as much as it is a matter of technology. We have to stand up and be counted to survive in the predatory world of proprietary software.

I quote from Wikipedia: "The free software movement is a social and political movement with the goal of ensuring software users' four basic freedoms: the freedom to run their software, to study and change their software, and to redistribute copies with or without changes."

Thanks for reading.

I think that would be a good idea. 

Can we start drafting a decent note and edit it collaboratively?

Any volunteers to kickstart the letter draft?

Why the diversion of topic to some past discussion. The point was whether
there was something wrong in the original post. Try to argue on the basis
of the merits of the current topic of why should one feel bad if someone
describes Ubuntu as providing 'Human' experience.

I think, the aadhaar project has started to be implemented, which means, 
bulk of development got already over.  In this case, will they be 
changing to open source, after spending 100 crores?

As far as I know for actual deployment http://cassandra.apache.org/ will be
used as database, infact if I am not wrong they are experimenting over it
for quite a long.

HI,
    It is well said in  this article
http://www.muktware.com/bitsnbytes/2983 that Microsoft's solutions are
pushed in . But unlike it is said in the article in server part open source
solution is used entirely. the data base being MongoDB, Redhat and Suse
share Os part, Apache hadoop,etc. But not sure of client side.

I won't be surprised if the clients are windows based while the server 
components being linux based. This is the established trend, in general. 
But looking at a document which mentions MSSQL seems to indicate otherwise.

can you cite some references ? It will be really helpful.

 try to see a complete sample of the HTML javascript client side processing.

We need to understand what is jQuery. By now most of you people will know.

It is a javascript library, a toolkit built on top of the javascript
programming language.

Javascript is not java. It is a fantastic language. It supports
closures, OO and several
 such concepts that make it ideal for DOM manipulation we saw
yesterday, html rewriting and
 generally working with strings and math.

The first step before we go any further is to download jQuery from
http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js

Otherwise you can directly use the URL in your script tag like this:

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script>

Okay now that you have jQuery let us learn js and jQuery together.

jQuery significantly simplifies web development and js coding because
of the rich variety of
 plugins(http://plugins.jquery.com) and the smallness.

It is the smallest js library and it is very very powerful.

It is a topic in itself, but today we are only going to touch the
basics. I will cover the rest in
 one of our monthly Sunday classes.

First a complete sample to begin learning jquery.

<html>
<head>
   <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script>
   <script type="text/javascript">
   $(function() {
           alert("jquery init");
    })
    </script>
   </head>
   <body>
   </body>
</html>

Another thing. This code need not be in a webserver for us to run.

This can be accessed even using a file:/// URL.

All jQuery code is written inside the container,

$(function() {

 })

This is the starting point of jQuery just like the main() function of
the C language.

Once the html page loads the execution starts. This is also known as
the onLoad() or
 window.load() event.

Anyway you can do some simple and really nice animations with jQuery
without using
 any plugin.

For example you can do something like:

$(function() {
              $('body').append("<h1> Simple animation </h1>').show();
               $('h1').hide(6000);
})

Here is the complete sample.

$ cat /home/girish/sample.html

<html>
<head>
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js"
type="text/javascript"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
        $(function() {
                $('body').append("<h1> Simple animation</h1>").show();
                $('h1').hide(6000);

        })
</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

You can test this by typing

file:///home/girish/sample.html

in your browser.

Of course you have to change the home directory accordingly. ;)

Before we go any further you have to install the firebug FF(firefox)
plugin that will help
 us debug javascript.

Towards the end of this theme in a few days we will see what relation
this has with CGI.

Yes this letter looks good.

They have a section for technical architecture here.

http://uidai.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=153&Itemid=13

We can request them to publish another diagram with product and vendor
label for each component.

It is OK if they have proprietary software at the client side. They must
support both proprietary OS and FOSS OS at the client side given the wide
deployment of clients.  It is NOT OK if they use proprietary software at
the server side. ( MS SQL, ASP, IIS etc ).

The section on the tender(s) is the one where reading time could be
spent. <http://www.uidai.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=144&Itemid=162>

A search for "UID RFP" should also provide links to the multi-volume
PDF document providing architecture details, message protocols and so
forth.

quote from Mumbai list:

"
Adhar and the UIDAI are a fraud of the first order. They dont have a
clue 
about identity, biometrics or security. Never mind the various social
factors 
involved in eligibility to subsidy, recieving disbursement, corruption
etc. 
All of which is claimed to be cured by the snake oil known as AAdhar.

Mr. NN is an arrogant, ignorant marketroid, in the mould of various M$
execs.

I don't know about gurus but there is a list of contributors at

http://fci.wikia.com/wiki/Contributors

It is probably not the most comprehensive one however.  Maybe a decent
start and you can ask for more.

I think Sanskrit is qualified as per the documentation given above.
When I tried to install sa_IN locale in Ubuntu (10.04) it is there .
$apt-cache search sanskrit returns following packages
latex-sanskrit - pre-processor and fonts to typeset Sanskrit in TeX
texlive-lang-indic - TeX Live: Indic scripts
ttf-devanagari-fonts - Free TrueType fonts for languages using the
Devanagari script
ttf-tmuni - font for Tibetan, Dzongkha and Ladakhi (OpenType Unicode)
itrans - Converts romanized Indic texts to LaTeX, HTML & Postscript
itrans-fonts - Extra fonts used in the ITRANS Indic text processing system
ttf-linex - Fonts suitable for education and institutional use
language-pack-gnome-sa - GNOME translation updates for language Sanskrit
language-pack-gnome-sa-base - GNOME translations for language Sanskrit
language-pack-sa - translation updates for language Sanskrit
language-pack-sa-base - translations for language Sanskrit

But it is not there in Fedora

The folks who work on i18n for Fedora have a channel (#fedora-i18n I
think) and a mailing list. I'd request you to pop the query on those.

To take nothing away from the effort you are putting in but can we
tone down the gross generalizations and unsubtle ad-hominems please ?
A few officers and bureaucrats do not make a government and for
someone who wants to publish things generalizations are a bit of a
stretch.

This isn't specific to you, I've noticed this from the recent posts
here as well as on the Mumbai LUG lists.

Hi,
I think, this may be stupid question.
If not so, tell me
whether we can detect when file was saved (any files ext., using any
editor) . like
an event (on save callback).
for using that in shell script.
Like I need to run that script when any file was saved.

Thanks in advance.

It is not a vicious personal attack. It is the truth. It is an
undisputed fact that infosys has contributed little or nothing of value
to the Indian software scene. The mode of operation of people like NN
has been to exploit cheap local labour for the benefit of developed
countries. The are not capable of innovating on their own, and when such
people are put in charge of projects like this, they are clueless and
just email Redmond for instructions as they have been doing their whole
lives. (btw the quotation above is not mine)

And you also have:

https://developer.uidai.gov.in
https://developer.uidai.gov.in/site/documents
https://developer.uidai.gov.in/site/downloads

The middleware is implemented using AMQP, which is an open standard
(using RabbitMQ). AFAICT, the servers are going to be linux based.
Google for "linux site:uidai.gov.in" without the quotes. Given all of
the above, you ought to be able to write your own client too.

inotify is the key. You can register for inotify event whenever a file or
folder is modified. When that event occurs do whatever you want.

Actually, the Indian Software Success is more of Currency devaluation, 
than Skill.  NOT just out of skill alone.    Suppose, if the dollar is 
just 10 rs, how many of our people be able to compete with an american 
s/w guy?

I agree with swapnil, that we have to call a spade, a spade.

Most of indian software companies are just service providers.  They dont 
have any experience in designing a product, and making it success.  The 
reason, is that in order to develop a product, one has to own it.  The 
leader should have indepth idea of the product.  Bill Gates, Steve Jobs 
all are technological entrepreneur.  They knew the technology, and hence 
they have an ownership, vision for their product.

But how many leaders in the indian software companies, have that kind of 
vision?  They are just body shoppers, utilising the vast business around 
the currency difference.  They dont have any experience, in designing a 
product or application, for their own requirement.  Then how can they 
design a software for our country?

Atleast for the foreign clients, the clients are the decision makers in 
what requirements they want.  Here, our government is NOT such a 
decision maker or authority.   Everything is left to the software 
companies, which they neither have any experience nor any vision.

Senthil

Even though I agree with you, We cannot deny the fact that they employ a 
lot of people which means, a lot of people get exposure to the outside 
world and they join the organized sector of the society. I have seen 
people with a science degree doing sales or driving taxi or something 
similar in the unorganized sector. But, Joining a large corporation 
changes their lifestyle, in general, for the better.

Just my 2 cents.

Hi All
Why can't we say "Use FOSS for UID else we won't register for AADHAAR";
instead of sending letters to authorities.
UID is a hot topic and anti -UID campaigns are there too.
Even if you sent 1000000000000K letters Govt. does not seems to respond to
this.

Hi,

Let us not deviate from the UID Project to NN :) We need to collect
the facts, share it with other ILUG group and fine-tune. Finally
create the Wikipedia page. Otherwise, No use of spending time on this
discussion. Once facts are collected, as Raman suggested, we need to
fill RTI on specific topic. It is not a simple process and may take
few months.

Bye :)

sure, but if some other country offers the same service a few cents
cheaper, all these people will be lucky to get jobs *cleaning* taxis.

the more fundamental issues are:

1. UID is an assault on freedom, and anyway
2. it is impossible to implement
3. a lot of people are making a lot of money on this futile exercise at
our expense.

Totally, I feel like being tagged just so that the govt can keep track 
of its cows and have every one of them milked to a greater extent.

Subject: [ILUG-BOM] A personal appeal from Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales
I know every one might have read this since it's in wikipedia.So it's a
gentle reminder to all who hasn't contributed yet.

"Google might have close to a million servers. Yahoo has something like
13,000 staff. We have 679 servers and 95 staff.

Wikipedia is the #5 site on the web and serves 450 million different people
every month ? with billions of page views.

Commerce is fine. Advertising is not evil. But it doesn't belong here. Not
in Wikipedia.

Wikipedia is something special. It is like a library or a public park. It
is like a temple for the mind. It is a place we can all go to think, to
learn, to share our knowledge with others.

When I founded Wikipedia, I could have made it into a for-profit company
with advertising banners, but I decided to do something different. We?ve
worked hard over the years to keep it lean and tight. We fulfill our
mission, and leave waste to others.

If everyone reading this donated ?100, we would only have to fundraise for
one day a year. But not everyone can or will donate. And that's fine. Each
year just enough people decide to give.

This year, please consider making a donation of ?100, ?200, ?300 or
whatever you can to protect and sustain Wikipedia.

Thanks,

*Jimmy Wales*
Wikipedia Founder

Can you specify the name of the softwares, that you checked, which have 
30 days trial ? It will help in understanding your requirement better.

This year INR support is newly added, above link / any banner from Indian
IP will lead to landing page with INR currency. There *may* be few hiccups,
but people are working on it to make it better and netbanking support may
come soon as well.

I know there are several components in this UID project. I know for
sure the bio metric matching compoent (the software) is run in linux
and i have seen the documents that are given to vendors bidding for
bio metric matching component and it clearly states that the software
apart from having a windows component should work in Linux. I have
seen it clearly mentioning ubuntu in which software should work for it
to qualify to the bidding process. I have seen the biometric software
development process was happening in RHEL and in part C/C++ and in
part java code. This is no one or two servers these matching software
will run, but in a cluster of hundred or so servers. So you need a
data center to run this not one or two servers.

Or use graphviz (or more specifically dotty):

In one of the articles, there were several datacenters mentioned. So, I 
can imagine the number of servers that might be required. And, When you 
mention the biometric software development process is happening in RHEL, 
do you know whether the matching technology is proprietary or something 
in house ?

Also, many of us in the list have noticed MSSQL being used on the client 
side. Do you know of any link between how the exported data from MSSQL 
is fed into the store where the biometric data is kept ? And, the 
biggest question of all, where/how do they store this highly sensitive 
biometric data ? Do they store the digest of our finger prints or the 
actual finger print data ? because I think the latter would infringe on 
an individual's privacy.

It will be helpful, if you can share your thoughts on the above questions.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] Ajax and jQuery
Message-ID: <CALDskyxVC8rFrtig_3QzQfnPmyw5FWoVKt0CEGQmsAMCGreLQA@mail.gmail.com>

jQuery and Ajax are both topics that need some experience and thinking.

Not something that can be covered in a tip or e-mail.

But still we will try.

jQuery we have already seen. And also Ajax in the previous tip.

But today we will see it another time in bit more detail.

Ajax is nothing but old wine in new bottle, CGI in a new incarnation with
 javascript. Our javascript library of choice is jQuery.

It is quite painful to do js programming directly.

Now that we are talking about javascript I have to mention something.

Javascript is not java.

It is a fantastic programming language; a language that has the magic of C
 with the convenience of perl and the elegance of python.

Okay enough evangelism.

It will take time for you to learn this since javascript works in
tandem with the DOM model we saw,
 and we need to learn jQuery alongside and HTML and CGI. So it is
attacking multiple problems
 at the same time. It is a little difficult but doable.

Let us look at one more example with which we can make a CGI call from
a jQuery code segment in
 a html file.

$ cat sample.html
<html>
<head>
   <script src="jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
   <script type="text/javascript">
   $(function() {
          $('#ajax').load('/cgi-bin/testcgi');
   })
   </script>
</head>
<body>
       <div id='ajax' > </div>
</body>
</html>

Now let us look at the file /cgi-bin/testcgi

$ cat /var/www/cgi-bin/testcgi
#!/usr/bin/perl
use CGI;
$q = new CGI;
print $q->header;

print $q->start_html;
print "Printing from CGI";

$out = `ls /etc/`;

print "<pre>$out</pre>";

print $q->end_html;

Now you can see that you can load any portion of a web page with CGI
content using
 Ajax and jQuery.

But before that you should validate the CGI script independently.

And you can read up about how jQuery provides seamless Ajax
functionality using 3 functions.

$.get()

$.ajax()

and

$('selector).load();

That takes us deep into the jQuery world.

But suffice it to say that Ajax makes life really easy due to the
power of javascript and jQuery genius.

Now you might be able to guess how banking and other sites like
irctc.co.in run executable code and
 present in a web page seamlessly.

Javascript is also very useful for client side validations and several
things that need not be executed in the
 web server.

I have done a small script called Ubuntu Offline Updater available at "
https://sourceforge.net/projects/ubuoffupdater/". It is some simple shell
script with which people can update any Ubuntu system without having a
direct internet connection. I created this for my own personal use as I did
not have an internet connection in my system. I used my college system to
get all the packages and install them in my system using this script. I
have not made a marvelous improvement to this as this was for my personal
use. If people are interested I am ready to spend some more time on this.
If there is enough need I will try to add GUI (after moving to python).

I have put this here just to let people know that there is some way to
update your Ubuntu system without having a internet connection.

Please Sign:

The text of the petition is
____________________

STOP SHIFT TOWARDS CLOSED SOURCE PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE IN E-GOVERNANCE
AND EDUCATION, AND DECLARE A PRO-FOSS POLICY

Target: Department of IT, Government of West Bengal
Region: India

Background (Preamble):

We, the members of the Kolkata Chapter of the Indian GNU/Linux user
group (http://www.ilug-cal.info ), Free Software Mancha of West Bengal
(http://www.fsmwb.org ) and FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)
activists across the country have been observing a marked shift
towards the adoption of closed source proprietary software by the
present Government of West Bengal. This is a retrograde trend that is
bound to adversely affect earlier efforts towards adoption of FOSS in
e-Governance (at least in some sectors), Education and other sectors
by the previous Government and any concept of freedom that the people
at large of the state may entertain from foreign interest laden
proprietary closed source software.


A case in point is the happenings at WBPCB, where in-house personnel
for FOSS deployment were appointed by the previous Government. The
strategy permitted the best quality solutions at least TCO and with
the benefits of maximum security and transparency. The recent tender
at the WBPCB site (http://www.wbpcb.gov.in/cgi-bin/notice.cgi  for
purchasing closed source proprietary software ) reeks of corruption,
kickbacks and nepotism by the new players. Of course it is ages away
from vendor neutrality or open standards. Similar actions have
happened in other departments as well.


Further the present Govt has signed MOUs with Microsoft according to
which the company will invest in Bengal if the Government of West
Bengal vetos the use of Microsoft's cloud platform and technology for
future e-governance projects. (Source: Business Standard ). We are
extremely concerned about an e-governance policy influenced by
proprietary software vendor like Microsoft, Oracle etc. . It took a
lot of effort by many of us to convince sections of the the previous
Government about the evils of proprietary software and finally they
agreed to change their pro Microsoft stand and support use of free and
open source software in e-governance projects to an extent (given the
restrictions imposed by the Central Government). There are several
examples of sustainable e-governance implementations like EMIS.


The technical superiority of free and open source software are proven
. All Internet giants Amazon, Facebook, Google , Twitter and Yahoo
uses free software to run their application and infrastructure. In
Microsoft's own land the Obama administration is going for Free
software as the means of delivering e-governance.


Government departments are known to be the largest consumer of
software and a short-sighted policy of the kind is bound to have
serious adverse effects beyond the wastage of tax payers money.


It is also never too late to make amends. The recent happenings in the
state of Tamil Nadu, as per this
http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/cities/chennai/boss-shut-out-windows-247report,
should be suggestive of the same.

Petition:

We demand that the Government


   1. Declare and implement a FOSS policy at least along the lines of
the policy adopted in Kerala and certainly beyond the minimal policy
lines in the Central Govt policy.


   2. Try to understand the concept of 'vendor neutrality and open
standards' and follow it in all dealings. All e-Governance projects
should be built on top of open platform following open standards .None
of taxpayer's money should be spent in buying software licenses and
bringing vendor lock-ins and a host of evils in public services.


   3. Revive bodies like WB-IOTA (that have not been witnessing much
activity since the formation of the present Govt) and also form
similar bodies for overseeing the adoption of FOSS in all spheres of
activity.

Windows 3? Are we reading that right? or did you mean Gnome 3?
Which Linux distribution are you using?


(BTW, what does 'inside' Linux mean?)

Try it after disabling all Firefox extensions and plugins you have. If
that solves the issue, re-enable the extensions and plugins one by one
and test it again till you eventually identify the extension/plugin
that causes the problem. If you experience the issue even with no
extensions/plugins enabled, then perhaps, a complete uninstall and
re-install might help.

Message-ID: <CACm7z1YTT-VmtX3j_JCNzY_uDHM-p7cSYHjxpvx9c2krW5i4Ww@mail.gmail.com>

Dear folks,

I have my HP PAVILION dm4 series laptop running Ubuntu 11.10 and Windows 7
as dual boot.
Since ubuntu 11.10 i experience the problem of power consumption heavily
and was surfing for a solution for it.
I read a suggestion for power consumption problem for modern kernels in OMG
UBUNTU site and made the following change grub file.

Adding pcie_aspm = force to my grub file made my battery to fail soon after
3-4 weeks i made change in it and from today morning i am getting the
problem of overheating in my HP Pavilion Dm4 model laptop. What could be
the reason for this. When i boot into windows and check battery status it
says ("Consider Changing your battery") and overheating continues in
Windows too... This is really a serious problem now with modern kernels.
Any solutions? or suggestions?

Message-ID: <CAFum4PmXwOgetc+nu+KeU=JEPKxQcZbSy95nutncx82dtVCf5w@mail.gmail.com>

Saw this in /.

"Yesterday the Dutch government took a step to further improve the
adoption of Open Source in its ranks. It has officialy approved a
modified version of the open source VPN software OpenVPN for use on
the governmental level 'Departementaal Vertrouwelijk' (Restricted).
The release is called OpenVPN-NL and is fully open-source and
available for use. The software has undergone a security evaluation by
the Dutch government's national communications security agency
(NLNCSA). The major change is the removal of OpenSSL as the
cryptographic core of OpenVPN-NL. Instead, the Dutch government opted
to include the smaller, better readable and documented open source
library PolarSSL to provide the cryptographic and SSL/TLS
functionality. The Dutch IT Security company Fox-IT worked together
with both OpenVPN and PolarSSL communities and modified the stock
software to support the government evaluation process. In total 8000
lines of code and 4000 lines of documentation were checked in to the
OpenVPN trunk."

Good thing for open source.

Instead of using pcie_aspm=force you can upgrade to latest kernel (git) as
patches to solve this pcie power management solution is added there. You

I think you are saying about ubuntu 10.10, You can use virtualbox to
install windows inside ubuntu or you can dual boot your machine with
windows and ubuntu. Tell which one you need so that people can help
you.

I have already checked this link. But a particular line in this link says
http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTYwNA
" There's just too many hardware devices that don't properly support the
ASPM power-saving modes." and i think mine is one of them. So added this
line caused my hardware to struck with overheating.

Message-ID: <CALDskyy=6kcT70fPJUaFxJTQPaeDr9Yi=6fzYOnxcCETUE2Xhw@mail.gmail.com>

jQuery allows very easy integration with plugins or libraries.

jQuery is the library. And plugins are built with jQuery being the
 least common denominator.

The way to include a plugin in a web page is quite simple.

<script src='jquery.js' type='text/javascript' > </script>
<script src='jquery.cycle.js' type='text/javascript'> </script>
..rest of js code

This is the way to include the jQuery cycle plugin.

http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/

There are plenty of such very high quality plugins. More than a year ago I
 had sent a post to LUG about the imgareaselect plugin.

There are plenty of such amazing features built on top of jQuery.

Please play with it.

We will close this topic soon and move to the next.

You need to understand the provider pool and the way the decision was taken.

The State Govt was prevented from adopting FOSS in various sectors
through constraints imposed by the Central Govt. The few lines about
FOSS were never understood by the Central ministers.
So only some departments could be shifted to FOSS. On key sectors, the
Central Govt basically said "If you do not follow OUR specs, then you
will NOT be funded". In school education, the hilarious situation at
one stage was 'a huge load of PCs were sent with no funds for
training". So our concept of "Community based initiatives" became all
the more important.

The previous Govt's strategy was to build the necessary FOSS manpower
through initiatives in the education sector and training of personnel.
 A lot has been done. But the present Govt has zero vision and evil
priorities.

The present Govt has also modified the software specs of machines to
be used in schools towards closed source s/w. Ubuntu was compulsory (I
will provide the link later).

For this you can install vmware and then Ubuntu in Vmware.
http://downloads.vmware.com/

its very simple and easy to install in vmware.
You can also alternatively Install Ubuntu as your primary OS and then
windows inside virtualbox in it.
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads

Hope that helps you.

Commonist[1] is a Free Software for the same which is widely popular, there
are other tools / solutions too. Some amount of search on commons / google
might help / you could build your own since mediawiki api is just out there.

I made a fresh install of Fedora 16 replacing Ubuntu 11.10 and now i do not
have overheating problem but due to my battery being affected because of
above problem mentioned i think i should consider changing battery and even
Fedora 16 runs on kernel 3.1 so this also consumes power but at a rate less
than Ubuntu. Hoping for some patches and fixes in kernel 3.2.

This issue has been fixed for latest kernel, though it doesn't make it for
3.2.

To: <mailinglist at ilug-cochin.org>


Unhide is a forensic tool to find processes and TCP/UDP ports hidden by
rootkits, Linux kernel modules or by other techniques. It includes two
utilities: unhide and unhide-tcp.

unhide detects hidden processes using three techniques:
* comparing the output of /proc and /bin/ps
* comparing the information gathered from /bin/ps with the one gathered
from
system calls (syscall scanning)
* full scan of the process ID space (PIDs bruteforcing)

unhide-tcp identifies TCP/UDP ports that are listening but are not listed
in /bin/netstat through brute forcing of all TCP/UDP ports available.

This package can be used by rkhunter in its daily scans.

As for consulting free lancers and small IT consulting firms, there
are quite few that promote and use FOSS stack in their solutions.

I echo Sankarshan's question.  Please define what would qualify for

Has anyone tried Vista (deployed across US Veteran's hospital) or
other variants like OpenVista etc of it in this list?

It uses a very mature lightening fast database known as GT.M .

Well just an idea...

Subject: [Ilugc] edubuntu thin-client hardware recommendations
Message-ID: <CABko9NKSTZuicXGjXG7Z6fruhJv=T3MAcuVt_DXWiaSJ8hNOBQ@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

I'm setting up a free software / open source training center in Trichy,
Tamil nadu. I'm looking for suitable hardware that is perfectly a
thin-client. I expect to purchase about 15 such thin clients.

My requirements / problem-statements are:

1. No fans, no excessive cooling requirements  - overall be low on power
consumption
2. super small form factor (preferably the ITX line); should be portable in
bulk. (should be able to transport 15 of these in a car)
3. gigabit network support
4. no local storage (ie., no HDD / CD-ROM / etc., bulky/noisy/power-hungry
stuff)
5. USB / SD / CF types external storage support
6. preferably works out-of-the-box with edubuntu / LTSP (ie., i'd rather be
doing business than flashing ROMs or hand-configuring PXE)

>From what I've looked around, there are cheap second-hand real-PCs (not
thin-clients) that come for about Rs.4k (with hard-disk). Sun's Sunray,
HP's and even LTSP's thin clients are way above my budget (works out to
Rs.8K or more for the most basic model without considering import duties).
Although, they are the only ones that do not need a fan and come with an
intel atom / Via C7 like minimal CPU. I see a couple of local sellers, but
that is exactly the reason I write to you :)

If given no choice, I'd choose the older PCs at 4K which would run at a
higher operating cost (higher power bills, higher cooling bills). But
that's atleast a safer bet, unless you have recommendations on local
thin-client sellers/assemblers. narrating your edubuntu experience will
also be very useful here.

Your suggestions?

In my experience Thin clients are costly not only to purchase but also to maintain as the special design makes it difficult for others to repair. It is really cheap and convenient to use regular pc's.

Message-ID: <CACm7z1Z06rqhRKEp=HHxKwKGho=Zs=UgkiwCre0-U21urySa5A@mail.gmail.com>

The openSUSE 12.1 has been
released<http://news.opensuse.org/2011/11/16/opensuse-12-1-all-green/>on
Wednesday the 16th of November 2011.

PuduvaiLUG thanks and wishes Mr. A.Karthikeyan who wrote this review about
OpenSuse.

*New to opensuse?*

OpenSuse is one of the most stable distro I have ever seen. Trust me, I
have started linuxing with Ubuntu like many others and get crashed my
system while trying up something new. But in this case everything is much
stable.

Well, there are plenty of reason why I adore (open)SUSE. Of course, its
open-source.

*Version Number*

With a bunch of new features and elegant performance improvement this new
version is numbered as directly .1 rather .0, because .0 would create many
expectations of major improvements.

*Desktop Environment*

This time openSUSE12.1 has shipped with KDE-plasma4.7 workspace and

Just a suggestion about something I saw a while back:

http://health.gnu.org/

Also, for evaluation purposes you could ask the person you contract to take a 
look any of these for integration:

I met the management folks of Hospital OS projects about a couple of
months ago. Originated in Thailand. They have been around for 10 years
and offer support. They also seem to have a couple of hospitals in
India using it.

yes seen that too , no matter what you choose do factor in customization

Hi All,

If anyone is looking to contribute to open source and looking for an idea,
here is one.

rApache is  is a project supporting web application development using the R
statistical language and Apache web server. There is no official binary for
linux/mac/windows at the moment. You can only install rApache by compiling
it from source.

If you are interested you can create binaries for linux and work
 with jeff.horner at vanderbilt dot edu to make them official binaries. You
can find more details at http://rapache.net/manual.html

You have not mentioned which Debian-based distribution you're using.

If you are using Ubuntu, 'vlc' package is present in the universe
section of the repository. In Ubuntu 9.04 and later, universe
repository is enabled by default[1]. So the problem could be that you
didn't run 'apt-get update' before running 'apt-get install vlc'. Try
that and let us know if your problem still persites

      May be because you are new to GNU/Linux, I would suggest you
start with the GUI tools first. You should most probably have
synaptic, or at least Ubuntu Software Manager if it is Ubuntu. You
will find that in System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager on
a normal gnome 2.x desktop. You can search for the software you need
from synaptic.

      But going forward, you can gradually learn how apt/aptitude
works and then start using it. If you find anything difficult or
intimidating, please feel free to ask. But before that, try to search
for a solution in the Internet. Finding solution ourself without too
much help from others is a great joy in itself :) Enjoy your
GNU/Linux. Thanks

It looks you are using a debian based operating system.

1. If you are in Ubuntu Open " Ubuntu Software Center" and search for VLC
and install it by clicking the install button.

2. If you are using LinuxMint then you can install it via "Software
Manager" and the same way search for VLC in it and install by just simply
clicking the install button.

3. Or else try this from terminal:
sudo apt-get install vlc vlc-plugin-pulse mozilla-plugin-vlc

If none of them shows up then you need to update your system via "Update
Manager" so that the Software Database (local repository) will also be
update and you can try any one of the above 3 methods :-)

initial comments:
... the authors are definitely biased,
vendor lock-in is not properly considered.
Does not analyse implementation models from the perspective of licenses.
The blanket term 'open source' is used.
Some remarks like those on 'functionality' are wild and unjustified .
