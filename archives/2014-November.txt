Ubuntu finalise their cloud stack as announced by Mark Shuttleworth:
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/10/28/caonical_build_it_yourself_cloud/

Some of our team have been involved in providing the enterprise java 
expertise into their orchestration program.
https://jujucharms.com/~jhasaurabh/trusty/wildfly-ha-master-0/#readme

CI integration being added currently, so this will become a point and 
click way to autodeploy and autoscale your java enterprise application for
both developers and their customers!

Linux is like an extended family, often bickering and having our own 
opinions, but coming together when it counts :)

Don't know what are they up to their sleeves or what they want to prove?

It looks like they got something.

Just wait, watch and observe.

One of the hops, that your packets are bounced on, will be owned by
the NSA and  only the 'Five Eyes' countries will have access to it now
:-)

On the positive side, you can use it to avoid bullying in the name of
IT act even for innocuous posts by the Indian police / govt.

Sorry sir, please explain. I didn't get you. BTW, which are those 'Five

Yes, we can use it to avoid IT act issues. But, I used FB on tor and its a
irritating process. Hope, now it won't be an issue but fb will still keep
log on you. (I may be wrong)

I wouldn't be too certain, check your exit node first ;)

Better still, use selektor and choose a node very far away from you!

I am sure you can find more sellers too.
I used to buy other stuff from these guys a while back and they were good
and also knew what they were selling.

These guys are also good:

Subject: [Ilugc] [Project Idea] Desktop background changer with Free
	software philosophy
Message-ID: <CAN5jxNaYFGMmiApub4gwwDFB6O43HcUiBeDPrSYpOFTbwJWxvg@mail.gmail.com>

Guys,

I got this idea when puduvailug came up with idea for naming machines with
"Free Software activists, Privacy enthusiasts & Scientists"
Link:
http://puduvaiglug.wordpress.com/2014/10/11/edubuntu-in-girls-government-high-school/

I have seen desktop background changer app in *Ubuntu* ( automatically ).
It has feature "Picture of the day". That will fetch some random image from
wikipedia. App name is *Wallch* ( code:
https://code.launchpad.net/~wallch/wallpaper-changer/trunk ). It is
available in software center.

Idea is to add plugin to that.

Step1: There must be service (auto or manually) which will create photo of
free activist with description about him. It will be an web service.

Like below. Instead of quotes we will have description about him.
http://www.rugusavay.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Richard-Stallman-Quotes-5.jpg

Step2: We need to create plugin in Wallch, which will pick random image
from our web service ( like it doing for Wikipedia ).

We may need to join Wallch mailing list for their help.

So whenever I started my system. we will daily show one activist in his
desktop. It might help us to understand free software philosophy.

This can be done easily by installing wallch. You don't need to collect
those photos and have it in system. You need to just select that option
"One day One Hero"

Linux users or (Open source or free software enthusiast) may enjoy this.

Suggestions are welcome. Or if this is already implemented, please share
the link.

If not,

Can anyone do this as a open source project?

Thanks.

Does it accept INR and ship from within India?  The shipment and
customs cost can be a significant price offset.

I haven't personally shipped from them, but it's free shipping and you get
a tracking code if it's above 20$ or something. I know some Indian folks
who have shipped from there though.

DX.COM shipping is free to India even if you buy an item for $0.99 But you
need to be patient as it comes via regular post. I have ordered 3 times and
I have received the items in about 20-30 days. No customs duty was charged.
It was just delivered by a post man. Typically since it comes via post, I
think the regular customs allowance (35k?) is followed.

The 35K allowance is for travellers and does not apply to shipments.
I have been levied customs on $100 shipments.

Hello,

I have created a user (say 'hruser') and assigned "Manager" permission to
Human Resource module in OpenERP. But the user can not see any of the leave
details of the employees. But I could see employees leave details after
login as administrator.

The hruser is a member of the Human Resource manager group and is the
member of the same company where other user resides.

 I couldn't post this question in the openerp forum because when I request
for password reset their server shows "The server encountered an internal
error and was unable to complete your request. Either the server is
overloaded or there is an error in the application". Anyway I will post in
their forum later. I am seeking help from the OpenERP experienced users in
this mailing list.

Talk - 1.


Topic ?:?

Workflows with Tmux

Description ?:?

Tmux, or Terminal MUltipleXer is a really sleek way to make your 
terminal do a LOT more things that you thought it could. It manages 
windows and panes like a BOSS. I usually work on a bunch of things - 
some work related stuff, some open source projects, some side projecty 
stuff, writing a blog post, etc. And all these things require my screen 
to be in some format. One of the greatest things about tmux is its 
ability to manage sessions. You can create a session and make your 
splits in one fashion and when you are done with the work for that point 
in time, you can detatch from that session and leave it right that way. 
When you want to get back to it you can just pick up where you left off.

The true power of Tmux however lies in applying this session management 
when you are working on remote boxes. Imagine working at home on a 
remote box, closing your laptop, travelling to work and picking up 
*right* where you left off. In addition, pair programming becomes an 
ease with Tmux. It is super simple and it just works. Thats the beauty 
behind it. In this session, I will try to explain some of the concepts 
of Tmux that I have learnt in the past few weeks of using Tmux (Note: 
I'm still a beginner) and the way I use it. I will also demonstrate its 
power in remote machines and how to use it to pair program.

Links ?:?

Don't have recordings of any previous talks. But you can find my previous
presentation slides over at http://speakerdeck.com/shrayasr

Duration ?:? 30-45 mins

About Yourself ?:?

My name is Shrayas. I previously worked at SAP Labs Bangalore and now I 
work with my father at Logic Soft Pvt. Ltd. helping to explore new 
verticals and do new things. I love open source and the whole idea 
behind F/OSS and have tried my best to contribute where ever I can to 
them. I do most of my work in terminals with my trusty VIM and Tmux. I 
currently am exploring Pythonand C# at work and side projects. Also I am 
slowly trying to use FP languages like clojure and racket/scheme where 
ever I can (though I'm horrible at it :D) Otherwise, I am basically from 
the streets of Mylapore, Chennai. Did my B.Sc from Loyola (any loyolites 
here?) and my MS during my tenure at SAP.

Any ideas on how I can tackle this?

The installation is a vanilla 14.04 ubuntu running the openbox window

Vim is working fine on my system with same OS version. Remove it and
install it again. Hope it helps or resolve the issue.
Do give it a try and share again.

- Check if the problem exists, then one of the plugin you are using either
has a dependency problem or not configured properly

I have t_co set[1] and i'm pretty sure $TERM is xterm-256color. I will
check and report back on these when I get home.

Will check this as well. AFAIK I don't think it is a plugin issue, but
let me check.

In addition @Sahil pinged me these[2][3] links as well. Will check them out too.

Thanks guys!

Thank you all for your valuable suggestions.

But I see Raspberry A+ has been released  now and they sell it for $20 !!
It appears to be a sequel to Raspberry A.

	every running application disappears
Message-ID: <CAP6xenm0TXkJJqDQFbFJ0FaV872EgdvLrbTqFy-3BRSpL958MA@mail.gmail.com>

Namaste All,

Recently, I turned to Xfce4 from unity desktop environment. And, it was
good (though not up to the mark) but working fine with my old machine.

Few days back, I experienced the same problem as I faced today which let me
to explore what is it happening with xfce4. And, the issue is:

I was working smoothly but all of sudden every opened window (like:
Firefox, Chrome, gedit, Window Manager, Rhythmbox etc.) got disappear
somewhere and I am not able to access anyone of those. But, when I do <top>
command or <ps -aux | grep gedit> then I am getting the specific <pid> but
it doesn't have <pts/x>.

On that I am getting <??>

What exactly is this? I searched my level best but failed to find a
suitable solution for my issue. Are there any specific links which help me
to recover my all working windows once again?

Songs are being played in Rhythmbox (while writing this mail). I have some
content in gedit which is not saved and I need that. With the rest I can
compromise (session would be restored in Chrome and Firefox). But can't in
gedit.

Now, putting my laptop on suspend mode (sudo pm-suspend). Don't want to
loose my unsaved content which is being written in gedit.

Are there any ways to bring the running application to front by having its
<pid>?
I googled but failed to get. Still searching but in the mean time please
guide me.

Thank you.

Dear all,

We had our ILUGC monthly meet this Saturday(08-11-2014).

Around 20 people attended this meet.

Shrayas gave a good talk and demo on Tmux

Then we had  Shakthi Kannan talking about calculator in Emacs.

I gave a demo about data acquistion by arduino and then ganesh demo 
about Accelerometer sensor.

As some of us came late so the first session was redone by Shrayas.

We had a  nice discussion in canteen.


We thank the speakers and people for your valuable time.

To: mailinglist at fsftn.org


Hi,

https://gnome.org/groupon/

I have been using GNOME for almost all of my computing years, and even till
now. I am sure most of you would also be using GNOME or used GNOME for
quite long.

This news was shocking, outrageous and sad to me and will be for you too.
Never expected such a community will be under a threat from vile companies.

Please raise your concern, voice against this and SAVE GNOME.

Regards
Vysakh

We have connected Agere Systems, Inc. (Lucent) Systems Soft Modem in a
Ubuntu machine with our Land line telephone line. We are able to see the
modem in the list of lsusb command.

But we are not able to read the input from the port using any languages.

Post output of /bin/dmesg after you connect the modem. Use a service
like fpaste.org or gist.github.com.

Which version of Ubuntu do you use?

Hi,

In the dmesg, you can see "bad CDC description" message. I guess that can
give us a clue as to where is the problem.

I did a search and found the below alrticle, please go through it and see
if that help you any way :)

Some good news here. They decided to drop their trademark application

This sounds *really* exciting.

Also for a company like us, who uses the .NET stack majorly.. I'm
really really excited about this!

Hi,

I am Suthan Amaresan. I work at Dr.Sivanthi Aditanar College of engineering
as Head of Department , Department of Computer Applications. Sorry for the
very late reply. I am interested to deliver the guest lecture at your
college, if it has not been done already. But i am no way an expert. I
started learning python 10 months ago and waited till i delivered a lecture
internally. I have delivered one lecture internally to our computer science
students and have got good response. I hope i will be able to satisfy your
requirements. But if you need an expert i am not the one for you. If you
are ok with me, do reply. I will share my contact number to you and we can
plan one during next semester.

That should never happen - unless you have repos installed but keys missing.

In your repo config do you have a gpgkey entry?

If so - is there a key file at that path?

Install Webmin and off you go...

If you want to access the server from another system, remember to open
the necessary ports to access (defaullt is 10000)

Dear all,

I work for an NGO based in the Nilgiris, Keystone Foundation. We have a 
small LAN in our office where we use Windows Server 2003 for managing 
users, rights and sharing files. The Windows Server assigns IP to all 
the users. We have a separate ClearOS firewall for internet protection.

As we have a mix of clients (Windows 7, XP, OSX, Linux, Android) we find 
that the Server OS needs updating. Being a long time FOSS user on the 
desktop, I am interested in switching over to a GNU/Linux server. 
However I have no experience with servers. I have googled a bit and 
installed Ubuntu server 14.04, but I am not able to find time to do the 
required trial and error.

Can you please suggest how we could go about doing the migration? Do you 
know any group/person that can set this up and provide support to us?

Looking forward to your inputs.

Hi,

The keywords "install linux remote system" in google.com gave me tons of
pages.

Why don't you try the same before asking here?

First try yourself, learn something and when your struck up come here and
ask specific questions with details.

This is important because when you go through the process of learning
something, you end up learning so much more than when someone just
tells you what to do. The struggle that you go through to figure
things out will teach you more about how to search for things
specifically, key terms to search by and give you more contextual
information around your topic of search, etc.

I am personally really interested in the work you are doing, 
particularly around livelihood
and environmental governance (I have set up a small community farm in 
the UK).

Considering the good work you are doing, we would be prepared to offer 
you help and support
from certified engineers free of cost.

Let me know if this is of interest?

We can use this list for commercial activities too.

A person asks for commercial support for his office.
Another person is willing to give commercial support.
(here, vikas agreed for free).

What else be a great purpose of our list other than this ?

Hi

I am planning to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (dual boot) in my Dell Inspiron
17 Laptop. It has Windows 7 professional 64 bit OEM version. The processor
is Intel core i5 3337U 1.8 GHz which supports 64 bit instruction set. I
would like to know which desktop image PC (intel 386) or 64 bit PC (AMD 64)
I should download and use. Will this Intel processor support 64 bit Ubuntu?
I shall be thankful, if someone clarify my doubt.

Since your laptop runs the 64-bit version of Windows just fine, it
should run the amd64 version of Ubuntu just fine. In case you were
confused by the name "amd64" and wondered if it will run on Intel
processors, [1] should give you more clarity on the topic.

Hope this helps.

Is there any organization that gives commercial support for GNU/Linux desktops?

Like installing GNU/Linux on desktops, configuring printers/scanners,
network login, backup, etc.

They need to give phone support for any emergency and in person/on
spot support too.

Thanks.

We do all of this except for the on site element.

If anyone on the list wants to consider working with us perhaps we can 
satisfy the enquiry?

Finally got around to reading this. Thanks a lot for the explanation :)

I'm seeing a somewhat gradual decline in all things debian also.
Another thing probably to note is one of the core developers of I
think the debian installer - Joey Hess, just quit the project and
moved on as well.

I'm interested to see where this will end up. Maybe someone can talk
about this and related problems in the next ILUGC meet

?Isn't the systemd controversy almost over now? Most major distros have
adopted it.

Four people in Debian resigned over the last two weeks from various
duties. Including Ian jackson, the man leading the case against
systemd.

This ended yesterday, the debian developers overwhelmingly support systemd.
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2014/11/msg00891.html

A lot of distros switched to debian, ARCH did it long back, debian
made long and careful evaluation of alternatives and is switching.
Ubuntu also announced it will switch to systemd as soon as debian made
its choice.

Most of the people bashing systemd are people with very little
technical information about the project.

       Not really. We do need it because there are more and more people
using GNU/Linux resulting in more targetted attacks. And, I see a dangerous
trend of people adding their normal login to sudoers with ALL privileges.
So, when novice to moderate users are involved, it is useful to have such

Yeah, agree - sorry, my question above was an attempt at sarcasm ;)

I think we all need protection from the malware that detekt is offering 
to provide.

Especially considering that even reading Linux Journal probably gets you 
on a watch list

Being on this mailing list probably gets you on a watch list too...

I'll post my findings after scanning my own systems :)

I see. Would be nice if someone could wrap this up neatly and give a

Nonsense!! It has its own design flaw. I'm against everything pid-1
crap!! and merging udev with systemd is pure political just to make life
difficult for non systemd init systems.

But it doesn't mean it is not on par with other init systems. Infact, it
is the best when it comes to non-blocking parallel startup. upstart or
openrc can't compete with it. Then, there is systemd-nspawn which is one
hell of a replacement for any chroot implementation. It uses everything
kernel offers (pid namespaces, networking namespaces, cgroups) to make a
os level virtualization.

Supporting multiple init systems for every upper layer components (GUI
Environments) is not just an easy task. Thats what debian package
maintainers would have felt and thats why they would have voted for
systemd.

People just hate systemd because it does what a init system doesn't need
to do, like producing binary logs instead of text, not allowing your OS
to produce coredumps by default (I know how freebsd guy will say
"Seriously!!?? don't touch my /etc/rc.local or I'll kill you!!")

Thanks,
Mohan R

It seems you are on the road to became a Project Manager (If you are not

This is exactly what I was talking about when I said most people
bashing it have very little technical information about the project.
First of all, not everything is pid-1, definitely not on my pc.
Secondly systemd is not one big monolithic software which swallows
everything related to init system. Before systemd everything was a
bunch of scripts mildly aware of each other. systemd in its present
form is an umbrella project which aims to collect everything related
to init system and couple them with well defined api. If you don't
like something you can disable it and implement your version of it.
All you have to do is implement the required api. While there are good
arguments for and against systemd, many are simply not true anymore.
Most of the arguments I have seen online boil down to these, "it
breaks the way I have been doing it for the past 20 years", "Redhat is
evil", "Its made by lennart poettering" etc.

It is true that there was some corporate politics involved, things
were especially nasty in the debian camp and caused a lot of broken
hearts. But in the end systemd won not because of redhat's iron fist
but due to its superiority.

This site (http://boycottsystemd.org/) gives a list of points against
systemd. A good discussion over the points both for and against can be
found here (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8353006)

It is true, gnome requires logind as dependency. There are some
discussions and explorations in KDE camp, but NO concrete decisions
about systemd based sessions yet. We can only wait and see after KDE 5
settles down. For a fun/stupid storytelling on debian systemd case
check this site(http://aceattorney.sparklin.org/jeu.php?id_proces=57684).

People hate systemd because it introduces too many radical changes,
some people don't like change.

Just a struggling developer. I'm new to these things. I don't mean for

Thats exactly the problem, why on earth an init system need to be an
umbrella project.

Aaahh!! cut-short please!! dont generalize. I too know the usefulness
systemd provides. But answer me these couple of questions?

1) If I want to change my hostname dynamically, why I need to contact
pid-1 to change it? do you have a seperate systemd-hostnamed running in
your pc?

2) if I want to change my locale dynamically, why I need to contact
pid-1 to change it? is there any systemd-localed running in your pc?

the same goes to datetimed, coredumpd . If kdbus comes into kernel, then
systemd will implement its userspace inside pid-1 instead of a daemon
like (systemd-kdbusd) and say we are modular and not running everything
inside pid-1. right?

> People hate systemd because it introduces too many radical changes,

You forget that there are people who are willing to experiment with new
things but don't like morans go and fix something which is not broken
(in the case of syslog).

All we wanted is a modern init system because sysvinit is no longer
relevent. But what we got is an umbrella project aims to become the
middle layer for linux which forgets to KISS!!

Because it makes sense to group a bunch of different programs/scripts
doing related things together and coordinate the effort.

If I need to configure hostname, I will use
hostnamectl(http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/hostnamectl.html),
which will in turn run
hostnamed(http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/hostnamed/).

The only systemd process running in my pc as I write this are these ...

1 systemd
158 systemd-journal
179 systemd-udevd
349 systemd-logind
729 systemd

I don't need systemd-hostnamed as a daemon running in my background
unnecessarily, it will spawn and do the job when required, and die.
And it will not run as pid1.

> 2) if I want to change my locale dynamically, why I need to contact
> pid-1 to change it? is there any systemd-localed running in your pc?

If I need to change locale, I will use
localectl(http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/localectl.html)
which is a client to the daemon
localed(http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-localed.service.html).
this also will not run as pid1.

You can call the people who are actually building things and writing
code moron. The truth is large distributions and companies adopting
this "fix for something which is not broken".

If you are unhappy, you can continue to use your old init scripts and
legacy methods. No one is stopping you. systemd's advantages are far
greater compared to its disadvantages. KISS(Keep it simple, stupid)
principle can be interpretted in different ways. Anything that follows
KISS can be argued against it by looking at it from different angles.
I can say that systemd follows KISS by its modular design.

KDBUS is coming, and yes systemd will have tighter integration with
kernel. Supporting every available legacy baggage should never be an
excuse for hindering modern design and development.

Would still like to interact with you guys if you can manage a pc / 
webcam / mic and speaker

I have a hosted webrtc server that can be used.

Might help others to give remote sessions to your group in the future?

who is spawning the job? isn't it pid-1? If you say no, then it means
you don't know how the activation works (look
at /usr/share/dbus-1/systemd-service/org.freedesktop.hostname1.service).
If you say yes, but the actual job is running as another pid, then what
is the point of pid-1 brokering? isn't dbus suppose to spawn the child
instead of pid-1? 

The problem here is, you never know what kind of data you will receive
in pid-1 through dbus requests before forking the child. This is what I
say exposing pid-1. If someone exploit here (before spawning the child),
it will lead them to other pid-1 resources. Thats why people are saying
init should not be doing all these work. demons are there to do these
work. even if daemons get compromised, they will not provide other
important resources.

Don't say SElinux is integrated with systemd so there is no way to
exploit systemd. SElinux will not help in this situation.

[1] all are stupid arguments assuming that whoever ask question against
systemd are not appreciating its features, they don't know about it's
design and they are trolls from reddit.com/r/[a-zA-Z0-9]*/*. Your post
which started arguments between you and me says "people bashing systemd
have very little technical information", do you still think people
arguing against systemd don't know how it works?

What's the point? To convince people that ssl somehow keeps them safe

Both yes and no.

I agree that PID 1 here is spawning the process. DBUS is a message bus
for interprocess communication and it should stay that way. It SHOULD
NOT do service mangement. What you want is another daemon running
which should do service management. Whether systemd PID 1 should do
this or not is debatable and this has very good arguments on both
sides (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8353006).

Here is a list of systemd processes running on my PC I mentioned earlier.

1 systemd
158 systemd-journal
179 systemd-udevd
349 systemd-logind
729 systemd

If you note here, there are 2 systemd instances, PID 1 and PID 729.
PID 729 is a systemd instance running under user session. This also
can start and stop services (not all). So not all services have to be
started by PID 1.

The systemd's dbus API is here
(http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/dbus/). Some of the
security related aspects are mentioned here.

Every architecture has its ups and downs. systemd's solves a whole lot
of problems and causes very few. Yes, systemd PID 1 does service
management and takes requests through dbus. Whether it is good or bad
is up for debate. Saying something like "Everything is PID1, so its
crap" is not only unfair and a gross misrepresentation, but quite
literally untrue.

I don't use or know anything about SElinux or its relationship with
systemd. Can you provide some references?

Why do you have to bring reddit into this?

My original statement was "Most of the people bashing systemd are
people with very little technical information about the project." I
did not say everyone who speaks against is like that. There are people
who know what they are talking about, people like theses guys
(http://uselessd.darknedgy.net/), who would go to lengths to strip
systemd of its undesired functionality. But most of the other people I
have seen on online forums are just haters.

Formatting of the text is a "meta data". Once you convert the entire WORD
into  TEXT, you loose the meta data. You will not be able to put it back.

1. When you try to convert the WORD to HTML, the resultant HTML is UGLY.
You might end up with a hundred tags between two letters in the same word.
It is simply horrible :(.


For .DOC
2. I have tried to do this in the past. Read the Word Document using Apache
POI (Java). This would return each paragraph/ sentance with the same
formatting as a chunk. The next format would be in a different chunk (and
so on).You can read it this way, and convert it using your txt2Unicode and
put the text back. This way it would be easier.

WORD of Caution: If your MS Word Documents contains embedded images, we
were not able to read the exact order of the images in it. So, if there are
10 images, we do not know which image would stay where.


For .DOCX
3. If you are able to get the document in DOCX format instead of .DOC, then
do this:
--> Rename the DOCX to .ZIP and then unzip it. You will find a
"document.xml" inside. Happy converting :-)

Do you supporting Linux really ?

If some needs to know the basic information of Linux , will  he be able to
get information from your site?

Even Linux is free of cost but why people are not using even after GUI of
some Linux version?

So I think  failure success rate.

This is a mailing list for people who use and like using linux. Mostly
composed of people who have regular jobs and try to help others in
their free time. Usually information that can be got from a simple
google search will not be provided here. That's what google's for! If
you want to offload performing even a google (or bing or dukduckgo
whatever) search to others, you will not find help here.

>

I have come across many people (even quasi-tech project/product
managers) who think (imo, rightly) that if you do not know how to use
the commandline properly, you are not an experienced developer! So, if
you want to become a developer (am assuming you want to) ditch GUI and
learn to command the system to do your bidding :-)


> So I think  failure success rate.

Frustration with others never helps.

May be you are not informed that Android also uses Linux kernel. It is the
most used OS and also a sort of Linux distribution.

No Linux is not a failure. Different offshoots are being used successfully (e.g. Android). It provides a viable alternative to those who want to use something not being offered in the Market.

One reason of less use in SOHO segment in India is prevalent software piracy.

If you think of only desktop two data point:

I have administered HA Cluster in a PHB manufacturing factory (aka
Management Institute awarding MBA's). no issues. 100+ seats

I have deployed netbeans a fairly decent IDE for development, god know
in how many seats, perhaps hundreds.... for a state govt. related
project.

I lost count of the number of server room and data center visits that
I had during last 8+ years

I have been enabling linux for over 8+ years in various corporate and
business environs.

google, yahoo, facebook, twitter etc. etc. etc. uses linux on backend
while morons use proprietary clients. Surely and evidently, they know
technology.

Almost every one of us as had the experience of this question arising
in our mind at some point of time at least one in our linux using
career.

You are not alone

Welcome to the wonderful world of freedom. who needs windows in an
open space without walls.

I think they will be able to ask questions here and get answers from 
some pretty decent / knowledgeable folk who give their time completely 
for free.

I think you will find they're are actually lot's of people using it. It 
might even be on your phone right now.

I do agree though that adoption could be greater and Linux (rather than 
android) has not yet hit the consumer mainstream.

of linux among morons.

Hi Everyone,
Sage is a free and open source MATLAB equivalent, based on Python. One
of the core contributors to Sage, Dr. Nathann Cohen [1] is on a visit
to IITM and has agreed to join us at the meetup.

He won't be giving a formal talk (his preference). You can meet-up with
him, pose questions to him and he will be more than willing to answer
them.

Thanks to Dr. Amritanshu Prasad [2] (also a Sage contributor), for
putting us in touch with him.

Regards,
Vijay

It works, but however I could not store the output in a variable
because of long file name in the output.

echo $PWD | awk '{print $(NF-1), $NF}' FS='/' OFS='/'

No idea with awk, sorry for troubling again.

Now, I want only the previous directory, leaving out the last directory.

/pub/videos/nptel/Computer Science and Engineering/Data Structures And
Algorithms

to

The NF variable in Awk represents the Number of fields that you have
got in your current record line. So when you say `print $(NF - 1),
$NF` you are printing the (No. Of Fields - 1)th and the (No. Of
Fields)th record. So in order to just print the last but one field,
you'll just have to print $(NF - 1) and remove the $NF. So your
command becomes

subject=$(echo $PWD | awk '{print $(NF - 1)}' FS='/' OFS='/')

If you are spending quite a bit of time doing things like this, I
would recommend spending a while to learn tools like sed and awk. They
will be extremely useful.

Here[1] is one resource to get you started.

It would help if you mention your company's name. Next time we come
across such requests (on and off line) it will be easier to recollect
the name (more than the number) and refer them your way.

Namaste everyone,

I have few questions, please educate me on these:

Why do we consider it as a bad approach that govt. is snooping on us?
Without it, how would our govt. come to know that who is bad (among others)?
If I know, I am not doing anything bad then why should I worry from govt.
snooping?

I am hoping that well-informed and well-educated minds will remove my
doubts on above said questions.

Expecting a positive reply.

Thank you.

I recently got myself a Dell Inspiron 15 5547[1]. It packs:

- 8 GB Ram
- i7
- 1TB HDD
- 2GB Graphics (ATI)
- Touchscreen

Really good deal for the price of 63,000 I felt. You might want to
check it out.

1) Can we trust the government itself?
"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?" which translates to "Who will guard the
guards themselves?"

Government itself is made up of people, even though, we can proudly say
that we democratically elected the government, can we trust the
government completely? The various scams of state governments and
central governments give us a good reason why we cant trust those
running the government. Also, a government in itself is transient, you
never know what kind of future government can come.

2) Security of the data collected

Its a common knowledge that when any riot happens, the organizers easily
target people from specific communities thanks to data such as Voter's
ID Card list etc available for that region. Hence even we can blindly
trust the government, the fact that such a collated data exists, itself
makes it a honeypot to attract bad elements in society to misuse the data.

3) Mass Surveillance vs targetted Surveillance

Though there may be some strong reasons for government to do
surveillance on specific individuals, there is very little rational to
do mass surveillance. The very notion that everything you do or say is
getting recorded will curtail freedom of expression. Everytime someone
wants to express something little off the beat, he/she might have to
take extreme caution and in many cases, people might not come forward at
all to express.
An analogy is imagine a light tower in central yard in a jail where
prisoners cant see who is watching from the light tower. Since they know
that there is 24 hours watch on it, the notion that someone there is
watching itself creates fear in them to try anything to escape.

Even in case of targetted surveillance, we know how Gujrat government
'allegedly' misused the state machinery to snoop on an individual. So
even having means to do targetted surveillance needs to have very
stringent checks and balances.

4) Eternity of the data collected

The idea that the data collected will exist years later is also
something to worry about. A simple example is what happened with Sec
377. When the high court declared it unconstitutional in 2009, many
people came forward expressing their true orientation. However when
Supreme Court overturned the HC decision, it left all the people who had
come forward openly to be sitting ducks for harassment by the authorities.

5) Option to opt-out

Like in case of Aadhar which looks like will stay in India now that the
new government also seem to be comfortable with it, there is little
option for those who value their privacy to opt-out of these schemes.

In India, since government does provide for lot of amenities, Maria
Xynou who is working on the Surveillance in India in CIS-India had
mentioned that there is a attitude amongst us to look at government like
a parent who takes care of us. Hence this attitude makes us put lot of
trust in the government which is dangerous.

If Indian governmnet needs my data to protect me and others I am okay with
that. But with some conditions - I should know which data is taken, it
should be protected in such a way that no human / non-human can access it
directly without a court order and the data should be used only for the
above mentioned purpose. Data collected has to be destroyed properly if the
person wants so (may be with a court order or some other legal procedure).
Also I need to see what data is available if I wish.

I am not okay with US government doing this. Why should it need to have
access to my data? I don't want that. I feel US government is using and
will use my data for undue commercial advantage. I want that to be stopped.

This is my personal opinion.
