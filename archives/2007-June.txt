You can do two things. 
One - Post the problem here with relevant details
Two - Search for specific keywords on your favourite
search engine. 

If you haven't been able to solve it after extensive
efforts by you to solve the problem, the first option
is worth considering. Else the second.

It would be better, if there is a HTML file of the
same. (IMO). (I haven't searched for it, so if it
already exists, please ignore this post).

Firestarter just creates iptables rules, you don't need firestarter to
be running in order to keep your firewall running. Just make sure you
load the iptables rules when your machine boots up (the procedure for
which will depend on which distribution you are using)

Alternatively, you can try out shorewall. (comes with an init script in
Gentoo).

This is the first time ever that I haven't even considered updating to
a newer release in spite of the bells and whistles and the attracting
reviews about them. It's the perfect OS that I have been ever
searching for.

And what else - I am yet another happy Ubuntu 6.06 user.

   Fedora Core 7 was released on Thursday but with not
much fanfare... Its hardly in the news. Seems like
Fedora has been ditched by its supporters.

Message-ID: <a3bcf7260706012234w6a5e3c47q90533b8ab3a7421a@mail.gmail.com>

i have actually 2 things to know..

1) how can i manually open/close/block ports in linux (in terminal)?

2)what is sockV proxy and can i change the port on which we can access
it,that is,port no. 1080 .

Actually we have a LAN setup at our hostel and on one computer we have
internet connection.it has 2 network cards one connected to internet and the
other like other nodes is connected to LAN.Now when we use bit torrent
clients we have to specify the proxy as 172.31.1.15:1080 where
172.31.1.15is the local address of the node which is directly
connected to internet.

   i)so why do i need to specify this proxy?
   ii)and can i change the port no. for the sockV proxy on 172.31.1.15 ?(i
have the access to this node)

Forgive me if this seems like a standard reply, but
http://linmodems.org is the place you should visit. If you are unable
to get things working despite that, please post the relevant line of
your lspci output to check if someone else on the list can provide you
any more pointers.

Hi,
You need to start beryl at the start of your desktop session.
The method to do this varies as per your Desktop Environment.

I have taken the following from Ubuntu's section but should work
for Debian too

GNOME

Go to System > Preferences > Sessions
Go to the Startup Programs tab
Click the Add button and type in beryl-manager
Repeat the previous step, adding beryl
Exit

KDE

Simpler - but less graphical. In a terminal:
ln -s /usr/bin/beryl-manager ~/.kde/Autostart/beryl-manager

But, for the first time, I'd recommend you to open the terminal
and type 'beryl' in it and see if it works fine or not. If not, the
errors thrown will help you sort out the problem.

Are you planning to talk about "what is available in the opensource

Manually remove the corresponding entry from /usr/share/autostart (or
equivalent for your distro) using the tty1 console (ctrl-alt-f1).

I think you can use screen on the remote server to have the update
process continue even if you aren't logged in.
Just start a screen session, issue the update command and then detach
the screen process (ctrl+a d)
Later you can resume the detached screen process by doing screen -r

Or use the "nohup" command. Though if stuff breaks when you're
distupgrading you cant do much to stop the process that way.

See what causes the ssh timeout to occur - MTU issues are the most
probable, so fiddling with your dsl routers settings / your PC's tcp
windows should help.

Manually remove the corresponding entry from /usr/share/autostart (or

i dont have any entry in /usr/share/autostart (moreover i don even have that file too).

i came across two files in my HOME dir, 
 edited the list entry from file  /home/sathyz/.gconf/apps/gnome-settings/gnome-session-properties/%gconf.xml

and removed
/home/sathyz/.config/autostart/beryl-manager.desktop

in tty1 and now my gnome goes perfectly.

it is running


i have installed ssh and its working perfectly.. what do you mean by it is running?? is there any services or daemon for scp??

> Folks,
          There's some suckage while upgrading from FC5 or earlier, so you
may want to do a fresh install of F7 where possible.

Some bugs/suckage/fixes/workarounds:

1) It uses SCSI emulation to access all drives, including PATA/IDE drives.
So basically what was formerly hda* in FC5 or earlier will become sda*.
The hassle is that if you formerly had SATA or SCSI drives with partitions
labelled sda*, it doesn't get relabelled in fstab to sdb* - I had to
manually
fix it in fstab.

2) I lost my xfce desktop background pixmap. Needs to be fixed manually.
Also lost the screen locking function in xfce - unresolved for the moment.

3) It silently uninstalled my mozilla-1.7.13 and installed firefox instead.
No
big deal, but I use mozilla for certain very good reasons. There's also
a file conflict between firefox in F7 and the version of mozilla in FC5, so
you can't have both. Temporary fix: uninstall firefox and reinstall
mozilla from FC5, which works fine in F7 (rebuilding the mozilla
SRPM from FC5 on F7 failed).

4) k9copy-1.1.1 broke silently on a libdbus dependency. I fixed it by
recompiling k9copy from SRPM. This is not a Fedora problem -
it is specific to the specfile in k9copy.

5) Xine-0.99.4-7 from FC5 broke silently because F7 has upgraded xine-lib
quietly, breaking a dependency on libcurl.so.3. Again, may not be a Fedora
problem - may have to explicitly encode that libcurl dependency in xine
or xine-lib specfile. Presently still unresolved - the rebuild of the old
xine
SRPMs failed.

6) The /dev entries for the optical drives (cdrom, dvd) no longer get their
ownership set to the user logged in at the console - it remains set to root
with permissions 555. That's OK, but it causes problems when you mount
the drive and do a cp -a on a directory tree on a CD or DVD. Workaround
is to do a cp -r instead.

7) F7 has a new bunch of daemons hogging CPU resources. Resolution:
mercilessly chkconfig every unnecessary daemon out.

Other than this, everything seems fine and works generally the same as
before. I can't immediately see much of a speedup, but the boot messages
seem to scroll faster, so there's probably some improvement there.

Most new distros (and I think the kernel enforces this) have moved to
using UUID=[some value] in fstab instead of explicit /dev/hdaX or sdaX -
you can find out what the UUID value for each partition is by

# blkid /dev/hda1

for example.  Usually goes quite seamlessly unless you've got hand
customized kernels etc.

While reading about Eben Moglen on Wikipedia I came across a quote of his
referring to a judge of the Allahabad High Court. Did a search for foss in
Allahabad High Court, I came across this link:

http://www.techmag.biz/foss_allahabad_high_court

That article has a link to the high court website itself. On the HC website
do check out the faq section on 'technical'. Also see the judge's own blog.

other things I want to cover.

Upstream kernel libata changes /dev/hda* to /dev/sd* for all devices. 
That's a pretty disruptive change combined a new codebase. The 
requirement of labeling is mentioned in 
http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes/f7/en_US/sn-Installer.html#id3152635

That was a RPM update added when the default browser was switched.

Why would you want to install the FC5 mozilla in F7 or did you mean the 
F7 mozilla package?

Which deamons are you referring to? There is a bunch of deamons like 
bluetooth started because sysvinit doesnt have hardware specific details 
but one of incremental improvements in HAL information being added to 
these.

Great. Exactly what I thought I should request. There are so many
associated and necessary( but may not be sufficient) details that
needs some light. Thank You.

ssh is installed and running on the other machine where you're
trying to connect, the machine who's IP is 10.1.1.10?
AFAIK, you need ssh running to use scp.
sshd should be running.
/etc/init.d/sshd start as root, to start ssh daemon.

Hi All,

Thanks for all the support. The event was quite succesful.

Here are some  pictures and my two cents on the event.

http://picasaweb.google.com/arvind.rajaram/Eben_Molgen_Talk/

Without Vijoo and FSD we wouldn't have taken this small step. FSD is a
great coordinator. Hats off.

As Eben said in everything today...connecting and being community and
creating things as community really matters . 

Also making sure the commons are not trespassed is the need of the
hour...

Whether its GPLv3(a community created licence) , GNU-Linux, Google,
Orkut, Flickr , modern globalised business or struggles for freedom
"COMMUNITY matters". If we can stay connected and also be concerned
about fellow humans and ethics nothing like it. 


cheers
Senthil

Details :
---------

Anyone interested in newbie(or introduction to
Freedom)session::GNU/Linux installation sessions::Kernel introduction
sessions::GPLv3: Trouble with my box  sessions . We would also be very
happy if you vounteer to give sessions and give details about the
sessions you can handle..

If college/students are interested in courses designed by professionals
in the industry....do let us know..that will take us a long way in
becoming better professionals 

Do let us know about the other topics you are interested in / can offer
( e.g :  how to start a linux based ethical business)

There was an engineer from IBM who is already hanling a course for
PESIT. Anyone who can offer such courses also do get in touch 

Do let us know by sending a email to : 'vijookrishnan@yahoo.co.in' with
your exact interest.

We do have a prepared module on Newbie installation. We need to come up
with a slide show presentation  for GPLv3 and one for kernel
introduction. 

Btw the Asian age today carried out a news item on the event. 

Stay connected and give your comments too.

Infact there was good discussion on GPLv3 at IBM and Sun today. 

We were all really inspired by the wonderful work that has been done for
GPLv3 and baffled by the nittie gritties involved.

In the talk at St.Josephs - he extensively spoke on how all of us have
the need to connect and the need for community initatives not only
limited to the domain of software. 

How todays technology is moving us towards a user-producer negotiated
virtual space and the moral and ethical dialemas which are part of the
whole thing. How wonderful that we are at this pivotal point in history
at the moment. How inspiring it is that we have people like Eben who can
tell us where we are standing in this long struggle for freedom.

Three cheers to Mishi, Kiran, Vijoo ,Jayakumar, Praveen, Justin,
Balaji,Sujith, Chat, the folks at FSD, sujith.h@gmail.com(who drove the
car) and team for making all this possible. Thanks to the folks at IBM :
Suparna, Dipankar and others , the folks like Balaji at Sun . 

Thanks to Prassana, Aravind and Guru for the help with pictures. Sorry
if I have a missed a few names. Please pitch in.

Thanks to everyone of you who stepped into help. We had a minor issue
with audio - there was a little echo - which made it difficult for
people to listen at St Jospehs.....however

As Eben said in everything today...connecting and being community and
creating things as community really matters . 

Whether its Linux, Google, Orkut, Flickr or modern business COMMUNITY
matters.

Stay connected as that's what matters for us humans...

Hi,

Has anybody tried wengophone from  http://openwengo.com. It has very
good reviews.

Read   http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/wengo_phone

It is supposed to be a very good competitor for skype.

Note: yahoo messenger is still not providing voice chat in linux.

even if you have sshd running, some setups by default prevent ssh  
login by root - check that too by logging in as an ordinary user.  
btw, *why* are you doing ssh as root?

I use wengophone only for voice chat in linux.
It promises it is the cheapest one compared to yahoo and skype on pc-to-phone 
talk. I did not tired that.

But, i use it extensively for pc-to-pc chat with my friends in far countries.
It is very good at voice clearity.

Hi,

1. Connectivity
   Is your ssh running on the other machine.
   from the remote machine from where you want to do an ssh, try this 
   command
   telnet 10.1.1.244 22
   You must get a prompt something like this :
   Connected to XXXXXXX
   Escape character is '^]'.
   SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_4.0
  
   If this works, then it means there is no tweak needed on the daemon
side. things are fine. Else you have to take a look into two places
   a) See if iptables is running using command
      # iptables -L 
      (if it is running, use /etc/init.d/iptables stop to stop it 
       and get ovet to step 1 )
    b) go to the machine 10.1.1.244 which is running ssh and try 
       step 1 by command 
       telnet localhost 22
       If this works, then the interface to which ssh is bound is just 
       the loopback  interface. This can be corrected by adding this 
       line to /etc/ssh/sshd_config (check this config file location
       as it might change in some distros - mine is a debian )

       ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
       And restart the daemon /etc/init.d/sshd restart 
       check from step 1 if things are fine

2.  As Kenneth pointed out, root ssh may not be allowed. This can be 
    fixed by PAM files under pam.d [ not in my scope :-) ]

3. If #1 was successful, try ssh'ing to the machine  10.1.1.244 with a 
    -vvv command to find out what exactly is happening and post us the 
    reply.

How about a grand show on Foss advantages for industry - without the
fanaticism about freedom and focussing only on the commercial advantages it
can offer! Speakers like the hon'ble judge, Uma Shankar and other users (at
the level of CXO, for impact) of FOSS within industries sharing their
success stories! This kind of activity will create a market for foss talent
that the linux demo day activity fosters! At the very least it will expand
the market for the freelancers.

sshd should be running.
/etc/init.d/sshd start as root, to start ssh daemon.

Message-ID: <9a9bfc170706042253v58bb442ei6d5004850021ae4a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

Noticed that Firefox doesn't set ICCCM Role property for its windows.. For
that matter even the Title and Icon Name (only the NetWM properties are
there)... Is there any extension which sets these? Any workaround? Trouble
is, you need the Role to match the browser windows and not any other window
(like Bookmarks or Prefs) for the window manager to identify it and perform
actions on it...

Is this a Firefox bug I should be reporting?

it moves on...

  Not opened, but I resolved this by building these SRPMs in the right
order,
sacrificing a few goats and chanting the right incantations:

bitmap-1.0.3-2.fc7.src.rpm
lesstif-0.95.0-15.fc7.src.rpm (broken Specfile - need to stub out
includedir/Dt in files list)
xorg-x11-bitmaps-1.0.1-4.1.src.rpm
xlockmore-5.23-1.fc7.src.rpm

Switching to lesstif also breaks my old tetex and xpdf rpms from FC5, but
I'll rebuild
that later (famous last words?) from FC6/F7 SRPMs.

  F7 doesn't ship with mozilla, only firefox.  If you want to retain mozilla
as your
default browser (like I do), you have to  use the FC5 rpms, or be brave and
attempt
to rebuild the FC5 SRPM on F7 (not recommended, and won't work without some
serious dependency hell).

  As a general observation, there's a huge number of -devel RPMs that are
missing
on the F7 DVD, making it very difficult to set up a build platform around
F7. For
instance, try rebuilding xine-lib from the F7 SRPM - it's nearly impossible,
as a
huge dependency tree starts sprouting, most of which are -devel rpms from
FC6
and FC6 Extras.

The Mozilla suite is dead and buried. If you want an integrated suite, use
Seamonkey. It is in Fedora repos.

  Tetex from F7 SRPMs built cleanly. However, xpdf from fc6
extras requires libpaper; libpaper-1.1.20-5.fc6.src.rpm from F7
SRPMs won't build on an F7 box because it has a dependency
on automake-1.9.6, while F7 ships with automake-1.10. And
there isn't an automake19 packaged for F7 (or for that matter,
FC6).

  Note that libpaper-1.1.20-5.fc6.src.rpm is a shipped SRPM
for F7 - but there's no way it could be built on an F7 build box.
We're back to the days of the RH 6.2 -> 7.0 transition, and
unresolvable build dependencies, as well as general dependency
hell.

which
works for me. Previously, if I upgraded any Redhat or Fedora distro, it
would leave the existing installed packages intact, but it would bump
up the version, if possible to do so while satisfying dependencies. In some
cases, it would install compat-* packages to make sure that the old
packages continued to work, if it could not upgrade the packages to
more recent versions.

  That's the behaviour I expect, and that's what most users would expect.
What I do not want is the upgrade to silently remove my Mozilla suite,
and replace it with Firefox. It's a bit like sending a Mercedes for an oil
change, and being given a new Santro in return.

  I don't want a Santro - I want my old Mercedes. If they can't do an oil
change on it because the filters are no longer available, I want the
old Mercedes back intact. I don't give a flying fuck that they don't
manufacture my old Mercedes any longer. I want to continue
using it. Get it?

Good idea, but  iam afraid  it might start a trend -- which will be
irreversible-- emphasis on the commercial value rather on the openness and
freedom, but intriguing what do others think about this??

Hi all,
Our Airtel ADSL2 220BX  Modem has an IP address of
192.168.1.254
my system  has an IP Address of 192.168.1.1 (which has
got 2 network cards)
and my LAN machines has got addresses as
192.168.0.0/24
while i set the machine (which has got the IP of
192.168.1.1 & 192.168.0.1 )as gateway for
my 192.168.0.0/24 networks, internet is not working in
192.168.0.0/24 networks but working on 192.168.1.0/24
networks.

but in VSNL the same setup is working fine.

while i go through in both modems the Airtel has
firewall enabled but in VSNL the firewall is disabled.

is it the cause ? how to disable it ?
or else what will be the problem?

I would appreciate if you just open a bug report. Building SRPMS isn't a

#yum install seamonkey. It is the rename and "community" developed 
version of a EOL'ed Mozilla suite. You shouldn't be recompiling FC5 
RPM's unnecessarily.

The DVD has a subset of the packages available in the media. Rest of 
them are in the repository and you can use yum and friends to install them.

What about the dns server configuration in the LAN machines? Are you

Post the content of /etc/resolve.conf file in the LAN machines. It

Don't try to disable firewall in Airtel. Instead try to configure NAT
in your 192.168.1.1 machine. Try it using google.

That's usually the right expectation. Here is what is unique in this 
situation

* Mozilla suite was default in Fedora sometime back.
* Mozilla suite was abandoned by Mozilla corp at that time in favor of 
Firefox. No community had taken leadership of the project as it did with 
seamonkey later on.

Providing a update path from (abandoned) Mozilla suite to Firefox seemed 
the reasonable path if you don't want to leave the old browser with 
security issues in the system during upgrades.

When Seamonkey effort was started it was introduced into the repository 
again. Firefox is default now but seamonkey is provided as a alternative.

I think you need to check your subnet mask for your 192.168.0.0/24 network.

but it would seem logical, then, to package Seamonkey and use that
to obsolete Mozilla. Anyway, I'll build it and check it out.

Another observation is that there a fair number of packages left over
after an upgrade from FC5 to F7, with mismatches between the
package version and the corresponding -devel version. The upgrade
leaves the older -devel packages lying around, without either removing
them altogether or bumping them up to the current -devel version.
That makes it difficult to use F7 as a dependable build environment,
because rebuilds from SRPMs now start failing mysteriously when
there's a mismatch between the old header files and the updated
libraries.

I'm not sure if all these instances are due to broken specfiles in
those packages. I can't recollect this happening on this scale in
previous upgrades, for instance, FC3 to FC4.

It would if seamonkey  had started immediately after Mozilla suite was 
EOL'ed but there was time in between were Mozilla suite codebase seemed 
to be completely abandoned so a obsolete from Firefox was the only 
logical option at that point.

Seamonkey project was formed later and introduced into the repository 
does obselete the old Mozilla suite as expected. I remember writing down 
some of these details in the release notes for a previous version of 
Fedora.

There is a section in the F7 release notes from me that notes that a 
considerable number of packages were inherited from the previous release.

If you have any specific examples of problems with package mismatches in 
the official repository that you are having issues can you post that 
list? How did you perform the upgrade?

   OK, I just did an rpm -qa | grep 'devel'  and I'll here's a snippet of
the first 10
entries, and the corresponding base package (not the entire list):

imlib-devel-1.9.13-26.2.1
tcl-devel-8.4.12-4
x264-devel-0.0.0-0.2.20060607.fc5
libmatroska-devel-0.8.0-3
ghostscript-devel-8.15.2-1.1
audit-libs-devel-1.3-2
Glide3-devel-20050815-4
libvorbis-devel-1.1.2-2.fc7
libfontenc-devel-1.0.4-2.fc7
libcap-devel-1.10-29

$ rpm -q imlib tcl x264 libmatroska ghostscript audit-libs Glide3
libvorbis libfontenc libcap

imlib-1.9.15-2.fc7
tcl-8.4.13-16.fc7
x264-0.0.0-0.2.20060607.fc5
libmatroska-0.8.0-3
ghostscript-8.15.4-3.fc7
audit-libs-1.5.3-1.fc7
Glide3-20050815-5.fc6
libvorbis-1.1.2-2.fc7
libfontenc-1.0.4-2.fc7
libcap-1.10-29


A quick glance reveals 5 out of 10 mismatches, or 50%.
There are many more, this is just illustrative.

I can't imagine that the imlib, tcl, ghostscript and audit-libs
specfiles are broken after all these years working with them.

How did you perform the upgrade?

Hi,

I have tried with Mr.Muneer's quote

In my client Ubuntu machine ,
/etc/resolv.conf 

nameserver 203.145.184.13
nameserver 203.145.184.32

and in /etc/network/interfaces

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.0.9
netmask 255.255.255.0
broadcast 192.168.0.255
gateway 192.168.0.1


In my Windows client machines ,
I assign static IP address and i
assign gateway as 192.168.0.1
and dns servers as 203.145.184.13 & 203.145.184.32

the same problem continues.

One of the issues was that the update tools weren't ensuring RPM EVR 
checks. There are multiple versions of Fedora maintained at that same 
time. Even if a update path is checked during release time a upgrade 
from a fully updated previous version to a newer version is the media is 
not going to always clean as long as the installer doesn't automatically 
get the latest updates available for that particular release. Kickstart 
can do this already but the interactive installer does not yet due to 
interface issues. This should be sorted fairly soon. The advantages of 
the core and extras merge is that we have unified infrastructure to 
enforce policies now.

I suspect for your case, backing up your data and doing a clean 
installation is going to be much better. I verified that a fresh 
installation of Fedora 7 does not have this issue.

apt-rpm has much better dep resolution logic, and defaults to system 
sanity as a resolution policy rather than yum's policy of only being 
able to see the latest versions of everything, and treating all packages 
in a single bunch.

In this specific case, apt-rpm would have found that seamonkey correctly 
obsoletes mozilla and will pull that in to satisfy the update path.

I suppose one might argue that yum too has an option to handle 
--obsoletes, but its not considered with the 'recommended' option of yum 
  'update'. Enough arguments have flown back and fro on numerous mailing 
lists about such behavior and policy....

Just one of my pet peeves with yum :)

If Firefox obsoletes mozilla and there is no seamonkey in the repository 
  it doesn't matter whether you are using apt-rpm or yum or whatever.

What if both Firefox and Seamonkey obsoletes mozilla?

Recommended by whom? I always use yum upgrade. Recent versions treat yum 
upgrade the same as yum update.

afaik, Fedora-extras has been turned was turned on by default on FC5.. 
and seamonkey has been in there since as well. So how are you presuming 
its not there ?

you do know that the mozilla suite is more than 1 rpm ? each of which is 
tied in with exact version requires. As the dep solving for this works 
through, seamonkey-chat will obsolete mozilla-chat, seamonkey-mail 
obsoletes mozilla-mail etc, and is a much better candidate for the 
transaction.

go ahead, try it :)

most docs on yum will talk about yum update, not yum upgrade - there are 
quite a few other really really bad command /option naming conventions 
in yum as well - but i suppose thats a different discussion.

James is just confused, see seth's followup to his post explaining how 
they are NOT the same thing. Depending on how /etc/yum.conf is setup, 
you can get quite different results within the same repo. I accept the 
fact that since 3.0 the default action has been to fallback and have 
obsoletes turned on, but people upgrading their machines through the 
versions might not have that option. And keep in mind that when you are 
running yum update/upgrade from a system - the policy being used and the 
yum configs being used are the ones from that previous version, not the 
new one. So even if the file isnt changed, policy from the new setup 
isnt going to kick in till the next run.

btw, i am not slagging off yum here - its a great tool, I use it and 
develop for it all the time - and have it deployed on many hundreds of 
machines. Its just that in this one situation I've found the apt-rpm dep 
solving methodology to be a lot better. Which one is right ? they both 
are. Just depends on how everything else falls into place. And looking 
for a middle-path, smart seems to have a good setup there. But i dont 
like my package manager making too many assumptions for me, so i dont 
use smart at all :)

.. because it was not there for a long time and a upgrade via media 
wouln't consider Fedora Extras by default. The packages in the media 
only contains Fedora Core.

Of course. I do but the question still stands. If I add a unversioned 
obsolete from both Firefox and Seamonkey to the Mozilla browser how 
would apt-rpm deal with it? Yum picks the package with the smaller name 
but I dont think there is a definitive "correct" way here.

The yum guide that I am working on for Fedora clearly does differentiate 
between these commands though I don't make any recommendations between them.

Same here. These are all different algorithms with fans of each claiming 
theirs to be better. Many end users still think Smart is just a yum 
frontend.

If you know anyone with a previous version of Word, you can download a
converter from the Microsoft website which will convert these files to
an earlier version.

You can try the online version of Docx Converter for free from the following
URL:

http://www.docx-converter.com/?gclid=CJ6238aTyYwCFQbIbgodAGXvbQ

And never use M$ Office and if you have a broadband connection- I recommend
the following online word processors which are really good.

Best of Luck!

in the upgrade install. FWIW, I've reported a bug in bugzilla against

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0706071632120.7759-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

---------- Forwarded message ----------

Here is a rather sketchy write-up on the seminar on Free Software and
Free Culture held at Mascot Hotel at Thiruvananthapuram.

The Seminar started at 5:30 and the hall was almost full. Mr.
Jyothilal, Secretary of the IT Department, welcomed the gathering.

The first talk was by Prof. Prabhat Patnaik on Innovativeness in
Property Relations. He spoke very briefly, but demolished the idea
that innovation cannot happen without exclusion. He quoted Schumpeter,
a great supporter of capitalism, to show that the concept of private
property in ideas goes totally against capitalism. Taking the example
of two companies, he showed that the best course for each company will
always be to innovate. This is true even without the s-called
"Intellectual Property Rights". These rights are in addition to the
financial benefits they get from innovation.

Prof. Eben Moglen spoke next. His talk was called Freeing the Mind:
Free Software and the Death of Proprietary Culture. But he seems to
have departed much from what he normally speaks about when he speaks
on this topic. He started where Prof. Patnaik left. He said that this
was the first time that he has had the government people on his side!
His arguments were from the practical point of view which, in a sense,
complemented Prof. Patnaik's theoretical analysis.

He said that monopoly rights for the innovator is not an essential
pre-requisite for innovation to happen. As an example, he pointed to
Free Software itself. He said that we have created software that is
better than proprietary ones by any technological criteria. And this
happened without any monopoly rights for anyone. He said that the
company that has accumulated the highest amount of money has innovated
very little. Its word processor, he said, was incapable of producing
any good-looking document. He narrated an instance where he was asked
by an advocate in the US what he used for creating legal documents for
submission to courts. When he replied that he used a software called
LaTeX, the other advocate wanted to learn LaTeX. Microsoft did not
innovate, they purchased. The application called Word was purchased
from the Palo Alto Research Centre of Rank Xerox. The company itself
came to prominence because IBM did not want their own software to go
into the PC they designed and manufactured. He said that it is not
possible to delve deeply into justifications for capitalism without
encountering contradictions.

In his opinion, it was not capitalism that brought wealth to the US,
but initiatives that were more socialist than capitalist. Like the
free university education given to retired military personnel at
public institutes. Another was the high spending in research during to
the cold war. He said that steps like these had led to a lot of
infrastructure development. Once the cold war ended, and the
government started to reduce funding for research, things started
changing. Developments in technology, he said, were not cutting at the
roots of the structure that crated them. The copyright and patent laws
that were supposedly meant to promote innovation were, in fact,
slowing them down. Any innovation now involved negotiations with
several people who held the rights. Information Technology now makes
it possible to make infinite copies of different kinds of software --
programs, music, video, text, and so on -- and this is posing a threat
to the companies that were making money from these things. This kind
of a situation had been predicted by Marx and Engels, he said, though
such technologies could not have been thought of in those days.

Prof. Moglen said that all patent laws, including the ones in the US
are archaic. A cost-benefit analysis is done on everything the
government does. But no such analysis is done to see whether a patent
would do more harm than benefit to society before the patent is
granted. In other words, innovation is given infinite weightage. The
prevention of software patents would give enormous benefits to
society, he said. The human species learned to manipulate the world,
to control nature for its own benefit. All this happened because of
the large brain and hands that were freed when homo sapiens became
bipeds. There is the question of which came first. Modern research
shows that man became a biped first and it was later that the brain
enlarged. Surprisingly Frederick Engels had stated this two centuries
ago. He had said that it was the use of hands for manipulating the
external world and experimenting with it that led to the increase in
brain size.

Prof. Moglen said that computer networking had brought about a big
change in the way we live. If we switch off the net now, deny the
Internet to everyone, a lot of people will find it very difficult to
lead a normal life. When a young woman decided to quit myspace, a new
community was created to encourage her to come back to the site
because she used to be the custodian of all their photographs. The
network has changed even the job market.

The market is the central point of focus in economics and it decides
how resources are allocated under scarcity. You have the demand curve
and the supply curve and things like that to determine what shall be
the price of a commodity. You have the fixed cost and the marginal
cost and things like that. So you sell a loaf of bread for the
marginal cost. But suppose there are people who cannot afford to buy
the bread at the marginal cost, it leads to injustice. Suppose you
have a machine which requires only one loaf of bread to begin with and
you can generate thousands of loaves by just pressing a button. Then
the marginal cost becomes zero, and it is unfair to charge for each
loaf.

The network has made possible Free Software, which is frictionless at
the network. Here, the fixed cost is covered because human beings love
to create. The marginal cost is virtually zero. The economist,
homunculus economicus, does not see human nature. The reductionist
economist went on reducing until he reduced everything, including
himself. This economic dwarfconsiders human beings as individuals.
John Donne had said, "No man is." We are not islands. The guy who made
Free Software did not do so because he had a monopoly. He did so
because he could not have done anything else. This is what makes
meaning in, and meaning of, life. People simply enjoy doing things,
and one of the best examples for this is Wikipedia. He said that one
aspect of Wikipedia is sufficient to demonstrate this -- the breaking
news. He said that the breaking news in Wikipedia is better than any
other media because people the world over are seeing/hearing news and
putting it in Wikipedia. Prof. Moglen said that his blog is often
behind Wikipedia when it comes to matters about himself. This is proof
of the fact that a proof-of-concept + running code + community leads
to production without property. He also mentioned his Correlative
Corollary to Faraday's Law. He said that, like in Faraday's Law, take
the community, wind the net around it and spin the world, and you get
information flowing through the network. We take from people according
to their ability and give to people according to their need.

There were a few questions related to the topic, which were mostly
kind of clarifying his statements. The meeting ended around 8 pm.

One way of fixing this is o setup your Debian machine with a default route
to 192.168.1.254.

And then set your LAN machines to use your debian system as the gateway -
that is, set the gateway to 192.168.0.1 on all your LAN machines.

This link may be helpful.

Another option is to setup your debian machine as a squid proxy instead of
a NAT gateway.

I hope this helps.

By default, all mail fetched by fetchmail goes, by default to
/var/mail/<username>.  However, you can ask an MDA like procmail to do
the needful to put the mail elsewhere, usually ~/Mail/<foldername>.

You should read up a bit about mutt+procmail+gmail. I am sure Googling
turns up a huge number of links.

Another interesting article from Jeremy Allison (he had written
earlier about the document lockup with MS Office 2007)

" ... Sure, there's gobs and gobs of extra software in the process
which is usually run at the consumer end of the deal, trying to
obfuscate and hide the fact that the consumer possesses all the
information needed to decrypt the file they've just been given. They
have to have been given this, else they can't listen to the song or
watch the movie. Claiming that this process can ever be made secure
from the people you've just given all this information to is like
believing you can create a secure bank vault by drawing chalk lines on
the pavement, piling the money inside and asking customers to "respect
these boundaries". The media industries are trying to sell what they
consider to be valuable data without any means of prohibiting access
to it. This is not a business model that is ever going to work."

Here's one that I had followed
http://linuxreviews.org/howtos/mail/Gmail_on_Home_Linux_Box/index.html.en

You will have to understand and change a couple of things as per your
distro.
Fetching part worked for me, but not the sending part. Just that I've been
too
lazy to figure out what went wrong.

For those using Debian (and for Ubuntu with Exim), this explains the
sending part quite well:

Choose any distro(May be debian Sarge or Etch).. Use Enlightenment 0.17 as
your desktop.. Its beautiful and performance oriented..

3) have lightweight OpenOffice, Simple web browser.


OpenOffice and lightweight, I guess wont go together.. The Simple Web
browser may be Konqueror or Opera(It is good in terms of usability and very
lightweight, though not OSS)

4) simple image editor, text editor, etc...


If for children(I presume that by your affiliation with a school), Tuxpaint
may be nice..

5) auto mount to Windows partition, if any


You can configure that to happen on any distro if you edit the fstab file..
Or may be you can install Knoppix on to your HDD and apt-get install
enlightenment and remove all KDE apps.. But that would be a headache to do
on all the systems in your school.. You would probably want something that
works right away.. In that case, you can just use any distro and add
automount functionality by adding the Windows partitions to your fstab.

   If you're behind a firewall, RedHat 6.2 or 7.3 + xfce + Abiword or
StarOffice 5.2 (free as in beer) + konqueror will do the trick.

What is I see is someone created two *events* titled "how to configure
cluster in suse linux"
Some new user posted his query on the main drupal website (as an event).
Is this normal behaviour and is it entertained?

If I understand right, the main website is to post news, announcements
and past/future events.
If any user can register and post random things, then we may have
serious problems with spammers in the future.
That is why I suggest the site needs some moderators who will take
care of publishing articles/events submitted by the users.

i looked at it again - is this a query or is he advertising some  
course? Or is he starting a thread in a forum? Forums havent worked  
so far in Indian LUG groups ...

I have first hand experience of using Debian Sarge with IceWM on 56 MB
RAM. For just browsing the net, at least, it is very usable. However,
I am yet to check the other things.

Slackware 9+ will be yet another choice for you.

Google / ebay charge about 2% as transaction charges. But for us 7% is just
very costly. Does anybody know of any payment gateway in India that charge
resonable amount ?

I guess this can be another idea that can be taken into account for
entrepreneurs  - Payment gateway service.

He's been asking queries about downloading / opening a lot of stuff
(.chm, .rar etc) in linux. Individually the questions dont mean much but
taken collectively, I think he's just downloading pirate ebooks / warez
etc from IRC / p2p servers.  And he then can't open some of them.

Possible reasons

* Corrupted download of the file (its warez after all, dont expect
quality control)

* The rar's split across multiple files, he's just downloaded one

etc

a.  If you want your script to run on a regular interval , use cron .
you can edit crontab using the following command

  /$crontab -e 

/Format /
/MINUTE    HOUR   DAY_OF_THE_MONTH   MONTH  DAY_OF_WEEK    /command

/b. it you want the job to be performed only once , schedule it using 
'/at'  /command

c.  to run the job at the startup, put the in /etc/rc.X  (typically
/etc/rc.3)  directory. The scripts in these directories are run at the
respective runlevels while the system is booted. Refer to runlevels for
more info.

Sorry, Sherlock holmes.. you are not too much right. "lot of stuff" doesn`t
make any sense here. I asked help about only rar files. I asked, "how can i
face the unwanted problems created by .rar files".

Message-ID: <feff2f50706111119l41f378d0s586ec784c5292f6d@mail.gmail.com>

I searched for weeks together for payment gateway solution in India that
will help me in creating online donation portal. But the sad state is that
most of them charge high transaction charges ( 7% from merchants -
ridiculous isnt it ).

Google / ebay charge about 2% as transaction charges. But for us 7% is just
very costly. Does anybody know of any payment gateway in India that charge
resonable amount ?

I guess this can be another idea that can be taken into account for
entrepreneurs  - Payment gateway service.

i am using this - the premium scheme: http://ccavenue.com/content/ 
pricing.jsp - they do a good job and the pricing is reasonable. They  
have an interface coded in weird things like jsp/asp/php, but it is  
easily rewritten in python. (note, I am not employed by them nor do I  
get a commission from them)

Hi folks,

Well, I finally got tired of horrible gmane ui and it's broken search, 
and created a Google Groups mirror for ILUGC mailing list. It's 
read-only, and the searches work better, and you can subscribe with rss 
if you want an easier way to read the discussions. Of course, it doesn't 
have old posts, but will have all the discussions from now on (it has 
some of yesterday's posts too). Here's the url:

http://groups.google.com/group/ilugc-mirror

HTH,
V.

P.S: Well, now Big G can archive/rank our conversations better, and 
probably they will show up higher in the search results when potential 
employers do a search on you. So be nice and go easy on the "Flame" 
button ;-)

Does that mean it has minimal support for JavaScript and zero tolerance 
for Ajax?

Safari (WebKit) is based on KHTML (Konqueror's) rendering engine and is 
one among the fastest rendering for HTML and has got a very good 
JavaScript support.

I was referring to AJAX. But I have no clue of why it does not support 
AJAX, thought it has good support for JavaScript.

Hi,

What does really happen when we browse pages with tiny_mce embedded in safari?

As I am using it for our web app, I would like to know it.

Thanks

Whose fault is it then?

So, do you mean to say that web browsers are rated/benchmarked with how 
they render/work with Tiny MCE?

There are millions of web sites in this world some not working with IE, 
some not working with Firefox, etc., and that doesn't mean they are crap.

I wonder which one of the two is really 'standards compliant' - or even what the 
'standards really are'.

who said safari is crap? I have just stated a fact - safari doesnt do  
javascript well and doesnt do ajax at all. And doesnt do tiny_mce.  
Fullstop. period. Konq doesnt do ajax. fullstop. On the the other  
hand konq's rendering of indic is great, safari's rendering of tamil  
fonts is sensational. Whereas default firefox doesnt know left from  
right in rendering indic. Note: I didnt say firefox is crap. I just  
say it doesnt know left from right in rendering indic. I leave rating/ 
benchmarking to people better qualified than me - all i do is report  
my observations.

*real* programmers use markdown or markup. But *real* programmers  
dont have to face doze weenies as clients who want to cut and paste  
their content from word or excel. I dont think tiny_mce meets *real*  
programming standards, but then ...

                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Safari does better JavaScript than IE and is even W3C DOM compliant.  It 
has support for native XmlHTTPRequest object, which means it does do Ajax.

If you don't believe Safari supports Ajax, check the following page:

Please get your facts straight.

Hi,

CCavenue is charging 7% as transaction charges and this is just very high I
guess whereas Google checkout/PAYPAL is charging just 2%.
Is it because of high costs / taxes that are associated in establishing
payment gateway in India?

 As you are asking for sources.list file, i presume that u already use
apt-get install for installing packages, and that you mean to ask "How to
find the best set of mirrors for you".. use apt-spy..

It is BETA software, so expect it to have bugs.
Firefox and IE too had equally serious bugs with their 2.0 and 7.0 releases.

Again, I'm not a die-hard fan of Apple or Safari, but I'm saying all 
these browsers have their own list of bugs.

Kenneth,

Check out the latest version of Safari. I just downloaded it and gave it a
spin.

I am able to access Gmail using it and it seems to work fine. I composed a
new email and was able to attach a file and have that uploaded using AJAX.
I used google docs to edit a spreadsheet and though the message that
Safari is not supported does popup, it seemed to work fine.

I also tested this on meebo.com which uses a lot of AJAX and it works well
there too.

There may still be some issues which I will keep a look out for. I tried
using Zimbra and it did not work.

I am not sure I like the non-standard look and feel of the application
(looks like Quicktime), but it seems to work well thus far. Also, it seems
to be surprisingly fast but I haven't timed it using any tool, so this
could just be a.

This is perhaps an improvement over the version of Safari you have.

regards,
Prem

I proposed him gambas. But, some one told me, monodevelop is better than
gambas.
I googled for this, but didnot get nice answer. So, if anyone of you works
on gambas/monodevelop, can tell me the real thing.
So, friend, What do you say? which one is really better and nice for a

Hi,
 VB.NET part of Mono is not yet integrated into Monodevelop. VB.NET compiler
and run-time are being continuously developed and if required, you can get
commercial support too, from Novell.

Hello,

I just wanted to chime here and say that I have an eMac at home running 
Safari 1.3.x, and it supports Ajax.

XmlHTTPRequest support has been with Safari since version 1.2.

http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html

Certain web sites might not have been tested with Safari/Opera which 
does not mean they don't support Ajax, instead its a problem with the 
web site trying to use browser specific code.

I hosted http://saeiis.org with lunarpages.com
I installed joomla via alfresco.

Then, I want to edit ?a CSS file in the browser itself.

I goto file manager, select the proper file and click "edit file".

The file opens in another window.

After entering the text, I click "Save".
It takes very long time.

But it is not saved. ?
It shows the error like "This page cannot be showed"

What to do?

Help me.

My internet connection is fine. I can use gmail and other mails. can attach 
files in gmail.

Like this, In Joomla ?also, I can not add any content via browser. as 
administrator.

This is a serious problem. Please help me.



The wonder here is, 
The client office is at Chetpet.
They have Airtel broadband.
I can not edit the joomla in their office.
But I can  edit the joomla in my room, office and other browsing centers.

What may be the problem?

Let us call the i/fs eth0 and eth1. Write a bash script to check
reachability of the gateway of provider 1 thro' eth0 and provider 2
thro' eth1 using ping. Based on the return value of the command (true/ 
false), clear and redefine the default route as either single hop via 
the link that is up or as a multiple nexthop default route via both 
interfaces. Run this via cron every 3 minutes or as frequently as you 
think is needed.

This works well.

Julian's stuff is for the strong hearted IMHO. In the recent past, many 
on LARTC have reported problems with JA's patches on different kernel 
versions. What I sent is more generic and granularity in cron interval 
decides max connection/ route downtime. A large percentage of 
applications/ users are willing to restart connections without 
persistence and for them this works well (me included).

I patched them with Red Hat AS3 2.4 Linux kernels. Some features were
backported from 2.6, so I used JA's 2.6 patches, and it worked fine
for heavy traffic loads.

Sure. I guess it depends on the network traffic.

If you can, install FreeNX! a great alternative to  VNC.  It  works  by
using SSH.

The deb-src lines are not needed if you don't ever download the Debian
source packages. They just cause more bytes to be downloaded. Matter
especially if you use a broadband metered by the byte.

Also, ftp.iitm.ac.in does not have any sources. For the deb-src, use
ftp.xx.debian.org, where xx is replaced by a country having a
full-fledged Debian mirror, like us, jp, de etc.

M$ VB is a fairly comprehensive development environment. Both Gambas
and Mono are under development and I wouldn't recommend both for
serious projects. For those looking at an alternative to VB, I would
recommend Python + GTK/wxWidgets. But the database part is not so well
integrated - like in GUI drag and drop.

I have writen an app in PyGTK which is ~ 100K lines with "GNOME Print"
reporting and all. Ofcourse, there was a team in 'I'. It was easy to
develop and manage. Most of the folks working on the project were
"rescued" VB programmers. I continue to believe there was the same
level of productivity as in VB.

I have had a look at stuff like Boa Constructor, but the best way is
to use Glade and vi/emacs to code these applications. And in terms of
feature support, Python beats VB hands down - there is a huge
collections of support libraries.

Things that VB veterans will miss are DB integration and Crystal Reports.

Hi

If it is ok with you, you can go for hardware appliance, which is also using
Linux inside. If you need more information, then I can pass it on to you the
full details as I am working for this company.

Sorry for giving a hardware solution but as that appliance is also using
Linux I am posting it here.

translation is quite innacurate. For 'patent'  
????????? is not the correct word. If you can spare  
the time, come across here and we can sit and rectify the translation

Good start, keep going.

Sorry, I do not have proper tools to point out this directly in Tamil
but still felt it is needed:

 Or suggest me any manuals & user groups where I can get all of those

Hello all...

One of my friend is trying to download Fedora Core 7 from last few weeks,
but he is getting the worst speed from that site. I think that`s the
official site of FC7 and as he told me, though many people are downloading
from that mirror, so the speed is slow.... i don`t know...

So, can you please provide me any other mirror from where we can download
FC7 with greater speed?

mirrors.kernel.org is one of the fastest I have seen. Try the following

the problem is that all these mirrors also host every other distro -  
so if today it is overloaded with fedora downloaders, tomorrow it  
will be the next version of ubuntu and the next day sid ... you just  
have to live with it

Am trying to get all my requirements met on Ubuntu Feisty. Have a few 
issues. RTM and STW did not yield much. Many report problems.
1. Want to communicate to my mobile phone (Moto L6) using bluetooth. 
Used bluez and could not get it connect. Installed kbluetoothd. It 
recognises the phone, asks for passkey, pairs and then disconnects 
immediately.
2. I connected the Moto using a data cable and it showed up as ACM0 in 
the device list. kmobiletools however was not able to discover it and 
explicit config to connect via ACM0 salso returned error "phone not found".

Has anyone done this successfully. Need pointers. TIA

be aware that upgrade installs of F7 over FC5/FC6 are badly broken - check
out Bugzilla for the list of bugs connected to this. If you're on FC3/4/5, I
strongly recommend that you stay at those releases - they're rock solid in
comparison to F7.

Tried torrents? Torrents should give you good speeds specially when a distro has
just released.

Subject: [Ilugc] Beryl issues in Kubuntu 7.04
Message-ID: <4674032C.4040908@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using Beryl with Kubuntu 7.04. 

   1. I have Firefox (2.0.0.4) related issues with you tube webpage. 
      When watching Youtube vidoes, if I pause a playing video or click
      on a new video when playing a video my firefox hangs and a dark
      shade comes over firefox.  I have to kill the firefox instance. 
      The problem is present only when Beryl.  If I switch to KWin
      window manager, the problem is not there.
   2. I  get a black screen when multiple window are opened.  The window
      bar is visible but the window is black.  Once I minimize all the
      windows and open one window, the problem is not there.  I am not
      sure if the problem is due to some option being enabled in Beryl. 
   3. I have applications open (konsole, firefox, thunderbird etc) when
      using Beryl.  When I switch from Beryl to KWin, the applications
      are not visible.  When I try Alt+Tab, I get a message "No windows
      open".  Switching back to Beryl, I am able to see all the
      applications again.

Any pointers in resolving the above problems would be very helpful.

I don't have much idea on that. But, mentioning your graphics
adaptor and whether you are using aiglx or xgl will be useful.
I believe there was such a bug with nvidia and beryl.

The Dark Shade means Firefox is stuck in a loop somewhere and not 
responding. It will go away after sometime once Firefox decides to 
listen to user input again.  Beryl has a setting somewhere which darkens 
windows when apps dont respond for sometime. It is also entirely 
possible that Beryl is just giving trouble due to a bug.

The non-free repositories of Debian will have the nvidia drivers. Enable 
them in synaptic and search for nvidia. You need the legacy driver 
package since your card is not supported by the latest drivers.

For Fedora you can try the experimental nouveau driver. It is installed 
but disabled by default. If it is unstable which is very likely, then 
use the drivers from rpm.livna.org . Once again you need the legacy drivers.

Your card may be too old for Compiz or Beryl since support for OpenGL 
extensions needed by them was added in a new nividia driver. Then you 
only hope will be the nouveau project.

Senthil

I used moto4lin and it worked fine.
Was able to transfer images and sounds.

Use apt-get to install moto4lin.

incidently it is not a good idea to insert images in mail - a lot of spam
filters will zap your mail - same goes for sending html mail

Yes. I remember seeing it in last foss.in DVD.  I think Shanu (cced
here) created that DVD.

Shanu,

 Can you tell Shiva how you made it?

I have installed and loaded nvidia-kernel-legacy modules by using

In addition nvidia-glx-legacy nvidia-glx-legacy-dev

On my debian, my nvidia GPU would work only with nvidia-glx and
nvidia-kernel and not the nvidia-*-legacy packages. Not sure of the
reason, but might work for you also!

Even after that, I don't think plain the Riva TNT2 can do Beryl,
Compiz etc. since the driver didn't support the Composites
extension. Is that correct even now?

Thanks.

I actually meant, the last time I checked, it didn't work. Is that
true even now?

It gets the direct rendering right. But even glxgears --info might
free the screen. So, it occasionally works and fails sometime else.
The issue could be with my onboard card, though!

And, i never got beryl/compiz working for the same reasons above.

Well, I didn't have too many problems with the OpenGL part and could
play all those 3D games with it quite all right. But I still am unsure
of the Composites extension which is needed for Beryl.

And, in general, (to others), please avoid nVidia if you can, while
purchasing new hardware. I have had a bad experience with their
proprietary stuff for Linux.

Have you checked ~/Desktop folder if the files are still there
or not?
Maybe he just disabled the icons on Desktop so you can't
see them.

Several steps:

1. unmounted my home partition
2. check if there is any error with fsck
3. got my stuff in /lost+found
4. make another desktop directory
5. copy all things from /lost+found to desktop directory

And that`s all

My reference app is Motorola Phone Tools (like Oxygen fpr Nokia)

I checked moto4lin. It looks like the p2kcommander on windows. I tried
kmobiletools, wammu and moto4lin with a data cable. wammu interface is
the best and looks like kmobiletools0.5 also will look like wammu.
moto4lin looks like a filemanager utility and since it supports reboots,
refresh of flex etc, it will work only with a data cable. moto4lin does 
not seem to have the interface to manage phonebook, message stores etc.

Using data cable, I'm able to see (in wammu and kmobiletools) SMS and
phonebook - my primary purpose was to do this using BT. Kbluetoothd
shows up in the task bar. hcitool scan discovers the phone too. OBEX
works. But device manager does not show a BT serial device which is what
all these s/ws use. Any pointers.

Message-ID: <98a95a0706190731x79ee14b2tefaa41460fc6f3bb@mail.gmail.com>

I was running a Debian Sarge-XP dual boot system until recently, when a
silly re-install of XP without precautions caused grub to be erased. After
trying out some things unsuccesfully to recover grub, I decided to install
Etch with the 3 DVDs. However, I find I cannot see the available partitions
during the manual partition step. All I see is the entire hard drive (80 GB)
which is partitioned eventually into 78.5 and 1.5 swap. I have 3 Windows
drives and one with Debian.

Hi,

 Try doing Alt+F2 and execute
 # fdisk /dev/<whatever> -l
 If you still see only 2 partitions then face it ! you have lost the
partition and now this is all you have ! hope you had backedup the data 
 If you can see the partitions, other than the two you have specified
then most probably the parition manager is showing the status of an
auto-partition layout whihc is not written to disk until you confirm. 
(PS: You can even mount and see mountbale partitions by creating dirs
in /tmp in the rescue shell - Alt+F2 )

Not possible, since I can see them all when I use a live CD. I'll try fdisk

Instead of ip address you can put mac based authentication.

Or better still username + password combo authentication

That way even if one of your employees gets the CEO's laptop for a while 
he cant use it to browse porn sites that you have banned :)

1. Do you have samba installed?
2. Is smbmount in your path?

Do a "which smbmount" and see what you get

Yes, I think there is no smbmount in recent versions of commonly used
distros. check the cifs option.

yeah got it fixed Udhay,
its the the localhost resolving problem. 
i have appended "127.0.0.1 localhost" to the file /etc/hosts
and can now start the postgresql server..

actually i was working on a remote system with the -X switch of ssh. but i wasn't able to launch any of the Xwindows say [xmessage "hi"]. but after adding this line i could launch x also..

Hi,
       I`m using Feisty Fawn. I have an internet connection via 
ethernet. This connection used to auto-start on boot-up in  Dapper, but 
is not doing so in Feisty. I have to click an icon that appears near the 
System time display and click "Wired" Connection to start it up. Is 
there any way to make it auto-start on boot-up? I searched on the forums 
to no avail.

Just check whether the "auto eth0" line exists in
/etc/network/interfaces file.

Then I guess it's a bug. Does it resemble this?:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3/+bug/112590

If it is, then it doesn't seem to have been solved yet. See the link
in that page as well to another person's problems.

I was playing FreeCiv today and thought of similar game in business
strategy. I google and found this http://www.industryplayer.com

Since I am doing my MBA, I think these kind of games will be helpful.

hi,

Try CCK for creating custom nodes.

Or you can use
Projects like 'Drupaled'  - Drupal for Education that can help you.

Hi,

You can try sysfs and proc file system combined to get the information

1. /sys/block/sda
   read all sda* directories using readdir (this gives all the
   partitions in the sda disk (man readdir)

2. now using that list go one by one into the induvidual directories
   /sys/block/sda1/
   There is a file start. That contains the start sector of the
   partition 
   There is a file size. That is the size (in number of sectors)
   so End sector = <start> + <size> -1 
3. The number of blocks of that parition can be got
    from /proc/partitions

4. continue for all other values in the struct dirent 

If the partition number is <5 then it is safely a primary parition
and anything >= 5 is extended partition.

Is there any other easier method to do this ? i think i am complicating
things toomuch and it must not be so tough to get the information in
linux.


OR

you can use fdisk ( popen to fdisk and then send the command 
  "fdisk -l" )

Message-ID: <406f1f3f0706241019j39c366d4vab394f3da8b78e3b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I have been installing ubuntu on all the PCs sold from my firm
(www.zyxware.com). I have also been distributing ubuntu CDs for people
who expressed interest in trying it out. However I have had people
come back and tell me that they were not able to play mp3s and vcds.
For the systems installed at my firm we updated systems with all
additional packages. But for people who installed ubuntu at home and
who do not have an internet connection how do I solve the issue. I was
wondering if I could have something like the nullsoft installer for
windows do the trick. Get all additional packages and package using an
installer with the required scripts to install and then send it via a
cd which the user can use for a 1 click install. I found
autopackage.org - something similar to nullsoft after some googling. I
wanted to confirm if this was the best and most scalable approach that
I am taking. Have any of you done this kind of stuff?
Cheers
Anoop

One way I can think of is -
1) Do a clean install of ubuntu
2) Download all the required packages using apt
3) So, all the downloaded packages will be left in
/var/cache/apt/archive folder, I believe.
4) You can install apt-on-cd, it will create an ISO file of
the downloaded packages.
5) Now you can burn this to a CD/DVD and give it to those
who need it. All the dependencies will be fulfilled, too.
6) When the customer puts the CD/DVD in the drive,
Ubuntu will automatically ask to add that CD/DVD to the
apt sources.

NOTE :- This is known to work with Feisty. Haven't tried it
on other versions. But, I don't see any reason not to, unless
apt-on-cd doesn't work on those versions.

Hi,

I had changed my default web browser from konqueror to firefox.  Still 
when I click a link it keeps opening in konqueror. My default applcation 
on System setting --> Default Application --> Web Browser shows for http 
& https url use 'firefox'.

Also only few options like email client, web browser, IM, Terminal 
Emulator are available for change in System setting --> Default 
applications.  How do I change for the rest like associations with mp3, 
pdf etc.

Thanks Bhasker !!!

I am also looking for the file system type(ext3, FAT, etc).. I know
these can be obtained from the /proc/mounts but that gives only the
mounted partitions. Is there any other way to get it?

ioctl ???

Thanks,
Senthil

It is looking for GTK+ version 1.2, not GTK +2.x. Install the older gtk 
package and it will work fine.

Will it create any problem if i install the older one rather than newer one?
I mean, the older one may solve my current problem but how about any
software which needs the 2.0?

You are making a false assumption that you can't install multiple libraries.

Applications can be built by linking with different libraries. That is
how developers test them for various builds.

Just like you can have multiple kernels, or different gcc versions
installed, you can have different library versions installed.

fonts are no more a pre-requisite with utf-8 inplace. if the browser u use
is not rendering tamil scripts properly please raise a bug against it.  that
will help us a lot.

2) he doesn't understand tamil.


please ignore such mails..

when more techies, speaking Tamil comes forward to write in Tamil also..

this group may not be a place for discussions in Tamil...

till thats happens, I am sorry... I humbly apologize... no other go..

cool maame..

cool as in Sivaji ;-)

Message-ID: <46809F9E.9010700@gmail.com>

Hello folks,

I have been in a bit of turmoil over redesigning my product's ui 
(http://www.bioask.com). While the existing UI works just ok, I need to 
migrate to a better framework that allows separation of content from the 
templates, multilanguage support, authentication/authorization, access 
as REST/SOAP etc. One important non-functional requirement is that I 
need to be able to find talent locally.

I have been looking at Django and Smarty.  I am pretty impressed by 
Django and its features. However, we have been doing things in php for 
quite some time and I am afraid of the learning curve to be productive. 
I have found that the first page is the easiest to develop.. but when 
you go beyond what the framework needs, it creates a lot of issues. For 
eg, I do not know if I can create my own object and pass it as a data 
object in Django (since we do not use databases)

If you have experience in any of these frameworks, I would like to hear 
your comments on this. I would also know if there are any local 
consultants/webdesign shops who can help me get started fast.

Vaidhy

Any kind of framework comes with bells and whistles and might not fit 
exactly into a requirement.  These frameworks are so generalized that it 
has many overheads to be used in a production scenario.

PHP by itself is a scripting language with support for template 
processing.  You have HTML as the template, CSS for styling, JavaScript 
for behaviour, and PHP for the business logic.

All you need to do is to design your application such that you separate 
the business logic from the presentation.

So, IMO Smarty or anything is not needed, because its trying to be a 
template management system on top of a template system like PHP.

Have you considered Ruby on Rails? If you're not particular about going 
PHP or Python, Rails offers a handsome alternative, and getting started 
is pretty fast. There are several Rails shops in Chennai, and  if you 
have any doubts about the framework itself, you will get a lot of advice 
for free on this list:

Hope to see you there :)

Being a Python fan myself, I would like to suggest TurboGears. Seems 
like the latest version supports Python 2.5. If you are comfortable with 
Python and your only need is separation of concerns then TG might work 
out for you.

But then frankly speaking, getting started with Rails was lot easier and 
lot more fun than with TG. Now that I have seen a bit of both of these 
frameworks, IMHO, Rails is the way to go.

hi,
 i have installed debain etch on my laptop (HP Compaq nx6110).
i was not able to monitor/check my battery power.

my battery charge applet always shows " System is running on battery power (0 minutes 0% remaining) " all time. 

Name of the applet : Battery Charge Monitor 2.14.3
on clicking about it says:
This utility shows the status of your laptop battery.

Legacy (non-HAL) backend enabled.

how to view by battery status now??

Well.. i thought the outputs of these 2 commands should be enough to give a
solution if one exists.. I've already called the vendor 3 times.. and since
there's no windose on this machine.. that guy escapes everytime by saying
linux doesn't support all this ..

what command to add to get the network to restart.

Sorry for the late response. Being a linux newbie, I am not very sure 

what command to add to get the network to restart.check the file /etc/network/interfaces

if  it doesn't contain any line as
auto eth0

jus add the interface corresponding to the wired connection,  have attached my settings

iface eth2 inet dhcp
auto eth2

 
try restarting and check if the connection gets up automatically,
else 

The chkconfig command can be used to activate and deactivate services.

Those lines already exist in my interfaces file.

I've  had similar issues with  my ubuntu  ( fiesty).  My  adsl  connection
wouldn't  work  automatically  after  boot.  What i had done to get it work
automatically was to disable the ethernet interfaces  by deselecting eth0
in  System - > Administration -> Network window and saving the settings.
Hope this helps.

1. create a file in any editor by name "S99xxxx"  (starting with capital
S , keep 99 , replace xxxx with any name)

2. add the following lines to it

#!/bin/sh
/etc/init.d/networking  restart

3. chmod +x  S99xxxx

4. sudo su  , provide your own password

5. cp  S99xxxx  /etc/rc3.d/

restart the machine and check if its working

Thanks for the reply. I tried doing what you suggested but my Network 
window doesn't have any options for disabling the ethernet interface( or 
i cant find how to! ). I`m using GNOME on Feisty Fawn.

I'm using the same. To disable , uncheck the box next to the "Wired
Connection ...eth0. " .

Just tried that. What happens is It shows as connected ( under Manual 
Configuration ), but i cant use the net at all. Only when i tick back 
"Wired Connection" and select it , do i get internet.

all the scripts in each of the rcX/ directories get executed
sequentially. so if you put something starting with S01xxxx would get
executed before s02xxxx and so on. S99 should execute at the end of
starting up all the scripts in runlevel 3. Apparently, runlevel 3 starts
all the networking services.

yes.. you are right about utf-8 dependencies on fonts. but why would u
call this situation a bug in browser? browser understands utf-8 but
just doesn't have the resources to display it.. which includes OS
support & fonts installed in it. Isn't it? Please correct me if I am
wrong.

<quicktips>
Dont add inline javascript anywhere .Decide what the scope of your server
side is ,and the scope of your chosen js framework .So that once you know
that the content is delivered,then work on adding the styles in a seperate
file, javascript that starts off with a clean sheet (aka DOM ) to play
around with. Basically get the serverside to just do whats its best at -
spit out content from your data sources . Dont mix behaviour ,ui with that .
That way you even have an edge suppose javascript is disabled . You can have
flexibility such that adding script1 will produce behaviour and ui1 . while
adding js script2 will result in behaviour2. It might sound like its a
little over-engineered , but i think from what you've told us - you can take
a 'bunch of leaves' from the architecture of a wikipedia page.

You also need to say NO to code snippets all over your site ,that will be
used only once . hacks are nice, but not as a design pattern. The moment you
write javascript code that is reusable and is generic ,you have yourself a
framework.And that's the sinngle most coveted asset in a web framework .
Resuability . I've tried out popular javascript frameworks (even authored
one myself called 'reusable' ) and have found that for production code - YUI
to be the best documented , and plug-and-play friendly to extend, add your
own functions on top of the framework et cetera. There are tons of ways to
brighten up the page, but down the line maintainability is something you
need to protect your site from . Maintainability from developers changing
hands, compatability across browsers, as well as a decent community for
support and documentation.

I just wrote a post on some useful javascript resources after i saw your
message. Maybe ,you could have a look at it sometime . its over at
http://bosky101.blogspot.com/2007/06/top-5-must-read-javascript-resources.html

IMO u dont need to change the language you are comfortable with( tats your
strength ). And also will be reinventing the wheel if you are switching any
language. Mostly the current code will be tested and will just work but if
you change the language u ll have to do that all over again....
may be you can just look at the most important parts of the code which will
get changed regularly, and refactor it and make it more maintainable... you
can go for solid clientside framework such as YUI (as bhasker suggested)...
besides its a bit easy to develop in php and also getting people is not tat
tough....

Vaidhyanathan:

To add on to that, it also helps to have accessible web sites.  This is 
because screen readers get the plain version of the page, without 
JavaScript.

Hi,   
    The Linux kernel Version 2.6.21 is more power
efficient with what is known as 'tickless' kernel.
Improvements of 15 to 25% have been obtained.
 For more...

Fedora 7 uses this kernel...
Interesting developments, especially on the mobile

I ,somewhat recently, was tasked with giving a face lift to a site
that was done in perl...at first I wanted to keep it in perl but get
it into a MVC framework...so, the only thing available is/was
Catalyst...but I decided to keep looking and did a small project with
Catalyst, TGears, and Rails...decided to stick with rails...not
knowing ruby was a worry at first but I have found that not only has
it not been a problem it has been a great experience...I have found
the language (and rails) to suit my thinking very well...not being
able to reuse some of the old perl code allowed me to rethink problems
and come up with more elegant solutions...I have become a ruby (and
rails) convert in the process...the community around the language and
the framework have been very impressive...YMMV, it may not suit your
needs, just thought I would share my experience

I use Opensuse 10.2 on my Acer travelmate 2413. Although everything works
for me ( including Hibernate and Stand By )experienced problems with my
Wi-fi card. I rarely use it so thats not a concern for me can get it working
using Ndiswrapper. Bit sceptic if the integrated camera works with Opensuse.

you can look at the hardware compatibilty list here with Opensuse

Makes no sense, but I'll respond with something equally flippant:

hey,

try this, save the content as .html and open it... (check browser's encoding
in utf-8)

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
</head>
UTF: &#2980;&#2990;&#3007;&#2996;&#3021;
<br>
Tamil text: ?????
</html>

i came to know what we need is a "unicode capable browser".. ie5, firefox 2
etc., ie4 will have problems..

i tried it at my office.. sorry to quote it here.. since its windows
related.. windows comes with default tamil font "latha".. deleted it..

opened few sites http://www.ubuntu-tam.org

the text was rendered properly without any problem.. same should hold good
for others too...

> but why would u call this situation a bug in browser?

previously in dapper we had this "pango" issue.. pango is rendering engine
included in firefox to display characters.. which includes tamil also...

it was not enabled by default.. installing tamil-language-pack did it... or
exporting it helped the cause..

the problem is not now in Edgy..

also the same problem u can notice if u install "firefox" in windows and
open the tamil site mentioned above... then i tried setting up environment
varibale..

din't remember exactly..
http://www.nongnu.org/sinhala/doc/howto/sinhala-howto.html should help..

some problem of this kind.. i mentioned please raise a bug...

Visit http://europa.eu/

I doubt whether i have all europian language fonts displayed there are
installed in my pc.. but i believe (though i do not know all the languages)
from the appearance and clarity, that they are rendered and displayed
properly..

these things i gathered based on my usage experience.. techinically some one
who knows a browser's internal has to reply...

Uh-huh. Daily? Also, isn't that a decision for them to make? A startup 
is a place that is _supposed_ to be quick to change direction when 
something is not working for them. If there's a toolkit/framework that 
significantly decreases to your time to market and simplifies your code 
base, I don't see a reason why they can't re-write the app. This has 
been done many times, by the likes of Reddit, so I'm rather surprised at 
your opinion.

Please tell me. I don't know the rest. Apart from the fact that they're 
slickly packaged, I don't see any part that's not factual about the videos.

Sure you don't.  Just don't make off-the-cuff remarks like "it's easy to 
develop in php" (compared to what?) and "getting people is not that 
tough". I find that a rather strange attitude to take in a startup - 
good people are always hard to find.

Getting the right kind of developers is extremely tough. Let me just 
point out what I mean by the right kind..
I actually wrote a really long reply and realized that Marc Andrerssen 
summarized it into his post..

http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/how_to_hire_the.html


Reinventing from scratch is not something that should be done at a 
whim.. However, as the business model changes and our potential 
customers change, we need to change the way the results are presented, 
enable remote searches through REST API, aggregate results from various 
sources etc.. and all these require significant UI rework.. To repeat 
Vamsee's comment, if it leads to more maintainable code base, and faster 
development cycles, I will consider it..

Regards,
Vaidhy

PS: We still are looking to hire the "right kind" of developers :)

Hi Vaidhy,
    I tried CakePHP. Its more like Django for PHP. If you remember I was 
asking you few months back why we did not look at CakePHP/Django/ROR 
while we started.  You can stick with current PHP code and slow start 
using CakePHP. Its quite active, any given time you can find 30 people 
in #cakephp.

Thanks

ever tried hiring people...if u did u ll know wat i meant....and i never

something is always better than nothing....even for php ( i say this because
php has been there for quite a while and not because its a very great
language or anything) we have a hard time finding people ...

Have Ubuntu Feisty Fawn on my Dell NB. Have installed ffmpeg and

clip, move windows etc, the video blanks out while the player sliders 
keeps moving. Restarting the clip solves the problem.

Has anyone else faced this problem? Is it due to beryl?

some more ponderings : for a product dev, would you consider hiring many cheap resources(read 'people/coders')  or few expensive resources.

When i mean cheap here , i am referring to technologies that are prevalent and expensive are those that are not often used. For eg. you may consider an analogy between hiring many JSP resources or few Rails (or JSF) resources. Which is a better option? [ i dont want managerial answers :P ]

>   

I'm always partial to the latter approach - especially for product 
development. I guess you can't really avoid hiring a lot of people when 
you are doing consulting as you need to expand as the clients grow.  As 
you expand, quality control becomes harder. But when you're doing 
product development, I really don't see the point of hiring a lot of 
developers. Hire a few good ones, and they'll do the work of many 
mediocre ones, only better.

Of course, hanging on to talent is hard, and you have to pamper them 
with lots of perks. But I guess that is par for the course, especially 
if you hope to make good money from the product (or have a really rich 
VC ;-).

This much is true - you can't mix a few good ones and a lot of mediocre 
ones and hope to make something out of it - the good ones will soon 
reach for the exits. I have seen this happen quite a few times, 
irrespective of the kind of software they are working on.

> When i mean cheap here , i am referring to technologies that are prevalent and expensive are those that are not often used. For eg. you may consider an analogy between hiring many JSP resources or few Rails (or JSF) resources. Which is a better option? 

You mean to say - should you go for "new and expensive" technologies 
like Rails (because of the dearth of programmers) or stick to tried and 
tested, where you don't have to pay as much, and find programmers aplenty.

Well, as they say, there are programmers who are easily 10x more 
productive than others. Mostly, they are not paid 10x more than others. 
I would say, find a few like those, pay them double the market rate, and 
you still got a good deal. I have worked at only one place which 
actually practiced something close to this, and I still remember it as 
an amazing place to work for (which didn't work ultimately because of 
the unwieldy technology, that's a related, but different story).

As for my current company, it's a one man army so far and the product is 
still in prototype stage, so I can't say I have applied all this. But 
with my experience gained till now, this is what I intend to follow.

> [ i dont want managerial answers :P ]

Hope I didn't give any ;-).

I think good programmers can adapt to any language. So, if I see someone
good even in .NET, I still would like to take them in and make them learn
Ruby/Python/Perl .... whatever the demands are! Of course there will be an
initial learning curve when they begin in a new language but it is far far
less steeper than for some one who knows a language in depth but cannot
think logically!

So, hire good programmers (problem solvers) irrespective of their technology
exposure. Am talking from experience. It works!

Very true. I cannot but think of a typical Dilbert scenario - maggots all around!

For a 'programmer', language aint a constraint, but for a coder it is.
