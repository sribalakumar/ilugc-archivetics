Subject: [Ilugc] Robot programming in CBSE international curriculum
Message-ID: <CACqthKF6rH1_ix0=L2SR8inaikte7bLpVjjVjGM=+EmPihEi1Q@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,
CBSE has introduced the chapter "Programming a Robo" in their
international curriculum for IX & X, with the following topics :
1. ROBO Assembly
2. Programming a ROBO
3. TeProgramming a Robosting & debugging.
4. Prepare your ROBO Manual with applications.

The learning objectives are :
Assembling a ROBO
Programming a ROBO.
Testing and debugging a ROBO.

While there are proprietary packages & tools in these topics, there is
an interest to recommend FOSS based tools/packages/materials. [CBSE
has an objective to make the teaching-learning platform independent
and had introduced Linux, MySQL, etc., in the curriculum for ICT].

I would request those interested** -- with some expertise & exposure
-- to give suggestions re FOSS packages and tools. I would also like
to have an interaction with them and would request them to contact me,
preferably off the mailing list, thru my gmail id : srini dot it at
gmail dot com

thanks and best wishes

Subject: [Ilugc] Running apache on different port
Message-ID: <CAORyqANYwkgv7nnAH-smyAFtXSJsDTerVsyKkmGgEAPe5J-ttA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello friends,

 i am currently running a Red Hat 5.2 Linux server,
 i have the current scenario as
 we have a kerio mailserver running on this machine , it runs on port 80
 but i also want to run apache server simultaneously, so when i checked for
the status of the apache server
 it said that "httpd stopped",
 if i start the httpd service, i am sure that i there will be a  conflict.
 so in order to avoid this, i am planning to run the apache server at
different port say 81
( i think this can be setup by changing the Listen:80 to Listen:81 in the
httpd.conf file)
 but in that case the webpages will be served only when i explicitly
mention the port no as 81
 for eg:
    http://localhost:81
but what i want to do is that . i want to run apache server at port 81 and
want to access the pages without mentioning the port 81
 some thing similar to
   http://localhost

Is this possible..?

Thanks in advance.

Nope. In simple terms, the address bar format is 
"(protocol)://host[:port]". Port is optional if you are going to use the 
default port for the associated protocol such port 80 for http. If you 
don't use the default for the protocol, you have to explicitly specify it.

of their hunger strike to support annulment motion against IT Rules-2011
in Rajya Sabha. They sat
"We started this hunger strike on 2nd May and we will carry on until we get
any satisfactory response from the government and the opposition regarding
the annulment of IT Rules-2011"

http://kractivist.wordpress.com/2012/05/04/immediate-release-freedom-fast-third-day-of-hunger-strike-for-internet-freedom/

Please spread and create awareness, we will not get live media coverage for
this hunger strike, its up to us to raise voice for our freedom of speech.

https://code.google.com/p/autokey/

Autokey (aptitude install autokey-gtk or autokey-qt)

Autokey is the linux+X11+python equivalent of AutoHotKey (stuff that
newbies write malware with...more like prank software). Autokey is a
hotkey/phrase triggered automation tool. It allows you to automate anything
that you do manually with your keyboard and mouse. It is useful for both
the non-techie and techie uses of a computer.

Its most simple use which people would probably take advantage of almost
all the time is text expansion. Write a few characters, press space or
enter and autokey replaces ur trigger phrase with a larger chunk of text.
Why would you need this? Best example would be written correspondence.
Salutation, signature and sometimes even parts of the main body of a letter
or email could have oft-repeating chunks of text. Save time and energy on
typing by storing these text blocks in Autokey and assigning short keywords
or hotkey combinations. Having worked in a helpdesk environment I have
known how repetitive the emails can be.

A little more advanced usage of text expansion would be to also add in
keypresses that would do some action like sending the mail itself. As you
know almost everything can be done from the keyboard and what can be done,
can be automated.

The part of Autokey that i have not yet explored and this is like I guess
the raw power of it are its scripts. Autokey scripts are simply python
scripts with some GUI specific API functions. It's too hard to describe the
vast variety of possibilities when the whole desktop environment, the input
devices etc. are all controllable by a script.

Give it a try. Rarely these kind of tools are free on Windows and AHK is
nowhere near user-friendly.

I am not familiar with Kerio but why do you need to run a mail server
at port 80?
There are a couple of ways around to solve your problem.

Situation 1: If you have 2 separate domains or ip addresses then you
can set a firewall rule that if the request comes in on kerio.domain
then it goes to port 80 and if it comes in on http.domain(s) then go
to port 81. But, this can be a messy solution and should be avoided as
far as possible.

Situation 2: Run apache on port 80, run kerio on a port other than 80
and setup a virtual domain which points to that port. Examples of this
setup can be found here
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/examples.html#port. IMO, this
is a cleaner and easier to maintain/debug solution.

I think, they are talking about this,

http://www.mit.gov.in/sites/upload_files/dit/files/GSR314E_10511(1).pdf

It is a 4 page document so read it yourself and form your opinion.

IMO, to the most part the document is poorly written. It does not 
clarify many things when it comes to procedures, unless they are 
mentioned in the original IT act. I am no lawyer, so I don't know.

It is difficult to tell how these rules will play out, they might just 
collapse on themselves for not having any particular structure. 
Nevertheless, I am glad to hear there is an opposition for these rules.

They specifically claim it is so. The design was also reviewed in

Could someone please explain me what is the need for stunnel when we can
use ssh tunnel

$ssh -L 5555:localhost:2222 bala at somemachine.com

Here I tried to ssh to bala at somemachine.com and forwarded my localport 5555
to the somemachine.com's 2222.  I guess this is what even stunnel does.

The $50 hardware is from displaylink. The hardware design is fully closed.
The company did not provide documentation (Programmer's reference
manual) for the hardware. Without that open source drivers could not be
written. 2 people from open source community analysed the data that is
transferred from OS to device and found out how to program the device. Once
they released the info on how to program the hardware displaylink came up
with the docs (which was essentially what the open source guys already
found). The doc is not complete I guess as it does not provide full info -
there is some compression being used the details of which is not exposed by
the company (and not yet found by analysing the data).

I have never used stunnel but stunnel is an SSL wrapper around
insecure applications.

It will not do port forwarding like ssh.

Port forwarding is done by people like ssh, qemu, netcat, socat and so on.

stunnel will not do it.

Of course firewalls also do that.

It is job of firewalls actually which rewrite packet headers.

In the case of the above mentioned applications they setup listeners
and connect using TCP or UDP
 sockets to create the illusion of packet header rewriting.

Whereas stunnel only creates an SSL wrapper to secure braindead old
insecure wire protocols.

AFAIK, stunnel is used to add SSL functionality to any plain text 
protocol. For example, let us say, you run a web server on port 80. Now 
to make you website secure, you can either configure the webserver to 
run on ssl port 443 as well (or) run stunnel on 443 and configure it to 
forward to port 80 on localhost.

About 3 yrs back, I had benchmarked stunnel vs SSH tunnel for securing 
data transmission. I remember concluding that stunnel was crap and 
suggested SSH tunnel. It didn't fly with the security team though for 
SSH connection can support multiple channels which is a potential 
security risk (indeed!). Anyways, in the end, we encrypted the data 
ourselves instead of using either of these.

If we make stunnel to run on port 443 to forward connections to port 80 of
the http server locally.  Will the client have problem speaking with
stunnel ?

run stunnel on 443 and configure it to
forward to port 80 on localhost.

I did not understand this point, can you kindly explain more.

SSH connection can support multiple channels which is a potential
security risk (indeed!)

Thanks a lot in advance.

The client shouldn't have any problem since stunnel will handle the SSL 
handshake/encryption while the HTTP protocol will be handled by your 
webserver over the forwarded connection.

CLIENT <----http/ssl/tcp---> STUNNEL <-----http/tcp-----> WEBSERVER

NOTE: Read http/ssl/tcp as "HTTP over SSL over TCP"

While using OpenSSH forwarding, you might notice that you are able to 
work on a shell as well as support forwarding of multiple connections, 
even though, the OpenSSH client has established only one connection to 
the remote host (OpenSSH server). This is because the SSH protocol 
defines Channels/Session to keep track of various tasks.

Security problem arises because the protocol does not define any 
restriction on opening a channel. Which means, throughout the lifetime 
of the TCP connection, a channel can be opened for any of the tasks. 
OpenSSH have extended the protocol which sends a message 
no-more-sessions to indicate no more channel open requests but when 
forwarding this cannot be done because you need to accept new 
connections to be forwarded.

No worries if you are unable to clearly understand the above para. It is 
a little technical. In general, OpenSSH is highly secure but security is 
not absolute so you just need to go with what you think is acceptable 
for you.

Subject: [Ilugc] Who is the user that runs apache webserver ?
Message-ID: <CAND2796LDn+JBDaT891c1Ex6Hcu3Oq5_N045_nRQrHvgBDd-Eg@mail.gmail.com>

In my ubuntu 12.04 box, I run apache web server.

ps -ef | grep apache

root           31984     1     0 16:06 ?        00:00:00
/usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
www-data 31989 31984  0 16:06 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
www-data 31990 31984  0 16:06 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
www-data 31991 31984  0 16:06 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
www-data 31992 31984  0 16:06 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
www-data 31993 31984  0 16:06 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start

I think that www-data is the user that runs the apache webserver for security.
But, one thread of apache is owned by root.

What is the concept behind it?
Why root owns one thread?

It is mostly likely running in prefork model. In the following link, 
look at section "How it works".

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/prefork.html

The short answer to your question is to bind to privileged port 80.

Hi,

Replication:

Replication enables data from one MySQL database server (the master) to be replicated to one or more MySQL database servers (the slaves)
That means datas are mirrored in another instances by several time difference.


Clustering :

It is general concept of load balancing,traffic routing . In database if the situation of high query count ( as select ,update,delete ) database will not be accessible. Due to the reason of high availability and fault tolearance having cluster concept in MYSQL.

mysql cluster management - ndb version 7.2.5


Pl clarify...

Nonsense. Every process has 'start' in it. Go through the posted process output before commenting.

To answer the OP; the first apache process is started by root user. The remaining processes are spawned by apache user.

There is *no* hidden process, however a process ID could be consumed by 
a thread which will be displayed as LWP in ps output. Here is a simple 
example,

# Shows only the process listing.
$ ps -p 812
   PID TTY          TIME CMD
   812 ?        00:00:00 rsyslogd

# List both process and its threads
$ ps -Lp 812
   PID   LWP TTY          TIME CMD
   812   812 ?        00:00:00 rsyslogd
   812   814 ?        00:00:00 rsyslogd
   812   815 ?        00:00:00 rsyslogd
   812 26014 ?        00:00:00 rsyslogd

The IDs 814, 815 and 26014 correspond to threads so you cannot use ps -p 
to list them. A better way to find whether a process is running is to 
use kill -0 as mentioned below,

$ kill -0 813
bash: kill: (813) - No such process
$ kill -0 814
bash: kill: (814) - Operation not permitted
$ ps -p 814
   PID TTY          TIME CMD

Also, the process IDs run from 1 to 32767 and roll over, so don't be 
surprised if you see gaps. The gaps just indicate that those processes 
have exited.

Some security minded OSes like OpenBSD and patched Linux kernels do not
allocate PID sequentially but randomize it instead.

I am still under the impression that when we port forward only one client
can connect to the port forward at a time.

If you try it once, your impression will change. Port forwarding does 
work with multiple clients. If you find some discrepancies, provide us 
with some details.

Hi Shrini,

Here is the details,

Topic : Programming with libpcap
Description : libpcap is famous library used to capture packets going
through a network interface. It is the core part of 'tcpdump' network
utility. Also, it has been used by many famous applications like
'Wireshark', 'Snort', 'Scapy' etc.,

In this talk we will explore about howto write an application using
libpcap and the various use of filters available in libpcap to capture
specific packets.

Time : 30 mins

Links:
http://www.tcpdump.org/index.html/
http://www.manpagez.com/man/7/pcap-filter/
https://github.com/mohan43u/pcapstreamer/

About:
A linux programmer who is trying to fix his day-to-day issues by writing
code.

Message-ID: <CAOOX+q=r2ExMFMMQwN4-qN+tODjfUBfJ59vugV0JHk2CUXuTfg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a Nokia N900. As I could not login to the phone over 3G, I use
reverse ssh to login to the phone. I used to run the following command on
the phone

ssh -R 22222:localhost:22 poo at mywebserver

Now I will login to my webserver and run the following to login to N900

ssh user at localhost -p 22222

Now I want to login to my N900 and forward X from n900 and want to use it
in my desktop. Is there any way to do this? I have done this using xephyr
over normal ssh on my ubuntu pc. but I dont know how to do the same using
reverse ssh.

You don't have to worry about "n900". Just think of a pc behind firewall or
NAT and can not be port forwarded. We have to use reverse ssh to login to
the pc and want the X to be forwarded also. Thats it

Can you please help me? If there is some way other than using ssh please
let me know

Thanks in advance

What is reverse ssh? You mean remote port fwd?

Xephyr is actually Xnest which allows multiseat and is a X in X, that
is all I know.

I dunno how you used it to do X forward. Did you use the ssh -Y switch?

It is remote port fwd. I got it. You can easily tunnel X using the ssh
-Y switch.

How can that be a problem? Or did I misunderstand?

Say instead of running,

$ ssh -R 2222:localhost:22 you say

$ ssh -YR 2222:...

But this would forward from the N900 to the web server. You want it
from there to
here?

Okay let me think.

When you do ssh using this ssh port forwarding use the -Y switch.

Also make sure the option is enabled in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

 From my understanding, we have 3 systems here, a desktop, a webserver 
and N900. Correct me if i am wrong. I am assuming the desktop runs the 
X11 display which needs to be eventually forwarded to N900. The 
following commands should work,

[N900]$ ssh -R 22222:localhost:22 poo at mywebserver

[Desktop]$ ssh -t -X poo at mywebserver "ssh -X user at localhost -p 22222"

Hope this helps. Let me know if you face any problems.

Hi All,

I want to list the users belongs to particular group.

For this I executed the command  "grep -i groupname /etc/group" . This
shows entries only when the user is added as secondary group.

While searching the web , I found a command "members" with an option
--secondary for Debian based distros.

Is there any command  same as "members"  in redhat based distros ?

This would be a classic use case for awk. Split fields by colons and
then display all the fourth fields where the first field is the group
name:

awk 'BEGIN { FS = ":" } $1 ~ /powerdev/ { print $NF}' /etc/group

I can help further if needed.

Thanks.

Thanks Kumar & Naresh.for your reply.


My requirement has satisfied with the command lid -u -g groupname ,
which is listing all the members of that group (no matter primary
group or secondary group).


'Grep' ing the 4th field in /etc/groups will not list all the users of
that particular group.  Since it will give the list of members who are
all engaged this group as secondary group .

For Example : useradd  -G 1234 user1  --- > is having the entry in
4th field of /etc/groups Whereas useradd -g 1234 user1 --> is not
having the entry in 4th field of /etc/groups

Updating dynamic IP address in the DNS records using the nsupdate
command requires not
only technical knowledge but also other things like how to obtain the
zone's records and so on.

IPv4 address is becoming scarce and companies are charging 2.5k or 5k
per year for static
 IP but private enterprises are used to this. But all companies cannot
afford and I wonder
 how long this will go on.

I don't see any IPv6 being deployed and for a very long time to come
dynamic IPs are going to
 be a reality.

And if you run a VPN with multiple nodes how will you get to the node
without knowing the
static IP?

Of course you don't have one.

So?

Yes, you have to use dynamic DNS but that does not come free even from
dyndns.org.

The solution is to either pay someone to do your own.

Which is what I am planning to do.

After I get it going I will let you know.

Basically if you buy one domain, you can create 1000 subdomains for free.

And if you get access to the zone's records you can manipulate the way you want
 with UNIX.

Dyndns no longer accepts users for free accounts. There is just a 14
day free-trial that we can signup for if we give our credit card
details. Beyond the 14 days, the service can be used only by paying.
Discussing about dyndns is OT to this list. So let me stop here.

You don't need to install anything more, the header files are already
present inside the source code you downloaded. You just need to point
the drivers to the location of the source code.

Yes I understand that but I don't want to have the full source code
residing inside my root file system. Also I don't want to have the object
files (.o files) that are created as a result of compilation - I want to do
a 'make clean' or 'make mrproper'. Is it okay to do 'make mrproper' (or at
least 'make clean') and copy the source to /usr/src/linux-3.4-rc5 for
compiling out of tree modules?

Thanks,
Prasanna

I suppose you could search Google's indices for

You have a jQuery plugin

arrows and boxes

Does exactly what you want

It is too clever that makes you marvel at the creator's brain but well
it works and that is that.

Subject: [Ilugc] X forwarding over reverse ssh
Message-ID: <CAOOX+q=MPP+-8FveAxj1Nhw2YTHv1Fh0nGV7MMCKkph2eNRrrg@mail.gmail.com>

It seems my post didn't reach the mailing list. So I am reposting again.


> What is reverse ssh? You mean remote port fwd?

It is not exactly remote port fwd. It is binding remote ssh service in the
local port. I mean using -R switch in ssh.

I tried both -X and -Y but I can feel that it is not logical because I am
forwarding X over 3 machines. I will explain the problem clearly once again.
Assume the following.
 I have 3 machines.
1. protected pc - a pc behind firewall / NAT / router (so you can not
directly connect to this machine on any port.) - user name is
"poomalai_protected"
2. My desktop - In this machine I want to see the GUI apps / whole desktop
environment of "protected pc". User name is "poomalai_desktop"
3. My webserver - A hosted machine with ssh access. I can forward or use
any random port number in this machine. but I am not root in this machine.
(User name is "poo")
Here you could have correctly identified that "protected pc" is my N900

Now, the problem is I want to access "protected pc" from my desktop. I use
the following command on the protected pc

            ssh -R 22222:localhost:22 poo at mywebserver
Now the "protected pc" is logged in to my webserver and I run "top" command
to keep the ssh session alive. and leave the machine logged in to my web
server

Now I go to "My Desktop" and connect to the webserver as usual
            ssh poo at webserver

Once logged in, I run the following
            ssh poomalai_protected at protectedpc -p 22222

Now I get the bash and I can run commands on protected pc. But I could not
run any GUI apps.
I usually use Xephyr to run any GUI app or the whole desktop session when I
use straight ssh. That means I just use -X to connect to the machine I want
to connect and set DISPLAY env variable to the port where Xephyr is running
and GUI apps(like firefox, gedit etc) / the whole desktop session (if I use
xfce4-session in ssh) will be displayed inside the Xephyr window.

Now my question: Is there a way similar to this to forward X from my
"protected pc" to "web server" to "my desktop"?
I am open to use any program. You can suggest vnc or normal X forwarding or
anything. The objective is to access "protected pc" somehow. Thats it.
Please suggest opensource solutions alone. I am not interested in
teamviewer or something similar.
Can freenx be used to solve this problem? Any suggestions?

And 0, I tried your solution

 [N900]$ ssh -R 22222:localhost:22 poo at mywebserver
>
> [Desktop]$ ssh -t -X poo at mywebserver "ssh -X user at localhost -p 22222"


and got the following.
Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding.
ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
Connection to xxx.xxx.xxx.xx closed

Such things are not resolved over mails. We need a skype call and we should
 use remote debugging tools like teamviewer or vnc or ssh/tmux.

Anyway see below.

That is technically called remote port forwarding, if you wish to call
it reverse ssh,
 then go ahead.

teamviewer does not work on OpenBSD but it is incredible. Very bandwidth
efficient and quite at the level of open source quality and convenience.

I don't think it is as complicated as you think.

But as I said, I am in the middle of too many things and e-mail is not
the way to
 go about this.

But I can assure you that this can be solved easily if you think through.

Best of luck.

I haven't played around with X much so I don't know why that error 
happens. You should search for it on the web and try various 
suggestions. My guess is, your xauth is failing for some reason.

Did you try running the GUI app directly ? Like in the example below, I 
try to run firefox instead of getting a shell.

ssh -t -X poo at mywebserver "ssh -X user at localhost -p 22222 firefox"

If you find a solution, do let us know. It will help.

Found that it is for only US students.

We need more summer of code contests for indian students.

May be some indian companies can join together and start such
contributing contests.

Shouldn't they get a break from studies ? Coding/Researching all summer
in an organized way sound boring, an unorganized chaos in code is always 
fun though.

Message-ID: <CAND2796fbasdJCvpip03GXJom0jwRSiTCPktmU7aGLHUUVbZDg@mail.gmail.com>

About the book:
--------------------

Written by two Debian developers ? Rapha?l Hertzog and Roland Mas ?
the Debian Administrator's Handbook started as a translation of their
French best-seller known as Cahier de l'admin Debian (published by
Eyrolles). It's a fantastic resource for all users of a Debian-based
distribution. Accessible to all, this book teaches the essentials to
anyone who wants to become an effective and independant Debian
GNU/Linux administrator.

Accessible to all, this book teaches the essentials to anyone who
wants to become an effective and independent Debian GNU/Linux
administrator.

It covers all the topics that a competent Linux administrator should
master, from the installation and the update of the system, up to the
creation of packages and the compilation of the kernel, but also
monitoring, backup and migration, without forgetting advanced topics
like SELinux setup to secure services, automated installations, or
virtualization with Xen, KVM or LXC.


Structure of the book:
----------------------------


The first half of the book covers topics relevant for any Debian user:

    how the Debian project works and the various distributions that it offers;
    how to effectively use the packaging system and the associated
tools (dpkg, APT, ?);
    how to install Debian with debian-installer;
    how to find the required documentation/help;
    how to setup new services;
    how to solve the problems that you might encounter;

The second half of the book concerns system administrators who have to
setup and manage a Debian server, or a large set of desktop machines.
You?ll learn:

    how to configure all the most common services (Apache, Postfix,
OpenLDAP, Samba, NFS, ?)
    how to setup virtual machines with KVM/Xen/LXC
    how to secure your server
    how to automatize installations with FAI/d-i/simple-cdd
    how to manage your storage with LVM and RAID
    etc.

Did you get any other talk? If not, why not consider postponing? I think Engg college exams are going on, which may affect attendance.

For troubleshooting run "xhost +" on your desktop and try again.

This command will disable all authentication on your X server and allow any
client to connect and grab your screen, keyboard etc. So use it only for
debugging.

If this works, then you need to use xauth to add the X server's cookie to
the remote client. xauth manpage has sufficient details.

SSH does this behind the scenes when you use the -X option. But since you
have a hop in-between,  twice, xauth is not getting through.

Tried setting specific font for Tamil, as in this:

in addition to setting the encoding to UTF-8 but no use.

When I try make headers_install nothing is happening.

I have copied the output below
$ sudo INSTALL_HDR_PATH=/usr/src/linux-headers-3.4.0-rc5 make
headers_install
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all'.

Subject: [Ilugc] OpenVPN's greatness
Message-ID: <CALDskyyU4kUYWa-BxaC7bu7sLdHnzxzQrKA4kzpKbrecivqCzg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Lug,

My VPN hacking is mostly over and dynamic DNS issue I had is mostly
taken care of.

In that I recognized that for stable site to site VPNs a good IPsec
based VPN implementation like
 what is found in stock OpenBSD is suitable.

When you want interoperability between different operating systems or
between different VPN
 implementations then OpenVPN is the way to go.

It is not as I first thought a simple popular SSLVPN implementation.

It is lot more than that. It is 100% open source and you can customize
it to make commercial
 variants out of it and the quality and detail shows.

It is fantastic and you don't have the normal issue of two layers of
TCP stacked on top of
 one another.

It uses UDP port 1194 and UDP is nothing but another IP layer when it
comes to packet header
 and protocol overhead.

OpenVPN, a 100% open source free software actually helps you do
amazing things just like qemu
which is also 100% open source and is incredibly convenient for virtualization.

Essentiall OpenVPN is found in all UNIX platforms,Windows and Mac. The
installer I created is only 370KB.

And using that you can connect to any OS. This means that if you have
a VPN endpoint based on some commercial
 product and you want to access that from the wild, then all you have
to do is run OpenVPN client on your Windows
 or Linux desktop and run the OpenVPN server inside the network
protected by the commercial VPN box. But
 to get that working you have to port forward UDP port 1194 to that machine.

OpenVPN has several facilities to do multiple client VPNs, it can get
you up and running with just a single secret key for
testing and learning and you can also do sophisticated routing
manipulations(remember this is user space routing), and
 you can periodically ping to ensure uptime and so on.

It is endlessly configurable and highly sophisticated. It makes me
wonder how talented the author James Yonan must be.

Here is the server configuration for multiple clients.

# cat server.conf
dev tun0
tls-server
ca /etc/openvpn/ca.crt
cert /etc/openvpn/server.crt
key /etc/openvpn/server.key
dh /etc/openvpn/dh1024.pem
mode server
server 10.4.0.0 255.255.255.0
ifconfig-pool-persist pool.txt
push "route 172.16.0.0 255.240.0.0"
client-to-client
ping 10
ping-restart 120
push "ping 10"
push "ping-restart 60"
verb 5

Remember the local network behind the VPN is 172.16.0.0/12 here. You
should change it in your case.

And the client configuration is :

# cat client.conf
remote 123.201.6.8
dev tun0
nobind
tls-client
ca ca.crt
cert g3vpn.crt
key g3vpn.key
pull
verb 5

This is the client config which can connect to the server.

The "remote <ip>" is the public IP of the server VPN node.

Remember for each client, a new keypair ought to be created.

Using this you can run a commercial grade enterprise class VPN service
with just these commands:

# openvpn --config server.conf --daemon

on the server and

# openvpn --config client.conf

But the story does not end here.

In order to get this working you have to have the certificates,
dh1024.pem and keys.

Subject: [Ilugc] OpenVPN's greatness


Dear Lug,

My VPN hacking is mostly over and dynamic DNS issue I had is mostly
taken care of.

In that I recognized that for stable site to site VPNs a good IPsec
based VPN implementation like
 what is found in stock OpenBSD is suitable.

When you want interoperability between different operating systems or
between different VPN
 implementations then OpenVPN is the way to go.

It is not as I first thought a simple popular SSLVPN implementation.

It is lot more than that. It is 100% open source and you can customize
it to make commercial
 variants out of it and the quality and detail shows.

It is fantastic and you don't have the normal issue of two layers of
TCP stacked on top of
 one another.

It uses UDP port 1194 and UDP is nothing but another IP layer when it
comes to packet header
 and protocol overhead.

OpenVPN, a 100% open source free software actually helps you do
amazing things just like qemu
which is also 100% open source and is incredibly convenient for virtualization.

Essentiall OpenVPN is found in all UNIX platforms,Windows and Mac. The
installer I created is only 370KB.

And using that you can connect to any OS. This means that if you have
a VPN endpoint based on some commercial
 product and you want to access that from the wild, then all you have
to do is run OpenVPN client on your Windows
 or Linux desktop and run the OpenVPN server inside the network
protected by the commercial VPN box. But
 to get that working you have to port forward UDP port 1194 to that machine.

OpenVPN has several facilities to do multiple client VPNs, it can get
you up and running with just a single secret key for
testing and learning and you can also do sophisticated routing
manipulations(remember this is user space routing), and
 you can periodically ping to ensure uptime and so on.

It is endlessly configurable and highly sophisticated. It makes me
wonder how talented the author James Yonan must be.

Here is the server configuration for multiple clients.

# cat server.conf
dev tun0
tls-server
ca /etc/openvpn/ca.crt
cert /etc/openvpn/server.crt
key /etc/openvpn/server.key
dh /etc/openvpn/dh1024.pem
mode server
server 10.4.0.0 255.255.255.0
ifconfig-pool-persist pool.txt
push "route 172.16.0.0 255.240.0.0"
client-to-client
ping 10
ping-restart 120
push "ping 10"
push "ping-restart 60"
verb 5

Remember the local network behind the VPN is 172.16.0.0/12 here. You
should change it in your case.

And the client configuration is :

# cat client.conf
remote 123.201.6.8
dev tun0
nobind
tls-client
ca ca.crt
cert g3vpn.crt
key g3vpn.key
pull
verb 5

This is the client config which can connect to the server.

The "remote <ip>" is the public IP of the server VPN node.

Remember for each client, a new keypair ought to be created.

Using this you can run a commercial grade enterprise class VPN service
with just these commands:

# openvpn --config server.conf --daemon

on the server and

# openvpn --config client.conf

But the story does not end here.

In order to get this working you have to have the certificates,
dh1024.pem and keys.

Thanks. Let us wait and see if your interest will sustain for 10 years.

Then we have gotten somewhere.

I only normally met 22 year old kids in LUG. No experienced hands.

Nobody wants to study beyond 30 , but they are very interested in
*** even when they are 80. This is  very interesting no? ;)

You should try OpenBSD.

It is not written in some alien language, Linux is not the only OS out there.

There are only two people in LUG who talk about OpenBSD.

And I have been in LUG for more than 6 years. Not a single soul has learnt it.

Sigh.

Subject: [Ilugc] Introduction to firewalls
Message-ID: <CALDskyyLv0056OFzLmdVLAM6fLSQVyqyWML+A-nHTKRiK_iZOg@mail.gmail.com>

Although my company has no firewall product yet I have a customer who
uses our firewall.

This sounds crazy no?

Yet it is indeed crazy.

What I thought was a basic firewall is different from what I now think.

And I think in a few months time I might end up building what is known as UTM.

UTM stands for unified threat management.

It manages all kinds of threat, snort IDS, IPS, spam control, port and
site blocking et al.

But then a firewall is a combination of not just active functions like this.

You need certain passive monitoring facilities like network monitoring.

It is not just SNMP stuff. You have a Cisco open standard called Netflow.

That helps you collect packet flows and display. I have never manged
to get it working.

A firewall has to be able to monitor the goings on in the network
which is basically nothing but
 various kinds of traffic. A glorified tcpdump you can say.

Now it also needs various reports and graphs. Easily managed with a
little bits of rrdtool magic
 and SQLite database manipulations.

In other words a firewall is expected to give adequate active
protection as well as a dashboard
 of the local network.

Of course firewalls should have VPN and ISP link load balancer feature too.

I believe this is part of the UTM concept since everyone in the market
seems to be quite
 dumbfounded by the firewall term, it is almost as abused as the word sex.

It is used for anything and everything.

But in reality it is only concerned with basic port and IP blocking.

But that is a text book definition which nobody is going to understand.

It protects your network alright. And that is what my first firewall
deployment attempted to
do.

Block all packets and allow only explicitly allowed traffic.

But it crumbled down.

Why?

Because a basic IP based kernel firewall does not cut it.

Nowadays every bank, e-mail site and nearly anyone with money goes for
a pool of
IP addresses for their site. If it is linkedin or facebook you are
toast not to mention Google.

So you have to do what is known as URL blocking or URL filtering.

Now squid is what comes to mind.

But I don't like it. For whatever reason.

Squid has time based blocking, caching and so on.

I ended up using an open source tool called tinyproxy which does
excellent URL filtering
although it is not very stable. It keeps crashing. But I can manage it.

A basic URL filter takes a HTTP URL and inspects to see if it is
allowed or not. Now the DNS backend
 takes care of the IP pool problem I spoke of above. The URL is what
is inspected to do allow/deny in
 userland.

This has been a big relief for me.

Now this works only for web URLs.

What about HTTPS? What about other protocols like FTP and p2p traffic?

What about IM? There is a tool called imspector which is a C++ open
source project that
 can help you log your chat messages.

Then you have to do what is known as content filtering.

Whenever some customer asks me this I stare blankly.

What does this mean?

You mean inspect every damn packet to look into what it contains?

Read every e-mail at wire speed?

I just dunno how to do it. Perhaps later.

Normally firewalls come with multiple WAN ports and multiple LAN ports.

They are able to do certain WiFi AP functions like RADIUS
authentication and stuff
 known as captive portal.

Check out the pfSense project which is a FreeBSD based firewall , open source.

I have to take dinner.

Moreover this mail has gotten too long and too broad.

I will send another to deal with this topic again.

Thanks, all. Currently, using R for this purpose. Planning to check out

Have you seen this?

You can change the BIOS boot order to USB-FDD or USB-ZIP or USB-HDD
 and boot from the USB stick and install.

Subject: [Ilugc] Bridging and routing
Message-ID: <CALDskyyhR6_qPqBUR2j026mTxy8Grp2+-krzio-BN=DXCyG1-g@mail.gmail.com>

This tutorial is about the elusive bridging technology so commonly employed in
 ADSL routers and stuff but not so generally used in TCP/IP networking.

I wanted to talk about VLANs but I have no experience with them. Perhaps later.

For now let us focus on bridging. What is a bridge?

Since I grew up in the Lakshadweep islands the word bridge only meant one thing.

No, not the connection across a river as there are no rivers in Lakshadweep.

The topmost part of the ship/liner where the captain sits and where
they drive the ship.

I have also driven ships and boats. ;)

Anyway now the meaning of a bridge is not something we come across often in
 networking; it is supposed to be a layer II device that does
switching; no routing.

Somewhat like a hub/network switch.

Now a computer with sophisticated routing capabilities can jolly well
act as a dumb switch.

And switches talk a protocol called STP , spanning tree protocol which
is nothing but a
 way to regulate the traffic. In switched mode packet transmission it
is very important.

Alright, now let us focus on software and our work.

Say we have a situation where we have to extend a network segment
between wired and
wireless world or even physically across.

Obviously creating a different subnet/mask for that is problematic.

To keep the network less complicated we can resolve to bridging in
which a computer acts as a
 simple physical interconnection of networks such that the topology
does not change.

A very good example is my house office. In case I wish to have a LAN
downstairs with
 WiFi upstairs I will use bridging.

Now bridging is also employed in ADSL MODEM testing. I have a buddy in BSNL who
 keeps bothering me all the time with some MODEM that is not
configured correctly; he
 with either have the DHCP address wrong or some stupid mistake in the
MODEM will
 trouble him.

And I have always found that people with little ability are seldom
benefited by help.

Anyway he normally keeps the MODEM in bridge mode and runs a dialer
from the Windows
 desktop to connect to the Internet.

What is a MODEM?

It is a firewall, router, DHCP server, NAT all in one.

What is the advantage of bridging?

Except that you can run the dialer from a PC instead of the MODEM
itself which talks PPPoE
there is no big advantage as such.

But it is always good to have an option.

A MODEM has an ethernet port, a Wifi port and an RJ11 phone jack which
connects to the CO.

The public IP is available in the phone network. The local ethernet
network has a local IP.

The MODEM can only route traffic between the two networks.

But you can ask the MODEM to only do the physical connectivity to the
exchange server and
 let the Windows desktop do the PPPoE dialing with username and password.

In this case,the ethernet or Wifi port does the work of the phone line
to talk to the exchange.

It is a very interesting concept if you think of it...

There is a tool called 'USB Startup disk creator'. Using that and the
iso image, you can create a bootable usb drive from which you can
install ubuntu.

Hi Marikkannan,

Can I know what is you domain name ?  if your example the domain which you
have registered is tamil.com and if you have proper MX record in place,
verify it with a website like mxtoolbox.com.

That sounds like a good idea. I guess the important factor is the manpower
needed to conduct this. Also, unlike weekends, people other than students
will have to take leave from office. If you are interested in organising
this, please go ahead. People who are interested will join you.

Btw, which workshop 2 years back are you talking about?

          For mail delivery, an 'A' record alone is not sufficient.
You need to add an MX record. Once you do that and the DNS gets
refreshed, from some box do

"dig your.domain.name -t mx" [1]

The results of the dig command will have multiple sections. See if the
"ANSWER SECTION" has any hostname for the MX record. You should see
something like this.

my.domain.	86400	IN	MX	10 mail.my.domain.

If you get that, it just means that your DNS settings are OK and you
should be able to receive mails now if your other settings(postfix an
dovecot) are correct. If you still don't get emails. Run
tshark/tcpdump on the mail server, send a mail from some provider(like
gmail/yahoo mail etc.) and see if you see any traffic. Share the
results if you have problems analysing them. Thanks


[1] You may have to install dns-utils in debian based distros if you
do not have the dig command.

Subject: [Ilugc] anatomy of a mail server
Message-ID: <CALDskyzy9wkaVyLuEOaT+yDjhpXgqtj5Uu-smj6EouQ6BMNm4g@mail.gmail.com>

I have been screwing around with e-mail based product development work the last
 5 years and so I have a fairly good grasp of how e-mails flow along
the Internet.

Now that reminds me long ago in college I answered a paper about how
e-mail flows
 on the net. I got it wrong. I thought that just like packets flow
from hop to hop mails
 are stored at each hop.

I started with spam control and now I also have a mail server.
Basically an e-mail
 that is sent from point A to reach point B on the Internet has to
pass through multiple
 routers the same way a web server is reached.

But there are lot of differences. The primary concept is that of how
DNS plays with it.

A DNS record called the MX pointer is key here.

For you to receive mail from the outside world a DNS record has to
tell them that
the domain you are hosting can be reached on such and such IP address.

An MX record is not an IP address. It is a mapping between a domain
name and another
 domain name whose A pointer points to the IP address.

$ dig zoho.com mx

will tell you. Or

$ dig +short gmail.com mx

Anyway the point is that for a mail server to function properly it
should both send and receive mail traffic.

A simple mail server is easily configured using any worthy UNIX
operating system. It comes with stock
 sendmail, postfix, qmail, exim or whatever else.

The popular solutions like Zarafa, Zimbra, Scalix, Kerio and so on are
built on top of Postfix or sendmail or
 any such.

I use postfix.

It is far easier to be able to send mail out than to receive them as
sending does not involve MX pointers.

Only static IP that is not blacklisted is necessary.

If you have that you can easily send mail that is received by most servers.

In that regard you may check the popular blacklist sites like
senderbase.org used by Ironport which hurt
 my customer a lot these days(I somehow fixed the issue) and
blacklistcheck.org or some such thing.

If you have a DHCP address like in a normal broadband then dont run a
mailserver. You can only when
 you can authenticate against gmail and wish to use a smarthost to
transmit and receive mail.

Not much fun in running such a mail server.

Now for how spam control works.

I guess most of the technically minded clued in guys would have
followed something about e-mail servers.

Spam control falls into a technology area identified by Gartner and
other MBA companies as
 e-mail security gateway solutions or network security in case you
talk UTM as I wrote two days ago.

It is about controlling unwanted mail at the gateway/network level.

But just like virus scanning this can be done at the user mailbox
level as well using simple Outlook rules.

But almost in every case spam control is performed at the mail server.

We will discuss that later.

E-mails are sent and received using port 25 of TCP, port 587 called as
submission port is used in certain
cases where it is normally authenticated.

And port 110 and 143 are used for POP3 and IMAP4 for downloading mails
from mail server to mail clients
 like Outlook also called as MUA. mutt is the MUA I use in UNIX.

Dovecot is the best server for this. It handles authentication for
POP3 and IMAP and serves mail from mailboxes.

There are other secure variants that use SSL and SMTP auth is another
topic for mail relay authentication.

But for sure authentication is done during mail download to identify
the user's mailbox.

For mail relaying/sending it is not a must as the authentication is
performed by the IP address as it belongs to the
 accepted network of Postfix.

This is where a VPN is very helpful as you can belong to the local
network segment from anywhere in the world
 by using OpenVPN and connecting to the company's mail server.

If not you can use the submission port 587 and do SMTP auth to send mail.

I have not configured this so far.

sometimes back there was a thread on this forum mentoning "preparing PPT using firefox by open source tool". I need to have the hyperlink to download the tool. If I am not correct, you can correct me.

with thanx

Is their anything specific about that tools or you want alternative
ways of to super cool #presentations ? If latter is true you can go
for a lot of things like impress.js. I will mail you complete list of
alternatives available but I have to search for that list.

In general, the procedure should be more or less the same as documented at
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Moving_a_wiki.
Be sure to check the various path settings in LocalSettings.php, and
don't forget to take a full backup as advised first. :)

Subject: [Ilugc] Simplifying the idea of network setup
Message-ID: <CALDskyzsY7J-JRrs79TLo3_Q-uPu2A+NrNBpnbSJ5x5Z4nSVaQ@mail.gmail.com>

No matter how much you talk about networking it is inexhaustible like the ocean.

I wish to dwell a little bit on routing, DHCP, NAT and topology.

Yesterday I wanted to talk about routing but there was no space.

Routing is separate from packet forwarding which is what is thought of
as routing for
 the most part.

Routing of packets on the Internet in which packets go from hop to hop,


$ traceroute -n gmail.com
traceroute: Warning: gmail.com has multiple addresses; using 74.125.236.214
traceroute to gmail.com (74.125.236.214), 64 hops max, 40 byte packets
 1  192.168.1.1  3.388 ms  2.473 ms  2.232 ms
 2  59.99.242.1  22.239 ms  21.721 ms  21.981 ms
 3  218.248.168.182  40.735 ms  104.231 ms  27.973 ms
 4  59.163.206.157  146.493 ms  155.239 ms  156.976 ms
 5  121.240.1.46  158.730 ms  159.234 ms  165.248 ms
 6  72.14.232.110  165.950 ms  167.731 ms  167.978 ms
 7  209.85.240.147  168.225 ms  168.1 ms  158.985 ms
 8  74.125.236.214  159.211 ms  157.718 ms  154.737 ms

shows how you get to a place from here.

This is actually packet forwarding performed by various routers which
is machines with
 multiple physical interfaces and consequently multiple IP addresses.

In fact the only way by which you can send off packets from one place
to another involves
 definitely routing or bridging.

This happens in layer II or III.

But essentially routing is the process of finding out which interface
to push the packet.

It is like asking in a hotel, which table placed the order?

But the procedure of route lookup involves a separate routing protocol
like BGP, OSPF, RIP or
even static routes.

You can create a lot of static routes using the route command on Linux.

Once the route tables are setup the kernel looks up the table to
forward the packet appropriately.

Here we have the chicken and egg problem, BGP is over TCP, OSPF is
over IP and so on.

You need a way to talk to each other before the routing protocols do their job.

So essentially it is a mix of many different techniques.

Now let us look at DHCP.

A home router/MODEM has a DHCP server built into it.

This is what enabled you to have multiple computers talk to the
Internet at home.

You can do that without DHCP also but this makes is incredibly convenient.

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol enables you to assign IP addresses
based on MAC hardware
 addresses or even randomly and a lease period is assigned for which
the gateway, nameserver and
 so on are fixed.

Typically the Internet MODEM talks PPPoE  to the phone line, DHCP to
you and does NAT.

When you type:

# dhclient eth0

what happens is that your PC requests a DHCP server to respond using
Ethernet broadcast.

Since your MODEM is listening for broadcast packets it will respond.

This can easily happen over WiFi too.

Now what is NAT?

NAT of network address translation is a method to allow your DHCP
local addresses, RFC1918 addresses
 to talk to the Internet using the unique globally recognizable public
IP of your MODEM which is
 negotiated as part of PPPoE.

It is simple packet header rewriting logic. Sometimes port numbers are
also rewritten.

Let me finish up the mail by talking about network topology.

Normally the computers in the same WiFi network or LAN which is
ethernet based will be
 in the same subnet or same network. This is a bus topology.

In other words each node in the network that is physically connected
and can talk the same
 layer II protocol like CSMA/CD belong to the same IP network as well.

However this can also be extended across the Internet using VPN using
the tun/tap interface
 in which your local layer II concepts like DHCP or bridging can work
across the Internet.

But in general the physical topology dictates which network your
computer belongs to.

Also once you connect to the Internet the network keeps getting more
and more specific and finally
 it goes into a different network.

More later.

Hey;
If I get you correctly, unless one has a Static IP one cannot use a mail server to redirect mail to
users on a Linux Desktop with multiple users. I had to create a fetchmail config, run it for each
user and route all mail through a commom Gmail ID with SMTP fwding. As it is a family desktop I can
assert my will, but it's unfair.
 How do I subvert this. I would not like to pay for static IP, usage is too less. I tried "dyn.dns"
unfortunately did not work out. I am using fetchmail+mutt+exim. Hope I am along the right lines!

Then you are using the smart host feature in which DHCP is not a
problem. It will work.

You are a full fledged mail server only when you directly talk to the
mail server in question which
 is obtained by the @ part of the mail ID, after a DNS lookup of MX
pointer followed by A pointer.

You are too old to have any value in India, ;)

Actually all the hackers I have seen are quite old. My US partner is
63 years old. He still
 works, learns and does everything except coding.

Okay now, you don't have any problem; you are just front ending for
gmail. You do not
 need a static IP.

Neither do you need dyn dns.

What on earth is SMTP forwarding?

Oh the forward feature in gmail? That is not SMTP. Something else,
then you are not
 running any vestige of a mail server. ;)

Subject: [Ilugc] a real mail server
Message-ID: <CALDskyzcbJXqL0zc2f3wpRUq-5cD4VCp+jV2JLL28s8B-CkEQA@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

I think I need to really clarify what I mean by a mail server.

A real mail server is not needed unless you are in a company making at
least a crore in turnover.

Or has say 140 employees or so.

Even then people get by with Google Apps or some hosted cloud solution.

You will require your own mail server for a variety of reasons. A lot
of people are very uncomfortable
 with their data going and residing in somebody's data center or in
some other country.

By running your own mail server you also attract other expenses like a
server room, rack, systems admin
 to maintain it and so on.

Okay now; you certainly can run a poika poika mail server at home by
running UNIX of Linux.

It can run all the queuing algorithms and all the Postfix sister programs,

/usr/local/sbin/mailq
/usr/local/sbin/newaliases
/usr/local/sbin/postalias
/usr/local/sbin/postcat
/usr/local/sbin/postconf
/usr/local/sbin/postdrop
/usr/local/sbin/postfix
/usr/local/sbin/postfix-disable
/usr/local/sbin/postfix-enable
/usr/local/sbin/postfix-install
/usr/local/sbin/postkick
/usr/local/sbin/postlock
/usr/local/sbin/postlog
/usr/local/sbin/postmap
/usr/local/sbin/postmulti
/usr/local/sbin/postqueue
/usr/local/sbin/postsuper
/usr/local/sbin/qshape
/usr/local/sbin/sendmail

But then until you have an MX record and people can reach you really
aren't running a real mail server.

And to send mail out you need a static IP.

Hope this settles the case.

If not court opens tomorrow 9 am.

Fetchmail can do multi drop, it's a fairly standard setup. Check the docs.

I find Gmail web interface good enough for my needs. Not sure why one would
want to use fetchmail and download emails.

Mutt can pull Gmail directly over IMAP and with a little help from light
weight smtp clients it can also send email directly. No need for fetchmail
or exim.

Unless you have 100% power backup and ISP connectivity don't run your own
mail server. You'll also require good anti spam solution.

Get a shared account with any web hosting provider or VPS and use that as
your smart host. You're already doing this with Gmail, I'm not sure what
exactly you are trying to accomplish.

Team,

  Please share your valuable input to make better co-ordination/resolve on
below mentioned details of the issue

Issue in detail

>From linux 5.6, we get the frag flood attack which is blocked by firewall.

It makes the firewall inoperable for some minutes.

JBOSS and java are the application programs running in the linux 5.6
creating frag flood attack.

JBOSS is using multicast IP 230.0.0.4 as destination which is causing the
issue as giving the attack towards the firewall.

Please let we know how to fine tune it

     What is the purpose of your DNS server ? Is it an authoritative
DNS server ? The "internal" and "external" are most likely various
"views". In bind, you can selectively expose only a few hosts to the
public and expose everything internally within your organisation. But
we don;t really need such complicated stuff always. We can have a
simple configuration. Here, I am pasting a sample named.conf config
file(from my Debian box)

zone "." {
        type hint;
	file "/etc/bind/db.root";
};

zone "localhost" {
	type master;
	file "/etc/bind/db.local";
};

zone "127.in-addr.arpa" {
	type master;
	file "/etc/bind/db.127";
};

zone "bala.domain" {
	type master;
	file "/etc/bind/bala.domain.zone";
};


all those zone files have various entries in bind9 format. They will
have entries for MX, TXT(needed with SPF, DKIM etc.) and other
necessary records for the domain.

         Depends on what all you need in the DNS. For mail delivery,
you need to add an MX record in your zone file. And if you want to
enable stuff like SPF, add the necessary TXT records. Thanks

Hi,

I have created a small library which will get stock quote for a given
symbol using yahoo finance API in Vala. The code is available in
https://github.com/prasannatsm/ystockquote. This is based on the
ystockquote Python library available at http://goldb.org/ystockquote.html.

The code is very simple and may have bugs. I have tested in my machine with
some symbols and seems to work fine. There may be place of improvements and
there can be bugs.

If you like vala or planning to learn vala this will be a good example. I
have just started learning vala and things are going good.

Subject: [Ilugc] What is a tunnel?
Message-ID: <CALDskyy_x-3Q2GEd+TJMjhj-AVqP7Ynt_AfTUvAdO9dgqnB4Og@mail.gmail.com>

This mail will talk about a networking concept called tunnel.

Or encapsulation.

In common parlance, this reminds us of Tiruchi theppakulam which is
linked to Cauvery by a
 tunnel or the one dug by kings or even thieves in the great French
bank robbery.

Essentially the idea of tunnel in networking is that of doing two
layers of the same layer.

In most cases it is only IP layer or networking layer, layer III.

You can tunnel IPv4 inside IPV6, you can tunnel public IP inside
private IP and you can tunnel
 Novell's IPX/SPX inside IP and so on to work with other protocols
like frame relay, ATM.

Anyway that is theory.

What I do on a day to day basis is tunnel local IP addresses inside
public IP addresses to
 survive on the Internet.

A good analogy is Indian tech companies.

They all take some White man's product and resell to customers at
roughly the same price point
 as I do. But how long do they live, breathe and enjoy this false success?

Very shortlived.

Similarly a packet with local IP endpoints can start out with glory
but can't reach the destination.

Some router mid way will certainly drop it.

In order to survive end to end routing you have to have globally
unique public IP addresses.

And ports too.

In the case of VPN traffic, the port is not important as the protocol
they speak is ESP which is
 a layer above IP, not TCP or UDP. But in the case of OpenVPN I guess
it is UDP port 1194.

Anyway the point is that the real IP header is decapsulated at the
destination by the appropriate
 tun/tap driver by OpenVPN or by the kernel IPsec stack presented to
the OS as the
appropriate protocol and port.

This is how VPN works using packet inside packet networking.

Similar to Matryoshka doll or Tanjavur bommai.

I hope you get the idea.

Now I will tell you more details about VPN. This technology thoroughly
interests me as I have been
 playing with this for nearly 4 years now.

VPNs are basically sessions established between two unique endpoints
on the Internet just like
 your browser session in authenticated mode like web based mail or paypal.

HTTP is stateless but VPNs are very much stateful.

Moreover you require VPN connectivity not only between two endpoints
but with multiple endpoints in a
  mesh topology.

This is also allowed by the same tunneling concept.

You can setup multiple VPN flows as long as they all get decapsulated properly.

IMO, the above is not relevant to the topic of your posting.

Gajshield, Cyberoam, Quick Heal UTM appliance, Enjay, Matrix Comm are
few India based companies that have products developed with their
teams in India.   I am sure there is a whole bunch more.

Subject: [Ilugc] firewall rules
Message-ID: <CALDskywUdEvbvRt7k8UrCMKR5UXCB7CXZEBYzrth+7f=6Y6g-w@mail.gmail.com>

A firewall rule is a line. Like a line in a database which stands for a record.

Or a line in a lookup table.

A rule in a firewall which is always part of the kernel determines the
action on a packet
 as and when a packet hits the kernel's networking stack.

So the low level kernel routines check for the packet's acceptance.

For instance, a packet could be silently dropped, rejected with a
packet sent to the source
 or it could be passed silently.

Typically packets are filtered both at the ingress and egress paths.

It could get rejected at any time.

Any communication on the network happens in both ways.

A TCP setup involves three packets going in two directions.

That is why we face networking problems and TCP will not work when we
get routing wrong.

You can decide in a firewall to drop early, do not allow packets to
come with a certain characteristic.

This is good.

But sometimes you cannot know how healthy a packet is until it goes
out; then you can block it then.

If you block at any point, the TCP connection establishment phase
fails and your rule is successful.

But poorly written firewall rules can be circumvented since even for
me, getting a firewall rule right
 takes a lot of trial and error and mistakes and I simply lack
experience, common sense and
reasoning for that.

Reason is simple. Firewall rules require a lot of logic, just like programming.

And you all know how hard it is to get code working correctly.

It is always an embarrassment particularly for someone of my age but I
learn to live with it.

Perhaps one day...

Anyway now, firewall rules cascade.

Which means that all the rules are evaluated and the last rule could
drop or allow.

Which means that writing firewall rules now become more complex.

You can make a short circuit rule also which passes the packet to
kernel without further if conditions.

And any good firewall maintains states even for non TCP traffic and
that greatly improves rule
 evaluation and performance.

Finally a firewall is what I talked about. Now in Linux people are
confused bringing in userland,
 SIP and FTP rewriting, mixing userland and kernel and so on.

That is not a true firewall...

There are distinct advantages of dealing with userland in terms of
stability, keeping kernel small and not bloated etc. A firewall is not
determined by whether it is done in kernel or userland. E.g a L7 or
protocol filter is good in userland.

Some dual port (negotiated data ports) applications will need to write
packet filter rules to let those connections work. It has nothing to do
with the firewall being true or not. In general, packet filtering is done
well in kernel but when higher level protocols need to come in, you will
find such interactions.

Dear Girish;
1. I guess I am a bit confused. I would not like to use gmail. I would like to pull mail for all users
at a desktop and then distribute it to the respective users. An exercise in having a fast and
effective way of using, distributing and re-sending mail. Would like the users to
Use mutt or similar text based e-mail client with vim as a text based editor dealing with just mail.
Presume one requires
(a) A static IP.
(b) Exim+mutt+Dovecot/postfix dusly configured.
2. This is where my raeding and warped logic got me, hence explored dyn dns and in the end gave up.
Wanted to link it to a text based messenger service finally.
3. Why all this? A moot point, feel the GUI is not an accurate medium of usage and encourages
generality, limited attention span etc...
Maybe am just senile

Hi
Hope this gets a smile, not breaking the rules too much am I.
      Podi
A software engineer used to develop programs on his Pentium, sitting under a tree on the banks of a river. One day, while he working, his machine tumbled off and fell in the river. Encouraged by the Panchatantra story of his childhood (the woodcutter and the axe), he started praying to the River Goddess, who appeared. The engineer told her about lost computer. As usual, the Goddess wanted to test his honesty. She showed a match box like thing and asked, "Is this your computer ?" Disappointed by the Goddess' lack of computer awareness, the engineer replied, "No." She next showed him a scientific calculator like thing and asked if that was his. Annoyed, the engineer said "No, not at all!!"?

Finally, she came up with his own Pentium machine and asked if it was his. The engineer kept mum. Goddess was happy with his honesty. She was about to give him all three items, but before she could make the offer, the engineer asked her, "Don't you know that you're supposed to show me some better computers before bringing up my own?" The Goddess, angered at this, replied, "You stupid fellow! The first two things I showed you were the Trillennium and the Billennium, the latest computers from IBM!". So saying, she disappeared with the Pentium!!?

Moral: If you're not up-to-date with technology trends, it's better keep your mouth shut and let people think you're a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.

Public Static IP is not needed. I'm assuming all users use the same
desktop. If so, dovecot (IMAP/POP) is not needed. it is needed only when
the desktop picking up mail is a mail server for the other PCs at your
home. If everyone is using the same desktop, then Postfix will deliver mail
to their home directories. Mutt that each of them use will pick their
respective mailbags from their home directories.

Exim and Postfix are both MTAs. Only one of them will be needed.

One member had mentioned fetchmail multidrop earlier. You can use that to
pick up mail from a single aggregated(called catch-all) mail bag on the
internet to distribute mails to users on the system running the MTA. To
deliver mail out, you can use the SMTP smarthost facility in the MTA to
forward all mails to another SMTP host assuming it allows you. I'm not sure
if gmail allows smtp relaying or would work. You'll need to experiment.

I do not understand the text messenger linking. Is it due to dynamic dns?

That is what I do except that I run a full fledged mail server on a live domain.

Of course I have a mail server product. So I better run it live. Now
to answer your point on
 how you pull mail for all users and distribute it...I dunno. I have
heard this but I dunno
 what people do. Can you clarify?

No. I run my own free dyn dns service. If you want any help call me or
mail me in private.

It is also an open invite. I can create a DNS record for you free of
cost. And I can also run a Dyn DNS
 update for you too...

But dyn DNS will not work with a mail server.

I hope that is clear.

Link what with a text based service? Your mail gives me more questions
than answers.

Can you clarify?

You are again and again talking about your 42 years age. It is really
not an advanced age.

My US partner is not senile, lot of people in my relatives circle were
active even in early 80s.

So don't think like that. It just isn't true.

As to GUI and text mode, well I like both.

I use mutt and vim for mail and always prefer text mode but for
customers I don't give that.

I try to balance both.

Hi,

There is a DNS Amplification attack against facebook.com in progress.

http://meetings.ripe.net/ripe-52/presentations/ripe52-plenary-dnsamp.pdf

Those of you connected to the Internet especially running "open
resolvers" take appropriate measures.

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/hh972393.aspx

Block ( drop ) these traffic early in your firewall rules or your
firewall can get overloaded.

I caught failed attempts to use my firewall for this.

I once ran a mailman this way :) Also have a look at 'getmail' as an
alternative for 'fetchmail'.

Subject: [Ilugc] more on firewall
Message-ID: <CALDskywJFWUkm=1LDZNZPRkAadhE2w5BBu7WbgDcO_Wgp=CbcA@mail.gmail.com>

We saw what a firewall can do at the kernel level with port numbers,
ip addresses and other filter criteria found
 in the packet headers.

It is easy to block by tcp or udp port numbers, block all ping
packets(wrong), and you could block all
 packets with TOS byte fields of TCP flags corresponding to a SYN packet.

But all that is only good for very basic firewalling.

Not very useful in the real world.

In the real world we want to block instant messaging, inspect https,
look at p2p traffic and not just block but
 allocate bandwidth fairly and so on.

These things require real engineering.

The soft of things a networking engineer is supposed to do.

QoS is nothing but traffic shaping or rate limiting of packets leaving
our network.

We can easily control that but what about packets coming to us?

Nothing much we can do there.

But with QoS we can get fairly good results in controlling network abuse.

What if there is a buffer overflow attack or router worms?

A firewall should be able to deal with such things. What if you want
to do passive OS fingerprinting?

A firewall can do that; block all SMTP traffic from Windows hosts.

Now URL filtering is what people need.

That a firewall cannot do. Only a userspace application can do that.

And for that you have to redirect traffic by proxying.

That is how you also get SIP, FTP and other traffic work across NAT boxes.

A firewall has the important job of port forwarding. What is that?

All incoming packets are blocked by default and being a local RFC1918
network they are
 anyway not going to reach inside.

In order to enable that you can do the reverse of NAT.

The packets to IP address and port can be rewritten to a local
machine's IP and port.

This is similar in functionality to ssh port forwarding but it is
different in semantics.

For port forwarding to work the routing should be symmetric and
packets should be seen by the
 address rewriting engine(firewall) in both directions.

We normally get this wrong and suffer in agony.

There is a lot of other load balancing, traffic distribution and other
advanced stuff that a firewall should
 do but even to get this far is quite a challenge.

Firewalls should be able to separate network segments and manage what
is called as DMZ where you can
 host your applications; which are accessible from outside world but
you can't get into any other local machine from there.

Unless of course you run the VPN software in it. ;)

Due to this failure GDM display manager takes nearly 30 seconds to start
its service, so i have to wait till i get the login screen.

After i logged in and in terminal i followed as what it said

#systemctl status akmods.service

and here is the ouput of it:-

" akmods.service - LSB: Builds and install new kmods from akmod packages

  Loaded: loaded (/etc/rc.d/init.d/akmods)

  Active: failed since Sat, 19 May 2012 16:01:44 +0530; 15min ago

  Process: 1061 ExecStart=/etc/rc.d/init.d/akmods start (code=exited,
status=0/SUCCESS)

  CGroup: name=systemd:/system/akmods.service "

How can i resolve this? i googled for this but unable to find a proper
solution. This increases my boot time.

These are not answerable by a mailing list.

If you are willing to do commercial transaction then mail me offlist
and I can help.

Okay I will try to do my best in this mail.

For the BCC of each mail transiting the mail server there is a Postfix
configuration
option(in case you use postfix instead of qmail which every guy and his brother
 in law runs), called always_bcc:

always_bcc (default: empty)
       Optional address that receives a "blind carbon copy" of each message
       that is received by the Postfix mail system.

       Note: if mail to the BCC address bounces it will be returned to the
       sender.

       Note: automatic BCC recipients are produced only for new mail.  To
       avoid mailer loops, automatic BCC recipients are not generated after
       Postfix forwards mail internally, or after Postfix generates mail
       itself.

Now, in order to do mail deep inspection to look at MIME type of
attachments and block
 attachments beyond a certain size...the latter is quite easy. It is
the postfix
mailbox_message_size parameter I think. No big deal.

To look at each attachment and filter requires a different method. Because mail
 comes in as MIME encoded and base64 encoded, this will require on the
 fly MIME decoding and then filtering.

I am sure there will be some third party tool to do this but I have
never done it.

What I do however is display the attachments by decoding the MIME in
the mail Queue.

That is easy. Filtering requires active participation in mail traffic.
Yes, I got it.

Postfix comes with body_check third party executables you can invoke
on each mail.

This will slow things down but that is what you need.

With an appropriate filter program invoked in /etc/postfix/master.cf,
you can achieve
 your goal.

Kerio is an excellent commercial mail server offering. It is expensive
but I think it
 will be good.

My goal is to create a Kerio like mail server suite replete with
clients, calender, tasks
 and notes integration.

If I were to do it single handed it could easily take me a year. But I
am going to do it.

Subject: [Ilugc] dynamic DNS a solved problem anymore
Message-ID: <CALDskyyYUCJxCsw0bddkwXBaRrMVxnW8wzR5HKFGWpp6W0uVsg@mail.gmail.com>

I happened to get dynamic DNS updates working beautifully.

Thanks to a free Hurricane DNS service. http://dyn.he.net

All you have to do is purchase a domain either from a typical low
quality Indian
 player like net4india or anyone say register.com, and remove all the NS
 type records. You only need to have the NS pointed to ns1.he.net.

And then you have to go ahead and add the domains and the IP address using
 the DNS A record.

If you have dynamic DNS, then you have to generate a key. Once you have that
 whenever you send a HTTP request in the form,

http://domain:key at dyn.dns.he.net/nic/update?hostname=domain

then the IP is automatically gleaned from the packet header and updated in the
 database.

Obviously this update program should run in the machine which is
behind the dynamic IP.

Now, anywhere in the world you can reach the dynamic IP using the domain name
 you pointed to.

Plain and simple.

In other words, your dynamic IP now has features of static IP for all
practical purposes
 except of course...as you well know e-mail...

       This is not ethically correct. Someone might be stupid enough
to share their bank account and password on the email. But he/she does
so trusting that the mail is secure. We morally do not have a right to
look at the contents of the mail without the knowledge and the consent
of the sender *and* the receiver. No one can stop you from doing it,
but it is a very very bad thing to do.

       What you can do, however is, something like mail filter that
exim has. You can automatically discard messages with specific terms
in the header/body of the message. Again, it is not a fair thing to
do. But if you are working in a corporate and want something like Data
Loss Protection, then it is a different aspect and best to get some
support from an expert in the industry.

       These are doable with most mail servers. In exim, IIRC, there
was an acl_smtp_mime config that you can setup based on the file name.
The other option is to do what Girish said - Based on the Content-Type
SMTP header can be used. But from what I understand, there is a format
called TNEF used my Microsoft which has caused trouble. So, handling
TNEF mime types is best left to proper TNEF decoders. Thanks

This is just my opinion, If you corporate security policy clearly states
that business email may be scrutinized for security reason I don't think
that it is a bad thing to do. After all as a security admin what you care
for is the security of your corporate network.  I guess most people would
understand.

         Yes, it can be scrutinized. But scrutinizing is not the same
as Bcc'ing a copy of my mail to the admin. When people say
"scrutinize", they check the mail contents against a set of
words/phrases/expressions. This is done by the software the processes
the mail and  not by a human. I call it unethical when the whole mail
is Bcc'ed to some other person. Thanks


PS: It would be really nice if you could do interleaved posting
instead of top posting. People wouldn't know if your response was for
my mail or Girish's mail(in this case.). So, please try to avoid top
posting and do interleaved posting.

The mailing list guidelines
(http://www.ilugc.in/mailinglist-guidelines) clearly states that
interleaved, trimmed posting is the recommended style of posting and
not top posting. It is not a bad thing to follow and most people would
understand why if they learn why it is insisted. Kindly avoid top
posting.

And people don't always see things from an ethical point of view and
it has to be considered as a necessary evil to live with imho.

Well we have to understand that software cannot do every thing, that too
especially in the security field.
Say if an email contains an executable an security analyst need to check it
before releasing inside their environment as a preventive measure rather
than start the clean up later on.

      This can be done with software. My day job(in the security
field) is in a product that does just . The concept is simple - MIME
type detections, quarantining etc. Thanks


PS: Sorry to mention it again, may be I wasn't clear last time. When
you post, you need to interleave it. Meaning, you remove(trim) all
unnecessary text from the mail you are replying to and have just those
sentences you are replying to. Saves some bandwidth, and  scrolling
;). Also it becomes easier to read.

Very simple query.

for f in $oldfolder
do
sha=`sha1sum $f`
    for f2 in $newfolder
     do
      sha2=`sha1sum $f2`
      if [ $sha1 = $sha2 ]; then
             rm $f2
      fi

If you don't need the service, just disable it. Refer to 'man chkconfig' 
for details on disabling a system service. It should be as simple as,

# chkconfig akmods off

Store the sha sum of each file in first folder in a hash table (like C++
HashMap). Then start taking sha of each file in the second folder. If the
hash is already present just delete the file (duplicate file), if the hash
is not present keep the file in second folder or copy the file to the first
folder (or take necessary action as you like). This will just loop through
the contents of each folder only once. I guess this method is O(n).

Hope this helps,

Take a look @ "fdupes"

excerpt from man page

"Searches  the  given  path  for duplicate files. Such files are found
by comparing file sizes and MD5
       signatures, followed by a byte-by-byte comparison.

This is a steal :)

Re HW - a word of caution.  I have had failures with Atom boards -
both Intel and Digilite [1] boards (about 30%).

I suspect that those using this "server" would not be able to afford
extended down time.

I would suggest build in the cost of carrying a few extra boards for
faster turn around.

[1] Digilite replaces the boards over the counter @ their service
center but with Intel it takes about a week from RMA number to sending
a replacement.

Chinese retailers have started selling a miniature Linux computer that
is housed in a 3.5-inch plastic case slightly larger than a USB thumb
drive. Individual units are available online for $74.

The small computer has an AllWinner A10 single-core 1.5GHz ARM CPU, a
Mali 400 GPU, and 512MB of RAM. An HDMI port on the exterior allows
users to plug the computer into a television. It outputs at 1080p and
is said to be capable of playing high-definition video.

The device also has a full-sized USB port with host support for input
devices, a conventional micro-USB port, a microSD slot, and an
internal 802.11 b/g WiFi antenna. The computer can boot from a microSD
card and is capable of running Android 4.0 and other ARM-compatible
Linux platforms.............

Dear Friends,

I am trying to make few of my junior friends to take part in Open Source

Translation/localization doesn't require any programming experience.
One just needs to know to use the relevant tools (Examples: Zanata,
Transifex).

If their language skills are good, they can help with documentation
work (Examples: Publican, LaTeX).

People who are good in art can do design work (Examples: Gimp, Inkscape).

If communication skills are good, they can work in sales and marketing.

because they love what they do, and enjoy working in their field.

No. What I meant was that their approach is wrong.

If people enjoy and love what they work, everything else will follow
suit. But, if people do things on the pretext that they will or might
have a "great career", then they don't have a clear idea of what they
want to do.

Message-ID: <CALDskyzs3ejC+A0oFVQb4J-oD3pDon93f0Uz85KtC1oQpkURww@mail.gmail.com>

Okay this tutorial will cover how you can get packets into you network.

Not as replies or ACK packets to outbound traffic but hosting local
apps which can be accessed from the
outside world.

I dunno a single Indian company that is doing web hosting or any
hosting of applications with success.

There is a big player called Ctrl-S in Hyderabad but according to me
they are not a technical outfit just like
 any other Indian company. Started by people who are more business
focused than technically motivated
 the company does not seem to be making big inroads in local data
centers and stuff.

Even if you take God forsaken Reliance, Airtel, Tata or our own Sarkai
BSNL, they all suffer from technical
 incompetence in equal measure.

Anyway let us leave aside big boys that host websites, cloud and
applications with real public IP and stuff.

I have successfully run my mail server with an optic fiber static IP
block and nowadays I have at least
 3 machines in America which I can access publicly; so I have no
trouble about running any application
 with full access to the Internet.

In general to be able to run a website or any TCP application that
works on a public IP and public port that
 can be accessed from anywhere you should know how to let packets into
your network using your MODEM.

There is no need to run a real static IP but that will surely help.

You should be able to access a local machine's local port from a
public machine on the Internet by changing
the configuration on the MODEM.

How to achieve that?

This is a big complex , so I will cover this with care.

I really don't understand the concept of DMZ very well but I know this
much for my practical need that every MODEM
out there has a DMZ setting where you can give a local IP like 192.168.1.3.

And lo, all your packets showing up on the public interface of the
MODEM get automatically forwarded to this
 local IP with the effect that you can now run any service on any
port, UDP or TCP or even lower level and you can
 access it from the Internet.

This is somewhat easy.

Now if you are only interested in running a website just for the heck
of it,then you can port forward 80 to a local
 machine running Apache.

This is one idea.

Another is that you can use ssh remote port forwarding.

Just like you can port forward HTTP, you can port forward any TCP or
UDP port, of course this will not work with
 FTP, but this will work with rsync, ssh and many other protocols.

Okay you run broadband and don't have a static IP.

Now what?

Use my dynamic DNS service or create your own and use the DNS name to connect.

More on this later. What has skype and bittorrent got to do with all this?

Just that all these protocols allow incoming calls and connections
though they run behind a NAT in a broadband connection.

How is this done? There are many techniques to allow incoming
connections without active intervention like what we
 talked above using the MODEM configuration or running ssh port forwarding.

They mostly use a technique called UDP hole
punching(http://linuxjournal.com/9004) or some such to
 notify the public port we are running on and by simulating an
outgoing packet the incoming call is sent as a
 reply thus allowing incoming packets.

All firewalls/MODEM devices allow replies to outgoing packets on the
same port. They do not allow connections
 to machines inside the local LAN which is running on private IP
addresses anyway.

In a way NAT leads to a local of security eh?

Not sure, whether AMD based boards will fit in the above budget.  Because,
a college said the above price seems costly for them.

Hi,

Just found this in the Anna University web site. I was surprised to
find that there is an elective paper titled "Ethical Hacking &
Forensics" and that the recommended book is by Ankit Fadia. I think
this says a lot about the quality of the course itself..

The term "Ethical Hacking" is IMO not a good term :

Subject: [Ilugc] How to edit a file in a web interface?
Message-ID: <CALDskyykfjyNhXO57VGpEgE-g=P5tXKB0pq80CyrAu=5hJ5kRQ@mail.gmail.com>

In this tutorial I am talking about file editing in the backend as
that is what gets things going when you
 write a web interface.

Even if you are developing a user interface for making your product
user friendly the main backend operation
 is file editing.

So I have done quite a bit of this since the general mime for my
product is web panel for configuration
 and statistics and all the backend file manipulations are performed
by user input in the web panel.

Editing a file can be done in many languages, even C. But who will
write a C CGI?

I use perl and use it extensively. And you can directly edit a file
using perl CGI.

But I did something better.

I use Tie::File which is a standard perl module for manipulating files.

Basically it ties the file into a perl array using which you can
remove lines, add lines or edit lines
 using the same perl functions you use for array elements.

This does not make things really simple but I live with it.

I don't think there is a better way.

How do you do it?

I also do one more thing. When you save a value in the web interface,
the next time user clicks at
 that page the old value should be displayed. So editing a file also
means parsing it to display correctly.

I use Tie::File here also; except that I open the file in read only mode.

Here is a simple sample.

use Tie::File;
tie @f, "Tie::File", "/etc/passwd", mode => O_RDONLY;

for(@f) {
       print;
}
untie @f;

This will print the file contents. But you want only the patterns you
are interested in
 to show in a web interface.

Inside the for() loop you have to use regex.

for(@f) {
         if(/foo/) {
            ($dummy, $val) = split / /;
          }
}

Here, $val gets assigned to the value of interest.

Okay now let us get to editing it.

use Tie::File;
tie @f, "Tie::File", "example.conf";

for(@f) {
     if(/set/) {
          $_ = "changed line";
    }
}

untie @f;

Remember,  only when you untie the file,the internal array
representation is written back into the disk.

You can use array operations like appending lines to a file, deleting
lines using:

push @f, "another line";

or

@f = @f[1..3];

Lot of possibilities exist.

You are trying to educate folks on the list. Passing value judgements on
what others do is in real bad taste. Seems like self aggrandizement as
you'd go on late to say how you did it....... Humility has its value.

This is really no big deal. Folks have done this for ages. Not many in the

DMZ  (De-Militarised Zone is a standard term used in securing your
perimeter. It is a wartime terminology. Essentially, it divides the area
that needs to be protected into different zone with different  levels of
security and restrictions. Networks are treated the same way. Generally,
publicly accessible services behind a firewall are placed in a DMZ. The LAN
within the organisation would be treated as a core, highly secure network.
Good practice to restrict traffic would be

Public -> DMZ Allow using port forwarding. DMZ -> Public not allowed
LAN -> DMZ Allow using simple routing. DMZ -> LAN not allowed.
LAN -> Public Allow via proxies to monitor and restrict as needed, Public
-> LAN Not allowed.

Just like you can port forward HTTP, you can port forward any TCP or UDP

Applications are designed to use just one port ssh, apache etc) or two
ports (one for control and one for data - FTP, SIP etc). Port forwarding is
straightforward for single port applications. Dual port applications need
ALGs (Application level gateways) which will dynamically open up ports for
forwarding as new connections are established and new data ports negotiated.

Many MODEMs (misnomer as these are routers and not Modems) do have built in
ALGs for some applications like FTP.

Not something that is encouraged. Security by obscurity is not advisable
for serious use. Home use and low security profile needs could probably do
with this. I reckon if someone want to runs services for public access,
security is a serious concern.

Subject: [Ilugc] Product engineering
Message-ID: <CALDskyxc5ZDAapDYiprCAHVasVLDoxGXNCbPDiyz01CV78AFng@mail.gmail.com>

Creating products is not hard if you have around 7 years of experience
programming and solving hard problems.

The reason India does not have any worthwhile product companies is
that all the people I find here are too scared of
 doing great things; they are constantly slavishly following the
environment or trying to play safe.

This does not work. No it does not. By not being globally competitive
and by fearing to speak the truth and live
 by the truth you don't get very far.

Of course you avoid some immediate inconveniences but in the long run
you live somebody else's life and die a
 loser.

It is much better to die in the battle of living by one's values than
to simply play second fiddle.

I don't think it is easy to change.

K7 took 17 years to establish itself as a product brand, and even
today they are not the world's best.

Zoho and Vembu and few others are almost there but even they aren't top brands.

Only developed nations seem to produce product brands. But I dunno a
single Japanese brand in IT world.

And Samsung is from Korea, I dunno how developed they are.

Okay leave all that. Let us focus on our immediate task.

How to create a software product?

If you create worthwhile software people will purchase it off the
Internet; some US presence and contacts in
 nations with strong currency will help you but it is not a must.

The key thing is having a product that is truly unique and technically
superior to everything else.

This may sound like some MBA talk or something foreign from human
nature, education and culture but it has
 a lot to do with all that.

I consistently find that the top performers in engineering are from
very good colleges. Not necessarily with a
 computer science background; even I don't have it. In fact it is
better to have an electronics background as
 the curriculum is much harder.

Ultimately it is all individual initiative and one should truly enjoy
hard work and learning.

I used to have an employee who was interested in making it big but he
never enjoyed hard work and he was a
 narcissist, someone with an inflated idea of oneself.

The qualities needed to outperform everyone else is indomitable
patience, quiet courage and habit of hard
 work cultivated through years and years of academic success and study.

I was not great at scoring grades but I was very good at academics, I
study much more now than when I was 15
 and I truly enjoy studying.

Hard work is the credo. This is what makes developed nations what they
are. They work work and work as their society
  has no place for losers.

In our world mediocrity is the rule of the game; and if you are better
than others people are scared of you and refuse to
 use you to their advantage. People do not wish to give credit; they
want to hold on to their own foolish ideas breaking
 the universal law of karma and evanescent success.

Now let us think that you have the aforementioned qualities.

Now how to develop a product?

Take anything you love. First identify what you love. It is not easy;
takes a long time and as they say in romance, let it go.

It it comes back you know it is yours.

So identify your romance.

Then pursue it with all your heart.Does not matter whether there is
competition or not. Make sure that what you do has a
 market and buyers.

Don't live in the past of future. Think of the present.

There are plenty of problems that require solving. Apply yourself to
it and give it your best.

But remember, your success depends on several factors including your
karma. Unless you are destined to win no victory
 is guaranteed.

But work is the reward. No job satisfaction in making 10000$ a month
in a foreign land can stand up against the satisfaction in
 living life of your conviction.

Vivekananda never knew where he would sleep, how he would eat the next
food. But today he is a hero. He lived by what he
 believed it.

So first find your conviction and work hard to realize your dreams.

Product development is not really that hard.

If you are convinced that you love some technology, make sure that you
use as many components that are readily available in
the open source world for it. Don't sit and do it yourself. Do what is
not already there.

Create real value, real meaning.

Just writing a 2000 line ruby on rails or python script that does a
faster download is not a product.

A product has to be fairly big.

But not too big. Don't write an operating system or an ERP engine.

Instead create something of medium size:

Some ideas are:

1)  Anything to do with SQL migration
2) ISP link load balancer
3) Firewall
4) Some LiveCD or LiveUSB focusing on a particular domain like
multimedia, crypto or even Tamizh
5) E-mail based solutions like mobile phone clients
6) Some iPhone app

And so on.

Basically build on top of some open source technology that is quite popular.

Make something easy. Or find a new application for a new field.

Basically try to ride on some other success by someone else and create
your own niche.

Be honest, satisfy your technical libido and add unique value.

Now after you create your product what next?

You have to monetize it and convert that into money, find users, find customers.

How to do that?

Not easy. But doable.

Google Adwords is one choice but that costs money. Look for friends
living in foreign lands and find out
 if they can talk to resellers.

Look for competition, use linkedin and find partners of competitors.

A lot of ways are there to push your technology.

The real challenge however is creating something of great value. That
takes great engineering lot of time and
 great talent.

And after you work for one year or more on something then talk to
people to find out how to market it.

Don't try to sell weekend projects.

I have fallen into this trap before.

It is something very hard to convince ourselves that only when our
product is ready in all respects the market will
 pay money for it.

In a larger enterprise context this is extended further:

1. There are two levels of firewalls 1) between Public to DMZ network
and 2) between DMZ to LAN. These are physically different devices
and sometimes even from different vendors.

2. Sometimes traffic within a single DMZ is further controlled through
Private VLANs. Eg 1) an enterprise DMZ network can host hundreds
of servers/applications. If one application is compromised the entire
DMZ is exposed through this server/application. Eg. 2) If you use a
web server + DB and web server is compromised the DB is totally
exposed. Private VLANs are used to split a DMZ into smaller segments.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_VLAN

In several industries like banking and financial institutions, most of
this is regulated and subject to routine audits. Eg. RBI, BSE/NSE
routinely audit banks and stock traders and can revoke a license
if non-compliant. Other organizations would do self audits or as
requested by their customers.

Enterprise IT security is difficult. There's a lot of technology, cost and
effort involved, plus there's always new challenges to overcome.
Suppose that's what security folks like about their work :-)

Good exposition.

For advanced edits, perhaps one should consider openoffice running in
headless mode; IIRC, Alfresco does that for the common doc,
spreadsheet etc. formats.

TCP window scaling can get the remote end to slow down and
reduce your incoming packet rate.

Queueing UDP flows individually and introducing artificial latency
can control well behaved UDP applications.

Read how proprietary vendors like BlueCoat PacketShaper and
Allot Communications NetEnforcer devices can shape inbound
traffic. They can also shape a single tcp flow asymmetrically, ie.
provide 1Mbps of downstream bandwidth for POP3 and only
128kbps of upstream (POP is download only).

I agree. This is a computer security course and the term "Hacking" is 
just purely misleading even though it might be attractive to the college 
students.

There should have been a section on History such as the one here,

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_computer_security_hacker_history

IMO, Without understanding the history, It will be hard to understand 
the purpose of various things in the course.

To me, the course seems like an introduction to various terminologies 
around computer security. I doubt that at the end of the course, any 
student will be able to crack or secure anything.

Just my 2 cents.

Why not go for ARM? ARM servers started appearing. It is cheap and consumes
less energy than Intel and AMD boards (I don't have any numbers to show
it). If people are going to run Linux servers they have a set of processors
to choose from. Intel and AMD processors are market dominant but it does
not mean ARM cannot be used. This is just my opinion.

Absolutely. In addition, nowadays ECN is also being used though there are
not very many devices that honour this yet. Dropping packets on the
incoming interface is a sure way of slowing down specific incoming traffic.

Dropping packets will cause sender/receiver to retransmit and increase
traffic on loaded links and decrease performance even further. TCP window
scaling is the best method of shaping bandwidth as it has no retransmission
and is universally accepted. This is a key differentiator of bandwidth shaping
appliances vs buffering/queueing done in routers.

I have a Pogo Plug device has 1.2 GHz ARM, 512MB RAM, 128MB
NAND flash, 1 Ethernet and 4 USB ports. Totally solid state, under 5W
power draw and runs Debian nicely. Retails for $40, not sure about
availability in India. I have a 1TB USB HDD and wifi dongle hooked
up to it. Newer versions include eSATA and wifi.

Not as powerful as Atom but it's good for a mini-NAS and home use.

Routers need not participate or even be aware of it.

TCP window scaling works between source/destination. TCP window is an
integral part of an kernel's network stack so it's always available.

Bandwidth shaping devices monitor and control TCP/UDP flows. TCP window
is resized on a per-flow and per-direction basis to control bandwidth usage.

    Or, use the available ldap tools from command line. You will have
to do something like this from your Linux/UNIX clients.

$ldapsearch -h host_ip -D "cn=admin,dc=domain,dc=domain" -b "your base
dn" "cn=some.user.id" -x -W

It will prompt for password. and you can get the LDAP data for the
user "some.user.id". Here is a proper example.

root at openldap:~# ldapsearch -h openldap.bala.domain -D
"cn=admin,dc=bala,dc=domain" -b "dc=bala,dc=domain" "cn=user1" -x -W
Enter LDAP Password:
# extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
# base <dc=bala,dc=domain> with scope subtree
# filter: cn=user1
# requesting: ALL
#

# user1, people, master, bala.domain
dn: cn=user1,ou=people,ou=master,dc=bala,dc=domain
uid: user1
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: posixAccount
userPassword:: dXNlcjE=
uidNumber: 50000
gidNumber: 1
sn: user1
homeDirectory: /home/user1
mail: user1 at bala.domain
cn: user1


If you are able to get these kind of responses on doing ldap queries,
then your LDAP server is OK and your clients are able to access the
data there. Then, you need to change the PAM and NSS. You have to
configure nsswitch.conf to use ldap and IIRC login in /etc/pam.d/.

When you say you couldn't authenticate clients, what errors do you see
? Did you capture them with wireshark(tshark in case there is no GUI
on the server). Please share such results on the list. Thanks

I dunno about Iptables but in general a firewall rule engine will
 do the following:

1) NAT and PAT and port forwarding for incoming connections
2) Block ports and IP addresses, both from and to , incoming and outgoing
3) More

Now from your standpoint you get the ability to secure your system by
shutting off
 all but the important traffic.

That way you are fairly safe. But with snort you can do better.

That is an IDS and an IPS too.

I have to learn how to use snort...

In short, the following are the components of iptables,

- Tables  : filter/nat/mangle/raw    --- Each of them have their purpose
- Chains  : INPUT/OUPUT/FORWARD etc. --- Like a network packet state
- Target  : ACCEPT/DROP/LOG/REDIRECT --- The action to perform
- Matches : connlimit/owner/limit    --- Modules for packet matching

Now to give an example, one can add a rule saying,

Table:filter->Chain:OUTPUT->Match:owner:dipin->Target:DROP

The above rule will discard all outgoing packets for owner 'dipin', this 
is similar to saying deny network access for user 'dipin'.

iptables is a complex system, there are several chains and several 
extensions for Target and Matches. Trying to know all the features of 
iptables will take time. The better approach would be to sit down and 
come up with a security policy and implement it using iptables.

Initramfs means ... initial file system in random
access memory.

It lets your computer boot before its real
file system is mounted.

To fix the problem, maybe you could search Google
for the specific error message.

I hope that helps,
Kingsley

The AMD E-350 based boards have SVM virtualisation and support for up
to 8GB are more feature rich compared to the Intel Atom boards (IMO)
but they also cost more; in the Rs. 6500 price range (in Mumbai) about
two months ago.  They may be more now with the current Re/$ exchange
rate.

The AMD solutions may not fit in the budget (see my other post in this thread)

Wow, I am surprised by their reaction, perhaps this is their tactic to
"squeeze" the maximum out of you.

Have they given you a number that they feel is the "right" price for
this box (HW+SW)?

A suggestion - give the college the hardware spec and let them source
it from the "preferred" vendor and charge your reasonable professional
fee to install the packages.   Make it clear that all hardware
warranty issues - they will have to work out with their vendor.
Power to them if the total cost comes out lower than your quotation.

This is one of the methods I use when a few of my clients play hard
ball with the cost.   Do not undersell your value added effort +
service.

+1 , this works out for me too and yes agree completely with the undersell
part , in extreme cases use the line two things motivates me " Charity or
Money " any respectful person would not want a charity to be done and he
pays without further a do , you still  will find few shameless people,so
you need to develop the instinct to stay away from them , IMHO you know
your business better than anyone else , we  need not tell you how to close
a sale etc you should have been gone through all these cycles multiple
times by now.

all the best in your venture ..!!!

Hi Team,



Recently installed mediawiki in GNU/Linux box. We have a requirement
that mediwiki to be accessed through secure login. Purpose is to give
access for particular teams and not for all. Any suggestions will be
very much appreciated.

Your requirement is very vague. If you are talking of authentication,
LDAP[1] / CAS[2] authentication extensions can help. If its about setting
up a private wiki read[3]. If you want part of wiki to be non-editable read
$wgNamespaceProtection[4]. You can try extensions[5][6] to enforce access
controls for reading at your own risk for 2 reasons.
1 - As the disclaimer says Mediawiki is not built partial page access
restrictions(for reading), you might be better off choosing a proper CMS
for that
2. These extensions have not yet been certified on 1.19 or even 1.18 for
that matter, so you will have to break your head if it doesn't work.

requirement is simple.

when users click say  abc.com/mediawiki they should be prompted for
authentication after that users will have normal access to mediawiki.


If this can be done through LDAP can you please provide the possiblites.

Before file system gets mounted there is need for some device drivers
and other things (a shell, init application etc). These are stored in
initramfs file. Without that kernel will not have any process to run
(init is process 1, kernel is considered process 0).

Glad to hear the good news. How is this relevant to be discussed on
ILUGC mailing list? You haven't mentioned if it is in any way related
to Linux or free software. If it is not, it is clearly a bad practice
to post such emails to a mailing list. Imho, even tagging this OT
wouldn't have been acceptable. Kindly avoid sending such emails to the
list.

To: <mailinglist at fsftn.org>

Dear Friends,

Even though many of you may already know the difference between Free
Software and Open Source software, I would like to clarify further in
simple terms and also share some thoughts as to why this difference is
important.

?Free Software compels the derivatives to be Free Software, whereas Open
Source software relaxes the freedom to restrict the derivatives?

What does this mean?
Open Source projects may give rise to the possibility of stopping
redistribution of its derivatives. This is because Open Source ideology
permits it. In the case of a free software license, there would be no way
to stop the distribution of its derivatives.

Thus, we see that a project that has been created for the community by the
community can be restricted and commercialized in such a way that its
benefits do not reach the community properly. Open Source ideology permits
such an activity. It restricts the free transmission of knowledge..

Please note, one can still make money out of Free Software and this can be
done even while permitting the distribution of knowledge which rightly
belongs to the people and society.

We all know the reason why the Free Software movement exists - it exists as
an alternative to proprietary software that restricts knowledge. But
considering the above explanation, I feel that Open Source might be ?the
future face of proprietary software?.

Of course, it will not be as harmful as the proprietary software is now.
But in a future where proprietary models lose their relevance, open source
technology might become a big hurdle to the sharing of knowledge. That is
why I call Open Source ?the future face of proprietary software?.

Whatever stops the natural spread of knowledge through society is harmful
to society. As students, workers and activists who specialize in
technology, it is our duty to take a stand; a stand on the side of the
people, society and for the free sharing of knowledge.

In this context, let us consider another term Free & Open Source
Software(FOSS).

Many use FOSS as a compromise. They think by using this term, they can
satisfy both sides. But as we have seen above, Free Software and Open
Source software are built on two different ideas. Bringing the two together
does not make any sense. As activists, the kind of language we use is very
important because we are setting standards for the rest of the community.
When we use the term FOSS, we are confusing people who end up thinking Free
Software and Open Source software are the same thing.

Once again. let us remember that Free Software stands for a system where
knowledge belongs to the community.

       Good that you are getting help from the list, but at the same
time, it would be nice if you do not put people to inconvenience by
top posting. When you top post, it is difficult to read it in a
mailing list. The list guidelines say that. You would have received a
mail with a link to the guidelines when you joined the list. And there
have been numerous discussions going on with people requesting others
not to top post. So, please stop posting. The correct way of replying
to mails on a mailing list is to use interleaved posting.

If you keep top posting, you will probably lose potential answers
because, I know a lot of people who are put off by top posts. They
just ignore the mail and there the OP loses a reply. Thanks

As the title suggests "Guidelines and General Information for Setting Up 
of International Gateways for Internet", they are merely guidelines. 
Even if it is enforced, it has to be done in some legal format where the 
words like "individual" or "group" or "organization" are defined.

Besides, restricting RSA does not mean they was to ban SSH, it is of 
least concern. They are used in SSL which will have a serious impact 
when it comes to banking. Also, there is *no* 40-bit RSA (usually 
512/1028/2048/4096 bits). Using 40-bit RSA key, is like multiplication 
using 13 or 14 digit numbers, which is ridiculous, you might as well use 
plain text for that matter. They probably meant 40-bit DES ie., a shared 
secret encryption. In which case, like 3 DES, you can use four 40-bit 
keys to achieve a reasonably safe 160-bit encryption, so I am not quite 
sure what they are trying to achieve.

And, the concept of outlawing encryption by the government (entirely) is 
an age old tactic which is hard to enforce.

Seeing it on Hacker 'news' I assumed it was new :-)

Thanks for the sleuthing. It need not worry us. Most likely no one even in
the govt knows it exists. Unless someone in the govt follows HN and wakes
up to this and starts hounding ISPs!

Message-ID: <CAHhM8gCgOm7tjLLX2C_iOyzmcMdYEKq5n64_exdy-NfwzWGixA@mail.gmail.com>

Using 'dd' to make a backup of an openwrt image (that has been
installed and configured) on a 64MB CF card

# dd if=/dev/sdb of=openwrt.10.03.1_alix_installation.backup.img bs=4K

15648+0 records in

but the copy is done but with return code = 1

# ls -l openwrt.10.03.1_alix_installation.backup.img
-rw-r--r-- 1 root  root  64094208 May 27 16:49
openwrt.10.03.1_alix_installation.backup.img

This shows it indeed copied over 64MB into the backup image file.

# file -s openwrt.10.03.1_alix_installation.backup.img
openwrt.10.03.1_alix_installation.backup.img: x86 boot sector; GRand

63, 28609 sectors; partition 2: ID=0x83, starthead 7, startsector
28672, 96513 sectors, code offset 0x48

This shows that indeed the file is a hard disk image with two
partitions in it with GRUB as the boot loader.

# fdisk -l openwrt.10.03.1_alix_installation.backup.img

fdisk also recognizes the file as a hard disk image with two partitions.

If there were i/o errors with the CF card then I think there would
have been errors reported by the above tools.

Any hypothesis for this anamoly?

Try to mount it as loop device and check. If not try /dev/sdb1
(partition instead of full disk). I am not sure of what is going
wrong. But just giving this a try should not do any harm.

dd is trying to read past end of device and failing?

A little OT, but related:

tar is far more flexible than dd for backup/restore tasks. You
don't require the disks/filesystems to be of exactly same size.

Not all 64MB CF cards are exactly same size. I've had issues
with HDDs which were not exactly same size. Eg. two 200GB
HDDs from different vendors are not exactly same. Or even
disks from different batches of the same vendor.

This is a pain if you don't plan in advance and use the entire disk
while creating RAID arrays. If a disk fails and the replacement
is slightly smaller than the originals, you cannot rebuild the
array easily. As a safety measure, I never use the entire disk
but always round off and leave the last 2-3GB unused while
creating RAID sets.

Subject: [Ilugc] e-mail internals part I
Message-ID: <CALDskyyh+_z1qOV=yqqbx83OixwQhJRPkHmNntzjSO+br3=KQQ@mail.gmail.com>

An e-mail sent from mail ID A to mail ID B goes through certain
manipulations and
 several layers of protocols and wrapping, unwrapping before it is delivered.

This article analyzes all that.

And guess what? Even this is sent on an e-mail.

Let us take the simplest example first. What is the bare minimum that
is required to
 do this job?

If we understand simple things we can get our head around complexity later.

Okay let us begin.

girish at gayatri-hitech.com sends a mail to ilugc at ae.iitm.ac.in

This is the process:

A mail is typed on what is called as MUA or mail user agent.

MS Outlook, mutt, webmail(browser) or Evolution are all MUAs.

The way the mail is handed over to the Mail server or MTA(mail transfer agent)
 is using the SMTP protocol. But not the real SMTP which comes after that.

Normally in a network of say 3000 computers on a LAN, and even some VPN nodes
 remotely situated on the Internet, one mail server caters to all the 3000 MUAs
running on various client machines.

So an e-mail envelope just like a physical letter has two addresses,
from address
 and to address. In our case, the from is girish at gayatri-hitech.com.
It is important
 since in the case of courier or registered post, it has to come back
to you if the
 to address is wrong.

The to address is ilugc at ae.iitm.ac.in which has to now be broken up
into two parts.

User name ilugc and destination mail server domain which is ae.iitm.ac.in.

The MTA serving the 3000 nodes now has to talk SMTP to the process listening on
 ae.iitm.ac.in.

It does an MX record check like this:

$ dig +short ae.iitm.ac.in mx
10 www.ae.iitm.ac.in.
20 mailx1.iitm.ac.in.

$ dig +short www.ae.iitm.ac.in
203.199.213.51

$ nc -v 203.199.213.51 25
Connection to 203.199.213.51 25 port [tcp/smtp] succeeded!
220 aeserver.ae.iitm.ac.in ESMTP Postfix

As you can see above the mx is actually a host name and then find out
the IP address and
 finally we connect to the IP address and its 25 port.

Now the SMTP conversation starts like this:

EHLO gayatri-hitech.com
<pleased to meet you...>
MAIL FROM: <girish at gayatri-hitech.com>
<OK>
RCPT TO: <ilugc at ae.iitm.ac.in>
<OK>
DATA
<331 End mail with a .>
Test mail
.
<OK Queued for delivery with id 0x3243243>
quit

That is it!

I have shown the mail server responses with a <>.

This is how an e-mail is sent.

Now the story does not complete here.

Once the mail reaches the server, it is stored in the mail box of the user
 ilugc.

The mail is ready by the destination user using his MUA just like the sender,
 when he downloads the mail using POP3 or IMAP.

He fetches the mail and the mail client or MUA unwraps the mail and
displays it in
 a window.

This is for simple text mail.

In case you are sending in HTML or attaching a video or mp3 or doc file, then
 also text is used to transmit mail.

But it is binary data encoded as text.

And there is an envelope format in which MIME encoding is used to separate out
 multiple MIME sections.

A boundary line will separate each section.

Each section corresponds to an attachment and the MUA displays it accordingly.

Mails are stored in the server after SMTP conversation using several methods,
 Maildir, MH, mbox and mboxrd.

Maildir is best.

Each mail is stored as a file in a directory MAILBOX/new. Every
maildir location
 has three directories:

new/
cur/
tmp/

This is to ensure that new mails being delivered do not overwrite existing ones.

In addition to all this there will be queuing, backup mx records, pipelining and
 several other advanced topics which I will cover in a later mail.

I will also show in the second part of this article a typical MIME
encoded message.

I have given introduction to VPN in some of the mails before.

Now I will try to give more data/info along the same lines.

VPN binds together multiple branch offices worldwide, within the same
city, country wherever.

It really does not count. It could even connect your home and work
just 1 mile away.

And you can run a VPN even when you have one office by connecting to
the office from
 a home PC or a laptop in a net cafe.

The idea is that it will connect together multiple networks.

Which means that you can run any application meaning any application remotely.

You can access remote Windows shares, run your tally accounts or
access your company's mail server.

>From the use case angle, VPNs offer wide possibilities and it is a
really cool tool.

So we are going to target not only businesses with multiple locations,
even a business with one office
 will need it. I will tell you why.

They usually have a stores or a godown. If they have a computer there
they will need it.

And the boss or the IT guy will access it from home.

The idea is that although you have got tools like teamviewer, VNC and
ssh to do remote connections,
  they all have restrictions.

Teamviewer is the only software that will run from anywhere. You can
run a remote teamviwer session
 and access any computer in any network.

But the issue is you cannot access the Windows file share and transfer data.

You cannot access the remote FTP or web server.

To do that you need VPN.

And you cannot run VNC without a static IP.

ssh will not work without static IP and so on.

You could do ssh remote port forwarding but you require a 3rd node.

VPN simplifies everything.

But it comes with price attached.

Not money. ;)

VPN requires a VPN server running in the office and the MODEM should point the
  DMZ traffic to it.

Normally every MODEM has a NAT section and  DMZ link where you can add a
local IP address where every TCP and UDP port , also ICMP is mapped to from
its public interface.

The VPN should run on that local IP.

Now from anywhere on the Internet you can connect to the office by setting up a
 VPN to the public IP of the network.

Whenever traffic shows up on the public IP it will go to the DMZ host
which in turn sets
 up a VPN and you are set.

In other words for a VPN setup you certainly require access to the
MODEM to do DMZ
 forwarding.

Since VPN requires incoming traffic to reach it as it is a server
inside every site in the VPN
 network DMZ configuration of MODEM is required.

However for client access from remote, this is not needed.

It is outgoing traffic which is allowed by every MODEM.

Presume exim/dovecote are MTA, what then is fetchmail/sendmail?
By the way do we have a console based IM?

Good idea. You don't have to be so humble towards me as though I am some
 teacher or something.

Chill out.

I will think about it. It is better to write and article in my website
and post the link here.

I shall follow the advice. Thanks.

Exim is an MTA. Dovecot is an IMAP server and POP3 got added later to it.

Mutt, Outlook, Evolution are all MUAs.

And Webmail works differently.

The browser acts as an MUA and the server that does the mail handling using
 server side language like perl CGI or PHP actually uses IMAP and SMTP
for the work.

So the browser as a whole acts as a MUA.

But certain webmail implementations may directly read the mailbox from
the server.

I dunno what you mean by console based IM?

Yes, Bitlbee is there; you can do yahoo! chat from the ASCII terminal.
It is totally out of
 syllabus with what we are talking. I am not interested in integrating
chat with mail.

A unified messaging solution that also works on mobile, tweets and so
on, fb integration
 would be nice but it should be done properly. For now e-mail should
be the focus...

fetchmail and getmail are just IMAP and POP clients that download
mails from a server to
 a local storage which can then be read using an MUA.

But mutt comes with built in IMAP POP3 client, SMTP client and so on.

It is really cool, the best mail MUA. It also integrates with vim and
other UNIX shell commands nicely.

The most powerful way to handle mail sending and parsing replies.

It has got colors and highlights and what not.

I think it is much better than nail/nmh which I dunno how to use.

An e-mail envelope consists of a long list of headers and
 several MIME sections.

A typical e-mail has the following headers:

Subject

This is a really long list of key value pairs.

Each key value pair is separated by a colon.

This mail was a plaintext mail, so there were no MIME boundaries or
sections below.

Just a plain text after the headers.

The way you identify where the message starts and header ends is a blank line.

I will show you a MIME message with an image attachment.

This is what mutt shows:

      1 <no description>
                                  [multipa/alternativ, 7bit, 0.4K]
      2 +-><no description>
                                [text/plain, 7bit, us-ascii, 0.1K]
      3 +-><no description>
                                 [text/html, 7bit, us-ascii, 0.2K]
  A     4 conky.png
                                            [image/png, base64, 14K]

And the raw base64 encoded MIME portion is:

--2065536479-949695544-1338261285=:11684
Content-Type: multipart/alternative;
boundary="2065536479-1283923839-1338261285=:11684"

--2065536479-1283923839-1338261285=:11684
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii



--2065536479-1283923839-1338261285=:11684
Content-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii

<html><body><div style="color:#000; background-color:#fff;
font-family:times new roman, new york, times,
serif;font-size:12pt"><div></div></div></body></html>
--2065536479-1283923839-1338261285=:11684--
--2065536479-949695544-1338261285=:11684
Content-Type: image/png; name="conky.png"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="conky.png"

iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAS4AAAIfEAIAAAARfHrCAAAACXBIWXMAAAsS
AAALEgHS3X78AAArV0lEQVR42u3daawtSUEA4PcuF8VxISweBxBEYNh3GIcd
WeWKg/dOZhwM/iAoQohhkczIIkEjP8i7GgRREYIQjEKC4R5xISph1BERRDYB

And it continues.

When you unpack the MIME using

$munpack < foo.txt

then you get the image file.

As we see here e-mail is always a text protocol.

You send binary data by encoding in text and you pack in MIME.

To ensure that MUAs that cannot render HTML can render in text and so on.

MIME helps us send multiple attachments in the same mail.

And how does the mail server handle sending mail to a group of users?

Mail servers handles not only this but several other complex
algorithmic and protocol
 complexities like queuing, stress management, scaling and so on.

Common mail servers are Postfix written by Vietse Wenema, Qmail by DJ
Bernstien, the
crazy Jew prof , sendmail which is a dinosaur, exim , MS Exchange.

Zimbra, Scalix, Kerio and so on are built on top of these MTAs.

They are not low level mail implementations.

Later.

Hi,
      With due respect , as has been said earlier why don't you blog and
give people links to read , have you given a though of  writing  a book ,
if not i think its time ,  if you can post your topics in some wiki
 somewhere , i am sure more people will pitch in .

Writing a book is not something I want to do.

I want to start a training institute to raise the level of IT
knowledge in India.

I have been wailing about the poor state of affairs for years, but
nobody wants to
 look beyond Linux. People do not even try FreeBSD.

My idea is to share practical knowledge in the form of workshops and
hands on training
 using staff and if possible also hire people from that.

The training and learning industry is also quite low class and not to my taste.

It is full of low cadre people who are good for nothing; who only talk
, talk and talk.

Whereas knowledge sharing is meant for people with real life problem
solving experience.

But no use blaming. That is just the way things are.

I have done training for a living; I burnt my fingers. As to writing a
book it is worse.

I am happy doing this.

Well said. Very wise words from a person of your age. 

A blog and this mailing list would be a very good avenue for your efforts.

       It was suggestion made by Amaachu. It depends on what most
people feel about it. I, for one, am quite comfortable reading these
mails, rather than reading it from a blog. Not because I am averse
blogs or some such reason, but because, when emails are the least
distraction, and it is a simple texts that we read.

        What I would suggest is, something like what
Bharathi/Dhastha(not sure if it is this glug) used to do(for one day
one command and one app one day).

May be Girish could add a tag called "Technology Internals" or some
thing better(I am not that good with these kind of naming), so that
people could filter by that and refer to them whenever needed. Again,
this is just a suggestion. It depends mostly on his convenience. He is
doing a nice job of explaining how various stuff works and it
definitely does benefit a lot. So, let's just use it :) Thanks

IT is a very generic term , yes there are so many parts to it which we feel
should or could have been better .

its about choice and perceptions they think Linux will get them a Job, fame
, money or whatever , yes i do understand the point you are trying to make
its a mix of philosophy and being practical and reality which folks fail to
understand.

Hmm since you have tasted both the training and writing a book , i am still

hey it not that i am averse to his posts , its just that i want him to read
through posterity , and benefit in the process. Its my personal interest to
see creative people to make money in whatever they do be it coding ,
writing books or just an art i do not differentiate between them.

his posts are not as generic to make it Topic of the day , may be he can
get into the habit like Topic of the week or Month and would be writing a
better one that what it is in the present form i am sure on the adhoc basis
and in the spurt of some triggers.

 Three cheers for Girish! I am one of the low level varieties benefiting from the write in,
grappling with it still. Switched to Linux when my PIII stopped playing along with Windows upgrades,
no complaints at all!!

So every s/w developed went through a development practice - even if it was
not consciously done. Clients might feel comfortable if a vendor has a
documented s/w dev practice - on the assumption that it is actually
followed :-)

          Software development practices are applicable to any
software - irrespective of open source or not. The term, simply put,
means an organised and scientific way of creating software. To state a
few examples: use of a version control system, collecting and
documenting the requirements for which we are developing the software,
etc.

In the open source world, development practices include having a
writing well-commented code, dev wiki, dev mailing list, a public bug
tracker, (at least) a basic How To for the users, a proper build
system,  etc. Thanks

Just thinking aloud...
Does sending a message from ID A to ID B along with a few attachments be
this complicated? Is the email system a dinosaur of the past which still
survives because of the `inconvenience ` of change?

Hi all

This is udayasankar,Let me intruduce my self. Iam working as Systems
Engineer in VKS Farms & Exports Pvt Limited,Coimbatore.

I have some technical doubts in Linux.Let me explain the scenario .

My Company has a small Data center.It houses 5 Linux servers for our
Mail  & SAP -Erp Application and 1 windows  server. for ADS.

We have about 100 Desktops and it is installed with Windows XP in the
remote branches .These clients are connected in the  MPLS,Broad band
Network.

 My Team has planned to migrate to Linux Client.So i have decided to
use Redhat Linux flavour and also i have planed to use NIS server for
Authenticating the Clients.


My Doubts:

1) Is NIS enough for Authentication ?
2) Is NIS Authenticated through broad band connection ?
3) Should i Pay any thing to Redhat for using these things?


Kindly give me the sugesstions and Solutions


Thanking You.
C.V.Udayashankar

Not sure if I understand you correctly, so:
Are you migrating the 100 windows xp systems to redhat? Could you tell us
why redhat over other variants?

Ubuntu desktop LTS 12.04 may be a better option.  IMO RHEL is a server
distro; it does have the desktop packages buut they may not be the
latest version.   Go with CentOS, it is based on RHEL source RPMs.

Why do you want to NIS when you have MS - ADS.  ADS is based on LDAP
and Kerberos platform.   NIS is older technology and no point rolling
that when you already have a better platform.

> 2) Is NIS Authenticated through broad band connection ?

You mention MPLS and I am guessing this is MPLS VPN.   If so, then you
already have the infrastructure in place.   With MPLS VPN, your entire
company is one big LAN.   The ADS should be visible to all locations
within the VPN.   You may want to have backup ADS for fail over
scenarios.    Any Linux distro should have the libraries to
Authenticate the users and services with ADS.

To the best of my knowledge RHEL license is *not* free (except for a
trial period) so this question is irrelevant.  Yes, you have to pay
Redhat if you intend to use their products in a "production" mode.

       SMTP is actually quite simple :) Everything is text, plain or
encoded. That's all there is to it. It is storing the mail in the box,
indexing it, retrieving it that is a little complex.

I am supposed to write something on this topic. Searching the web is

a position to elaborate on the conventional meaning of this term.

project and project timeline.

Girish is developing a Spam protection product.
Spam is practically cancer for the email system.
Can't this be sorted out at a lower level instead of having supervisory
systems around it?

I know nothing of email internals. Consider this as a newbie question.

Hi,

Any recommendations for Linux based media center distros?
I know I can search the net for this, but this is one question for which I
would prefer an interactive human suggestion from experienced people
locally :)

It's for my home and it should  be able to

   - Work solely connected to a TV (I can upload content using FTP from my
   laptop or connect an external hard drive)
   - Preferably be able to work with a remote (I can build the remote
   control if its open hardware)
   - Primarily playback video and audio through VGA out and audio out.
   - Preferably be able to stream through WiFi/LAN to Android based tablets
   and other PCs

Thanks!

Regards,
Arun

+1. I run it on an Apple TV2 and it's excellent.

To: geogebra-india <geogebra-india at googlegroups.com>


Dear Colleagues in India,

I would like to kindly ask for your help.
GeoGebra is still not available in Hindi, so a translation would
really be necessary in order that it get to more users.Other local
Indian languages would be also very great.
Could anyone please assist us in this? Or could you suggest anyone who
could help us?
You can find all the necessary details here:
http://wiki.geogebra.org/en/Translation_of_GeoGebra
and in particular here:
http://wiki.geogebra.org/en/Translation_GUI
Let me know.
Thanks so much in advance.
Kind Regards,
Julia Vida
GeoGebra Institutes Coordinator

Subject: [Ilugc] Introduction to basic crypto
Message-ID: <CALDskywasP3+X6oLqxsP9GfzLLG9nAJ5JA7DLu_x7ESXRMDdGg@mail.gmail.com>

Cryptography as a discipline is not easy for anyone to learn.

I remember how poor the knowledge is in the IITM computer science
department. And also
 in the industry in Bangalore, Chennai and so on.

In general computer security involves a great deal of mathematical
ability, a high quality
 consciousness followed by a decent level of background knowledge.

What makes crypto so hard?

Although a topic like networking takes  a lot of experience and
knowledge to become
 established in your psyche(and I am still learning), crypto is not
only experience but also
 math and logic.

It is common sense but that sort of common sense is rare.

For instance the first thing they say is that secrecy of algorithm is
not security.

Hiding your ssh port by running it on a different port is not
security. Changing the greeter of
 your protocol and changing the signature of certain protocols is not security.

Real security comes with doggedness, clean habits, discipline, being
on top of the alerts and
 patches and so on and of course running an excellent operating system.

Most of the security loopholes we find are due to the C compiler not
doing bounds checking
 causing buffer overflows.

Then you have SQL injection, broken protocols, user auth and so on.

Cryptography can only solve certain issues like ensuring data
integrity through signatures,
 confidentiality through symmetric encryption and secure
authentication using password
 hashing or some other technique.

For the rest you need other tools.

And usually security is obtained at the cost of convenience.

In an increasingly networked world with social engineering and so on
with mobile phones
connected to the web security will continue to be a concern.

People think spam control is also a security topic.

To a certain extent yes.

But core security is mostly about which authentication technique to
use, how to improve
 the physical security, data leakage prevention by using a good
firewall to inspect mail
traffic and uploads, snort for intrusion detection and so on.

Security is a process and not a product.

You would be held in much better light if you do not pass such value
judgements. My interactions with IISc has been good. I reckon IITM would
fall in the same category. Generally speaking, industry would implement
standards chosen by bodies but not research into algorithms - this is
typically the domain of academia. Inspite of this, I've met guys who know
the subject in depth.

This whole post is a meandering one and a rant with little connection to
the subject line. There are just a few lines on where crypto is used, but
barely anything worthy of being called an introduction.

I've restrained from posting repartees and I guess so have many to the
inane comments and judgements you assert in your posts. I do not doubt what
you know. If you intend spreading knowledge, do so selflessly without
trashing others.

I am sure, this is not the first time such feedback has been posted. 
Unfortunately, without any disrespect to OP, they have been falling into 
deaf ears.

      Try adding the -v flag for verbosity, and then paste the results
again. Also, paste a proper ldif files here(may be with false data) so
that we can see if the file is OK. Also, the last comment says you
need to do a successful bind. Make sure your admin user name and

Installing ns2 in fedora 16 is a great problem....

Is there any suggested methods for installing ns2 in fedora 16?

I have no installation problems....

My Path to the libraries are set....

But, My validation fails due to some failures in tests belonging to
Tcl\Test,,,,

Thanks in Advance....
