EEEPC comes with Xandros but you can get it working on any Linux
distribution. The latest models require third party modules to get the
wireless up and running but this is hardly going to take a few more mins.

Acer Aspire One with comes with Linpus, a derivative of Fedora. Plain
Fedora works fine.

Dell Mini - Comes with Ubuntu but the Intel driver has some proprietary
components that makes it a hassle to upgrade or switch to another Linux
distribution. I don't recommend it at all.

Can't give you recommendations on where to buy these in Chennai though.

Hi !

This is very true .

http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1530558/ubuntu-broken-dell-inspiron-mini

Bottom line is , no netbook /laptop manufacturer supports Linux as the
main distribution due to pressure from the big brother. (
http://www.itwire.com/content/view/25275/1141/ )

And distro makers can not support all the available netbook /laptop
models. So the end user is left to tinker with the linux
netbooks/laptops  on their own and depend on forums or their local
linux guru !

This is not totally true at the moment. As far as I know, Ubuntu
Netbook Remix and Moblin work on a number of different Netbooks
(at least Acer Aspire One, Lenovo S9/10 and MSI Wind) without any
serious tinkering --- just follow the instructions on the web site(s).

One of my colleagues even installed MacOSX on the MSI Wind --- but
that _was_ serious tinkering!

Good question. ;)

Let us see if anyone answers it.

There is automount in Gnome, KDE and other graphical
environments.

There is no concept of autoplay I think.

An app will open the files in the CD for you.

The problem is expecting linux to behave like Windows.

It does not make any sense in many situations.

Not unless you have a proxy running for ping on the machine common to
the two networks.

How is that? Is ICMP a non-IP packet for it to be routed even if
ip_forward is 0?

Let us address this specific question. I read what you are saying as -
A can ping C via B using static routes on A and ip_forward to 0 in B?

A-----------------------------B---------------------C

That is wrong. When a packet arrives to a box, if the destination is
not local, the packet should be forwarded. This forwarding will happen
only if the ip_forward flag is set to 1.

OP has also remained silent so far on whether his question was answered.

Rare for me to reply to my own msg. Missed adding something.

Lets say a system has 2 interfaces in 2 different subnets like what
the OP has - 192 subnet and 172 subnet. The IP address of the these
interfaces is local. Thus, any packet arriving with any of these
addresses as the destination, irrespective of the interface it comes
from is processed in the local path. A packet arriving via the 172
address interface with destination IP being that of the 192 address of
the other interface on  the same system will be processed locally and
does not need forwarding to be on.

For the sake of list members, please do not reply to digests and that
too with such a gawky subject line.

You need to set up the Linux machine as a gateway with NAT for this to
work. Am assuming the Linux machine will be connected to your external
link. You do not need squid unless you want to exercise control. If
you want squid to be used on the same box for web browsing but NAT
other connections, then you'll have to set it up as a transparent
proxy using iptables redirect. Look up howtos in www.tldp.org

That's quite right, as far as I know. However, if I'm not mistaken, the Gnome 
Desktop (or rather the nautilus file manager) will pop up a prompt if it see an 
autorun.[sh|exe] file on the CD.

hmmm ...after a quick glace at gconf settings[1], I see that nautilus has some 
gconf keys named /apps/nautilus/preferences/media_autorun_*. You may want to 
google for those.

double hmmm ...after looking at the nautilus preferences (Open a File Manager 
window -> Edit -> Preferences -> Media), I see an option where one can configure 
'what happens when inserting media or connecting devices to the system' ...which 
also lists 'Software' ...but like all things Gnome, there is no clue what 
'exactly' that would do, instead you are left to make guesses about what that 
means for 'an average desktop user' :)

So, you answer the question -- you cannot be sure the CD you create will 
autoplay in linux. However, _if_ the user uses Gnome, _and_ is using it's 
default file manager (Nautilus) _and_ has not changed the default preferences, 
there will be a prompt shown to the user asking whether the autorun.sh file 
should be run.

HTH,
cheers,

I had just read the article from the link you provided.

The only 2 points he ever mentioned for the change is crap. I mean it (sorry for being un-polite). And I am beginning to suspect if he works for M$. Let me explain.

About the Wifi cards. I had 7.10 installed, then 8.04 and now 9.04. Ubuntu discovers Wifi, then it asks for the key. It even detects the
appropriate encryption method. I haven't even gone any deeper to configure. My system works with WEP and WPA. Just open up the network
manager and reconfigure to ad-hoc. I am not sure why he had to re-compile.

The hardware supports max only 1024x600 (16:9). I am not sure how he mentions that vista configured it to 1024x768. Either he is wrong or
there is some serious bugs under vista. Vista never gave me a scroll able windows. That is true for Ubuntu. However in some cases I noticed
that Ubuntu scrolls the screen automatically to work on the input object that were hidden. But this is not always true.

Regarding the battery time, I agree.

I have to add. I also had XP under the same hardware. XP was slightly better then vista.

I do development using the netbook. I use GCC4.3, PHP5, python 2.5 and 2.6, mysql5, apache2 running and still my netbook boot time under is
linux is 1 min.

My experience:

I did have a dual boot on the very same netbook (now only ubuntu). Windows Vista and Ubuntu. Vista took nearly 15 min to show up the login
screen. Once logged in based on the services you start it is ready for use anywhere from another 15 min to 30 min. It simply can't boot faster. Ubuntu prior to 9.04 took nearly about 3 to 4 mins to show up the login screen and another 2 to 3 min to the desktop.

Ubuntu 9.04 is a breeze with ext4. It takes about 1 min to login screen and another 30 sec to desktop.

Not just this... your MS Office 2007 loads in much shorter time under wine then under vista on the same hardware.

OpenOffice loads in about 20 sec under linux (I am saying this because, OOo used to take a long time to load under linux). Any program in vista take atlease 2 to 5 mins to load.

Windows media player needs many codec to play DVD or Divx or even mp4. You have to go hunting for those free codec on the net. Ubuntu just asks your permission to install the needed codec and downloads and installs. (simple user experience under Ubuntu was great then vista.)

I need to configure the touch screen under linux to use hand writing recognition. Just want to ask you all how many times to you really use
these feature... In my case I can live with it until folks fix for my hardware. I had already passed the necessary info to the developers to
enable calibration for my hardware. 

The build in webcam is screwed up one. I use a external only when I need. (I use webcam very rare.)

Overall I find HCL system a good buy with linux for me.

One thing that motivated me to by this system is that it is a tablet. I can swirl the screen and browse. All the scroll buttons and mouse
emulator are on the screen panel. These work fine under linux. I can use the netbook and sit in the backyard and browse / read ebook while my
little boy is playing.

Could you please mention the precise model and specs? If you can
specify in which Tata Chroma you got it (which city), that would be
nice too! It sounds like a very nice netbook from your description.

Hi all,

I need suggestions and help from you ..
I have four different online bioinformatics web servers....
eg. BLAST, PFAM, COG, PRODOM (Online database servers)

I need to send same query to four servers and fetch the results of four
servers ...

Because i have lot number of queries, i cant do it as single operations as

We can write a php/perl/ruby/python script to get the results from the
db servers.

can you show some more light on what is your real requirements are?

thanks.

Will be great if you provide the detail like the model number and vendor and
city.

To my surprise, vendor  by name digilife in ponniammanmedu and another
vendor in annanagar (picked from the hcl website) are saying  linux models
are exhausted and they are having only windows version.

There is some emi scheme for mileap netbook which it cost Rs13990 as against
the original Rs11990. for citibank and icicibank credit card holders can pay
in 3 emis without(;)?) interest. The emi scheme can be got from rediff
shopping which addtionally tags Rs200/- for shipping inside india.

Sadly, even if you buy any of these XP netbooks and install Linux
yourself , you would have already paid the Microsoft tax.
You are left with no choice but to do it yourself. This site gives
status of various lInux distros in various laptops /netbooks.

http://www.linux-laptop.net/

There are very few choices for models with Linux supported by
manufacturers. Netbooks gave good exposure to Linux  and they have
value and purpose considering the low cost , small size and
portability. But manufacturers prefer XP . In fact Asus ,the first one
to start this  netbook trend buckled to pressure and in fact even
started the  " It is better with windows campaign now"
http://www.itsbetterwithwindows.com/ for eee pcs.

http://ostatic.com/blog/asus-delivers-a-sexy-netbook-but-is-it-ditching-linux

Let us hope things change with ARM , MIPS and Snapdragon based
netbooks which work with  Linux , android  etc.

Cheers

1. Please don't hijack threads. i.e., please "compose" a new mail to
   ILUGC, and don't hit "Reply" to an existing mail and just change the
   subject.

2. Please read this:
   http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

3. You could have searched like this:

Google["photo editing in linux"] == http://www.gimp.org
Google["video editing in linux"] ==

Gimp is the best one for image editing AFAIK.
For video editing try Lives/Cinelerra

            Atlast i made a solution for nautilus like this.I tested
it in ubuntu 8.10 and works fine.

      1.Create two files named as autorun.inf and autostart.sh
      2.The contents should be like this :
         /* autorun.inf */
         [autorun]
         open=sh autostart.sh
         icon=LOGO1.GIF

Check whether there is something in log, /var/log/mysql*.

I am on Ubuntu and could set debug flag, for startup script, with
DEBIAN_SCRIPT_DEBUG. Check you can do something similar to this.

gimp is hard to use but comprehensive. I don't think it is as easy
and powerful as photoshop. (I have never used photoshop)

There is cinepaint.

I have not used cinepaint.

I use tgif for most purposes. There are several technical drawing tools
like Microsoft Visio. I use xfig and one more nice tool I forget.

You can also use vector drawing tools like inkscape.

For video editing I use mencoder or ffmpeg.

There are other apps like cinelerra, lives and devede too.

In general Linux world forces you to learn and things are slightly
harder.

We carried out tests on a miniature database of about a million records.
The False match was in the order of 2-3 in a million.
The False non match was in the order of 5 per thousand.
The speed depends on the system config.
A normal laptop can do around 10,000 matchings per second.
The template record is around 800 bytes in size and can be easily
transmitted in low bandwidths

The false non match is high and is a real limitation.
In spite of this limitation it has a lot of applications.
particularly in web banking/ rural atms / door locks /
laptop login / mobile banking / elections / ration cards / National ID card/
Visa etc.

For example, take that 5 out of every 1000 rightful person is denied a vote
and 3 in a million are able to cast bogus votes.
Compare this with what is really happening in the elections currently...
And unless the image in the database is of bad quality, a false non match
only requires a retry
.

where and how were you able to get such a 'large' sample database ? or 
was this generated rather than real ?

Cinepaint is a successor of GIMP :) . Its former name was "Film GIMP" . We
can do many operations with this like in other tools. Every tool has its own
feature.

b. Minimum order : 30
c. Cost includes log
d. Cotton material 
e. Can be made in different size.

Can we gohead and place orders? If yes
1. Someone please design a simple logo  for printing/embroidery
2. Please confirm your order.

The manufacturer needs minimun 10 days time,so please respond quickly.

It involves some work but you can get it working.

Subject: [Ilugc] Changing default CFLAGS flags for gcc
Message-ID: <702446.89766.qm@web94704.mail.in2.yahoo.com>


hi ,

I have lot of makefiles  , by default gcc geneartes 64 bit executable on 64 machine  but i need to change to 32 bit , dont want to change the makefiles .

Instead is there anyway i can change default flags at command line for gcc

Can i set environment variable 
export CFLAGS=-m32 CXX=-m32  so that by gcc takes CFLAGS or CXX to generate 32bit code instead of 64 bit code by default .

So in simple i want to chnage the gcc default flag settings
  
Like $CFLAGS=-m32 gcc hello.c should generate me 32 bit code on a 64 bit machine instead of 64 bit .

Note : As by default all my makefiles can take the default CFLAGS which is set as environment variable .


Thanks and regards
Narendra

We faced this issue for long time..  atlast found out that this occurs when
the number of connections configured in Apache is more than the number of
mysql connections..

So, check the apache configuration, and also Mysql configuration, and make
sure, that the number of mysql connections is more than the number of
max_connection in apache.

This should definitely solve the problem..

Well, why don't you try it?

Consider this Makefile:

all:
	echo CFLAGS are $(CFLAGS)

Now, this is the result of running it:

[$ /tmp] make
echo CFLAGS are
CFLAGS are

[$ /tmp] CFLAGS=-m32 make
echo CFLAGS are -m32
CFLAGS are -m32

HTH.

Ok.

I think there is.

I dunno which one gets preference. You have to check and read
the documentation on GNU Make.

If the Makefile CFLAGS takes preference then you will have no
choice but to modify it in all Makefiles.

I will give you a command by which you can do it in one stroke.

Typically CFLAGS will already be used in Makefiles. So you want
to add to it. I am assuming here that you are not having any flag
that will reset this -m32 or whatever flag you want to set.

Then this command will change all files at one go.

$ vim -p foo/Makefile ba/Makefile foo/bar/Makefile

Inside vim enter this command:

:tabdo :%s/CFLAGS=/CFLAGS+=-m32/g

If this command goes through then you can save all files and
exit at one stroke with

:tabdo wq

Please remember that you may not get the same results I expect.

You should follow along these lines.

If you don't like tabbed vim, you could go for :bufdo if you use vi
or vim without -p flag. That should give the same results too.

I dunno this. I have never used a 64 bit machine.

I guess so.

Sorry I dunno the answer but I want to know the answer. :)

I know there is xbindkeys in X but if you mean console, then it
might involve something else.

I am curious. Nice question.

Thanks Bharathi. I read the manpages and had to spend time
searching the Internet till I got halfway. I could get F5 to
print a string.

But I wanted enter also to be pressed. Then I saw this page.

http://www.hermann-uwe.de/tips-and-tricks/showkey-loadkeys-tricks

It is not so obvious what to do. This page also helped me.

http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO-15.html

This is what I did.

You cannot set a new keymap unless you are root. It is obvious
but not mentioned anywhere.

So this is what I did.

Login as root.

# dumpkeys > keys.map

# vim keys.map

In this case you want to search for a line like this,

string F1 = "\033[[A"

It occurs in line number 662 in my case. I am sure it is going to
be the same in yours too.

Set it to

string F1 = "\033[[ls -l\n"

Then load the new keymap.

# loadkeys keys.map

Then go to a different virtual console , login as yourself and
press 'F1'.

Voila. It now works!

But you have to be logged in of course. ;)

Obviously this done not work in xterms. I never got that to work.

That is a separate project involving a different set of programs I think.

This looks wrong. I think it should be
 string F1 = "ls -l\n"
The additional Esc+[+[ seems to be unneccesary.

The above key sequence settings may cause additional problems with X.
For example, did you use "xev" to check whether pressing "F1" still
gives the "F1" XKSymbol after this wierd definition?

Overall, I have found that messing around with loadkeys is only
useful if you _only_ use the Linux console. Even in that case it is
better to define key sequences in specific applications rather than
replacing the characters that the console stuffs into the buffer.

Most terminal applications (vi,emacs,mc,git,screen ...) and a few
graphical ones (like Emacs-with-X, gvim) allow you to assign commands
or character strings to key sequences.

The later in the food chain that you assign a key sequence, the more
likely it is that the meaning (semantics) can be application specific.

It is true that it would be nice if there was a general way to say
something like the following for all applications at once:
 F1 should be help
 F2 should be prompt for command/function
 F3 should be prompt for external file/URL 
and so on. Moreover, this should be user configurable in one place
for all applications.

Clearly this needs some kind of hotkey callback library that all
applications should link to. Perhaps the Desktop Environments do this
but I wouldn't know since I don't really use them.

Kapil.

Yes. I later tested it. I also wanted to say that many of my
steps were unnecessary. I was just playing it safe, that is all.

# echo 'string F1 = "ls -l\n" ' | loadkeys

would work too.

And so will

# loadkeys
string F1 = "ls -l\n"
 <Ctrl-D>

You don't have to dumpkeys and copy it back. Once again I
was playing it safe.

We can set the same sequence with xbindkeys also.

http://www.linux.com/archive/articles/59494

And we don't have to use F1. We can use some unused key. There
are many useless keys in the keyboard. More if you have a
multimedia keyboard.

We can set it to good purpose this way.

Another advantage is that of practical use in this thing.

Hotkeys help you to simply switch the CPU on. Don't care if
you are in X or any terminal even. No need to switch on the
monitor. Just press a hotkey and get your job done.

Usually this makes sense when you want to play a song.

I have been wanting this for a long time but never got there.

Sorry but I beg to differ.

I even think that you could be wrong here. We are only replacing
the string buffer , and in this case for F1 it was a totally
useless representation. We are not really diddling with the
keycodes or anything like that.

Having the same key bindings at both X and console is what I
want.

Now my problem is that there would be no loadkeys under
OpenBSD and I will be back to square one. But that is my
problem.

Not useful I think. As I said, the use case is different.

I don't even want to switch on the monitor.

I would not get pedagogical on this.

I for one wanted this hotkey business for a long time.

The problem is that you may accidentally hit "F1" while in application
"foo" for which "ls -l\n" is a command that deletes all your files! :-(

(If you have read the book "Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy" then
there is some point where it warns that "Careless words can cost
lives"; this is a similar situation).

One way to make it work for bash regardless of which terminal you open
(console, xterm, gnome-terminal, etc.) is long as it generates the
same sequence "ESC+[OP" for F1 is to configure this in ~\.inputrc as
follows:

 $if bash
 "\e[OP": "ls -l\n"
 $endif

This definition will not mess with _any_ other application.

This is one use case for which there is no alternative to loadkeys.

However, you should be aware of Consequences (note the big C). For
example, the Alt+sysrq+r combination is directly grabbed by the kernel
and you can _never_ use it in another application as long as the sysrq
feature is enabled (via proc) --- and it "does" have disastrous
consequences if you happen to be using X or vi at that time.

Kapil.

Hi,

If you have happened to update your kernel recently using apt-get (since
sometimes this also updates the firmware) or something like that and also if
your system has a dedicated graphics card, try recompiling the graphics card
module with the new kernel headers.

i have written this some 3 yrs back.
http://www.balachandar.net/blog125-2006-04-22.html

at present, u can do anything with both the tools

but though there are some differences

1. wordpress can install / upgrade the module / plug-in automatically which
drupal cannot.
2. 80% of content in wordpress is already in compliance with SEO. i.e
permalinks, custom URL etc. drupal needs pathauto to achieve this.
3. drupal's block is kind of wordpress's widget. placement depends on the
theme file.
4. wordpress can be upgraded automatically whereas drupal cannot.
5. wordpress is a blog publishing platform where drupal is a content
management system which can be used for building sites like
http://demo.ilugc.in
6. both the tools are effective with contributed modules.
7. both have developer documentation. but i felt that wordpress development
is easier than drupal
8. powerful modules like views, panel, cck are there for drupal which makes
it efficient. but wordpress doesnt have that.
9. code management with drupal is easy compared to wordpress. because all 3p
/ custom modules / themes are in different location. you will not touch the
core files. drupal provides bug fix release every month i guess.

may be some one can add more... or correct me if i am wrong.

for websites like Pass223.com, i wouldnt use drupal or any CMS. it has a
different requirement. basically whether you use CMS or build the site from
scratch depends on the requirement.

for community kind of sites, developing everything from scratch is like
reinventing the wheel. when there are already tools available for building
community sites like http://demo.ilugc.in, u need not do coding with hand.

currently, demo.ilugc.in supports what our ilugc needs and it basically uses
open source cms which is growing like anything and its not simple site.

for e.g http://www.ilugc.org/ is coded with hand. it has also given the
locations of the code. but you could see the
*Time :* Sat Aug 8th 15:00 IST 2009 (**3PM**)
which is not yet updated by the community. this is the problem with static
sites which i feel.

but with http://demo.ilugc.in, you will see the content being updated by its
users. i updated content related to SFD 2009. some one have added event.
users can do job posting, report bugs etc.

FYI Virtualization theme is going to be demoed by AVIT.

We are planning to do basic demonstration on the following things
* Running a live cd/iso
* Installing & using various distros from cd/dvd/iso

So far we are planning to demonstrate Qemu, Virtualbox. 

Please give your suggestions.

I don't think that will be possible. rsync requires rsync command to be execute on either side, compare and transmit the changes. As far as I know ftp doesn't allow such flexibility which ssh has.

Dear luggies,

I am dropping the idea of preparing Kurta as there is no response.
Enquired about T-Shirts - Cost Rs.90-100 for round neck, 125-135 for collared one. Minimum order 30.

Should I proceed with T-Shirt preparation?

What about colour? full or half hand?

If it is possible, I want one Medium size t-shirt without collar and half hand if it available.

Hi All,

SFD is NOT a tech fest. SFD is a public demo day. Plz understand this.

0. Most of the attendees will be new to Linux or computer(!?)

1. Most of the time, you have to answer very basic Qs like, How to
browse, email, chat, play AV, run Office, image manipulation, play
games, programming etc. So focus on BASIC stuffs.

2. You are a **regular** Linux user, familiar with most of the basic
operations and willing to share your knowledge then take your
machine and come to SFD on Sept 19th.

3. If you can inform in advance about your plans, it is easy for us
to arrange the place, power, etc.

Bye :)

Unfortunately this is not a simple question to answer.

I have had to reinstall several times to get things right.

Traditionally I install Windows in the first partition of the disk to
avoid issues.

Best of luck!

That is all I can do now. Perhaps others have better ideas than me?

That's not really fair, my friend. Even so-called dynamic sites will 
show old dates if nobody bothers to update the details. Which is what 
happened in this case. Let's not confuse the method of updating with the 
act of updating.

We all can code with hand. What extra time we spend by 'coding by hand', 
it will be off-set by less-complicated administration overhead.

There is a perfectly good way to update stuff (like committing to and 
deploying a public repo) on the alternatives too, both ilugc.org and 
ilugc.org.in - perhaps it's not 'real-time' like a CMS. But then, that 
real-time aspect also encourages spam. So I guess people can make up 
their own minds.

Hi..
     When ur grub shows the OS,U point to the windows vista and press
'e' to edit the grub command line.Next u want to edit the root(hd0,4).
      For that point to root(,) and again press e to edit.then change
the x in the root(hd0,x) to some values 2,3,5,6 or else.then give
"enter" and 'b' to boot.i think ur installation drive may be wrongly
taken!
Try this..if it is wrong correct me!

As the OP has already said, this is mostly related with /etc/hosts.
/etc/hosts should have the following entry:

hi,
instead of editing the grub menu everytime during boot, it would be better
if you could permanently apply the change in /boot/grub/menu.lst.

First, understand the basics.

root(hd0,0) points to the first partition in your first hard disk
root(hd0,1) points to the second partition in your first hard disk

so if windows vista is present in the 4th parition(just assuming) ...
in /boot/grub/menu.lst

add the following after the ubuntu menu items :
            title        Windows Vista
            rootnoverify    (hd0,3)
            savedefault
            makeactive
            chainloader    +1

if any problem occurs or if i am wrong, please do enlighten me :)

The only thing I did different was

I did not mount /stuff on a different partition. Its on the same mount as "/'

 

When I start the installation. I get this error and the installation halts.

Hi Sankar,

Others have already suggested the correct way to do this (Hrishikesh's 
suggestion being the most clear, imho). However, looking at the config file you 
pasted, I wonder if the problem was simply a typo:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Is this really uncommented in your config too ? The correct 
entry seems to be below ....

...however, since the empty root line comes first, that's the one that is 
possibly being picked. You can easily tell whether this is the case by looking 
at the label shown in the grub menu at boot.

HTH,

Dear LUGs,
                   recently TNEB supplied CUG simcards to all
Engineers. I have an mobile phone list which contain 200 numbers. I
tried to make the entry in my simcard using wammu through Motorola
SLVR L9 ( OS is ubuntu 8.10). After single number entry, It shows
squire boxes in name & numbers in mobile. and also wammu shows
Japanese ( or china) language or symbols in name column when
retrieval.
                  I tired it the same in kmobiletools ( Mandriva
2009), but I couldn't make an entry phone.
                 I need the solution to solve it.

                   Any other way to feed numbers to my mobile? I hvae
n list in the form of openoffice spread sheet. any script to do it ?

hi,
i think kmobiletools should do it ... because i could do it in kmobiletools
(if configured properly) ... are you sure you configured kmobiletools
properly? could you be a little more verbose about what you exactly did?
for your info, kmobiletools uses kaddressbook.

Hi,

>>
but with http://demo.ilugc.in, you will see the content being updated by its
users. i updated content related to SFD 2009. some one have added event.
users can do job posting, report bugs etc.

>>There is a perfectly good way to update stuff (like committing to and
deploying a public repo) on the alternatives too, both ilugc.org and
ilugc.org.in - perhaps it's not 'real-time' like a CMS. But then, that
real-time aspect also encourages spam. So I guess people can make up their
own minds.


First of all congrats Bala for the work what you rendered. I who added the
event. It is cool , simple in terms of user experience.

again, well done bala.

Message-ID: <COL103-W343353DC7332628C7E7C11CAEE0@phx.gbl>



I have a Compaq Presario V3149AU
http://in.tolmol.com/Compaq%20Presario%20Laptop%20V3149AU/prices/1424070

HardDrive-120GB

RAM-1GB

Processor-AMD Turion 64 X2 Processor

Battery-Lilon

CD/DVD-8x Super Multi Drive Double Layer(8.5 GB) DVD Writer

Display-14.1"WXGA TFT With Bright View Screen TechnologyI am trying to install Fedora 11 on my laptop.
 
My CD-ROM is defective
So I follwed this instruction
http://gofedora.com/how-to-install-fedora-without-cd-dvd/
The only thing I did different was
I did not mount /stuff on a different partition. Its on the same mount as "/'
 
I have 4 Partitions. I already have Fedora 9 installed on /dev/sda1.
Inside this partition in /stuff I have copied the files from Fedora 11 CD.
 

Now in the grub when I choose fedora 11 installation. The installation halts at a particular step.

Please find the preceding  messages and the message at which it halts.

 

sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI disk

sd 2:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg1 type 0

ata4: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 300)

atkbd.c Unknown key pressed ( translated set 2, code 0x29 on isa 0060/serio0)

atkbd.c Use 'setkekycodes e059 <keycode>' to make it known.

atkbd.c Unknown kkeky released( translated set 2, code 0x29 on isa 0060/serio0)

atkbd.c Use 'setkekycodes e059 <keycode>' to make it known.

 

I tried to look it up on the internet. Most of the forums say that the issue happens in presence of wireless keyboard or mouse.

I don't have a wireless mouse or keyboard. And none of them are in reference to installing. The solution provided is to make changes to init files. But I don't know how I can edit init files even before i have installed the system.

 

Hope I have clearly put out the problem this time :)

 

Anywork around for this ?

Can you tell which files I need to edit ?

And what changes needs to be done ?

 

Regards

Amit

The messages about the keycodes do not seem to be the likely cause
of the problem. On the other hand the message about the SATA link
down seems more serious.

Depending on the distro you use , install SCIM and try. It has not
only Tamil but many Indian languages support.
And you can switch between languages on the fly also.

Hi Everyone

i am thinking of having some talks on Fedora on SFD day. Since i believe
there are some virtualization stuff already there @ SFD i guess we could
give a demo of Fedora 11. If people wanna be part of it let me know we could
divide some topics and share it.
I also have some Fedora Media with me and we could use this at the SFD
distributing it to people.

Let me know your suggestions


Thanks,

effects,both ll be with demonstartion

These two are confirmed by KEC pupils,preparation is going on

	Moreover we are planning to take one more regarding the Instant  
messangers(pidgin,kopete,etc)which dependes upon the number of guys look  
for SFD


All the best to luggies

Hai Friends,

I designed T-Shirt Design for SFD.

This is back side of t-shirt design only.  ( used by Inkscape )

Link :  http://tuxworld.wordpress.com/2009/09/04/sfd-t-shirt-back-side-design-models/

And i used green color as t-shirt color, as some one told in previous
thread.

Tell all of your suggestions , and ur ideas.


share ur ides  to make front - side design of t-shirt.  ( front side should
have some LOGO s or Simple images )


This design not only for SFD.

All Open Source People can wear this model t-shirt on any day.

Thanks for the work. But I feel it is best to keep things simple. KISS
always goes for the win.

We can have the logo of SFD in the front, with the tee shirt colour as
the colour of the right column of the SFD website

http://softwarefreedomday.org/

[SFD Logo]
http://softwarefreedomday.org/Artwork/2009/Logo?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=SFD09logo_mclimeorangeblend_sun_bvlshdw.png

The backside can have ILUGC logo. Just my 2 paisa.

Subject: [Ilugc] xbindkeys for X hotkey bindings
Message-ID: <7938ae610909042147x113ad0dbv44b31b5937e81893@mail.gmail.com>

xbindkeys is very easy to use when you wish to bind hotkey presses on
X sessions. Either when you are on a xterm or otherwise.

You have be within the Xwindow session, that is all. Typical Xwindow
sessions span multiple virtual displays or workspaces and typically on
linux you have Xwindow running on virtual terminal Alt + Ctrl + F7.
Anyway I think you know what I mean.

Graphical displays that run something like KDE or Gnome.

There are several key differences between hotkeys in X and text
consoles which we saw with loadkeys(1).

    o Xwindow allows keybindings with mouse buttons (3 buttons are possible)

    o Xwindow keybindings follow a hierarchical model of bindings. For
instance, Firefox will not get a keybinding directly. It has to be
passed by the window manager. That is why I find that sometimes
firefox bindings get intercepted by the windowmanager. You have a
daisy chain of hotkey handlers in the X environment. But this not a
problem with xbindkeys.

    o Xwindow permissions and bindings are user specific. You don't
have to be root to set a keymap like loadkeys

    o You have to install xbindkeys

Okay enough  theory and background.

I created a default keybindings file with

$ xbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc

The syntax is braindead simple.

"pidgin"
  Control + b2 + Release

if you want to invoke pidgin when you press Ctrl key on the keyboard
with the second mouse button.

But things get complicated. You have to know keycodes. You can easily
find that by running

$ xbindkeys -k

It throws up a small white screen a la xev and you will know which
keycode corresponds to which key.

After that just start the xbindkeys daemon with

$ xbindkeys

Every time you change a binding you have to restart this daemon or
send the HUP signal.

$ pkill -HUP xbindkeys

I find that you can create a long command as a shell script
and then bind it. That is more useful to me from a practical
point of view.

For instance,

I create a /bin/playaudio file like this.

   #!/bin/sh
   mplayer /home/music/file1.mp3

 And then chmod it.

# chmod +x /bin/playaudio

Then configure xkeybindings file like this.

"playaudio"
 Mod_M + b1

This will play a song when I press the useless Windows key along with
mouse button 1.

Please refer to the command I gave above to figure out keycodes and
keynames. It is very useful.

Hope this is useful.

I tried this morning and everything worked like a charm. As I expected
this was a very easy affair.

Best,
Girish

  Attend
our Free Webinar ? *Geoprocessing: From the Desktop to the Top of the Cloud*


*When?* Tuesday, September 9, 2009 at 11 a.m. (EDT). Spaces are
limited, so register
now<http://app.bronto.com/public/?q=ulink&fn=Link&ssid=85&id=co09oxhl6bh3hb4fqgw4a60ot24hs&id2=7a4nhvd82hynpcl9n62hfyx6g8h04>
.

Do you need to publish your spatial models to other users over the internet?
During this webinar, Ian Anderson, Director of Remote Sensing at ERDAS, will
seamlessly work through a local government?s dataset, showcasing the entire
geoprocessing workflow.  This webinar will illustrate how to
*author*spatial data models in ERDAS IMAGINE,
*catalog* and *serve* these models as OGC WPS in ERDAS APOLLO and *consume*and
*use* the WPS in the ERDAS TITAN client and other web applications.

ERDAS provides the most interoperable geoprocessing services in the
industry. Users can run an entire model (such as change detection),
completely contained within a single WPS process. The complexity of the
algorithm stored under a single process is unique, enabling an end-user to
create on demand line of sight, elevation change, image change detection and
more.

During this webinar, you will have direct interaction with the presenter to
ask questions. For more information about our upcoming webinars, please
visit: www.erdas.com<http://app.bronto.com/public/?q=ulink&fn=Link&ssid=85&id=co09oxhl6bh3hb4fqgw4a60ot24hs&id2=8bhe34zwavoicwovklkon3g922v02>

LUGs,
                My suggestion is embroidery of logos/ slogans instead of
paint printing. This gives better look and long life. but it costs little
bit more.

   Executing Hello world programs is enough to give a start up.But
Clearly state the following things,
     1.What is that?
     2.Why we need that?
     3.How it came to existance?
     4.How to competes with its competitors ?
     5.Basics ( syntax etc.)
     6.What are all the tools available.
     7.real time scenarios and your simple codes.
     8.Make a good deal of resource materials,website links,ebooks to
give to the viewers if they are interested.

        I invite all the luggies to add more details to this and if
possible please put it to the website.It ll be useful to the students
who want to make demo stalls.

Hi,

Windows will wipe out all the MBR data.
So your grub is vanished.
You have to restore the grub.

Follow the link to restore it.

My problem is, in one project, when i went for the command:

python manage.py syncdb to sync my database, i get the error:
*
self.connection = Database.connect(**conn_params)
psycopg2.OperationalError: FATAL

*Can anyone please suggest me anything regarding this?

Hi,

Check your database parameters like hostname, username and password
configured in your code.
check that using those parameters, you can login into database in a
separate terminal.

A lot of man hours has been put in some popular open source CMS like joomla,
drupal, wordpress etc, and also these CMS has been developed over a period
of time, eg, 2 or 3 or 4 years.
So, considering the amount of time required for those projects to mature to
this level, its obvious, that we dont have that much resource of manpower to
develop a project of that kind.

We should try to utilise existing CMS as much possible, unless we are aiming
for some different product.

I feel,  drupal has a relatively flexible architecture than wordpress.
Drupal has an extensive and dynamic templating system, than wordpress.

The plugin system of wordpress is different from the module feature of
drupal.  There each module has its own URL structure, whereas, in wordpress,
the plugin is always automatically included.

Performance wise, wordpress serves better.

I feel, keeping this subject in 5th semester is a perfect one, because, the
student will be empowered with a full-cycle programming environment, so that
they can actually do some project in the final year.

>From my analysis, most of the students could not do their final year
project, because, they dont have the technical knowhow, or familiarity with
the development environment.

Its like  studying about "BIke mechanics" all the four years, and suddenly
asked to repair a bike or rida  bike.

However, i feel, including LAMP as a subject may give only basic
introduction.  I havent yet seen the book yet.

Unless we create a strong open source movement, that spearheads some really
serious open source products, student may not actually learn much.

We need the passion of people like "Shivaji" in our group, who had the
interest and vision to make in to GSoC.

Why dont we institutionalise such open source product development.

Still i could find that most of our developers, are familiar only with
coding, but NOT with architecture and design of the application.  When i
first started working in wordpress, the first thing, i tried to understand
was the architecture of the application, that helped me a lot later.

Just my few thoughts.

Almost all software are licensed, even Free (as in Freedom) Software
are licensed and we may need to pay to buy them. So can you make your
question clearer?

By looking at 'Yuguu' website I found out that it was a software with
various payment options and a free (as in free beer) version too. I'm
not sure if it is licensed under any Free (as in freedom) software
licenses.

Thank you.

I had that problem in fedora 11, update your fedora 11 installation (yum -y

I am sure lug is filled with people many times better than me at Python.

Please send the script as attachment or paste it in the mail.

I will look at it.

Does this work? Transparent proxy is very hard to setup.

Did you first test whether the DNAT is working properly?

You can check that with netcat and by connecting from outside your network
to a computer behind your Squid box.

Unless the returning packets also go through squid DNAT will not work.

I can't help on anything else. If DNAT works then my advice will not be useful.

Am assuming you have also configured a SNAT. If squid works but ping
fails, check if the linux machine is dropping echo requests in
IPTables. How do you know squid works? Do logs show HTTP requests
going thro' squid and not via SNAT?

>> 3. My outlook mails are not able to delivered to outerworld ?via linux
>> server ?not able to know the dns ip to name or name to ip.

If DNS is failing, then browsing will not work too and will return an
unknown host error. I find it odd that browsing works but POP/SMTP DNS
resolution fails. Have you tried using IP in the mail config to arrive
at this conclusion?

Girish - why is it hard to set up? There are very many lucid howtos.
This has worked well for quite some time and does not have any
gotchas.

Check squid logs and this will be evident.

If the outgoing request goes from squid, the returning packet will
also go thro' squid as the TCP connection to/from outside terminates
on the squid machine. I've found redirect DNAT works as intended in
transforming connections. To check this, set up IPTables log using the
-j LOG target for sport being port 80 to internal LAN IPs on the squid
machines.

I tried it on the other day and it threw some error, I thought it was
intermittent and wanted to try later. Few minutes back I tried and got
the same error,

<snip>

Error

Something crashed - please report this error at
http://bitbucket.org/lawgon/ilugc/

</snip>

This happens when I click "Edit planet" link after logging in. this
happens before I put any details in "Join planet". A more meaningful
error message will be good.

FYI, I ve joined planet and this error is not visible anymore.

Good question !

http://www.fosslc.org/drupal/about

Improve lives with open source.
Our Mission

    * Outreach to educate about benefits derived from open source.
    * Promote open standards.
    * Promote interoperability.
    * Provide a safe place for newcomers to learn.
    * Help people find gainful employment.
    * Support open source communities, projects, foundations, and start ups.
    * Help educators be more effective.
    * Help companies, communities, academics interested in open source
to connect.

I think all LUGS have similar mission !
And CMS like Drupal  meets this purpose.

Cheers

If you want to access db, mysql, check phpmyadmin. It also has export

Turning off the firewall is not the solution. Configure the firewall
to allow outgoing HTTP/HTTPS connections. So also SMTP/POP3.

Squid is not a SMTP/POP proxy and so you will not see that.
Furthermore, you are only doing a redirect for HTTP to squid. How
would SMTP or POP go thro' a proxy (if installed) for those protocols?

You'll need to go thro' this resolution in a systematic manner. Stop,
resolve a step and then proceed.

1. Check if server's internet connection is working properly. Can be
verified by pinging an external IP.
2. Check if name resolution works properly on the server. Can be
verified by pinging a name like yahoo.com.
3. Check if firewall allows HTTP(s)/POP(s)/SMTP(s)/RDP by trying the
browser, RDP client and mail client like Thunderbird on the server.

This clears the server side. Next, lets come to the client.

1. Ping the server IP and check it is reachable. Am assuming that
machine is also configured as your gateway.
2. Try nslookup to see if names get resolved. If not, check your DNS
client config. If you are using the server as your client's DNS
server, check the DNS server configuration on this step's failure.
3. Try pinging yahoo.com. If it does not work, check SNAT
configuration on server.
4. Am assuming your transparent proxy works well as you've stated that
browsing works.
5. Now check the mail client on the LAN client. Configure the external
mail server names for SMTP and POP. make sure you have the relevant
auth settings turned on.

Hi,

I am using Fedora 11.? kcron documentation says, it is a part of
kdeadmin package.  After doing "yum install kdeadmin", the
installation went successfully.? But I don't see "kcron" installed.
If I run "kcron" on the command prompt as root, it says "command not

Nice question.

If you have not switched off the machine after installation
then uptime will get you the info in a roundabout way.

You could take a look at several several file which are
never ever touched after install. One possibility is the
timezone file or any of the executables under any of the
standard UNIX paths /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, /sbin and so
on.

There may be many other ways too I am sure.

This question reminds me of the way Neils Bohr replied
when he was asked a simple question.

His answer is breathtakingly beautiful.

Turning off the firewall is not the solution. Configure the firewall
to allow outgoing HTTP/HTTPS connections. So also SMTP/POP3.

Squid is not a SMTP/POP proxy and so you will not see that.
Furthermore, you are only doing a redirect for HTTP to squid. How
would SMTP or POP go thro' a proxy (if installed) for those protocols?

This clears the server side. Next, lets come to the client.

Hi all,

can i import a "Adobe Flash SWF file" thro PHP and read the contents of that SWF file ?

as far i have seen PHP only supports creation of SWF files on-the-fly (ie dynamicaly)

if anyone finds this , pls reply me back.

Hi,

What you are going to do by importing a SWF file in php?

As it is a binary file, you cant extract any content from it.

If you want to display swf files in browser, use embed command in html.

If your remote desktop port is open and properly forwarded then you
can connect from anywhere. For LAN there is no problem you can easily
use rdesktop.

Message-ID: <83e5051f0909080650k7dc96aa3icccfdb0e3f152913@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I installed sdcc on ubuntu JJ with:
$ sudo apt-get install sdcc

The installation was successful but the 8051 sample codes didn't compile.
Later I learnt that the include folder was not having all headers [in this
case 8051.h] and many sub folders [mcs51, z80, picXX] were empty. But "man
sdcc" worked fine.

I uninstalled sdcc and downloaded this package:

http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/snapshots/i386-unknown-linux2.5/sdcc-snapshot-i386-unknown-linux2.5-20090817-5492.tar.bz2

 from http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/snap.php#Linux

and followed the installation steps given in the tar file.

This time it worked! The code compiled and all headers are available now.
This  is a snapshot of find:
$ find /usr/ -name "8051.h"
/usr/local/share/sdcc/include/mcs51/8051.h

I want to know what went wrong with "apt-get install". Did anyone come
across this before?

regards,
Sarma

Based on the descriptions on packages.ubuntu.com, you probably require 
sdcc-nf [non-free] from the multiverse repository.

Because he may not know about Ubuntu and Linux kernel; :) But almost
everyone in U.S knows about an iphone.

I assume the windows server is your proxy server. If that's the case, go to

He wants young people to create something of great value. You are bothered
he is not talking about the license they should use if they create something
of value! A case of putting the cart before the horse :-)

"Tyrants" - Google gives me the following synonym (a cruel and
oppressive dictator )

and thats something I am sure Obama wouldn't have mentioned or even
thought of. An example of how media "blows" up things.

Apple created iPod and it was freaking successful to the extent that
my mom (50 years old) calls every damn mp3 player an iPod. I would not
be surprised if in a year or so people start asking "Can I have your
iPhone number please". And he picked up a very appropriate consumer
product to inspire kids.

Imagine he speaking on them creating the next "linux" kernel. Do you
really think the majority of kids will get inspired and their
creativity circuits in their brain triggered by that?

Think! and calling individuals tyrants is uncalled for on a public
mailing list :)

Thanks for your understanding.

With Best Regards,
Aanjhan

           See the documentary film "Pirates of silicon valley".Then you can say
weather steve is a tyrant or not.I dont know how he is now.At least he was a
tyrant once.

Message-ID: <f3d38c890909081137u7d129c44g8c352935da2370c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Luggies !

What would be the recommended distro  for a touchscreen tablet netbook ?

It is not just a question of replacing mouse by touchscreen but an OS
designed for touchscreen operation like MID ( Mobile Internet Device )
I find options like Moblin but seem to work only with Intel processors .
Is there a suitable OS for  MID platform like maemo  ( http://maemo.org/ )
It is not clear if Ubuntu MID version runs on all CPU ( non-intel like
AMD and VIA)

Cheers

You can try modifying local_settings.py and try. But there is no
guarantee it will work.

The stack trace does not suggest anything else and there are no sources to see.

Who installed the server? Ask him.

It is not very sensible to use Windoze for server purposes but.

The IISc simputer project by Picopeta and later Geodesic uses linux for their
touchscreen interface but I have no experience or idea on what you are
talking.

You can ask my friend ksvivek@gmail.com and mention my name.

He will surely help. Best of luck!

I dunno what discussion this was about.

I have had great success with using VNC for accessing Windoze and
linux boxes remotely.

When my US visa application got turned down by our merciful,
charitable and most
wonderful US consulate in Chennai in all fairness ;), my customer in
Califorinia setup
VNC and I executed my project sitting in slum Tambaram. ;)

How is this eh?

Talk of a puny computer in the most backward area in Chennai talking
to the goldmine
of America, the richest nation using VNC?

It was most useful for the project and I had some difficulty in the
beginning getting used to
the latency under linux but on Windoze there was no problem at all.

Little bit not much.

You don't need much bandwidth. I have heard good things about rdesktop too.

 I assume the windows server is your proxy server. If that's the case, go to
 Firefox Edit > Preferences > Advanced > Network > Settings and select
 'Manual Proxy configuration' and enter your server ip and the port on which
 its listening for proxy connections.

 regds,
 mano

   Thanks, but in windows xp, no proxy server settings. i.e 'auto detect
   proxy settings'
   in 'internet options DNS server settings are manual.i.e two dns servers
   one primary server and second is alternate.

tee shirt sizes could be small,medium L XL XXL. Also phone number should not 
be mandatory - btw due to the ajax in the captcha I found it very difficult to 
register - the text input box in the captcha is not showing properly.

Unfortunately, you are right. They would also not recognise many
important scientists. Most school kids probably think of Bill Gates as
a computer scientist and would say "Alan Turing? Who?"

There is indeed a fine line between a leader leading so that his
followers can follow and a so-called "leader" who just says what he
thinks his "people" want to hear. In this case, Obama is trying to
underline the importance of innovation (scientists/engineers) as a
career over the usual management/sales jobs. To my mind that is
a good thing. The choice of example (iPhone/Steve Jobs) is not as
relevant as long as it conveys the message.

As long as his government is aware of this distinction and does not
support the proprietary software industry in its anti-innovative
practices, we should not complain too much.

Regards,

Kapil.

Couple of checks that you can do :

syncdb?
# Check your db logs.
# try restarting postgres (guess this is the silver bullet!)

django is not cms. its a web application framework as far as i know (correct
me if i am wrong). plone is a cms based on python. joomla, mambo, drupal is
a cms based on php.

Dear Mohan,

It's not interest but concern. FYI : My interest in OpenCv was kindled
3 years ago. Computer Vision is a very vast area with required
academic knowledge about Machine Vision,Image processing etc. I know
two startup machine vision companies in Chennai who could not still
market their biometric products. Also came across a matrimonial site
that makes a fool of itself by boasting that it "makes matches using
face". Very funny!!!

 Just concerned that you motivation of creating awareness might have a
negative effect on the audience, building high hopes in them about
building marketable products using OpenCV.

Message-ID: <dc538c3f0909082343j6a99ade6o4fb2f66bd7b93ec0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to demo Money Manager Ex for the public as it is a easy-to-use
personal finance software

Overview:
-------------
Money Manager Ex is a free, open-source, cross-platform, easy-to-use
personal finance software. It primarily helps organize one's finances and
keeps track of where, when and how the money goes. It is also a great tool
to get a bird's eye view of your financial worth.

Money Manager includes all the basic features that 90% of users would want
to see in a personal finance application. The design goals are to
concentrate on simplicity and user-friendliness - something one can use
everyday.

Money Manager Ex runs on Windows and Linux and an experimental build is now
available for Mac OS X.

For more information:

I understand that the shift to plone (from mambo) was because of the better
(portal)user - friendly features.

without making it a php-based vs python-based argument, can some of us do a
comparative study of a few select CMS (say Drupal, Jhoomla, Plone) :
highlight their specialities, give some guidelines as to which groups could
effectively use which system, etc. It might also give a chance for
developers to add the missing features (provided they gel with the overall
architecture).

Most of the USB bootable distros simply change their liveCD
configuration to liveUSB configuration. For liveCD, 'isolinux' is the
bootloader and for liveUSB, 'syslinux' is the bootloader. Both are
created by 'Peter Anvin' for Syslinux project.

http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/The_Syslinux_Project

A loosly configured liveCD image can be converted into liveUSB by simply
copying 'isolinux.cfg' to 'syslinux.cfg' with slight changes. Puppylinux
is using this technique to install liveUSB into your pendrive from a
liveCD session.

It is possible to create liveUSB for any liveCD distros. But it will
take time to tinker the scripts which are placed in iso image specific
to liveCD sessions.

Thanks,
Mohan.

Hi Lokeswara

The Preferred USB bootable GNU/Lunix distro would be Ubuntu. Download the
latest version Jaunty Jackalope, boot the live CD, plug in your USB. Then,
go to System->Administration->USB Startup Disk creator. Select the image of
Jaunty on your hard disk and it automatically creates the USB Startup disk.
Now, select USB as the primary boot device in the BIOS, and reboot. Ubuntu
should now boot!

Cheers!

An alternative is to use unetbootin from "any" operating system.
The unetbootin does not require booting into the live CD.

This was discussed at great lengths when the ilugc website
revamp/alternative was first considered. A number of members on this list
were against using a CMS for the site for various reasons.

My experience with Drupal, Joomla and Plone:

Drupal is a general framework for websites. It also functions as a CMS but
it can go way beyond being just a CMS. It can be hosted on shared hosting
accounts without any problems. Lots and lots of plugins, templates etc.
Very flexible.

Joomla is an excellent CMS. It is primarily a CMS but can also be modified
to do other things. Again, loads of components and modules. Very easy to
setup and maintain. Slightly less flexible than Drupal.

Both Joomla and Drupal have vibrant user communities and lot of resources
on the web. Both are easy to learn and use.

Many shared hosting services provide security updates to Drupal and Joomla
installations on their servers as and added service at no cost.

Plone - Plone is python based and will require a VPS or a dedicated
server. It requires quite a bit of memory to run properly. By default uses
a ZopeDB database, but can be configured to use some other standard
compliant RDBMSs as well. Very powerful. Very flexible. Not easy to learn
and configure. Customization requires a fairly steep learning curve. Quite
a few resources on the web but not nearly as much as for Drupal or Joomla.
Also, you won't find as many developers comfortable with Plone.

There are other solutions which can be used as well - Confluence is one
example. It is available free of charge for open source websites.
MuleSource, Spring framework, Open Symphony etc use Confluence. Very
powerful and flexible solution.

Prem

My experience with unetbootin (from sourceforge); although it supposedly 
supports any Linux distro the only success I have had with it is 
Ubuntu.  No luck with converting openSUSE LiveCD ISOs to USB bootable 
images.

Use a LiveCD to see if it works if you have physical access to such an 
unit.

To the best of my knowledge, a touchscreen is a film over the display 
and behaves like a mouse giving the co-ordinates of the pointer; very 
much like the mouse we are used to.  They used to be serial mouse 
compatible now they are probably USB mouse compatible.

Hi!

This site gives info on CMS for various applications.

http://www.opensourcecms.com/


"Each system listed here provides for a user demo so you can make an
informed decision regarding which system best suits your needs without
having to go through the tedious process of installing multiple
systems only to find they don't do what you require"

The features are explained and they are also rated .There are user
comments also.

A very useful resource if you want yo evaluate a CMS !

Cheers

Hi,
First, please explain the problem in detail. Without proper information, the
community will not be able to help you.
Anyways, coming to your problem.

There are two possibilities:

          1)  Firefox is browsing in offline mode. You need to go to
File->Work Offline. Please uncheck this option.
          2) Firefox is not configured to send data via the office proxy.
You need to go to Edit->Preferences->Advanced->Network->Settings. In this
window, you need to set the HTTP proxy and port, and the proxy server and
port for other protocols also (if needed).

Other than these, please check if you are properly connected to the internal
network and also properly connected to the internet. Please approach you
senior officials if you do not know the details.

Hi !

I see that Maemo is a "platform" from the web site.

http://maemo.org/intro/

http://maemo.org/intro/platform/

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maemo

"Maemo is a software platform that is mostly based on open source code
and powers mobile devices such as the Nokia N810 Internet Tablet.
Maemo platform has been developed by Nokia in collaboration with many
open source projects such as the Linux kernel , Debian , GNOME , and
many more."

"The Maemo platform is the core software stack that runs on mobile
devices such as the Nokia N900. The Maemo platform is built in large
parts of open source components. The Maemo SDK provides an open
development environment for applications on top of the Maemo
platform."

So I guess it is more than OS.

Nokia is a speacial hardware  based on TI OMAP ARM SoCs and also many
custom hardware features.

So questions is  ........ is it possible to make it run on other
hardware also Meaning non-nokia  Tablets pcs based on regular x86
cpus ?

Are there any other  platforms like this ?

Hi,

I don't know a direct method for doing this, but my suggestion is :

          1) Take the source code for these commands
          2) Modify it such that you get the uid, check if its the
restricted user. If so, exit printing "PERMISSION DENIED", else continue
normal execution.
          3) Compile the source code, get the executable and replace it with
the original executable in one of the directories in your $PATH variable.

If there is a direct command to do this,  please do enlighten me. I am eager
to know.

Hi,

I work for CSS Corp in Chennai. We are looking for a few Linux
professionals to work from Chennai on support for Open Source
products. We are looking for a few people with 3-4 years of experience
with good knowledge of multiple Linux distros, major Open Source
products and the dynamics of open source development etc.

We may also be able to hire a few freshers or those with less than 2
years of experience, if they are very good at Linux and/or a few major
open source products. We are also open to the idea of taking a few
interns who are in the final year of their college.

If you are interested in discussing this opportunity further, please
send your resume to paulanveen.h@csscorp.com.

Thanks and Regards,
Murthy Raju

products. We will provide required product  training. The skill that
we expect the candidate with 3-4 years of experience to have is:

Required:

1.	Expert level exposure to Operating Systems(Linux or any Unix variant)
2.	Installation and Configuration of OS
3.	Compiling the kernel and other applications
4.	Installation and configuration of Open Source applications from
vendor supplied packages and from sources
5.	Advanced networking concepts
6.	Advanced scripting with at least one ? shell, Perl, Python
7.	Expert level exposure to at least 2 of the following categories of
applications:
            Name Servers
            Directory Servers
            Clustering, Load Balancing High Availability
            Firewalls and Network Security
            Web Services
8.	Good Communication and leadership skills

I personally do not have any issues with the choice on the server side.  

After all, it is the service provider's freedom to choose that.

However, the problem arises when that service provider forces the 
consumer to a specific platform (Windows) and browser (IE and sometimes 
a specific version!).  That is a bigger problem IMO.  The people who 
develop such sites do not bother about compatability with browsers 
other than IE.

My "pat" (sp?) paise :)

Additional information

Dompdf seems to have no unicode support so i switched to tcpdf. Tcpdf seems
to server my purpose to some extend. I took some html tamil text from
ta.wikipedia and gave it as an input to generate pdf. The output pdf doesn't
preserves the context of the word.

For example let us take the input text

?????? ??????????? ????????? ??????????? ???????????? ???????????? ????????
?????????? ??????????????? ??? ????? ????????? ??? ????? ??????????? ?????

The output pdf is not readable looks as below

this will be greatly appriciated.

I would tend to concur with this view.

Nowadays due to recession employers seem to get a good
choice and they are able to maximize their advantage in
squeezing more work for less money.

Fundamentally I am not averse to this idea as long as the
pay is reasonably good. By that I mean a salary of above
30,000 per month or so in Chennai would be considered
good enough for leading a decent life(unmarried with 4
years exp).

But it turns out that outside of service companies such
salaries seem like a chimera. I could be wrong and I
wish that I am.

I like all ideas given by others and I may not get into
testing this thing due to lack of time. Though I shall
surely get to it as and when time permits and post to LUG. This could
even take a month. Anyway.

The first thought that occurred to me was  chroot with
just these commands. But chroot can only be done by root.

So you could have a "janitor daemon" that runs as root and
you could have users access these commands through a
janitor service. This is what I am doing in my SpamCheetah
product.

I know you can get a lot more creative and secure but this
seems like a good idea.

Along with all other ideas given by others.

Hi,

tcpdf looks good.

In the example pages.
http://www.tecnick.com/public/code/cp_dpage.php?aiocp_dp=tcpdf_examples

8. External UTF-8 text file:

http://www.tecnick.com/pagefiles/tcpdf/example_008.phps
http://www.tecnick.com/pagefiles/tcpdf/example_008.pdf

This examples shows the utf-8 PDF perfectly.

I think, you have to setfont properly. use any tamil unicode fomt.

use the font lohit-tamil.

update us with your results.

Yes that's a nice study .
People can refer to the wiki article[1] for a comparision but I would
like to hear individual views/likes/concerns regarding any CMS .

By the way why is "wordpress" missing in the list ?

When I search in google, I got enough info from
google<http://www.google.co.in/search?q=difference+between+Joomla+and+Drupal&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:unofficial&client=firefox-a>.

But I am not interested to provide the those link. I would like to share my
experience with you. Its may be fit, if you are in my same level.

Before 3 years back, i was planing to create a public portal for learning
purpose. But I was zero in web languages. Even now also. Then I come to knew
about the CMS and posted the same query in few forums. I got many answers
like Joomla is best, Mambo is best, Drupal is best and finally it stopped in
flame war. So I got confused. Then I decided to learn both. First I started
with Drupal. No idea about it, Drupal was not much impressed by me, in terms
of available plugins, handling contents,.etc.
Then I started Joomla (At that time, Joomla splited from Mambo. Note: One
more confusion!). With Joomla I was much comfortabel with its components and
modules. It was very easy to handle the contents, templates, plugins,.etc.
Till now I am using Joomla. I am not facing any difficulties in designing a
Joomla based site. I dont bother it has written by php, python,.etc.

However, I also faced few difficulties when I changed my joomla based site
from one hosting to another. Finally I failed to retrive my old content and
then designed every thing one again. I feel, taking a backup and retrive it
in another hosting is difficult in joomla or I am not aware of the tricks.
But no idea about other CMSs.

the CMS is like a sweet. It has many varieties with different tastes like
Laddu, Jaankri,.etc. One like Laddu; another like some other sweet. Like
that we have no of CMS with different features/varieties. Its upto you and
your requirement. Based on your requirement select a cms.

My final few words are, why you should not try all the tastes?. I mean learn
both and then decide the best one for you. Whats wrong with it. Do not much
consider about other's review and confuse.

Because it's so full of holes that you need to "upgrade" it every other 
week? Which is what annoys me about web apps written in php - whether 
php encourages bad code or what I don't know, but almost all popular 
open source php software is full of spaghetti code. I say this as 
somebody who wrote a plugin for wordpress and integrated another php app 
(elgg.net) into another system. I can't even say how bad my experience 
of elgg integration was. Pure horror would cover it.

every 6 months ubuntu releases updates / upgrades. is it full of holes?
different projects have different release times. wordpress able to release
the fixes quickly. what about kernel patches? u have continues releases
coming? is it full of holes?

no language encourages writing bad code. it depends on the developer who
write it. u can write bad code in any language.

just because u used a crapy system for doing some crappy integration, u
cannot blame the entire wordpress. wordpress never appreciated it. it has
the capability to do anything with it.

wordpress with elgg - u tried to create what ever with it. u should blame
the person who gave such a crappy suggestion. before starting any
integration, first u should try to analyze whether this will fit or not.

every one wants to protect the trademark. what about Linux? Firefox? and
Redhat? fedora?

there is nothing wrong with drupal doing it. till now, all its code are

I started this thread with the intention of showing that choice of platform 
depends on various factors, and blind choice of a cms for every use may be 
overkill in some circumstances. I have used plone in a couple of instances 
where the users are absolute newbies, and minmal configuration is necessary. It 
has worked out ok - until the users started to demand more customisation, in 
which case I have shifted to using a framework. Perhaps a simple analogy would 
help. If I want idlis for breakfast, there are 4 ways of getting them:

1. buy the rice, dhal and other indgredients, grind the maav to taste, ferment 
overnight and cook and eat in the morning

2. buy already ground maav, add other ingredients, ferment overnight and cook 
and eat in the morning

3. buy ready made fermented maav, cook and eat.

4. buy ready made idlis and eat

the choice of what to do depends on time available, skill set available, 
finance and taste.

Please read the reasons for the upgrade. Do you seriously think they 
release wordpress updates with new features every two weeks? Check the 
Changelog, please:

http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Versions

Two of the last three releases are security releases. Do you see how 
closely they are released? Exactly two weeks. Please show me a blog 
system written in any other language that does 'security releases' so 
often. Please proceed to read up the past release schedule, this pattern 
will be self-evident.

Nice platitude. But fortunately, some frameworks help you write good 
code - they encourage best practices, like MVC, writing unit tests, etc. 
Not say MVC is the best approach, but it's at least better than mixing 
view code with sql. I know there are templates systems etc for php, but 
they're very much optional, and the language itself doesn't place any 
emphasis on using them.

I'll let that slide, because it makes no sense w.r.t your next statement.

I did not integrate wordpress *with* elgg. I just had to write a 
wordpress plugin to support a web service. And elgg integration was a 
separate project altogether. Please read my mail again.

"support position" does not need to mean a position somehow inferior
to the position of a developer in terms of challenge of the
compensation. Support professional does not automatically mean some
one doing a low end work.  Particularly in the area of enterprise
technical support, it is not uncommon to find support professionals
who have as intimate knowledge of a product as the core developers do.
I have had the opportunity to work with quite a few such people. But I
agree that the relative  lack of awareness about the nature of
Technical Support industry in India results in many people not
benefiting from the opportunities in this industry.  I have seen 2-way
movement between support and areas like professional services, quality
assurance and development and of course more managerially inclined
people move into management. But of course, technical support jobs
come in all shapes and colors just as developer jobs do and one has to
choose the employer right.

Also with commoditization of most software products, more money would
come from services around the product, rather than from the
development of the product and technical support is one such key
service.

Though I am not allowed to talk in great detail about the positions
that I posted about, I can say that some of the very promising Open
Source cloud computing related software would be the focus here.

There are 100s of open source CMSs out there. This is because some
developer or other decided that ALL of the existing open source CMSs
didn't meet his expectation and so he/she wrote one more. Very few of
these CMSs see widespread usage - Drupal, Joomla, Typo3, Wordpress etc are
exceptions and not the rule.

As these CMSs are more frequently used, attacks against these CMSs will
also be higher and also also the people working on fixing these holes -
which is why you see lot more security patches in the more popular CMSs.

If you go for a completely static site, it would be only a matter of time
before you start adding dynamic elements to the site. It may start with a
signup form, a news ticker and soon before you know it, you will have your
own mini CMS.

If you decide to develop a CMS from scratch, the chances are that many
security holes will remain in your solution because not too many people
will check for them. Therefore superficially it may seem that your
software is more secure - that is until someone decides to exploit some
hole.

The best approach is to choose any of the popular CMSs (they are all
mostly similar in terms of features) and then use it for the site instead
of developing one from scratch or assuming that you are going to remain
content with a purely static site. If the CMS sees good usage, you will
also receive timely fixes which you can apply to the site.

Thanks,
Prem

I basically agree to the argument that they are used more, and there are 
more holes discovered - but that certainly doesn't explain the 
_frequency_ at which the upgrades arrive - there are other open source 
software used as widely as wordpress, if not more. You don't get 
bi-weekly admonishments to upgrade or risk getting hacked into.  (I tend 
to take these warnings seriously, because I had bad experiences with 
both WP and Drupal security-wise). Take the case of Apache, for example 
- when was the last time you had to upgrade because of a security issue?

I only recommended we go static way only for the main site - we just 
need the functionality of a wiki, without the bother of managing spam. 
The ability to checkout, modify and checkin updates to the site is 
basically to avoid the notion of a signup form. That said, I didn't say 
we need to go completely the static way - something like planet can only 
be done effectively by a dynamic component.

Unfortunately web apps can never be secured . There would be some
vulnerability popping up . I think this is not the case of wordpress
alone .
<assumption>
WP has a huge customer base hence will have lot of bugs .. may be the
user vs contributor ratio plays a major role for
testing,reporting,designing and developing the WP .
</assumption>

PHP does that :(
Well it was created to be a "Personal Home Page"  and the first
versions were so simple to use that it gained huge popularity .
But its always up to developers to write clean code .

I would like to know the issues you faced with it . Did you file a bug report ?
Anyways maybe a different thread in this mailing list would be fine .

Sure, you cannot make them completely air-tight, but you can ensure a 
_reasonable_ amount of security if you architect a webapp properly, 
ensure you have proper test coverage and take basic security 
precautions. But, as I said, the web framework you are using plays a big 
role in helping you achieve those goals.

Basically a vulnerability with xmlrpc.php that ships with all WP 
installs (it was repoted by then) - somebody took advantage of a 
vulnerability, was able to write some perl scripts to the /tmp directory 
and was happily using the vps as a dumping/sharing site for some pirated 
software. This was years ago, when I didn't know too much about sysadmin 
stuff.

Luckily, the hosting provider Bytemark, found the problem and that led 
me to a long round of learning about firewalls, iptables, etc. Since 
then I immediately delete xmlrpc.php in every fresh WP install/upgrade I 
do (yes, I wish I could get rid of a legacy WP install I have and move 
it elsewhere, but right now it has tons of data and quite a chore to move).

Vamsee.

plone is a very widely used CMS - where are the security patches? I do not 
think their site even has a security page, feed or mailing list. So the logic 
is flawed

I see your point but Apache has been around a lot longer than WP. In
anycase, there was a vulnerability a few weeks ago:

http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2009-August/016066.html

Also, I upgraded a Apache Tomcat a few weeks ago due to a vulnerability.

Consider the Centos Security Update Announce list for the past 10 days in
September.
http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2009-September/thread.html

The link above will indicate why I would consider using CentOS instead of
other distros which don't get these frequent security bug fixes.

If the turn around time for publishing bug fixes from the time when a
vulnerability is listed is too high, it counts against the project. And
that is a better metric of project quality rather than the number of
listed vulnerabilities. That and, of course, the severity of the
vulnerability.

I have used Joomla, WP etc before and I have upgraded due to security
issues a number of times. But then, I have done the same with my OS,
webserver, database, browser etc. If you turn on automatic updates even on
your linux desktop, you will see how often security fixes flow in.

My point is essentially just this - between setting up a website from
ground up using custom developed code and using a popular, frequently
update CMS, my vote goes towards the second option - that is, using a
popular CMS.

Thank you,
Prem

an interesting thing happened on the django list some time back. Some php guy 
wanted to migrate to django and asked 'where is the page for security 
vulnerabilities?' and was told that there was no such page as there are no 
security vulnerabilities. So the guy promptly refused to look further into 
django as he felt that an application without regular updates to fix security 
holes is unreliable.

if there is no security vulnerability, either software is good or not many
people are using it and hence no bugs are reported.

Are you sure with the kernel version? I have fedora 11 with complete update

Have a look at the Samsung R418, my new notebook model. I got it for
32 k. But a better processor:

Intel Core 2 Duo T6500 @ 2.1 GHz
2 GB DDR RAM @ 800 MHz
320 GB HDD
Bluetooth
Wireless - included in all laptops!
* No card reader though

And it works perfectly on Fedora 11. If you prefer Pentium Dual Core,
you may save 2 to 3 k.

There is no such thing as a software without vulnerability. Even OpenBSD
has had a few vulnerabilities over the years.

Anyway, here is plone's page:
http://dev.plone.org/plone/search?q=vulnerability&noquickjump=1&ticket=on&changeset=on&milestone=on&wiki=on

I have given "vulnerability" as the search word. Please try using any of
the others such as "security" etc.

Also, since Plone is based on Zope, zope's vulnerabilities affect plone as
well. Finding zope's bug reporting page for security vulnerabilities is
left as an exercise for the reader :)

Prem

Message-ID: <47d9fe5c0909100550h4ad278d8ob69e1dbaf79a95e2@mail.gmail.com>

Fedora GNU/Linux Event @ SRM:

An event named Linux Lingo was organised today as a part of SRM
University?s tech fest, Aarush 2009. Myself and Mr. Ramadoss from
NRCFOSS, Fedora Ambassasador conducted the event. Ramadoss introduced
the students to the philosophy of free software and Stallman?s crusade
against the imposition of proprietary software. He delved into the GNU
philosophy and gave several examples to emphasise the concept.

He then talked about the open source community following which we
demonstrated a Fedora 11 installation. We got a volunteer to install
the operating system. The audience had several doubts about the
install process, and we resolved them. For the fun of it we tried to
install in Hindi once, but reverted to English finally.

After the demonstration, I spoke about the software available in
Fedora, and then about a few basic command line utilities. It was
followed by a talk on bash scripting.

The day ended with our answering a few questions from the students
about open source, real IT revolution and choice of software. Over a
hundred students participated in the event and were introduced to the
free software movement. We thank the coordinators of the event, Shiv
Deepak, Vipul Jain, Anisha Kaul and Prakhar Agarwal for the enthusiasm
they showed in organising this event.

Your question is hard to answer without additional info from you.

Did you connect the microphone to the rose pin or the blue pin?

rose pin is for mic input and blue for line-in.

http://www.audiotoolers.com/ubbt/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=7799

You can try adjusting the volumes and gains of the input pins using
alsamixer or whatever. You may have to unmute the inputs.

You can install record(1) by Gerd Knorr or use the rec utility of sox.

Instead you can also use

# cat /dev/dsp > i.raw

to record.

It may work.

Best of luck!

You also have several UI recording programs in desktop apps suite in GNOME
and KDE.

By the way did you know that your name k7 is a big company in Chennai
 and that they have an antivirus product? ;)

Untangle is a firewall and installing that requires a lot of
background knowledge
in networking and stuff like NAT, port forwarding, DMZ and so on.

There will be plenty of luggies who will know how to install untangle.

It also has a great web interface.

You can try playing with it and when you get stuck you can ask a specific
question in LUG and expect to get help.

Kg,

Since we are on the topic of frameworks, have you looked at Scala and the
Lift Framework? What I find amazing is the performance - it is on par or
slightly faster than plain Java on many benchmarks. To put that in
perspective, it is several times faster than groovy, ruby and python. This
is because scala runs directly on the JVM.

Take a look:
http://liftweb.net/

By the way, I have done considerable programming on python and have used
plone. Fact is, I have used plone to run our own intranet here at
Songbird. I think it is an excellent framework - but a bit complicated to
customize.

If you prefer using Python and like more speed, you can look at the
upcoming Cobra language.
http://cobra-language.com/docs/python/

They are porting this to work over the jvm as well. May be interesting to
port Django over to use Cobra. Cobra and python are similar enough and so
it may not be that difficult.

Regards,
Prem

Message-ID: <a8f990120909100808o2a051501pf21e712ba3fa235a@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,
         As the title says, Linux-2.6.31 was released a few
hours ago. I downloaded the patchset and built it, and I
have a very good feeling about it - it's probably going to
be as legendary as 1.0.9, 1.2.13, 2.0.31, 2.4.13/21...

I'm still retaining my ancient Fedora Core 4 userland,
with gcc-4.0.2. Nevertheless, everything went smoothly,
and desktop responsivity seems to be a tad better than
2.6.24, my previous longtime favourite. Xine runs smoothly
without stuttering, even on battery with a tickless
kernel. Battery life seems to be as good as before,
so no compromises there. It's seems to be throttling
down more efficiently without giving up much on
performance.

    There's lots of tracing and metering built into the
internals now, but I didn't config any of it. I'll play
with Btrfs and some of the Radeon stuff later, but
for now, the defaults just seem to work...

Highly recommended - give it a whirl. Mad props to
Linus and all the kernel developers - the best just
got even better.

that is with respect to the development server which is never used, or 
intended to be used in production - it is just a tool to help development on a 
local machine and as such is not part of django's production environment.

stunning - 10 holes in 4 years as compared to 63 in drupal for 2009 alone. And 
looking at the 'holes' in plone, I do not see anything mission critical

actually, Zope is so paranoid about security that even an admin would find it

Untangle installation is fairly straightforward. I've used it and it
went thro' first shot. Defaults work. Was this the first boot up? I'd
suggest you try the LiveCD first, iron out the configuration and then
go in for a permanent install.

For your current problem, you could also login as a terminal and flush
all rules, save and then restart to see if it loads well. But then,
this means no firewall rules are running. You'll need to set those up
yourself manually.

Like Girish said, Untangle has a pretty interface but that does not
mean one can use it without understanding the underlying layers.

if you want to customise, forget plone. But it is good for quick and dirty 
sites where you can leave the hard work for the user. Another nice thing is 
that you just need one plone installation per server - you can create multiple 
plone sites and manage the domains with the VHM. And if you upgrade, you just 
need to upgrade one installation. As far as I can see, drupal requires a 
separate copy for each site - I may be wrong. If I am right, then running 10 
sites on the server and making 50 hot fixes in 2009 - I will be doing 500 
separate maintainance upgrades in a period of 9 months! I will need to hire an 
engineer just to do this. The same 10 sites could run on one install of django 
- which can be upgraded with a simple 'svn up' - and that can be put in cron 
and run once a month or so. So I would conclude that drupal is a good tool for 
an enlightened end user who just running one or two sites - but not an option 
for a professional who is maintaining a large number of sites. I have one app 
running on django on webfaction which is in daily active use - I have not 
visited it or touched it in any way for the last two years.

probably some one will do it - I think django is already ported to jython and

mission critical

Actually, Drupal's bug reporting system accepts bug reports even for third
party modules. Many of those modules are absolutely not needed for the
default install of Drupal and are needed only for some specialised
functionality.

Also, note that those 10 holes are only for plone - if you include bugs in
zope, zopedb etc into the equation, the number grows. If you also include
third party modules, the number becomes even larger.

Regards,
Prem

i think you need to learn about the tool before talking about it. you can
host as many as sites with single drupal source

please check http://drupal.org/getting-started/6/install/multi-site

you can upgrade just drupal core. if you want site specific modules, that
too is possible. drupal has db upgrade too. hiring a drupal pro is easier
than a django pro if you need. for drupal, you do not need an engineer to do
things.

i wonder how you could do 'svn up' on production site without testing
compatibility with new version.

you need to understand drupal better. few pointers below

if you have not touched it or visited it, that means no features being added
or you didn't find any bugs.

obviously by doing svn up on my local machine a few days before the scheduled 
production svn up and checking that nothing is broken - and anyway django 
gives adequate warning whenever a backward incompatible change is going to be 
implemented

Brilliant!

Cobra seems to have just those things I miss in Python.
Hope it gets as popular as Python.

Very Sorry that i do not have answer but I will suggest "not to " support
IE6 anymore. IE6 is totally insecure. You can detect browser in javascript
and if browser = IE6 then just put a notice that "Please download new
version of FireFox or Chrome, We do not support this old and crap software"


PS: making website to work on IE6 is a big pain and headache. a developer
can understand it. And very developer must boycott IE.

I seriously doubt that and from the web site I couldn't find anything 
regarding this.
As of now the language itself is very young.
I hope as the language matures batteries will get added eventually.

Kg,

Since we are on the topic of frameworks, have you looked at Scala and the
Lift Framework? What I find amazing is the performance - it is on par or
slightly faster than plain Java on many benchmarks. To put that in
perspective, it is several times faster than groovy, ruby and python. This
is because scala runs directly on the JVM.

Take a look:
http://liftweb.net/

By the way, I have done considerable programming on python and have used
plone. Fact is, I have used plone to run our own intranet here at
Songbird. I think it is an excellent framework - but a bit complicated to
customize.

If you prefer using Python and like more speed, you can look at the
upcoming Cobra language.
http://cobra-language.com/docs/python/

They are porting this to work over the jvm as well. May be interesting to
port Django over to use Cobra. Cobra and python are similar enough and so
it may not be that difficult.

Regards,
Prem

Hello "(no subject)" thread participants,

Its a surprise that how atleast one of the participants didnot even attempt to change the subject line to be relevant.

Even if the original sender of the message didnot care about the subject line, atleast the other participants who reply to that message could have attempted to change it & educate the original sender.

Unfortunately no. No batteries are provided and it has to be hand cranked
for now :)

The language is still quite young - but because it runs on .NET/Mono (and
is being ported to JVM), it should be possible to use the .NET or the Java
libraries.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: This is just a guess. I haven't actually used Cobra yet.
What I like about Cobra is the fact that it is very similar to python but
really fast, has built-in unit testing support, does not have the awful
"self" parameter needed in python, catches typos at compile time rather
than run time etc.

By the way, Scala can use any java library - Spring framework, hibernate
etc. Scala is quite similar to Cobra.

Prem

That's unfortunate .

Shame on "Dell,Asus,Acer,HP,IBM" Indian manufacturing units .. huh :X

 I think all these marketing people(especially indian) inside these
companies *should* be educated by Redhat[1] or Novell[2]  who sell OEM
 .

Any idea why it is very hard to get the Ubuntu version of dell PC/netbook ?

Sorry for top post.


In the past 6 months, I bought 2 Acer Aspire One netbooks in Chennai
without Win XP.  I think Linspire or some Acer flavor of Linux was
pre-installed on both.

Let me know if you need any help in sourcing one.

You might want to give it a shot again - perhaps that was true say 5 
years ago, but that's no longer true. Ruby is not perfect, but can get 
you really productive in a short time. The same philosophy extends to 
Rails.

Both have embraced the fact that Ruby doesn't come with too many 
batteries included - and that's why Rubyforge is such a big part of Ruby 
development. Python was still getting it's eggs in order when installing 
any library in Ruby was just a matter of doing "sudo gem install xyz". 
Now, GitHub has become another hotbed of 3rd-party batteries.

Now, I agree that Ruby doesn't fit everybody's temperament - nor do I 
recommend it for everybody (though I wish they did try it) - but it's 
like sort of being on a thrill-ride. You will only like it if you like 
the furious pace of change :). Today's sacred-cow-tools will be made 
obsolete by next month's better-and-faster-than-thou tool. This is why 
writing books for Ruby/Rails development is notoriously hard - the best 
practices change by the time the book gets published (or a new release 
with a ton of new features is ready).

If you thrive on learning everything at a fast pace, not get overly 
religious about what you learnt so far and be ready to ditch it all and 
start over again in a short time, Ruby might be just for you :).

Vamsee.

Rails is neat, and IMO felt a lot more like an web app framework
than Django.  Django felt more like it was better designed for creating
CMS than general web apps.


The one issue no one has discussed so far is ease and stability
of deployment on shared hosting provider setups  -- not everyone
can justify a virtual private server.

My hosting provider (dreamhost.com) is a typical web host, and
it would be good to see web frameworks and applications working
nicely in such scenarios.

I would love to deploy more Rails apps at work, but Rails has a
huge problem running on dreamhost.  It constantly crashes, pages
don't load randomly, performance is terrible, etc.  After lots of
troubleshooting, I gave up trying to adopt Rails in my environment.

However, on the same setup php and python/fcgi run perfectly.

Consequently, I just setup a Drupal website for a school website

Ah yes, that is indeed a problem - though there are several hacks (like 
freezing gems to your vendor directory) that can help, but I've never 
tried it on dreamhost, so it might or might not work. But if I'm not 
wrong, dreamhost did add some Rails support recently, you might want to 
check on that.

If you want to try something entirely different, try Heroku. They have a 
free plan, and it's perfect for getting started with Rails without the 
hosting headaches. Or, if you're really adventurous, you could try it 
with JRuby on AppEngine.

Vamsee.

What exactly is the subject of this thread???

I have lost track of this discussion.

I find it strange that in a list where every newcomer is sermoned  to
read a thousand words before posting to list and a whole thread goes
on without a subject line!

dreamhost has a very bad reputation in the django community at least.

True, but it's not because they lack initiative. There are several 
reports on the net from good sources that Microsoft is putting 
tremendous pressure on Netbook manufacturers not to use Linux (apart 
from giving heavy discounts on XP) because they're really scared the low 
price point can become a entry point for Linux into consumer computing.

Acer recently announced a netbook based on Android OS and immediately 
put it on the freezer, because of direct pressure from you-know-who. But 
things might change - Chrome OS is directly targeted at devices like 
netbooks, and there are a ton of hardware manufacturers are already in 
their boat. So here's hoping.

Vamsee.

This looks very much like a re-theming of Ubuntu Netbook Remix.

It is not very clear from their wiki/home page what exactly they have
changed. (I admit that I have not researched this extensively!)

Easy Peasy (formerly Ubuntu Eee) is an Ubuntu-based distribution for
netbooks. It uses Ubuntu Netbook Remix graphical user interface and
includes open source as well as proprietary software like codecs

Sorry. I just check with my vendor, they don't offer Linux based
netbooks any more.  You get WinXP Home by default.

Acer Aspire One models:  10.1" Rs 20,750 and 11.1" Rs 23,350.
Both come with 1GB RAM, 160GB HDD, blue tooth, wifi.  I believe
the 11.1" model comes with a 7hr battery.  The 11.1" sounds nice.


If you are interested, contact Praveen from TekPro on 044 26651443?.
TekPro has give me nothing by excellent service over the past 4 years.

Seems kinda odd that they'd want to include XP Home and pay
the M$ tax. That could also be one reason why netbook prices
have started creeping up again, after reaching the Rs.15k price
point last year. But then again, these new machines come with
upgraded HW, including larger/higher resolution screens and
newer processors.

There's an Acer model (751H) with a 1364x768 widescreen
display which only comes with XP Home. It was kinda
tempting, but I decided to wait for prices to drop at the
next model refresh before buying one.

The other alternative is pre-owned sub-notebooks like
the Dell Inspiron 600m or Toshiba Portege, from places
like EBay or Craigslist. These often come fully loaded
with XGA/SXGA+ displays and DVD writers, and the
HD, RAM and processor are often upgradable. Having
a built-in optical drive is a big plus compared to a
netbook. Check out the Toshiba Portege A200 - one
was on Craigslist Bangalore a short while ago.

Not exactly true.

I am yet to come across an addon like reflecto.

M$ definitely is afraid and is putting pressure I agree.

The companies which I mentioned aka "Dell,Asus,Acer,HP,IBM" have a
special relationship with GNU/Linux

IBM - contributes a lot to kernel ,apache,eclipse .. the list goes on
HP - offers/used to offer debian support in servers .(not sure)
Acer - As you mentioned .. the android plan .
Asus - Obviously the EEEPC came(notice the past tense) with Xandros in
USA and Europe.
Dell - Ubuntu netbooks and laptops ..  (can we still buy them in India?? )

Well I am not sure Win 7 sales will boost up in netbooks , but I am
seeing people demanding those companies for a refund on windows
license price.

If we demand more refunds then I guess those companies will realise
the demand for GNU/Linux machines .

On the other side Redhat,Novell and Cannonical please wake up .. even
you can put the pressure.. or will you wait till the big daddy google
comes and pushes chrome OS

Hi !

May be you should go to Hp or Dell outlet  and demand a Netbook
without XP ( or vista or win7)  and ask for a refund or discount .
We will be grateful if you post your experience or the replies you got
from the vendors.
Then collectively we may be able to do something about it. May be look
into legalities and take them to task.

Cheers

I guess the Windows EULA states clearly that you can get a refund if
you refuse the agreement.. Not sure about it.
Wanted to get a netbook for my dad not long ago, and the computer

The best place to talk about nothing is to create a seperate mailing list like "nothing user group" [nug] or "talk nothing group" [tng].

If any volunteers create such new group pls inform me to my private email id (not ilugc) so that I would also subscribe to that [nug] or [tng].

And there we can possibly talk something usefully nothing.

Friends.

Need your suggestions on setup a mail server.

It should include pop/imap/web interface
shared calender, tasks, reminders etc.

Want to migrate a company from MS exchange.
The users use MS outlook and they should feel comfortable with the
new mail server.

Zimbra and openexchange are too costly for these outlook compatibility.

Is there any free alternate to exchange/outlook pair?

Thanks.

Hi !

Yes ! There are free ,open source packages  for example like  open exchange.
We can do it ourselves by choosing various packages.
It is also possible to  get a pre-configured appliance.
Since you are talking about commercial installation they may need
support also (which is not free).

my mind thinks this way.. to know the creation date of a (any)folder
that has not been modified since OS installaion,(e.g. /etc/power or
/etc/NetworkManager)



p.s:there would be a cleaner way than this definitely :-)

Great news , still can't believe that amazon gave a refund !!

<quote>
With The Open Sourcerer proving requesting a refund does work you can
visit Amazon (UK) with confidence knowing ?40 (US$66) will be refunded

Openchange

http://www.openchange.org

It will have complete calendering and tasks,notes integration very soon.


You can use it as Exchange replacement on the server by integrating it
with an MTA like postfix or so.

People can use MS Outlook on their desktops and the server can be
linux running OpenChange.

The only company to reverse engineer the MAPI protocol successfully is
Postpath which got acquired by Cisco for a whopping 215 million $.


But that is not open source.

Nobody else has done it so far. Though the entire MAPI standards are open.

Microsoft does encryption of its packets and also compression but then it
is all open now. No one can say that Microsoft is playing foul. It is our
job to sit and reverse engineer. I think it can be done. With proper focus
and effort.

Solutions like Zimbra and Scalix involve installing MAPI connectors on the
Outlook side. People don't like that solution.

It is not MAPI on the wire.

What do you mean by multimedia?

It stands for a lot of things. There are several audio/music liveCDs that come
with complete audio studio tools for audio engineering and sound effects.

You can download liveCDs, burn them, boot and you are done. ;)

You can also read Dave Phillip's articles on linuxjournal. He is a musician
and he writes very good articles.

http://geexbox.org (boring) and http://dynebolic.org are some examples.

I used to like wimp based on mplayer.

You can play videos, music and so on from CD, DVD and USB. You can
also stream from the network.

Or do you mean something else? Multimedia is an overloaded word.

Using a specific word is better.

If you used the Debian installer while installing the system (which
is the usual way of installing a fresh system) then you would have 
log files in /var/log/installer/ that provide detailed information
about what the installer did along with time stamps.

However, note that these time stamps are usually based on your
system's hardware clock so if that is not accurate, then the time you
get will not be.

On "ubuntu" this is not easy to do. Many "standard" system services are
tied to gnome. So the basic "ubuntu-desktop" pseudo-package depends
on a number of gnome/gtk packages.

To reduce this dependence people created "kubuntu" and "xubuntu". The
most recent project is "lubuntu" which is probably what you want. As
far as I know the last project is still under development. You may
want to join in to test and develope "lubuntu".

Between these two, I'd recommend Scalix as it has far richer server
side controls. IMHO, better suited for enterprise implementation while
will not make much of a difference for a retail user site. For a
retail user site, I feel Zimbra is better as it has better knobs for
the user.

I agree. For me the choice is very simple. Scalix is written in C and Zimbra
in Java.

I tried Zarafa and got it work. Sorry I forgot to mention that. That is another
alternative too. It is also written in C.

But once again, it involves connectors.

I like Zarafa best. Though once OpenChange matures all this will become
irrelevant and it will kill Zarafa's commercial advantage I think.

Moreover Zimbra is more of a heavyweight mail solution that is popular and
I wonder why.

I am looking at volunteers to develop a webmail for IndiMail
(Squirrelmail works with Indimail. But I don't like the interface)

Why don't you try IndiMail or at least test it. In all our tests in my
current organization (> 1.5 million messages per day per box) and
earlier when working in one of India's largest private ISP, IndiMail
performs many times faster than postfix and qmail.

I have just released version 1.6 yesterday at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/indimail/

You can read the full documentation at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mbhangui/IndiMail

I have also put tutorials at
https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/indimail/index.php?title=indimail:Community_Portal

IndiMail does not have shared calender, tasks, reminders. There are many
open source alternatives available (Darwin's webcal server, etc). But is
there a possibility that folks from ilugc can collaborate and create
something?

IndiMail has a feature called user-location aware. It allows any
organization to migrate out of Exchange, Lotus Notes without disrupting
existing users. The user-location aware property allows IndiMail to put
another box with the same domain and have new users on the new box and
older user remain on the old proprietary box. It takes care of
distributing mails to the correct box. It also takes care of redirecting
outlook and other mail clients correctly to the correct box. In my
earlier job at an ISP, we migrated seamlessly many corporate out of
exchange to a linux solution without the end users noticing anything.

IndiMail comes with lot of modern features. Recent example is Bounce
Address Tag Validation. Indimail is one of the very few mailserver
supporting it.

http://mipassoc.org/batv/deploy/index.html

I am looking at volunteers who can further develop more features
especially on a web frontend for mail and administration

Hi all,

FStival is a Free Software Festival conducted annually, since 2004, by
GNU/Linux User Group of Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai
and GLUG-Madurai in commemoration of Software Freedom Day. The
objective of FStival is to create awareness of Free Open Source
Software (FOSS) among the general public of South Tamil Nadu. Over the
years, FStival has been a venue where students of various age groups
and domains, professionals (of both IT and non-IT fields), enthusiasts
and the curious have come together to get introduced to FOSS, interact
with each other and share their experiences. Every year, the
participants bring in empty CD/DVDs to copy Free Software of their
choice from the exhaustive repository at Thiagarajar College of
Engineering (maintained by GLUGOT). We will have many stalls in which
various Free Software tools are demonstrated.

This year FStival is celebrated on SFD - September 19, 2009 at
Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai. All are invited and
welcome to be a part of FStival and celebrate freedom. More
information can be found at - http://fstival.org,
http://glug-madurai.org and http://glugot.tce.edu.

Thank you.

So, what's the problem with that? Meta packages are for convenience.
Removing them is not going to break anything.

That is true. I should have said that the packages that
"ubuntu-desktop" depends on provide a number of services that a
"standard" desktop depends on. So, if you want to remove all these
(gnome-based) packages then you probably need to replace them with
others that provide similar functionality.

In the case of kubuntu, some kde-based alternatives are provided
while xubuntu uses some gtk-based alternatives. I don't know what
the replacements for "lxde" will be but perhaps "lubuntu" will make
appropriate choices.

On the other hand you may not want some of the functions provided by
these packages and are willing to organise your desktop/workspace
etc. on your own.

Regards,

Kapil.

The LXDE programs are listed in

http://wiki.lxde.org/en/Main_Page

If your distribution of choice has it packaged, then you can pick and
choose what you want. There are also individual distribution pages with
more details.

Message-ID: <d16b1c80909130413h20a03e1eo4a8c39e55a7f2bf6@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings!

Today, Sunday, September 13, 2009, I deployed Fedora 11, and Fedora 11
offline repository at Devnar Foundation for the Blind, Mayurmarg,
Begumpet, Hyderabad, India.

They have been using a proprietary software on a proprietary system,
and wanted to explore better alternatives in this regard.

I was given a 256 MB RAM system, with 40 GB hard-disk. This system did
not have Internet connectivity. The offline repository really helped.
Most of the systems are donated by companies for the school to use.
The school follows the Andhra Pradesh State syllabus, and this year
they have introduced Intermediate (after Board X). They write their
exams on slate or on Braille paper (which I believe, is very
expensive). Some students stay in the school hostel, while others' are
day scholars.

They do have one MountBatten Brailler [1] (costing around 1,00,000
INR) which can produce output to a computer or a printer. It also
spells out the input. I didn't have time to test it with Fedora
(serial, parallel ports).

A junior teacher, Miss. Shashi, did try out Orca [2] with the Gnome
shortcut keys, listening to Orcas' audio output. She was able to
navigate through the Gnome menus, and use Openoffice.org Writer. They
did want spoken American English, which is default in Gnome. It will
be good to have those Orca audio recorded in Telugu or other regional
languages in India.

There were some very interesting questions like:

* Orca loads only after logging in -- which spells out menus, the
frame window that is selected, keys pressed etc. So, grub which loads
prior to all these doesn't announce the choice of kernel. So, how does
one choose the right kernel?

* A sound can be played after gdm loads? Otherwise, they wouldn't know
if the system booted to gdm or not. If there are multiple user
accounts, some application need to spell-out the login names?

* By default there is no shutdown sound in Fedora 11? How to set one?

* Some applications pop-up menus didn't support tab feature, so one
had to remember to use shortcuts like Alt+S to Save, or Alt+C to
Cancel.

I shall check these requests with the Orca project team, and any other
queries that they might have as follow-ups.

I would like to thank Padma Shri Dr. A. Saibaba Goud for giving me an
opportunity to deploy the solution at their school. Thanks to Rakesh
("arky") Ambati for introducing me to them, who also works for
'Braille Without Borders' [3]. Eric Ofori from South Africa will be
following it up with support for the school staff (about 40 in
number). If anyone who is coming to Hyderabad and who would like to
help them, please do contact me offline.

With all due respect to the physically challenged, I did not take any photos.

Hi all ,

>What is the software used for the time series analysis?

Hans Rosling a researcher working on statistics , this a web based
tool , visit gapminder.org for more information on the tool .

Some of his presentations on TED have been really fascinating . I
guess the tool mainly uses flash for more of its operations .  Google
acquired the TrendAnalyser software and made it available as
Motionchart gadget .

Not sure if any FOSS tool exists exactly like this .

Hi,

Yesterday ie., 12 Spetember 2009 from 11:30 to 13:30 HRS IST, I
conducted "Python Programming Workshop" in SRM University as a part of
"Aaruush'09" (http://www.aaruush.net/). I explained basics of python
programming language and the advantages of using python over other
languages, with some code demo.

We had audience from various colleges in and around Chennai. The
session was interactive and I enjoyed a lot with the questions from
the audience.

Thanks to Srinivasan T and Ravi Jaya who gave me an opportunity to
conduct this workshop. My sincere thanks to Manipal lug where I got
some content for my presentation.

But I have a few suggestions

1) State that a list can also mix various datatypes. After a few
months using Haskell,
it took me time to understand how a = [2, 'Hello',(1,2)] was valid

2) Add a line about unicode support in the slide about strings

3) Lastly, can you add a slide about where to proceed from now. eg.
Dive into Python
or PyPi.

Overall, Brilliant :)

You can even suggest an MS Outlook alternative. The latest KDE email client runs on QT4 and hence on windows. 

Whichever solution you choose, try and do this the incremental way.
 - migrate them slowly - first only 10% of users, then 15%(of total users), then 25%, 25%, 25%. This will mitigate the learning and support backlash. There will be considerable support issues involved - best to do it slowly rather than a big bang approach.
Also the later groups will have support from the groups migrated earlier - will create a informal knowledgebase reducing pressure on IT Helpdesk.

TekPro just got back, MSI Wind 10.1" netbook comes with Linux for
Rs 17,500 in Chennai.  Some of the MSI Wind models have the current
performance crown in the netbook category, I think theregister.co.uk
did a review a few weeks ago and is worth a look.

EduBOSS is yet to be released. It contains a subset of applications which
are also found in Debian / EdUbuntu, but also has other applications --
taken from Sourceforge, etc. -- which have been bundled together.  So far,
the emphasis has been on applications of relevance upto 8th standard or so
in our (state baord / cbse etc.) curriculum.

The BOSS and NRCFOSS portals are being revamped -- and EduBOSS (in its
current state) will be ported for study/enhancement/comment by interested
members.
[For instance, "Oscar" developed at IIT Mumbai is very useful for school
children -- but some work need to be done to make it work on BOSS platform.
It could, as a followup or in an independent manner, could also be ported to
run on other distro].

Hi !

It will be nice if NRCFOSS gives a handsome donation to ILUGC since
ILUGC members are selflessly putting so much work. NRCFOSS being a big
government organization should be able to do that. It will be every
motivating and rewarding for ILUGC for taking such initiatives.
After all any such events fares do cost lot of money.

I don't speak for NRC-FOSS, but still, I find that a little ridiculous - 
there's no legal entity called ILUGC - so even if one does want to, 
there's nothing to donate to. If you're talking about compensating 
individual members, I'm sure none of them expect anything of that sort. 
And the last I know, even NRC-FOSS has budget constraints, and just 
because it's a government organization it doesn't mean it can do 
whatever it wants with the allotted funds. And things like distributing 
money just spoils the spirit for everybody. -1, my friend.

Vamsee.

This is Thyagu's personal comment. Everyone in ILUGC will be having
some personal likes and dislikes. But that should NOT affect the
ILUGC activities.

Aim of the SFD is to showcase the FOSS to the people. In that angle,
I don't see any issue in NRC-FOSS stalls. So it will be a part of
the SFD.

Bye :)

Hi !

It was just a suggestion not a demand ! I was under the impression
that LUGC operated by donation from members.
I may be wrong . I definitely not mean compensating individuals.There
was no offense meant to anybody.

just to clarify, in it's second stage NRC-FOSS has 7 branches - AU-KBC at MIT, 
IITM, IITB, IIIT hyderabad and 3 CDAC wings. The stall proposed here is the 
NRC-FOSS, CDAC Chennai wing.

What on earth are you trying to do?

Compile Sun studio compiler to create linux executable on x86?

What on earth for? Unless you are on Sun Solaris running on Sparc or
x86(unlikely) you do not want to use Sun Workshop compiler toolchain.

You also seem to be mixing Sun compiler and gcc.

I normally like to focus on getting useful work done instead of bothering
with toolchains and stuff.

What are you trying to do? You want to compile and run code? Run a
native compiler/toolchain.

Cross compilation works only in NetBSD world and embedded systems but
it has its own problems.

I have also cross compiled on linux for a recent project but that is for an
embedded target when the target does not have convenience to compile
natively.

How is this a big plus ?  Toyota cars are frowned upon in the Ford 
employee parking lot for a reason.

I have nothing personal against Yahoo! or the OP but the job ad is a riot.
It misspells 'phyton', uses a lot of '...', uses vague terms like "LINUX 
based network etc". It also addresses this group as "lugges" instead of 
"luggies".

What reason is that?

I'd say it is a big plus since it means managers aren't poking their
collective nose into how you are doing your work, less interference in
one area might suggest the same in others.  It also shows they're
secure in who they are, and don't feel that forcing false, lets call
it "team spririt", is required.  The fact that employees can go again
the "team spirit" of the last sentence, shows tolerance and an open
culture.  Of course I didn't think all this back then, what I did
think was "it's cool that Yahoo employees are not barred from using
Gmail."

There are other expenses than just compensating volunteers. 
Lack of our legal entity need not prevent them from giving publicity in media, which on our own we cannot do. It need not be an ad, just a press realease/press meet will go a long way.

Reply-To: titus@idyll.org

Hi folks,

the Google Highly Open Participation contest ('GHOP') is going to run
again this year, assuming they can get some help with the Melange app.
It will run in December starting ~Dec 7th, and closer to Dec I will buzz
this list again with some suggestions and thoughts on how to make GHOP
work well for the PSF and Python.

(Note that this should be a great opportunity for the diversity list
folk to both lead by example AND to encourage young underrepresented
students to get involved with Python, hint.)

---

If you're not familiar with GHOP, it is a contest framework that lets
Google pay students for doing small units of work (coding, testing, doc
writing, etc.) on a wide variety of projects.  It was a success for the
PSFlast time,

  http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8/

in that tons of doc changes and test fixes got committed to core, many
other projects benefitted, and most of the people involved had a pretty
good time.

However, BEFORE GHOP CAN RUN AGAIN, we (Google + GHOP enthusiasts) need
help with the Melange application.  It's a bit clunky, it hasn't been
used for GHOP before, and it needs some development and a lot of
testing.  Since it's written in Python/Django, and I happen to know
there are a lot of good testing tools available for both Python and
Django, I hope the Python community can help out.

What can I do?

That is a very lame job post with just tags without proper subject, "a

Any idea what damage you are creating for people who are looking for
jobs/interested in moving to Yahoo etc? And I believe he is a senior
recruiter there in the HR team and works more on "Talent acquisition"
than criticising emails. If you want to get a job, apply. If you have
one (or) self-employed just press the "delete" button and move on.
Don't chase away potential job posters with such mails and be a
hinderance to folks looking out to move on with new job / change.

It is because it has potential to hurt the employer and undermine the 
team. People go, "Hey look, the assembly line chief at Ford is driving a 
Corolla to work". Again, pay attention to nuance. They are not banned, 
they are merely frowned upon.

Encouraging people to dog food their own products is not false team 
spirit. It is a crucial component of product engineering and small but 
important demonstration of confidence and pride in your products.

I apologize if it came across that way.   Especially to the OP.

How was my observation a hindrance to job seekers ? I never cast any 
aspersions on the job, company, or the poster. I am sure they are some 
of the finest jobs available at the moment. I only commented on a 
specific job ad that I received in my inbox. Is it that bad ?

Again apologies to the OP. Folks looking for a job, please do not let my 
observations be a hindrance.

Lets bury this thread.

-1 on trying to shout-down perfectly valid observations. Vivek was well within 
his rights and mailing list etiquette to point out what he felt was funny, 
ironic and plain disrespectful to this community, in his opinion.

If the OP as a 'senior' HR person does not care to present his company in the 
right light as a intelligent 'talent acquisition' personnel than it is more than 
beneficial to have someone criticize his method ...further more, I for one, see 
absolutely nothing wrong with this negatively impacting the possibility of 
Yahoo, 'acquiring talent'.

gah ! ...for double standards, from tolerating empty subject lines just because 
the poster is not a n00b, to this rap on the knuckles.

cheers,
- steve

I would recommend:

Step #1 - Read up about Application Binary Interface (ABI) and understand
Step #2 - Identify and read up on the relevant ABI for you (I suppose that
would be: Intel Binary Compatibility Standard)
Step #3 - Find out if the version of GCC you are interested in produces
object code fully compliant with the relevant ABI
Step #4 - Repeat #2 for the version of Sun compiler in question
Step #5 - Analyse

Have fun.

Hi !
I see a job postings link in ILUGC web site.
Simply posting there saves all the trouble !

May be mention that a job has been posted just to bring attention of
all people and give the link

on the contrary kg's post was more like a word of mouth which IMHO is
much better than long boring
job description written by someone who might not really know what he
writes. anyone attracted by the keyword
django and interested enough to apply will find a way to find more
information about the opening.

also do you rely on the description of the recruiting company on the
job description? any serious taker will do his own research.

I am assuming that you are referring to the thread I started where I
didn't put in a subject line. A poster pointed out my error an I
apologized! do you want me to walk on my knees, roll on the ground,

Day by day, the no of USELESS discussion/fight is increasing in our
list.  This may leads to problem faced by few other ILUG (divide and
disappear). And I am getting person mails from our members to stop
this non-sense.

So I decided that, if anyone start the useless discussions or flame
wars or personal attacks, then (s)he will be kicked out of the list.
If you want to fight with/criticize anybody, Plz do it off-line.

Thanks,

True - if we want to avoid the whole rigmarole of setting up a legal 
entity, I believe raising funds for a specific purpose is ideal - that 
way, people can contribute to events which are truly helpful in their 
opinion, provided the members who are directly involved with organizing 
the event (and are requesting for funds) give an outlay of proposed 
expenses. This gives the all of the members to suggest alternatives if 
something seems too expensive (for e.g: I'm not so sure about press 
meets, but I'd gladly contribute for posters and other material).

Of course, I guess the contributors will also expect a run-down of 
actual money spent, and who is handling the leftover monies. If we can 
take care of these things, I think raising money for specific events 
should not be a big issue.

Vamsee.

I believe the intention is good, but a mailing list is a mailing list. 
Let people make the decision to stay put or go away. If they find it 
unbearable, there are other places to find technical advice. I believe 
you or me cannot make the decision to exclude anybody else, on what we 
personally think is right or wrong. It's a slippery slope, and will 
cause all sorts of heartburn for people.

The discussions get sometimes passionate because people _care_ about an 
issue. Yes, they sometimes get out of hand, but it is the outcome of 
some debates. If somebody is being irrational, I'm sure the community 
will reprimand him. Kicking out spammers is one matter, but kicking out 
people because they expressed opinions is an entirely different matter. 
The whole question of "how much is too much" will itself cause plenty of 
useless discussions.

Vamsee.

Message-ID: <47d9fe5c0909150739g43fabbdds510bf5d614708221@mail.gmail.com>

I see this ad for Samsung notebooks in The Hindu everyday, and it
gives the configuration of the notebook and then says: Pay Rs. 4000
EXTRA and get Windows Vista. This is a good start, and I very much
hope more vendors follow suit. For many here, 4000 is a large amount
(more than 10% of the notebook price in most cases. Mine cost
32500.)and it might just tilt the playing field making it more level
than before.

P.S. I got a Samsung R 418 notebook a fortnight back with no OS and it
runs Fedora 11 as smooth as an apple.

Someone else also had a similar idea. Check this out

In so many ways this may be the perfect netbook. Wonder why it does
not have more publicity?

There is no problem with technical discussion and differences on such issues.  But off late we see lot of useless discussions generating heat.
They put off newbies. As a result the LUG suffers a lot.

Compare the response for volunteering we got in  2004 with 2009. Till date nobody volunteered for several topics. That is a shame on us. One of the main cause is too much of noise resulting in students running away. I tell this based on personal experiences while interacting with students.

My request, please confine discussion to technical and organizational matters only.

Yes . Still working on it and in development stage. You will see it

Sun studio's compiler's output does not play well with gcc's linker. I
have tried this quite sometime ago and even though you seem to get
some output, it dumps a few kgs of core on you.
However, it is always worth the shot. Do post back if it worked.

I find of late I am wasting a lot of time in useless discussion. But one man's 
signal is another man's noise. What is useless for me may be useful for you. 
At the same time we have the option to ignore posts of 'noise-makers' - I have 
started filtering out such people on all the lists I belong to. Since their 
posts now go to trash, I do not get annoyed by reading them and they do not 
get annoyed by my replies. Life has suddenly become more peaceful!

I have a fetish for Samsung products. Obviously I am prejudiced by my
 experience.

If what you say is true then I know what to buy now. I will take a look and
decide later when I have the means to go in for the purchase.

I find that Samsung takes good care of the looks aspect which I rate highly
in a desirable purchase. And their support is also very good.

Moreover Samsung has a big focus in India which is important for all of us.

Many thanks for this information.

I agree with Prashanth, this is indeed a lame posting.

It is as bad a posting as this: "Hey I have a problem in Ubuntu Audio,
interested people please connect with me"

This is special interest mailing list, not a list for desperate job seekers.
I assume the company "needs" good resource, so they are obliged to give
proper details.

@Kenneth, if it is not your company and you are just playing a good
samaritan (postman), even then you can't afford to get away with pathetic
posting and top it with useless arrogance.

Members have right to question posting and decent reply would be a proper
explanation and certainly not "then do not Apply"

If anybody is still not convinced and don't care for mailing list
etiquette...imagine series of following emails.

"A friend of mine is looking for friendly linux people, connect with me
offline"
"A new company is looking for fresh talent in PHP, connect with me offline"
"A very old company is looking for old(experienced) Ruby on Rails people,
connect with me offline"
"A secret company is looking for expert who has expert level skill in
Linux,PHP, Phython and Lisp, interested people connect with me offline in
secret manner"

Friends.

Need a your suggestions on web based project management software.

We need to following features.

1. Many projects should be handled
2. People management
3. Budget per project
4. Expenses per project
5. Material management
6. Time tracking

I am exploring dotproject. it is nice but lacks in material and
finance management.

Any other software which has all above?

Thanks for the suggestions.

I have rephrased your need below.
1. Multiple project (Many projects should be handled)
2. Resource Management (People & Material management)
3. Earned Value Management (EVM) (Budget & Expense)
4. Schedule & Tracking (Time tracking)

There are very good closed source packages like @Work, etc. However  in
IT industry  the norm is to use M$P.

The below are some good open source tools

On Windoze...
1. Openworkbench (works with wine but need to install windows version of
Java under wine) http://openworkbench.org
2. Planner the very tool under Gnome (they don't have EVM implemented yet)

Platform independent.
1. OpenProj - http://www.openproj.org/openproj (Can read M$P file)

Web based check this out
http://www.dreamcss.com/2009/08/11-open-source-project-management-tools.html

I would recommend either Openworkbench / OpenProj depending on if you
need to read M$P file.

No way. Hence the need for backup tools. I used to take backups but
even I am slacking now.

There are methods to do it using file system mechanics but they are not
 reliable.

Only way to guard against accidental deletions is to use automated backup
software. Interestingly I never run into this problem though I use UNIX all
day.

Depends on what you deleted. Could you be a bit more specific ? If you messed up 
your system by doing something silly like rm -rf {/bin,/sbin,/lib...}, then yes 
the system can be restored back to a sane state (probably), but if you did 
something downright crazy like rm -rf ~ ...chances are low that you'd get back 
all that was deleted. That said, there still is hope, google for "ext3 or ext2 
undelete" (assuming that the filesystem was one of those).

Subject: [Ilugc] query about virus attack on UNIX / LINUX environment
Message-ID: <822888.90154.qm@web53609.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

Is there any concept of virus attack on UNIX / LINUX environment.

Or, if UNIX / LINUX is robust enough that it cannot be attacked by virus, then what is the underlying framework (or technicalities of LINUX) that makes it robust.

Because, usually I see windows machines r easily attacked by viruses.

Is it a good idea to consider installing UNIX / LINUX if they r robust for virus attacks in comparison to windows machines ?.

Pls treat this query both from a layman user point of view & at the technical level, and provide practically usefull recommendations.

Thanks,
Selvakumar

Hi,

Some thoughts below:

Openness.

1. One always uses F/OSS software from their respective project
websites or from distros that ship them. So, they have source
credibility. You can always query them if you have a problem.

2. You always install software from credible sources. If you install
binary software on your own from third-party, then it your
responsibility. Don't blame the system.

3. You cannot expect malicious, binary to be included in a F/OSS
project, because, people expect to see the source code. If you did
provide malicious source code, it will be rejected, obviously, and you
will lose credibility, which nobody wants.

4. If there is a compromise on a F/OSS software, and thus it behaves
different from what the source is entitled to do, then patches will be
provided to fix the same.

It is like a double-edged sword. If you speak the truth, you have
nothing to hide.

You could have put a full-stop after 'robust' and finished the sentence.

Both these softwares are pretty good. They do read MSP files. However,
in OpenProj, I found that the project timelines were changed/
different as compared to MSP. Have done this check more than once. As
standalones, they worked well.

yes - you can give fine grained rights in SVN - even checkout rights to only 
one file - depending on the auth system you are using check the relevant pages

I fully agree that a lot of discussion on this list is pretty much
useless. Now the latest thing going around on ilugc is this - people have
taken it upon themselves to teach job posters how to post job offers. It
is not sufficient that they put [job] or whatever in the subject, but now
they must also word their posts very carefully, recite the correct
incantation in the right order and so on.

But as far as lively debates go, I think that is fine. That is one of the
reasons people view a mailing list in anycase. It adds some drama to an
otherwise staid list.

Prem

Hmm, that is indeed strange. How /exactly/ did you delete the folders ? Did you 
do this through the UI ? (which is likely, since you see the entries in 
.local/share/Trash/files). If you did, and then did not 'Empty Trash' or 'Delete 
Permanently', then the files should not be deleted.

Could you please give some more details, if possible ? For instance, the output 
of running the following command from a command line terminal:

$ ls -la ~/.local/share/Trash/files

cheers,
- steve

You have posted this into ILUGC,well this might be bit irrelevant

questions.

Also,i have found many opensource  projects from Google,then why not this ?

Hi,

>From what I have seen, most of the netbooks that came pre-loaded with
GNU/Linux or with no OS didn't have the latest hardware configuration,
or were not customizable. Please let me know if you find one.

1. You, I, and everyone knows that distributions with the Linux kernel
will run on the latest hardware configuration. So, given a choice
between a low-end, non-customizable hardware, and a proprietary system
with high-end hardware, with lot of money being invested by the
individual, people will prefer to buy the high-end hardware.

2. Even if the hardware OEMs really wanted to support the F/OSS folks,
and decide to level the playing field, they could sell the highest
hardware configuration, with

  A. proprietary OS, and
  B. without any OS or with some F/OSS distribution.

Technically speaking, version (B) should be priced much lower because
there is no OS, and you don't pay for other desktop software. People
will definitely prefer to buy (B), and install whichever OS they want,
especially in countries where software piracy is common. But, since
this doesn't guarantee the proprietary OS vendor of his share of
market, he will not allow (2) to happen.

Would it really be the case? From what I am aware, most manufacturers
will load the Windows machines with trial software from *reputed*
vendors, which lowers the cost of the machine setting back some of the
higher cost. So, now the machine isn't priced too high as compared to
the Linux/DOS offering. Thus, making it more lucrative for most
consumers as the price difference is low and they have a legal copy of
their familiar OS.

I am curious. What DOS does it ship with? MS-DOS or FreeDOS? From the
offerings I have seen around, there are laptops which ship with
FreeDOS.
FreeDOS is a FOSS software available under GPL.
Here's the description of the project as on sf.net

"FreeDOS is a free DOS-compatible operating system for IBM-PC
compatible systems. FreeDOS is made of up many different, separate
programs that act as packages to the overall FreeDOS Project. FreeDOS
is distributed under the GNU GPL."

If so, should one be against buying a machine preloaded with FreeDOS subject to:
1) All of the hardware works with recent GNU/Linux distributions,
either out of the box or with some minor tweaks
2) Hardware warranty is not voided on installing GNU/Linux(which I
highly doubt would be a problem with a machine which has FreeDOS
preinstalled).

Looking forward to hearing from people who have bought laptops with
DOS preinstalled.

Price difference is only one aspect. But, is that the case with all
the models (including the high-end hardware configuration)? This
didn't happen with notebooks, either. Please do let me know if you
find all models from a vendor without any OS. BIOS is good for doing
hardware tests.

Unfortunately most end users think that actual cost of laptop hardware
is what the vendor is selling (adding windows cost)
Hence these hardware vendors and M$ were happily selling OEM's on
laptops in India. But netbooks could potentially cause/is
already(eeepc + xandros) causing damage to windows OEM sales.

 Vista hasn't been sold well hence M$ is pitching hopes on future
Windows 7 sales if almost 1/2 market would have been occupied ( if
linux bundled netbooks were allowed to sell) M$ never could sell
future windows 7 atleast to 25 % of its customers .

 No I am not just speculating . Just go have a chat with windows
netbook users you will find what kind of hole M$ has stuck in LOL (not
one but many people removing default xp and going to ubuntu netbook
remix)

Anyways chrome os hopefully could get some nice drivers into the
kernel with google pushing the hardware vendors ... the future is
bright :)

This may be the case for machines that cost 30K and more. Most of
this trial software is games etc. that are not very likely to be
activated by those who buy netbooks.

When the MRP of netbooks _could_ have dropped to about 15K or even
less (for example, see the Norhtec page referred to earlier), the
manufacturers have added "features" to raise the price to the 25K-30K
range. One of these features is the inclusion of Win XP which by all
accounts they are getting from MS at about $20 or less.

Now, all of these taken individually seem like common business
practices:
 1. Not selling ultra-cheap goods. (OEM's)
 2. Adding features to raise prices and margins. (OEM's)
 3. Under-pricing a value addition so that it can be bundled. (MS)

However, put it all together and it feels a monopolistic trade
practice designed to keep competing products out. At the same time
there is a business opportunity for someone to come in and sell
significantly cheaper computers exactly as Asus did about two years
ago.

Regards,

Kapil.

Hi !

You are very right. The netbook landscape is going to change
drastically. There is also a whole new generation of netbooks ,
smart-books etc which do not ( or can not)  run windows software and
are  based on non- x86 processors like ARM ,MIPS and Snapdragon etc.
Also  mobile phones , MIDS ( Mobile Internet Devices) and netbooks are
clamoring for this market place giving users wider choices depending
on what their intended purpose is.

So be assured that sub 10k netbooks and ultra low cost netbooks
bundled with data plans are going to hit Indian market very soon !

Cheers

dos2unix -- DOS/MAC to UNIX text file format converter.

Summary:

Each OS will indicate the line end differently using Line Feed (LF,10)  
or Carriage Return (CR,13). So when tranfering a file from DOS to
Unix, you have to convert the Line end from DOS format to Unix format.

dos2unix will convert the DOS/MAC Text file to Unix format. Unix or
Linux uses LF as line end, Windows/DOS uses CR/LF and MacOS uses CR.

Examples:
[code]
$ dos2unix dos.txt -- Convert and replace dos.txt.

$ dos2unix -n dos.txt gnu.txt -- Convert dos.txt and 
  write into gnu.txt

$ dos2unix -k dos.txt -- Convert and replace a.txt while 
  keeping original date stamp.
[/code]

It chainloads to the grub of F11 which is on MBR of that disk?

Check your grub menu file. What you are seeing is the label given in
the file. That entry might be pointing to the wrong partition to boot.

What does fdisk /dev/sda and fdisk /dev/sdb show?

Anyway you need to chainload for Windows.

Have these two lines in grub.conf. I think it is called menu.lst nowadays.

chainloader +1

I have attached a sample that is well commented.

You have to map the grub's idea of hdn to /dev/sd*. Focus on lines
 59 to 66 of attachment.

Nice. I hope more such mistakes happen.

I love the command jot.

Read the man page here:

http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/jot/

Very useful for generating a sequence of numbers. The way to do in
perl/python is 1..50 to generate integers between 1 and 50.

In the shell do this.

$ jot 50 1 50

There are worms on UNIX. Cisco routers are known for attacks long ago
that brought LANs down.

Google for Mellissa , ILOVEU and many other worm attacks.

People often get confused  between worms and viruses.

In the Windoze world normally worms infect your computer to send mails
using your addressbook contacts and send spam using SMTP.

Such things can never happen on UNIX.

But illegitimate traffic and denial of service attacks are possible.

In general till date we have hardly seen any worm on UNIX. Though the
first worm by Robert Tappan Morris was using the finger program on
UNIX. ;)

> Or, if UNIX / LINUX is robust enough that it cannot be attacked by virus, then what is the underlying framework (or technicalities of LINUX) that makes it robust.

Very long winded answer is necessary here. Don't have time.

In short, the motivation for virus writers is less since they cannot spread
as quickly as Windows viruses.

Moreover Linux world is fragmented. It is hard to find a uniformly installed
software that can be used for propagation.

Apache attacks are common, SQL injection attacks do happen and there
are many attacks that happen on servers. Since nearly all servers run
UNIX, there are vulnerabilities.

But separation between processes and checks and balances in design and
programming help us.

> Because, usually I see windows machines r easily attacked by viruses.
>

There are far more Windows users on earth than Linux/UNIX users.

This fact will never change.

> Is it a good idea to consider installing UNIX / LINUX if they r robust for virus attacks in comparison to windows machines ?.

If you ask in Linux User's Group then I wonder what answer you expect.

He  needs access to the addressbook. We have no such concept.

And he needs open relay and an easy way to send e-mails.

I am not saying that it is not possible, but highly unlikely.

The main problem for a virus writer assuming it is myself is to find out
 the least common denominator of all Linux users.

That is very hard. Whereas Windows is a homogeneous world.

An alternative for "bash" users is
 echo {1..20}
This can be taken further with things like
 echo file{1..20..2}

And so on.

Look at the section on "Brace Expansion" in the "bash" man page for
more information.

Hi,

nice to know that you are interested in graphics.

But, we need more information to help you.

what do you want with graphics?
are you a student?
interested in graphics programming?

or
just a user expecting to configure awsome graphics in your desktop?

Can you expatiate it technically and why Win doesnt plug it? What is the
fundamental premise which makes Linux/Unix not-virus-friendly?

Friends.

Is it possible to anyone to record the talks and stalls on SFD?

We can archive and circulate the videos among budding lugs and
interested people.

Thanks.

and on your pod cast server too - what happened to that? Incidentally related

Virus writers will not bother about LDAP or some other format used by
certain people. They want Outlook addressbook which has a uniform
format.

Anyway I am getting out of my premise here. Though I do know certain
aspects of Windows I am really not good at it. So I will stop here.

That is different technology. Using botnets for sending spam.

Virus writers do that with Windows machines and possibly linux open
relays. But the end machines are never linux. So you are right.

I am right too.

Though I am a cryptographer I do not use secure practices in my life. I
have never got affected. I have a free attitude towards life and it
percolates into my computing practices also.

Linux is prone to attacks as you testify, but not virus attacks. Usually the
harm is restricted to your server or your service. You don't launch a network
wide denial of service attacks with a bunch of linux zombies.

Windows can be easily taught to work like a bunch of zombies in concert
and form a spammer botnet. Such things can't be done with Linux.

Ok I am wasting enough time already. Sorry have lot of work.

If you have further questions please take it offline.

Shrini,

Why don't you record using screencast software?

ffmpeg?

Why trouble people over this?

Do you really want to see people presenting?

Just record the audio with a mic or cellphone and get the screencast of
ppt presentations and demos.

I know it will be somewhat messy but I am suggesting alternatives if not
a solution.

Best of luck.

This is the last question I will answer today.

Why Windows doesn't plug it? I am not the right person to answer that.

Microsoft couldn't care less.

I can however tackle your other question.

What makes UNIX unfriendly towards virus writers?

I have already covered a lot of the easy stuff in my mails sent today.

Since you are asking a pointed question I will get a bit more technical.

I know of the cryptographic and other practices employed in the most
secure OS on earth, OpenBSD. Some of these ideas are used in other
UNICes and Linux as well.

Cryptography requires randomness in everything. Crypto alone cannot
solve security problems. You need other protection mechanisms and
checks and balances.

Stuff like stack protection, chroot jails, privilege separation, privilege
 dropping and many many other things found only in OpenBSD.

You can read some of Theo's papers at

http://www.openbsd.org/papers

I had read them for the ILUGC seminar.

Now Linux and other UNICes have implemented some of the C buffer overflow
problems by randomizing mallocs. You need to randomize every form of ID
generation, be it TCP sequence numbers or DNS query IDs,

OpenBSD has been doing this for ages.

And you need a sound real random generator. We only find pseudo random
numbers in the computer world. Peudo random sequences have the entropy
of random numbers they are predictable and given a seed you have a fixed
stream.

Random sources include hard disk accesses, network loads, keypresses,
mouse movements and so on.

And most importancely UNIX with its sound design and KISS principle makes
it all the more harder for virus writers.

But Windows is full of vulnerabilities of various kinds. Blob programs with
different trapdoors and weaknesses abound.

That is it guys. I am tired. Sigh.

This question and the question by the OP are both 'bad' questions. They are bad 
because, both make very generalized assertions and then ask 'technical' 
explanations for those assertions.

To intelligently ask ...
 > Is there any concept of virus attack on UNIX / LINUX environment.

One should know what at computer virus is:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus

IMHO, in an abstact perverse and biased point of view windows itself is a 
computer virus. :)

Now about ...
 > I hear that Windows has a backdoor hole which is a cause of all the

 > Can you expatiate it technically and why Win doesnt plug it?
Well, if you 'heard' something from someplace, it is always better to verify 
whether what you 'heard' is true, before assuming it is and asking why M$ has 
nothing is done about it !

A backdoor is ...
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_%28computing%29
...and there is nothing 'windows' specific about it. A backdoor may exist in any 
software, including operating systems.

It is simple. M$ has created a ecosystem around its windozzz...
Organizations like Mac-coffee, Cymentec survive on the ecosystem. If M$

M$ gets the max of the market pie and the rest get what M$ wouldn;t care

I am not sure if you would be directly venturing into developing for
openGL, I am assuming that you will be using openGL to develop graphic
applications for GNU/Linux.

So the starting place would be to learn about the Graphic system in
GNU/Linux  works and what are the projects working on it. Here is a
page[1] which does that .

Next a basic overview of OpenGL is must and is provided by the
wikipedia page [2] and afterwards you can read the specification to
have a deep understanding of OpenGL .
I think the specification would be more than enough to get you started
. If you felt that OpenGL misses some features , you can then hack the
code of OpenGL and start contributing code to it :)

Links :

1. http://jonsmirl.googlepages.com/graphics.html
2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opengl
3. http://www.opengl.org/documentation/current_version/

Would love to see some 3 D ( or atleast 2D ) apps coming from you :D

Regards,
Pavithran

Learn to read first.

Did I mention that having developed a ecosystem is wrong. I just
answered the question that there is a ecosystem and M$ will not trouble
it...

Thanks for the interest.

We need a volunteer with a nice handy-cam or digital video cam to
record the talks and events.

Then, we can edit the videos and upload to any site or circulate in DVDs.

Anyone willing to volunteer for this?

Thanks.

Hello,

I will take a different fork here from what Girish said and add
that programs alone cannot ensure security for a computer system. A
good system _encourages_ good security practices. Some examples of
such practices that are the _default_ on most *nix like systems.

 1. Ensuring that people do not use the administrator account
 for day-to-day work.
 2. Providing means to check that software is downloaded from reliable
 sources.
 3. Providing enough software from reliable sources at low cost so
 that people are not encouraged to depend on unreliable sources.
 4. Clearly demarcating system areas from user areas so that users
 can ensure the integrity of these areas _independently_.
 5. Using privilege separation to limit access to files,
 executables and devices.
 6. Providing a path by which users can learn more about their system
 in order to improve their security through better understanding.
 7. Educating the user through (a) clear notifications when they attempt
 something potentially risky and (b) explicit documentation of the
 vulnerable aspects of their system.

I am sure I have missed some, but you probably get the idea. The point
is that most of these practices are _less_ convenient on Windows than
they are on a generic *nix. Security is always fighting with
convenience so reducing the inconvenience of secure operations is
always important.

Effectively, Windows systems encourage their users to use them in a
manner which is not secure![*]

Regards,

Kapil.

[*] One of my biggests fear is that modern "easy-to-use"
Desktop versions of GNU/Linux will copy this unfortunate
"ease-of-use-wins-over-security" attitude of Windows.

This is exactly the kind of interaction we don't want here. Please, 
gentlemen. I request you to maintain the dignity of the forum and not 
launch or react to personal attacks. Either take enough effort to 
explain your point fully (if you care about your opinion) or refrain 
from doing so.

Vamsee.

Now that was ad-hominum. Freedon is great but your freedom to swing
your fist stops when it reaches my nose.

We don't want a flame fest here hence I will desist. BTW where is the
cave you come from located?

Please limit your comments to technical issues henceforth.

There is a lot of scope for improvement of focus (no more off-topic
sh**), grammar, spelling, mailing etiquette, general etiquette and
sanity.

He is a known spammer, comes around in IRC as well on a few channels
and starts flooding. Atleast I was the one who banned him for good in
Ubuntu India channel and saw him run havoc in kde-in channel I guess.

A request to admin to ban him from posting to ILUGC.

We can manage recording with existing volunteers. We need only handy-cam.
If someone can lend that will be great.

Message-ID: <7938ae610909171712u55a7ecf8wd59b065e5d0128e8@mail.gmail.com>

I am going to send a command a day like Bharathi used to do.

But I have very little time and life is not in my hands.

So I will go away one day as mysteriously as I come.

So please don't mistake me when that happens. Here we go.

Everyone knows that cat command.

$ cat /etc/passwd

will print the file to console.

Now you can get line numbers into a file like this.

$ cat -n /etc/passwd > /tmp/passwd-with-lineno.txt

This is a very powerful usage of this command.

You can always view line numbers in vim/vi or emacs but sometimes you
want that in the file itself.

Then you have the tac command.

It prints the file in reverse.

$ tac /etc/passwd

please do not set a precedent of banning him - just add his name to your spam

This is a basic error. I know that most people ask only basic questions in
LUG.

Crypto coding is not for beginners.

But all of us have to begin somewhere. ;)

Anyway you have to use the latest greatest version of OpenSSL.

This call OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms() was known by some other
 name before. Hence you are getting this error.

I have suggested  a solution. In case you are adamant that you want to
know the name of the old function then I wish that you find it out
yourself.

Let there be some suspense.

Seriously - Nishant, I don't know what got into you to take off on a

happened to you for you to to harbour such hatred towards Tamils. But
whatever be the reason, let me say this to you.

This one message will be enough to indicate to them that you are totally

That should affect their appraisal of your employability. I hope you are
happy.

I speak as an employer myself.

Hi

I run Ubuntu Jaunty on my Thinkpad R61. I Have the following graphics card

$ lspci | grep VGA
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile GM965/GL960
Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 0c)

I want to run Counterstrike through Wine, but it fails as the
driver(xserver-xorg-video-intel)  does not support OpenGL fully.I am able to
run in only in software graphics mode, and not in OpenGL.In my older laptop,
with Nvidia graphics i could run it smoothly but Intel just does not give me
the stuff.

Can anyone help me with this? Because I would not want to waste my time
installing MS Win just for a game or two. :)

Thanks in Advance

When you tell grub to chainload, it does not care about the OS installed
in the partition. It simply transfers control to whatever loader is in the
partition. In your case you hace F11 which gets loaded. The title you give
on grub need not match the actual OS in the hard disk.

Senthil

Hi

Could anyone provide link  for AES XCBC MAC 96 algorithm code in c.
i need to verify in software wether the hardware block's result is same when
given same input .

thanks

I use TP R61. OpenGL support is not good in this Intel Card. I am not
sure, is it related to the driver or device. Try to play with DRI
settings using driconf tool. Try the driver provided by the Intel[1].
I never tried this :)

I think we cannot do better than a google search can.

I know CBC(Cipher Block Chaining) mode. What is XCBC?

A google result shows nothing. Do you want to use AES as a MAC
algorithm that gives a 96 bit output?

Why don't you download the official C implementation from the authors
John Daemen and Vincent Rijmen and invoke this mode?

My google search brought this up. FPGA implementation.

http://www.design-reuse.com/articles/13981/fpga-implementation-of-aes-encryption-and-decryption.html

Here are the OpenBSD sources. Short and simple but I could not find the
mode you are looking for. I think you should be able to make do with it.

thanks girish for prompt response.

this is my understanding as of now, please correct if wrong.
AES XCBC MAC 96 is hashing algorithm to generate MAC using AES in extended CBC
mode.
It generates 128bit MAC but only first 96 bits are stored  in authentictor
field and the same is comapred at the recepient side as AH supports 96 bits
by default.

What kind of conflict is there?
It is not exactly conflict but the page with the http://localhost/index.html of Apache's default page
"It works" is getting dispalyed as one is expected, but the same page with http://192.168.13.121/index.html is spawning unsparsed script.
Please help me once again.

Hi ,

Thanks for u r straight forward answer  , actually we have exiting code which has lot of refs to OPENSSL_add_all_algorithms , and it is showing undefeined reference to OPENSSL_add_all_algorithms.

actaully i need a workaround , yes i am using the lastes version of openssl , but still it is throwing the same error .

in latest version , it is defined as macro  
#define OPENSSL_add_all_algorithms OPENSSL_add_all_algorithms_conf


and code is not taking the macro .


i need any workaround where i can simulate similar fun what OPENSSL_add_all_algorithms does and make the code work and dont disturb the exiting code which has references .

It will be great if u a solution rather than dont use this .

thanks

Hi,

There are R functions for Econometrics (Time Series Analysis). You can
always output the chart as SVG, adding animations to the chart similar
to that produced by Trendalyzer. And then make it as a web service.You
have an FOSS tool exactly like Trendalyzer !

In theory the Intel Graphics Media Deaccelerators have a good unified 
architecture and 3D performance. In practice Intel concentrates mainly 
on media playback rather than 3D gaming. This is true even in under 
Windows where the Intel drivers are much faster.

All games using the GPLed Quake 3 engine will run well, mainly because 
they use the engine for 3d performance testing. Other engines may or may 
not work.

In the OPs case he also has to contend with wine which has its own set 
of problems.

The drivers in the mentioned site are just the ones you get in your 
distribution through X.org. It might probably be somewhat newer that 
what you get with your distribution.

Also Ubuntu Jaunty had a few regressions in performance of Linux drivers 
due to the rewriting of a large part of the X.org graphics stack. If you 
want to use a newer version, you will need to update all packages in the 
graphics stack found in the site. Since it includes a patched kernel and 
X.org libraries, don't try it unless you are well familiar with Linux. 
The new stack will appear in next version of all the distros and you can 
try it then.

Senthil

Existing code? You dunno what it does?

This is the most important function. If this doesn't work your OpenSSL
code is useless. Try to find out what I asked you to find out.

Study the source, google and do some work.

Oh. Then there may be a linking problem. But as I said, this is basic.

You have to solve it. It is not complicated at all.

Read the man pages please. OpenSSL has clearly documented many things.

Well you have to find out. I don't think I should help since you will not
learn that way. Better to spend some 2 days learning than getting a
readymade answer.

Don't you agree?

First thing is don't use version 0.9.6.

So I said use this but get things working.

Best of luck.

Thanks for the initiative.

Yes. If you have enough satisfaction on your mobile camera video,
please do your contribution.

It is more important to record our efforts and publish them to public.
It will reach more people and add interest to them to participate in
future activities.

Subject: [Ilugc] Gnome-Power-Manager does not update battery status
Message-ID: <e6b5008a0909180733n1b7260fem96d41b4f451b75f9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I'm using Arch Linux with GNOME.

I find that Gnome-Power-Manager does not update battery status at all
even several minutes after I remove power supply to my laptop. It says
"laptop battery charged 100%"
On the contrary, acpitool is able to display the battery status as
"discharging" and then displays the percentage charge remaining..

Any insights or help? =)

Hi All,

1. If you any extra Power Extn Box, plz bring it to SFD.

2. Write down the list of items (Cabinet, Monitor, KB, ..) that you 
are taking inside the BP. Mostly Security may not ask for gate pass, 
suppose if they ask, you show this list and get a approval. So that, 
you won't face any issue during the return.

3. Try to assemble at BP by 8:30AM.

4. Lunch and Drinking Water are arranged for the volunteers.

5. You are a **regular** Linux user, familiar with most of the basic
operations and willing to share your knowledge then take your machine
and come to SFD.

6. If you need any help, contact Numbers:
   Bharathi: 98408 79452
   Raman   : 98841 15970

Bye :)

Who charges for FreeDOS anyway? I asked on another forum and one person
there pointed out the Samsung ND10, which is available on ebay.in with 1
year's warranty for Rs. 18000.

Another person there pointed out that you can book the N138 from the
Samsung India website:
<http://www.samsung.com/in/consumer/detail/detail.do?group=informationtechnology&type=notebook&subtype=mininotebook&model_cd=NP-N138-DA01IN#>

Why bother getting a laptop with preloaded Linux. Distros you download
are much better than the weirdly set up stuff they use.

Have to agree , when I bought EEEpc the Xandros didn't allow me to do
anything .. I had to install debian on it. Yeah the default distros
are mostly stupid ones .. except in dell's case which has ubuntu on it
... but how many are *easily* available ?
I heard of also some SLED laptops .

/me wishes for the day when I can walk into any computer store and buy
a debian pre loaded laptop !!

Pavithran

Guys,

If I repeat what Bharathi sent long ago please excuse me. I can't help it.

xargs is often used with the find command like this.

$ find /etc | xargs vi

is a simple way to edit all files under /etc recursively including
directories. This is better.

$ find /etc -type f | xargs vi

You can also remove all .svn or CVS files like this.

$ find . -type d -name CVS | rm -rf

or

$ find . -type d -name .svn | rm -rf

I will send UNIX commands. Not just linux ones.

Have a nice day.

Marketing speak does not work in LUG. Where are the papers?

Technical details?

Nobody in LUG will buy you for your fame or promotional ability. How are
you superior? Any whitepapers? Tutorials? Articles?

that I don't repeat the commands sent by Bharathi.

I found this

http://community.livejournal.com/ilugc/

The page is fantastic and very useful.

Please spread the light of learning.

I have very big plans for India and I want to use Chennai LUG as a
very important channel
for actualizing my dreams.

So give up silly ego fights and idiotic discussions and focus on learning.

To quote Tiruvalluvar,

"Orumaikan than katra kalvi
 Oruvarku Ezhumaiyum Emappu Udaithu."


I know that many of you do not believe in the rebirth theory but the
idea of Tiruvalluvar is
that what one learns stays with us for 7 births.

In fact if you ignore the rebirth theory, then there is really no
motivation for people to
be ethical and moral...but I digress as usual. ;)

So the West is being silly by rejecting this old Hindu idea.

Have a nice day.

Ever yours,
Girish

Dear Tanya,

I am glad for your reply.

I have no time at my disposal to discuss this further but I am glad
that you took my mail with the right attitude.

I appreciate that.

Moreover what piques my interest is the fact that LUG has helped
you get customers. This is fantastic.

So far I have never realized any business thro' LUG. So it is a good
thing.

My experience has been that I benefit in subtle ways by getting
to know the real world complexities through LUG and I get
learning which I can always translate into money.

If you get direct business through LUG it is really great.

Best of luck!

Ever yours,
Girish

Hello Girish,

You are welcome !

I didn't post the original message to get only business from LUG but  
more than that to let know people about our presence using Indian DC  
where there are very few players in the market and offer possibly a  
better choice.

We often have to let know people hosting in India now a days is  
affordable and reliable with better network speed for locals. Its a  
win-win for both Indian hosting needs and for us as well.

Thank you.

I think that many hackers go by the ethics of "Enlightened
Self-Interest".
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_self-interest.

On the other hand one must take care not to become too learned
otherwise one may not be reborn! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhi

Hi

Thanks for the info, I did try out the graphics drivers at the site
intellinuxgraphics. I had to resolve about a 100 dependencies before i could
install the mesa 3D driver, and after i had installed it there was no
appreciable change.
I Hope Intel changes their ways soon!

Cheers!

Do you see just the battery icon or the plugged in icon ?

Possibly a bug in your version on gnome-power-manager (the same or similar bugs 
are/have been reported for g-p-m on a regular basis). What is the g-p-m version 
on your system ? What happens when you restart g-p-m ? I'd suggest filing a bug 
against the arch linux g-p-m package.

Hi,

Anyone here has used Amazon Web Services? Any idea how much it costs per
month to run a simple application which might have about 1000 users (50
concurrent at any given time) and generates about a GB of data per month? I
went through their website. It gives me a headache :-). Would be grateful if
someone can translate it in plain english - like, how much it'll cost per
month at a minimum!!

And how does it compare with slices from Linode or Slicehost?

thanks,
mano

I assume you are looking for details about using Amazon EC2 node with
AWS. The node may run an application that might have 1000 users.

If my assumption is right, here are the details:
Small 1.7gb ram/160gb/32 bit - 0.125 per hour - $90 per month
Large 7gb ram/850gb/64 bit - 0.50 per hour - $360 per month
Extra Large 15gb ram/1690gb/64 bit - $1 per hour - $720 per month

You may create 1 or more virtual nodes depending on the unit type.
I've used the Small node for R&D purposes. It's good and easy to
manage/work remotely. AFAIK, Amazon EC2 does not have good reputation
when it comes to uptime. This setup can be used to run "temporary high
volume parallel data processing", or demonstrating a feature, but not
for permanent production sites.

> And how does it compare with slices from Linode or Slicehost?

I've not used both these services. You may also explore the scope of
using CollabNet Lab Management tool, a cloud based service for
developers in a virtual platform. Developers at Reuters, American
Express, Deutsche Bank use this tool to similar magnitude you are
looking into.

Even after I remove supply, the plugged icon is what I see.

The g-p-m version on my system is 2.26.3 (same version as the GNOME I
use I guess.. =) )
This is the weird part: When I remove supply and restart g-p-m, it
restarts with the plugged icon! =)
I'll file a bug report.. =)

Highly doubt this. My experiences with AWS/S3 has been amazing. I found the
ease of managing instances just a click away. Especially, Firefox has a
plugin which makes it even more easier for n00bs. S3 makes it much more
easier to manage persistent data.

I have cc'ed Balaji(popularly known as labsji) with whom i had a chance to
work on Sim-OnDemand<http://labsji.wordpress.com/2008/11/03/sim-ondemand-opensim-on-ec2-personal-virtual-world-server/>during
its initial stages. I loved my rendezvous on this, and the geeky
adventure was worth it. Please contact him off the list if interested (as i
dont think he is part of this ML)

I haven't used Linode or Slicehost so I cannot comment on them. However,
we have deployed multiple apps on Amazon EC2. You are right - the pricing
system is very complicated.

For the type of usage you are looking at (50 concurrent users), you will
most likely have to go for what is known as High-CPU Medium (c1.medium)
 instance type. That is Amazon speak for the type and nature of the 
machine image instance.  The type of instance determines how much RAM and
CPU is available to your instance.

For your usage, the pricing will be around USD 170 - USD 200/- or so a month.

This is a very rough ballpark figure which takes into account that you
will have just one instance running and that you will use some space
(approx 100 GB) in Amazon S3 for persistent storage. If you are looking at
hosting the database on a separate instance and replicating the database
onto yet another instance and so on, the cost will grow drastically.

Prem

To: network@lists.fosscom.in


Dear fellow FOSS-enthusiasts,

I'm a FOSS lover and Perl hacker working for DeepRoot Linux. I've been
using GNU/Linux for some 8 years now. I'm a strong believer in the
philosophy of FOSS. Being a Perl hacker, I've also contributed a few
modules to CPAN.

Like many of you I've also suffered due to the preferential treatment of
our Income Tax department towards users of MS Excel. Celebrating
Independence day with my colleagues at DeepRoot Linux, we were
discussing about the sad state of affairs and what can be done about it.

We decided that the best way to show what freedom means to us was to go
ahead and migrate the spreadsheets to OpenOffice.org. Nothing would come
in the way, even the fact that it was past the last date for filing
returns. What better message to give the Income Tax department, we
thought, than a show of how much we are will to put on the line for
software freedom.

Today, as we celebrate Software Freedom Day, I'm pleased to announce
that the form 1 is ready for download at http://freedom-matters.in .
There is bug tracking id itr-forms-bugs AT freedom-matters.in for bugs
and feature requests. This has been tested with OOo version 2.4 and 3.0
and 3.1. I encourage all those who wish to try out the spreadsheet to do
so and give your bug reports and feedback.

Have you looked at this?

http://marc.info/?l=mysql&m=103249377620375&w=2

It explains what you need to do:

a) Check to see if you have included  openssl/evp.h header file.

b) If (a) has been checked and it is alright, then the problem could be
that the version of your OpenSSL libraries is wrong.

Hi !

I would like to know the reason behind opting for AWS .  Will not a
dedicated server be more economical , when they are available for very
flexible terms ? I thought you go for AWS when you want to scale
rapidly and painlessly or have high peak demands.

Cheers

Hi !

This post was done as per the guidelines. It was clearly tagged as
[Commercial] with the subject line clearly stating the purpose.

"7. Use [OT] tag for off-topic, non-technical discussions and Use
[Commercial] tag for commercial or job postings."

 I do not see any reason for objection.

 In fact you should object to the second poster who was trying to
start a controversy. And also appreciate the original poster who
politely  de-escalated  the issue instead of making things worse.

My suggestions to avoid this kind of spams is that , all the mails posted to ILUGC mailing list should be published only after it is checked by the Moderator/Admin..
Since ILUGC mailing list is growing everyday, this kind of spams may affect its satndards.

Hi,

On September 19, 2009, Software Freedom Day at Hyderabad:

* I visited Devnar Foundation for the Blind, a follow-up to last
weekends' installation.

Most of their systems have been donated. So, there are different
motherboards, and brands. Apparently, the local AMC support guy who
had come today didn't have drivers for different proprietary OSes, and
for different motherboards. I then migrated their office computers to
Fedora 11 :)

Now, they have HCL, Wipro computers running Fedora. I have disabled
many start-up services, to boot the systems faster. I also adjusted
Orca pitch, rate settings for clarity. It should take them some time
to get accustomed to the American accent.

* Thanks to Prof. Haasan, Department of Astronomy, Osmania University,
I have deployed Fedora 11 repository (29 GB) at one of their
department systems.

They are interested in creating a Fedora Spin for Astronomy, and
release it, as this is the International Year of Astronomy [1]. I have
provided Rahul Sundarams' e-mail contact to them.

Hi all,
       I want to have a daemon which will monitor changes in a directory.
Lets say /home/narendra/Download , Whenever user make a cut copy paste
operation into this directory that daemon will be notified and he will take
some action (like file moving , sorting etc).
      I know bash shell scripting and C++. How can i make this utility.
Small pointers are needed.

Thanks for info. Actually I am working on a very unique idea.

"Freedom directory"  -- We will assign one directory for this purpose. our
daemon will take care for pasting new flies into it. Whenever using put new
files (like 100+ jpg images from his camera), this will automatically
converted to png images in the backend. This will remove a lot of hurdle and
time consuming conversion process for a normal user. How is the idea ;) ??

ap2s - format files for a postscript printer

$ a2ps  --sides=duplex foo.c -o foo.ps

prints two pages on side of the paper on both sides into the file foo.ps

$ a2ps --highlight-level=heavy twisted.py -o twisted.ps

will highlight keywords.

$ a2ps -j ap.txt -o ap.png

will print the text with borders.

Once you are done and are happy with the ps output, send to printer

$ lpr foo.ps

You can see the ps file and quickly know whether you are doing two
side printing. As
it will clearly say how many papers will be involved.

$ gv foo.ps

a2ps is marvelous stuff. It prints C code exceptionally well with
right highlighting, emphasis and
borders.

$ a2ps -1 foo.png -o foo.png

will print 1 page on 1 side of the paper.

It is a bit cryptic but fantastic tool.

Long ago I used this program to create a printout when I went to
Tirunelveli, my native place.

I had created custom headers and the print output was so pretty that
my 80 year old grandfather
was amazed. ;)

Nothing is unique under the sun. I am poking fun. ;)

Neat idea.

If you don't want inotify there are several triggers possible. I have
done it with
kqueue() on FreeBSD long ago. I stopped using FreeBSD years ago.

You have libevent(3) in linux which can do the same thing I believe.

I think normally hotplugd is used when you plug in a USB camera to automount
and react in this manner.

Best of luck.

Tata.

Very cool Shrini.

Why is Bharathi looking worried? Any problem? ;)

The weather was nice and many people attended. But everyone is so

Looks like there was lot of fun.

Got some sample code and now coding. Will revert back after full design.

PS: I think, it is unique in terms to usability point of view. For me it
will be "Freedom Directory" , Put anything init, It will automatically
convert to open standard.

        Freedom Bucket : is a idea coined by me to make a special directory
in Linux based system which will contain on Open Format files like png for
images, ogv , ogg for video and audio.

       Whenever user copy paste any new fies (Ex , new jpg images from his
camera or new video file in mp4 format), freedom daemon will convert new
files into corresponding open format.

      The aim of this project to remove non-standard and royalty based
format from earth. It will be useful for those persons who want to use only
open formats.

       Project Home page - http://code.google.com/p/freedombucket/

PS: I was that normally user do not convert their files to open format
because of time and effort applied in conversion process. This happens with
everybody. So I just thought for Freedom Bucket which will this job for me.
Please do comment.

On World Software Freedom Day today, here is a byte of reality

Sumangala Nayak, a social studies teacher at the Sampangiramnagar
Government High School in Bangalore, could barely operate a computer
until recently ? this, despite her school being part of the first
phase of the central government's ICT@schools programme in Karnataka.
Now, after going through a Free Software training camp, she is not
only computer literate but also declares proudly that she is quite
comfortable using a ?Free/Libre? GNU/Linux operating system, something
that many computer-savvy people wrongly perceive to be too technical
or out-of-bounds........

The idea is nice. Here are some remarks:
 1. Before trying for the daemon try to create a program!
 2. The conversion should be loss-less (this is difficult!). For
 example, conversion of bitmap to png or xpm is not lossy but
 conversion to jpeg is.
 3. After the program is working you can try to augment it using
 FUSE.
 4. There could be the option of not doing the conversion if it is
 not possible --- in this case there are two choices (left to the
 user), either not provide any file at all or provide the original
 file unchanged.

One of the additional difficulties is that some formats are "open"
but are patent encumbered. Trying to maintain "purity" in this
context may be difficult.

Best regards,

Kapil.

 I am using fedora 11

 I installed sun virtual box,through  rpm package download from here
http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads

 I created new virtual machine,when i start the new virtual machine,it show
the following error

Failed to open a session for the virtual machine BOSS 2.
Virtual machine 'BOSS 2' has terminated unexpectedly during startup.



Kernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)

The VirtualBox Linux kernel driver (vboxdrv) is either not loaded or there
is a permission problem with /dev/vboxdrv. Re-setup the kernel module by
executing

'/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup'

as root. Users of Ubuntu, Fedora or Mandriva should install the DKMS package
first. This package keeps track of Linux kernel changes and recompiles the
vboxdrv kernel module if necessary.

A one day workshop was conducted under the auspices of the SSN Student
Chapter of IEEE by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering
in association with SSN LUG on September 19, 2009 in commemoration of
Software Freedom Day. Students in junior years from B.E, M.E. and MCA
were initiated to Free and Open Source Software(FOSS).

Sri Ramadoss Mahalingam, associate at NRCFOSS, AU-KBC introduced the
participants to the realm of open source software. The students were
all ears as he spoke about how Stallman initiated a revolution in the
software industry, that will only grow as SaaS becomes the primary
model of business. Then Srikanth (logic), SSN alumnus guided the
attendees about the installation of Linux OS. Salvadesswaran, student
coordinator then helped them to get a feel of the system, and the
applications they'll use on their systems. Thana Shyam, SSN alumnus
taught them the rudiments of LAMP, and how to create applications
using PHP and MySQL.

Our sincere thanks to Mr. V. Balasubramanian and Mr. D. Venkata Vara
Prasad, Assistant Professors, Dept. of CSE, SSN CE for organising this
event and exposing the juniors to the domain of FOSS. We are also
grateful to SSN-LUG and the SSN Student Chapter of IEEE for aiding us
in the smooth conduct of the event.

Hi friends,

It was a surprise waking up late this morning to see The Hindu's
Information Tehnology page featuring two columns, both about FOSS and
SFD. I saw it on Page 12 of the Chennai Edition, but I bet the other
editions would also have carried it.

I found them on the web too:

http://beta.thehindu.com/sci-tech/article22592.ece

http://beta.thehindu.com/sci-tech/article22595.ece

I believe that it is great that we're being featured in the mainstream
media, and hope to see more of FOSS related news in TV too pretty
soon.

P.S.: I think that The Hindu's beta site uses Oracle, but I'd love
them to use Drupal or Joomla.

Did you run the above command as shown above in your OP?  If so, what 
kind of errors did you get? 

VirtualBox needs kernel drivers to run the VM and these drivers loaded 
as  kernel modules.

Please note that you need to install the kernel source as well as the 
base development tools to compile the drivers to match the kernel.

Without the drivers it will not work.

Salva,

Thanks for the complement. I was referring to Support, Subscription &
Service model of business that Redhat and other Free Software
Developers/ Vendors normally do.

SaaS as a phrase tends towards Cloud Computing etc., which Richard M
Stallman does not endorse. Associating it with RMS is misleading.

Just to avoid any confusion caused to readers.

There is a gentleman named Ken Starks who has been encouraging school
kids under the Helios Project.

http://linuxlock.blogspot.com/

Of course it is in Austin Tx, USA.

But it will be difficult to get such quality computers on donation in
India as we have a tendency to squeeze every cpu cycle before we even
think of donating..

About ease of use, I have run the computer centre of an AICTE Approved
Management Institute having about 120 seats consisting of thin clients
and thick clients for MMS (MBA) students. and oh, with all the zings,
bells, whistles of Multimedia juggleries with many different
proprietary format of sound video etc. using Centos 5.x and Fedora 7.
Initially there was some resistance and retraining required, but
within 6 months even they (future PHBs) were comfortable..

Now this is for the duration of 2.5 years I was there. We are talking
about Aug, 2005 onwards. Now couple of staff and faculty swear by the
usability and stability.

nuff said about linux usability....

What Bharathi sir meant was the guys developing Tally have started
porting their apps to linux. Thats what was there in the paper..

Dear All,

As you are all well aware , Open Document Format is an important standard
for ensuring computer literacy and is fundamental to enabling computer
education globally.  ODF Olympiad  was started  on the advice of the then
President of India, Shri Abdul Kalam, with the view to bring awareness
regarding the open source amongst the schools.

We have been receiving overwhelming response from schools across the globe
including countries like India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nepal .
We strongly believe that this contest will help the government and the
schools in faster adoption of ODF .  (The new FOSS based Informatics
Practices curriculum, introduced by CBSE this year is one of the examples of
the step towards this initiative. )

Knowledge Commons along with  ODF Alliance and Sun Microsystems will be
conducting the *third annual ODF Olympiad* with the view to bring awareness
regarding the open source amongst the schools.

Other institutes  supporting us in this initiative are  IIT Delhi, IIM
Ahmedabad, Free Software Foundation and ODF Alliance (www.odfalliance.org).

The  ODF Olympiad  rolls out  from *September 20th on the Software Freedom
Day*.

ODF Olympiad 2009 will be conducted in schools across India, Malaysia,
Bangladesh and Indonesia (this contest is  open to all other countries  as
well). The winners from each of the countries will compete with each other
 to win  the prestigious Software Freedom Trophy for their school.

The students are required to submit presentations using ODF format on
specific topics which will be evaluated by an eminent jury based on specific
parameters. The posters and letters inviting participation will be sent to
schools as a part of communication. The OpenOffice CD (OpenOffice.org) will
be available with the October issue of "Linux For You" magazine.

For more information can visit the site *www.odfolympiad.org*

Looking forward to your support and participation for this initiative.

1. Please don't use SMS languae in a mailing list. It is very unprofessional.

2. Why so many dots, and commas? End a sentence with a full-stop.

3. Please read:

I follow three things and its working well for me atleast on a couple
of servers I adminsiter.

[1] Remove anonymous edits
[2] Allow registrations of new members with a capthcha. Mathematical
captcha works well for me.
[3] Take RSS feeds of Recent Changes page and keep a monitor on that.
Ban the user posting spam, re-dit the wiki.

Works well!

Message-ID: <7938ae610909202005w3bb3a56cncf7a46f88df3ddea@mail.gmail.com>

$ sha1sum file.iso

or

$ sha1sum file.txt

prints the checksum/SHA1 fingerprint of the file in question.

This can be used for checking the data integrity or corruption.

This technology is also used in a different way for detecting intrusion in
tripwire.

Normally you don't use it with any switch.

You have to execute the same command on two different machines and
verify the output.

It is usually enough to look at the first 4 and the last 4 characters
of the output.

Since a very minor change in input will result in a completely
different output, this
method is invaluable.

Look at it as a nice accompaniment to diff to detect file changes.

Message-ID: <26e584d80909202102t1ebe3e36r7ffc326a66d3348d@mail.gmail.com>

I am having a Pentium4 512mb ram system. I tried installing mandriva 2009
spring, it doesnt support 1024x768 resolution in my system which normally
other distros do. I changed the resolution and then my system crashed while
logging into the KDE.
I tried to reinstall but the installation was not proper because many
packages were skipped during installation due to some error. and now it
boots only into a command prompt.

Anybody help me out

Looks like there is a limit on the number of files this could open. I tried
it with 32, and it bonked.

Also, when i tried it with 5 files(txt), my cmd line got screwed up - as in,
the keymaps werent working - up, down arrows were not responding. (is this
only me or reproducible?)

It seems to be from Escenic Content Engine, a CMS. The Hindu is in:

i use xargs most of the times to kill a particular process for e.g. httpd

ps -ef | grep httpd | awk '{print $2}' | xargs sudo kill -9

for find, which has a exec by default. not need to use xargs

You can also remove all .svn files like this.
find . -type d -name .svn -exec rm -rf {} \;

just my 2 paise

I use 'sudo pkill -9 <process name>' for the same purpose as I need
only a single command to do the same. :-)

I got the same results which leads me to suspect that the original
tip is faulty.

You missed the important detail. Which graphics chipset do you have?
Processor and RAM will not matter for the resolution. It will be what
your monitor and graphics chipset support.

Looks like the same thing on gvim works.
Also this one works : for i in `find ~/Desktop -name "*.txt"`; do vim $i;
done

Though am yet to find the reason for it not working with the earlier cmd
when opening n files(where n is a number that i am yet to figure out)

The tip may not be faulty.  /etc might have a tons of files, which
means your command line would go past the limit.  Try find with a
-print0 option and xargs with a -0 flag ... this way, it uses the
stdin/stdout for passing stuff around going around the command line
limit.

This may not be a portable flag though, should work on GNU.

Secondly, got editor trouble?  Check out http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/

yes - only permit logged in users to edit. I was using akismet and it kept out 
spam for three years - is broken now. am upgrading to latest trac - maybe anti

found it was broken for the last 10 days of my observation. I beleive a

True, but each 'exec' forks a sub shell to execute the command passed to 
it, whereas with xargs it is only one sub shell i.e. the command and 
the target which comes from the find command.

Perhaps you should try it and then make a pronouncement!

You could do this in a directory with a few files:
 $ mkdir /tmp/faultyfindq; cd /tmp/faultyfindq
 $ touch a{1..4}
 $ find . -type f | xargs nano

If you manage to do something sensible with the last command, then
please report it. (I have replaced vi with nano since Roshan seems to
dislike vi).

I suspect the problem is explained in this snippet from the man page
for xargs:

 --arg-file=file
 -a file
       Read items from file instead of standard input.  If you use
       this option, stdin remains unchanged when commands are run.
       Otherwise, stdin is redirected from /dev/null.

So the problem is that vi is run with stdin redirected from /dev/null
which will obviously not work.

Kapil.

Is there any good accounting software similar to tally in Open Source.
GnuCash is NOT user friendly, in my opinion.

Message-ID: <c9ea6e770909210452v78f4451w1e17d6dd8a7ad188@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

I would like to share my experience in KCT college, Thalavapalayam, karur,
where i conducted a simple workshop for the students.

earlier Ravi Jaya had given a one day seminar a month back.

I was invited for the Department function of IT.  After the function is
over, i just invited 15 interested students (only interested students) to
the lab, and gave a basic intro of XAMPP server, and how to easily setup a
internal server for college use.  I gave a brief introduction of PHP, and
how we can easily write and test our code in XAMPP server.  For the first
ten minutes, the students were mere spectator.  I gave a demo of how we can
utilise Joomla and learn about it.  I installed joomla and showed them how
easy to setup a website and update contents.

While i installed XAMPP server in one machine, i asked few students to try
accessing my server using IP through a browser.. this gave them a practical
understanding of how webserver works..

Then i requested one of the student to try installing phpBB forum
software..  Initially none of them came forward.. After few supporting
words, few of them came forward, and started installing the forum software.
and they successfully did it.

After installing the forum, i asked other members to try accessing the forum
from other machines..  this created an interest in them.. i told them, how
we can effectively discuss about project ideas, using this forum software
within college lab intranet..  They tried posting few posts in the forum and
got very much interested..

The demo went for around half-an hour, and i have to leave then..  i told
the students that they can easily do a simple project for their academic
project in web technology itself..  I dont know how far they had understood
all these..

But one point i was noticed..  without making the students do it
practically, all our seminars tends to be fruitless..  Some students later
commented that they are understanding ravi jaya's seminar only now..

I wish, we can identify some practical projects for the students and then
make them learn open source by doing that project with our guidance...

Senthil

There's an effort by one team of developers. You can find it at
http://gnukhata.gnulinux.in. I haven't tried it for sometime now. It
wasn't stable when I last checked. But, they have released a stable
version since.
There's also http://avsap.sourceforge.net/

in fact at a recent meeting in Mumbai this was demoed and got a good

This command will not work if you have filenames with spaces.

Recommended that you null terminate your strings like this to
handle such cases:

find /etc -type f -print0 | xargs -0 vi

Subject: [Ilugc] Migrating from RCS to SVN
Message-ID: <95c27c8c0909210603w36baaea4u39f2683ca40af3bf@mail.gmail.com>

I have been thinking about this for past 3 years :)

I started with Marc Rochkind's
SCCS<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System>way back
in 1993. I understood the concept quite well then. In 2001, I
migrated all my code to RCS (and to Linux from SunOS). I did not find that
difficult. The concepts were the same. However, with SVN I have not got the
hang of it to my satisfaction. For any migration I want to achieve three
things.


   1. In the migration I am very particular about documenting changes and I
   did not loose a single piece of information when I migrated from SCCS to
   RCS. I retained each and every comment about each and very changes made with
   the original timestamps.
   2. When I check out a code, I have the code with all the comments
   regarding the changes and It helps a lot when fixing a BUG or adding new
   features.
   3. I also maintain identification in the source code which goes inside
   the final binary. In SCCS I used the 'what' command. In RCS I use the ident
   command.

svn isn't a distributed VCS. The svn handbook is well documented.

If you want distributed VCS, you can look at mercurial or git.

 e.g. in RCS or SCCS i just have to declare a
variable in my C code as below. Any change using the ci RCS command updates
the revision and timestamp in the source code itself. The $Id: keyword also
goes inside the finally generated binary.

static char    *x = "$Id: qmail-dkim.c,v 1.22 2009-04-22 13:42:51+05:30
Cprogrammer Stab mbhangui $";

This is where packaging (for a distribution) is used as it can
uniquely identify a particular snapshot of your project, without you
or the revisioning tool having to put an explicit version number in
the source file.

It is also easy for customers to just upgrade to a new version by
giving them an updated binary package.

I have got the following idea to have the advantage of have the RCS ident
strings even if I use a system like GIT.

Looks like I can create a git repository on my local system and continue to
work on RCS.

   - Create a GIT repository on sourceforge for my project


   - Create a GIT repository on my local system


   -

      mkdir indimail (which I already have)

      -

      cd indimail

      -

      git init



   - Push the local respository to Sourceforge
      - Make local changes and use ci to commit to RCS
      - do make clean to remove all .o and executables
      - push the local repository to sourceforge

      git push origin master



Am I missing something?

Yes, you can do that. That is why it is called decentralized, and distributed.

---
| mkdir indimail (which I already have)
\--

You can call it indimail.git, so you know it contains a local git repository.

---

RCS does revisioning on individual files. So, you could intialize a
git repo in the same directory where you use RCS, or you can make a
copy of it. It is up to you on how you want your workflow between RCS,
git and sourceforge.net.

Welcome to distributed VCS :)

Looks like I am going to settle down for git. Maybe tomorrow. Meanwhile I
have to install git on my Mac OS X Leopard or shift all my source code to my

This is a not too useful as a bug report.

"Car does not start. Opel Corsa" does not help does it?

Can you elaborate? What was the problem?

If you have a SHA1SUMS or a similar file in the directory where you
downloaded the files,
sha1sum -c <file containing all checksums>
will check them.

This of course is only useful if there are many files that you have
downloaded and want to check it
all in one shot.

The reason for saying this is that when you create a new thread for
every reply, the discussion becomes splattered all over the place and
no one can make any sense of what was discussed/is being discussed.
Please read this - http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html.
This is a good starting place.

Thank you.

The issue does seem to be, as Kapil Paranjape pointed out,
that vi has it's stdin set to /dev/null which it doesn't like.

http://sial.org/howto/shell/ suggests that you can use
backticks (instead of xargs) like so:
$ vi `find -name "*.h"`

Or, just use emacs.

My eyes are very important since I work on the computer day in day
out(never at nights) and
I have been doing this for more than 11 years now.

How?

It is due to UNIX!

I always set very good refresh rates and I set a dark background and
pleasing colors.

My eyes never get sore.

If we go to villages in the train, we find that whenever we see paddy
fields with lush green color, our
heart leaps and a whiff of pleasure courses through our heart.

Green is very pleasing to the eyes. That is the reason it is very
important for Mohemmedans.

I always use xterm with green foreground and black backgrounds.

Please read the man page of xrandr. It is too powerful for your imagination. :)

It is not just "vi" the same happens to "emacs -nw" and "nano" which is
why the latter two exit. However, (like many unix commands) "vi"
assumes that you "know what you are doing" and starts up anyway,
whereas "emacs" and "nano" just quit since they "know what you mean".

Since these are commands start a new window, they create a new
handler for input and so are not affected by setting stdin to
/dev/null.

Ideally, if one wants to use this method then a more appropriate
choice of command is "emacs-client" or whatever it is called
nowadays. This prevents yet another instance of emacs from being
started if one is already running.

You're right, my sentence wasn't accurate.  It's xargs which sets
stdin to /dev/null so it happens in all cases.  I don't know how fair
the characterization of emacs and nano is, but emacs didn't originate
in a UNIX world but then the most popular emacsen have been primarily
UNIX-based for decades.  Whether it's better to quit without screwing
things up, or it's better to screw things up is a matter of taste I
guess.

That is the way you do it with emacs, you start emacs and open your
files with it, not open emacs with filenames on the command line.

Thanks for all inputs. I will disable jpg to png conversion by default in
configuration file but user will anytime enable it.(I was not aware that jpg
is now patent-less format). My main concentration will be on conversion of
close, patent based, royaltee based proprietary formats.

Subject: [Ilugc] SSL_add_all_algorithms() question
Message-ID: <7938ae610909220109y17b02722h132359350064665@mail.gmail.com>

This mail is meant for the guy who asked about this function a week ago.

I think this man page puts things in order.

SSL_library_init(3SSL)                    OpenSSL
SSL_library_init(3SSL)

NAME
       SSL_library_init, OpenSSL_add_ssl_algorithms, SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms -
       initialize SSL library by registering algorithms

SYNOPSIS
        #include <openssl/ssl.h>

        int SSL_library_init(void);
        #define OpenSSL_add_ssl_algorithms()    SSL_library_init()
        #define SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms()     SSL_library_init()

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_library_init() registers the available ciphers and digests.

       OpenSSL_add_ssl_algorithms() and SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms()
are synonyms for
       SSL_library_init().

NOTES
       SSL_library_init() must be called before any other action takes place.

WARNING
       SSL_library_init() only registers ciphers. Another important
initialization is the
       seeding of the PRNG (Pseudo Random Number Generator), which has
to be performed
       separately.

EXAMPLES
       A typical TLS/SSL application will start with the library
initialization, will
       provide readable error messages and will seed the PRNG.

        SSL_load_error_strings();                /* readable error messages */
        SSL_library_init();                      /* initialize library */
        actions_to_seed_PRNG();

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_library_init() always returns "1", so it is safe to discard
the return value.

SEE ALSO
       ssl(3), SSL_load_error_strings(3), RAND_add(3)

0.9.8g                                  2000-09-21                  SSL_lib

You will need to setup a hostname for your server, and then you can
use it from your system only. Post your /etc/hosts.

But, if you have other systems on a LAN, then you can setup local DNS,
and add the name to the DNS configuration so other machines can access
the same from the name.

See this for a start:

Hi

This is a common issue. You have to just go to /etc/apache2/httpd.conf , and
add the line

*ServerName localhost *

The warning should disappear.
If you are planning to access via LAN, give the Machine IP instead of
localhost or check out setting up a local DNS server as Shakti said.

Go to httpd.conf and set a proper name in the

ServerName directive.

Open httpd.conf in vi/vim/emacs and search for ServerName. Set it to an IP
address and you don't have to worry about DNS or /etc/hosts.

It is as simple as that.

The most basic question is Apache configuration is this one and everyone
is bound to get this when learning the details of Apache configuration.

You should remember these switches for testing the configuration settings
everytime you modify the file.

$ httpd -t

More details here. It is really simple.

http://linux.die.net/man/8/httpd

I used to work on the guts of Apache and I used to use the -x switch for
 preventing Apache from forking. I don't think you will need to do that now.

Apache directives are organized in sections like XML.

Thanks!

Firstly, you need to stop making new threads for every reply. It makes it
hard for us to help you out with half the information missing. Why should
anyone bother to help when you make it difficult for them?
You should be able to get resolution of 1024x768 with KDE. KDE has a tool
called krandr. Start it and select 1024x768 in that.

For those who are interested, I found this with a quick google recently when

$ bc
4*40
160

You keep calculating till you press Ctrl-D.

You can do the same thing with lua or python. With lua you have to
prefix with a '=' as it is an
 alias for print.

I normally use lua nowadays.

Then you have dc(1) which is quirky.

You also have graphical utilities but they are boring.

Some tips:

Modulo operator : %
exponentiation: ^ or **

All other operators must be familiar.

This is driving me mad Kapil.

First off many thanks for this great tip. Much appreciated.

But I have a problem. How will I convert from degrees to radians?

Also sine and cosine are to be given as s() and c().

http://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/html_node/bc_18.html

That is not driving me mad.

But how to ask for sin(30), sin(60), sin(90) in degrees to radians?

Is there a simple math formula or will the same bc do it for me in
 non interactive mode(converting deg to radians and vice versa) ?

Apropos of that, we can use expr for non interactive math. You don't
 have exponentiation though. Also use \ before a * for multiplication!

Thanks.

-Girish

Sorry! ;-> I agree that the math library is a bit limited. More
complicated functions need to be defined and made available.

> But I have a problem. How will I convert from degrees to radians?

You can define a function in bc.

 define dtor (d) { return d*a(1)/45; }

The reason this works is that a() is the arctan or inverse of tan
function and tan(45 degrees)=1.

> But how to ask for sin(30), sin(60), sin(90) in degrees to radians?

 define sin (d) { return s(dtor(d)); }

Regards,

Kapil.

Subject: [Ilugc] Indus Valley research - Need a PHP expert as volunteer
Message-ID: <c9ea6e770909230556t22739e38t2e995f543c4a0225@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

The Indus Valley research group at chennai want to develop a web based
system to upload their research articles, photos of IVC seals,  to a
website.  They need a PHP programmer for helping them to develop this site.
There would be some stipend or reward or a considerate amount to be paid for
this work.  But the pay cannot be market equivalent.  So those who could
treat this project as a National Service can come forward and send your
profile.

One of speciality in this project is that a high profile person from one of
the MNC, is associated with this Indus valley research as a hobby.  So any
one working in this project will definitely have bright opportunities.

What they need is some one to take over as project lead, and define the
specifications and requirements.  Then you can make use of other volunteers,
to participate in the coding.

We ILUGC members are long discussing about a Open Source indigenous product
from India.  Most of the open source PHP softwares being developed outside
india.  I hope, now we have a real time requirement to develop a small
software for a national cause.

Please let me know if any one is interested.  You can contact me at
9840708857

Senthil

Since Unix was not about audio or video but about text (!), here is a
nursery rhyme from the time when Unix was a small child:

Dear All,

I looking for a FOSS equivalent tool for the Teamviewer.

*The Problem Statement. *
The primary objective is the desktop sharing, I need to share/access the
LInux Desktop from the Windows as well as from the Linux box. The source and
destination systems are wired across the Internet.

Any pointer or suggestion are highly appreciated.

Nice pics kudos to aishwarya and team :)

Jaya FOSS club has always been very active .. yes the support from
faculty and GSOC's would motivate more students .

BTW I wish the pics were put up in a FOSS gallery like gallery2 or any
other gallery of your choice . Picasaweb is the proprietary web
application from google .

Message-ID: <7938ae610909231757h7fed9ae4r1e33e5a6c50c5e8b@mail.gmail.com>

How do you draw a cat?

Take a pencil and draw on a paper.

How do you draw a chair?

You pull it and sit down.

Similarly you draw ASCII art with figlet. But only
 ASCII characters, not arbitrary lines and drawings.

$ figlet hello
 _          _ _
| |__   ___| | | ___
| '_ \ / _ \ | |/ _ \
| | | |  __/ | | (_) |
|_| |_|\___|_|_|\___/


My gmail interface has goofed it up. But it comes beautifully in a terminal.

Usually there will be arbitrary line wrapping done by mail clients. So
it is hard to transmit such output by mail.

Perhaps this article will help?

The usual solution for this is "vnc". There is also a java applet
that allows you to view the desktop in a browser.

A different solution that has recently seen renewed interest is NX or
rather freenx.

:-) Nice!

Some Debian folks declared figlet to be "non-DFSG" in 2004-5 as explained
here: http://bugs.debian.org/274950

There is a "DFSG-free" alternative to figlet with the unfortunate
name "toilet" that is available from http://libcaca.zoy.org/download.html

In such contexts I like to point out GNU Screen.

http://www.linuxforums.org/articles/gnu-screen-the-ascii-window-manager_274.html

I did a poor job of the article, but screen is really fantastic.

You can connect to screen using the -x switch for mutiview. The manpage
is confusing and does not stress enough the value of this usage.

But for most practical troubleshooting situations in the UNIX world, screen
is much better than bitmapped remote access.

Please end this pointless thread!

The photos were shown and picasa is a great way to share photos.

Much better than yahoo! photos or any other.

I saw the snaps. The purpose of the post was served. It was about a
LUG event.

Everything is perfect!

Then why nitpick?

What is the point?

Let us move on.

There is a valid point in this I guess we need a gmail / google
account to login and see picassa albums . If its so the assumption
that evert Tom / Dick and Harry has a Google account is actually wrong
. I always felt that this argument to be nitpick as you said to avoid
picassa/ gmail .

But recently when i was trying to join a yahoo groups to be part of a
alumni chapter i realised that i dont have a yahoo id . Thats where
the systems like mailman come into picture .

Subject: [Ilugc] pls refer me some Telephony API for using in web-apps
Message-ID: <453157.99723.qm@web53606.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi Lugies,

I need to make telephone calls (voice calls) from within my application (which is a web-based application that typically runs inside a browser either as a Java Applet or as a Flash component).

For this I need some Telephony API which suits my above requirement.

First, I thought of Microsoft TAPI but it is suitable only for stand-alone apps & moreover it looks for a hardware telephone line attached to the machine where the end-user app runs.

Secondly, I considered JTAPI (Java Telephony API) but there is only the JTAPI specification available and no reference implementation.

If anyone has crossed similar lines, pls drop me some references.

Thanks,
Selvakumar.

Why don't you use javascript?

I have never done this but I can give clues.

What do you mean?

You are looking for a soft phone hook right? There are plenty of options for
that. (I think)

Nothing to do with telephone. You implement a telephone with speaker and
mic and a GUI in software.

> Secondly, I considered JTAPI (Java Telephony API) but there is only the JTAPI specification available and no reference implementation.

When there is javascript, why go for Java?

You guys wont believe I also prefer using my own id "pavi@pavithran.org"
Its just a matter of mail client  which is stopping me from using it .

I prefer a web based mail client and I dont like squirrel mail ,horde
or bluemail  .  I also want a mail client which could support me to
chat with jabber protocol .

Please suggest me if such a web based mail client exists . Yes I could
settle for plain mail client but I believe in thin clients hence don't
want a single mail to come to the client machine.

Regards,
pavithran

No I am not saying somethings wrong . The students did a great job , I
am just asking them to use FOSS galleries like gallery2 ,coppermine
etc.

Well google and yahoo might be the two big daddies in the web world .
I am afraid picasaweb is not that beautiful a web gallery as you
describe :P

Go have a look at the features[1] the gallery2 offer you will
understand what you are missing via picasaweb . Yes I morally loose
the right to ask because I am mailing via a "gmail id" I *will* be
moving on to my own mail id .. may be its right time .

Lastly note that I am encouraging students to have their own self
hosted galleries which involves some work ,hence would be learning
something which I think is better thing to do than clicking upload in
picasa client ( which is one more proprietary solution from google )

"FOSS event galleries on proprietary web solutions ? ? "

Does it sound rationale ?

for a normal student, i assume they just need some place where they can
share pics easily with their friends. it can also allow them to comment on
it. but with gallery2, one has to register or do lots of things. people may
not aware of the interface. may be, gallery2 can be for a pro photographer.

If someone wanted to ensure that SFD photos should be hosted in an
appropriately free manner, it is better to ask the students to give
you the photos and host them yourself and explain IN A PRIVATE MAIL,
as to why picasaweb is a bad choice.

The current way is more typical of us, though.

I might just get flamed for suggesting this, but I'll suggest this anyways,
since it is practical and useful, if not /free/ -- You can consider hosting your
domain's mail using Google:

http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html
http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new

It is a good service that google provides and we use it at the company I 
currently work for.

Although, that said, let me add that I don't use it for my personal domain (I 
prefer using IMAP when I'm on my laptop (>95% of the time) and horde when I am 
away from my laptop).

Speaking about closed-source web-services, I remember reading an extremely 
interesting essay about this by Doc Searls:

  http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000137

Those who think that Pavithran's question was nit-picking, might feel otherwise 
after reading it. A quote ...

The extreme user (not use) case is my cousin. He loves to take photographs and 
share them with people. He does this mostly by email. Last summer I asked him 
why he doesn't use Flickr or some other photo site. "I don't use any site that 
requires a password", he said. Why? "They're a pain in the ass", he said, adding 
"I don't need a password when I walk into a store, or drive from one place to 
another. Why do I need one online?"

Open source web platforms aren't really gaining ground because most people are 
blind to the benefits that such a thing would offer -- Imagine being able to 
move your albums/emails/social-network between different service providers if 
you are unhappy with the service or your requirements have changed !! Imagine, 
being able to link your facebook with your iTunes or your iTunes with gmail or 
your gmail with mapquest or yahoo video chat ....

All this should be possible with web services (and would be if the services were 
opensource). Unfortunately it is not so today. Integration is only built if it 
in some way benefits the service provider (and *not* if doing so would solve 
some problem you face) and you might as well forget about interoperability.

Red Hat tried to do it with Mugshot:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugshot_%28website%29

...but it didn't become popular.

I think there /is/ a definite advantage to pose questions like Pavithran. When 
you think about it, instead of brushing it off, you realize that today's web 
services are 'centralized cathedrals' rather than 'bazaars' ...it need not be so.

cheers,

Dear All,
I would like to convert from Lotus Notes (Domino) on Windows 2003 Server to
Qmail on Linux (CentOS).

I am trying to use Fetchmail to retrieve the mailboxes but

The challenge I am facing is

1. How to reset the password for 700 users with a script (any pointers would
be highly helpful)
2. Any other suggestions that have to be taken

I have migrated users out of Lotus notes by putting a proxy imap / proxy
pop3 in front of your lotus notes and capture the password. You can use
indimail for doing that

http://www.indimail.org

IndiMail initially started with migrating users out of Lotus Notes and
exchange to a qmail based system and comes with proxies for imap, pop3 and
smtp

Sorry, a typo. I meant that I have migrated users by putting a proxy in
front of lotus notes servers (and not your lotus note server).

Perhaps you meant this posting as a joke but then I didn't get it!

This sounds quite similar to "I would like to create doc files but I
don't like oo or abiword so I am stuck with MicroSoft".

Why on earth would you want that? Mail and chat are completely
different protocols with very different goals. "I want a telephone
which also acts as a postal system."

This makes little sense too. If the mail (at least the text of it)
"does not come" to the thin client how can you read it? If you mean
that the mail should be stored on the server then use a client that
supports imap and put imap on the server.

So really all that you need is a server that runs daemons that
support smtp, imap and jabber. Then a thin client that runs a mail
client and a jabber client is all you need. So for the server
something like postfix, dovecot, jabberd and for the client something
like mutt and irssi. (But you may prefer graphical clients like
balsa and pidgin).

Hi luggies,
    I feel that awarding a merit certificate for the students who made
demo stalls for SFD-09 will make more enthusiasm among students.It
will make more students to get interested in it.And the time spent
there also become more valuable and we can proudly hold and show it to
everyone.It ll definitely help to make more amount of budding luggies.

Thanks for bringing this to the notice of all of us and the online petition
on Swecha is a great idea.

Is there anyone here on the group, who can take this issue to the notice of
the electronic media? A story on a few of the news channels will take this
to a larger audience and, hopefully, result in a quicker response from the
Government.

You can invoke several commands for creating public keypairs, prime
numbers, random
data, base64 encoding and so on.

You also create SSL self signed certificate and private key using this utility.

$ openssl rand -out randdata.bin 2048

will generate random data of size 2048 bytes.

Several possibilities are there. You can encrypt files, decrypt them ,
use salt, you can do a
whole bunch of stuff.

If you simply enter openssl you can enter these commands within the
openssl shell interface.

We have to follow this style. Instead of discussing for days about the
proprietary hosting, camera software, hardware, image format etc.

This is really funny. First buy hardware which is overpriced and which
always comes with the OS preloaded (and therefore paid for) and then
replace this good OS with a crappy one - that is quite a plan! Someone in
the government is on dangerous mind-altering drugs.

About the petition - the point about XP doesn't make any sense. I quote
here "This and other similar products from proprietary suppliers provide
vendor lock-in as their data and files can read by only their software."

I could have understood this statement if this was about using MS Office
and therefore the Office proprietary formats - but how does this apply to
using just an OS ?

If I was using Linux and a proprietary office product on top of Linux,
this assertion of possible vendor-lockin would still be true.

The petition should have stressed on the usage of open office formats
rather than talking about XP.

Regards,
Prem

Dear Manvendra,

Is there any pun in Lotus Notes Servers and Lotus Note Server?

Can you please let me know the procedure or any pointer in this regard will

In short:
1. Install and run vsftpd on the repo server.

2. You need to copy the repository files to /var/ftp/pub on the repo
server, as per Fedora repository directory structure.

3. Add the Fedora-11-offline.repo file to your client machines,
install Fedora-GPG RPMs.

Please see this for a start:
http://wiki.dgplug.org/index.php/Fedora_offline_repo_setup

I will be in Chennai this weekend, and if anyone needs the Fedora (10,
11) offline repository, please let me know offline. We are in the
process of automating deployment of Fedora offline repository with a
Makefile (to begin with).

Hi Guys,

I hope that you would have known about this from Google:
http://www.project10tothe100.com

and Its time for us to vote.

<snip>

Last fall we launched Project 10^100, a call for ideas to change the world
by helping as many people as possible. Your response was overwhelming.
Thousands of people from more than 170 countries submitted more than 150,000
(or around 10^5.2) ideas, from general investment suggestions to specific
implementation proposals. As we reviewed these submissions, we started
noticing lots of similar ideas related to certain broad topics, and decided
that combining the best aspects of these individual proposals would produce
the most innovative approaches to solving some very pressing problems.

The result is the list you see below of 16 "big ideas," each inspired by
numerous individual submissions. Which ones should we make happen? You tell
us. Your vote for one of these ideas will help our advisory board choose up
to 5 projects to fund, at which point we'll launch an RFP process to
identify the organization(s) that are best suited to implementing them.

Thank you to everyone who has chosen to lend your energy to Project 10^100.
Your idealism will inspire our own efforts to make these world-changing
ideas a reality. So please cast your vote, and help us take this next step
toward building a better world.

Don't we already have enough "engineering colleges" giving degree

No doubt that they deserve merit certificate. ILUGC being an informal body, doesn't have structure for such things. In fossconf type of events we select best stall and award prizes.

The way I have migrated users out of Lotus Notes / Exchange is setting up a
small desktop with IndiMail

   1. Setup indimail
   2. add users to indimail datastore using a utility called hostcntrl
   3. startup proxy imap and proxy pop3
   4. change IP address or configuration so that all users who do imap and
   pop3 to land on the indimail server. The proxy for imap/pop3 on indimail
   will transparently connect the users to lotus notes or exchage. Set the
   DEBUG environment variable in the proxy imap and proxy pop3 service. This
   will start logging all user passwords
   5. write a fetchmailrc file which will pull all user mails using the
   password captured in step 4.
   6. setup your own IMAP/POP3 server using the password captured in step 4
   and hey you are now migrated out of Lotus Notes or Exchange


 Look at the architecture diagram to understand more of this

I don't understand what kind of DSP tool use are asking?

DSP is very wide area. DSP includes subfields like: audio and speech
signal processing, sonar and radar signal processing, sensor array
processing,statistical signal processing, digital image processing,
signal processing for communications, biomedical signal processing,
seismic data processing, etc. It impossible for any one individual to
master all of the DSP technology that has been developed.All those
subfields has their own subfields. DSP learning involves two tasks:
learning general concepts that apply to the field as a whole, and
learning specialized techniques for your particular area of interest.
I never seen a single open source tool for all the subfields . These
are the tools I know, but we have lot of open source tool for each
subfields. first decide area of interest, then search tool for your
area of interest.

open source seismic modeling, imaging tool :
www.cwp.mines.edu/

SImg is a software for astronomical image processing :
directory.fsf.org/project/SImg/

Image Processing :

Filters is a image processing library :

I have a couple of servers running ext4 and there are no issues
so far.  Unless you really want the new ext4 features, I recommend
ext3 for now.

More than the risk ext4 brings, the greater risk is of your HDD
failing.  Are you implementing any type of RAID to protect against
disk failures?  Or better yet, have a 2nd HDD where you can do
a daily file sync.

I will be using this HDD for storing my Video Clips for video editing so I
am not planning for any RAID.

If you are using large files and directories, then go with ext4
as it offers extent based allocation, and other nice things for
large file IO.

You can also mount an ext2/ext3 fs as ext4 in a fully backwards
compatible way and still derive some ext4 benefits.  But ideally,
you should be running full ext4 to avail all the new features.

I have come across cases where in case of a major ext3 filesystem
corruption corruption, fsck would take days ( 1.5 TB took about 5 days
, 5 TB took 21 days ) to complete . This is one of the major drawbacks
of ext3 on huge filesystem which scale in TB's . XFS and ext4 would
perform much better in such cases . Also I think it would be worth
mentioning that Red Hat has introduced ext4 as a Tech Preview in
RHEL5.4 :

XFS is great, if you have a 64bit kernel, plenty of RAM, stable
hardware and power source.

Data recovery after an abrupt power loss or kernel crash is extremely
difficult.  I have lost several XFS volumes (on IRIX and Linux) due to
hardware/power issues -- expect all file/dir names to be renamed with
corresponding inode numbers and moved into /lost+found!

Sir,
Thanks for your concern. We do aware of this fact and took up with the
User department, before it was finalised. But this is what they would
like to have.

Should I wait for Kerner 2.6.30... or try with the current version on Ubuntu
9.04. Ext4 recommends not to create ext4 on Ubuntu 9.04.

I had migrated my /home from ext3 to ext4 and my /boot is on ext2 (from
scratch) and / is on ext4 (from scratch)... I use ubuntu 9.04 desktop.

There would be occasional HDD spin lock with  both ext3 and ext4
filesystem due to kernel bug (this can be overcome by upgrading your
kernel or wait till 9.10).

Be assured, my data was intact even after the spin lock.

The reason why many recommend not to go with ext4 is due to the spin
lock and grub issue. You can overcome the GRUB issue with setting up
/boot with ext2 or ext3. I prefer ext2 as you don't need journaling for
/boot.

Remember spin lock is also the issues with ext3 under the same kernel.

I recommend you to create ext3 filesystem and then migrate it to ext4
and use.

Thanks a lot. I was talking in terms of an external 1.5TB HDD so does Grub

Message-ID: <ca1ffc30909250208r3d150efbi76c937be76fb57d9@mail.gmail.com>

hi guys,

I would like to create a custom linux distro , the following are my criteria

1) i should be able to add a custom rpm and install it automatically during
installation of the OS .
2) i should be able to remove unnecessary rpms from the base distro .
3) i should be able to install rails and ruby as well  (this is a tedious
task since rails is installed via gem).
4) i would like to place my rails application under the /usr/local
directory.
5) if possible i would like to modify the splash screen and  other logos of
the base distribution(it can be fedora ,centos or any , preferably redhat
based)

can anyone help me with this , i found few links in google but they were
pretty outdated (fedora core 3 ) , and others (linux from scratch) couldn't
satisfy the above criteria . As far as i know tools like fedora revisor and
suse studio wont help , i dont know much about kickstart but looks like it
wont satisfy the above mentioned criteria as well .

Don't bother about GRUB then... Just go ahead creating ext3 file system
and run tune2fs and fsck then mount it as ext4. This should do the trick.

tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/yourfilesystem

fsck -pDf /dev/yourfilesystem

ehe, it ideally should be the tech team's responsibility to decide what would 
work best for the user. Just because 'User' wants that new shiny malware rich 
flash based resource hogging widget, a good sysadmin does not let him have it. 
Same argument applies here.

Well, actually all your requirements can certainly be fulfilled with either 
kickstart or revisor.

Why do you feel these approaches would not help ?

Depending on your use case (do you want your users to be able to install the 
distro themselves and you provide the customizations (use kickstart) Vs do you 
want to redistribute your own customized distro (use revisor).), you can choose 
what to go with.

Dangerous argument you're making there.  Who decides what's best for
you?  We don't need to be pushing mommies and daddies onto our Supreme
Court judges.  We can argue that file formats and information exchange
standards remain open, what we, or rather you, can't do is push your
ideology of what's right/good/etc on to others.

Hence, if they want Macs, then that's what they get.  If that choice
means that others are forced to buy Macs too, then you complain, else
it's just none of your business.

Sorry, I stand corrected. Funny how it is easy to slip up in such matters, when 
one instinctively feels that something is wrong.

Actually, on more thinking, i realized that the instinct was correct in this 
specific case. The reason being, the funds that would be used to purchase the 
said user's preference of laptops are public funds ie: our tax money -- and so I 
still think, the user's choice is wrong. If they feel they need a Mac let 'em 
buy it themselves from their own money. Public funds should not be used to 
prefer one vendor specifically, irrespective of user's preference.

You can ship the Ruby gems with your installation, and during post

I agree with you Roshan. Tech guys can recommend and convince the end
users (business users.) It is the business users who are paying for
services / product. What they ultimately ask for goes in the tender /
RFP / PO.

I have seen this notion among many in LUGs around the world. They want
every one to use FOSS and yet forget the first guiding principal of
Open-source -- FREEDOM. The business user has the FREEDOM to choose.

IT dept is only a support department in any organization or govt. IT
dept don't have any REVENUE model. When you don;t have a revenue model
you are at the most only an advisory dept.

The question is not on the WHY on the tender you have proprietary stuff.
It is if NIC guys have done enough to promote open-source. Our govt on
one hand talks of going open-source way and on the other hand pay
license taxes... The policy makers have to set the policy straight and
ensure compliance. Then the business users are bound to limit their
purchases within the policy items. Our govt wants to accommodate every
one (remember -- Bill gates has thrown the bread crumb in the form of
AIDS support.) So how do you expect guys sitting at NIC to only propose
FOSS solution always.

Kickstart and few others tricks working perfectly for the above scenario.
Only thing is, you have to learn those stuffs. Learn how to use .ks file,
chroot and how to customize root file system. Then your job will be easy.

No idea about other methods.

Steve, wonderful observation about the tax fund. We elected this govt.
Our govt is not mature yet like in USA or European countries. We made
our point clear with the ISO in opposing MS Office XML format. But we
lack similar thinking in other areas. Lets make our voice heard clear to
the policy makers.

Imagine the furor if they put out a tender saying that they only want
to be supplied mobile phones made by Samsung or want internet service
only from Tata Indicomm.

Normally, a tender document should put out the specifications --- not
a commercial brand that is supplied by only one company. Government
departments over the years have found ways to subvert this system. In
this particular case, they will say that a number of different
"vendors" exist.

You're totally right, Roshan. When one is spending someone else's money,
it is best to spend as much of it as possible to get whatever one
wishes.

I agree. In fact, even without naming a vendor in the tender, there still are 
ways to 'prefer' a certain vendor over others by putting in arbitrary 
'requirements' for the purchase.

IMHO, an active press involvement might help correct this favoritism, besides of 
course, directly communicating with the decision makers for the SC.

For software, there might be a possibility of arguing to favor the most common 
platform over most open but as far as hardware is concerned I don't see why 
Indian laptop manufactures are being shafted in the tender.

You miss the point. If the users want Mac with WinXP and it is
foolish, then these guys have to step in. If they had said Mac with
MacOS for whatever work that guys would do, I've no quarrels.

If you want to learn Linux bash shell commands in a fun way this is
the place for you.

This website provides Unix-like virtual online bash shell command line
interface where you can try out bash commands easily online in a web

Once you gets your hands over bash shell commands you can easily move
on to Linux because the knowledge of bash shell commands are essential

               Then instead of providing certificates we can make a page in our
website and list the name,id of students who were all presented stalls in
SFD.That will be a credit for them and motivation factor for the other students.

Message-ID: <e6b5008a0909250944x23eccb0bw13f2ef8253cd35c9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using Arch x86_64 on my laptop.
I'm trying to connect my laptop to my LCD tv via the available VGA port.
GNOME displays doesnt recognize the new screen at all.
So i tried xrandr -q
output:
--------------
Screen 0: minimum 1280 x 800, current 1280 x 800, maximum 1280 x 800
default connected 1280x800+0+0 0mm x 0mm
   1280x800        0.0*
--------------

My X server uses input hotplugging. so there is nothing i can do with xorg.conf
lspci is able to detect the VGA controller.
output of lspci | grep -i VGA
-----------
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series
Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 07)
-----------

I saw on the arch forums that xrandr gives three screens usually.. the
default (screen 0 in my case), a LVDS and a VGA output. xrandr isn't
even able to recognize the VGA port

Anything I can do to make it work?

Message-ID: <7938ae610909251650m76256364qa11647b8c71965b4@mail.gmail.com>

$ randtype /etc/passwd

will slowly type out the file.

Here is an excerpt from the man page.

       -r s1,s2[:...]
              Replace  the string s1 with string s2. You can specify
multiple replacements
              by separating them with a ?:?.

       -q int Quit the program after this many seconds.

       -t ms,mult
              This option refines the random delay of output. The
value of the argument is
              separated  by  a  comma  with the first argument being a
microsecond and the
              second being a multiplier of a random number between 0
and the  microsecond.
              A  character-per-second  effect  can,  for  example,  be
made by setting the
              microsecond to 0 and the multiplier to 1000000. The
default for this  option
              is specified at compile time.

       -v     Display version information and exit.

       -w chars
              The inverse of the -n option; this option waits on the
specified characters.
              Use the -c option to refine the random delay of output.

EXAMPLE
       randtype -t 13,16000 -d ",*MAGIC*" -k -n ?0ou? filename

Here are other possibilities.

It is a fantastic utility. Also useful for hacking since it is a
console utility.

It may be a good idea to ask the student volunteers what they want.

As a volunteer I feel this might be good idea other than giving certificates.

Hi.
Can anyone suggest a python based captcha that can be used during a
sign-in. We are planning to use mathematical captchas.

Any suggestions?

Cheers,

Subject: [Ilugc] debian lenny on nintendo wii
Message-ID: <92f9a9560909260509ycf55922n5d4149f23c1d1b5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have always taken some pleasure in running Debian on weired
and wonderful hardware.  In the past, I've installed debian
on various Sun, SGI, Alpha, MIPS, Mac hardware and today I've
successfully have Lenny running on my Nintendo Wii.


Nintendo Wii is a game console (which I won at a competition)
and over the few months, I've been attempting to install home
brew (3rd party apps) and Debian on it.  Today, it's all come
together and I'm able to apt-get install any ppc lenny package.

The Wii draws less than 18W of power, and is suitable for limited
workloads around the house, a small NAS, ssh/media server, etc.
Surely it's far easier to get an Intel Atom to anything which the
Wii can peform, but the main reason for running Linux on the
Wii is the enormous learning opportunity it presents in understanding
console hardware, security and kernel programming.


The guys at Game Cube Linux (gc-linux.org) deserve all the credit
for porting the kernel to the Wii hardware.

The Wii is PowerPC based machine which requires a modified kernel
to boot and run its unique hardware.  For now, all disks, USB,
bluetooth, and wired Ethernet work, but the internal wireless LAN
and DVD drive don't work.  X is not yet setup, but I think it's
do able.  I have already installed the native tool chain but not
yet tried compiling a full 2.6.31 kernel with all the modules
and 3rd party drivers.

Debian The Universal Operating System: http://www.debian.org
Game Cube Linux:  http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Main_Page
Wii hardware:     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii


Here's some output from my Wii:

As a teacher, I feel, a "Printed" certificate will motivate the students.
The online reg is Ok. However consider giving certificates

As Raman told, ILUGC cannot issue certificates. Bcoz ILUGC is not a
formal group. ILUGC is an informal and virtual group. We will add
the list of volunteers and the topic, that they handled during the
SFD, in the site.

Bye :)

as far as I can see, the CMP is a dream - fosscomm appears to be run by 2 NGOs 
who are using the FOSS community to get funding. There is big money in FOSS 
promotion now, and the vultures are gathering.

I think this is self explanatory. ;)

I get reminded of this great Tamil saying my friend said:

"Budhisaliku solli puriya veka vendiyathu illai, muttaluku sonnalum puriyathu"

Have a good laugh. ;)

It means this in Anglias.

" It is pointless to make a fool understand: For the truly wise there
is no need to explain."

Anyway I will digress a bit and speak about mail servers.

This IP address belongs to a company in TIDEL park HealthsoftUSA Pvt. Ltd.

This is the way you figure out the mail server IP addresses(MX
records) once you know the e-mail ID
of your friend.

Say you are sending mail to aplawrence.com.

His ID is tony@aplawrence.com. So Do a cut at the '@' character and
take the domain part.

Now, run dig on it with the '-t mx' switch.

$ dig -t mx aplawrence.com

aplawrence.com.         7200    IN      MX      10 aplawrence.com.


Amidst all the noise in the output, this is what we want.

There is aplawrence.com with a MX weight of 10.

Now let us look at girish1729@zoho.com.

$ dig -t mx zoho.com
;; ANSWER SECTION:
zoho.com.               1800    IN      MX      10 mx.zohomail.com.
zoho.com.               1800    IN      MX      20 mx2.zohomail.com.
zoho.com.               1800    IN      MX      50 mx3.zohomail.com.

We have three mail servers here. Now we want to figure out the IP
addresses of each of them.

You can easily find out either with a ping or dig again.

$ dig mx.zohomail.com
;; ANSWER SECTION:
mx.zohomail.com.        140     IN      A       72.5.230.114

I got this from the noise.

Now, the thing with static public IP addresses is that usually big
companies/corporates buy a block of
16 IP addresses. So their mask will be this in most cases.
255.255.255.240 or /28.

Then you want to know two things:

a) which is the gateway in the upstream router of the ISP
b) Which are the public IPs I can use for other purposes like HTTP,
load balancing and so on

sipcalc is useful for that.

Sorry I want to digress little more now.

You saw the zoho had three mail servers with MX weights 10, 20 and 50
respectively.

This means that mails will be delivered with the record with weight 10
first. If that is busy,then
the one with 20 and so on.

Always priority in the technology world works this way. Lower the
number, higher the priority.

The idea of having multiple mail servers is to tell the mail server
that sends mail that you can
try contacting my backup mail server in case my primary mail server is
busy or that the link is full or down.

Hai Peopo,
        I agree with Mr.Raman and Mr.Bharathi.S thoughts on providing
certificates for the students who made SFD`09 demo stalls, that was very
nice idea publishing on ILUGC website. I`m sure people like us will be
motivated by this kind of motivation and mainly it will also explore the
Software Freedom Policies though this medium too. And I also thank the
Mr.Raman, Mr.Bharathi, Mr.Srinivasan, Mr.Bala, who are supported and guided
us on SFD'09. I have to thanks Mr.L.Mohan and Welkin who guided me and
helped me.

Note : ILUGC must conducted many programs like this. I will be very happy to
be part of it.

Cheers,

To get the help you need, you need to provide your distro, it's version 
number, how did you install the first version of FF etc.

I feel these approaches wouldnt help because i went through revisor manual
and few sites , they have mentioned that you can add your rpm provided you
have it in a repository , the rpm im trying to add is not in any reposirory
, and i dont think the rails part of my question can be done through revisor
. I dont know much about Kickstart , i will give it a try this week since
lot of others in lugc have mentioned that it can be done through kickstart .
Thanks everyone.

Most likely you signed up giving the service provider access to your 
email account and their bot picked all the entries from your address 
book and spammed them with the invite.

BTW, most of the services have an opt out button (or similar action) to 
allow registration without having to provide your userid/password of 
your email box.

I have inherited the system administration of a file server with a 6TB 
XFS filesystem.  What was the size of the XFS file system with which 
you experienced the above problem?

The client premise experiences frequent power outages.

We are revisiting this utility since I got to know its power only recently.

Silly me!

$ xrandr -o left

$ xrandr -o right

$ xrandr -o inverted

$ xrandr -o normal

Try all this. It is great fun!

$ xrandr -s 1024x768

will set the 1024x768 pixels mode. You set the refresh rate with the -r switch.

In my case I can get the 1280x1024 mode, but then the refresh rate is very poor.

So I switched back.

For higher modes you get lower refresh rates since there are
limitations in the graphics
memory of the graphics card.

Of course you guys must be knowing the Alt Ctl + and Alt Ctrl -
keystrokes for switching
between modes. And you can kill X by Alt Ctrl Backspace. If you are
running a display
manager this will only restart X.

Remember xrandr is a X extension. You should have it loaded for all
this to work.

In general all my tips may necessitate installation of some package.
You have to take
care of that.

Since there is no universal way to install packages and you cannot
install all packages from
source I will leave that out. You have to figure out.

If you are using Debian, of course things are very simple. ;)

I had 150-300GB each on a few Irix 6.x boxes and ran into issues.  I
also tested xfs on 2.4.x linux kernels with ~1TB file systems and had
the same problem -- I ran reiserfs in the end.  This was circa 2000-2001
and I have not used xfs since.


> The client premise experiences frequent power outages.

I don't think the xfs situation has improved, and would not recommend
using it with unreliable power or hardware.  Unless you are exceeding the
limits of a tuned ext3/4, it's best not to move away from ext3/4.


Btw, are you having all 6TB on a single file system?  Any file system
corruption can hose the entire volume and take a lot of data with it.

The previous consultant company had done the install and config.; they  
chose XFS.

Yup, the entire 6TB (external array connected with FC to the file 
server) is XFS.  Another 3Ware array of 4TB was on XFS which I have 
reformatted to ext3.  On the 6TB device, the client has a lot of data 
that cannot be moved elsewhere and hence I am stuck with XFS until some 
additional storage is arranged for.

You are going to use external HHD, then think about  old Linux OS

Hi,
I am looking for some advice on migrating from MS exchage to postfix/dovecot
based email server, what are the tools that could be used to migrate the
mailboxes? I read about imapsync its for migrating individual mail boxes,
any other free software tools that i could use for this purpose? How can i
export users from active directory to 389 ds? Do i have to do it manually?

excellent and do it by all means. You will looking forward to having a
superior email server compared to exchange.

You can also use fetchmail to fetch all mails that get delivered after the
imapsync completes. You can also stop SMTP on the exchange server for the
period of migration to prevent new mails coming in. There are plenty of ways
to achieve migration. They have to be thought out.

You can use CSVDE. CSVDE stands for Comma Separated Value Data Exchange.
CSVDE is a small command-line tool that is included in Windows 2003 installs
by default - usually found in the *%windir%/system32* directory. Using CSDE
you can dump the records into a csv file and write a shell script on your
linux system to add the users using ldapadd command

But you won't get calendering, tasks, notes. Nothing will work.

E-mail will.

Postfix is a good choice. That is what I use.

Since CSVDE seems to be the preferred way I have a
question here.

Why not use LDIF?

I wonder.

Samba LDAP is gunning towards AD compliance. It is far from
the goal but is quite functional right now.

I *think* that all LDAP servers should mandatorily support LDIF
for importing/exporting users.

But I have a feeling that you should trust other's answers
rather than mine which is quite theoretical.

Best of luck!

Instead of #fedora IRC, the OO forums/mailing lists might be a more

IndiMail has SMTP, IMAP and POP3 agents which are location aware. It will
handle the job of transferring mails, imap, pop3 connection to exchange for
users who have not yet been migrated. IndiMail significantly modifies the
qmail source code to achieve  the location aware property. The same location
aware property allows IndiMail to distribute users for a domain across
multiple boxes without having to rely on networked filesystems like NFS. In
fact IndiMail was originally written to allow seamless migration of users
out of Exchange and Lotus Notes to a non-proprietary email solution.
IndiMail also has a feature called MIGRATEUSER which allows on the fly
migration of users as and when they authenticate.

IndiMail is free (GPLv3) software entirely coded in C. More details at
http://www.indimail.org

The entire feature list is at

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mbhangui/IndiMail

The architecture which allows a heterogeneous mix of email servers is at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Indimail_arch.png

IndiMail is being actively developed and ranks 287 amongst all software
categories at sourceforge.net

This is not correct. XFS has had several improvements over time. XFS
journals metadata updates and not data updates but that is exactly the
case for Ext4 as well (Btrfs does the equivalent of data journaling but
it is still experimental).

A number of early Ext4 issues were actually fixed by following the same
working model as XFS. Look up sync on rename for example. In short, XFS
is no more prone to data risks compared to Ext4 on any recent
distribution. Of course, if you really value your data, you should have
backups anyway.

Hi Friends,

A rough translation of that article in english

<translation>

Thirunelveli: Microsoft corporation is on a drive to curb piracy by
getting hold of dose illegitimate copies.In recent times without
Microsoft nothing can be acheived.In most cases many use microsoft
products like xp,vista,(badam,pista - translator additions ;).

It is the duty of the OEM  to sell computers with microsoft original
software.It is observed that to reduce cost of Rs2000/- people sell
computers with pirated windows copies which result in spreading up of
virus.Microsoft is on drive to eliminate piracy, raiding hotels
educational institutions,internet cafe,hospitals and found pirated
windows copies om use. In this catch abt 15 organisation paid around
Rs 1 crore.


A dealer in the thirunelveli said, it is the best practise to use
Microsoft products. Because of pirated windows hackers(stealers) get
into computers and take advantage, due to this computers gets spam.
Aug 22 windows 7 is released and because of this as a pre runner this
raid activity is taken place.

</translation>

cheers,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

There is a myth being spread, deliberately or otherwise that viruses and
spam can be combated by using "original" software. I don't know who got
this crazy notion first but I heard it way too many times. If a virus
exploits vulnerabilities in the software or engages in social
engineering, "original licensed" copies of the same software would have
the exact same problems.

While "piracy" is indeed a problem and I would certainly encourage end
users to abide by licenses for the proprietary software they are using
or better yet, switch to FOSS,  the false virus propaganda should really
stop.

Thanks. The installation from source is a bit complicated as it tries to
provide everything in one shot (spam filter, virus scanning,
smtp/pop3/imap, greylisting, DK, DKIM, BATV, etc). You can always use
the RPM from

I would suggest Zimbra for moving away from MS Exchange. I recently
tried, Zimbra and OpenXchange as an alternate for MS Exchange. Both
are good and with full of features matching with MS Exchange all the
way. But I preferred Zimbra for it outstanding web interface.

Message-ID: <96c87ced0909280513o1dcb993ax2f4f1989a5a17e8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to access barcodes scanned and saved in a scanner's flash
memory. The scanner, Opticon's OPN 2001, connects via a USB cable
(which rather niftily also charges its battery), but the interface is
actually serial rather than "native" USB. Opticon scanners seem to be
supported as of Linux kernel 2.6.29
(http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_29) , as in the usbserial module
is loaded and prints:

[? 196.495094] USB Serial support registered for opticon
[? 196.495135] opticon 4-1:1.0: opticon converter detected
[? 196.495529] usb 4-1: opticon converter now attached to ttyUSB0
[? 196.495557] usbcore: registered new interface driver opticon

lsusb gives:

Bus 004 Device 002: ID 065a:0009 Optoelectronics Co., Ltd

How do I access the scanned data? Presumably, an application has to
use /dev/ttyUSB0 to do so. Are there generic Linux apps. which will do
so?
Googling has not yielded results beyond the kernel version. As I have
only used the serial port for modems, I'm unsure how to proceed.

Sameer

In MS Windows, the Opticon driver has to be configured to point to one
of COM1-3. It then slurps the data into a default file containing the
barcode, the type of barcode format, and a timestamp. There is also a
settings option to configure the scanner (turn off timestamps, e.g.).

If you have got so far then wouldn't it work?

Did you see the sources of the opticon driver?

Grep for this device ID and vendor ID combo in your linux kernel tree.

The driver is attached, so you would have to test using /dev/event*
interface or some such for testing.

A generic serial communication program like minicom or cu should be

Just point the serial port device to /dev/ttyUSB0. I am applying
logic here. Never been there, never done that...

It is the same thing I suppose.

A quick glance at the opticon.c code looks like it is a driver which only
gives generic serial port like access to the scanner (makes life of a
programmer simple by not having to work with USB). You will have to ask for
the protocol from the manufacturer to talk to the device to collect the bar
codes stored in the flash memory. Some manufacturers might not give it (Of
course they will have free windows software and drivers for it) . For an
other manufacturer I had to sign a NDA and fax it to the USA before they
gave me the protocol for a DAQ device...

This is not true. You have much better options by using open source

free of cost.

Yes, I have a different, "true", USB tethered barcode reader that

Nope, nothing shows up from /dev/ttyUSB0 when I scan a barcode. And probably
nothing should, either, this is an untethered device. The USB connection is
for syncing data/config/power only.

> Did you see the sources of the opticon driver?

Yes (http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/usb/serial/opticon.c),
but without any insight into kernel modules, I've no idea how to access the
functions.

Hrm, any pointers using userspace apps? I'd prefer not to get into C

OK, will check them out. I was hoping there might be some variant of

One more funny thing is,

The webpage itself is a crap!! got a bug, just try this,

1. Open that page in firefox,
2. without filling any fields, click on the 'your comment' area
3. Bang!!!! ..

I want to put a comment about this particular sentence,"Without
Microsoft, we can't survive(???????????? ???????????? ?????? ?????? ????????????
???? ???????? ??????? ??????? ???????? ???? ???? ?????????????)".. Dear
reporter, please do some groundwork before putting it in your branded
newspaper(or in the newspaper site). If you want to see people who are
using computers without Microsoft products, come to ilugc meeting.

Also if 'dinamalar' is open to our words, then get the hell out of that
M$ site!!

You get it? No?

diff(1) tells you how file.txt should change to become file-modified.txt

The line number is the first field in '4c4'.

c - change
a - add
d -delete

Most of the time it will get your head in a tizzy.

But never worry!

Patch will understand it. I will talk about the funny program by Larry
Wall as complicated
and meaningless as perl itself ;) later.

patch(1) loves the unified diff produced by diff -u. This is the
default svn diff format.

With cvs you have to explicitly give this.

$ cvs diff -u foo.c

will diff with the version in your working area and the repository.

And hackers also love unified diff. Instead of using '<' and '>' for
showing lines in first
file and second file respectively, '-' and '+' are used in unified
diff. Also a context is used
to say what lines precede the changes.

Nowadays you have diff between 3 files, comm and so on.

And vimdiff is a utility to merge two files.

So if you want to send patches upstream you should know a thing or two
about diff and patch.

We will look at patch(1) tomorrow.

Generally, one should prefer the command
 $ diff -u file.txt file-modified.txt

The reason is that this maintains the _context_ information of the
differences as a result:
 - the diff is more human readable
 - the diff is longer :-(
 - the diff can work with patch even when some unrelated changes
   have been made to file.txt after the diff was created

diff -c shows context.
diff -u is a GNU extension.

GNU's not Unix!

I prefer looking at the diff -u output.  But I remember there was some
project which explicitly stated that they must have diffs in "context"
not "unified" format.

If you update the whole system, then probably a new entry is created
in /boot/grub/menu.lst. Make sure that the system boots from the new
kernel, and if this doesn't work, delete the gconf files from your
home directory. I had the same problem a fortnight back. This was what
I did to resolve the problem

Uploading is painful unless I have an option to upload multiple pics.

actually it is meant to be painful - the idea is that pics should be chosen 
with care and uploaded one by one - people can upload to picasa or wherever in 
bulk. This is an archive, so just one or two pics per event is what is needed 
here. Maybe my approach is wrong, but if you look at galleries maintained by 
guys who work at their photos, there are a few photos only, but the ones put 
up are carefully retouched and massaged to look really good. Again (my 
personal opinion) the advent of digital photography has ruined the fine art of 
photography (as the advent of broadband has ruined the fine art of email 
etiquette). Anyway thanks for taking the trouble of testing out the app.

Please use spell (it people and not peopo) check and avoid SMS lingo.  
Better still activate spell check in your email composer.

Also you do not reveal which distro you are using and version etc. which 
leaves the members of the mailing list clueless about your setup.

You should not user root to login into your account GUI or console.  
Either use su or sudo to do your system administration activities.  GUI 
Administration Console (e.g. Add/Remove software in Fedora) are 
configured to prompt for 'root' password.

Dear friends,

Kindly read this; particularly the comments section.

http://aplawrence.com/Girish/c-programming.html

Also read the linuxtoday site link where this article was posted.

Most comments say that they would not believe that somebody would
actually employ me!

Great. I am not good enough to work for anybody. Hence I am on my own...

Have fun reading the article and the much more interesting talkbacks.

After an update (especially one that updates a whole lot of packages) it is 
always a good idea to logout/go to runlevel 1 and return back/reboot.

Root login in GUI was disabled in Fedora quite a while back. Unless you changed 
the behavior, you would not have been able to login as root from the GUI before 
the update too.

Yes, a serial interface.

The device exports one configuration.

You can use libusb library to send specific requests to the device and

Also refer their developers' guide:

If you have a USB (hardware) analyzer, you can capture the USB packets
for this particular endpoint, or you can use the one (software)
provided with the Linux kernel.

"""
ZBar is an open source software suite for reading bar codes from various 
sources, such as video streams, image files and raw intensity sensors. It 
supports many popular symbologies  (types of bar codes) including EAN-13/UPC-A, 
UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 128, Code 39 and Interleaved 2 of 5.

The flexible, layered implementation facilitates bar code scanning and decoding 
for any application: use it stand-alone with the included GUI and command line 
programs, easily integrate a bar code scanning widget into your Qt, GTK+ or 
PyGTK GUI application, leverage one of the script or programming interfaces 
(Python, Perl, C++) ...all the way down to a streamlined C library suitable for 
embedded use.
"""

Disclaimer: I know next to nothing about bar code scanning. I just saw this 
application in the results list when I did a "yum search scanner" (was searching 
for alternatives to xsane).

Seems a pompous article and doesn't tell me anything new. It seems a bit
of a incoherent rant really.

A couple of specific examples:

* The notion that you can do anything you want in C is perhaps true but
silly. I mean, you can do everything you want in assembly language as
well but that doesn't mean, it is suitable for everything. Pick your
tool to suit the job required.

* BSDs use much of the same user land as Linux and version control isn't
centralized.  Distributed development fits well within the free software
culture anyway. If you wanted a central repository, all major
distributions will provide one.

So I can't say I enjoyed reading it.

exporting JAVA_PATH and JAVA_HOME are useful only to the jre (when it wants to 
know where to look for libs/bins). So, you also need to setup your system to 
select the correct java binary.

See what is the output of:
$ ls -l `which java`

You may have to use the update-alternatives command to set this correctly (man 
alternatives).

Make sure that the JAVA_PATH is the first entry for PATH. You are now 
probably using the GCJ java from /usr/bin.

Use something like:
export PATH=$JAVA_PATH:$PATH
or
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

at least 200 servers with 32 GB RAM and several TB of diskspace - running 
multiple nginx frontends and multiple tornado backends, memcached with at 
least 6 TB of db in the cache.

True,

Pycon India 09 was really a fantastic event, happened to see a lot of young
python developers,it was amazing to see their love with python :)

Especially Prabhu Ramachandran team's talks were inspirational( of course,
all talks)

I found this page sometime back when I was weighing lighttpd vs apache.

It provides a lot of info about the software, but also provides some
hardware info.

I think initially, the EARLY YEARS section of the article would suffice

Doesn't centos come with a /usr/sbin/alternatives option?

If it does, try
/usr/sbin/alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/jdk1.5.0_11/bin/java 2
/usr/sbin/alternatives --config java
Choose 2

hi,
ever since I read about facebook opensourcing tornado, I haven't been able to

some bugs, but anyway a test deployment is here:

http://demo.ilugc.org.in

as far as I can see it is 10 times as fast as apache/mod_wsgi. And the install 
and setup is simplicity itself (if one can remember to add semicolons on every

try it out - even the sfd2009 gallery loads at an impressive speed.

Very. Nicely done. How much of it is nginx and how much of it is tornado?

"Imagine running an Android device without email, YouTube, maps or
market? The new code delivered in the MOD may be awesome, but without
the core applications the device would feel naked. So, Cyanogen simply
"included" those applications in his ROM images. He even included the
new Android Market application -- before Google did. Oops.  Someone's
upset -- Google did not authorize the re-distribution of their code

As above said the java installed is gcj. If you are installing the Sun java
or open jdk then its better to remove gcj.

The reason for that is
1. GCJ contains java core modules relaated to unix kernal so if you are
going to develop platform independent application then it woulds cause some
problems.

2. If you are using Swing then the gui in GCJ would be gnamoe based and
again if you use already built java code written in windows platform, then
your UI will be messy

3. One of My advice is that use any of the IDE like Kdevelop or Eclipse so
that the comilation will be proper

Start small. Setup a server on Amazon EC2 or a similar cloud service.
Setup your application on that and see what type of load your server will
be facing. As your website gets popular, you will need to add more server
instances, setup load balancing, setup multiple database servers etc.

Store your files on S3 (if you are using Amazon EC2).

Though justified, it's still a bad move from Google, but fwiw this issue 
has been supposedly 'amicably' resolved - Cyanogen is currently working 
with the Google folks to make a bare-bones mod that excludes Google's 
closed-source apps. Details are still being worked out, but a new, 
lawyer-compliant release is expected soon.

Vamsee.

Subject: [Ilugc] .a-tip-a-day (patch - apply diffs and act as inverse of
	diff)
Message-ID: <7938ae610909291654i2ede5afft2c3015cd52919a2f@mail.gmail.com>

Yesterday we saw diff in somewhat detail.

http://ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2009-September/051658.html

Today we are going to see the most important tool that every hacker should know:

PATCH(1)                                                              PATCH(1)

NAME
       patch - apply a diff file to an original

SYNOPSIS
       patch [options] [originalfile [patchfile]]

       but usually just

       patch -pnum <patchfile

There ya go. patch applies a diff from the original file to get a modified file.

This is what you do when you send your genius invention to your mother stream
upstream. IOW you need to send a bunch of patch files or even have them in one
single patch file(also known as patch set) to the author/maintainer of
the project.

But applying patch can be painful.

Here is an example.

$ cat file.txt
Slow day.  Practice crawling.
You are farsighted, a good planner, an ardent lover, and a faithful friend.
You will lose your present job and have to become a door to door mayonnaise
salesman.

$ cat file-new.txt

salesman.

You will be winged by an anti-aircraft battery.

You will reach the highest possible point in your business or profession.

+You will reach the highest possible point in your business or profession.
+Slow day.  Practice crawling.

Now the idea is to create file-new.txt from a guy who has file.txt.

How do you do it?

$ cp file.txt /tmp
$ diff -u file.txt file-new.txt > patch.txt
$ cd /tmp
$ patch -p0 < patch.txt

Now look at file.txt.

It has the same contents as file-new.txt

$ diff /tmp/file.txt ~/file-new.txt

Both files are same.

Now why I say patch is complicated.

Try patch again on top of patched file.

$ patch -p0  </home/girish/patch.txt
patching file file.txt
Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n]

What a question and how confusing?

You should ask Larry Wall, the author of perl and this patch utility
why his brain works
in such a complicated fashion.

Anyway remember these things with patch.

         o patch needs a p0 or p1 argument, typically it is only one
of these two - try to find out
            when to use what switch
         o patch always needs the '<' operator. Without that patch
will never do its job

Once again it shows Larry's complex thought process. Isn't it obvious
that I will only give
a patchfile as argument to patch? Why should I redirect? Anyway I have
nothing personal
against the fellow.

After all I love Perl.

Anyway patch files can contain a lot of gunk both at the top and
bottom. You can apply a patch
from a saved e-mail or in the middle of a document and it will still work.

I do not think I can do better than the others who replied in this
excellent thread.

I would concur with the view that you should build scalability from
ground up and provision for the immediate need and bare minimum.

You can always add hardware resources as you move along.

Take a cue from the telephony provisioning practices and traffic arrival
rates.

You need to evaluate that and then go for expansion.

For the math oriented, does "Poisson distribution" or Bell Curve ring a
bell?

Anyway I am needlessly complicating.

No need to get into all that. Just plan for scaling. This means that
you should already know how to do load balancing and HTTP redirection
and take care of session persistence.

Then you can add new machines and IP addresses to the pool
easily.

Also think of p2p filesharing as
 that does not need impose high loads with burgeoning traffic. You
share the loads with the downloaders. Use bittorrent if possible.

Things like that. Best of luck.

Ever yours,
Girish

To do this (in fact in general, it is always be a good idea) to use the 
"--dry-run" switch. According to the man page:
        --dry-run
           Print the results of applying the patches without actually changing 
any files.

Another userful switch is the -b or -B switches - Make backup file of the files 
being patched. See the man page for more info.

Umm. That is incorrect. patch reads from stdin. So, you can also send the output 
of a pipe to patch. For instance in the days before git, the quick way to update 
your kernel sources if you already had an old version of the sources was to get 
only the patchset and apply them. Something like ...

$ cd /usr/src/patches
$ wget -O- ftp://www.kernel.org/<url>/patch-<version>.bz2 | bunzip2 - | patch -p1

> Once again it shows Larry's complex thought process. Isn't it obvious
> that I will only give
> a patchfile as argument to patch? Why should I redirect?

...so, you can also send multiple patchfiles to patch ...

$ cat somefile[1234].diff | patch -p1

...and patch will do the right thing !

cheers,
- steve

Dear Members,

The Pycon India 2009 held recently at IISC, Bangalore was wonderfully organized and our ilugc members Kenneth and Others had given wonderful Talks. The registration fee was minimal. Food, T-shirt and CD's were given due to the sponsors active contribution. FOSSEE group of IITB also distributed T-shirt and LivePython DVD (Ubuntu). Only thing i found negative, it was ill-timed(festival days).

I got the http://in.pycon.org link from ilugc mailing list. I sent the same to my third year students yahoogroup . Nearly 28 students from my college participated on their own. Of course hardly 12 of them were really serious enough. Previously, when? ilugc arranged seminars/workshop on networks and virtualization, hardly one student used to accompany me. Surely, there is winds of change in my college.

Last year, I influenced my higher ups to? take FOSS elective subject. This year we hope to take it again. 

With regards,

Mr. Kenneth,

Great job with the site! yes, it is much quicker than before. How much
time did it take you to migrate to tornado?

Also, any gotchas or was this a pretty trivial migration?

I wonder if this is perhaps the first non-facebook tornado implementation
out there.

Regards,
Prem

well, a good contribution from your college. Next hear chennaipy is planning 
to bid for pycon India 2010. The discussion is taking place on 
chennaipy@googlegroups mailing list - please ask interested people to join the 
list and help make our bid successful

Well good. But not convincing enough for me to like patch
though. Sorry.

Agreed. But this is not what I said. If you have nothing in stdin, then
read the file I give in stdin. Isn't that obvious?

As I said Larry complicates unnecessarily.

Of course, that is a good thing. The utility is powerful but I
don't like it. It should have been way more simpler and friendlier
and still powerful.

I'm sorry, I don't understand. The way i see it, there is nothing complicated or
unfriendly about patch. It is small, /simple/ and flexible.

AFAIK, diff and patch are supposed to complement each other. In other words, the
output of diff can be used as input to patch directly ...even in a chain:

Wall is an interesting character, makes good reading, although I don't
know Perl, I still read stuff by him.

Hi Luggies..
I am new to twisted environment i started with the Book  Twisted Network
Programming EssentialsBy Abe Fettig , Publisher O'Reilly..
I started with the installation...
I use Ubuntu as my Os...
after installing twisted using synaptic package manager i was to install
additional packages like *PyOpenSSL* and *PyCrypto* as per the book... i
installed it too...
PyopenSSL package worked properly when i imported it in a python interactive
shell but i get error mesage  when importing PyCrypto

Error Message is :

>>> import Crypto
>>> import twisted.conch.ssh.transport
>>> twisted.conch.ssh.transport.RSA
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'RSA'

So How to solve this....
if anybody has suggestions for a good tutorial on twisted for a beginer i
welcome it...

Perhaps you can paste a few more lines of the code that you are trying to

Write such a (simpler and user-friendly) utility or at least design
one!

People criticise things like patch and Perl (and the English language)
for very sound _theoretical_ reasons. However, these are successful
systems and it is worth trying to understand why.

The "There's more than one way to do it" philosophy that underlies
these systems is one of the reasons people find it easy to adapt them
to their way of thinking and _create_ programs (or simple sentences
in English).

Systems like Haskell and Lisp (or languages like Sanskrit) are very
nicely structured and easier to read and understand once you learn
the basics. However, these are much more difficult to get started with
writing.

C is neither easy to write nor easy to read!

Regards,

Kapil.

I think this is the code being used:
http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sUviL0XxgMEC&lpg=PA177&ots=c3lfubBhl6&dq=twisted%20conch%20rsa&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q=twisted%20conch%20rsa&f=false

I am not sure if it is due to a library change or a language spec change.

How easy you find a language, depends on how you learnt it and how much
passion you have for it. For me 'C' is like poetry. Just do an strace on a
perl program and an equivalent 'C' program and you will be surprised to find
the amount of gunk that is there in the higher level languages.

e.g.
You can take the following 'C' program as an example. Write the same in perl
and enjoy the gunk that comes out.

int
main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
__write(1, "hello world\n", 12);
}

Just print the line "hello world" to file descriptor 1

I managed to run random examples from the twisted book. There appears to be
a lib change for sure. Try running the other examples.

The equivalent program in perl would be
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "hello world\n";

(just two lines instead of 5 lines in the 'C' program. But an strace on both
show
the C programs does the same job with 23 system calls
the perl program takes 160 system calls to just print the line "hello world"
on screen

oh like this code:

print 'Hello world'

(where is the gunk?)

Sure and writing in assembly language will probably use even few sys
calls. However I think the focus is on the wrong place in this argument.
Programmer's time is often more valuable than machine time.

Come dude ! ...that's a lousy argument and you know it. I, myself, prefer python 
to C and C to perl ...but won't ever look at number of syscalls to defend my 
preference.

If you *really* want to go that way and do a 'relevant' one-to-one comparison, 
you have to include the number of syscalls being made by gcc when compiling your 
code to binary ...which is essentially what the perl interpreter is doing for 
you for 'free'.

I deal with sites that do more than 3 million visitor per day. And I have
had to handle more than 5000 requests/sec to my MySQL servers. Money is not
in abundance for me to throw servers here and there. Every bit counts at run
time and that is what decides if you will need 3 servers to handle 3 million
or more than 10 servers. I am talking about a real production scenario. And
I get my job because one of the things I do is get more for the buck.

for that matter facebook handles more than that a day - so does youtube - they 
use python servers. I believe that they are getting bang for their buck. As 
are google, yahoo, livejournal ... none of them use C. As some one remarked, 
programmer's time is more expensive than memory, servers, RAM and bandwidth.

Ugh ! don't take statements out of context and then reply to them. Let me 
rephrase what I said -- I won't ever defend my preference of language /solely/ 
by citing the number of syscalls that a final executable needs at runtime.

Anyways, 'nuff said.

I am ex-yahoo. So not true that 'none of them use C'. Most of the foundation
platforms we built on C.

There you go, you've done it again. You've taken my statement and twisted it 
around as though I was dictating you to accept my language preference.

All I was saying that your argument was ridiculous. Allow me to explain. Read it 
slowly this time ...maybe a couple of times:


You said:
> the C programs does the same job with 23 system calls
> the perl program takes 160 system calls to just print the line "hello world"
> on screen

The intent of reply was to point out that ...

> the C programs does the same job with 23 system calls
*plus* the number of syscalls it would take for gcc to convert text to executable
code, which is what perl does on your behalf. So, comparing number of syscalls 
of the
final executable is not a valid measure of appropriateness of a langauage.

did that make any sense to you ? If it didn't I am sorry, I can't be more 
clearer than that.

cheers,

I never did speak about comparing number of syscalls to the appropriateness
of a language. The point I was making was the efficiency one looses when one
uses a scripting language. And some times the efficiency one loses, decides
how many server you deploy to server x number of users? Does that make sense
to you? If it didn't I am sorry, I can't be more clearer than that.

Twisted is event programming with Python. Learning events is hard.

Thank God finally someone realized that events are far better than

All this is irrelevant man. Isn't it a simple download, python setup.py

No, twisted has nothing to do with crypto man. It is an event
library for I/O multiplexing. Learn about epoll(2), kqueue() or libevent.

Try to solve this first:

Don't mix with crypto. Keep things simple and stupid.

I am sorry about that. I honestly wanted to have some meaningful
conversation and my point was only on someone making a comment that C is
difficult to write and difficult to read - which is untrue if one knows the
language. So I apologise that somehow the conversations became more of a
noise than a debate.

We all love the language which we are comfortable with. And a artist can
take any tool and make a poetry or a painting out of it and not complain
about the tool.

So apologies from me to all for the noisy traffic

Hello,

I apologise for offending people and igniting a flamewar.
However, I could not prevent myself from writing the following long
response. :-(

On Wed, 30 Sep 2009, Manvendra Bhangui wrote:

While your intentions were honourable, your remark was about speed
and efficiency and number of syscalls --- none of which has anything
to do with reading/writing C!

> We all love the language which we are comfortable with. And a artist can

That is certainly true. There are indeed a large number of good
programs written in C --- however, even those programs would be
almost un-understandable if the comments are stripped out!

The kind of things you talk about, like assigning a char to an int
and so on are _precisely_ the things that make the language difficult
to understand since one has to run a small compiler + semantic
analyser in one's head to keep track of programs that do that.

C is a good language for writing operating systems, device drivers
and system libraries. That is one of the things that it was designed
for. Until Unix, most of the above tasks were programmed in
assembly. Using C allowed one to deal with them at a higher level and
create greater structure in the OS code, hence making it more readable
(than assembly code) and yet almost as efficient (as assembly) at the
same time.

Readable code is not necessarily efficient. For example, in Haskell,
one definition of the list of primes is:

  primes :: [Integer]
  primes = sieve [2..]
        where sieve (p:xs) = p : sieve [x | x<-xs, x `mod` p /= 0]

This is almost exactly the mathematical definition of the Sieve of
Eratosthenes written thousands of years ago! So it is very readable
(comments are not required!). However, it is not an efficient program!

Now, scripting languages like Perl have some higher level facilities
so that it is comparatively easy to translate the above program into
it (retaining most of the inefficiency!). In C you would have to
implement list operations (and probably garbage collection) before
you could translate the program. However, in the course of doing
this you would find ways to make this more efficient as well! You
could also translate this new C program _back_ into Perl --- but
translating it back to Haskell would be significantly harder.

This example (if you work it out) will explain why I said that
programs are easier to write in Perl and easier to read in Haskell;
whereas neither is the case with C. As _you_ pointed out, good
programs in C do tend to be more efficient than any of these
languages and if a thoughtful author has provided enough comments,
then they become readable as well.

Hope this clarifies --- and douses the flames a bit!

Kapil.

How do you think the python/perl/whatever-interpreted-language works? The
interpreter first reads in the script, parses the code, checks for errors,
compiles it down to byte-code etc and then starts executing the statements
line by line. How is this "free"?

A compiler is required to create the machine code just once - while an
interpreter will need to do this every time a script is done - unless you
are using pre-compilation.

Ultimately, yes, it does come down to the number of instructions which are
executed by a platform for performing a single function. No one in their
right mind will argue that a program written in C wouldn't be faster than
the equivalent program written in any other high level language - unless
the algorithm was implemented poorly.

And yes, the platform you use to run your app on has a pretty drastic
impact on cost - the cost of software, the servers, electricity etc all
add up if you are going to be adding servers.

Having developed some large enterprise banking apps in python - this is my
feedback.

There is a significant performance penalty in using python or for that
matter any of the other *trendy* languages these days - ruby, groovy,
jruby etc. Scala, on the other hand, is pretty fast (almost as fast as
java on the jvm) but I find it pretty difficult to learn.

And whatever one may say about java, I can verify that java is much
quicker than python, php, groovy, ruby and jruby. And now with really
simple frameworks (see Click for java), java development doesn't take much
more time than python development.

Just look at the performance difference between the different languages -
it is pretty astounding.
http://blog.dhananjaynene.com/2008/07/performance-comparison-c-java-python-ruby-jython-jruby-groovy/

I am guessing that Youtube, Facebook etc would have saved a lot of money
on infrastructure and incurred a minor increase in development cost if
they had used java rather than python.

About developing in C/C++ - the vast majority of desktop apps are still
written in C/C++ due to the vast difference in performance between C/C++
and interpreted languages.

The reason C/C++ isn't heavily used on the web is because:

1) There aren't that many good frameworks for web development using C/C++.

2) Memory management is complex (when compared to interpreted languages).
So it requires a more skilled developer. Skilled C/C++ developers aren't
that easy to find.

3. .NET/Mono is pretty fast though not as fast as C++. And since this
platform has garbage collection etc, it is far easier to develop in than
C/C++. So it is a reasonable tradeoff.

If you are interested in web development using C++, try this framework:

This is so not true!  There are tons of very hairy C (by which I mean
subtle, so you have to pay attention) that are still very
readable/understandable.  I remember K&R and UPE having lots of
examples which made me marvel at their ability to write C code which
was direct translations of English text, which was a direct
translation of a thought in their head.

There is much merit in your words above, but it's like saying "you
shouldn't eat apples because oranges have lots of vitamin C".  Aye,
Python allows you to defer decisions about types till much later, but
that doesn't make C hard.  C++ sure, many would agree is hard, but C
itself is a very simple language, which is why it is so popular.

It is readable because you understand the syntax.  Since I have only
had Haskell code shown to me, I can make out that the first line says
that primes is a list of integers, which is the sieve of the list 2
and 'something', that something is a car/cdr list with the car
followed by gobbledegook, here I guess what it's doing from what I
know of sieves not from the code.  (x, where x comes from xs, such
that x%p <> 0)

Also the readability vs. efficiency issue isn't that simple.  OCaml, I
hear, is very very efficient, and very strongly typed, but with type
inference, so your code apparently won't have many type annotations.
The ideal language would be something that looks like Python and runs
like optimized C.

Ok now, this is getting creepy. Why do people insist on taking my words out 
context, latching onto them and then sending out a reply ? Is there something 
happening here that I am not aware about ?

What did 'free' mean in my statement ? I'll tell you what -- a bad choice for a 
word. I thought my statement world imply

    "...unlike the aforementioned required step of invoking gcc, the perl 
interpreter would generate machine code from text, on your behalf, without 
expecting any additional effort on your part" (hence /for free/)

...but obviously, this meaning did not translate. What instead it /did/ 
translate to was that due to some strange, weird, unimaginable reason, I am 
talking and defending things that I lack the basic understanding about, like, 
for instance, how an interpreter works !!

So, i apologize for my poor choice of words.

again, my sole intent was to show the fallacy of an assertion, to balance the 
scale of measurement, to point out the error in comparison, to bring some sense 
of perspective ...to bring some /sense/ itself, for that matter ! ...*not* to 
defend one language over the other.

Again, I guess, I didn't do too well. Ah well ! I'll leave you boys to your 
language war.

It does have. The flexibility of writing in C is that I can further reduce
the syscalls. It gives me so many ways to manipulate my environment. On a
server like a mail server which is processing few million mails a day,
choice between using spamassasin written in perl or using something like
bogofilter in C makes as much difference as to reduce the number of servers
by half. In troubled economic times, each syscall counts and I cannot
explain the relief and the pride one feels when one sees on the top screen
(/usr/bin/top), to see the load dropping, the moment you engineer something
like this.

Even in python and perl, you can generate a compiled code. Apart from saving
on the parsing, I am not sure how much one can save. I used to do that with
tcl/tk

Coming back to the example

Instead of writing
#include <stdio.h>
int
main()
{
printf("hello world\n");
}
gcc try.c -o try
The above try when executed will execute 24 system calls

But I can write my program without any main() and the entry is through
_start()

#include <sys/syscalls.h>
int
_start()
{
syscall(SYS_write, 1, "hello world\n", 12);
}
gcc  -nostartfiles -nodefaultlibs try.c -o try -lc

I save two system calls. One of them is a stupid call by printf() to check
if file descriptor 1 is a
character device

fstat64(1, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(136, 2), ...}) = 0
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) =
0xb7f0b000

The 22 syscalls are below after all the optimization is below and if you see
only the 2nd last line is the one which actually does the job of putting the
string "hello world" on the screen.

brk(0)                                  = 0x9783000
access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
directory)
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=152155, ...}) = 0
mmap2(NULL, 152155, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0xb7fc5000
close(3)                                = 0
open("/lib/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)        = 3
read(3,
"\177ELF\1\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0\3\0\1\0\0\0\300\v\\\0004\0\0\0\354"...,
512) = 512
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=1803428, ...}) = 0
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) =
0xb7fc4000
mmap2(0x5aa000, 1509672, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3,
0) = 0x5aa000
mmap2(0x715000, 12288, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0x16b) = 0x
mmap2(0x718000, 10536, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x718
close(3)                                = 0
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) =
0xb7fc3000
set_thread_area({entry_number:-1 -> 6, base_addr:0xb7fc36c0, limit:1048575,
seg_32bit:1, content
mprotect(0x715000, 8192, PROT_READ)     = 0
mprotect(0x5a6000, 4096, PROT_READ)     = 0
munmap(0xb7fc5000, 152155)              = 0
write(1, "hello world\n"..., 12)        = 12
exit_group(12)                          = ?

In the above example where both the programs were written in C if the code
gets executed million times, I will save 2 million of system calls. However
the above example is not the right example for all situation. Example it is
better to call printf rather than syscall(SYS_write) if you are going to
call printf multiple times.

However in most of such cases in my experience, the inefficiencies have been
due to bad coding rather than the choice of language.

Also in one case, I have not been able to beat a program written by someone
else in perl. The program happens to be a greylisting server which involves
searching a IP in a table having millions of entries. The better speed (5x)
in the perl program happens because of a better search algorithm than the
one which I am using in my C program. A good algorithm in any language can
make a huge difference and outweigh everything else.

That's quite interesting.  Where was this, if you don't mind sharing
that.  I haven't written much C at work, and I guess I've never seen
much industrial C either then.  Never would have expected to be
hovering right near assembly.

Never say never. There has been quite a few demonstrations otherwise
available on the web. Feel free to look them up.

Hello,

Since naming specific languages seems to activate the sensitive
spots, I will restrict myself to "abstract nonsense" here.

There are a number of terms that are used when measuring (programming)
languages. Sometimes these are called "language metrics":

 1. Popularity: The number of people reading/writing programs
    in the language.
 2. Efficiency: The speed with which programs written in the
    language can be run. (This might or might not include the time
    taken to compile the programs).
 3. Readability: How easy it is to figure out what a program is doing
    by reading the `bare' code. (Explanatory comments not included!)
 4. Writeability: How easy it is to convert a given algorithm into a
    program in that language.
 5. High level/structured: How many different logical/mathematical/end-user
    concepts are embedded in the language.

While there is doubtless a certain amount of subjectivity in assigning
values to these metrics, the real subjectivity in our judgement about
languages arises from how much weightage we assign to each of these.

 1. If we are writing for a specialised developer community,
    popularity has little value.
 2. If we are writing small programs, efficiency of the running
    code may not bother us at all. Also compiler efficiency is of little
    relevance for daemons even if it is just-in-time compilation.
 3. If we do not really care whether others read our programs (e.g.
    throwaway code) then readability is not an issue.
 4. If a large library of efficient builtin functions is provided, we
    don't mind having to look up an index to use these functions. So
    implementing algorithms is not "our job"; gluing together these
    functions _is_.
 5. If we are manipulating very simple data objects in a
    straightforward manner (such as reading/writing from devices) then
    high-level concepts may even be a hinderance!

Regards,

Kapil.

I would add a few more

6. Community

The spamassasin example was at Sify. At that point we were hit by spam and
virus
specifically targeted at Sify. And the servers were just not able to cope up
with the load. One night of frantic coding and the spamassasin was replaced
by bogofilter. A program called qmail-smtpd was modified to look at the exit
code of bogofilter and discard the mail at the entry points.
bogofilter is a very fast bayesian spam filter available at
http://www.bogofilter.org

Currently we are doing some of this stuff at my current job. Just few days
back we have got a huge performance gain by moving to sphinx -
http://www.sphinxsearch.com/ (written in C++) and we are
again going to save on servers by moving away from Lucene -
http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/ (written in Java)

Take a look at

http://highscalability.com/

It explains the architecture of high scalable sites like youtube, flickr,
etc. I have personally gained a lot from the above site.

Oh, please be specific.  Trying to be PC means you don't get much done
anyways.   The ultra-sensitivity here is major annoying already.  I'd
rather the focus on ILUGC remained on what you have to say instead of
how you say it.

There are many tools to choose from:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_debugger

Valgrind is a popular choice.

GNU libc malloc has some debugging functionality built in, see the
malloc(3) man page.

Hmm, in my enthusiasm to participate in a flame, i forgot to reply to this, 
although i did have a couple of suggestions :).

Somebody already mentioned valgrind. There is also pmap which is good for a 
quick 'point-in-time' snapshot of process memory space (man pmap) or just
$ cat /proc/<pid>/status

...or even "ps l"

hth,
cheers,

Perhaps one of the existing projects from freshmeat.net EDA

insert getrusage() in your code

man getrusage(2)

Friends.

Nowadays, we see more students are coming towards to contribute.

We need to show them on how to contribute.

Programming and releasing their code is a great way.
But,I see most students have fear to code and
they dont believe that they can do programming.

We can make them to code gradually.

We have to pull them to work with community and make them to contribute.

Shall we discuss here what are the ways to contribute rather then coding?

It will be nice if we create a list of tasks to be done and
let the students pick any task by their own wish.

Any suggestions on list of tasks to be done for the FOSS?
