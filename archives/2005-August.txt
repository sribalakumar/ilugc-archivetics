I don't know what your priorities are but I do have reaons to  choose
Ubuntu over debian.
It has latest of the packages included. Though much of the work is
based on the debian
base, things are changing now. Xorg for instance was first included in
ubuntu and is now
being ported to debian. Ubuntu is very much focused on security.
Though many people say
that it is focused on desktop and novice users there is no reason why
an experienced users
shouldn't use it, especially when you can get the work done with
lesser effort. All the packages needed for me is in the Ubuntu repos,
If at all I find a package not in the Ubuntu there is always the
debian packages as a fall back.

An option is to use the full Courier suite rather than just the IMAP
part. It has support for quotas on virtual mailboxes.

  Why don't you simply use the BSNL-supplied UT-300R or Huawei ADSL
modem instead? They're charging only Rs.2k for these units, AFAIK.
It's set to support PPPoE by default, which works well with RP-PPPoE
on most distros.

I think we should put up a webpage on Ritchie Street
in our wiki site with the different _trusted_ shops
where we buy our stuff. 

I go to Sagar Infosystems. There is a guy called
Vinod, there. Recently, he had a problem with a small
Sony Vaio portable computer that had come from Japan.
As usual windoze crashed ... what else can you
expect?. 

Someone suggested booting from some windoze boot disk,
use fdisk, but, it didn't lead him to anything. I told
him to boot from some floppy GNU/Linux distribution to
test the hardware. It only booted from a small hard
disk or through floppy. He got hal91 from the link
here:

http://www.linuxlinks.com/Distributions/Floppy/
 
and while boot up, during hard disk read/write he got
the status ready read error. I told him hard disk
problem, and it had to be changed. He was now
confident to answer the client. Case closed.

Hi,

The Union Minister of  Communication and Information Technology,
Mr.Dayanidhi Maran has announced that a Open Source Development
Centre will be started in Chennai (by the end of next month). He made
this announcement when inagurating the Sub-Rs10,000 PC of HCL
which runs Linux (looks like it's FC3 from the press photo). Another
Company, Xenitis, has also launced a similar low cost PC running Linux. 

Is this the beginning of an explosion of Govenment supported
Linux/Open Source initiatives?

   I can't understand this - are they pirating RHEL 4 to install these PCs?
That's just as criminal as pirating a Micros~1 CD and installing it on an
assembled PC.

   I hope that better sense prevails and they pay RedHat for RHEL 4,
or switch to a free-as-in-beer distro like WBEL or Centos or FC3/4.

The above link is to a users experience with bsnl dataone connection.
He says the Huawei SmartAX MT800 or MT880 supplied by BSNL is a
modem+router and can be configured to work as either! Is this true?

Yes, go to http://192.168.1.1/ in your browser with the modem on (of
course!) and the log in as user: admin password: admin

You can change the properties of the router from the web interface. I

Siva, things look good and I could not see anything wrong going on
there, much less "criminal" :)

RHE appears to be only a "subscription" model to sell support for
"open source".  The subscription purchased may expire, but not the
license under which the software is distributed. Apart from the
service contract, there are no significant differences between RHEL
and Fedora ( http://www.redhat.com/software/rhelorfedora/  )

The only contaminant in the free-as-in-beer distros from RH are their
trademarks ;)

   RH owns the copyrights to some material (mainly artwork and logos)
in the non-free-as-in-beer RH distros. That material has been removed
from the Fedora distros.

   I would be perfectly satisfied if:

HCL uses any Fedora distro without paying any per-copy royalty;

or

HCL uses RHEL and pays the appropriate fees to RedHat.

Otherwise, it is still piracy, and they're no better than the assemblers
who include an unauthorized copy of XP with their systems. I hope HCL
has the good sense to do the right thing here - it costs next to nothing to
do the right thing here, and set a good example.

In any event, the free-as-in-beer FC3 distro is arguably the best RH
distro ever, so why don't they just use that instead? There's plenty
of community support available for Fedora.

HCL or anyone else may redistribute free software with freedom.  RHEL
does respect this basic freedom, and merely asks the redistributor to
remove its trademarks while redistributing rhel, and the rhel
agreement makes this abundantly clear under these two terms:

<quote>
1. The Software. Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Applications
(the "Software") are either a modular operating system or application
consisting of hundreds of software components. The end user license
agreement for each component is located in the component's source
code. With the exception of certain image files identified in Section
2 below, the license terms for the components permit Customer to copy,
modify, and redistribute the component, in both source code and binary
code forms. This agreement does not limit Customer's rights under, or
grant Customer rights that supersede, the license terms of any
particular component.

2. Intellectual Property Rights. The Software and each of its
components, including the source code, documentation, appearance,
structure and organization are owned by Red Hat and others and are
protected under copyright and other laws. Title to the Software and
any component, or to any copy, modification, or merged portion shall
remain with the aforementioned, subject to the applicable license. The
"Red Hat" trademark and the "Shadowman" logo are registered trademarks
of Red Hat in the U.S. and other countries. This agreement does not
permit Customer to distribute the Software using Red Hat's trademarks.
Customer should read the information found at
ttp://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/ before distributing a
copy of the Software, regardless of whether it has been modified. If
Customer makes a commercial redistribution of the Software, unless a
separate agreement with Red Hat is executed or other permission
granted, then Customer must modify any files identified as
"REDHAT-LOGOS" and "anaconda-images" to remove all images containing
the "Red Hat" trademark or the "Shadowman" logo. Merely deleting these
files may corrupt the Software.

</quote>

The above gives freedom to redistribute rhel, and removing the
trademark image files is a task only for someone very anxious to
redistribute this particular distro.  There is never any question of
paying royalty for free software.  Assuming HCL/any_user has purchased
a subscription to RHEL, they are free to redistribute respecting the
above condition wrt trademark images, without paying any fees/royalty.

"Piracy" is commonly abused to refer to copyright infringements, but
in any case here, there could be "trade mark" infringement at the
worst, *if* there is any such redistribution of free software using RH
trademarks without their permission.  AFAIK, HCL is an OEM Partner of
RH, and even if people do ask for RHEL "support" - that should be
fairly easy to provide: RHEL subscription starts at around $6 per
month (Rs. 260) and should be no big deal to some one spending 9990 +
1250 on the hardware alone.  But all said, I seriously doubt if RHEL
is there in this picture at all.

Ramanraj,
As from your explanation, is it permissible for an
licenced owner of RHEL ( not just HCL but individual
owners) to redristribute RHEL, after removing the
specified files, logos etc. etc. from his copy of RHEL
??

friends.

Now, for MCA students, Linux Network Programming became a Theory and
Practical Lab paper. This is the nice time to take Linux to students
home. Most of the students have PC's in home. but they have Linux only
at colleges. So, if we contact the colleges and give a demo to the
students, Linux will reach the Home PC's quickly.

Yes.

Even if there is a licencing problem RH is perfectly capable of
defending its rights. Anyway, I dont think the guys at HCL would be
ignorant of these issues either.

Hmmm.. I havent heard of this processor much - is this the same as the
Cyrix processor of many years ago?? I had an old compaq machine with a
Cyrix MediaGX processor with a rating of 133MHz, but actually ran at
100MHz or 90MHz or something - performance wasn't very good though...

I don't think you even need to be a licensed owner. You can just
download RHEL from Redhat's site and redistribute it to your heart's
content - this is what distros like Whitebox or CentOS are doing.

RHEL (all versions) is available here for download:

ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/enterprise/

The "license" of RHEL is not a license to use the software, but a
support contract.

The performance of a VIA processor might not compare to an
Intel Celeron or AMD Athlon CPU. But its the cheapest IA32
processor that money can buy. For basic home users who intend
to use their PC for checking/sending e-mails, browsing the
internet, playing music and stuff, this processor is just fine.
Just that you can't expect to enjoy Quake3 Arena or Half Life at
high resolutions and higher fps on it.

Your question is not very clear. Are you looking to do a sql like
'delete *' ? BDB doesn't have a sql like interface. You have to go
through the records programmatically deleting each one. There are
utilities that come with BDB to dump database files. Again the
question is pretty vague.

Check out the BDB docs:

   The processor is *not* the same, although Via bought/licensed the IP core
of the Cyrix 6x86MX or M2 core, for some of the early Via C3 CPUs.
(The last processor built by Cyrix was an MMX Socket-7 CPU called the MII, 
comparable to a Pentium 233/MMX. Clock-for-clock, this is still the highest
performance x86 CPU ever built, but it never scaled beyond 300 MHz or so,
before Cyrix was acquired by National Semiconductor.)

   National Semiconductor then used the Cyrix M2 core in a line of embedded
x86 CPUs called the MediaGX and later the Geode. This line of
CPUs was later sold to AMD, which has enhanced the range with several
Athlon-core embedded x86 processors at clock speeds of over 1 GHz, consuming
a few Watts of power. These Geode NX CPUs are not pin-compatible with any
other consumer x86 CPUs, and require special motherboards to use them.
They're mostly used in embedded boxes, including Firewalls, Routers, SANs,
etc.

OTOH, the Via CPUs contain a core from Centaur Technology, which built
an excellent
low-power, small-die core family. The 1st generation of that core was a Socket-7
CPU called the Winchip, followed by the Winchip II. Both these came to market
too late to make an impact on the Socket-7 market, which was being phased
out by that time. However, the 3rd-generation Centaur core was used by
Via in a line of Socket-370 CPUs (compatible with the Celeron/PIII) called 
the Cyrix III (to indicate compatibility with the PIII socket-370). Apart from
the name, the CPU has nothing in common with the Cyrix M2 cores. IMHO, the
Via Cyrix III/C3 is an excellent performer at its price point - it
retailed for $15 when
the least expensive Celerons cost about $50, and easily blew away the Celerons
on most memory-intensive benchmarks, although they were only about half as 
fast on floating-point.

   The latest generation of the Via/Centaur CPUs is a Socket-478 (P4-compatible)
CPU that runs at up to 2 GHz, and uses a fraction of the power of the P4. It's
the most interesting Socket-478 CPU available, in that it has a HW cryptographic
coprocessor on the die. (Eventually, the Linux kernel CryptoAPI will support HW
acceleration.)

    The MediaGX was from National Semiconductor (see above), and was an
embedded x86 CPU, meant for set-top boxes, routers and the like. It was
never meant to be a desktop CPU, though that did not prevent some companies
from building low-end consumer desktops around it. These were mostly destined
for price-sensitive markets, and they were never meant to compete on
performance.

   The MediaGX has nothing in common with the Via C3 CPUs - the C3 is an
excellent performer for the price. Try a C3/733 to get an idea of the capability
of the Centaur core.

    I'd be perfectly happy to get a $15 Geforce4 MX card and use
the latest generation socket-478 Via CPU for gaming. I'd give even
odds that this will blow away an Intel CPU on an Intel integrated-
graphics motherboard like the i845/865/915 at a small fraction
of the cost.

   If you want high frame-rates, invest in a good GPU instead of
an expensive CPU. An inexpensive CPU + inexpensive but
good previous-gen GPU, can easily outperform a top-end CPU +
a crappy integrated graphics combination, at a fraction of the
cost.

   Yes, but Red Hat will definitely be unhappy if you copy the CDs
and redistribute them with their trademarked and copyrighted
material included.

   Red Hat has kindly supported the development of the Fedora
distribution, which is free as in speech as well as free
as in beer. Why is there any motivation to rip them off on their
Enterprise business, which is what is subsidising the development
of Fedora? 

   If we encourage piracy of RHEL, we'll be killing the Goose that
laid the Golden Eggs - in this case, the sponsorship of Fedora.

   In principle, you can download RHEL SRPMs and rebuild
them and install them. These, however, will not yield exactly
the same binaries as RHEL, unless they're built on a RHEL
system. You'll have a chicken-and-egg problem, which can take
a lot of work to resolve dependencies and bootstrap it
successfully (it's pretty hard to even bootstrap from RH9
to FC1 from SRPMs alone, leave alone RH9 to RHEL).

  Notwithstanding the enormity of the task, this has actually
been done by a number of people who have come out with
distros like Centos, WBEL, CERN Scientific Linux, Trustix,
etc.

The machine was a Compaq Presario 2100, if I am not mistaken, and was
one of the lowest priced branded solutions at that time(approx 7 or 8
years ago) - it had pretty much everything integrated into the mobo. I
bought it for approximately 65 to 70k just as it came out - which
turned out to be a bad decision, since a few months later a faster
version - 233MHz came out at a price of around 58k! If I had know
anything much about computers, I would've stayed away from both
these... I had lotsa problems trying to linux working on these
computers, partly b'cos of the weird hardware and partly b'cos of my
inexperience...

I think perhaps the FPU wasn't very good, and it didnt have as much as
L2 cache as a 100/133 MHz Intel Pentium. Trying to run Quake (1) did
not give very good performance when even compared to a 100MHz pentium.

Though otherwise the machine was stable and good as long as u didnt
push it too hard (running games and stuff) - in fact it was in running
condition until 2 months ago - running an age old flaky installation
of windows 95 in my dad's office...

Contaminating Free Software with trademarks or other proprietary
images are unwarranted and none can claim it as a right. From a strict
point of view, RH could be seen as violating the GPL, but, taking into
view its other substantial and generous contributions, probably many
would take only a very light view of the practice.

The vast majority out there need basic support and buy it out of sheer
need, to save time, labour and for many other reasons.  I do not know
what understanding prevails in the US, but atleast here, "service
contracts" are very well understood and those desiring to earn revenue
through support, should seriously think of plainly marketing "Service
Contracts".  Eureka Forbes has done a good job of educating people
about service contracts for vacuum cleaners/water filters through door
to door campaigns, and the nuances of a service contract are very well
understood here.  The Indian market is vast, and the opportunities are
many - enough to feed many a Goose ;)

This inspires me to rehaul my old VIA C3/733MHz box :-)

Which motherboard would you recommend to go with
VIA C3/733 MHz to get the best performance ? Currently,
I have an ASUS CUSI-FX board (SIS 630e chipset) and I find
it too slow for desktop usage when compared to my Compaq
Deskpro 4000 series (Pentium II/233 MHz machines).

I'm sorry for not being clear - this is precisely what I meant. I can
only download the SRPMs from that site, recompile and build ISOs and
distribute them.

Amen to that. I was in no way condoning piracy of RHEL. I (or rather,
my employer) pay a lot of money to Redhat for RHEL licenses, and I
have no intention of ripping them off in their enterprise business. My
point in the original post was that IF one is so inclined, one can
build the RHEL product line from the SRPMs provided, but that's the
extend of it.

Mind you, RHEL3 is perhaps the stablest, most rock-solid server-side
Linux distribution (or even x86 OS - with due apologies to the *BSD
people) out there currently. It is well worth the money you have to
pay for it.

So does that mean Linux itself is contaminating Free Software?

Why do you feel RH is violating the GPL?

AFAIK, the owner of Linux trademark has not imposed any conditions for
removing it while redistributing the kernel.  They do impose
restrictions, but I do not remember any of them having anything to do
with linux kernel itself or its redistribution.


> Why do you feel RH is violating the GPL?

Recently the issue came up at the gpl-violations.org mailing list: 
Links to the archives:

Possible Red Hat GPL Violation
http://lists.gpl-violations.org/pipermail/legal/2005-March/000050.html
http://lists.gpl-violations.org/pipermail/legal/2005-March/000049.html

http://lists.gpl-violations.org/pipermail/legal/2005-March/000047.html
http://lists.gpl-violations.org/pipermail/legal/2005-March/thread.html#56

The onerous conditions requiring licensees to remove their propreitary
stuff before redistribution are needless and certainly against the
terms and spirit of the GPL.  I'll take Siva's word that the task is
not an easy one, and such terms/devices to curb redistribution are
plainly violative of the GPL and against the very  spirit of our
movement.

RH has made significant contributions to the free software movement,
and that makes it more difficult to understand the rationale behind
the RHLE practice: they contradict themselves here.

Tech Tip from LJ :-

When writing a program that plays audio using gstreamer, make sure to
use the user's configured output method, which could be OSS, ALSA or a
sound daemon such as ESD or JACK. You don't need to look up the user's
preference, simply make a "gconfaudiosink" and set your player's audio
sink to it, for example, where the variables "sink" and "play" are
both pointers to GstElement:

 sink = gst_element_factory_make("gconfaudiosink", "sink");
 play = gst_element_factory_make("playbin", "play");
 g_object_set (G_OBJECT (play), "audio-sink", sink, NULL);

For more info on developing applications with gstreamer, see the
GStreamer documentation:
http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/.

HTH :)

If I remember correctly, the task is ridiculously easy. All it takes
is to dump the CD into local filesystem, remove the offending packages
(there are two - redhat-logos & anaconda-images), rebuild
base/comps.xml (I think just remove the lines that refer to these two
packages) and base/hdlist (tools to build this file are included in
the anaconda package), and recreate the ISO file. The procedure is
entirely similar to adding non-Redhat RPM packages to a Redhat
installation CD and is documented all over the net.

Simple redistributions without forcing modifications should be
allowed: destroying that basic freedom is unpardonable.

But that is allowed, isn't it? You can download the whole thing as
SRPMs and redistribute them. That basic freedom is not "destroyed".

If what you are saying is that "I downloaded the ISOs, so I should be
able to distribute the ISOs", then I do not agree with you. Looking
into the GPL once again, I find:

<quote>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</quote>

Thus, what Redhat is doing seems to me is very well within the letter
and spirit of the GPL.

Prof. KalyanaKrishnan R and his team (IIT-Madras) done a wonderful
job to implement the MultiLingual Indian systems.  
URL: http://acharya.iitm.ac.in/

One Day One Command 
===================

install -- Copy files and set attributes.

Summary:

'install' will copy single/multiple source(s) to destination, sets
permission modes & owner/group and take backup of existing files. It
is very useful for writing the install scripts.

Examples:

$ install myfile Dir1 -- Copy myfile to Dir1 with same name.

$ install myfile test -- Copy myfile to test.

$ install -b myfile test -- Copy myfile to test. If test is already 
                            exists, then take a backup (test~).

$ install -b -S.bak myfile test -- Same as above. But backup file will 
                                  created with .bak suffix (test.bak).

$ install --backup=t myfile test -- Take numbered backups (test.~1~).

$ install -p myfile test -- Preserve the access and modification time, 
                            while copying the file.

$ install -m 444 myfile test -- Copy myfile with specified permission 
                                mode. Default is 755.

$ install -g newgrp myfile test -- Copy myfile and set GID is newgrp.

$ install -s mybin test.bin -- Strip the symbol tables from installed 
                               binary executables.

We are only concerned if we can freely redistribute free software
without modifications, and not concerned with iso's or other packaging
material.  The RHEL license clearly imposes onerous conditions
requiring the licensee to make modifications to the software before
redistribution, and the following clause does not save the violation.

It only seems to give handles to people to call others "pirates",
"criminals" etc. and that hurts the spirit.

RHEL does not require the licensee to make modifications to software -
what modifications are you talking about, to which piece of software
included in RHEL? The source code is redistributable without
encumbrances. I really can't understand what the problem is with that.
None of the terms of the GPL or any other license is being violated
here.

Well, hardly Redhat's fault, isn't it?

I'm curious what your take on SuSE Enterprise Linux is.

RedHat is doing a perfect FS business model. We should encourage this type
of business IMHO. For those who want every thing to be free ( as in free
speech/free beer ) there is Debian ... always free.

   The Media GX (with its integrated Northbridge and other peripherals)
is well supported in the 2.4 kernels and later, but there may have been
problems with the 2.2 kernels. I run Routerlinux (www.routerlinux.com)
on a GCT/Allwell 1030 set-top box, which has a MediaGX CPU. It's
an excellent 24/7/365 firewall/router/NAT/ipsec platform.

   I've used a Biostar M6VLA (Via PLE133 with integrated
Trident Blade graphics) with good results, but not for gaming.
This is a relatively inexpensive low-end board that's widely
available locally. It is excellent for day-to-day desktop use
and is rock stable with Redhat 7.3, and I've built two boxes 
with this combo (one for a friend, and one for myself). It's
possible to build a fanless box with this combo if you use a
heavy Thermaltake heatsink and/or underclock it to 100 FSB.

  However, it lacks an AGP slot, so you'll have to use a PCI
graphics accelerator if you want to try it out for gaming. I
believe that there's some supply of GeForce2 MX boards
for about Rs.1250 available, but YMMV.

  The other alternative is to use a Shuttle FV24/FV25 in
a small form-factor (SFF) box like the Shuttle SV-24. These
are not available locally, but it's one of the smallest
footprint full-featured x86 boxes ever built.

   You can install the FC3 glibc-2.3.3 RPMs, but you'll break userland and
leave the system in a semi-usable state. The main issue is that rpm will
also break, and until you restore rpm, you won't be able to install/remove
packages. I've done this upgrade successfully for RH 7.3, and I'll post
the basic sequence of steps in due course after I'm convinced that it
it's reasonably foolproof.

   The simplest alternative is simply to do an upgrade installation of FC3 -
this takes care of all the dependency resolution automatically. The main
downside is that it messes up the GUI and so on - but most of this
can be taken care off by performing custom package selection before the
upgrade.

Dear Thyagu,
I have reformated my machine and reinstalled Windows & Ubuntu linux.
The prolem still exists....

So far I have checked using Windows XP. ( I face different problem
with Ubuntu - I could not configure the BSNL broadband connection
using Ubuntu, right now trying to resolve that)

In windows XP, when connected to BSNL broadband, I am still facing the
same problem. I could not connect to thamizha.com using BSNL
broadband. It says timeout error.

Whereas I am able to connect to other websites.
Please let me know if i need to check anything else. 

I also request others in this list who use BSNL broadband,  to help to
check if they are able to access http://thamizha.com and
http://mugunth.tamilblogs.com websites from your end.

Regards,
Mugunth

Suppose X has paid and duly obtained RHEL from RH, X should be free to
simply redistribute, say gcc binaries he has now received from RHEL to
third parties under the terms of the GPL.  RH has imposed conditions
that say that redistibution should not be done without removing its
trademarks.  In the first place, why should X be searching and nit
picking  proprietary contaminations RH has introduced?  That very
condition is onerous and clearly violates the GPL.  Further, supposing
RH trademarks are embedded into gcc binaries, that will totally
prevent X from redistributing the gcc binaries he has received from
RH.

> I'm curious what your take on SuSE Enterprise Linux is.

I was using SuSE (7.0 Professional) for more than 5 years, and I would
rank it as the best distro I have used so far.  YaST did a wonderful
job of detecting devices, installing, configuring software. YaST was
plainly proprietary then, but now it is released under the GPL. The
SuSE box included one dvd with 1600 applications, and well written
documentation. I could say this much about SuSE.

I really don't know what is so special about the "Enterprise" - I'll
update as soon as I get to it ;)

Those who don't respect freedom to share code are non-entities in the
free software world,  and there is no question of encouraging them.

That is simply not true. There are no Redhat trademarks in the gcc
package that RH distributes. X can just take the gcc package and
redistribute them WITHOUT making any modifications - just copy
/mnt/cdrom/gcc-*.rpm /var/ftproot, for example. Nothing else is
required of X. Ditto for all the other GPL'ed packages.

This is your misconception. There are no Redhat trademarks embedded
into gcc binaries. If there were, then Redhat would be in violation of
the GPL.

That is nice. You trash one Enterprise distro, and praise the other -
I cannot see any difference between them in terms of pricing or
support :)

It is a matter of ISV support, IMO.

Dear Linux Guys,

   How to create RPM from PHP source.
   Even PHP 4.4 is also enough for me. I need RPMs since I feel

RHEL typically will not release a different major release of a piece
of software. If it started with PHP4, you will get only PHP4 for its
entire lifetime. I consider this a good thing :)

You can try rebuilding the SRPMs from Rawhide. The ones you are
looking for are available at:

ftp://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/development/SRPMS/php-5.0.4-10.3.src.rpm

I have already tried with php-5.0.4-10.3.src.rpm and got many
dependency problems.

Is there PHP 4.4 src rpm any where. I googled it but not able to find. 

>From php.net site i downloaded php-4.4.0.tgz and in the source they
have a file "makerpm". Running that create mod_php-4.4.0.rpm. Is this
compatible with php rpm already installed in this machine. How to
create PHP RPM from PHP 4.4.0 source.

Then, why add stupid clauses asking licensees to search and remove RH
trademark images before redistributing files?  It is pointless to
continue this any further. Anyway, before leaving this thread, for the
sake of completeness, I'll finish with a snip from 
www.xenitisgroup.com which also announced a PC for Rs. 9790 on the
same day HCL made its announcement:

   Those are pretty nifty specs. If the CPU is a Prescott 
Celeron D, it's a pretty nice CPU, and it can always be
upgraded to a P4 in a couple of years after prices get decimated
further due to competition from Via and AMD.

There are no such stupid clauses. The only thing Redhat restricts you
from doing is cp /mnt/cdrom/*.rpm /var/ftproot/ - they require you to
remove anaconda-images.rpm and redhat-logos.rpm. You are even told the
names of the RPMs beforehand. I find your use of "stupid" here
revolting - have you even used or read through their licensing
agreement of RHEL to pass judgement so summarily?

Of course. I can see that.

I think the GPL requires that you do not include proprietary binaries
in the same distribution media. One is free to distribute such
binaries in a separate media (CD/DVD) and they can even  be packaged
along with GPLed binaries containing CD/DVD in the same box. So if
Suse is distributing propreitary binaries along with other GPL code in
a single DVD, they are the ones who are violating the GPL!!

The best thing I would suggest is rute`s tutorial.[Search in google]
This is one good free material available to start from dare basics.

All the features that you mentioned are working fine for me. If you
want I can send you screenshots. I'm using Fedora Core 4 and Firefox

folks,

I am using R.H Linux-8, and the FireFox 1.0.2 version of the browser and i 
am not able to see any of the tamil fonts in it. ( not only the link, but 
any of the tamil sites )
I have set the charecter encoding to Userdefined in my browser and still not 
able to get any tamil fonts. Any help would be appreciated. Should i need to 
install any tamil fonts? if so, let me know any tamilfonts which was 
successfully used in linux.

Cheers,
Srikrishnan

I would recommend the following site to start with:
     http://www.icon.co.za/~psheer/book/index.html.gz

Then, you can browse through online documentation (or download them)
 from the following website:
     http://www.tldp.org/


The following books are a few good ones that I recommend (if you
want to learn Linux not inclined to a specific distro, i.e.):

     * Linux Administration Handbook (the green book)
         - Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder and Trent R. Hein.

     * Running Linux (an O'Reilly series book)
         - Matt Welsh, Matthias Kalle Dalheimer and Lar Kaufman.

     * Linux Power tools (Sybex publishers)
         - Roderick w. Smith.

Search for the above titles on amazon.com to know more. Of course,
there are many more good books and excellent websites that others
would recommend :-).

Good luck!

Try this:
download the tamil font from the site.
copy it in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/TTF
run the command "mkfontdir"
restart xfs "service xfs restart"

this worked for me on dinamani site.

Thanks for the suggestion, but I've been on Debian for the past two years,
with satisfaction. Since this book is by Debian developers themselves, I
thought it'd be nice to see it.

You could use "checkinstall" to create an rpm from the source code.

But most of the Vulnerability that are found in the older version are fixed 
up in the current version 2.0.17. Still I agree the fact phpBB is not 100% 
secure. But that should not stop the option of using it in our site.

Of course it should. Why would anyone want to run known insecure
software on his/her website?

You didn't read the links I sent. Quote:

"The assumption many people make is that if so many vulnerabilities are
constantly discovered on this software, it can be assumed that there
still are many left and this application must thus be considered
insecure in general."

That is reason enough for me to not even go near phpBB :)

Be aware that You are "Top-Posting" instead of "Bottom-Posting"

I am also a DataOne BBand user. I also, face the same problem of
timeout when connecting to
http://thamizha.com &
http://mugunth.tamilblogs.com

I checked out with Ethereal Packet capture, and found that the packet
crosses my interface. When i ping, I get their IP address to be

70.85.187.98

for both sites. There is no name resolving problem. I checked with
megaproxy.com and find that there is  no problem in accessing these
sites. So, It has to be a problem at the Gateway, which is filtering
this IP or something like that.

When i tried with nmap. It gave the following msg,

All 1660 scanned ports on laurier.genwebhost.com (70.85.187.98) are: filtered
Too many fingerprints match this host to give specific OS details

See the name of the site it indicates.
laurier.genwebhost.com

Once again I get timeout when connecting to that site. But, when I
visited genwebhost.com, it gave me a test page, indicating that they
have installed TLS/SSL. This site runs on Apache server with modSSL.
So, the problem can be at DataOne gateway or at the filtered Server .

 yea.. your right i missed to read out one of the link you send coz my proxy 
is stopping me to move forward with that link.
 Anyhow if assumptions go on then even we will not be able to run a site... 
not only phpBB. This is what i feel in my opnion. Since there is no software 
which is 100% secure... Almost every software has vulnerabilities that are 
discovered and patched there and then...

The point is that phpBB's vulnerabilities are discovered so
frequently. The argument is the same that a lot of people used against
sendmail in the 1990's, and is used against IIS/IE/Exchange/sundry
Microsoft products even today.

It is not as if phpBB is the only forum software out there. Look for
alternatives.

 Just tried to read about other options... While doing a search I found that 
even other alternatives too have the vulnerabilities... such as Simple 
Machine Forums, Invision Power Board... may be i've missed out some others?

You still don't get it. It is not a question of having vulnerabilities
- as you said, every non-helloworld program will have some. The
question is about the developers' receptiveness to vulnerabilities,
their speed in fixing them and their acceptance of secure coding
standards. phpBB has failed in all these counts so far, in the opinion
of a lot of people who know about these things.

Message-ID: <42F3836B.2080607@gmail.com>

Hi all,
first ive downloaded new mesa drivers and want to know whether its safe 
to install, i mean i would have to overwrite a few files and am not sure 
whether its safe has enyone installed mesa successfully without any 
problems, i had downloaded the source tarball

and regarding the phpBB forum i think its perfectly safe, all it needs 
is a mod called LDAP mod and then security issues will be a snap, also 
the vulnerabilty exists only with the default template, installing a new 
theme answers some of the security features,
also if u use mamboplus u need not HAVE separate uids and so database 
management for the webmasters becomes a snap, u can login with the same 
id in both the websites, mailing lists and the forums and thats cool, 
what do u think guyz,

regards,

Those are pretty nifty specs. If the CPU is a Prescott 
Celeron D, it's a pretty nice CPU, and it can always be
upgraded to a P4 in a couple of years after prices get decimated
further due to competition from Via and AMD.


one of the news says the sub 10K pc has a cyrix 1gigs processor. if it is so, then it wont be worth buying it, isn't it?

Hi,

For those who have webpage not downloading in firefox, its because of
your profiles might be corrupted. if you are using Firefox on Windows
XP/ windows 2000 then go to
C:\Documents and Settings\[useraccount]\Application Data and delete
the folder firefox directory under mozilla.

for those who are using windows 98 delete all the files related to the
firefox, but take a back of plugins, components, extensions folder
back up.

Yes sure, we need something like this in chennai. This will surely be

Yeah you are right. These guys are really capable. Particularly SIFY with
its reach to mass can do that. Sify has proved its commitment to free

short  talk  on Free  Software  User Groups  as  member  of ILUGC  and
FSF-India.  The  Principal of the College was  very enthusiastic about
the NRC  plans and  highlighted the self-employment  possibilities and
other  opportunities  available  with  free software.   Less  than  10
students knew about Gnu/Linux OS, and  much less had even heard of RMS
or Linus Torvalds.  At the end,  about half of them raised their hands
when asked if  they would opt for the FOSS  Elective the next semester
:)

I wish  NRC could  organise these awareness  programs on the  style of
LDD's organised by ilugc as one day events more like an open house for
one and all,  including the public also.  Notes about  one such LDD is
at:    http://www.chennailug.org/meeting/minutes/yr2004/momlf2004.html
and the archives have more such stories.

If there is atleast one  Free Software User Group, in each Engineering
College, it could benefit many. 

Rick Moen  has written  an excellent and  useful user group  HOWTO at:
http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/User-Group-HOWTO.html

<quote>
"[The] movement has no central structure, bureaucracy, or other entity
to direct its  affairs. While this situation has  advantages, it poses
challenges  for  allocation of  human  resources, effective  advocacy,
public relations, user education, and training."
</quote>

Again,

<quote>
Linux works precisely  because people are free to come  and go as they
please:   Free  programmers  are   happy  programmers   are  effective
programmers.
</quote>

Academic freedom and coding  freedom make good companions. User Groups
when  organised  in  Colleges  maintaining  the core  essence  of  the
movement, it could solve many other problems too:

-Education would become directly relevant to needs in society
-Enables life-long continuity for students to update themselves
-Better interaction with Public is possible
-Knowledge based societies would become a reality

That apart, many colleges are  using proprietary packages and there is
a need  to replace existing  proprietary software with  free software.
Let us please have a wiki page at ILUGC to list "equivalents".  HTH.  

Thanks,
Ramanraj.

My View:

I am sure that google will not go the pay way. since they are not like
other companies that. they are truely user concentrated and much more
user friendly. to prove this, you can a variety of products they
released which are for users, and their benefits, businessess.

If they do that, you either pay or look at alternatives (which are all
very inferior at the moment).

Spying is too harsh a word to use, and also which of these alternate
search engines don't do that?

Vivek, on behalf  of Sarai, attended the UoM  workshop on TRIPs Treaty
at Chennai. He gave a picture of the movement in Delhi. I also had the
opportunity to  meet Ravikanth  & Arthi from  Sarai at  the Trivandrum
FSFS meet.  A  lot of useful work is done by  Sarai to promote serious
studies touching upon the social dimensions of free software.

<quote from http://www.sarai.net/freesoftware/freesoftware.htm>
The  free  exchange of  code,  information  and  cultural products  is
central to our conception of  the digital public domain. In societies,
where hierarchy,  inequality and  control influence the  production of
ideas, a free software culture is worth fighting for.
</quote>

If  you   are  a  student,  interested  in   researching  say  "Kiosks
vs. PDA's", probably Sarai is one of the best places in India for such
studies. ( http://www.sarai.net/community/student_stipend.htm )

Hi Folks,
              This month's (Aug. 2005) Digit magazine has the ISOs
of Fedora Core 4 included in the DVD. These are 4 CDROM ISOs,
which are useful for those of us who don't have bootable DVD

Not tested yet, but the sha1sums are correct so I expect the CDs

Sigh. Nobody in the present generation seem to be even aware of the
world's biggest source of knowledge, Usenet.

Well, one search does not make summer. You should be refining your
search anyway. On the other hand, for any search term, I find Yahoo's
first results screen full of advertising content.

Talking about quality of search results, ever tried searching a LUG
mailing list archives hosted on Yahoo Groups? One of the reasons I
moved couple of lists I own to Google.

Now if Google comes up with an instant messenger, I can be rid of
Yahoo once and forever :)

Message-ID: <20050808074915.29194.qmail@web50210.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

I would like to thank Hariram Aatreya for the
opportunity given to me to accompany Murali,
Chandrasekhar, and Venkatesh from the AU-KBC center,
Madras Institute of Technology for the FLOSS road show
to Bannari Amman Institute of Technology,
Sathyamangalam, Tamil Nadu, India on August 6, 2005. 

The faculty, management and students were very much
interested in GNU/Linux, and are planning to start a
GLUG and increase their activities with GNU/Linux.
Representatives from 7 different colleges in and
around Sathyamangalam had also come for the workshop.

On the way back we checked out the FLOSS lab at Kongu
Engineering College, Erode and the projects they had
been working on. I must thank them for staying back
till 8 in the night as we finished late in the evening
at Bannari Amman Institute of Technology. 

Kongu Engineering College LUG started with 6 members
in 2003, and it has now grown to 170 members from all
the departments. They meet every week. A former
student (just graduated), Arvind Kalyan, was
responsible for taking the initiative in 2003.
Professors (like Prof. Jayapathi, HOD, CSE department)
and the management provided the support for the FOSS
activities, and continue to do so. The juniors are now
continuing the tradition :). They have also agreed to
collaborate with Bannari Amman Institute of Technology
for FOSS projects. Hopefully, KEC's mailing list will
be up and running soon.

You can view the photos of the trip and the workshop
from here:

I request those people who are conducting workshops to
kindly update the details here:

Best regards,

NRCF-FOSS at AU-KBC MIT organised a FOSS awarness session in Jaya
Engg College,Thirunindravur,Chennai.

I spoke on behalf of ILUGC, about Opensource,Linux and LUG.

The response was very good, especially question answer session which
lasted about 45 minutes. The college already has a functioning LUG
for nearly 3 months now. They are in the process of setting up a FOSS
lab with 60systems. 

The students and faculty are very enthusiastic about open source.

About 250 students attended the seminar.

Prof.Ramanan from AU-KBC answered many questions and also spoke about
the benefit to student in doing projects on FOSS.

Ms.Padmapriya and Senthil Anand of FOSS Centre did the intro to FOSS
and the proposed elective subject.

Thanks to NRCF-FOSS.

Dear all,

Yesterday I had a discussion with a management of SCS Matric school
in Chromepet. The school is organising a science exhibition to their
students and their parents on 15th Aug. 

They have requested ILUGC to participate in the same. We will get
about 2-3 computers to demo opensource softwares related to
education. I am in the process of requesting them to allow general
public between 3pm-5pm for this demo.

Since, this is going to be a small show, we need about 4-5 volunteers
only. Right now me and Mr.Baskar have stared the ground work. I
request 2 or 3 people to join me.

They have also agreed to organise one day training workshop to
teachers in association with Lions Club.It will be somewhere during
third week of september 2005.

About this school: It is located in Nehru Nagar,Chromepet a
residential are. The now defunct demo-schools project of ILUGC
members was first started here 2002.

I am glad you all paid a visit :) I wish I could have joined too, but
as I already told you I was involved in training people on OSS
alternatives in one embedded systems company - the details of which I
will post in another e-mail for completeness.


> They have also agreed to

Yes, this is important for the betterment of the community and hence
for the students of both colleges.

> Hopefully, KEC's mailing list will be up and running soon.

I am eagerly looking forward for it too. Since it has been quite a
while, I think I need to do take an initiative and ask them to atleast
set up an alternative if they foresee a considerable delay even
further.

Is it ok to add training events like the one I conducted last week? Or
is it only non-commercial events?

Hi,

    I thank the management and the engineers at the Trioz
Technologies, Coimbatore for giving me an opportunity to take a
training session on the above mentioned field.

    Among other nifty details, the following major areas were covered:
nfsroot and cross development on targets such as x86 and ARM with
relevance to embedded systems - including tools and libraries needed.

    Though I didn't go into the specifics of ARM, they were quick
enough to bring up a x86 target themselves; these new recruits were
purely embedded people with very little exposure to Linux at any
level. I am sure that after being exposed to Embedded Linux they now
have more options at their disposal.

    The programme was for 7 days with 10 hours a day (Morning 7am to
evening 5pm) officially.

    As a sidenote, they had some nice boards down there and I was
trying my best to get my hands dirty - variations of ARM/PPC cores.

 Ya, really tough to imagine. Most people learn Linux only because of
 this. Every beginner keeps facing hurdles at all places and googles
 for hos problem and gets going. 

 Probably some other search engine will take it's place. But "Google"
 is so much built into our lives to the extent that "googling" is
 understood by almost everybody who knows a fair bit about
 computers. May be "Google" can be replaced but not that word in the
 dictionary.

 As always Change is inevitable.

Bye!

You should link libjavaplugin_oji.so to plugins sub-dir under mozilla
installation. For example, if you have installed mozilla-firefox at
/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox, you should copy this .so to
/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/ dir.

If you wish to enable it to a particular user alone, link it to
$HOME/.mozilla/plugins dir. Alternatively, you can copy the .so file
to the plugins dir. Finally, you should restart mozilla-firefox to
enable it.

flash:
If i remember right on top of my head, there is an extension which
would install libflashplayer.so to $HOME/.mozilla/plugins dir. Google
for more details.

Hi,

I started a LUG in Sri Ramakrishna Engg College by jan 2005 and still
its a mail list
This is the LUG iam talking about

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/srec-lug/

the strength is around twenties and 50% studs and 50% linux
enthusiasts from outside the college. I wanted to have a formal
inaguration of this LUG in college premises as soon as possible
atleast before sept 10th. For that I wil be confronted by the
following questions by the authorities.

-> wat is the benifit that the stud gets?
-> wat is the benifit that the college gets by having a LUG?
-> why LUG?

and similar other questions and monetary benifits too come before the
authorities. Iam sure that they wont allow if its just going be a
discussion and teaching LUG since they hate to work for free, without
any benifits.

My openions doesnt matter much there, so i need some kind of practical
example in this regard.

I wanted to convince or somehow compromise them to have LUG working
there, so that juniors get benifitted from this and have more
awareness  about GNU and Linux.

And i would tell that less than 10% would have known about linux and
related things. Iam talking about students there.

Anyone who would try to help me in this regard, please let me know wat
can be done..

The main object of a Free Software User Group in a College would be to
introduce strudents to the Gnu/Linux Operating System, Free Software
Applications, insights into how Free Software projects are created,
maintained and distributed.  An understanding of these would make the
student a free software user, and may be encourage him/her to think of
a suitable final year project to fulfill both academic requirements,
and to exhibit skills learnt and acquired during the course.

> -> wat is the benifit that the college gets by having a LUG?

The reason for having a LUG in the first place is the availability of
Free Software. Many colleges are using proprietary software at the
moment, and they pay for the licenses through their nose. Many are
migrating to installing Free Software on all their systems, and as
that happens, a FSUG is merely a natural requirement.  The college
would save substantially on license fees, and besides, they have the
opportunity to teach better since free software comes with source
code.

They must be knowing that:
Without LEarning there could be no Earning for professionals :)

FSUGs in colleges would mainly aid newbies  to learn about free
software that would be of use for the rest of their life.

> Iam sure that they wont allow if its just going be a
> discussion and teaching LUG since they hate to work for free, without

That attitude suits unskilled labourers fine, but not professionals
who have a duty to encourage  students to learn and acquire useful
skills and knowledge.

If this is about earning directly from out of a FSUG, then, probably
the College could be charging small monthly subscriptions for
memberships to cover incidental expenses, if the rules allow for it.

Linux-Advocacy HOWTO.

Back in 2002 I spent more than 4 months to get a base of 6 students
for backup. I also used this period to influence the college about the
advantages of Linux and others OSS products (like FreeBSD, etc).
Somehow they preferred to stay with Linux and the GNU base as it was
more userfriendly in their perspective. Also because of the hype from
the media.

I personally helped a whole department lab (EIE) to move onto Linux.
Gave them an environment they hadn't seen before (a simple NFS/NIS
network for whole of their department). Many were impressed. The heat
caught on. We introduced KLUG in Feb 2003. Students started coming in.
We had classes. We helped people move to Linux by being support
personnel.

And then it was not 'me' anymore. There were bunch of people who were
constantly using Linux. They were also willing to help others get used
to Linux which was misconceived as something difficult to use. To be
more precise, I helped a few of my class mates avoid using Win32 right
from second year so they are kind of uneasy when confronted with
Win32.

We conducted seminars, awareness programmes, quizzes, we celebrate
birthday of Linux kernel, etc.

To say the least - it was a process. It's not easy to impress the
management in a couple of hours, or even a day about the advantages of
OSS. If they are so aloof from the happenings of the IT industry, they
might be really hesitant for changes.

You might want to try going through Linux-Advocacy HOWTO. It tries to
help you in situations such as these.

Hi all,

I will offer a different perspective. I am not the typical LUG guy. I like 
Linux but also appreciate the effort that has gone into Windows (or any 
other end-user OS for that matter). What fascinates me at the end of the day 
is more the business side of things. I appreciate technology but I think 
more from an end-user point of view.

Trying to answer your questions below - 
Lets think of the typical Linux business model. I know several companies 
exist that have gone the distro route but I a sure most of the business on 
the Linux end are services. When it comes down to services then it is people 
that matter. In today's information age we need intelligent, knowledgeable 
and versatile people and that too by the lakhs. Many say that the world is 
moving to an opensource era. So Linux is an essential tool for 
survival/improved prospects for the guys graduating now. 

Further, if the college strives for more money, the way they can do that is 
to have more students coming in and willing to pay the big bucks. And one 
way to that is to get more campus recruitments happening and colleges with 
an active LUG would probably appeal to corporates (especially in the Linux 
domain and even otherwise) because it shows the technology maturity of the 
students and indicates that they are not strait-jacketed to one technology 
only. And as someone else pointed out, adoption of free software might save 
them some bucks at the end of the day and they can have it maintained for 
free by the LUG if it is active. 

At the end of the day Linux just broadens your mind and introduces you to a 
whole new vibrant and fascinating community that is willing to share and 
grow together rather than a dog eat dog scenario typically found elsewhere.

HTH.

You gotta be kidding me. What is your profession?

1. Check my presentation on "Careers with GNU/Linux"

http://www.shakthimaan.com -> Downloads

2. Check the database of companies:

http://www.shakthimaan.com -> Database

To SREC:

Most people are ignorant. They don't have the exposure
to the outside world. What you need to do is
collaborate with our GLUGS (nearby or far) and bring
in people to talk about what they have been doing, and
how it has been beneficial to them. 

At Bannari Amman Institute of Technology, few colleges
had come from Coimbatore for the workshop. So, why
weren't you aware of it? This link was updated long
time back:

http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/Events

Arvind Kalyan was at Coimbatore for the past one
month? You could have contacted him or atleast asked
in the mailing list? This is the real problem.
Ignorance. Unless we learn to "network" and "ask", it
will be very difficult to get contacts or learn and do
so something productive. Remember, contacts are very,
very important in the industry.

I am sure you can definitely bring in folks from KEC,
Erode or other nearbly GLUGS to address your college.

Just my thoughts,

SK

No dont copy the plugin to the mozilla's plugin directory. It will
crash firefox. Instead create a soft link.

ln -s /usr/java/jre1.5.0_03/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so
./libjavaplugin_oji.so

considering your java (jdk or jre) at /usr/java/....
Try this command from your mozilla's plugin dir.

Hoo, i have copied the plugin to my mozilla's plugin directory. I am
using it for the past couple of months without any issues. Soft link
seems to be wise as well.

I should have been more explicit but I thought most guys would understand 
what I said. Anyways, what I meant was that the software services industry 
(whatever be the designation or the domain) is going to provide the majority 
of technical jobs in the near future and that guys need to build up 
awareness/experience in IT per se, to be able to compete well in the job 
market. I did not specifically mention that other jobs/roles do not or will 
not exist that require Linux/FLOSS experience.

Hope that clears the issue.

Hi All,
I am trying my hand on the Xandros OS (which is provided in the CD of
LinuxForYou August 2005 issue ).
Its seems to be very ideal Linux for beginners. It was able to
automatically detect most of the hardware installed in my PC including
the ADSL modem provided by BSNL.

But I could not make connection to BSNL broadband using their GUI
tool. I am yet to investigate it further.

I like to know if anyone in this list have used Xandros OS to connect
successfully to BSNL Dataone broadband. If so please share your
experience with Xandros + BSNL Dataone.

Thanks & Regards,
Mugunth

In office, I cant use Linux. I wanted to see the "Cath and Bazaar" tamil
version. I did the following and I was able to read it in my office M$
widoze m/c.

Copied the tamil unicode SooriyanDotCom.ttf from
http://www.sooriyan.com/font/ and put that in c:/winnt/fonts directory.

Copied the text(which ofcourse were mostly boxes) of the web page having
the tamil version of "cath and bazaar" and pasted in the M$ Word.

Selected the text and applied the newly put "SooriyanDotCom.ttf" font over
that.

Could now read the document in tamil in MS word/windows.

Some others who dont have access to Linux pc at office/xwindows can use
the above to read the web page.

In windows it depends on which version of windows OS you have.

If you have Windows XP, you dont need to anything at all.
Just open utf-8 encoding tamil pages in firefox or IE browser, you
will be able to see tamil characters.

For other versions of Windows OS, you may follow the above mentioned
method to read the pages.

This is becas i wasnt at the coimbatore for a month and i wasnt able

due to my personal activities i had to leave that and chk for the next
move.

>

I thought he was there for 10 days for the training programme there.
Since iam stil not in coimbatore iam not in a position to make that possible

Now i jus saw the srec-lug mail list and one of the studs there asked
about the LUG thing to HOD and he was telling there was no lab
technician to set up gnu/linux lab. Well i jus know the installation
works. If any of you could jus help me with how to go around for the
lab installation i can talk with HOD for the same.

Bharathi, I wil contact HOD and let you know more about the talks.
If you have anymore sugessions please let me know.

thanks,
Archu.

Yes 10 days. I would have stayed if you wanted me too. May be next time :)

Train a couple of students to take charge. They inturn will help the
technicians over a period of time.

Changing the operating systems in college labs should not be done in a
day or even a week. People seldom like large scale changes.

Couple of systems first. Then couple of systems in a couple of labs.
Make sure your 'crew' is very familiar with the most frequently
encountered issues. Then 'Linuxize' one of the labs completely,
tabulate the alternatives for the software expected in that lab (ie,
if it is C programming lab, have a notice of some sort that tells them
to use vi, gcc and tools with also the example commands)

Leave a gap of few days. During your LUG meet ask them what were the
issues the users (staff/students) faced. You can not expect all the
users to come to your LUG meet. So your 'crew' should visit the lab
once in a while and ask if there were any issues, note them down if
they themselves are not familiar with that situation. Then during the
meet the issues need to be discussed and solutions must be formulated
on printed material so that the staff can go through them at their
leisure.

Through out the various stages of migration, never talk to anyone with
the motive of eradicating Win32 - even if that thought lingers deep
within. Tell them how OSS is beneficial and let them decide if they
want to continue using Win32 or move on to OSS. This is the purpose of
awareness programmes. Please time them appropriately and have someone
experienced in these things to help you organize them if you are
concerned.

Apart from the above situation, there are quite a few issues you will
face while trying to migrate. Unless your college staff/students never
use the lab, it could be an ordeal to get the whole college know what
exactly is this Linux thing and to get linux installed even as a dual
boot.

Have a very crisp and clear objective why you want to move on to OSS.
The person or the bunch of people involved in this activities are
usually confronted with a lot of questions from many perspectives. So
to answer them without discrepencies in the stated objectives you must
be clear with the details. Frequent discussions with your mates and
outside people will come to your rescue at this point.

If you have even one person who is able to plan well and handle the
people's questions the right way, you should be able to infiltrate the
usage of OSS in your college.

After this comes your ability to handle people's problems. "Hey, I am
unable to install Linux on my computer! It doesn't work!" You can not
ask them to go online and read the man pages. Not every one is a
computer science engineer. If it is a EEE student, ask one of your CSE
juniors to help them. Delegation is essential. When you give someone a
bit of responsibility, they feel recognized and important. Ultimately
they will try spending more time in learning and trying to help. They

Subject: [Ilugc] Fedora Core 4: Another mini-review
Message-ID: <a8f990120508100508764aaafe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,
            I just upgraded an existing FC3 installation on a Dell Inspiron
P3/700 notebook to FC4, and here are my first impressions after playing
with it for about a day:

1. It is faster than FC3 in most areas: Booting to the login prompt, X
    startup, text scrolling within xterm, general desktop responsiveness,
    system shutdown. About 10-30% quicker overall, which is nothing 
    short of miraculous - given that this comes for free, and seems to be
    rock stable (so far).

2. Everything 'just worked' in my upgrade installation, except the audio
   (maestro3). I had to manually tweak /etc/modprobe.conf to get alsa to
    recognise the audio (perhaps it might have worked perfectly if I'd
    done a fresh install instead of an upgrade).

3. Existing binary RPMs from FC3 will mostly work on FC4 with minimal
    dependency problems - the situation is reminiscent of the transition
    from RH 7.3 to RH 8, but without the hairy bugs. 

4.  The gcc-4.0.0 compiler is more picky and will generate fresh errors
    that were undetected by gcc-3.4.x. Therefore, some earlier SRPMs
    and kernels will not build on an FC4 host with gcc4. For instance, 
     Linux-2.6.8.1, abiword-2.0.12-9 and xmms-1.2.7-21 all broke during
    build. However, Linux-2.6.12 (from kernel.org) compiles fine and I 
    replaced the FC4 kernel with this one, with no apparent problems.

5. Since binary RPMs built on FC3 install fine on FC4, it's a good idea
    to have an FC3 build machine with gcc-3.4.x for building earlier RPMs
    and kernels.
    
6. The only Cons of FC4: the relative immaturity of the gcc4 toolchain, 
    and the larger memory footprint (256 MB recommended for FC4 vs.
    128 MB for FC3).

7.  Overall, I'd rate this distro 9/10 - the main Pros are speed, ease of
    migration, API stability, ABI stability. It's great for breathing new
    life into aging hardware (for reference, the difference in performance
    between a P3/1Ghz and a Northwood Celeron 2.4 GHz is about 25%
    for gcc-3.4 compilation of Firefox. We could get this same boost 
    for free by upgrading from FC3 to FC4 on the P3/1GHz.)

To summarize: Everything just works as before, only quicker. Go for it!

-Siva

P.S. My pam-losetup/cryptoloop stuff still works, with on-disk binary 
compatibility retained from Linux-2.4/RH 7.3. Try doing these kinds of 
things with NTFS or similar crap in the M$ world.

Thanks for the info. I attended the meeting and it turned out to be
very informative. This was the official meeting where TUNE - Tamil Unicode New,
RFC was launched. The rationale for a new standard was explained very
articulately by a Prof. Krishnamoorthy from Crescent college - he
explained how current efforts try to shoehorn Tamil into a design by committee
standards, and why that doesn't work well. A "free as in Rasna" CD
containing documentation, fonts, sample files, etc was given to the
participants. The CD included OpenOffice for Windows and Mac, but not Linux.
The TUNE folks are looking for volunteer testers and have estimated the
initial testing period to hundred days. They have also set up a Yahoo
groups where TUNE can be discussed.

TUNE essentially is a thumbs down to efforts like the current Tamil
Unicode, and ISCII  where little input was taken from folks actually
knowledgeable in Tamil or the
nuances of the language, and is a total home grown effort from folks at
TVU (Tamil Virtual University) and Kanithamizh Sangam.

Hi,
  I set up reliance internet connection on my Suse 9.2 
Professional box by following the instructions given
on their website. 

http://www.relianceinfo.com/Infocomm/Rim/rconnect_dc_linux.html

The setup was a breeze. I also browsed some websites. 
But after i disconnected i am not able to connect again.
The user guide says to use 

killall pppd

in case there are any reconnection problems. This also did
not work. I checked the var/log/messages file. The pppd
session is being started by a process (say 6998). A few lines later
it says failed as ttyS0 locked by process 6998. Any idea about
whats wrong??

Dear Ramaswamy,
Is there any open website where information related to this TUNE is
available.  (not closed yahoogroups ).

IMHO , The current tamil unicode is working well and there is no need
for any new encoding.

This TUNE effort should not be encouraged. This will only bring down
the current momentum of tamil computing works drastically.

If we look back, some of the current members of Kanithamiz Sangam were
responsible for creating alternate encodings in the year 1999 called
TAM & TAB.

It should be noted, TSCII was in use much earlier (i think from 1998 onwards). 
TSCII was a discussed in openforum (hosted by tamil.net those days)
for nearly a year and formed as a open 8-bit standard.

But some of the Commercial Tamil software Vendors based in Tamil Nadu
with the help of then DMK government created & announced TAB/TAM. It
should be noted, this TAB/TAM efforts were not open and were formed
without taking into consideration TSCII - the open 8-bit Tamil
standard available in those days.

TAB/TAM efforts almost killed the momemtum of tamil computing in those
TSCII days by creating confusion among the developers.
Nowadays only Tamil Nadu Govt websites are having TAB/TAM encoding. It
doesnt enjoy much support among users and Developers.

I find similar thing is going to happen now...

Now we have a working Tamil unicode encoding. 
And tamil unicode is gaining acceptance among the tamil computer users
, developers, Major Software Vendors & Freesoftware community.

At this critical moment, there is absolutely no need for any new Tamil
UNICODE encoding.

Only few in the Tamil Nadu - ** that too mostly Comercial Tamil
software vendors** under Kanithamizh sangam,  are attempting to create
an alternate tamil New encoding with the help of govt agencies.

Current unicode DOES NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM, This new Tamil unicode
encoding by commercial software vendors , should be prevented at any
cost.

When you say it didn't work, are you saying it said permission denied
or did you see no output? Or was there any particular error?

Please show us ifconfig output. If you still see the serial link, the
pppd hasn't died/released the ttySx.

Once you are 'sure' that pppd has died, check for the presence of
/var/lock/LCK..ttyS0 file.

Tell us what you find.


1. ps aux | grep pppd
2. ifconfig
3. ls /var/lock/

ps: Out of curiosity I am asking: what's the speed you got? what
handset model? Datacable type? Why not USB port? You get much higher
speeds though USB modems.

One Day One Command 
===================

c++decl -- Create/Explain C++ Type Declarations.

Summary:

Cdecl is a program for encoding and decoding C/C++ type declarations
in English language. Both cdecl and c++decl are same program. cdecl
will use C notation and c++decl use C++. It can run in interactive
(shell-like) and non-interactive mode (command line arguments).

In the interactive mode, cdecl will wait for your input in "c++decl> " 
prompt. Enter "quit or exit" to exit. Enter "?" for help.

Examples:

$ c++decl -- Start the c++decl in interactive mode.

c++decl> quit -- Exit c++decl.

c++decl> declare i as static integer 

c++decl> declare x as reference to pointer to character

c++decl> declare foo as pointer to member of class X int

c++decl> explain class Y *(X::*foo)(arg1, arg2)

$ c++decl -c declare signal as function returning int -- Create 
                            compilable C or C++ code as output.

Mugunth, 

Other than the Yahoo news group "tune_rfc" they didn't mention any
other links/resources. The presentations seem to have been uploaded to
the Yahoo group (tune_rfc). Check out the documents there. Looks like
you need moderator approval before you can join the group.

Message-ID: <ed2d3c000508101009519d473e@mail.gmail.com>

Dear members,

Warm greets,I bring to your notice and request your suggestion on some
issues which cripple my mind for a while.

  My prime business for my bread is machine assembling, and in the
recent past, The orders have dried due to some lack of attention of
mine towards business. having said that, Now my eyes are wide open and
eager to win some machine support orders like installation of
OS/Office tool. This time which is my second innings i pledge my self
that i will only install legitimate software and a point blank no to
pirated editions. Today i was called by  one of my client to fix some
problem in his machine, The order seemed to be upgrading his machines
hard disk and installing  a cd writer in his machine. He has a zycel
modem which is provided by airtel. As you know all this ISPs are
wicked in not providing support like device drivers for their modem in
linux environment.

 My client is a Managing director of a well know state government run
organisation. When i told him about the implication of problems that
might rise in the event of installing a windows sofware and told him
about linux and its righteousness in giving solution. As my client's
only task is to check emails , download some files in the attachment
which he transports from his office which are created in the microsoft
environment and browsing, i suggested him to get a router which is an
additional cost of Rs99/month as rent provided by airtel.My client
relents to pay this expense and says it as an additional expense for
no matter he is not bothered what is the os or the legitamacy of the
software be.The awkward think is that he expects me to install a
pirated version of windows product, my concious declines in giving
such solution.Some time law makers are law breakers too.The gentle man
who declines to pay Rs99/month , imagine will he buy a licensed copy
of M$windows Xp &office which mounts to Rs9000/-+


There are 2 things i want to know,

1) Do nasscom or any governing body doesnt bother to lay strict norms
in bringing the legitamacy of software copyrights and hunt for pirated
users , as the list of people's  databases can be had from all the
isp's.This way we can bring FLOSS need felt by the common computer
user. well some crude method, but most medicine doses are not sweeter.
secondly the ISPs who doesnt give a linux support like the drivers for
their modems, are they termed as offenders of service, as they push
the people to commit a crime( i mean installing a pirated software
like M$windows for a sake that isp modem only has a window driver).
are these isp's are keen in pushing the modem and expect the users to
hang on in the pirated version of software.Are these ISPs are
nominated back door partners of Microsoft.

2) What are the parameters which will make my business model (i deal
only FLOSS) more renumerative in terms of volume base. I charge only
for my service and not for the software. What are the points i should
look at as a machine support guy and what are the parameter i should
talk to a pirated user for migrating him to the FLOSS community.

Any way , my hands are clean and i will never ever install pirated
software. I may lose this order , as i lose a battle and not a war.


Looking for some comments on this issue.

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Cheers

There are so-called laws in India. They are _just_ not
enforced.

Yes. Because they are biased.

You can ask him if he wants to visit prison, and pay
some Rs. for bail.

Its only recently in India that copyright and piracy
of VCDs has been given importance. That too because of
the hype created by the cine industry. 

Its still not followed in educational institutions
either? How many students write their own
thesis/project in their final year? Most of them just
copy text from some other book. Even assignments for
that matter, one should always quote reference, in MLA
or APA style. I wonder how many students actually know
about these two!

Not sure when software is going to get the real
treatment.

I have the same usb modem, and I use the eciadsl drivers without any
problems. (Some modems might require their nortek driver, which is
listed on the page as still in beta stage, but it works perfectly for
me.. no slow down in speed, etc.. ).

But, the problem is this driver still does not have a point and click
interface to start the modem.. so you might have to write a small
program to do so.. (doing it in python won't take too much time for
people who are good at it)

Well, did you try telling him the legal implications of doing so. I
know of a computer shop (which belongs to a friend of mine) where
microsoft people simply bought a computer  for about 29k with pirated
version of windows in it and sued him for close to 1 lakh. And this
happened right here in India in Chennai.

Tell him the actual cost of the product, (once you have it installed
linux, with internet configured you can probably show him the ms site
with the actual price of the software).

Most people fail to understand the concept of 'pirated' software..
give him an analogy with the "THIRUTTU VCD".

Try networking solutions..  (SOHO n/w), small businesses.. etc. We
have to remember that most people find computers severly
intimidating.. and throwing them into bash is not such a good idea.
Try very user friendly distro's like Madriva (mdk), Ubuntu, (My choice
would be ubutnu because broadband is almost everywhere and apt-get is
the perfect way to install software..)

also, check out this article...  (this is the third of a 3 part
series, 1 and 2 are pretty good too)
http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=11134&page=3

A sub 10k pc is pretty much possible has been proved by HCL. Try to
offer your services to that market (The systems will be running linux,
good place to offer your services).

Hmm.. I know that I am speaking for majority of the students of engg.
college's here when I say that 'Teach better since free software comes
with source' is an extremely fallacious argument.. because, many of
them equate the free in 'Free Software' to free beer, not free speech.

And secondly, most of them are not even interested in looking at
further references to 'clearly explain concepts', let alone go and
check out under the hood of a compiler or an Operating System.

Even, with the source, most mature  Free/Open Source software (that
are usually bundled with distro's) are not very good teaching tools,
as the pack too much complexity, and simple ones are well.. too simple
to learn anything useful. The middle ground is hard to find.

Hardly. How many guys do you know went to prison in the US for using
pirated software? Distributing, yes - not using.

In the US, the BSA would have audited you, found pirated software,
threatened to sue you, then offered to settle out of court, and taken
a few thousand $$$ from you - on to the next pirate :)

It is not cheap to litigate in the US.

... because they are only interested in clearing exams
and getting marks, rather than understanding the
fundamentals.

We have to tell them what the industry is about.
Because the corporate guyz and HR are non-technical,
they _only_ see the marks. College students are
brainwashed into this trap.

As how an advisor is important to a PhD student, a
project manager is important to a developer in the
industry. One will learn only from a project manager
and it will help him/her build their career, not the
HR. From what I have seen so far, HR in India are
terrible, and software engineers don't get alone with
them?

We don't do just theory in the industry, its more of
real-time stuff. 

The situation is worse in schools (especially state
board). When students say they have cut off of
297.blah blah, parents give sweets to the kids. WTF?
What have they really learnt? Has education taught
them to think? No. Just studying for exam sake and
vomiting in exams is not education. 6 months after the
exams, ask them to do E=mc2 derivation, they will not
be able to do it.

I have to disagree. One of the best things about FLOSS
is the documentation. There are also lot of ways you
can get help from the community (mailing lists,
forums, IRC, google.com, ...).

Well, that was about the teachers, not students. And you really can't
explain fundamentals when even the teachers are unsure of what it
exactly is (I know I had difficulty with TOC.. if it was not for
wikipedia.. i wouldn't have even passed!).

Also, this might be a bit off-topic, but even the current curriculum
does not really show linux with all its power... Infact, most of them
are even unaware that linux has a powerful and completely functional
GUI. for eg, the only lab in which we wrote our programs in linux was
the so called "OS Lab", and we had to do it in bash with vi/emacs +
gcc. and most of the students tend to think that that all there is to
linux. and our Os book actually dedicates one whole section in a unit
on linux!.

Not particularly, I've spoken to a few of the HR, who visit for campus
recruitment, and one of them mentioned this to me point blank - ' We
are not looking at what you've learnt in the past 4 years, but rather
at what you haven't lost'.  So they are atleast aware of the condition
of the  colleges, etc..

Maybe I phrased it wrong, but.. here is what I tried to say..
I said mature tools, for eg,  GCC is a really bad place to learn
compiler design, kernel 2.6.12 is a bad place to start learning about
"OS scheduling algorithms"(maybe 0.0.1, but not 2.6) . I am talking
about this kinda thing.. well you can always try out other simpler
compilers out there..and it might still be FLOSS, but you've to search
for it. So, that argument about 'FLOSS is a great place to learn about
CS' and hence ' I shall go forth and install debian sarge'  do not
follow each other logically.. thats what I meant to say..  take for
example, a good place to start compiler design would be to look into
very simple implementations of languages without too much of a syntax
etc.. how many run of the mill distro's provide that?

But still thats no reason, not to go ahead and use the argument for
starting a LUG or spreading any form of linux awareness.

Sure. But, it is no excuse for students not to take
the initiative and learn. We can only bring the horse
to the pond, can't force it to drink the water. Even
if the students are given the best lectures, and if
they don't open up their minds and listen, there isn't
much one can do.
 
Even HR training will be on group dynamics, group
games, blah blah blah. If it has to be technical, they
will ask the campus college staff themselves to teach.
So, its not going to be any different from what
students have studied (as opposed to learning).

It doesn't have to be 2.6.12. It can be any 2.6
kernel. 

Operating systems is an ocean by itself. There are
definitely a lot of dependent concepts and components
to it. Nobody will straight away ask you to take the
course. That is why students are first introduced to
algorithms, complexity, data structures, computer
systems,  microprocessors and then operating systems.
You build on the former.

Understanding the Linux Kernel: Process Scheduling:
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxkernel/chapter/ch10.html

Software revolution documentation on the Linux kernel:
http://www.softwarerevolution.com/jeneral/open-source-docs.html

Linux kernel cross-reference:
http://lxr.linux.no

Nobody is going to teach you in the industry. There is
a lot of competition. The ability to read RFCs and
specifications, comprehend them and implement them is
important. This methodology must start from colleges.
Unfortunately, students are spoon-fed and they are not
made to use their brain cells.

Just my thoughts,

SK

Hi,

You cannot change all of a sudden in the users mind. End user always
has a mind to choose is comfortablity. His mind have been fully loaded
with windows and its environment. His Neighbours would change his mind
and ask him to use windows and they might also said Linux is tough to
use.

I suggest you go with the little.... 

migrate the user's browser from IE to Firefox
migrate Thunderbird browser from Outlook Express to Thunderbird
migrate Outlook Calendar to Sunbird
migrate windows media player to xine / mplayer / xmms
migrate yahoo/msn msgr to windows gaim msgr
migrate Norton Antivirus to AVG Free Antivirus Edition

Tell the features of these softwares to the user and let him migrate
to these. and slowly migrate MS Office to Open Office v2.

In this way you can say the user how FLOSS is good to use and easy to
use with no cost....Also introduce him to some projects from source
forge so that he can use it for his purpose.....

once you did all this.. it is easy for the user to understand about
FLOSS and Linux OS. then you easily migrate the user to Linux OS from
windows. also show some demo using Knoppix/Mandriva Move....

Well, Airtel does have an ethernet modem (not router) for the SAME rent

Hello there,

Development Version, Octave-FLTK-0.6: Octave bindings
for FLTK-1.1.6. released today. 
Get it here:
http://octave-gtk.sourceforge.net/octave-fltk/

This version is a little more improved than the
previous 0.1.
Id not advice newbies to try this, but are welcome to.

This release is mainly to keep the focus & steam in
development, and solicit bug reports, and new wrappers
from the developer/user community [if someone will use
Octave-FLTK].

Id like to ask engineering,math,science students,
to drop in, and check out the project. And of course,
youre welcome aboard.

Cheers
Muthu.

This is an overkill. Seriously, for a personal computer. Ultimately
you will not learn anything about configuration. And you will try
installing webmin when ever people ask you to help them configure
their systems.

But yes, for large scale installations webmin and cousins might help.

you are able to log into X as root? then when u r on the command line
try this "cp /etc/skel/.* ~/" and then startx

You might just be missing the startup files for gnome/kde/...

And lose all customizations, bashrc et al? I wouldn't do that!

Move all your dotfiles before trying this, if you don't want to lose
your customization.

I have used Prozilla. It serves me well. The debian package has been
orphaned recently. Nevertheless, it works well for me. The frontend is
"prozgui". I also know a couple of friends who use this regularly.

Hi All,
I am able to use BSNL Dataone in my Xandros linux.
I followed the instructions given in the URL:
http://www.appaji.net/stuff/dataone/chunks/x65.html#AEN288
and configured the Huawei SmartAX MT880 ADSL router.

And it worked !!

I havent executed the command, as far as my understanding, SSH connection is
asking for password.
You can use three way of authentication for SSH

1. Key authentication.
		two options (without user intervention)
			(i) pulic key with empty passphrase.
			(ii) using SSH agent
2. password authentication. --> ruled out 
3. Host authentication.

Which version of MySQL? Until 5.x somewhere, MySQL didn't support
foreign keys (and it called itself a SQL database ;)

The syntax would be:

create table mytable (
    somefield int4,
    constraint somefield_valid foreign key (somefield) references
someothertable(itsfield) on delete cascade
);

It is a pretty bad idea for a large scale installation too. Can you
imagine doing a simple task (say increasing MaxClients in apache)
using webmin in a server farm with 1000 servers?

On the other hand, login to each box, change a simple setting via GUI,
logout - sounds oh so windows-ish :)

Message-ID: <73c0772405081201171a7bd557@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I had once registered for Unbuntu CDs follwoing some one's idea that
we can distiribute them on the sidelines of FOSS day or so. But later
i got to know that they would be charging some money for shipment of
these CDs. Today i received a parcel from postal department of which I
had no clue of. When i openned up i was rather surprised, it contained
the Ubuntu CDs i had ordered a month back. And i wasnt asked for any
money for the shipmant and all. Now i am trying to give those CDs to
all those who are interested in trying out Linux. I have given them to
a couple of ppl, and they tried the Live CD version and they liked
them very much that they are asking me to install them. If anyone
wants the Ubuntu CDs then i am ready to give it. I can probably bring
them to tommorrows meeting, which I am planning to attend. I have got
aroud 10 cds for x86 and 5 cds for AMD64/EM64T. Those who need them
can mail me or give me a ring.

Thankyou

I think you mean 4.x. MySQL 4.0 doesn't, but MySQL 4.1 has foreign keys 
support, if I'm not wrong. But I'm way too happy with PostgreSQL to

Friends.

I think, they charge for those who orders bulky as 100 or more.
caz, i ordered 100 and they charged me some 800 rupees.
I did not get it.

as once Raaman told,
For newbies and new linux comers,
Ubuntu is not capable to intriduce linux.
eand as nowadays cds r cheap,
we can write from friends,
no need to order and get from abroad.
so, I got it from my friend.

just tested and came back to my favourite distro.

I hope there is some kde version also.
do anyone have that?
Most newbies like KDE than GNOME.

Thanks.

If you had installed cups without any prefix then if u look into
/usr/share/cups/backend you should find a couple of backend programs
which transport the print job from cups to the particular device. like
usb or parallel port etc. So from what you say i guess it is telling you
to register a new backend provided with your hp driver in the backend
folder. This could mean simply copying the corresponding backend program
into the backend folder and then restart cups for it to detect the new
backed.

Hello,
I am giving a talk on "AUTOMAKE and AUTOCONF" .. one of most important 
development tools in linux during our next meet. I suppose it will on 20th 
of this month. I had confirmed it with Bharathi. But would Bharathi or 
Shakthi to confirm this offically to the members and also announce the venue 
and time.

I will just give a intro of what i will be speaking about.
Automake and Autoconf are the tools using which we can create scripts 
necessary to run the configure, make and make install commands that we use 
to install softwares in linux. If some one is developing a software in linux 
then this talk will tell him how to make a tarball of that software. The 
talk will only introduce you to these tools. I will soon mail a Abstract of 
the talk.

comments are welcome .
Thanks and regards

Hi Shathi,
This is regarding mambo. After long hunting i had found one free hosting 
service that allows me to host webpages embedded with mambo. 
www.kaski-net.net/~deepan <http://www.kaski-net.net/~deepan> is the host. I 
can only upload html files to the server. It supporst php. So i have to 
first build my website locally using mambo ( i suppose) . the doubt i have 
is ..
should i have apache running in my system to make mambo websites? 
I will put it this way. i have the content for the website ready. I can 
upload only html files to the server. so i have generate html files from 
mambo. i had downloaded mamboo. I dont have apache running on my system. How 
do i generate those html files?

Hi all,
 
I have a BSNL Broad Band connection and i am using FC2 and have configured it using adsl-setup.  A week before it was working fine. But, recently i am encountering a problem.
 
Though, i am able to establish a connection by running adsl-start (found it out  by checking the /var/log/messages shows the session id,local and remote ip addresses),  I am not able to browse. I tried pinging to google, but only in vain. It says "ping: the host cannot be found".
 
Note: BB is working fine under windows.
 
Could any one of you suggest me in rectifying this.
 
Best Regards,
Balamurugan

With Mambo, you add your content online itself. No
need to do anything locally.

AFAIK you will have to install mambo seperately for every user of the
system. So uploading only html files might not be an option.

You should have apache running on ur local machine to view the website!

You check your network status from the output of:

/sbin/ifconfig -a

Post the output. Does it show a ppp0 entry?

You first try to ping an IP address.

1. See if you can ping your DNS server(s).
2. Ping an IP address, say, 66.94.230.46
3. Post the file contents of /etc/resolv.conf

It is a content management system (CMS) which helps you
create/maintain dynamic content driven website/portals
efficiently. There are many other CMS (each of them are
good in their own way).

Check out http://www.cmsmatrix.org/ to explore/evaluate
other CMS suite. If you want to know more about mambo
server, try the following links:
   http://www.mamboserver.com/
   http://www.mamboportal.com/
   http://www.mamboforge.net/

A google search for "mambo server" should show up many links.

Message-ID: <20050814090512.27206.qmail@web31713.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

The recent news in Hindu about people dying from
malnutrition in Niger and  certain other regions of
Africa is heart-rendering.  I have read the UN site
for more information and its apparent that the news
that we have is only the tip of the iceberg.

The UN site ( World food programme) is www.wfp.org and
there is link for online donation.

I was wondering if people might be interested in
helping. Other thing is that we might want to put a
link to their site on  Lugc page. In my opinion, open
source is a cause and helping others is a cause too. 

I hope others welcome this suggestion.

Regards,
Sanjay

if you added LIBTOOL as well, it would provide a comprehensive
overview of the autotools suite. Will you also touch upon other tools
that seek to place these with simpler procedures ?

Subject: [Ilugc] ur mambo troubles
Message-ID: <42FF59F1.8040102@gmail.com>

hi,
here is how u do it,
first make sure u have php, apache or any of the database server (i use 
mysql for my mambo sites)
i assume u have already installed php and apache, if not let me know and 
i will walk you through the installation.
u MUST have apache installed and properly configured to load the php 
modules to run mambo sites locally

heres a tip to save ur bandwidth costs!!!

download phpmyadmin and backup the database containing ur  mambo site. 
ur hosting account should have provided u a database and some tool to 
manage. using this tool u can sync both the database nad hence u need 
not spend hours modifying ur site. dont forget u need apache or similar 
webserver.
let me know if u have any other doubts

hi,
heres my phone number, 55377718
its gr8 i was of help to you. ok here's mambo indepth.
first of all u need not know anything about php. u must have downloaded 
mambo tarball.
extract the whole folder locally. ftp the contents directly to ur 
webspace. suppose ur contents are extracted to './mambo/' extract THIS 
directory as it. say u have uploaded the contents to 
<ur_webspace>/mambo, point ur browser to http://<ur_webspace>/mambo. u 
must be welcomed by a installation screen. now ur webhost must have 
provided u with a database. be sure to include ur database name and set 
the host to localhost. thats it! remember to chmod the approriate files 
and folders especially the configuration.php file to world executable, u 
can do that in ur ftp client itself. now as i had mentioned design ur 
site locally and synchronize the database. if u encounter any problems, 
let me know

Subject: [Ilugc] about mambo and its association with php
Message-ID: <4300A8E2.2050609@gmail.com>

hi,
sorry bout the fact that i didnt read ur reply correctly. i suppose u r 
having the doubt about php in mambo.
php, as u must be knowing is a webscripting language like java or asp, 
the catch is u dont need any extra software to run php scripts on ur 
system unlike java which requires some kind of software which in this 
case is JVM or Java Virtual Machine. View the source of a php page from 
ur browser and u will find only html tags! this is bcause php embeds 
within html. All this is done on the Server itself, unlike in java where 
the actual interpretation occurs on the client i.e. the users' system. 
Now mambo uses php because of its close association with MySQL and they 
are quite good chums. Suppose u were to submit some form information in 
mambo. what it actually does is get ur form data, create approriate 
tables in MySQL database. also when u register in a mambo based site it 
creates tables for the  approriate fields like passwords, address. etc. 
now since php n MySQL are closely related all this is seamless and 
nothing is visible to the user. and remember php iand MySQL (to sum 
extent) are open source. moreover php is lightweight and doesnt require 
any software to be installed on the client side. so it pretty natural 
that a CMS like mambo to use php.

Hey theres another cms called mamboplus derived from mambo itself. the 
catch is it also includes a phpBB forum with it and moreover ur users 
can login in the forums and the websites with the same user id, separate 
registration for the forums is not required. if u have any doubts just 
give me a call to 55377718 anytime and i'll be glad to help

gnully,
Sudharshan S

1. I would like to know if anyone, in Chennai, is
interested in coordinating GLV activities. You only
have to contact Asokan Pichai (Ma Foi Academy) and ask
if the place is available for a session. You should
call for speakers or any interesting discussion
sessions in the mailing list, and then inform members
in the mailing list. You should also interact with
Vamsee, Manics of Ma Foi Academy for coordinating the
work. All the correspondence is through e-mail. 

Our strength has been growing, and I don't want you
guyz to stop meeting every week just because some of
us are not in the city. Do let me know.

2. Folks from Kongu Engineering College, Erode, please
get in touch with me.

3. Can anyone send the minutes of the meeting held on
Saturday, August 13, 2005?

friends.

I am setting a mail system.
i use postfix, mandrake 9.1.

after configuring postfix, mail only works within the server.
the mail does not reach clients.

in client systems, there is no "mail" program, in console.
so, i cannot check.

/usr/sbin/sendmail- No such file or directory.

whether sendmail is needed for clients?

how to setup console "mail" program?

thanks.

ps ax | grep mysql

if you get any kill them and then try restarting mysql it will work.

Check where the mysql.sock exist....(in ur system it might be /tmp/mysql.sock)
Then In /etc/my.cnf 
change the socket path  to /tmp/mysql.sock

then restart the mysqld server....

Message-ID: <ed2d3c00050816055649b42348@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Members,

In our list of programmes for Software freedom day,we have Quiz
programme by 4:00 pm.(this programme, we can have it if time permits).

Can  we have a quizzing software running on Linux with the following
features.(Taking time into account, members can comment on this,
either to have this module for the function or not).

You are requested to bottom post ,

1) Software should run on Linux with tamil interface.

2)The software be able to configure the number of teams per quiz.

3).The reward for the question should carry 'n' marks for a direct
question and n/2 or n-10 marks for a question carried ,on a round.
Facility should be enabled or disabled by a .conf configuration file.
Like MARKS_4_CARRIED_QUESTION= N/2 or N-10.

4)Facility like negative marks for an incorrect answer on a   rapid
fire round   . This feature should be configurable with a .conf file
like RAPIDFIRE_ROUND_NEGATIVE_MARKS=DISABLED / ENABLED  either one of
them.

5) FOR BUZZER ROUND , we can intergrate www.lirc.com where we can
interface the serial ir receiver to the computer and separate remote
control of different make and model so that the single will not clash.
We can pick up the signal first registered in this regard.

6) THERE SHOULD BE AV-AUDIO VIDEO ROUND. the quizing module can have a
facility of putting up a jpeg image on the monitor/projector,  be able
to play a audio/video  clip.We can cut and play some part of the movie
like 'code'.

7) QUESTION BANK AND ANSWER BANK updates should be possible with the software.
Quiz should have Random picker facility, by this it should be possible
to  pick questions across  all the data stored as a part of different
quizes.(QUIZ cooked from many quizes whose data are stored earlier)

8) Score tally should be displayed at each round and end of the quiz.


( tonite i will google on this, looking for a module)
I am meeting the Exec Director of TNSTC -CHENNAI by tommorrow. I will
update reg with the permission for Linux Demo Day  at the venue.

Sincerely 

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

Hi pple,
I found that except TOI and Indian Express, none of the other
newspapers have RSS feeds.
Do I have to wait for them to give those feeds or can I create my own
xml file for this purpose?(and some updation script).. is this a
violation of syndication laws in any way?
One such unofficial xml file that i was able to track down was
http://xml.newsisfree.com/feeds/64/2664.xml
this is feed for  hindu's homepage

PHP requires an interpreter. It is not correct to say that you don't
need any extra software.

This is the case only for Java applets. Servlets and JSP are processed
on the server, much like PHP (mod_php v/s mod_jk2). Servlets of
course, require a servlet engine - Tomcat is the best known I suppose.

This is simply fantastic. I can't imagine any application creating a
few tables in the database for every new user. :)

One Day One Command 
===================

openvt -- Open a new Virtual Terminal and start a program on it.

Summary:

In GNU/Linux OS, be default, 6 virtual text mode console terminals
will be running. User can switch between this terminals using Left 
Side Ctrl + Alt + FunKey(1 - 6).

openvt will find the first available VT, and run the given command on
it. If no command is specified then the $SHELL is used.

Examples:

$ openvt -- Start a shell on the next free VT. Try Alt+F<1-12> to see 
            new shell session.

$ openvt -v -- Same as above, with extra output.

$ openvt -l bash -- Start the shell as a login shell on next free VT.

$ openvt ls -- Run the 'ls' on the next free VT.

$ openvt -s ls -- Same as above. But Switch to the new VT when 
                  starting the command.

# openvt -c 9 ls -- Run the 'ls' on the 9th VT.

Read: man openvt

hi,
i assume ur using a tataindicom cdma connection heres how to configure 
ur internet in detail
Login as root (this is important)
create a file called wvdial.conf using a text editor in 'etc/', The full 
path name should be like this, '/etc/wvdial.conf
Copy everything below the horizontal line
*******************
[*Modem0]                                                               *
*Init2 = AT+CRM=1
Baud = 115200
FlowControl = Hardware (CRTSCTS)
Init1 = ATZ*
*Modem = /dev/ttyS0*  //This is the device reference, ttyS0 stands for 
port 1, ttyS1 for port 2, and so on
*Phone = #777    *      //the formula is ttySX where X=port no -1, ex, 
if i use port 2 then I have to use ttyS1
*Password = internet*
*Dial Command = ATDT*
*SetVolume = 0*
*[Dialer cdma]  *//This is the dialer part, like the executable you get 
in windows, and could be of any name                         
*Phone = #777*
*Username = internet *                                    
*Password = internet*
*Inherits = Modem0* //Inherits modem settings    
*Stupid Mode = on  *//This is absolutely NECESSARY without it modem 
won't initialize!
******************
//End of Script
//You can also create many dialers in the same file
*********************
After this is done you have to create a file called 'resolv.conf' using 
a text editor. This resolves the Tata Indicom DNS Server
This file also should be created in the /etc folder and the full path 
will go as '/etc/resolv.conf
The contents of the file are as follows and copy everything below
******************
*nameserver 203.197.12.30
nameserver 202.54.6.50 //this is for indicom isp. if u r using reliance 
this may change
********************
*Thats It, now we have to run the command within Terminal as 'wvdial 
<the dialer name>' to connect to the internet which in this case would 
be 'wvdial cdma'. To make things easy for the lazy ones even a short cut 
of this command on the desktop could be created.
This will work, also, sometimes you might get device busy errors for 
which you should set the 'Modem for next' option on the phone
*_The line 'Stupid Mode = on' is absolutely MANDATORY!

Bottom of the news page suggest that "The above tariff will be valid until 
31/03/2006". So BSNL will change the traiff of previous customer too or 
what?

Use parted command to do this.

Google it. It will help.

* Create a new virtual machine
* Select "Linux" as your guest operating system.
* Allocate at least half of your RAM as guest memory
* Create a new virtual disk with at least 2 GB in size (more is
recommended). Either you can ask VMWare to create the new disk now or let it
grow until 2 GB (or whatever).
* Insert the installation boot CD
* Start your newly created virtual machine.
* Rest of the steps is same as normal Linux installation. Only tricky part
is the partitioning the disk (unless you let the installation takes care of
partitioning). Here the disk shown is the virtual disk, so the device
pointing to it will be different that normal.
* After installation, remove the boot CD. Start the virtual machine.
* Thats it.

Hope this helps

Apache itself comes with a benchmarking tool called (very creatively) ab.

Dear Abdullah,

I suggest that you use the free QEmu for this purpose. It is a highly
capable full PC emulator available from:

http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/

Utilities are provided for creating virtual disks in the windows
version of the software, you can then install many operating systems
and run them from winthin your windows machine.

Hi lug,

i am looking forward to gyaan on Cluster Computing --
esp making use of the cluster architecture for
optimizing/enhancing the queries from a software
developer's perspective (without concentrating much on
the hardware intricacies). In this context has anyone
tried the Beowulf/OpenMosix -- it would be great if
you can share your gyaan/experiences with me?

I am esp looking at clusters  having nodes less than
10, typically using commodity hardware [Class I
clusters with a couple of machines(the masters)
resembling Class-II clusters].

Venky

A feature I like in VMWare is that you can "attach" the virtual
machine's CD drive to an ISO image. Hence, you don't need to burn CDs
from downloaded Linux distributions to install in a virtual machine.
Saves the environment. :)

Tech Tip from Linux Journal

If you're learning how to write CGI scripts in Perl, you can save
yourself some time looking at error logs by putting error messages in
your browser session. Add "fatalsToBrowser" to your "use CGI" line to
turn it on. Try this:

 #!/usr/bin/perl -Tw

 use strict;
 use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);

 print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
 prnit "Hello world!";

In general, it's a bad idea security-wise to expose details about your
system, so you probably will choose to turn off "fatalstoBrowser" on
your production site.

Hi,
I dont think plan250 will be enough for even an optimum user who has a
couple of mail ids to check and does some browsing daily as the
download limit is only .4 GB. And, the pity thing was, when i went to
enquire about my brandband connection in the telephone exchange, the
guys who were put there to give the forms had no knowledge about the
forms, theyy were running to the SE for every enquiry. They just say
about plan250, and dont stress the point about the very low dl / ul
limit of that plan, never say about he other plans. The guy asked me a
couple of times, whether i was sure of choosing plan 500. i was
telling people about the plans and other procedures there. Also they
havent specified anething about necessity of ethernat card if their pc
doesnty hv ethernet support.

One Day One Command 
===================

deallocvt -- Deallocate Unused Virtual Consoles.

Summary:

The command deallocvt deallocates kernel memory and data structures 
for all *UNUSED* virtual consoles.

When you do 'openvt', a new virtual console will be created on the
next free terminal. After using that, We can deallocate it using the
'deallocvt' command.

Examples:

# openvt -s ls -- Run the 'ls' on next free VT (mostly on 7).

# deallocvt -- Deallocate unused VT. Now switch to 7(?), you won't 
               see any change on the screen.

# deallocvt 7 -- Deallocate /dev/tty7, if it is unused.

Read: man deallocvt

Hi,
you can try in this way,

The '*' specifies 2 levels from the source, so try to change the --exclude as --include and try.
That will work fine.
--exclude  "/foo/*/bar"  would  exclude  any file called bar two
        levels below a base directory called foo

--include  "/foo/*/bar"  would  include  any file called bar two
        levels below a base directory called foo

Here I assume you are talking about using an ISO image as the virtual
machine's CDROM drive. The same is possible in Qemu as well.
Networking is also supported using TUN/TAP.

For example, to install an OS from an CDROM ISO image into a hard disk
file, the command would be:

$ qemu -hda hard_drive.img -cdrom ubuntu.iso -boot d

The "-boot d" option will make qemu boot off the iso image specified
with the "-cdrom" option. CDROM ISO images can also be changed/ejected
during runtime, through the monitor interface. Saving the VM state is
also supported.

We've had these discussions before. Sunday is one day

be working 24x7, do you? 

Automake and autoconf talk is _confirmed_ on Saturday,

Deepan, do get in touch with Vamsee and Manicks if you

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0508180619510.28755@chi.spunge.org>


Hi,

I saw a link containing  "The design and implementation of FreeBSD
operating system" (FreeBSD version 5.2)and 500+ excellent latest
computer ebooks on net.

I initially had the dilemma of whether to inform other people and make
them benefitted. I am sure some people would be interested to start
another thread flaming around saying that this is illegal or unethical and
stuffs like that. Later I came to the conclusion that if this is going to
be useful to many other people why not share it?. After all I am NOT
owning that site or NOT getting any benefit out of sharing this. But many
people who cannot afford to buy these books and people who can afford but
not like to buy books will definitely benefit from this link. When people
were not really ready to help, only these type of books helped me and many
other people like me to gain the knowledge and skill which we possess now.
If somebody says I am wrong, then, I think google which had taught and
shown me many skills and stuffs like this is even more wrong and
punishable.

So, people who want the link can mail me privately. I will let you know
the link.

If any body is interested to share their views(either FOR or AGAINST),they
can mail the group. I would like to know people's opinions(usefullness,
ethical, legal aspects) of sharing some USEFULL, NON-COMMERCIAL links
like this in the mailing lists.

Thanks and Regards,
carti

It is used to define rules for forwarding or reverse forwarding certain
requests,
for example, if we want another server to handle all http requests
having  xyz.com/foo as extention, we have to do it in mod_proxy module.
Similarly, if u want https or ftp request to be forwarded to another
server ,u have to define it here,
this is done so that , for the user, he will use the same web address,
but the actual location of file may be on differnt servers, and this is
made transparent to users.

openMosix is very simple to try and does not require any software to
be modified. It is autoconfiguring. All you need is the openMosix
Patched kernel(2.4 only), openMosix userland tools and nothing else.

Yup, it does. The HISTORY section of the bash man page is quite infromative.

Basic searches did not yield positive results for me. This document
(cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/bash/rose94.pdf) has a section which says
<quote>
Finally, the ksh history implementation differs slightly from bash.
Each instance of bash keeps the history list in memory and offers
options to the history builtin to write the list to or read it from a
named file. Ksh keeps the history in a file, which it accesses each
time a command is saved to or retrieved from the history. Ksh history
files may be shared among different concurrent instances of ksh, which
could be a benefit to the user.
</quote>

You could use the history builtin command and the PROMPT_COMMAND
environment variable to achieve this purpose.

Setting you PROMPT_COMMAND to "history -w; history -r" will make sure
that you history is saved and restored after command is executed. You
would also need to make sure you start off with an absolutely spotless
history :-) Otherwise you will history commands alternatively
overwriting your $HISTFILE.

Leave alone not working, it can land you up in deep trouble!

So, use Debian, or use the Ubuntu repositories.

Above solution won't work. That was too enthusiastic of me. Why it
won't work is the history write will spoil the synchronization. It
might write back stale history as one session's history does not get
updated automatically when another session executes a command. If we
had a counterpart to the PROMPT_COMMAND for executing certain commands
after every command then we would have had an easy solution.

I still feel we could play around with the PROMPT_COMMAND and the
history builtin to achieve history synchronization.

I'd recommend Redhat series of Linux distributions (not
Fedora Core, though) if you are expecting stability and
good support for your server-class hardware and
third-party commercial/enterprise software.

If you are an experienced admin who needs more
control, and if your requirement does not emphasize
"Enterprise support", then Slackware/Gentoo/Debian would
suffice.

I hope you are not planning to send out one email per directive found
in httpd.conf. Why don't you RTFM at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/
?

That said, mod_include provides SSI (Server Side Includes) support in
Apache. SSI is probably the oldest technology for creating websites
with dynamic content - I think it pre-dates even CGI. If you are not
using SSI, you can disable this module.

Dear Members,

The proposed Linux Demo Day at birla planetarium complex on sept 10
2005 , permission for it is verbally cleared by the The Executive
Director, Dr. Iyamperumal . Dr.Perumal is on his way to Sabarimala on
a devotional trip. On his return i will get a written permission from
him. The planetarium authorities have assured that they will take care
of media publicities(like ariticles about SFD in Daily
Newspapers).However we can also ask the media to focus on this open
source festival.

Yesterday at Marina beach about 6.pm i met Mr. Sujatha and briefed him
about the programme. He said he is out of station on sept 10 and
wished the function a grand success.

Assignment ahead

Now we have to talk on making arrangement of Pc's.

We have to form the agenda for LDD. (what are the softwares we are
going to display)

Forming voluteers team for LDD.

Try Debian Sarge.. I think it will be very useful since it has almost
all the sofwares required to run a server..

workforce, and its delaying its security updates for that reason,
I would recommend Gentoo rather.

Debian has its stable release and all the softwares in it are
stabilised in the new release.. and reg updates i think it shouldn
give much problem after all we are using GNU/Linux :)

Ok we will be patient but please

1.Give proper subject to your mail

2.Avoid top posting. top posting is write your message on top of

As part of FOSS Road show by NRCF,Au-KBC, MIT, I delivered a talk on
FOSS in Practice at C.Abdul Hakeem College of Engg and Tech,
Melvisharam, Vellore.

About 150 students of two colleges attended. Very few students have
knowledge of Free/Open source. I feel the response to the awarness
talk was good and hope to see increse in the usage.

The question answer session lasted about 30 minutes with mostly usual
questions like Linux not user friendly, lack of device support, how
to make money etc.

Dear members

> Finding the cheif guest.

What about Dr. Iyampermal ??

He is the host (or probably the co-host). It will be nice to have some
hardcore FLOSS contributor to take the center stage. Do any one have
any names of such people. what about Mr.A. Junjunwala of IITM(just a
suggestion).Though i am ignorant about his contribution to FLOSS, i
learnt from my friend that  he his the one who stood behind the
success of CORDECT.Do any one have contact with  Dr.Kulandai swamy
(V.C -Retired) of Anna university. He his a veteran educationalist. I
request the members to put the names of people whom they feel, will be
apt for cheif guest.


What kind of volunteer work would be needed?

We look forward for volunteers to put up FLOSS demo, to take care of
the machine under the possesion and it may be anything. I request
Mr.Raman.P Mr. Bharthi and Mr.Shakthi to comment on this, as these
gentleman have experience on conducting such events.


 What about

Ubuntu Cd's distribution for the function is under transit. These cds
are send by www.softwarefreedomday.org along with some t-shirts,
ballons and tatoos.
Though the quantity of items are not known yet.After the AUTOCONF and
AUTOMAKE presentation of Mr. Deepan Chakravathi , we will discuss the
POA(plan of action).
 Mr. Parth, do contact Mr.Sudharshan, and discuss what you are going
to perform for the event.


 Volunteers kindly attend this meeting, we can discuss a lot on SFD
after the AUTOCONF and AUTOMAKE session. I beleive this is the
penultimate meet before the festival, and then we will be meeting only
in the mailing thread.



Sincerely

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Hi,
Great to hear that the executive director has given permission to 
conduct the meet. Me and my friend will surely volunteer that day as it 
falls on a saturday. I suggest learning tools for the meet like 
celestia, but simulations like these require a fast machine. I'll try to 
get my athlon xp for the meet, but i'll confirm this in a day or two. 
Regarding the distro for the meet, in my opinion ubuntu is not 
favourable as it is not that feature rich. why not go in or knoppix or 
even fedora3.

Gnully,
Sudharshan S

One Day One Command 
===================

bg -- Place a job in BackGround

Summary:

Normally user can run a job in background, by adding & at end of the 
command (ex: sleep 10 &). 

bg is a shell command. It is used to move a job from foreground to the
background, as if it had been started with `&'. If JOB is not present,
the shell's notion of the current job is used.

Examples:

$ sleep 100 -- Start a dummy job in foreground.
  Press Ctrl+z to stop the current job.

$ bg -- Move the last stopped job to background.

$ sleep 150 -- Dummy job 1
  Press Ctrl+z to stop the current job.

$ sleep 140 -- Dummy job 2
  Press Ctrl+z to stop the current job.

$ sleep 130 -- Dummy job 3
  Press Ctrl+z to stop the current job.

$ jobs -- List all active jobs.

$ bg 2 -- Move the 2nd active job to background.

Read: help bg, jobs

No restriction on the Distro. For the BP's PC, we will use Knoppix 
and FreeEdu CD.

 ScoreBoard is used to communicate between its parent and child processes in 
apache. The ScoreBoard file is created in the disk only when it fails to 
create the ScoreBoard in the memory. For more information on this read 
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.1/mod/mpm_common.html#scoreboardfile
 Also read the apache manual completely before you post queries.

 The StartServers directive sets the number of child server processes 
created on startup. Yes it has a effect on the performance of the server. To 
tune your server to maximum performance I suggest you to read

Message-ID: <4306AD81.1030504@gmail.com>

hi,
apache2 is like a bleeding edge version and its gr8 for experimenting as 
it includes loads of new features, apache 1.3x is a lot stable and is 
used in production systems. now since development of php is hyper fast 
when compared to apache, apache2 and php do not go together that well. i 
use php 5 and apache2 but i use it only for learning purposes. most of 
the webservers still run on php 4 and apache 1.3  combo as they are a 
lot more dependable. so if i was running a mission critical system that 
controls a nuclear reactor or something similar i would dare not go in 
for an upgrade. Also to increase perfomance when it comes to php and 
apache combo, compile php as a shared object and not as a cgi module. it 
is a lot safer and faster. if ur main concern is to increase php 
perfomance on apache there are third party tools like eaccelerator and 
phpaccelerator that does all the dirty work for you

What nonsense. Apache2 is as stable as Apache1.3. A large number of
production sites use it. Its stability can be vouched for from the
fact that Redhat defaulted to Apache2 starting RHEL3.

Bleeding edge is Apache 2.1.

More of the same. But I guess here you are going by the popular FUD
spread by the PHP team that Apache2 is not good. You might want to
read http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/apache/2004/06/17/apacheckbk.html.

More websites run Apache 1.3 because it is legacy - the same way most
DNS servers run Bind4 or most email servers run Sendmail 8.9.

PHP as a CGI module?? What are you smoking?

hi,
actually php was a cgi module in its early days, even now by default 
when u compile php from tarballs, u get a cgi version. commercial 
distros like redhat include prebuilt php version which comes as a so 
with apache, but i m damn sure there php comes in cgi avatar when u dont 
include the apxs2 or apxs flag while configuring. php recommendations 
may be FUD as u say, but hey guys who created php know more than us, i'd 
rather play safe. stability wise too apache 1.3 is lot more stable than 
apache2

One Day One Command 
===================

fg -- Place a job in the ForeGround.

Summary:

Normally user can run many jobs in background, by adding & at end of
the command (ex: sleep 10 &).

fg is a shell command. It is used to move a job from background to the
foreground, as if it is NOT started with `&'. If JOB is not present,
then current job is used.

Examples:

$ sleep 100 & -- Start a dummy job in background.

$ fg -- Move the last job to foreground.

$ sleep 150 & -- Dummy job 1

$ sleep 140 & -- Dummy job 2

$ sleep 130 & -- Dummy job 3

$ jobs -- List all active jobs.

$ fg 2 -- Move the 2nd active job to foreground.

Read: help fg, jobs

Soft modems are modems in which the majority of the controls lie in a 
proprietary software driver which generally works only for Windows. See 
http://linmodems.org/. You might be able to fiddle and get it working 
but I would strongly recommend using a hardware modem that is natively 
supported by the Linux kernel.

Not necessarily. Fedora ships yum and up2date in core and Apt-rpm in 
extras. up2date supports and can use both yum and apt meta data to 
install software from such repositories

Apt-rpm is not developed anymore though. 
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Apt. I would recommend you use yum instead

hi all,
I successfully configured my DLink ADSL modem with BSNL dataone,
but i face a peculiar prob, 
ocassionally my line get struck up and doesnt respond, 
in windows the network sybol pops up and says limited connectivity,
and after sometime it get fine again,
I think it is changing its IP , but y is this happening when we are connected,
this should only happen when ever a new session is started nooo?
cant we keep the ip address static instead of dynamic mode, or is
there anyother way for getting out of this problem?
sometimes i need to reset my modem by switching modem power off and on
when its not responding...

I dont understand one thing,
why are people still after PHP when JSP and other things have come up?
is there any advantage?
PHP is scripting, so it should be more resource hungry on server,
rather than jsp etc.

There are lot of reasons to choose PHP over JSP. If we compare it will
be like Apples and Oranges. Some point

* Its procedural (OOPS optional)
* Available with almost all ISPs
* Easier to learn
* Powerful enough

  * PHP is more easier to setup and work with
    than JSP. It has minimal dependencies and
    integrates well on most widely used
    webservers.

  * I dont get to see websites /randomly/
    coughing up an "Internal Server Error"
    page with a java exception list
    on PHP websites. I dont know whether to
    blame the programmer or JSP itself, I still
    find most JSP based websites buggy and
    unstable.

  * PHP is more suitable for simple to medium
    sized websites/portals due to its simplicity.

  * It is easier for a perl/shell-script programmer
    to migrate to PHP than JSP.

  * It is a lot easier to process/manipulate text
    data on PHP than on JSP, which is a critical
    deciding factor for developing on the web. This
    also applies to manipulating strings,
    arrays/lists, hashes, files and databases.

  * In most cases, what would take several thousand
    lines of code to develop using JSP can be done
    using PHP is a couple of 100 lines (or even less).
    [I state this from my personal experience of
     migrating a buggy community portal originally
     written by someone else in JSP onto PHP].

  * PHP is tailored from the beginning to cater
    to web development, while JSP is merely a plug
    on Java to make it viable for the web.

Of course, JSP/Servlets are best used to develop
maintainable large-scale/complex web applications.
Infact, thats the only place where Java shines.

It somewhat enforces programmer/design discipline
which is good for large-scale development and
maintenance (much like COBOL), but can be annoying
for hobbyist programmers and those that work on
smaller projects.

Resource hungry than JSP ? Well well.. you haven't
hosted a JSP based website on a commodity-class
hardware, have you ? If you did, you'll know how
much of a bloat JSP really is when compared to
PHP or mod_perl.

As a simple test, try running Apache with Tomcat
(or any JSP engine of your choice) and check the
memory usage of your server on about 100 connections.
Now, do the same on with Apache and PHP and now
compare.

Try the same with CPU utilization by automating
multiple page requests on your server and compare
JSP vs. PHP and you'll be surprised :-)

The claims that scripting languages are
resource-hungry and slower than so-called compiled languages are plain FUD  
and make no practical sense
these days.

If I had to worry too much about resource usage of
my website, I'd rather switch to writing my webapps
using C and FastCGI enabled on Apache than using JSP.

Message-ID: <e0900f3e0508210112618acccc@mail.gmail.com>

I tried to install freebsd on my system. It asked for a primary partition 
and I somehow allotted it.
Partitioning was done successfully. The labelling step was also done, and 
the table is shown below:

part Mount size Newfs 
------------------------------ --------------------

ad0s3b swap 470mb swap 
ad0s3d /var 256mb ufs+s y

ad0s3f /usr 4000mb ufs+s y 
ad0s3g /dev 256mb ufs+s y
ad0s3h /etc 325mb ufs+s y


Then, when I finished this step and committed the step, the following error 
messages were shown one after another.


unable to find device node for /dev/ad0s3b in /dev! . The creation of 
filesystem will be 
aborted.


Couldnt make filsystems properly.aborting.


The commit operation completed with errors. not updating /etc files.

Please help me install it successfully.

This is the content in tamil, Yesterday ,After the mafoi academy meet
Mr.Mugunthraj, who is the creater for E-kalappai in windows version,
started his journey to make a tamil unicode phonotic editor in linux.
I am ignorant about unicode tamil editor in linux. I was expressing
the difficulty in making a content in tamil without a unicode tamil
editor in linux to him.The cause of writing email in tamil is that
first of all, we ( a large segment in this forum) want the tamil
community members to install indic font support linux distribution.
This is the key to localiazation.Conveying in tamil will ponder
increase contents in tamil which will be available world wide through
internet.

The objective of this mail is , for software freedom day , we are
going to perform a show at TNSTC kotturpurm chennai -25. The mail
tries to explain what is freedom, how freedom is liberated, how we got
our freedom of indian independence ,what is software freedom, do we
impeach microsoft windows, or the ignorance of people who use such
closed source software. we intended to impeach the ignorance and not
any software or vendors. It tells about office software like word
processor, spreadsheet and presentation manager available free of cost
in open source environment while compare to the chargable closed
source group.


The content is written with the help of java editor, the web address of it is

http://home.att.net/~jameskass/keybtaml.htm

I am a newbie in article writing and have drawbacks in putting the
characters with the help of mouse.apologies for few spelling
mistakes.The sentences are composed and each sentence is copied to a
text editor in linux. The whole content is then copied to the mail. I
hope some difficulties will be there for users who dont have indic
font support in their distribution. Slowly i beleive this problem will
vanish.

Thanking you

Thyagarajan

I haven't tried mod_python. But my guess is that
it might be slower than mod_perl. I would rather
recommend Zope for developing webapps if you
prefer python. This might involved a steep learning
curve. But its well worth the effort.

Even "Twisted Web" (http://www.twistedmatrix.com)
which is based on python framework seems promising,
though I cant comment on its stability and viability
on production deployments yet.

Hi

I want to create a build script which will just copy the src files into
target directory and produce a tar file. The directory structure consists
of 4 dirs and *.sql files inside it.
Can anyone please suggest which of the below scripting method to use and
why? I am working on Windows platform.

1. DOS Batch
2. PERL
3. ANT
Alternatively can anyone direct me to some useful sites where I can explore
the build process

Thanks to ilugc!

Message-ID: <20050821125029.21594.qmail@web54510.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi
 
I installed BharateeyaOo (OpenOffice 1.1.4 Tamil) from the C-DAC-CD exactly following the instructions in the CD in a system having Mandriva LE 2005 which has Gnome 2.8. It got installed without any problem. The menu and tool bars are displayed in tamil. However, when I use the tamil ttf fonts, only some junk or english characters are typed.
 
Before luanching Openoffice, I changed the keyboard layout to Tamil in Gnome. I have also installed JRE 1.5 and made necessary changes in the .bash_profile file. I used the "spadmin" tool to change the default fonts in Boo. 
 
The windows ttf fonts Ks_kamban and Ks_Ivvayar are working fine. I wonder why the C-DAC and other ttf tamil fonts are not working?
 
Did anybody face similar problem with ttf fonts availabe in the c-dac-CD? If it needs any additional tweaks let me know.
 
R.Dhanagopal
 
 
Below are Install Instructions which I followed 
 
To Install JRE 1.5: 

Step01. Download "jre-1_5_0_02-linux-i586-rpm.bin" &
"fontconfig.properties" from CD and save in a directory on your machine. 
Step02. Go to the directory in which you have saved the files. 
Step03. Change permission for "jre-1_5_0_02-linux-i586-rpm.bin"
$ chmod a+x jre-1_5_0_02-linux-i586-rpm.bin 
Step04. login as root
$ su 
Step05. Execute the binary file.
$ ../jre-1_5_0_02-linux-i586-rpm.bin
JRE will get installed in /usr/java/jre1.5.0_02/ directory. 
Step06. Copy GIST-TMOTChanakya font file to lib/fonts directory under Java
install directory 
$ cp (Full path in which Fonts.tar.gz saved)/Fonts/*.ttf 
/usr/java/jre1.5.0_02/lib/fonts 
Step07. Copy property files "fontconfig.properties" files to lib directory
under Java install directory
$ cp ../fontconfig.properties
/usr/java/jre1.5.0_02/lib 
Step08. Append following lines to your login's ".bash_profile" file
export PATH=/usr/java/jre1.5.0_02/bin:$PATH
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jre1.5.0_02/
Or
Add the above lines to "/etc/profile" file 
Step09. logout as root
$exit 
 
 
 
To Install Bharateeya Open office:

Step01. Download "OpenOffice.org-Tamil-Linux-1.1.4.tar.gz" from CD 
and save in a directory on your machine. 
Step02. Logout from the session and login again.
Before logging select Tamil as interface language and Gnome as
Desktop environment. There are options for selecting language
and desktop environment in login window( where the system asks 
for login and password), see "language" & "session" menus at bottom. 
Step03. Select Tamil Keyboard Layout for input.
Launch "Keyboard Preferences" from 
Applications->Preferences->Keyboard.
Under Layouts option you can select layout for Tamil. 
Step04. Go to the directory in which you have saved tar.gz file. 
Step05. Uncompress the tar ball
$tar -zxvf OpenOffice.org-Tamil-Linux-1.1.4.tar.gz
On uncompress you will get a new directory "normal" 
Step06 Set the appropriate permission.
$chmod -R 555 ../normal 
Step07. Make "normal" directory as working directory.
$cd ../normal 
Step08. Execute "run.sh"?.(There was no such file. So I used the install)
$./run.sh 
Step09. After successful installation of BOO execute the "spadmin" tool from
program directory under Bharateeya Open office installation. The tool
will help in installing new fonts for BOO.

Subject: [Ilugc] Installing Tata Indicom Broadband under SuSE 9.3
Message-ID: <430869F3.7040704@gmail.com>

Hello all.

I have a Tata Indicom Broadband connection over a USB ADSL modem.

Based on help from people on other lists, I've successfully (after doing 
a lot of tweaking and gymnastics) got my ADSL line *up* in SuSE 9.3.

But now I need to configure the modem as a PPPoATM device. How do I do that?

My VPI = 0, VCI = 32.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <430A1481.2040105@gmail.com>

Hi,

Can someone recommend any good H/W vendors in Chennai/Bangalore who can 
procure Hardware from the United States/Europe ?

I'm tired of scouting for good vendors in Ritchie Street who can provide 
the H/W I need.

I'm in need of :
* SCSI Disks (Western Digital)
* High-end Radeon/GeForce Cards
* High-end Good Motherboards(not the el cheapo Korean ones)

TIA,
Toufeeq

  You can get these, but IMHO, SCSI is no longer competitive with
SATA for most applications.

> * High-end Radeon/GeForce Cards

   Available, for a price. Again, IMHO there's no point in buying a $600
bleeding-edge card when an entry-level Geforce 2MX or Geforce MX
can be had for $25, and can draw maybe around a billion polygons/sec.

   Check out Delta Peripherals - they can provide Tyan dual-Opteron boards
against firm orders.

    Hitech ( a PC surplus dealer across the road from Ritchie St.) has
surprises on occasion - like Emulex Fibre-Channel HBAs, Serverworks
PIII dual-processor server boards, Xeon boards, etc. Not necessarily
cutting-edge, but high-end nonetheless.

   BTW, there are el-cheapo motherboards that are pretty well-engineered.
For instance, the Intel D845PESV, which supports just about any 400/533
FSB P4 is available locally for Rs.1650/-, new. The only problem is that
the CPUs it supports have been end-of-lifed by Intel to make way for
the Prescotts, so you'll have to look for a used P4 to plug into it.

Hi
 
I find Mandriva LE 2005 takes longer time (3-4 minutes) to boot compared to earlier versions. Googling reveals that many people have similar complaint. But there seems to be no solution to reduce the booting time. Any clues?

Please be aware that you can't really get productive with Zope until 
you've done quite a few web apps with it. I would recommend Django 
(http://www.djangoproject.org) which is supposed to be the Pythonic 
answer for Ruby on Rails. What's more, Django is extracted from an 
existing high-traffic production site, so you can be sure that it will 
scale up.

Twisted, Zope, CherryPy, Subway - actually, there are whole glut of web 
frameworks in Python. But rather unfortunately none of them became as 
popular as php. But, php has it's own problems like poor maintainability 
and lack of OO (until recently). If you *have* to do it in Python, I 
would recommend you take a good look at Django. If you're game to learn 
a new language, Ruby on Rails is awesome.

Message-ID: <dd680c2b050821213111ac1851@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

Me and My friend Balavignesh, are ready to volunteer on FSD, sep 10.
I can bring my system there.

as per our talk on mofai, assign us any session so that we can handle that.

dear thyagarajan.
plz clear some doubts.

what about the range of visitors? school children, college students,
Office staff, etc.

Because, we can prepare ourself.

my suggestions are.

for school children.
     They are new to computers. They see computer as a magic.
     We can show them the Educational softwares, Fun things, Songs, Child   
     Movies etc

For College Students.
     They know something abt computers. We can explain the abt FSF, Linux, Gnu, 
     etc. we can show them the office tools, program IDE, Media players, etc.

For Office Staff.
     They know only how to use computers. We can tell them the linux concepts.
     we can show them, Open office, gOCR, SQL-Ledger (Like Tally) etc.


I have seen a tamil knoopix. we can show it in one PC.

             These are just my thoughts. Discuss a lot. Prepare a list
of softwares and tools that each one has to show. We can make the day
a big hit.

wishes,

dear,
T.Shrinivasan.

Message-ID: <4309CFE0.5090707@gmail.com>

Hi every1,
I have a good news and a bad news. the good news is my presence on FSD 
as a volunteer has been approved by my parents. the bad news is i won't 
b able to bring my pc as promised owing to transport costs :-( .
Now I did a kinda survey near my place and based on my experiences here 
r my observations
1. As Srini had pointed out children seem to be more interested in games 
and everything colorful. So showing them a demo of Live duc should not 
be a problem.
2. When it comes to adults, they dont merely work on their word 
processor or spreadsheets. they are more concerned about aesthetic 
appeal, animated windows, themes, icons (i really didnt expect this). So 
can we show them a copy of the more handsome versions of Linux like 
Xandros? Now Open Office runs really slowww on these systems. so we need 
to find a workaround. moreover they also like to listen to some music 
while working. So xmms with the crystality plugin (like dfx plugin). Now 
I have downloaded some nice plugins, so let me know whether i should 
bring a copy of linux softwares on cd. Now we had forgotten about the 
ELX-BIZ; distro perfect for business, as far as licensing is concerned 
it is free to use on non commercial systems. i have a copy of ELX-BIZ, i 
can bring it on SFD.
3. College students prefer the more raw distros ,like slackware or 
gentoo, Anjuta, Eclipse, Kdevelop, Mono are perfect and I guess Parth 
and Prashanth are incharge of those stuff. So this shouldn't be a 
problem at all.
4. Now there is a separate category that falls in between a newbie and 
an expert. they are terrified of command line interfaces (thats bad) and 
prefer the gui for everything. Now I have repeated this several times, 
but webmin is just a thing they need.
5. On SFD we have a major hurdle to break. To non-linux users the very 
word, 'Open Source' refers to Linux only. This is itself forms some 
kinda mental  barrier. We need to somehow banish those myths. One way of 
doing this in my opinion is not to limit our focus on Linux alone. But 
show our guests other open source stuff like, apache, SugarCRM, 
Compiere, thunderbird, proftpd, firefox among others. These are quality 
products, and once thay get to know about power of Open Source, the 
success of SFD becomes a cinch.
So on SFD we are going to cater to a wide range of people. Now these 
observations are based on a suggestions and feedbacks given by many 
people including kids.

Hope the need for PCs is gonna be high as transportation of our own
PCs is problem for most of us. Needs to be taken care of

One thing needs clarification again ! What kinda visitors are going to
dominate the crowd --> School Kids ? College students ? Elder ppl who
want to know abt linux ? This also depends on how far the veent gets
publicized by Birtla Planatorium and how many are really interested to
turn up there ?

As from what Thyagu told, if its going to be school children, then
having too hi-fy stuffs wuld be a bad idea... Suraj Kumar suggested me
to put up "Kturtle" for school kids... So we need a better idea over
the type of audience before we can decide over what to show ?!

Showing just GUI wont be a real part of showing linux, atleast for the
grownups. Linux becomes unique over it power in using the command
line, not many us of windows users know making proper use of  DOS
mode. Atleast for some beginners to linux  we gotta shpw some
programming stuff... atleast hav them in hand for necessity!

hmm yes.. i would much prefer to show gcc/gdb :D but then pushing the
command line on the newbie's face is enough to scare them off for good.
So that why i suggested some IDE's like anjuta or eclipse.

But then if that is not what the target audience wants.. we can probably
look at fresher avenues.

Ok, something just hit me. Most of the audience interested in Linux
should have had some experience or the other regarding computers, Now
giving a talk about Linux to some1 who doesnt even know how to start a
computer doesnt make sense. So our guests should atleast be someone who
has a PC at home or someone who is destined to work with them. That
said, most of our guests should be like just-got-a-pc-last-week type. So
thats our biggest advantage. Now there would be also people who have
just turned geeky or atleast think themselves to be Bruce Eckel, They
would also comprise a major chunk because there's always a notion that
Linux is for geeks and NASA scientists, so naturally they would be
interested. But this really depends on the media coverage and lets keep
our fingers-crossed. Now coming to the point, for the most difficult
category, the one between a newbie and an expert, we can like give
flyers with some basic shell commands. Also what about BLENDER, the open
source 3d tool. It is atleast more or less on par with its commercial
cousins, this should attract younger audiences

Look at the last message in that page. That might help, if you are

So, i want to know few issues on this scenerio,

 ==> what gcc and glibc can be compiled on this RH 9.0
 ==> To create toolchain which is to compile gcc-3.4.3
and glibc-2.3.4,binutils-2.16.1 

Note: I am able to build toolchain for gcc-3.2.3 and
glinc-2.2.5 binutils-2.16.1 with help of kegel's
crosstool

Any body is woking on this and any ideas on this

The cross-toolchain also includes/depends on binutils,
glibc-linux-threads and the kernel you are using.

Which kernel? Red Hat 9.0 is pretty old. 2.6 kernels
use module-init-tools, compared to the earlier
modutils. So, I'd suggest you use earlier gcc versions
if you want to build one for Red Hat 9.0.

I'd highly recommend Kegel's scripts. Did you checkout
the crosstool build results?

Adding to what others have said:

First of all, PHP is not scripting - it is embedding. The PHP
interpreter (mod_php) resides within the web server's address space
(contrast CGI). So is JSP - but the difference is that the JSP DSO
(mod_jk2) passes the interpretation to a full-fledged JVM running as
another service elsewhere (typically on the same box) using a protocol
called AJP. Sort of like mod_fastcgi. Resource-hunger etc. I guess
depends on individual website's source code.

Having said that, the reason PHP is more popular I guess is because it
is very easy to develop websites in PHP. Even though the JSP way of
doing things is probably better than the PHP way.

Apropos to the various suggesstions on the proposed Software Freedom
Day Celebrations on 10th Sep 2005, my thoughts

1.Disucssions on mailing list will be useful only when enough
volunteers turnup physically at the site.

2. Topics to be shown at venue does not depend on what is good to
show.
It simply depends on the volunteers present and what he/she knows.
Additionally what hardware systems we have at site does matter.

3. In the last few demo-days we put Wireless as topic in posters. But
we have to cut sorry figure when no volunteer turnedup for this. 

4. In my opinion only two things matter.
     a. No.of visitors
     b. No.of volunteers and then their committment to task.

5. Let us try to focus our energy in advertising the event and pull
larger visitors.

Message-ID: <20050823044613.6820.qmail@web31015.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi Friends,

Iam maintaining a data server of 500GB.

Sharing these data thro NFS and AUTOMOUT for linux
users (90%).

thro SAMBA for Windows users (10%).

There are 50 staff, Now a days the file accessing
speed becoming very slow and the server too. (because
large size of data mounted on the client system to
access a single/small file)

Even i have setup timeout 300sec. on nfs and
automount. But it is not effective.

At the end of next month (sept) the staff count will
cross to 90-100 nos.

I feel the existing setup won't work.

Is there any alternate solution for NFS,Automount &
Samba.

note: I am using HP High end severs (DML series rack).

Please send me your suggestions.

Thanks in advance.

Babu. J

Hi All,

When a read system call is issued on some opened file etc... why is that
the driver has to copy data from the HDD to kernel and then from kernel
to userspace mem. Why can't it be copied from HDD to user space?
Assuming that the user space mem can be made not to swap out.

 Any Clue on this?

Hi,

> Assuming that the user space mem can be made not to swap out.

We cant assume this :( 
Then virtual memory would not be possible to implement. Remember,
virtual memory is not just about adding swap space and increasing the
amount of memory that processes can use. VM also gives you the
flexibility to map arbitary pages into any address you please thru the
memory mapping tables. Think about sharing text segments of large
programs that are being run by different users on the same system.

Especially when you consider DMA from devices to RAM, there are many
restrictions that apply. So this route has to be taken. The DMA system
does not "see" the mapping tables. It sees physical addresses,
untranslated.

To make the underlying filesystem specifics transparent to the user space 
application.
When you type 'ls' in /tmp or /mnt/windows_drive or /mnt/cdrom it shows the 
list of files , right ? But 'ls' is actually a small binary and how does it 
recognize the filesystem semantics ?
Because it follows a fixed set of system calls like this,

1.opendir() , readddir(), closedir()
2.stat() for every file to get attributes.

(The calls may not be the actual ones, but u get the idea)

Now the VFS layer in the kernel fills a 'stat' structure for every file in 
that directory and ls just retrieves them to display it in user space.
In this manner any filesystem in the planet can be built in linux just by 
defining a fixed of sematics.

Because, the read system call changes the state from
user-space to kernel-space. Data is then copied from
HDD to system RAM/buffers. Finally, it is copied from
kernel-space to user-space using copy_to_user(), for
example.

All addresses in kernel-space are virtual addresses.
You can't directly reference a physical address. You
will need to use ioremap() with it.

Well, you really want to swap out user memory in case
you need some memory.

NFS has some inherent design flaws which make it unscalable.So, I can
assure you that things will become worse when the staff count
increases. May be you can take a look at CODA, which is supposed to be
the solution for problems in NFS. I haven't used CODA myself, but plan
to do so for a lab here in IIT in the near future. So, I would love
feedback if you get across running it successfully (or for that
matter, who has a good running implementation). As far windows is
concerned, whatever be the solution, I think it is better that you
look at windows ports (I think CODA has, may be some googling can help
you) rather than having two mechanisms (I better not start criticising
samba :) ). Can save you quite a bit of administrative nightmares, and
help you enforce uniform disk policies.

As far as automount is concerned, u can go ahead with it. AFAIK,
that's the best linux has to offer, and a very good one at that. That
has nothing to do with what fs you use. You can still use it with
CODA, NFS, or for that matter anything mountable :)

HTH,
it moves on...

Samba is evolving a lot from its birth. I personally suggest it over
other solutions because its already known, continuously improving,
supports both Linux and Windows and if you want Mac too. You can fine
tune Samba to meet your requirements. I heard of very large successful
samba deployment in many places consists 1000+ node or more. So you
can trust on Samba its really scallable IMHO.

OpenCores.org Project is a loose collection of  Free/Open  Hardware
modules. Currently the emphasis is on Digital Modules called 'CORES'.

One Day One Command 
===================

ldd -- Print shared Library DepenDencies.

Summary:

Most of the programs/libraries are linked to shared libraries, like
libc, etc. If a particular shared library, needed by a xyz program, is
not present in the system, then xyz program will not run.

ldd command is used to print the shared libraries required by each
program or shared library specified on the command line.

Examples:

$ ldd /bin/ls -- Print all shared libs needed for the ls command.

$ ldd -v /bin/ls -- Same as above + Extra details.

$ ldd /lib/libtermcap.so.2 -- Print all shared libs needed for this
                              library.

   Softmodems/Winmodems were an experiment to reduce the HW
costs of modems by off-loading some of the baseband DSP 
computations on to the main CPU itself. Most of them have Windows
drivers only - although there has been an active project to support some
of them on Linux. Do a Google search for 'Linmodem'.

   IMHO, Softmodems are a terrible idea apart from the difficulty
of configuring them on non-Windows platforms. Get a decent
PCMCIA hardware-modem, say a Megahertz/3Com/USRobotics/
Xircom, and you should be fine. These are still fairly pricey
in India - shop around.

   In my experience, old Megahertz 1144/2144 14.4 kbaud PCMCIA
modems with XJack connector were the best for Indian dial-up lines;
they very rarely dropped the connection. YMMV - test and check out
some of the 56k HW modems - it's possible that they work better
with electronic exchanges. See if you can test them before buying -
modems vary greatly in quality, and they're critically dependent on
the kind of equipment they're talking to at the exchange end of the
line.

I'll recommend ClamAV (that what I'm using). ClamAV can be seamlessly

We don't have to accept all that mechanically, like computers accept
instructions.

What "current/practical" problems are there?  Do you mean to say that
schools do not have even *one* computer dedicated for teaching cs? 
We, through our governments, are giving away free bicycles to school
children (cost of 10 bicycles = 1 computer), and we could certainly
afford atleast a few computers for each school, and share it just the
way a physics lab is shared.  It would be good if we could afford more
computers so that each student can have one of his own, but that is
not a serious handicap (see footnote). Teacher Training institutes are
governed by many regulations, and imparting training about "new"
subjects could be dealt with routinely, as it is done for other
subjects.  Text books are printed and distributed with public funds.
The Free Software environment has a wide range of tools, documents,
and resources, and we just have to help ourselves.  Inviting
proprietary software vendors into this picture is like inviting a mad
bull into a china shop :)

Try following entry. This is from redhat 7.3 standard xinetd.d/cvs
file
service cvspserver
{
        port    =2401
        socket_type     =stream

        server  =/usr/bin/cvs
        server_args     = -f --allow-root=yourroot pserver

Message-ID: <53821f89050824225636847e49@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Initially I had Redhat Linux installed on a PC. Now I wanted to 
repartition the hard disk in order to install windows also. So I used 
MS-DOS fdisk to remove existing partitions.

After removing existing partitions, I was unable to save new partition 
table information. Both msdos and linux fdisk allows me to create 
partition. But once I come out of fdisk and try to see the changes, I 
couldnt see my changes. I used the "w" command in the linux fdisk to write 
the information permanently.

I googled a lot to find a solution but in vain.

Can anyone  help me to find out why the newly created partition table is 
not written permanently?

Cheers,
Noorul

Dear Dhanagopal,

A windows autoinstaller pack for some of free tamil fonts (some of the
fonts under GPL licence) is available at thamizha.com.

This pack can be downloaded at this URL:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/thamizha/TamilUniFonts.zip?download

A tar file of these fonts need to be created for linux users.  

It would be helpful if somebody in this list help me to create a linux
package of the fonts available at
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/thamizha/TamilUniFonts.zip?download
and send me the package for uploading at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/thamizha

hi,

try with cfdisk or sfdisk

There  are  several  *fdisk programs around.Each has its
 problems and strengths. fdisk is a buggy program that does
 fuzzy things - usually it happens to produce reasonable results. 

fdisk's single  advantage is  that it has some support for BSD 
disk labels and other non-DOS partition tables.  Avoid it if you can.

You cannot use MS-DOS fdisk to remove existing partitions, as it cannot
delete/show partitions pertaining to Linux.

Use the linux fdisk itself to delete all the partitions and create new ones.

DOS fdisk will show other partitions as "non-DOS" and you can still remove them.

Hi,

You can use delpart.exe in microsoft platform.
http://www.russelltexas.com/delpart.htm this will erase linux
partition as well.

Hi all,

I have deleted the partitions. 
I am able to create the partition using fdisk.
I can see the newly created partitions listed using the "p" command. I
used "w" command to write the partition changes permenantly. If I quit
fdisk and use it again to see the partitions, it is showing empty
partition table.

Cheers

   You need to reboot before the kernel picks up the new partition table -
fdisk relies on the kernel copy of the partition table, not the recently
overwritten on-disk copy.

AFAIK dos fdisk will show other PRIMARY partitions as non-dos not

I have rebooted the machine also to see no effect.
Actually I am really puzzled why it is happening so.
I partitioned it such a way that I didn't even miss a single sector.

I have done these things to be in the safer side.

1) Partitioned
2) Used fdisk again to see the partition table to be empty.
3) Rebooted to use fdisk. No use.
4) Again partitioned.
5) rebooted to see the changes. No use.

Once i ran into similar situation, where none or the softwares like,
fdisk, PartitionManager etc helped.
Then i booted into Knoppix CD which has QT Parted in it,
then i made all changes and it went on fine.

try that, good luck,

imo, seems, the problem lies some where else. what's the response
message you get when you exit from fdisk after typing 'w'. You can
also consider trying:

1) boot from knoppix and try fdisk
2) try 4 master/slave primary/secondary combination of your hdd (just curious!)

Linux Gazette, "...making Linux just a little more fun!", is a
free online magazine that provides many Linux tips & tricks.  
URL: http://linuxgazette.net/ and http://linuxgazette.com/

One Day One Command 
===================

timeout -- Send a signal to a program after a certain timeout.

Summary:

'timeout' executes a program (with arguments args) and sends a signal
(like KILL, TERM etc) to it after a certain amount of seconds. It is 
from NetaTalk Project.

Examples:

$ timeout 10 ping localhost -- Run the Ping program and send, by
                             default, a SIGTERM after 10 seconds.

$ timeout -s KILL 10 ping localhost -- Same as above. But here KILL 
           Signal will be send to the Ping Program after 10 seconds.

$ timeout -s HUP 10 sh -- Spawn a shell and send a hangup signal after 
                          10 seconds.

$ timeout -s 1 10 sh -- Same as above. Signal #1 == HANGUP.

Read: man timeout & man 7 signal

Why would you have multiple emacs instances running in different consoles?

Within a single instance, you can easily do the mark-yank-paste cycle.

The best way I could think of, is by running your
emacs editor instances within GNU Screen manager.

Run the first instance of screen by typing 'screen'
at the shell prompt. From then on, type 'screen -x'
on every other virtual consoles or xterms. This
will let you maintain a single set of screen windows
managed across multiple terminals/consoles. To create
a new screen window, try C-a C-c within the screen
session, this is bring up a new screen window with
a shell prompt in it. You can use C-a C-p and
C-a C-n to switch between multiple screen windows.

This way, you can run emacs within a screen session
that spans across different terminals. Now, to copy
what you see in a screen window, press C-a ESC key
and use to arrow keys and Enter key to set markers
and copy the region. Then switch to the other console running the same  
screen session with emacs or other
application, and try C-a ] to paste into the region.

Try 'man screen' to learn how to use screen effectively
to manage your terminals/consoles. There are lots of
features in GNU screen that you will not live
without :-).

Good luck!

My question remains. Why do you run separate emacs instances on tty1
and tty2? Look up the "emacsclient" program's documentation.

If by CLI you mean keyboard shortcuts, then yes, it is very easy to
copy/paste using only the keyboard in emacs. The mark-yank-paste
system.

The "screen" utility is a kind of window manager for text consoles. 

or if you want a much easier alternative you can use gpm - a mouse
server for consoles.

Message-ID: <e977d431050826081311fc306c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
 I was trying to install Suse 64 bit trial edition on my friends lap top 
(ASUS AMD 64 Bit). I downloaded the ISO Image from the Novel Website, and 
tried burning it onto a DVD, using Nero and many other softwares. But For no 
reason that I can think of, the dvd is never written properly. It aborts 
after writing half or less than half of it.
 When I try to boot from the DVD, and do a "Check Disk" on the DVD, i get a 
message saying that the DVD might be broken.
  Has any one succeeded in writing the DVD from the ISO image. If so, please 
guide me in burning the same. As of now, we got only M$ Windows with us, and 
desperately trying to install Linux over it.
  TIA,
 V. Natarajan
 PS: I am on a trip to Amsterdam right now, so, I would like guidelines 
rather than the DVDs itself ;-)

Dear SFD Team Leader,

The following supplies have been shipped to you:
CDs:
T-Shirts: 2
Balloons: 5
Tattoos: 25

We have previously shipped CDs to many team leaders, and many people
have already received them.  If you have not yet received any CDs and
this email does not indicate that we have shipped any to you,
I recommend that you do the following:
1. If you know that you registered before August 4th to receive
  materials, reply to this email to double-check that CDs have been
  shipped to you.  If they have been shipped, check with your customs
  officials to find out if the CDs are waiting in customs.
2. Start burning some CDs!
  The official SFD CD ISO can be downloaded here:
  http://www.theopencd.org/index.php?option=com_static&staticfile=download.html

We have now exhausted our supplies for 2005; we have no more CDs or
shirts to send, and sending balloons and tattoos by themselves is not
cost-effective.

We wish we could supply everyone with as much as they requested, but
unfortunately we don't have sufficient resources for that.  Priority
was given to teams that requested their supplies early and to teams
that held SFD events last year, but we did our best to send every
requesting team *something*.

The U.S. Post Office tells me that everything should arrive before
September 10th, so if you don't have your materials and the day is
approaching please contact your customs officials to inquire.  (We
do not have tracking numbers for any of the packages -- it would not
be cost-effective or even possible for many of these international
shipments.)

Also, we hear that a SFD team leader in Australia was having trouble
with the customs officials; they didn't believe the CDs were free or
that they were intended for free distribution.  So the team leader
opened the box and started handing them out right there!  Hopefully
customs won't be a hindrance to your delivery.

Regards,
Matt Oquist

 By Ryan Naraine
 August 24, 2005
 
 The names roll of the tongue like characters in an episode of
 "American Gladiators." Klez. Blaster. Slammer. Sasser. Zotob.
 Computer
 viruses and worms, all targeting users of Microsoft Corp.'s
 Windows
 operating system.
 
 The first sign of computer worm activity dates back to 1982,
 when a
 program called Elk Cloner squirmed through Apple II systems. The
 SCA
 virus and Brain, written for IBM PC compatibles and Amigas,
 would pop
 up in the late 1980s, followed by the Morris Worm, the first
 documented "in the wild" proof-of-concept that infected DEC VAX
 machines.
 
 Those worms hardly registered on the mainstream media radar but,
 with
 the arrival of Windows 95, all that changed in a hurry. The
 computer
 world has never been the same.
 
 
 March 1999: Melissa Strikes
 
 Named after a lap dancer in Florida, the Melissa worm is the
 considered the first destructive mass-mailer targeting Microsoft
 customers. The worm was programmed to spread via Microsoft Word-
 and
 Outlook-based systems, and the infection rate was startling.
 
 Melissa, created by a New Jersey hacker who would go to jail for
 the
 attack, was released on a Usenet discussion group inside a
 Microsoft
 Word file. It spread quickly via e-mail, sending anti-virus
 vendors
 scrambling to add detections and prompting immediate warnings
 from the
 CERT Coordination Center.
 
 
 May 2000: ILOVEYOU
 
 Still widely considered one of the most costly viruses to
 enterprises,
 the ILOVEYOU worm, also known as VBS/Loveletter or Love Bug,
 used
 social engineering and catchy subject lines to trick Windows
 users
 into launching the executable.
 
 The worm spread rapidly by sending out copies of itself to all
 entries
 in the Microsoft Outlook address book. Anti-virus researchers
 also
 discovered an additional?and dangerous?component called
 "WIN-BUGSFIX.EXE" that was a password-stealing program that
 e-mailed
 cached passwords back to the attacker.
 
 The worm also gained the attention of the mainstream press when
 it
 launched a denial-of-service attack against the White House Web
 site.
 To this day, anti-virus vendors report ILOVEYOU sightings in the
 wild.
 
 
 2001: A Triple-Barreled Barrage
 
 This was the year that malicious worm activity exploded, with
 three
 high-profile attacks bombarding Windows users. First up was
 SirCam,
 malicious code that spread through e-mail and unprotected
 network
 shares. The damage from SirCam was somewhat limited, but what
 was to
 follow would set the tone for a spate of network worms that
 caused
 billions of dollars in business costs.
 
 What will get Windows 95 die-hards to upgrade to Vista? Click
 here to
 read more.
 
 In July 2001, the appearance of Code Red again set the cat among
 the
 pigeons, spreading via a flaw in Microsoft's Internet
 Information
 Server (IIS) Web server. The worm exploited a vulnerability in
 the
 indexing software distributed with IIS and caused widespread
 panic by
 defacing Web sites with the stock phrase "Hacked By Chinese!"
 Code Red
 spread itself by looking for more vulnerable IIS servers on the
 Internet and, in August, launched a denial-of-service attack
 against
 several U.S. government Web sites, including the White House
 portal.
 
 Less than a month later, a new mutant identified as Code Red II
 appeared and wreaked even more havoc.
 
 Still reeling from the effects of SirCam and Code Red, Windows
 users
 would soon have to deal with Klez, an e-mail borne virus that
 exploited a flaw in Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser and
 targeted
 both Outlook and Outlook Express users.
 
 Because Klez required users to click on an embedded e-mail
 attachment,
 the damage was limited, but when later variants appeared with
 spoofed
 sender addresses, it provided the first sign that virus writers
 would
 change tactics to avoid detection. The spoofing of e-mail
 addresses
 would later become a standard trick to attack non-technical
 e-mail
 (and Windows) users.
 
 
 Slammer, Sobig and Blaster
 
 After a worm-free 2002, Windows users had to contend with
 another
 three-pronged threat - Slammer in January 2003 and the Sobig and
 Blaster attacks in the summer.
 
 Reminiscent of the Code Red worm, Slammer exploited two buffer
 overflow vulnerabilities in Microsoft's SQL Server database,
 causing
 major congestion of Internet traffic throughout Asia, Europe and
 North
 America.
 
 The worm infected about 75,000 hosts in the first 10 minutes and
 knocked several ISPs around the world offline for extended
 periods of
 time.
 
 As Microsoft struggled to cope with the Slammer fallout, there
 were
 two new outbreaks in the summer with Sobig and Blaster squirming
 through millions of unpatched Windows machines. The
 fast-spreading
 worms crippled network infrastructure globally and the cleanup
 and
 recovery were estimated to be tens of billions of dollars.
 
 Blaster was particularly nasty. The worm spread by exploiting a
 buffer
 overflow in the DCOM RPC service on Windows 2000 and Windows XP
 and
 also launched a SYN flood attack against port 80 of Microsoft's
 windowsupdate.com site that is used to distribute security
 patches.
 Microsoft was able to dodge the bullet by temporarily
 redirecting the
 site, but the media latched onto the story and forced the
 company to
 make major changes to its patching schedule to help customers
 cope
 with the patch management nightmare.
 
 
 2004: Sasser Strikes
 
 After Slammer and Blaster, Microsoft customers complained
 bitterly
 that the company's unpredictable patching schedule was causing
 hiccups
 in the patch deployment process. In October 2003, chief
 executive
 Steve Ballmer announced a plan to release security bulletins on
 a
 monthly cycle, except for emergency situations.
 
 The new plan is greeted warmly, but the worm attacks showed no
 sign of
 letting up. In January 2004, the MyDoom worm was spotted. A
 mass-mailer with a payload targeting the Windows operating
 system,
 MyDoom quickly surpassed Sobig as the fastest-spreading e-mail
 worm
 ever. In addition to seeding Windows machines to create botnets,
 MyDoom was programmed to launch DDoS (distributed
 denial-of-service)
 attacks on Microsoft's Web site.
 
 In early May, Sasser hit. Exploiting a flaw in the LSASS (Local
 Security Authority Subsystem Service) component, the Sasser worm
 squirmed through unpatched Windows 2000 and Windows XP machines.
 Sasser was particularly dangerous and spread rapidly through
 vulnerable network ports.
 
 Microsoft is credited with reacting swiftly to contain the
 Sasser
 spread but, as the latest Zotob attacks prove, the time to
 exploit an
 unpatched flaw has narrowed significantly since the launch of
 Windows
 95 10 years ago.

Linux is a UNIX-like OS, thus it follows semantics
and conventions that exist on the UNIX platform.

On all UNIX platforms (Linux included), secondary
storage devices should ideally be mounted in order
to access the filesystem within them. Most CDROM
hold a filesystem too, just like the hard disk
or floppy disk.

On UNIX, all devices are generally accessible as
files which you can open, read, write just like
any other files - CDROM device is no exception
(unlike in Windows platform where you access
secondary storage devices by mostly hard-coded
drive letters). If you try reading the device
file used to represent CDROM device on UNIX,
you'll end up accessing the entire CDROM
as a single file (like an ISO image file).

But,if you want to access the filesystem within
the CDROM, then you'll need some mechanism, by
which the filesystem could be "attached" to a
directory which is known as the "mount point".
This is what the mount command does. Thus, by
mounting a CDROM to a mount point, you can access
its contents by navigating the mount point itself.

In case you wish to remove the CDROM, you'll need
to "detach" CDROM's filesystem from its "mount
point". Thats what the umount command does.

However, most Linux distributions these days
with KDE or GNOME automatically mount the CDROM
when you double-click on the CDROM icon, and open
the mount point folder for you, creating seemless
interface/abstraction to access your CDROM, much
like in the MS Windows platform. This is usually
done by helper programs/daemons called autofs or
supermount.

I hope this clears your doubt. Any good introductory
book on UNIX/Linux should explain this concept in a
better way :-)

Message-ID: <1125183283.3870.141.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Some affordably-priced reprints available:

o Apache Cookbook Rs 250

[Apache HTTP Server is an open source HTTP web server for Unix-like
systems (BSD, Linux, and UNIX systems), Microsoft Windows, Novell
Netware and other platforms.

Apache features highly configurable error messages, DBMS-based
authentication databases, and content negotiation. It is also supported
by several graphical user interfaces (GUIs) which permit easier, more
intuitive configuration of the server [1]

The Apache HTTP Server is developed and maintained by an open community
of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation....]
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_server

o DNS & BIND Cookbook Rs 250
[The Domain Name System or DNS is a system that stores information about
hostnames and domain names in a type of distributed database on
networks, such as the Internet. Of the many types of information that
can be stored, most importantly it provides a physical location (IP
address) for each domain name, and lists the mail exchange servers
accepting e-mail for each domain.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS

o Eclipse Cookbook Rs 350
[Eclipse is an open source platform-independent software framework for
delivering what the project calls "rich-client applications" (as opposed
to "thin clients", this means the clients perform heavy-duty work on the
host running the application). So far this framework has typically been
used to develop IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), such as the
highly-regarded Java IDE called Java Development Toolkit (JDT) and
compiler that come as part of Eclipse (and which are also used to
develop Eclipse itself). However, it can be used for other types of
client application as well, see the popular BitTorrent client Azureus
for example. Eclipse was originally developed by IBM, but is now
developed by the Eclipse Foundation, an independent not-for-profit
consortium of software industry vendors. Many notable software tool
vendors have embraced Eclipse as a future framework for their IDEs,
among them Borland and IBM Rational.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_%28computing%29 ]

o Jakarta Commons Cookbook Rs 375
o Jakarta Struts Cookbook  Rs 400
The Jakarta Project creates and maintains open source software for the
Java platform. It operates under the auspices of the Apache Software
Foundation, and all of Jakarta products are released under the Apache
License.


Subprojects Major contributions by the Jakarta Project include tools,
libraries and frameworks such as:

      * Slide

PRESS RELEASE: SOFTWARE FREEDOM DAY 2005

September 10th is Software Freedom Day, a worldwide celebration of Free
and Open Source Software (FOSS). With a series of global events we want
to showcase the excellent range of FOSS now available and show how in
can be used to save money and gain freedom in every sector of the
information society.

Over 200 groups from over 60 countries will participate in this second
annual Software Freedom Day, by organising local events ranging from
simple meetings in the park to install-fests and 'SpeedGeeking' events.
The non-profit organisation Software Freedom International provides
guidance in organizing SFD and some material support, but the volunteer
teams around the world have done the bulk of the work and will put a
local spin on the day. For those who have not yet planned anything for
SFD it's not too late. Local groups simply organise their own events,
though official materials have now been allocated.

FOSS is licensed in such a way that it gives you the end user the right
to use it freely for private or commercial use. You also have the right
to inspect and even modify the underlying source code. You can give away
or even sell the original version you received or one with your
modification (though you may be required to pass on the changes you have
made). You are not required to pay royalties to previous developers.

FOSS is important even for those without interest in source code. The
release of the source allows external observers to inspect the true
functioning of the program, which means that you as the end user can be
confident that the program treats your private data with respect. You
(or someone else) can verify that your data is not being passed on
without your knowledge and you can be sure that your data will always be
accessible and not locked away in a proprietary format. Also, the
release of source code has in some cases spawned large communities of
volunteer developers who have in turn provided the world with highly
useful, and entirely free software such as Linux, OpenOffice, and
Mozilla. These communities can in turn foster local IT industries in
developing regions without the need for large up-front investments. The
freedom of software is important for everyone, not just software
developers.

i tried the ICW but it generates an error 2 on activating it. i also tried =
with kppp which have detected the modem and the ports created by the progra=
m.  it also generates an 'NOT CONNECTED' message.

This is a common mistake that people do. They use Emacs like they
use Notepad. Somehow they find switching between consoles/windows
easier than switching between buffers. :-S

> 1.assume i am the news editor/chief reporter of newspaper/mag/tv channel/publication;
We welcome you sir,

> 2. my questions after reading the above press note are

> 2.1 so what, why should i write about all that/broadcast/telecast all that

We request you to write about the computer usage in daily walk of
life. You see computers at a Dtp shop, Internet cafe, Provision store
etc. Bring out the parameter of legitamacy of the software used in
these places. Generally people are more concern about buying the
computers, is just buying the hardware parts(spares which you can
touch and feel).People not concern about the legality of software copy
installed on the machine. Pirated VCDs of movie is hunted by the
police because of the film industries pressure. While Software pirated
cds will be sooner or later  hunted under the same spectrum of crime.
Buying Legitimate software cost money . Having bought a software
doesnt mean to make a copy of the software , The case of buying the
second machine forces the user to buy the second copy of the software.
FLOSS (Free Libre/Open Source software) is one which is available free
of cost and you can copy and use the software  for any number of
machine you have. With FLOSS you can distribute the software to your
friends for their use. FLOSS is open source, which means you can
modify the software to fit your need, for feature which may not be
there in its original form. With proprietary software one has to buy
operating system, office packages , 3rd party tools like a pdf viewer,
cd toasting software separately, with FLOSS it is bunch of software ,
most of the common requirement  can be catered with floss.

> 2.2 who says all the above?why has nobody signed it?if its wrong, who will authenticate this?

The press release  was mailed to me by Mr.Omma from Software
freedomday.org  (Henrik Nilsen Omma <henrik@softwarefreedomday.org>)
He is the person of authenticity for the mail.

> 2.3 where should i send my camera or reporter?

We request you to send your camera person/ reporter to Tamil Nadu
Science and Technological Center(B.M. Birla Planetarium Complex)
Kotturpuram,Chennai 25 on
10/Sept/2005 . The function starts by 10am in the morning.

> 2.4 if i spend on transport/reporters/camera/communication, what "news worthy " stuff can i get?

You get the news about the FLOSS(free libre open source software)
which is an alternative to the popular OS which is used. The programme
is focused on the awareness about floss. Hands on report about free
softwares in action, which can be used in an office for word
processing, spread sheet, presentation manager. You get the news about
FSF(Free software Foundation) philosphy, how the operating system
installed. How an office/home can be supported with FLOSS.We are show
casing Linux demo day where we are demonstrating educational softwares
which are free of cost, we are also  going to demostrate software
which is widely suits an office/ home environment.

> 2.5 whom should i contact for knowing more about all this, in chennai

Our forum www.chennailug.org is one resource place where you get
guidance and support for free of cost from the experts. You can mail
the issues on linux and it will be discussed, may it be adminstrative
or technical aspects of the software.We meet every second saturday of
month. So direct interaction on FLOSS can be discussed.

To tell you the truth, I've been there, done that. When I moved from
to Firefox for the first time and started using its Tabs, I found it
took some effort to retrain myself to use Ctrl-Tab to switch between
tabs rather than Alt-Tab that I had used earlier to switch between
browser windows.

dear mr thyagu,
that set of clarifications was too good; so fine infact that it saves much precious time; i suggest you face the press too and talk to the reporters as a center point as u hv evolved so much of basics; i just could sit on the comp only now n so i will edit the press note with the above view points and send you tomorrow(today if possible!)
best regards

Hello all,

I discussed with Raman and Ramanraj regarding Press Reporter's awareness
program, before we inviting press people, we should arrange FSF, Open

2.My own suggestion is to implement the above in a well planned and execute=

;(idea 1:capture the opinion of many open source users on your webcam and p=

4.there is no press meet;only a press note for favour of publication, now. =

Dear members,

I spoke to the marketing head of xenitis which has introduced aamara
pc, the budget pc priced less than 10k. What sort of sponsorship  can
we ask from xenitis.

 We can ask for ten pc for Linux demo day. The transportation will
then be their job. This will less our hurdle on machine resource. We
will ask them to sponsor some banners, empty cds.

This is sent as a proposal to them, taking that in account , what kind
of sponsorship can we ask in for?.

Sincerely,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

Check whether that PC is Linux compatible. If yes then, We can ask
them to provide 10 PCs for the LDD.

Pretty nasty one too, I guess. One of my friends' Dell

Message-ID: <a2a2c867050829042387dcbd5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I tried compiling a 2.6.12 kernel and have run into a few problems.
Initially , I got a "VFS - unable to sync " error and the kernel panicked.
I tried creating a .img file using mkinitrd and adding the appropriate line 
to grub and booted again.
It worked.But the boot process then threw up the error " 
/sbin/mingetty[1773]: /dev/tty2: No such file or directory" 
hung. 
Right now , I have RH 9 in my pc.
If any more information is required I'll be glad to provide it.

Any pointers ?

Sujith.

I installed module-init-tools-3.1 before compiling the kernel.
modprobe --version says "2.4.22" .

Do I have to update my /etc/rc/d/rc.sysinit file or something ?
Because while booting it is rc.sysinit that throws the error msg.
It tries to invoke /sbin/mingetty from /etc/inittab and apparently /dev/tty* 
are just
not getting created.

Subject: [Ilugc] Character inputs?
Message-ID: <becccadf05082905281430f9e8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a fundamental query in C? Kindly plz clarify the doubt.

In C character inputs can be obtained using some functions like
getchar(),getch(),scanf() etc.. These inputs gets terminated only when
end-of-line is given.

I will explain my problem with an example?

I have two process communicating each other using some IPC technique.
one process gets an input from the user and the other process has to
display what the user has given as input. When I use built-in i/p
reading fns., i can display only as a string(since the inbuilt
functions terminates only when end of line is given).  I need to echo
as character by character. When the user presses a key the i/p process
should read it and the o/p process should echo it IMMEDIATELY.

can anyone suggest me some solution to this problem

By default, the terminal is in Canonical or cooked mode. If you change
the mode to non-canonical mode, then you can get input char by char.
Read man tcsetattr for more info.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0508292059120.30649-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

Since 1998, Linux Weekly News (LWN) has been covering the Linux & Free
Software communities development activites in a concise, well-written,
and objective manner. URL: http://lwn.net/

One Day One Command 
===================

ogginfo -- Gives information about Ogg files.

Summary:

Ogg Vorbis is a new audio compression format. It is different from
these other formats because it is completely free, open & unpatented.
It is roughly comparable to other formats used to store & play digital
music, such as MP3, VQF, AAC, and other digital audio formats.

ogginfo reads one or more Ogg files and prints information about
stream contents. It will detect (but not correct)  a wide range of
common defects, with many additional checks specifically for Ogg
Vorbis streams.

Examples:

$ locate .ogg -- Search for some OGG files in your system.

$ ogginfo /usr/share/redhat-credits.ogg -- Show the detailed info 
                                           about that ogg file.

$ ogginfo -q /usr/share/redhat-credits.ogg -- Show warning and errors
                                              messages.

$ ogginfo -qq /usr/share/redhat-credits.ogg -- Show only errors.

You can get the source and build one from
http://www.billion.com/support/download/fd/fd1.htm . However, the USB
drivers seem to be highly unstable. I would suggest you exchange the
USB modem for a ethernet based one, if you are looking for a long
connectivity (always on).

Message-ID: <a8f990120508291913408ddc22@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,
The Linksys WRT54G Wireless B/G WiFi/Broadband Router/AP is
available locally at Ritchie Street for ~Rs.4k (YMMV, shop around).
This is a fairly decent price for the earliest/best such product in the
market.

The main advantage is that it uses an embedded Linux distro based
on busybox, uclibc, etc., and a fully open-source alternative called
OpenWRT can be flashed on it to improve its features, including
adding support for community mesh networking, etc.

Do a Google search for 'WRT54G Linux' to understand its features.

AFAIK, there is no tool avail to directly convert from MP3 to OGG.
Usual method is MP3 -> WAV -> OGG (see the example). In this method,
output quality will be reduced. For best result for convert the
original WAV file to OGG.

Desktop X does not load because of a BIOS bug. This has been updated
in recent Dell laptops though. So, to get X working you need to
download the 855wrap.tar.gz from
http://www.chzsoft.com.ar/855patch.html ...

This is a little OT from the above, but yet connected:

Fredrick P Brooks wrote in the Mythical Man-month:

"One of the most impressive developments in software during the past
two decades has been the truimph of the Windows, Icons, Menus,
Pointing interface - or WIMP for short.  It is today so familiar as to
need no description.  This concept was first publicly displayed by
Doug Englebart and his team from the Stanford Research Institute at
the Western Joint Computer Conference of 1968.  From there the ideas
went to Xerox Palo Alto ....."

The screens of today are too small in pixels to show details and the
"so-called 'desktop metaphor' of today's workstation is instead an
'airplane-seat' metaphor.  Anyone who has shuffled a lapful of papers
while seated in coach between two portly passengers will recognize the
difference - one can seen only a very few things at once.  The true
desktop provides overview of and random access to a score of pages
..."

Now:
[1] We have projectors and therefore more real estate should be
possible the "Desktop" (imagine a real 4 feet x 2 feet "Desktop"). 
What XF86Config would suit this end?  Would it be possible for X to
use one config for the laptop screen and another for the projector?

[2] Computer monitors are the most serious health hazard to the
environment. While used, they emit a fair amount of radiation (enough
to advise preg. women to stay away from them during pregnancy) and
even the more modern LCD screens are either expensive or not as
convenient as a projector.  If any of you are hardware engineers,
please think of mnf. web cam sized projectors, that could render a
decent 4' x 2' screen, that may be cheap, affordable, and may be even
bring the price of computers to less than Rs. 5000/-

Shakthi, the report was about a virus more commonly known as "measles" ;)

[OT] They are so worried about *one* measles case found there but we don't 
care much about their corporates contaminating our land with more deadly 
"inventions" like btcotton, ddt, rBGH etc (see 
http://www.preventcancer.com/consumers/general/milk.htm ) Writing mere bug 
free computer programs is so difficult, and I wonder how they are allowed to 
play freely with genetic code, and are even blessed with "patents" for the 
games they play.

Yes, but the actual resolution of most projectors is no more than
XGA (1024x768). This is not as good as many high-end notebooks
with SXGA (1440 x 1080) or higher resolutions.

There are high-end projectors for digital cinema applications that
have resolutions as high as 3072 X 2048 (or even higher), but these
are very expensive - not less than $250k or Rs. 1 crore / unit.

expensive DLP projectors are ~Rs.50k today, which is a fraction of the
price at which DLP was originally introduced ~20 years ago. Acer has
such a low-end DLP projector available in India now.

RE:   ./slmodem -alsa -c INDIA hw:1
should be:
   ./slmodemd --alsa -c INDIA hw:1
or
   ./slmodemd   -a -c INDIA hw: 1

Note that you can 
# su - root
# cp  slmodemd  /usr/bin/
putting slmodemd on the COMMAND PATH.  Thereafter it will suffice to:
# slmodemd --alsa -c INDIA hw:1 

See if using --alsa cures the problem

Also your /etc/wvdial.conf  looks as if was produced by first running the ICW and then the last section was appended by a:  wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf
This may be causing a problem  You can however for testing run.  
# wvdialconf wvtest.txt

To correct the /etc/wvdial.conf, do
# cp /etc/wvdial.conf  /etc/wvdial.conf.0
and then edit /etc/wvdial.conf  into the following:

[Modem0]
Modem = /dev/ttySL0
Baud = 57600
SetVolume = 1
Dial Command = ATDT
Init1 = ATZ
Init3 = ATM1L1
FlowControl = CRTSCTS
Carriier Check = no

[Dialer BSNL]
Username = purelife
Password = uma579
Phone = 172233
Stupid Mode = 1
Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
# Once there is a success, try commenting out the following line, which is a ICW default
Stupid Mode = On
Inherits = Modem0

For usage of KPPP, it is probably necessary to first run its setup, This must be done as a User too, not just by root

Report back presently.

I had this with Gentoo 2004. But, as soon after you
choose a kernel, the log will be displayed full
screen.

Terminology, please.

Linux 9.0? Linux is the kernel. Which distribution are
you using?

Copy it from the CD to the system and compile it?
Depending on the distribution, there are tools that
can help you install it. Or, you can install it
manually too.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0508301935430.15102-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

Since 1998, Linux Weekly News (LWN) has been covering the Linux & Free
Software communities development activites in a concise, well-written,
and objective manner. URL: http://lwn.net/

One Day One Command 
===================

ogg123 -- Plays Ogg Vorbis audio files.

Summary:

Ogg Vorbis is a new audio compression format. It is different from
these other formats because it is completely free, open & unpatented.
It is roughly comparable to other formats used to store & play digital
music, such as MP3, VQF, AAC, and other digital audio formats.

ogg123 reads Ogg Vorbis audio files and decodes/play them to the (by
default) standard sound card or specified device(s). Input files can
be read from the system, or URLs can be streamed via HTTP.

Press Ctrl C to stop.

Examples:

$ locate .ogg -- Search for some OGG files in your system.

$ ogg123 my.ogg -- Play on the default soundcard.

$ ogg123 -q my.ogg -- Quiet mode. No messages are displayed.

$ ogg123 -v my.ogg -- Verbose mode. Show more info.

$ ogg123 -x 4 my.ogg -- Play the file in 4 time faster.

$ ogg123 -y 2 my.ogg -- Play the file in 2 times slower then the 
                        normal speed.

$ ogg123 -d esd my.ogg -- Play the file using ESD Device.

$ ogg123 ~/MusicDir -- Play  all of the files in the ~/MusicDir
                       and its subDirs.

$ ogg123 -d wav -f my.wav my.ogg -- Convert the OGG to WAV.

$ ogg123 -d oss -d wav -f my.wav my.ogg -- Listen to a file while you
                                           write it to a WAV file.

Read: man ogg123 (More examples are available in man page)

HTH :)

Search for "linux kernel recompiling" and you would get numerous,

choose a kernel, the log will be displayed full
screen.


I am seeing a blurry and hazy display, when i commented the splashimage
in grub.conf , i can see the text mode better..

and after the kernel loads also there is no change...
are they any arguments we need to pass to kernel?
is there any manual for all possible arguments we can pass to kernel?

Dear All,

On Sep 10th, ILUGC (We) planned to celebrate the IInd World Software
Freedom Day (SFD) by conducting two programs at TNSTC  (Tamil Nadu
Science and Technological Centre),  Birla Planetarium  Complex,
Kotturpuram, CH- 25.

1. One Day FOSS Training Program for 50 School Teachers
   (Needs 5 Volunteers).
2. Linux Demo Day, Open to All (Needs 15 Volunteers).

Apart from volunteers, We need following :-

1. Nearly 10/15 PCs with Linux based OS.
2. Help in transportations.
3. Banner/Poster Preparation.
4. Spreading the LDD messages to Colleges/Schools.
5. Volunteers and Topic List (Update the Wiki Page).
6. PC Lenders List (Update the Wiki Page)
7. Donate Money for LDD Expenses.

ILUGC SFD Wiki Page: 
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/List_of_Volunteers_%26_Machine_Lenders_for_the_LDD%2C_SFD_at_TNSTC

I request the volunteers to select a demo topic and update the wiki
page. Plz don't say "Any", that really leads to lot of confusion 
during the demo day.

Take this Opportunity to contribute something for FOSS.

Bye :)

One Day One Command 
===================

oggenc -- Encode audio into the Ogg Vorbis format.

Summary:

Ogg Vorbis is a new audio compression format. It is different from
these other formats because it is completely free, open & unpatented.
It is roughly comparable to other formats used to store & play digital
music, such as MP3, VQF, AAC, and other digital audio formats.

oggenc reads audio data in either raw, WAV or AIFF format and encodes
it into an Ogg Vorbis stream. 

Examples:

$ locate .wav -- Search for some WAV files in your system.

$ oggenc snd.wav -- Produces output as snd.ogg.

$ oggenc in.wav -o out.ogg -- Produces output as out.ogg.

$ oggenc in.wav -q 6 -o out.ogg -- Produces the output with specified 
                         quality, -1 (low) & 10 (high), 3 is default.

$ oggenc snd.wav -t "MyTrack1" -a "MyName" -l "MySound" -o snd.ogg --
                                   Add Track info in the output file.

Read: man oggenc

HTH :)
