Subject: [Ilugc] phpmyadmin login issues
Message-ID: <CA+WoLT=ptRa=i6jTCZv+yKBFK6TWBJKwW1+xYPkHsfpJd5_KOw@mail.gmail.com>

this is seriously irritating. after going through blogs, stackoverflow and
others I couldnot find solution to this problem. Or may be I am missing a
simple thing.

I was uploading about 8 gb dumped file to a database and it got interrupted
due to system restart. after then I am unable to login to phpmyadmin.
the login redirects me to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php . the login
credentials are correct.
I am not sure if the interruption of upload made a difference. I can log in
to cli mysql and do everything. but not through browser. I checked with
other browsers too but no luck.

any idea would be appreciated.

Do you not feel that your tax money is spent towards Linux in that case 
? ( or well, more onto open source ) rather than contributing it all 
into the select pockets of specific vendors

Error:  POST Content-Length of 91 bytes exceeds the limit of -1048576 bytes
in Unknown on line 0, referer: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php

Problem and solution:

On some 32bit systems PHP will take the memory settings like 2000M or 2G and
convert it to the integer number of bytes by not performing a boundary
check. A number starting at 2G or 2048M will be -2147483648 bytes then.

Some PHP versions cap this at the top, so it won't go into negative numbers
(that is the 32 bit signed integer limit).

If you want to achieve the maximum possible number of bytes on such a system
then, use *2147483647*. This is equal to two gigabytes minus one byte.

Alternatively if you need to deal with large data, consider a 64bit system.

Additionally you should consider the following:

According to PHP Manual the memory_limit setting is the more important one.
If it does not offer enough memory, the post-data size-check then will pass,
but PHP would not have enough memory to actually handle the post-data. You
will get another error than, that the memory exceeded. So when you configure
your PHP, take care that post_max_size is smaller than memory_limit.

In your example the memory_limit is 128M, so it can not process post-data of
a size larger than ~128 Megabyte.


So fixing the limits my problem is solved :)

Cheers...

I am planning to buy few Arduino Boards. I gone thru some Indian

price. Any suggestions on low cost and reliable boards?

I am looking Arduino + Ethernet and Arduino + Bluetooth combination,
any suggestions/recommendation?

Simple labs have their own Arduino board. Bought a few of them. They are
working well. Also had a good experience interacting with the owner of this
place. But their priority is robotics training to kids. The boards does not
seem to be their primary business. Also these boards were large because they
are single sided ones.

I moved on to Rhydo Labz
http://www.rhydolabz.com/index.php?main_page=products_new
They are spark fun http://www.sparkfun.com/ distributors. They are very
professional and well stocked.

Hi Bharati,

We have a sister concern named Kits'n'Spares. They also deal in such 
boards. If you are interested then can talk to them for best possible 
price. Would like to know how many board will be required.

FSFTN team had a detailed discussion with him when the previous tender
was released. He seems to u9nderstand the depth of issue. However we
did not feel that he can amend the decision. we had handed over a

I think Courts can look in to the issue and amend as appropriate.

I am not sure whether this can be challenged in court. This is a
policy issue of the government.

May be under some clause like this is not a proper tender since it blocked
all but one company to begin with?

Government's policy can be challenged in Courts. Recently, the hon'ble
Supreme Court issued notice to TN Govt on the freebies as promised in the
election manifesto.

Sir(s),

I feel the one thing that can happen by challenging through court is :
this tender gets delayed for atleast 6 months.

I think this will help the government - particularly the C.M. of TN,
since she can get more time on this Freebie, and can escape (not
necessarily 'escape' ) but can get a fair breather. Also they can cite
this as an example, and delay others too. The sufferer is the students
(and also to a certain extent - the tax payers, in the long run, if
the govt. chooses to go only with proprietary software).

It would be definetely better to do something like our Linexpert
Systems - Mr. Bhaskar - where we could educate more on this to the
actual users - who if they find this better, can always install Linux
later, and inform the govt, for the next lot to change the specs.

my two paise.

I don't understand this "However we did not feel that he can amend the
decision.", Do you mean, He cannot amend the tender, because he is not
behind the tender or as he cannot amend it as it has been already out?

Hi,

A year back, I bought a Arduino Duemilanove from SimpleLabs. They now sell
the Arduino UNO for 1360/-
You can even save the courier charges by going to their place in person and
buying it.

Not sure about bluetooth, but they do seem to sell a Xbee shield for Rs 2500
and an Ethernet shield for Rs 2300

It is little tricky.  Tendering is about how many suppliers/quotations you get and not about how many manufactures. 

I have raised this in my office(off course no use, falls on deaf ear). Normally specification should not have brand name. In case it has what is called Proprietary Article Certifcate (PAC) should be issued. PAC means the person drawing specification certifys that there is only one brand that is suitable for the present purpose.

 In the present case since syllabus has Windows they can justify inclusion of the same. And we are justified in requesting Linux, by the same logic as Linux is also part of the syllabus.

What a complete disappointment! I thought it was a good compromise to
provide a multi-boot option but now they've removed Linux completely out of
the spec. The question now is, are the students allowed to install Linux on
their own or will it void the warranty and support? If they are not allowed
to do so, they should at least be allowed to run Linux on VirtualBox. Will
it be possible for them to at least pre-install, say, VirtualBox and a
Ubuntu VM image on these laptops?

The sufferer is the students

I think the sufferer will comprise Students, Common man by paying more taxes
( in some way or other) , and more importantly the Linux.

Why linux will suffer?

It is due to the Windows comfort the students get. Since they are
comfortable with one OS then they reject Linux even it is a better system.
How many of us still use word, ppt, even though we have openoffice which is
equal/better than MS office.

My opinion is, if students get's one OS, let's say Linux and they are
forced( yes) to use and learn Linux and Linux oriented applications like
openoffice etc.  Majority over the period will be fan and followers of Linux
and supported applications than Windows.
MS did the same in the 90's

This would be good for FOSS  Community as more Students would come in.

[Off Topic] [and nothing personal to the above quote]
I hope the courts help in pulling out this entire thing of free laptops.
Windows, Linux, Microsoft and Bill gates are irrelevant to hungry children.
This 90 crore might be well spend on starving kids and kids who require
medical care. I hope our politicians get their priority right. We as a
country are not there yet to enjoy these kind of luxuries.

Dear Mr. Senthil,

Have we ever done (better) - when we are forced to do something with.

Linux - have evolved (I feel) - not because of somebody forced us to
use with ...
- it was more of people wanting to do more, which they are not able to
(or with more difficulty) some thing ...

The scene in the mobile platform - where Nokia was giving only symbian
(earlier), was not able to pull-off for more time.  People buy Andoid
phones because they can do more with it.... how many are knowing about
android now (the users who are using it) Android - Linux connection.
Nokia is not able to sell even though microsoft WindowsPhone is being
packed along with Nokia - now a days - on high-end phones.

"When the Student is ready .... The teacher appears" - an old and
perennially truthfull statement.

Instead of making this a complex issue, it would fetch excellent &
fruitfull results in the long run.  That is what is prompting Ubuntu
and all others giving this excellent OS free of cost, and making more
efforts to reach people.

Our concentration should be to reach more & more people, instead of
cramming something on their throat. Even if you install linux on the
laptop, it is not sure that they will use Linux instead of Microsoft
Windows.

These students - who are getting educated in colleges / schools - are
not dumb, but are made to join the crowd, and at this point of time,
it is Microsoft Windows 7, and later 8, etc.

If they perceive that Linux is 100 % rewarding for them in the long
run .... they would certainly go for it.

How many of us are really helping new people to get solutions in this
forum without they getting hurt (no, I am not going to start a war),
for their problems.  It is still being perceived even by computer
users who are more than 10 years of usage, feels that Linux is
difficult, and 'getting help is very difficult'.  It is this perceived
thing that should be taken care off.

To make this Linux more interesting, we should organise for people to
get trained : Freely of course, Languages like C, etc, and every month
simple competitions should be organised in localities, and taking them
into State Level (Imagine IPL's Success).

Organising a competition - say for 20 people, in basics, database,
GIMP, etc should not be difficult - say after 3 months of coaching.  A
person who is 12 to 18 year old feel much satisfied with a certificate
from a body like ILUGC, etc. The competition can be every 2 months, in
each place.  This will make people / students / parents to encourage
people to even think about Linux.

we can always find sponsors for these sort of events - in every place.
I am trying to do something in mumbai, very shortly.

My simple 2 paise (which now has no meaning / worth)

>>medical care

God forbid, What would have happened if   our parents had invested all their
money for OUR future health care instead of education and deprived us of our
IIT or BITS pilani or  BE education !! citing our health reasons !

Can I say that health care is more important than education ? NO

In reality sometimes people starve themselves to get educated. Why ?

Empowering the masses by giving them access to information (translates to
free laptop and internet) directly helps in alleviating the poor and
downtrodden.

So let the govt release the laptops to these poor kids and once they start
using it, browse the internet etc they will switch over to whatever o/s they
feel like. SO first let them get the damn laptops !

How many of us can say that they were born with linux ? I for one ,worked on
windows initially before switching over to linux.

I would like to mention the remarks of  my neighbour the other day.

"Our children also will have laptops "their" children also will have laptops
how can we allow this ??"

I rest my case

Dear All,

sometime back - a month I think - when trying to install Libreoffice
3.4 (not from Ubuntu repository), without uninstalling Libre office
3.3, I installed it, and it was successful too.

But felt that it was still booting to 3.3, so I uninstalled through
synaptic, and then installed Libreoffice 3.4. It was successful too,
and i have all the latest features.

But, i am getting this message every time I open Libreoffice - word,
calc or anything ....

in a pop up box :

LibreOffice 3.4
---------------------
Error loading BASIC of document
file:///home/office/.libreoffice/3/user/basic/dialog.xlc/:
General Error.
General input/output error

Can anyone suggest how to solve this..

It is only slightly irritating, and also embarassing, when I show it
to my customers, whom I trying to make them install Libreoffice, when
they have Microsoft Office 2003 / 2007 etc.  (I am not a seller of IT
- but power conditioning equipments).

Thanks

Well for one, my parents were not as poor as the government and they could
invest on my health and my future education. Also if I had a sibling who had
a major health issue and my parents required the money they had to treat the
other child, I would have not got my great education and I would have
accepted it with all humility.

Can I say that health care is more important than education ? NO

Well I differ! Health care IS more important than education!
I feel more sorry for a dying child than ever care about a child getting
education

Education is not about laptops. Did Dr.Abdul Kalam have a laptop when he was
kid?

Yes I agree on the point of empowering with information. But at what cost?
Kids I know hardly ever use their computers for getting empowered. They
typically use it play games, enjoy social networking, stream videos and as a
huge juke box of songs and videos. I don't want my tax money to be used for
this.

Anyways, see, this also adds to my case. We as a society is this immature,
dumb and class conscious. Let's remove all of these and spend money on
these.

Yes the dying child will be saved but that child will still be one notch
down in the society when compared to other so called elite children  who
were fortunate to have  parents who could afford both health care and
education.

Good point. Yes and that is exactly being done now with the laptops and
etc and some forces are bent on stopping the reforms and that makes me sad.

And you know kids use it for browsing wikipedia too nowadays. So do you

Times change. I used to go to British council earlier for all the

student without a laptop/computer ?  It has become a necessity of life.

After all they ended up amending the tender silently, my theory is that they
are twisting and turning the tender to favour "someone" who cannot  or don't
want provide  Linux compatible PCs. It would be interesting see who is going
to win the tender!

It is better to write to the communist party and inform them what is going
on!

In today's paper, there is an article on the same, although it claims 
the change is due to a price difference,

------
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/article2419753.ece

"The plan to install Linux (Tamil) software has been scrapped, as per 
the new proposal. ?We wanted the price to be as competitive as possible, 
and the installation of open source software was costing us Rs.100 more 
a machine,? said a top official in the IT Department."
------

Is it possible that the service/support cost for linux is more expensive 
when compared to windows ? since there are a large no. of technicians 
who provide support for windows. I wonder why the high price.

Although, they do mention that the laptops will have open office and 
other Tamil softwares, so that is a plus.

There's all probability that a vast majority of these laptops will end up
being used for totally unrelated purposes - games, music, movies, and porn.

I'm sure the government can come up with a cheaper and more effective plan
to educate our children - hiring and training better teachers, improving
school infrastructure and syllabus.

Dear Friends,

This is in response to the removing of Free Software from the latest
tender of ELCOT in the name of so called cost-cutting to procure 0.9
Million laptops for students in Tamil Nadu.

The Free Software Foundation, Tamil Nadu strongly condemns this move and
we have already initiated steps against it by working with sympathetic
media groups and other like minded user groups & communities. This
specific issue and the larger implementation of the laptop scheme are key
to the spreading of Free Software in the State, especially among the
younger generation.

Let us join together and fight for the cause.

Please find the latest news letter on the above issue as follows,

Most likely they will be resold. Imagine my surprise when I saw TN 
govt-supplied tv set at a relative's place in Hyderabad. When I asked 
him about it, he said something like, "oh, I went to TN on an 
assignment, and somebody who works on the (construction) site sold it to 
me for 2k". I guess that's the fate of most PDS-supplied rations too.

Vamsee.

Duemilanove (Bought online from Tenet Tech for ??1360 shipped, IIRC).
When the say 'fully compatible' do they mean programs will run or do
they mean shields are compatible as well?

Today's The Hindu carries clarification by the Minister for IT, TN has clarified that the laptops will be loaded with BOSS by ELCOT itself. I think all of us should be happy.

Respected Editor,

With respect to
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/article2419753.ece

I seriously don't like the decision of our TamilNadu Goverment to skip Linux
Based operating system in favor of Windows.  The reason being that if
students begin to learn just windows during their academics they would think
that the world is just made up of windows and end up paying a whole deal of
money to MNC abroad for setting up a company of their own because they need
to purchase licensed copy of Windows OS.

We have our own free Operating System developed in India by CDAC (Center for
Development of Advance Computing) called as BOSS (Bharath Operating System
Solutions) http://bosslinux.in why don't we have this installed on our
freely distributed laptops ?

*Before Independence we were scrapped of our resources by some foreign
nation,  Now we are allowing our self and the future generation to be
scrapped of their resources by giving them just windows instead of the path
to freedom, SHAME ON US [?]*

Regards,
Bala

No reason to be really happy.. knowing well that a huge amount of tax-payer
money is going to be forwarded to Microsoft's coffers. Did ELCOT at least
try to cut a deal with Microsoft to get free/subsidised academic licences
instead of paying for them at market prices?

I am curious to know if the Govt would also provide free Internet access to
the students. If not, many would not afford to have access to Internet at
all. That would also mean when they use windows, the antivirus software will
not receive updates but the laptops will receive a steady supply of malware
through the flash drives they share.

Subject: [Ilugc] Security breach on kernel.org
Message-ID: <CA+MGHipeshHWP-JePdET_TXUNbUnyxTrub-qjr_1ahMfi-avDA@mail.gmail.com>

Interesting info at kernel.org site:

Quote from the kernel.org site:
<quote>

Earlier this month, a number of servers in the kernel.org
infrastructure were compromised. We discovered this August 28th. While
we currently believe that the source code repositories were
unaffected, we are in the process of verifying this and taking steps
to enhance security across the kernel.org infrastructure.

What happened?

Intruders gained root access on the server Hera. We believe they may
have gained this access via a compromised user credential; how they
managed to exploit that to root access is currently unknown and is
being investigated.
Files belonging to ssh (openssh, openssh-server and openssh-clients)
were modified and running live.
A trojan startup file was added to the system start up scripts
User interactions were logged, as well as some exploit code. We have
retained this for now.
Trojan initially discovered due to the Xnest /dev/mem error message
w/o Xnest installed; have been seen on other systems. It is unclear if
systems that exhibit this message are susceptible, compromised or not.
If developers see this, and you don't have Xnest installed, please
investigate.
It *appears* that 3.1-rc2 might have blocked the exploit injector, we
don't know if this is intentional or a side affect of another bugfix
or change.

What Has Been Done so far:

We have currently taken boxes off line to do a backup and are in the
process of doing complete reinstalls.
We have notified authorities in the United States and in Europe to
assist with the investigation
We will be doing a full reinstall on all boxes on kernel.org
We are in the process of doing an analysis on the code within git, and
the tarballs to confirm that nothing has been modified

The Linux community and kernel.org take the security of the kernel.org
domain extremely seriously, and are pursuing all avenues to
investigate this attack and prevent future ones.

Message-ID: <CAHCdRWg7iy2zf==iu2UVG4bj3c8dTWktgC4Drhzh7qwNryW52A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

sometime back - a month I think - when trying to install Libreoffice
3.4 (not from Ubuntu repository), without uninstalling Libre office
3.3, I installed it, and it was successful too.

But felt that it was still booting to 3.3, so I uninstalled through
synaptic, and then installed Libreoffice 3.4. It was successful too,
and i have all the latest features.

But, i am getting this message every time I open Libreoffice - word,
calc or anything ....

in a pop up box :

LibreOffice 3.4
---------------------
Error loading BASIC of document
file:///home/office/.libreoffice/3/user/basic/dialog.xlc/:
General Error.
General input/output error

Can anyone suggest how to solve this..

It is only slightly irritating, and also embarassing, when I show it
to my customers, whom I trying to make them install Libreoffice, when
they have Microsoft Office 2003 / 2007 etc.  (I am not a seller of IT
- but power conditioning equipments).

Thanks

Hi,

I have no idea about Ruby gems, but I hope this may help.

1. The xmpp request from their own web UI is given the highest precedence
and it will override all others.
2. If you have set offline in the web UI and logged in from other client,
you will be online only in that client. Web UI will still show you as
offline.

Regarding not able to chat with others, Facebook uses the uid (an integer
id) as the primary identifier. So it has to be uid at chat.facebook.com, i
guess.

What you have put up is great news. However, this decision has not
been made just because some IIT students intervened but as a result of
a two-month long campaign in which the Free Software Foundation, Tamil
Nadu organised signature campaigns, met IAS officers and the Minister
and worked closely with the media.

This, i think would be evident from the fact that the article in The
Hindu which first raised the issue has references to FSFTN's work on
the issue. See..
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/article2419753.ece


Also, see..

http://www.hindu.com/2011/06/26/stories/2011062662590400.htm

FSFTN has students from IIT and also a larger group of professionals
and students from outside. Our first step in this campaign was..

http://www.fsftn.org/tn-students-laptop-petition

and more recently..

Interesting !

Going to BOSS is a good move , atleast a public funded distribution is
going for some public initiative aka getting used .
BOSS team needs to ensure that
1 .The distribution quality is maintained
2. All the hardware is supported out of the box .
3. Load the distribution with software which is really essential .
4. Make sure that they train some groups and make them test the distribution.
5. *listen* to feedback from community(debian , local ILUGC ) and try
to work towards making it more community oriented .

Yes ofcourse, facebook uses the User id(uid) as the primary identifier as
well as an username it uses.. for example my username is 'prashere' and i
will always use my Email to log in into facebook, in order to use facebook
chat from other clients like PIDGIN, EMPATHY..etc we can be able to login
using Username itself, that is working in PIDGIN via xmpp but not in my ruby
application, thats what am wondering

Oh, I guess my reply was ambiguous. You can use the username or email id to
login but the chat client should use the uid for getting any data (chat, for
example) from facebook. In  empathy, you can see that the previous
conversations dialog shows the users by uid, not username or name. It's a
bug with empathy but at least it helps understanding it ;)

So you have to check if the ruby gem uses uid for sending and fetching chat
messages.

HTH :)

not clarified - I do not see anything to show that this was the work of IIT students - credit
goes to FSFTN and also a bit to ILUGC (since we meet at IIT, this may have led to the confusion)

First mount the filesystem containing samba with acl options.

Investigate man getfacl and man setfacl.

Date: Tue, 06 Sep 2011 06:29:41 +0000

Dear Kenneth,

Betonmarkets.com is looking to recruit a Senior Perl Developer
(telecommute position). This is a senior position for experienced
candidates. Would you, or any person you know, be potentially
interested in this opportunity?

Betonmarkets.com is a financial betting website operated by Regent
Markets Group Ltd., a company with offices and staff in a number of
jurisdictions. Founded in 1999, the company has grown to become a
leader in the fixed-odds financial betting field, with over 200,000
registered accounts and over $120 million/annum turnover. The company
is affiliated to Regent Pacific Group, a company listed on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange.

We are looking to recruit a Senior Perl Developer to further develop
the betonmarkets.com website and systems. The successful applicant
will have strong experience and talent in software development
(notably in a Linux/Perl environment), the ability to work within and
manage a very large codebase, is conscientious and self-motivated,
exhibits interest (and preferably prior experience) in the financial
markets, and shares the company's vision of creating a competitive
market in limited-risk financial betting products.

The job will entail refactoring legacy code into properly
architectured Moose objects, development of new financial betting
products, interfacing to financial data feeds, development of
financial charting facilities, integration with payment, marketing,
accounting, and risk management systems, development of website
white-labels, and working with our financial mathematics (quant) team
on the proper code factorization of complex derivatives pricing
models. The company has a developer-lead culture and the successful
applicant is expected to participate in the development of the
company's IT strategy.

The position is full-time and applicants may be located anywhere in
the world. The company leverages the latest internet-based
communication tools to manage distributed Scrums and projects.

If you would be interested to know more about this position, kindly
email me your CV. Please feel free to forward this email to any
person in the Perl community who may be interested in the
opportunity.

Best regards
Jean-Yves Sireau

Dear luggies

We are yet to get confirmation about the venue. I feel not much time is left for preparation. The enthusiasm seems to be low as well.

We are working out an alternate plan. We will be approaching colleges and schools to conduct an event in their own premises. We are targetting atleast 10 colleges/schools for this. We need volunteers to talk+teach in these events. The volunteer can choose their own topic apart from general intro to FOSS. 

Whoever can spare 17th Sep for this cause please mail to the list or to me. Colleges need minimum 1 week to plan. Kindly reply before 9th Sep 2011 evening so that we can talk to colleges.

read carefully. The subject line say how to shut down windows from
ubuntu. Which i think is somewhat relevant since it is from ubuntu.
But what the above mail asks is from windows from windows, which i
think is no way relevant to linux mailing list and is appropriate in
windows mailing list. So please read carefully the mail.

Hope you are all good! I got into PSG Institute of Management through TANCET

And schedules here are just hectic.
Meanwhile I got a call from Prof. Sundaram from KGISL Institution,
Coimbatore
He asked me to address his students about getting into GSoC.
I'm just helpless guys, as I'm having extra works in college even on
weekends.
They have a LUG here in Coimbatore and I really would appreciate if someone
is willing to help them.
If someone is interested, pls mail me offline.
I'll give you the professor's number :)

Greetings,

FStival is a Free Software Festival conducted annually, since 2004, by
GNU/Linux User Group of Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai
and GLUG-Madurai in commemoration of Software Freedom Day. The
objective of FStival is to create awareness of Free Open Source
Software (FOSS) among the general public of South Tamil Nadu. Over the
years, FStival has been a venue where students of various age groups
and domains, professionals (of both IT and non-IT fields), enthusiasts
and the curious have come together to get introduced to FOSS, interact
with each other and share their experiences. Every year, the
participants bring in empty CD/DVDs to copy Free Software of their
choice from the exhaustive repository at Thiagarajar College of
Engineering (maintained by GLUGOT). We will have many stalls in which
various Free Software tools are demonstrated.

This year we have planned to have talks as well, on Free Softwares and
all are invited to give one :)

This year FStival is celebrated on SFD - September 17, 2011 at
Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai. All are invited and
welcome to be a part of FStival and celebrate freedom. More
information can be found at - http://fstival.org and
http://glugot.tce.edu.

If project involeves Linux machines, I wonder why windows should exist at all!

In any case, check Samba authentication details.

* If you want to shutdown a Windows machine from another Windows machine:
  Use something like "shutdown /s /m \\computername" (For this you
need an Admin account under a domain controller setup). Check
"shutdown /?" for the various options.

* If you want to shutdown a Windows machine from Ubuntu:
  Install samba-common binaries and use the "net" tool to issue a
shutdown command.
  See http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/net.8.html#id2533232

* If you want to shutdown a Ubuntu machine from Windows:
  Install openssh-server in Ubuntu. Using putty from Windows, SSH to
the Ubuntu machine and issue a shutdown.

 It's not clear what you want to do or why you want to do it. You may
even login to your windows machine through a remote desktop connection
(through the rdp client in Windows or rdesktop in linux), and get to
the shutdown menu with CTRL+ALT+END.

In PHP 5, all overloading methods must be defined as *public* but PHP
versions prior to 5.3 didn't really make a fuss if you defined your
overloading method as *protected*. The Config.php file in the version
of Zend framework you are using, overloads __isset , __unset methods
but defines them as protected. Starting in PHP 5.3, the public scope
requirement for overloading methods is being enforced by throwing a
warning like the ones you are reporting. This issue is fixed in Zend
Framework version 1.6 (see
http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3417). If you don't want to
turn off those warnings (using error_reporting() or php.ini), you
should upgrade to the latest version of Zend framework compatible with
your application.

I assume you want help finding them?
Also assume you are looking for ARM based boards (not x86)

Good, professional boards with good support
http://www.embeddedarm.com/products/arm-sbc.php

Great for hobby and simple projects
http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10106

Very cost effective, but practically no documentation or support
http://www.rhydolabz.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=127
These are mostly chinese boards with base install having chinese GUI.

There are lot more that I can add to the list, but you need to tell us what
you want to do with the boards...

Arun

Memory of 512 mb - 1 gb will be a tough spec to find in the embedded market.
Unless of course if you are looking at industrial computers, which will be
larger than the external hard disk size you are looking for.

Thanks for the suggestions. I was planning visit Chennai. So I thought
of picking few boards. As my program is changed, I am buying the
boards from SG itself.

In SG, Arduino Uno board cost is ~ Rs 1100/- (SGD 30/-)

Arduino is a open hardware which means it is circuit is readily available
and anyone can make their own board using these circuits and can name it
your own name.Arduino boards are generally used in robotics,for programming
microcontrollers like PIC,8051 etc you need programmer but in arduino it is
readily available and you just have to program it and use it for your
applications to learn  further  go to http://arduino.cc  and  you can see
the latest trends about arduino,PIC
here<http://www.google.com/trends?q=arduino%2C+pic+microcontroller%2C+basic+stamp%2C+microchip+pic&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0>

Specifying the type of application(s) you have in mind would be
helpful in giving you specific suggestion.

For network applications search for alix, pc engines, soekris, routerboard.

A google search for the  string "Error loading BASIC of document
file:///home/office/.libreoffice/3/user/basic/dialog.xlc/"  in your
message gave me this link which can perhaps solve your problem.

Hopefully, the above solution resolves the problem.

Alternately, remove the $HOME/.libreoffice directory and start afresh.

The Arduino board is based on a combination of open source circuit design
and a software suite comprising of an open source C/C++ compiler and a rich
bunch of libraries. It allows people without a strong embedded app
development background, but with a bit of C or C++ knowledge to create stuff
which can interact with the real world. Trust me, the first time you get to
write a program which can interact with the real world (not the user,
database or a web server), the feeling is incredible. Arduino gives this
power to an average individual who might not have a strong
electronics/embedded/development background. With the arduino board, you can
write 10 lines of C code and get a light to blink or a servo motor to turn
10 degrees.

The Arduino IDE is java based and runs in Linux, Windows and Mac OSs. The
compiler is a GCC compiler. The core of the hardware is a AVR based 8 bit
micro controller.

Linux boards are extremely diverse. It comprises of any board which runs
Linux as an OS. Typically these boards (in the context used in
the previous threads) are used in embedded systems. They are typically
small, run of a single power supply and do not have a hard disk for storage.
Most of these boards will not even have a VGA out to connect a monitor. They
are used in places where a real world device or rig requires intelligence to
operate. You can write the control application in any language the Linux OS
supports (like C, Python, Java etc). Linux takes care of the low level stuff
and you take care of the functional logic to control the device. There are
versions of  the Linux kernel which are tuned for real time performance
which are used in mission critical applications where a decision may need to
be taken within nano seconds of an external event. In most cases the Linux
OS and your application will reside on a flash based storage system.

Linux boards are a very generalized term and the above write up is extremely
limited and tries to just give an intro to the concept.

Arun

Dear Arun,

I did just what you have suggested - went to the site
<http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1682977>, and did the same.

1. went to the hidden folder .libreoffice in /home and to the last folder
2. there was a folder /basic - one file called 'standard' and another
one called 'script.xlc'
3. i opened the script.xlc - through 'gedit'
4. deleted all the contents in the script.xlc
5. and saved the same file as 'dialog.xlc'
6. closed the libreoffice, and opened once again.

Now, there is no error pop-up message - as it used to come earlier.

I do not know whether this is actually a solution, or it just removed the popup.

Anyway, for now, it removed the irritating one which was spoiling,
whenever I open in front of my customer, and tried showing it to them
for a replacement of Microsoft Office.  This is not commercial, but
just trying to introduce FOSS - for their personal use / office use. I
dont sell IT products.

Thanks once again Mr. Arun.

Step 1.  Start a new thread with an appropriate subject line and *not*

Recently Prabhu Ramachandran showed (off?) his Kindle. His experience is
that he started reading more and that included mathematical stuff too.

But the price point is likely to be closer to 15k IMO

Kindle is what best fits the above requirements.
Optionally, there's a MeeGo netbook by Samsung, model number N100, it
costs approx 12K.

I dont own a Kindle but I have read reviews that say if the primary purpose
is reading then Kindle is the best choice over tablets, netbooks etc. I
think a new Kindle is expected soon. So plan accordingly.

But Kindle is against the spirit of FOSS. Amazon can & have in the past
erased the books in Kindle remotely, without permission from user.
My other doubt is technical. Can we manually copy pdf and/or epub books into
kindle and read? (I mean without purchasing from Amazon? There are lot of
free(legal) books out there.)

I have searched online shops for an e-book reader, for months but yet to
find one that has no bells (like 3G, wifi, camera) and just uses e-ink to
render e-books. One reason is, most of them want you to buy books from their
online stores and not copy pdfs from your system. If they remove those
cosmetics cost would come down.

Not if the PDF is the most read format or, the books have lots of
images. And, would the documents/articles have Indic ?

On the contrary, these hardware devices are pretty much subsidized. The
business model is to provide the hardware at a low price (probably even at a
loss) and to make money in the content. The same way a DTH operator works.
This business model requires certain hardware features like 3G to make it
easy for the user to buy the content as easily as possible.

Arun

I have Sony ebook reader and a Nook Color 7" android tablet.

ebook readers are nice for reading, and Calibre (calibre-ebook.com) can
be used to convert various text/pdf formats to ebook reader formats.  Native
support for PDF varies across ebook readers.  You may lose tables
and other complex formatting after conversion.

The Nook Color is well supported by Cyanogen ROMs, and is a good
general purpose tablet. Android apps are available for nearly every document
format I have come across.  Unlike laptops, a 7" tablet means the physical
size of the tablet including bezel, not 7" screen.  For serious reading, you
need at least a 10" screen.

Things I regret about the Nook Color: small screen, no 2G/3G (wifi only),
no GPS, no microphone, no cameras.


After using both devices for several months, I still read most of my texts
on my cheap/cheerful Acer netbook (I use an external monitor/kbd/mouse
when at home/office).  I have a extended battery so my netbook lasts
most of the working day on a single charge.

My recommendation: get a netbook!

I think those are plus points. Because there will be no distraction. The
moment you are hooked to Internet there are thousands of things that
will pull you out of reading mode.

It's trivial to go offline when you do not want to be interrupted.

For me not having 2G/3G means no email on the go, and hence
my tablet is confined to my house's wifi area.

But looks like crap :). It's not in the interests of Amazon to promote 
an open standard like PDF, so the books are best seen in .mobi or their 
proprietary .azw format. There is no resolution adjustment for PDF, so 
the text looks tiny and almost unreadable. Calibre can do a decent job 
of converting from PDF to Kindle-readable formats, but it's not perfect. 
I've seen images gobbled up text looks all sorts of weird.

Your best bet would be get the Nook (e-ink, non-color one). At least it 
supports pdf, epub and other open formats correctly and doesn't try to 
take your freedoms away. If you want color and turn it into some sort of 
cheap tablet, you should get the Nook Color and flash it with CyanogenMod.

Vamsee.

We have to do something for this Top posting problem. This can't go on.. We
can all send requests to Gmail guys asking them to provide an option to add

try starting with a : CC=/usr/bin/gcc ./configure

if that still does not work for you, paste in the actual check from your
configure test here in an email, its possible that is broken and/or
doing the wrong thing

Our Indian languages (CTL) are not well supported in many tablet env.
So best is Net Book.

Message-ID: <CAHCdRWj-qb36buJ84QK=VUXhJmWi4LgMMkpmpvN9NGw+hhtr1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have yesterday installed Kubuntu 10.10 (other OS - Ubuntu 10.04 & win xp).

I have used Ubuntu Tweak - in ubuntu 10.04, and I love it, to clean
all cache & packages in it.  It is very clean.

Is there any way to do the same in Kubuntu 10.10 - any tool, or even
command line for these.

Thanks

Thats surprising but I am not sure if  I have to agree . I got kindle
for my dad who really wants tablet features and was expecting a touch
device because he owns a touch screen phone . I am guessing that he
uses it only if he has some reference books and uses the home wifi to
check out wikipedia page . The best thing he liked in Kindle is the
internal dictionary where you highlight a word and get the meaning .
Also a TTS was welcome but not so usable thanks to the voice .

OTOH I have a netbook and I do read lot of books on it and am kind of
happy with it . Netbooks are damn cheap and we get to do almost
everything we want on it other   than huge graphical tasks . A netbook
with  good battery life and the least possible weight is a good
competitor .

Pavithran

        If you are talking about apt cache, you can use

sudo apt-get autoclean

or

sudo apt-get clean

Sir,

I tried that yesterday itself.

But, somehow it did not proceed on anything.

I know this info is just not enough, but is there anything like
ubuntu-tweak for Kubuntu. (i googled for that too, but, could not find
any).

Any other suggestions.

Since Kubuntu is a ubuntu distro, I guess you would still be able to 
install ubuntu-tweak on kubuntu, just like it is possible to install 
KDE applications in ubuntu. Have you tried it?

Dear Sir,

I did'nt try, since when I googled - found in reviews, that sometimes
it will not run properly, or something like that, etc.

So, did not want to spoil a very good (surprisingly I liked KDE !!!)
installation.

Any other suggestions, please.

      When you say it did not proceed on anything, what exactly do you
mean ? Do you still see all the packages in /var/cache/apt/archives ?
If yes, I guess it is a bug most probably. Thanks

Bottom posting though is definitely better than top posting,but it is
**not** the way to go. Consider that there is a long thread going on
for weeks. if you use bottom posting of a line, then it would see as a
essay and nobody would be patient enough to read through the entire
essay to see what you are seeing. The right solution is trimmed
posting and trimmed posting is something the user has to do. No
software can guess what you are referring to before hand to trim the
post for you. If someone is not capable enough of trimmed posting
(excluding  ignorant users) then he is not fit to call himself a Linux
user. As linux is all about customization and tweaking and coding
which requires some level of understanding of software workings. You
cannot blindly click something and expect it to work. Which is what
usually the case for windows users. Here it is all about editing text
files (conf files) or creating text files (code). So such a staunch
windows user does not deserve help. if he wants windows like in linux,
better dont switch to linux , instead stay where you are comfortable
(windows) and be foolish.

In my previous mail, I quoted the entire text, so if there is such an option
in gmail labs, it will be really "comfortable". All I need to do is click
reply and begin typing. And if I need to trim, then I simply put the cursor
here and hit Enter and it will trim. This is a small 'customization' which
you shouldn't be opposing if you are such an avid Linux user. In labs, there
are options like switching the chat to right side and even adding a "beta"
to the Gmail logo. Remaining of your post is unnecessary.

Oh my god. Why suddenly started another Linux vs Windows war? I just wished
for a "comfortable" feature in Gmail and you are saying only Windows users
want comfortable features and they are foolish.. What's wrong with being
comfortable? I like to use Vim because I can "comfortably" do many tasks
without taking hand from home row. Nothing personal dude. Anyways sorry for
going off-topic.. ;)

Seems like I'm not the only one.. I went to this forum to suggest about it.
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gmail-labs-suggest-a-labs-feature

But there are atleast 6 or more threads citing the same reason (avoiding top
posting in discussion thread) I mentioned. I just bumped one thread. I hope
it meets Google's eyes.

+1.  Reduce the number of devices in your carry bag.  Some of my
clients with iPAD come to me for USB file activities.

The new SONY VAIO netbooks with AMD E350 APU look very nice.

Although, the AMD E350 has been available in the US circa 2Q/2011, I
have not come across any motherboards in the Mumbai retail channels.

Here is a list of E350 based motherboards that I have come across so
far.   E350 supports h/w virtualisation and the ASROCK mobo does
support "SVM" in the BIOS; not sure about the rest.

Message-ID: <CA+YdgaprZrzv_qnsQKstnH724S75-nFrFRTNARP7NTBn0H+Utw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

The first ever Software freedom day was celebrated in Mumbai with a
Full Day of activities (and Pizza slices for all participants!)

While this whole event was spearheaded by One of our esteemed ILUGC
Members Shri. Thiyagarajan with Prof. Kannan M. Moudgalya,
(http://www.che.iitb.ac.in/online/node/52) was the long and powerful
staff of the pear and thrust which I have never seen defore given that
SFD ws to be organised with just two days of preparations. My
prostrations to him.

The keynote was delivered by Subrao M. Nilekani Chair Professor Dr. D.
B. Phatak,Department of CSE, Kanwal Rekhi Bldg,
Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, Mumbai, India.

And then we had our own Shri Asokan Pichai who expressed his views
about software patents in particular.

This was followed by presentation on Spoken tutorial
(http://spoken-tutorial.org) by Prof Kannan.

After the tea break the lightning sessions started: honestly they ware
progressing at lightning speed enlightening the minds of audience on,
inter alia, QT, Scilab, Eclipese, Kodeplay, GCC research etc. I
apologise If I have not listed others as each were given 12 minutes
and was so absorbed that I did not make notes and sequences.

It continued after Lunch (Pizza!) break.

There were so many that the original event was scheduled close time
was extended by 2 hours till 1800 hrs as against the planned 1600 hrs
closure time.

There there was a Quiz session (in which I got a nice comfortable Jute
bag with a T-shirt for answering the Question passed on to audience
about the Author of Minix (with whom Linus Torvalds still has
difference of opinions regarding kernel structure -- micro and
monolithic), my first one in all these years after attending umpteen
number of sponsored and Walk-in events of vendor driven and other
seminars and conferences.)  :)

Then there was a birds of feather session where each participant
introduced themselves.

There were about half a dozen stalls showcasing working projects
ranging from Arduino to blender based animations to CFD Software such
as OpenFoam (http://www.openfoam.org/) to robotics (e-yantra) etc.

I also had the opportunity to meed Shri S. Sivakumar who posts
frequently in this ILUGC list and and avid FOSS Evangelist.

All I can say that I was spellbound and thrilled by the experience.

Of course, my advance apologies for the typos and if I have not
mentioned the events of the day in order as I am still wrapping my
head around the wide range of topics and still gloating and floating
in the experience that I had throughout the delicious day.

E&OE

Aobove are my personal humble opinions. The official report may be
posted later perhaps by the organisers.

Happy news. ILUGC child(??) prodigy Kumaran (now a +2 student) delivered a lecture in the above celebration. Impressed by his work, the Chairman of Jaya Engineering College Prof.Kanakaraj during his valedictory address, offered him a free seat - free for all the four years- if he chooses to join this college.

On behalf of ILUGC I wish to thank the Chairman, faculty and Jayafoss club for this offer.

The error message is clear enough - the file does not exist.  Most
likely it is dependent on some package that is missing.

How did you install the package?

I am not familiar with Arch Linux but I expect it's package management
utility would highlight dependencies.

Installed cups via pacman (package manager provided by arch).

usblp is available in AUR, Installed it through yaourt and it showed
error that it couldnt install because files conflict, so i removed
cups and then tried to install usblp. It installed fine and now my
printer gets detected, but it showing printer filter missing.

September Monthly Meet Announcement
===================================

Date & Time
-----------
24 Sept
3:00pm to 5:00pm

Venue
-----
Zilogic Systems,
Fourth Main Road,
Kamaraj Nagar,
Thiruvanmiyur,
Chennai

Location map: http://www.zilogic.com/contact.html

Agenda
------

 1. Lightning Talks - 60 min

    * PySerial by Rengarajan
    * 3D Programming with VPython by Abdul
    * String Formatting with str.format() by Vijay Kumar
    * with statement by Roshan / Vijay Kumar

    If you would like to give a lightning talk, just
    come prepared, we will be able to accommodate you.

 2. The Mighty Dictionary, by Brandon Craig Rhodes - 30 min

    Both newcomers and experienced developers alike love Python's
    built-in data types, especially dictionaries! But how do
    dictionaries work?  What do they do better than other container
    types, and where, on the other hand, are their weaknesses? Using
    simple, vivid diagrams that show the secrets of how the
    dictionary is implemented, and a series of progressively
    interesting examples of its behavior, we will train the Python
    developer's mind to picture what the dictionary is doing in just
    enough detail to make good decisions, as your data sets get
    larger, about when to use dictionaries and when other data
    structures might be more appropriate.

Regards,
Vijay

Hi
@Aravind anna, @Raman P, @Vignesh anna, et al

 First of all a big thank you... Yes FOSS is good... :-)

 Actually my given topic for the speech at Jaya Engineering College was for
creating a Fedora remix, but I couldn't do that because all the students
were 1st years who didn't know anything about Linux. So I proceeded to talk
to them about the history of Free Software and why they should use
GNU/Linux.

 My thanks to the college chairman for offering me a seat..

 But IMHO, the most important person for helping Jaya Engineering College is
Kumaran Sir, the HOD of CSC dept. So a big thanks to him too for helping to
bring the college to this level.... :-)

With Regards,
~~Kumaran R

Dear balaji sivnath,

even at my office we have the same canon LBP 2900B, and for this, I
have downloaded :
- Canon CAPT_Linux_v1.90.EN.tar.gz - from canon site.
- I am using UBUNTU 10.04, and the printer is working very well - with
all the features accessible.

I think there are a lot of tips from Ubuntu site / Canon site - for
installing in Linux.

Try this, and if successful - tell others.

with warm regards

Rebooting is no answer.

You have to check whether the Ethernet cable is plugged in and find out the
status of the link connectivity both physically and in software.

Look for the green and amber LED on the port. Green is for loop
connectivity/power
 and amber will blink on activity.

In addition find out whether iptables is turned on.

I assume that you are connecting the two computers with a modem/router in
between. Ensure that both the machines have correct DHCP IP address leased
by modem/router. If you use a switch in between or if you connect the two
computers directly give the correct IP addresses in both machines.

If possible check the Ethernet cable with a LAN tester or with another
working network.

Suggest you do the following:
a) check physical connections. I'm assuming that is ok as the machine
was accessible on the network at some time.
b) Check if the ethernet interface has IP address.. ip ad sh or ifconfig etc.
c) Check if both the machines are in the same subnet if connected
thro' a switch.
d) Check if you can ping the other machine from the server.
e) If pinging the server from the other machine fails, check iptables
config on the server.

Hi All,

We plan on having a workshop for entry level developers and enthusiasts, and
anyone else who is interested.
It will be a day of learning/working and socialising.

The event will happen on the 9th of October (2011) from 1.00pm Brisbane time
- which should be about 9am for those of you in .LK/.IN

For those who cannot attend it in person we will have google hangouts and a
skype channel open to join in on the fun! :)
We will also try to record screencasts of the event for those who are unable
to make it; but we really want you to join us for fun and socialising as
well!
If your in Brisbane you do get free food and beverages (it's on me) <-
Interested yet? :P (Sydney-siders grab that low fare flight, it will be
worth it!)

The agenda is as follows (length of presentation may change):

1. GitHub Introduction and Basics usage workshop (30mins).
2. Qt Compiler Basics of Interface and Compiling e-kalappai project (30mins)

Lunch Break

3. Introduction to current status of some thamizha projects (30mins)
4. Hackathon Start
- Ideas and Brainstorming session
- Forming working teams
- Working on project

Tea Break

5. We will finish of with some more talks and socialising over dinner
(unfortunately not available online :P).

Please join us for this event... and even if you are not able to be
physically there, maybe you can team up with local friends and have your own
"international event" alongside us.
If there is demand for it... I will be happy to bring the event to Melbourne
and Sydney as well; or you can do it for your own city/town/place.

Please show us interest... so we can add more topics or features if you
request it.

We are open to suggestions. Hopefully this will be first of many
workshops+hackathons.

Regards,
Arunan

Hello Chennailites,
I think we could run a parallel session here in chennai. A place to
come together and a reliable connection for live streaming could
connect us.

Any volunteers? I can help organizing it. Any offers for the venue? A
single broadband for the streaming would be the bare minimum
requirement.

Kindly try volunteering.

Ankit Fadia is well known to the uninitiated... Well schooled security
folks regard him to be a script kiddie and nothing more with a good PR
engine. In any case, he is hardly the kind of person one would credit
with changing the country.....

The problem is socially aware people consider India Today in the very same
fashion. So, IMHO, no point in mailing a loser 'news' outlet about it. ;-)

Dear Sir,

I was shocked to see Ankit Fadia featured as a game changer. No one
seriously involved in computer security would ever engage him for
anything. He is a conman peddling old (and mostly irrelevant) tricks. I
suggest you try to independently verify claims before you publish them.
At the very least check out wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankit_Fadia#Authenticity_of_claims

http://attrition.org/errata/charlatan/ankit_fadia/

I wonder how many of the other people featured are frauds?

We also keep seeing articles on how POLITICIANS are helping "India Grow" and
how Indian efficient and effective Indian Govt. operations are,  but all we
do is read and throw it away.

Likewise we should just ignore this and do something productive, because
neither does India Today(or any other commercial press body) give a damn
about us nor will the positioning/perception of "Ankit Fadia" Brand change
in Indian Media.

That is the critical difference. Everyone knows that politicians are
corrupt. But they may take
the assessment of Ankit Fadia at face value

Slightly OT

Couple of days back they published an article on "How India is going to
"topple" japan as world's 3rd largest economy"
http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-09-20/news/30180201_1_third-largest-economy-power-parity-indian-economy,
They totally missed GDP per capita
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capitawhere
we are trying to beat Iraq. GDP per capita shows the real growth and
wealth distribution!

1) I am not waging another mailing war, but making a few comments to fix
misunderstandings.
2) What I meant by my reply was that, mailing a protest mail to editor may
not help at all, Ankit Fadia has become a Brand and is supposedly supported
by Reliance[The godfather of media/political lobbying].
3) And by the phrase "do something productive" I meant to do something else
to tackle the situation, and not "minding our own work". I agree I used
words poorly.
4) What we could do is  "Be a Whistle Blower!" a)Through Blog  b)In the very
forum of India Times c) If there is a very substantial evidence that he is
totally not worth it Wikileaks is always hungry.

The Software Freedom Day 2011 Celebrations were filled with lot of fun
and enthusiasm.

We had 18 stalls as follows

.
1. Libre Office
2. Kompozer
3. FFMPEG, Audacity
4. Python
5. PHP
6. Drupal
7. Scilab
8. Subversion&GIT
9. Firefox Addons
10. Spoken-Tutorial
11. Mozilla
12. Tamil Wikipedia
13. Ruby
14. Joomla
15. Subversion Edge
16. Open Source CDs and Books
17. Ruby on Rails(RoR)
18. Educational Software

We had a lot of new volunteers for the stalls.

Though the visitors are less then any other years, the stall
volunteers shared the knowledge
to the attended visitors and other stall peers.

Spoken-Tutorial CDs for Linux/Python/Latex and stickers were
distributed to the visitors.

Yogesh explained on how to participate in a open source community to
get help and to contribute.
He emphasized the importance of doing the final year project by own
and doing it as a contribution for
any open source application.

Choosing the best stalls for prizes was so tough as everyone showed
their best enthusiasm.
Tamil Wikipedia, Ruby, Mozilla teams got the prizes.
We gave them the book "Introduction to Python"

We presented Rs 200 for all the stalls as a gift.

Will send the total accounts soon.

Thanks for all the volunteers and donors.
Thanks a lot for Mr.Vimalesh, computer Society of MIT and the team for
their endless efforts.
Thanks for MIT for hosting the event.

While that _should_ be a sound choice, I would advise you to go with
Centos 5 as of now till Centos 6.1 arrives.

Please note that RHEL 6.0 to RHEL 6.1 release time was probaby a
record in terms of release as *lot* of security and bug updates
between them.

ergo Centos which is yet to come out with 6.1.

But that is the best one around if you consider the Base on which you
are going to deploy your application. You have support of Centos till
RHEL supports it -- 7 years. I remember reading somewhere Redhat is
considering it to extend it to 10 years.

Putting on the hat of software project manager, using RHEL/centos as
your base is a no-brainer.

Don't touch (even think about) Fedora, Ubnutu etc. as a server
platform for new production apps.

Above IMHO.

As someone actively using Ubuntu servers, I would like to know your
reasoning for avoiding Ubuntu server for production.

The well known poster child for the LAMP stack - Wikipedia,
extensively runs on Ubuntu servers:

Don't waste your time. India Today isn't the kind of magazine which
contains anything of substance. The editor probably asked the writer to
give him 10 pages to fill up and the guy had to find stuff that he could
put there. 6 hours of googling later, he gets an article. That's what
happens and it isn't worth the 180 s it'll take you to compose a protest
email.

What is Ankit Fadia and India Today's opinion about him doing on a linux
mailing list that is so punctilious about off topic discussions - the OP
more so than any of the others!!!

Perhaps you can create a separate mailing list for exchanging your opinions
about Ankit Fadia :-)

I am using Fedora 64bit for a rented xeon server without any problems for
last 4 years. I haven't restarted it since I upgraded it to Fedora 14.
uptime reads

 22:00:06 up 267 days, 16:24,  1 user,  load average: 1.12, 1.26, 1.31

It is generally not recommend for production server because of frequent
releases and leading edge nature. Despite that I used it but so far I
haven't encountered any major problems. But remember I do not have to answer
to anyone if anything goes wrong. It is mainly used as web and email server.
 If stakes are high or if it is mission critical then go for RHEL/CentOS.

because I do not consider it OT - a lot of us are still confused over
the distinction between hacking and cracking, and discussions of this
type serve to make the distinction clear - of course if you contend that
hacking has nothing to do with linux, then you are right.

On a similar discussion I was having on Arnindam Chaudhari and how he
is the Ankit Fadia version of Business world .. we were like laughing
when Ankit Fadia supposedly showed how to hack 'linux' password by
chroot !!

The discussion popped up when we were discussing

Too vague a defence for transgressing a guideline you want everyone else to
follow!

Your std strategy: Indulge in sophistry in an attempt to divert attention
from a goof up.

As too many old timers are interested in this thread, I think it will go on
for some more time. After all, guidelines are there only to spook new comers
into submission.

Why do you say so? Can you please give a few pointers in support of
your statement.
We are also trying out various distros for bringing stability to our
lamp stack and Iwas pretty comfortable with Ubuntu.
Are there any known issues with running heavy applications on Ubuntu?

Oh! Its guideline following time again so soon? I thought it was still open

Anyway, henceforth I shall cloak it in nice language so it sounds like

I will just quote fragments of one of our esteemed members Shri
Senthil Nathan's response:

"If stakes are high or if it is mission critical then go for RHEL/CentOS."

Remember it takes roughly 18 months for an enterprise class
application to go online and accepted by corporate users (maybe less
in a slmaller organisations). I have deployed mission critical systems
in corporates with an _IT Department_ filled with PHB's who wants to
push their responsibility to vendors. In which case, It makes sense to
go with development using Centos which can then be cnverted into
RHEL/Oracle Linux of they want to buy 24/7 support from another
corporate.

Education sector is _not_  mission critical (spare the whining of
faculties who love to reboot frequently and who assume God roles and
mostly without any industry exposure whatsoever). I have managed a
three node RHCS cluster in vnbrims.org, an Institute for MMS(MBA) for
about 2 and 1/2 years.

Ubuntu/Mint for desktops: OK.

But for servers (especially located in remote data centers):
RHEL/Centos if you wand peace of mind and do not want to jump though
the hoops and loops of upgrade every now and then.

Your are free to make your choice.

Of course above IMHO, YMMV, E&OE etc. applies.

Ubuntu is backed by Canonical and they do offer commercial support services.
If this is what your PHBs need, it's already available for Ubuntu.

If you need stable releases, you should really be using the LTS (long
term support) versions.
The LTS Server versions are also supported for 5 years and is actually
enterprise focused.

7 years is the standard.  10 years is extended support with important
security fixes.  Customers can and do opt in extend that even further in
some circumstances.   RHEL support for any given release should be the
longest in the Linux world.

 I can see that that Shri Rahul Sundaram has aptly answered to this query.

Redhat has committed itself to Open source and continues to be so.

Disclaimer: I have never had ay employment opportunity at Redhat. I am
speaking from my experience. I had attended to three calls from Novell
Netware 3.12 to Netware 4.1 in last week alone as a freeelancer. FYKI.
Novell has been taken over by another company recently (I don't
remember the name).

The point is, a production environment runs long after its deployment.
I know of clipper and foxpro production systems running to date (and
fate) to this day.

If this is ignored, peril of support (paid or unpaid) remains a PIA.

Ubuntu LTS v/s Redhat = 5 v/s 7 (now 10) years.

Do your maths and decide.

Above IMHO, of course.

If the 10-year support cycle interests you, RHEL is not the lone
provider; SUSE Linux Enterprise also provides a comparable 10-year
support life-cycle.

The original poster was referring to the LAMP stack.

I can understand organizations holding on to their old proprietary
solutions for ages (like IE6 and Active-X based Intranet apps).
I can even understand people not upgrading their email servers as
SMTP, POP or IMAP may not see radical changes.

But why should the dynamically changing  nature of *Open* Web
technologies be limited by stale deployments?
I for one, would really not want to limit myself to an age old MySQL
server, when a newer release would greatly enhance the scalability of
my web application. Nor would I want to miss a significant upgrade to
PHP features in the name of maintaining stability. Just compare how
the web was 5 years ago and how much it has evolved now.

If the enterprise wants a 10-year locked-down deployment even for an
Open Web Apps stack, that makes me really sad.
I was under the impression that only proprietary, commercial products
lock down their customers and make upgrades a costly affair.

I don't why you were in that impression that only proprietary
applications needed a standardized deployment.  The goal of sticking to
a single release is essentially because it is a known quantity and that
is very important when you have hundreds or thousands of systems or even
a few critical ones.  Custom in house applications are often written in
enterprises and upgrading can break them in non obvious ways.  Unless
the new release offers something that is compelling enough to think
about, mere inertia is enough to not change anything.

Hi guys;
 A problem cropping up intermittently which I have not been able to
find a solution to. I have a PIII with an Intel board, shifetd to Deb
Lenny with LXDE to ensure low processr load. Work mostly on command
line. RAM maxed at 521 MB. Created swap space.
 Monitor at 1024x768 AOC widescreen. The sytem crashes when watching
movies, X becomes speckled and the keyboard and mouse stop responding.
Tried a vendor who stated my on board Intel Graphics processor is
faulty; removed it; problem persists. System and kernel log reveal gap
for the period.
 Top indicates greater usage of RAM with time, some load shifted to
swap. Some daigonistic hints
(a) BIOS beeps thrice on start-Indicates a RAM initial memory fault,
tested RAM/ changed RAM seems OK.
(b) Serial presence not detected as indicated in start-up.
(c) Deleting orphan i-node indiacted in demesg.
Any hints? Dont go, dump the kit, works well, why kill it and add to
junk; am sure there is a workaround.
  Thanks
   Regards
    Podi

Hi All,

Thanks for all of our techies reply.
My Query is FYI only :


we have  to setup LAMP server for this how do we make it as fast and
reliable.
which distro is good to setup LAMP.
My suggestion  is Cent OS 6.

OS preference is :
Cent OS and Debian.
i am also interested to know about Ubuntu - why and why not.

for a good LAMP server you would certainly need python 2.7 and
postgresql 9.x - I doubt whether that OS would provide this.

As a general practice, upgrades (even .xy releases) need to be
validated - be it FOSS or proprietary.  Validation costs money.

For multimedia, 512MB RAM does not cut it any more on the desktop
(IMO).  Try increasing it to 1GB.

When the system freezes, the kernel freezes too - no syslog.

Are you still getting the beeps or that has been resolved with new RAM?

You mean the serial port?  If yes, your mobo is on respirator, time to
upgrade hardware

file system problem.  Use systemrescuecd (if possible) and fsck *all*
your file systems.

OK, but stopping the ageing process (besides cosmetic appearances)
still eludes us.   An hold horse can pull the tonga but perhaps not as
fast as you would like it to.  :)

I have found the Intel Atom boards (1GB RAM) OK for basic multimedia.
In fact, I put together a HTPC and the audience is quite happy with
the audio/video from a projector (1024x768) and on the LCD TV
(1366x768).  Next I plan to switch to the AMD APU based boards with
the E-350 APU (see my earlier post).

IMO, This will mostly affect laptops since its not easy to build one and 
its tied to a vendor. As far as desktop are concerned, I am sure mobo 
manufacturers will be sensible enough to sign the linux bootloaders or 
provide an option to boot even if it is not signed.

Worst comes to worst, it shouldn't be too difficult to patch the UEFI 
firmware or replace it with an open source firmware. IMHO, This is a 
monetization strategy which will introduce new trusted CAs, who can make 
even more money.

This introduces another option that a newbie will have to change. Which, of
course, will be named *disable secure boot*. (OMG-Ubuntu rightly summarised
newbie's reaction thus: "You want me to disable a _security feature_ so I
can boot into this Linux thing?")

Ah, another barrier to Newbie. This seems to be an idea to increase the
height of Windows-Linux jump barrier, without appearing to be fully blocking
it.

I appreciate your response to my opinions but they were mere opinions on 
the article.

It will help if we can keep the thread in the context of the article 
instead of focusing on someone's opinions.

What makes you think that whatever I said did not match the context of this
thread or article OP linked to(which is in fact a pointer -aka slashdotting
- to three other articles)?

Quoting from one of the linked articles "While it would be possible for
various distributions to get their keys added, that wouldn't help anyone who
wanted to run a tweaked version of the "approved" bootloader or kernel.", is
exactly what I said.

Personal attacks are frowned upon here, but ideas written in this list can
and *will* be refuted. Do not take it personally. If you cannot do that then
mailing list culture may not be for you. :)

$ lspci -v

redirect the output to some file and search for the string "VGA".

Do not top post. If this is the only VGA entry you have got, then I'm afraid
you do *not* have a separate graphics card. This entry is for integrated
controller.

So far, enterprise was forced to upgrade their applications when they
replace their aging hardware and the new hardware setup is not
compatible with their old Apps. With Virtualization helping them, they
can indefinitely postpone upgrades by maintaining the old setup even
in new hardware.
With this kind of inertia, even a 10 year support-cycle will not be
enough for them. So why eliminate Ubuntu based on this criteria?

I am not denying that. When designing apps around an open platform, I
expect costs be less than intimidating to comfortably go for
periodical planned  upgrades.

My only contention is that a *Web application stack* -- of all things
-- should be on a shorter upgrade cycle. 10 years is a ridiculously
long time by Internet standards. This is especially true for
customer-facing applications like an eCommerce portal. Yes, it would
be highly risky to make unstable upgrades to an eCommerce portal as
any Failure due to it has direct financial consequences. However, if
you shy away from even making significant upgrades in reasonable time
periods, your App will be a dinosaur caught in a time warp.

Until like 4 years ago, cloud strategy was largely unheard of, and
many enterprise Web Apps had a not-so-great design for scalability
with either a huge wastage of computing resources or an abysmal
resource pooling. But now, significant cost savings can be achieved
with a well designed cloud strategy (Disclaimer: I am not pretending
to be a expert on cloud computing -- merely stating the obvious). If
your eCommerce portal had no architectural redesign for the last 5
years and will continue to be so for the next 5 years, your are pretty
much limiting the number of customers you can do business with. It
would be unwise not to expect a better architecture to surface in much
less than a decade from now and resisting the change at that point,
will actually be a financial drain.

Do not hijack threads. Start a separate thread for your question. This

Have you talked to any organization having a large deployment on Linux? 
I encourage you to do that before making assumptions around this topic. 
A open web platform does mean costs are going to be less but doesn't
mean stability concerns are going to just evaporate.  In fact, the point
of enterprise releases in part is because large deployments don't
necessarily want to follow the break neck pace of changes in the open
source world.    Virtualization makes some changes possible in terms of
being not tied to a particular hardware but there are a very large
number which don't trust virtualization enough with anything critical at
this point.   If you have custom applications around a platform,  change
is hard regardless of whether the underlying stack is open or not.   Try
migrating a custom PHP (4.x to 5.x)  or Python (2.3 to 2.7) or MySQL
(3.x to 4.x) and you will see how costly it can be.    Heck,  forget
enterprises.  Even hosting providers have problems of this sort.

There are good repositories that provide parallel installable version of
such packages.  EPEL from Fedora,  IUS community from Rackspace are
popular sources but there are several others.

Hi Everyone,
we had a great monthly meet this time. There were around 11
participants.

== Lightning Talks

After a quick self introduction, we started off with Abdul's talk on
Visual Python. He first gave a short intro to Visual Python, and then
demonstrated a solar system simulation he had written. Then Vijay gave
a talk on Python's advanced string formatting. He discussed the
rationale behind the deprecation of the % operator for string
formatting, and how the new format() method overcomes the limitations
of the % operator.

It was Roshan's turn next. He was supposed to give talk on the 'with'
statement. But since people were not very familiar with exceptions, he
gave a introduction to exceptions and exception handling. Roshan then
explained the 'with' statement with the standard file example.

The next talk was on the pyserial module. Rengarajan gave an
introduction to the pyserial module, using a GSM modem as an example.
He then used the pyserial module to send an SMS using the GSM modem.

== Video

We played "The Mighty Dictionary" talk by Brandon Craig
Rhodes. Brandon supplemented his talk with excellent slides, and clear
illustrations. At the end of video, people raised a couple of
questions, and we helped each other get things clarified.

Hope we will continue the good work, next time around as well.

Regards,
Vijay

It is OT but I am sure this would be covered in a basic Netware System
Administrator guide. Proper nouns start with a capital letter; it is
Novell and Netware.

Searching for "netware system administrator" I got several links that
might be relevant to your question.  It is not too difficult to search
and find the answers for yourself.

My external graphics shows it's "on board" VRAM (256 MB) during system
boot up *before* the BIOS screen.  It flashes by quite fast.  Your VGA
card might display something similar.

Copy and be happy!!! :-)

and Oh!, do not expect all the rights to be copied along under Linux

rpomforge, repoforge etc.

While asserting and respecting and +1 to Rahul's response, adding
these repositories breaks support from Redhat.

Dear respected Rahul, correct me if I am wrong. You are the Redhat man

It doesn't break any support.  You can't ask Red Hat to support packages
it does not provide or if you modify packages and that causes issues and
Red Hat might ask you to remove a package just to confirm that it isn't
causing the problem in question in some circumstances but merely
installing extra packages is of no problem.   Red Hat does provide the
infrastructure and free Red Hat subscriptions to EPEL repository
(https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) community developers in fact

Dear Friends,

On Gandhi Jayanthi, can we do our bit to change the world? Even as a
technological revolution sweeps the world, there are many who do not
have access to computing. Should we allow this digital untouchability to
prevail in this century?

We invite you to a discussion on 2nd October 2011 at 10:00 AM, IIT
Madras regarding a Community Computing Center (CCC).

CCC aims at taking the technology to the underprivileged thereby
empowering them for a better tomorrow. Your time or/and donation is
important for us to make this dream a success.

Fair enough, but I am not a person they would/could share details with.
If someone could provide the data, that will be helpful.

I've explained it before. I am not asking you to upgrade your setup
whenever, say, PHP had a new point release. I am asking you to upgrade
when a major shift happens - Example: OOP concepts in PHP 4 vs PHP 5 -
when that shift is a significant improvement and makes the
development/maintenance cycle less painful, if not super easy. I don't
expect you to make the shift overnight but you should at least start
thinking about it sooner than later.

I've done migrations from PHP4 code to PHP5 myself - painful indeed -
not in coding it in PHP5 but in grasping what the original PHP4 code
does with  insufficient documentation written years ago, by someone I
cannot contact now because he has already left for another company, in
another country. However, the sooner it's done the better, because
otherwise, as bugs/adjustments start to creep in, developers add patch
after patch in PHP4 style code - more trouble to deal with and a
nightmare for maintenance. If you are worried about the migration
costs now, you better be prepared for the costs 10 years later. At
that time, there will very few developers who can deal with PHP4 style
code and be nice with their charges. You could throw out everything
and start from scratch but that again will be expensive in its own
way.

> ?Heck, ?forget enterprises. ?Even hosting providers have problems of this sort.

Does having problems stop them from providing a new version? After all
if they don't, they would lose prospective customers to competitors.

Hello Ramkumar,

Someone (is that you?) asked this on Slashdot by a timely coincidence :

http://linux.slashdot.org/story/11/09/25/1211203/newb-friendly-linux-flavor-for-lamp-server

Unless you have talked to *anyone* handling a large deployment,  all you
can do is speculate about their needs which isn't useful.  Not many
people will explain the specifics for you in a public mailing list. 
Deployment use cases and requirements are often treated as confidential.

This is precisely what a release supported for a long time with a
conservative update cycle lets you do.  Upgrade on your convenience. 
Virtualization, cloud computing etc can be useful but enterprises are
conservative by nature typically and not necessarily interesting in
trying out something new to solve their old problems,  be it a new
version of a software or a entirely different technology.    Some of
them are leaders and invest heavily in technology but this is probably
less than 10%. 

"Does having problems stop them from providing a new version?"

Not necessarily but it isn't a trivial problem to solve.  Look how long it takes for people to move over to PHP 5.   This means, supporting releases of PHP for your customers.  Add to that, rest of the stack and combinations thereof and you begin to understand the complexity.  Often,  FOSS software don't care much if at all about backward compatibility or ABI stability with very few exceptions.  This is part of the problem that leads to a demand for a single release to be supported for a long time.

Hi all,

While a more formal announcement will come shortly after finalizing
logistics, this is a early heads up for people who want to block calendars /
tickets. Mediawiki & Wikipedia hackathon[1] is being planned[2] on November
19,20 at Mumbai as a parallel event to the WikiConference India[3] . If you
are a PHP developer interested in contributing, there will be "Introductory
mediawiki sessions", bug triages. Even if you aren't into PHP, there is much
more you could learn / contribute on many other technologies behind
Wikimedia properties along with WMF(Mediawiki) developers who will be
attending the hackathon.

[OT] The *WikiConference India 2011* is the first conference of its kind
being held in India and is intended to become an annual national flagship
event for Wikipedia/Wikimedia in the country. It is meant to provide a
common platform for all Indian Wikimedians to meet and share their views,
discuss challenges and exchange useful tips, best practices and other
information.

There are also some technical talks[4] being planned at Conference too.
Conference requires a paid registration which is open[5], while hackathon
will be free event needing registrations which needs be confirmed and will
open up soon.

Check your BIOS settings, it might only be allowing you to select one
of the 2 graphics cards. So, your PCI-E/AGP(not sure if they still
exist) card might not be visible to your OS.

Yeah, since when did the Enterprise looked to public mailing lists for
answers and shared plans of their deployments? Glad, you put the
public mailing list in its place. Yet, when the OP was looking for a
LAMP setup, it was immediately assumed he is an Enterprise guy and
there was a completely unjustified suggestion "Don't touch (even think
about) Fedora, Ubnutu etc. as a server platform for new production
apps". How is this useful?

Make no mistake, I have nothing against RHEL/CentOS but you cannot
trivialize another distro like Ubuntu just like that, or argue that a
completely arbitrary N-years support cycle is the clincher without
considering the specific internals of the organization itself. If
tomorrow, RHEL or Ubuntu provided 20 years extended support for every
release, will it be any more useful?

Anyways, as I previously mentioned, Wikipedia effectively migrated to
Ubuntu LTS Servers.
http://www.ubuntu.com/products/casestudies/wikimedia

Wikipedia is one of the high traffic sites on the Internet, run on a
meager budget. Even with mind-blowing stats like 50,000 http
requests/second and 80,000 SQL queries/second and millions of
visitors, the entire setup of Wikimedia's 300+ servers is very much
stable:

People working with FLOSS tend to develop a tendency to help others.

They, especially after facing audits from Proprietary Software
vendors, do not like to be "TOLD".

They have a tendency to swim and help others swim in the ocean.

Your "Not understanding" is your issue.

Dear Sir,

as usual, you are again to pointing things, instead of just answering
him. I know that you are can do it - with your experience.

looking at his writing - it seems he is not the type who does english
/ typing well.  You could have answered it - instead of asking
questions.

are you asking him to learn english / typing before asking you.

(I do not know the answers for the questions he had asked - I am only
a good user of Ubuntu - not a coder, or a knowledgable person to guide
him - otherwise I would have answered)

thanks.

with warm regards

kindly refrain from preaching - if a person wants help he should take
the trouble to

1. check his spelling (how will he log into his gmail account if he
spells it 'gamil'?)

2. show what steps he has taken.

       Please try to understand what working as a group means.
Rules/guidelines exist to make the list a better place for everyone.
It really is a little arrogant if you really mean "If it affronts the
list so be it" statement that you made. Please learn to work as a
team. Thanks

I personally will suggest to try wine(install inside windows) to check
whether it is okay for you or not. But that doesn't matter now.

I am not sure about windows as I got away from windows few years back, but I
think you can look at msconfig. open run(windows button + r) and type
msconfig

I think that option will be there and you can uncheck that option. Also,
Kindly avoid SMS type of words.

Some actually do especially if they are educational institutions or
non-profits looking for help with infrastructure.  I have gotten
involved in the past with some efforts like that. It depends on the
enterprise in question.

Yet, when the OP was looking for a

I don't think this question is directed at me since I did no such thing.
 You asked why does a LAMP stack deployment needs a longer lifecycle and
I explained some of the reason why that might be the case.   I
personally have no real use for a distro with a longer update cycle and
I use Fedora full time and contribute to it.  I don't make the mistake
of assuming such that this is suitable for everyone and understand that
there are people who do depend on a distro release supported for a
longer time.

Yep.  It would be more useful for certain set of customers and some are
willing to pay a lot more money for such a service and get a custom
update subscription.

Hi,

  I used Brasero software for writting the DVD & CD and failed two times,
wasting the DVD. There is no problem with the writter and the content i
tried to write because i was able to write the same in windows with Nero.
Please suggest a software similar to Nero.

Hi,

     Give gnome-baker and k3b a try... although k3b might pull in a
lot of kde libs, it is fairly powerful... Also, if you're adventurous,
you can try woodim, cdrdao, mkisofs, etc,.

Kindly look at MSRTC, the second largest State Transportation
organisation, which uses only Centos, or BEST in Mumbai which
replicated it's model.

They are surely informed. and they save taxpayer's money.

In a mission critical environment you are out of job if you make a mistake.

If you are a grocery vendor or a private4 medical practitioner etc. it
is a different issue.

BTW, For medical usage consider Openvista or something equivalent.

You may have to traverse pre-Fortran years to deal with GT.M database.

Indeed, very much but the "if" is in your question.

AHA. "LTS" Now what does that LTS mean?

Please heed to professionals who have risked their careers on RHEL/CentOS.

You have the freedom to choose bleeding edge or stability.

Freedom is about choice. Look at the TN's neighboring state Kerala.
They have entirely shifted to foss.Come out of your well.

Check ou the linux-cluster and Cetnos general (centos at centos.org) list
(in gmane.org) and find out.

There are some people who manage 1000's of servers.

Use proper subject that describes your problem for people to notice.
Such hijacking someone else mails is not ethical and is against this
mailing list guidelines. Read the mailing list guidelines found at
http://www.ilugc.in/content/mailinglist-guidelines . regarding your
problem , installing grub should help. But your mail does not enough
problem description. Like what you did that created this. Like did you
try installing windows after ubuntu installation ? Did you run fixmbr
from recovery consle or soemthign like that. or did you change the
default boot OS in grub.conf in ubuntu or did you set a low timeout
value in grub.conf or what you did before you get this error or what
exaclty are you seeing on the screen with thsi condtion. Do you get to
see booting in 5 secs or something like that ? Now if you want to
reply to this mail , change the subject appropriately and then reply.

PersonaIly  i dont like fancy GUI stuff. Command line tools like
cdrecord and mkisofs have never failed me. If you still insist on GUI
then i suggest k3b. It is a long timer and has not failed me even when
other similar GUI tools have failed like Xcdroast (i think now it is

let forget about the machine being Linux and let me know if such a
software which detects non hot pluggable hardware changes exists
either in windows or mac or Linux or any where. I think these kind of
things are part of firmware released by the hardware maker. I remember
blade servers having management console which if properly configured
can alert the ops guy with email about a failure or something. But it
is still a firmware and not a application on top of OS but produced by
server maker. So if you want such functionality get a hardware that
has these or write your own firmware or if you could find one such
thing post back to this list , I am very much interested. My guess is
such thing does not exists unless supported by your motherboard .

I am not aware of any such package. Debian has hwinfo package which gives extensive information about hardware. Possible way to solve your problem

1.Install hwinfo
2.Run hwinfo at boot time - save the output
3.Create a git repo and commit this
4.Write a startup script which will run every subsequent boot to create hwinfo output and commit the changes with some automatic header something like 'hwinfo as on xxxx date'

5.use git log to know the changes

Search for a "hardware inventory" or "IT asset management"
application. ?There are plenty to choose from.  Here's one

hi,

I had set up postfix on fedora 15, one problem:

telnet localhost 25 works

but

telnet 192.168.1.2 25 does not work
but dovecot responds to: telnet 192.168.1.2 110

any clues?

selinux is disabled, and the problem persists even if the firewall is

In general, listening only on localhost is done for security reasons. It 
looks like sendmail binds only to 127.0.0.1:25

$ sudo lsof -i :25 -n
COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
sendmail 5333 root    4u  IPv4 654974      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:smtp (LISTEN)

sendmail or the application that is using port 25 in your case might 
have the option to specify the ip address for listening.

Kenneth,

I have been using Postfix for a while now.

And I have never run into this issue.

Postfix may take time to respond.

What does 'does not work' mean?

Connection refused or hang?

Both are different.

Connection refused means that Postfix is not listening(TCP RST) and
 hang means that it is slow.

Localhost is an alias for 127.0.0.1.

Try editing /etc/postfix/main.cf and look at the mynetworks parameter.

Try adding 192.168.0.0/16 to it.

Dovecot has nothing to do with postfix. It is used for IMAP and POP3 whereas
 Postfix is SMTP server(MTA).

instead of just url and no explantion on it and the only explanation
on it is a small subject title, can you post a couple of lines on what
it is about. I think short one line sentence could be ambiguous and
could be misleading. So qoute a couple of line from link as a caption
for what to expect out of the link would be good.

Postfix is not listening on 192.168.1.2 as per this output. It is
listening only to 127.0.0.1.

Can you try putting in the specific IP in main.cf to listen to instead
of inet_interfaces=all?

Till netstat/nmap show Postfix listening to 192.168.1.2, the telnet to
port 25 on that IP will not work.

Hi

Some faint traces of memory about some file other than  'main.cf' and
'master.cf', where one needs to uncomment '0.0.0.0' (or comment
perhaps).

This is roughly what I use(at office, so a few things modified) in main.cf:

myhostname = bala-linux
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
myorigin = /etc/mailname
mydestination = bala-linux.abc.def, , localhost
relayhost = [xyz.abc.def]
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128
mailbox_command = procmail -a "$EXTENSION"
mailbox_size_limit = 0
recipient_delimiter = +
inet_interfaces = all

netstat shows this:
bala at bala-linux:~$ netstat -anp | grep :25
(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
 will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:25              0.0.0.0:*
LISTEN      -
bala at bala-linux:~$

Check if there are any iptables rules rejecting connections to port 25.

Also, what distro are you using?

Could you check if master.cf has loopback-only as binding for
listening? That overrides main.cf.

You may've been trying with a reload option post changing config.
Reload does not load new config. Only restart does. Please check this
apart from the other pointers.

        Also, please see if you have something like this in master:
smtp      inet  n       -       -       -       -       smtpd

If yes, can you please uncomment it if it is commented ? Thanks

My understanding - master.cf is meant to be parameters to start the
daemons. Does not seem like a good idea to give configuration in there
that overrides main.cf. Better to have all configuration data in
main.cf.

I don't have any experience with postfix but looking at their 
documentation, here is what I would try.

1. In main.cf, set "inet_interfaces = 192.168.1.2, 127.0.0.1"
2. sudo postfix stop
3. sudo postfix -vvv start     #-vvv enables verbose mode.
4. sudo lsof -i :25 -n         #check whether it listens on 192.168.1.2
4. ifconfig | grep 192.168.1.2 #check whether the interface is up
5. check /var/log/maillog      #check for clues to listening on 25

The default file for mail.* syslog messages is usually /var/log/maillog 
but you should check your config ie., /etc/syslog.conf or 
/etc/rsyslog.conf or something similar for "mail.*" line.

If you couldn't get it to work, it will help if you share the postfix 
debug log messages from /var/log/maillog and /var/log/messages (if any).

Does your setup allow relaying?

Better yet post the output of the following:

egrep "^[a-z].*"  /etc/postfix/main.cf   (or whatever is the path name
for your setup)

I think, this could be the problem, you should comment/remove the second 
line. But the fact that this is a grep output indicates that this 
duplicate line might not be as obvious as it seems in the configuration 
file.

Please comment this  line. The last declarative is what takes effect.
inet-Interfaces is always set to localhost thus.

Subject: [Ilugc] CLI utility to determine duration of Audio/Video files
	(MythTV)
Message-ID: <CAHhM8gBMdUrCnpQy6MLsCLderjTx+VxtcorX_uNesvjHKCao2A@mail.gmail.com>

$ file 1000_20110929140000.nuv  gives me some basic info about the
.nuv file as shown below:

1000_20110929140000.nuv: MythTV NuppelVideo v0.07
(288x360),progressive,aspect:1.33,fps:25.00

I am looking for a CLI command that displays the "total" display time
for each .nuv file.  I have looked through the mythtv utilities; did
not find this functionality on a cursory look at them.

Please share if you know of any tool that is capable of giving such
information for Audio/Video files.

TIA

Subject: [Ilugc] Hackathon by Thamizha and ILUGC
Message-ID: <CACbtZwRwaNOMzRiaNA4Tv+g7UrQqNMg4fWw92RT+s1nKCNwqdQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

The Thamizha (www.thamizha.com) community is a developer community dedicated
in creating Open Source software for Tamil users. As a part of the community
efforts, a Hackathon is going to be conducted in Brisbane, Australia on
October 9th.

As  a parallel effort, we will have a hackathon in Chennai jointly organised
by ILUGC and Thamizha Community. This is a opportunity for programming
enthusiasts to get together and contribute code for the benefit of
community. I on behalf of the community kindly invite every
one interested for the hackathon.

We will be primarily dealing with creating better tools for Tamil Language
input, Spell checking, Dictionary ...etc in the form of desktop
applications, Browser addons or Mobile Apps. Any Innovative new ideas are
also welcome (creating a web service like peyar.in or translating a
opensource software like GIMP anyone ?). The technologies that would be
touched upon but not limited to are HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Python, Qt,
Android or iOS App development.

Since the technology used can be easily adopted for other Indic languages,
the people interested in working other languages on the similar lines are
also welcome.

The Venue has been generously offered by Mr. Asokan, an ILUGC Member.

The Venue Details and How to reach?:

Date:
9th October 2011

Time:
9AM to 5PM

Venue:
TalentSprint
66, Gaudia Mutt Road
Royappettah

On Radhakrishnan Salai, turn left at the Music Academy.
After about 200 m there is a crossing -- the junction of LLoyds Road and TTK
Road.
After the junction TTK Road becomes Gaudia Mutt Road. Continue down and on
the left
TalentSprint is there.

If you reach Ponnuswamy Hotel you have gone too far. :-)

Multiple inet_interfaces declarations could be the problem.  Remove
the 2nd instance which may overriding the first one forcing postfix to
listen on 127.0.0.1

You can use ffmpeg.
*ffmpeg -i filename *

Please do check if the version of ffmpeg supports nuv ( Nuppel Video). Mine
did:
The command is

*ffmpeg -formats | grep nuv*

You can also verify the "final" content of  inet_interfaces by

# postconf | egrep inet_interfaces

Hi guys;
 The reply from Arun Khan was indeed of use. The issue is yet to be
solved and seems to be a hardware problem of sorts. Guess, as Arun
suggests time for an upgrade! I understand Linux is notorious for
compatability with hardware, could anyone suggest suitable harware for
Debian; a distro known for its range of applications; not too high end
say Intel core 2 duo equvalent.
 I would not want to buy a bunch of hardware and then struggle optimising it.
   Cheers
     Podi
By the by the Intel Sandybridge graphics does not do too well I read.

Great :)

Postfix must have been logging failed connections.

Look through the postfix logs in /var/log directory and let us know
what was specifically logged.

actually my mistake was in not following rule no 1 in posting in a
mailing list:

'post code to show what you have tried' - if I had done that a lot of
time and energy would have been saved.

Dear Jeyanthan,

Thank you for signing up for the online Introduction to Databases class.

We are now open for enrollment at http://www.db-class.org/. Once you
register, you will also have access to some initial content -- you can even
get a head start on the lectures and assignments.

Feel free to forward this email to your friends who might be interested in
databases. If you have friends also taking the class, we strongly encourage
you to form a study group to discuss the material and help each other with
the technical content, and perhaps even to get together at a regular time to
watch the videos together. Having a study group can make learning this
material easier and more fun!

Please go to http://www.db-class.org/ to enroll. We look forward to helping
you become an expert in databases!

It is actually the hardware vendors who are notorious - they don't
provide drivers.   Those who do, especially open source, their h/w
works as good under Linux vis-a-vis other prop. OSs.

For my personal purchases, I buy h/w that has been about 6 months in
the market.  They cost  less compared to the latest and greatest in
in the market.  Chances are pretty good, that all devices will work
out of the box with the latest versions of any Distro on h/w that has
been in the market for about 6 months.

Not sure if this has been mentioned before, but there is also:

ai-class.com and www.ml-class.com

and then on reddit.com you can find /r/aiclass, /r/mlclass and /r/dbclass

Anyone taking these courses?

Thanks.  ffmpeg in Debian/Squeeze does have NUV support.

It gives me the following on my .nuv file (relevant portions pasted here)

[nuv @ 0x1dd27a0] Estimating duration from bitrate, this may be inaccurate

Seems stream 0 codec frame rate differs from container frame rate:
1000.00 (1000/1) -> 25.00 (25/1)
Input #0, nuv, from '1000_20110920200000.nuv':
  Duration: 00:17:02.86, start: 0.016000, bitrate: 1411 kb/s

However, when I play the same file in VLC, it reports 59:57.

Hi,
                   I got the following error message while compiling
"transmission-remote-gtk" in Fedora 15, I got code from
http://code.google.com/p/transmission-remote-gtk/ .

configure: error: Package requirements (json-glib-1.0 >= 0.8) were not met:

No package 'json-glib-1.0' found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables jsonglib_CFLAGS
and jsonglib_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

I got version 0.12.0, How to overcome this error, Thank you.

With Regards,
Kavin S.A.G

If you want alternatives,  there is already quite a few.  MariaDB,
Drizzle are MySQL based.  PostgreSQL is a mature alternative as well.
In some cases,  the nosql databases such as couchdb and mongodb can be a
good option too.  There is no shortage of choices however MySQL as a
brand has a lot of name recognition and Oracle's move is essentially to
monetize it more by making the db semi proprietary.  This isn't
surprising considering the history of MySQL which has dabbled with
proprietary extensions for a long time now.

My suggestion:  Use Postgres.

https://code.google.com/p/transmission-remote-gtk/downloads/list has a
SRPM.  You can download and build a RPM using rpmbuild.  I could get
into the Fedora repo if you actually use it and find it useful.  I
maintain Transmission and transmission-remote-cli in Fedora anyway.

Dear Arun;
 The inputs I have from  the net suggest that vendors do not release
Linux drivers; the open community does not have the resources to write
them. Does this mean with the new range of hardware will force a
re-look at the way open source addresses these issues?
 I woudld be grateful for a suggested hardware composition. I concur
with your last paragraph! By the by the latest HP suggests touchscreen
is the way to go for a Desktop. Interesting!!

Or they don't release their hardware specifications because they may
not comply to the standards, or they may have done some work arounds
which they don't wish to reveal to their end users.

The changes to the device tree can be monitored using udevadm. The

Oh, and by the way it's really bad now.  We are losing ~50%!!!  Would
you believe it?  A power regression so bad that Portable Linux users
running Kernel 3.0.x are losing over 50% of our battery life!

Uhh, no, we aren't.

There is no such thing as this power "regression" in the kernel.
There was a patch to a bug found by RedHat related to how the kernel
enables ASPM.  The bug caused a group of computers effected to crash
when the BIOS reported that ASPM wasn't supported, but ASPM was
enabled in hardware (RHEL-681017).  The fix was too instruct ASPM to
go to an off state if the BIOS reported it wasn't supported rather
than leaving it default.  This fixed the instability issue causing
systems to crash.

More information on the subject:

HOWEVER, forcing ASPM to turn off on systems that report that it is
unsupported caused a slight loss in power savings.  It was a sacrifice
necessary to prevent systems from crashing.

IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

IT IS NOT A REGRESSION.

One reason that is is not a regression is that the kernel's exposed
tuneable parameters for power management are not dynamic.  This means
that when you boot up either with a power cord connected or on battery
your kernel boots into the same state.

The kernel by default is optimized for performance, and not power savings.

An example of this would be dirty_writeback_centisecs. This parameter
specifies the time in 100ths of a second where pdflush wakes up and
writes cached data out to disk.  By default it is set to 500 which is
optimal for performance but sub optimal for battery life.  A much more
sane value when on battery is 1500.  Unfortunately, the parameter does
not change "automatically" when you unplug.

Other examples would be parameters like nmi_watchdog,
sched_smt_power_savings, and snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save.

This is where a tool like Jupiter or tuned comes in, these tools are
designed to alter the state of the kernel to optimize the system for
performance when plugged in, and battery life when unplugged.  In the
case of Jupiter, not only do I change multiple kernel parameters, but
I also change the power state of (supported) devices to shift them to
power savings mode.

I tried to explain to Michael why he was wrong, but Michael Larabel
ignores reason choosing instead to continue to poison Linux users into
believing the sky is falling when it isn't.

For those that do see a small loss in battery life and are willing to
risk stability for a few extra minutes unplugged, there is a
workaround.

Set 'pcie_aspm=force' on the kernel command line of grub.conf, reboot,
and move on with life.

To see if you have a bad BIOS, look at
/sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy.  If it says 'default', you
probably unfortunately have a computer that is reporting that ASPM is
unsupported.

If you have a laptop or netbook, and you want optimal battery life,
install Jupiter or tuned and get on with your life.

The remaining complaints Michael blindly points at the kernel are most
likely configuration problems in the Ubuntu distribution itself (Unity
or other application maybe), in the Xorg video driver stack shipping
with Ubuntu, or operator error.

No offense to Ubuntu intended, it just honestly isn't well optimized
for portable computers.  Even the older netbook remixes were just a
different GUI bolted onto a default install.  I should know, I spent a
lot of my personal time optimizing it for Eee PCs which eventually led
to my being invited to join the Eeebuntu project (now called Aurora).

If you are looking at powertop and you are seeing crazy wakeups, look
at what you have running and what you are doing.

If you see things like applications (Chromium, Firefox, Thunderbird,
Terminals, shell scripts, etc), congrats - you are doing it wrong.

Thanks to the Ubuntu Forums member that pointed out bug #760131 the
bug report is a fine example of doing it wrong.  I stopped counting at
347 process or device interrupts.  It's a busy system, busy systems
don't have IDLE CPUs.  Not a bug!

Every process, keystroke, mouse movement, etc causes a wakeup, some
cause tens or hundreds of wakeups per second.  If you want to test for
wakeups, you need to close EVERYTHING except the base desktop (clean
boot recommended), open a terminal, unplug, and start powertop as
root.

Now .. walk away for ~15 minutes.

Still seeing crazy wakeups?  Probably not.

Michael Larabel would be far more helpful to the community if he would
learn how to properly identify and test for these sorts of problems
and report them through the proper channels.  He is more interested
though in driving clicks to his website, and the best way to do that
is through fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

If he cared about the community, you would see his participation about
his fabled ASPM "regression" on the Linux Kernel Mailing List.  If he
were to post about the myth he created there though, he would probably
be eaten alive .. and deservedly s
