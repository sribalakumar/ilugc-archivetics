Message-ID: <CAOdw4WuCvGwDeoM9gHS0BQwBSZMaCZ=hVSDu0Lt-K9R7quJaCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

    Am writing on behalf of Ekam Foundation (http://www.ekamoneness.org/) -
and NGO who work for the healthcare of underprivileged children.

    Ekam needs help in the following forms and I thought we can make a
difference to them by pooling some of our resources/skills. Of course, as
always, I have tons of data and have first hand seen their work, and would
be happy to share them with you before you may decide on how to help.

1. Champions for fund-raising - We need to create a network of
micro-donations on a monthly basis, that will help Ekam sustain their good
work
2. SEO/SEM - Need to create a sustained marketing effort and social
presence so that we can project the successes and needs of Ekam.

    A first hand look at the work done will definitely convince you of the
need. YOU can make a difference to the society by being part of this effort.

Do let me know if I can arrange for you to see the work before signing up
as a volunteer/champion.

Regards,

Sriram Karra
Sr. Product Manager, Interviewstreet

=======

*About Interviewstreet*

We are on a mission to connect great talent with great opportunities (in
the form of contests, jobs, automated tests, etc.) in the fastest, most
efficient and the most fun way. We have been at it for 3 years and our
customers love us; but the journey has just begun.


We have one Enterprise product (Recruit) and one consumer product
(HackerRank). Recruit helps companies more effectively screen programmers
by using our cloud based platform for evaluating their programming chops.
HackerRank is aimed at building communities of programmers who are
interested in different domains of CS and who hangout out on our site
solving problems and participating in programming challenges for fun and
profit.


*About the Role*


Programming problems, and automated testing of user submissions, are our
core offering to our customers. We have a team of dedicated problem setters
who are constantly coming up with new and interesting problems. We are
looking for a person to own the copy editing job so what we present to our
users is of the highest quality.


*Responsibilities:*


   - *Core* - Edit the copy of the problem statement so it is grammatically
   correct and easy to understand, even if hard to solve!
   - Optional - After every hackathon or a contest, we'd like to write a
   detailed blog post on different solutions, approaches, algorithms used to
   solve the challenge.
   - Optional - Interviewing top hackers on their approach to coding.
   - Optional - Content of any marketing material (eg:
   hackerrank.com/olympics)

*A Successful Candidate would:*

   - be a recent CS undergrad degree; or at least be comfortable with CS
   concepts and jargon.
   - have excellent command over English and would be able to recite Strunk
   & White by chapter and verse.
   - be comfortable working with nerds.
   - be comfortable working in a fast paced environment of a startup.

Supported escape sequences:

 ~C   - open a command line
 ~R   - request rekey
 ~V/v - decrease/increase verbosity (LogLevel)

 ~?   - this message

(Note that escapes are only recognized immediately after newline.)



Typed ~? in a ssh session and found some interesting things.

~. i very useful to kill the ssh sessions, when the connection is lost due
to network disconnect and reconnect. When the ssh session is hang, we can
use ~. Enter
to terminate that session and to get the original shell.

Other key sequences also interesting.

We need to collect the text, logo, high resolution images about
various free software.

Nice. We need this to store the svg, text, logo and final images.

Make sure the final results are in very very high resolution for printing.

Nice.

What kind of calendar we are planning ?

Wall hanging calendar or desk calendar?

Desk Calendar desired by many office people.
Wall Calendar is good for home.

Need more space to add notes and reminders on wall calendar.

Here are the final images of kanchilug's effort on calendar at 2010.

https://picasaweb.google.com/kanchilug/GnuLinuxCalander2010FinalPrinted

Source is available here.
http://code.google.com/p/gnucalander/source/checkout

Feel free to use as a reference.

Check with the printers for quick printing.
They will ask for Illustrator SVG or high quality PNG/JPG file.
Consider that they also need some time for printing, as they will
get lot of similar orders in the new year time.

Message-ID: <CAND2795md1SboEM27QK2BjqCR5LZe8zFv1XB3gyB_H-GGM+mXw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a huge text file. example: huge-text.csv

I have to find and replace multiple strings example: strings.txt

cat strings.txt

one = {{ONE}}
PP = {{Public Park}}
ok = {{Okey}}



Like this this file has multiple pairs of strings to find and replace.
It has unicode strings also as tamil, telugu words to find and replace.

Is there any way to do this using  the GNU/Linux utilities?

Thanks.

sed -e 's/one/{{ONE}}/g' -e 's/PP/{{Public Park}}/g' -e 's/ok/{{OKey}}/g'
strings.txt

Use -i after sed for 'inplace' editing within the file, else it will just
display the contents.

Found some similar answer here too.
http://superuser.com/questions/618407/multiple-search-and-replace-actions-in-one-large-text-file

<quote>
If you have many more search patterns, you could save them in a file
and read the substitutions from there. For example, say these are the
contents of replacements.txt:

www\.abcdef www.test.abcdef
www\.klmnop www.test.klmnop

You can then read a list of N replacements and replace them with this:

while read from to; do
  sed -i "s/$from/$to/" infile.txt ;
done < replacements.txt

NOTES:

This assumes your search strings do not contain spaces and any strange
characters need to be escaped in replacements.txt.
It will run one sed per replacement which may take a while if you have
many replacement operations.
It can deal with an arbitrary number of replacements (thousands or
millions or whatever) as long as you don't mind that it will take a
bit more time.

Another option would be to write the above as a sed script:

s/www\.abcdef/www\.test\.abcdef/g;
s/www\.kmlnop/www\.test\.klmnop/g;
s/aaaa/bbbb/g;
s/cccc/dddd/g;
s/eeee/ffff/g;

You can then run the script on your file and it will make all the
replacements in one go:

sed -f replace.sed infile.txt


</quote>


Exploring these.

I believe SE-Linux policy is preventing you from doing it. Try disabling it.

Hi,

       Thanks for your reply. I have resolved this issue.
First I entered Rescue mode then checked all the directory permission.

Issue :
            "/bin" and "/lib64" both directory permission  has been changed
( 755 to 644).

Solution :

             I have changed above mentioned directory permission from 644
to 755.

You should take some extra care while fiddling with /bin or /sbin/. Do
no set blindly 755. Certain files like su, mount require set user id
also. Please compare with another clean install and then set
permission.

Is this server on a public IP address?

RHEL/CentOS default apache log location is /var/log/httpd unless you
have changed the location in the config files.

apache logrotate policy would be somewhere in /etc/logrotate.d.

If there is no log files in /var/log/httpd then it is quite likely
that your system is b0rk3d.

rpm -a --verify should report any anomalies in files installed from
official CentOS repos.

'aide' is more versatile if you have installed packages from tar balls.

(Weekend preferred)

Hope you have  GNU/Linux lab there for workshop.

Great initiative.

Just collect some interested students from 1,2 3,4 years.
We can help them to learn the Free Software Philosophies and GNU/Linux.

We can conduct GNU/Linux Demo day inside the college campus with that team.

Thus, slowly we can build the interest in GNU/Linux among students.

The team can conduct similar events in other colleges too.

Once they are ready for programming, we can help them to contribute to
open source software too.

Thanks for your interest in encouraging students into Free Software.
Feel free to ask for any kind of assistance.

Friends.

Please help us to find some speakers for this month meeting.

ILUGC is the one of the very few GNU/Linux users group which is running
monthly meetings regularly.

It will be great to keep it running as far as we can.
We need the help of all our members to make the meetings running.

We should not stop the meetings because we lack speakers.

Please try to get speakers from your friends, social media, colleagues etc.
Please contribute to the Chennai GNU/Linux community.

Thanks.

One possible mechanism in bash is :

echo 'export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "' >> /etc/profile
echo 'export HISTSIZE=5000' >> /etc/profile
echo 'export PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a"' >> /etc/profile

This will help track last 5000 commands typed in any terminal window

one just has to type

history -r

in the terminal logged in as the user whose history one wants to track

man bash

will give more detailed information. Beware it is around 200+ screenfuls

However, if the system has been b0rk3ed, the cracker will most likely
remove the command history as well e.g. '> ~/.bash_history' or disable
command history logging (export HISTFILE=/dev/null) *before* s/he goes
about doing the damage!

Yes, using history command to track the changes made to the system is not
convincing. There should be some auditing tool to track the changes, any
suggestions please.

Message-ID: <CABzJUX5mxMU8rSz8HNLA8MCm3VR4SW+Up6f-VQ-Kv8cpNrzmoQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am using a 32-bit archlinux chroot <
http://xyne.archlinux.ca/projects/arch32-light/> to keep my host system
purely 64-bit. I couldn't get the source to compile, so I had to resort to
the binary installer provided by redhat <
http://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/msp430_public_sw/mcu/msp430/MSPGCC/1_00_00_00/exports/Msp430GCCopensource-msp430-130423-272-linux-installer.run>.
I installed it under /usr/local when prompted for a installation directory,
the default was /opt/MspGCCOpensource. Compilation of a trivial program,
the standard blink fails as the compiler is unable to find the header
'msp430.h'. I found that the header was installed in
'/usr/local/lib/gcc/msp430-elf/4.8.0/plugin/include/config/msp430/msp430.h'.
Is there a way in which I can make this visible to gcc?

For the moment, I am using ubuntu-12.04 LTS in my desktop. I would very
much want the development environment setup in my laptop. I have only used
gcc in its very basic form, I tried the include flag,
'-I/usr/local/lib/gcc/msp430-elf/4.8.0/plugin/include/config/msp430/msp430.h',
still it fails.

option-1: (command line option)

Remove the header file name 'msp430.h' from the above flag and try

-I/usr/local/lib/gcc/msp430-elf/4.8.0/plugin/include/config/msp430

option-2: (Through environment variable)

$C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gcc/msp430-elf/4.8.0/plugin/include/config/msp430
$export C_INCLUDE_PATH

Now compile your program and post your results.

Hello People,

Chennai Ruby meet up on Jan 18 in Spritle will be video graphed. I asked 
my boss, and he said yes for it. Though 36 have signed for it in 
facebook https://www.facebook.com/events/219938301520411/ , not many 
will make it. But we felt all must know whats going on.

These videos will be put up on Youtube, links will be shared in 
Chennairb (plus banglore, pune, hydrabad) so that people won't really 
miss it.

I hope all meetups in Chennai ruby (wish ilugc meet-ups too) should be 
video graphed and we must set standards. I am quiet confident that with 
enough right push, Chennai can beat california.

Message-ID: <CAND2797gkRSR1XojJ=FjeRY7B1jrrsfzKg2i3Y8tRKttK5b6AA@mail.gmail.com>

I have a apache server which is getting lot of requests.
The VPS has 8GB of RAM.
Tuned its options to serve better.

Apache goes down when the requests are high.
After sometime, it comes up.

Will moving the apache to any cloud server like AWS or rackspace,
make the apache to server even more requests?

As for as I know, AWS can provide extra boxes when required.
I dont think extra box can keep the apache alive and to server more.

I may need extra RAM to have some more space to apache for forking its threads.

Will I get extra RAM automatically, when required in these cloud solutions?

Will they put any limit for the RAM size?

One of the solution is to use a load balancer if you want to handle
very high traffic.   Load balancer typically has an option to offload
SSL (for https) so that it can handle SSL encryption/decryption using
dedicated hardware chip and at wirespeed.  LB will act like a reverse
proxy.  With sufficient servers on the backend and using a load
balancer in the front, it can easily handle million request/second.

We are creating cover images for the ebooks in http://FreeTamilEbooks.com

We use gimp.

The workflow is as below.

1. select the image
2. fix the size ( crop / move)
3. Add a background colour
4. Add few lines of text

It takes much time for me to do in GIMP.

Is there any online web applications to do these?

If not, can anyone create this?

Maybe - but 8GB RAM is a good spec. Can I take a look at the current setup?

How are you copying?

Are you using cp command?

or copying via any programming language?

May be you should try using a tablet / phone. Android / Ubuntu Touch /
Tizen / Firefox OS with a image editing app will be better. Using
touch to crop / move will feel natural and can make things faster.

Hope this helps,

Using another device is more work.
GIMP would be even simpler than this.

Did you read the man pages of rm command (try running 'man rm' and
read through it)? If you had done either that or did a search on your
favorite search engine, you would have found the answer. Any way, here
it is on a plate for you. The flag you are looking for is '-i'.

If you can use your own server I think OwnCloud will do. It has ODF
support and has a working office suite (if I am correct). May be you
can give it a try and can decide.

Don't use M$ products. You will be under it's mercy at some point of
time in the future and will be stuck.

+1. MS will first create a dependency and then shaft you on renewal
licenses. The SQL server 2012 license cost quoted to our company is
astronomical as compared to  SQL Server 2008 but there have no choice since
migrating to any other stack is prohibitively expensive

Client side, during installation.

Server side - It is better to sync your client with one of the many
public ntp servers e,g, 0.pool.ntp.org.

Thanks for the link, but I can't understand the configuration done on it.
Why should we restrict it and remove the restriction.

Subject: [Ilugc] Additional virtual console
Message-ID: <CAEKRDfKAENQrsiFD7=8Mso3DE2QQ8qdmXiOARqQjpBww=N3h-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,
In rhel 6 there are only 6 virtual console are enabled in the
/etc/init/start-ttys.conf file. How to add additional virtual consoles ? So
that I can switch to other consoles by giving the command chvt 17 or chvt
20 something like that like-wise in rhel 5. If possible how many virtual
consoles could be created?

Have you enabled the koha site using the 'a2ensite' command? If not,
apache2 will default to showing the default site with the default
page. Depending on your requirements, you can disable the default site
as suggested on the wiki page.

When starting a new thread, compose a new email instead of replying on
top of an existing email and changing the subject. If you don't know
what LDAP is, I would strongly recommend that you learn about it
before trying to configure anything related to LDAP. Use your favorite
search engine or somewhere like the OpenLDAP documentation to get
started. I agree that the learning curve could be steep, but once you
go through that it will be very useful for you.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

I have migrated MS SQL server to Postgresql when I was in Chennai for a company.

Not much of a cost so to speak.

Few tsql stored procedures had to be recoded. That it all.

Don't Scare people from migrating to FLOSS please.

Hi Ravi,

LDAP is for authentication and authorisation purpose.Consider you have
active directory which consists of numerous Distributions
lists(rocks at googlegroups.com).
This groups consists of 5 members gmailids.If you provide username and
password,it will validate against your username and password in active
directory.It is known as authentication and if checking if that gmailid is
in that particular group or not is authorisation.

Changes to be done in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
1.Change the log level to debug mode and check for errors in
/var/log/httpd/error.log
2.<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin hariprasadh89 at gmail.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
    ServerName (hostname given correctly)
    ErrorLog /var/log/error.log
    <Location /sss>
         AuthBasicProvider ldap
         AuthType Basic
         AuthzLDAPAuthoritative off
         AuthName "Enter ur AD username and password"
         AuthLDAPURL "
ldap://xxx.com:389/OU=yyy,DC=zzz,DC=aaa?sAMAccountName?sub?(objectClass=*)"
         AuthLDAPBindDN "hariprasadh89 at gmailcom"
         AuthLDAPBindPassword password
         require valid-user
         Require group rocks at googlegroups.com
        Require ldap-group CN=rocks OU=goolegroups,DC=gmail,DC=com
    </Location>
    ProxyPass /sss http://ipaddr:8080/sss               //This is proxy pass
    ProxyPassReverse /sss http://ipaddr:8080/sss
    </VirtualHost>

3.i have changed the referals off in /etc/openldap/ldap.conf

4.Restart apache :service httpd restart

Thanks,
HariPrasadh

Glad to hear that , by the way are you using any specific spin / custon distro ?
I have recently seen
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Scientific_Packages_List and it looks
interesting for scientific institutes .

It has some basic packages like gnuplot, xfig, LaTex compilers, numpy,
etc.  Maybe it could be modified or  I guess you are already doing
something like that .

I have downloaded Open-Tamil from

I have successfully installed using "python setup.py install"

When i run the above command terminal will shows like following

setup.py install
running install
running build
running build_py
running install_lib
running install_egg_info
Removing

Writing /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Open_Tamil-0.2.1_dev.egg-info

I explore
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Open_tamil-0.2.1_dev.egg-info file.
It shows only what are the goals achieved. I don't know how to use it. I
think it is installed successfully. But where i find the app? Or how to run
it?

I always provide the complete Fedora distro repository and custom kickstart
scripts to the institutions, so that they can install any packages from the
local repository.  So as part of EFD celebration I have planned to setup
local software repository using Fedora-20 (i386/x86_64) in few institutions.

Today myself conducted a half day workshop in B.S.Abdur Rahman University,
Vandalur and introduced Fedora-20 for all the System Engineers in the
University.

Subject: [Ilugc] Fix a Bug - Earn 200 $
Message-ID: <CAK2rq7x2egnv2vFLOtp6_SBXSemiZYr_6Dw6pw0_drjKJmTdbg@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I faced this issue  in Cinnamon desktop where a Chromium browser
window opened in full screen could not be reverted back to original
state. One had to close the browser and open again to escape full
screen. Very annoying especially if you are used to viewing sites full
screen often. This issue persisted for a while and was faced by many
others as well.

One user (a generous soul as well ;-) ) could not wait and placed a
200 $ offer for anyone who fixes the issue and it so happened that
developer also came across this issue around some time and fixed it.
He declared hsi intent that incentive wasnt really money and asked him
to donate to project team (Mint). Clem, Mint project lead, ehwould
prefer that developer got the amount and was eventually paid.

Now a commit of one line change earned him 200$.  Of course,one needs
to know what to change. :-)

Follow the issue thread here. I happened to report the issue as well.

https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/2500

Two things noting here, user's willingness to pay for good software
and that good work (albeit sometimes) can generate extraordinary
returns. :-)

With the advent of crowd-funding sites like Kickstarter and indiegogo,
developers can raise money to work additional hours and develop good
software. We, as community, should also support such causes, encourage
and promote good work by creating good incentives.

____________________________


"Finally there is a free software laptop that respects your freedom as it
comes from the store," Richard M. Stallman.

We don't usually send press release messages to this list, but this is a
big announcement!

If you want to see even more hardware certified in 2014, please help us
reach our $450k winter fundraising goal with a $20
donation<https://u.fsf.org/ryf2013>
.
Gluglug X60 Laptop now certified to Respect Your Freedom [image: Gluglug
X60]

BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Thursday, December 19, 2013 -- The Free
Software Foundation (FSF) today awarded Respects Your Freedom (RYF)
certification to Gluglug X60 laptops. The RYF certification mark means that
the product meets the FSF's standards in regard to users' freedom, control
over the product, and privacy. This is the first laptop to receive RYF
certification from the FSF.

It can be purchased from http://shop.gluglug.org.uk.

The FSF has had a call out for a laptop sold with a free OS and free boot
system <https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/free-bios.html> since 2005. Today it
announced that the call has been met.

"Finally there is a free software laptop that respects your freedom as it
comes from the store," stated Richard M. Stallman, founder and president of
the FSF.

The boot programs (such as a BIOS) run when a computer is turned on and
their primary purpose is to initialize the hardware before loading the
operating system. Computer makers not only install nonfree boot programs,
but they also have made it notoriously difficult for free software
developers to have access to the necessary hardware specifications and
information needed to produce free software replacements.

When a user purchases a product that bears the Respects Your Freedom
certification mark, they can be confident they are recieving a product that
comes with a free boot program and OS, as well as documentation under free
licenses, multimedia unencumbered by proprietary formats, and the assurance
it is not known to contain any backdoors and is not designed to share
users' information without their knowledge (e.g. spyware).

"This announcement comes at a time when people have a heightened concern
over controlling their data and securing their communication. Proprietary
software is by nature fundamentally insecure, because it uses both force of
law and technological measures to prohibit a user from controlling and
securing her own computer. This new complete system runs on free software
and is backed by the FSF's commitment to do our best at ensuring respect
for your freedom and privacy," said FSF executive director John Sullivan.

The Gluglug X60 laptops are refurbished models of Lenovo's ThinkPad?? X60.
Gluglug has updated the computer by adding a modern wifi chipset, replacing
the proprietary BIOS with a free software boot system made by modifying
Coreboot to remove all proprietary microcode and proprietary blobs, and
replacing the proprietary Microsoft Windows OS with the FSF-endorsed, Trisquel
GNU/Linux <https://trisquel.info> OS.

"The Gluglug X60 laptop is a major victory for computer users and
supporters of the *Free BIOS* campaign. Not only has Gluglug produced a
100% free version of Coreboot that carries freedom to each user, but it has
made it easy and fun to install updates, which in my experience, make real
and noticeable improvements to the operation of the laptop. I also found
that despite the hardware being a few years old, the Gluglug X60 remains a
durable machine that is more than capable of running modern GNU/Linux
distro," added Joshua Gay, the licensing & compliance manager who heads-up
the FSF's RYF certification program.

Francis Rowe of Gluglug issued the following statement:

Gluglug is very proud to have achieved RYF certification and we will always
try to exceed the requirements. The mission of Gluglug is to promote free
software in a practical way by making it easy to find a system built for
total freedom. With the X60 laptops sold through the site you get
everything: free boot program, free operating system, free drivers, free
applications. The machines also come pre-fitted with a new 802.11n wireless
card that is fully compatible with free software.

The machines come fully loaded with Trisquel GNU/Linux, and they can also
have gNewSense <http://www.gnewsense.org> or Parabola
GNU/Linux<http://parabolagnulinux.org>installed on request. With the
Gluglug X60, you get full source code for
all of the tools used to create the boot program, plus documentation. If
you want to hack your machine, you can. That's really the whole concept.

You also get updates, so when the Gluglug makes a substantial change to the
firmware it ships, you will receive a copy of it along with documentation
for how to flash it and tweak it to your needs.

A project like this is especially important in this day and age when more
and more devices are becoming locked down with with things like Restricted
Boot <https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot>, and
containing hardware-based backdoors. The Gluglug provides an opt-out for
that kind of mistreatment.

To learn more about the Respects Your Freedom hardware certification,
including details on the certification of the Gluglug X60 laptops, as well
as information on source code for the device, visit https://www.fsf.org/ryf.
Hardware sellers interested in applying for certification can consult
criteria at https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/criteria.

For those needing to purchase other hardware, the FSF recommends the
h-node.org database, as well as direct users toward hardware sellers that
offer laptops with GNU/Linux preinstalled. The FSF is also asking
supporters to write to Intel
<https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/free-bios.html>asking for the company
to ship laptops with a free boot system to begin
with, so that users can buy brand new freedom-respecting hardware in the
future.
About the Free Software Foundation

freedom) software -- particularly the GNU operating system and its
GNU/Linux variants -- and free documentation for free software. The FSF
also helps to spread awareness of the ethical and political issues of
freedom in the use of software, and its Web sites, located at fsf.org and
gnu.org, are an important source of information about GNU/Linux. Donations

Message-ID: <CAND2794ASrOOMo6uZCj6SdMa8OvjXmmcu-N3jS8Xw+KyGGSj5w@mail.gmail.com>

I wanted to know how long it will take to transfer 145G file in a
1.35MB/sec transfer rate.

Found the tool qalc is so useful for this.


Here is the execution results.

qalc "145Gibyte / 1.35(Mibyte/second) to day"

You need the download exchange rates to be able to convert between
different currencies.
You can later get current exchange rates with the "exchange rates" command.
Do you want to fetch exchange rates now from the Internet (default yes)? yes

(145 * gibibyte) / (1.35 * (mebibyte / second)) = approx. 1.2729767 d

it will take 1.5 days.

I would strongly recommend you to use the "Official" repositories.

If you have subscription with Redhat, you can use their own channels.

OTOH if it is for experimenting, use Centos and enable the requisite
repositories.

I would strongly recommend using the official repositories.

You may find it useful to have EPEL repository enabled.

I did not come across any SBC with 3-4 ethernet ports built in when I
needed them for a project a year back. Of course there are many boards
available internationally. One of my friends had got an SBC with 8 ethernet
ports and a built in 16x2 lcd module. It was bought from Singapore. If you
need the details I can get it for you.

@Girish? you were also searching right? Did you source any from India?

I have come across some product by Compulab Israel, with 6 Lan Port. Below
the reference link.

https://compulab.co.il/products/embedded-pcs/usvr/

Other possibility (not sure how relevant this in your case) is there are
lot of SBC's (both ARM based and X86) which is coming with two LAN by
default. And you can add extra by using USB to LAN converter which is very
cheap in market.

Subject: [Ilugc] Improving dhvani - Crowd funding
Message-ID: <CANc+2y4qkxi17emcfH8rqcMPo1pMbzWzrr6i-MBCi=3ihz0mFA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Intro about dhvani:
As we all know dhvani is a Text to speech system for Indian languages.
It has a lot of scope if developed well. There is a lot of work to do
(writing documentation, packaging, adding different voice, writing
code, testing) but we don't have people to work on that. I, Shrini and
Mohan are the contributers now. It will be great if people could start
contributing to dhvani. It is a good project work for college students
and those who want to get exposed to real life coding.

Crowd funding:
Is it a good idea to get some funds through crowd funding for getting
some developers in? Please provide your thoughts on this. At least
through funding we can get some more people to work on this project.

Please provide list of desired features, ideas on how to distribute
the funds, how to evaluate people who want to code etc.


Note:
This is just an idea. Anyone can participate in improving dhvani or
take responsibility of managing the crowd sourcing work. Volunteers
welcome as always.

= December Monthly Meet

== Date & Time

28 December
3:00pm to 5:00pm

== Venue

Zilogic Systems,
Fourth Main Road,
Kamaraj Nagar,
Thiruvanmiyur,
Chennai

Location map: http://www.zilogic.com/contact.html

== Agenda

Talk 1: Twisted, Getting Started
by Vijay Kumar
Duration: 45min

Twisted is an event-driven network engine written in Python. This
talk, will cover the following topics - Event Loops and How They Work,
Implementing Protocols. The talk will include lots of Examples and
Demos, to get you started with Twisted.
Links: http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/

Talk 2: Unit Testing with Mocks
by Manikandan
Duration: 30min

This talk will show how to use 'unittest.mock' to simplify unittesting
of modules that have complex behaviors like sending/receiving SMS,
email, sending/receiving data through serial port, etc.

The 'unittest.mock' module in the Python standard library allows
programmers to replace parts of the system under test with mock
objects. The programmer can configure the mock object to return
specific values, when a method is invoked. The programmer can also
assert if the mock object was invoked in a certain way.
Links: http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/unittest.mock

If you would like to give a lightning talk, just come prepared, we
will be able to accommodate you.

If you are new to Python, the tutorial at
http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/ will give you a quick
overview of what Python is all about.

Regards,
Vijay

Hi,

How to add wvdail in bootup.

I have a datacard connected to a machine, once the machine boots it should
automatically connect to the internet via datacard.

I tried configuring defaults in wvdial.conf and added

auto ppp0
iface ppp0 inet wvdial

in /etc/network/interfaces not while restarting network i am not getting
the connections.

So how to achieve this. Please do help.

Still you can improve the quality of the translation. There are
translations which is translated word by word.
Usually when we do quality check in real time projects, we check whether
the meaning is conveyed right or not ?
Try to do translation based on the meaning and dont try to replicate the
sense. Before translation go through other pages/programs which is
previously translated.

This mail is to improve your work and not to criticise your work. Good
work, keep going.

Message-ID: <CAJLBBzwCjc4ZeotHt3-VvPDgViwRWj730uPb3gKRZB0h37jXeA@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I have in the impression that , difference between 32bit/64bit hardware &
OS is handling of physicall address (means handling greater memory size.
(2^32 address bus for  32 bit machine, 2^64 bit address bus for 64bit
machine)

recently i purchased the i3 laptop which is 64 bit arch & 4GB RAM.
So i thought i should install 64bit OS.

I have installed 64 bit ubunt 13.10 OS. But i realized ubuntu 64 bit is
only for server. no GUI & not for day to day usage.

Googled and identified, i should install 13.10 - 32bit OS which supports
above 2GB memory using PAE feature.

I have installed and worked for me.

There are few questions in my mind which is not clear to me.

1) what is the diff between 32 bit & 64 bit machine. where we can see the
real use cases of 64 bit machine?

2) Ubuntu donest have 64 bit OS for day-to-day usage?

3) Can i use 64bit virtual machine (using virtualbox/xen ) on 32bit OS

Thanks

Ubuntu for 64 bit (non-server) is available. 64bit hardware has more
registers and more instruction set. To utilise full power and the
money you have spent on buying the hardware install 64 bit Ubuntu.

Hello everyone!
Arun you are completely right! We are by no means very good at this. 
But we wanted to put our 
language up there and started it. It's open source. 
It would be nice if you or someone else could 
improve the translation.

And thanks for the advice to see other Tamil applications. 
Never thought of that. I will try and fix 
the mistakes.

But anybody can do it. That's the whole point. 

I do understand that you're not criticising. Thank you.

I hope we can get donations from our friends here.

But we need to plan on how much we want, how to share with contributors etc.

We can list the requirements and fix the cost too, so that any developer
can pick his interested one and work on that.

I do not have much experience with Ubuntu, so I will limit my answer
specifically to the topic of 32-bit vs 64-bit.

There are three pieces that need to fall into place before you can call
your system fully 64-bit:

1. The Hardware - this means you can install and use more than 4 GB RAM.
This is the biggest advantage of going for a 64 bit machine in the first
place. In addition to higher supported RAM, the processor's general purpose
registers are 64 bits big, meaning they are capable of larger computations
in the processor, stack pushes and pops can happen at 64 bits at a time and
stuff like that.

2. The Operating System - The OS, standing is it does between the hardware
and the user, needs to use the additional address bits the hardware makes
available. As with most processor / hardware improvements, OSes typically
lag quite a bit in supporting the new features. Without an OS that
specifically supports 64 bit memory access, you will not be able to use the
additional memory even on a 64 bit hardware. So this is pretty important.

3. Your software needs to be compiled for 64 bit - Finally, given how these
hardware and operating systems are designed to be backward compatible, you
can continue to write 32 bit programs to run on them. And usually they will
run just fine - perhaps even without any performance penalties. However
there are some benefits for moving to 64 bit sooner rather than later - C
long variables will now become 64 bit so you can do more efficient larger
integer math (if you care about such things), and such stuff. But the main
reason most of us should move to 64 bit is that over time all key libraries
and systems would have moved to 64 bit and you will really have no choice.
So better make the move now itself.

Dear Team,

Good initiative.

I'm just wondering whether these kind of projects are not funded from
Government funds for tamil projects ?

Siva.

No, you downloaded the server version then. I have a Ubuntu 64-bit USB
install and it has a full desktop GUI install.
You can download the desktop version from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop

No. If your host OS is 32-bit, your guest OS cannot be 64-bit.
Host OS          Guest OS          Status

First try changing settings , disabling all extensions and see if it
works , if it doesn't delete the entire hidden folder of chrome(guess
its .config/google-chrome) which will be in home directory , that
should help .  I am pretty sure it wont come back unless if you
install those crazy extensions or run malicious JS .

Try using Ad blocker , No script extensions for a better browser experience  .

Yes government funds can be available. But the problem is with the
procedures to be followed, finding contacts etc. I feel that will be a
very big task than writing code (will be glad to be proved wrong).

Dear Prasanna,

Ok I understand your concern. I think If we have something very solid I
think we would be able to get it through. Can we plan something like a
google handout and get started on this. Start publishing our learnings and
goals accordingly so that we can get the necessary community support.

Thanks.

Siva.

Prasanna,

Thanks for your quick response.

We need to arrive on the following:

1. What is the immediate goals we have on Dhavni?
2. What kind of people we need to attract to work dedicatedly on this?
3. What will be the skills we would be looking for apart from C-Language?
4. Do we have a list of WishList of To-Do which is already pending or
half-done?
5. What will be the target market we are looking at , if we are looking for
funding?

Siva.

Making it usable and making more people to use Dhvani may be the
immediate goal as far as I see. But anyone can come up with better
goal / code and provide patch, it is always welcome.

> 2. What kind of people we need to attract to work dedicatedly on this?

Students and people interested in linguistics / languages (especially
Indian languages).

> 3. What will be the skills we would be looking for apart from C-Language?

We need people with interest. Knowing Indian language is necessary.
Knowing multiple will greatly help in comparing and understanding
things better. And coding (or logical thinking) skill is required.

> 4. Do we have a list of WishList of To-Do which is already pending or

So far I have fixed memory leaks and cleaned up the code. There exists
a TODO list in the repository.
I started moving the build system to cmake from autotools but it is
not finished yet. It will make porting to Android, windows easier.
Also understanding / editing autotools files are difficult so this
will help in development also.

Target audience will be a better term I think. Funding not in a
commercial sense (where people expect returns as money). Target
audience are Indian people and the aim is to reduce the digital divide
(I see Dhvani as a small step in tackling a bigger problem - small
drop that makes a ocean).

PrasannaKumar

Hi Ravi Chandran,

In addition to the above one line.
Please be aware that
 
locate does not search the files on disk rather it searches for file paths
in a database. The locate database file is located at
"/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db". Hence, in order to get the latest and
reliable results from "locate" command the database on which it works
should be updated at regular intervals using another utility known as
"updatedb".

Subject: [Ilugc] Call for Donations - Kaniyam completes two years
Message-ID: <CAND2797O9uYLtKS9+KpheMrfhoBDqpnG=NQR0jgxWLnBxx5WbQ@mail.gmail.com>

Two years ago, I was dreaming of brining a Tamil e magazine for Free/Open
source software.

Friends in our list and other lists liked the idea and came forward to
write articles in tamil.

Amachu sponsored web space.
Friends contributed articles.


On Jan 1 2012, First edition of Kaniyam was released at www.kaniyam.com

Since then, every month, friends are writing articles regularly.

We released separate ebooks for MySQL and GNU/Linux too.
http://www.kaniyam.com/ebooks/


We are a small group of volunteers who love Free/open Source Software and
Tamil.
We believe that learning new technologies in Tamil will help the for the
growth of te language and people.

So far we have released 23 editions.

On Jan 1 2014, we enter into 3rd year.

I like to thanks the contributors for their enormous efforts.
Volunteers are spread around Tamil Nadu and some are in abroad too.

Planning to gift them with the books they like.
Chennaishopping.com balachandar agreed to help on this.


Looking for donations to encourage them and show some gratitude.

Please send your donations.

Do we have any platform independent Sound Libraries :( .

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyTTS/3.0

Probably I'm going out of context. Whats are the options we have for
windows and other operations systems.?

There are some available. As of now Dhvani uses GStreamer for sound and it
is cross platform. I am also planning to use some other library that is
small and does not have huge dependencies. It is on my to do list.

Prasanna Kumar.

Nope, you just cannot run a 64 bit guest on a 32 bit host.

by installing 32 bit OS you are not fully utlilising the capability of your
machine which supports 64 bit. It is about addressing capacity as you
mentioned.

bigger container can hold smaller, but reverse is not possible. The OS
manages the capacity, the capability is mentioned as 32 bit and 64 bit in
OS spec. While hardware capacity and OS capacity should match for the
optimum, other possibilities as listed out by Mehul Ved exist.
