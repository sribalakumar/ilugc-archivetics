My humble request to you would be to not analyze things.

Instead try to motivate students thro' positive ideas. If possible
try to throw in some technical tips. I wish to quote this here.

"Nearly everything we do will be insignificant but it is very
important that we do it. "

 -- Mahatma Gandhi

The problem with we seniors is that we only demotivate since
we have seen failures. But young students need motivation.
If you can motivate them, do it. If not it is better to keep quiet.

Please don't misunderstand me. I don't mean to point my finger
at anyone.

I really appreciate Chandradeep's efforts to share his experiences. I
really respect his experience and his efforts to make it known to the
public. It takes a great deal of strength and courage to openly speak
of one's failings.

I would urge more of the seniors to narrate their experiences.
Doesn't matter if it is success or failure. It will help students.
They will figure out what is good for them automatically.

I disagree with Chandradeep as far as my experience goes.
No, I don't mean to say he is wrong, definitely not. Just that my
experience is different.

I recently thought that adding a resume feature to scp would be cool
but that patch was rejected. Since their project goals were different
from what I thought.

At the same time engineers should never reinvent the wheel. But
students should at least do it for some time. Otherwise how do you
learn?

So I wish to vehemently oppose the stance that these projects are all
already done. It is the most demotivating statement one can ever make.
Please please refrain from making such remarks.

If posibble, motivate young people. And help them. Do something real
and practical. If not at least don't demotivate.

This is my humble request to you. Consider me as your brother  and
weigh my words. Please don't get offended.

All of these projects as far as I am concerned have lot of potential
and real life value.

Let me leave the students to decide.

Wish you good luck!  Please don't hesitate to mail me in person or to
the list in case you need further guidance.

regards,
Girish

PS:- I would much appreciate if references to my name stopped. I
neither need praise nor criticism. I just want you to take my words at
face value and evaluate my words. If you like them, take it . If you
don't , reject . Don't associate my name with it. It is a humble
request. This is a community effort, not an individual one. Remember
that we are a team.

Cant it be seen as a way to kindle innovation in students? When three doors
are closed, you try to find a fourth door.

PS: Reference to the the author of the quoted text stopped as he wished so.

Accessing above URL throws a "403 Forbidden".

However, http://www.chennailug/org/v2/index.html is fine.

I received mine. Took some time though.

Btw, I got the conformation mail from mbchander@gmail. Would be good
if it's admin@chennailug.org. Possible ? If not something like
chennailug@gmail.com could also be done.

Any thoughts if we should enable Gmail Hosted E-mail for chennailug ?
It's not FOSS though.

Do we have to signup all new ? If we had a previous login-id, can't we 
make use of the same. (I have tried out all combinations of a login-id, 
trying to get a new password and its been saying username is not valid)

  http://chennailug.org/guidelines

1. Use a proper subject line.

2. Do not troll in the mailing list

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll

But, don't misuse this to start flame wars or to troll
in the mailing list.

4. Do not top-post:

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting

Example of a top-post:

Because it messes up the order in which
people normally read text.

Top-posting.

Always use bottom-posting.

> What is your name ?
My name is ILUGC.

5. Do not over-quote:

Example of an over-quote:

>>> On Friday you said
>>> blah blah blah
>> On Saturday you said
>> foo foo foo
> On Sunday you said
> foobar

6. Do not post HTML messages

7. Do not recycle messages

8. Do not send attachments

This survey means _NOTHING_.

All it shows is that Linux on Desktop is fragmented and as long as it
stays that way, it will always lag behind Windows. And Ubuntu's
precious Bug #1 will never close.

Keep up the in-fighting distro's, I'm proud of you.

i just setup the base system with civicspace as i mentioned in the
website. Also i already said in a mail that i need to integrated with
mailman. i am in the process of moving the wiki users to drupal and
cleaning up the wiki. it would take some time for me to clean up.

for toufeeq
i kept my email id for testing and i dont know abt admin email access.

also i might try to integrate mailman to drupal (civicspace)

at the end, chennailug.org will be

1. single sign on for blog, website, mail manager, wiki
2. Event management
3. user Profiles

If your answer is yes, then he is not a Professional at all and his 4 
years of professional educations attains no meaning.



The problem is not w.r.t the students; its w.r.t the lack of interest on the teacher's(note: i am not calling them profs, as most of the instructors in pvt colleges arent profs and are mere teachers who do not have any specialization in any field) end. I had pathetic experience during my University days, most of the instructors could not even understand a basic Object Recognition System; worst of all the instructor who used to teach me Neural Network couldnt understand the most fundamental of the networks that I had implemented. It is right in here (the VOID) that i expect orgs like ours to chip in. 

We ought to inculcate students about the technologies that are available and how easily accessible they are. LUGgers are doing a great job w.r.t tis objective. I am neither a proponent nor an opposer of FOSS, but i do understand the potential merits that it can bring in to the society.

it really depends on your needs , peraphs if all you want is internet 
sharing you can write simple scripts to achieve ip masquerading , i remember 
doing it once in my cafe for 25 systems on a woody debian and it worked , a 
server with no x , all it took was writing simple scripts for ip  
masquerading .

Firstly, thanks to Prashanth, Shakthi and this group in general...my sound
problem is solved! Thanks again!!

However, I've discovered a another problem. I'm loving it ;)
Kubuntu halts half way through shutting down. It just stops, sometimes
making a flamboyant display on the screen (with a blinking cursor) or says
"Will halt now", which it never does or a blank screen (I think I saw a
cursor).
The same is the case with init 0.
Also there was this delay before it shutdown, I could still click, open
terminal and type something etc. for a few seconds.

Restarting is not a problem.


My specs:
AMD Athlon 64 3000+
Asus A8V UAYKZ mobo, 512 MB RAM, 80 GB SATA HDD.

Looking forward to another learning experience

You need to install the ACPI "button" module.  As root, run
"modprobe button", failing which run "modprobe acpi_button",
and then call shutdown.  Read your distro's documentation on
how to automatically load the button module.

Here is a Gentoo help document that you may find useful:
http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Shutdown_headless_server_when_power-button_pressed

You are asking for free advice and nobody is obligated to
come to your assistance.  In such a circumstance, it's
good manners to not demand help, but make a polite request.

Hi,

It depends on who blames whom.

It should be more like:

Students: should blame themselves for not learning or
doing anything productive in their four years of
learning, and wasting lot of their precious time
(exceptions are 5-6 students who do *practical*
implementation).

Faculty: should blame themselves for not trying to
learn, or keep themself current with technology,
avoiding inter-departmental politics (and misusing the
students for the same), and helping students in their
*practical* work (exceptions are 2-3 professors who
really motivate their students and help them).

Management: should blame themselves for not providing
sufficient resources/freedom to students, faculty
(there are exceptional management too). 

So, each one should blame themselves and correct
themselves and see what they can really do and show it
proudly as *their work*, irrespective of the odds/pain
 they suffer, and the drawbacks/limitations they face.

It is all about *attitude*.

I don't think Ubuntu's Bug #1 is meant to be serious. With or without 
in-fighting, it's gonna take some time to fix that bug anyway. I'm an 
Ubuntu fan myself, but I sure don't want *only one* distro out there. 
Simply because choice is good. When I get bored of Ubuntu, maybe I'll 
move to Gentoo or FreeBSD (when I'm feeling masochistic) - but I like 
the fact that I have the choice.

Don't worry about Bug #1. Just be thankful that we don't have to worry 
too much about it. Have fun - if they have any sense, they will catch on ;-)

Faculty should blame themselves for not inspiring the
students and helping them discover their best.  A
teacher/guru's role is to identify raw potential in
students, and mold it in the same way a potter moulds
clay on his wheel.


> Management: should blame themselves for not providing

Management should be questioned about their true intent
for running the institution -- profit or education.
If it's the latter, management should also be asked
what they have done to inspire their faculty and
support them in their quest.


> It is all about *attitude*.

Well said.  It's also about *our* attitude.  Enough
complaining.  I'm glad you/we are acutally doing
something about it.

you could possible add some messages in /etc/rc0.d/S??halt to see
what's happening.
Maybe it tries to hibernate or ACPI might be disabled.

The final version of Redhat I used was 4.0!  I'm probably
not best equiped to answer your question.

On my debian boxes that run 2.4/2.6 kernels, enabling this
kernel module allows me to "halt -p" and power off the box.

A good thing for headless servers is that you can also
shutdown by pressing the power button in the front panel.

The Kerala govt. must be trying to keep the treasuary

teachers to migrate to linux must be significantly
less than purchasing Windows licenses...and aren't the

Don't know about others, but I don't think this is right. This will
create a students-community with almost zero-MS knowledge and when
they go out looking for jobs, they are going to have problems.

Pushing students out with FOSS knowledge into an MS world is bound to
create problems.

Correct.
Gopal V has a better account of how it all started:
http://t3.dotgnu.info/blog/rants/kerala-linux-gpl.html

Don't be fooled by that anti-communist propaganda which found it's way
in the NYT article on slashdot.

Kernel versions 2.6+ are inherently soft real-time.

Indeed. All students in -schools- are going to use the skills they
learnt in schools (< 10th) when they go out looking for jobs.

What you learn in schools is your foundation for higher education. It
is the path, not the destination. Your argument is akin to arguing
that using hydro-electric power instead of nuclear power to run trains
will cause the trains to run slower. It is a complete non sequitur.

For many students coming out of _govt owned public schools_, the
computer education they receive there is the _only_ computer education
they might receive in the course of their education.

When 90% of the world they are going to enter is using Windows how
will that help ?

   IMHO, they've done the right thing, for the wrong reasons. They'll
polarize the debate by creating a David-vs.-Goliath analogy, as well
giving an anti-MNC, anti free-market flavour to the debate.

   It's got nothing to do with M$, really. It's basically a question of
the optimal use of public money - IMHO, it is best spent on creating
the conditions that allow a local services industry to flourish. In the
long run, FLOSS is the best choice to allow that to happen.

  If you go the proprietary, packaged route, the bulk of the wealth-
creation will probably not be locally created, but rather at the
location of the shareholders of the vendor - which is likely to be
mostly in the US (there aren't many Indian shareholders in M$,
if any).

    I'm not against globalization, free trade or any of the other
bogey-men - however, I've always got the best deals with the
local merchant next door, even in the US - and never from
mail-order or direct-sales outfits like Dell.

   It almost always pays to enrich the local merchant - he's
likely to spend the money in the neighbourhood. That lowers
the frictional coefficient in the economy by a much larger
amount than by shipping your money out to a faceless
company elsewhere in the world with huge administrative
overheads - your money goes towards subsidizing those
administrative overheads, including executive vacations in
Hawaii, etc.

   It's a no-brainer, and it's got nothing to do with communism.

There seems to be no vendor, it's an in-house distro AFAIK.
CDIT will do the training /support .

Hardware vendors seem to be having a field day selling
pre installed linux boxes without M$ looking over
their shoulders :)
 Could be that Kerala could turn into the FLOSS hub as
the rediff article states supplying the IT industry
with much needed talent.As to how short of real FLOSS
knowledge the IT world is of, just step into one of
the  IT biggies.
 Weighing the pros and cons, we have atleast one state
to counter balance the M$ monopolies in all the other 
states.

Most vendors that used to bundle pc-dos with their cheaper boxes now
bundle linux .. and the dealers typically offer a pirated win xp cd
along with it for a few Rs. extra, saying "not even mp3s work on linux"

Today we (Shakthi and myself) conducted a one day workshop on Embedded
GNU/Linux and VLSI CAD Tools at SSN College of Engineering,
Kalavakkam, near Chennai.

 Looks like things are changing just that bit, most
PCs could come atleast with Linux preinstalled.
 Even the airtel personnel who came to install the
modem knew about the various flavours of Linux. 
 Most big things happen only with a huge thrust from
the government, so Kerala could see lot of FLOSS work happening.

I totally agree.A student needs to be educated with every technology out
there. Today, OSS is not in the syllabus, so we should see that Govt. puts
them in, but not by removing M$. Which student will refuse job given to him
in a Big Company here in India ?

Today, many look to get into top 5 companies and unfortunately, they are all
into M$ projects. However, there are also good OSS companies but today
students have no exposure towards OSS since it is not there in their
syllabus.

I would say, If Kerala Govt. is totally removing M$ syllabus from the
curriculum, they are doing a BIG Mistake. Instead,they could include both
OSS and M$ subjects equally.

I dont agree to this. Can you learn VC++ and its technologies in a day!...Oh
My!..Please dont give statements that are not correct. Like GNU/Linux,
Microsoft is also strong in its Development Platform. Dont think its too
easy to master Microsoft Development Platform.I am able to tell this becoz,
am a Windows Developer as well GNU/Linux enthusiast.

so doesnt make it a hard deal for the kerala students.


Well, that you will know when they are exposed to the MS world !

if you know c++ good enough and can handle the complexiities of its 
implementation , yes vc++ is easy , mfc and other stuff gets trivial , it 
indeed is , i know a lot of ppl who learned enough vc++ in a very short span 
of maybe a week , and one being myself .and when we say microsoft product , 
i meant the basic os , i dont know any engineering college where they teach 
vc++ even in tamil nadu , though we dont use foss :) so even if kerala didnt 
have the policy of complete foss , chances of teaching vc++ is very low .

Well, when one says Windows Programming, you should be geared towards
learning VC++ - the Windows way , which I see many dont. I have taken many
seminars and classes and once I go deep into explaining what MFC generated
code does, they stop me and ask, why to learn those internals!. I am not
sure of other courses and colleges, but when I did my PG at Amrita-CBE, we
had many works done with VC++

Anyway, why to discuss about VC++ here in this list :)

Antano, if necessary, we can continue outside mailing list :))

Looks set to be a recipe for disaster :-). No support and people will
end up saying ``Linux is crap''. The biggest advantage of Windows is
that every Uncle has a prodigal nephew who can magically fix (or

This is a general misconception of new entrants into FOSS. They think, 
we are anti-M$ which is not true to even .1%. We just want them to be a 
bit ethical by not using Windows w/o paying for them. If they are going 
to get a legal copy, who raises objection. And, additionally our second 
proposal which leads to this miss conception is "why buy a proprietary 
software when a free software is available". And they take this to be 
anti-XXXX somehow. I have observed this in many people, esp students who 
are just getting to know about FOSS and GNU/Linux and who start thinking 
anti-M$ is a way to become a true tuxian or a FOSSian. This makes pro-M$ 
people, to take the exact opposite and start bashing FOSS. Only, when 
this misconception is ended and both M$ and FOSS are put on an equal 
arena to play their own games and compete in an healthy way, we will see 
a more healthier software environment around us and will be spending 
better of our time for things other than flaming ourselves.

Hello guyz,

The session started around 10:25. Mr. Antano Solar John started with LAMP
archeitecture, Basic coding structure, with Programming Logic and technique.
We had a break at around 11:30. In the tea break  Solar was shining :) in
PHP filled the  corridor.He took the audience till login page and induced
them to do a tiny project. He covered basic commands in mysql, and  the php
code to interact with the mysql. I was on and off the session. Good work
John.

The  gemini pair of  ILUGc  Srini and Balavignesh arrived in between the
"PHP" session.
Srini explained the job possiblities in the lamp arena. While Bala took the
show explaining the SERVER-CLIENT conversation with  lay man examples.
Impressive stuff Bala.

Srini and bala was interacting with the students at the fag end of  LAMP
session. we had lunch around 1:30 and we gathered for Hands on session on
php by 2:00pm. Srini and Bala continued with the hands on session installing
xampp in 5 machines and started with PHP coding. By now students finished
the "Hello world".while srini made a demo on making a form with few
variables.

Mr.R.Subramanium joined the party around 3:00pm.R.S added feather to the
hat.
He started the talk with the need of "Tech Knowledge", "Inter personal
interaction","G.k" ,"Common sense" and "personality". He addressed the need
of presenting a  content rich biodata with some correction to a sample
resume got from one of the aspirant.

In between Luggies, Raja Talks on web technologies  by tommorrow 10:00 am to
1:00 pm. All of the luggies are invited. We are going to have the php
hands-on on 3rd sept  by 2:00 pm to 5:00pm .The resumes which are fetched
from the session attendes , can it be kept in our site www.chennailug.org
for any job prospects?.

This day is an excellent day with satisfaction to cheer about.

Regards

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

I for one disagree with that. I learnt most of my programming under DOS and 
then with Linux, but I was able to get into both VC++ and VC# with very 
little effort. As long as you keep in mind that it's just a toolkit and a 
different compiler, you're fine.

Anyway, we have Qt and GTK for windows, which are both much nicer than MFC, 
and .Net's toolkit is quite good (and self-explanatory) too. I don't see much 
of a problem in learning to program under one OS or the other, except maybe 
some details with the IDE's UI. Even that's easy to get around...

Can you tell me ONE company in India or elsewhere that employs a
person SOLELY on the basis of what he/she learnt in his/her < 10th "IT
@school" class?

I think people here are assuming this IT @school to be something that
teaches kids programming, web development, what not. It is not. It is
just a few fundamentals of computers - check, for example, one
question paraphrased from last year's (2006) public examination:

- Create a new document. Save it with a given name in a location specified.
- Enter some text into the document. Run the spellchecker.
- Mark certain sections of this text in bold, some other sections in italics
- etc...

I really don't understand what the hullabaloo is if the government
decides that the kids can do all this very well in OO.o on Linux. How
does this make the kid unemployable?

In my mind, the computers in schools for sub-tenth kids serve a
similar function as the "instrument box" or graph paper - it is just a
tool to teach the kids the basic principles - foundation stones for
his/her higher education, the real education that prepares him/her for
professional life. Does the fact that a kid uses a particular brand of
instrument box improve his understanding of the concepts behind
"bisect an angle using a straight-edge and compass"? It doesn't.
Similarly, it doesn't really matter to the kid or the school whether
he used Firefox or IE to look up a piece of information on Wikipedia -
what matters is that the kid has access to Wikipedia from his/her
school. The goverment(s) of Kerala needs to be lauded for initiating
an IT @school project - and while doing that, if they went for cutting
costs by choosing Free Software instead of expensive commercial
alternatives, then so be it.

Hi guys,

I'm going to buy a 64 bit PC. I've Ubuntu 6.06 64 bit OS with me.
Is it wise to run 64 bit OS on 64 bit PC. I read in an article that 64 bit
Drivers are scanty and are hard to find. Even giants like Logitech and
Creative are not providing 64bit driver.

Next, is it possible to run a 32 bit OS on this 64 bit PC.
Finally, recommend me between AMD 64 and Intel Dual Core.

Real credit goes to FSF-India and Space-Kerala. They took all pain
creating a customised distro and adding all necessary s/w for school
children. Now they are trying to promote Free Software for Kerala
Development.

Hi,

I would like to know as to how one should add events

I am not able to find the list of previous events that
were conducted in 2005, 2006. Is there a backup
somewhere?

Thanks,

Before installing a 64 bit OS make sure all the application you need
(eg. OO, java, flash, ...) are available as 64 bit ports otherwise you
have extra work to make them work.
There shouldn't be problem with the opensource drivers - mainly the
one already in the kernel tree, but you can expect some problems in
finding closed source drivers.

> Next, is it possible to run a 32 bit OS on this 64 bit PC.

Ofcourse it is possible. it is even possible to run a 32 bit
application in a 64 bit OS.

> Finally, recommend me between AMD 64 and Intel Dual Core.

If my understanding is right, Dual core should offer a better performance.

hi,
check out the doc related to the events.
http://civicspacelabs.org/home/node/11487

also, i have not updated the old data. since the wiki got more spammed
data, i got to clean up and get it up and running.

more over i tried to upgrade to new wiki. but it seems the server
didnt support because of php version conflict.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_POSIX_Thread_Library
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinuxThreads

And this:
http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-threading.html?ca=dgr-lnxw07LinuxThreadsAndNPTL

Just use any version of the 2.6.X kernel and you should be safe w.r.t threading.

Also, consider using Google and Wikipedia before asking questions on
the list. Most of the answers you seek are available on
Google/Wikipedia.

I  was running 64bit fedora in my box. I really had a tough time setting
up 64 bit firefox because there is no 64 bit JVM. so I could not visit
any site that needed java.

Hello friends,

We have started the session exactly (Laser sharp ;) ) by 10am this morning.
Raja gave his lecture, and we have collecte 10 biodatas. Can we keep such
biodatas who are looking for floss based employment in www.chennailug.org ?.
The session went on with scripting languages , intro to perl , why perl. As
usual it was  fabulous. Bala Vignesh took the practical with php mysql intro
code. Anto added flavour,  we finished by 1:30 , had lunch and splitted.

Cheers

Thyagarajan.

my suggestion is that we should not make chennailug.org as job site
where luggers keep their biodata. instead, we have job postings so
that luggers will be benefited.

1. events conducted by chennai luggers
2. LDD info
3. Open source participations list

and much more of community oriented ...

Thanks.
 
It mentions an option "Create Event". But, in our site
I see only two options for creating content:

# personal blog entry
# story

Can you add this "Create Event" option too?

My ideas, we can have something like this..

* Past events by ilugc - under the categories of LDDs, GLVs, Intro talks 
and topic specific seminars. GLV list might be linked to appropriate 
additional resources if possible the slides and materials used by the 
speaker for the same
* Forthcoming events - events which have been fixed and going to take 
place in the near future.
* Proposed events which are under planning and discussion.
* Speakers Info, who can talk on what ?
* Physical Volunteers list, a list of luggies who are/will be able to 
volunteer physically for ilugc events ;)

And also, a special this weekend banner or a sticky somewhere will help 
to find out whats happening the coming weekend, either LDD, GLV or some 
other meets.

Instead of using the chennailug.org for posting resumes, it would be a 
better idea to open up a google-group and use it for the purpose. The 
link for the same can be given in our chennailug.org site instead of 
using our site for such purposes. If you start putting resumes on our 
site, hundreds of resumes will come and we will rather become an 
employment portal than a LUG :D

Note: The above statement is my humble opinion, there is every 
possibility that this might lead to arguments, counter-arguments and 
flames... am a bit afraid of fire! ;)

   We have started conducting computer awareness programme in the following
   schools,
   1. Government High School, Thitamplayam, Mahadanapuram.
   2. Government High School, Mettumahadanapuram, Mahadanapuram
   3. Government Higher Secondary School, Sithalavai, Karur District
   4. Government Higher Secondary School, Lalapet, Karur District.
   .. We are having discussion with more schools.
   At the same time we are having discussion with Colleges to form Computer
   Literary Association and to conduct a group discussion about "Importance
   of Software Freedom".
   We have planned to put banner in all the places in tamil. Sample banner is
   posted in the following link

   Hai All,
   Regarding job postings, companies are expecting persons with good skills.
   The Subject of arguments started with the resume we got  through
   SESSION ON EMPLOYMENT EMPOWERMENT INIT INDUSTRY THROUGH FLOSS
   Instead of planning for posting resumes and handling. We can post articles
   (discussion) related to the expectation of companies with FLOSS
   background. A team list who are interested to guide for beginners can be
   formed.
   This will help the freshers to understand the area and get into a right
   job.

Surprising and really appreciable effort. If you wish some one from 
ilugc (Chennai members) can join with you, so we get acquainted with 
contacts around Trichy for planning further endeavors ?!

My ideas,

* Distribute Edubuntu CDS a few per school and show the students how to 
play around. This will create interests in them to start innovative 
learning.
* Teach them how to install and use GNU/Linux for their day to day 
activities, and help them adopt GNU/Linux into their lives.
* Get to know real-time needs of softwares which can be taken up as a 
project by students and developed as a FOSS solution. Thus, students 
will get a chance to work on something useful and applicable in real 
life and also, the need for a free software solution gets fulfilled.
* Try to avoid anti-XYZ propaganda, but stick to creating awareness 
about FLOSS. Generally, people presume that we are against something 
instead of understanding that we are showing them a better and parallel 
solution.

  Big things start small. Its not how you start that determines the end 
result, its how you perform, how you transform your ideas into action. 
Hope you do put up a good show :) Good Luck!!

nice.. especially so because my parents are basically from the vallioor
/ kallidaikurichi / kalakkad region, and we have some relatives (my
uncle's parents) living there.

it is good to see remote villages in south TN getting to know about and
use FLOSS.

IMHO, FLOSS should be <em>just considered</em> as another technology or 
opportunity for employment. It should be something similar to "I learn 
Java/.NET/ASP, I get a decent Job". I still remember a few years back, 
when I was at my high school, a lot of people rushed towards Oracle, 
then sometime later towards Java, then towards .NET. This shouldn't be a 
trend repeating with Open Source.

Students/Freshers should not just take up a career in Open Source just 
because they get a Job. I don't mean that "Job" is not a/the way to get 
people into FOSS, but it shouldn't be the foremost reason. They should 
understand and appreciate the philosophies and ideologies of FLOSS and 
then make a decision whether it is good for them.

Thus emphasis should be on letting them be aware of FLOSS, know at least 
a few of the nook-and-corners and then let them decide what they are 
going to pursue depending upon their interest.

Hi all,

I have some problem with dovecot in RHEL4.
IMAP server is dropping connection after woorking for some time.

 Indeed. All students in -schools- are going to use the skills they 
  learnt in schools (< 10th) when they go out looking for jobs. 
 
 What you learn in schools is your foundation for higher education. It 
 is the path, not the destination.
 --------
 Precisely. to the extent that, i still use a "i" as the index variable in a for loop. that tells us something else. 
 
 Why is linux considered not-so-user-friendly? One argument is that people started seeing windows on their machines and then came linux. Windows set the path. for some of us, the destination tends to linux. for most of others, their work will be on windows. I am confident that most corporates won't shift already to linux. So, they better know where the start button is or what File->save can do for them! Or the path to destination could just be frustration. Actually, there must be a mix of both. They shouldn't neglect any. Isn't that how we study. I did some "biology" in school, then that was never any destination for me!!

Dear Luggies,
On 3rd Sep 06, NRCFOSS has arranged for a Seminar on FOSS to
M.Sc-bioinformatics students. Me and Parthan conducted which covered
installation, basic gui, some intro to command line,shell script and
perl.

The students were enthusiastic. This is the first college (in my
experience), where faculty sat through entire day and actively
participated.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank College Management,HOD Dr.Ordetta and
faculty and NRCFOSS for the opportunity.

Raman.P

Hi murugan,

The default web server comes with redhat 9 does not support JSP. You
need to install apache tomcat for running servlets and JSP.

apache webserver dont have a servlet/JSP engine to parse the jsp files.
You need to install a servlet/JSP container like Apache Tomcat to run
java/jsp files.

@ Toufeeq,
Thanks dude, I was about to send the link to the Mailing list, got a 
call and in-between you did what I wanted to.

Yup it was a great day. Satisfied, on the way they responded, their 
interest in knowing things and especially they said they will install 
GNU/Linux in their homes too and learn things :) Have never seen staff 
sitting along with the students, interacting with us just like on 
amongst the students and giving equal importance to support staffs like 
admins and even motivating them to learn more and implement them.

I hope i ever get a chance to work on such a computer they had :p ;)

hi,

The Live disk is not for general use, however. There is no password protection for any system functions. So with the Live disk running, you can do anything, up to and including a full disk format. Ubuntu Live makes an excellent introduction, and is a very useful disk to have around if you want to use Linux on an unfamiliar machine (as long as the owner trusts you).

Unlike all the other Linux distros we have tried, Ubuntu does not ask you to set a root password during the install process. It actually, we are told, sets up a root user with a random password, that's never intended to be used. It then lets the first user have admin privileges, prompting for the password and performing actions through sudo ('superuser do') a Linux feature by which users can be allowed to operate with root privileges.

for example if you are goint to mount some partation.
simply type in sudo before the command such as sudo mount...

or do it this way:

$ sudo su

ten you'll be getting root previlagies. 

With Regards,
Sankar.K

In order to login as root inside a Ubuntu system you can change the
password of the root user by following steps:
1) Login as the first user you have created during installation
2) Issue the following command
    $ sudo passwd su
3) Enter a new password for the root user
4) Logout
5) Login as root with the password you have just changed

in that connection, few weeks ago, i volunteered to prepare a 20 -25 slide

Subject: [Ilugc] Regarding Installation of Linux 
Message-ID: <44fc0c76.359c112d.013f.5ca4@mx.gmail.com>

Dear Luggies,

I am trying to install linux in a machine which has the following
configuration:

Pentium 4 3.06 Ghz 

512 Mb Ram

80 Gb Sata Hard disk

ATI RADEON XPRESS 200 Display Adapter.

When I try installing FC 5 on this machine the screen gets filled up
with colour grains. This happens when the graphical interface for the
installation starts.

I tried installing Red Hat 9 it gave a message saying no hard drives
found in the machine.

What could be the problem

Thanks and Regards

Try ctrl alt + or ctrl alt - to switch between different mode.

You need a 2.6 kernel to detect your _SATA_ hard disk.

Dear Vinayak,
  What are the conf for the xorg conf file? The video card can best be changed, see http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=480441 for a similar bad experience with this card. You can also follow this thread to see if it gets resolved, it already did partially by getting up a 2d display rather than a 3-d.So, you can install perhaps in text mode and then edit the x conf.
  Reg hard drives not found , maybe you had it searching for IDE HDD instead of SATA. Also , further you can try reformatting from the end of free space rather than the start of free space, sometimes that may sort out HDD install troubles.
  Warm Regards

Dear Vinayak,
  The Red Hat 9 will not detect if the bios has your drive as SATA- raid , which is probably the case. Can't you try RHE instead or I generally use slackware, with wchich I usually have no probs ata all. Sorry for the incorrect input last mail.

  The slackware 10.2 distro comes default with kernel version 2.4.31, and it detects SATA HDDs fine.

You need a Java Web Application Server.
The most favourite ones in the opensource market are
1. Apache TomCat (http://tomcat.apache.org/)
2. JBOSS (jboss.org)
3. IBM WebSphere WebAppilcation Server Community Edition
(http://sourceforge.net/powerbar/websphere/ind/)

If you have a lot of $$$, u can choose IBM WebSpehre (Advanced

A more recent effort. IBM essentially added some bells and whistles to 
the open source Geronimo project. Haven't tried this one.

Unless you have really sophisticated needs like supporting thousands of 
users, load balancing and need professional support, don't go there. 
However, there are some really nice open source java app servers apart 
from Tomcat like Caucho Resin, JOnAS. You can't go wrong with Tomcat, 
but you can take a look at these options too.

I have seen an implementation supporting about a lakh users, atleast a
few thousand concurrently online, using TOMCAT :-). You can ofcourse
keep adding plugins and external load balancers and take care of
things yourself, and use it to handle such huge stuffs..... But no
EJBs on Tomcat......

If you are on a learning spree... Go For TOMCAT. This is the reference
implementation for all other servers in the market, meaning, if it
works on TOMCAT, it has to work on all other servers.

Huh? Rational Rose is a UML design/code generation tool. Sure, it costs 
a lot, but it's got nothing to do with app servers.

Now-a-days, IBM has integrated Rational Suite with Eclipse and has
made a RAD tool. You can draw the UML, generate the code, create
sequence diagrams by running the code, integrate with WebSphere,
profile the code, and so on..... But still Rational is not a server,
it is only a UML/RAD tool. (and a good one too.)

Dear Luggies

I am planning to move my company's email server from a windows-based one to
a linux-based one. I have used linux on a desktop but not as a server. Is
there any guide available which will take me through this process. The email
server should serve the following options

1) It should be able to send and receive mail to and from my isp
2) I should be able to ensure that certain email account should not be able
to send the mail to the outside world.


Thanks and Regards
Vinayak

set up a debian server with courier imap+postfix. Should do the job.  
Docs are very good and most of the setup is automatic. Mail the list  
if you have difficulty.

In the last month's LUG meet it was proposed to prepare a 20 - 25 slides
presentation
about the objectives of celebration the Sotware Freedom Day. (for educating
new comers/ students )

Barathi was asking for some one to take up the task.
I volunteered.

I am half way thro.
I need some digital pictures / some participation & discussions.
We hardly have a week to finish.

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0609050912n1af12874pa3864e9f7d4a106d@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

Today, I tried Huawei relience card with Opensuse 10.1
at asan(saravanan)'s laptop.

Accedently got this link,
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ilug-mangalore/message/3115

I followed it.
But there is no pppconfig.
Kppp also died.

So, tried with wv-dial.
Wow. It worked well.
(Hope sudharsan will glad to hear this  :-)

I think, identifying the device name for the card
is the major problem.

I watchd the /var/log/messeges while repluging the card.
It took at /dev/ttyUSB0.
giving that, it worked well.

I did not tried with ubuntu.
Hope it also easy.

Thanks for ilugc-mangalore keegan.

T.Shrinivasan.

You need the usbserial.ko Linux module for the above.

Actually I think it is the

"stupid mode = 1"

that you have to enable in wvdial.conf to say "dont worry, the
connection is up, start pppd anyway"

as well .. Same headache with tata indicom phones.

Anybody know what the equivalent to that is in pppconfig?

Message-ID: <72288b670609060519h3a923184v1aeb14ad11ee629c@mail.gmail.com>

I have installed Kubuntu Dapper Drake.
The first day I configured my Internet connections and it worked very well.
Also my USB pen drive worked automatically as I plugged it in. But neither
works anymore. I've tried even reinstalling, in vain.
Can someone tell me what could've gone wrong?

My specs:
AMD Ahtlon 3000+ (64 bit)
ASUS M8V-AX mobo with built in VIA compatible Fast Ethernet Adapter
(I am using DataOne)

Thanks

Tell us what error/output message you got when you
tried connecting to the Internet or when using the USB
pen drive.

After connecting the USB pen drive. open a terminal
and post output of:

  /bin/dmesg | tail
  /bin/lsmod
  /usr/bin/lsusb

Note, you can redirect output to a file:

  /bin/lsmod > lsmod.txt

It is very _bad_ to reinstall *nix. You always fix the
problem/issue.

Message-ID: <92f9a9560609061406n2ae616d3l5ec841b99155ff1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I want to relay email from my home FreeBSD 6.1 box running
sendmail by using gmail as the smarthost.  I've been pampered
by Debian's eximconfig for too long and I am lost with my
freebsd.mc.

I've added the following in my freebsd.mc file:

define(`SMART_HOST',`smtp.gmail.com')dnl
define(`confAUTH_MECHANISMS', `EXTERNAL GSSAPI DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5
LOGIN PLAIN')dnl
define(`RELAY_MAILER',`esmtp')dnl
define(`RELAY_MAILER_ARGS', `TPC $h 587')dnl
FEATURE(`authinfo',`hash /etc/mail/auth/client-info')dnl

My /etc/mail/auth/client-info looks like this:
AuthInfo:smtp.gmail.com "U:root" "I:rajasuperman@gmail.com" "P:<password>"

I rebuilt the sendmail with "make" and "make restart" to
restart sendmail.  When I send a test email to
rajasuperman@gmail.com, the following error appears in
/var/log/maillog and message delivery is deferred.

Note: I don't have any dns problems on the box, and it
has perfect access to the internet.  Interestingly, any
email I send to remote domains through the smarthost always
fails with a host name lookup failure.  Local delivery is
fine.

Can someone please hit me with a clue stick?  Thanks in
advance for any help or suggestions.

Doesn't gmail use TLS for smtp? This one is for postfix, but it should 
give you some idea:

smtp.gmail.com is a CNAME to gmail-smtp.l.google.com

Sendmail might not like your setting a cname there in the smarthost

Try changing smtp.gmail.com to gmail-smtp.l.google.com or do something
like [smtp.gmail.com] - note the square brackets - instead of just
smtp.gmail.com [dont attempt to resolve that hostname further and follow
things on - just connect to "smtp.gmail.com" and push email out]

I want to mount a usb disk in RHEL 3 v2.4.21-32.ELsmp,
but immediatly when I insert the USB disk, I am
getting the following error in /var/log/message

devlabel: The device /dev/sda1 is being put in
devlabel's temporary ignor list
/etc/sysconfig/devlabel.d/ignore_list to avoid errors.

Even after this error I am able to mount the disk, but
am not able to unmount the disk.

What is the problem and how to rectify it.

Hi All;
I have a 160GB external hard disk formatted as a fat filesystem. If i
connect it and use it in windows, i get a free space of 70GB,
However, if i connect it to linux (Suse 10.0) df -H shows a free
space of only 541MB. If i do du -sh on the mount point of the hard
disk, it shows only 90GB usage. I am not able to write any file of
size > 541MB. I even tried defragmenting the drive from windows to of
no use.
Has anyone faced this problem before ? Any pointers on how to solve
this issue would be of help
Thanks
K.Shyam

Message-ID: <e977d4310609062153n3ecf5f29xe63b04345d955970@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have finished migrating from SuSE 10.0 (LFY Nov 05) to Kubuntu
Dapper (I downloaded the DVD version) just now. I am a KDE Fan
(particularly because of KMail, KStars and the KDE Games for my
parents)

Its good that Kubuntu supports Unicode Tamil out of the box. But I
have to re-compile Firefox (I dont have the patience).

Meanwhile I had been trying to read Dinamalar, Dailythanthi and other
tamil news websites. I downloaded the TTF Fonts and installed them
using the Graphical tool in SU mode. I had tried the same in the
earlier versions of Linux that I had used before(SuSE, Mandrake 10,
Fedora 3, etc..). But I have never been successfully read the said
news papers online on Linux. Has anyone done this before? Any
pointers?

Regards,
Natarajan.

Message-ID: <139e14f00609062231q607ddcf6s6c9d71028142da82@mail.gmail.com>

When a new model of laptop with latest devices come out it is another battle
for the open source community to get them working with linux distributions.

It is a joy when Ubuntu 6 detects the sound card and stars playing sounds
without having to spend hours.

It is nice to see a few lines of script on the web to enable Tata Indicom
Data Card and connect to internet wirelessly in Ubuntu.

Now more good news.

[Portable personal computers target the movie mad] (
http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/06/stories/2006090603721400.htm) talks about
"one of the first portable machines that comes with a built-in TV tuner.
This means one can attach it to a TV antenna or cable connector to see all
the usual television feeds."

"And you don't have to boot the PC's Windows software to use it as a TV or a
DVD player: these controls are available separately with start, stop, fast
forward and rewind controls, much like a stand-alone video player."

"the Lenovo 3000 series offers a ``One Key'' recovery utility to restore the
laptop's last working condition in case of disk crash ? and this is based on
a Linux tool, not the machines Windows operating system."

"PowerCinema too is being offered by its makers in a Linux version ? and
this opens up the interesting possibility that TV-laptops can be made even
more affordable in the future by going Open Source all the way."

The march of open source power is finally arriving in India brought by
commercial players. Interesting times ahead!

Hi,
There will be no lettering or label for the new partition of vfat you
created under GNU/Linux. You have to create a Lettering for that
partition. You can do that through MMC (Microsoft Management Console).

NOTE: I guess this will work. never tried.

Looks like you got confused with 'trac environment'

After 'trac' is installed., you can create multiple instances of 'trac'
for your different projects (collections). So., the 'trac environment'
is one such instance. So., for a project 'foo'., i'd probably create a
'trac environment' as.,

$trac-admin /home/joe/projects/foo initenv

Now., the folder 'foo' should not exist. The 'trac-admin' utility will
create the folder and put the respective files for serving the wiki,
ticket-tracker, etc.., into the /home/joe/projects/foo folder. You can
serve this folder over HTTP using apache or the inbuilt HTTP server that
comes with trac.

Trac will refuse to create an environment in an existing directory to
avoid accidental over-writing of project information.

No.. when we try to assign label, it shows only Delete partition option, but
it
recognized it as FAT32 partition.

Did you create a vfat filesystem on the partition (/sbin/mkfs.vfat) or
did you just assign it the vfat code in fdisk?

Fat32? How did you format it
(fdisk/cfdisk/gparted/qtparted/..) ?

> Has anyone faced this problem before? 

I use an external USB hard-disk, formatted with fdisk
with type 0xb, and it works fine with Debian/Ubuntu
systems.

An external USB connect hard-disk with *nix
filesystems will be detected as /dev/sda with udev in
recent distros. They will automount for you.

Hi All;
Well problem solved. Seems that it had some free cluster issues.
I did a "fsck.vfat -vVa /dev/sda1" and it is now reporting the
correct free space and i am also able to write files properly.
The hard disk is of make "crossfire" and windoze was used to create
the vfat(fat32) partition initially.
Thanks to all for your inputs/suggestions
K.Shyam

Let me get it clear to you all. By default, in M$ windows, every
partition is assigned a drive letter like C:, D:. When we create a
vfat partition under GNU/Linux, it will not be visible in windows
under a drive letter. Thats what i refered with lettering. You need to
assign a letter for that partition using MMC.

Have you really used the remaining 90 GB ( ie 160 - 70) for storage ?, may
be  FAT would have got corrupted with orphan links .

I formatted with /sbin/mkfs.vfat
Window$ is not allowing to create label
The only two enabled option on right click the formatted partition is
"Delete partition" and  "Help".

Sorry for mixed posts..

Formatted a partition (just for testing I used 500MB)  in linux with
mkfs.vfat
After booted in windows,  I tried to give a label to that partition through
Windows Administrative tools->storage.
It showed the500MB partition as FAT32 but on right clicking the partition,
the options as "Delete partition" and "Help" are enabled. So I am not able
to
assign any drive letter to that partition.

   Can someone tell me how to configure *Hathway* *Broadband* *Internet* on *Linux*.

   The *Hathway* guys have given me a static IP, DNS and Gateway. 

   I tried configuring the LAN(Ethernet) for this purpose and started network 
   again but it doesnot work. 

   I tried configuring DSL Modem as well but that also does not work

   Kindly help me out please.

   If someone could give me the exact shell commands it would be really
   helpful. Kindly help!!!!!!!!!!

   Thanks in Advance

   Dinesh Rao P

Shouldn't you be exuberant that inspite of you not
being able to make it, you are making an effort to
introduce Free/Libre/Open Source Software to
Bioinformatics students in Karpagam Arts and Science
College, Coimbatore, who have no idea about FLOSS, or
FLOSS in bioinformatics, and how they can
benefit/learn from it?

Subject: [Ilugc] GNU/Linux Club in Layola
Message-ID: <45002E07.1020309@gmail.com>

Hello LUGies,

Mr. Srinivasan of NRCFOSS and Myself made a trip to Layola college today 
and had a small interactive session with students of MCA dept. (Computer 
Science Dept). The students as well as the HOD & Faculty are very much 
eager to take up FOSS activities and wish at least a few students could 
take up some really worthy projects in FOSS as they have a 6 month 
project period.

As SFD is very near, we suggested them to formally open up a 'GNU/Linux 
club' on the Software Freedom Day. The HOD said he will invite all other 
departments that are interested in FOSS, like Statistics, 
Bioinformatics, etc., to join this initiative. In addtion, as from 
NRCFOSS we are ready to offer projects for the students who are 
interested in doing. The SFD will be the starting point for them to 
focus on FOSS.

We, in regards to the SFD at Layola, need a speaker to speak on the 
occasion as they are starting up a GNU/Linux club on the day. Will 
discuss more about this, in our coming LUG meet this saturday at IITM.

If posible I invite the HOD, Dept. of Computer Science, Layola college 
to join us this saturday at our monthly LUG meet, held at IIT-Madras :)

What do you mean "does not work"?

How did you configure it? How did you test it to come
to the conclusion that it "does not work"?

Open a terminal and post output of:

  /sbin/lsmod
  /sbin/ifconfig -a
  cat /etc/resolv.conf
 
Note, you can redirect output to a file:

 /sbin/lsmod > lsmod.txt

These are useful for debugging. Please paste them
inline and send the e-mail (_not_ as attachments).

I would like to volunteer as a speaker for a one-day
or half-day workshop for Loyola College, Chennai, but,
I am not available on September 16.

I can do a follow-up session on a Saturday.

Yes. I have been using HAthway on GNU/Linux for the past 1.5 years at
Bangalore.
GUI (Ubuntu - GNOME):
Click on System -> Administration -> Networking
Type your Administrative password
Enable your ethx (should be 0)
Click on properties and Select Static IP (default would be DHCP)
Enter the IP address that was given
Leave the default subnet mask
Enter the gateway adresss

Go to the DNS Tab and enter the two DNS address they gave.
Put your Default interface to eth0

Click OK. You will be up online

CLI:
Use ifconfig command to set your IP
Edit /etc/resolv.conf to give you DNS address (must be Administrator)

Thanks Shakthi. Sure, you are amongst the people who had to really speak 
to the students :) Will fix up your day once SFD gets over and they have 
a active GNU/Linux club to take care of these activities :D

Thanks for the tip.

I turned out that I *was* having DNS problems.  My DSL router barfed
when trying to fetch MX records (dig -t mx gmail.com failed), but A
records were working perfectly.  That settled, my box is now happily
email me output from cron jobs.

My experience is chronicled at:

Hi,

I know, I know, this has been discussed ad nauseam, but can the list 
admin please turn on reply-to munging (I'm not exactly sure who it is, 
so this open request)? It's getting on my nerves to reply to the list. 
The whole world works one way and ILUGC mailing list works one way. I 
have to do a reply all, remove a ton of email addresses, change the 'cc' 
into a 'to' field for ilugc list id and then send it (in Thunderbird at 
least). Half the time, I just hit 'close' on a half-done reply thinking 
"gah. why bother?".

The other day, one more hold-out, the Erlang mailing list, started 
munging it's reply-to header. The list admin needed only two emails to 
convince him. Please, save our fingers.

Is it just me, or have every body inured themselves to this PITA?

If read through the archives, you'll find that I was *not* a part
of the original discussion.  I was just trying to save your fingers
by pointing out that the topic was already discussed in detail.

As for me, I too find the gmail reply-all, then delete to: and cc:,
and use only ilugc in to: a pain on my fingers.

It cannot be? Unless there is a damn good technical reason apart from 
that age-old url that everyone throws around whenever this comes up 
(apart from having an equally good article refuting that) I can't see a 
reason for inconveniencing everybody on the list on a daily basis for a 
very small chance that something might go wrong. Especially since even 
places like sf.net have changed their stance and are munging the 
reply-to header now.

Please post it inline when sending the e-mail (_not_

Similarily, when you try to unmount the device, get a

Yes, the disk write is cached. If you mount with -o
sync option then it is ensured that all disk writes
are written immediately.

i have raised this issue twice - the list admin has not even bothered  
to reply. And it is a pity because all longer threads break up and  
become private resulting in a great loss of knowledge to the  
community and duplication of efforts

Message-ID: <20060908072046.GA4453@localhost>

Dear ILUGC,

As many are already aware, IIT Madras' ftp.iitm.ac.in is a mirror for
quite a lot of free software. As of now, it is an "official" Debian
i386 repository mirror, and has the following:

* Debian repository
* CentOS repository
* Fedora Core updates
* Cygwin
* Red Hat 9 (required for legacy; some users can't do without it!)
* Linux kernel (This machine is actually http://www.in.kernel.org
  http://ftp.in.kernel.org)
* Slackware contents (without ISO, I guess)
* The Linux Documentation Project

and some more things. The site is administered by Dr.Sriram (Dept. of
Aerospace Engg., IIT Madras).

This morning, I had a chat with Dr.Sriram, and he made the following
comments:

* The server is used by people from all over the world.
* Cygwin is, by far, the top downloaded package.
* There is lots of bandwidth available for outgoing traffic, so the
  site is, essentially, very fast.
* There is about 200GB of space available, so we can put a lot more
  software for download there.

So, immediately suggested that he add the ISO images of Slackware
10.2, FreeBSD 6.1 and the latest Mandriva. I have also suggested that
he get hold of Fedora Core 6 when it is rolled out next month. He
accepted the suggestion, and said that he was open to more suggestions
on mirroring software, though he laid down the following conditions:

* Space, though available, must not be wasted. So, anything that is
  left untouched for about a month will be *removed*.

* Preference will be given to packages/software for x86 only. It is
  not worth the trouble of mirroring software for some architecture
  which may hardly be of use to the general users.

Keeping these in mind, please suggest some packages/distributions
which you think will be worth mirroring, and will be of use.

Also, please mention whether you want the ISO images of the CDs or
DVDs in case of distributions. Personally, I would vote for CDs, as I
do not possess a DVD writer, and because I generally don't get every
CD.

Awaiting your suggestions :-)

Thanks.

Kumar

How about a repository for ubuntu? That seems like the os of choice for
most desktop users and it'd be great to have a local repository.

Well, Kumar what else do you expect? 

I would suggest mirrorring FreeBSD,NetBSD and OpenBSD packages. :-)

There are a lot of embedded developers running debian on their
ppc,arm,mips hardware. I would suggest adding the main repositories of
these arch's to the ftp mirror. Atleast arm,mips could be considered.
PPC I've suggested for Apple guys (if any).

have you considered the possibility that the list admin may not read the list
postings on an hourly (or more frequent) basis? your present list admin (myself)
checks the postings for interesting threads maybe once in 2-3 days. of course,
the admin will respond to mails addressed to ilugc-owner in a shorter time
scale. ok, that brings up two things.

(1) the immediate issue is of munging or not munging reply-to headers. i will go
with whichever way the list wants it. perhaps, someone could set up a vote
somewhere for this? or is this something that is so obvious today that we dont
need to do this? 

(2) list adminship is open to anyone interested in taking it on (perhaps, there
might be preference for someone who checks for new postings once every minute).
i did start on this some time ago, but did not follow up.

Mirroring a years old end of life distribution is rather unnecessary 
IMO. It encourages use of software with known security vulnerabilities.

since the only call for admin in the last year has been booting  
spammers - i think about 5 a year, 2-3 days is ok and i think  
everyone is happy with that. This is the only issue where you had not  
responded - maybe you missed out on the previous threads

no need for a vote - i am a member of around 20 lists, and only one  
of them (apart from this) still does this

cant we have multiple list admins? three or four seniors like raman,

i guess the present settings is far good enough.
also take a look at the url http://www.unicom.com/pw/reply-to-harmful.html

my suggestion is the user should never be restricted. its user wish
whether he wants to send the reply to list back or to the individual.
either u can use reply | reply to all option in most of the mail
clients (both desktop and web based).

please dont try to control the user. give user the flexibility and let
him decide.

I do not check mail once a minute, but I think I can manage :-)

Please list your expectations from the moderator. If it is to attend
to some mail which needs to be approved/rejected etc. and some similar
tasks, I would like to volunteer for this.

Thank you.

Senior? ILUGC is 7 years old, and, I only joined here
in 2004 :)

I currently don't have the time to handle this work.
Thank you for the recommendation.

It would be better for someone in IIT-M to handle
this, like Ramkumar or Kumar Appaiah, or any other as
they can move around within IIT-M, and get access to
the resources when needed.

Regards,

SK

seniority in lugs is measured by activity - and i have made a big  
mistake by mentioning only three when there are about 15-20 (which is  
why i said 'like')

Thanks for responding - and I apologize if I sounded harsh in my first 
mail - this issue went nowhere the last few times it was brought up, so 
my temporary bout of frustration. Coming to the munging, this has 
already been discussed and before most people who spoke up seem to be in 
favor of it. So I guess another round of voting would be moot.

note that the original posting said 'for legacy users'. there are legacy
machines that dont need updates and work quite well with end of life
distributions. i have a couple of machines in my lab which run redhat 7.2
and there is no need for me to update them (of course, updating to any
current distro would probably fail due to hardware requirements). they are
on isolated intranets and security is not a major issue. the image
processing software on them works just like it did years ago and will
continue to be used for some more years. why would i update these? in case 
something conks out, i will try to restore it to exactly the same distro 
and software instead of trying to migrate to new distros. and thats what 
legacy support is all about. there are others on campus like this. not to 
sound mean, but ftp.iitm.ac.in is primarily meant for iitm users - but 
since we have the bandwdith to spare, we dont mind sharing the contents 
with others.

If the user has subscribed to a public mailing list, then why not let the
responses be posted to the list? If you click reply all, then you are
sending the OP two emails. And i've seen many people using a signature:
``Dont send me a cc. I read the list''

Thanks for recommending me. As with Kumar, I would like to know what
the responsibilities of the list admin are, before putting forth my
application. I have been running short of time lately... No probs, if
the work is purely online...

it moves on...

PS: Apologies to Kenneth and Roshan for not conducting the Elisp meet
by August end... hopefully I would find some time soon...

The utility of a mirror depends primarily on the access speed to
end users.  I tried ftp.iitm.ac.in ~3 years ago and found it slower
than mirror.aarnet.edu.au.  I'm was and still am using an Airtel
DSL connection from Chennai.  Has connectivity/bandwidth improved

Yes. Recently, there have been major infrastructure upgrades in IITM,
which have brought a perceptible speedup to IITM sites/server. Also,
usage statistics (available only in campus) indicate that
international traffic is more than Indian traffic. So, it should now
be a better choice as a mirror (I think).

Due to poor peering practices, till about a few years ago, a Sify DSL
user would go all the way to the US and return to India to access a
colocated server in VSNL. This could have led to the general
perception that Indian servers are slower to access than their foreign
counterparts. With improved co-operation between ISPs, I do think this
is no longer the case (check http://www.nixi.org/, for example).

IMHO, by munging a 'reply-to' header, I don't think the freedom of the 
user to decide where his reply is sent to will be controlled anyway. In 
a mailing list, the default procedure is mailing your replies back to 
the mailing list so it gets distributed to everyone. So, making the 
'reply-to' field to point to the mailing list's is not a wrong idea, it 
indeed is the best thing to do.

Also, we have seen many time in the past that instead of sending back 
the reply to the mailing list, replies had been sent to the individuals. 
This is especially true in cases when the thread grows and more people 
start multi-quoting one another that eventually we miss who-said-what 
and start replying to in-appropriate people instead of mailing to the 
person whom we are actually replying in regards with. To prevent such 
issues as well as prevent the drive to send personal mails flaming 
people for their comments, we can have a reply-to field point to the 
mailing-list id, so by default the mails indeed reach the mailing list 
rather than individuals.

Even when I started with this mail, I had to manually remove the 
individual mail id and replace it with the mailing-list's id. Rather 
than calling it pain in the fingers I would like to call it an overhead, 
which indeed as  someone in the beginning said, de-motivates us from 
completing the reply which we had actually intended to... especially 
when more individuals were addressed in the previous mail and thus reply 
to or reply-all both adds extra work to change the to: field.

++1 voting for reply-to munging :)

++1 to set set the reply-to header to the list address. Many new
user's are not aware of clicking on "Reply-To-All" and just do a
reply. This will ensure that new user's don't endup sending a
personal-mail to other members on the list.

Thanks for making this process trully democratic. :)

Every time this topic comes up, this very antediluvian opinion piece
is thrown about as some sort of authoritative standard.

In any case, I used to have this procmail rule for ilugc (before
moving to gmail):

# ilugc doesn't have reply-to set to list. This is a workaround

While booting through CD, give ``linux26'' and press enter. 2.6 series
 kernel in Debian fully supports SATA disks.

It is neither recognizing as primary nor secondary. The hard disk is only
listed as sata port 1

That's decent amount of bandwidth. We had been planning to make public
our debian, ubuntu mirror at TIFR. But mere weekly rsync of the
archives are getting our sysadmins worried.

Bandwidth is still a luxury in India :)

Hi luggies ,
   i know thishas nothing to do with linux(forgive me for using this post) , 
but just a question out of curiosity.
when mails are sent using gmail , the x-originating ip is the ip address of 
google .Looks like its relaying the mails through its own server.I was just 
wondeirng if the original ip is encrypted and stored or not along with 
header.
Thanks for any reply in advance  :)
thanking you ,
Antano Solar

It is not. Google does not divulge the IP address of the sender.

There have been several skirmishes between Google and Spamhaus/Spamcop
because of this.

http://www.ironport.com/company/pp_marketwatch_03-27-2006.html

etc...

Personally speaking, I laud Google's position in this matter.

Hi,
Unikix is a software solution. Its not an OS. Its
purpose was to allow IBM Mainframe applications to be
run on Unix boxes. ( CICS applications or in other
words transaction oriented applications). CICS is IBM
technology for transactions.

Unikix was bought over later by Sun and renamed sun
mainframe rehosting solution and offered only for
solaris OS.

Hi all,
I have seen ads of all Desktop/Notebook manufacturers from Dell to
Leneova, which only recommends XP inspite of it being more vulnerable
to attacks. Why can't they recommend GNU/Linux  or BSD's which is more
stable and trouble free? Is that M$ is paying the manufacturers for
putting the caption
"XYZ recommends Windows XP"

Thanks a lot for helping me with all the advice. I managed to solve that
problem also. Now the only problem is that My company gives out two types
of  email ids for its employees. Some people can send mail to the external
world but some cannot. How do I write the poll line for guys who do not have
access to the outside world through their email.

This doesn't stop here, but Microsoft is much more bad than you might think.

IIRC if the manufacturer pre-installs any other OS alongside of Windows, 
only Windows should be bootable by default, the other OS should be 
bootable only by alternate means, say a  floppy or CD etc.

This approach is one of the primary reasons for the death of Be Inc and 
some others IMO.

I believe this cannot be prevented.

That is one of the conditions of Microsoft's OEM licensing - that all
promotional material (advertisements, brochures etc.) should include
the statement "Fubar recommends Microsoft Windows XP". For this, OEMs
get Windows XP at very cheap rates - $20 or so - as opposed to retail
selling price of $400.

Unfortunately this cant be stopped, but yes, if DELL,Compaq etc., are
provided with all the drivers and if GNU/Linux OS pass their End User
Testing (out of the box functionality), they will sure make it available.

Microsoft has a list of Hardwares and Devices which it says that Windows
"XXX" will work and passes this to all OEM Manufacturers. Since GNU/Linux is
not a single body as Microsoft, here you dont have a single body for this.
You may tell Community is there, but the OEM Manufacturers wont look for
answers, they will only get it from you.


The main problem what i feel makes the vendors neglect GNU/Linux is,
1) Lack of drivers
2) GNU Ethics (for example, the Multimedia and other Entertainment issues)

If GNU/Linux can pass these, I am sure, OEM Manufacturers will look into
shipping GNU/Linux with Laptops and Dekstops.

What do you mean "near future"? Does it mean immediate or few months
down the line? 

Today open source is critical for business. There are no two ways about
it. The benefit is not only in terms of cost but also in terms of
tweakability, customizing stuff to your needs etc. In fact many
companies add masala to open source code and provide timely support. And
the term open source has become so ubiquitous that you can easily
convince MBA guys that it can save money for you. 

First the global scenario. Then I will try to address the Indian
scenario. Let us take google for instance. Google used to run RedHat on
its server farm, I don't know what they are running now. Yahoo!,
Amazon,eBay everyone are out and out FreeBSD shops not to mention
hotmail which runs a combo. Juniper routers are all FreeBSD based. 

Let us come to the question of making money thro' Open Source?
Definitely possible. I will urge you to take a look at the damn
small linux homepage, there John has written a nice practical
article on how to make money via a "successful" open source product.
Mind you, damn small linux is damn successful , that is why he is
able to say this. So if you do a really good job and develop a world
#1 software which you make open source, you will definitely make money
down the line thro' ads(Google AdSense) and support and other sources.

Look at it this way  buddy. How do Suryan FM and Sun TV make money?
Do they charge for programming? No. They get huge Ad revenues. In
fact if Tamil had been as popular as Hindi, then Sun would have got
even more viewership, ad revenue and so on. Not to say that Sun
doesn't have enough money right now. :-)

Something similar applies to open source. However channels like Jaya
TV hardly have any revenue. So if you do manage to do something cool
and highly technically challenging; something that is novel and
useful. Then being open source, it spreads by word of mouth
marketing and few months down the line, as ppl download and find it
interesting, you will start getting hits on your website that
translate into revenue in various ways. 


One strategy that works somewhat well though I don't like it is you
make a program open source and then give a premium edition with
certain killer features. I personally hold it immoral and cruel to
do it, however you can try it. AFAIK not many ppl do this these
days.


Though I cannot substantiate my statements with facts these are my
general opinions and observations. Recent acquisition of snort by
Checkpoint is a case in point. All I am saying is if you do a good
job, money will come. :-)

Coming to the Indian scenario, I am also finding the answer to the
question you posed. I don't actually understand the question since
open source means available to all ppl at all parts of the world. So
if I understand correctly you are talking about such a thing working
in the Indian society/culture. I would say a fat chance. Bcoz Bram
Cohen was surviving on credit cards until he finished his bittorrent
program. U know how high expenses can be in US. And Linus Torvalds
wrote linux in a country like Finland where you have proper weather
only for two months in a year. Most of the time you won't even have
sunlight. Some ppl believe lack of sunlight can lead to depression.


In India we don't have these problems. The problems however are of a
different nature. Our society still considers entrepreneurship as
taboo. And being a developing nation we have 100s of small small
things to take care. You can never take anything for granted.
However things are lookup up very much these days and I am sure
things are only going to get better in the coming days.

We don't have proper academia/industry interaction largely bcoz our
industries don't even know the meaning of innovation and world
classness. IITM is the first institute as far as I know that has
shown that it is indeed possible to create real world biz solutions
from inside academic culture.


However open source is all about excellence and we have a very long
way to go before we can claim that. However as individuals you and
I can do  quite a lot,get the right ppl, do the right things etc.

I cannot tell you what you should do, but I certainly can tell you
what you should not do.

Don't get an army of programmers. Get a small cohesive set of hand
picked programmers.

Have an informal culture. Dont say, "come in formal dress." It
positively kills creativity. Ppl should feel as comfy at office as
they are at home. At the same time you should ensure professionalism
and make sure that work gets done. 

That is all from my side. 

Wait, I just noticed you mentioned the word "from scratch". I personally
dont like it. Do you mean reinventing the wheel? If you try that, then
other ppl will overtake you and you will be left in the lurch.

My God help you in your noble endeavors!

Best,
Girish

Is it really so. But, what about MySQL, IBM etc.... They have both
Premium edition and community edition.

That is well said. Even the same thought was going in on my mind.

"from scratch" here does not refer to the open source softwares. It
refers to my start-up ie. how to proceed.

First thing to do before starting a venture is decide what product or
service you wish to provide.  If you beleive that it is an irresistable
product/service every other question or problem will be too trivial to solve

Hi Aanjhan,

   I configured exactly  as you said but still I am not able to access 
Internet.
   I have entered the Static IP, Default Gateway, DNS servers all as root.
   I have edited the file /etc/resolv.conf and placed DNS address (as 
Administrator) as well.
   I tried to ping the dns addresses given it says destination unreachable.
   I have also enabled & disabled the network card eth0 and has 
restarted the network again but no effect.
   When I open up mozilla and type url as www.google.com and enter it 
does not show up.
   Do I need to do anything more.

   My Hathway setup works in Windows2000 very well.

Kindly help me. Thanks in advance.

Regards
Dinesh

Well, I think Postgres is several times better than MySQL. For small
sizes I hear MySQL outperforms Postgres but Postgres is really free.
And stable and scales well,blah blah. I am no DB guy, others shud
comment.

IBM? I wonder. I hear IBM does a lot of open source particularly Linux
work. How much do they give back? What do they sponsor? I really don't
know. I do know that FreeBSD does get commercial support from companies
that use it. For NetBSD too. I heard that Theo got pissed off with
Iraqi invasion and hence he lost a huge funding opportunity from US DoD.
But so far as my exp goes, OpenBSD is the sexiest thing since sliced
bread.

OpenBSD is a bad example. Since they have certain silly ideologies like
Debian. Doesn't work too well in the real world. As a result ppl exploit 
these ppl and kick them in the chest. U see what Ubuntu has done. Or
what companies that use OpenBSD software like OpenSSH have done. They
clearly mention in the home page that not a single company has repaid a
cent towards development. 

Welcome to the real world. This is how things work. If that is so in
cash rich US, forget such a thing happening in India. 

I still believe that with a lil bit of cleverness and ingenuity you can
avoid these problems. It is not just enough to be a good hacker. You
have to be a good businessman, entrepreneur and have a lil bit of
enterprising skills.

I heard an Indian Standford prof. say during the dot com days that we
Indians have a great deal of networking, entrepreneurial and
enterprising skills in our blood. I also have reason to believe that. 

However what we lack badly is team skills. We fall apart in no time. 
This has been the problem since time immemorial. We neither trust each
other nor do we behave in a manner worthy of trust. So finding the right
partner is not easy in the Indian context.

How Indian market sees open source? Indian market sees nothing. Its eyes
are blindfolded. Just kidding. :-)

I am more or less convinced that the only model that will work in the
Indian context is a hardware/software combo. Nobody will pay for
software. Tally is the only counter example. I think even open source
kills this. Only if you sell a cheap piece of hardware with your
superior software you can think of making money in the Indian market.

Others, plz plz correct me if I am wrong.

Largely for software and hardware dev there is no problem. However
buying a Soekris box or a Digium card is not something like I go to
Circuitcity or Walmart. 

Provided you procure the hardware you can do the rest pretty well since
you have plenty of mailing lists and other info on the Internet to help
you out. 

I am yet to figure out a hardware mailing list. I am sure there are
many. Chennai does seem to have very good hardware experts too.

> That is well said. Even the same thought was going in on my mind.
Actually  it is much deeper than what I can possibly express. Management
is an art, not a science. You can't say, follow these 10 commandments
and you succeed.

Fundamentally a leader needs a spirit of sacrifice. It is very
important. And strong business ethics. Mind you, biz ethics, not some
stupid ideology like I will not lie or steal or cheat. :-)

You should be loyal and kind and understanding towards your employees.
We see two extremes bet Blore and Chennai. Blore lets employees do
anything. And Chennai is too conservative.

And you should somehow solve the team work problem I mentioned above. It
is nearly impossible to make two smart ppl work in the same team in
India. I have seen that together they pull you down. Or waste time
fighting with each other.

Another thing I forgot to mention. The ppl who call the shots should be
top class. A grade. If you get B grade ppl to do the job, then they
reject smart ppl in the interview stage itself and you won't even know
that they are eating into your viscera.

So I guess if you get a team of 5 or 6 world class ppl who work
cohesively as a team, your job is done.

Takes a long time. Setting up your own shop is very very difficult.
Needs lot of patience, endurance, guts, determination etc.

Fundamentally you should love what you do. 

Otherwise you cannot survive. Period.

It is not moonshine and roses.

Hi,

Have a check at OpenBRR <http://www.openbrr.org/wiki/index.php/Home>

And also be clear whether to focus on OSS or FOSS :)

All the best :)

Courier-IMAP gets the path to the Home Directoy & Maildir from the
authentication module (from courier-authlib package) it uses.
Depending on the authentication module you want to use, then answer to
your question is slightly different. A thumb rule is that if the
authentication module does not specify a Maildir, then the Home
Directory is suffixed with the MAILDIRPATH variable from the imapd
config file (the auth module is required to provide a Home Directory).

So, in the simplest virtual hosting scenario with authuserdb, you'd
specify home=/home/Mails/whatever in the userdb entry for
user=whatever and MAILDIRPATH=Maildir in imapd to achieve what you
want to do.

And in a more complex scenario you'd use hashed maildir structures - the
simplest being /path/to/Mails/u/s/username etc, and some more hashing to
split users even further between maildirs, and across multiple
fileservers ..

Dont stick all the maildirs into a single directory. You will ultimately
run into issues with that.

Plz do check out the model used in Websphere, Eclipse and the alikes. There
is a community Edition, which is absolutely free. But, when it comes to the
various premium categories, they offer killer features like load balancing
servers, synchronizing between the servers, etc and deployment on clusters.

try to ping google or access any website from some other browser like
Konqueror(where IPv6 is not enabled default), or disable IPv6 in your
mozilla and see. May be if its a problem with IPv6, you may disable IPv6 in
your mozilla alone by setting network.dns.disableIPv6 to true, or else
disable it system wide by

echo "alias net-pf-10 off" >> /etc/modprobe.conf

and rebooting.

Thank You all for the suggetions.Let me try it and will get back with
the results.
I was also trying to change the courier IMAP to dovecot and was in
trouble.Dovecot drops connection very frequently(within 2/3 hrs) and i
rolled back to Courier.

Err.. They do a lot more looking around for Source code of Free and

Interesting "feeling". Lack of Drivers for what hardware?? Give me
some examples of hardware that *is* absolutely necessary for
functioning of a system with no "Free" Device Drivers for it.

Great going. But as far as I know for anything to catch Media
attention it should be a *gossip* ;-) or a personality or something
crazy happening around. One thing to catch the media attention without
actually inviting the folks would be dress like a Tux or a GNU and
stand in front of Spencer Plaza and give pamphlets and shake hands
with all the people who enter that day... <Idea hijacked from another
Free Software Users Group> Or may be dress like that and keep walking
on Pondy Bazaar or Mount Road wishing everyday 'Happy Software Freedom
Day' It will grab the attention of the onlookers and the MEDIA for
sure. and they will start writing about Free Software automatically.

Inviting Media has not worked till date. May be you can turn it
around. :-) Give her the chennailug.org website and you pick up the
best of the events conducted and let her know. To know more about SFD
its there on http://softwarefreedomday.org/

not really , we dont have to dress up like tux to catch attention , the very 
fact that lug does social service and helps educating masses and that most 
proffessionals inspite thier tight shedule contribute to the community for 
no returns is something very interesting and to be highly appreciated and 
its this very fact that has catched thier attention .If I, only a person 
active for say one month can say so much abt lug , i am sure that there are 
many of you who can give more specific details to let the city know whats 
happening in thier habitat .The expected outcome is obvious , more awareness 
, more chances of ppl who need help approaching us , and a better reason and 
awareness of prospective members to share the responsibilities of lug :) And 
since the events which have already passed are not there in chennailug.org , 
the mailing is the only source i can turn to for more details.

Hi,

ANSI/ISO c standard libraries don't have the capability but the
gettimeofday function defined in <sys/time.h> (POSIX 1003.1-2001)
can help you out.

/******************************************/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/time.h>

int main()
{			
	struct timeval tv;
	gettimeofday(&tv,NULL);
	printf("%d Seconds and %d microseconds have elapsed since the
epoch\n",(int)tv.tv_sec,(int)tv.tv_usec);
	return(0);
}

/******************************************/

lookup 'man gettimeofday' for more details.

Hi Dinesh and friends,

The hathway team is a tragic team in providing linux based  internet
solutions. The big nonsense of their service is thier archeitecture they do
not have a dhcpd server running under their service. Hathway boys are using
windows based machine for NAT and all netty jargons.
Their way works like this , The machine needs a connection to internet has
to bind the network mac address and one has to configure the
pachacharum(five elements) 'IP,Netmask,Gateway, Primary DNS and secondary
DNS' after this the connection establishes

The problem which anyone faces is that if there are two network card
installed in the machine , All the tragic music starts there .  if you are
using any eth0 like device like a wireless card is treated as eth1 will have
conflict in binding the mac address to the server kept in the ISP end.
This will not enable in a proper handshake.

Kindly have only one ethernet card, bind it ,configure the panchacharum, you
will be connect to the ethernet.if you have another disable, it in the
network panel and then try.

I am quoting here that "Hathway biling system is either
manupulative/errorneous which shoots the traffic score,"this is my personal
experience.


Cheers

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Hi,

Not to be taken seriously(though I ain't stopping you ;-), Why not try 
this original idea..ahem. How about getting a snap of M.S.Dhoni hugging 
tux and feeding it to the frenzy press? After all, that chap is going 
around endorsing almost everything and gets enviable media coverage.
If done, the headlines next day would possibly be like..
" *MS* (Dhoni) endorses Linux "

If I am right, the Indian Cricket team is currently in Chennai and the 
above said thing could very well be possible if you have the right 
connections.

Looks like your current model is..

1. Open Source
2. ???
3. Profit!

If you look at today's FOSS-world there's something called Open Source
2.0 happening. OpenSource 1.0 was companies like MySQL AB, RedHat.
OpenSource 2.0 is BlackDuck,CollabNet, SpikeSource, ActiveGrid and
Ubuntu. OpenSource 1.0 was all about creating Open Source products and
dual licensing it. Have one free version and have one with paid
support. The thing about Open Source 2.0 is you are now seeing
companies which are managing to re-package Open-Source and make it
enterprise ready. Choose which model you want to follow.

Take a survey , how many have nVidia and ati drivers installed when they get
their linux laptop. You will find many people spending time for downloading
it from net and then install it separately.Not only for nVidia/ATI , even
for Intel Sound Cards not being supported properly.There are
lots.Funtionkeys, I have my laptop for 2 years, and i havent seen any
distro support the
Internet Key,Mail Key,Search Key as soon as i installed the distro.

So why arent they been given with laptops and desktops yet?

WinModems...they are abundance in nature...I havent seen any distro detected
my laptop modem...sorry that i forgot the modem name...

Yes, it does not and thats the reason I havent mentioned anywhere that
Freespire passes everything. Even Freespire didnt detect my Modem and
Internet,Sound,Mal keys.And thats the reason am with Freespire as they are
having good relationships/talks now with Dell and there are many
resellers<http://www.linspire.com/featured_partner/featured_partner.php>already
selling Linspire and they are happy with
it.The Linspire team has its own Hardware Compatibility
List<http://www.linspire.com/linspire_hardware_compatibility.php>.In
regard to Plugins for the Web Browser, they have it already when you install
Freespire/Linspire.
Here<http://www.linspire.com/products_linspire_whatis.php?tab=compatibility>is
the full list.

Which kind of thread you are using?.. Try using ftime() function which
is available under sys/timeb.h for getting milli seconds accuracy.

See man pages for more info.

Hi,

you can see it clearly in this URL,

http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/install-guide/s1-diskpartitioning.html

that, only for most users, 100 MB is sufficient for /boot..

as it is said, the most users doesn't included you.. :)

Simple.. Create a larger spaced boot partition. This will solve your problem..

Are you subscribed to DSL or Cable broadband? Putting my question in an 
another way, does Hathway even offer a DSL service?

I am a Hathway *Cable* Broadband subscriber for 2 years now and never 
had a problem with linux. The network config settings are exactly the 
same as in Windows. I am guessing that you haven't installed their 
'24Online authentication client' (this app authenticates every so often 
with their Cyberoam server for access to the internet). Ok, Here's a 
step-by-step guide.

1) Note your LAN settings setup for it in Windows.
    Your Static IP, the Gateway's IP address, subnet mask {mostly
    255.255.255.0} is all you need. The Gateway also runs a DNS server.
    so DNS Server IP = Gateway IP (just this one is enough)

2) Boot to Linux, configure your ethernet with the above settings.
    After this you should be able to ping your Gateway machine.
    If you can't, I will be mostly clueless.

3) Download the '24Online Linux authentication client'.
    You have 3 choices:

    a) Download it from somewhere on the internet (not recommended)

    b) Open your browser (most likely firefox), modify its useragent
       reporting to impersonate Internet Exploder and go to
       http://{your gateway IP here}/24online/webpages/myaccountlogin.jsp
       login with your account, and click the 'client' tab and look for
       the linux client download link (How Ironic!!!).

    c) Probably the easiest path -- ask me by mail. I have both the rpm
       package (got from PCQ Linux 2006 CDs) and the deb package (which I
       built myself using alien)

    d) Use an Open-Source alternative to the Cyberoam/24Online client:
	http://linc.sourceforge.net/ (Note: I haven't tried this!)


4) The client package doesn't come with an init/rc script -- if needed
    make your own! I personally run the app manually by hand everytime I
    need to connect. The very first time you try to login it will autorun
    configuration. Usually, I need to do something like..

   24onlineClient -u {YourUsername}

   and enter password when prompted. To logout:  24onlineClient -l


5) Once you are logged in, you should be able to connect to the
    Internet.


HTH!!!

Regards
Kumaraguru

You have several fundamental problems in your assumptions.

1. Dual licensing is NOT "one free version and one with paid support".
Dual licensing is what MySQL and Trolltech do - have one completely
GPL'ed version, and another non-GPL'ed version which can be used in
proprietary software products (remember, GPL forbids proprietary
licensing for software that builds upon GPL'ed software).

2. "Re-package OSS and make it enterprise-ready" is what Redhat has
been doing for years now, quite successfully at that.

3. The companies you cite as part of your 2.0 have been around for
years - Collab.Net has been around since the late nineties.

Interesting that you consider Open Source as a business model, whereas
in reality it is a software development model.

Yup, again. We have tried calling some media persons (including a famous 
Linux magazine available in India ;) ) for some of our past events like 
Arunai and Jaya college LDDs, but we were never heard. So, we need to do 
something to make them feel the necessity of giving space for our news :D

Even if you do social service and go to educational institutions and do 
something, you need media to catch the public attention. And, we need do 
something to catch the media's attention itself :(

Why put the load on others when you can do it yourself. There is nothing 
like a 4 year old luggie only should speak to media or do a write up, in 
ILUGC even just a day old luggie can do. And, you do know whats the plan 
for SFD (as there aren't many ;) ) Help the chennailug.org maintainer to 
put the past events on the site rather than complaining that there 
aren't there ;)

parthan i aint compalining that details  it aint there , but asked for more 
details because it aint there .Stop jumping to conclusions and giving 
inappropriate comments before you really understand the context :) And 
moreover the issue is not getting media attention , if you read carefully i 
have got media attention and they want to put something over , the issue is 
just the details that have to be given :) I hope the next time you will be 
more appropriate and truly understand what is stated before you comment :)
thanking you

not necessarily it should be. Open Source as a business model is
different from software development model.

FYI, software development model says how software development should
happen. whereas open source business model is how to make money using
open source. so there's a lot of difference between business model and
development model.

May be on ARM, PowerPC, v850 boards!! May be I do not have vast
experience like you on varous architectures. But yes, I have worked on
GNU/Linux on the above said architectures with quite a few peripheral
chips around.

1. First of all, business models are not all about making money.
Revenue streams are only a part of any business model; not all of it -
in fact, I'd say the value proposition of a business model is what
makes it click.

2. Open source business model should ideally be a business model which
is open to everyone to change, copy, adopt and distribute :)

No, This is bad. The success depends on how strong you lay your Business
Model.When one enters Business, Money and Profit only speaks.The Business
Model should always be the Insiders thing and not Community driven, whereas
the Product can always be Community driven,

When you plug-in your USB device, the device gets
enumerated, and the first step in this process is a
SET_ADDRESS command. This is failing with your USB
device.

USB support is available, but, I don't see your USB
mass-storage modules loaded. Try this as root:

  modprobe usb-storage
  modprobe sd-mod

and then plug in your USB device.

Message-ID: <20060910063937.85461.qmail@web50210.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

Deepan Chakravarthy and myself conducted a one-day
workshop for the Bioinformatics department, Karpagam
Arts and Science College, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu,
India on Saturday, September 9, 2006. The photos taken
during the workshop can be viewed from here:

 http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album37

I introduced them to FLOSS, and then Deepan spoke on
how FLOSS is useful in bioinformatics. He showed a
demo of emboss, and lot of other applications. I think
he can elaborate on that as I am not familiar with the
subject. After lunch, I gave a demo of the GNU/Linux
desktop environment, and also explained basic commands
that they can use in the console environment. Deepan
then continued with his demo of bioinformatics
applications and discussed about FLOSS projects at
bioinformatics.org.

The students/faculty were really enthusiastic, and
wanted follow-up sessions. I emphasized that they
should get started with setting up a FLOSS lab, and a
GNU/Linux user group on-campus. They are ready to
provide facilities, stay, food even if you want to
spend a week there, and give them hands-on training.
There are no distractions until October 5, 2006, after
which they have model exams, followed by holidays and
exams. 

I would like to thank Prof. Hemalatha for working with
us for the past couple of weeks in coordinating and
organizing this event. Special thanks to the
department faculty and management for the facilities
and hospitality offered.

Best regards,

SK

He's being pedantic - meaning 'open source business model' should mean a 
business model itself is open. But then 'business model which uses open 
source software' is bit too unwieldy :)

Can I have an update on this? Its been a week and the
events that we have done in 2004, 2005 have not yet
been put up in the chennailug site. Even if not a
wiki, can a simple HTML page be put up?

If we had it by now, we would have provided the link
to Antono and his journalist friend.

Can we have some quick response please?

Hi all,

Could any one help me to get the samr codec for xine, I get the error
while trying to play mp4 file format (video captured in my mobile
phone) in xine.  I can play the video but without sound, which is due
to non-availability of this codec in my xine.

Thanks for ur help in this.

   Dear Friends,

   To create a media attention is also very much important for further
   development of  any movement.
   Every movement succeeded only with some support of the media.
   Just saying to refer a page I think it is not good.
   If you want to succeed in a movement we have to explain everything
   patiently
   We have to explain them briefly about the various development about FOSS.
   Some may take it in a right way.

   We will keep on explaining the ideas and concepts.

   Regards,

   L.Ramkumar

Message-ID: <15C2CAD382CB69409395ED4F159BED700E1276@mail.esntechnologies.co.in>

Dear All,

 

I developed a small prototype for the block driver as given in the 16th
chapter of Alessandro Rubini book in 2.6.10 kernel and ported to
2.6.16.9 kernel.

 

Everything works fine except the ioctl part. When I issue commands like
mkfs.msdos and mkfs.vfat, the ioctl of the driver gets invoked in 2.6.10
but not in the 2.6.16.9.

 

I did strace on the command mkfs.msdos and noticed that the application
is issuing the 0x301 ioctl to the block layer which is returning with
the following error:

"Inappropriate ioctl to the device"

 

This error in turn is resulting in mkfs.msdos error.  The command says
"unable to get the disk geometry"

 

Can any one provide a pointer about the usage of the above two commands
in the 2.6.16.9 kernel.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Srinivas.

Hi,

I saw some new past event entries in our chennailug.org website.
People will come to know what ILUG-C is doing. my suggestion is on
this, any event which is planned should be added before the event is
happening so that people might aware of upcoming events and also
interested in participating in the events rather than just seeing what
has happeneed.

i see sakthi and many people doing good events in schools, colleges.
if you have planned / unplanned for the future, just do make an entry
in to the website so that let everyone knows abt that.

#include <"Std disclaimer: I am no kernel programmer".h>

Usually kernel code doesn't read files directly. It uses a helper
program running in  user space. If you are talking about reading user
memory from kernel space then I guess you are talking about mmap(2)

I think the standard approach is that of never making the kernel
do anything on its own save interrupt and other async
processing. Always the kernel acts on behalf of someone in user
space, IOW kernel code is always executed in user context. Don't
take this in the technical sense. I mean on behalf of a user
spaec process...

My two cents

Best,
Girish

Thanks for your prompt help. But,perhaps you didnt get me clearly.  I want some data which is generated by my user space program to be available to the kernel module. And i require the kernel module to be able to access those independently without requiring the intervention of a user process.

Any positive feedback wiil be acknowledged!

I guess you could try  kernelnewbies@nl.linux.org

You will get a much more technical and informative answer there. 

Your question is very good, so I am damn sure someone will respond immediately.

Not required when:

1. You don't need volunteers for the event. 

2. It is not a public event, and is to be conducted
for a college, in private.

Raman already answered this question, earlier.

Actually my knowledge stops where kernel begins. :-)

I think Suman Adak is listening and will get back to u at the earliest. 

AFAIK mmap(2) will do what u want to do. Did you RTFM?

Once u setup the mapping then the kernel as well as user space can access the relevant pages. after that your kernel code I think driver can do whatever it wants with it.

How can I mount/unmount my USB drives manually?
When I chose 'Turn off computer' after some messages, it says 'Will now

The same happens with init 0. However, restart works perfectly.

Hey. This is Great.

Now to give a few tips:
A business model should make financially profits.
To start a business based on Oss first identify a business sector of your
interest / expertise.

Auction Business sector  : ( ex ebay)
Advertisement Business sector  : ex google / yahoo
Pure Information  Business sector   ( ex matrimonial web sites, )
Training & Education Business sector   :

The process should be first identify the business opportunity and then
capitalise on the opportunities using foss. Foss repositories may not have
all the components, You have to develop the missing links yourself . And may
be add them to the foss repository also.

You need to develop some good business knowledge in addition to technical
knowledge.
and need to have the vision to see emerging business opportunities.

jfyi the business revenue of  www.tamilmatrimony.com is  Rs 60 crores for
the year 2005. the site  was started around  10 years ago. there are a lot
of similar matrimony sites  started recently. not all of them make this kind
of money. In fact some of them have lost money and closed down.

so you need to have the visibility to see thro the future.
There may be  many similar opportunities today which  no one has noticed it
so far.
If you can spot an opportunity, then slowly build the idea, then you will
have crores of money flowing in 5 / 10 years from now.

you need to have the patience and the determination.
Not only Foss , all the successful businesses go thro these phases


Best of luck

I think the best way for you to proceed is to implement an ioctl in
your kernel module, and call it from your user space program when you
have each record ready and populated.

Or use one of proc, sysfs or netlink interface but the simplest will
be to implement write/ioctl.

6.06 somehow doesn't install the required debs for this.  Install dbus
and the related debs for it so that hald and dbus are started.

That will let you automount / remove usb devices, cdroms etc.

Always give complete information. See what

A lot of mails have crossed on this subject. I believe, you need to be
clear where you want to be. Options are
1. Company that would make money by supporting and promoting usage of
OSS: This is a very viable business model. Given the over-distribution
practiced by guys like M$, sale of M$ products yield very low margins.
This prompts vendors to provide service and charge for it. This model is
no different except that S/w is OSS instead of M$ or other priced
products. Overall cost of ownership to the customer is lower. I used to
run a business on this model. It is very viable. you'll need to build
domain expertise in verticals and experiment, participate and contribute
to software that you pick to support. The selling of this service is not
as easy as a M$ vendor as you'd have to establish your credentials and
also provide comfort that OSS can do the job. The customer will be wary
of a single point support availability.

2. Build a product and publish a part/version of it in OSS like MySQL
and others do. Here your to success is building a good product. This is
a completely different ball game from the option above. You could make
money on a commercial version and/or support fees.

3. customise and existing product like plone, sugar crm, etc etc etc  
and support it. The big problem here is that you have to charge a 12%  
service tax. Deeprootlinux in bangalore is very successful in this.  
As is mahiti, also in bangalore

Dear friends,

     I recently saw an exchange in the FreeBSD mailing list in which a German professor was asking for a simple command line RSS reader. And nobody could help him out.

     I am damn sure that we can easily develop one in a matter of weeks and put up a project in sourceforge. 

     I am paging for BE/MCA third/final year students and even professionals with some spare time to get in touch with me off list. It will help you learn lil bit about Web 2.0 which is getting hot these days. 

     No, I am not an expert in this field. If I were I would have written it myself. :-) However I can mentor you and guide you technically with elements of simple design and user interface based on my UNIX experience. 

     Remember, there is no financial transaction. Only if you lust for the pure joy of creating something , you need to approach me. 

     Looking forward to hearing from you.

hi Shakthi and all ,

Yes before that i read this article and implemented some bad coding which
has been showing on that article. Don't try this code in vendor's
kernel.InFC5 doesn't  export sys_open,sys_write system call. But a
fresh vanilla
kernel could do. The question was how to read file from user space to kernel
space efficiently .  And more ever i used to wonder how many configuration
files are being read by kernel? I tried to give answer as per my knowledge.
Please correct me

. More ever i and amit submitted one paper at ILUG-Delhi annual festival
Freedel 2006. It has been selected and amit is going to give talk. We have
proposed one host based intrusion detection and prevention system. Our
approach is like , User space will act as a detection system and gather
intrusion knowledge. After some time it will pass this info to kernel where
packets with intrusion would be blocked at IP layer.We are not thinking
about performance now. We just want to implement it. And yes i could read
the file using sys_open(), sys_read() kernel system call. But AFIK we had
several solution to do that job.
Might be amit has posted this to know better solution from other kernel
programmer.
1) implementing a char device and  ioctl() system call and creating /proc
entry
2) using kernel system call which has been exported by kernel
3)  create and use sysfs files within a kernel module.
4) using netlink socket.
[Sorry: All solutions have been suggested by other member. Thanks to all. I
just wrote it to summarize the whole things to keep in mind that later
anybody could get help from that].

But the question is that why we shouldn't read or write files in kernel
space? And what is the efficient way to do that?does kernel actually reads
or writes files?

The only one reason that i could find , "where" and "how" files would be
located and loaded . and it is policy decision in the linux community that
we shouldn't do. The problem is , where this config file lives? Is there any
particular location where all config file can stay and read by kernel. If i
am correct, the various same config file location could be different in
different distribution. So one my kernel module can run only one
distribution. It is not guaranteed that it will run in different
distribution.

And yes how to load the config files. May today u r using very simple file
but tomorrow you could use very complex database file and in that case
kernel doesn't have more flexibility to handle such file.

So many kernel hackers suggest not to read and write file in kernel space.
But what is the solution?

Yes as per my knowledge, We could do like
1) Implement file reading and writing in user space
2) communicate vis /proc entry.

 I can give some example
1.Mounting file system [ mount program reads config file /etc/fstab and
issue mount system call]

2.Netfilter filrewalls gets rule from user space application[iptables which
read the configuration file and communication with kernel via socket]
3. Many more.....


I think i should write one article with example.....hope i will finish as
early as possible..

Thanks
Suman

Treat kernel as a resource manager. As a user you make
requests to the kernel, not force the kernel to do
things as you as a kernel developer would like it to
do. Freedom is always to the end user.

"The most common problem is interpreting the data.
Writing a file interpreter from within the kernel is a
process ripe for problems, and any errors in that
interpreter can cause devastating crashes. Also, any
errors in the interpreter could cause buffer
overflows. These might allow unprivileged users to
take over a machine or get access to protected data,
such as password files.

Trying to protect the kernel from dumb programming
errors is not the most important reason for not
allowing drivers to read files."

Yes, but, it is initiated by the end-user as a request
to the kernel, via a system call.

It is always the end-user or user daemons that make
requests to the kernel, and the kernel just services
it.

Convert Shapefile to SVG ?

http://www.carto.net/papers/svg/utils/shp2svg/

Then use GTK's ImageView widget to display the image ?
If Gtk's Image View doesn't support SVG, use Gtk-MozEmbed, which is
based on Gecko and should render the SVG file.

AFAIK firefox browser and inkscape can display SVG too. Though SVG filters can't be rendered properly...

Message-ID: <92f9a9560609121351j4e369043rbe1552a7a87af983@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

A while ago, I asked what people use for knowledge/information
management.  The original post is here:
    http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2006-May/026024.html

I've hit on the perfect tool for my needs -- Wikidpad.
    http://wikidpad.python-hosting.com/

Wikidpad claims to be "an IDE for your thoughts", and for me
it has lived up to the claim.  There are still a few rough
edges (I'm using 1.7RC1), and some missing features (inability
embedd external files/photos, collaboration, etc).  But the
flexible tagging system and easy interface makes it an
exceptionally useful tool.

If you suffer from information overload, I urge you to
give it a try.


Btw, Danny O'Brien's Life Hacks talk from:
    http://quernstone.com/notcon04/
is entertaining as well as enlightening.

Eh ?! When did Fedora Core started updating from the net rather than its 
4 CDs?? Please, can you post briefly what you did actually ?

Hmm, a little googling did help me out. This is a known issue with FC5.

By default, sendmail will accept mails from/to the domains it is 
configured for. You can use the access database to specify which email 
IDs from/to are allowed to relay - use the /etc/mail/access file. 
Assuming sendmail 8.12 upwards.

I've not used it to specify combinations of From/To addresses. I know 
the LHS tags can be used but am not sure if you can use two LHS tags per 
line for action. Since it is a hash table, I doubt it.

I'd do this by using the SMTP auth mechanism. Create a separate 
uid/password auth mechanism in PAM for SMTP and put in only those users 
for whom you want to allow external relaying. Use the access db to allow 
only To:<your domain>.

Dear friends:
The LUG at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) was started during
the visit of RMS -- I think couple of years back. It has been
sporadically active and the current members are keen to be
continuously active. They are well supported by Prof Ganesan who has
also set up a Linux lab in the computer department. They are also
having Linux in B.E., and FOSS subjects in masters programmes.

While the plan is to have FOSS workshops, LDDs, projects, etc. they
have informed me that
quote
the L.U.G at VIT has decided to spread awareness on free software
through a meeting on the 16th inst. We have also seriously taken up
the work of determining areas of interest to pursue projects.
Furthermore we will be glad to establish contact with any member of
the L.U.G Chennai and seek his assistance.
unquote

They are keen to have a presence of at least one member from ILUG-C on
16th -- the function can be in the morning for an hour or two.
Interested members could contact:
Mr. Ambuj Thacker, ambuj.mbp@gmail.com

(** Bharathi: would you be free? raman will try to make it just for
the morning, if nobody else is available).

Thanks and best wishes, Srinivasan.

I think ,This is not the exact solution. It can be trated as  creating a yum
repository with ISO image or DVD " For more info u may read this link also
http://www.city-fan.org/tips/YumRepoFromImages
But all you need to dump your CD or DVD image in ur harddisk.[ Well don't
say that buy 120GB harddisk, i have only 40 GB [i am a poor
person]]............:-)

I would like to know, is there any application or Add/Remove software in FC5
can do as YaST [ http://en.opensuse.org/YaST] is doing with SUSE or
something like that?

...We just need to search the program name in YaST[in one module],YaST will
search the packages from list of CD(It depends on the configuration of the
your Installlation source. U need to just deselct the all other network
source]. YaST resolves the dependencies and just ask for the particular
CD...I don't need to dump 5 FC5 CD with my box...

I think mahesh is asking this things and me also. Beacause i don't have
internet at my home system. And franckly speaking why FC5 removed this
feature as it was with FC4.
i am thinking why should we not start a project which i can offer mixed
power of yaST[Installtion module and yum [ But i don't know of these
application programming python,qt, etc..].........

Ii am planning to move with Ubutu or Debian....
Thanks

This should be useul for Ubuntu:

http://www.mail-archive.com/uug-list@uug.byu.edu/msg17250.html

However, I guess we can't become the official mirror for Ubuntu unless
we mirror all architectures.

I couldn't find much about FreeBSD mirror setup. However, I did notice
that they have neatly separated the architecture setup. For example,
it may be sufficient to just mirror for the latest releasr from the
following sites:

ftp://ftp.is.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ (for the release,
packages etc.)

ftp://ftp.is.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/ (for the ports).

However, more experienced FreeBSD users may be able to suggest better
ways.

First of all we as a community are immensely indebted to you. No words can show the gratitude we owe to you. Having resources is one, willing to share it for the common good quite another.

Anyway let me come to the point. I can take over the FreeBSD and Ubuntu mirroring if that is your decision. To me the decision seems quite fair. I would love to learn the steps involved in a live mirror setup.

If my coming and physically setting up things is okay with you then I guess I should be able to take care of pruning the size as well. FreeBSD I guess is the largest OS out there and there are plenty of binary blobs and huge source trees that build automatically. It has plenty of compatibility layers and stuff like that. 

Though I am not technically competent to comment on why it is so huge and if pruning is possible at all these are my top of the mind ideas.

Please let me know if my coming there is acceptable to you. If not I will try to help you out with the necessary stuff remotely. I will have to do some research on pruning for instance.

Girish

This is not to belittle any contributions, but...

IIT-M gets significant funding from the Government, which is
in turn funded by the tax payers (you, me, and the public).
Any morally binding organisation that is Govt funded (of
which IIT-M is a fine example) *owes* it to society to
make its resources available for the common good.

I can't think of *any* other educational institution, Govt
funded or private, that would be interested/capable of
running a LUG in the fine manner it's being run all these
years.  There is no one else.  It is IIT-M's *duty* to
do support the LUG.

That said, the mirror space offered is highly appreciated.

Well many years ago, when I was younger and brasher, I saw his name on
the list.  Looked him up in the phone book and then waltzed into his
office in IIT demanding Linux CDs.  I can't think of doing that now,
but instead of throwing me out on my rump, he took me down to a lab
and had them burnt for me.  So, yeah, he is quite a helpful chap.
Much appreciated. :)

Not removed as much as rewritten. System-config-packages in previous 
versions does not work with repositories at all. Pirut is yum based and 
Yum needs some work to work with media in a better way. This is being 
tracked on https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=188750 
and is a FC6 blocker.

That would be duplicating work already being done.

You can almost certainly drop the ia64 packages without anyone
noticing, but you should really try to mirror the full i386 and amd64
sets.  sparc64 is probably lower use, but still worth mirroring if you
can (at least 6.x and 7.x).

Dear Sriram,

     (I sent an e-mail yday to freebsd-hubs@freebsd.org for our problem.
      I am attaching the response here.)

     Nobody gave me specifics or numbers as you can see, but at least this much I am able to guess that we can get a lot below the 300 GB number.

     I am just curious, are you concerned about the disk space (which is peanuts these days) or the bandwidth? As CVSup is really efficient once you download the entire thing. It only patches deltas.

     Because though FreeBSD distribution is large the number of ppl downloading it going to be minuscule compared to linux. So whichever way you look at it I don't see bandwidth hog an issue here.

     Please correct me if I am wrong here.

     Anyway I am waiting for you to get back to me on how to proceed.

regards,
Girish

That document has not been updated since 2002.

I guess that means I should beg for volunteers now.

Is anybody willing to update the Kernel Hacking HOWTO,
on the kernelnewbies wiki so anybody everybody can help
out and turn it into something more complete and up to
date?

I'm not asking for a lifetime commitment to the cause,
just for some temporary effort.  By leaving it on the
wiki, others can pick up the effort after you...

Sorry, forgot... Red Hat (EL) 4 or Fedora Core 4 ?

Why don't you try other distributions and see if it works ? (Hope, you 
are not distro specific, if so - am sorry)

LOL!

It all depends on the interpretation of "common good".  And by
any interpretation, the people's representatives don't count :-)

Nearly all government funded universities overseas have Community
Outreach Programs or atleast Open Days which contribute to the
"greater good".  For example, NASA for has several outstanding
community outreach programs that target schools and colleges.
And these are all official programs mandated and approved by
the Govt and funding agencies.

Btw, an excellent example a useful mirror is AARNet.  It's a
non-profit organisation run by 37 universities and CSIRO to
provide a huge mirror with fast access within Australia (from
most Australian universities, aarnet is faster than a local
cdrom).  mirror.aarnet.edu.au was (and probably still is) the
largest and most used mirror site in the Asia/Pac region.

Would be nice to see IIT-M's mirror being the start of something
like AARNet :-)

ERNet was supposed to have been the Indian equivalent. They did have
several projects that could have indeed brought the Internet closer to
educational institutions within in India:

http://www.ernet.in/gv.htm

No idea what the status of ERNet now is.

sata you mean ???
in old versions of linux you must provide manually the support for the scsi 
interface .
First copy the sata controller driver in a floppy and where required select 
theoption to load external driver and select your driver

If I remember correctly, there was a huge ramp-up for a inter-university 
high-speed network between some Indian and US universities a while back, 
called 'Sankhyavahini'. I think it was abandoned due to 'security 
concerns' from our side. Wonder what they are.

cvsup is a tool that gets you the freebsd OS source cvs tree, and the
ports tree

So you get source to build the base OS, and you get a ports tree - a
bunch of software ported to bsd but the tree just has makefiles,
location + md5sum of various source tarballs, a list of OS specific patches

There is a nice intro to CVSup at:

If you have the hardware and the bandwidth to donate, contact Polstra at 
jdp@freebsd.org. Include your location, as he tries to balance mirrors 
by geography. If your area is short on mirrors and you fit his other 
requirements, he might take you up on it. John chooses the mirror sites 
carefully, balancing the needs against the locations offered and the 
capacity. "I would be unlikely to allow 30 mirror sites in, say, 
Iceland," he says.

Couple of points here.

  a) The ports tree does not come with source of course. It is the job of the Makefile rule to fetch the source from various sources. It could even be the FreeBSD mirror itself. But on a FreeBSD machine, the ports directory simply contains as Suresh rightly mentioned, only the Makefile( which is very very small since it includes majority of its macros from a master makefile), and the URLs for different locations for the same source and its MD5 sum. Once u hit make or make install inside say /usr/ports/net/netcat or something, it downloads the original source either from soureforge or elsewhere as the case may be, checks the integrity with size and checksum, unpacks it, applies the FreeBSD specific patches, then compiles and installs.

  Of course, you can tune certain parameters like which library to link against, what should be the database backend etc. using make config. But in most cases it doesnt bother u with questions since most ports have sensible default options already set.

  Sorry for the digression. I just wanted to clear the point that the ports tree doesnt actually have sources apiori.

   b) This is the most important point. CVSup may have been written for FreeBSD but it is by no means restricted to FreeBSD at all. It is just a network efficient tool for syncing CVS sources since it understands CVS quite well. It is a good improvement on the stupid network protocol of CVS. I have used CVSup only on Debian so far ironically. I used to use both CVSup and rsync for synching my sources and backing up the CVS repository with a cron job. 

   Now, CVSup has two modes of operation, one in which it replicates the CVS repository itself and another in which it syncs the source checked out of CVS.

   I am not really sure how CVSup compares to rsync. It  looks as though CVS uses rsync on its backend. rsync actually is quite generic for syncing any sort of data, as it is a mathematical algo whereas CVSup works at a higher level for synchig CVS trees.

   And to add to the confusion I see lot of discussions on the mailing lists about portsnap being the latest tool for the job of CVSup and that CVSup is obsolete. :-)

   I think we should just forget about CVSup and look at portsnap. It certainly is going to kill CVSup just like how ssh(1) killed  the insecure dinosaur telnet(1).

   Just google for portsnap. I think we should be using portsnap for syncing the mirrors too. I will do more digging and get back on that.

   So long,
   Girish

Dear friends: NRCFOSS has been involved in promoting migration to FOSS
-- equivalents for proprietary products for a variety of applications
.

At present, we are gathering information on equivalents for products
like Auto CAD, Auto Desk (3Ds Max, Maya, Flame, Combustion, etc.),
Adobe Photoshop / Studio, 3-D/Visual effects products like Furnacs,
Anvil, Silhouette, PFTrack, etc.

We plan to prepare brief writeups / comparative reports on the
proprietary and the equivalent FOSS products. Those interested in this
exercise are requested to contact me at

We started the event by 6:25( 5 minutes before the intended time) with
Tamizh thai vazhuthu( The prayer song) anchored by  Jaya Engg College
volunteers, Mr. Raja and myself  played a skit as a lay man asks questions
regarding with open source to a consultant. I played the role of a lay man
and Raja lived in the role of an opensource consultant. The program went on
with demos for kids, We had visitors from  UK and USA, Mr.Raman gave
inspirational explanatory speech on opensoure. The Twin brothers of ilugc
Mr.Srinivasan and Mr.Bala Vignesh demoed the  3d desktop. SRM college
student gave a demo on open office. we had quizzes for the audience.I  gave
the vote of thanks and  with National anthem we summed the  festival.

We had a good time. I will upload the photos in a day or two, I thank the
oppurtunity and the team for the contribution and commitment.

   Software Freedom Day Celebration At Mahadanapuram.

   Our Software Freedom Day Celebration Started on August 15, (Independence
   Day of India).
   To Celebrate the event from the grass root we started giving computer
   training program to  school students of the follwing Schools.

   follows.

   1. Dinamalar

   3. Daily Thanthi
   4. Dinamani

   On the day of SFD, the students were given demo of using Ubuntu and other
   FOSS Software.

   We prepared around 2000 pamphlets about the SFD celebration and
   distributed it.

   Since our centre is located in village, our team decided to form a free
   computer game centre to create more interest among the students.

   We inaugurated a Free Computer Game Centre named " Rajaram Siruvargal
   Video Game Ulagam"

   The session started with the prayer.

   Mr. Jaganathan, Principal, Sri. M.V.M ITI gave a brief introduction about
   computers and its uses.

   Mr. Rajasekaran, Vice Principal Sri MVM ITI gave a lecture about
   utilisation of computers in industrial Training Institute.

   Mr. Rajaram, wished that there should be lot of support from city and
   international groups for making the technolgy to reach the village.

   Mr. L.Ramkumar, Organiser SFD, Mahadanpuram gave the ideas of Software.
   then he told about What is Software Freedom and what are the reasons for
   celebrating Software Freedom Day.

   Mr. Mathivannan, Regional Director, Lexicon Training Academy told his
   experience with software monopoly and he conveyed Software Freedom is
   necessary for India.

   Mr. Muthukumar asked the student community to create their own open source
   software which should help others for future development.

   Dr. Meena, Cheif Guest relesed the Ubuntu CD for public distribution.

   She described briefly about the neccessity of Software Freedom. She
   distributed nearly 100 Certificate to the students and public participated
   in the Computer Awareness Camp.

   Around 500 members of different age group and sector witnessed and shared
   their thoughts in the Software Freeom Day Celebration at Mahadanapuram.

   The media persons made visit to Schools and wrote a brief article before
   and after the celebration.

   The Students, Government Officials, Teachers, Public Participated with
   enthu and SFD 2006 has spread the message of Software Freedom.

   Make a Visit to Mahadanapuram and share your software thoughts.

gives sound ,for which i goto th e terminal and kill it every time.
Is there a way to stop this?what config file should ideal with.

5)the concept of I-node
6)Is there any limit for the number of args that can be passed to the shell

8)give me simple recursion program explaining how the values are viewed thru
gdb,,using all possible commands such as setting breakpoint,backtrace,step
over and so on.
9)The differnce b/w simple bidirectional and cascaded pipe..along with a
simple code..(some confusion already)
10) how to send a message from
                             i)one linux system to another running linux

|
|1.difference between locate and find command.
locate uses a static database updated from cron. I think most linux distros run it once a day at nite. which means that unless u update it manually with updatedb run as root, u will not find recently deleted or created files.

find works in real time and can be painfully slow since it has lot of work to do. so unless u r looking for needles in a haystack find is for u.
|2 in ctime(3) what does 3 in the parentheses signify.
3 is the man page section. this is to avoid confusion in cases where socket(1) and socket(2) are two diff things. One is a shell command and another is a system call. Read man man to know more about what each section contains. You can also do a "man 2 intro" or a "man 3 intro" on a decent linux distro to know what each section is supposed to contain. 

Also there are cases where the same program is split into multiple man pages , for instance, when i do an "apropos cron", i get several pages and crontab(1) and crontab(5) both refer to diff parts of the same program. 
|3.  give a simple sample code that uses to find the time of execution of
|thread (thread created using the pthread.h)
	I wonder why you guys are so hung up with threads. Real UNIX never had any threads and never will have. fork() is the way to go. Multi threaded programs are buggy and crash often. I know nobody in this list will appreciate this fact but this is the truth. 
|4.whenever i boot debian linux the esd starts running automatically and
|gives sound ,for which i goto th e terminal and kill it every time.
|Is there a way to stop this?what config file should ideal with.
My debian doesnt do that. Maybe ur using gnome? ESD is gnome sound daemon. I think sound daemons like esd and arts are used for software mixing and other cool audio mixing stuff. Never got the time to play with it. 

But I dont know the answer to ur question. sorry.
|
|5)the concept of I-node
Pick up any book on UNIX and u will know the answer. Even google will help. It is very simple. It is nothing but the index of a file. In UNIX file systems like ffs, ufs, ext*fs etc., files are represented as a doubly linked liston disk. And i-nodes are linked list node identifiers. Simple and straight. Of course, files mean directories too.
|6)Is there any limit for the number of args that can be passed to the shell
What do u mean passed to shell? Shell is also a userland program like any other. It has no special privileges. Generally there is a limit on the buffer size of command line arguments enforced by the C compiler or something else. I dont know where the limit comes from ,but u cant pass a 1024 char long string on the command line. It will cause a buffer overflow.

Number of args purely depends on the program in question. 

RTFM getopt(1).
|7what is the use of sticky bit .
It is a theoretical concept not used much practically. sticky is often used in the context of CVS tags. It is used in file permissions to signify something, I dont remember, pick up a book and find out. Or RTFM chmod(1) or chattr(1)
|8)give me simple recursion program explaining how the values are viewed thru
|gdb,,using all possible commands such as setting breakpoint,backtrace,step
|over and so on.

I dont use gdb much. I prefer using printf() for debugging. You can set breakpoints easily using the command "b <line>" or "b <function>". Very easy to use. 

You can use bt or where to backtrace after a crash. Two steps are useful, step and next, which is abbreviated as s and n.

Simple recursion program? what do u mean? recursion is a theoretical concept not used much in practice. It finds use during directory traversal and other such niche areas where recursion is an elegant way to solve problems. Usually real life doenst demand much recursion. :-)
|9)The differnce b/w simple bidirectional and cascaded pipe..along with a
|simple code..(some confusion already)
	I dont know what u mean. I know only unidirectional pipe as the man page for pipe clearly mentions that pipe is a unidirectional channel for communication between related processes.

	I know that perl supports some bidirectional pipe using two pipes,maybe u r talking some advanced stuff I dont know. But pipes have always been unidirectional. If there are variants, they may be built on top of the basic thing, not in exclusion of it.
|10) how to send a message from
|                            i)one linux system to another running linux
|.(provided n/w are all well configured)
	You can use write(1) or talk(1). talk is junk , so ur better off running an irc server. Or use mail to send mail bet users. Noadays ppl simply use something like yahoo! or jabber even for local chat. Not an ugly solution IMHO.
|                            ii)system in windows to linux .
yahoo! seems to be a good idea. If u dont have internet, u can of course do a ssh and use linux mechanisms or use one of Windoze clients for the above.

|
|11) how to rename some 1000 files in a dir with *.txt to *.htm  (tried mv
|*.txt *.htm --> not working)
yes, move does not work with shell patterns. For good reason, if you were to write mv, how would u do it. You have to write a simple script like this.
for i in *
do
 j=`echo $i | cut -d'.' -f1`
 mv $j.txt $j.htm
done

Great job, please carry on with your good work.

I feel ILUGC should take this invitation and do something. Probably
if you can organise a seminar to colleges - engg and science - in and
around the area we can participate. You can think of organising an
LDD in a college/school for students+public+industry in which ILUGC
can participate.

Actually, we did, more than a year back (July 16,
2005). Ramkumar and company are from the
Tiruchirapalli Mysql group. They had arranged for a
workshop, and I spoke at Saranathan College of
Engineering, Tiruchirapalli:

Yes, we need to have regular follow-up sessions with
more speakers.

Hi,
We are a small company in IT based at Mylapore. I never thought so far 
about sending job offers on that list, but after all why not.. it might 
be the right place ;-)
Our activity is based essentialy on free software and we are running

we are looking for someone experienced in PHP. By experienced, we don't 
mean necessarily with ten years of experience in a company... only if 
you have already developped your own projects, or if you use to work for 
free software projects, it is enough for us.. We mainly want someone 
motivated and who knows how to code properly in PHP.
If you match and if you are interested, send us your resume at

Thank you.

Message-ID: <450FB015.5080308@frodo.hserus.net>

Well, as there are several job reqs posted today, I'll post one too.

I manage the antispam operations at Outblaze (http://www.outblaze.com) -
we're a Hong Kong based company and do antispam filtering and/or email
hosting for some of the largest webmail / ISP services in the world
(such as mail.com in the USA, and rediffmail, indiainfo in India)

We're shortly setting up an office here in Madras and are recruiting a
few good people to start with.  There's an initial requirement of two
freshers to do tier 1 email responses on our abuse desk [aka: receive
spam complaints from people about our users, and shut down the accounts
caught spamming.

The job will actually require a decent amount of competency in using
linux as a desktop, preferably some competence in using a console based
mail reader like mutt.  Also, basic skills in shell, mysql etc to
automate certain of your tasks as you go on.

One absolute requirement is excellent spoken and written English
communication skills - by which I mean English that is standard,
grammatically correct, without either

1. Messenger / IRC spelling ("hai. how r u")

2. Outdated Wren and Martin style or "Indian business english" ("I will
revert back to you regarding this")

Please send me your CVs in plain text format [no word, openoffice, pdf,
html etc please] - send these to suresh@outblaze.com

To others around: If you can do more than this, and have a better than
average understanding for this list of SMTP, DNS, mysql / c / perl
skills, AND have excellent english spoken and written skills, of course,
please do send me your CVs as well.  There are various other positions
open if we find the right people to fill them.

All these jobs are based in Madras.

Do you mean:

a. fork()ing programs do not crash?
b. The fact that a few programs are buggy is enough to ridicule
threads entirely?

What do you mean by "Real UNIX"? POSIX - an IEEE standard for Unix
operating systems - has a standard for threads. Does that mean POSIX
is not "Real UNIX"?

Hmm. Ever looked at ls -ld /tmp ? In fact, I don't remember ever
encountering sticky bit in the context of CVS. Maybe you are confused
between the sticky bit and the setuid/setgid bits?

Can you spell DNS??

POSIX specifies a pipe(2) system call for bidirectional pipes.
Implementations might choose a pair of unidirectional pipes, but that
is irrelevant.

Hi,
I need to transfer some files from remote PC using tftp (don't want to 
use rsync/ftp/scp or more).
I have enabled tftp in both PCs using 'ntsysv' and making "disable=no" 
in /etc/xinetd.d/tftp file.
Both PCs are reachable. But tftp is not working as i followed simple 
syntax given in man page.

Do i need to start any service? I tried 'service in.tftpd status' but it 
is displaying error: Unrecognized servce.
Pls reply the following queries:
i)  How can I use tftp?
ii) What is the maximum file size i can transfer?
iii) Any idea, How this mechanism works in UDP?
iv) Some more practical inputs/usage/links/limitations.
v) Any information about transfer speed and System load?

I am not sure about the validity of query (iii) as I have only read from 
net.

Thanks & Regards,

Hi Friends,

I would like to get a copy of KNOPPIX CD.  If someone has a copy, I would
like to borrow it and make a copy for myself.

I am interested in learning LINUX - PHP & MYSQL.  Can someone recommend a

You are in B and want to TFTP a file from A, then TFTP must be running
in A & need to specify the tftp src location in /etc/xinetd.d/tftp

Example: server_args = -s /tftpboot/dir/

and place the "file" in /tftpboot/dir/.

Any particular reason why you want to use tftp? It is the stupidest protocol I have come across as it is a simple stop and wait protocol that does not even work properly sometimes across devices on the same LAN or thro' serial lines. 

Its rexmit mechanims and error detection mechanisms are all very very unsuitable for common use. 

Moreover being a UDP protocol, reliability is not guaranteed. Just try pingint your other remote machine and observe how many packets get lost due to timeout and various other reasons. Do you think tftp shud be different? Of course it will rexmit and if you are lucky you will get what you want.

I say, why torture yourself when you have so many other options?

I normally use scp. If you dont want that you can run a simple httpd server at the remote end using yaws or thttpd. Sorry , I know this is not what you want but I thought you changed ur mind after reading my mail? :-)
|i)  How can I use tftp?
Maybe your tftp files dir is not created or something, check the logs. You are better off using nc to check whether something is listening at UDP port 69 at the other end. You can also use nmap of course.
|ii) What is the maximum file size i can transfer?
Don't know. Normally tftp is used for downloading firmware. I guess there might not be a limit, but I might be wrong. I faintly remember there is a limit. As I told you embedded device with restrained mem and cpu use tftp since it is simple to deploy and just works in an error free environment. 

This is extracted from my OpenBSD tftpd man page.

<cut>
BUGS
     This implementation of tftpd does not support blocksize negotiation (RFC
      1783), so files larger than 33488896 octets (65535 blocks) cannot be
          transferred.

      Many TFTP clients will not transfer files over 16744448 octets (32767
           blocks).

<cut>

Octet is nothing but a byte.

Using it across the Internet is certainly not a good idea.
|iii) Any idea, How this mechanism works in UDP?
I didnt understand the question.
|iv) Some more practical inputs/usage/links/limitations.
I have given enuf above. :-)
|v) Any information about transfer speed and System load?
It uses a very simple flow control mechanism called stop and wait. No, it hardly causes any load on the system.

So I guess transfer speed is suboptimal as you have no concept of windows like TCP in which you can pipeline sends without receiving ACKs.

It just rexmits for I think five times if a packet gets lost. 

It has no user auth mechanism though you are somewhat safe since nobody can normally clobber your files. Everyone can read it however.

Best,
Girish

tftp is very simple to implement and thus has found its way into
the firmware (bios) of several computers.  My old Alphastation and
SGI Indy bootroms had a tftp client and could diskless boot off the
network.  tftp is still being used to load kernels on diskless nodes.

The possibility that the OP is using an embedded or diskless
computer could not be far fetched, given that he's posting from
a Midas Comm email ID.

++1.
RedBoot and uboot are bootloaders usually found on embedded devices
and they both have tftp client functionality built into them for
downloading images via network. The OP would be using a similar
bootloader.

If you want to have a simple ftp client like functionality built into
a embedded device's bootloader program tftp makes sense.

Why do you are looking for a training institute to learn an FOSS subject 
? Get books, sit with the computer, learn - if doubts come or you get 
struck some where ask the community. In additional there are fantastic 
tutorials and pretty helpful & active forums there for PHP and MYSQL. If 
you have real interest you can learn Basic PHP and MySQL within a week, 
no big deal.

(Sorry, those running training institutes are surely gonna flame me down

All is well as long as the tftp server is not remote. :-)

Anyway I owe an apology to all since I said that tftp is used over serial lines. That is utter nonsense. tftp is usable only over TCP/IP over UDP. So tftp is mostly usably only using ethernet. 

The reason for my confusion was that I used to download the firmware/image using the serial line using ymodem/zmodem whenever the boot loader on the device was hosed. The boot loader had the tftp client.

Sorry for the confusion.

Best,
Girish

No, no and no. The very purpose of a free form mailing list like ilugc is to enable ppl to speak the truth. 

Normally in situations like the corporate environments, you have to think about a 100 factors before opening the mouth. Not so in the Internet. ;-)

Anyway I completely agree with Parthan. Please dont waste money on training institutes. It is a waste of time and money. 

Do as he said.

TFTP is usable over serial lines if a protocol capable of
encapsulating IP over such lines is used at the OSI layer 2 (eg: PPP).

hi,
both are linux frienldly if ethernet adsl modem/routers are used. But
supportwise
airtel is verygood, bsnl is pitiable. Problems come rarerly in
Airtel/BSNL. Once it comes airtel will attend immediately, in BSNL you
will have to run pillar to post.

I will disagree with this. Day before yesterday, my DataOne was
disconnected due to an outstanding bill (The phone was disconnected
about a week before that). On payment, within one hour the telephone
was rectified but not the broadband, and so I thought that it was a
technical issue and I called Customer Care(1500). Firstly, I was
surprised to get a young female voice at the other end:) who said it
will be fixed in 24 hrs. I said I wanted the net urgently, and I was
called by a Service Engineer within 20 minutes, who did not even
assume I used Windows and asked me which operating system I used, and
when I said Linux, gave me instructions for Linux. I was eventually
told this was due to the non payment of the bill, and will be
corrected as soon as their database is updated.

Within an hour even they called me again, and told me that it was restored.

Also no other service gives wireless routers for such a cheap rent.

DataOne Rocks!!!

Hi all,

I use Tata Indicomm 128 kbps and its really good. Its an ethernet/router and
a public static ip.Earlier, Tata Indicomm service was bad, but nowadays they
are doing a good job. And rarely, the connection comes down for me.

I am also using Tata Indicom VSNL broadband but it goes down in every 
20-30 mins in average.
My speed also varies between 60-264 kbps. Mostly less than 
100kbps.(According to package, i am supposed to get 256kbps speed)
Is there any manual configuration, i can do at my level, to improve the 
system?

Thanks & Regards,

I have a similar USB Pendrive problem in Fedora 5 and Windows.

I have 2 usb Pendrives: one from Transcend(128 MB) Works properly.
I have another, a new one(512MB) from I-dont-know-who company.

This gets recognized first..then after a minute or so, the mount fails and I
get a bunch of
"device not accepting address " errors in syslog.

When I touch the USB device, I see its real hot.
But I remember this device working somewhat ok (even though it was very hot)
in Redhat 9.

(In windows, after a couple of minutes this drive is thrown out and get a
usb device removed improperly error.)

So I guess it might be worthwhile to test with a good USB pendrive and
confirm if things are ok with that. The issue being with the device and not
with your Drivers.

Solving a problem using recursion, though elegant, can be a hog on the
stack. At least one book on data structures/algorithms suggests that after
solving a problem (which is recursive in nature) it is advisable to
reimplement the recursive part in a non recursive way for the sake of
efficiency.

On a philosophical note: all of life is recursive at some level. To find out
more about this read the GEB book (at least the first 100 or so pages -
thats what I could handle :-) )

Hello LUGies,

Thought of sharing this interesting mail with you all. Here is Linus 
Torvalds, informing the kernel update on the sidelines of 'Talk like a 
pirate day'. Hope most of you would have read this one, but I got this

Ahoy!

She's good to go, hoist anchor!

Here's some real booty for all you land-lubbers.

There's not too many changes, with t'bulk of the patch bein' defconfig
updates, but the shortlog at the aft of this here email describes the
details if you care, you scurvy dogs.

Header cleanups, various one-liners, and random other fixes.

Friends.

today i found a nice podcast site on linux
www.linuxreality.com

it is nice.

Why cant we record our thoughts on linux and
host podcasts on chennailug server?

If the podcasts were in indian english, or tamil
it will reach more and more rural students.

Do you know what download speeds the students or
people in rural places get?

Next time you visit a rural village in India, try
opening up any .html webpage on a dial-up connection
(say BSNL). It will be *pathetically* slow (in the
order of minutes). I have seen this in the outskirts
of Tiruchirapalli, Karaikudi, and Erode. So, you can
imagine how much time it will take for any CMS to
load.

Why rural village, go to any town and use the Internet
connection and see it to believe it.

Your idea of having speeches recorded is good. But,
the methodology to spread it would be to burn it in
CDs, and courier it to towns/rural villages.
Professional courier is very much affordable and it
reaches remote places in few days time. Cds4grabs
(temporarily down in chennailug wiki) is a good
example.

Hi .
> Which Internet connection do you use and from where?

i use bsnl broadband in chennai.

Yes. i know the speeds of net at rural places
as i came fro kanchipuram.
The dialup kills there.

But, if we start podcasting in tamil or easy english,
we can get them in CDs as u told.

Or even we can have videos, talks, interviews with
senior ilugc members.

we have enough knowledged people.
If the talks we give to colleges and public are recorded,
we can give those CDs to rural people.

They can also get in touch with linux.

Pathetic, agreed. The same might be of their exposure to "podcasts".
So, the target audience cannot yet be internet-dependant ppl in
rural/township areas.

On the other hand ,most of the colleges have decent internet
connections(i believe). So, any introduction at college meets can push
the word through and without too many internet woes.

If you have to particularly target the not-so-connected sector, yes.
On the other hand there are so many ppl in the cities, maybe
subscribers of tech podcasts and maybe without too much exposure to
linux. (I know quite a bunch like that!). The idea can atleast impress
upon them, can't it?

It depends on whom you are refering to as colleges. In
Chennai city, there are mostly Arts and Science
colleges, and I haven't worked with them much to know
about their Internet connection. Maybe an Arts and
Science student in this mailing list can shed light on
the connection and speeds.

Most and all engineering colleges are in the outskirts
of Chennai. If you go down south, they are again in
the outskirts of a town. It doesn't matter because the
Internet speeds aren't very different between towns
and rural villages. They are slow.

> On the other hand there are so many ppl in the

The OP was targetting students in rural places.

The other approach would be to broadcast the podcast!

Anna University, Chennai has on-campus radio
broadcast.

Kongu Engineering College, Erode also have their own
FM radio station. 

Cheers,

SK

Dear Luggies

I have configured squid such that every user has to type in the password
before using it as a proxy. But squid does not accept the user name and
password given even though I have created a list of users and passwords.
The  prompt for username and password appears but when i type in the
password and username it does not accept. Am not able to figure out where i
am going wrong. Any suggestions.

Hi,

Sorry for the delay getting back to you on this - was out of action
(unwell) for most of last week.

In terms of the kind of help we may be looking for, basically anything
you could offer in the following areas would be useful; I can provide
more specific details as needed...

1) Help in locating a linux system administrator for the new center
   (we may need some advice on 'appropriate' skill levels, salary
   expectations etc for that sort of position, also perhaps in
   distributing the position description through your networks).

2) Could use some advice on any system administration/training
   documentation in Tamil language (if such things exist), and perhaps
   some help with system administrator training down the line.

3) Help in locating suitable educational applications for a Linux
   platform (possibly with Tamil variations if necessary; I know a
   couple of your members expressed interest in helping with this sort
   of development).

4) Further down the line, perhaps a bit of a demonstration as had been
   suggested for last Sat. I think it may be better if this happence
   once the new center opens (hopefully a couple of months from now).

UCH address is as follows:

  Uluru Children's Home & Uluru Health Care Centre
  No 1, Kamala Avenue, off Alamparai Beach Road, Kadapakkam
  Cheyyur Taluk, Kanchipuram District 603 304

Right now there are 32 children, aged from 2-14. This is going to grow
to about 80 by the end of the year, by which stage the new center
should be functional.

Some information on the children's home:

 http://www.tewfi.org/patasala.html

Some information on the computer center:

 http://www.tewoaf.org.au/compcent.html

Engineers Without Borders also has a "support network" site where a
lot of technical discussion on the project takes place:

Don't you get support for this? 

Are you booting from a 2.6 Linux kernel? The 2.6 Linux
kernels have SATA drivers and they should detect your
hard-disk. In Debian Sarge, you can pass linux26 to
the "boot:" prompt to boot a Linux 2.6 kernel during
installation.

All recent distros do boot with a 2.6 Linux kernel.

Hello Guys:

By the way, I have been talking to some folks about putting together an event, somewhat similar to DEMO [www.demo.com], where we can get some fascinating ideas together on stage with working prototypes and pre-releases, bring the public there, and invite the VC circles there. The demo of the technology , depending on how well it resonates with the audience will give the VC a good perspective on how relevant the product is, and how well the team is capable of conveying their story - which might drive the VCs to invest int hem -, and it will help the small companies which are struggling to get some exposure. 

With a lot of VCs here in India, and news about over-investments all over the place, and sadly all the good companies getting too few notice, it might be something worthwhile.

Chennai could use an event like this, since the whole technology space really does need a boost. If it does pick up, it has potential to spawn, just like barcamp or whatever. It cant be an unconference, as there has to be a set of entrepreneurs and VCs (I am sure TIE will be happy to be part of it) to screen the technologies, and make sure that the pitches are compelling enough and help them brush up, but it could be fun neverthless. 

Your thoughts?

Vijay

PS: Both the unconferences, Blogcamp and Barcamp have been organized by the same team, and there is a fair bit of initial interest with this as well. If you know of any companies based in Chennai, in and around India, keep them posted.

So did you include mod_perl in the server configuration?

As far as I know, MS Word doesn't do anything of that sort. Similar to
any word processor, it maintains a set of "properties" for each
document created, but that is hardly anything worth reporting.

Tsk, tsk...  Word stores a *lot* of hidden metadata about your
document.  If you enabled Versions or Track Changes, deleted text
can be recovered from the document, along with the time of edits.
If you use any form of collaboration, all the names of your
contributors are also shown in the document.  Even enabling Fast
Saves creates hidden information.

I remember recently someone at Microsoft releasing a public
statement on their website in word format with all the hidden
text still present.  Maybe they forgot to use this:
   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=834427

That is the way the said feature is -supposed- to work. What help is a
version control system; if it cannot let you revert to an older
version?

Ditto. See above.

Yep. Microsoft provides a tool to remove such information if you so desire.

The point I wished to make is that the information is required for the
features it provides; I really can't see how a document preparation
system can offer version control as a feature if it doesn't store
information about previous versions.

Anyway, I never circulate Word documents, I rely on PDFs.

Noted.  The point I wished to make is that the presence of
this information should be effectively communicated to the
user.  Removing this information should not require you to
download/use some obscure tool.

In the real world, every Word document I receive, has all
kinds of sensitive information attached.  And the senders
are oblivious to it. Not a great thing for business
correspondence.

We better stop this MS debate before the GNU Police shoots
us down :-)

try RHEL 4.0 U2 (update 2)
the base install doesn't come with SATA support. or try something like
FEDORA CORE 5. it supports lots of SATA chipsets.

Actually my classmate used to make really cool T-shirts in my college days.  He was a great artist and he could convert really any drawing into a T-shirt. I am sure if you ask Kumar Appiah he may guide u to someone in IIT who does something similar. 

If someone can share how an image can be ironed out to make a T-shirt it will be great. :-)

Thanks.

you need to get 'decal' paper, localy known as 'sticker paper' from  
any stationery shop, print the image on it and iron it onto the t- 
shirt. Go to a stationery shop that sells screen printing and offset  
printing supplies

Interesting. But it took me about 5 minutes to finish reading the para

understood :-)
My mother tongue is Tamil. But kind of been affiliated with Hindi,

Scan a high resolution image in and print it on tshirt transfer paper -
any large konica lab in the city will do that.

Some tamil content about the gpl and copyrights.  Nothing you haven't

Dear friends,

     This is an article I wrote some time ago specifically for a non technical audience. I got good feedback. So I am sending it to you hoping that you benefit. 

     Please please dont start a flame war on this. :-)

     If u dont like it, just press the d key.

     regards,
     Girish


Hello,


Here I am sharing with you certain highly effective practical ways to save money.  I use only free software. So none of the tools I speak of cost any money!

1) Tape recorders, music systems etc. are dead or are at the verge of extinction. If you are buying something new and
you already have a cassette player at home or if you don't have any cassettes , then don't even touch a cassette with
a ten foot barge pole. There is also no meaning in shelling 10,000 rupees on some fancy music system. Your computer can
do a much better job than any other device. Or get a cheap CD/MP3 player . Now the  real  magic lies in the fidelity/frequency
response/power handling capabilites of the speakers.

Money should be spent only on speakers. The audio processing better be done by a computer or a portable device with a
DSP chip like portable mp3 players.

It is not prudent to rely on computers completely for music since they may crash and boot slowly and are an overkill if it is not on. So get a tiny portable device and connect powerful speakers with amplifiers.

There are several creative things you can do with the computer that no off the shelf component in the market can even imagine.
a) play songs in any order
b) play songs in random order
c) delete and introduce songs from anywhere
d) download songs from the Internet
e) schedule to play a song at a particular time or stop at a particular time
f) play the song at double or half the rate

Also you can buy any CD and rip it to convert the audio into mp3,Ogg Vorbis or flv format. CD are notorious for getting spoilt.
Also CD is dead technology. Buy DVDs for anything; that is the future.

2) For new purchases , please dont't go in for CRT monitors, those bulky thingies that look like old television sets. :-)

LCD monitors have become very affordable these days. LCD technology is digital, consumes very little power, occupies a fraction
of the space, has excellent resolution and durability.

The comparison is something like the difference between transistor and valve tube or between electric bulb and tubelight.

Only problem is viewing from a distance or from an angle, viewability is affected. But things might change anytime.

I guess it is also easy on the eyes which is very very important.

3) Present day television technology is soon dying. Modern TVs will have two important changes. First it will throw away CRT tech and go for LCD monitors. And the television signal decoding is going to be done digitally with the end result that new TVs will have very little
similarity with what you see today.

I view television on .. yes, u guessed it right, on my computer screen. You can buy a very good PCI TV card for around 1200 bucks.
And immediately a whole new world opens before you.
You can
a) record TV shows
b) schedule TV recordings and time shift with which you can fast forward and rewind television
c) You can sit at one foot distance and watch
d) Eyes won't get spoilt one bit bcoz PAL refresh rates are 50 Hz and most modern day computer monitors easily do around 85 Hz. And the resolution of the computer screen is an order of magnitude higher than that of TV. With the result that you enjoy the experience with such surrealism and also you can do other things with the computer while watching television.
e) Of course you can take snapshots when your favourite stars appear on screen
f) Many TV cards come with an in built FM tuner too! You can listen to FM radio, record it, do whatever
g)There are countless other things you can do like streaming the TV signals to another computer or monitor in some other room

External TV cards are available but I don't think they are worth the cost. If you already have a TV at home, still buying a TV card
is worthwhile since you don't want to miss the next episode of Selvi if you want to drop your son at the bus stand,Do you? :-)

But I think the real payoff is in terms of preserving our eyesight. LCD screen computer monitors give u such clarity and they are so soothing to the eyes...

Along similar lines you can easily switch over to next gen television tech like DVB, DTH, HDTV etc. Already cheap TV cards support these things. But alas, only DTH has free to air channels in India today. And you need to also buy a small dish antenna. And pay for
the set top box.

4) Want a home theatre ? No problem. My solution will cost only 1/10th or less. :-)

First of all here, the main components are the six or so speakers placed appropriately on the room. The acoustics of the room has to be taken into consideration. Things like carpets and curtains to absorb sound, supress echo and promote only the requisite reverbration is reqd.

The other two components are a projector and a ... yes again , a computer that decodes DVD and TV signals. This can be a box too.

With these individual components one can easily come up with a much better home theatre for around 35,000 instead of two lakhs or so.

5) Present day radio still has lot of fastination with the masses.That too with the creative, informative programming being done in Chennai FM channels, radio has become an unalienable part of everyday life.

FM and to a small extent AM radio technology though ancient , unfortunately or should I say fortunately also are dying albeit slowly.

Already technology is available that uses the present day electromagnetic spectrum allocation done in various countries to air "Digital AM" which uses high fidelity audio in AAC format that give you not only audio, but also display text about the song being played, allow some interactivity along the lines of "dial a song" thro' the radio itself. Of course this is a distant dream since this requires both transmitter and radio receiver technology to be completely changed.

Today FM radios are available for 100 rupees or so. Very good value for money. Once you connect it to speakers you have very high
fidelity stereo audio.

6) Want new jazzy ringtones for your Nokia mobile? Ask me! :-) You can make it in no time with linux based tools. Get me the song
and I will make the ring tone in no time.

7) Wireless technology has also come a long way today but this mostly applies to laptops and I don't know much about it. Wi Fi,WiMax and what not have a great future.

8) Wanna call friends abroad? Use VoIP technology. Go to www.skype.com or www.voipbuster.com. Download the free software,
buy regular phone numbers in most advanced nations for free! Only condition is u shud use Win XP or for skype Linux or FreeBSD.

I have spoken to several countries for hours without spending a single rupee. On one end is ur computer, on the other end is a telephone.

9) The best DVD player is your computer again. :-)

10) You can do several other things. The sky is the limit the moment computing power is at your disposal. You can become completely self sufficient and self reliant. If you want to publish a book ,all the tools are available for free. If you want to do image processing, reduce the brightness, apply red eye correction, make a photo album, change the background, create a group photo etc. all these can be done with free software tools.

You can record your voice, songs or music if you are good at singing or playing musical instruments and release a CD with cover design done all by yourself with a computer.

      "Doctor, doctor can you please tell me what is wrong with me?"

Nasrudin considered for a moment and said,

      "You are wearing too much makeup. You should reduce it. And you will look much better if you shed few kilos. By the way the doctor lives across the street."

Are you sure this is legal in India? Though people do it, if you don't
use something like PhoneWala, a company which has paid license for
VoIP use, I thought you shouldn'y use these.

Sorry! I am not involved with these activities! You can approach those
doing Saarang/Shaastra T-shirt work to see how they get things done,
but those are by the thousands, unlike your/our requirements.

The Wikipedia article on VOIP, Legal section, has this:

"In India, it is legal to use VoIP. But it is illegal to have VoIP
gateways inside India. This effectively means, people who have PCs can
use it to make a VoIP call to any number. But if the remote side is a
normal phone, the gateway that converts VoIP call to POTS call should
not be inside India."

Remember that companies like Yahoo, MSN, Rediff etc. offer VOIP
services via their instant messaging software, and also have Indian
presence.

hi,


 try search on sourceforge or freshmeat. you can also
look for opensource database implementations as they
commonly use B trees or its variants to build an index
for effeciently searching huge databases.
  Its not too hard to code it up either if you have
the time and patience :-)

Introduction to Algorithms by Rivest,Coremen and
Stein,PHI is another book you might like to look at.

this translation is completely unacceptable. For example in the very  
first few sentences you have written this:

???????????????  
????????????? ???????  
????????????  
???????????. ??????  
???? ??????? ??????  
????????????? ???????  
????? ??????. ???? ??????  
GNU General Public License ????  
?????????? ???????????  
?????????????  
?????????????  
??????????????,????  
???????  
??????????????????.

in english:

The patents for software take away its freedom. Therefore it is not  
possiible to change or distribute it to others. To prevent this, the  
patent called the GNU General Public License permits the distribution  
and changing of free software.

but the same lines of the GPL reads:

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

I have translated the word ????????????? as  
'patent', I am not too sure what it means, but it doesnt  mean  
'license'. Is a driving license called a  
?????????? ?

and version 2 cannot be translated as ????? 2

Please dont murder the GPL

in english its a different word. but in tamil, same word which has got
different meaning in different context. if u know any equivalent tamil
word for patent and license, please do let me know

[bala]
i am not murdering it. i am aiming at making GNU GPL more clear for
the people who cannot understand english (sometimes i am also). if u r
interested in saving GPL, please do help me in translation because i
am aiming for it. and thanks for your comment and i am now seriously
looking at the sections you had told.

Note: people who cannot understand english i meant people like my
father who studied in tamil medium and now struggling to use windows /
linux because its all mostly in english.

Thanks. So, if you call up a phone outside, the gateway which does the
conversion from IP to PSTN should not be inside India...

Someone told me that call centers use only linux. I think that makes sense bcoz you would want to cut costs where it hurts the most; telecom.

Today you have entire EPABX in software itself that will make the most expensive solution hang its head in shame. Google for Asterisk and you will know what I mean.

ISTM you will have to buy the appropriate card from Digium and setup Asterisk that will route your calls either thro' PSTN or VoIP.

Apropos of VoIP you have skype that runs very well on linux.

Others should add to whatever I have told here.

All the best!

Girish

No. If you have the disk space, there is no harm in having a swap
partition of up to 2GB, though.

> have heard reports saying that one does indeed need it, howmuch ever physical RAM  u have, as it considerably improves performance. how far is it true ? swap partition of what size could be made for maximum performance of the OS ?

Depends on the application you intend to run; and the load the box is
expected to support. Each case is unique, and should be dealt such.

No.

AFAIK, not required. Linux kernel memory management is
pretty good. You can create one if you want to.

Nope. It was only applicable for very, very old

A few years ago, I had access to two unique boxes that
is worth mentioning:

64 CPU SGI, 32GB RAM, 50TB disk and 512MB (yes it's MB)
swap.  The swap partition was there just to keep the OS
and config tools happy and was never used.

8 CPU Alpha, 8GB RAM and 4GB HDD.  When we ran out of HDD
space, we created a RAM disk and stored files on it!!
Ofcourse the machine was never rebooted.  This continued
for a few months, until an infrastructure upgrade brought
us more disk.

It's true that the world down-under is really upside down.

But I can still write an app using .NET/Java, and release it under
GPL giving all the 4 freedoms to my users. For e.g. I use
Azureus, GPLed and written in JAVA.

The SGI tin was at LONI, UCLA.  Looks like they have also added
Opteron and Xeon pizza boxes to their list:
http://www.loni.ucla.edu/NCRR/Resources/LONIR_Computation.shtml

The sad Alpha with its miniscule HDD was at the CS department
at Melbourne Uni.  So much as changed on the CS website that I
can no longer find the IT resources web page.  Back then, the
CS website was hosted on an ancient NetBSD Alpha box that did
not even have enough resources to run PHP3!  Now have a full
blown CMS!  I'm showing my age.

How does it matter? This is a Linux list, not a Free Software list. If
it runs on Linux, it ought to be on-topic here.

In any case, do you mean that if I post a C/C++ question here, I have
to -prove- that I am using GCC to get an answer??

Deja-vu.  See this from a few years ago:

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc/9793/focus=9793


The only thing this argument accomplishes is that it divides
the lug into two opposing camps: those who are okay with
the discussion of non-FOSS topics, and those who oppose it.
(Of course, being a lug, any non-Linux topic is definitely
OT.  There's no debate in that.)

Since we only have one mailing list/forum, it's best that
both camps acknowledge the presence the other and learn to
respect each others views.

Personally, I can tolerate different views and opinions, and
at times I even solocit opposing views.  It is this nitpicking
and intolerance towards others that I find irritiating.

I also find it ironic that while we talk about freedom, the
moment someone has an contradicting opinon, they get slammed.
Jeez...

I do not want to get into this particular argument. :-)

However I want this clarification as it is extremely imp for me.

My questions are specifically these. Please feel free to advise.

a) Are folks only interested in linux, GPL, blah blah blah? Or is it ok to talk about open source and free software? Bcoz I know that most of you know BSD and are very interested in it. For me personally UNIX is all I care. 

b) I do not think it will be a good idea to divide this list further down into kernel list, hw list, bsd list, linux list etc... 

That being the case is it considered awkward or unacceptable to bring in these topics as and when the situation warrants?

regards,
Girish

There's a patch out for that already (try plugging that error into
google). Or go straight to 2.6.18 - already released.

AFAIK, this is not violation. LGPL is not viral. If the company has used 
GPL libraries, they are clearly violating the licence.

You can use LGPL code and not liable to publish your code as required in 
GPL.

``Google'' with its Do No Evil paradigm also released their Linux
version of Picasa with a modified version of wine. and Picasa is not
Open Source. Google also in the process submitted a number of patches to
the Wine Project (http://code.google.com/patches.html).

AFAIK, GPL implies that any application which modifies or even links to
GPLed libraries will have to make that application GPLed too. Whereas,
what LGPL states is that applications can link to LGPLed libraries and
remain closed source, however, If they do modify the LGPLed library
itself, they will have to show the modifications made to the library.

   I'll second the recommendation of 2.6.18 - it was a drop-in
replacement for my previous 2.6.16 and FC4 userland, and
everything just worked painlessly.

   It also subjectively seems better for DVD playback - xine
seems to drop fewer frames, even on a PIII/500 notebook
running on batteries. Check it out.

   On another note, I'm no longer going to upgrade to FC5
and all future Fedora releases - FC4 already meets all my
requirements for the foreseeable future. I may selectively
rebuild SRPMs and install RPMs from future Fedora releases,
but only on an as-needed basis.

I recall that Transgaming forked the old BSD licensed Wine, and not the 
current LGPL'd one...

Two responses:

1.  Keep your OT volume low:
Unlike this recent animosity, in the past, this list has
been fairly tolerant towards OT discussions. Only when the
OT volume has gone too high has it been discouraged.

2. If you want others to tolerate you, you must first
learn to tolerate others:
Like how Unix is all you care about, there are people here
who only care about Linux.  If you create your post with
this understanding, and take care not to offend these guys,
you can almost get away with anything.


Your wild statements -- academic projects are bad, Tanenbaum
is a loser, OpenBSD/Debian have silly ideologies -- are all
insensitive, offensive and hurtful remarks.  Those who are
associated with these people/projects will feel assaulted
and hit back.

The real damage is that you will lose all credibility with
those who matter.


> b) I do not think it will be a good idea to divide this list further down into kernel list, hw list, bsd list, linux list etc...

Yes.  And that's why we have only one list.

swap slows things down - even if you have a swap partition, keep it  
off until your system slows down - even with 512 MB RAM i keep swap  
off until the ram is really overloaded

1 x physical RAM is best

as far as I am concerned, anything that has a foss aspect is  
acceptable. Including questions regarding how to run foss software on  
doze. But i am not happy with questions regarding closed software on  
foss platform. I feel we cant answer such questions here.

On the other hand, for the BSD etc. discussions, there are specialized
lists available out there. www.bsd-india.org offers a bsd-india list,
for example. This list ought to be about Linux, irrespective of Free
or non-Free Software.

The moment you allow one type of OT discussions, you are past the
point of no return; the only way forward is to destruction.

You are saying that this list should behave not like a Linux list, but
like a Free Software list? Then rename the list as ifsugc. As long as
it is ilugc, it ought to be about everything related to Linux.

The wiki is down temporarily. The contents are being moved from the old

Message-ID: <a8f990120609240207m3e879710n3b68b501e628cd91@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,
         By now, we've all heard of Sony OEM batteries catching fire
and exploding in Dell, HP and various other notebooks. Here's an
example of an IBM Thinkpad 600 (perhaps 8+ years old), belonging
to Alan Cox, catching fire from a replacement battery.

http://zeniv.linux.org.uk/~telsa/boom/

Any new Li-Ion battery today is suspect, due to materials contamination.
Perhaps there's a good case for sticking with old batteries as long
as possible, and subsequently to run the machine off AC mains alone.

There's going to be widespread nostalgia for NiCd and NiMH batteries -
their only problem was the so-called memory-effect that sometimes
occurred when partially discharged and then recharged again.
I have a few that are over 10 years old and going strong - including
one in a Thinkpad 760xl, predecessor to the Thinkpad 600 (That was
the last Thinkpad that I purchased - I switched to Toshiba and Dell after
that, with no battery-related issues yet - all running on their factory-
original Li-Ion batteries still).

Wonder why you marked it OT.

If a process exits, the threads also die. Remember a process is defined by context and the most important aspect is its address space. A context has several components like contents of Ax,Bx,Cx,Dx regs if it is x86, signal mask, state(running,sleeping etc.) , stack etc...

Now, each thread has a lightweight context associated with it, the most important thing here being its stack. 

So when a process is divided into threads , basically the global process context is split into diff threads. All of them map to the same address space.

If you try to access memory outside the bounds of the address space allocated to the process, a hardware trap is generated by the MMU.

Now, the moment a process dies, its address space is removed from the MMU and all page tables cleared of its existence.

So there is no room for any thread to run. Essentially I mean that thread's context has to be stored somewhere, if it does not have an address space mapping where will it go?

Remember I am only talking of user space threading. Kernel threading is a different ballgame.

This is a deep theoretical topic and my memory certainly is rusty. Maybe u shudnt trust my words much. :-)

Best,
Girish

PS : I think some student will do a much better job than me in elucidating this

Ya, I am also on the same thoughts initially,
but when I thought about Unix/Linux threads, Unix clones a process to make
thread, and this may share memory or it may not share memory,
in this case, if the parent thread (process) is killed, will the cloned
(thread/process) continue to exist?
I remember reading somewhere that in Solaris, even if the parent
process/thread is killed , the child process/thread can run.
Even I am not sure if this parent child process is the same as parent child
thread.

Please throw some light on my doubts.

Yes, we can  certainly help you out. But I need some technical details. Is that modem a USB only modem? Does it have an ethernet port?

If it has an ethernet port, then buy an ethernet straight cable or BSNL should give you one, and you are done.

If it is a USB only modem, then it is more work. 

Contact me offlist if it is a USB only modem.

No. Its not a violation. Wine was historically under the MIT license 
which is similar to the revised BSD license and allowed proprietary 
modifications. Wine switched to LGPL because many commercial

Any relationship with the subject of the thread? Posting a job opening
in .NET is _not_ acceptable by any standards in this mailing list. And
there ends everything. Things like changing the name of the list/Group
is a long before debated thing. Bringing this topic again and again is
not going to help anything. If there are people who want to know more
about non-FLOSS technologies there are several thousands of mailing
lists lurking around on the World Wide Web and I recommend you guys to
join there too.
Request to _stop_ it here.

Thanks and Regards,

iitm has a similar machine that is almost five years old. i dont know what the
swap size is, and the disk capacity is probably less, but thats not my point.
iitm will likely give away the machine for a deserving cause.

And why not? One of Free Software's poster boys, Miguel de Icaza, runs
a project whose goal is to have .NET on Linux. Another initiative from
the FSF has the same goal. Icaza himself wants to see GNOME
implemented in .NET:

As far as it has a relation to Linux, it should be on-topic here.

RAID is for multiple physical HDDs only.  No point in running
*any* RAID setup using a single HDD.

It is possible to do it in FreeBSD with gstripe(1), gmirror(1) and friends.

But I doubt if you would want to install it just for RAID on one HDD...

I frankly don't know the logic behind doing it. I think there are ways and means of figuring out when your disk crashes as it usually dies a slow death. There are tools that tell you that the patient is about to expire.

And you can save your data. HTH.

runs/related to linux should only be discussed here.

PII PIII are all processors; not motherboards. Your mobo would be named
something like i815, i845, etc. if u use intel.

The only safe answer is to check with your MB manufacturer's website
and see if they offer an update.

There are plenty of bios hacking applications (for AMI, Award, etc)
using which you could patch/modify your own BIOS.  You could pull
off the bootup code detection module from an update BIOS version
and apply it to your BIOS.  Needless to say, you would be voiding
warranty and possibly breaking a number of EULAs in the process.

Check with the LinuxBios project and see if your motherboard/chipset
is supported.

Warning, warning:  Attempting BIOS programing without an EEPROM
programmer is a sure way to brick your motherboard!  If your BIOS
chip is soldered on the motherboard and is not removeable, then
the slightest error will render your board useless.

I think GRUB supports USB booting, so a floppy/CDROM with the
appropriate GRUB would also solve the problem nicely.

Thanks Raja and Rajagopal.

I should say very very insightful.

Raja's grub advice seems to be very attractive. If that works I will throw a party to Raja. :-)

Not sure about that because I have received response to this posting already.

We prefer people with exposure to Linux/*BSD even if it is for programming
on platforms like Java/.NET because typically these users have more than a
passing interest in computer science and have better grasp of computer
fundamentals. They also tend to have a more inquisitive mind, and a
tendency to not shy away for experimentation which are both desirable
qualities in an engineer. Most of our computers dual boot windows and
linux.

On a related note -  If you want to be taken seriously as an analyst and
if you want to make an informed decision on the choice of technology to
best address a problem a client is facing, you must be familiar with
atleast two platforms - the platforms may be Linux + Windows, FreeBSD +
Windows etc.

The same applies to technology as well - in terms of the type of people I
look out for, I prefer those who are comfortable with atleast two
platforms - .NET + Java, C++ + Java, Java + PHP etc. I vastly prefer those
with reasonable skills on multiple platforms and expert level skills in
atleast one platform. That explains how this job was posted on this
mailing list.

Also, I will wager that there are multiple people on this forum who have
programmed for the .NET platform, and perhaps many more who have
programmed for Java. I have programmed professionally on all three - .NET,
Java and in C/C++ for Linux and ofcourse PHP.

Thanks,
Prem

Hmm, hard luck. It turns out grub uses BIOS drives for identifying bootable devices. So if BIOS cannot see USB, then grub can't either.

Message-ID: <d6e7f37f0609242322k4ba64510w197235c4e16da424@mail.gmail.com>

Hi friends,

iam using a binary installer (.BIN file) which forcefully depends upon
two RPM packages,
     tomcat5-5.0.28-2jpp_5rh
     tomcat5-admin-webapps-5.0.28-2jpp_5rh

There is no possibility of ignoring this dependency since it is binary
package. So, i decided to create a dummy RPM package with the package
name as above. But, i cannot find correct way to create a dummy RPM
package.

My doubt is,
"whether is it possible to create a fake RPM file which can be
installed and uninstalled without creating any files in the host
system?.."

Thanks for ur help.

Ignoring dependencies is probably the easiest way to hose your system.
Why aren't you installing tomcat 5 and getting done with it?

In any case, you can install the package with the --nodeps option to
tell RPM not to check the dependencies.

Didn't realize that you are installing a non-RPM package...

To create such a fake RPM file, first ensure that you have the
rpm-build package installed. Then, save this text somewhere as
dummy.spec:

=== cut here ===
Summary: Dummy Package to provide tomcat5
Name: dummy-tomcat
Version: 1.0
Release: 1
Group: System Environment/Base
License: Beerware
BuildArch: noarch
Provides: tomcat5, tomcat5-admin-webapps

%description

This meta-package fools other packages to think you have tomcat5 installed

%files
=== cut here ===

Now, run the command: rpmbuild -bb dummy.spec

It will create a dummy-1.0-1.noarch.rpm which when installed, will
provide tomcat5 (assuming your software looks at the provides list
rather than the name list).

 From where?
OpenOffice.org contains more than 7.5 million lines of C++ code IIRC.

Moreover, for customising OpenOffice.org, you need not write C++ or Java 
though you can.  They have exposed an interface (somewhat in similar 
lines with Mozilla) for writing extensions on top of it.  It depends on 
what level of customisation you're gonna need.

So, you could choose even JavaScript (or Basic) to write extensions to 
customise OpenOffice.org to your needs.

Would you do that to MS Word for example, where you can't do it?

And have you looked at the openoffice trademarks / copyrights first?

i will respond to the list instead. i have been doing my own reading
up on reply-to munging. yes, i have gone over the two usual documents
referred for and against - both dating back a few years, if i may add.  
there is also enough material on record to suggest that this may be one of
those debian vs. openbsd type of religous wars. note, i did not say
windows vs. linux religous war since we all know in that one which side is
the faithful and which side is the infidel.  but, i have come to a
conclusion and here is an argument that helped me
(http://mlmmj.mmj.dk/archive/0919.html)

we will not do reply-to munging on this list (now).

why? well, i am swayed by the interpretation of rfc2822 which states that 

'When the "Reply-To:" field is present, it indicates the mailbox(es) to 
which the author of the message suggests that replies be sent.'

i agree with the argument that 'the list is not the author of the message,
so the list has no business creating a new reply-to header or worse,
rewriting an existing reply-to header.' message authors are free to post
to the list with their own reply-to headers present and the list will
faithfully carry this in the postings - so, those who believe that
reply-to should be pointing to the list are free to add a reply-to header
at their end which points to the list and postings will appear so. those 
who dont believe reply-to should point to the list need not add any 
reply-to header and the list will not add any either.

of course, we can start our own religious wars here. the list (not me) 
decides which way to go.

IMO, the list the author of the message, even though the text of the
message was drafted by someone else. In this context, author =>
software responsible for injecting the message into the MTA's queueing
system. Thus, if I "Forward" or "Bounce" (f & b in mutt) an email, I
am the author of the message, since my mutt caused the message to be
injected into the local queue. On the other hand, if I had a .forward
or an /etc/aliases entry, I am not the "author" of the message, since
the injection was in continuation to the message being already in my
queue.

That is, the MLM software is to be considered as an MUA.

This is paraphrasing something I read in another list (populated with
really clued people).

I've checked with both and GNOME lists and LKML and they _DON'T_ do
reply-to munging. OTOH, YahooGroups seems to have reply-to munging and
various LUG's have their mailing list hosted on YahooGroups.

The above info is not an argument for munging of the reply-to header,
just my 0.02$

Correction, some GNOME lists have munging. Debian lists however do not.

Both of the above projects operate around 30+ lists and are a good
benchmark for decision-making.

and you can find other lists populated with equally clued people who will 
argue otherwise. i think yahoo groups is one of the influences here with 
their reply-to munging enabled.

This can be debated. I'd like to know why you think of mailman as an
MTA. RFC 2821 section 2.3.3 says:

"Mail User Agents" (MUAs or UAs) are normally thought of as the
sources and targets of mail.

In the case of ilugc, I send the email to ilugc@ae - the target -
which is mailman, and the emails I get have envelop sender set to
ilugc-bounces@ae - the source - which is also mailman.

(It also says:

the implied boundaries between MUAs and MTAs often do not accurately
match common, and conforming, practices with Internet mail.)

First, dont inject new topic into a already thread. please use a new one.

regarding your kernel panic problem...

try using the testdisk and u can correct most(all) of the problems and
also u can recover the data.

Dhana_1,
 Try gnudialer.org or astguiclient.sf.net. I'd recommend the latter , but its only a personal choice. They are both asterisk based. Avoid the asterisk 1.2.11 tree for call center applications. You do not need a NIC from digium or anything for below 30 seats at least. But make sure your timer is set from 250 default to 1000 in a re-built kernel . Use ztdummy with zaptel as a timer and no need for a card. Also, use at least kernel version 2.6.5+ to avoid a  bug in the ztdummy use that will give jitters in the voice.
 Please do mail me if you encounter difficulties.
 Plenty of guys are re-branding these as their solutions and they are very much in the market under various names.
 Regards
 Devafree

Someone told me that call centers use only linux. I think that makes sense bcoz you would want to cut costs where it hurts the most; telecom.

Today you have entire EPABX in software itself that will make the most expensive solution hang its head in shame. Google for Asterisk and you will know what I mean.

ISTM you will have to buy the appropriate card from Digium and setup Asterisk that will route your calls either thro' PSTN or VoIP.

Apropos of VoIP you have skype that runs very well on linux.

Others should add to whatever I have told here.

All the best!

Girish

You can de-select those services from the "Services" application, or use 
the update-rc.d(8) command to remove them.

* Go to System --> Administration --> Services,

* You will be asked for password, enter that (i.e. administrator password)

* Check for httpd/apache and mysqld, stop both the server and click off 
the tick mark next to them.

* Close the window and you are done.

* Reboot to check whether it is not being started :)

Friends.

In my office , i setup  intranet applications using individual apps.

mediawiki, netoffice, roundcube mail, owl dacument management system.
mantis issue tracking system.

To use those application, user have to login in each application.

Is there any nice groupware which has the abouve four things included?

I found joomla, drupal, egroupware, phpgroupware are nice.
But they found not have the above all included.

How do you people manage them?
Please suggest me a nice intranet suite.

Thanks.

some of the suggestion is that
1. use LDAP for u r office.
2. customise all your apps to contact central LDAP for authentication.
3. there are extensions available for each mentioned apps (i guess)

in that way, u have single login id which will be used for all apps.

from our mailing list. we charge $1000 per id for this service.
( visa and mastercard accepted, option available for paypal)

OR

b. You can follow the instructions at the footer of every email

But isn't chkconfig specific to RedHat (originally from Iris)?
I believe update-rc.d(8) works better with Debian than chkconfig.

Wonderful Deva.

Can u plz educate me on how to use it for less than 30 seats? That would do for me. Should I buy a PCI card with RJ11 ports on them? Where can I buy the hardware?

I have been wanting to play with Asterisk for a long time. Please throw some light on what hardware is reqd and I can figure out the rest from man pages and elsewhere.

But I recollect that long before when I looked at it both code and documentation were both very complicated and user unfriendly. I am sure things have changed a lot down the line.

envelop sender has nothing to do with the source of the mail; the envelop sender
is defined as the address to which bounce messages should be sent. this is how
rfc 2821 says it in 2.3.1 "The SMTP envelope is sent as a series of SMTP
protocol units (described in section 3).  It consists of an originator address
(to which error reports should be directed) ... "

now for target, we can stretch your argument to make an MTA into an MUA. in many
mail readers, one can configure how outgoing mail is to be handled. in
particular, one can specify an MTA to which mail should be handed over. does
this make the MTA a target of the mail, then? if yes, then we have just
established that an MTA is an MUA since it is the target of the mail. if no,
then mailing list managers will fall under this category, since it does exactly
what an MTA does in this instance - receives the mail as a temporary target and
then transmits it on to the ultimate target(s). in this sense, a mailing list
manager is never a source or target of the mail. a mailing list subscriber is
the source of the mail and all mailing list subscribers are the targets of the
mail. mailing list managers like mailman are only relay agents and relay is a
role generally associated with MTA's not MUA's.

ok, let me add more fuel to this fire.

we are using mailman for the list. here is a quote from the mailman faq. "The
Mailman developers strongly agree with Chip and Marc, and strongly disagree with
Simon" - chip and marc argue that munging reply-to headers is bad while simon
argues that munging reply-to headers is good. the same faq also states that
"Fundamentally, this problem really should be solved in the MUA" - so, the
developers of mailman (at least the one writing the faq) dont believe mailman is
a MUA.

Besides, all good email clients honor the `List-Post' header, which is
there to specify where the replies to list should go to (if the user
desires so). Finally the user has three choices `Reply', `Reply All',
`Reply to List'. With Reply-To header munging the user has only two
options `Reply all' and `Reply to List'.

Though i believe the list members should decide what they are most
convenient with. Reply All is potentially dangerous option and i am
not in habit of using it.

 I think you are having a wrong idea on the physical networking and CTI. (computer -to -telephony integration). You just use a simple C class network at the minimum. Each agent will have either a hard phone or a soft phone, plus of course a computer. The computers will have one series of natted IPs. Each phone , say if it is soft will have the same IP as the computer naturally. If you need a hard phones for the agents, then you have to get a SIP device i.e, a VOIP gateway with FXS (foreign exchange stations) like an Audiocodes or a Linksys -T 2 port PAP, or a regular stand alone VOIP phone . This device will each have one IP, the multiple ports can be given one per agent. This port alone will be RJ-11. If using soft phones , no need for any RJ-11 at all anywhere. All the computers and the SIP devices go into the switch. Hope it is clearer now, I am sorry I missed the point the prev mail. The SIP devices as you would know are generally used to point at the SIP server of the
 far-end termination provider, who gives us thru our ISP, the service of converting IP packets into the PSTN abroad. Domestic BPO , the set up is more complex; the above is for international call center only, and we are going to point any sip devices at our Asterisk server.
 If you can read 'Asterisk - The future of Telephony - by Jared Smith ' its a great starting point and also great for experts too , as many have said too.

so in spite of the near unanimous request from the group (only one

cant make out if you are for reply-to munging or not, but since you  
are the listadmin of mumbai list which has reply-to munging, i assume

What if the new person manning 'support' does not know the password - which
is likely the case? We have seen a lot of these instances in the past. No
point in teasing such posts. Gives lug a bad name.

Hi,
 
I bought a Dell inspirion 1505 (2 GHz Core duo, 1 GB Ram, 80GB HDD). I
wonder if I could install linux on it, because I know there are some
laptops that prevent installing linux on them.
 
I searched on http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/dell.html and found that
Zenwalk 2.6 & kubuntu.
 
Is that they tried or  is that they are supporting fully (Audio & video
etc....).
 
Please let me know which distribution will be good for my laptop.

Try Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, Dapper Drake. Everything will work in a fly! If its 
laptop, then one of the solution is "Dapper Drake" :D
(Personal experience, I have a *designed for windows* Lenovo N100. Only 
Ubtuntu Dapper Drake worked perfectly amongst the common GNU/Linux 
distros :) )

Ubuntu does work out of the box, but be sure to have both the "live" and 
the "alternate" ISOs handy.

There has been many a cases where the "live" CD installer has problems 
and crashes towards the end of installation process.

The "alternate" CD works like a charm though, and you have an option of 
choosing the classic Debian like text installer.

PS. avoid using your "corporate" mail id for mailing lists.

I got an Inspiron 640m a quarter ago. I believe it is the same as 1405 
which is 1.66Ghz Duo - one step lower than what you have perhaps.

I installed SUSE 10.2 on it. Works fine. Need to get the wireless alone 
working by explicit install and not out-of-the-box.

Message-ID: <20060926175143.26366.qmail@web8909.mail.in.yahoo.com>


We conducted software freedom day in MIT in order
motivate students to get involved in open source
projects and as an free software awareness program on
sep 16th, 2006 at AU-KBC research center, MIT.



The function began by an introduction to open source
software by Mr.M.Satheesh Kumar. His speech is as
follows,

"Open source, roughly means the Linux, firebox,
contributed by nearly 5000 developers across 116
countries. What is open source? OSS is the software in
which the source code can be modified on the
requirement of users and developers. Government is
looking to cut costs associated with proprietary
packages to embrace open source. India's Communist
state Kerala has already logged out windows to avoid
monopoly in operating system and to promote Linux.



Application soft wares will never be free unless
otherwise there is free operating system. Though there
are a lot of Linux distributors Red hat, Suse etc.,
the desktop users still feel hard to use it. The most
famous Linux distributor "Ubuntu" (with the tag line
'Linux for human beings') solves this problem and
offers rich support to the users.



* As we have a lot of developers involved how the
standard of the software is maintained?  Most of the
operating systems like GNOME have its own set of
guidelines to be followed when we modify its source
code.



* What motivates developers contribute to open source?

(1) Developers see software as science knowledge to be
shared

(2) Somebody have the hobby of doing something that's
different

(3) Most of the operating systems have a log file
listing the contributors to code. Some developers find
it desirable to participate in operating systems to
signal their ability.



How open source is used in various domains. We
discussed most common open source soft wares in
networking, electronics and aeronautical.



(1)ELECTRONICS (by Mr.T.Sivabalan, ECE)



-gEDA is used in electronic design automation

-Robotics Darwin2k, is a simulation software

-TKGate

-XCircuit circuit designing



(2)MECHANICAL (by Mr.Kandasamy, Aero)



-VariCAD is similar to CAD, but we can edit at any
stage of drawing)

-flightTR is a flight simulation





(3)NETWORKING (by Mr.Savio Paul, ECE)



Most networking tools and Internet are using open
source, the various application of open source in this
context include,

-ENS, is a network simulation

-NFS (network file system), is used in the networking
of 2 UNIX computers

-tcp dump used for debugging network application and
setup, also for interception

-Wireshark

-Ethereal is similar to network monitor, for capturing
packets, sniffing unencrypted passwords, analyzing
protocols

-dsniff is a collection of tools for analyzing network

-Arpwatch

-snort, which is used for detecting network intrusion

-open SSH, which is open source version of secure
shell

-Samba, helps in the networking of Linux and windows
computers



Mr.Srinavasn, Project Scientist gave a short speech
about open source. He correlated a software with an
electronic circuit without knowing the internals of
the circuit we feel hard to use it or modify it
(imagine that we are given a simple black box saying
it be an amplifier). The free in free software doesn't
mean 'free' in price, it is the 'free' in freedom. The
open source projects are classified as code
development which involves developing the software,
testing in which most of the testing techniques are
used to test the soft wares and documentation for
documenting the operating systems. He wanted the
students to get involved in practicing scilab and
calculix for their experiments.



The function was concluded by a brief speech on
opportunities in open source. Hope this would be a
great motivation to the students to drive them into
open source.

It looks like you are confusing two totally different things.
1. xinetd is a super server that listens for connection on various
ports and based on the configuration files starts a particular service
when there is a request on a port.
2. /etc/init.d is the place where normally the startup scripts live.

Your script 'gsiftp' should probably go into /etc/init.d/ and you
should start it using /etc/init.d/gsiftp reload.

If the system hangs then you should inspect the offending script to
see what it does and probably enable some debug flags to get more
information.

On those lists, i've seen many people using this as the signature line.
``Dont send me cc of your reply. I do read the list!!''

That's what will happen if we get used to reply-all option.

You can probably compile it as a module or use a recent -mm tree which
comes with reiser4 support. You would also need the corresponding
userland tools to create and mange the file system. When I last looked
at it GRUB didn't have reiser4 support. You would be safe if your boot
partition is not formatted as reiser4.

Message-ID: <a54a308e0609261946x6ce86f9dme421d3160f297107@mail.gmail.com>

*Open Source Guru Eric S. Raymond Joins Freespire Leadership Team*

*Urgency stressed as motive in joining Freespire's work to spread desktop
Linux to a broader audience *


*SAN DIEGO, September 27th, 2006 - *One of the co-founders of the
open-source movement has become the newest member of the Freespire
Leadership Board (http://www.freespire.org/leadership). Freespire (
http://www.freespire.org) is a community-driven, Linux-based operating
system that gives users the option of combining free open source software
with certain proprietary codecs, drivers and applications. Raymond,
well-known as both a theorist and an advocate for the open source movement,
joins twelve other Freespire Leadership Board members, composed of thinkers,
business people, evangelists, and key members of the Linux community.

In recent weeks, Raymond has surprised many by speaking publicly about the
"necessary compromise" that open source advocates must be willing to make,
by providing for an easy way for open source software to work with key
proprietary technologies for which there are not yet adequate open source
alternatives. Freespire is the most prominent desktop Linux distribution to
embrace this concept.

Mr. Raymond believes desktop Linux is entering into a critical period,
noting that historically, users have shifted operating systems during
periods of fundamental changes in hardware platforms. He believes the
movement to a 64-bit world will provide desktop Linux a unique window of
opportunity, which if missed, may not come along again for many years.

"Desktop Linux must advance now," said Raymond. "If desktop Linux is to
advance to a broader audience, it must work with iPods and other MP3
players, play DVD movies, view Windows Media and Quick Time content on the
web, and so on. I wish users didn't require these proprietary formats, but
it's naive and unrealistic to expect the masses to forgo these requirements
in the near future. Linux must make some compromises to attract mainstream
users."

Raymond believes the only way to influence ISVs and others to support open
standards and open software, is to attract enough end users to make Linux
too large to ignore. "There simply aren't enough Linux users today to put
much pressure on hardware and software manufacturers," added Raymond. "To
attract more users, Linux must support the popular drivers and file types in
use today. Freespire is the one distribution I see willing to make this
unfortunate but necessary compromise, so I'm happy to contribute to their
effort."

"We are extremely pleased to have someone with Eric's background, experience
and reputation involved in the Freespire project." said Kevin Carmony,
President and CEO for Linspire, Inc., the leading sponsor for Freespire.
"Eric has a keen interest in seeing desktop Linux become more workable with
the necessary codecs and drivers, and he sees Freespire as a good launching
off place for an ideal he and the Freespire community both share; getting
desktop Linux to just work, even if that means providing the option of
proprietary codecs in those cases where there are not yet viable open source
alternatives."

As a Freespire Board Leader, Raymond will help shape the direction of the
Freespire project, along with the other leadership board members, and those
from the Freespire community and technology boards. Raymond's participation
has already begun, including meetings in San Diego.

"Eric has already had a significant impact on our work," said Carmony. "Look
for some very exciting advancements, as a direct result of his active
participation."

*About Eric S. Raymond*

Co-founded and served as president of the Open Source
Initiative<http://www.opensource.org/>,
a 501(c)3 educational organization that builds bridges between the hacker
community and business with the aim of spreading the open-source development
method. A member of the Board of Directors of VA Linux
Systems<http://www.vasoftware.com/>(NASDAQ symbol LNUX), the leading
Linux hardware and systems company. One of
five Directors, who helped steer VA through its record-breaking IPO in
December 1999.

A principal researcher and author, Raymond often referred to as ESR, is the
author of "The Cathedral and the
Bazaar"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar>and
the present maintainer of the "Jargon
File" <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon_File> (the printed version also
known as "The New Hacker's Dictionary"). Though the Jargon File established
his original reputation within hacker
culture<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture>,
after 1997 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997> he became a figure in the open
source movement <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_movement>, and is
today one of its most recognized and controversial characters.

I don't think that munging "reply-to" header is requested unanimously. I
know several other people on the list who don't want "reply-to" header
munging (like me). They are in silent mode because they are tired of the
flame wars in the past on this topic.

I think that the user's freedom of selecting what should be done about
his reply should remain intact. Also the poster's choice of "reply-to"
field should be maintained and passed on. A lot of mail clients do have
the option of "Reply list". When given an option to deal with things in
the front-end level, why to have a workaround at the mail headers?

Thanks -
Praveen.

This affects not only Debian, but all Debian based distros including Ubuntu.

Without any intention to renew this ever-continuing issue, I like just
to put my thoughts again.

If a person A joins Mailing List, then he is entitled to post to the
list. Anything he asks will be to the list and it goes to all the
members of the list. In return, the members post their replies to the
list, which goes to the person A and everyone in the list. I know this
is the normal procedure, but what I mean to point here is that the
intention of the mailing list is to share both your questions as well as
your ideas/replies with the community, i.e. the mailing list.

So, by default you are expected to send the mail to the mailing list.
But, sometimes you may need to go off the list and communicate
personally. When you are in personal communication, then it falls out of
the 'mailing list' activities and its your personal thing.

Hence, the mailing list should have 'send replies to the mailing list'
as the default practice, while a person wishing to mail someone
personally has to go off the list, i.e. it is his pain in the fingers to
type the email id of the person whom he wishes to mail personally.

Thus, 'reply-to' munging is to be implemented, to make sure all the
replies do come to the mailing list. Anyone wishing to go off the list
and mail people personally, still has the freedom to do so, without
affecting the default practice of mailing the mailing list.

P.S. Hope this doesn't add fuel to the quenching flames :D

Urgh, You knwo what happened ? I am actually sending (forwarding) this 
second time, this time to the Mailing List :D ;)

hi,

i don't know why u want to format ur system as reiserfs. u might have
ur own reasons for that. if i were u i wouldn't do that. the reason is
Reiserfs doesn't fully support SELINUX context and breaks down. so if
u plan to run selinux which is enabled by default choose EXT3. esle
continue....

Not all Debian distros.Linspire/Freespire has its own modified version of
Firefox called Lbrowser as the default browser for the OS.

And, if the distro bundles firefox as how it comes, then there is no
violation. If we do change the default things, we need to be carefull.

That is why I said all Debian-based distros.
Linspire/Freespire does not use the name "Firefox", they call it 
Lbrowser or whatever right?

Well, the rest of the list is not clairvoyant. As far as I'm
concerned, everyone who has spoken up is in favour of adding the
Reply-To to the list.

Because a lot of people use email software that do not implement said feature?

Like most of the popular free webmail providers do not have this
option of reply to list.

The way I read that, you are differentiating between "source" and "originator".

MTAs are never the target of any email; MTAs do just that 'T' part of
it - transportation of the email.

Temporary or not, you are confirming what I said - that the MLM is the target.

This is where we disagree. MLMs do not relay emails. They accept
delivery of emails, process the emails (unlike "normal" MUAs, they
don't display the email on a screen, but they still are the recipients
of the email and hence an MUA), and re-inject a NEW email message into
the queue, with different envelop sender/recipient addresses.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks - each list
ought to be capable of taking this decision on its own; and in the
case of ilugc, the vast majority of subscribers seem to favour the
addition of Reply-To to the list. Protocol and RFC arguments
notwithstanding, I really don't see why the list itself isn't
configured as per the wishes of its subscribers.

As stated by many people here, chennai ilug is one of the few mailing
lists which works this way.

Is there a definite advantage in NOT using the "reply-to" header for the
mailing list? If not, I think there is a case for going with the popular
*voiced* opinion on this mailing list in favour of change. As for those
unwilling to voice their opinion ... well, you know how it works in a
democracy...

That is because this issue was never raised in any of the LUG mailing
lists. Most of the indian LUG list members are not even aware that
this is such a relegious issue.

i am afraid your 'vast majority' consists of less than 20 subscribers out
of the approx 1500 that are subscribed to this list. i made an open call
in the list to express a preference and less than 20 people have asked for
reply to munging to be turned on (and an even smaller number have asked 
that reply to munging not be done). pedantically, reply to munging should 
not be done. practically, reply to munging may be more useful. since so 
few subscribers are expressing a preference, i will go with pedantics over 
practicality.

Is it problem with a particular lot of batteries sold ? If so, is there any
way to recognise these with the serial number ?

I use a TP - R51, and these days it really scares me to keep it on
my lap-top. I usually would use a wooden board underneath it :(

weird. dont forget that the said 20 subscribers also provide 90% of  
the activity on the list. I was under the impression that in the foss  
world, contribution is more important than numbers. It is only those  
that contribute that feel the problem of no reply-to munging

>  i will go with pedantics over

which was the reason why our public sector, for example, spent the  
the first 50 years of independance making huge losses and keeping our  
country down. I personaly feel that the inactive majority should not  
be allowed to dictate to the active minority. Imagine listening to  
people who cant be bothered to vote. One suggestion, why dont you  
poll those 1500 people and ask them this question: 'all those who  
want reply-to munging not to be implemented, please reply, failing  
which it will be turned on'. Would you be willing to abide by the  
decision of the silent majority then?

that 'vast majority' also happens to be the ones who write frequently
to the list. they are the ones who use 'reply-to' the most.

I am 'for' setting reply-to to the list. majority of the times a subscriber
would be replying to the list, only in rare occasions would he go for
individual reply. hence to facilitate majority of the occurrences over
the minority ones, in my opinion, this would be an appropriate thing
to do.

Without any offense meant, spoken like a true academic :)

I think your thinking is akin to reasoning that "even though the
opposition candidate won, since the turnout was 35%, we will declare
the incumbent as the victor as he/she is more qualified to hold the
post".

I could suggest a couple of things:

1. Slightly more formal referendum-type voting for the list's
collective majority view. I'm not sure if mailman can do that, but I
think other MLM software can handle polling (Yahoo groups  has the
poll feature). It could be a feature available as a plugin or
something to mailman. This has to be done in a way that each
subscriber gets to vote only once.

2. Since October 1st is around the corner, we could do a one-month
trial of "Reply-To set to list" during October, and revert/continue as
per discussions/feedback on the list during the month on 31/10. This
might be preferable since most list members are not stepping forward
to express their opinions.

fine with me. i was going to suggest a poll in any case and i am not
particular about how it is worded. i dont have polling ready to go on this
server (or any of the servers i have ready accees to), but we do have it
on our chennailug.org site, i think (?). if anyone on the list sets up the
poll and returns the results to me, i will abide by it. we should agree on
a minimum voter turnout - say, 5% (that would be 72 as of now). so, go on, 
set the poll and tell me what to do.

please try to understand why i cannot take action based on twenty vocal 
opinions in a group of 1500.

no, that is stretching it a bit far. if the turnout is 5%, i will be happy
to announce a winner. i have just posted another message to that effect.  
if the turnout is sooooo low, i have to go with status quo - there is no
mandate for a change. 1% of people calling for a change, however vocal 
they may be, is not a mandate.

The problem with third-party hosted polls without access to the
subscriber database (without a well-defined voters' list, that is) is
that they are so easy to manipulate. Remember all those desktop-linux
polls which were allegedly manipulated by overzealous Ubuntu users? A
poll on this particular issue should:

- Have only one vote per list subscriber. First-cast vote counts.
- Only allow subscribers who are active (a thumb rule like at least
one post in the last six months) to vote.
- Not allow disciplined subscribers (people put on moderation etc. for
various reasons) to vote

IMHO, the active part of the mailing list should be considered rather 
than considering the total mass. If an analysis is made over the mailing 
list, around 30-40 people might be posting per month in the mailing list 
and the even in that 10-15 might be the ones who are pretty much active 
and post everyday at least a mail (am on the border of this category), 
even though there are 1500 people who have registered with the list. 
When a practical issue is being considered, such as reply-to munging, 
where the practical problem is faced by *routine* participants of the 
mailing list, considering the totally inactive and non participating 
mass of the mailing list is not welcomed. The rest 1400 (taking the 
count to be around 100, as usual participants) have no contribution to 
the mailing list other than making the numbers to 1500. The 
mere-onlookers are *not* affected by the problem faced (not having 
reply-to munging) by a majority of the participants and especially a 
majority of the active participants.

So, saying "*only* 20 people out of 1500 in the mailing list is asking 
for reply-to munging" is not appropriate. It is *20* people out of the 
normally active/participating 20-30 people of the mailing list, whose 
interaction with the mailing list will be further improved if their 
request is satisfied. Else, the sailing continues as usual, with a bit 
of pain in the fingers.. ;)

i can provide the list to anyone who wants to set up the poll. since i 
anticipate only small number of voters, i was actually thinking i would 
myself (manually) tally voters against list subscribers for validation.

fine with me. i am not setting up the poll, so whoever wants to setup the 
poll note.

no, i dont agree with that. i know for a fact that there are some silent
members on the list who are far more knowledgeable than the regular
posters. and they have been on this list for years. their opinion does
matter.

> - Not allow disciplined subscribers (people put on moderation etc. for

not an issue. we have no such cases as of now.

We require reiserfs on the /home partition as it holds millions of smallfiles less than 0.5 Mb in size; and reiserfs is supposed to be good at performance if one has large number of smallfiles.

i need to clarify here that i require /home partition only to be on reiserfs and not all the partitions and that i needed kernel support for it. we chose to disable SELINUX.

After compiling the kernel module, do i need to recompile mkfs ? to add support for reiserfs?

KM

Why not have an open-poll. I guess we are all mature enough that we
will not vandalize it by creating multiple id's on Drupal just to have
fake-vote's.

I guess Bala can install the Drupal-Poll module :
http://api.drupal.org/api/4.7/file/modules/poll.module and Prof.Sriram
can setup an open-poll on the chennailug.org site.

Bad assumption to make. As per another of Prof. Sriram's post, there
are about 1440 subscribers. How many of those you can vouch won't
vandalize the poll?

Hi All,

Does anyone know who is the authorized IBM Thinkpad warranty service
centre in Chennai? My Thinkpad T41 (global NBD warranty valid till
2007) needs a new keyboard and touchpad. All I have been able to find
out so far from IBM's website is a toll-free phone number.

TIA,

Can we not set up a mailbag, set a timelimit to receive mails with their 
vote in the subject line of these mails. Some one would be able to write 
a small perl or awk program to do the tally, comparison etc with the 
condition of uniqueness being checked. I hate to think your valuable 
time would be spent on such an exercise. I'm not skilled at this and am 
sure it would about an hour's job for some one skilled to write and test 
one such piece of code.

No need. If the kernel supports the file system mount automatically invokes the right file system routines reading the superblock magic.

I think your reqmt is not at all complicated. 

Just run these commands and you are done. Provided you have reiserfs support built into the kernel.

Figure out the device on which you wish to mount /home. Say /dev/hda2

Now, run this. You need reiserfstools package. 

#mkreiserfs /dev/hda2

#mount /dev/hda2 /home

#mount

Now, if you are able to see this line, you are done.
/dev/hda2 on /home  type reiserfs (rw)


After that, just add this line to your /etc/fstab file.
/dev/hda2       /home        reiserfs    rw,auto         0       1

This ensures that everytime you reboot the /dev/hda2 is mounted as /home partition.

You need to RTFM mount to know more, but this shud work.

I have attached my sample run for your reference. HTH.

(But don't do my way, I was just testing :-)

Girish

This is the kind of evaluation errors that cost people their jobs. If
you knew you had a requirement for reiserfs, whatever on earth made
you choose a distribution (paying money for support) that didn't have
reiserfs support?

Alternatively, did you ask your Redhat support guy which filesystem
that they support would be ideal for your requirement?

IIRC, using a custom-built kernel would make your support contract
with Redhat null and void - all those $$$ will be wasted.

Lastly, "supposed to be good at performance" is another way people
lose their jobs by doing scratchy product evaluation. Have you tested
it the performance yourself? Does it play nicely with all the other
device drivers you need?

Well the requirement for reiserfs was known after change of plan; but by then we got RHCE and installed. I would like to tell u that reiserfs support was an optional feature required which we planned to implement on /home recently. that was the reason on earth which made me to choose it:)

yes, I had already worked with reiserfs version 3 (ofcourse i didnnot recompile kernel) and the performance is quite good for small files as against ext3.

Do you have any benchmarks available that shows reiserfs to perform 
better than ext3 in RHEL 4?

There is a plan to add support in gnome-power-manager to detect and

       yes, I had already worked with reiserfs version 3 (ofcourse i didnnot

     Do you have any benchmarks available that shows reiserfs to perform
     better than ext3 in RHEL 4?

I am in no mood to start off a flame war, but would say that this is a
strong statement to make. No filesystem's success can be measured by
the number of distros which use it. For quite some time I have been
using reiserfs (now reiser4) and I am content. It's more a issue of
what the use case is, and the environment in which you want to deploy
the filesystem.

Hi all,

I have problem compiling and installing a kernel for my machine. My 
system configuration is
Acer Laptop with AMD Turion 64, 512 MB RAM.
I have Debian 3.1 installed. I compiled the version 2.16.17.10. It 
compilied without any problems,
but when i gave make bzImage the image got created in arch/i386. I think 
i386 is for intel machines.
Do I have to enable any options for AMD processors to get the final 
image in the properly?
(I have tried enabling Processor type as AMD Opteron).

Still I tried booting the compiled image, but the system is not booting 
up. I am getting only a blank screen.
I tried booting step by step from the grub prompt, there is no problem 
while loading initrd image and kernel,
but when I give boot, the screen goes blank and i could not get any info.

I have compiled and installed the same version in my desktop(PIII 
processor) and it is working fine.
Am I missing something here?  Please give your advice.

regards,
siva.

The most annoying limitation with ext2/3, that is not in reiser,
is that you don't need to specify the max number of inodes during
fs creation.  Reiser is also more forgiving towards fs blocksize
settings.  You don't need to tweak knobs in reiser to produce
acceptable performance for almost all kinds of workloads.

For that matter, Solaris' ZFS looks most promising.

Hi!

Is there any standard location for extensions to store their
changelogs (Or is it mentioned in the RDF, as homepage is mentioned?).
If so, is there any extension that can show me the changes whenever I
upgrade my extensions? Its painful to go to each extension homepage to
find out the recent changes everytime I upgrade from within firefox...

it moves on...

It's the developer's duty to update the "Developer comments" in the
extension-page with the changelog. AFAIK, there's no way to find out
what has changed between versions of firefox extensions.

i am not. that is not my argument at all. please read the rfc very
carefully. trying to argue envelope sender is source of mail is a lost
argument - you have to try something else. the ONLY purpose of the
envelope sender is to provide an address to which bounce messages should
be sent (has been so in good old rfc 821 too). that is what the rfc says.  
it says nothing about where the mail is coming from or where it goes. it
is equivalent to the 'if undelivered, return to' that is used in snail
mail. it may be the same as the sender but it may not be. it is perfectly
within all rfc's to have mail from fred@foo.com carry ginger@bar.org as
the envelope sender - presumably because ginger knows what to do with the
bounce message better than fred. you are arguing that in this case, ginger
is the source of the mail (and not fred) because thats the name on the
envelope sender. except for having the word 'sender' within it, the 
envelope sender may have nothing to do with who is sending the mail.

the only thing this means is that you cant use envelope sender to
associate a source relationship - you have to try something else like
where is the mail actually coming from etc.

and in which case you have just stated that an MTA is an MUA (because it 
is a temporary target of mail that may be sent to it for relaying) and 
anything that is the target of a mail is an MUA.

[etc etc]

MLMs are MLMs. they do some things like an MUA and some things like an
MTA. thats why they are called MLM and not MTA or MUA. and thats why we
will never agree on whether an MLM is an MUA or an MTA.

how 'NEW' is the injected mail? how much of it is verbatim what was 
received by the MLM? envelop sender is a lost argument as above - it 
has nothing to do with sender or receiver of mail. what about when an MTA 
does alias processing? or a primitve 'MLM' that is set up using aliases in 
the MTA? the MTA becomes an MLM. of course, one can do this type of 
aliasing in an MUA too and make an MUA into a primitve MLM. so an MUA or 
an MTA can both play the role of an MLM (to a limited extent). what does 
that prove?

Stable enough for me... but mine is a single-user laptop, and once in
a while (not frequent though) my comp crashes (I have no problems with
that :) ) as I use the latest in the beyond kernel patchset.... I
can't blame it on Reiser4 though... No big time corruptions till date
(I do periodically mirror to an external hdd though)... The free disk
space reported sometimes behave funnily when you have very less free
space (Dunno if this is a bug, though)... Only drawback for me is that
unionfs doesn't work with reiser4... I have to be content with a
slower unionfs-fuse...

> Reiser4 is not into the main kernel line yet.

Hopefully soon... by 2.6.20 (http://kerneltrap.org/node/7153)

> Also would GRUB complain if my /boot was reiser4?

Yes, you would need a patch to grub (unless support has recently been
added). But if you don't want to do (like me), make a small root
partition in something else (I use reiserfs) and make the other
partitions reiser4. (I don't like fragmenting my hdd so much... I end
up wasting space and doing unnecessary copying... So I have a single
partition with all the top level directories (home, opt, srv, usr,
var), mount it at something like /mnt/idata, and bind mount individual
directories to the top level directories)

it moves on...

Hello all,

         I see more people talking about ReiserFS for GNU/Linux. What
are the advantages of using ReiserFs instead of the ext3. Also does
ReiserFS get detected by other OS like the open solaris etc.

OpenSolaris does not detect ReiserFS. However FreeBSD >=6.0 makes
resierfs accessible. And there is a reiserfs driver for Windows too.

P.S all this is for reiserfs 3.6 not 4.0

I guess you may have to compile both kernels with support for each other, i.e, either ext3 and ufs or whatever. If u r comfy with that,then it can be done. But normally these days I dont get in a multiboot situation, I find it a PITA.

Actually the kernels mostly support these file systems by default but sometimes it doesnt work.

It is a good idea however. You can most definitely share swap as well.

But with low disk prices these days I would go in for a file server kind of thing instead.

Can you boot into single user mode and get a console
prompt?

You can edit grub on the fly. Highlight your OS entry
when grub loads and press 'e'. 

Move to the /kernel line and press <enter>, and add
"single" in the end of the line.

Press 'b' to boot this new configuration and you will
get a console prompt. If yes, then your kernel is
booting fine in run-level 1.

Now, check if you can move to run-level 3

  init 3

This will give you six consoles (Control+Alt+Fx,
1<=x<=6). If yes, then the only problem is with your
display driver and/or X configuration.

You can change your default run-level to 3 in
/etc/inittab file :

  id:3:initdefault:

SK

Haven't tried this. will try it and get back. Actually for booting from 
Debian i am passing
a parameter vga=771 to the kernel. I have tried giving this parameter 
also for the compiled one.

Reiser4 is the fastest filesystem in terms of I/O performance.
Source : http://bulk.fefe.de/lk2006/talk.pdf (pages 27,28)

Fefe is well regarded in the benchmarking circles so you can take the
above link as a good, valid source.

On why Reiser4 is not in mainline this page answers all questions.

If I remember right, reiserfs is not included in the main kernel because of
disputes regarding coding style - the relevant maintainer wanting the coding
style to conform to the strict kernel standards but Reiser maintaining that
his style is better than the kernel standards! Not really an issue with the
stability of reiserfs.

<ZFS bigot mode>

IMO, ZFS has far outclassed every other file system in
existence today.  ZFS excels in features, data protection,
scalability, and manageability.

Note that ZFS checksums every byte of data on disk, and
verifies it on every disk read/write.  Inspite of this
overhead, it still blows BSD UFS out of the water in the
above benchmarks and is second best only to reiser4.
Impressive.

Given sufficient interest, at the next lug meet, I can run
through the ZFS design, features, comparison with existing
filesystems, and a hands on demo.

</ZFS bigot mode>

When you compile the kernel, you have to choose the
processor and system type that you have.

In both 2.4 and 2.6 Linux kernels, it will be under
"Processor type and features" when you do make
menuconfig.

The vga=771 will work if the video driver supports
this resolution as per your X configuration file -
/etc/X11/xorg.conf or /etc/X11/XF86Config depending on
whether you are using Xorg or XFree86, respectively.

Hi All
I want to know how to add/mount additional memory in the hard disk without
losing out any of the files existing on a RedHat System.

the 'vga' parameter passed to the kernel during boot-time is the
console-mode which is used by the framebuffer device (if one exists)
and is not connected to CPU arch or Xfree86/Xorg.

I'm guessing you mean resizing existing partions when you mean "adding
memory to hard-disk". Here is a link.

http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/custom-guide/s1-parted-resize-part.html

If you have a single root partition you have to unmount the partition
before resizing it. Consider using Knoppix for resizing it in that
case. If you are not resizing the root partition consider gParted
which is the GUI front end for parted.

HTH,

Hi Priya,

The summary of our "off the list" discussion is as follows. There are
some open questions... which I leave to the community to kindly
complete :-)


1. First attatch the new hard disk to your new server.
1a. How to verify the hdd is detected? -- Please complete

2. Use any partition/hard disk manager (partd/fdisk/gpartd ... any
other -- please fill) to format the hard disk and mount the same onto
some location

3. put your new files on this new folder.

4. if you want to move existing directories to the new hard disk, move
them using "mv" and put a symbolic link to the old location.
Hint: moving the /var folder to the new hdd would give a lot of space
:-) if you are using the server for huge compilations.

Regards,
Natarajan.

err.... but reiserfs 3.6 is part of the main kernel line. Its only
reiser 4 (which has been around for quite a few years now) who has not
be admitted into the main kernel line.

Oh ok.  Had read long back about the politics behind reiserfs and Mr.
Reiser's attitude and just quoted from memory. Did not know there was this
distinction (mean the versions). Anyway, the kernelnewbie.org link could
lead to the latest on this topic.

The link posted by Prashanth (on kernelnewbie.org) explains enough the
reason why reiserfs4 is not in the kernel.

 days back i compiled this kernel and installed that, things went
fine. I dont think u need to make ur bzImage, once u compile every
thing will be done auto, even grub entries(this happen with me)..

make xconfig

make

make modules

make modules_install

make install

since the compilation went fine i think that should work.

There's a lot more to it than meets the eye.

I fear that it doesn't look too good for Hans Reiser - he sounds like a
nutcase at times.

However, I'd say there are numerous suspects in the picture - Sean
Sturgeon, the boyfriend, the Russian Mafia, etc. This is looking like
a full-fledged conspiracy theory case now. The wife could even have
faked her disappearance and vanished to Russia.

Reiser isn't helping his case much by his non-cooperation with the
police.

Message-ID: <154eca020609280901t35f8c831ud4feb12f17792933@mail.gmail.com>

One of my friends is facing a problem with their network, whose
description follows. He is not subscribed to the list - I have
CCed him. Good if someone can help him out ...

<problem>

I am getting the following messages on the console continusouly...
kernel: eth1: Too much work in interrupt, status e401.
We are experiencing packet loss that are going through this system.

Google'ing indicates that this is one of the rarest problems and
doesn't seem to address the exact error. One indicated to increase
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_conntrack_max value... changed it from 32760
(defalut) to 65520 (doubled it as it was not accepting any other
values). Still no help.

There is a file /proc/net/ip_conntrack, the file size is 0 bytes but
when I cat that file shows about 15000 entries like

tcp      6 19 SYN_SENT src=192.168.1.66 dst=9.121.32.211 sport=2382
dport=445 [UNREPLIED] src=9.121.32.211 dst=220.227.67.130 sport=445
dport=2382 use=1

Looks like iptables cache... I suspect clearing this would help..
but I dont' how to.

Hardware: duel PIV, 512MB, RAID5
Services: iptables firewall,  postfix
Network configuration: two NICs - eth0:public ip provided by ISP,
eth1: LAN IP.

Unless you're using something that's really a high traffic application -
tried changing the ethernet card on that machine?

Tried this too, result is the same. Once i give the boot command, the 
screen goes to blank.
The System LED is blinking and I capslock key is working. I waited for 
some time to
check whether i could go to some other console with Alt+Cntl+F1, but 
could not.
If this is a display problem? What else can i do?

It would be nice if we can have a look at your
complete .config file at any server, or pastebin.com.

Also post your grub entry contents.

Hi all,
   
  I want to install Fedora 5, Debian 3.1 and XP on my 80 GB HDD.
   
  I installed XP on my machine.Then installed Fedora 5 with root and swap partitions.No probes in this.
  As of now Fedora and XP works fine.
   
  Then installed Debian 3.1 with new root partition and with the same swap used by fedora.Debian is listing all the three in the grub. 
  Now debian and XP works fine. 
   
  But if I choose Fedora it stops at SELINUX loading stage.
  Should I have to disable the SELINUX before installing the Debian?
   
  On the otherahand if i install in the order Xp,debian and Fedora then fedora replies back with error message it cannot have two root partitions.
   
  Can I have common swap for debain and fedora linux ?
  Is there any specific order to install this?
   
   
  Cheers,

Subject: [Ilugc] LDTP 0.6.0 released !!!
Message-ID: <9d0602eb0609290622n7b70f74er8a2b29fad82ece1b@mail.gmail.com>

Issue IX - 28 September 2006

We are proud to announce the release of LDTP 0.6.0. This release
features number of important breakthroughs in LDTP as well as in the
field of Test Automation. This release note covers a brief introduction
on LDTP followed by the list of new features and major bug fixes which
makes this new version of LDTP the best of the breed. Useful references
have been included at the end of this article for those who wish to hack
/ use LDTP.

About LDTP
==========

Linux Desktop Testing Project is aimed at producing high quality test
automation framework and cutting-edge tools that can be used to test
Linux Desktop and improve it. It uses the Accessibility libraries to
poke through the application's user interface. The framework also has
tools to record test-cases based on user events in the interface of the
application which is under testing. We strive to help in building a
quality desktop.

This release features an all new TCP interface of the server which, is
covered briefly below.

Recording has taken new heights and the code is much organized now. More
bug fixing and documentation changes.

Whats new in this release...
============================
+ Remote TCP based execution
    Tests can, now, be carried out from a remote terminal.  LDTP Clients
can connect to the new TCP interface and run tests with-in the box that
is running the server.  This kind of interface comes handy for testing
applications running in small devices.  This interface is contributed by
"Palm Source".

+ Recording using LDTP
    This new version of LDTP features a recorder tool which would help in
generating automation scripts automatically by recording user events.
This would greatly reduce the time required for creating and maintaining
automation scripts. Thanks to Venkateswaran ('whacko'), Harishankaran
('sp2hari') and Theyagarajan ('Taggy') for making this happen. For more
information on this please refer to
http://ldtp.freedesktop.org/wiki/RecordHOWTO

+ Bug fixes
    This version includes loads of bug fixes to address important issues
like memory leak, API functionality, accessibility compatible issues
etc., For a detailed list please refer to release notes section of our
project site hosted in http://ldtp.freedesktop.org. Thanks to all the
developers for their contribution and dobey especially.

Is there any ETA for the Wiki to be available once again?

I also request maintainers to do something as we badly need the wiki
for updating events. Also several useful writeups like configuring
BSNL connections are pages I routinely pointout to students whereever
I talk about Linux and LUG.

I request luggies who can spare sometime to help the maintainers in
this task. 

If there is some problem in setting up wiki  atleast convert old wiki
into static pages and upload in the site. I am sure there should be
some tool to do this.

Do we know what the problem is ? Tried resetting the root password for
MySql. If the problem is made available on the list maybe solutions
will come up.

Considering your recent "style-update" :
http://www.flickr.com/photos/tuxmaniac/253424318 , I doubt you could
have helped.

OTOH, I wonder if you want GNU/Linux to be attracted to them or
getting them attracted to a GNU/Linux hacker.. :P

Maybe a bit of background information would help? Who is the person
