Hope you will be using a compiler adhering to the principle of this group,
for demonstration purpose. I am insisting this because your topic is
neutral.

Hi,

Topic: Project Euler

Description:

I would like to start a new series in the meet-up where the
participants will be given a task to solve in 10 minutes. It could be
a simple computational problem from Project Euler, or some scripting
or command that we may find useful for our day-to-day work. After 10
minutes, we can discuss the various solutions that people have come up
with. This is to improve our problem-solving, and technical skills.

You can solve it using any of the following approaches:
1. Pen/pencil and paper (can be verified on a system)

2. Laptop/netbook (without Internet connection)
You can install whatever F/OSS software and documentation that you are
familiar with, before you come to the meet-up.

3. Laptop/netbook (with Internet connection during the meet-up)

Duration: 30 minutes

 You are welcome, for now we already have 4 topics for this month. I am
afraid of enough room to accommodate fifth talk. You can attend the meet,
if by chance any of the already mentioned topic slips you can give your
talk.

Kindly include the topic on MBR (vs) GPT partition types also. Since
the higher capacity Hard Disks (above 2TB) does not support MBR
partition types.

Hi,

I am getting the following error while connecting mysql replication over

Using the same ssl key I can connect replication with in aws/rack space
servers.

If I understand correctly you are trying to do replication over two service
providers of AWS and Rackspace.  If that is the case you need to use the
Fully qualified domain name for setting your masterserver rather than "
masterserver".  More over the replication user should have access to coming
from that IP address.

Okay then in your mysql conf file under the client directive did you add
the certs ?

[client]
ssl-ca = path to cert
ssl-cert = path to cert
ssl-key = path to cert

Subject: [Ilugc] Makers Asylum Mumbai- Looking for funding through indiegogo
Message-ID: <CADtvZWDqci2=2zQYAPE-O3T7KFQXBc_8QSoQAHTU9u1q97CW1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

Makers Asylum founders recently put an funding proposal at Indiegogo-
"Save our community MakerSpace in Mumbai"

https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/save-our-community-makerspace-in-mumbai#/story

Requesting all you to do your best to make the Maker's Space alive in
Mumbai/India.

*Story of Makers Asylum Mumbai* -

"We started about two years ago, operating from a closet-sized garage
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ0ZtF5wYFY> in the suburbs. We had one 3D
Printer, power and hand tools that were donated by well-wishers. We had a
handful of members that gathered to build tables, simple machines and toyed
around with electronics. People started to share knowledge and materials to
build projects together."
Challenges

The good part is that we?ve ignited the Maker Movement in India. The bad
part ? we?ve lost the space we?ve called home for the last six months. The
design school that let us use a portion of their cafeteria for our
activities needs us to vacate. We have till August 31.

In order to continue feeding the hungry community of Makers, we need to
find a new space to rent, and soon!

For our community, the risk of losing the space means projects being
abandoned midway, practical learning being put on hold and tinkers left
without the access to tools that make their ideas grow.

ERPNext is opensource.

It is free if you host it on your own server.

WikiConference India 2016 (WCI 2016) is an outcome of Indic Meetup
held during Wikimania 2015. We had a collective dream to bid for
Wikimania 2019 on behalf of India. If we need to run a Wikimania
successfully, it is time that the Wikimedia community in India reboots
itself and works together towards that. Conducting a WikiConference
India first will be a good start towards achieving that goal. This
will help us assess our strengths and plan accordingly for Wikimania
2019. This is our bet to prove our unity in diversity.

You can read more about the Conference at the following link:

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiConference_India_2016

I would request all of you to sign up after clicking the link below:

How? You might want to package your application into a Docker image
and run it. Please search online for simple tutorials.

---
| 1. change the directory to the installed application
\--

In the Dockerfile, specify the above as WORKDIR.

---
| 2. Then execute the command "foreman start -p 80"
\--

This should be the value of CMD in the Dockerfile.

Hi Ajeesh,

                Instead of writing your own daemon service, try
http://supervisord.org/ . It's a process control system and takes care of
most of your requirements and you just need to provide your option in a
config file.

You may try this if your OS supports 'systemd' service

See below.

This would require an "auto" login for a specific desktop user that
has requisite authorization(s) to do the stuff you want the
application to do.  Depending on what kind of desktop (GNOME, KDE,
XFCE etc) you are using, you will have to look up it's respective
'auto' start application(s) mechanism as well.

Message-ID: <CAKLQ04Bj4Ag+dJ6KWOk_ATEcdM8muWcd8=0Jkf-Kz3NELC99hQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
          During the meet - I raised an open question regarding leap
seconds and how
are they handled in DB's. Everyone had our opinions and most of the
attendees
suggested it is taken care by the OS.

Looks like Leap second is handled by DB as well because of the usage
of *now()* function. Found this link interesting
 https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/time-zone-leap-seconds.html.

In recent versions of MySQL - leap second 59:60 is reverted to 59:59 and
because
of this decrement there can be ambiguities in our where queries. For
accurate
query results MySQL suggest using *UNIX_TIMESTAMP(timestamp_column).*

Have discussed queries in this shared document:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/16CNBxIQGMbVoSgbg297h7b8rdr8huirTeb7XVt3PGAM/edit

Leap Second example in the Shared link is from MySQL doc and when I tried
it on my
machine, I found it not working - very recently someone have commented the
same in their official doc - let me know if the example actually works.

 PS: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/functions-datetime.html says
       "PostgreSQL uses UT1 because leap seconds are not handled." Also
Interested
        to know if there are any such MySQL like decrements for leap
seconds in
        PostgreSQL too.

Thanks,
Bala.

Hi everyone,
          During the Monthly Meet - Aug 8-2015 - I raised an open question
regarding leap
seconds and how are they handled in DB's. Everyone had our opinions and
most of the
attendees suggested it is taken care by the OS.

Interestingly looks like Leap second is handled by DB as well because of
the usage of
*now()* function. Found this link interesting
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/time-zone-leap-seconds.html.

In recent versions of MySQL leap second 59:60 is reverted to 59:59 and
because of this
decrement there can be ambiguities in our where queries. For accurate query
results MySQL
suggests using *UNIX_TIMESTAMP(timestamp_column).*

Eg:
  => mysql> SELECT a, ts, UNIX_TIMESTAMP(ts) FROM t1;
  +------+---------------------+--------------------+
  | a | ts | UNIX_TIMESTAMP(ts) |
  +------+---------------------+--------------------+ |
  | 1 | 2008-12-31 23:59:59 |1230767999 |
  | 2 | 2008-12-31 23:59:59 |1230768000 |
  +------+---------------------+--------------------+
  2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

  Querying for the leap second -
  => SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE ts = '2008-12-31 23:59:60';*
     Empty set, 2 warnings (0.00 sec)
     Returns empty set, because it is stored as 23:59:59 as shown in first
query.

  Using UNIX_TIMESTAMP in the condition we get -
  => mysql> *SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE UNIX_TIMESTAMP(ts) = 1230768000;
    +------+---------------------+
    | a    | ts                  |
    +------+---------------------+
    |    2 | 2008-12-31 23:59:59 |
    +------+---------------------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)

  Interesting part is that for 59:59 we get only one result and not the
expected two rows.
  => mysql> *SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE ts = '2008-12-31 23:59:59';*
    +------+---------------------+
    | a    | ts                  |
    +------+---------------------+
    |    1 | 2008-12-31 23:59:59 |
    +------+---------------------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)

I Took this Leap Second example from MySQL doc and when I tried it on my
machine, this leap
second behaviour was not working - very recently someone have commented the
same in the doc.
Please let me know if the example actually works for anyone else ?

Also http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/functions-datetime.html says
"PostgreSQL uses UT1 because leap seconds are not handled." Interested to
know if there
are any such MySQL like decrements for leap seconds in PostgreSQL too.

Thanks,

Please create a new thread of discussion instead of hijacking a thread.
What I mean is: Do not reply to an exiting discussion with a completely
unrelated post while keeping the same subject. Create a new post with a
new relevant subject.

Why? Because it helps those who are following the discussion.

Thank you,

What is that you want to know?

1. Installing spark?
2. Writing Spark App?

There is a very active community around Spark
(http://spark.apache.org/community.html). Take a look at it try connect
with people there.

Message-ID: <CAEw0HbsSOTV976AdDj_10t8DUBHBbTZwYOdFLhvUHVt9-UPmaA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have a doubt in git stashing. Pls help to find it out.

I have narrated the doubt as follows:

Say, first I have some commits in my *master* branch.
Now I create a branch named *new*.
I do some changes in *new* branch.

Now I want to checkout to *master* branch without committing the changes.
So when I checkout, it should show an error for stashing. But no error
occurs, it checked-out to *master* branch.

Actually,
First I have to do a commit in *new* branch. Then I do some changes in a
file. In this case only, when I try to checkout, an error occurs for
stashing.

I don't know why a commit is necessary before stashing.

Assuming that you 'git add'ed all the changed files, after a commit you'll
have nothing to stash! It would help if you post the output of 'git status'
before and after commit and before and after stash.

Its likely that the changes you have made in the new branch is not in an
already tracked file.

Actually I understand the process of stashing.

If we work in a remote repository, this doubt will not arise. But I have
the git repository in my local machine.

When I switch one branch to other branch, if the changes are not committed,
it should show the error "Please, commit your changes or stash them before
you can switch branches".

But in my case that error didn't occur. I understand that without the error
also we can stash the changes.

Actually only this happens when we create and edit any new branches. Once a
branch is ready with some commits, then there is no problem.

Pls try it with your local machine.

I think you will get an error only if there is a conflict between the two
branches.   Let's say there are two files A and B in master.  You create
branch new, change file A,  then try to change branch,  it would let you,
and carry over the changes to the checked out master branch.

But if you have changed file A in branch new, committed it, then changed it
again,  then try to switch branch,  it won't let you because the change
cannot be carried over because the two branches have different versions of
file A.

Sahas

Message-ID: <CACtiFJZQi-dzzHUnWT0uVuwhK11dxHKD9EyOBAQcO1Eqq9bSBA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am trying to access the Coursera course catalog through the following
python program.

http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2015/03/coursera-data-mining/

All required libraries including 'pandas' got installed.

while executing 'get_data.py', I am getting the following error.

Getting Courses Data
Structuring the Data
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "get_data.py.orig", line 76, in <module>
    main()
  File "get_data.py.orig", line 42, in main
    courses_df['course_name'] = map(lambda course_data:
course_data['name'], courses_data)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pandas/core/frame.py", line 1804,
in __setitem__
    self._set_item(key, value)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pandas/core/frame.py", line 1843,
in _set_item
    value = self._sanitize_column(key, value)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pandas/core/frame.py", line 1872,
in _sanitize_column
    assert(len(value) == len(self.index))
AssertionError

I have no experience with Python.  What I actually require is the resulting
data in CSV/TSV format.

Any help would be appreciated.

Download a packaged distribution like anaconda. Way simpler.

The code works in my system that uses python3 with all python packages
installed from the official repos in archlinux. I had to make some changes (

You show initiative. Which is nice.

Pls go through the list guidelines for help on how to ask questions in
mailing lists. These etiquette will always be useful to you. For one, pls
start another thread to ask your questions with a clear subject line.

That said, this is a Linux focussed list. So am not sure you'll get much
help on bigdata here!

Best of luck,
mano

Hey, I changed the code to work with python3 and it works but I don't want
to register for sharedcount service. You can sign up and include your api
key in the source code. Forked repo:
