Dear all

I am using Fedora-11 . I was trying to record sound with a Java application.

This is kill -ell

I wanted to show that  it is not the numeral '1' but 'l' ,English ell.

Anyway you kill a process with this command.

$ kill 3423

to kill the process whose ID is 3423.

By default SIGKILL is sent I think.

You can send any signal from the above list by using

$ kill -HUP 3423

for sending SIGHUP. Just drop the SIG prefix and send.

IcedTea does not have the sound APIs. That could be the problem. Use the
Sun JDK or OpenJDK7

When you cannot kill a process using kill or top, use killall
<process_name> to purge all instances of that process. Often useful
when Firefox says another instance is running while testing web
applications.

$ killall firefox
$ killall opera

To find if the process is running and its process id, use:

$ ps aux | grep <process-pattern>

No, signal ID 15 (SIGTERM) is sent by default.

psof(program_name) does this. Thus we can use kill `psof(firefox)`

Or, one can use:

  $ pkill firefox

Check the pkill manpage:

  $ man pkill

?Hi,

Say you got a spindle of 50-100 CD's and you're eager to share out the
latest karmic koala or fedora 12 CD's or DVD's with your neighbours.
Giving away CD's loose is definitely not a good guarantee that all the
rough handling and the dust will allow the OS to boot up properly. So
is it not possible to also buy 100 CD/DVD jackets.

What we can do is check out an illustrated tutorial like the one at

http://www.papercdcase.com/about.php

and make your own paper CD cases.
You could dig a little to find out, how to have CD graphics printed on
the backside, how to strengthen the case and so on.

Mailing List Guidelines: Monthly reminder:

1. Use a proper subject line.

2. Do not troll in the mailing list

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll

3. Use [OT] for off-topic, non-technical discussions.
But, don't misuse this to start flame wars or to troll
in the mailing list.

4. Do not top-post:

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting

Example of a top-post:

Because it messes up the order in which
people normally read text.

 Bar Foo


5. Do not over-quote:

Example of an over-quote:

>>> On Friday you said
>>> blah blah blah
>> On Saturday you said
>> foo foo foo
> On Sunday you said
> foobar

6. Do not post HTML messages

7. Do not recycle messages

8. Do not send attachments

9. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical legal
disclaimers. If your company uses disclaimers, don't
use your company ID for the mailing list.

10. Do not reply to a digest. (If you are in digest
mode and want to reply to a post use ILUGC Gmane blog
interface.

Link:
http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc

11. Search for answers for your questions/problems in
google.com or any other search engine before posting
your query to the mailing list.

If any of the above are not clear to you, Please read
the detailed list guidelines:

Link:
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

12. Do not post messages in all capital letters. Mails
in CAPS is considered rude and is similar to shouting
during a conversation.

13. Following these guidelines could be helpful
http://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/

14. Don't send season's greetings or birthday or social networking site
 invites to the group. Its not mailing list etiquette.

We must use the above guidelines to maintain better
readability, proper archives, efficient bandwidth
usage, etc.

The original point made by KG is that the translation should NOT be a
literal translation but something that captures the spirit of the concept.
?????? seems to be the straight forward word now, but maybe someone can
think of something better!!

- On my empathy, whenever I get a incoming call, the icon starts flashing,
and if I double click on it, it asks whether to answer the call.
- There was an an issue with older version of empathy, where one would not
hear the ring but the icon would flash, and one needed to click on that and
press start call button.

thanks

What is even more important than capturing the concept is to use words that
are in common usage. KG has stressed this point also. In my experience, I
have seen the word ?????? being used for account(as in user account, both in
and out of a computing context) frequently by tamil-speaking people. Like I
said in a previous thread, new, not-so-used words that capture the concept
better, should be welcomed, but at the same time, commonly used words should
also be mentioned to make it easy for the user.

Hi,
There is a software called the "Internet Download Manager" for windows.
The main functionality (there are also many other functionalities, the most
attracted one is this) of the software is , when there is a video played in
a site like  youtube or any embedded video, we get an arrow mark on top
asking whether to download the video. If we click the arrow it starts
downloading immediately even if the videos are copy protected.
Is there any possibility of creating such a package for linux?
If so can anyone pls suggest me some ideas..

what do you mean by copy protected? Do you mean videos that you cannot
download directly to your disk?

All flash videos will be stored in your /tmp directory as you view them in
browser with the name Flash****

The Indian Bank Tamil site also seems to use the same word. Is it not 
considered to be commonly understood or an acceptable term then?

k now leave the part of "copy protection", if you see a video in any site,
the download manager should ask for the download action/option, is it
possible..?
I'll try to upload some screenshots reg that and i'll send the link.

Message-ID: <7938ae610911011828q6a120f1qb291eb26c7db96fc@mail.gmail.com>

Dearest Luggies,

I am very sorry for not sending language tip yesterday. I was away
from the computer. I shall send today
evening.

gdb is the canonical C debugger. It is not a graphical tool and there
is a graphical front end called
 ddd developed by Germans. But I did not like it much.

gdb comes built in with many many features like bash. It has
completion features and several aliasing
features. For instance you can type

(gdb) list

or

(gdb) l

or

(gdb) li

with the same result.

And it is a very comprehensive debugging tool. Nowadays I don't rely
on gdb much since I use printf()s to
track what is going on in my code.

But gdb is very essential for program development in C.

The most important commands in gdb are (at least according to me)

o (gdb) where

shows the stack trace and it will tell you which sequence of function
calls crashed your program

o (gdb) list

shows you the next 10 line numbers

o (gdb) b main

sets the breakpoint at main. If you have the same function name
declared in multiple source files as static, then
you can say b foo.c:barfunction to specify that you want to break at
barfunction() in foo.c file

o (gdb) step

or 's' goes into the function. Very useful for stepping into functions
after breakpoint.

o (gdb) next

or 'n' goes to the next function. You can skip loops using 'n'.

o (gdb) continue

or 'c' continues beyond the breakpoint.

Debuggers are a big topic. Hope this gets you started.

-Girish

Sorry mea culpa. My mistake.

I had a doubt that I was wrong. Hence the "I think" part.

Thanks for the correction. Much appreciated.

This is not pettifogging. You did the right thing.

I was lamenting to my friends that LUG is full of pettifoggers.

This is a welcome change. Keep it up.

?????? is the correct word for bank account, the doubt is whether the common man 
will get the sense of it when it is used as a word for account on a site. Such 
an account has a connotation of 'membership'. So some derivation of ?????????? may 
be more appropriate.

Could be, but even for things like yahoo account, people are widely using

Not sure what you mean by copy-protected, but the Video DownloadHelper
extension <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3006> for
Firefox will help you download videos from a number of sites.

The answer is in the email you responded to. Use `pgrep`.

Although if you are looking specifically for backgrounded jobs, you could use 
the bash builtin 'jobs':

$ jobs -l

Download Helper has an option to copy the URL, which you can then feed to
a download accelerator like DownThemAll (another firefox addon). This is
helpful if you are downloading large files.

Although DownloadHelper is nice an user friendly, I think i should point out 
that the source code license is not:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/versions/license/76368

I'd recommend an alternate:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2254

or any of the others here with a less offensive license:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search?q=video&cat=1%2C5

(note that some of the tools listed there download and convert using external sites)

Some of the bugs are fixed in the point updates of GNOME 2.28.2. It is
available in Fedora 12. Not sure other distros are picking up updates.

Dear Sirs,

i am using Ubuntu for just 3 - 4 months only, earlier for past 10
years windows only.

though i have heard about linux in the last 3 to 4 years - havent seen
anyone using linux.? I was working for a company (in the power
division) where they sell IBM, SUN, HP, and Lenovo.? But even at
office (where at bangalore around 200 people used to work), havent
seen anyone using linux. every system will be preinstalled with XP.? I
have seen our support engineers using Solaris 10 (Sun support).

Why I am telliing all these,? I dont think we can blame anyone - for
not seeing Linux.

Though I am fully satisfied with Ubuntu, I could not install them at
my office, where my HO people are shouting - since they cannot support
for Ubuntu. I have installed 9.04 & 9.10 in my own laptop.

I know there is a LUG in chennai, and if organisation like that gives
us more about customising & others for Ubuntu, we shall help more
people, outside this Linux group.? I know you all are very very good
in linux.? whereas we do not know more than just customising.? I do
not blame you all at all ....

Instead, on saturdays & sundays, IF POSSIBLE,? can anyone give us
basic knowledge of customising certain aspects of Ubuntu, in chennai.

I can / others too can organise for such ones.? Just meet for max. 2
to 3 hours ( No parties etc - just Gyan).? we will meet informally.

I feel that people who are outside the regular Linux group (like you
all) can only lure the people who are using Windows.? If you all tell
that 9.10 is better than windows XP or 7, they will say you are all
experienced and can do all that is required.

In short : give us A LITTLE MORE of what you all know.? We will
evangelise for you.? I know that LINUX DO NOT NEED EVANGELISTS,
!!!!!!.


May be I have barged in without qualification - in this chat.

Message-ID: <7938ae610911020345w11541983na06951af3473418@mail.gmail.com>

Please take a look at this program.

http://gayatri-hitech.com/languageclasses/editline-sample.c.html

I have also pasted the code here:

/*
   cc -g test.c -o test -ledit -ltermcap
 */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <histedit.h>

/* To print out the prompt you need to use a function.  This could be
   made to do something special, but I opt to just have a static prompt.
 */
char * prompt(EditLine *e) {
	return "test> ";
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

	/* This holds all the state for our line editor */
	EditLine *el;

	/* This holds the info for our history */
	History *myhistory;

	/* Temp variables */
	int count;
	const char *line;
	int keepreading = 1;
	HistEvent ev;

	/* Initialize the EditLine state to use our prompt function and
	   emacs style editing. */

	el = el_init(argv[0], stdin, stdout, stderr);
	el_set(el, EL_PROMPT, &prompt);
	el_set(el, EL_EDITOR, "emacs");

	/* Initialize the history */
	myhistory = history_init();
	if (myhistory == 0) {
		fprintf(stderr, "history could not be initialized\n");
		return 1;
	}

	/* Set the size of the history */
	history(myhistory, &ev, H_SETSIZE, 800);

	/* This sets up the call back functions for history functionality */
	el_set(el, EL_HIST, history, myhistory);

	while (keepreading) {
		/* count is the number of characters read.
		   line is a const char* of our command line with the tailing \n */
		line = el_gets(el, &count);

		/* In order to use our history we have to explicitly add commands
		   to the history */
		if (count > 0) {
			history(myhistory, &ev, H_ENTER, line);
			printf("You typed \"%s\"\n", line);
		}
	}


	/* Clean up our memory */
	history_end(myhistory);
	el_end(el);


	return 0;
}

Please compile this program and see what it does. Actually bash uses
readline and editline is a
BSD licensed BSD alternative to the bulky readline library.

The other day I googled and got this code. I ran it and was very happy
with the results.

So this is what you need to do to integrate history features into your
application.

I think the code is mostly self explanatory. ;)

That guy has commented the code very well.

By the way please look at this page:

http://gayatri-hitech.com/languageclasses/

It is evolving and not ready yet. But I shall put up all the code samples here.

Not the LUG mails. You only need the code right? ;)

I shall send better language tips from next week onwards.

Best,
Girish

hi,

I've uploaded two images regarding the video downloader..
http://picasaweb.google.com/aishu.moorthy/VideoDownloader#
In the first two images, i've shown the s/w working in the youtube site.
In the third image you can see a video is embedded in the site.
But as soon as i click the play button, it asks for the "download" option.
This is very useful for videos which are embedded and for those which we
dont get urls.
I need some thing like that, pls do specify if there is a package like that
for ubuntu, or else is it possible to develop any package like that?
pls give me some suggestions..

IANA-expert. DSL modems are trained by a head end. I guess, based on this
fact alone, it would fail.

I'm a bit confused, all the replies you received had solutions for downloading 
videos. All of them work on Linux.

All of them (except for cclive ?) can recognize embedded video when you click 
the play button, as you mentioned.

If you want a button next to your video (instead of the drag and drop or the 
right click menu convenience of UnPlug) you can use DownloadManager and check 
the appropriate option in the  preferences ('General->Appearance') dialog.

cheers,

ethernet may require a repeater.   Another possibility - a serial 
connection (null modem) using twisted pair (shielded if you can afford 
it).  One computer is the client, the other is the server.  TCP/IP 
stack over PPP connection.

You cannot terminate two DSL modems together, you need a
DSLAM on the other end of your DSL line.

Instead DSL providers offer IP VPN -- which is a type of DSL connection
without internet access, but for connecting several branch offices at
low cost.  This typically costs no more than a regular DSL connection.
Think of it as poor man's MPLS cloud.  Airtel offers IP VPN.

Or ask your telco operator for a leased line, and get them to loop it
at the exchange.  This works only if both your end points are at
the same telephone exchange.  What you end up getting is essentially
a private copper connection.  You can then use any leased line modem
and get up to 16Mb/s speeds.  BSN offers this setup, but don't tell
them you are using 16Mb/s modems!

There are 3rd party providers in Chennai (assuming you're in Chennai)
who can provide you point-to-point multi-mode fiber connectivity.  You
can terminate both ends on to a suitable GBIC module and port on
a Ethernet switch.  Since this is private fiber, you can run up to
10Gb/s on this link.  I've never used these myself, so no first hand
experience to talk about.


Note that you cannot run your own cables through public property
without a telco or ISP license.  Therefore any suggestions on running
your own Ethernet/serial/etc cable, is legal only if it's within your own
private property or campus.

No. ADSL modems are designed to talk to RAS. So better connect thous
computers using Ethernet cable. If you see more error in the link,
then use one low cost hub or switch in the middle.

I have not tried such cables but I heard such thing from old lab

present from EE dept to Bharti Dept at IITD (It has distance approx
500m)

**Sorry for sending this message at last moment**

The TeNeT Group of IIT-Madras and LIRNEasia, a telecom policy NGO in
SriLanka have developed the AT Methodology for measuring broadband
quality of service experience(QoSE). This provides a subscriber
oriented measure of the service quality, as opposed to the raw
bandwidth advertised by the operators.  This has been used to
evaluate
broadband services in South Asia over the past 2 years.

Based on this methodology, recently tests have been conducted by
chosen subscribers in various major cities across India and in some
of the States. The results of these tests will be presented in a
Seminar to be held in GRT Grand, T Nager, Chennai on Tue Nov 3rd,
2009, 4-7PM.

If you are interested to participate in this event, please send a
confirmation mail to me (before 2PM) with your contact number, for
planning purposes, as the seating is limited.

The idea was more of a concept in my mind rather than an implemented 
solution.  Having seen remote terminals (console) connected over 
twisted pair (TP), to servers across campus, I see the PPP stack as an 
extension of that idea.  The modem "chat" aspect may not be necessary 
in the client side connection setup.  Likewise, on the server side 
setup RAS on the serial tty.

Yes.

500m over DB9 cable ? it seems much difficult as at slow speed their
will be lots of distortion in signal.

from : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232
"The standard does not define a maximum cable length but instead
defines the maximum capacitance that a compliant drive circuit must
tolerate. A widely-used rule-of-thumb indicates that cables more than
50 feet (15 metres) long will have too much capacitance, unless
special cables are used. By using low-capacitance cables, full speed
communication can be maintained over larger distances up to about
1,000 feet.[7] For longer distances, other signal standards are better
suited to maintain high speed."

560 seconds is consumed. Which is 9 minutes and 20 seconds.

When you record videos and want only the relevant portion this can help.

I shall talk about other advanced tricks like combining videos with
mencoder later.

It takes care of frame boundaries correctly. I think there are 3 types
of frames in MPEG.

B frame, I frame and P frame.

hi,

of late strange things are happening on my kde:
1. kmail lost some of it's settings - it would not quote when replying and I 
had to recreate the kmailrc
2. now and then firefox crashes and I am logged out of my session
3. the system tray is blacked out
4. some keys in the tamil keyboard no longer work - I need to use iok to type 
them.

this is default kde on fedora 11. would this be due to hardware starting to 
fail? or can kde itself get corrupted? In which case would a reinstall of kde 
work?

Sorry for the top post.


Only RAM errors go unnoticed by the OS. Other errors like disk, faulty
ports, etc are reported in the kernel log messages.

Try running memtest86 on your laptop to thoroughly test your RAM for errors.

Good point. 

Another option would be to get 512/1024 Kbps (symmetric) DSL connection 
and setup site2site VPN.

Multimode fiber connection within the campus or or Metropolitan Area 
Network (MAN) to connect offices within a metro area are other 
possibilities.

this may sound silly, but I installed memtest86+ using yum - but how does one 
run it? there is no executable file called memtest86+ on the machine.

It will be listed, like kernel image, in the boot loader menu.

In a terminal, type 'blkid' and write down the uuid for your / partition.

In your /boot/grub/menu.lst, add these lines and choose this option while
booting:

title           memtest86+
uuid          <uuid for your / partition>
kernel       /boot/memtest86+.bin
quiet

During the boot time, memtest will be listed in the grub menu along
with other installed kernel image(s). For normal booting, we used to
select the one of the kernel image. To run the memtest, we need to
select the memtest option. And we can't run memtest like a command or
application from the shell.

Explain does not work properly.

Try dmesg | tail and check if the card adaptor is recognized in
the first place

thanks - actually the entries were already there - only the delay for grub was 
1 second. I changed it to a bigger figure and was able to run the memtest - did 
not give any errors. Now that I recall I have done this several times in the 
past. Am I supposed to run the memtest for 12 hours or is one pass enough?

If no errors turn up in the first 30 mins, then it's unlikely that any
further errors
will show up later.

The mochahost.com offer this package at a pretty decent rate. I hosted
a website with them in the past. Their control panel is cool, using
which we can administer all application including
tomcat/mysql/servlets/etc.

Message-ID: <20091103092045.24600.qmail@f6mail-145-186.rediffmail.com>





Hello,



I am into my 1st BSc Statistics and into a project for an MNC. I am
trying my first hand at linux and was recently introduced to gawk.



I am having trouble processing a statistical dump that is provided to us in the
form of a csv file. The format of the file is given below



C_ID, ID_NO, stat1, vol2, amount3,... 



There are around 40 fields and the csv file has close to a million records



The C_ID, is the customer id and is only way to identify the customer.

The ID_NO field is the premium plan the customer is in

stat1, vol2, amounts are all numbers



I can write a query that uses a few if statements and gets the details if the
ID_NO is sequential. 

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
there are over 1000 different ID_NO (legacy) and we need to add the stat1, vol2,
amount3 for each of the ID_NOs separately (I need to group the ID_NO, and sum
of the fields)

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If
I have the C_ID of the customers in a separate csv, is it possible to compare
the C_ID with that of the C_ID in the dump and determine the sum of stat1,
vol2, amount3?&nbsp; (sum of the fields only
for a set of customers and not for the ID_NOs in whole)

We are extensively using
MS-Access for this and it has been a pain. A friend suggested that I try my
hand at using tools in linux.

I am not sure if this is the
right mailing list for this. 

Will really appreciate any help
in this regard.

Thanks in advance

Siva

I cannot help on gawk. However perl has nice dbi interface to csv files.

here is the standard example for reading /etc/passwd using sql

require DBI;
           my $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:CSV:");
           $dbh->{'csv_tables'}->{'passwd'} = {
               'eol' => "\n",
               'sep_char' => ":",
               'quote_char' => undef,
               'escape_char' => undef,
               'file' => '/etc/passwd',
               'col_names' => ["login", "password", "uid", "gid", "realname",
                               "directory", "shell"]
           };
           $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM passwd where login like 'ram%'");
$sth->execute();
while (@array=$sth->fetchrow_array()){
	print "@array\n\n";
}

There are specialised modules for csv at cpan.org. Million records should not be a problem at all.

Could you possibly show how far you've been able to get with awk to do this ?

If you haven't yet started, this should give you an idea:

$ echo "C_ID, ID_NO, stat1, vol2, amount3" | awk -F ',' '{print $1 $2;}'

...basically, break the problem down, try solving these smaller problems and 
come back here when/if you get stuck.

Not many people here are going to jump in and help out by giving you the 
complete solution. People like helping out as long as they don't feel like 
they're being suckered into doing somebody's work.

Moreover, solving such problems is fun on linux, because there are just so many 
options of tools and ways get to the same solution. You'll miss out on it if we 
just handed over a solution to you :).

So, show some code and we'll help.

This was because 2 serial ports had the same irq. The card is probably using

  Thanks Steve and Raman Found a better alternative. Python. :)

import csv

ifileR25 = open('Report_2_5, "rb")

readerR25 = csv.reader(ifileR25)

rownum = 0
for row in readerR25:
 if rownum == 0:
 header = row
 else:
 colnum = 0
 for col in row:
 if rownum &gt; 1:
 if colnum == 0:

&lt;&lt; do all my processing here &gt;&gt;
 
 colnum += 1
 
 rownum += 1

ifileR25.close()

The trouble's different. How do i open two files, the Report_2_5 above and also another one with the Customer IDs alone and look for rows only for in Report_2_5 for it and process them alone

for example,

Report_2_5 has the following data
C_ID, ID_NO, stat1, vol2, amount3
2134, Ins1, 10000, 20000, 10
2112, Ins3, 30000, 20000, 10
2121, Ins3, 30000, 20000, 10
2145, Ins2, 15000, 10000, 5
2245, Ins2, 15000, 10000, 5
0987, Ins1, 10000, 20000, 10

Now my customer id has the following records ONLY
2134
0987

Should i iterate through the complete customer id file to find out if a number is there ? if so, how do i create a report of just the following and process it ?
C_ID, ID_NO, stat1, vol2, amount3

2134, Ins1, 10000, 20000, 10

0987, Ins1, 10000, 20000, 10


My output has to state

Stat1 : 20000
vol2 : 40000
amount3 : 20

Thanks in advance
Siva

Message-ID: <200911031831.09603.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,
I was using the translation memory of poedit to pull in all the Tamil 
translations available in my system for automatic translation. The results are 
horrifying. It is not just a problem of using high flown words - most of the 
translations are completely wrong. People have been translating without the 
faintest understanding of the english meaning. Simple things like translating 
adjectives as nouns or verbs as nouns and in many cases total nonsense. The 
goal seems to be 'how many strings can I do' to get karma or something like 
that. I now understand the magnitude of the task of doing kde - over 1 lakh 
strings, not only finishing it, but also rectifying most of them. It is 
certainly no joke, and we must activate groups who are willing to do this. 
Translation is not easy - it is hard and painstaking work, but very rewarding 
when the right words are found. And we need a lot of people to do this.

The following code reads the customer numbers alone:

f = open('Customer_IDs', 'r')
customer_ids = f.read().strip().split('\n') # Assuming each ID is present in a separate line.

Then, in your previous program, print only if the customer ID belongs
to one the above list, i.e.

if customer_id in customer_ids:
    print ...

etc.

HTH.

Insert all Customer IDs into a new hash table as hash keys. When
you process Report_2_5, check if the Customer ID (key) exists in
the hash.  Eg. python: if customer_id in hash: blah...

Hash key lookups are almost a constant time operation in all
scripting languages and your code should work fast enough for
most purposes.

Hi Siva,

Excellent !! I debated with myself whether I should just recommend python before 
I sent out my reply and finally decided against it (or at least defer suggesting 
it until/if things got hairy with awk) simply because many 'new' python users do 
not appreciate the simplicity and beauty of python unless they've had to deal 
with the mess of awk/sed/perl.

I'm glad you found it without help. Now, some comments ...

Firstly, when sending out code in your mail (in fact, IMHO, when sending out 
/any/ mail) it is a good idea to compose the mail in plain text, since fixed 
width font is better to read code in and also (more importantly for python) 
whitespace gets lost/mangled with html mail.

Note: the 'b' is not necessary on linux. Linux, in fact most *nix systems do not 
make any special distinction between 'binary' and non-binary files. Every file 
is a stream of bytes as far as *nix is concerned.

The fact that some file would only have bytes limited to the ASCII character set 
and would have a '\n' at regular intervals does not make them special or different.

Also, the 'r' is implied if no additional args are provided (ie: open in read 
mode is default), so:

ifileR25 = open('Report_2_5')

The two lines below and the entire iteration loop itself can be refactored. Read 
the documentation for csv (expecially the bits about .next(), .line_num and 
.fieldnames):
http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html

Hint: Look at all the examples at least, if you don't feel like reading the doc.

Hmm, well the approach you take depends on how large your other file (the one 
with the customer ids) is.

For instance if you don't mind reading the entire contents of the file into 
memory ...

cids = [ cid.strip() for cid in open('CustomerIds').readlines() if cid.strip()]

That is called a list-comprehension. It is just a concise way of saying ...

cids = []
cid_file = open('CustomerIds')

for line in cid_file.readlines():
     # remove whitespace and newlines
     stripped = line.strip()
     if stripped: # if line is not empty
         cids.append(stripped)

Now to check whether an id exists in the 'cids' list simply do:

if 'Ins1' in cids:
     <do whatever you want with Ins1>

> My output has to state
>
> Stat1 : 20000
> vol2 : 40000
> amount3 : 20
>

so basically ...

if cid in cids:
   print """
Stat1 : %s
vol2 : %s
amount3 : %s
""" % (row[2], row[3], [4])

 From your earlier code, i can see that you are quite capable of reading just 
this much to move ahead.

wasn't that fun ?!

hth,
cheers,
- steve

small bug in the line above. The line above only strip()s the last newline. So, 
all lines except the last still retain their '\n'.

and due to the bug above, the condition block is only entered when customer_id 
is the same as the one in the last line of the file (since all the other strings 
in customer_ids have a '\n')

If you looking for throw away script, then just use this:

Or be lazy and use RaiseError and get DBI to automatically

If you run "udev" and your system autoloads the module "cdc-acm" then
this device node will be automatically created.

Otherwise, try to load this module and watch /var/log/syslog to see
whether any device was detected.

If you setup your machine to do postfix or sendmail then you can send e-mails
from the command line. Also use a script. Even for this gmail account.

I am not getting into the details of configuration. OpenBSD developer
Gilles Chehade is
developing a SMTPD implementation but it will take around 6 more months I think.

There is still a lot more work to do.

For now please stick to Postfix or Sendmail. Both are bad. Postfix
does not have a good license
 and sendmail is too complex. Exim of course is worse.

Anyway this is what you need to do to send mail assuming that your MTA
does its job.


$ mail -s subject god@universe.org < /dev/null

This will send an empty e-mail.

With mutt you can send attachments from the command line like this:

$ mutt -a /tmp/attach.pdf -s "testing attachments" recipient@target.org

You also have nail which is very powerful. I have never used it.

If all you want to do is _send_ mail by connecting to another SMTP server
then why do you need to run these smtp daemons?

Just use something like "msmtp". 

For example, to send mail via gmail using mutt I have:

 1. In .muttrc I have 'set sendmail = '/usr/bin/msmtp -a gmail'

 2. In .msmtprc I have:
         account gmail
         host smtp.gmail.com
         auth on
         user your_gmail_id_here@gmail.com
         password enter_your_password_here
         port 587
         from your_gmail_id_here@gmail.com
         tls on

Similar settings can work for other smtp daemons that allow remote
access.

The nice thing is that this does not need root privilege. The only
thing required is that your account can make outgoing network
connections on port 587 to smtp.gmail.com

Hope this helps you avoid things you do not seem to like!

Kapil.

But when others respond with their own strong opinions and the OP thinks its
'pettiflogging', we can only conclude that the OP only likes to dish out
strong opinions while he himself cannot stomach any :-)

That's equally asinine, "Postfix's license sucks big time, I would
like to be able to do <foo> like I could with <x>, <y>, or <z> but
instead <bar> restriction prevents me from doing so" is more what I
had in mind.  Just rewording unsubstantiated claims doesn't make them
any better.

Don't let that stop you.  :)

Although I was surprised by that "pettifogging"[1] mail too, since the
*-a-day mails did start many interesting discussions IMHO.

You can also use mpack - pack a file in MIME format
in either of the two forms below


mpack [-s subject] [-d descriptionfile] [-m maxsize] [-c content-type]
file address ... 

The below will generate outputfile in proper MIME format.
mpack [-s subject] [-d descriptionfile] [-m maxsize] [-c content-type]
-o outputfile

mpack is exactly meant for sending emails with all kinds of attachments
and does nothing else and hence it is a tiny executable which can be
used in shell scripts.

mpack can be downloaded at

http://sourceforge.net/projects/indimail/files/mailpack/mailpack-1.1/mpack-1.6.tar.gz/download

You're right.  I see where you're coming from.  Sorry about that, but
I was saying that I don't have a problem with opinions (actually
prefer them, as I'd rather get my facts from more reliable sources),
but they carry more weight if supported by argument.

This might devolve into another long meta-discussion, so I'm out.  Bye.

Message-ID: <2354c1c50911032351m7935b6d0g45b586b69fc17d03@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am now trying to access the csv file using dictreader.

import csv

r25  = csv.DictReader(open('Report_25', 'rb'), delimiter=',')

rownum = 1
for row in r25:
    # Save header row.
    if rownum == 0:
        header = row
    else:
        colnum = 0
        for col in row:

This only gets me the following output

{'FieldName1': '4', 'FieldName2': '0.00', 'FieldName3':
'4001433', 'FieldName4': '759'}

1. How do i access the 4, 0.00, ... the values ?
2. How do i compare it with another csv file ?

Sorry about posting repeatedly. Haven't been able to understand yet.

Thanks in advance
Siva

    Create an object which operates like a regular reader but maps the 
information read into a dict whose keys are given by the optional fieldnames 
parameter. If the fieldnames parameter is omitted, the values in the first row 
of the csvfile will be used as the fieldnames. If the row read has fewer fields 
than the fieldnames sequence, the value of restval will be used as the default 
value. If the row read has more fields than the fieldnames sequence, the 
remaining data is added as a sequence keyed by the value of restkey. If the 
row read has fewer fields than the fieldnames sequence, the remaining keys take 
the value of the optional restval parameter. Any other optional or keyword 
arguments are passed to the underlying reader instance.
</unquote>

use the fieldname parameter which will give you a dictionary with all values. 
If you put this in a database, then sql power is available for all sorts of 
queries.

Hi Siva,

A few comments before going further:
a. You should have continued in the same thread as before (changing the subject 
line, if necessary), nobody would've minded. People not interested would've 
ignored the thread.

b. If you did want to start a new thread (since this one is not really about 
gawk), you should repeat the context (ie: restate the original problem). By not 
doing so, you've confused the people who weren't interested in gwak but are 
interested in python.

c. I noticed you asked the same question on python-list. Nothing wrong with that 
per se. ...however, you are unlikely to get too many (relevant) responses there 
because the people there who are not on ILUGC and have not read the gawk thread 
have no context information !(*)

Anyways, that said, here is something that might help. Assuming the file you 
pasted in the last thread:
[steve@laptop ~]$ cat Report_2_5
C_ID, ID_NO, stat1, vol2, amount3
2134, Ins1, 10000, 20000, 10
2112, Ins3, 30000, 20000, 10
2121, Ins3, 30000, 20000, 10
2145, Ins2, 15000, 10000, 5
2245, Ins2, 15000, 10000, 5
0987, Ins1, 10000, 20000, 10
[steve@laptop ~]$ cat cids
Ins1
Ins3

here, are some basic operations using the csv module for you to try out:
 >>> r25 = csv.reader(open('Report_2_5'))
 >>> cids = [ line.strip() for line in open('cids') ]
 >>> cids
['Ins1', 'Ins3']
 >>> for row in r25:
...     if row and (row[1].strip() in cids):
...             print row
...

and in case you prefer DictReader ...

I can understand how you feel looking at the quality of translations.
In 2004, KDE translation was taken up by students on mass scale - 20
to 30 students working in a Dishnet centre. While a lot of efforts was
made to ensure quality and uniformity of translation, they were not
successful. During that time Tamil translation status crossed 95% mark
in KDE.

That was a good starting point, which could not be taken forward at
that time. Options to complete tamil translation of major FOSS
applications (KDE, Open Office, Gnome, FireFox,
Ubuntu/Fedora/OpenSuSe):

1. A dedicated team of translators working full time
This will ensure quality and uniformity of translations.
Need financial / institutional support.

2. Spread translation efforts among student community
It will be the true FOSS way
Cost is less
Quality is take what you get.

3. Combination of both
A core team of language experts defining terminology, managing commits
and ensuring quality
Volunteer army to do the volume work.

In my opinion, a Tamil Kanini project which aims to take a Linux PC to
schools / homes / shops would be one way to achieve the above. The
other could be government funded effort (NRC-FOSS?)

The foremost need is Tamil Interface User base & passion to see the
desktop in one's own language. Our people lack that.

With English Speaking Tamil people, this has seldom been the need & the
needy Tamil people Speaking people seldom have computers.

NRCFOSS does already. It supports our efforts. We need to knock it and
show some continuous good work. The doors are open.

It supports two students who are currently creating a Tamil font, it is
supporting our proposal for a Ubuntu and Fedora Books in Tamil & also
KDE translation.

Among the other projects that we have taken up with its support is the
Tamil Spell checker. We recently added a lakh of word to Hunspell
dictionary, We believe it gets reflected in Fedora 12.

The iok packaging was done at NRCFOSS. All are very small beginnings,
but backed by NRCFOSS.

Friends.

Found this nice python interpreter - bpython
while skimming the packages in synaptic package manager.

It is an easy python shell to learn.

I installed via
sudo apt-get install bpython

in my ubuntu 9.,10.

I feel the need of the hour is a centralised dictionary that can generate a 
generic pot file which translators can pull in. This will not cost much, but we 
need a few committed people to frequently browse this and keep it up to 
standard.

How about '?????????? ??????' to represent the concept of an account?
Derived from '?????' (registration). Unless its already a word that means a
different thing!! :-) . If it isn't, it has the disadvantage of being a new
word though!

IMHO, the problem is multi- fold .

1. Most people who use the computer have been broughtup with an
english interface.
2. Lack of standardization of the words.
3. Use of pretty complex words while transaltion
4. Lack of Tamil Jargons - "Have you saved your file?" - "Nee file-a
save pannitaya" is easier than "Nee koppettai semithu vaithaya?".

When I started using Tamil KDE, I was literally at a loss. It was
similar to using Windows - Dutch version when I was in the
Netherlands. I am able to make out the words, but not it's exact
meaning. My mother tongue is Tamil, still couldn't make much of it. I
switched back to English. (I remember discussing with Shrinivasan T
about this once...)

the best way is to train an entire generation to use the comps in
Tamil ;-), particularly the older folks and the Govt. Junta.

A suggestion / prayer:
While we translate, can we try to use the words in such a manner that
these words can easily be converted into "jargons"? Try to use the
words  in a sentence based on context. The Latin world have a
different set of language semantics, than the Indic world. So, not all
words can be translated one-one, but instead the same word might have
to be "contextually" translated. - I agree that this might not be
fully achievable, as all I18N is done on a word-per-word basis.


with regards,
Natarajan.

Sounds cool. Also try "ipython". I'm sure you will still be impressed!

That looked very nice.  While we're at it, apart from IPython (which
Bhuvaneswaran A suggested below), you can use Python within Emacs,
great for when you want to play around with more than a few lines of
code.

Switch to another buffer (need not visit a file) ... C-x b pycode (say)
Switch to python-mode

C-c C-z to get a shell by your side

type in your buffer, and say C-c C-c to have it sent to your python shell

mix and match.  :)

What is the use of training older folks? It is gen-next that needs
training for sustained development and usage. The problem of tamil usage is not just because of lack of translation, the factors are beyond scope of discussion here.
 
The best we can do is to translate however faulty it may be than discussion - remember junoon tamil and present status of dubbed serials/english movies. Today they are much better than junoon tamil, but it is junoon which provided the impulse.

If everyone translates 10 strings a day, and discusses those strings with 
others, the problem will be solved in a year or two. Just translation without 
discussion is pointless. Although discussion for those who cannot click on iok 
even is sometimes helpful.

Excellent works..  Its time to think about some sort of public
institutionalised training and evaluation program for FOSS within the
college, with appropriate certifications..

We need to encourage students to choose a FOSS technology right from second
year and focus on that for the remaining years..it would help students to
develop expertise in a particular domain or technology..  eg,  java stream,
C/C++ stream, webstream (php, ROR etc).

Senthil

We do have a little list, due to the discussions that emerged in Ubuntu
Tamil Team and then subsequently onto the Tamil Wiktionary
google-groups. I had a refined version of that at my website, lost in
now.

All those were at the Suzhi wiki, that we had at NRCFOSS some time back.

And we are planning for a FUEL workshop at Chennai with Redhat, in near
future. We do need a SABDFL for this too. else tussles are on way ;-)

None of this seems to be related to the mplayer issue. Something more useful
would be the DE/WM you use and/or the video driver of mplayer.

Using GNOME? Then Nautilus is covering up your root window. Use xwinwrap

"Vaasi" does mean play as in play an instrument and also read aloud akin

Eclipse is an IDE - and will do everything you need. Also, 'Eric' is an 
IDE popular with some application level python developers.

1. Eric . http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/

2. Stani's Python Editor. http://pythonide.blogspot.com/

3. Pida. It actually uses Emacs or vi as the editor. http://pida.co.uk/

Actual python users will probably have more suggestions.

Hi,

You can set the umask value in /etc/profile in all linux distros.

How about SPE. (Stani's python editor.)
Light weight and doesn't have the bloat normally associated with
Eclipse. It should be
in your repos, but unfortunately remains fairly unknown.

Since you are back to square one, now time to give some of my gyan.
All Fedora lovers stop reading here.

KDE on Fedora is probably the worst combo. You can ask a few KDE
devels and they would recommend OpenSuse as their preferred KDE
Desktop based Distro. Next would be Kubuntu. I am not taking away any
credits from the wonderful KDE Fedora team, but its just not there.

Fedora Electronic Lab was based on KDE and it *had* to be moved to a
GNOME Desktop[1] for better user experience. I have struggled and had
very very similar experiences with KDE on Fedora like you have
mentioned in the original mail.

So , suggestion - Move to OpenSuse if you love KDE.

Subject: [Ilugc] equivalent of Solaris processor_bind system call IN Linux 
Message-ID: <574692.86838.qm@web94703.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

Hello Friends ,

I ahve a Solaris code with processor_bind system call to bind LWPs to a processor 

 
The processor_bind() function binds the LWP (lightweight process) or set of LWPs specified by idtype and id to the processor specified by processorid. If obind is not NULL, this function also sets the processorid_t variable pointed to by obind to the previous binding of one of the specified LWPs, or to PBIND_NONE if the selected LWP was not bound.
 
I have checked the manuals and documents , but  i found there is no equivalent sys call in linux 
 
The Linux system calls that are processor affinity based are sched_setaffinity(2) and sched_getaffinity(2). 

I would like to know is there any wrapper fun or workaround for processor_bind in Linux 

Many Thanks in advance
Naren

To me, the stability and not having to worry about virri infection is 
more important than boot times.  I boot my desktop (once a day) with 
the RTC auto timer in the BIOS and it is all booted up by the time I 
get down to using it :)  Likewise, I have a cron job that shuts down 
the desktop at a certain time of the day.

On a colleagues laptop I had to do a manual "modprobe usb-serial"  to 
get the serial device activated.

OP could try the above if all else fails.

I am not quite sure if this is what you are looking for, but take a look at 
pthread_setaffinity_np(3). This sets the affinity of a thread (as opposed to the 
entire process), which is what a LWP would be called on linux, to a specific CPU.

and to make the win key a short cut to switch languages, right click on the 
indicator, choose keyboard preferences -> layouts -> layout options -> keys to 
change layout, and choose the left win key. Now the win key is useful.

Take a look at fossee.in

The FOSSEE project's mandate from MHRD is to train faculty (and
students) in open source alternatives to MATLAB etc.,

We will be very happy to conduct a two-day hands-on workshop on
"Python for Engineering and Scientific Computing". We have so far
conducted it at BP, Pune, BITS Goa and this weekend we will be
conducting in Calicut University.


Please do contact pasokan@fossee.in

Some well meaning soul has invited me automatically to a word a day
e-mail. I did not quite intend to
subscribe and I dunno if I can opt out.

Anyway you can always lookup any word or phrase using the command line
dict utility.

You install the package as dictd-client or whatever.

$ dict foo

gets you the meaning of foo.

$ dict "opt out"

when you wish to lookup idioms with spaces.

PS: No Internet in my boondocks all day. Hence the delay. Now lookup
boondocks using dict or look at the
wikipedia article for the same. ;)

$mplayer -vf screenshot video.flv

Press 's' for screenshots.

If you have

vf=screenshot

in /etc/mplayer.conf

you don't have to give this parameter every time.

But remember, this will only give shots in the default resolution that
mplayer starts up, if you want a full screen shot, you have
to apply a scale filter.

Some suggestions:

* Please subscribe to kernel-newbies mailing list:
http://kernelnewbies.org/MailingList

* You can also ask queries on their IRC channel:
http://kernelnewbies.org/IRC

Refer the following on how to use IRC:
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicate/IRCHowTo

* As Bharathi suggested, please read the Linux Device Drivers book from here:
http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/

* Also try my simple device driver examples:

You can achieve this using ACL's   ACLs can control certain criteria whether
someone needs to authenticate, when the user is allowed to surf and which
web sites can be accessed. See http://workaround.org/squid-acls;

Try this,
Create a list of banned sites and store it in let say /etc/squid/banned_urls
Add the following lines in squid.conf

acl blocked_sites url_regex -i "/etc/squid/banned_urls"
acl banned src <ip1> <ip2> <ip3>
acl allowed src <ip2> <ip2 <ip3>
http_access allow allowed
http_access deny blocked_sites

Shortly, add a http_access rule allowing the users before the http_access
block rule;

Hi,

A reader of this article[1] wants to  recover deleted data from his mobile.

He lives at Bellary Dist, Karnataka and has does not know/have linux.

I like to redirect his request to any LUG in Bangalore or Karnataka.

Which group is active there?

give me your suggestions.

Thanks.

Hi All,

I am using debian sid and I tried upgrading qt for a python-qt based
app. since the upgrade qt has been segfaulting. one mistake i did is
not noting what versions of qt were there before the upgrade.

i purge removed all qt4 related debs and reinstalled them. it still didn't help!

anybody faced this or has any resolution? i couldn't find much help
from google, but i do see some issues with qt upgrades in ubuntu.

Have you checked with bugs.debian.org/qt4-x11?

By the way, the safer way to work with Debian sid is to install it
under a chroot and use it with pbuilder or schroot. (For GUI stuff
you may want to add Xephyr to the mix). This way you don't bork your
working system if sid has broken something. (In the "Toy Story", sid
was the kid who would break all the toys!)

Kapil.

Message-ID: <7938ae610911080353w66b1f31et5940cc7faaca7bb5@mail.gmail.com>

I did this today. So I thought I would talk about this.

The easiest way to get going if you wish to learn serial port access
on UNIX is by installing the Perl CPAN module
Device::Modem.

Then all you have to do is this:

 use Device::Modem;

         my $modem = new Device::Modem( port => '/dev/tty00' );

        /*
         if( $modem->connect( baudrate => 9600 ) ) {
             print "connected!\n";
         } else {
             print "sorry, no connection with serial port!\n";
         }
        */

        my %sig = $modem->status();
        for ('CTS','DSR','RLSD')
        {
                if($_ =~ /RLSD/) {
                        print "Signal DCD is: ", ($sig{$_} > 0 ? 'on'
: 'off'), "\n";
                } else {
                        print "Signal $_  is: ", ($sig{$_} > 0 ? 'on'
: 'off'), "\n";
                }
        }

Now this should give an idea about where I am coming from.

I am trying to get a footpedal device used in medical transcription
for pausing/playing, rewind and fast forward to work
 with a Windoze box.

I thought that interfacing this on OpenBSD or linux would be a good
starting point. So I went ahead and came up with
this code. I took the perl module code from above as a sample for this activity.

The footpedal is a dumb device with no microcontroller or power. I
figured out that the left pedal is connected to the
CTS[clear to send] pin(8), the middle pedal is connected to the
DSR[data set ready] pin(6) and that the last pedal is
wired to the DCD pin(1) which is also known as RLSD .

My job was to read the serial port. And this code does the job admirably well.

 http://gayatri-hitech.com/languageclasses/footpedal.c.html

I also have the code to do this on Windows
 here:

http://gayatri-hitech.com/languageclasses

The explanation of the code is very simple. Please remember to run
this as root user!

You are opening the serial port in read only mode and you are setting
the basic terminal attributes for setting raw mode
 and no parity, no hardware handshaking etc. Opening with a O_NDELAY
flag and setting fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, 0) are necessary to
ensure that the port is opened and is immediately available for
reading. As you can see, we are not using a MODEM here,
no point in waiting.

Once you do that you are reading the port pins in an ioctl call

ioctl(fd, TIOCMGET, &status);

I am having to open and close the port everytime(while loop) on
OpenBSD. Otherwise it does not work. I have not debugged it further.

I have much more important things to do. So I left it like that. On
Windows it is a lot more simper.

You check whether a flag is set using the binary '&' operator. it
masks out the particular bit of interest and we can detect
 the pressing of the pedal that way.

perhaps right. since i was never anything close to gui and since my
python is compiled from sources, i never faced this before. will try
your suggestions. thanks

Message-ID: <20091109052416.1AD4A1DB258@www.ae.iitm.ac.in>

Dear Luggies,

VoG Polytechnic, Erumapatty, Namakkal District had setup a LTSP based Thinclient Lab for 60 Pentium-III machines for their programming, office, internet browsing needs.

The setup was done using Fedora-11 with LTSP and they are using the following applications

1. CodeBlocks with GCC for C/C++ Programming
2. OpenOffice.Org 3.1 for Office Applications
3. Firefox for Browsing

The institution management was quite happy with the setup and further they want to switch to Fedora-12 in about 300 machines (CSE, IT, MCA) for their Engineering College by December.

It seems, this was one of the successful implementation of LTSP in a Polytechnic in Tamilnadu.

By any chance, if you are using emacs you can take a look at

1. have a look at this http://www.rememberthemilk.com

2. email clients: Also, if you are using a mail client such as evolution, it
comes with Tasks section, you might want to have a look at that as well.
Thunderbird has plugins which do this.

3. google calendar. interesting stuff

$ grep girish /etc/passwd

is known. grep stands for "global regular expression print"

In fact it is so well known that I often think that grep should be
made an English verb.

Anyway the above is not the tip.

$ grep --color girish /etc/passwd

shows the matching lines with the keyword in color.

Also -r is recursive grep. -i is case insensitive grep and -v is non
matching lines...

fgrep is useful when you want to have regular expressions like ".iso"
in the lookup string.

zfgrep is for grepping gzipped files.

Message-ID: <7938ae610911082335k7f22ef5fpb56844a57492230b@mail.gmail.com>

I wonder how to name the project I did.

I got very excited about this work because it was not my job.

As Oscar Wilde says: " I am bored to death with my own business. I
like other people's."

So I went ahead and did the work.

Check out the javascript section in this page.

http://gayatri-hitech.com/languageclasses

Long ago I had sent the preliminary page with a high level idea of the
project. But I subsequently got everything
working.

Of course more work needs to be done before this can go live.

I would like you to learn these important concepts from this.

If you can get this working on your local http server with the code
above, then great. You will learn and enjoy a
lot more than what you can get by reading this mail.

Ok here goes.

      o A rectangle is uniquely identified by the 4 tuple
(x1,y1,x2,y2). The top X and Y coordinates and the bottom X and Y
coordinates.

          Look at this.


  (x1 ,y1)  +-----------------+
               |                       |
               |                       |
               |                       |
               +-----------------+ (x2,y2)

       Once we know this area in the eye that is marked by the doctor
we can save and retrieve with a SQLite database

      o Please kindly ensure that the cgi-bin directory is world
writeable and that the values are actually getting stored into the
         database. I got stuck here and figured out that this was the
issue. You can use the command line sqlite3> prompt to   inspect
         the db. Please refer to my tip sent long ago.

      o The retrieval is done using a JSON array. The general
structure of a JSON(javascript object notation) array is this.

          ( { "entries": [
             { "fookey" : "foovalue",
                "bookey" : "boovalue"
             },
              { "foo2key" : "foo2value",
                 "boo2key" : "boo2value"
                }
                 ]
              })

Please remember that in all software situations your opening
braces/curly backets and parantheses have to match perfectly.

Like above you can't have opening ({ and close with )}. It has to
always close with }).

I hope you get the idea.

Have fun with this project.

I shall be sending javascript code with jQuery as part of the language
classes in the coming weeks.

Enjoy.

Hi,
The Computer Society of Madras Institute of Technology, Anna University, is
venturing to conduct next edition of Carte Blanche, a free software fest on
Febraury 27 and 28 of 2010. The events that are planned are:
    * Demo stalls like the ones kept during Software Freedom Day.
    * Lectures on various FOSS topics, technical and otherwise.
    * Competitions using FOSS tools.
    * Programming contest in which teams have to create a new package to
solve a day to day problem.(The package should be created using free
software tools and its source code GPLed).
    * Workshops on creating packages, using free software embedded systems
like Beagle Board etc.

any suggestions, including new event ideas, what lectures people need etc.,
comments and criticisms are welcome.

If any of you are interested in presenting a talk or conducting workshops on
those days please contact us.

For demo stalls, there are prizes for best ones. To keep a stall mail me
with the topic you wish to do demo on.

AAAH....., isn't grep (and its derivatives) a nice can of worms (nicer

ok, That being said, i would suggest one more stuff like newusers
esp.for bulk user adds...

NEWUSERS(8)		  System Management Commands		   NEWUSERS(8)



NAME
       newusers - update and create new users in batch

SYNOPSIS
       newusers [new_users]

DESCRIPTION
       The newusers command reads a file of user name and clear-text password
       pairs and uses this information to update a group of existing users or
       to create new users. Each line is in the same format as the standard
       password file (see passwd(5)) with the following exceptions:

       pw_passwd
	   This field will be encrypted and used as the new value of the
	   encrypted password.

       pw_gid
	   This field must contain the name (or number) of a group. The user
	   will be added as a member to this group. When a non-existent group
	   name or number is specified, a new group will be created. In the
	   case of a non-existent group number, both the name and the number
	   of the new group will be this number.

       pw_dir
	   This field will be checked for existence as a directory, and a new
	   directory with this name will be created if it does not already
	   exist. The ownership of the directory will be set to be that of the
	   user being created or updated.

       This command is intended to be used in a large system environment where
       many accounts are updated at a single time.

OPTIONS
       The options which apply to the newusers command are:

       -c, --crypt-method
	   Use the specified method to encrypt the passwords.

	   The available methods are DES, MD5, NONE, and SHA256 or SHA512 if
	   your libc support these methods.

       -r, --system
	   Create a system account.

	   System users will be created with no aging information in
	   /etc/shadow, and their numeric identifiers are choosen in the
	   SYS_UID_MIN-SYS_UID_MAX range, defined in login.defs, instead of
	   UID_MIN-UID_MAX (and their GID counterparts for the creation of
	   groups).

       -s, --sha-rounds
	   Use the specified number of rounds to encrypt the passwords.

	   The value 0 means that the system will choose the default number of
	   rounds for the crypt method (5000).

	   A minimal value of 1000 and a maximal value of 999,999,999 will be
	   enforced.

	   You can only use this option with the SHA256 or SHA512 crypt
	   method.

	   By default, the number of rounds is defined by the
	   SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS and SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS variables in
	   /etc/login.defs.

CAVEATS
       The input file must be protected since it contains unencrypted
       passwords.

       PAM is not used to update the passwords. Only /etc/passwd and
       /etc/shadow are updated, and the various checks or options provided by
       PAM modules are not used.

CONFIGURATION
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change the
       behavior of this tool:

       ENCRYPT_METHOD (string)
	   This defines the system default encryption algorithm for encrypting
	   passwords (if no algorithm are specified on the command line).

	   It can take one of these values:

	      DES (default)

	      MD5

	      SHA256

	      SHA512



	       Note: this parameter overrides the MD5_CRYPT_ENAB variable.

	       Note: if you use PAM, it is recommended to set this variable
	       consistently with the PAM modules configuration.

       GID_MAX (number), GID_MIN (number)
	   Range of group IDs used for the creation of regular groups by
	   useradd, useradd, or newusers.

       MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP (number)
	   Maximum members per group entry. When the maximum is reached, a new
	   group entry (line) is started in /etc/group (with the same name,
	   same password, and same GID).

	   The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in the
	   number of members in a group.

	   This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of lines in
	   the group file. This is useful to make sure that lines for NIS
	   groups are not larger than 1024 characters.

	   If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.

	   Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in the
	   Shadow toolsuite. You should not use this variable unless you
	   really need it.

       MD5_CRYPT_ENAB (boolean)
	   Indicate if passwords must be encrypted using the MD5-based
	   algorithm. If set to yes, new passwords will be encrypted using the
	   MD5-based algorithm compatible with the one used by recent releases
	   of FreeBSD. It supports passwords of unlimited length and longer
	   salt strings. Set to no if you need to copy encrypted passwords to
	   other systems which dont understand the new algorithm. Default is
	   no.

	   This variable is superceded by the ENCRYPT_METHOD variable or by
	   any command line option used to configure the encryption algorithm.

	   This variable is deprecated. You should use ENCRYPT_METHOD.

	   Note: if you use PAM, it is recommended to set this variable
	   consistently with the PAM modules configuration.

       PASS_MAX_DAYS (number)
	   The maximum number of days a password may be used. If the password
	   is older than this, a password change will be forced. If not
	   specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables the restriction).

       PASS_MIN_DAYS (number)
	   The minimum number of days allowed between password changes. Any
	   password changes attempted sooner than this will be rejected. If
	   not specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables the restriction).

       PASS_WARN_AGE (number)
	   The number of days warning given before a password expires. A zero
	   means warning is given only upon the day of expiration, a negative
	   value means no warning is given. If not specified, no warning will
	   be provided.

       SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS (number), SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS (number)
	   When ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to SHA256 or SHA512, this defines the
	   number of SHA rounds used by the encryption algorithm by default
	   (when the number of rounds is not specified on the command line).

	   With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute forcing the
	   password. But note also that more CPU resources will be needed to
	   authenticate users.

	   If not specified, the libc will choose the default number of rounds
	   (5000).

	   The values must be inside the 1000-999999999 range.

	   If only one of the SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS or SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS
	   values is set, then this value will be used.

	   If SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS > SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS, the highest value
	   will be used.

       SYS_GID_MAX (number), SYS_GID_MIN (number)
	   Range of group IDs used for the creation of system groups by
	   useradd, groupadd, or newusers.

       SYS_UID_MAX (number), SYS_UID_MIN (number)
	   Range of user IDs used for the creation of system users by useradd
	   or newusers.

       UID_MAX (number), UID_MIN (number)
	   Range of user IDs used for the creation of regular users by useradd
	   or newusers.

       UMASK (number)
	   The permission mask is initialized to this value. If not specified,
	   the permission mask will be initialized to 022.

FILES
       /etc/passwd
	   User account information.

       /etc/shadow
	   Secure user account information.

       /etc/group
	   Group account information.

       /etc/gshadow
	   Secure group account information.

       /etc/login.defs
	   Shadow password suite configuration.

Greetings,

Most of oldtimers in CS field knows the progression of
Physics-->Electrical-->[electronics|computerscience].

QED, we wouldn.t be writing and receiving out e-mail, CD/DVD et al
without the progress in the theoratical physics ergo
[astrophysics|electronics|CS].

Nobel Luarate Dr. S. Chandrashekar, whom I presume, we all know was
born on October 10 1910 in CHENNAI ==> his birth centanary is less
than an year away.

Hopefully, the members will search deep into the "howto" state today
(including quantum computing) and come to celebereate one of the most
prolific (and under recognised) intellectual achiever of all times in
Natural sciences. and do something to bring his name to common man's
lips.

NASA has named an X-Ray satellite observatory of his name.

Let us do *something*

Thanks and regards,

Rajagopal

PS. all his work were beyond my intellectual horizon for I am not even
a sand particle on the Marina beach where he walked and imagined "I
want to be Newton" and his last work was "A reader for Newton's
Principia" or something like that.

Fine.

Why are they mentioned in ls?

...unless you really work hard for it ...

$ grep --color=always girish /etc/passwd | less

...but of course less does not know yet that you like being colorful, so ...

$ grep --color=always girish /etc/passwd | less -R

When you get tired of all that typing, creating an 'alias' helps:

$ alias grep="grep --color=always"
$ alias less="less -R"
$ grep girish /etc/passwd | less

".." is the parent directory, not previous.

In Bash, you can use "cd -" to go to the previous directory (i.e., the
one you came from).

They are actual directory entries, I guess so you can move up and down
the hierarchy tree.  The only show up in "ls -a" if it bothers you,
you may try "ls -A" ... also check out RUTE (the link I sent earlier),
it's a very good (and thorough) introduction to Linux if you require
one.

"-" is not an entry, the shell is keeping track of that for you.

"..." is not required since that is the same as ../..
Same goes for "...."

I'm not the best person to answer this though, maybe someone else will
have a more coherent answer.

ls lists the contents of a directory (by default it assumes, the CWD). Since 
every directory (including /) maintains a /reference/ to itself and it's parent 
besides maintaining references of all the files within it's 'contents'.

Since all the contents (ie: all the references) of the directory are listed on a 
ls, . and .. too show up. "man ls" will tell you that the '-A' option to ls 
suppresses this.

> why ... and .... are not there?
>
> any specific reason?
because of the reason mentioned above. Every directory contains a reference to . 
and .. only. The reason why _only_ these two are present is because any other 
contents 'outside' the directory can be derived from these two. So, no 
additional 'special cases' are required.

did i make any sense at all ? :)

In Unix world, every thing is a FILE. The reference to current and 
parent directory need to be maintained. So both are exits and 
displayed in the ls output.

> why ... and .... are not there? any specific reason?

If you need like this, then there is no limit :) But you have an 
alternate option like ../../../

The reason is dentry has both current directory (.) and parent

I have been  using basket. Its a great tool for taking notes and also good
to manage basic todo lists. But beyond that, you can not really sync todo
lists with other apps, send out email/sms alerts etc.  with basket. I always
look at it as an alternative to MS One Note and not to a
Calendar/Organizer/Task Manager.

Message-ID: <4f95f3ec0911092244k22cf4a0dg81b990c7cdb77bad@mail.gmail.com>

I wrote a simple perl cgi in unix to upload a file in linux server and it
worked and when i tried the code in windows server with some little
modification regarding to work on windows it failed.
I tried some googling and i dint find any code related to upload on windows
server. so i need some help in resolving this

The code is below

FILE: UPLOAD.PL

use CGI;
use CGI::Carp qw ( fatalsToBrowser );
use File::Basename;
$safe_filename_characters = "a-zA-Z0-9_.-";
$upload_dir = "c:/";
$query = new CGI;
foreach $i (@values) {
($varname, $data) = split(/=/, $i);
$FORM{$varname} = $data;
}
$filename = $FORM{'file_upload'};
$name = $FORM{'name'};
if ( !$filename )
{
$filename = 'f:/input.txt'
}

my ( $name, $path, $extension ) = fileparse ( $filename, '\..*' );
$filename = $name . $extension;
$filename =~ tr/ /_/;
$filename =~ s/[^$safe_filename_characters]//g;

if ( $filename =~ /^([$safe_filename_characters]+)$/ )
{
 $filename = $1;
}
else
{
 die "Filename contains invalid characters";
}

my $upload_filehandle = $query->upload("file_upload"); # i Think the script
produces error here

open ( UPLOADFILE, ">$upload_dir/$filename" ) or die "$!";
binmode UPLOADFILE;

while ( <$upload_filehandle> )
{
 print UPLOADFILE;
}

close UPLOADFILE;

print $query->header ( );
print $query->start_html('upload');
print $name." file Uploaded";
print $query->end_html();

Subject: [Ilugc] NAT box
Message-ID: <c2eba33f0911092343j27ee81c5t9eefdd8c5c755068@mail.gmail.com>

hi,
We are trying to make a NAT box ready. setup will be something like
this - a gateway kind of computer (NAT box) is connected to the
internet and 4-5 five other computer is connected to this NAT box
through a switch.

we intend to access the internet from the computers connected to NAT
box and do some basic stuffs like browsing, ftp download, voip (sip,
h323), peer-to-peer file sharing etc..

searching the net, we managed to add the following masquerading rule
after enabling ip forwarding:
/sbin/iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -o eth1 -s 192.168.100.0/24 -d
0/0  -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j MASQUERADE

after adding this rule we able do basic HTTP browsing.

NAT box is connected to internet through a switch which also has
another test server where the ftp server is running. when we try doing
ftp from the internal computers to the ftp test server we face
problems. when we use command like "ls", "mget", etc.. we were getting
"port illegal" error. internet searches pointed to active and passive
mode issues in ftp. though i understand this active and passive stuff,
we are unable to determine the exact iptable rules to be added in the
NAT box. internet search also says about this ALG ip_conntrack_ftp
which needs to be loadded. what we need is, clarity about the rules to
be added and the modules to be loaded in the NAT box so that ftp (both
active and passive mode) starts working. we also understand the
potential security issues and would like to address that too.

regards,
naren

Your goal is bit unclear. All ISP Modems/routers do NAT anyway. What are you
trying to do?

What makes you think that all this is basic stuff?

Of course not.

VoIP is hard. FTP is very hard. Only browsing is basic.

As I said only this is basic.

Passive FTP is easier to get working but you will hit the same problem
with FTP and
all VoIP applications.

It uses multiple ports and ports are decided dynamically. Getting
these working with
NAT is a lot of work.

All commercial NAT boxes do the necessary jugglery.

But I am wondering what your end goal is.

The issue with FTP and SIP is that there is a separate TCP connection
necessary for
 operation after establishing the first connection which is rather trivial.

In the case of FTP, you first establish a control connection on port
21 and then you have
a data connection which starts up a new TCP connection. This is the problem.

This will not work across NAT(without reading the FTP payload).

Same issue with Windows PPTP.

Ditto with SIP.

SIP can also work with UDP, so you can get by with a technique called UDP
holepunching.

http://linuxjournal.com/9004

Anyway H.323 also needs special configuration.

Only web browsing is easy and basic.

What potential security issues?

Of giving applications access behind a NAT box? Nothing to worry about.

First try to get them working with the appropriate configurations.

One rule is not quite enough. You need multiple iptables rules.

OpenBSD pf is much simpler but you will have a learning curve.

Ignore Girish, he is just trying to scare you into thinking doing what you need 
is some sort of complicated dark magic which is better done using OpenBSD.

It is not all that complicated, if you understand what you are doing.

By this i assume that you have at least a basic understanding of how iptables 
and NAT work.

You need to load the 'ip_conntrack_ftp' and 'ip_nat_ftp' modules and ...

iptables -A INPUT -p TCP -i eth1 --dport 21 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p ALL -i eth1 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p ALL -o eth1 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

should do it (i think ..this is untested, i just made that up with a quick look 
at the docs).

However, the point is the ip_conntrack_ftp and ip_nat_ftp modules do all the 
required heavy lifting for ftp that Girish alluded to in his mail.

For VoIP and P2P ..although it can be done, NAT is not the most efficient thing 
to do for these protocols. It would be better if you used port forwarding rather 
than NAT. Look up google and you should find the reasons and the solutions.

All of this and more is very well documented, please take some time off to read 
the docs and come back with some more /specific/ questions:

I have corrected by doing some modifications and the file is below

#!/perl/bin/perl -wT
use CGI;
use CGI::Carp qw ( fatalsToBrowser );
use File::Basename;
$safe_filename_characters = "a-zA-Z0-9_.-";
$upload_dir = "c:/";
$query = new CGI;
$fname = $query->param('file_upload');
if ( $fname =~ /^([$safe_filename_characters]+)$/ )
{
 $fname = $1;
}
else
{
 die "Filename contains invalid characters";
}

my $upload_filehandle = $query->upload('file_upload');

open ( UPLOADFILE, ">$upload_dir/$fname" ) or die "$!";
binmode UPLOADFILE;

while ( <$upload_filehandle> )
{
 print UPLOADFILE;
}

close UPLOADFILE;
print $query->header();
print $query->start_html("upload");
print $fname." file Uploaded";
print $query->end_html();

This Code well works in Firefox but in ie i am getting internal server error
can you help me

Hi Steve,

Thanks a lot. It works like a breeze when the files are small (< 100MB)

However, it takes a jolly good 45 mins on a desktop with 2 GB of memory and
3.2 G P4

The code i am using is given below,

import csv
readerR25 = csv.reader(open('report_2_5.csv', "rb"))
cids = [line.strip() for line in open('prov_30.csv')]

rownum = 0

for row in readerR25:
    # Save header row.
    if rownum == 0:
        header = row
        print header
    else:
        if row and (row[0].strip() in cids):
            colnum = 0
            a += float(row[4].strip())
            b += float(row[7].strip())
            c += float(row[10].strip())
            d += float(row[13].strip())
            e += float(row[16].strip())
            ...

    rownum += 1
<< print / write to file >>
Is there someway i can optimize it to process in say 5 mins ? How do i
optimize this code further ?

i looked up on the net and found the following link which talks about
csv.field_size_limit , but, even setting it did not help.

http://lethain.com/entry/2009/jan/22/handling-very-large-csv-and-xml-files-in-python/

Aside, Steve, really appreciate the detailed email you had sent earlier. It
has really kick started me into python. :)

Thanks in advance

I did the same with my photon+ connection and made my laptop a NAT box.
All I did was to get firestarter (if you are using ubuntu it is in the
repository).
It has a simple configuration, I setup dhcpd on the machine that had the photon+
stick and it worked like a charm.

You can also configure your firewall settings with firestarter. It is
actually pretty
darn simple.

Change this line:

> cids = [line.strip() for line in open('prov_30.csv')]

with:

cids = {}
cids.fromkeys([line.strip() for line in open('prov_30.csv')])

and see if it makes the code run any faster.

I thought the cids file was much smaller and at best added a small
fixed overhead.

Steve

It makes sense when you say that the . & the .. are references to the
hierarchical previous & current directory. My question is a reference to a
previous directory is explainable but why would you need a reference to a
CWD? I don't mean to pull this any longer but I'm unclear about this.

Try thinking from the machine's point of view (ok, not that the
machine has a point of view!), how do you refer to a file in the CWD?

Dear all
I upgraded my machine from jaunty to karamic kola. Now Iam facing some
strange problems. Sometimes the system goes to *stuck* mode. At that time
mouse will be moving  but keyboard is not working.

If I try to install some packages I am getting the following error. For this
I tried all the solutions given in the Ubuntu forum. Still I am getting the
below given error. Any solution

If cids < 10 items, then it's no different.  But greater than 50 items,
a dictionary is definitely better.  Put it inside a loop and the effect is
further magnified.

I've done a fair bit of CSV processing in the past, and in my
experience, processing a 100MB file in 45 mins is slow.  I think a
scripting language should be able to do it under 1 minute, and C
about 20 seconds.

hi Arun,
          Web proxy browser are anonymous proxy server site that is great to
unblock work,school & home firewalls....for example--
www.*proxybrowsing*.com

u can also just type web proxy browser in google, it will display many sites
to u...These sites are redirecting the http request.....in these sites one
url box is there...if u want to open gmail, which is being restricted,
through these sites u can open gmail....but i don't know how its working
exactly....

i need to know about it....and also need to know how to block them....

Thank you

Like Steve did, I also disagree about this being hard. Try using a utility
like Shorewall and you will probably find this easier to set up. I'd urge
you to learn the detail config by hand though.

For H323, VoIP, SIP etc, make sure you've appropriate netfilter helper or
ALG modules loaded.

Generally speaking it is better to have the ftp box behind the NAT box. Look
up 3 zone firewall examples (I can send you one if need be). Such servers
are available on the DMZ zone which is a another LAN subnet in the private
address space. Routing is done between the two LAN subnets via the gateway
which will have 3 ethernet interfaces - one for the LAN, one for the
Internet and one for the DMZ. Connections on ftp port on the Public IP for
ftp is DNAT to the ftp server in the DMZ.

Just add those list of anon proxy websites in your block list , may be you
should try blocking the word 'proxy' ; Also try dansguardian
http://dansguardian.org/ ( i never tried it before )

I was primarily looking at the electronic encoding. But, even though the
meanings vary slightly depending on the context(specifically, only the
source and target format varies), the base meaning(conversion of information
from one format to another) remains the same, and that is what the
translation captures.

Umm <100MB is a /small/ file ? That is pretty large file as csv files go, IMHO.

Well, I assume that the cids is relatively small compared to the number of 
records in 'report_2_5.cvs'. Is that assumption correct ?

If it is, i think the bottle neck is the memory. I see that you delay writing 
the output till after the processing of all the rows. In that case what do you 
do with the information from the processed rows ? Does that remain in memory ?

If that is true, you might want to change the code to write out the output as 
soon as it is available.

Anyways, that is just a guess. Could you please send over a sample dataset as 
well as the code you've got till now so that I can take a look ? (I see Asokan 
also has requested the same, maybe you'll benefit from both our approaches :) ).

btw, if your data-set is really larger than 100MB, you may want to consider 
importing the data into a DB (like sqllite) before working on it. I already 
mentioned this in my last mail, but no harm in saying it again. Here are the 
links again:

Excellent ! It is always a pleasure inducting new junkies to the python 
addiction ;). You should consider joining one of the python user groups in 
India. The bangpypers, which are the banglore python users group recently 
conducted the first (very successful) Indian Python conference. I am sure the 
people on this list who were involved/attended it would be able to provide some 
links.

sir,

suggestion : for wooing new people for FOSS.

1. keep some old computers - with low RAM & HDD requirements - and install
good distros like Ubuntu etc. to show people that they can install even on
old PCs.

2. To show them how to install a linux distro in a PC (including dual
booting) - step by step (if possible in printed format)

3. show them open office - 3.1 - instead of Office

4. show them how to use yahoo messenger (gYachi) and Skype - in FOSS
software.

5. also show them the CDAC's eduBoss - particularly the one too make
multiple choice questions - preparation (mainly for teachers, tutors,etc)

6. to show them the full connectivity incl. webcam (I use 9.10 - it works
just out of the box in my laptop)

7. show them wifi (through a OLD laptop)

8. Printed sheet - having a lot of contacts, numbers, names, - who they can
call for assistance (we can later make them as volunteers who will help
other people, after using FOSS).

9. keep around 20 to 30 OLD PCs with FOSS software - for anyone to test, and
use internet etc.

hope you all dont laugh at these.

with warm regards

This is a good piece of software. It can run an evaluation of body content
and allow/deny based on phrases and word count profiles instead of just
headers. It also has a http command filter where by actions like POST/
SUBMIT can be denied for selected/specified sites. I used this 7 years ago
and it worked well.

Well. For about a million records of approx 50 char. ~50 MB it took me
under an hour to write a html file for each record, IIRC. It was
nearly 10 yrs back.

 "Install once, run many times!"

Hence it is not clear to me that showing novices the steps of
installation is really helpful.

Skype is not free software. However, showing that proprietary
software can also be run when needed by the person concerned is
certainly helpful.

Also put in web sites and other sources of information!

This is a nice idea with one small problem --- space/location.
Where will you keep these demo machines?

Not at all. Keep all the ideas flowing!

In the late 90s, there was a big push by many FOSS projects to develop 
Rapid Application Development environments for use under free Unixes 
since most of the MS Windows desktop programmers were comfortable with 
Visual Basic and Delphi rather than the commandline tools.

Gambas is one of the VB inspired projects which actually released a 
usable product and is usable under X11.

Lazarus is modelled upon Delphi and is written in Free Pascal and works 
in both Unixes and Windows.

Gambas is useful if you know VB and want something similar under X11 and 
works in both KDE and GNOME. Try this page for software done using 
Gambas : http://freshmeat.net/tags/gambas
To learn a bit about the capabilities of Gambas go through this wikibook 
: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Gambas

There are not many FOSS applications built using Gambas or Lazarus 
mainly because Basic and Pascal have the reputaion of being 
bondage-and-discipline languages. Gambas has a further disadvantage in 
that it is not usable under Windows. Lazarus seems to be more used under 
Windows than Unixes since it follows the philosophy of "write once, 
compile anywhere" and has a robust Windows user base.

Dabo written in python is much younger(apparently from 2004) when 
compared to Gambas(1999). It's main draw seems to be that it is not a 
yet another web framework (YAWF) written in python and is cross-platform 
as it is based on wxPython. The only other desktop framework in Python I 
am aware of is kiwi which is based on pyGTK, so mostly X11 specific. The 
newly released Ubuntu's quickly (https://launchpad.net/quickly) seems to 
include kiwi as a dependency - not sure of this.

On the Ruby side I am aware of Shoes http://github.com/shoes/shoes as a 
desktop counterpart to Ruby-on-Rails.

I am not aware of a Dabo or Shoes package for any Linux distribution. 
All the other packages are available in various distribution repos.

Disclaimer: I am not a VB, Delphi, Python or Ruby programmer though I 
can read code in those languages and mostly understand them. All the 
above is very incomplete and just based on stuff I read while being bored.

Regards,
Senthil

Not really. Their protocol library is going to remain closed. The
uninteresting UI bits are going to be open sourced. No real change.

That is fine. One can always come up with a new word for each type of
encoding, or use the base translation for encode and add the translation for
the type (for example, font, electronic, genetic, semantic etc) separately.
I just gave the base translation for the word "encode".

Friends.

My friend's company needs a open source CRM to be implemented.

Showed them VTigerCRM and SugarCRM.

Need your suggestions and experiences on these things.

How much they are useful?

Seems sugercrm lacks in reports on community edition.

is it so?

Do you have any implementation success stories for any of the CRM?

Please share.

Thanks.

If you can memorize this command line you have  a great memory.

$ convert -size 800x120 xc:white -font Times-Roman -pointsize 100
-fill gray -annotate +20+80 'Linux is cool' -fill black -annotate
+23+83 'Linux is cool' -trim +repage logo.png

All in one line.

Best thing to do is create a script in /usr/bin as root and give ugo+x
permissions with $1 as parameter for the first 'Linux is cool' and the
second too.

But you need to adjust the canvas size of 800x120 for longer text...

Dear Mr. kapil,

1. *showing them how to instal*

I feel one of the stumbling blocks for installing linux (atleast for an
average, regulat XP user, who has never installed anything on his own - they
form atleast 40 % of the users !!!!) particularly the partitioning, the
initial setting up, the user groups, the authentication, the updating, the
different desktop (gnome, kde) and dual booting.

It was the same for me, though i had downloaded 8.10, when I bought my
laptop in march 09, it took 2 months for me to install, as even the regular
dealers / resellers were not aware and said it will take 1 day for them to
install it.  Now, I know how to install, and generally it takes only 20 to
30 minutes max.  have helped people in installing atleast 30 to 40 persons
(Mandriva, Ubuntu, Open suse, Pardus, PC inux)

this long explanation is only to show, how much it is a mental block and how
to remedy.

2. many (not all & every) nowadays have chatting with their near & dear -
mainly with google talk, yahoo messenger & SKYPE.  and many have installed
webcam - to have video chat, atleast the home users.  when i installed many
versions incl. 9.04, i found it difficult to get the webcam recognised (i
have an integrated webcam in my laptop Lenovo 3000 G530). after addressing
many times in the forum, i could not get it resolved.  I just started using
XP mainly for this.

Now after clean installing U 9.10, automatically my webcam is recognised,
and i have started using skype & y. messenger.

I have been ridiculed by my family (jokingly) and my XP friends - on this.
this is just to show, how important is these small things, for a regular,
average user, who otherwise have to go to XP only.

So, showing them and helping them install these - by themselves - will make
them the jump to FOSS.

3. *printed sheet of contacts - in and around chennai.*

I feel obligated to help others in installing FOSS, since, many people
helped me in showing, installing, and made me to respect the efforts of FOSS
people.  I feel the same will happen to people who get helped by us, who
will later show it to others.  I am free on sundays and will go to any place
inside chennai to help them install FOSS.

4. *keeping old PCS and show them running.*

i have been to the FOSS day, 2 months back - at birla planetarium.  It was
good, and i have seen many people - from 10 to 60 years - coming to the
exhibition.   Though most of them will be knowledgeable in WINDOWS, and
maybe in FOSS too,

There must be around 20 to 30 PCS - of the exhibitors, new & not new. I
could not see anyone offering them to use these PCs, for evaluation
purposes.  (I know it is not going to be easy enough for any one to open his
personal PC / LAPTOP) to allow others to use.

In LINUX, we can have a seperate user - and allow them to use, creaate,
open, modify, delete, anything in that space.  Hope I not mistaken in this.

5. I would love to meet anyone -ILUGC - people this week, and help in some
making printing sheets - for circulation. also we can ask companies like
NOVEL, to give us (or purchase) Open suse, and we can create karmic koala
CDS, for giving it to those who are NEW to FOSS.

6. I have already been talking to Mr. srinivasan, verole, - CDAC, on the
BOSS, & eduBOSS.  hope they can also participate in this, and help NEW
people.

can I also request myself to be included in the FOSS event, I stay at
velacherry only.  I am not a well versed person in WINDOWS nor LINUX. just
an average person.

thanks for the encouragement.

there is another context that we deal with,

font encoding

Message-ID: <7f05469e0911102117p6761186em491b28dfc959248@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have developed the small application in linux. I would like to measure the
CPU &memory usage of this application.

tests:
1) CPU Usage of this application
2) Memory Usage of this application
3) Any memory leakage (measure the free memory before start the application,
measure the free memory after the application ends - both values should be
equal)
4)CPU check --- (Measure the CPU utilization before start the app, measure
the CPU usage after the application ends .....----- both values should be
equal)

I tried "ps -e -o pcpu,cpu,args --sort " command to measure the CPU
utilization of the process.

I am not sure how to check 2),3),4) the test.

can some one help.

thanks

It is not the right way. Many processes are running in the system, so
time to time usage may very in small amount and the memory used by the
application may not recollected imdly at the end of execution.

If the application is running for very short time, it is hard to see
the effect of memory leakage. So you should try memory debuggers like
valgrind to analysis the code.

Bye :)

Yes, it is possible to build reasonable size applications using Gambas.

This information is available on the Gambas website:
http://gambasdoc.org/help/app?en&view

Between Gambas and Lazarus, I prefer Lazarus. The reason being that
Lazarus allows you to use a lot of the Delphi components which are
available. Also, I prefer object pascal to basic, but that is just a
personal preference.

Just one of the sites with loads of Delphi source code and components:
http://delphi.icm.edu.pl/

Note that since Lazarus does not exactly match Delphi line to line, there
may be changes needed to get some of these components working.

Other options:

1. Monodevelop
http://monodevelop.com/

2. Also, may I know why you don't favour using Java? IDEs like Netbeans
and Eclipse can be used to develop swing apps. Also, these IDEs have good
tools for working with databases. If you prefer, you could use JavaFX to
create some nifty GUIs and it is all fully supported within Netbeans and
Eclipse.

If you feel so inclined, you could build your application to use the 
Netbeans or Eclipse application frameworks and so you will get a lot of
functionality for free. It is actually quite easy to do:

For netbeans:
http://www.javalobby.org/eps/netbeans_platform/

There are literally 1000s of programs using the Netbeans / Eclipse
frameworks.

3. If you don't mind working with C++, you could use the QT, WxWidgets or
the Gtk framework.

4. Ofcourse, if you prefer dynamic languages and you don't need an IDE for
development, you could use Shoes for Ruby or the innumerable options
available for Python.

Regards,
Prem

thank you all for the reply. ftp is working fine after adding the
iptable rules. now i have started to dig into port forwarding to find
ways to make h323, sip work.

we are doing this exercise to bring up a BRAS server (for testing
purpose). its in this server we are adding the firewall rules to make
ftp, sip, h323 etc work.

we are not actually interested in configuring a complete BRAS. our
goal is to test our product with the BRAS server. so we prefer a BRAS
with basic functionality.

the basic doubt that i have is, if NATing, conntracking, Masquerading
are the functions of the BRAS. i believe a BRAS server (be it adsl or
any broadband service) assigns a private IP address to the modem/PC.
if this is the case, NATing/masquerading must happen somewhere in the
ISP network. can someone give clarity in this regard?

note: if this is not the right place to ask this question, i apologise
for sending this mail.

regards,
Narendran

Hi Bharathi,

How does "time" command helps for measuing the cpu usage?

thanks again.

It is not the right way. Many processes are running in the system, so
time to time usage may very in small amount and the memory used by the
application may not recollected imdly at the end of execution.

If the application is running for very short time, it is hard to see
the effect of memory leakage. So you should try memory debuggers like
valgrind to analysis the code.

Use the GNU Profiler "gprof" for accurate CPU usage reporting.
There's plenty of documentation online to help you get started.

Memory leaks happen while your program is executing.  Once it
exits, the OS will reclaim all memory back into the free pool.

To debug memory leaks in your app, try Valgrind or Electric Fence.

There are many other tools to choose from:

Message-ID: <7938ae610911110042i69e5b031i40d6785b823db79e@mail.gmail.com>

I have started close to 5 projects on sf.net but most are not of
general use. This one is.

http://liveusb-openbsd.sf.net

Please download the 7z image of the binary image to write to a USB memory stick.

If the link on that page does not work since the mirroring system
would not have picked up
my recent upload, then you could try this link:

http://spam-cheetah.com/usb.bin.7z

All you have to do is:

# 7z e usb.bin.7z

You will get the file usb.bin which has to dd(1) ed to the USB memory stick.

On linux you would have to do:

# dd if=usb.bin of=/dev/sda bs=8192


You have to know which device is your USB memory stick from dmesg. If
you use a SATA disk then the above
command will kill you! ;)

sda will be your hard disk. You have to know if it is sdb, sdc, sdd or whatever.

Under OpenBSD, I just say /dev/rsd0c or /dev/rsd1c for devices
connected one after another. Under linux the
naming scheme is different.

Have fun!

I did this since I needed a bootable image for my upcoming LUG talk.

See you in the talk.

Best,
Girish

Happy to see that many people are interested in Carte Blanche.

A quick note: IMHO it is better that discussion continues on this list so
that many people can contribute to it. But for any reason you need to
contact us personally(to talk about keeping a stall, for instance) mail us
at: contact_AT_csmit_DOT_org

@Sivakumar,
    Thank you for all your suggestions. We appreciate any suggestion, big or
small.

  FOSS assistance group? :-) Anyone willing to be on this group please send
your contact details to this list or above e-mail id.

   This should not be a problem. MIT has a big hangar, where we can run the

Linux has been using /dev/sdX for SATA as well as IDE disks since a

Dear Suresh,

Your e-mail ID rings a bell. I think I have spoken to you over mobile
but I am sure you would
not remember.

No need to register to attend the meet.

The way things are in "namma ooru" , laduva platela vecha pothathu!

Eduthu vaila vaikanum. Appo than makkal sapiduvanga.

If you have registrations, then nobody will come. LOL!

4.6 release.

-current is for development and 4.6 stable is a branch for patches.

I never track patches. If I develop I use -current.

But this is based on the 4.6 release done on Nov 1.

Thanks for reminding me this. I shall update this in the project main page.

And I have done it. Check out.

Hi,
       Almost all our discussions so far are confined to open software,
open source now-a-days has its influence in many domains like OPEN HARDWARE.
It will be a good venture if CARTE BLANCHE includes events that would throw
light on open hardware.

There is a general illusion that open source is meant only for softwares. It
will be a good chance to change this scenario if the concept of open
hardware is included in CARTE BLANCHE.

You could have a timed programming contest where people can use any
F/OSS tool to implement a solution, and each team (or individual) can
share their solution with others with a short, five minute
presentation (lightning talk) on how they have solved the problem.

The winners should be everyone, who have learnt how to solve a problem
in different ways, and how different people have approached the same
problem, and not the prize/gift that is given to a team or individual,
IMHO.

\--

In the workshops, I would appreciate if you could provide the
possibility of people to sit together (with desktops and laptops), and
do hands-on work.

Visitors have to join in to see, and participate in practical work, to
get the real experience. For example:

1. If you organize an introductory emacs hands-on session, say for
couple of hours, people can try it on their laptops, or with available
desktop computers. You could give them paper hand-outs or short-cuts
for reference.

2. If you setup a local Git or Mercurial repository, you could run a
two-hour session on how one can use these for source control
management, and people should learn to start using them in their
day-to-day work.

Internet is not required for such activities. These can greatly
complement the content delivered in the stalls.

The hands-on is a very important exercise, because, if people get
stuck they can always seek immediate help from other people at the
event, get their doubts clarified, or mistakes rectified, giving them
the confidence to work independently.

End of the day, people should go back home with the satisfaction that
they have learnt something new, try it again at home or at college,
use it on a daily basis, and ask us for more information, if required.

Our infrastructure is not designed for such kind of work,
unfortunately, but, that is one of the challenges that we should work
towards, if more people are to use/work with the system.

Ya that would be helpful to many because, i too struggled at the beginning
for my project, until i become familiar with the commands....
I would be happy if i would get an opportunity to show a demo on setting up

FYI, BeableBoard is a Open hardware project.
However, the workshop will be focused on BB, its features, Running OS like Debian, Angstrom, Fedora,.etc; Not on the hardware design/schematic part. Coz the target audience are the beginners.

Normally ISP will try to avoid NAT at BRAS. Bcoz, 1st: NAT is
resource consuming task, due to need of packet level processing.
2nd: To answer Legal and security issues, like threat mail, ISP
should maintain packet level logs for all the subscribers for nearly
6 months.

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0911111004k7ba03e9gc815c0b2216535ed@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Today, I had some interesting talk with some farmers.

They produce groundnuts and face some issues when they sell.

They could not measure the humidity in the nuts and
this causes the merchants to say that "the nuts are wet".

Dry nuts are the qualified one.
People still measure the humidity by eating some nuts.

:-)

Is it possible to build a humidity sensors using any open source hardware like
Aurdino / Breagle board and connect them to a PC to show the humidity
of the nuts?

Am i asking a crazy question?

May be.

but still, this is a real life problem.

If we give a FOSS solution, it will save so many farmer's life.

Please give your ideas.

Thanks.

The complexity is in building a system that measures the humidity: collect
statistically valid samples,  weigh them , then grind , then heat them till
all liquid substances are evaporated, then weight them again, find the
difference in weight, make allowances for the volatile veg oil that also
evaporated.... you then have the qty of water that was there in the sample.
And build a system that will automate the above listed steps!! Unless there
are some gauges that can output digital signals proportional to the humidity
when a sample is placed inside/on it!!

Compared to the challenges above, using open source / propreitary / any
board to interface with a linux/openbsd/solaris/whatever to produce human
digestible data is too insignificant a problem to worry about in the
beginning.

Basically, the problem is too complex to proceed on the basis that I have
this XYZ tool, how do I use this tool to solve this problem. Rather the
approach should be what tools I need to solve this problem?

Go to shoutcast.com and have fun playing Tamil music!

You have to give the -playlist option since many streaming radio
stations have a m3u or some other playlist
format for their Internet radio stations.

You can also stream video from the web using the same command line.

Basically any mplayer playable file can be played using the above
command since mplayer automatically streams using

+1. Perhaps, it's easier to start looking at existing solutions and 
figure out ways to reverse-engineer them in a cost-effective way:

That is not a solution. I just imagined how the process would be.

The above seems to be the existing solution. Am not sure a 'tech' solution
would beat the above anytime soon :-)

even after 200 years, the best way to test the quality of tea is by tea 
tasting. The only connection between linux and a groundnut is that both have a

Eating nuts to test the moisture content might be the most reliable solution but 
it is unscientific[1]. A quick google led me to this which might be of interest 
to the OP:
"""
        The moisture content of each sample was determined
using the method described by ASAE (1983), Ajibola et al.
(1990), Oje (1993), Aviara et al. (2002) and Oluwole et al.
(2004). The method involved oven drying of pod samples at
130?C with weight loss monitored on hourly basis to give an
idea of the time at which the weight began to remain con-
stant. After oven drying for about 3 h, the weight of samples
was found to remain constant. After 6 h of oven drying, the
pods were weighed using an electronic balance weighing to
0.001 g to determine the final weight. The moisture content
was determined using the formula (Oluwole et al., 2004):

M C = [(Wi - W f ) / W f ] 100 (d.b.),                  (1)
where: MC ? moisture content (%), Wi ? initial mass of pods
(g), Wf ? final mass of pods (g), (d.b.) ? dry basis.
"""

Taken from
http://www.international-agrophysics.org/artykuly/international_agrophysics/IntAgr_2006_21_1_179.pdf

Now, I left biology back in school and have never looked back. I just found that 
link with a quick google.
http://www.google.com/search?xq=test+groundnuts+moisture+content

There might be better solutions out there.

Now about [1]:
<rant>
unscientific in the terms that it is subjective and not-experimentally 
repeatable. It always annoys me when people take an unscientific approach 
towards measurement. At the risk of being flamed, i'd say there is something 
very Indian about this unscientific approach. Sure, India brings some of the 
best scientists but our run of the mill 'engineers' by and large rely on 
instinct rather then measurement and proof compared to engineers from countries 
which impart better quality education.

Why am i getting so riled up ? Well, i see the same kind of reasoning when 
software engineers do performance tuning and or memory tuning for their 
applications. They first hit the code to see what /feels/ like it /might/ be a 
performance bottle neck and then go ahead and devote large amount of time and 
effort to changing it -- without even once trying to confirm their instincts. No 
number collecting, no profiling ...just go by instinct ! bah !
</rant>

heh ...that said, I wish the OP luck. I agree with most people who suggested 
that the OP first try to solve the problem of measurement and only once that is 
done, try to use an open source tool to help with the task.

cheers,
- steve

Exactly ! ...and i am sorry i forgot to mention that (although I thought about 
referring to it as an example of good engineering thinking) in the process of 
ranting ...ans it was too little, too late after hitting the send button.

anyways, I agree, this is OT now.

Friends.

3 years back, I got some CorelDraw CDR files.
I wanted to edit them and could not do in linux.

Dropped that project. :-(

But, Today found that there is a nice image convertor.
UniConvertor

It can convert to and from many vector graphics formats.

Message-ID: <47d9fe5c0911121527t5f61d169xca7564ff1dd53bcd@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I just stumbled on an interesting bit of news at the BBC site here:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8352606.stm

The new PC designed specifically for older people, who're using
computers for the first time. And guess what, it runs on Linux.

The page at http://www.discount-age.co.uk/simplicity_computers/isitsecure/ says:
"The simplicity computer is powered by Eldy and runs the Linux Mint
operating system. Linux Mint and Eldy are far more immune to viruses,
spyware and Trojans and other security threats than other systems.
Best of all, Linux Mint is completely free, as are all the
applications, as well as all updates and upgrades to future versions."

So Mint is the base, and Eldy runs on top of it. I'm hoping some
vendor in India creates Linux-only PCs like Emperor Linux, System76,
etc..

shows the sorted view of space occupied by files and directories under /usr.

Of course this is not very useful as you cannot remove anything there.

You should try it on some user created dir.

And you should also know that the du -hsc switch displays in a much

you don't have to calculate how man KBs make and MB...

It is far more useful.

what does 'not able to browse mean'? In fedora 11 one needs to eplicitly set 
the default route - it does not have the intelligence to find it out. What is 
the output of 'route' command? and ifconfig command?

Despite Groklaw's title, this is closer to PolicyKit rather than sudo

actually you need to run:
route add default gw xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx where the xxx is the gateway
you have to do this everytime you switch to a new provider in fedora.

Not true. I've been using Fedora for a long time and with different providers 
and I've never had to do this.

You do have to add the correct dns though, since wvdial (or rather pppd) does 
not add it to /etc/resolv.conf but rather to /var/run/pppd/resolv.conf. 
Moreover, NetworkManager in Fedora manages all thing network related including 
the dns.

For the OP, I would suggest either of these two approaches:

a. Configure your aircel connection using NetworkManager. ie: Connect your phone 
and click the NetworkManager icon in your panel (the one that looks like the 2 
monitors) and see if there is an option to create a new GSM/GPRS connection. If 
there is click on that and follow the instructions. If there isn't in most 
likely NetworkManger could not detect your phone as a GPRS capable modem, so 
you'll have to try (b)

b. run the following commands as root:
$ service NetworkManager stop
$ wvdial
# and possibly in another terminal
$ ln -sf /var/run/pppd/resolv.conf /etc/

You can of course start wvdial in the background (wvdial &) and put all 3 
commands as a script.

cheers,

Hi,

Try this link.

http://goinggnu.wordpress.com/2008/02/14/recover-deleted-files-from-memory-card/


It worked for me to recover deleted files.

No idea about formatted filesystem.

I hope that it will work.

Have a try.

Take a backup of card using "dd".
do all your experiments with the dd copy only.

Wishes.

Post your experiences.

Well, these were an IMPORTANT set of pictures which i had adored when I was
viewing via my DSLR and accidentally formatted it while setting some other
control (never happened to me in the last 3 years!!). So, i was a little
restless and impatient(and what not..). And after a sleepless night checking
for probable softwares i had the followig considerations:
1) All the pictures should be recovered
2) The pictures should not be scaled down - mine is a 6MP DSLR and i was
shooting at JPEG Fine - so the picture quality should be retained.
3) I dont have a card reader, connect my DSLR to comp via a USB port - so
this interface shouldnt cause any probable problems in recovery. (subtle
issue, but can cause some big pain in the a$$)
4) Software should be free (but could have bought it if it was REALLY good)
5) If i am trying on this Linux, then the SD card should retain its sanctity
so that i can try out in other OSes and compare the experiences.

After some more restlessness, i finally decided that i would try my luck
with this <http://www.mjm.co.uk/freephotorecoverysoftware.html>software. And
i am happy now that all was recovered.  Also, i was surprised to see some of
my older pictures (shot in Kashmir/Ladakh etc in July) , after which the SD
card was formatted a few times , been recovered too.

Am in the process of trying this recovery process in Linux now. Might as
well write my own mem block reader ;)

So if its wrong, you can correct the mistake right..! but why do you keep on sending mails like this..? I think you hav no rights to talk about the intelligence of others, so if you dont like people sending mails without a proper subject line you can simply ignore, or just tell the guidelines or you can simply **leave** off this list right?

wrong. This list is governed by peer pressure - every member has the right and 
duty to correct mistakes of others. And it is highly irritating to have the 
thread messed up by message recycling. If you do not want to be corrected by 
fellow members *you* can simply leave. Right?

ya correction can be done, but in a very ***decent*** way ( and not the way you are doing) without talking about others **intelligence**..
But why cant you do that??

Hmm, interesting. Could you please elaborate ? You should not have to do that at 
all. If you do, that's a bug and you should report it. However, lets try and 
debug this first ...
a. What sort of connection do you have to do this for ?
b. What tool do you use to make the connection, NetworkManager/wvdial ?
c. Do you have any other connections active ?[1]
d. Could you please paste the output of 'route -n', before and after you've 
changed the default route ?

cheers,

[1] one possibility where you /might/ have to reset the routes (i just thought 
of this), is if you are connected to an ethernet connection using NetworkManager 
and dial out using wvdial, in which case, i /think/ what might happen is NM 
reset the default route -- all this is just guess work tho.

Kenneth, you are right. I just opened the mail when the subject
indicates about the ILUGC monthly meet. It is always nice to have a
correct subject line and also good to accept the mistakes.

There are 2 issues here:
a. The fact that you did not follow the list guidelines
b. The manner in which Kenneth corrected you

In the eyes of the list members (a) is a bigger fault that (b).

You have to understand that not bothering to read the list guidelines or not 
following it even though you've read it is *much* more offensive to old time 
list members than the tone that Kenneth used.

Not following the rules indicates that you somehow think that you are special 
and that other members should accommodate your actions, while you disregard any 
courtesy.

Why must Kenneth be ***decent*** (sic) when it is you who have been discourteous 
to everyone on this list ? It's like using a phone in a theater -- if you do it, 
somebody might politely ask you not to do it but you also have to be ready to be 
yelled at -- so it's best if you don't do it at all and even if you do, be 
humble enough to accept your mistake.

If you can't do that, just grow a thick skin, because you'll most likely be 
flamed by others.

Don't expect sympathizers from the set of people who you disrespect by expecting 
privileged treatment.

cheers,
- steve

I demonstrated this problem at Gnunify - and a few RedHat heavyweights tried 
to solve it. They could not.
> a. What sort of connection do you have to do this for ?

all connections - both usb and ethernet. For the usb modem, the gateway is 
hard coded so that works.

network manager/wvdial for usb and network manager for ethernet

the problem arises when I switch my laptop from one ethernet to another (home

this is after changing the default - before changing the last line is missing,

I'm sorry.

I just noticed that it wasn't you who sent out the mail without the correct 
subject line, you were just asking Kenneth to tone it down. Ah well, that's his 
choice ...and also your's to respond in a similar manner -- but please take your 
issues with each other off-line.

Not really, (but I understand why you feel it's ironic). I don't think it was 
because the abuse of the mailing list was directed at it's members (and so at 
me). I'm sure, you'd have felt personally offended if I were to start spamming 
the list.

As soon as i discovered my mistake, i /did/ apologize and now this doesn't 
really interest me all that much.

cheers,
- steve

Is there any such software in Windows?

You don't want the voice part? Then karoke is the only solution.

$ mplayer -af karaoke foo.mp3

What you are trying to do is similar to separating milk and water.

Or separating colors after mixing them with water.

Usually in professional audio recordings 16 tracks or more are
employed. And if you
maintain the separate tracks then you can get rid of the voice track.

But in an mp3 file, there is only one track.

Well, firstly, not everyone in Red Hat (btw, that's the name -- it is 2 words), 
knows everything about every tool, even the heavyweights and if they did claim 
to know a lot about NetworkManager but could not fix the issue, it strongly 
indicates a bug (since the general populace do not have ready access to Red Hat 
heavyweights who could suggest workarounds as you possibly do :) ).

So, like I mentioned maybe you should report it, but before that ...

What do you mean by hard coded ? Did you add it to the routes in the GUI tool 
(ie: nm-applet->right click->edit connections->select connection->edit->ipv4 
settings->route) ?

I ask because if that is not the way you did it, I suspect the system will try 
to apply this 'hardcoded' route to /every/ connection.

ok.

Again, this also indicates that the default gateway is being 'set' or 'reset' 
from someplace outside of NM (and when it fails -- which it would if the 
gateways doesn't belong to the network you are setting it for -- you end up with 
an empty default gateway).

I had my laptop connected to a projector, so everyone in the room could see

Yes, sorry for the confusion. That's what I meant (empty == not being set).

Anyways, could you also paste the contents of 
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 ? and paste (or pastebin) the log 
messages from /var/log/messages when you switch a connection using NetworkManager ?

I was wrong - the gateway is not entered anywhere. wvdial seems to find it. It 
is only in ethernet connections that this problem arises.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
That's not right, if you expect NM to set the routes for you.

I think i know what the problem is ! You configured the network connection using 
system-config-network but control it using NetworkManager.

Here is what I suggest you try:
a. run system-config-network
b. choose eth0 and click "edit"
c. check mark the 'Controlled by NetworkManager' option right below the name of 
the connection.
d. exit out of system-config-network
e. right-click the NetworkManger applet (btw, if you are running kde make sure 
it is the NetworkManager applet you have running in the panel, *not* the kde 
whatsitcalled thingy for network control -- you can tell by right clicking and 
verifying the 'About') and click 'Edit connections'
f. Add a new wired connection (the good thing about NM is you can have multiple 
wired connections 'configurations' for the same device, and can seamlessly 
switch between them -- just name them differently)
g. try it out and report back.

cheers,
- steve

I assume that you do know that the configurations are listed when you /left/ 
click the NM icon (that is something that eluded me because NM always /just 
worked/ on all my wireless connections. Came to know about this switching 
profiles for the same device only when i started using eth0 and vpn connections).

I am on gnome, and there is no NetworkManager applet (I remember the fedora 
guys removed it and could not get it back

so how do I get the NetworkManager applet to show? I rebooted, and had to add 
the default route by hand.

I've used PDF ToolKit. <http://www.accesspdf.com/pdftk/> It works
pretty well. I've watermarked PDFs in the past. Hope it does what you
need.

Xournal is your friend. A thread on this subject did go on about a month 
ago. Okular is another but does not save the annotations as pdf for 
viewing in any pdf reader.

network-manager is a service. /etc/init.d/network-manager start and 
/etc/init.d/network-manager-dispatcher start. If it is working fine, 
then enable it using system-config-service

Ok, here is what you do:
a. execute as root:

$ service NetworkManager restart

if that doesn't show up the network manager applet in your panel, execute (as 
the logged in user):

$ nm-applet

if that errors out ..copy/paste the error here. If it doesn't and the applet 
does show up go the 'System' entry in the main panel and then 
"Preferences->Startup Applications". Scroll down and search for Network Manager 
and enable it. If no such entry exists, click the "Add" button and enter:

Name: Network Manager
Command: nm-applet --sm-disable
Comment: whatever

after the applet shows up do (f) and (g) above.

cheers,

what has this got to do with GPRS Connection in Fedora? Please learn how to 
post. Start with a 'new' message. Fill in the mailing list address. But a 
meaningful subject line. Write down your question. Press send. Do not put a

Hi,
    IMHO, one of the hurdles in switching to GNU/linux, that most of
my friends feel, is the mindset that the softwares for linux are hard
to find and install, mostly for those who don't have internet access.
Won't it be nice if there is a stall at Carte Blanche where the most
commonly used softwares are distributed free of cost?
    We can collect the list of softwares used widely by students and
maintain a local repository of the same. It will help to remove the
mental hurdle of atleast a few people.

This also a hurdle . GNU/Linux evolved out of internet so the basic
software distribution runs on it .
If you are 'connected' there is nothing stopping you.

You can have a local repo :
1. if you have a local network .
2. If you are willing to keep one machine to be on all the time .

Local repo's are good to have in college campuses. I think all the
IIT's and NIT's have their own fedora or ubuntu repo's these days and
it helps save lot of bandwidth ( if they are also connected to
internet)

But as I said you need to already have a local network running else
its hard to 'distribute' softwares.

IMHO CD/DVD distribution of data is pass? and is still seen with
people using win* distributions .  Hence newbies coming from those
distro's will want something of that sort.

Maybe a fedora DVD[1] or Ubuntu DVD[2] can be remixed to create
packages for those who still want those 'disks' .

A remix/spin burning stall would be good idea !

I have used an external USB disk to distribute and setup Fedora 10, 11

 Hi all,

I am new to Diameter protocol. I am planning to use open source

openDiameter source code is in C++ and supporting AAA,EAP, NAS, MIP4
applications. Similarly I want to develop Gx, Gy interfaces. Can any body
pl. tell me how i should proceed and how i should add new commands and AVPs
to Opendiameter stack. Also my application is in C and i want to invoke the
Diamater API from application.


Thanks in Advance

job 1258205400.c at Sat Nov 14 19:00:00 2009

will execute the command "ls /" at 7pm.

Please remember, it is a little tricky. I have had issues with it.

It relies on cron and also a daemon(atd) or something to run. Only
then it will work.

But it can be really useful. It remembers the working directory from
which you execute the command. The output will be sent as mail
to you.

You can execute this as a regular user of course.

Moreover you can give a file as

$ at -f script.sh Monday

at is brilliant when it comes to understanding time. It can read your mind. ;)

Well vastly improved implies by sweet meaning of "vastly". :)

http://liveusb-openbsd.sourceforge.net

Now there are two versions, a Lite and a Full version and then you also have
 firefox, pidgin and every imaginable utility in the full version.

Moreover there are pretty screenshots in the page.

You can connect to the Internet by logging in as root and then executing

# dhclient vr0

if your network card is a via rhine.

Please check with ifconfig.

Or assign a static IP and use.

Thanks.

The mplayer screenshot is from the great Rajni Amala movie "Kodi
parakuthu" in the late 80s I think.

The music is brilliant. The song is "Kadalennai..."

I am told that the music director is not Illayaraja but still the
music is fantastic.

This particular song is really great. Both Amala and Rajni have done a
great job.

This mail is fodder for a great flame war but if something good comes

I take the "pothu poku varathu" (public transport) buses to move

And whenever I pass through Nandanam, my heart experiences a certain
coolness and my soul gets
stirred deeply by the surreal and immensely appealing artwork done by
Chennai city officials.

And guess what? It is free. I don't have to pay anything. It is really
wonderful!

The first thought that came to me when I saw that genius was this:

If India has so much talent, then what are the idiots in the Bangalore
IT industry doing?

Why should we paint a picture of slavery and poverty and lack of
infrastructure when we have so much
talent with us?

I cannot but wonder.

FWIW, indeed there are some vendors who are doing it.  Lately, I have 
seen Acer laptops being advertised (in the B2B rags) with their Linpus 
Linux distro pre-installed and a lower price tag (avg. 4K) v/s 
counterpart with Windows pre-installed.  They are also offering the 
D250 Netbook with Linpus at around 17K now.

nothing to beat MSI WIND netbook which comes with opensuse - everything works

Have a look at 'edbrowse' while you are at it. It also allows you to

Message-ID: <200911141044.02230.knura@yahoo.com>

Good day list members,

In my search for a notebook with a CPU that supports either Intel-VT or 
AMD-V, the list has narrowed down to:

a) Acer 5542 (AMD Athlon M300)
b) Acer 3810T (Intel SU3500 ULV)

Even though the CPU supports VT, the BIOS may be b0rked by the 
manufacturer (i.e no VT setting as in a brand name starting with V...)

I would appreciate feedback/comment from anyone who has used either of 
the above models and verified that VT can be enabled through BIOS and 
that the kernel loads the respective KVM modules.

TIA

The Acer is _lighter_ which may may a difference for older people.

One other interesting machine on offer is the Samsung NC 110 (or is it
120 or 138?) which offers 9-11 hours of battery life. This means that
you need not lug around the charger during the day.

yeah but linpus is of no use whatsoever, so the oldie needs someone to install 
something useful (and we all know how geeks are about installing things). With 
wind, she just needs to switch it on and use it. And nothing OT about 
discussing the needs of the elderly in computing.

Conky is good if you are just looking for system stats and things like
that.  A good sample is at

This thread is about how Linux makes using PCs easier for older
people. So I guess it just fits in. Not technical, though. But we're
all Linux users here, and I thought it might interest a few luggies.

Good,

When you say, that you are teaching/training others. Then you need come out
of your solution document[1]. Then it would be easy or your may feel
comfortable to an explain the concepts with the confident, Also you could
tackle their questions in nice manner.

If you look into others solution it may look easy for them, not for us. It's
just a thought. I feel the same way whenever I took some ready  made code
samples to the training session I feel hard.



[1]  Solution document may contains examples, notes and some exercise.

Hi Ravi,

Thanks for your inputs.

You are right. No external material can beat the own preparation.
I am doing the same.

But, sometimes the internet helps us to show the things in a new way.

For example, It will be so nice, if we show the video
http://www.warriorsofthe.net/
on a networking class.

People found interest to see the video
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxENKlcs2Tw
on sorting.

:-)

In my previous post, I requested for some links like these only.

I strongly believe that no extra materials can beat our own examples /
explanations from reallife.
But the visual media adds some bells and whistles.

Thanks for the Quote. :-)

You must be right.

The problem with wget is that it does not overwrite existing files. So
I normally get into
trouble when I get a file under /tmp when the file is already there.
It writes a new version with the
.1 suffix, if that is found, it writes with a .2 suffix and so on.

The main reason I download from the Internet is to overwrite the old
version with the new version.

But wget get it contrariwise. ;)

The -c switch avoids that problem.

Hi Ravi,

Thanks for your inputs.

You are right. No external material can beat the own preparation.
I am doing the same.

But, sometimes the internet helps us to show the things in a new way.

For example, It will be so nice, if we show the video
http://www.warriorsofthe.net/
on a networking class.

People found interest to see the video
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxENKlcs2Tw
on sorting.

:-)

In my previous post, I requested for some links like these only.

I strongly believe that no extra materials can beat our own examples /
explanations from reallife.
But the visual media adds some bells and whistles.

Thanks for the Quote. :-)

Hi,
I am looking forward for a solution for my problem,

"We need to archive certain individual mails so that it shall be
available for future reference for any within the organization. i.e
the user should be able to send the mail (along with the attachments),
this mail has to be published as web page/wiki so that it is available
to anyone in the organization for future reference".

we have looked at the following,

http://drupal.org/project/femail -> doesn't have support for attachements
http://www.socialtext.net/open/index.cgi?socialtext_open_release_2_15_0_1
-> couldn't find the installer/tar ball in the sourceforge.

Any suggestions/ideas would be helpful.

Thanks,

The requirement is a bit vague so a number of a solutions are
possible. For example, using mhonarc as follows:

 1. A specific e-mail address is reserved for this system.
 2. Only designated people (i.e. "From:" addresses) are allowed to
 send mail to this address.
 3. The mailbox is processed periodically using cron.
 4. The periodic process runs mhonarc to create the web page(s).

How's this for a solution -- Install a mailing list software (like mailman for 
instance) and configure your mail server to forward every mail to a specific 
mailing list id (for instance mailbackups@yourmailserver.com). Then the archives 
serve the purpose of web pages containing the emails:

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/

for which you get the gzipped text too.

If you want some thing more user friendly, for example you need to include user 
access control or the ability to 'download' the attachments not as they are 
shown in the archives (ie: base64 encoded plain text block), you can create a 
web page/cgi script which does this in the background and presents the 
mails+attachments in the archive in a more 'user friendly' manner.

Note: Attachments they can be extracted from the plain text mail easily using a 
filter (many such scripts are already available -- if you don't find any, i (or 
someone else here) can create one for the OP quickly).

cheers,
- steve

This started happening from the day (few days back) I marked quite number of
mails from ILUGC with social network invites. There may have been others
also who would have marked thos mails as spam.

Subject: [Ilugc] [LANGUAGETIP - C ] mplayer patch for footpedal in medical 
	transcription
Message-ID: <7938ae610911150153l4b5b7f41n99b6601e1cea3dc3@mail.gmail.com>

This is a sequel to last week's tip about the footpedal access using
the serial port.

I figured out how to interface the footpedal with the PC and recognize
the pedal presses but I had an important problem.

The goal of this real life project was to help medical transcription
folks to be able to rewind(left pedal), pause and play(middle pedal)
and fast forward(right pedal) with the footpedal when transcribing the
doctor's audio feed.

After vacillating between sox, audacity and vlc, suddenly when
speaking to Shuveb I found that mplayer comes with brilliant
support for seeking which no other player gives.

That was the main issue. Usually audio and video players come with a
slider that you have to drag to rewind and fwd. That is not
what I want.

And I finished this project in no time after that. This is why having
intelligent friends are important.

Nearly all my friends are from LUG only.

That is why I put up with all the bad aspects of ILUGC. I gain so much
that occasional insults are fine. ;)

Anyway now please go to this page:

http://gayari-hitech.com/languageclasses

and go to the medical transcription part. I have put up the diffs and
the full source of footpedal.c which I added to the directory
MPlayer-1.0.rc2/input

Hopefully the source files are self explanatory.

Most real life purposes involves changing existing code. I did this
work with a bit of hard work and a lot of guess work. ;)

You can easily find out how the existing code works. And then you do
"copy paste" to fit your needs.

 Look at the value I created. You can now use the footpedal in Windows
for medical transcription. This is for free!

Wonderful no? All it took me was a week.

Assuming you still have those mails lying in your spam folder, would marking
it 'Not Spam' make gmail unlearn the old heuristics?

I just marked all ILUGC mail as Not Spam. If other gmail users also do
that.... lets see if it corrects itself!

But I am regularly marking ILUGC mails being marked as SPAM in gamil as 'NOT
SPAM' . Hopefully, gmail will learn this.

I should certainly add the help rendered by Arun Venkataswamy of
Kavyasoft (http://www.kavyasoft.com) for  Windows serial port access.

He is a kind soul who mailed me out of the blue from LUG and bought me
a dinner at Adyar Cafe
Coffee Day and also took me to Besant Nagar beach in his car. ;)

Without the help of my friends I could not have wrapped this up quickly.

Thanks once again.

It is not just to the organizer. It is for everyone who is interested in
attending the meet. They too may have some suggestions right..

           I dont know why you guys are reading ilugc mailing list posts via
emails.You can easily read via gmane[1].I think it is easier then reading via
emails which is very painful and the digests will easily dump your inbox so soon
because of the Loads of activities in the recent days.

Happy to know that they go for a RDBMS from Access for details of 4.13
crore electors with their images.

So sad for them for choosing MS SQL server.

Is there any way to tell them about PostgreSQL and MySQL?

Message-ID: <7938ae610911151515o1bec29cdn542ec6a2b428c6cb@mail.gmail.com>

Sorry guys and girls,

This time it is a tip for OpenBSD.

$ cksum -a sha512 /etc/passwd
SHA512 (/etc/passwd) =
b4d6a742cada5305686832f1037b60f79b56fe6dfdf9904e6070295e74
c2341535db26b731e27e04a73f0cb70bb589d31b8e9e18e207a8aae5aa81d06ea29f5a

prints a very long checksum. This is also known as message digest or
cryptographic hash in
 crypto parlance.

In fact the RSA algorithm is based on this message digest algorithm
but I don't think many people
recognize this fact.

RSA is basically an implementation of this concept a^b^c = a ^c^b =
a^bc with modulo N thrown in.

But the math will crumble down without relying on the cryptographic
hash mechanism.

Think of fingerprinting or signature.

Now talking of signatures, PKI signatures also rely on message digests
but that is a detail.

IOW cksum(1) tells you whether a file has changed or not. For instance
corrupted downloads and uploads
can easily be detected by this utility.

Here are the algorithms you can specify with the -a switch.

 cksum
 md4
 md5
 rmd160
 sha1
 sha256
 sha384
 sha512
 sum
 sysvsum

Of course you have sha1sum(1) and md5sum(1) in linux.

You have cksum too but it does not seem to have these algorithms built into it.

Normally, the interested has to approach them, help them bring out the
tender favoring Free Software Solutions, get it released & guarantee
them support professionally.

If this is done, there are chances that this will happen.

Which RSA algorithm?

RSA encryption does not require a message digest algorithm.

The RSA signature algorithm usually uses message digest algorithms for
efficiency and for a few other reasons.

However, the RSA encryption and decryption algorithms are inverses of
each other so one could make a signature by applying RSA decryption to
a message text. Only the person having the private key is capable of
doing this!

The recipient would then apply RSA encryption (since the public key is
public!) to read the message and if this works then it verifies the
sender as well!

I think you are confusing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange with RSA.

Hey, I was talking math and you are talking something else.

Absolutely not true!

I am talking RSA. Not Diffie Hellman.

Since we are digressing a lot here I don't want to get into specifics.

Please read "Applied Cryptography" by Bruce Schneier.

Basically RSA relies on the NP complete problem of prime number
factorization and Diffie Hellman relies on discrete log problem.

Sure, DH looks like the exponentiation equation I gave above.

But RSA also employs it .

I will explain in a hazy manner.

The prime number multiplication is performed in exponentiation.

That is it for now. More later. Today is a very busy day for me.

In a language which many of us know, I colloquially call it
"suriyanukke torch"! :-)

But more seriously, I don't think Girish was challenging Dr. Kapil's
math, but only his interpretation of his mail.

Never (at least almost never) _trust_ someone else's mathematics. The
whole point of mathematics is that if it is correct you should  be
able to verify things for yourself. A bit like open source --- if the
program has a flaw you can check it!

In this case, perhaps I interpreted incorrectly what Girish had to
say. My only justification is his obtuse style of writing! :-)

Though this is a little OT now, I am explaining this since Girish has
no time!

Here is a brief description of RSA which ignores some technical
points:

 Take a number N which is a product of two (large primes) p and q.
 Take a smallish prime r like 23 or 31 which does not divide (p-1) or
 (q-1). Using p, q, r you can calculate s so that (p-1)(q-1)
 divides (rs-1).

 Your public key is (N,r). Your private key is (N,s).
 It is assumed that the p and q are not known to anyone except the
 person who holds the private key.

 Encryption takes m | 0 < m < N and takes it to (m^r modulo N).

 Decryption takes n | 0 < n < N and takes it to (n^s modulo N).

 One can show that (m^(rs)-m) is divisible by N providing that m is
 different from p and q. 

I hope this explains my remark that encryption and decryption are
inverses of each other.

Here is a brief description of Diffie-Hellman key exchange which also
ignores some technical points:

 Let P be a large prime and g | 1<g<P be a "suitable" number. 

 I   choose a number a | 1 < a < (P-1) and broadcast k=(g^a modulo P).
 You choose a number b | 1 < b < (P-1) and broadcast l=(g^b modulo P).

 Now, we use the "shared" key m=g^(ab) modulo P which:
  - I   can get by taking m=(l^a modulo P)
  - You can get by taking m=(k^b modulo P)

 It is generally believed that someone who does not know a or b
 cannot calculate m.

I hope this clarifies why I thought that Girish was talking about the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

Regards,

Kapil.

First of all, I should clarify that my aim is not to try to prove
anyone wrong. However, when a statement is made on a public channel
that is used by newbies and this statement may (IMNSHO!) mislead some
of them, I feel that it should be corrected.

The case in point: factorisation is not known to be an NP complete
problem.

However, people who study algorithms do believe that it is
unlikely that there is a P algorithm for factorisation.

A P algorithm for factorisation is one which will factorise a large
number N in log(N)^k steps for some fixed k (independent of N).

I would like to add to what Prof. Kapil has said here. Factorisation is
known to be in both NP and co-NP complexity classes. If it could be proved
that factorisation is either NP-complete or co-NP-complete, then that means
that NP = co-NP. This would be a very surpising result in complexity theory,
and hence it is widely believed that factorisation is neither NP-complete
nor co-NP-complete.

Actually, O((log N) ^ k) is the correct notation.

Yes as long as they are FOSS jobs. They should have JOB tag in the subject.

Subject: Microsoft to Open Source the .NET Micro Framework
To: cloudforum@googlegroups.com


(I'm currently in Tokyo, so I'll leave my insights into this news for
another time)

Today, at the Microsoft Professional Developer
Conference<http://microsoftpdc.com/>(PDC) in Los Angeles, Microsoft
announced the release of version 4.0
of  the.NET Micro Framework, but also that they are open sourcing the
product and making it available under the Apache 2.0 license, which is
already being used by the community within the embedded space.

The .NET Micro Framework <http://www.microsoft.com/netmf/default.mspx>,a
development and execution environment for resource-constrained devices, was
initially developed inside the Microsoft Startup Business Accelerator,
but recently moved to the Developer Division so as to be more closely
aligned with the overall direction of Microsoft development efforts.

hi,

I have finished the translation of ayttm. I would request some one to review 
it. It is about 800 strings, and sure to have errors. - spelling of course, 
and some grammar too. Strings in english are not always grammatical - there 
are shortcuts, but they usually make sense. By review, I mean someone who is 
willing to go through every thing and make suggestions. It is not very helpful 
if some one says 'great job KG' or 'get a life'. Please contact me off list. 
Any suggestions for putting it up for public interactive review will also be

Hi guys,

This is not a regular tip.

But it is very important nevertheless.

For guys acquainted with UNIX/Linux working on Windows can be like
being put in jail.

You have no place to apply your intellect, none of your UNIX commands
work and so on and so forth.

There is a way out.

You can install Cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com

You can select their wide cornucopia of packages and you get every
single UNIX utility you can think of.

Even fork(2) works!

It is amazing.

Whenever I am forced to use Windows I do this.

And it is also a fact that i am yet to a see a single person who is as
fond of UNIX as I.

I see a lot of people in LUG who are in LUG without understanding a
thing about the charity side of open source or
they even openly claim that they can never give away something for free!

I also find that everyone I meet whether they be of academic
background or otherwise have a strong Windows experience.

Their UNIX experience falls short by a big degree.

Somehow for some reason my experience has been totally UNIX focussed.

Anyway I am waiting to meet someone like me some day.

Another option would be Interix which now called Subsystem for
Unix-based Applications (SUA) from Microsoft. It is a 32/64 bit UNIX and
POSIX subsystem for the NT kernel similar to the Win32 subsystem. 

When I worked with it a few years ago it was based on the OpenBSD
userland. Its main advantage was that it was a native subsystem unlike
Cygwin which was POSIX on top of Win32. Its main disadvantage is that
the latest version (6, 6.1) needs Vista/Windows 7 Ultimate or
Enterprise. The older 32 bit version (3.5) which works on XP is a free
download till the end of the year.

Its other important disadvantage of SUA is that you do not have access
to the source. So if it has a bug you can't easily find a fix for it!

Secondly, you probably cannot distribute GPL binaries linked against
it since that would most likely violate MS licenses.

Cygwin or other such systems have a distinct advantage there.

Kapil.

Works fine on Firefox and Epiphany/Webkit. It probably just didn't load

I know how it feels. Forced to use Windows for a couple of days to

And there's a Cygwin mirror at IIT-M. I downloaded all packages from
that for working on a friend's system.

Dear all,

I got to know that from a LUG friend that he did not like this page.

But he likes it now. :)

I have dressed it up substantially and also fixed the images.

Please try it out. Only then you will know its value.

Colinux or User mode linux is an alternative.

Please do not assume and blow one's own trumpet. Does not win you 
friends and all your good work gets eclipsed by such statements. I can 
certainly tell you you are wrong here.

This is due to a horde of reasons, not of their making. You've been 
forced to use Windows by your own admission.

It is high time you learned others suffer such statements of yours in

Dear all,

I am attempting a shameless conversion attempt here.

Kindly bear with me.

You are supposed to use this USB image

http://liveusb-openbsd.sf.net

along with this article.

http://linuxjournal.com/article/9787

Interestingly one has Rajni and the other Gauthami. ;)

mplayer requires configuration to do whatever I have talked about in
this article.

My USB stick image has everything configured already.

So kindly download the image, burn it, boot it and play a video.

You can enjoy the rich OSD stuff done by mplayer. It is really amazing.

Could you please share more details, on any special hardware used and the

you wont feel sad when you use windows.

Seems there are lot of ways to use linux in Windows, and here is another 
way,

QemuManager + LinuxFromScratch(with OpenSSH) + Putty.

We can download QemuManager from here, No need to install in WindowsXP. 
Just unzip and run it.

http://www.davereyn.co.uk/qem/qman60.zip

LinuxFromScratch LiveCD is available in the following link, its 222MB 
iso with full GNU Development Environment(with Documentation). No X.

ftp://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/lfs-livecd/lfslivecd-x86_64-6.3-r2145-min.iso

Finally here is the link to download putty,

http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe

QemuManager is a novice frontend for 'qemu' and most of the 'qemu' 
options are available graphically. Just map the lfslivecd image to CDROM 
drive and select booting from CDROM. you are good to go into a 
virtualized Linux with all the tools to compile other source tarballs.

To access lfslivecd through putty, we need to open an unprivileged host 
port(35000) in windows and map that port to lfslivecd's ssh port(22) 
using redir facility in QemuManager.

Also it has a lot of 'man pages' and 'info' files which will help a 
person to get femiliar with the true linux(or maybe unix, I don't know 
whether girish will accept this statement or not, but I hope he will try 
atleast one time to see what I'm saying).

Cheers,
Mohan R.

$ convert foo.jpg -resize 80% resized.jpg

will get you a smaller image.

You could also do this.

$ convert photograph.png -resize 1024x768 o.jpg

Yes, convert is very smart.

But what to do when you do not wish to preserve the aspect ratio of the image?

The image will get distorted but sometimes I want that.

I know it is bad but I want it!

I was looking around for  a very long time and then Bingo!

$ convert image.jpg -resize \!123x80 distorted.jpg

If you prefix with an exclamation mark convert will give you what you ask.

I get reminded of Oscar Wilde.

I had sent a tip on this.

The short answer is this:

$ mplayer -cache 8192 http://mp3.streampower.be/radio1-mid.mp3

You can also create a hackish radio station with mplayer and nc. It is here:

Its really a commendable work. Is fedora-11 used as LTSP server?

Yes, Fedora-11 was used as LTSP Server.

Initially it was planned to setup with a single Quad-Core based XEON Server with 4 GB for 60 machines.  but later
I had suggested that, 2 Core-2 Duo PCs can be used for connecting 30 machines each.  

Now, 2 servers (Core-2 Duo, 2 GB RAM, 160 GB SATA HDD) was setup using two DHCP servers without
using range options (Thanks to Mr. Raman for the DHCP suggestions and all 60 thinclients, were now
based on reservation in DHCP).

The entire Fedora-11 for i386 Everything Repository with rpmfusion was setup on both the server for their future applications needs (Nearly 14,000+ rpm packages) and also YUMEX was configured to install the applications
graphically and the technical staffs are trained to manage the entire Thinclient setup.

Applicatins used: Codeblocks with GCC, Firefox, OpenOffice.org.

Now, the management wants to have a similar setup in their boys and girls hostel for totally 60 machines.

VM will have a feature of attaching to a host adaptor either via NAT or 
direct attach. Wireless will be just like any ethernet adaptor.

Th VM networking is bound to the onboard NIC.  You will need 
bridge-utils (bridge interfaces) and additionally the tunctl (tap 
interface) package to bind your VM's network adapter to the physical 
device on the host machine.

As for activating the WiFi on your mobo, I hope you did your research 
and bought something that is natively supported by Linux.  Try the 
lastest distro versions that have come out in the last 6 weeks or so.

I have not tried binding br0 to wlan0 but you could give it a shot on 
your system and let us know if it works.

Don't know about VmWare, but there is a way in 'qemu' to passthrough USB 
devices to guest using '-usb host:<bus>.<addr>', It works only in linux 
host. AFAIK, no way for PCI devices(most of the integrated wireless 
cards are PCI devices).

No of Ubuntu dual boot installation guides are available on the Net.
Go thru it and understand. On the dedicated drive, with-out any fear,
you can play with Ubuntu installation.

Message-ID: <92f9a9560911180500s386536c5k2106477a8a75d455@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I want to back up my gmail account mails to my local
debian box.  Preferably something that can also save
gmail labels.  I can setup squirrel mail to read-only
access the locally available email.

I have several thousand emails, and want something I
can run periodically to do incremental syncs in a time
and bandwidth efficient manner.

I tried using Thunderbird IMAP to create an offline copy,
but TB chokes miserably on large mailboxes.  It also
repeatedly starts re-syncing the entire mailbox.


Google turns up several apps, and I'm confused on which
one to try.

Any advice on working solutions is much appreciated!

I use "offlineimap" for accessing my gmail account and other IMAP
accounts. It is quite easy to setup.

However, there are some problems that should be mentioned.

The imap.gmail.com server converts each label into a new imap folder.
Thus, each such folder is downloaded by offlineimap causing a mail
with multiple labels to be downloaded many times. I don't know of any
software that can work around this.

If you want to automate the process then the configuration file for
offlineimap must contain your gmail password which is not terribly
secure. It would be nice if there was an interface that could use a
keyring or gpg-agent or some other dynamic password store.

The local store is maildir but I think this is a feature and not a
problem!

The nice thing is that the program is written in python so it may be
possible to fix these things with some scripting!

Regards,

Kapil.

Once I used offlineimap coupled with dovecot to read mails faster.

I followed this set up.

Just insert the Ubuntu installation cd when you are in Windows. A wubi installer pops up. It is quite intuitive to install Ubuntu through it. Make sure you have a free drive partition(a minimum of 30GB is more than enough).

Hi,

The following link contains some interesting materials. (Used by Stanford
Professors)

http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/105/

Examples are in C. But it should be trivial to port them to C++.

It seems Fedora 12 lets users install packages without root privileges.

Is Linux becoming least concerned about security?

Note that it only allows you to installed signed packages from the
official Fedora repository.  However this is likely going to be reverted
in an update.  For those wanting to revert now, refer to

Definitely not! I do not know with what intentions Common man asked the
translation, but my reply was in a neutral context, and only with concern
for the exact translation to tamil, just as I had previously given tamil
translations for english words that KG requested. Definitely, "ordinary
man"(?????? ??????) is not anywhere close to the meaning for "Abusive
Idiot".

> **** want some more

Add Work from home.

> *** (HELP HELP ) suggest some more type -- volunteer, trainer,

Give option to give the details of the place too.



> (HELP HELP) Anything else you want on such foss job board ? mail me

Give RSS facility.
Give updates via twitter, identica,
Give email subscription facility.

Give search options.

For example, I have to search like this,
Linux jobs in chennai
php jobs in delhi

Give links to other job sites and mailing lists.

Wishes.

There! Is that okay? I have changed the subject. I was merely pulled into an
apparent series of arguments due to my interest in translation from English
to Tamil.

Respected vinod,

I have changed the subject to OT. you have arguments with people whom u like
to have. if its not related to ILUGC, please have private conversation. Even
for talking about Tamil Translation, i think ILUGC is not right place. You
can have a separate mailing list to discuss about it. but its a big thing
and might get lost in ILUGC.

For Everyone in the list, i request you all to follow

1. Mailing List Etiquette

Balachandar,
For your kind information, it is not I who is arguing with anyone about
anything. I merely did an English-to-Tamil translation and then informed
Kenneth about a factual error he made. After that, till this mail, I am
fending off attacks from you and Raman for doing the above-said. If ILUGC is
not the right place for tamil translation, then you should have raised an
objection when a thread named "TAMTRANS" was started. I have been offering
translations since then. Even if you want to flay someone for this
particular tamil translation, "Common man" is your man! Address him, as he
was the one who asked for the translation in the first place!

Vinod.

these arguments are not palatable on a public mailing list. Let peace

This is a pretty forward looking feature for desktop users, as long as
the packages are clean. And they normally are clean enough if they're
signed packages in my experience and opinion. Now I can tell my
friends that they can install the packages they need for any purpose.
They are prone to being too lazy to enter the root password to install
package(s), like most normal desktop users. And PackageKit rocks along
with in-built presto.

Of course, for public computers and servers, this needs to be modified
using that fix.

Don't ask these kind of lazy friends to get into Unix for the namesake 
of ease of use. Unix is different, please let it be what it is.

I was a Ubuntu user and recently switched to Debian, the main reason is 
because of Ubuntu's release cycle and its care towards the packages. I 
was hit by an acpi bug in the kernels ubuntu shipped for the last two 
releases(from 8.04 to 9.04). It paused the boot process whenever the 
laptop runs in battery. I followed that bug for 1 year and there is no 
cure for it, even from the kernel developers itself.

Finally I put myself into Debian. Stable packages and Robust Bug 
Tracking System which works straight from the command line(reportbug and 
querybts) teaching me what 'Debian Way' is all about.

It may be a good idea to compromise unix's philosophy for windows crowd 
or creating OS for human beings, but deriving bad policies, putting 
packages without proper testing will produce more haters(like me) 
towards that distro.

This is not the first time fedora is in controversy regarding security. 
Recently fedora's repositories were compromised because of bad 
signatures in its packages, check the below link.

http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/08/22/1341247

Finally, my kind request to all, stop converting those windows users to 
unix. it will make good distro like fedora to think about them rather 
than concentrating on FOSS Development. people who are really 
interesting in unix will definitely come to unix.

Cheers,
Mohan R

Sorry but there were no "bad signatures" anywhere.   The detailed

"
The compromise was not the result of a software vulnerability, and as we 
have previously stated, our investigation has revealed no such 
vulnerabilities.  Instead,

***the intruder took a copy of a SSH private key which was not secured 
with a passphrase from a system outside the Fedora infrastructure. The 
intruder then used that key, which belonged to a Fedora administrator, 
to access Fedora systems***

In addition, based on system log sudo entries, we believe the intruder 
also compromised that user's password.

The Fedora package signing key was present on a system to which the
intruder had access during the time of the event, but the results of
our investigation did not lead us to believe the intruder accessed the
key.

***The intruder used the account's privileges to build modified versions
of openssh and rpm.  These packages would have allowed the intruder to
capture the passphrases of unwitting users on our build system, or the
passphrase used to secure the package signing key.  With the signing
key's passphrase and access to that key, the intruder would have been
able to fraudulently sign packages.***
"

Rahul,

Even the Fedora administrator's SSH key can be 
compromised/stolen/whatever, how can you guys put weight on 
package-signatures and dropped privileges to install apps?

As jeff replied in the mail-thread, its a shame to your team. You guys 
know well about the incident and still did this?. As mentioned in 
slashdot, fedora team want (windows) dev crowd to use fedora. I'm sure 
most of them are already using it. But compromising a known security 
feature for them is meaningless.

In thief-cop game, cop will never win, but better cop will not give easy 
way to thief to intrude/escape.

I'm stopping here, I can't speak much about fedora's internals/policies 
because I'm yet to get oppertunity to work on it. Please take this as my 
request, dont make fedora as another windowsxp, let fedora as fedora, 
let linux as linux.

Thanks,
Mohan R.

SSH Key != GPG key. Packages are signed with GPG key. Anyway it wasn't
my decision and lot of us including me don't agree this is the right
process to follow. So let's not pain broad brushes. Alright?

I'm sure it will be alright. Also I know SSH Key != GPG, I asked that 
fedora already came across an event that modified its package's GPG key 
through an admin's SSH key, then how the team decided to go for this

Err, "the team" didn't.  PackageKit isn't Fedora specific.  You seem to
be assuming that there is a monolithic entity working on changes. That
is far from the case. There are thousands of developers working on
various things.  Today, the Fedora Engineering team will meet on IRC and
make a decision on the right path forward.  That would be a team decision.

I forgot to mention a few things in my previous mail but you are making
a incorrect claim. In particular,

"The Fedora package signing key was present on a system to which the
intruder had access during the time of the event, but the results of
our investigation did not lead us to believe the intruder accessed the
key."

No intruder ever modified any package's GPG key.  Also note that
PackageKit change was made upstream and inherited in Fedora 12. It was
not a Fedora specific change. It was not noticed when it was inherited
because Rawhide (Fedora's development branch) packages are never signed
and PackageKit in that case would always prompt for the password.

In Fedora 11, PackageKit allowed any user to retain the authorization
for installing packages when the user enters the admin password for the
first time. So this is not a fundamentally new change neverthless.

Hope that helps understand the situation better.

If you're using bash, hit ctrl+r and start typing the first few chars, 
hit enter once to copy the command, again to execute.

I thought of writing the same thing and then realised --- perhaps
these lazy people will become less lazy once they enter the dynamic
world of *nix. Some lazy people start taking evening walks once they
live in front of a park!

If your remember events from a few years ago, there was a major
problem in the international SSH usage system because of Debian. So
we cannot claim to be totally pure either!

Not only is there "more than one way to do it" but we can learn a lot
by seeing how the other team does it. If we flame other distros to a
crisp we will not have the opportunity to learn from their mistakes
instead of ours!  :-)

Also look at what 'Esc+Tab' does for you. Sometimes that is what is
wanted --- to re-use an earlier command with different options.

For vi/vim users, set -o vi (.bashrc) sets bash CLI in vi mode (default 
is emacs) and then you can use the vi command mode search features 
(after pressing the ESC key).

Also "history | grep <your string>" will pull out all the instances of 
the command used.

Yes but the problems were entirely different. Fedora's problem was a
leak in SSH access to one of the admin systems and not "bad signatures"
or "change in GPG key".  Either way, the PackageKit change has been
reverted now.

It seems to me that you are talking about Command line completion. This is a
common feature of command line interpreters(a program running in the
background of command line consoles). And usually(so often so that the
feature is also called tab completion), the tab key is the key used to
trigger this program. All you do is type a few characters of the command and
press tab. If the few characters that you typed are a prefix of two or more
commands, then all such commands are listed, and then you would have to type
a few extra characters more to zero in on the character you want and again
press tab to automatically fill it up. Otherwise, just one press of tab will
fill it up for you.

This feature is useful, not just for filling up known commands, but also for
finding out if some command exists or not. Simply pressing tab will list out
all the available commands. More information is available in the following
wikipedia page.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_completion

Hope this helps.

Vinod.

You are not alone. I never knew of 'bc' until a few days back. Imagine
wasting all my time opening up CSVs in openoffice and manually doing
the calculations :(

I found cat, cut, bc and in bliss since then. Need to learn more. So
many bash tricks that makes your life so much efficient.

Ofcourse I knew cat and cut! But the combo rocked! I highly recommend
to people who do a lot of statistical calculations with CSVs. If you
folks have any other tool you recommend , highly appreciated. Ofcourse
in a separate thread. KG will kill me for hijacking his thread. :-)

If you have a browser open all the time like I do, you can do quite a 
few conversions and calculations in google (ctrl+k on firefox, typing 
calculation and hitting enter is a bit easier than opening terminal and 
bc in this case). But if you insist on terminal, there's something I 
learnt just today that's easier than bc - simply typing echo 
$((123*123)) is faster :)

I was wondering whether there could be an article section for example
what a small/medium/large (based on no of seats) business should have
as part of IT infrastructure (eg Alfresco instead of say file
server/local or hosted e-mail and the such).

I don't remember very well, but mysql should have its own log file.
Try to see if there are any error codes in that file. look that up in
the mysql site. guess that would help faster.

I remember seeing this problem when i was using mysql. all i did was
paste the error as it is in the search bar. apparently, google still
has some links on this. sure you tried most of them?

What client do you use? Maybe this link could help:

http://filesharefreak.com/2008/04/16/how-to-download-torrents-through-a-proxyfirewall/

If the proxy server is blocking BitTorrent (most do) you can use the
metalinks to download by using multiple links. I'm using wxDownload
Fast on Fedora 11 to get Fedora 12. It creates connections to multiple
servers and evens out the load.

What was the output here? You can use:

Post your /var/log/mysqld.log, to say pastie.org, and provide us the URL.

So, mysqld is not running on your system. Can you also post output of

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0911200910y52f6dcf4lc9c33ceae7fa27fa@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

If someone is interested in learning OpenGL / Qt, please let me know.

KStars, the application I maintain, requires a lot of love in this
aspect. Although it has a lot of features, it lacks eye-candy - mostly
because we don't use OpenGL.

If someone is interested in learning these by way of contributing to
KStars, please send me mail, and I should be able to help during
December.

This is (hopefully) a win-win situation. KDE benefits by getting a
nice new GUI and you benefit by learning OpenGL/Qt and real world
coding.

Pre-requisites:
1. C++
2. An open mind
3. A steep learning curve

btw, about command completion, judging by this thread I think many might not 
know about the existence of the package 'bash-completion' on most common 
distros. Do a [yum|apt-get] install bash-completion and enjoy bash commandline 
completion on steroids !(*)

I think what you meant is:

 only pdf,djvu,dvi and other graphic files listed with a 'evince<tab><tab>'

'evince' is a pretty capable viewer!

Message-ID: <a55cfe9d0911220507o3db21842la14f9c74cb94d9f8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Artha42 Technology Solutions (http://www.artha42.com) is looking for
passionate hackers. We are a technology startup in the software
services space. We ourselves are a small team of spirited and
passionate technophiles. We are currently looking for young and
passionate hackers who can make the journey with us. We are interested
in hackers in the early stages of their careers (0 to 2 years of
experience).

You see, we at Artha42 believe that software development is a craft
rather than an engineering discipline. We work on interesting projects
both in the enterprise as well as in the commercial space. We are
fiercly passionate about open source software. We believe that
software is not about requirements documents and code but much more
than that. It is an intrinsic and intricate process of modelling the
solution in the mind. The documents and code are just artefacts in the
real world that represent the model in the mind.

We are a bit biased towards ruby (not rails) currently. We find it a
good fit for most of the work that we do. That said we cannot ignore
the world's most popular language[1].

We are journeymen looking for fellow travellers. If you would like to
join us in this journey, please drop in a line to vagmi <at> artha42
dot com. Send us your profile and we will definitely get in touch with
you.

Regards,
Vagmi

If they are pvt self financing colleges, it is not surprising because many
have not even heard of the concept called 'student rights'!!

yes, but then one should only put their money where their mouth is. IBM
should not support open source if they cant simply stick to it in a simple
student's competition. And what more can we expect from colleges authorities
if big organizations like IBM are slapping open source right there in front
of everyone, no doubt colleges are also part of it anyways, and this is no
blame game.

Message-ID: <460541.40189.qm@web53611.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi Lugies,

I tried Winamp download but ironically it is not available for linux platform.

Why such a most popular software is not available for equivalently most popular linux platform ?.

Basically, is Winamp an Open-source project or closed-source ?

If it is open-source possibly we can try to atleast port it to linux.

If anyone have come across on this pls give me directions.

Thanks,
Selvakumar

You should ask the Winamp developers.

Proprietary.

There are plenty of audio/video players available for *nix. Please use
them. For a start (not the only source of information):

Why ironically? It's called Winamp. Hazard a guess as to which platform
it runs on. As for whether it's open-source, Wikipedia is your friend.

If you want to use a similar application use Audacious, Beep Media
Player, or xmms.

hi Selvakumar,

Which flavour of linux are you using?
Try Audacious if you're in any new platforms, still you may have to
circumvent the mp3 codec license issue...!
Its the old XMMS in new bottle..
BTW, if you're serious about Os try converting you existing collection to
OGG vorbis and distribute only OGG..as its royality free...

I recommend Audacious. I have been using it for the past couple of
months and it is awesome. I was using banshee and rhythmbox earlier
and they were too bloated for my tastes. I tried Amarok for the
briefest time and left it.

Hi all,
I have a 250 GB USB external HDD with FAT32 partition. I wanted to
copy the isos of GNU/Linux distros onto it, but when the size of the
file is > 4GB, I get an error message saying "file size too large".
When I googled regarding this, I got a lot of links pointing me to
'ulimit' command but I don't see any issue with that. Here is what I
get when I do a ulimit -a:

Subject: [Ilugc] Question about shutting down Guest KVMs during HOST OS
	shutdown
Message-ID: <625464.93017.qm@web50607.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Greetings,

I have been working on a script (kvminit) that starts and shuts down
Guest KVMs during HOST OS boot/shutdown.   The setup is in a small
network wherein HOST OS is openSUSE 11.1 and Guest KVMs is a bunch of
openSUSE and CentOS servers installation doing dedicated tasks (e.g.
openLDAP + Samba PDC/BDC, DNS, eGroupWare).

During HOST OS shutdown, the kvminit shuts down each Guest KVM using
the following mechanism:

 ssh root@<kvm_guest> "/sbin/poweroff"  (using ssh key-pair login mechanism)

Primary reason for choosing the above was to ensure that the file
systems on each Guest KVM  is closed properly i.e. avoid FS
corruption.

This method also assumes that key-pair prep between HOST OS "user" and
the "root" user on each Guest OS has been done a priori.
Additionally, the script waits 30-50 secs per KVM (depending on the
services) until each Guest OS halts itself.

Then I came across a script (link below) which shuts down Guest KVM a
bit differently:

<http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Simple_shell_script_to_manage_your_virtual_machine_with_bridged_networking>

relevant excerpt:

send_cmd() {
       QEMU_MONITOR_COMMAND=$1
       echo "${QEMU_MONITOR_COMMAND}" | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:${FILE_MONITOR}
}

which sends the "exit" command to the qemu process via a socket file.

I have experimented with the above technique and noticed that it is
the equivalent of doing a "hard" power off on the guest KVM.  In other
words the qemu process exits immediately without giving the Guest OS
any chance shutdown it's services and to umount the file systems.  I
have read the qemu-kvm man page and did not come across any

Is there any other way to ensure that guest KVM shuts down cleanly?

TIA,

I had participated in TGMC last time and came among the top 20 over
India. IBM forces the software RSA(Rational Software Architect) upon
us, which
  1. Does not install in GNU/Linux even though claim so
  2. Is bug ridden, very unstable. I would have finished my project in
half the time in opensource IDE's like Netbeans and Eclipse which have
a lot of community support.
3. TGMC also has very poor appreciation for usage of open source
technology.We used technology like Struts and Hibernate which were not
even considered.

Those who have worked on J2EE can have a look at the source code of
the prize winning entries. They are quite pathetic.
https://tgmc.in/archives.php?d=full&q=2008

For all professors who are getting students to work on TGMC is a bad
idea. I would suggest more on the likes of Code for Freedom
(codeforfreedom.in ) organized by Sun Microsystems which support open
source principles.

Yes, the error says it all. If i am not mistaken, FAT32 is not capable of 
holding files larger than 4G ! (guess what 2^32 is ?).

As others have noted that's the way that companies work and your college is more 
at fault than IBM.

If you are disgusted by your college's attitude imagine how you would feel once 
you get a job in the 'real world' where your company might ask you to sign a 
contract that declares that *any* code you write belongs to the company 
(irrespective of whether you used company resources or wrote the code during 
your free time at home !!) ! Yes, there are companies like that. In fact, if I 
am not mistaken most Indian software firm's contracts have this in their boiler 
plate employee agreements.

It is true that IBM is behaving unethically. So, what are your options ?

Well, you could complain and fight it out with your collage authorities, create 
a ruckus and refuse to accept such a blatant attack on your rights and you just 
/might/ get justice and your collage /might/ just pull out from the program but 
be ready to sacrifice your education and possibly your career along with it.

OTOH, you might choose to just go with the flow and accept the crap that they 
are shoving down your throat in the name of education and also forgo your rights 
to the code you churn in the process.

This might seem depressing and hopeless but it would be better for you in the 
long run.

If however, you /do/ want to make a difference without sacrificing your career, 
you can do something else:
a. Get on with the program. Write your project using the IBM tools in the manner 
that is expected with just enough dedication to ensure good marks but not enough 
to make it worth the while for IBM to use your project in any real world scenario.

b. Encourage everybody in your collage to do (a) and educate as many students as 
you can about the issues that you brought up so that they understand the 
'motives' of this so called 'contests'.

c. Horne your skills in the FOSS ecosystem on the side by contributing to 'real 
world' FOSS projects.

This is just a smarter more passive way of civil disobedience. By doing this you 
would be rebelling against the 'purpose' rather than the 'process'. IBM as a 
commercial entity and will keep up the charade of 'coding competitions' as long 
as they see commercial benefit in it. If they realize their investment is not 
generating the perceived results, they themselves will back out.

Unfortunately tho' all of that is easier said than done. So, coming back to what 
your choices are in such a case -- practically none

...but don't lose hope. Stick to your personal goals & seek out to use FOSS to 
improve your knowledge as much as possible. It will eventually pay off in the 
long run.

cheers,
- steve

Do you know what you should do now?

Head to:

http://liveusb-openbsd.sf.net

and download an image and unpack with 7zip.

Following that run this:

# qemu -hda usb-2g.bin

It will stop at a point and you have to follow the instructions in my
site to see the full emulation environment.

You can try the same trick with any ISO image.

# qemu -cdrom openbsd46.iso

You can have an OS installed in a 2GB filestore like this.

# qemu-img create os.bin 2G

# qemu -hda os.bin -cdrom openbsd46.iso -boot d

qemu is amazingly powerful.

And I got this working very well on our good old Winblows as well. ;)

$ script /tmp/output.txt

will start  a new shell and redirect all the input and output commands
to the file /tmp/output.txt

You need not give a filename as argument.

This is a simple but very powerful command and can be used for a
variety of debugging tasks.

If you wish to have a key recorder program, you are looking for
ttyrec(1) and ttyplay(1).

Message-ID: <7938ae610911222116v21eab527td6cc7ed1596b9fda@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Kindly look at the filealter.c file here.

http://gayatri-hitech.com/languageclasses/index.html

It is a small utility using kqueue(). I guess you don't have it in Linux.

You can use this perl module SGI::FAM and this perl code.

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;

use SGI::FAM;

my $conn = new SGI::FAM;
$conn->monitor( "/var/log/messages" );

while (1) {
my $event = $conn->next_event;
print $event->filename, " ", $event->type, "\n";
}


Basically the idea of watching files or directories is very important
for programming.

Yesterday I could not get this working with FAM. I had to instead fall
back on kqueue. There are many alternatives like dnotify on
linux.

Here is the filealter.c file.


#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/event.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int
main(void)
{
   int f, kq, nev;
   struct kevent change;
   struct kevent event;

   kq = kqueue();
   if (kq == -1)
       perror("kqueue");

   f = open("/tmp/foo", O_RDONLY);
   if (f == -1)
       perror("open");

   EV_SET(&change, f, EVFILT_VNODE,
          EV_ADD | EV_ENABLE | EV_ONESHOT,
          NOTE_DELETE | NOTE_EXTEND | NOTE_WRITE | NOTE_ATTRIB,
          0, 0);

   for (;;) {
       nev = kevent(kq, &change, 1, & event, 1, NULL);
       if (nev == -1)
           perror("kevent");
       else if (nev > 0) {
           if (event.fflags & NOTE_DELETE) {
               printf("File deleted\n");
               break;
           }
           if (event.fflags & NOTE_EXTEND ||
               event.fflags & NOTE_WRITE)
               printf("File modified\n");
           if (event.fflags & NOTE_ATTRIB)
               printf("File attributes modified\n");
       }
   }

   close(kq);
   close(f);
   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

kqueue() is an event notification mechanism using which you can watch
for file and directory changes.

It can be used for many other things as well. We first register for an
event using the EV_SET() macro.

Please remember that macros are always written in uppercase. It is
just a convention and not a rule.

kqueue() is a FreeBSD construct. You have it in other BSDs too. On
OpenBSD the preferred thing to do is use libevent.

But I am not quite sure if that can be used for file monitoring.

I have to find out. But this code works on my OpenBSD machine. I did an

$ apt-cache search kqueue
libev-dev - static library, header files, and docs for libev
libev-libevent-dev - libevent event loop compatibility wrapper for libev
libev3 - high-performance event loop library modelled after libevent
libevent1 - An asynchronous event notification library

Interesting. I think you should use libev instead of inotify directly on linux.

Please try it out and let me know.

Thanks.

Really? You want IBM to _stop_ supporting open source just because
some "suit" somewhere in this organisation has a short term viewpoint?

Note that most large companies like IBM and Tata are bureaucracies in
the same way that large governments (like GoI) are.  So it is quite
possible for the left hand to oppose the actions of the right hand.

For one, I _expect_ someone who is called a "teacher" to have a more
independent viewpoint than someone who works for a company.

I understand your annoyance at the fact that some students will get
sucked into creating proprietary code. Moreover, some other students
who are more "into" open source will be left out in the cold. To them
I would say, reserve your energy for programmes like GSoC which do
seem to mostly do the right thing.

Kapil.

Format it with ext3. It supports file sizes upto 16 gigs. If you use the
drive on windows, use NTFS. It should support file sizes greater than 4
gigs. =)

Did you try the obvious method?
 $ script /var/tmp/remote_ssh_session
 $ ssh remote_host
 .... login with some commands to remote session and logout
 $ exit

Don't forget to remove your password/passphrase from the script
file if you are not using out-of-band authentication[1] for ssh.

Regards,

Kapil.

[1] Out-of-band authentication for ssh means that ssh uses a
public-key which is unlocked in a different terminal session from the
one used to make the connection. This is managed with ssh-agent or
gpg-agent etc.

On that point, LtU linked to a paper [1] describing Scratch recently.
It's quite a good read, also mentions how kids learn the value of open
source and collaboration using Scratch.

To the OP, welcome to the real world, get used to it, or subvert it.  :)

Hi,

I need a little push up,

I have shell script which opens up a xlib window, which happens in a loop.
I want each window to fade away after a certain period of time( 1 min for eg
).

My algorithm is as follow,

 for loop
     rsync a file from remote directory X
     Display the file for 1 min in a xlib window( sh displayFile.sh fileName
)
     close the xlib window(i.e kill displayFile.sh )
end loop

Any help could put me in right way.

The desktop notification specification is found at freedesktop.org to
provide a standard way of doing notifications on the desktop. The protocol
uses D-BUS for communication.

Send pop-up notifications on Gnome use notify-send .On Debian-based systems
you may need to install the 'libnotify-bin' package.

$sudo aptitude install libnotify-bin

Options:

-t: expire time in milliseconds.

-u: urgency (low, normal, critical).

-i: icon path.

Example :

$notify-send -t 3000 -u normal  "Hello World"

In Shell Script use some thing like this:

#!/bin/bash
while [ 1 ]; do
notify-send -t 3000 -u normal  "hello"
     sleep 1m
done


You can download the sourse code of notify-send at
http://trac.galago-project.org/browser/trunk/libnotify/tools

Message-ID: <375887.25690.qm@web95718.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hello Ilugc,

I had sent up a mail server with a specific domain name. Let's take a fictitious example say x.com. i own this domain name x.com
The mail server is mail.x.com
Mail server runs on a private IP behind the Gateway.
I use a DDNS service and port forwarding all mail traffic to the mail server running on a private IP address.

Problem:
Mail server works fine. I am able to send and recieve mails through this mail server. everything works fine.
able to subscribe to ilugc from x.com , able to send and receive mails from gmail.

But there are certain domains such as hotmail, yahoo, rocketmail, ymail and also certain companies which reject all the mails sent from the user at x.com.

For example all mails sent from dhuruvan.B@x.com to any hotmail, yahoo, ymail, rcoketmail and certain company mail ids are rejected.

I analyzed the issue and found out mails originating from dynamic ips, IPs not listed and approved by the companies that sell spam protection software such as trend micro are rejected.

Because of this i'am not able to use my domain mail server.

Since some of you might have faced the same issue. please let me know if any solution exists for this issue.

Some more info.
I use BSNL DSL connection and i don't have static IP address. everytime i connect i get a new WAN IP for my gateway device.

Best method is to use acpi to shutdown the guest.  Host sends
an acpi power button pressed event, and guest acpi userland
responds.  This method for non-linux guests as well.

But I'm not sure how to get get it working in qemu-kvm.

Why don't you just get a static IP from BSNL? Inquire with them, they
should be able to give it to you.

Thanks, I am aware of this technique but not with the implementation.

Ditto.  I joined the KVM mailing list but that list has zilch traffic.  
Perhaps the qemu list.

...and they are right in doing so, since it makes sense to not trust mail that 
claims to originate from a domain whose MX record does not exist or whose 
originating IP does not resolve to the claimed domain.

Now, there are few ways to avoid being treated as spam. For example:

a. Get a static IP for your net connection and set up a dns to point to this IP 
as being authoritative for your domain (including the MX record).

b. Get a external hosted domain to be the mail server for your domain.

c. Configure an external server (possibly your ISP, ie: BSNL, itself) as a 
smarthost (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_host)

d. Use a dynamic dns service for your DSL connection that lets you set up an MX 
record too (eg: http://www.dyndns.com/services/dns/dyndns/howto.html)

HTH,

Subject: [Ilugc] .a-tip-a-day. (mencoder + dvdauthor - create a DVD player
	playable video)
Message-ID: <7938ae610911241646g72cc37bas263c7a02a763b0da@mail.gmail.com>

I am going to talk about DVD player playable DVD videos.

Not about DVD menus that reference byte offsets on the video and
creating still images with background music that you
would have seen in movie DVDs.

I have attempted this long ago but gave it up. It worked partly but I
was more interested in creating a video stream that directly
plays the video on the DVD player connected to television.

Here goes.

$ mencoder -oac lavc -ovc lavc -of mpeg -mpegopts format=dvd:tsaf \
  -vf scale=720:576,harddup -srate 48000 -af lavcresample=48000 \
  -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg2video:vrc_buf_size=1835:vrc_maxrate=9800:vbitrate=5000:\
keyint=15:vstrict=0:acodec=ac3:abitrate=192:aspect=16/9 -ofps 25 \
  -o movie.mpg movie.avi

This command takes a movie.avi or even an mpg file or any mplayer
recognizable video file and creates an MPEG2 video output
 movie.mpg.

Now you create a DVD directory structure with this command.

$ cat dvd.xml
<dvdauthor dest="dvd">
<vmgm/>
<titleset>
     <titles>
         <pgc>
                <vob file="video1.mpg"
chapters="0,0:30,1:00,1:30,2:30,3:00,3:30,4:00" />
                <vob file="video2.mpg"
chapters="0,0:30,1:00,1:30,2:30,3:00,3:30,4:00" />
         </pgc>
    </titles>
</titleset>
</dvdauthor>


Hey, this is not python. The indentation is only for better understanding.

Now you have to run this command:

$ dvdauthor -o dvd -x dvd.xml

It will chug away and create a DVD structure with AUDIO_TS and
VIDEO_TS directories under dvd/ directory.

Now test it with xine or mplayer.

$ mplayer -dvd-device dvd/ dvd://1

Please try it. Only then you will benefit by this tip.

Hi,

You can also try http://www.no-ip.com. I've never tried it. And I don't know
how reliable it is. If your mail server is put to some very important or
critical use, I'd go by the others' words, get a static IP.

And I think a lot of BSNL's IPs are blacklisted by DNS servers and
Firewalls. Also be concerned of whom you get the static IP from.

Thanks.

Yogesh.

Thanks for giving this info.But i basically wanted a process to stop its
execution after 'n' seconds.

I achieved it by putting that process in bg and then kill it after 'n'
seconds.

   sh display.sh &
   sleep 60s

   (then kill the display.sh process)

I dont know how that could be achieved using notify-send, still it is
interesting command to learn.

There is an ext3 rexplorer for windows too.

Another option would be to cut the file into several parts and store

Hi,


Do you use a proxy in your network?

you have to setup a environment variable "http_proxy"

set like this.

export http_proxy=http://server-ip:port/

This script uses Qemu's monitor interface. The monitor interface has a
system_powerdown command that can be used trigger an event to cleanly shutdown
the system. Unfortunately this does not seem to work (Please check if this works
for you). One work-around is to configure the guest's init to halt the system
when it receives an ctrl-alt-delete as shown below

File:/etc/inittab
- ca:12345:ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t1 -a -r now
+ ca:12345:ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t1 -a -h now

And then use the following monitor command, to generate a ctrl-alt-delete
sequence, when the system has to be halted.

sendkey ctrl-alt-delete

Vijay

         For this you need a working internet connection and i guess you are not 
using a proxy server.May be a temporary network problem.Try to retry again .

Ok,
I think, i have not made it clear in my question ,sorry for that,

  1) The xlib window which i mentioned was created with a seismic unix(SU)
command( suxwigb ).

   For eg: suxwigb < data.su

  2) I call it inside a shell script( parent shell script ) .So the created
window is the child of the
 parent shell script(  i guess ).

  3) I wanted to stop the parent shell script( including child process which
holds the window ) after 'n' second of execution and the loop will continue
to display the next file.

Hope i explained my problem clear this time.
( initially ,i missed the little trick of putting process in bg  )

The GPG fingerprint is not for the name but for the public key.

Read the online documentation about GNUPG for more information.
 http://www.gnupg.org/
(There is a mini-Howto under documentation/HOWTOs).

Keep your private key safe!

Kapil.

Has nothing to do with your name. The fingerprint identifies your GPG
key. Read the manual <http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#AEN26> or
the nice and descriptive Fedora Wiki
<http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DocsProject/UsingGpg/CreatingKeys>.

suxwigb cannot be replaced by notify-send or xmessage. So check for
time-out option in that command or continue with your current
technique.

OpenSolaris is not named 10, 11 etc. I have a 2009.06 livecd. You
could install from that.

I do not have the SCXE DVDs in case you wanted that.

Friends.

Got a doubt :-)

I use Virtual Box to host some guest OS.

These guest OS get virtual IP from DHCP.

Thats fine.

How it gets the MAC address for the virtual network card?

MAC address is unique. How it determines that the MAC address is not there
in the network already?



Thanks.

For the most part, MAC address are randomly assigned by the
hypervisor.  The exact details of now MAC addresses are auto
generated is implementation specific.

Some hypervisors use "locally administered address" by starting the
MAC address with 02:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, and generate the rest randomly.

Others have registered an OEM identifier officially, eg. vmware uses
00:0C:29, Hyper-V uses 00:15:5d for the OUI.  The NIC part of the
MAC address is generated randomly.

Please look through wikipedia to understand the terminology:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address


> MAC address is unique. How it determines that the MAC address is not there
> in the network already?

There is no fail safe method of creating unique MAC addresses.   All
mechanisms only server to reduce the likely hood of duplicate MAC
addresses.

That said, the administrator can manually assign any MAC address
he/she wishes on to virtual NICs.


Auto generated MAC address on virtual NICs is a little tricky because
when you clone VMs, new MAC addresses are automatically generated.
If your guest OS names/identifies network interfaces using MAC addresses,
then all your existing interfaces will not be recognized and the guest OS
will treat it as a new interface.  Common problem is that after VM cloning,
eth0 will become eth1.

and so on. Try any combo.

To create video from audio you need to give two parameters like this. ;)

$ ffmpeg -i foo.wav -i foo.mjpeg foo.avi

Message-ID: <7938ae610911251839s36bc988bh5465cac637931a0c@mail.gmail.com>

A long time ago, very long time ago, I learn about LaTeX from LUG.

I am immensely grateful to you guys for that. Perhaps many of you from
that time do not
 participate in LUG anymore.

I am damn sure that my answer lies in LaTeX only.

Here is the problem.

I wish to write this address:

Monica Bedi,
c/o Abu Salem,
Portugal.
         600 04.

Now I want this written with beautiful big truetype fonts with anti
aliasing and vector graphics.

How do to do it?

I want a ready solution. Please don't say "read this link" . :)

I don't have time.

Thanks.

Much appreciated.

Here is some more fodder for thought. I want a bitmapped version of this
figlet output.

http://gayatri-hitech.com/Misc/ad.txt

I can theoretically bucket fill it with some drawing tool but that
would not work.

ASCII output has lot of spaces between glyphs and the ink would spill.

Ouch!

Help?

Thanks in advance.

Dear Sir/Madam

C-DAC, Mumbai* *has released *Anumaan* (alpha-0.1 version) as a part of its
activities and commitment in the area of accessibility. Accessibility
activities at C-DAC, Mumbai are coordinated by Open Source Software Division
(OSSD) at its Kharghar, Navi Mumbai Centre.

Anumaan is a perspective-based, on-screen predictive text entry system for
GNOME desktop. Basically, it is an extension of an Input Method (IM)
mechanism (on GNOME desktop) in the sense that it extends its (IM) notion by
including the power of text prediction. It has support for UTF-8 unicode
encoding. The system allows users to train it and personalize and as per
their writing style into different named domains. Hence, it adapts to user?s
writing style in some sense. Although, the current version does not support
live mode adaptation, still a user can train a domain as many times he
likes.

Anumaan is designed for a (text) sequence prediction based on a certain
Context.The context can either be a partial word context or a partial
sentence context. Therefore, it is intended to help people suffering from
different kinds of motor disability by allowing it to be customized for
different kinds of Input devices (e.g. keyboard, mouse, joystick or any
other pointing device especially built for people suffering from motor
disability). In other words, it can be customized very easily to cater to
different hand movement capabilities. The current version is only for mouse
and keyboard based interactions. But, we can easily customize it for
different hardware input device requirements.
The current released versions have two flavours:
*1. Anumaan-standalone:* The base system which runs on Java Swing Interface.
*2. AnumaanLinux:* The Linux version which uses Anumaan-standalone as base
and is ported to utilize the accessibility features of GNOME GAIL library.
The current interface is accessible to almost all Gtk+ Editable Text
Widgets.
*Anumaan URLs:*

well as connect to an ad-hoc wlan0/eth0 network simultaneously. While
connecting to the ad-hoc network the ppp0 interface also must be active and

This is more generic

mplayer -dumpaudio <Any Video File> -dumpfile MyRippedAudio.mp3

I suppose even -dumpfile to an ogg will work. But I use this because
I rip this only when I want audio for my mobile phone which doesn't
support ogg. (flvs can be ripped too. I use this for getting some rare
concerts from youtube)

If you do not specify a dump file, it will automatically dump as an mp3 file
with no extension

whenever a new connection is established the route will be changed. you can
either choose not to change the route while connecting (i remember there is
a option in wvdial.conf which u can set) or manually add the route after the
connection is established.

> If all the machines in the LAN of which wlan0/eth0 are on the same subnet,
you should've no issue. However, if you are trying to connect to multiple
subnets thro' an internal router networks, then add route entries for each
of  the subnets you want to access thro wlan0/eth0 to gateways on the LAN.
The default route will point to ppp0 and only non LAN traffic will go thro'
ppp0. By default, the route entries to the local LAN subnets do not exist
and so this problem occurs. Once these routes are installed, access to LAN
subnets is not subject to default route whether it is pointing to wlan0/eth0
or ppp0.

MPlayer does not transcode when you do that. Try

    file MyRippedAudio.ogg

and see what you get.

No specific command. You need to write a small script.

Message-ID: <a8e2ecc10911261710j19d158e6k7a41b1908a0c597e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I upgraded my f9 installation to 2.6.31.6 kernel. While creating the initrd
image I got the below warnings. The .config file indicates Y for these
modules. Now I am facing the issues in both the old and new kernels.

WARNING: No module ehci-hcd found for kernel 2.6.31.6, continuing anyway
WARNING: No module ohci-hcd found for kernel 2.6.31.6, continuing anyway
WARNING: No module uhci-hcd found for kernel 2.6.31.6, continuing anyway
WARNING: No module ata_piix found for kernel 2.6.31.6, continuing anyway


Now after reboot, I am unable to access my samba shares both on sda and sdb
drives (just in case it mattered based on the warnings). The SMBCLIENT lists
the shares without errors, and even upon attempt to open these shares I am
prompted for a password, however upon entering the password, the error
indicates that the path refers to a location that does not exist.

Further, I am also unable to access my GUI, the below errors are logged in
messages file:

This must be the most braindead tip/command I have ever sent/will send to LUG.

$ sleep 5

will simply make you wait for 5 seconds. It does not even give you
time to have a coffee.

Then you should probably do

$ sleep 30

Anyway this can be really useful in shell scripts.

And there are many programmers who rely on sleep mostly by mistake to
get this code working.

That is a very bad way of doing things but in certain situations that
is just unavoidable...

Dear all,

Those of  you with the milk of human kindness can reply to me *by

(Others please don't read this mail)

Please don't spam the list. Also excuse me for sending this but I
really have no choice.

My close friend is suffering from an acute health problem for the past
6 months. I was nearly in tears
when I heard his story. He cannot sit or sleep...he has pain all over
his lower body.

Anyway he needs some medicines urgently that are really small that
need to be carried to California from Chennai.

I know that many of you will be flying to US or you know friends in
CTS or elsewhere who will be going to USA from
Chennai. Kindly get in touch with me (girish@gayatri-hitech.com) so
that we can do this very small help.

Thanks.

(BD)- How does this guarantee that it will work. Even these IPs might have been blacklisted by many spam prevention service providers. and You know BSNL guys won't bother a bit if i go and ask them and i suspect whether thier support staff will have the knowledge to understand this problem first of all.
Is there any known case withing Ilugc that some one has used BSNL static IP and have successfully used thier own servers such as mail servers.

Thanks steve. Your detailed mail is helpful.
But i think there is no guarantee that using static IP will resolve the issue. I'll try your other options first.

Dear Members,

Though I am new to ubuntu - from chennai, came to hyderabad on official
tour.

met some people here - and when I talked about BOSS, Ubuntu, some were very
eager to install, in their office desktops.

I felt it would be better for those who are very skilled in helping them, at
hyderabad.

so I request someone to forward this to ILUG hyderabad members - so that
they can help these people.

1. Andhra Pradesh Police Academy - Mr. Devanna - Asst Director - 94409
04364.  he is planning for a large number of new desktops, he feels can
instal Linux.  I have told him about ubuntu 9.10 & BOSS (since this is a
govt organisation, they would not mind installing BOSS - from CDAC)

2. Sri Indu College of Engineering - Mr. Ashok Babu - Planning to buy around
200 desktops - they may know Linux, and may also install by themselves.-
93470 54999

3. Environmental Protection Training & Research Institute : K. Srinivasan -
System Admin - 9885072166 (srinivasan3@yahoo.com,  srinivasan3@eptri.com)
they are planning for some new servers & 20 new desktops.  Already he is
installed Fedora (mail server) but no Linux for desktop.  Have given him an
ISO copy of 9.10.

thanks for helping.

You weren't very descriptive about what critera you would use to select the 715 
files out of the 1000 to copy. There are multiple ways to do this depending on 
your selection criteria.

For example if the criteria is based on the name of the files which follow a 
certain pattern and all the files are in the same directory, you would use 
something like

$ cp /path/to/1000/file/<pattern> /destination/folder

where <pattern> is a file 'glob' as describe in bash info pages ...
$ info bash --index-search='Pattern Matching'

If the files are in multiple sub-directories, you still can use:

$ cp /path/to/top/level/dir/<dir glob>/<file glob> /destination/folder

or two commands, one to do the matching (like 'find') and another to do the copying:

$ find /path/to/top/level/dir/ -name "<file glob>" \
	-exec cp {} /destination/folder ';'

now, with find you can also use other the selection criteria besides the name. 
Read more in the find info pages:
$ pinfo find --node='Finding Files'

...and lastly of course you can also write a script to match and copy the files.

HTH,
cheers,
- steve

Hi, i have been trying to configure one of my friend`s broadband connection
in Debian 5.0. His ISP provided his line with "dial-up-type". That means, he
needs to login in order to connect to internet. He has been using this in
Windows. Now, he installed Debian 5.0 there; but he cannot configure his
internet. I took a look and tried like this way:

1. installed pppoe
2. went to network-manager
3. opened network-manager; selected pppoe and gave username and password
4. tried to *select that pppoe; but i cannot enable it. I mean, i put a tick
just beside of it and the tick is gone!! i mean, i cannot enable that pppoe
connection there in Debian 5.0.

Thanks Bharati,

This is a virtual machine, and the issue was actually a very simple thing.
When I upgraded the kernel, the remaining little space in my / (root) became
full and since I had not created separate partition for tmp, gdm was unable
to write to it. And samba also became iunaccessible due to this.

When I deleted the kernel bz2 package, it freed some space and now both are
working.

I am not very sure about this, however if this issue is occuring after a
abrupt shutdown, you may want to check the integrity of your database files.
Try repairing them and see.

Hi 
  I m using empathy in fedora 11.I too got that problem frequently.But quitting 
empathy and restarting empathy will help me sometimes.And sometime it log in 
successfully but doesn't show my friend's list.I hope upgrading to the newest 
version of fedora will fix this.I guess Slow internet connection also makes it 
happen.

Message-ID: <7938ae610911271943i2c774536x19d2c4fe98f65a78@mail.gmail.com>

Here is how you modify a running kernel in OpenBSD

Login as root.

# config -e /bsd -o /bsd
UKC> find audio
UKC> change azalia
 ( Enter new PCI dev #, function # and bus # and even flags)
UKC> quit
Saving modified kernel.

I have got audio working several times with this approach. No need to
have kernel source code or recompile the kernel
to have new features.

I figure out the audio device's response to hardware configurator
stage whilst booting using

$ dmesg

Zico,
I haven't used the GUI for pppoe connection, but I did use the cli and
it worked for me.

You need to install and run pppoeconf [http://wiki.debian.org/PPPoE]

and then you might have to start pppoe connection

$ sudo pon dsl-provider
..

Check if this helps..

Never had to fiddle with audio or wi-fi in OpenBSD. But I have used 
config mainly to set the timezone offset(-330).

Use VNC for cross-platform desktop sharing. TightVNC works fine for me.

I installed pppoeconf and ran that from command prompt; but that failed to

There is a folder called "Password", but i'm sure, there the passwords are
not visible, only "account:......" then "param:password" is present..
Please check once again.

Hi,
  I tried to dump the audio from an avi file to ogg file using mplayer.

    mplayer -dumpaudio vizhiye.avi -dumpfile vizhiye.ogg

  It succeeds and mplayer playbacks the file fine.

SMSTools is used to send messages through a GSM modem(through serial port)
or a mobile phone.

You can get a remote shell(command line), via SSH.
$ ssh <remote_user>@<ip>

I believe you can use TightVNC(http://www.tightvnc.com) to get a graphical
interface though i have not used it myself.

I think he somehow answered the wrong question. There was another
question on sending SMS's, he meant to answer that.

If you enable xdmcp on the target system, then you can use 
a. X with -query option like
          X -query targethost
b.alternatively within existing desktop use Xnest like
          Xnest :1 -query targethost
c.Use ssh to connect and then run gui programme

Ofcourse as already suggested VNC is another option.

Stop saving passwords for autologin in empathy/pidgin :-) . Since passwords
are stored in your home folder, other users can't view it and don't let
others to use your user account .

Message-ID: <d1d01b990911282057p6db1b36btf56e5e85a9c24b02@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a laptop with the VIA Chrome 9 HC IGP CN896/VN896/P4M900 as my video
card (on-board) and my OS is Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala, i386 arch.

I am not able to find a suitable linux driver for it, I am temporarily using
vesa driver. I tried downloading the driver from the sites
   1. http://www.via.com.tw/en/support/drivers.jsp
   2. http://linux.via.com.tw/support/downloadFiles.action
After download, it says that the downloaded .tgz file is not in a valid gzip
format in both the links.

The data in http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/VIA/Chrome9+HC+IGP claims that my
graphics card driver is 'via-agp' and is supported in debian.

I also tried looking up on OpenChrome, but it claims it does not support
OpenGL.

Does anyone have the linux driver which supports 3D acceleration with OpenGL
support for this video card (or atleast the link from which they downloaded
it)? I have been searching for quite sometime, and I'm not successful.

I have also tried installing the mesa 7.5.2 package, but I didn't find any
difference.

Don't know much about the above chip but in the past, getting 3D drivers 
for VIA graphics have been a PITA.  About a year ago, I was researching 
some of their embedded board solutions and ditto problem with the 
graphics chip w.r.t Linux.  I ended up using an Intel Atom cpu mobo for 
my prototype.

What is the output of "file <filename_of_your_driver_file>"?   It could 
be corrupted if indeed the file extension is .tgz.

This could be the regular 2D Xorg driver.

First of all, thanks. Don't know why I didn't think of this earlier :)
Well, the first case:
http://linux.via.com.tw/support/downloadFiles.action
This was in bzip format, so i extracted it successfully and installed it. It
*claimed* that the installation was successful.
But, when I tried booting up the computer hangs. So i dropped to a shell
during boot and then when I said "startx", it gave me an error saying "Error
loading module 'viavideo' (No such file or directory)". So I just removed
the xorg.conf file and now its the same openchrome driver which I am using.

The second case :
http://www.via.com.tw/en/support/drivers.jsp
This was also in bzip format. It contains the source and it only provides 2D
graphics, which is already supported with openchrome.

Anyway, one of the threads in ubuntu forums pointed me to try out mesa 3D
graphics driver. I will try it out and let you know.

Short answer: Stop saving passwords in your Gnome Keyring.

First read: <http://live.gnome.org/GnomeKeyring/SecurityPhilosophy>

Alternatively, do the following:

1. Open Seahorse by going to Applications ? Accessories ? Passwords and
Encryption Keys
2. Right-click on the default keyring. It should be labelled something
like 'Passwords: login' with the icon of a folder.
3. Select 'Change Password'.
4. Change the password.

A few notes:
1. From now on, the keyring will not unlock automatically when you
login.
2. However, once you've unlocked it once, it will be unlocked until you
either (a) lock it or (b) log out.
3. Unlocking it to allow NetworkManager to use your wifi password
unlocks it for everything.

Gnome Keyring saves passwords in an encrypted file. Once you login, it
unlocks the default keyring if possible. This is how it works _by
design_.

Other solutions:
1. Remove Seahorse
2. Lock your computer when not in use or set it up to do so
automatically.

I think gtalk is running on port 5222 with TLS on gtalk.google.com. May be 
changing port will clear things.

Buddies,

This is a really complex tip. ;)

Kindly bear with me.Just follow the tip as a drone and you will be fine.

Don' t think too much or you will have trouble especially if you are
new to qemu.

Qemu is in short a x86 emulator and it does a fantastic job of it. It
is fast enough to use it
for all purposes even without kernel kqemu acceleration module which
was recently
open sourced.

This is what you need to to do to install Debian in a disk image of size 4GB.

$qemu-img create debian-qemu.bin 4G
$qemu -hda debian.qemu.bin -cdrom <path-to-debian-iso-image>

Install Debian into the qemu file store and then boot from the file
store like this.

$ qemu -hda debian-qemu.bin

It is quite amazing.

Fabrice Bellarduku Oru Kovil kattanum. ;)

He has made my life really simple.

Another thing. I recently figured that qemu can be used for booting
from physical USB or
CDROM media like this.

 # qemu -cdrom /dev/cd0a

or

# qemu -usb -hda /dev/sd0c

This is on OpenBSD. I am sure you have to give a different device
filename in your OS and it
will work too.

Have fun!

Long ago I sent a patch to add resume feature to scp(1) but Damian
Miller rejected it
because it would break backward compatibility.

Nammala mathiri poor nations pathi yaruku kavalai? ;)

So I came up with this idea.

In case your upload fails at a particular point of any file( file type
does not matter at all)

Then dd can get you the remaining bits to be uploaded like this.

$ dd if=upload.iso of=remaining.bin skip=1232322 bs=1

Remember!

You have to know the byte offset (1232322) and bs=1 will take care of that.

And once you get the two files at the remote end.

$ cat broken.iso remaining.bin > full.iso

Try it!

After that of course you have to run a sha1 checksum to ensure that
the file is not
corrupted.

I shall send the language tip later. I shall be analyzing the trickle
source code.

Look at this.

http://monkey.org/~marius/trickle/trickle.pdf

It is a bandwidth control application. It is an amazing tool but I
have never used it. ;)

Hopefully I will use it soon at one of my client locations.

I will take time. Please bear with me.

Subject: [Ilugc] [LANGUAGETIP - perl ] edit files in place with perl with
	Tie::File module
Message-ID: <7938ae610911300044l5b952f23le5602fec2eb4af16@mail.gmail.com>

I relented since I am really busy now and am not in the pink of my health.

I am to talk about perl.

This article has all the gory details. I shall talk about trickle in
some other language tip.

For now, take a look at this:

http://aplawrence.com/Girish/tie-file.html

I am yanking the text for those of you who can't access Internet but
can access mail. ;)

The fun with perl is that its manuals are very verbose. Usually it
hurts more than helps since you waste a lot of time to learn
something. In most cases you want to get your job done and you don't
have time to learn everything. You want to use the best tool for the
job and save time to get to the juicier parts of your work.

Your work could mean product development or a quick project. We find
that the ability to manipulate configuration files usually stored
under the /etc directory using a scripting language like perl eases
development in a big way.

I used to do this by hand in perl. It was painful and error prone.
There was no way I could cover all cases and I was looking for a
better way to do things though I mostly gave up on this. That is when
I got to know about Tie::File perl module. This is a delightful way to
do in place editing of files. You don't have to save a copy in /tmp
under a unique file name and then delete it. Truly delightful
experience. Let us look at a sample.

   use Tie::File;

   tie @array, 'Tie::File', filename or die ...;

   $array[13] = 'blah';     # line 13 of the file is now 'blah'
   print $array[42];        # display line 42 of the file

   $n_recs = @array;        # how many records are in the file?
   $#array -= 2;            # chop two records off the end

   for (@array) {
   s/PERL/Perl/g;         # Replace PERL with Perl everywhere in the file
   }

   # These are just like regular push, pop, unshift, shift,
   # and splice
   # Except that they modify the file in the way you would
   # expect

   push @array, new recs...;
   my $r1 = pop @array;
   unshift @array, new recs...;
   my $r2 = shift @array;
   @old_recs = splice @array, 3, 7, new recs...;

   untie @array;            # all finished


I got this straight from the Tie::File man page. This is a case in
point. Nearly every perl module like Digest::SHA1 or DBI come with a
neat way to use their API. The perl online manuals are flush with
examples that straight away illustrate how to use the facilities
offered by the great modules found in CPAN.

Let us get back to our good old problem of file editing.

This line begins our process.

      tie @array, 'Tie::File', filename or die ...;


The text file gets automatically sucked into the perl array @array
with each element of the array containing a line from the file. In our
case we want to edit configuration files. So let us say that we wish
to modify the file /etc/resolv.conf and add a public nameserver to the
list already present.

This line will eminently do the job.

	push @array, "nameserver 4.4.4.3";


The file gets written back when you untie the array. Here is the
complete program.

    use Tie::File;
    tie @resolvarray, 'Tie::File', "/etc/resolv.conf" or
      die "Could not open /etc/resolv.conf file for writing, are you root?";
    push @resolvarray, "nameserver 4.4.4.3";
    untie @resolvarray or die "Could not close file";


I intentionally gave a very simple example. We could do the same thing
with massive text files and do inplace editing if we know in advance
which line number corresponds to which configuration parameter.
Several examples like the Apache httpd.conf, ntp.conf, dict.conf come
to mind.

I personally used Tie::File for my web interface for my spam control
product. The backend CGI used this. I also use Tie::File for
manipulating text files using my nCurses UI. The code is the same. You
could build the input values from different sources.

Perl comes bundled with several useful modules in its default install.
However if you wish to find if a particular module is installed and
available, you could try this.

$ perl -e 'use Tie::File;'


Perl is the only programming language with a centralized well managed
CPAN archive. The repository is so excellently managed that its search
features, the code quality found in modules and the other aspects of
its ecosystem works remarkably well. What irritates me is the perl
-MCPAN switch that installs modules from the command line. It asks so
many questions that leaves me tired and frustrated. Instead I find
that in BSD operating systems many popular perl modules are available
as readymade packages.

security is a process - so watch /var/log/messages and see what the hackers 
are upto (you *did* disable ftp and telnet?). If you have a mail server make 
sure you have smtp auth. And I hope you are not serving anything from document 
root and are using parametrised sql queries.

There are a lot of issues you are talking about. It depends on what services
you are running on your server, what is the server configuration, etc.

1) Maintain a log of what is going on and watch it regularly.
2) Have only required services running, disable all other services.
3) Use secure services like SFTP instead of plain text FTP, and https
instead of http if possible and if necessary, so that MITM attacks are
minimized.
4) Provide authentication in whatever service you are providing.
5) Have proper and secure input processing wherever possible (to prevent
SQLi and XSS, etc).
6) Use firewalls and make sure you are secure against DOS and DDOS.

There are a lot more but it depends on what services you are providing.
Please be specific and provide the necessary data.

One alternative to these suggestions is to use 'rsync' with the
'--partial' flag.

Who knows, if two blocks of your file are the same then you may even
save on bandwidth compared with 'scp'!

I'd suggest you use OpenBSD or Engarde Linux. I've tried Engarde, it
is very good from the security point of view, but you need another
client to use the web interface. And whatever flavour you use, keep an
eye on the log, use an IDS (Engarde has one) and turn off needless
services. I agree with KG "Security is a process".

apache should be the culprit - probably eating up memory. There are a lot of 
tweaks, depending on what kind of service you are running.

for a start stop apache and start it. See if the speed improves and then gets 
slower over time. Tweaking Apache is great fun - but you could also think of 
using nginx.

 This is good.Before going to check every thing kindly check your available
RAM.Because when  we are using DB , it occupies a lot of RAM.
 #free -m
now you can get available RAM and Free space also.
then run this command to clear cache in RAM
#sync
#echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

Then you can get a lot of RAM to run your application

Hi,

apt-cache search subtitle

That command in my ubuntu gave the following results.


gaupol - subtitle editor for text-based subtitle files
gnome-subtitles - Subtitles editor for the GNOME Desktop environment
subdownloader - subtitle download/upload manager for video files
subtitleeditor - Graphical subtitle editor with sound waves representation
vdr-plugin-ttxtsubs - Teletext subtitle plugin for VDR
ksubtitleripper - GUI for KDE to rip DVD subtitles
submux-dvd - subtitle multiplexer, muxes subtitles into .vob
subtitleripper - DVD Subtitle Ripper for Linux

us a 4 hour slot on 8th of Dec 2009 between 12 pm and 5 pm with  lunch
break between 1 and 2 pm.
About the audience, it will be roughly around 20 research students of
M Phil and Ph.D.

So guyz, join the party.
