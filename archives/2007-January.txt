Always use interleaved posting. Trim the post you are
replying to and interleave your replies so that each
part of the reply is under the quoted part that you
are replying to. Further please leave a gap of one
line between the matter you are quoting and your
reply.

   what is your name?
   regards
   xyz

trimmed and replied as:

I could not visit the intended page. But, i think the point is right.
The other day, when i was in ELCOT for configuring tamil keyboard
layout, couple of delegates from Microsoft including the Managing
Director for India met Umashankar and they were ready to provide him
MS office and XP professional for the cheapest price. But Umashankar
was demonstrating them the power of Openoffice and arguing why he
should ever consider to use MS office.

When they invited him to view the e-gov initiatives taken by Singapore
Govt. using Microsoft technologies, he advised them to bring them here
to see the initiatives taken by him in Tamil Nadu using open source
softwares.

And yeah, the help from ILUGC volunteers are appreciated. But i think,
it's not enough. We should put our best efforts and see we help him in
all possible areas. Couple of us should meet him on regular basis and
insure the expertise we have in ILUGC are very well leveraged for TN's
purpose.

Here is the copy of the news. I had saved it in my pc.

TN may shut door on Microsoft
 *Chennai, Dec. 31:* The Tamil Nadu government, which is on a fast-track
pushing the state to the top in the Indian IT sector, has almost shut its
door on the software giant, Microsoft, preferring the Open Source Systems
(OSS) for reasons of costs and easy migrating capabilities.

?Initially, 99 per cent of government systems have been running on Microsoft
systems but then 2007 will be a watershed year for the state IT sector. We
are fast migrating to Linux operating systems which are so much cheaper and
can be operated at low cost, besides offering continuous updates and freedom
from viruses,? says Mr C. Umashankar, managing director of state-owned
ELCOT, vested with the responsibility of overseeing such ambitious
government projects as e-governance, enumerating the beneficiaries of the
free TV scheme, family ration cards and the free sari-dhoti distribution.

?We have already dispatched 6,500 Linux systems to village panchayats and
another 6,100 Acer desktop systems with Suse Linux operating systems are on
their way. We are procuring 20,000 desktop systems for schools, which will
run only on Suse Linux. Remaining 30 desktop systems will also migrate as
and when the new machines arrive,? Mr Umashankar told this newspaper.
He said all the ELCOT servers were on Redhat Linus and the government IT
company?s 28-seater software development wing was fully on Suse Linux.

?We will train over 30,000 government officials in Linux Operating Systems
and Open Office. A contract has been already finalised with the government
departments and we have set up a Linux support centre with two
Linux-certified professionals to assist the state officers. This number will
go up to ten or more in 2007, which will be a path-breaking year for
government on migration to Linux Operating System,?  Mr Umashankar said.
?India can live without Microsoft packages and even progress but Microsoft
will find it tough without a huge country like India buying their software
packages,? he said.

He said a top official from Microsoft India had met him twice to convince
him to continue with MS products. The official offered the XP operating
system for about Rs.7000 while he quoted Rs.500. ?I explained to her that
for a mere Rs.300, I could get the entire operating system, office
productivity software and a wide range of utility tools, such as DVD/CD
writing software, database software, multimedia editing software, vector
map-drawing software plus a whole range of software development tools. Also,
I have the option of downloading this entire package in DVD media and not
even pay that Rs.300, which is the media cost and not the software charges,?
said the ELCOT chief, an IT expert himself besides being a senior IAS
bureaucrat.

He said he had also pointed out to the Microsoft official that MS Office did
not allow saving of documents in open document format. While it was possible
to open all MS Office files using Openoffice.org, the vice versa cannot be
done. ?I asked her why ELCOT should buy such an inferior product when
 Openoffice.org is available free of cost for Windows as well as Linux.

She said Microsoft are working on open XML format,? he added. Mr Umashankar
said he had written to state finance secretary enumerating the ?huge
financial and working advantages? of shifting to Open Source Environment in
all government departments. ?I have been receiving great support from all
the senior IAS officers here, from the chief secretary downwards. It is very
encouraging.

ELCOT is not the loser when Microsoft did not accept our price of Rs.500; on
the other hand, Microsoft loses out due to our big volumes involved,? he
said.
?There is a gross misconception among the governments and officials that if
they migrate to Open Source platform, Microsoft would get angry and the
entire software industry could come to a grinding halt. This is totally
misplaced fear,? Mr Umashankar said.

?Within the next five years, it is going to be the IT services which would
dominate the revenue share of the IT companies, because more and more users,
governments and the corporate sector have started migrating to OS software,
thus removing the scope for more revenues from products. It is time that the
users understood this scenario and start saving their precious revenues,? Mr
Umashankar said.

Talking of the changes happening in this direction, he said he had ordered
43 rack servers for ELCOT to host various government applications. ?All the
applications are to run under OS software. I would have paid Rs.20 lakh per
server if I had adopted proprietary software but now I have saved over
Rs.8crore from this one transaction.

We intend to procure 1000 servers in the next two years. Imagine the amount
of savings we are getting out of this,? the ELCOT chief said. ?In my view, a
state government of TN magnitude would be able to save Rs 200-500 crores
every year, when the National e-governance action plan gets implemented,? he
said, adding that school children too could get the benefit of ?more robust,
secure and economical Open Source software for their work,? he added.
?Today, there is more demand for OSS trained engineers. I require at least
500 trainers to train 30,000 state officials across Tamil Nadu in the next
six months.

I don't want to rain on anybody's parade here, but to the cynic in me,
the above sounds as if this senior IAS officer is just fishing for a
lower price deal from Microsoft and he might switch sides if Microsoft
offers, say Rs. 250 per seat (which they can, and they probably will,
to salvage such a massive deal).

true, that's what people normally do. Use FOSS as a bargaining tool
with MS. But in this case it looks like Mr. Umashanker is not just
talking numbers. Systems already seem to be on their way to the
prospective users.

Quoting from TFA,

"We have already dispatched 6,500 Linux systems to village panchayats and
another 6,100 Acer desktop systems with Suse Linux operating systems are on
their way. "

The installation base of 6,500 is nothing to scoff at. IIRC, the
much-hyped Munich administration could only push 10,000 linux b0xen in
3 years.

It will be difficult for MS because that will become standard price
not only in TN but in all State and Central Government.

After few meetings with him I feel he may change. In my opinion, he
considered all aspects like dependendance on single vendor, practical
problems like virus apart from cost factors. More than that, already
about 6500 systems are deployed and another 6k in few months. If he
has his way for another 6-12 months I feel FOSS has great chance of
success in Govt of TN, as it is very difficult to change once process
starts rolling in government service. 

Also he is arm-twisting Linux vendors and hardware makers to provide
proper support to Linux which I my opinion shows that he is convinced
about FOSS.

However he is also human being and may prove me wrong, which I hope
will not happen.

Well, the OEM price for Windows XP is $20 or less, for big guys (like
Dell etc.). Since there is hardly any incremental costs for software
for additional copies sold, they can undercut the price as much as
they want (and say, ask for a much higher amount at the next upgrade).

I too hope the project is a massive success and a trend setter for
other state governments (Hyderabad - hint, hint :)

Since MS doesn't sell directly to GOI but only thro OEM, they have to
slash prices of OEM which again leads to one more entity asking for
price cut.

Exactly this was the point, he was discussing i.e cost in next cycle
of upgrade/purchase. This is one more reason why he is convinced.

Your bios should support that ,

You have a few options :

* Puppy Linux : http://www.puppyos.com/
* Damn Small Linux : http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/
* Feather Linux : http://featherlinux.berlios.de/

These are small distro's < 256M. Add the packages you need after
getting the base distro installed.

And, as Antano said, make sure your motherboard/bios has USB boot
support (all recent ones does).

M$ is known to undercut any situation. so, one has to be very careful.
You can't fight them on prices. They did this in punjab and surely
elsewhere in the world. They r capable of killing others' deal (read
Linux deals). We have faced this ourselves.
The TN initiative needs to be supported by making it popular among
people - by making loud noise as to how the Govt. ( & hence the
tax-payers) is saving a huge sum of money.

Very interesting. Though I am a little concerned about who is backing
the Linux roll-out, technically. However user-friendly the desktop might
be, still a KDE or a GNOME looks alien to most regular computer users.
And most users hate change. So, there has to be a strong training
initiative, and technical know-how to deal with these issues, and grow
the infrastructure as the need for such systems grows. That might
include user manuals in Tamil, etc. to explain how exactly to trouble
shoot a Linux distro, apart from things like explaining the advanced
functionality of OO.org. Does ELCOT have the technical know-how to
impart such training and deal with technical issues? Perhaps this is the
domain of NRC-FOSS?

I'm concerned because if there isn't a strong back-end support for this
effort, people will get frustrated, and you certainly can't expect a
govt clerk to hit google to know how to do mail-merge in OO.org. Inspite
of all the good intentions, this effort might still get defeated if the
whole thing is not thought through. Perhaps a backlash too. Regular
users just don't care about whether it's free, closed or whatever. They
just want to get their job done. So is ELCOT ready with this kind of
support when they need it?

Contrast this to deploying FOSS at a university. It's practically
risk-free because the students will figure it out, at least they will
make an effort to do so. And there are peers you can depend on. You
can't expect that from govt. employees. It would be interesting to know
how much of all this is figured out. I'm  skeptical because the IAS
officer concerned explains the cost factor of Linux to an MS exec. If he
is really in the know, he wouldn't be even talking to them, and would
concentrate on creating the infrastructure to smoothen the roll-out.
Just thinking aloud.

Price is *not* what we should be talking about here. For all I can
foresee, going FOSS would mean they would actually end up paying more in
efforts other than buying the software (like translations and printing
manuals, for example - and they have to be pictorial, no?). What we
should be talking about is whether ELCOT or Mr. Umashankar has the
commitment to go FOSS *even if it costs more* in the short-term. Sorry
to play the devil's advocate - something makes me wonder if they know
what they're getting into.

In LFTP, "find" does just that. Except, it will just recursively
traverse all directories and display all files. So, you can use find |
grep to narrow down the results.

Also, the find in LFTP has an option called "-d" to restrict the depth
of the subdirectories it enters.

HTH.

They have got into deal with Novell India I suppose as they got Suse 
Enterprise Edition being Installed. So, they will get professional 
support for that. Additional support has been given by ilug-chennai, 
especially to train a first set of people and using these people, 
additional batches will be trained.

  That might

Novell Suse has themselves developed a Tamil User Guide and it had been 
indeed sent to the list up by Raman of some time ago. Please check the 
archives (Nov or Dec 2006) for the same.

I do not think NRCFOSS is involved in this, but ilug-chennai has been 
rendering all possible support since Day 1.

They do not need to do any google to find things. A proper user manual 
in Tamil has been already made and would have been distributed by now. 
Also, they are not going to use it any more than using a desktop for not 
office chores like Writing Documents, using Speadsheets, Mails etc. I 
hope this has been well covered in the user manual. And also, there is a 
plan for training which was addressed during a couple of LUG meets ago. 
Please check the archives for minutes of meet if any.

AFAIK, Mr.Uma shankar has got a fairly very good knowledge about Linux. 
not just the economic factor of it but also the 'freedom' factor and 
usability. He talks about the cost factor because that can push FOSS 
into government in a big way.

use curlftpfs or gnomevfs-mount or kio_fuse to mount the ftp site
using fuse. then it just takes any of your unix tools (like find) to
do what you want...

it moves on...

User friendly has nothing to do with this point i'm posting. when i was
working for HP there was a strange case about Brazilan Bank telling that
their unix server is not syn with windows time server. We were arguing them
to use Standard Unix Time servers  instead of Windows time server. latter we
found that Windows has issues with NTP v4. before Identifying where is the
problem the Bank were ferious with us telling that they are in loss and high
risk since time is not sync. after convinsing them by telling the full
reason, they changed the configuration. and also they were considering to
move away from windows server. Till now i'm not sure whether Windows has fix
(if so it should not break older versions of NTP) so support wise it all
depends. and i feel that M$ does much worse support than others.

Folks,
          This news item just made it to Slashdot:

http://linux.slashdot.org/linux/07/01/03/0226229.shtml

As has been pointed about by others, the issue is not
the price, but the freedom of choice offered by OSS.
Let's hope they can pull off the pilot program smoothly.

-Siva

P.S. FLOSS is significantly more competitive against
Vista - existing HW can run most, if not all, Linux distros -
while Vista will need a significant HW refresh cycle. I
believe it's doomed - probably the last packaged
consumer OS from Redmond. They'll stick to apps
and services after Vista bombs.

Hello ppl,
I know this is really happening news, but I also sense some trouble that may
brew.
microsoft has never been known to take challanges lightly. So let me point
two things out:

1.) TN plans to use SUSE but Novell has, as everybody knows, just signed a
patents and support agreement with microsoft.
    This means microsoft can try something sinister indirectly.

2.) Most of the TN home users do not have legal copies of microsoft
products, and I am sure microsoft knows this. What if they decide to hit
back, by using this fact? It could cause serious trouble to the state and
goverment.

Any thoughts on the above two points? I would be glad to know your views.

Thanx
Shiva

TN should go for ubuntu/redhat then.

Will help everyone move to OSS.  Something M$ knows and fears. Thats the
reason they go easy on piracy - in fact this view was expressed in a
techdirt (I think) article years back.

My real fear is that Mr. Uma Shankar will get shunted to some other
department. He has been known to take upright stances against any political
interference - the infamous cemetry shed scandal during AIADMK's earlier
tenure  (91-96) is a case in point. Lets hope he does'nt  get treated
shabbily now!

mano

Even if it helps everyone move to OSS (Practically its impossible, unless we
start a huge advertisment campain), once the damage is done its done. When
there is red handed proof the goverment can't deny, there will be trouble if
M$ seeks compensation. (Compensation because its impossible to arrest 100k+
ppl).

One way may be abt really quickening the pace of OSS awareness.

Nil chances M$ would resort to imposing its rights. If it does it can kiss
the Indian market (and most other 3rd world markets) goodbye. Such a move is
not only impractical but also a PR disaster M$ would'nt risk.

As I am using Linux since a couple of years and guess you all have a certain amount of experience

Two scenarios for Linux:
1) Private PC: User must be interested in OS and PC. Needs much more knowledge and time. Important is the "experience". I guess most of us (including me) are in this category.

2) Professionally hosted system as in an office. There is a team of administrators, supporters and so on.
Clerk does not need knowledge about OS or Linux. Just applications.
This is this case. From my point of view this is a reasonable way for the different Linux environments. 

One for MS/Apple
3) The clerk from 2) at home: Not interested in OS. Just wants that it works. No time. Lazy. No knowledge in this domain. I recommend (e.g. your mother) Apple to this people. But I am sure, there Linux is not going to prevail.

Yes I understand all that you are saying about my second point, perhaps I
should have been clearer. M$ may not "impose" its "rights", but instead
threaten to impose its "rights'. This will be like the classic blackmail M$
deals to competitors. Then it will be a battle of sense and will. However it
may still escalate to a political issue.

View the other side of the coin - its Novell to which M$ is already into 
some agreement. So M$ have not lost the hold still. And, even if M$ 
makes Novell to change its mind, before that the people using all those 
systems would have got used to using Linux. So, then it doesnt matter 
what distro they use, they will be able to use most distros provided 
same kind of environment (GNOME/KDE) and same tools are provided. Te 
hardware is ours, and we can change the OS when needed without any huge 
spending.

LOL! Do you think M$ will ever do it. See, they also know the Indian 
mentality. The moment you charge something, they move to lower cost/free 
options. Example, how many homes moved to CAS when it was introduced ? 
Today nobody cribbs of getting only free channels, as far as the TV 
serials come in free channels we wont change and even if one of the 
leading TV channel is going non-free, then people will just start 
watching what is free. The TV channels too know it. Likewise M$ does 
know the same.

Second, I agree M$ can sue us. But, for every user they are going to 
sue, they have to spend something on their end too. Fighting with the 
entire Indian or even TN population on such a case will cost both in $$$ 
as well as in 'Image'. We Indians may fight with one another, but if 
such an issue pop ups, we will unite and within a night or at least a 
fortnight we will shed Windows at least in homes. So, thats not going to 
happen, as far as we have a free alternative and a community to create 
awareness about it. So, more and more is the FOSS human resource, less 
and less is such possibilities.

> Any thoughts on the above two points? I would be glad to know your views.

Just my 2 paisa.

> TN should go for ubuntu/redhat then.

I personally feel some one ( u & me ;-), why not? ) from TN or Lanka or any
Tamil Speaking world should soon produce an GNU/ Linux OS and that should be
used.

Small portion of all the all the investments the TCS, Wipro, Infy and other
Softies invest can be directed for this...

We have to customize Ubuntu to suit our (Tamil) needs. We are/ or just began
to work towards this... BOSS initiative of NRCFOSS is a right step towards
this.

Well Fedora + Ubuntu derivative would suit... Ubuntu is gud to install and
is more user friendly.. But to suit Tamil from scratch (atleast the
inputting part) Fedora is gud.. We need to put little efforts to get Tamil
features in Ubuntu as on date... We wil make Ubuntu too of that kind...

To be frank I have tried only these two versions... Other distros am least
aware of.. Heard that Mandriva was the first Tamil GNU/ Linux OS... and Suse
too supports Tamil well.. Otherwise a person of Uma Shankar's calibre
wouldn't have chosen it...

Lets bid next time for Ubuntu ;-)

One reason why Ubuntu might be supported is that Ubuntu has in its
fundamental principles that software should be made available in people's
own Language..

This has always been the Bharathiya principles.. respecting the
individuality and identity of each ethnic group.. and not imposing one's
over other...

I am not aware whether any other OS has this as its basic principle... We
have just asked for Ubuntu Certifications to be done in Tamil.. Awaiting
feedback... Hope in course of time it can happen...

Microsoft wouldnt dare try to sue every single person in TN who are
using pirated windows - it will take them forever to file the cases,
get them through all the legal proceedings, get convincing evidences
for all the cases and get convictions done. It is probably going to
cost them lesser than the cost of these pirated windows but definitely
it is going to take a long long long time. A realistic option would be
if microsoft tries to sue some govt agencies - but that is not going
to happen as TN govt is trying to switch to linux en-mass. This is a
lose-lose situation for microsoft unless the project backfires. The
only way the project can backfire is through lack of quality support.
One thing Mr. Umashanker is going to have to prepare is a good support
team physically spread through out the state to be able to support the
complete infrastructure. That is - at least initially. Ultimately
there would be enough knowledgable people locally to handle issues
locally like they do with windows now.

No need to worry. This has already been done and a lot has been
achieved.
OpenLX Linux was launched in Feb 2005 and by now more than 45,000 CDs
have been shipped and over 1,00,000 downloads have taken place.
There are users all over India apart from those in 30 countries and the
response is great.

The Distro is available as GPL for free downloads from www.openlx.com
and has two versions. 
A single CD distribution is made for the Desktop users (using OS,
Office, Internet, Grafics, Multimedia, Utilities and kalculate-demo) and
it has become the easiest to install Linux. There is no scope of making
a mistake while installing it.

We would like the Tamil-language using community to help build the
language in the distro (The KDE and Gnome stuff is already there in
Tamil) so that it can be more easily adapted by the Tamil language
users.

I can send you a few copies, if you send me your address and they can be
shared among the LUG members and others.

India deserves its OS and we have taken this steps.

Ask Mitul Limbani on the ILUG-BOM list. He'll most probably be able to help 
you.

Message-ID: <5380.202.144.30.226.1167822482.squirrel@mail.gdatech.co.in>

Hi,
  I am working on MPC8360E Security Engine. I have ported the Openswan
2.4.5(IPSec --KLIPS) with OCF to MPC8360E's Security Engine (Talitos).
Encryption and Decryption is working. But when I check the performance of
Talitos with netio benchmark Tool, IPSec S/W Algorithms is giving more
bandwidth than Talitos.
  I do not know that why Talitos is giving less bandwidth and any probelm
in Openswan or OCF or Talitos driver or Talitos H/W. Please give your
suggestions and if you have any link related to Talitos, send to me.
If you know any benchmark tool like netio, inform to me.

  Linux kernel version is 2.6.11.

  I tested the IPSec performance by netio tool. The output is

Without IPSec :
-------------
Packet size  1k bytes:  8735 KByte/s Tx,  11242 KByte/s Rx.
Packet size  2k bytes:  8723 KByte/s Tx,  11001 KByte/s Rx.

Packet size 32k bytes:  8725 KByte/s Tx,  11002 KByte/s Rx.

IPSec in S/W :
------------
Packet size  1k bytes:  884 KByte/s Tx,  1120 KByte/s Rx.
Packet size  2k bytes:  1234 KByte/s Tx,  1149 KByte/s Rx.

Packet size 32k bytes:  60072 Byte/s Tx,  575 KByte/s Rx.

 I sholud get more bandwidth when I test through IPSec H/W. But I am
getting less bandwidth compare to IPSec S/W.

 But When I transmit 32 MB size file through tftp, it is transmitted in
139.0 seconds in IPSec S/W. When we transmit the same file, it is
transmitted in 136.2 seconds in IPSec H/W.

 When I ping the system, I got the reply in 2ms in IPSec S/W and 1ms in
IPSec H/W.

-Thanks

Okay, performance measurement and improvement is always a tricky affair. You have to be prepared for surprises and shocks. :)

I am not  sure what the issue is here but your numbers  are definitely screwed  up. You should get close to the same throughput you would get without IPsec if you have hardware acceleration.

I used to measure with the Openssl speed command and it used to give pretty good results with crypto acceleration.

In your case also the underlying acceleration mechanism will be quite similar, but you are using IPsec instead of SSL.

Can you use other tools for measuring? And do all kind of sanity checks? I had a severe performance issue when  I was not using the right optimization flags to the compiler.

In your case you have to check for the DMA throughput. Is the crypto acceleration getting all the resources it needs to do  a good job?

And you have to take multiple samples. And figure out the standard deviation or something. Just a one off test will not be accurate.

Can you do more testing please and if possible share the documentation on how the crypto chip interacts with your processor?

Does it use the PCKS#11 interface thro' a shared library? Does it get the microcode from somewhere?

More details will certainly help us conclude.

Best of luck!

Dear friends,
Whatever happens to Mr.Umashankar at ELCOT,
LUGC will always be there ,long live LUGC.
LUGC should develop a Tamil Linux installable LiveCD
distro and distribute it free at all demos, preferably
in non-metro areas.

I tried my best but couldn't stop, sorry if I sound a bit sarcastic.

1. ILUGC *supports* ELCOT's initiative, rather Mr.UmaShankar's 
initiative, to implemenet FOSS solutions in Government. And this support 
was offered after the 'person-in-focus' himself attended one LUG meet 
and explained us his thoughts/ideas/vision and we felt we could trust 
his words and support. If Am Not Wrong, ILUGC is just *supporting* the 
initiative and is not *involved* or *participating* in it. As far as 
Mr.UmaShankar or his successors carry out the same, our *support* will 
continue.

2. Off late I have seen many calls for a *tamilized* distribution. I 
just wanted to add my 2 paisas over this. I feel that we have too much 
distributions under the Umbrella of Linux (GNU/Linux) that we often 
argue which one is the best, at least for fun. But, think for any one 
who wants to try out Linux its fairly a few choices to have - Ubuntu, 
Fedora Core, Madrivia and may be Gentoo later. Once he gets hold of the 
gimmicks, he can try still higher order distros, especially Debian. And 
now, some one will say a dozen other distros.

The point is most of these distributions have facilities to implement 
local language computing. The main problem is we do not have enough 
volunteers to develop the corresponding Local language support thats 
required to make local language computing with these existing 
distributions possible. Am not saying we are in a *bad* state, but we do 
need to do more.

And for all those who ask for a tamilized Linux distro, how many of you 
have changed your existing desktops to tamil ones ? It seriously depends 
on the place where it is going to be applied, that we need either 
English or Tamil softwares/desktops/whatever.

What I feel is, rather than putting our efforts to creating something 
new, we can rather put the same effort in improving what we have. This 
will also make us achieve our goals faster as we already have a base to 
work upon, as well as reduce the unnecessary confusions by adding more 
and more distributions to the stock pile.

For ur update its just a beginning, and we do have people like me changing
their desktops to Tamil. It was a long cherished dream come true for us. We
have started using Tamil99 keyboard developed by M/s TVS. It costs Rs 450 @
Ritchie street. We do shift the Language to English but then we are shifting
to Tamil in near future for sure.

Its a change that *will *happen in course of time.

Well all my folders except system folders are named in Tamil. Say for
instance i have Songs folder named as Paadalgal. There are ppl in Ubuntu
Tamil Team atleast of my kind. We name the files in Tamil and attche them as
such in mails we exchange... :-) Am proud to share this..

Message-ID: <459CF2A1.2000700@efyindia.com>

Dear Members of the community,

LinuxAsia 2007 is coming. And this year, we would like to ensure that 
the Linux/OSS community is fully engaged with the event.

What all is happening at LinuxAsia this year?
*********************************************

The main track - 'technology.innovation@oss.in', which will go on for 3 
days from 31st January till 2nd February 2007 at the India Habitat 
Centre, New Delhi.

The second track - CXOSummit - is a one-day event being held at Hotel 
Taj Mahal, Man Singh, New Delhi on the 1st of February 2007.

Besides that, there will be an IOSN summit, ODF India Chapter summit, 
technical workshops, sessions by LUGs, and last but not the least, the Expo.

What are the entry charges?
***************************

FIRST 500 FREE!!!
Ok, this is best news of the day - the first 500 registrants can get the 
COMMUNITY PASS, which allows them entry to the 
'technology.innovation@oss.in' track for FREE (subject to availability 
of vacant seats in the main hall and on a first-cum-first-served basis)! 
Though there is an element of organisers' checking your details and 
approving the serious cases only, but then, if you're serious about 
attending International-level Linux/OSS events - then REGISTER NOW at 
http://www.linuxasia.net.

DELEGATE PASSES FOR SERIOUS PROFESSIONALS
For the serious professionals who want 'guaranteed seating' at LinuxAsia 
2007, we have the DELEGATE PASS. There is an 'early bird' offer till 
25th Jan 07 (subject to availability of seats). Simply opt for 'more 
info on the Delegate Pass' while registering for LinuxAsia 2007, and our 
team will get back to you immediately.

Plus, there are special discounts on the DELEGATE PASSES for ILUG-Delhi 
members, EFY subscribers, and students!

What about entry to the CXOSummit?
**********************************

The CXOSummit is a 'by-invitation-only' event. But, you can opt for that 
while registering for LinuxAsia 2007, and if your profile matches that 
of a CXO, our team will connect with you immediately.

Who all are going to speak at LinuxAsia 2007?
*********************************************

Klaus Knopper (Knoppix), Brian Behlendorf (Apache and CollabNet), Dr 
Negroponte (one-laptop-per-child programme), are some of the 
international technology Gurus who have confirmed. We expect 3-4 more 
global luminaries to be there--their confirmation is in progress.

Any facilities for out-station delegates?
*****************************************

We have tied up with 'hospitality partners' who can assist you in 
getting best deals for travel and stay. If you need this support, simply 
select that option while registering.

What is LinuxAsia trying to achieve this year?
**********************************************

The goals that have been laid down for LinuxAsia 07 are:

Goal #1: Promote open source driven innovation so that India can 
showcase a minimum of 20 globally recognised OSS projects at LinuxAsia 2008.

Goal #2: Accelerate the adoption of Linux and open source software by 
highlighting their advantages, sharing success stories, and discussing 
strategies on how CXOs can gain advantage from both "open source" and 
"proprietary" worlds.

Goal #3: To provide a platform where other organisations with 
OSS-related agendas can hold their own sub-events and network with the 
entire community.

So, we request you to register, participate, and let us know how we 
fared in achieving those goals.

Cheers!
Team, LinuxAsia

Google has all that you need.  And if you dig through all the "why

I was reading through the discussion about creating a tamil
distribution. I believe we are talking about localization here. Like
Parthan was saying, we dont need a separate distribution for that;
would we? If enough people decide to support one of the major distros
+ selected software to localize to tamil/whatever regional language,
we will have the desired result. That should remove a big entry
barrier for somebody who does not know english from using PCs.

I would like to have few clarifications...

1) As we are employed the best possible time we could contribute can be week
ends. Has this been taken into account? Or any other plans of training like
early in the morning? and late in the evening? ;-)

2) I would like to contribute to train Panchayat officials from
Thiruvidaimaruthur and Kumbakonam Taluks of Thanjavur district. This way I
can keep my work continuos since i will be visiting my village often.

Mostly, ur ethernet card would be detected automatically. All you need to do
is specify if ur system should use DHCP, or otherwise specify ur system IP,
DNS, etc., and restart the network.

machines.please send me complete guide to setup firewall for the above

By the way,I have installed this on a Intel mechine with two NIC

Im no expert.. but what I did is install the "bind" packages. (Maybe you dint install them initially), and start a DNS server from YaST.

Hope this solves your problem

Mostly, ur ethernet card would be detected automatically. All you need to do
is specify if ur system should use DHCP, or otherwise specify ur system IP,
DNS, etc., and restart the network.

Arun, goto

yast -> network devices.
Then check there.

An easier way is to use the command prompt.

switch to super user by using command "su".

then type "pppoe-setup". Follow the wizard.

I am getting download speed of about 1.5 mbps.

I am using 250 plan.

It was mentioned in bsnl website that there will be *no speed increase for
the unlimited plans.

If the device that BSNL gave you has an ethernet socket, it can work as a
router (so the pppoe is not required.). Its IP address is 192.168.1.1. So
you have to configure your NIC to have an IP in that class (say 192.168.1.2)
and configure the default gateway to point to 192.168.1.1. I do not know
which file holds the configuration info in Suse!

Am on a home1000 plan. Got about 110KBps (approx 900kbps) on 1st Jan. Now am
getting only 10-20KBps. Used to get 30KBps earlier!!

Guess this is OT though so changed the subject appropriately.

I have volunteered to be the "co-ordinator" of a coding competition for the technical festival of my college.For this I have to frame some programming puzzles.

I tried to google this but I could not find interesting stuff. Even if i find some questions then are accompanied by solutions. I dont want the participants to google the question and find the solution The questions need to be a bit tough ( but not very tought, college students are participating )

Can you guys suggest me some links ?

Hello all, 
 I have written a tamil transliteration tool using GTK+ toolkit for 
GNOME environment.
 
 Description:  Tamizh Karuvi is an English to Tamil transliteration 
tool. It can be used to provide Unicode UTF-8 input to programs  within 
GNOME/GTK+ environments. The software provides a nice GUI and a command 
line program. The encoding table used is from the standard JaffnaLibrary
 
 It can be found here:

I have often found links scanty for this sort of thing.

I could give a few

	a) spell checker and palindrome checker

	b) simple primality testing

	c) counting number of words,characters, sentences,paras etc. in a text file ( you can come up with variations and twists here)
	d) you can always ask for an optimized search/sort algo

	e) linked lists are an ocean and you can combine them with arrays for variety of algorithmic problems. These are problems where algorithms are deeply influenced by how data is organized in memory
	  i) one real world problem i solved for this involved certificate chain building from issuer and subject name. I used a very complicated data structure for this using a linked list array combo

        f) you can always come up with good python problems

	g) regex based problems also are quite ubiquitous

	h) radix tree is a commonly used data structure in routing problems, you could also ask people to build an optimized routing table using Dijkstra for wired networks and improve upon it for ad hoc wireless networks

	i) you could generate random numbers using a PRNG and test the quality of the randomness(entropy) programatically and solve problems in gaming and several other real world situations. In fact random number generation is so central not only to cryptography and gaming but also so many other domains.

	j) some simple problems like prisoner's dilemma and related p2p issues can be obtained from wikipedia

	I think wikipedia will be  a good place to look for if you know what and where to look...

	Best of luck!

Subject: [Ilugc] Problem with monitor
Message-ID: <397980.53757.qm@web36814.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I had installed FC5 on my system with a monitor M1 ( Samsung SyncMaster 591s ). On this the best resolution i could get was 800x600. 1024x768 was not possible.

After that i reinstalled FC5 on my system with a monitor M2 ( HCL  HCM510LSA )
on this i could get a resolution of 1024x768. And i had kep this resolution

Now for some reason i had to switch back to monitor M1. I did not reinstall FC5. But now after the linux installation when the linux switches to gui mode i the display goes off. I think this is happening coz my resolution is set to 1024x768.
What do i need to do to correct this.

Go and edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf or the equivalent file. Remove that
resolution which causes problem for you.

PS: The file name may vary in different distros(i use ubuntu edgy, and the
filename was what i mentioned), But it would be found in /etc/X11/. The
filename may look like Xfree86conf or something similar in a few distros. In
debian based distros we would use

dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  (ubuntu)
dpkg-reconfigure xfree86-xserver  (sarge)

to make changes here.

However the content in the file would look like http://pastebin.com/853385

Yes I tried firestarter too.It works really good. but after I connect eth0
to Router ( Of course I enabled DHCP in router ) and eth1 to LAN switch,This
is not working as a gateway for my LAN.

plese refer my network interfaces.

Please refer my first mail.I think I have to enable LAN routing between two
NIC's (In windows it is called Bridges between NIC's ),then only I will make
them to communicate each other.I failed in this part.

I could not even ping either NIC's after connecting the the two NIC to
router and Switch (Of course I enable ICMP in firewall) from the LAN.

Ofcourse IPCOP geared towards home and SOHO users, It needs whole new
computer for itself.You can't use it for other purpose.I am looking for a
simple firewall to work as a secure gateway for only 15 WIN computers.

Need your advice please......

Thanks,
Sankaranarayanan,s.

Dear all,

    Prof.Srinivasan, me and Parthan conducted a two day workshop on
FOSS at Sri Ramakrishna Engg college, Coimbatore on 5th and 6th of
Jan 07. About 60-70 faculty members from about 10 colleges and about
100 students attended the workshop.

    We did the following topics
    a. Intro to FOSS
    b. Installation (debian)
    c. Basics of desktop,command line
    d. 1/2 practical session in the Lab(
        The students installed Linux in over 50 system before
        commencement of seminar without our help. An appreciable
        work.)
    e. Qt designer
    b. Basic networking stuff like ssh,ftp,nfs etc
    e. Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP)
    f. Linux High Availabiltiy with heartbeat+drbd
    g. Introduction to scripting language - perl

    The level of interest shown by them was high. I am sure we can
see good level of FOSS activity in this college in future.

     On behalf of ILUGC I thank Prof.Manoharan HOD of Computer
Science and Engg department, Lecturer Mr.Ravikumar and the management
for the conducting the workshop and giving LUG an opportunity.

Can we have one in chennai?. My company will provide the necessary

There was one last year. It seemed to turn into something that felt like
reading a few months worth of PC Quest / PC Mag etc. The presentations
were all web2, ajax, "blogging" [quote unquote deliberate there], etc.
Way too many stilted presentations rather than talk.

There's lots of people who do OFFLINE interesting things too .. wildlife
photography, animal rescue, riding bullet motorcycles in the himalayas
etc .. stuff like that belongs in a barcamp just as much as the rest of
the content, and makes it rather more interesting.

Not I have attended one, but have heard of many and it usually varies 
with respect to the place and the people.

I love one which will be aimed at 'enjoyment in doing things together'. 
We should all join together for a weekend at some place, i.e. we should 
stay together. Facilities require PCs if they don't have laptop, 
unlimited internet (or at least limited), electricity and food. We 
should have a theme/aim for the camp and should try to do as much as we 
can in the 2 or 3 day camp. And, we also should have other recreations 
for break, some games or trekking or hiking or some stuff. So its both 
productivity and enjoyment at the end.

Think, the first preference should be some place far away from city so 
that we get a good weekend break. Even it is within the city, it should 
be like we can make the place our world for two days and don't roam in 
the outside world too often.

Thyagu, it will be great if we can organize some BarCamp soon. We are 
only meeting once in a month and often many of us have to miss it. So, 
these barcamps will be great :) Hope, you finalize things soon and put 
into action.

If you have grub installed, on boot, you can
dynamically append "single" , and boot into single
user mode, which will take you as a root user. Change
the password using the passwd command.

Google around for single user mode HOWTO.

to change the root password.

Sorry Shankar, I can't be of much help here, because I evaluated
Firestarter once but never actually used it. I normally use webmin with
shorewall plugin. But it doesn't meet your criteria.

Subject: [Ilugc] internet speed issues with ubuntu
Message-ID: <7bf1bec50701080948j3bf3e9aeh51422e553ef7dbee@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Have been using Ubuntu (5.10 -> 6.06 -> 6.10 now) for more than a year now.
When downloading files from the web used to get an average speed of approx
20-30kBps on my BSNL broadband connection (home 1000 plan - 384kbps). Now
that BSNL has increased the bandwidth to 2mbps, I expected to see a marked
increase in performance. But that has not happened so far (at least on
Ubuntu)! Now, download speed is usually 10-20kBps!

First I thought it was starting trouble for BSNL. Yesterday, I tried to
download Ubuntu 6.10 using firefox (2.0) and the estimated time was 10-20
hrs!! Then I installed Prozilla (a linux download accelerator) and tried
again. This time the entire image (700MB) was downloaded in 70 mins. Average
speed was 165kBps!!! Well in the realm of BSNL's promise.

 Its not just firefox, apt-get also works at around 20kBps only! I have a
dual boot machine and switched over to windows xp to test download speeds. I
observed that on the average the speed is 70kBps - whether I use IE6 or
Firefox 2.0.

Based on the above observations...... is ubuntu to blame for this sloth? It
cannot be a problem with this distribution's linux kernel itself becasue
prozilla was able to achieve a scorching speed. Does it have to do with the
way the different packages are assembled? Any one tried BSNL's dsl with
other linux distributions and experienced the bandwidth increase? Preferably
some one with a Ubuntu and FC/Debian/Gentoo dual boot machine and tested the
speed on these!!

regards,
mano

This is strange. I have felt the same too. I have a windows pc and a
few linux pcs(all ubuntu 6.10) in my office and they have the same
symptom. I get around 100K on my windows pc but only around 25K on the
ubuntu boxes.

How many parallel threads did you run with Prozilla?

Where are you downloading from and what is the latency (as measured by
ping) to that site?

Will it be possible for you to compile this program and run on your
Ubuntu box (just save it in a.c and run: make a && ./a)?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
int main (void) {
    int sb = 0;
    size_t sz = sizeof sb;
    int s = socket (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    getsockopt(s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF, &sb, &sz);
    printf ("RCV: %d\n", sb);
    getsockopt(s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_SNDBUF, &sb, &sz);
    printf ("SND: %d\n", sb);
}

Is it possible for you to install the latest FC on one, Suse on another and
compare speeds with Ubuntu simultaneously!!

I downloaded  from a site in Japan. The speed from the same site without
prozilla was around 10-20 kBps.

Hi guys, I was part of the organising team for BarCampChennai and it was an
excellent opportunity for me. You can any questions that you may have.

My gentoo box made me cry like a girl for three days..After that
speeds returned to normal. Note that I have UL plan, so no speed
upgrades there :(..
However, when I asked the call centre, they told me that since I was
using "lie-nix" the speed was horrible. Although my guess is that, the
taiwan earthquake sometime back might have snapped some undersea cable...

But it works in Win XP and when I use Prozilla in linux!!! So the earthquake
is not the cause in this case.

BTW, after I downloaded Edgy Eft (using prozilla on Dapper Drake) and
replaced Dapper with Edgy, Prozilla would'nt compile on Edgy now :-(

   Hai All
    
   Wish you all happy new year and happy pongal.
    
   I had an opportunity to vist the workshop in science co-organised by UC
   College Alwaye.
    
   Prabhu Ramachandran, Nagarjuna and lot of speakers gave good idea of
   utilisation of Science in Foss. Great Work by all the persons involved.
    
   After coming from there I planned to install Ubuntu in my laptop. When I
   installed it it asked for username and password which I gave as rajaram
   and meera.
    
   When it restarted it is not accepting the username and password which i
   have provided. It is not allowing me to enter into the system.
    
   Can any one suggest what I have to do.
    
   Thanks in advance for your suggestion.

i suppose the password did not match the password criteria, it should be
minimum 7-8 character and alpha-numeric, pls try to install once
again and set the password, matching the criteria..

This does not make sense.. If it had a problem with password, it would have
mentioned in the install screen itself.. More likely, you typed the password
wrong...

More interesting news:

I loaded a live CD of Ubuntu 5.04 in my machine and tried downloading Edgy
from http://ftp.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/  (the same site I mentioned in an earlier
mail). The download started at 800KBps (6.4Mbps!!!) and in a blink more than
an MB was in! It tapered off and hovered around 60KBps. The lowest was
40KBps. I stopped after about 10 MB was in.

Logged out and restarted my machine in Win XP. Once again the same file from
the same site but firefox 2.0. Started at around 100KBps but tapered off to
an average of 55KBps. Lowest was 36KBps. Again only 10MB - am on a limited
bandwidth plan :-)

Restarted my machine in Edgy and the same download. Started at 40KBps and
tapered off to a staid 20KBps. At times it was even as low as 2KBps. ANd it
is not just Edgy... Dapper is slow too. I upgraded to Edgy hoping to see
better performance!

AM really considering moving to 5.10. Used to have that long back and never
had any issues with it. In 5.04 my machines touchpad does'nt work out of the
box.

If this issue is not resolved soon a lot of people are going to get
disenchanted with linux. Especially considering the proliferation of Ubuntu
CDs in our country.

ANother point I noticed: The network Icon on the panel keeps showing the
'Network Disconnected' icon every few seconds in Edgy (also Dapper). Did not
check that in 5.04. Also am using a USB NIC adapter (built in NIC conked) so
it could be an issue specific to me!

If others face similar issues please inform.

+1
In  Ubuntu Edgy and SUSE 10.1 that i have, the same issues prevail.. Mozilla
and apt-get dont give high speeds, whereas d4x even when i dont split the
file, gives me 180-220KBps consistently, whereas firefox gives me only
around 20KBps as opposed to the 28-30 that I was getting before the speed
upgrade. I believed that it is a problem with BSNL, as I dont have any
windows, and didnt observe what you did.

Well, with that RTT, the theoretic throughput you should see is:

throughput = buffer size / RTT
= (87380 / 1024) / (418 / 1000) = 204 KB/sec

So what Prozilla got is fine. It had to use multiple threads to fill
up your bandwidth, of course. I imagine Prozilla sets the buffer size
to 64 KB.

Of course, a single thread cannot fill up your pipe (since you are
quite far away from the server). In practice, a single-threaded
downloader's performance will go down as you go further and further
away from the server (as measured by RTT). The only way to counter
this is to increase the number of threads (until your pipe fills up,
of course). I think firefox has a few very aggressive download
managers that can tune your TCP parameters to get similar speeds as
prozilla.

Nonsense. Don't talk about things you know nothing about. The C
standard -mandates- that the sizeof operator return an object of type
size_t.

Greetings!

This is an 'Area 44' [1] wiki page initiative at:

http://chennailug.org/wiki/?title=Area_44

This lists the FLOSS members present in an area. It is
quite difficult to commute in metropolitan cities like
Chennai, especially during peak hour traffic. So, it
will be useful to have area-wise meetups, when needed.
This is useful in many ways:

* organizing advocacy events in an area to which you
belong.
* approaching schools/colleges/institutions in your
area of residence.
* distribution of pamphlets.
* working with the people of your locality. Helping
with installation, for example.

Competition amongst different areas will improve
awareness, and will help in our advocacy, and FLOSS
work.

So, please provide your contact info in the link. If
you do not wish to give your mobile/contact number,
that is ok.

Your suggestions welcome.

SK

[1] Nothing to do with Area 51. Chennai dialing code
is 44.

While installing, when u had typed the user name and password your CAPS LOCK
might have been in ON state. You might not noticed that and continued the
installation... It happens... so the user name might have got stored as
RAJARAM and password as MEERA.. Just toggle around and try.. It should
work... :-)

Message-ID: <20070109123215.5819.qmail@web36808.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

for Guys who have used glade-3....
   
  I add a "Window" to my application. Now selecting this window in the property editor, I change the "Window Title" to say "Welcome".
  But even then, the title of the windows stays "Glade-3".
   
  Has anyone of u faced this problem ( or do i have a bad installation ).If yes, then how did u overcome this ?

Oops! Binand, you are wrong. Check the man page of setsockopt(2).

Best of luck!

Oops! This reasoning is absolute rubbish.

TCP gives more throughput if you use more connections but this has nothing whatsoever to do with threads. Look at the implementation of axel download manager to figure out how it uses multiple TCP connections in a single thread to achieve high throughput.

But usually the UNIX world shies away from this approach of opening multiple connections since it is against the philosophy of being a "good citizen."

Anyway TCP has no upper limit on how much throughput a single connection can give. It does have problems with LFNs and wireless networks but definitely those things do not apply here.

So here without resorting to any complications one should obtain the best throughput with a single TCP connection in a single threaded single process.

Please check your facts. :)

I am pretty sure Binand is right there... sizeof has to return a size_t.

Theoretically, the end throughput could depend on whether the
application is singly or multiply threaded, if the bottleneck happens
to be end host processing rather than the network. In that case, data
from the net needs to wait while the existing data is processing (say
written to disk). Such issues become important especially in LAN's.
For example, microdc, a command line direct connect client happens to
be much faster than others on the IITM lan because of its highly
threaded design. (Well... at the expense of other apps in the system,
I am not getting into issues of multithreading really being effective
only if there are multiple processors and stuff like that...)

it moves on...

Anyway, I was under the impression that Binand referred to multiple
connections when he meant multiple threads... This is a terminology
used sometimes in the context of download managers and stuff like
that.. I guess "simultaeneous connections per download" is too big :)

it moves on...

I tested this program on OpenBSD and it gave me warnings. That is why I said that. 

You try running this code on OpenBSD. If it compiles fine I will accept. 

I just checked the man page on linux. It also proves that I am right.

Anyway I don't like to argue. :)

Ramkumar,

	In general if you wish to enter a controversy :), one should be really careful. Also while taking sides...

	The linux man page clearly says that you should use socklen_t.

	Moreover I most of the time talk from experience and real anecdotal evidence.

	I did compile this program and fixed the errors/warnings. Hence I mailed for the benefit of everyone.

	Let us not waste time arguing when you can easily experiment yourself and find the truth.

	There are times when I just let go even when I am right but sometimes I don't catch myself.

	Have fun!

Well, of course there is a prototype mismatch for getsockopt(), but
the fix you suggested is plain wrong and only shows your ignorance of
C.

I think you do, especially about things you hardly have a clue.

Indeed, I intended "thread" as "parallel TCP connections", and not in
the pthread way.

There are several variables that does affect the throughput of a
single connection. Latency, pipe size, buffer sizes, MSS, PMTU etc. to
name a few.

Does anyone know how to tell Thunderbird that all 2^3 are NOT
two-to-the-power-of-three? It insists on making the 3 a superscript
and dropping the carat altogether. Really annoying when the author's
intention is to show the XOR operator.

I am actually getting quite bugged with Thunderbird (I have been using
it as a newsreader, giving slrn a rest). It I have a message open in
the reading pane and I mark another message as spam, it jumps to the
next message for no good reason :(

I'm using thunderbird and I dont see that behavior at all. Is this a
plugin of some sort you're using?

I've started using TB a few says back, I was just wondering if there's 
any extension that will make gmail mark mails that TB downloads as "read"
I both use TB and the gmail interface and I'd really like something like 
that. Also note that, i don't want the mails archived, i want them to be 
marked read but remain in my inbox

This is a general reply to all those who want to ask questions similar 
as above.

1. There is no need to formally ask any one to attend the LUG meetings 
or any of the LUG organized, supported or participated events. Just walk 
in and you are one among us.

2. There is no formal procedure that defines any one to be a member of 
ILUG-Chennai. Perhaps you need not be in this mailing list too, to 
participate in any of our activities. You are most welcomed if you can 
make a physical presentation for monthly meets, LDDs or any LUG activity.

3. You can  very well bring new people who are yet to know about FOSS, 
so they get to see how good the community is.

4. This is a general direction to arrive at the venue of ILUGC Meets

* Those who come by vehicle, drive into the main gate, tell the security 
that you are going to 'ESB - Electronic Science Block', proceed straight 
- the road forks into two, take either of them and at the end you will 
reach the Gajendra Circle which has an elephant statue. Still proceed 
further, you will cross the library and the Open Air Theater (OAT), as 
you move forward you will find a right forking. Take this right and then 
you cross the first building to the right... then you will again see the 
road cutting on the right and a lot of cycles/bikes parked under tree 
shade. There you can find CSD. You will surely find some one standing 
there :)
* Those coming by IIT Bus, come till either Gajendra circle and follow 
the above directions.

Thank you,

Parthan

correct observation, wrong proof.. could you please elucidate why a
man page or some function declaration *proves* that sizeof returns
size_t? i could have accepted had you quoted the the c89/c99 spec....

it's ok as long as it's constructive.. at the end of it, one of us
gets to clear a misconception :)

No. I was just countering your claim that multithreading (in the sense
of OS threads) has *absolutely* no impact on the throughput.

> Multi threading is wrong. Period. :)

Uh? You mean multi-threading as an design alternative for download
managers is wrong? If so, we are entering a bigger controversy I fear
:) I just gave you one use case... Design decisions are seldom
"wrong"... each has its tradeoff properties...

Hi!

refer previous mail.

Its great that we have experienced people in ILUGC capable of putting
enthusiasm and carry out meaningful discussions. Seriously, I am happy
about that. But what matters in such an objective argument is proof,
and unfortunately experience doesn't count in such cases :)

>         I did compile this program and fixed the errors/warnings. Hence I mailed for the benefit of everyone.

The fact that a fix fixes an error/warning doesn't mean that you have
done the right thing. In this case, the alternative could have been to
convert the variable (by casting, say) when passing it to the network
api...

I really appreciate the fact that you took the pains to fix the
warning... something I didnt do... but I still think that sizeof
returns a size_t :)

it moves on...

 Tried DownThemAll, a mozilla addon and it accelerated
dowloads a bit (from 30kbps to 40kbps, maximum
speeds).
Maybe not related to where the thread currently is ;)

Message-ID: <e3dcb5360701101042i6d5634fbjc05045d4ff3f9ae0@mail.gmail.com>

Vanakkam,

The technical capabilities of many Tamil speaking common men do not
get recognized simply because of non-availability of a platform where
they get an opportunity to share their knowledge in their own
language...

The prevailing scenario that to express/ exhibit one's technical
capabilities, he/ she should be aware of a particular language ought
to be changed...

Keeping in mind these aspects Ubuntu Tamil team would like to organize
weekly meet ups wherein people get a chance to express their technical
skills in their mother tongue, Tamil.

These sessions will not be confined to Ubuntu but will be open to all
or any thing related to free softwares...Any one can take a session in
a topic which he/ she likes...

We plan to begin this on a small scale in T Nagar and expand it
further depending on the response we get...We beleive initiatives like
Suzhi, Localisation etc., would get more shape and structure with
these events...

Awaiting feedbacks on this initiative..

Hi all,

I have a iso file 712MB but could not write it to an empty CD (700MB/80min).
I have  tried passing the options '-mode2'  and '-overburn' to 'cdrecord' but in vain.

any suggestions ? 

regards,
KM

K3b is just a frontend to cdrecord. I've had the same problem with
the k3b on debian sarge. How do you overburn with k3b? Some
setting?

I too suspect when I had 702MB ISO, but burnt it successfully with Gnome 
Baker, with default options. I don't know command line arguments

hi,

Compress it. If it's already compressed run another
compression algorithm over it. You will usually get
2-3% reduction in file size on the compressed file,
when you do a re-compression on it(with a different
compression algorithm). Try out a few compression
algorithms and see which works.

Note: Sometimes, you will get a larger file size on
re-compression. If that is the case try out other
compression algorithms.

You can also use a file splitter, if it's an
acceptable solution. :-)

Sarad.

Imation has 800mb/90min cds..Searching around our "reliable" ritchie
street might help.
Setting for overburning in k3b is available in Configure k3b ->
Writing -> Advanced Tab.
Not sure how successful this is though..fried a cd once, but the size
was around 750 megs. Should work for sizes of around 710 megs

Hi Sridhar,
Nice to see you mailing to the chennai lug list and welcome :)
The following are some tips and suggestions..

1. Check the mails in ILUG-Chennai and get to know how people ask their 
questions and post their answers.
2. When you are replying to a digest mail, please edit the subject line 
so as to suit your question appropriately. Your mail could have a 
subject line like "help in formatting windows XP"
3. Have you done a dual install of Win XP and Ubuntu ? If so, what 
problem do you have now, if any ?
4. What do you mean by formatting of Windows XP ? You mean resizing of 
any of your partitions or completely removing Windows XP ?

Please answer the above questions. Always provide relevant information 
and clearly tell what you want to do, while asking for some help.

Replying to a digest mail is a strict no-no. It completely screws up
threading. Digest list is for read-only subscription.

If we cannot have the digest list dropped altogether, then at least we
should change the options so that digest subscribers cannot post to
the list.

I thought when you change the subject line of a digest mail, it becomes 
a new thread !? :D

Can we have a filter which just doesn't post any reply to the digest 
mail, like filter for subject line having "Re: ilugc Digest, ".

Threading based on subject line alone is for wannabe mail clients like
Outlook. Real threaded clients (mutt etc.) thread based on the

Dear friend,
Those who seek help have to take pains to get it from where ever it is 
available. So,

1. Please go through the CDs4Grab in Chennai LUG wiki and make a call to 
any one you find having the required Distro.
2. You expect the other people to come over and do service ? Then, find 
any of the professional Linux support in the town, who will come to your 
home and offer professional service.
3. If you need help from us, check out where you can meet the person who 
offers to help you - as you have a laptop you can carry it to the place 
of the one who wishes to help you. If the person is kind enough to come 
over your place and help you, you should be thankful enough to him

:)

In GNOME go to  Desktop->Preferences->Keyboard, click on the layout tab add
malayalam/tamil
This will configure the inscript keyboard layout (common for all indian
languages). You will have to learn the keyboard layout before you can start
using it
http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/InputMethod/indiclayout.htmllists
the layouts for many indian languages including malayalam and tamil.

Message-ID: <78c38cc30701110448i5abb4482kf5bc2246973fe41c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Luggies,

I am working in a project where in we run RHEL 4 for all the servers in our
apps server pool. Our application will assign an IP address which will be
assigned to any one of the servers' virtual interface (like eth0:0) in the
server pool dynamically, my requirement is to find the actual ipaddress(of
eth0) or host name of the of the server to which this floating IP is
assigned, all that information I will have with me is the floating IP
address.

Right now I use SSH command to connect to that floating IP and run
'hostname' and get the hostname. But is it possible to know this information
without logging in to the server, if not... are there any good SSH libraries
for windows?

Hi All,

We have written an CGI Program in C + libpq. In that, whenever a req
is received, we will do,

1. Connect to PgSQL
2. Exec the Query
3. Return the result

This above steps takes nearly 8ms. 4ms to Connect to PgSQL and 4ms for
other steps. We like to avoid doing the 1st step every time, by
keeping the PgSQL connection alive. Any tips to do this?

Apache v2.0
PgSQL v7.4.6

Bye :)

   I use Fedora Core 5.

I am unable to get a resolution of 1024x768.
My Monitor is shown as "Unknown Monitor".

I tried editing the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file to set a resolution of 1024x768. But If I do that then the monitor loses signal as soon as GUI mode is entered.

1024x768 works well on my Windows XP installation.

Any suggestions ?

It is sure that u have a "lap top". then u can choose the other way. U can
reach any one near ur location and get things done. Mid of the week this is,
the better suggestion.

Which Dell Lap top u have? Both fedora 6 and Ubuntu fits in mine...

I am in T Nagar, though...

Well i use a python variant for such stuff - have psycopg2 python module installed.

import psycopg2
conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=mydb user=bla ...")
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute('SELECT .....;')
<as before .. do several SQL query executions using cursor (cur) as before>
conn.commit()
conn.close()

First off, try running callgrind to figure out where is the time spent. 
  Check whether the connection tries to use SSL (yes, even for local) or 
something, if yes, disable it.

You can try storing the connection handler, and doing a ping every time 
to use persistent connections, but it would be too complex in doing it.

You can try SQLRelay [sqlrelay.sourceforge.net], or, I just found this 
out through search -- mod_libpq [asmith.id.au/mod_libpq.html].

I already saw this. I am trying for a solution, which may not

In addition to changing the resolution in xorg, you have to change the
VertRefresh  and HorizSync also. See this link:

Its for Ubuntu, but I guess xorg.conf properties are same across distros

On similar lines, My final year projects is on an Intel IXP425 Processor 
http://www.intel.com/design/network/products/npfamily/ixp425.htm
It's and ARM based processor and I'd like to know if the same emulator 
can be used. Also I'm running a Snapgear Linux Distro and would like to 
know if that is the only good distro out there or are there any other 
good Distros.
I want support for SCSI, USB and should be able to run Samba/NFS on it.

Any help would be greatly welcome.

There are very nice emulators out there, especially, for the arm
platform - ranging from
one to run the application to a full system emulator:
http://vijairaj.blogspot.com/2006/11/arm-emulators.html

If you are going to use only the standard C libraries then it
shouldn't make any difference running on any architecture.

Well i see very few people writing CGI in C. I dont think if u are aware of Perl CGI programing u would consider CGI in C.

Mainly coz of the flexibility of other languages in writing such code, like Perl which became famous as PerlCGI. I dont think there is much difference when u execute the actual CGI code with C or Perl. There is no need to tell abt perl regular expressions which are widely used to tweak the results from DB. I really think u should EXPLAIN ANALYZE ur queries to get the best response in PostgreSQL. That is also a factor.

The python module psycopg2 which i mentioned earlier is a C extension module in Python for PostgreSQL.

But if u want max speed minimising ur CGI application overheads, u must fallback on FastCGI or mod_perl or mod_python all of which use persistence principle.

Dear friends: would appreciate help for the following query from Ms.

Thanks, Srinivasan.
--------------------------------------------------
Dear Sir,
I am Ms Udaya Abraham doing final year Msc Bioinformatics in Stella
Maris College. Currently, i am doing a project related to construction
of phylogenetic tree.

I have successfully installed bioperl in linux and i also did couple
of programs .But when i did a particular program for retrieving
sequence from swissprot database, by giving the corresponding
accession number in my program(given below), its showing an error
saying cannot connect to database.
use Bio::Perl;
$seq_object = get_sequence ('swiss',"LCN10_HUMAN");
write_sequence (">lcn10.fasta",'fasta',$seq_object);

Iam not sure whether i have installed it in the correct manner or else
i would not have got this error , controrary, i was able to do couple
of programs. kindly help.

I have the bellow setup

                                                   Host A

                                                 192.168.0.2

                                                       |

                                                Broad band connection

Routing on GW

192.168.0.0 on eth0

202.x.x.x   on eth1

default gw  202.1.1.1



Routing on host A

192.168.0.5 gw 192.168.0.1





Routing on host B

default gw 192.168.0.1





Explanation

The GW pc has tow interface eth0 and eth1 eth0 is connected to the local
network with separate

Switch this switch has Host A. The eth1 interface also connected to a
separate switch, this switch has Host B and a Broadband router





The problem I am facing is the traffic between host A and B is not happening

In the Gw PC, I have IP table based forwarding rules and a static host
routing for 192.168.0.5

route add -host 192.168.0.5 eth1.



My observation is the both the HOST ips in the same network but it is
connect to different physical interface, when the host A wants to talk to
Host B, it sends a ARP

Request to eth0, but it need to send to eth1 too. Any pointers? Any help on
this?



If I do a proxy Arp on gateway's eth1 I was not able to assign any IP on
eth1 network!!



PS:  I am not able to ping from GW to Host B even with out firewall

How did you end up with such a goofy network? Just move your host B
from the "public network switch" to the "local switch".

If that is not possible, use a different subnet on host B and add an
interface alias to your GW machine on eth1.

Hi,

 I do agree this is a goofy network :). But i'm force to choose to do that.
Let me give some back ground of the problem



The network  eternal switch has to Broadband router one is for Internet and
other is for VPN. The Host B is not really  sitting on the switch, it is
connected to a Broadband VPN router and it is connected on the VPN's other
side, When I connect the  Broadband router to the local switch , it started
dropping the packet due to heavy traffic on the local network switch



Regards,

Johnson

It may sound a bit silly, but just a small doubt - get_sequence() and 
write_sequence() are both defined methods, right ?

When we call function, should it be function(arg1) or is this allowed - 
function (arg1), i.e. a space between function_name and the braces ( ) ?

If am right it should be,

 > use Bio::Perl;
 > $seq_object = get_sequence('swiss',"LCN10_HUMAN");
 > write_sequence(">lcn10.fasta",'fasta',$seq_object);

Has Uday made a syntax error or is it right that way too (may be it went 
wrong when she copied/typed it in mail's text area ?)

If you want to uninstall linux use any partitioning  tools in windows to
format it,
AKAIK, There is no option in any OS is uninstall itself.

Message-ID: <adc51dea0701120935n1f16b7a6t29a643bc9b2bb1ff@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Friends,

The Ubuntu-India team is delighted to announce that we have got a
shipment of the Ubuntu 6.10 Edgy Eft CDs. We are willing to share this
with the LUGs around us and have created a Wiki page with respect to
this. You can include your requirements there.

What we have in hand are Ubuntu Edgy Desktop CDs (and its variants
Kubuntu and Edubuntu for both 32 bit and 64 bit architectures), which
are Live CDs with a GUI installer along with it. If you need to
install on computers with less than 192 MB of RAM or need to upgrade
from an earlier version of Ubuntu, 6.06 LTS ``Dapper Drake'', then we
suggest you to download the `Alternate CD' from the Ubuntu Mirror
sites.

The Wiki link is below

http://www.ubuntu-in.org/wiki/EdgyCdRequests

We will try our best to meet your requirements depending upon the
overall requests from other LUGs as well.

Thanking You,
 Ubuntu-India Team

hello all,

Getting closer...swamped with stuff to do to prepare....a few quick questions

maid service - someone mentioned to me that it may be a good idea to
go through a maid service/agency at first...does anyone know of one
that services the manapakkam area?

I want to get as much done as possible during the 2 weeks before my
family arrives...so, I would like to do as much online, or at least
prepare documents etc. before I go (feb. 13th)

items i plan to do

gas setup - what do i need for this, how do i find who services manapakkam?

broadband - bnsl sounds like the way to go based on your discussions i
have seen...recommendations on plans?...they appear to be handled
differently than in u.s
how long to setup? can it be done remotely, even part of it?

water filter - there is a aquagaurd in my flat that needs
servicing...anyone recommend a company to use?

setup banking - anyone know about what foreigners should do for this

i also plan to buy - a frig., a/c, and basic kitchen items and
furniture...i was told T.nagar would be the place to go (near
manapakkam)...do many places take credit cards? i would prefer not to
carry much cash

any advice is welcome...i likely don't know the right questions to ask

thanks again!

You must configure the boot loader (such as GRUB) installed by the
second installed distribution to have an entry for the previously
installed distribution.

This seems to be a good example:

I haven't heard of any, this is usually arranged by word of mouth.

> gas setup - what do i need for this, how do i find who services manapakkam?

Bookmark http://yellowpages.sulekha.com/ - there are several dealers
that you can go to. Remember that they all will require an ID and
address proof (which you can get from your employer, some standard
blurb like "so-and-so works for us and his residential address as per
our records is this", your HR chap should have a template).

Again, several operators. Not all of them cover all parts of Chennai.
BSNL is probably your best bet, but also look at Tata Indicom and
Airtel Broadband and others. Your local cable TV operator would have a
cable Internet plan too.

> how long to setup? can it be done remotely, even part of it?

Nothing will be done over Internet/email, probably :) But most of
these can be done within 1-2 working days.

> water filter - there is a aquagaurd in my flat that needs
> servicing...anyone recommend a company to use?

Eureka Forbes - makers of Aquaguard - handle their support themselves.
Just give them a call on their freephone number and someone will turn
up at your place within a day.

> setup banking - anyone know about what foreigners should do for this

Now, this is quite different from what you see elsewhere. You are
typically required to open an account with the same bank where your
employer maintains their corporate accounts - your so-called salary
account (staff from the bank will turn up at your office to facilitate
this). This gives you the benefit that you needn't maintain any
minimum balance, and that your salary will be credited automatically
on the day it is disbursed. All banks provide you with free cheque
books (sometimes capped at 50-100 free cheques per year), an ATM/Debit
card and unlimited transfers/withdrawals etc. for zero fees (except
about Rs. 100 or so annually for the card), Internet banking, email
statements, a credit card etc. so you needn't worry too much about
this.

As far as reach is concerned, SBI and ICICI Bank seem to be competing
with each other in having cash machines every other block or so.
Citibank compensates by allowing you charges-free access to other
banks' ATMs.

Don't worry. We are now quite advanced, thank you very much. You'll
find several consumer/household goods store all over the place, with
dealerships of several big brandnames (Whirlpool, LG, Godrej,
Samsung....). Insist on a dealer-stamped receipt and warranty document
so as to be on the safe side.

> any advice is welcome...i likely don't know the right questions to ask

What is called a checking account elsewhere is called a savings
account in India. What is known as a savings account elsewhere is a
current account in India.

You will most certainly need the residence proof to get almost all
services. Arrange for that document (several copies) first and you
should be just fine.

I don't remember who your employer is (or you haven't mentioned it
yet), but most of them will have company-wide health insurance and
several other benefits.

There are several websites (all the companies I mention above have
quite detailed websites, google for them) with generic and specific
information about moving/relocating to India.

welcome to the group - it is a rule that you should put a  
[commercial] tag on posts like this. nrcfoss is looking for

Message-ID: <895952550701121917j694ae3b9h7fc1274a99320e22@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need some help/suggestions on how to improve the performance of an
application.
Any suggestions, links etc., will be most helpful.

This is a C++ application. It reads input data over a socket, processes it
and writes output to files (pcaps).
I know this is not much info, but this is the crux of it, the simple bare
bones version.

It works fine;
The problem is, it is currently taking input at about 20mbps of data per
sec; but the clients on their testing want this to be about 80.
This is because my appln is the last in the line. It is slowing down the
upstream components.
So i need to identify bottlenecks etc.,

How helpful will gprof be in providing quick info?
I tried to use this once with my app, but the huge amt of info made life
difficult.

The appln will probably run on multiproc servers(At least at the client). So
is there a way to use this feature without too much redesigning?
I do not know much about programming with multiple processors in mind.

Thanks
hari

dont take the unlimited. Take a transfer capped connection - 2 to 3 gig
cap should do just fine if you're not doing p2p etc all the time

about a week tops - if they have service in your area

Or you could just get a datacard from reliance / airtel / hutch (gsm
EDGE / cdma based pcmcia card, gives you rather better than dialup speed
but not exactly DSL .. should be more than enough for home use if you go
to work someplace and use the net at home on weekends etc)

Aquaguard is a nationwide filter company .. and they have service
contracts, guarantee period, etc.  Your landlord should be able to tell
you about it

> setup banking - anyone know about what foreigners should do for this

Citibank, HSBC etc are just fine.  Once you get your residency / work
permit take it with your previous bank's statements, etc, to any of
these banks, and open up an account. These have far fewer ATMs though so
you might get hit with 25 INR (50 cents) service charges if you use your
citibank card in another bank's ATMs.  Should be ok.

Just about everywhere .. and especially all appliance stores - take
cards, and also have "easy finance" options that let you take a loan to
buy those [i wouldnt recommend those loans].

Dont worry, you'll find that credit cards are way too popular here (in
fact if you dont get phone sales people spamming you with offers for
free platinum no limit credit cards within a week of your setting up
here and buying all that stuff, I'll eat my hat)

This happened to me when I installed Fedora as the second distribution.
First was Ubuntu. I also had windows XP. Fedora core gave me options to
choose Fedora and Win XP and excluded Ubuntu.

But installing Ubuntu (as the second distro) din't create this problem.
It gave all options, Ubuntu, Fedora and Win XP on startup...

If Fedora or Something else is the second distro u had installed try
editing the config file in /boot/grub directory to suit your needs...

If you are using intel based machine to run your aplication then use Intel
compiler
for performace tuning instead of GCC.

Intel compiler has advanced optimization options that you can use.
Just google for intel compiler . I have seen number of examples for
compiling like mysql.

u have to give root properly ... and before making changes to files .. I
suggest that u try these commands (obviously setting correct root ) at
command prompt ... and then write in grub.conf ... If it boots fine with
command prompt .. then u can proceeed with grub.conf ... try this at grub
prompt

$ geometry (hd0)   (or appropriate number dependin if u have multiple locla
disks )

this will give partitions n then u choose the boot partition of both the
Linux distros .. and make that root ... and yehh notice that ..., root in
kernel line and in root(hdx) is different ...

if any problem .. post back
:)

        Can you provide some more details? Is there an error message?
 please start firefox under script, and then send me the typescript
 file produced off list. (I don't use scim, but I might be able to
 find out if this is a known issue, and if there are workarounds).

  Fortress, a language for high performance computing

license(BSD).
http://fortress.sunsource.net/

I had seen this language sometime back, but it was
closed source at that time. Looks like Sun is going
the open source way...

Can only be done on arrival as address proof is needed. Normally takes 
15 days. Recommend Home UL plan for BB @900 over voice plan.

This again requires address proof. However, private banks can setup a/cs 
in 3/4 days. They will come to your doorstep and complete formalities.

credit cards are generally/commonly accepted. Better to shop in one 
place where you can get all. Good places are Big Bazaar, Viveks etc. 
Believe we have a Big Bazaar now in Vadapalani near Bharani Hospital. 
Big Bazaar is generally cheaper in price than most others.

Subject: [Ilugc] Mailserver on dynamic IP
Message-ID: <b2600ec40701131030s5fb8c3fcm3f91ec61ede32508@mail.gmail.com>

hi all ,
I have been trying to run a mail server on dynamic IP.
yeah I know the first comments I have got so far are , "never run mail
servers on dynamic ip"
But no one runs mail servers on dynamic IP for "mails" .
I just do it for testing .

Now i use afraid.org  something like dyndns  , which gives a A record
for the dynamic Ip to the host name.there is a script running in my
system that updates the dns everytime my computer's ip changes.And
there is a MX entry that points to my host name ofcourse with priority
1 .

After setting it up , It was quite a displeasure to learn that airtel
blocks incoming on port 25 to avoid spam , but you know that I can
still spam if I want to cause I have outgoing open on port 25.

Anyway my question is this :
As i was discussing a issue with cyrus imapd on irc ,  there were few
people who said that running  a mail server on dynamic IP was
ethically wrong.

so i want to know
when running a mailserver on dynamic IP

1.if there is a chance that the ip i use gets blacklisted for the next
 guy using it (Actually it wouldn't matter , if it gets blacklisted
for running mail server on dynamic ip , then he wont be able to run a
mail server as long as he has that ip , so it really only stops him
from doing what made the ip get blacklisted at the first place.......
but i just want to know.)

2.If there is anything ethically wrong in doing so ?

thanks for the big bazzar advice...i like the idea of going one place,
having the prices marked and getting it done...will they offer some
delivery options?...what things are normally taken as proof of
address? ...a letter from employer was mentioned ...that seems like a
good route for me as i can do that ahead of time...need to be on any
certain paper or will just letter head work? (asking because I came
across that with the visa paper work)...someone also mentioned
bringing a bunch of passport size photos...are they picky about these
or can i take similar one myself and print?....are there any other
items that will ease the process...thanks so much for all the help...i
look forward to meeting you guys

Hmm., if your mail client is able to explode the digest message

In many cases., a application written using a 'apache extension'
module such as mod_python/mod_perl should work faster than
CGI.

I had made my  /etc/modules to contain http://pastebin.ca/316016 Initially
it had only "lp"-the first module name in the file. All other were added by
me manually.
And the corresponding lsmod output is http://pastebin.ca/316018

If you want to take full advantage of the multiprocesor systems then your
application should be multithreaded. Converting a single threaded software
to multi threaded has its own complexities and can turm out to be a night
mare, if concurrent accessing is not taken care off.
If you can convert your application into a multi-threaded one or if it is
already a multi-threaded one then i would suggest the following tools:
1. Intel Compiler (ICC)
2. Intel thread checker that detect syncronization problems with threads and
finally
3. Intel thread profiler. This is a profile for threads and is quite helpful
if you want to see the amount of time the thread is spending in the locks
(critical region).

Moreover since you application is based on socket, try optimising the
sockets.
1. Use a large receive and transmit buffer size (use socketopts for this).
2. Try different ways such as (poll, select, non-blocking etc). Each has
their own limitations and advantages. Refer to the book. Unix Network
Programming . volume 1 by R. Stevens.

Moreover using VTUNE (Intel Profiler) gives you details about where your
application is spending more time (called as hotspots). I think gprof can do
this as well.

You can also do a bit of tuning in the NIC driver. If your packet sizes are
huge you can switch on jumbo frame support. This also works out to be good.

Finally what is the type of your network card. Check if your NIC driver
supports NAPI instead of interrupts. Using NAPI can have lots of advantage
and reduces the load on the processor at high data rates.

Try the above and let me know about it.

Since, your USB bluetooth device is working, usbcore,
ehci_hcd are functional.

What USB device are you using, some Taiwanese make?

I'd suggest trying another USB mass storage device to
test the usb_stroage, scsi_mod, sd_mod modules.

Your current USB device fails at initial USB
enumeration phase.

Message-ID: <336038.10437.qm@web36812.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello everyone.

My college provides an internet connection. They have Cyberoam installed on their server ( which is an internet management software for networks )

So we have to first login using the cyberoam corporate client and only then we can access the internet.

The problem is I don't think they have a client for linux. So If anyone among you have it then it would be great, if you could mail it to me at eamitdey@yahoo.com

Here's the name of the Linux client file
CyberoamLinuxClient.tar.gz

Thanks a lot

        They are probably doing it to prevent a mistake on your part
 into turning your MTA into an open relay, since that would get
 the whole ISP into some of the DNSBL lists, and thus impact all their
 customers.

        What you might end up doing is getting your ISP blacklisted,
 which would mean that no one would read your mail :)

        Secondly, all kinds of DNSBL's already blacklist mails coming
 from dynamic addresses, so your mail has fewer chances of
 making it through anyway.

> 2.If there is anything ethically wrong in doing so ?

        Whose ethos? I think it is unwise, since the downside can
 impact everyone using your ISP, but questions of ethics are tied into
 belief systems, and your belief system is unlikely to resemble mine.

Use libcurl to directly send a POST request to the page that accepts the
login form with userid/password set appropriately and then start the
browser with the resulting page.

I carry my ADSL/wifi router wherever I go, haven't yet encountered a
provider where it had problems. The local ISPs will give you a USB
one, so if you need the flexibility of wifi, then by all means bring
your own. Don't expect much support, though.

You can also check by this way.... it works for me in Debian

1. make a directory in /mnt , let`s called it "TestDrive"
2. mount your windows parition by this way.... , let`s assume that your
first partion of Windows is in hda1, so...

              mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/TestDrive/

You will get your all Windows stuff in /mnt/TestDrive/ directory

3. when you need to unmount... the command is...

             umount /dev/hda1

Enjoy linux!

The usual reason for port 25 filtering is not open relays, I dont believe I
see too many of those these days as more and more mailservers ship in a
default closed state (unlike a few years ago when sendmail that was
configured using linuxconf, or SMIT on Aix, or the default sunos 5.6
sendmail 8.6 version etc were all default open)

It is that there's going to be far more virus infected hosts than actual
mailservers on such IP ranges.  And these send a lot of spam + virus
payloads out.  So, ISP best current practices documents like the one at
MAAWG (http://www.maawg.org) specify port 25 blocking as a good thing to
do, and several ISPs do it as well.

Of course a virus infected PC can do a lot of other assorted nastiness
(ddos, hosting or dns for porn and malware, id theft of anything at all
such as a bank or email password used on that pc) so there are other
conditions to keep in mind, and port 25 filtering is not a cureall. Read
this - http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~joe/port25.pdf

>> 1.if there is a chance that the ip i use gets blacklisted for the

My dear chap - its not just your IP. When most ISPs (including the one I
manage spam filtering for) see dynamic IP pools, we see how big that pool
extends (just the /24?  or larger like a /18 or a /16 even?) and block
those.  AOL has two /10s and a /12 .. that's the largest single set of
dialup pools I've seen, and AOL publishes those IP ranges on their website,
actively encouraging people to block those.  [note: a /24 is 256 IPs, and a
/12 is 15 /16s, that is 15 x 256 /24s, 15 x 256 x 256 IPs]

>> 2.If there is anything ethically wrong in doing so ?

Its a dead horse. And it is standard industry practice.

I thought the dynamic IP or not battles died out ages and ages back .. oh
well, live and learn

You want to send out email with a mailserver on a dynamic IP, see
http://www.hserus.net/wiki/index.php/Pop_smtp - has howtos for sendmail,
exim, postfix and qmail

And if there's a port 25 filter around, either direct email through your
ISP's smtp server, or if you have access to another smarthost server using
smtp auth, use that on port 587 (the smtp submission port)

Alternative - if you have a shell account somewhere else then you can set
up a ssh tunnel so that smtp on that server is mapped to port 2525 on your
desktop, send your email through port 2525 localhost

ssh -2 -C -L 2525:your.shell.server:25 you@your.shell.server

Or in putty on windows there's the "tunnels" tab in the connection setup

pegasus mail on windows

most mailing lists that are sent as a MIME digest retain a bare minimum of
headers (in-reply-to, references, from, to, date, subject) in the digest
mail

This doesnt cover old style undigested mail that you have to use procmail
to split into individual emails .. but most if not all listservers offer
MIME digests these days, so ..

In fact mailman's default config sends MIME digests ..

a lot of download servers allow you to resume a download from where you
left off. you can use download managers like kget or prozilla in linux to
schedule your downloads

Try sending email to (say) a rediffmail address. If it DOES get through,
let me know (offlist) what IP you're on ..

If you are using wget, try
nohup wget (...) &

wget will continue running after you log out.

Although I frequently use VNC to achieve what you want, usually if I
want to use P2P graphical downloaders.

I hope this was what you wanted :)

Please see what the OP actually asked for before replying. Check below, 
he said he is able to mount all partitions *except* the one which he 
feels has bad sectors. Now, look again at your solution (??).

Hi all,

I noticed this yesterday when using Konqueror from my Kubuntu..

Please have a look at
http://ubuntu-tam.org/tamil_ubuntu_wiki/index.php/????????????_????????????

(Please copy paste the above link if clicking on it doesn't work)

Both has opened the URL:
http://ubuntu-tam.org/tamil_ubuntu_wiki/index.php/?????_???????_?????????????

The first image is a screen shot of the above mentioned page from
"Konqueror" and the second is the screenshot  from "Firefox"

While the Tamil Name "?????_???????_?????????????" in the above given
URL is displayed correctly in Konqueror but is not represented properly
in Firefox..

This will be of huge help since fixing this will help people naming
their pages in Tamil or other Languages without any hesitation.

 Yes you are right , though gmail accepts the mail , rediff aint.
Anyway , it will be helpful if you can explain how it works ..... i mean how
does rediff know that i am using a dynamic IP.
Is there anything in the smtp protocol that allows this functionality ?

The two common things are -

1. Reverse dns of your IP (do a dig -x IP.add.re.ss for your IP) says
something like dynamic, ppp etc.

2. Many other IPs in the same range are blocked due to virus traffic etc
so that filters automatically block the entire range

Hi,

Thanks all for your suggestions.
-- I can try valgrind&Callgrind.
-- Cant use ICC. That is not in my control and it will bring its own config,
build problems.
-- I use  Linux Box, high config, with EL3 or EL4. Build Env is GCC on EL3.
-- Is Intel Thread Checker necessary if I am sure there is no sync problems?
    Maybe its a bad question. I will have to check on this. ( I am currently
enjoying my pongal time off).
-- If I can use the Intel tools without compiling on an ICC, then I can do
it.
-- But I am dead sure that its my logic that is not optimal; bcos I m
handling a log of STL map, set etc., all of which use strings. I can change
them to use hash_map and hash_set, but that will offer only so much help as
the base logic will still be the same.
-- My appln is multithreaded. I can make out the difference when i run it on
a single proc and a dual proc machine.
-- My app is in trace Logging mode by default when the tests were conducted.
So it writes out too much trace logs, most of which is useless. On a
production system, this should be turned to error level. Tht is one thing I
must do.

I guess this discussion will serve more people than just me, as most
developers will tune their appln either had done it in past or will do it in
future. so friends, please keep your suggestions coming.
How do you perf tune an appln., tools, links, tips etc.,

Thanks for all your suggestions

Subject: [Ilugc] [Commercial]LinuxAsia 2007 - Call for Speakers
Message-ID: <45AB59FE.5000407@efyindia.com>

Dear friends,

This year, LinuxAsia's main goal is to promote open source innovations 
from India.

Hence, the organising committee (FOSII) invites 'technologists' and 
'innovators' from all over India to speak at LinuxAsia 07.

The speaker registration page is available at 
http://www.linuxasia.net/la07/speakers1/speaker.php

The broad genre of talks that are invited include:
a) Presentations on innovative open source projects developed in India 
or by Indians.
b) Presentations on latest developments in key open source technologies 
and tools (ex; Eclipse, MySQL, Mono, etc)
c) Presentations on initiatives to promote open source innovations in 
India (ex: Apache)

The three-day event has been divided into following broad 
technology-verticals:
First day (31st Jan 07): Trends and innovations in overall open source 
technologies and desktop technologies
Second day (1st Jan 07): Technology trends and innovations w.r.t. 
software development and databases
Third day (2nd Jan 07):     Technology trends and innovations w.r.t. 
tools for IT implementation and network management

Please note, that the speaker registration will end on 19th January 
2007, and all speaker presentations will be finalised by 22nd January 
2007 (evening).

Looking forward to your support in taking open source innovations from 
India to the next level.

Best Wishes!

You are talking about UI Automation here. A search in google gave me

Dogtail and other Accessibility based automation tools would work only 
with widgets which support accessibility like the ones GTK provides 
(internally using atk, at-spi, etc). I think the OP's need would require 
something like what anant suggested.

One way I can think of is to reduce the mask on your host B to a /30,
assign 192.168.0.6/30 on eth1 (as eth1:0) of the Linux gateway and get
it to work. Of course the best way is to redefine one of the subnets -
either on the Host A side or on the Host B side.

1. Learn Perl [1]
2. Use X11::GuiTest [2] perl module from cpan
3. Read this article [3] to learn more.
4. Say "Perl Rocks"

Step 4 is optional. :P

[1] http://perl.org
[2] http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?X11::GUITest
[3] http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2006/02/02/x11_gui_testing.html

Hope that helps,

Oh okie! I was confused that the OP is working on some UI Automation
testing assignment, where the UI's functionality bears the same
weightage for testing as the server side backend logic. :-). However,
It seems that Dogtail will not support  Web UI Automation testing.
Apologies for the confusion.

black listing gets a lot of mail rejected if it comes from a  
blacklisted ip. In one installation of bsnl dataone, they have to  
frequently switch off their modem to get a fresh IP - they do it  
whenever they noticed their mails are blocked - and usually have to  
do it at least once or twice a week. They are a using a smarhost to  
relay their mail - perfectly legal with a dynamic IP.

i was the one who told him it is ethicaly wrong. I believe it is  
ethicaly wrong to do anything that has the slightest chance of  
harming someone else - and i have suffered sufficiently from having  
blacklisted dynamic IPs to heartily curse anyone who does this kind

If theyre's using a smarthost to send their mail out anyway - whats the
point of getting a fresh IP each time?  If the mail is going out through
a smarthost it shouldnt be blocked, unless its the smarthost that's
blocked ..

smart host is refusing to accept the mails - it is one of those  
commercial services where you get unlimited email ids

If they're blocking access from their own customers, they're fools.
Completely incompetent fools. And your people should get a different
provider, preferably a guy who has two or more functional braincells

It is quite easy to either set up a different mailserver instance for
outgoing email access, or to exempt smtp authenticated connections from
filtering based on dynamic IPs.

cheap - we set this up back in 1996, after being taken for a ride by

blacklisted dynamic ips - blacklisted where ? - in mail servers ? So unless
you are sending mail using the very same concept of 'dynamic ip'  , why
would you suffer ? ..... just curious :)

        Firstly, look up what a DNSBL is:
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL
 A means by which an Internet site may publish a list of IP addresses
 that some people may want to avoid and in a format which can be
 easily queried by computer programs on the Internet. The technology
 is built on top of the Internet DNS or Domain Name System. DNSBLs are
 chiefly used to publish lists of addresses linked to spamming. Most
 mail transport agent (mail server) software can be configured to
 reject or flag messages which have been sent from a site listed on
 one or more such lists.

        Now, here is a list of DNSBLS:
     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_DNS_blacklists
 here is another:
     http://www.sdsc.edu/~jeff/spam/cbc.html
 Notice how many of these mention dialups? And how those  lists are
 rolled up into the big ones that a lot of mail server admins use?
 Spamassassin does a lookup (by default, I think, unless turned off)
 to at least some of the RBL hosts.

        I, for one, do use DNSBLs, and  most people I know do as
 well.

there are a hell of a lot of blacklists. And a hell of a lot of sites  
that check the IP before they allow you in. And if you are using  
dynamic IPs from BSNL, and your IP happens to be on a blacklist, you  
find yourself locked out. I have even been locked out of freenode at  
times - and dalnet quite often. Doesnt happen now to me as I have  
static IP.

I don't know who to hate. OpenProxy for maintaining the list or BSNL or 
the BSNL user who got the IP banned!

Thanks for the information on DNSBL , i thought if your ip gets blacklisted
, you just cant run a mail server from that dynamic ip.So it realy isnt a
problem as it will again get blacklisted if you want to run  a mail
server.But now i understand that a ip blacklisted will be prevented from
other services as well.

not for outgoing - many people use postfix/sendmail with smart hosts  
and they will be inconvenienced. And often it is not just that IP  
that gets blacklisted - the whole subnet gets blacklisted

You will get far less "mailservers" on dynamic IPs than virus infected
PCs that directly send out spam ..

So as you say - dynamic IP subnets are blocked by policy at most places

You should be able to use a smarthost - and anybody providing a
smarthost should have the sense to exempt outbound mail from his own
users. Please read my previous reply carefully

I am wondering if it is realistic to think of setting up everything in
2 weeks...so, I am considering a backup plan for a few items...let me
know if this is reasonable

gas setup - if i have the burners, can I get gas to use from a store
until the permanent contract is setup? (I plan to get an electric
spare also)

broadband - considering getting a wireless connection from airtel or
reliance until wired is complete...or limp along with email/internet
on a phone

a/c - don't know if I will need an a/c at first but if I need to, can
an a/c be easily/quickly rented?...any idea how much?

thank you

read it carefully - the point is there are a huge number of resellers  
of stuff from rackspace and such where everything is gui and dumbed  
down. As a rule, the resellers have little or no power to change  
anything. And many of these readymade systems *do* silly things like  
this. I am talking here of users at the bottom of the food chain.

yea that should work fine.  burners are dirt cheap and available off the
shelf though so ..

electrical - make sure you do have stuff that works with 220V/50Hz and
has the right pins for India.  You're probably better off buying
appliances locally .. and eating out for the first few days.

pcmcia cards - doable. Or there's like dozens of cybercafes all around
the place one of which you can try. Sify iWay is a chain of cafes' that
is reasonably good, nice and virus free PCs, aircon, and you can use
your prepaid account at any iway in the country.

As I told you ages back, the weather in Madras is rather like Atlanta
weather, hot, muggy (though its fairly ok now, pleasant).  Aircons are
very cheap here so you dont need to bother .. you could get by with a
ceiling fan for the next several weeks (till early march at least, after
which yes you DO need aircons)

Dont bother renting - you can buy that sort of stuff in minutes, have it
delivered to your house the same day (or possibly first thing next morning).

non-subsidised gas is available on demand. Forget subsidised gas -  
either you need a ration card or you need to be dishonest

any phone connection requires residence proof - make sure you have a  
lease deed from the landlord - that is enough. With residence proof  
you can get broadband in max two days.

you may not need one right now - but dont rent. Buy. And buy a split

cpanel has standard configs that will exempt smtp auth'd users - and the

You can do one thing... i don`t know if it will work for your fedora core 3
box.

When the "grub loader" come,

1. select your fedora core..
2. type "e"
3. another menu will come
4. select root.....
5. type "e"
6. write "linux single" just the end of that line
7. save it
8. boot with that
9. then your login shell will come ( if shadow in not enabled yet)
10. change your password
11. reboot...

Hi All,

Recently I downloaded the src of FastCGI module(www.fastcgi.com),
compiled and loaded into apache. If I sent a req to the fcgi appl, I
am getting the program content as the output. It is not executed by
the Apache. Following configs are newly added in httpd.conf file:

LoadModule fastcgi_module     mod_fastcgi.so
ScriptAlias /fastcgi-bin/ "/var/www/fastcgi-bin/"
<Location /fastcgi-bin>
   SetHandler fastcgi-script
   Options ExecCGI
</Location>

Anything missing/wrong here??

Bye :)

Ubuntu's default on apache2 has this ..

<IfModule mod_fastcgi.c>
  AddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi
  FastCgiIpcDir /var/lib/apache2/fastcgi
</IfModule>

And another thing is - give the full path to mod_fastcgi.so if
necessary. See if its actually getting loaded, check your apache logs
for the error you get.

Check your pam.conf or the proper file in /etc/pam.d

Reinstall the shadow suite too.

My guess is the OP is trying to get the swissprot format of a protein and
writing it in fasta format.
1) I think 'swiss' is not a valid argument for the database, it should be
'swissprot' [1]
2) A lot of functions in bioperl are deprecated. This function may also be
deprecated. (But since it says it
    cannot connect to the database this is possibly ruled out).
3) For all queries regarding bioperl use this mailing list
bioperl-l@lists.open-bio.org. [2].
 The developers like Jason Stagich answer them personally.

How about this?:

Haven't done this before, but I'm certainly interested to know if it
works for you. I would be needing something like this soon.

Digium early this month released AsteriskNOW and claim one can get an
Asterisk system running in 30 minutes or less. I haven't tried it
personally and do not know how it fares against trixbox
(http://www.trixbox.org). May be you will :)

You can grab an ISO by pointing your browser to http://www.asterisknow.org

I have updated the Wiki page for Events :-

1. Moved the 2006 events into a separate archive page and added an table 
of archive links at the bottom for 2006 and 2005.
2. Created a table for Jan 2007 events/seminars

Those who have posted in the "Planning" table, please verify your 
entries. If they are obsolete now or you wont be able to handle them as 
of now, please consider removing them. If they have been already 
executed, please move them to appropriate sections either in the present 
table or in the archives.

Link: http://chennailug.org/wiki/?title=Events

Request to Admin: Can't we have the upcoming meet announcement in the 
main page - center content ? If its already there, can you make it such 
that it catches the attention of the visitor at first ?

You can also try Selenium (http://www.openqa.org/selenium/). It has record
and play back option. It supports multiple browsers. You can explore lot in
that.

http://chennailug.org/ contains the upcoming events list. people are
not using the website to announce the events / talk they have planned
to give.

i am not sure about the wiki. but i am sure about the
http://chennailug.org/ site which has a drupal in it can be suitable
for adding/editing the events etc . we are not utilitising the most of
the features that is there in the website.

You could use the method Anant suggested..

....
Use curl to directly send a POST request to the page that accepts the
login form with userid/password set appropriately and then start the
browser with the resulting page.

The main question is how can the registered users add events to calender 
? can they ? If not, then who can add them and what they need to do if 
they want to add them. For example, I and a few others often go to many 
colleges and would like to add those schedules to the events calender. 
How to do that ?

Can we make use of the same set up to propose a local area LUG meets (if 
anything like that is going to happen ;) ) ?

it wont pick directly from the wiki. all you have to do is login to
the ilugc website using the login on the left side. if you dont have a
login, register with the site.
once logged, on the right side, you can list of options like create
content. by clicking on that, u can see the event creation option.
using this, u can create a event. also i added a event  that is going
to happen related to "writing efficient javascript"

i explained above. there are event types. if u go to college, select
the college type.if u go to school, select the school type. if u r
giving in monthly ilugc meeting, select that. if u need some more
type(which are frequently used), let me know
once u added the events, it will show up in the calender
(http://chennailug.org/event)

> Can we make use of the same set up to propose a local area LUG meets (if

i guess u can do. you could give a try. let me know if u face any difficulty.

I have registered long back (i.e. re-registered after the site was 
revamped) and have a username/password - logged in !

Create Content:

* Event
* Poll
* Story

Ok, I tried to add a new event - workshop in a college which Me and 
Raman had this month beginning.

Here is the link: http://chennailug.org/node/26

Can the event type be as follows ?

* College Workshops and Seminars
* School Workshops and talks
* Linux Demo Day
* Special Workshop/Seminars - talks in a specific topic like Python, Perl..
* LUG Monthly Meet
* Local LUG Meets
* Other FOSS Events - Events from non-ilugc like foss.in, Linux Asia..

Can you create events like this ?

Thanks. What we all needed was such a good explanation of doing it, as 
you gave above ;)

Now, at least the active LUGies, will add the events they participate or 
come to know into the calendar :)

Confirmed.

Topic: "Shakthimaan! The Indian Challenge of FLOSS
Advocacy"

I will be presenting on my two years of FLOSS advocacy
work done in India, the challenges, the experiences
etc. This is a non-technical presentation, and is a
case-study. I will be submitting a paper (pdf) for
your kind perusal, and an OpenOffice 2.0 presentation.

I have a GNOME application.

I want that as soon as a user 'a' logins to fedora, the gnome application should start.

Actually i want to achieve this through a C program ( So that rules out using gnome-session-properties)

How can i achieve this.

I use Fedora Core 5.

You can modify gnome-session-properties through a standard Gnome C 
program. What you want to do is to add the executable of your 
application to that user's startup items. GConf might help.

Message-ID: <45AFDD06.7060805@gmail.com>

Hello,

Does someone here use a Macbook?

1. Apple Macbooks seem cheaper than other brands with similar configs 
(Dell, HP, etc) in singapore. Any idea why?

2. Does someone have any on-hand experience with running linux native on 
a macbook? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook seems to list a few 
issues.

3. How much memory would you people recommend? 1G or 2G for running OSX 
+ ubuntu (on bootcamp)?

4. Is it required that I buy their adapter for connecting the macbook to 
an external projector? Is there no way out?

5. A person can carry in 1 laptop without any customs duty from 
singapore to india. Am I right?


Thanks,

Macbooks are nice .. very nice indeed. And I do intend to buy one real
soon now.

Stuff your laptop with as much RAM as you can .. but I'd suggest that
you simply run linux on parallels desktop, that's the way to go.

It is a mini-dvi out - most projectors have either DVI or VGA so you
need an adapter for it. It is quite cheap though

Yes - a laptop can be carried duty free.

Wrong choice of browser! :(

Correct!

I think, there are no additional plugins. Konqueror is
only capable of viewing in HTML form (instead of AJAX
one). I had tried accessing orkut, GMAIL in konqueror
that comes with 6.06, and I think Konqueror has a long
way to go. But, I really think, it is (one of?) the
fastest rendering browser. :) If there are websites
that follow the W3C strictly, they are rendered as
they would be in Mozilla Firefox. (almost similar)

I doubt you'll be able to do it with Konqueror. Forget
IE, it is not standards compliant (at the least, for
one property).

I think its because Konqueror does not support XMLHttpRequest - the method
call javascript uses to make asynchronous calls to the server and one that
gmail, gchat and all other web 2.0 kind applications use heavily.

Can't really fault Knoqueror though because it is not an ECMA standard.

Did see one blog that said Konqueror supports XMLHttpRequest - a blog
written in Oct 2006. So perhaps it does suppot this now and setting the
user_agent might help!

if you had asked only that - it would not have been OT. But you are  
generally asking how to go about buying a macbook, which is highly OT

OS X running on MAC itself is a linux/unix derivant,
its uses the unix like backbone,,
you can use shell and commands and lot more...
but it is highly polished and integrated for End user usabillity...
it uses the darwin kernel.. and more to that... its is really beautiful OS
one can admire delivering good results...(for a desktop user)
Soooo , technically OS X is a Linux/Unix variant/derivant what ever you want
to call it ... so no need to OT,
IT IS RELAVENT TO THE TOPIC...

and buying a MAC book is a real good idea....
I am planning to switch on to mac to use and understand the OS internals of
OS X. I am really impressed by it.

AND AGAIN REMEMBER, OS X is from UNIX.... with lots and lots of 3rd party
properitary modules added by apple.

I dont know why, but really MACbooks are really good, cheaper and gives more
performance machines per price...
the latest macbooks come with core 2 duo processors which are the updated
version of core2 saving more power and better performance..

and also macbook are more robust when compared to other brands like dell and
HP...

YES, you are right, one can carry a laptop for personal use...and can carry
more if he is on professional work...

more to that, if you are thinking of getting one from US,
see macmall.com
this site give you best priced macs with lots of bundled software to run
LInux or Windows and also in some cases preinstalled Dual boot Windows and
also many other bundled products...
you also have refurbished mac in this site too....

Look at what projectors you use have .. most lcd projectors have DVI
adaptors thatll work just fine.  Get those. Older projectors (and india
has its fair share of those) may need vga.  Get both - they're cheap

If you want - as you're in singapore - scout around the Funan IT mall
and you might find cheaper third party cables.

well, that is open to debate. If he had said something like - i am  
planning to buy a macbook to run linux on it, etc etc. would have  
been ok. But nobody would be dumb enough to buy a macbook and remove  
osx and run linux on it - especially now that apple has gone for  
intel. I have an ibook, and though 90% of my use is on opendarwin/ 
Xwindows, I dont discuss this on this list. And I personaly feel that  
injecting a little bit of 'linux' is not enough to justify an OT  
thread like this.

he wants to run linux on it

like i said - have you seen the parallels vm?  Most of my office is
already on it .. I'm going to get myself a macbook and run it as soon as
I get time to go buy a new laptop (my antique acer tm290 still has some
life in it..)

Parallels will run linux (centos, ubuntu etc) as a vm instance on top of
osx just fine

I'm Running Gentoo Linux natively on a Macbook Pro using Bootcamp just 
fine. All my devices work very nicely (iSight, Sound, Video etc.)

For Bootcamp 1G is sufficient; but if you plan to retain OS X and run 
Linux using Parallels, you'd need 2G.

Get a mini-DVI to VGA Connector. I got that for free with my MBP.

You can have a look at my latest blog post where I describe how you can 
do all you native Linux development on OS X using a clever combination 
of Parallels and other software. I call it the Macnix, and I simply love 
it :-D

I for one, don't mind discussing OSX here. Sure it might be OT, but like
it or not Linux & OSX are competitors. In fact, I see a coming war
between Ubuntu and OSX, if it's not already happening already. Sure,
Ubuntu might be out-classed by OSX in sheer eye-candy right now, but the
story might be quite different in a few years.

When linux geeks, steeped in all the "free" philosophy (as in anything
you wish to interpret it as) are going for a premium-cost, mostly
closed-source OS, there is something decidedly interesting happening
there. Being in denial about it doesn't help.

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0701190107j4cc2f9eeja229906425db8be7@mail.gmail.com>

Friends

Yesterday, I wanted to install linux on a brand new high end PC.
Configuration is

Intel Duo core Processor
Intel DG965RY board
Hitachi Deskstar Sata2 Hard disk
DDR2 512MB RAM

oops.

I tried FC6, ubuntu 6.10, OpenSuse 10.2, Debian Etch testing.
No linux can be installed.

All linux distros hanged in the stage of hardware detection.

After a google, got this link
http://www.blindedbytech.com/2006/11/10/how-to-install-fedora-core-6-on-intel-dg965ss-motherboard/

I got the same errors the blogger get and I folloed him.
Great.
FC6 installed nicely in that machine.

The reason is that the linux kernal 2.6.17 do not have latest device drivers.
FC6 has got 2.6.18.
And with some hacks in BIOS, FC6 installs nicely.

   Unfortunately we do not have ssh access outside from our Hostels. But you 
can use lftp to transfer files to an outside server using lftp. Just run lftp on
a terminal:

$$lftp 
----To set proxy do this:--
lftp :~> set ftp:proxy 'http://10.65.0.34:3128'
---and then you can login to your server like this---
lftp :~> lftp -u <username> <server>
lftp :~> put <filename>
....

shankar@firewall:~$ sudo apt-get install clamav

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.

Since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that
the package is simply not installable and a bug report against
that package should be filed.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:

It clearly says that one of the dependencies is a broken package. Try 
installing the same from some other mirror, or from the source.

Btw, what kind of parental control are you looking for and why, if you 
can tell us ?

Really. But hey am not responsible for this soa ;-)

In fact XMLHttpRequest was introduced by IE (circa 1999) and other browsers
followed suit. Even though most browsers support it now its still not a
standard.

Most (including yours truly) never knew it existed till GMal appeared and
showed what is possible in a web application.

Well if you mean the AJAX part of web 2.0 - the effect of updating a web
page with info from the server without having to refresh the entire page -
yes, there are a few approaches that can produce the same effect. But it
will make you jump so many hoops that you think you are better off with an
entire refresh!

Use it as firefox , from tools -> identification .
Asynchronous connections work , as ajax works , with konqueror , but
sometimes there is minor problems with alignment , like your frieds likst
may take extra 10 colums which can be irritating.Its one of the best
browsers otherwise , it has gobe through dramatic changes recently , and
those irritating memory leaks have been fixed.
Still its yet not complete and firefox is a better choice till then .

And I am not sure if its just me or if its a bug , I experience memory
related problems(memory magically hogged even when all tabs are closed
except one) with firefox when i use it for a long time , when i kill all and
start it again , its fine

Vim, Emacs are classic choices although they require a learning curve; 
and they work on both Linux and Windows. They supports tons of other 
languages too.

Apart from that I think ZendStudio is your best bet (though it's paid).

Memory leaks keep cropping up with firefox. Keep updating periodically
from the latest trunk and you'll find a particular batch of bugs fixed

Yes. It does. 
http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/1129
Even Opera. There was an article in the past that
Opera is one of the few browsers that is a lot more
standards compliant, than any other (yes, even
Firefox). 

Roshan wrote:

My context of stating this was in the use of GMAIL. 
Development of apps should be portable. "I write for a
few browsers", is *_ideally_* not good, but may not be
pragmatic too.


So, changing the user-agent string fool websites of
the client User Agent and enable features that they
intended to provide to one browser?

web content filtering for the last three weeks.Finally I found a wonderful
GUI tool from this URL : http://www.pctattletale.com/

and when am searching for how to install this on my Ubtuntu Dapper, I found
a solution in these forums.

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=226298&highlight=parental+control

https://launchpad.net/bounties/eric.duveau

It works really nice.But after I installed clamav , It is keep saying it is
outdated.I am now finding solution for this.

Debian installer is now using 2.6.18 kernel if you use net install.
Alternatively debian-testing-cd 1 with kde instead of gnome has
2.6.18
kernel.

Subject: [Ilugc] Trying to kill a file that does not exist
Message-ID: <201266.35668.qm@web36812.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I needed Cyberoam corporate client. Harish S mailed me the binary file for it -  crclient

I copied it to the /usr/bin directory
When i tried to execute "crclient" i got this message
./crclient: blah blah can only run "crclient"---something like this i dont remember exactly

Anyway so i had to execute "./crclient"
./crclient -u 10406002
I entered all details like server and password etc.

Now i accessed the internet fine. But i did not logout and then shutdown the PC.

Next time when logged in, i entered
./crclient -u 10406002
I get the error
./crclient already running with process id 2059

Now when i execute the ps -A command, i find that there is no process with pid 2059.

One more thin i would like to mention is that i had kept the command ./crclient -u 10406002 in /etc/profile. When it first got execute. But I later removed it frm the file

What seems to be the problem ?

I have restarted the system many times still the same error message show us with pid 2059. and i am unable to access internet.

Looks like some kind of file lock. They perhaps wrote the pid to some 
flie that they use for disallowing multiple instances.

There's a stale pid file in /tmp or /var/tmp - look there and delete the
file.

        Debian Etch is pre-release software. The final release shall
 have 2.6.18, or perhaps 2.6.19; and there should install perfectly
 nicely.

        In any case, hardware support is now mostly a linux kernel
 issue; and as new hardware and new drivers keep coming out, it mostly
 becomes an issue of which kernel happens to live on installation
 media.

Except graphics cards, which would fall under X.org?

Redhat used to have these "driver" disks, which had drivers,
obviously, for hardware that might not be supported out of the box by
the installation kernel. Maybe distros should look at publishing
frequently updated, regression-tested driver collection for hardware
whose support is available only in more recent kernels?

That's not a PHP editor; but rather a preconfigured Apache-PHP-mySQL bundle.

hi,

      i was trying to install anjuta s/w.
while installing it asked me for advanced versions of glibc & pkg-config. i
downloaded them and went in through the ./configure, make , & make install
commands. it went through successfully. later when i tried to install
anjuta,
it shows me the following error.

..................................................
checking for GLIB... configure: error: Package requirements (glib-2.0 >=
2.8.0)
were not met:

Package glib-2.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `glib-2.0.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'glib-2.0' found

*Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

*Alternatively, you may set the environment variables GLIB_CFLAGS
and GLIB_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

glibc != GLIB

Make sure you have Glib version greater than or equal to 2.8.0

Dear Members of the community,

India Habitat Centre (New Delhi) will be the hot spot for every Linux 
enthusiast from 31st Jan to 2nd Feb. And the reason is - LinuxAsia 2007 
- India's premier Linux and open source event.

We would like to ensure that the Linux/OSS community is fully engaged 
with the event.

What all is happening at LinuxAsia this year?
*********************************************

The main track - 'technology.innovation@oss.in', which will go on for 3 
days from 31st January till 2nd February 2007 at the India Habitat 
Centre, New Delhi.

The second track - CXOSummit - is a one-day event being held at Hotel 
Taj Mahal, Man Singh, New Delhi on the 1st of February 2007.

Besides that, there will be an IOSN summit, ODF India Chapter summit, 
technical workshops, sessions by LUGs, and last but not the least, the Expo.

What are the entry charges?
***************************

FIRST 500 FREE!!!

***Just 150 Free Pass Left***

Ok, this is best news - the first 500 (out of which, only 150 are left 
now) registrants can get the COMMUNITY PASS, which allows them entry to 
the 'technology.innovation@oss.in' track for FREE (subject to 
availability of vacant seats in the main hall and on a 
first-cum-first-served basis)! Though there is an element of organisers' 
checking your details and approving the serious cases only, but then, if 
you're serious about attending International-level Linux/OSS events - 
then REGISTER NOW at http://www.linuxasia.net. "Hurry up Just 150 Passes 
Left"

DELEGATE PASSES FOR SERIOUS PROFESSIONALS
For the serious professionals who want 'guaranteed seating' at LinuxAsia 
2007, we have the DELEGATE PASS. There is an 'early bird' offer till

Klaus Knopper (Knoppix), Brian Behlendorf (Apache and CollabNet), Dr 
Negroponte (one-laptop-per-child programme), are some of the 
international technology Gurus who have confirmed. We expect 3-4 more 
global luminaries to be there--their confirmation is in progress.

Any facilities for out-station delegates?
*****************************************

We have tied up with 'hospitality partners' who can assist you in 
getting best deals for travel and stay. If you need this support, simply 
select that option while registering.

What is LinuxAsia trying to achieve this year?
**********************************************

The goals that have been laid down for LinuxAsia 07 are:

Goal #1: Promote open source driven innovation so that India can 
showcase a minimum of 20 globally recognised OSS projects at LinuxAsia 2008.

Goal #2: Accelerate the adoption of Linux and open source software by 
highlighting their advantages, sharing success stories, and discussing 
strategies on how CXOs can gain advantage from both "open source" and 
"proprietary" worlds.

Goal #3: To provide a platform where other organisations with 
OSS-related agendas can hold their own sub-events and network with the 
entire community.

So, we request you to register, participate, and let us know how we 
fared in achieving those goals.

Best Wishes!

But, why? Why aren't you using your distro package
manager to install software? It should take care of
all dependancies and libraries.

Which distro?

Subject: [Ilugc] Chennai LUG web site and posting of materials
Message-ID: <45B234AF.2050205@gmail.com>

Hello LUGies,

I would like to add one more request/query to the admin if the 
chennailug.org web site, in addition to my earlier queries on posting 
event details and detailed reply from the admin for the same.

Today, we had a couple of speakers in the Monthly Meet and both had some 
presentations which they said they will post it in the mailing list and 
make it available in their website.

What I want to know is, is there any facility to have these 
presentations or any related material of a talk, in our web site itself 
and give the link for the same (i.e. to download) in the corresponding 
announcement page for the talk ? Or else, we can have a separate section 
for saving materials, categorized on different topics so any member can 
download them and make use of them.

If there is any such facilities existing in the web site, I request the 
admin to explain the same, as he did earlier regarding posing of events. 
If not, is there any possibility of creating one ?

If we cant have it in existing CMS, can we have a svn repos kind of set 
up with commit rights to a few active members who can help others in 
posting the materials as well as maintaining them ?

Waiting for the reply :)

I better give a suggestion that place the file in your website or some
location and give a link from chennailug.org site.

        Debian does have point releases for stable -- which come every
 three months or so, but they are usually security and some bug fixes,

 the "volatile" distribution, which is supposed to carry things like
 new clamav packages, and perhaps new kernel images -- things that are
 known to change fairly rapidly.

ok, I asked for two reasons..

1. People like me, do not have a web site or a globally accessible 
personal space. We have to put it somewhere of our buddie's web site 
which is an obligation and use of his *paid* space.
2. If we do so (i.e. put up in some website of ours and give the link), 
for some reason the person changes his web site or removes the 
content/material some time in future, we lose it there after and all our 
pointers are to /dev/null.

Rather, Chennai LUG should have its own repos or collection of 
documents/presentations. We do have a few (infact many) presentations 
with us, but its with *us* and others have to ask us for it. If we had a 
place to upload them all, within the chennailug.org space, it will be 
there for ever.

Also, we can say "check chennailug.org/presentations/ for all the 
presentations we have and you can freely download them and use". Using 
our personal site is only an alternative option if we have no chance of 
hosting our own repos/collection.

I just wanted to know whether we can have such a repos and make it 
accessible in our website, similar to what shakthi has in his web site - 
a list of presentations which we can download.

I have downloaded the tarball of php5.0

name is: php5.0.2.tar.gz

i could install this file by configure, make, make install..... but
sometimes it creates various types of dependency problem. So, i want to
avoid such type of "configure,make,make install" procedure.
Now, i want to use "synaptic" in order to install that tarball.
How can i do tha? I want to make my debian box such type of way that, it
will automatically install it`s required library at the time of installation
of php5.0.2.tar.gz

Is it possible?

instead, you could  try this...
http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:aA-0H3M0xHEJ:julien.danjou.info/article-apt-build.html+building+using+apt-build&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&client=firefox

try using apt-build

also i can u try using apt-get which has some option like getting
build dependcies..

click?

Is checkinstall[1] what you are looking for? It lets you convert your 
source files into native packages.

1. ./configure --prefix=/usr
2. make
3. sudo checkinstall -D

Message-ID: <69621d830701201118o963be05g2dd1ba965f12027d@mail.gmail.com>

Friends,

i had Ubuntu,Debian in my machine.  My Debian is in /dev/hda9 and my Ubuntu
is in /dev/hda1.
Tonight, i noticed that, i cannot enter into Ubuntu from boot loader ( GRUB
). I made an operation before that...
i installed grub in /dev/hda... i think it is in /dev/hda1....
what i did...

grub-install /dev/hda

now, i tried to configure the boot loader from "boot config" , but i cannot
enter into Ubuntu yet.
Here i want to add one thing, there is nothing about Ubuntu in
/boot/grub/menu.lst

what will i do? install the full again????

I guess the entry relating to Ubuntu is missing
It should be something like this
title Ubuntu
root (hd0,8)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.xx-xx-x86 (replace with whatever kernel version you
have got)
initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.6.xx-xx-x86 ( version no. will be same as above)
savedefault
boot

Add it at the bottom of the file /boot/grub/menu.lst (of debian and not
ubuntu) and reboot. It should work now.

1. Read - `man apt-get` and `man apt-cache`

2. $ sudo apt-get install <package-name> , in the terminal will download 
the required package from the repository (if present in the repositories 
mentioned in /etc/apt/sources.lst) along with all its dependences and 
install it. You can also just download it and not install using the same 
command with additional options. Also, removing is easy in this way 
'sudo apt-get remove <package-name>' will do.

3. Same is possible with Synaptic package manager, which is the GUI 
front end for the above apt-get (or the dpkg beneath).

Linus and Tannenbaum have never been on bad terms.. It is an urban myth that
they are :).. In fact, when one of the reporters of an online peice
misquoted Tannenbaum and claimed Linux has stolen code, Tannenbaum came out
in support for Linus..

http://www.simplicidade.org/notes/archives/2004/05/tannenbaum_comm.html

All said, it should be an interesting introduction :)

Free as in beer, yes; but 9i for Linux[1] is still closed-source AFAIK,
and requires to accept a rather funny license agreement.

I urge you to use PostgreSQL or mySQL instead. Why Oracle?

Subject: [Ilugc] Reliance ZTE card problem in Linux..
Message-ID: <45B442A3.3010109@midascomm.com>


Hi All,

I got a Reliance ZTE data card for my Laptop recently. I could not make 
it work
with Linux(Debian Etch Testing). When I insert the card, it is getting 
detected at
/dev/ttys3.

I gave wvdial-conf, it did not detect the card at the /dev/ttys3 after 
trying to detect the
card in different baud rate.

I am struck with windoze for internet until this problem is solved, so 
please help me
to dump that completely.

regards,
siva.

Reliance HUAWEI USB for wireless internet connection has the same problem.
This also makes a bit windows dependent.

any solution?

It is not shutting down properly, looks like. Check the vsftpd
initscript, see that you arent starting it from 2 places (say
inetd/xinetd as well as init.d)

Isn't Joomla a content management system? Definitely not the preferred

I will post the request to ILUGC, for a talk related
to Free/Libre/Open Source Software only. 

I believe ILUGCs' posters are still with Arunai. I
request you to kindly hand it over to us.

Is it possible to have a English version also? Or Does someone mind
translating the  stuff in the wiki so that people like me need not go
through the pains of reading alphabet by alphabet and then trying to
figure out the meaning???

        I personally prefer using Emacs + psgml.  Psgml  parses the
 DTD, and then you have access to syntax high lighting, context
 sensitive tag and attribute completion, automatic indentation and
 insertion of balanced tags.

        It is not WYSIWYG, and is not linked in to the W3C spec (I
 just have that open in a browser to refer to). I do not find the lack
 of  WYSIWYG a drawback; and I like the fact that this makes writing
 syntactically correct pages, and that I can use the same interface to
 write other XML/SGML documents (like docbook material).

        But no, this is not a dedicated html editor.

I haven't read the previuos posts for this , pardon me if I am repeating.
Have you tried nvu.com, its  simple wysiwyg html editor that lets you  creat your own pages. You can also put in php , and other scripts tho they may not show up in the wysysyg screen.

The code for Tamil is ta_IN. Firefox doesn't have the ta_IN flag because
it isn't supported upstream.

Additionally there are no tamil fonts in portage AFAIK, but you can just
download them from anywhere and put them where X can find it. ~/.fonts
or wherever.

You might also want to edit your /etc/locale.gen and add ta_IN to the
list; and run locale-gen afterward.

Google opened my eyes 0.0

define: interoperability -->

[1] the ability of one computer system to control another, even though 
the two systems are made by different manufacturers.

[2] The ability to link systems so that they can actually work together 
like one, big system.

[3] is the ability to link (service chaining) different applications 
regardless of proprietary software used at the source together so that 
several web services are available concurrently

do you think that samba is that tough to setup? does this
interoperability requires two big software companies join together
give a brand support by giving a one click install software?
before ms partnered with novell, i guess samba was used by many people
and it just works. even i have used two or three yrs back...

Nothing stops M$ from breaking the existing interoperability and then allow
Novell to provide support to fix it :-)

Use sudo or else, expect. But learning to use sudo is much easier than 
learning to use expect.

Please change the subject line while replying or quoting something from 
a digest mail.

Please remove all the contents and include only things which you are 
replying to or quoting for your reply.

Why you want to embed Java in PHP code ? What you want to do ?

Was really surprised that people had requirement for Tamil, so that we could
see the results.
The IRC client too supports Tamil ?

The SCIM input method does work fine with X-Chat and Gaim to input Tamil
letters at IRC.

        sudo is the best answer, of course. But before hard coding
 passwords in an expect script, I would write a C program that execs
 /bin/ls, and make the resulting program suid. Less of a security
 hole.

to make it more genenric, pass the program as a command line argument.

There couldn't be a bigger security hole perhaps :)

        I deliberately did not suggest that, since that is a great big
 gaping security hole., You might as well remove the password
 requirement for the user, since anyone can then run any command as a
 user -- including, but not restricted to, /bin/sh

        Do not do this.

        This again requires you to hard code the password into your
 script -- which adds yet another security vulnerability to your
 system.  It is, in general, a bad idea to wrote down passwords at
 all, it is worse to put them up on the machine itself; aney one
 cracking into one account automatically gets access tothe second
 account.  You have, thus, lost one set of compartmentalizations
 between security domains on you machine, were  you to do this.

hi,
within a day or two i would be able to update you on what Microsoft 
would present at LinuxAsia 07. But it would be similar to the talk by 
Mr. Janki Raman (Microsoft) at LinuxAsia 2004 (first LinuxAsia). The 
talk was heavily attended by the 'community' to the extent that 200 
seater room had 350 people crowding for space.

LinuxAsia Team is committed to ensure that in no way presence of 
Microsoft will hinder or harm the Linux or Open Source movement.

any tips or suggestions are most welcomed.

regards,
Niraj Sahay

if you look at the 'screen' section of xorg.conf in kubuntu you will  
find a weird Mode - something like 1324X1234 or something that  
prevents higher resolutions from loading - edit that

its better to drop point 1 becuase if a person has brain who can
troubleshoot and solve problems by him/herself can gain RHCE. but it
may or may not happen in reverse direction. :)

option 1.

install grub in windows
http://marc.herbert.free.fr/linux/win2linstall.html#loadlin-or-grub-for-nt

option 2.
Boot any live cd, fix grub

or use rescue mode in install cd

once you get a shell in either of this

run grub
grub> root (hd0)
grub> setup (hd0)
grub> quit

now reboot.

Let me know if it works.

what do you mean by unicoding in php? does this mean you want to be
able to display unicode characters in the web pages?

did you google ?
not too far in the googling I found this.

there is nothing to be done in php. its all depends on what collation
u choose when u create DB/tables. always prefer to choose as
utf8_unicode_ci as the collations as the world is moving towards
unicode.

if u want to convert strings from one unicode to another, use
mbstring/iconv modules in php etc.

another suggestion is on the project. as u mentioned that u r going to
do multilingual portal, try using open source projects like Drupal,
joomla etc
you can view my site http://www.balachandar.net based on drupal and
other site http://www.goopensource.net based on joomla

learn how they had done it and try to contribute to the community.

Oh several things.

1. Think the reverse. Can a Linux mail client connect to an Exchange
server and FULLY utilize all the features?
2. Other servers from Microsoft including the currently in-vogue
Sharepoint portal server. Can Linux interoperate with them?
3. Windows networking & AD. Enough said.

Message-ID: <bc3fff520701242025h5b77644cv61c0a7c28db3a1a8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello frends!

  i am using postgresql database. I am using crond for daily backup.

Following is the crontab entry,

29 17 * * 1-6  postgres  /path/to/script.sh

'script.sh'   contains

PGUSER=postgres  pg_dumpall > /path/to/backup_date.sql

Running the script using crond creates the 0 byte files.

But , If i run the script in console , it creates the file with content.

Any suggestion pls?

Regards

Where is this cron entry of yours? The "user-to-run-as-6th-field"
works only in /etc/crontab or in  /etc/cron.d (and not in crontabs
created by running "crontab -e").

this is not what she asked for. what is wanted is - how to make a  
multilingual website. This is how it is done in python - should be  
similar in php

1. In your source code, mark all translateable strings: _("to be  
translated")
2. In your html mark all strings suitably - for example in django do  
{% trans "to be translated" %}
3. using xgettext create a .pot file which is of the form:

msgid:
"to be translated"
msgstring:
"fill in tamil here"

4. then compile your .po file into a .mo file
5. put the .mo file in ~locale/ta/LC_MESSAGES

then, depending on the language setting, the appropriate string will  
be taken from the .mo file and displayed

After creating the .mo file and putting it in ~locale/ta/LC_MESSAGES, 
think you have to use  i18n_loc_set_dfault('ta_TA') in your PHP file.

You can read about this function here - 
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.i18n-loc-set-default.php

Try with a small text file, where you enter a set of string and check 
whether it gets replaced by the corresponding locale string.

remember to use -("string") else it will not know what string to localize.

Hello frends!

 I got solution for my problem. Now i gave full path in script,
PGUSER=postgres  /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_dumpall > /path/to/backup_date.sql
Now its working for me.

Already my $PATH contains /usr/local/pgsql/bin .
Then , why it happened?

Is there any PATH details need for crond?

IIRC, cron jobs run as root and /usr/local/bin will not be in the root's
path.. I would guess that if you do a su- and echo $PATH, your will find
/usr/local/pgsql/bin missing from there.. and hence cron job was not able to
pick it up.

Think its a warning for the future. Isn't your app working fine now, 
albeit it showing above warning. But, you have to look your code and 
change the 'model' in your code into some other workaround.

May be the given link www.rubyonrails.org/deprecation has some info 
regarding how do you correct this.

Cron does not read your .bash_profile or whatever; it just sets a
basic PATH for you. So yes, you need to set PATH in your script
yourself.

Try creating a new project using the updated rails package and then move all
the code you wrote into the relevant directories. And please post what
happened :-) Am also in the process of updating my rails package.

Thanks Praveen for the download. Sriram the method in your blog worked. One
small doubt though, the pages display fine. The title on the tab also looks
fine, am wondering why I see boxes on the title bar.

Its quite easy using sed.

shell> sed 's/\(.\{30\}\).*/\1/
1q' FILE

or, if your system's sed supports the ``-e'' option, you can use:

shell> sed -e 's/\(.\{30\}\).*/\1/' -e 1q FILE

Message-ID: <69621d830701251141q45aa98c8m73cf27881377d218@mail.gmail.com>

Guys, i am facing a strange problem regarding DVD.  Tonight, i mounted one
dvd and it showed me the "icon" of DVD. But, when i went to go through the
contents of that one, i couldnot see anything...... :(

But, i tried that DVD with Windows and could see the contents of that one.
And, as i know, that DVD was written by Windows Software ( May be, Nero
Burner).

How can i make that DVD readable in Linux?

Maybe that DVD is in UDF format and you are mounting it as iso9660.

mount it as UDF file system.
mount -t udf /dev/hdd /mnt/cdrom
/dev/hdd should be changed to whatever is the name your hard disk is
detected as and
/mnt/cdrom can be the location where you normally mount the cdrom/dvd.
Check the man pages of mount for more -

1. Read - `man head` `man tail` `man grep` and `man sed` so that you 
know what does what :)

2. If you more interested in knowing more about Bash commands and 
scripting , try reading - Understanding the bash shell by Newham & 
Rosenblatt, O'Reilly Publications.

Login using ssh and do a du -h * - might be something in your homedir etc

If you are on a shared server with just cpanel access you won't have any
use for that document. But go read something like the sendmail / exim
FAQs - depending on which mailserver you use.

In, KDE, using skim with the app-i18n/scim-m17n which pulls

There's no logic in that, man .. what network card are you using? If it
is some cheap rubbish like realtek, intex etc that might be needed
because of a junk card and an even worse driver, but certainly not when
using a decent network card (intel eepro series isnt bad for example)

You might be right. The built in nic does not work in my laptop (Vaio) and
am using a USB-ethernet adapter currently. Also this could be the reason why
very few are facing similar problems! What really stumped me was that it
works well when booted off a live CD but not from the resident OS!!

Anyway, those who have similar problems can try this out and maybe their
problems are resolved!

Only now am able to watch youtube seamlessly :-)

both of which should work just fine

What adapter is it? What shows up in lspci?

I guess I found the reason behind the problem. I recently bought a usb
hub, that came with provision for external power supply. Now when i
connect the external hard disk to usb hub, and connect the usb hub to my
laptop, the disk never stops working, even after repeated use for
weeks. 

So the missing component before was the external power supply to the USB
cable. Hope that helps you too RamKumar.

Dear All,

 

Recently I installed centos 4.4., we have one windows 2003 domain
controller, 100 xp clients in the domail.

Samba server is enabled and samba user has been configured, From windows xp
,win server 2003 domain controller and win member servers I can access the
samba shared folder. (folder created in centos),

 

But I can't access the windows shared folders from the Centos(samba server)
that is the problem

 

 

Instead of centos I used RedHat 4 AS,  that is  no problem.   The same way
(what I have configure in redhat 4 AS) I configure the centos 4.4,  But I
can't access the windows shared folders from the Centos(samba server) that
is the problem

Its an intel nic. The laptop itself is 20 months old. Worked well for a
year. Even now the interface gets configured properly and pinging it from
within the host works well too. Only it cannot be used to ping the interface
on the other end of the cabel! Looks like the physical wires that connect it
to the RJ45 socket is malfunctioning.

Anyway, have been on the USB-ethernet adapter ever since. Of course it means
carrying the adapter along with the laptop but just now I tried to recollect
how many times I've carried the laptop outside - just once in 20 months :-)
So never thought of fixing the nic.

regards,
mano

On the contrary, passing the RHCE is quite an indication that the
candidate does possess a reasonable amount of brains and
troubleshooting skills. These last two by themselves aren't enough to
pass the RHCE, though - it requires knowledge as well (of Unix,
networking etc.).

you can mug up and pass RHCE. There are institutes in Mumbai who will  
give you a full set of likely scenarios and train you up to pass at a  
cost of 4k. I have met several RHCE's who know zilch about  
systemsadministration. I do agree that if a person trains himself for  
RHCE and does the exam in the spirit in which it is designed, the  
certificate is worth happening. But how do you find out how he did  
it? I remember a lug list where and RHCE was enquirying in general  
how to set up a mailserver ...

Hi,

Sometime back there was a discussion on the crappy state of bluetooth
in GNOME. Well the situation seems to have changed now and a better
version of gnome-bluetooth seems to be available.

You can get the repository details and the instructions from this blog:
http://osrevolution.wordpress.com/2007/01/26/debian-gnome-bluetooth-repository/

It's in spanish but you'll get the idea from the commands and the screenshots.

For some more information there is a ubuntu-bluetooth team itself. The
wiki and launchpad links are here.

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bluetooth

https://launchpad.net/~bluetooth

I have been using Bluetooth with my Ubuntu box for quite sometime now.
Use it to transfer files to my Mobile phone, and K750i has this
Bluetooth remote control which I use for controlling Mplayer, Rhythm
box, totem etc.. Also useful while making presentations. You can fond
quite a number of docs on the above links. I have also blogged on the
Remote control thing on the link below.

Hi,

You want to install GNU/Linux, but don't have a cdrom/floppy/bootable
usb drive? (I faced this challenge some time back and this document
helped me http://marc.herbert.free.fr/linux/win2linstall.html ). It is
easier now. You can install Debian GNU/Linux if you have a working
internet connection and you are running a Microsoft Windows Operating
system. Debian now has an installer that runs on Windows!!!

You can check the price at deltapage and go over to Ritchie street and buy
it for a few hundreds lesser. I have bought a couple of systems at RC
Automation in Ritchie st and to me they seem to be ok! Remember these things
are subjective and you could have an entirely different experience :-)

So I hope It has drivers for it.
It asks the Device as "/dev/modem,/dev/ttyS0" and a lot.

How to query the modem for its device nemae?

Subversion is a concurrent system. Therefore, requiring locks is
considered a special exception, and thus requires extra work.
There's no magic button to make the whole system behave like VSS.
You have to set 'svn:needs-lock' on every file. There's no other
solution. (I'm not sure why you think it's so difficult...?)

Dont be silly

That's a fairly decent topic to discuss, either as "microsoft fud" or
with facts and figures about how linux outperforms windows

Just because its critical of linux it cannot be considered spam. Stifling
opposing viewpoints is against the very grain of freedom.

The sys-admin at a company I used to work for, had his RHCE
credentials prominently displayed in his cube. But he was like a fish
out of water on Linux, and was generally of no help whatsoever in
sorting out the networking issues we faced. Recently a friend of mine
interviewed a similar guy with ten years experience and currently
working for the world's most famous linux  distro. Anecdotal evidence
? Yes. But there is too much of it. We are the world's foremost
experts in beating any exam/testing system. Ignore this fact and you
will most probably end up paying the price down the road.

10(including this one) out of 14 mails in this thread are on arguing whether
the post was spam or not and discussing about the list guidelines.
That person wasn't spamming. Maybe you can call him as a troll.
But it is upto the members to reply in a responsible manner.

Can we go back to the topic and discuss how one OS outperforms the other?

Combine that with the auto-prop setting features of the standard svn
client to get a fairly automatic setup... see the [auto-props] section
in ~/.subversion/config.

it moves on...

Benjarong for thai food, Copper Point at GRT Grand Days for indian food.
There's other stuff around too.  As for places to visit I can recommend
the Chennai LUG if there's a meeting around then - or whatever hotel
you're staying in will typically have a one or two day trip around the
city they'll offer you at inflated rates (which are still cheap when you
consider that a looney's worth 37 INR)

1. Press Control+Alt+F1, login to console, and see if
you get the same errors. 

2. Press Control+Alt+F7 to go to X, and try to input
text to see if you still get the errors.

Check in /bin/dmesg for any entry for your modem.

Usually /dev/modem is a symbolic link file to
/dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyS1 etc. You can create it if it
is not there, and point to the respective ttySX file
using ln command.

I run Kubuntu Dapper. I bought an Acer AL 1706 just last week. 2 years
warranty by the company. Samsung is costlier by 1 K. I got this one
for 10.5K. I bought it from Syama Systems and solutions, Mount Road
(Immedietly after getting down from anna flyover). Door delivery.

Hi,

TCO
In the url  http://www.microsoft.com/india/getthefacts/ , if you look
at the TCO graphs, it is mentioned that windows server 2003 support
cost for 5 yrs is much less compared to the redhat linux 3.

what i feel is that, redhat sells only the support and the licensing
cost for the software because it uses FOSS in it. whereas, in case of
windows support, the customer need to pay licensing fee every year +
one time 5 yr support fees.

in that case, how come the windows TCO becomes lower than redhat support?

That might be correct. But that takes into consideration only support
costs. Microsoft I guess daren't mention licensing costs because RHEL
doesn't have it at all. In addition, things like administrator CTC,
downtime/patching related costs, lack of consolidation-ability in
Windows costs, all contribute to the TCO, none of which Microsoft ever
mention in the public :)

Cornucopia on Cenotaph Road. One of my favorite continental restaurants
in Chennai. I also happen to like Mathsya in Egmore/Eden in Besant Nagar
for vegetarian food,  Sparky's in Egmore/Gallopin' Gooseberry in Greams
Road for American food, and also, Amethyst in Gopalpuram (the best
ambience). I could go on, but that should do for 2-3 days ;).

Welcome to Chennai :)

all this stuff is available in foreign. how about idli and aatukaal 
[1] soup on the roadside in tambaram. Madurai sri muniyaandi vilas in  
kodambakkam - near valluvar kottam. and of course rabbit varuval at  
any chettinadu restaurant. ceylon parottas and peas masala at any  
kaaka restaurant.

[1] aatukaal == goat's foot

Hello everyone :)
                     I opened my  gmail today and four ILUGC mails.As an
usual practise I gave a very keen reading to it. For the present I am not as
talented as a spanner is :( but I am a simple programmer trying to take FOSS
into medical imaging.and i love programming in only and only in C. I didnt
want to compare the two OS.None of them are always possitive.And thats true.

Like all of you i like using FOSS.I have helped people [ count is 6 :) ]
migrate to GNU/LINUX.I have even offered(through ILUGC mailing list) help to
people who want to migrate to GNU/LINUX.

Few days back there was a queston regarding installation.I answered that
querry and proposed to work together on developing a Installation system in
GNU/LINUX system.But there was not enough response.Presently I am trying to
understand how the executables work(please do give input,It will help me a
lot).

I have a suggestion for ILUGC mailing list-->Besides administration,there
should be talks on development also.

aMBUJ
RHCE.

P.S. Collaborate and develop :)

I'm looking for a cost effective & reliable VPS hosting solution. The
things I'll be running on the box is Intranet CMS (Zope/Plone), Drupal
based website, LDAP, (e)Jabberd, MySQL & SVN NOTE: this is for a
business requirement so reliability is the key requirement. Any
suggestions?

Interesting. I have to try those sometime. But perhaps recommending our
road-side food and spicy stuff for a first-time visitor is not such a
good idea :). I've seen a couple of German friends getting tearful and
gulping down water after tasting some chicken curry ;).

If you want downmarket hotels with really tasty food, try "Hotel Topsee"
in adyar sometime, or Buharis on MG Road, for stuff like this (aatukal
soup or "paaya" is soup or stew made with mutton trotters, there's other
stuff too)

Ponnusamy Hotel (5 or 6 branches around the city) for that kind of stuff

But - yes, not as hygeinic as they should be, sometimes. So I'd still
recommend GRT Grand Days / Copper Point to the man if he wants to try
chettinad and kerala style non vegetarian food (amazing aapams and
vegetable or mutton stew there, just for example)

	srs (Iyer with a well developed taste for meat)

Forgot to mention about HTTrack. With httrack you can rip those pages which
you read online, and give it away to your students. There are many such
mirroring softwares, and httrack was just an example.

Happened to see O'Reilly's book once..
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/prowqt2/
although its for qt3

This might be of some help too...
http://www.digitalfanatics.org/projects/qt_tutorial/

..and of course taking into account the newer qt 4, take a look here too..

Apologies, didnt notice that you wanted docs in downloadable form,
after doing a 'wget -m -p --no-parent <URL>' , you could convert it to
pdf using html2pdf.
You might have the html docs already in /usr/share/doc

Or because Microsoft funded the study. That makes it sound better, doesn't it.

I have read/heard from other sources too about the TCO almost
remaining the same between Microsoft and Linux for large datacenter
installations. I haven't known either one to have better TCO. Now that
is not my point. Its just what I heard and am keeping my fingers
crossed that this wil not be SPAM/FUD too!

I am using Ubuntu Edgy 6.10. Hardware configuration is PIII-800MHz,

present I am working with on-board graphics card. I want to upgrade this
with PCI Graphics controller. The purpose of PCI Graphics card is to
test new 3D window managers and to play some 3D (accelerated) games. I
want to know which NVIDIA card available in Ritchie Street is best
suitable for my purpose. Minimal purpose serving card is enough (I don't
want to invest more on this old system).

Your suggestions please!

Add an entry in your /etc/apt/sources.list file, say:

deb cdrom:[<name> - <version> DVD-1 (<release>)]/
dapper main

thats their funeral - if they want genuine local food, they must be  
prepared to suffer. And generally speaking the cleaner the restaurant  
and the more stylish the decor the less the food resembles local food

when i did a search on your name, i noticed some digest headers,  
maybe you are receiving in digest mode and not giving the correct  
subject line - people often dont respond when the subject line is not  
clear

Sadly, PCI video cards are outdated.

But you can hunt for NVIDIA Geforce MX 4XX cards which should be able
to do most of the Compiz/Beryl stuff you are looking for but those
cards are not good for today's 3D games (Q4, NWN2 etc).

They are also rare and will generally cost a premium, around 4K+.

I hope you mean how do the binary execute in the memory. or other wise in a
shell if i just type a command like ls -l, or ps whats going on the behind
the screen.
its not a simple task to explain  or it will be   big lecture  :P

However I can give some pointers.
Part A.
You may need to know what a process is. What is context switching
How are process created..

Part B
What is a virtual memory?
What is Page Table.

Part C.  (With out any shared library)
What does a compiler do.
What are the different parts of Binary executable. and how the binary is
compiled.

Part D
What are the headers in the Binary
How do loader reads the binary header and loads in to the memory (or
initialization). Page Table initialization.
How the command line argument is beeing referenced in the program?
How the instruction pointer IP or the program counter is set to the start of
the program to start executing.

Part -E To go deeper with shared library
How do the shared objects are initialized.

Try to collect those information .. you will know 1/4 to 1/3 the kernel part
:) if you dont get it. reply me.. I'll try to explain as much as I can
(provided I understand it correctly to certain extent)

Regards,
Arul.

You got it wrong. I have an external power for the USB cable alone. My
external hard disk has a case with fan and it is connected to a separate
external power.  Look for USB hubs with external power supply. It will
solve your problem.

Hi All,
  I am using firefox extension to download google videos. In particular
I am using the extension from http://javimoya.com/blog/youtube_en.php .
Many times the download stops in the middle. It puts up an error saying
the source file cannot be read from server.  does anyone else face the
same problem ? Or does anyone have a plugin that works without any
problem?

Google videos have a link from where you can download the video
directly without any extension. I play the downloaded video using VLC
and I think it can also run without any problems using mplayer.

Hi Srinivasan,
 Thanks for the information. The link that you mentioned is also a
javascript. So it does not let us invoke a download manager, or any
other tool which supports resuming failed/canceled downloads. Is there a
way to outcome this ? 
Thanks
