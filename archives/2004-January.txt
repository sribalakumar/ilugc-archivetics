4 GB is not enough to install everything on the redhat 9 CDs. You need
more than 6GB. But if you went with the "default" package selection you
should probably be fine.

256 MB is needed to run kde or gnome. It will run with 128 MB, but will swap
constantly. With 64 MB you should probably be able to use windowmaker or some
other lightweight WM which you can configure using "switchdesk". But keep in
mind that if you run mozilla/openoffice or just about anything apart from
xterm, you'll quickly run out of memory.

Bottom line: buy more memory or use redhat 7.x (or some other distro).

hey all,

Finally able to connect to the Internet through Linux.
whew! wasted my new year's eve though.

worth it though. :D

Figured out the problem by enabling debugging in
KPPP.This prints out a list of possible errors/fixes.

The problem was the /etc/pppd/options.ttyS0 file.
I had earlier changed this to setup a null modem
connection(thanks Sameer) .

I just removed all the entries in the file and !!
Linux connects without a problem.

btw, anyone having the Scyld GNU/Linux CDROM?

cheers,
toufeeq

Well, I pasted the exact message into google, and it looks like a
"common" problem. (just like common sense, you don't see much around
;))

See these threads for example:

There could be a possibility that it has replaced some crucial file.

Hi all,

IBM is running an anti linux ad, which I found objectionable.
So I've written a letter to them (see below). I would like to
know what everyone thinks of it. Any idea who I should send it
to? Should I change "we" to "I" in the letter? Anyone else like

	Open letter to IBM

	I speak only for myself, but as a long time linux user I believe
	my opinions are fairly typical of the community.

	IBM has in recent years been using and supporing linux on the 
	server side. We think this is great. On the other hand IBM has
	always sold desktop systems with Microsoft Windows. We think 
	that's your prerogative.

	This is with reference to the recent ad comparing the IBM laptop
	<insert model here> with the Compaq Presario laptop. Apart from
	how the ad stands with respect to the Comparative Advertising law,
	what irks us is the (intentional) implication that linux is inferior
	to windows and Compaq is in some way duping its customers by selling
	them linux systems.

	We know that this is not true. You know that it is not true. The 
	ad exploits the relative lack of familiarity of the general public
	with linux and open source and tries to create a fear of the unknown.
	As you know very well, we call this FUD: http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/F/FUD.html.
	It certainly leaves a bad taste in the mouth. We feel that IBM is
	hitting below the belt.

	Even though IBM has so far promoted only MS-windows based desktop
	systems, recent announcements from IBM indicate this might change
	soon in the future. In fact it appears that this might have already
	started happening. In any case, considering the astounding rate at
	which the effort to make linux desktop-ready has progressed, it is
	clear that change is only a matter of time.

	Obviously, any company whose business strategy includes open source
	would benefit greatly from being in the good books of the open
	source community. Considering that the linux community has a long
	memory, it is in your own long term interest to play fair with us.

	So we request you to stop running this ad, and also promise us to
	avoid running such biased ads in the future.

	Thank you

promise? this sounds  like "sweetheadt, now that you  had sex with me,

Boot using Floppy and then run lilo / grub-install. Read the man 
lilo.conf and info grub to configure the boot loader. Otherwise again
you will say "I am NOT able to boot into Windoze" :)

Hello, 
            Iam K.Sriram. Iam doing my final year B.Tech Electronics engg. in Madras Institute of Technology, chromepet, chennai - 44. Also iam in the organising committee of our colleges' computer club. 
 
            In our club we are regularly conducting free classes about GNU/Linux every 
wednesday from evening 5.00 to 6.15. Interested persons can come and join our classes
as many people from ILUGC had queried already about that class, when they came to 
M.I.T for attending Linux Demo Day, one month back. 
            
            We call our classes as live classes coz we will be running all the commands in the computer side by side, when the class is being taken. 
 
             So interested  persons can mail me abt the classes or u can call
 
  Mr. Ponnuraj ( Head in-charge of Computer club, MIT ),
  Rajam Boy's Hostel, MIT campus,
  chromepet, chennai - 44.

Message-ID: <OF7B28CCFB.9437B81C-ON65256E0F.004C8ADC@lntinfotech.com>

Hi,
I did an install of mandrake 9.2 and was tryin to configure Apache through
webmin.
Webmin gave errors with Apache. It was like file not f

The apache version shipped out with Mandrake is 2.0.47.  The names of the
different files used in Apache seem to have been changed.

For instance httpd.conf had been changed to httpd2.conf. I am wondering if
this is something that Apache had changed.

I had worked with Apache 2.0.40 before and I dont remember seeing this kind
of  changes in that.


Has anybody noticed this?


 Thanks,

Hi,
Just wondering if we could have one or two persons for handing out copies
of Linux to others.
For instance, when one gets a new version of Linux, he could hand it to
these two persons or one of the LUG guys nearby and they could make a copy
and others could get it from him.

I am generally very difficult to get hold of and am pretty busy on weekends
too. If someone in Anna Nagar, could take responsibility, I might be able
to give them Linux software when I get it and they could make copies and
distribute it in LUG meetings. I dont have a writer at home.

If anyone is interested, please let me know.

Regards,
Sanjay

Dear All,
    I am planning to give a talk on "Virus Filtering using a Linux
Gateway" in the coming ilugc meet (Jan 10th 2004).
    thought would share the draft with you people to learn more of what
you expect :). i invite your flames/suggestions.
    the rough draft of my talk, ppl:

1. What do you want to have today? - Viruses, worms and other slimy
creatures on the menu.
goes through types of malicious programs, and other interesting
snippets/trivia. also will include a complete break down of a virus(
maybe with source itself ).

2. Linux doesn't need a virus - Carelessness is enuff.
to make people understand the responsibilities that linux brings with it.

3. Why Linux on the Gateway ?
explains the unbeatable features on Linux that makes it 'DA' gateway of
choice for any organisation.

4. open is secure - open source to the rescue !!!
will talk of the different open source options available and also give a
plug for openprotect - opencomputing's open source project.

hope that covers all the questions, people will expect to be answered.

cheers,
Ganesh, KM.

Message-ID: <200401031017.PAA08983@WS0005.indiatimes.com>

Hello all,

i would first like to enquire about the availability of Fedora Core 1 cds in the group. I would be obliged if any body could give me a source for the cds(except for downloading them from the net).

Secondly i would like to make a request to all the knowledgable Linux world programmers to provide me with an alternative for VB/Oracle combination on Windows to perform a DBMS lab project in Linux.I already have MySQL installed and i thnk it would be a suitable replacemetn for Oracle. However i would like to know if there is any other alternative. (What about PostgreSQL). But the front end is something that i really need to know. Also if possible mention some reference for the suggested front end.

Last but not the least if any body can come up with a good topic which can be practically applied on instead of just ending up as a college project pls do so. (P.S. : I was first going for a personal accounting software but when i saw GNUCash ona friend's suggestion i was totally amazed. It offered a lot more than what i could have imagined. Just goes to show the power of Open Source and how there are projects and tools there that we cant even think about in the proprietary world(denominated of course by MicroSoft).

3 cheers for OSS.

  If you're using Alsa, try running 
bash$ alsa-ctl store (something like that)

  If you're using OSS, why can't you change to Alsa?

Mandrake has a rather nonstandard and customized apache config (split into
several files rather than a monolithic httpd.conf)

That sort of setup is not likely to play nice with webmin (which I guess
assumes that there is a standard apache it is working with, or maybe the
version of webmin that you are using is trying to configure apache 1.x).

What is wrong with vi by the way?

This has been going on for quite some time.  Drop by the IIT-M campus and
have a chat with Prof Sriram about your CD needs (phone him and fix a good

Hi Ankit,
The best alternative or the only good way to perform DBI operations would
be to use Perl/DBI. It is fast easy and also cross-platform. You can use
Perl/Tk for the GUI.

Thanks

Hi,

I have fedora core 1 (binary-only)

> an alternative for VB/Oracle combination on 
> Windows to perform a DBMS lab project in Linux

  VB is _easy_ to program with, since it is a
scripting language. So don't fiddle up with C/C++ or
Java.  Go for Python[1], a clean and readable
scripting language.  Thus use Python as a substitute
for VB (But in real sense, Python is the much much
better language than VB, though there are no polished
ads as for VB).  To know why one should learn Python,
surf to 
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=3882
  Python can be used as a frontend for all stuffs.

  For database, MySQL is my choice.  Python comes will
almost every distribution. So you have to download
MySQL-python[2].

  Python, by default comes with the Tk toolkit for
creating GUI.  By I don't recommend Tk. (Tk is best
used with Tcl and that's all abt it).  I recommend you
using PyGTK[3], GTK bindings for Python.

  After a few months, "Visual Python" will be a gift
for Python programmers.  I'm working on VP as a sole
substitute for VB.  Ideas and suggestions are welcome.

   But won't a VB programmer be scared of Perl?

   Perl: NOT for general purpose programming.
   Tcl: GUI and network programs
   Python: General purpose programming
   PHP: SS scripts
   VB: Impress your girl friend, though unusable ;-)

A more general solution[1] is to use Google[2].

'Sudanthiram' is the more appropriate equivalent in Tamil for 'freedom'. 
'Viduthalai'  means release from bondage.  Since the point is to find an 
equivalent for 'free software', we may have to search further.

In Tamil, software is called 'menporul'.  'men' is derived from 'menmai' 
meaning 'soft', and 'pourl' meaning  'meaning', 'substance', or 'wares'. 
Free Software could be called 'sudanthira menporul' but does not sound 
good.  'ilavasam' exactly means free without price, and 'ilavasa 
menporul' is not the expression we would want to use.

Freedom without restrictions is often conveyed with 'kattatra sudanthiram'.

'kattatra menporul' would be closest equivalent to 'free software' in Tamil.

'kattu' means 'restriction' and 'kattatra' means 'without restriction'. 
 The root meaning of 'kattu' is to tie together, to bond together, and 
this results in a 'construction'. By constructing, we restrict and 
control.   'kattu maram' (catamaran - in English) means the raft or 
float of logs (maram) tied side by side.   'kattidam' is naturally a 
building. Well, we can build may words and expressions this way with 
'kattu' [pun unintended] 'Anai kattu' means a dam - a restriction that 
stores water.  But freedom is more meaningful without restrictions, and 
the adage is therefore 'kattatra sudanthiram' - freedom without 
restrictions.  Likewise, 'kattatra menporul' - software without 
restrictions - could be a suitable equivant for 'free software'.

Every Tamil probably has a poet hiding in him, and 'kattatra menporul' 
would allow lot of play with words.
'kattu' means to build, to compose, to bundle, to pack, firm, solid, and 
enjoys many more meanings that could convey various aspects of free 
software.  'kattatra menporul' could directly mean the (unbuilt!) source 
code, that we usually download and build. 'kattum' means reasonable and 
affordable. 

'kattatra menporul kattu' - free software package
'kattatra menporul namakku kattum' - free software is reasonable and 
suits us.
'kattana menporul' - this is solid (and even attractive!) code

Is there a better expression than 'kattatra menporul' for 'free 
software' in Tamil?

huh? Care to explain why you opine perl cannot be used for general

It is not merely that, but also the meaning it conveys.  'Sudandira 
menporul' conveys exactly the same meaning as "Freedom Software" and 
that is why I suggested 'kattatra menporul'- software that is free 
without restrictions.

I am sure you agree that Tamil is a very precise language with very deep 
roots. In English, when we don't want to budge from our position, we may 
say, "I won't budge an inch".  In Tamil, we could say something like, "I 
won't budge an immi" where immi is a fraction precisely equal to 
1/1075200.  Were ancient Tamils using some kind of octal system? 
 Consider this: kal = 1/4; araikkal=1/8; veesam=1/16; kani=1/80; 
mundhiri=1/320;  keelarai=1/640; keelveesam= 1/5120; 
keelairaikal=1/2560; keelmundhiri=1/102400 etc. I am sure there ought to 
be a precise expression in Tamil, that already exists, and elegantly 
conveys the substance of free software.

Tamil writer Sujatha openly advocates free software, and uses the 
expression 'open source' literally in Tamil.  The zha Tamil PC team 
working on Tamil i10n for those who want to use *only* Tamil, prefix the 
unique Tamil zha to OpenOffice, KDE etc and are making it freely 
available to the Tamil world. visit: http://www.zhakanini.org/   As long 
as people understand that it is free software, any reference that picks 
up popularity is fine.  But, do we want free software to be known as 
'open source' in Tamil? A more elegant expression than 'sudanthira 
menporul' or 'kattatra menporul' may be possible and available in Tamil 
for 'free software'.  I am only requesting if there are better options. 
 For all I know, computers running on free software may eventually be 
called as 'zha kanini' by a majority of Tamils.

Tamil is more suitable language from an AI point of view because of very 
strong root words, and once l18n projects mature, we may have very 
interesting programs in Tamil.  Machine translations and machine 
'understanding' of Tamil text ought to be easier than with any other 
language.  The strength lies in the careful evolution of words from 
strong root words.  That is why, more attention need to be paid when new 
concepts are taken to the Tamil world.

You mean "set a password for lilo or grub"?

I rather think this guy wants to stop people from booting linux into 
single user mode, from where you can change the root password.

Message-ID: <1196.220.226.12.122.1073236755.squirrel@puggy.symonds.net>

Hi,

I am using Debian Woody, with Mplayer 0.92-2.95.4. My MP3s are playing
nice with it, but when i try to play VCDs or any other video files like
avi or mpeg, my monitor somehow goes out of sync.

Should I apply any update to it to make it play VCDs. Or should I compile
it with some options? I recently switched to debian, I didnt had any
problem with Red Hat Linux in playing these files.

Regards,
R Karthick

Hi,
I expect to have FreeBSD 5.1 within 2 weeks. Its four cds. I will let you
know when I get them.

If anyone is interested in Debian Woody 3.0 r2 (latest stable release), you
can get them from Mr. Vaasudevan.

The 7 cd set contains the non-us cd too. The first 6 cds are each around
640-650 MB in size. The last cd is around 200-300 MB in size.

Is there anybody from LUG in Anna Nagar with a cd writer?

I also have openssi - open source cluster software from HP ( 1 cd)


Regards,
Sanjay

Add the following line in your /etc/inittab and do a telinit q (or kill 
-1 1) to ask init to re-read your config:

# What to do in single user mode?
~~:S:wait:/sbin/sulogin

Adding the above line will ask for root password when you boot into 
single-user mode (much like Solaris, etc)

I have tried Borland Kylix OE.  A copy of Kylix Enterprise Edition with MySQL 
could make a _nearest_ combo to VB/Oracle AFAIK.

BTW, Kylix EE is a commercial software.  But Kylix Open Edition is free and 
meant for creating open source gpl'd programs (am i right?) only.  It is a 
free download and lacks the easy ADO control like Database interactivity 
(Enterprise edition has this functionality).  

You need to know object pascal to work with kylix.  The best part of this is 
that, your program may also be cross platform compatible: the kylix source 
code can be compiled as a windows exe using delphi.

Hi Ganesh,

I rather feel your contents are too generic for the topic. 

Why dont you provide something more practical.  I'm not sure about other, but 
I wouldnt like to have a theory class on virus architecture just to know what 
software/configuration is needed to prevent them.  It sometimes feels good to 
be lazy.

We have antivirus filtering in our gateways.  Why would I want to know the 
'break down' of a virus?  All I would like to hear is what the virus does, 
what is the threat level, what I should do in my gateway to prevent it from 
entering the network.

> 2. Linux doesn't need a virus - Carelessness is enuff.
This is THEORY.  Giving a practical solution to 'virus filtering on a linux 
gateway' would be of much help.  

> 3. Why Linux on the Gateway ?
But isnt the topic about virus filtering on a 'linux gateway'.  This point 
would have been good if the topic was just 'virus filtering on a gateway'.  
Since the topic is 'virus filtering on a linux gateway', it implies that I 
have linux for gateway.  

Anyway, here is my recommended list of contents:

1. Intro to Viruses, worms and other slimy creatures on the menu and the 
differenced between them. Your first point is OK.

2.  Mode of operation/spreading of viruses, worms, etc.
3.  How to prevent/ cure them.  Info about what software to use, how to

Are you sure about the "Visual Python" name?  That name is already taken by 
ActiveState.  Pls check their site

perl  code  isn't "always"  unreadable.   It  depends  largely on  the
programmer.   One  can  write   line-noise  python  code  as  well  as
poems-that-work  in  perl. Only  that  it  takes  an effort  from  the
programmer.

Also there could be a variety  of reasons why one would want to choose
perl / python for a  given problem. Not always does readability matter
and not always does performance matter. It Depends. 

Look at this page for example:

http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/index2.shtml

you can't just generalise that python  is THE best or perl is THE best
for any given application. It Depends. :)

and  besides the  point of  readability,  there are  "better" ways  of
messing up code by over {OOPing,optimising,abstracting}. ;)

Don't blame the language because you can't write clean code.  Perl gives
you the freedom to "optimise" for a variety of things -
    1. run time speed, performance, memory usage
    2. time spent in programming, lines of code
    3. programming style - descriptive, concise, wizard only

It's upto the programmer to choose what to optimise for the task at
hand.

I should think about doing a "Programming Perl" talk one of these days
:-)

Hi !
first of all thanks for taking interest in my prob :-) now to the definition  , after i press enter for install[ [ All the linux version viz Mandrake,Rh,Dragon etc etc] ,it checks for all the hardware and It stops exactly after looking for the cd rives and when coming to HDD.then the comment given by setup is "partition check", am typing the exact words in the setup,hope it helps u in understanding my situation.

after checking for the installed hardware (it detects my HDD then CD rom drive and floppy )
IT STOPS RIGHT THERE

partition check :
hda<4> hda : dma_timer_expiry
:dma status == 0x21
hda drive not ready for command
hda time out waiting for DMA
hda:(__ide_dma_testing_irq)
called while not waiting
hda: status error:status = 0x58
{DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest

this goes on for hda<5>,hda<6>,then it gets bored and waits for a sec and then am able to run the complete setup.

during startup to the same dma chk is done for 5 mins .. then  usual startup takes place(all the ok stuff !) then it stops after 

remounting Filesystem in read write mode	[ok]
activating swap partition				[ok]
<stops here and does not proceed> 

MAY DAY MAY DAY !

[puts flamethrower down]
As does Python. The readability of the code depends on the person who 
write the code. Lots of our enterprise stuff moving most of our data 
around is written in perl. Please do not jump to conclusions based on 
popular opinions.

Hi,

  Since this topic has got so much attention.  I would
like some opinion on speed/memory overhead aspect of 
these scripting languages.  Especially from 
web based application point of view.

>From what I have understoon.

Perl : With mod_perl can be pretty fast.
Php : Is also getting faster mostly because of Zend Engine
Python : I dunno much about it but my gut feeling it will be bit slower
than Perl and PHP
Ruby : I think it will also be bit slower than Perl and Php.
JSP: It can be really fast. If you want it to be faster than others
add more RAM to it :)(More memory overhead)

What you guys/girls think?

I think the "Great Computer Language Shootout"
http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/index2.shtml
which has a lot of concrete experimental data is
more accurate/valuable than anyone's subjective

Hi,

  Yes I saw that link.  It was pretty impressive :)

  Somehow it didnt say how much impact
mod_perl, mod_ruby can make with respect to
memory usage on Apache(cause thats the only web
server I am going to use :) ).  The last time I did a
load test on a perl program with mod_perl running
on apache it did a lot better than my jsp programs.
(simple hello world, for loop with 10, 100 iterations)

  Thanks for the link again :)

How come Visual Basic is a scripting language ? Its compiled ('built', as in

Give more hardware details.  What is the age of your system?  are you sure 
that you are not running a fried up IDE controller?  What about your hard 
disk? how old is that?

If hda is a cd drive, then the error messages arent so deadly.  Does the 
kernel hang _immediately_ after printing "Partition Check:" ?  If yes,  then 
it is possible that both your motherboard and harddisk are operating on 
different UDMA modes.  Did you upgrade your HDD recently?

Karthik

Did you even take some time to read this guy's mail before replying, 
instead of giving bogus advice?

It does look like his modem is dialing out just fine, but he can't set 
up his dialer software.

Arun - see http://www.hserus.net/dlhowto.html - might help you

Area code / index number - leave them blank. You are not making an STD 
call to dial into netone, right?  Area code for madras - 040, for example.

  VB _is_ a scripting language.  Applications deployed
in VB will also include some vb6 runtime dlls. 
Actually (I think) that dlls contain the interpreter.
  You doubt cleanly tells that VB is an unnecessay
scripting language (as it lacks explicit scripting
language features).

Hi ALL,

Do any body have Oracle for Linux ver. (RHx.x)?
I need Oracle for Linux ver. It seems like Oracle for Linux is quite complex
in installing and configuring for DBA.

Thanks in Advance.

Hi !
first of all thanks for taking interest in my prob :-) now to the definition  , after i press enter for install[ [ All the linux version viz Mandrake,Rh,Dragon etc etc] ,it checks for all the hardware and It stops exactly after looking for the cd rives and when coming to HDD.then the comment given by setup is "partition check", am typing the exact words in the setup,hope it helps u in understanding my situation.

after checking for the installed hardware (it detects my HDD then CD rom drive and floppy )
IT STOPS RIGHT THERE

partition check :
hda<4> hda : dma_timer_expiry
:dma status == 0x21
hda drive not ready for command
hda time out waiting for DMA
hda:(__ide_dma_testing_irq)
called while not waiting
hda: status error:status = 0x58
{DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest

this goes on for hda<5>,hda<6>,then it gets bored and waits for a sec and then am able to run the complete setup.

during startup to the same dma chk is done for 5 mins .. then  usual startup takes place(all the ok stuff !) then it stops after 

remounting Filesystem in read write mode	[ok]
activating swap partition				[ok]
<stops here and does not proceed> 

MAY DAY MAY DAY !
Arvind

C _is_ a scripting language. Applications developed in C will need a
runtime library (called [g]libc). Actually I think libc contains a
interpreter for the C language.

And so on and so forth....NOT !

VB used to compile to p-code in version 5, but from version 6 onwards,
you can compile to native code. Every language with a class library
requires a runtime library (unless you compile static).

p-code must be something like bytecode and that actually blurs the
line between compiled and interpreted languages. I believe bytecodes
run faster than compiled languages because of the JIT.

I think RMS is quite right about people taking Free Software for
granted. But, I wouldn't place proprietary software as an impending
danger yet.

Maybe, that's one of the reasons I generally don't participate in Free
Software evangelism. After all, how many people do you come about in
everyday life telling you about your Fundamental Rights as outlined by
the constitution.

Or, more specifically, how many people _remember_ about their
Fundamental Rights outside their civics class ?

Also, it's quite depressing for people to call RMS as a zealot. A
zealot, as I understand, is someone who is stuck to some "ideals"
without understanding the depth (a religious group for example). Were
our freedom fighters zealots ? I think not.

But one thing is for sure - the foundation has put out some world
class software, and using anything less is just a shame.

While booting from the first installation cd, type bf24 on the lilo boot 
prompt.  You will then get 2.4 kernel.

Everything is only interpreted, but it depends on what level they're 
interpreted.  Native executables are interpreted by the processor, while 
bytecodes and other intermediate languages are interpreted by the 
program (usually the runtime stuff).

The basic difference between scripting languages like Perl, Python and 
languages like C is that languages like Perl, Python don't have strict 
type-checking functionality, you can use the same variable for storing 
strings, later use it to store numbers, etc...

C runtime doesn't interpret the executables, they contain 
implementations of common functions like strcpy(), strcat(), etc.  You 
can easily compile C programs as a static binary (gcc -static), which 
doesn't require any runtime for running, but the size purely depends on 
the functions you've used in the program.

While languages like VB usually have their own exception handlers, and 
stuff embedded in the "native" executables they make, which will throw 
you the "VB Runtime Error" dialogs when something unusual happens.

Bytecodes can *never* run faster than native executables (not VB ;-)

You  could  have  use  bf24  while installing.  Now  you  may  install
kernel-image-2.4.18-bf2.4 or  kernel-image-2.4.18-1-686. Still your OS

Did you actually read my post ? Maybe you missed the "NOT" part. I did
say that static binaries don't require runtime libraries.

(offtopic at this point, but my native binaries compiled with GCJ
gives me *HUGE* binaries. A hello world program gives me a SEVEN
MEGABYTE binary. It's obvious that it links the ENTIRE java class
library in.)


    GV> Bytecodes can *never* run faster than native executables (not
    GV> VB ;-)


Yes they can.

A JIT has better understanding of the runtime environment than a
compiler (ahead-of-time) and can therefore better optimize the
generated native code.

I came across an excellent paper a while back, but unfortunately can't
remember the source now. STFW-ing with "bytecode faster native java"
throws up a couple of hits.

Note that I'm talking of tight loops (numerical algorithms) that even
an half assed JIT will be equivalent to its compiler (except for the
first iter, which doesn't weigh much).

I generally think that compiler research hasn't had much lime light
as other traditional computing science fields.

I need to run, so I couldn't read through most of the links, but [0]
tells "...portable way to obtain a Java program that runs faster than
compiled serial C code.", though "serial C code" doesn't help prove
my point much.

Ganesh

Not about static binaries, but the glibc runtime doesn't interpret 
binaries generated by the GNU C compiler.

Are you trying to say JITs can optimize native executables??   Why 
should native executables be optimized by JIT?  They don't require any 
Just-In-Time support anyway, they're just "interpreted" by the processor.

GCC 3.2.3 and other later versions code optimizations are comparable 
with Intel compilers now... they do all those branch optimizations, CSE 
optimizations, etc...

I'm not talking about compilers for languages like Java which don't 
generate native executables.

Knoppix should be worth trying out on laptops. It should detect hardware

`woody' comes with 2.4 kernel packages. Install one of them., may be
they'll detect your card. If your kernel is 2.2.20-idepci which is the
default in `woody'; it will not support AGP devices. It dosent export
/dev/agpgart. 

Cheers,
Joe

you need to download the nvidia linux driver package available at nvidia.com.  
executing that file should install the necessary modules for your kernel.  
Then change the driver name in XF86config-4 from 'nv' to 'nvidia'.  

What comes with your motherboard is not a 'proper' GeForce2 AGP card, but an 
nForce 1 Northwood chip with AGP.  Using 'nv' in XF86config will just crash 
the system.

Message-ID: <E1Ae9yU-0008IW-Iu@apollo.enterprisedigital.net>

Dear All,

Thanks for the suggestions from Zahoor, Ramesh, Bala, Jagan and Karthik.

since the topic - "Virus Filtering using a GNU/Linux Gateway" (greets to
that anonymous member of ilugc who pointed out GNU ;) )sounds practical
and most people liked something practical, the talk is split something
like this:-

1. What do you want to have today? - Viruses, worms and other slimy
creatures on the menu.
goes through types of malicious programs

2. open is secure - open source to the rescue !!!
will talk of the different open source tools available to thwart virus
related threats through HTTP, FTP, SMTP and SAMBA, walk through the
setup of certain tools. also talks about in-development works.

This is the alpha release of the talk, it has matured from the planning
stage, i hope.

feature freeze for beta of the talk is set on thursday(Jan 8th) evening,
so people kindly send your suggestions by thursday evening.

the future is always beta,
cheers,
Ganesh, KM.

I dont know if it would be  off-topic, but i think it would be nice if
you can mention a few words (maybe in the footnote of the speec) about
how one should take care while trusting code (or even seemingly small,
unmalicious code) given by strangers.

about three years ago Vikram sent a mail to ILUGC like this:

"try this:

echo '. ./_ & . ./_' >./_; . ./_
"
without  a  forethought /  analysis  most  people  tried it  and  were
surprised to see the results :) (now that the list has changed / grown
much, let me not break the suspense... ;) please try it ;) )

I'm sure it would make a pretty interesting talk.

Hi,
I am having problems with Debian install.

X server is not working. I get the error message: screens not found. will
provide a detailed log .

Apt-get is not working. I get error "http ://ftp.iitm.ac.in/debian" not
found in sources.list on line 10

I think this might be related to network configuration. When I tried to
edit /etc/resolv.conf, I could not locate the file.

What option do I have to select in tasksel to get networking files?


Does anyone know of reliable resources for debian? Cant seem to find any
books in the local stores on debian (atleast from their website)


Thanks,
Sanjay

Hi,

I am willing to work on some OS projects like glade-3.
 I particulary want to work in glade-3 as my "Visual
Python" needs it to be finished as I need to embed
glade in VP.  

I need to an internet connection at home (as my
College people refuse to provide me a linux installed
system with internet).

I can't go for dialup kindof stuffs.  As I will be
checking out/commiting often it is not suited for me.

I tried touchtel, but there are no linux drivers
available for the modem (alcatel?) they give.

Any other suggestions on ISP would be of great help to
me.

BTW, I live in Chennai (Velachery).

`----

I guess most people must have tried it by now.. so it should be 'okay'
to explain what it does now ;)

echo '. ./_ & . ./_' > ./_; . ./_

there are two parts of the command (seperated by the ';')

1. echo '. ./_ & . ./_' > ./_
2. . ./_

the  fundamental part,  as  you would  have  realized by  now, is  the
'. ./_'.

the first command writes the string '.  ./_ & . ./_' into the file ./_
However, the string  is nothing but another shell  command which forks
two  such  . ./_  processes.   As you  would  have  known, command1  &
command2 will make command1 to  go into background and command2 to run
in the foreground.  so one of  the . ./_ will go into background (note
that each of this . ./_ will call  another . ./_ & . ./_ pair) and the
other will stay in foreground.

so  after, say,  10  levels of  forking,  you will  have  2^10 =  1024
processes which are  still busy doing nothing but  fork! ps would give
you a  list big enough (if your  machine is powerful _and_  you did it
within a few seconds of typing  the above). My pentium 100 saw instant
heating and it hung within 4 seconds or so (or so I remember :) )

the second command only tries to  pull the first control rod that sets
off the reaction. :)

Such an  attack is called  a 'fork bomb'  as it makes the  kernel busy
doing fork()s.

So whats the fix?

ulimit is a program using which  one can view/set many such limits for
a given shell.  Limits like no  of processes a shell can fork, allowed
resident memory, etc.,.  If you type  ulimit -u, you should be able to
see  the number of  allowed processes.   And there  is the  ulimit -h,
always :).

In  debian, these limits  can be  set in  /etc/security/limits.conf (I
dont know whats the equivalent  file on other systems. you should sure
be able to  grep for 'nproc' in /etc/ atleast in  rhl, mdk, etc.,. you
get the idea... ;) ). Its /etc/login.conf for FreeBSD.

cheers,

try http://eciadsl.flashtux.org for usb dsl modem drivers.

Or if you use a standard cablemodem provider like hathway they'll just 
give you a cablemodem with a ethernet connection that connects to the 
back of your PC... you can use that with linux.

Hmm, I think you have misunderstood my statement. I apologize as it
was written in a hurry.

(lets go back to our conventional definition of interpreter and compiler.)

A real interpreter, as in GW-BASIC for example, reads a single block
of code and executes it. Simple stuff.

A AOT compiler reads the code and generates native code. The generated
binary does not require anything special in order to be executed (or
"interpreted" as you would like to put it).

Until here, we are on the same page.

But in the case of a JIT, the section to be executed is read and
compiled to native code at *runtime*. JIT stands for Just-In-Time
COMPILER, but the word compiler is usually not tacked on. So, the Sun
VM actually has a compiler underneath which optimizes bytecode.

There are loads of things that can be done better at runtime, loop
unrolling for example. Sun's HotSpot technology identifies sections of
code which can be optimized leading to better performance at times.

I would be grateful if you could point me towards a taxonomy of
optimization terms.

    GV> I'm not talking about compilers for languages like Java which
    GV> don't generate native executables.


Neither am I, if you meant 'javac'.

Ganesh

Dude, throw away those crutches and learn to use a search engine. I

Anyways, the first couple of hits:


1. Simple and effective array prefetching in Java

Abstract:

    Java is becoming a viable choice for numerical algorithms due to
    the software engineering benefits of object-oriented
    programming. Because these programs still use large arrays that do
    not fit in the cache, they continue to suffer from poor memory
    performance. To hide memory latency, we describe a new unified
    [...]
    software prefetching algorithms for C and Fortran use locality
    analysis and sophisticated loop transformations. Because our
    analysis is much simpler and quicker, it is suitable for including
    in a just-in-time compiler. We further show that the additional
    loop transformations and careful scheduling of prefetches used in
    previous work are not always necessary for modern architectures
    and Java programs.

2. Improving Java performance using hardware translation

Abstract:

    State of the art Java Virtual Machines with Just-In-Time (JIT)
    compilers make use of advanced compiler techniques, run-time
    profiling and adaptive compilation to improve
    performance. However, these techniques for alleviating performance
    bottlenecks are more effective in long running workloads, such as
    server applications. Short running Java programs, or client
    workloads, spend a large fraction of their execution time in
    compilation instead of useful execution when run using JIT
    compilers. In ...

3. Benchmarking Java against C and Fortran for scientific applications

Abstract:

    Increasing interest is being shown in the use of Java for
    scientific applications. The Java Grande benchmark suite [4] was
    designed with such applications primarily in mind. The perceived
    lack of performance of Java still deters many potential users,
    despite recent advances in just-in-time (JIT) and adaptive
    compilers. There are however few benchmark results available
    comparing Java to more traditional languages such as C and
    Fortran. To address this issue, a subset of the Java Grande
    Benchmarks have been re-written in C and Fortran allowing direct
    performance comparisons between the three languages. The
    performance of a range of Java execution environments, C and
    Fortran compilers have been tested across a number of platforms
    using the suite. These demonstrate that on some platforms (notably
    Intel Pentium) the performance gap is now quite small.

Abstract:

    This survey describes research directions in techniques to improve
    the performance of programs written in the Java programming
    language. The standard technique for Java execution is
    interpretation, which provides for extensive portability of
    programs. A Java interpreter dynamically executes Java bytecodes,

There are a plenty of options in many compilers including GCC (GCC 
stands for GNU Compiler Collection -- not GNU C Compiler as many think) 
for loop unrolling (-funroll-loops), function inlining 
(-finline-functions), etc.  "info gcc" might be good starting point on this.

Turning these options "On" might give you speed difference of 5-10x more 
than JITs.

The question is who are you targetting and what "holes" do you
perceive in the existing set of tools?  What are you going to with
this new tool?  If one knows Python its easy enough firing up an
editor and coding away or using the interactive interpreter.  There
are too many editors, and enough highly interactive interpreters for
Python.  If you are looking to generate a GUI builder, then again
there are lots of tools for that.

Huh? From all my experience with wxPython, it is certainly not buggy.
It is a moving target but thats a different issue.  GTK has also been
a moving target.

As regards bindings, pyGTK is a binding too so there is no big
difference in that regard between pyGTK and wxPython.  Where are there
"too many bindings" I cannot understand.  Trouble with GTK is that its
still not as cross platform as wxPython is (atleast when I checked
last).

BTW, have you looked at PythonCard?

There is no dearth of Python based IDE projects (IDLE, Boa, Eric
etc.).  Have you read this:

  http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-pide/

Perhaps what you want to do is generate another IDE thats GTK
specific.  Which brings me back to question 2.  Where is the clear
analysis of what you want to do, and what current projects don't
already do or intend to do?  Why is your solution better than say
using Emacs/Vi?

So, you do the obvious, queue up commits and do it in one go when you
have a substantial amount to commit.  You usually have to connect to
get email, so this should not be a big deal.

like how  you refer to  the file 'any_bin_file' as  ./any_bin_file, we
refer to the file named '_' as ./_ (the file '_' in current directory)

. makes the curent shell read  the specified file and interpret it (so
it expects valid  shell commands, obviously). so lets  say you changed
your .bashrc and you wanted your  current shell to use the variables /
shell code in it, you can do:

. .bashrc

coming back to the topic, for ease of understanding lets rephrase:

echo '. ./bomb & . ./bomb' > ./bomb; . ./bomb

What does ./bomb contain? It contains what the echo wrote into it:

. ./bomb & . ./bomb

You just  have to  note that each  .  ./bomb  results in ".   ./bomb &
. ./bomb" (two ". ./bomb" parallely).  A chain reaction sets up hence.

Also note that you need not have to run this fork bomb as root. Even a
user  who has  a  pretty large  / no  limit  for nproc  can bomb  your
machine. Try it if you want ;)

Are there scripts that use many levels of forking for system 
maintenance, and what would be a reasonable setting for ulimit -S ?

BTW, what other bombs are there that we should be aware of and guard 
against?

calling ulimit is one way.  Having  PAM set the limit before it spawns
a login shell is much more better  if the user is going to use a shell
which does not  use /etc/profile (or ulimit itself need  not be a part
of that  shell - as  far as  I know, its  a built-in in  most shells).


For doing it  through PAM, there is the  pam_limits module which helps
you do  this.  On debian,  /etc/pam.d/login lists a  nicely documented
pam_limits entry.  It explains where limits.conf can be found, etc.,.

I can't  think of  any scripts  that do many-levels  of forking  and I

forking :)

,----

`----

as such 'bomb's, I dont know. But there are lots of ways things can be
exploited.   programs that  assume a  lot of  things can  generally be
attacked   -  assuming   environment  variables,   user   input,  file
permissions, etc.,. can be exploited.

Now I  realize this is getting  us to a completely  a different topic:
secure programming :)

Looks like there are not less than three places where we can impose 
restrictions.
/etc/profile
/etc/security/limits.conf
/etc/pam.d/login  - there were no comments in my distro and I am not 
sure how this helps.
But before going there:
I set # ulimit -S 200 and bravely tried the echo, and ended up with a 
hangup, but with echo statements that said something like "..fork: 
resource temporarily unavailable" before the hangup.  Have you tried 
ulimit and does setting it really terminate processes after the limit set?

A system that is well configured should survive the test script without 
crashing or hanging, so that we can assure ourselves that we are 
reasonably well guarded.  

Thanks.

Like I mentioned earlier, two things  use ulimit to set the limits and
be left out because there could be shells that dont obey /etc/profile

OR use PAM.

/etc/security/limits.conf happens to be  the configuration file of the
pam_limits  module. Whether  you want  to  use pam_limits  or not,  is
determined by /etc/pam.d/login (or /etc/pam.d/<prog_that_uses_pam>).

ULIMIT setting - but is commented out and contains a value of :

	What number should I use that is sane ? Is 200 or so, ok ?

I tried # ulimit -u 20.  This did not allow apache 1.3.12 to serve http 
requests. It also crashed my mozilla browser.  I switched to Apache 
1.3.20, which managed to serve text without graphics at this level, and 
did not crash my browser. # ulimit -u 200 looks reasonable on my system. 
If you have trouble, increase the processes limit.  Programs invoked 
from the shell terminal give feedback when limit is exceeded.  But 
others simply vanish from the screen.  I am not sure if some log keeps 
count of processes. Generally, by trial and error we can find a 
comfortable level that will not hang the system and keep it usable.

HP did a research project called Dynamo back in the 90's that watched
execution patterns of native binaries and reordered instructions,
unrolled loops, etc.  Some research papers were published, but no
software was released for public consumption.  Transmeta's Code Morphing
software does JIT of a different kind.

But note that most of todays Out of Order Execution processors already
do simple JIT optimisation on the hardware.  I suppose optimising native
executables using JITs will make a lot of difference on platforms like
IA-64.

I hope to be there.  God knows, I haven't attended a single ilugc
meeting in several months :(

Can some kind soul spare me a copy of fedora core 1 (or better still,
slackware 9.2) if possible?  Please email me, and let me know how many
blank CDs I should bring to the meet.

Dear Arvind,

Thank you for your mail.

As the person who leads IBM's Linux business, I appreciate your sentiments
and would be equally concerned about the implications, if any. Hence we
took a hard look at the ad which was run by one of our Business Partners.

Please  be assured that the intent was definitely not to imply anything
negative about Linux. However, your feedback as a viewer is important, and
we have taken due note of your comments which will be conveyed to the right
people.

As you are aware, IBM is the forerunner in promoting Linux as a credible
and desirable alternative among operating systems. In fact, we ourselves
have a Linux Desktop offering which is very popular in it's own right.
Hence we take such feedback seriously and will pay more attention to these
angles in the future.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I speak only for myself, but as a long time linux user I believe
my opinions are fairly typical of the linux community.

IBM has in recent years been using and supporing linux on the
server side. We think this is great. On the other hand IBM has
always sold desktop systems with Microsoft Windows. We think
that's your prerogative.

This is with reference to the recent ad comparing the IBM laptop with
the Compaq Presario. Apart from how the ad stands with respect to
the Comparative Advertising law, what irks us is the (intentional)
implication that linux is inferior to windows and Compaq is in some
way duping its customers by selling them linux systems.

We know that this is not true. You know that it is not true. The
ad exploits the relative lack of familiarity of the general public
with linux and open source and tries to create a fear of the unknown.
As you know very well, we call this FUD [1].  It certainly leaves a
bad taste in the mouth. We feel that IBM is hitting below the belt.

Even though IBM has so far promoted only MS-windows based desktop
systems, this might change soon in the future. In fact it appears
that this might have already started happening. In any case,
considering the astounding rate at which the effort to make linux
desktop-ready has progressed, it is clear that change is only a
matter of time.

Obviously, any company whose business strategy includes open source
would benefit greatly from being in the good books of the open
source community. Considering that the linux community has a long
memory, it is in your own long term interest to play fair with us.

So we request you to stop running this ad, and refrain from running
such biased ads in the future.

Thank you
Sincerely,
Arvind Narayanan
IIT Madras

Typo sorry.  9.1 all right ...

In fact I deeply regret that I won't be able to come to the meet (going 
out of town today afternoon, back on monday)

Please burn them for me by all means.  I can be reached at 98410 15780

From: Ma Siva Kumar 

zha-kaNini project has completed the translation of KDE desktop. The
100% tamil desktop in unicode will be available in all distributions
when they start bundling KDE 3.2 which is to be released by the end of
January 2004. (The translated messages have been SENT to KDE project
for cvs commit)This is the second major part of zha-kanini. The first
part OpenOffice has been completed and released in November 2003.  We
have also completed the Red Hat components, which will be committed to
Red Hat CVS.

This work is made possible by the following contributors:

1. The base built by the open source application developers and
earlier translators for tamil notably Sivakumar Shanmugasundaram,
Gomathi Shanmugasundaram, Vaseeharan and Dinesh Nataraja.

2. Writer Sujatha - he introduced computers to lakhs of tamil youth by
writing about computer way back in the mid-eighties. His active
interest is what enabled us to mobilise volunteers and complete the
task. He continues to inspire us.

3. R Sashidhar - He lost count of his days and dates during the past
one month. He administered the task of giving out the files to be
translated and organising them. But for his tireless work and
commitment we will not be writing this mail now.

4. J Jayaradha - She is the motivator. She went from college to
college to get support. When MOP Vaishnava and Loyola pledged
volunteer support, she was the inspiration for the students to come in
every morning and do the translation.

5. Students of MOP Vaishnava and Loyola college who spend their time
in this creative effort. They surprised all of us by their enthusiasm
and hard work.

6. Mr. Suri of Dishnet DSL provided the computer facilities (20
computers) for the translation work. Mr Suri personally came down one
sunday and talked to the volunteers.

7. Chandran of Ambalam spent considerable amount of time at
translation center to provide support to the students' queries on
technical terms.

8. Volunteers who sacrificed their Sunday's rest and came
enthusiastically for marathon sessions.

9. Gopikrishna and Siddharth who got the files through email and did
their part.

10.  Sponsors of Lunch for translators Dr Saravanakumar, C K
Shanthakumar, Sashidhar, Srinivasan, Balamurali, Ashok Kumar, C R
Lakshmi Narasimhan, Chandran, S Ramanathan, Ma Sivakumar, Bharath
Ramasubramaniam, Bharathi S.

zha-kanini team will be showcasing a Red Hat Linux system with Tamil
interface in the third week of January in Chennai.  Now the stage is
set for any tamil entrepreneur to assemble a Tamil PC and market it to
the Tamil speaking community.  There is a lot to be done. Bharathi is
co-ordinating the efforts to standardise the tamil input methods for
the zha-Kanini. A tool to co-ordinate future translation efforts is
under preparation. 

We welcome everyone interested to join hands to carry the work
forward.

The fb of Suraj and Logu are taken good care by a sane ulimit -u 
setting, and the fb becomes fork joke.  But consider this: The jargon 
file gives a simpler fork bomb example:

# |($0 & $0| |&)|

||

$0 will spawn bash processes.

|# echo $0     # what is $0
/bin/bash
|

|Setting ulimit -u does not prevent forking till the limit is reached. 
 Suppose ulimit -u is set to 200, though our system remains usable, more 
than 90% of CPU is used by ($0 & $0 &)  A better solution is required 
for this fb.  Improper requests to the shell may have to be filtered and 
validated before execution.

Hi All,

I use a Red Hat 9.0 with a GVC 33600 external modem and dial up for "internet" access. I configured the wvdial.conf file and well it connects to net. But i have feeling the config file is not all that ummmm okay. 

Can anyone pass on thier wvdial.conf file (with the user name and password blanked out :) ) which works under similar set up - red hat 9.0 + External modem - dial up.

Cheers,

hello
 
i am mailing this from India.
i have loaded Dragon Linux V2 full on a computer with AMD K6/200mhz, 128mb RAM, 9GB hard disk. 
The monitor uses a SiS 6215 SVGA card. i think this is giving problems 
while loading the GUI. The GUI is loaded but the desktop lookss very bad, and the desktop goes outside the monitor area.the colours are also not that clear. i think maybe the resolution is the problem, but fiddling with xf86config or etc/XF86Config is of no use.
could you please tell me how to change the settings so that i can get 
the resolution right? 
i learnt that SiS 6215 drivers are unavailable and hence selected SiS 
SG86C215 in xf86config and chose option no 3 for XF86_SVGA card drivers, but still no use.
i would be much grateful to get any help re this problem 
 
thanks

Note that  doing fork bomb  using the shell  is one such way.   If you
searched  enough on  the web,  you would  have also  seen a  much more
"powerful" C equivalent. besides, the nproc value is largely dependant
on  your working  habits.  I  use 90  for a  pure  console environment

Hey

What version of X do you use?  If you use anything greater than 4.x,
try:

# XFree86 -configure
# XFree86 -xf86config /root/XF86Config.new
---- If you're not satisfied with the display, edit the file ----
# cp /root/XF86Config.new /etc/X11/XF86Config

If you're using an old version of X (probably 3.3.6 or something like
that), try:

# xf86config

Of course.  I just wanted to avoid mail asking- what is $0?  In ($0 & $0

($0 & $0 &) uses up the process limit.  Imagine emacs in the place of

Thanks.  

Please forward me the bounce message.

And tell me if your mailservers IP is a static IP or a dynamic IP.

For spam filtering issues that reference http://spamblock.outblaze.com, you
can reach me or one of my staff members at postmaster@outblaze.com - that
mail id is not filtered and should not bounce.

never mind mailing postmaster@outblaze.com - I found the reason by querying
the IP for daisy.midascomm.com in your headers.

Refer to http://spews.org/ask.cgi?S2080 

Your ISP dishnet dsl is blocked there (and elsewhere) because they are
hosting some notorious american v*gra / p*rn etc spammers on a regular basis.

Hmm.. looks like with all the outsourcing coming into india, spammers are
also outsourcing their operation to indian companies, and getting hosting
from Indian ISPs who are too stupid to know or care where their money is
coming from.

What makes it worse is that dishnet dsl is my isp at home as well .. I
haven't had much luck trying to tell their support department they are being
blocked because of spam issues, and could I please have a mail admin contact
me about this.  Maybe you might have slightly better luck.

And let me know if your IP for daisy.midascomm.com 61.11.74.47 is a static IP
- if so, I will specifically exempt it from our filters.

Even then I'd suggest that you route your outbound mail through some other
ISP's servers (I see you have five MX servers on different ISPs .. primus,
sify, tenet's network etc - so you don't have shortage of smarthosts, and you
could use smtp auth if your daisy IP is dynamic so that you can't just relay
for that IP at one of your other mailservers)

Thats there, but the downtime that your server faced might mean $$, to
some. Protetion  is of  importance (so is  the case with  viruses, for
thats the topic we were dealing  with). There are a million cures (one
of which is, even, reinstallation!).

try this:

# ($0 & $0 &)
# top

You would see that more than 96% of your CPU is running bash, and you 
know the reason.  I did not try emacs in the place of $0, but a more 
heavy program would consume more resources.  Closing the bash terminal 
is an instant cure, but if you leave it running, it does interefere and 
crash other programs.  The fb sample in the jargon file is more 
dangerous than the echo fb you pointed that terminates within the shell 
after crossing the process limit.

f better options are not available, this is the only option that will 
save the $$.  Of course, there ought to be cures.  For all I know, one 
could sell a single int value: the reasonable setting for ulimit -u may 
have a commercial value ;-)  I still remember the days I lived without 
computers - they were far simpler :-) I hope we can have 100% robust and 
protected systems.

Another doubt. Is Slack 9.1 a 3 CD version? I got slack9.1 burnt by a friend in 2 CD's. What is there in 3rd CD?

chk to see if ur last line of /etc/inittab file has
the following line:

x:5:respawn:/etc/X11/prefdm -nodaemon

You can also (try-no gaurantee)  remove this line to
disable X from booting.backup files before changing

I indeed mailed the ipadmin a list of their IPs being happy open relays.

the huge number of open relays and open proxy servers on their network is a
gigantic security problem - right.

but the huge number of spammers hosting with them is the sign of a policy
enforcement problem ... or rather the sign of complete absence of anything
that could be termed as policy.

If you are dishnet customers - I'd suggest you yell at your contacts there
about this.

chk out man wvdial.conf. A default script is
shown.hack it to ur use(change ph no,etc)
I use the same modem(think its GVC 5600 tho).
You will have to pass the No dial Tone Init to dial
out.Otherwise it says "No dialtone".
Think the Init is ATX1(not sure,see man)(Sridhar was
also asking me about it).

remove the servers that come with Red Hat.No home user
uses them. 
Mplayer,Xine,Xmms should be enough for
entertainment.The 'K' utils that come packed are of no
use, unless all u want is to play Ogg and Mp3 files on
different players.

GNOME 2.4
KDE 3.1 for new users.

GNOME as default, like RedHat does. 
also try including the video drivers from ATi and
NVIDIA.

FVWM-only for the Win look, else GNOME again.

again, GNOME

ext2 is supported by older disk tools.
received complaints from friends who could not detect
ext3 in PartitionMagic 7 and other legacy disk tools.
ext3 is faster for me (???)

try a kernel only installations.
its basically a update installation of red Hat 9 but
just select only the kernel in the software selection
screen.
i.e dont select any other packages.

I tried this once on a Red Hat 6.2 installation, it
worked.Also use it as a last resort kind of solution.

Its ugly, but if u have no other hope, ugly is
beautiful.

Also this way u can re-install the boot loader.Also
try LILO its much more newbish friendly.
cheers,

hi ,
i'm having windows 2k professional in C & D drive.
and RH 9 linux in another partition. I'm not getting
the bootloader option while booting. i got a
solution from lug, but it didn't work.i would have
also done some mistake.pls bear with me.
The solution  from lug is as follows (as i did)
i booted with RH 9 Cd 1 in linux and i typed, 'linux
rescue' in boot prompt and pressed enter.
it asked for the keyboard type (us) and setup
networking (no). And the chroot screen came and it 
prompted that the 'system has mounted under the
/mnt/sysimage'. i pressed 'ok'. Then it went into a 
shell where i gave 'chroot /mnt/sysimage'. and again
in the prompt i gave, 'grub-install /dev/hda' but it 
prompted with an error "invalid option --i" . To came
out of the shell i gave "exit exit" . the system 
rebooted. But no bootloader ooption camewith luv,

viju

take care

have a nice day

bye.

hey all,

I'll try to keep this short cause its 4 am and I badly
need sleep.

Ever tried benchmarking Linux.
Was browsing on Tucows and stumbled upon this
benchmarking tool that provides a rough summary of the
linux box u r running.

its available at:
http://www.bitmover.com/lmbench/

No OpenGl tests though,so bad news for game-geeks.

however people, run it under init 3 and set practical
values for the tests.

Its still in Alpha, so beware.ran fine for me though.
would post my scores(nanoseconds actually) if only my
head stopped falling back from sleep.

do post your scores and we could see who has the
"killa-box"

cheers,
toufeeq

Yes, I do have a SiS card (6326), my older card was 6215.  I would
suggest you to download the 4.x X servers (either source or binary) and
give a try.  They definitely support SiS cards with good display
resolutions.

Hi,

Hope you remember me, Rajendran, from Xerago, where you had graced
the
occasion by giving a splendid lecture on the spirit of Open Source.

I need some urgent help, and I found none other better suited to help
me
with it than you both.
We are urgently looking for a PHP-programmer, someone who can
re-engineer
and build on an already existing open-source-codebase of a PHP-based
software.
We will be interested in recruiting him / her full-time into Xerago
if found
good.

Can you help us in this search?

Thanks.

Rajendran.

This GTK theme engine uses the currently selected QT

Currently the code is very buggy and incomplete - a
few widgets do not yet use the QT drawing code.
However it is still perfectly usable. This theme is
slightly slower than that of most native GTK themes,
but the difference is hardly noticed on a fast
machine.

ok. I've heard this often enough.

ok just some additional info.you might have already
done it, just double check anyway.

Resolutions also depend on the type of monitor
selected.
So if u select a 800 x 600 monitor and try 1024 x 768
, you wont get it.
just check if the resolution of the video card and the
monitor are compatible.

I used SiS cards long back, SiS6202 i think, had
problems getting those drivers.will lookout for them
and pass them on if I come across them.
cheers,

Atleast "their" installer isn't robust enough! I've myself seen many a
installations aborting in the middle just because they couldn't read a
file from the cdrom, or something like that printing out the infamous
error messages:

	Sending kill signals...
	Sending termination signals...
	...

That was one major reason my friend installed Debian woody (I suggested
him to) on his system unable to do away with RedHat!

dear Mr. Gopal
 
thanks for taking the time to reply.
 
i use XFree86 3.3.6. 
and yes i have tried xf86config. i have gone through the rigmarole of configuring the X server, but the resolution is not quite there.
i presume there is a problem in the linux support for SiS . (i remember learnt that this might be a bug in the Linux driver for this particular brand of video cards)
hence i would be grateful if any one using SiS video cards under linux could point me towards the website where they got the drivers or how they were able to get the correct display
 
many thanks in advance

What version of X do you use? If you use anything greater than 4.x,
try:

If you're using an old version of X (probably 3.3.6 or something like
that), try:

# xf86config

Subject: Advanced Bash Scripting Guide, version 2.3 update

Announcing the version 2.3 release of the "Advanced Bash Scripting Guide."
This e-book tutorial and reference is the equivalent of a 600-page print book.
With 280 illustrative examples, the book covers virtually every aspect of
scripting.

This e-book now contains printable reference cards, just like commercially
available computer tutorials.


The author invites comparisons with *any* of the commercially printed books on
shell scripting. His aim was to write "best of category" documentation.

          "This  tutorial  assumes  no previous knowledge of
           scripting or programming, but progresses rapidly  toward an
           intermediate/advanced level of instruction ...all the while
           sneaking in little snippets of UNIX wisdom and lore. It serves
           as a textbook, a manual for self-study, and  a  reference
           and source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques. The
           exercises and heavily-commented  examples invite active reader
           participation, under the premise that the only way to really
           learn scripting is to write scripts."
                -- from the Introduction

# Minutes of the ILUGC Meet Sat 10th Jan 2003 #
###############################################

Please forgive any names that I have missed - I have a bad memory
especially for names :-)!!

The official agenda for the meet was 

Topic  :  Virus Filtering using a GNU/LINUX Gateway.
Speaker:  Mr KM.Ganesh

The meet started in Midea Labs Aisa Conf Hall (Last min change due to
key problem) as usual - maybe a bit early at about 3.00 or so with
about 10 people with more people trickling in till 3:30 (as usual
:-)).
	
After getting feedback from the list ,Mr.Ganesh decided to keep the
talk as practical as possible. He started off with the basics,with the
types of malware. Malware is categorized into

1. Host Dependent('live' on systems):
	
a. Logic Bomb: These come into effect when some wrong input is given 
to the software in question.
		
b. Viruses: Viruses have three basic 'actions':

i) Search and Infect (Search for and infect the targetted app or
file,for example search for and attach itself into the explorer.exe or
excel.exe or something like that.
			
ii)Trigger: What actually activates the virus, example - open that
mail with vbscript in a lame(!) mail client like outlook express.
			
iii)Payload: What it actually does! Mail itself to everyone in your
addressbook, or delete windows and install linux for you (you wish!!).
			
2. Host Independent('lives' on the network):

a. Bacteria: These basically use up resources such as your ram or hard
disk space, filling it up with junk.

b. Worms: These quite essentially live on the network, a typical
example being MSBlaster.
	
MSBlaster used a buffer overflow hole in some DCOM RPC thingy in
windows.  The exploit was known for the past six months, but so far
had no malware exploiting it, until blaster. After is exploited the
hole it downloads a copy of itself from the compromising system and
proceeds to look for other systems to infect.

The ports 135,137,etc are primarily used. The problem with exploiting
a windows system is that even after breaking into the system,
whereupon we have a command prompt available - pretty much nothing can
be done with it, because hardly any tools are available to do
anything. Also, the command prompt that is available at this juncture
is a 16 bit prompt,i.e. only 16 bit apps are available.

A number of apps, such as telnet and ftp which can be used for
transfer are unavailable as they are 32 bit apps. Though the ftp tool
which is command line seems to be a dos app in windows NT/2k, it is
actually a 32 bit app which runs in the dos prompt thanks to some 32
emulation. So, the only tool which 'may' be available that can be used
is the tftp app, which is what blaster used.

Well, thats enough about windows !!

Something I forgot to mention - there are currently 40 known viruses
for linux - though most of them are 'proof-of-concept', they are not
known in the wild and not 'successfull'.

Coming to Virus Filtering in Linux, there are basically three 'places'
where filtering can be done,

	1. Mail(in Sendmail, etc)
	2. File(Samba)
	3. Web(in Squid or Apache(with mod_proxy)
	
1. Mail Filtering - Mail filtering can be done in three levels:

a. SMTP level-in the gateway itself.The problem with this method is
that notification of the user that a virus has been detected is not
easy, hence not used much.
		
b. MTA level-Most popular. A number of solutions exist for this level
of filtering.Examples are 'Amavis', 'Mail Scanner',etc.
		
c. LDA(Local Delivery Agent) level-example. used with procmail, Used
for local delivery of messages,i.e. to another user on that same
system. This again is not used very much.

The focus was hence mainly on the MTA level solutions. Some of te
popular solutions are Amavis and Mail Scanner.
		
-- Amavis:
	
One of the popular ones in Amavis (A Mail VIrus Scanner). Amavis
consists of a number of different components:

a. amavis-perl: provides command line filter - works with procmail.

b. amavisd: the daemon

c. amavisd-new: a fork of the daemon. This can filter viruses, works
with spamassasin, and custom content filtering.

d. amavis-ng: filters viruses.

General Operation is as follows: 

The scanner picks up the mail from the incoming queue of the MTA, and
scans the mail for viruses,spams, and other custom filters. Then the
mail is sent to the outgoing queue of the MTA if no virus is detected.
If there is a virus ,then a mail is sent ot the sender,reciever and
admin(depending upon the config). Sometimes the headers(sender) get
spoofed by worms, and Ganesh said that he had disabled the 'send to
sender' option because of this.

The Amavis scanner usually listens on the 10,025 port. After it scans
the messages it puts them in the queue directory of the MTA. The queue
runner checks the queue dir for messages periodically, and then
processes them.
		
The amavisd-new scanner can invoke more than one virus scanner, and
integrates well with sendmail,postfix, qmail,etc and even has an
inbuilt smtp server.

The scanner is independent of the virus scanner. The only open source
virus scanner is CLAM. This virus scanner is called by amavis.

2. File Filtering:
		
File filtering is used with Samba mainly. The scanning can be done in
the Samba VFS or Unix VFS. Scanning is mainly done as 'on-access
scanning',i.e. on open,close,save,etc.

For Unix VFS scan, a kernel module has to compiled in  DAZUKO. 

This module inserts hooks into the kernel to call the virus
scanner(which is in userspace ofcourse). The test is usually done with
the eicar.com virus(which is the standard test for all
 virus scanners). 

SambaVFS scanning can be used for scanning in Samba.

The problem with scanning on samba is that notification of users that
there is a virus that is detected is a problem, as there is no option
in the protocol for messaging the user. So, samba just tells the user
that access is denied or some such equally cryptic windows error
message(I'd personally vote for a BSOD!).

There are some hackup jobs to fix this problem - one is to use Jabber,
installed in all machines and message the user about the virus, or
else to use an app called winpopup-to popup a dialog box in the user's
screen.

But, file scanning usually results in a quite a bit of I/O and cpu
usage. So certain directories should be excluded as necessary.

3. Web Filtering:
		
Web filtering through the Squid proxy server(of http and ftp was
talked about. A number of problems exist in this area. There is no
proper notification system which exists in the http and ftp protocols.
	
Also when a file that is being downloaded, the file cannot be scanned
until it is fully retrieved. However if no data is sent to the client,
that connection may die - therefore 'TRICKLE'ing is used, where a
small amount of data is sent to the user so as to keep the connection
alive, while the proxy server downloads the file to its own buffer.
Once the file has been downloaded and scanned, it is sent to the user.

Another problem is that resuming cannot be done, when this sort of
scanning is done.

Some proprietary solutions exist in check point firewalls(CVP
protocol) - where, when a file download is requested, the file data is
not sent to the user ,but instead a html file is sent, with the status
of the download, and finally when the download is complete and has
been scanned, a link to the file is provided. The problem with this
approach is that when wget is used, we will end up downloading the
html file instead of the file data. Another approach to this is ICAP
(Internet Content Adaption Protocol).

Antivirus Solutions:

Opensource : CLAM 

Proprietary (usually with per user licenses) : Trend, Kaspersky,
mcafee,antivir,sophos,etc.

Also there was a lot of talk about Spam and Spam handling.  There are
a number of blacklists that are maintained, which contain IPs which
are originators of large amounts of spam.  Bharathi related how his
mail to srs got declared as spam because of Dishnet being in the
blacklist.

There was also a short and interesting discussion about the kernel
source getting compromised recently.  In that case, a equivalency
testing(==) was changed to an assignment(=), and an attemp was made to
check in this. Howver, this was detected and corrected.  Also a point
was made of the possibility of some other such hole in the 10 million
lines of code that is the kernel source. Also a reference was made to
a guy(sorry forgot the name) who proved that it was possible to hack
the compiler to insert code into a otherwise clean source of ,say the
kernel.
	
There was an announcement by Mr Venki@Collabnet - saying that Mr.Brian
Founder of Apache, was visiting India(for the LinuxAsia meet) and also
interested in meeting some of the people in the local LUG during his
Chennai visit. Date and Place is yet be decided.

There was also an announcement by Bharathi, saying that he would not
be able to attend the meets on 2nd saturdays because of work.  So It
was decided that meets would probably be shifted to 1st/3rd week of
each month.

The meet dissolved by around 6:30, with some stragglers hanging
around. Overall it was cool!! :-)

please see my followup in this thread, some days earlier, about why we 
are blocking dishnet from our network.

is 61.11.74.47 a static IP?

Arre baba, if you get a corrupt package in the middle of an install .. 
something will be definitely broken if you continue to install it.

At least redhat has some sanity checking for that.

Now, again, what is not all that robust about a properly installed 
redhat system?

Its not the case always. For eg. let us consider the situation that 
package A is corrupt and there are no packages depending on it.  Why 
would you need to abort the installation of the OS for that package. Why 
cant the installer proceed?? Even in the case of dependencies the onus 
is on the installer to remove the packages dependent on the corrupt 
package.
I had this experience in Fedora Core 1.
Still wondering why RedHat is refusing to pack apt as a frontend to 
their rpm package manager????

61.11.x.x series are used for Dishnet DSL service, IAC.

Dishnet is running  open relays and hosting P*rn  sites. Its high time
to complain.  But how. Just after we  switch to Dishnet ISP,  I send a
mail to abuse@eth.net & ip-admin@ddsl.net. But no help. :(

A mass memorandum or mass petition may help ... don't know !!

Not that way. Contact the dishnet customer service people ... escalate 
to their manager and scream at them.

Message-ID: <200401130507.KAA07023@WS0005.indiatimes.com>

Hi!,


----------------------
i use XFree86 3.3.6. 
and yes i have tried xf86config. i have gone through the rigmarole of configuring the X server, but the resolution is not quite there.
i presume there is a problem in the linux support for SiS . (i remember learnt that this might be a bug in the Linux driver for this particular brand of video cards)
hence i would be grateful if any one using SiS video cards under linux could point me towards the website where they got the drivers or how they were able to get the correct display
-----------------------

4 years ago (time flies!), I faced this problem. The drivers for the chipset are there in the source tree. But they do not check for the proper device id - 204 for SiS 6215c . With a little bit of tweaking you can get it to work. 

Since I did this a long time ago, there might be some rough edges.

1. Get the source tree (XFree86 - 3.3.x should be fine)
2. go through the vga.h in hw/xfree86/ .

There are 2 ways to do this:

1. the quick way is to change the device id for an existing chipset - eg: change the value of SG86_C201 or SG86_C205 to 204 in vga.h  and rebuild the server (it helps to build from a cutdown (server only) tree) . While configuring, choose SG201 or 205 depending upon what u modified previously.

2. the more correct way is to add a new line such as SG86_C204 and set its value to 204 . - this needs to be added in quite a few places including the chipset detection code (in the SiS directory) - sorry for being so vague - I lost the patch file . But if u are a C programmer, fixing this is not a big problem (and an interesting exercise too!)

oh and btw, 

all of the above worked for me and a few of my friends. so in case u manage to fry your chipset doing this - DO NOT SUE  ME !!!

cheers,

Hi

Fedora core 1 has yum in it and up2date recognises yum repositries. you 
can always use yum and apt-get for older versions of redhat too.

   Lot more!  For example, how to do you install
packages _individually_ instead installing in groups
(both in RedHat and in Fedora).

   Please submit _lot_ of usability-bug reports at RedHat.

A RedHat system is robust as long as it is properly installed &
configured. The sad thing is that they are trying to give a M$ Windows
like `look and feel'. 

The major advantage I found on debian was speed. I guess that was
because woody uses by default 2.2.x kernels. But 2.4.x kernels are
considered to be the most popular. Dunno why they make the machine
slower. 

Cheers,
Joe

" Initialization String " to "ATX1" and
" Dial String           " to "ATDT".

Anyway thanks for the help which u send for me.

   Slackware is (I guess) by default much speeder than
debian (not woody, but the latest).

   Not sure abt the kernel.  But gtk+1.x is usually
much faster than gtk+2.x.  Have you tried linux2.6
with pre-emptable support?

oh.. but I tried installing a 2.4.18 kernel that comes along with
`woody' and still it was sad. It wasnt as sad as RH9.0 but still it
was sad. 2.4 kernels are a bit slower than 2.2.

I've 2.6.1 sources. Havent tried them out yet.. no time to try them :(
Should try it soon.

I read some reviews on that., and heard it performs really well.

Cheers,
Joe

Dear members,

While KPPP provides a nice GUI for dial-ups etc, I am sure that there 
must aslo be some command line utility/program/way to do the same thing 
- viz, dialing up to the Internet. Can anyone enlighten me about this?

Think we are more interested in the fully functioning
RedHat installation.

Any Installation process has its drawbacks.Recently
made a "trip to hell and back" when I tried to install
FreeBSD.

I would vouch for RedHAt's robustness too. Its not too
newb-ish !Mand..! and at the same time doesnt need
micromanagement !Slack..!.

Have'nt tried Fedora yet.

Hi,

Looks like I dint install the kernel source during  installation.

How do I find out the name and location of the package?

After that how do I Install the package?

I have looked at the manpages, but I am bit confused.

you need some kind of interface to pppd, if only pon / poff etc. 
Otherwise it can be more than a bit painful.

Hi,
thx for the info.

My ethernet card is not supported by drivers provided by debian and I
downloaded the intel driver, via windows (as I have no net connectivity in
Linux because of the driver problem)

I have the 7cds ( debian woody 3.0 r2 including international cd)? Which of
the cds is the source cds?
Maybe I can specify this in /etc/apt/sources.list and then get the source
from the cd.

I need a minimum of 2.4.x kernel for the driver to work.

Thanks,
Sanjay

apt-cache search; apt-cache show  (in general, man apt-cache). apt-get
install  apt-howto;  apt-get  install  dpkg-dev  (some  parts  of  the

also man dpkg (dpkg -S, specifically)

No. 2.4 is faster than 2.2.  You probably have a speed block somewhere 
else. Gtk2 has a slower feel to it because the screen drawing in double

2.6 has several performance enhancements. combined with prelinking in 
fedora core 2 in april it should really make a big difference.

Specific enhancements

O(1) scheduler
preemptible kernel processes
Interactivity cleanups and big lock fixes
Enhancements in VM manager and so on.

If you want the rpms you can google it out.

Distributions with 2.6

Fedora core 2 - april
Mandrake 10 - feb
Slackware - current branch
debian - no comments
Redhat enterprise edition - 2005
Novell -  2005 Q2

$ apt-cache search kernel | grep source

This will give you a list like the one below
kernel-source-2.4.18 - Linux kernel source for version 2.4.18
kernel-source-2.2.20 - Linux kernel source for version 2.2.20

Debian have intel ethernet card drivers. 

/lib/modules/2.4.18-1-686/kernel/drivers/net/eepro.o
/lib/modules/2.4.18-1-686/kernel/drivers/net/eepro100.o
/lib/modules/2.4.18-1-686/kernel/drivers/net/eexpress.o

But I have  heard Intel NICs perform bad  in GNU/Linux. RedHat detects
Intel   NICs  while   installing  itself,   but  show   problem  while
working. Its a driver issue IAC. Anybody have it working with out much
problems.

I use pppd, never had problems with it. Just took somebody's
script from the net and filled in my values. Easy.

pon.1: "pon can be used to run multiple, simultaneous PPP connections".
Surely the average user doesn't have a burning need to do that?!

Actually eepro nics are not that bad ... now if you had said something

pon can just as well be used to run a single pppd connection.

and it makes a decent frontend.

now there is the chicken and egg problem of having to go online in order

To get custom output like this 00:00:05:23, this is 
the easy way. Otherwise parse the output of uptime.

The e100 driver is available in source form in the non-free part of debian

Download the source, make it and then copy the driver to 
/lib/modules/your.kernel.version/kernel/drivers/net/

Then modprobe and insmod the driver, or run debian's modconf utility to 
install it.

You should then be all set.

If you get errors trying to compile the driver, post the errors.

Hello,

Download source from Intel
unpack with tar -zxvf e100*
cd e100*  (ensure correct kernel headers installed.)
make  (to get e100.o)
su to root
copy e100.0 to /lib/modules/2.4.18-bf24/kernel/drivers/net/
run modconf
install e100

Hmm seems pretty easy. Give a try.

PS: found this in google in 1st page itself.

Hi,
Installed kernel-source-2.4.18 using apt-get install.

When I try to install driver, I get the error message: kernel source not
found

When I looked at the directory for the kernel source:

I see the source archived in .bz2 format.

After unpacking, do I have to recompile the kernel?

btw, what does the bf extension in the name for kernel stand for? (The
kernel image that is installed when you select 2.4 kernel during
installation of Woody)

debian seems pretty interesting. wondering why I did not install it earlier

Thanks,
Sanjay

But I have  heard Intel NICs perform bad  in GNU/Linux. RedHat detects
Intel   NICs  while   installing  itself,   but  show   problem  while
working. Its a driver issue IAC. Anybody have it working with out much
problems.


Sanjay:

I did not have problem with my ethernet card ( Intel Pro 100 VE) in RedHat
9. detected during install and have used it for a couple of months without
problem.

The driver needs some kernel headers. There are two ways to obtain the

Hi,

Get the following message: no screens found. Using X 4.0.1.

Think the problem lies with my Intel 845 card, which needs Xfree 4.3 for
full support.
I guess I would have to upgrade my X windows to 4.3 using apt-get

I checked the installed packages and found :

xfree86-common
xserver-xfree86
xwindow-system

and a few other x related packages (which I think may not be relevant)

What are the packages that I need to upgrade for upgrading X so that I may
use the latest drivers?

Thanks,
Sanjay

xserver-xfree86  provides the  server.  xclients-base and  xfonts-base

ok the problem was that Free BSD installer,did not
detect the logocal drive I had alloted for it.

The FDISK utility that is packed along with the
installation fails to do recognize the free space
present in a extended partition a.k.a the logical
drive.

So, I had to google for a day for a utility that
extracts the free space from the extended partition
and  puts it out as a different partition.

Finally gave in and installed PartitionMAgic 8 which
solved the problem.

Also another problem was that Free BSD doe not display
the size of the ports/packages that are installed.
This leads to a state of risk, where people who have
allotted less disk space cant make up their mind about
what packages to install.

Also it does not check whether  the size of all the
packages will fit into the alloted partition.

Finally though, I'm happy, got a stable UNIX OS on my
system and its great fun learning it.

so you see, Anaconda is not bad after all..

Cheers,
Toufeeq

The VE driver is already in later 2.4 kernels (2.4.20+ I think).

Upgrading to the latest 2.4.x kernel is not a bad idea since it also
fixes some recent bugs.

Thanks for the info.  I decline to use debian, and I haven't used that card,

The solution is right there in the error message.
It is up to you to actually read it rather than just copy and paste it to the

I am not sure. if you run a gui it might be that. 2.4 might have had a 
bumpy ride earlier on but nobody called it slower than 2.2 before. you 
might want to check out specifics in #kernelnewbies channel

I've had instances where they would arbitrarily block IP pools for SMTP
traffic especially if it belonged to another ISP! Their customer support
also seemed to use their network as a learning experience tinkering with
network settings at will at the cost of hapless customers. They are surely
pretty hard to get to for anything to be set right. If it were to do with
relaying and configurations, particularly so.

Warm regards

Scream at their manager ??
He is not even ready to talk to his customers.
This happened once when i had to talk to someone whom i thought I can make
them understand the problems I ha(d)ve in getting a reverse DNS setup.

May be we can get a rally organized to grab their attention?!!!?

browse.
I also configured MRTG and it is monitoring the local
interface and the graph is grnereted every 5minutes.

I want to monitor SQUID thru MRTG. I am not sure how
to proceed, I tried google and some what configured,
but it doesn't work. I had made some error, but don't
know where.

Can you plz help me how to integrate both SQUID and
MRTG.

Message-ID: <OF6A83870A.A7035946-ON65256E1D.00310C06@lntinfotech.com>

Hi,

Installed Debian woody release 2 recently. used kernel version 2.4.18
during installation by selecting bf2.4 at prompt.


Have an Intel pro 100 VE ethernet card, which is not supported by default.
downloaded the driver from Intel site and compiled it.

I had not installed the kernel source. When I searched, I found
kernel-source-2.4.18 and installed the source.

When I try to install the compiled driver using insmod it says version
mismatch: driver compiled for version 2.4.18 and ur current kernel version
is 2.4-18.bf2.4

If I do a forced insmod, it works with warning, but it looks like I have to
do it every time I reboot.

I can ping intranet addresses, but not internet addresses.

The other thing is that /etc/modules.conf does not have an alias to eth0.
If I try /sbin/ifup eth0, I get the error message : unknown interface
eth0=etc0

modprobe gives version mismatch error.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Sanjay

Did you compile it on the bf24 kernel?

Change your initscript (rc.network or whatever) to do insmod -f of your card.

Is the route to your gateway set up properly?  Did you specify the default
gateway at all?

Add the alias then!

The installer significantly underestimates the space
required. Star office is a huge package. In spite of
that 2.3GB -> 4.2GB is quite surprising.

It seems that your rc.sysinit file is not readable/executable.  Boot into 
rescue mode using redhat 1st cd and try fscking.

I have a couple of reasons against redhat.  I have an old Asus p5a-b 
motherboard and a latest 40G seagate drive.  Any redhat or redhat based 
distribution just hangs on booting the installation cd after printing the 
line "Partition check:".  

I have tried RH7.3 to 9, Fedora core 1, Mandrake 8, 9.1, 9.2 and winXP. All 
have the same problem.  If I disable DMA in bios then they function normally.   
Even if I managed to install those distros, I cant play fullscreen mpg or 
divx/xvid avis.  

I now have debian sarge installed on the same machine with DMA support on.  I 
have 2.6 kernel configured.  It's *terribly* fast.  Now I can run fullscreen 
mpg, 7xx resolution xvid/divx avis in my k6-2 450 / i740Graphics system.  

Now if you try google on finding whether a k6-2 450 processor can run 
xvid/divx avis in high resolutions (7xx), you will know that a k6-2 450 
processor having a weak FPU, cant play such things smoothly.  I am the only 
one known to me who can play a high res compressed avi fullscreen on an k6-2 
450 processor.

And it was made possible by Sarge where all other OSs failed.  

My other reason is I HATE to type redhat-config-* for all configurations.   I 
have some linux admin friends who have done rhce courses.  And without the 
redhat-config- commands, they are nothing.  I dont think redhat is trying to 
make things simpler, it is rather monopolizing - by making interacting and 
configuring the OS simpler, it is moving towards a more windows like 
distribution.  Users, who are used to the simple commands may be lost with 
other linux distros.  And since those commands are not industry standard like 
linuxconf or Xconfigurator, redhat is on its own to change those commands as 
it likes.  

RedHat is PERFECT for linux newbies, but not for others.

Debian is FAST.  Red hat is too slow.  RPM and up2date sucks.  It you are a 
home user/newbie then it is ok with redhat.  But I strongly suggest against 
redhat on corporate servers.

One can (if he is a newbie) _start_ with distros like
RedHat or Mandrake.  But he/she should not be sticking
with it for a long time.  Later he has to be
comfortable finding a more powerful distro like
'slackware', 'debian' which doesn't give any gui conf
tools or such bloated stuffs.

One way of making this happen (for newbies) is to use
your user-friendly (novice-friendly?) as your primary
OS and fiddle with those powerful distros by
installing them in another partition.  If anything
havoc happens one need not worry since it has less
chance of affecting your existing active setup.

I myself followed these ideas.  Now I am (partially)
comfortable with slackware (moved from RH, MDK).

Just my thoughts.

My dear chap, what's the difference between a RH user who can't manage 
without redhat-config-* and a debian user who is all at sea without 
eximconfig, modconf etc, and when asked to compile code, at once asks 
"is there a debian package for it?"

I agree with you.  I have never used either eximconfig or modconf.  And our 
servers, my workstation at office and my home pc are running woody/sarge.  I 
refrain from compiling the source whenever possible, not because it is easier 
to install a package, but because apt is too good.  

FYI, some months back, all our servers were running some version of RedHat 
Linux for years.  There was not a single other distro in the company.  I am 
not a long time debian user.  Compared with RedHat/Mandrake and the like 
Debian has painful installation and configuration.  

We are switching from RH to debian in our office.   RedHat is as stable and 
secure as you configure it.   We have had superb redhat servers with uptimes 
of several months.  

We switch to debian because its fast and free.  We have tried fedora but 
werent satisfied.   RedHat has abstracted a lot.  When I am running RedHat I 
have a strange feeling that I am not in control (no flames pls).

I have been using Linux for 4 years.  I have used only RedHat for 3 years 
though I have known about and tried to install debian.  Debian is worth the 
pain.  Use it to beleive it.

I fully agree about redhat not giving you control. But I feel debian 
gives you even less control, and moreover implements things differently 
(starting from different paths and names for config files etc).

Try slackware - it'll set you completely free.  And there is NO safety 
net, no abstraction etc.

Hmmm.  I have never tried slackware.  I have already decided to try Open BSD 
for our border servers as suggested by Sanjay chigurupati of ilugc list.  

How good is Slackware when compared with Debian for CVS/Mail/Apache/Tomcat etc 
servers?  Is slackware worth the move from Debian on servers??  (Please 
remember that I CANT bring down a server for maintenance just like that! ) If 
slackware is good enough may be I should try it on new deployments.  But what 
is the package manager for slack?  I dont want to miss apt-get. 

I checked planetmirror.com for slackware archives. It has 4 isos of 9.1 
slackware.  If  I'm convinced I shall proceed to download them.  

PS: I am more concerned about missing apt than missing debian.

any bsd is also a good idea. slackware / gentoo give you bsd-ish

if you have a server up and running with debian there is zero reason to 
switch to slak.

Sometimes, abstraction can be a good thing.  It helps in unifying the
diverse bits and pieces that make a linux distro.  IMHO debian's
abstraction is just perfect.  It's only skin deep and you can always
peek underneath to see what really is going on.

Safety nets are also necessary for mere mortal like myself... afterall

I was able to get my wvdial up and running proper - thank you all for
the help. 

However, there still seems to be one hitch - whenever i connect using
wvdial, lynx/konqueror/mozilla etc do not resolve the hostnames into IP
addresses. When I give the IP address of a machine in the address bar, I
am able to view the web-page. Not when I use the name of the website.
This problem does not exists when I dialup using kppp.For example,

Hello,
              Good Morning
 
I want to configure MRTG to monitor each and every users seperatly. I found an example on some site like MRTG generates the graph for each and every clients present in the LAN. And if I click on any client it takes to another page where I can get the details of the Client, like what pages where accessed and also the graph of that client alone.
 
Is there any possiblites to do this. I am using Squid as a proxy alone and MRTG to monitor the LAN interface of the server and it generates a common bandwidth status graph.
 
Plz let me know about this.
Thank You

Message-ID: <20040120181559.73844.qmail@web12703.mail.yahoo.com>

hi all,

Have been trying (unsuccessfully) to run LAM/MPI on my
2 node network. But when I run lamboot, it says
Permission Denied.

the <hostfile> and the network is configured properly.

Also the problem is with ssh. Earlier I had the same
problem with rsh. I sorted it out by adding:

in.rshd 192.168.0. and in.rlogind 192.168.0.

although I have also added sshd 192.168.0. to the
/etc/hosts.allow file I get the ssh error.

I got the above <fix> from Google, if anyone has a
better solution please help.

Thank You

Toufeeq

I have had a successful LAM/MPI cluster some time back.  Here are the steps 
that I have figured out after many unsuccessful attempts.  These steps are my 
quickest way to have a LAM/MPI cluster.

1.Install Linux in the Master node
2.Set Hostname and domainname
3.Setup the Master node as NIS server
4.Export /usr, /home directories.
5.Add a user for cluster, say kluster.
6.Update the NIS maps.
7.Install lam-mpi in Master under /usr/local
8.Install NPB in /usr/npb
9.Check the path for mpicc and lam* executables.
10.In Master: login as kluster.
11.Create a text file lamhosts in ~/ with:
LMIT3     #Master Node
Node1      #Slave Node
12.Install Linux in Slave node node1.
13.Make slave to mount /home, /usr with NFS.
14.Setup NIS ypbind in node1.
15.Check whether NIS is OK by using ypcat.
16.In node1:  Login as kluster.
17.Type recon v lamhosts in master to check whether the cluster is bootable.
18.Type lamboot v lamhosts in Master to start lam on the cluster.
19.From Master, type tping c5 N to ping the entire cluster (use this to check 
the cluster is OK).
20.In Master: mpirun N progname or mpirun lamd N progname to run the progname 
on all nodes.  The second command used lamd to run the program.

you can also do without NIS.  My setup required NIS too.

I edited my /etc/sshd/sshd_config entries to "no"
where all Authentication was needed.Still same problem

If youre using rsh, ~/.rhosts for your cluster, try the 'IgnoreRhosts no' in 
sshd_config.  I had similar problems with rsh/ssh etc.  That's why I am using 
NIS.  

I dont exactly remember how I made the cluster work with rsh/ssh.  Can you 
mail me all the steps that you used to configure the master and node?

Hi,

I have had the *exact* problem as you specified.  I dont exactly remember how 
I solved the problem, since it is too long back.  But if I am right I changed 
something on PAM (/etc/pam.d/rlogin??).  Check if you are running PAM (is 
/etc/pam.d present?)

I suppose it is adding the following line to /etc/pam.d/rhosts
auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_rhosts_auth.so

check if the .so file exists in that path.

>From your steps, I see that you have ignored PAM.    Try rsh from one node to 
another.  Does it work?  If it doesnt work even after adding the above line 
to pam.d/rhosts then mail me back with the results.

I have installed Slackware 9.1 on an AMD Athlon XP 2400 + Asus MB
machine(A7S266 - VM).
The ethernet card is onboard. The ethernet card does not go up during boot
although the option is
specified.  In fact the ethernet card is not detected. I tried with an
external ethernet card .. juz dint work either ...
Does anyone have the drivers ?

You need to be able to ssh without a password between your nodes.  I 
believe the error above results form TCP wrappers.  Make sure you have the 
proper entries in /etc/hosts.allow.  Also make sure there's no firewall 
rules in the way.

Hello Everyone,

I have a querry with regards to boot menu configuration :

I having 3 Os's on my system namely - Linux ( Mdk 9.1) , Win 98, Win XP.
I am using Grub as my boot loader , the problem is Grub first's gives =
the choice bet Windows & Linux,
If I switch to windows , It initiates the chain loader , & comes with =
again 2 options namely Win 98 & Win XP which one to boot

Is there any possibility by which I could get all the 3 options ( ie =
Linux , Win 98 , Win XP ) in the first screen itself.

My partition info is :
*****************************************************************
/dev/hda5 on / type ext3 (rw)
/dev/hda1 on /boot type ext3 (rw)
/dev/hda2 on /mnt/win_c type vfat (rw,umask=3D0)  -- C:

/dev/hda9 on /mnt/win_f type vfat (rw,umask=3D0)   -- F:
******************************************************************
I have installed Win 98 on /hda2 ( C:) , & Win XP on /hda7 ( D:)

My Grub.conf file is :

I had also tried 3rd party boot managers such as XOSL , there I could =
boot into Linux and Win98 , but I couldnt boot into
Win XP ( giving the source D:\ ) is not working.=20

Thanks in advance

I have successfully done this but with the following config:
c: - win2k
d: - win98

To make grub show all 3 entries, I booted off from a win98 bootable disk and 
did a ' sys d:'.  This will install necessary bootloader and system files to 
boot from d:, without depending on the NT bootloader.

I then edited my boot.ini in c: to change the timeout value to 0.  then added 
another chainloader entry in grub for d:.

You need to check only one thing before you can try something like this.  See 
if WinXP in d: can boot even after issuing a sys d:.  If it is able to boot, 
then you can change the timeout value in boot.ini with default to Win98.

I just installed it myself some days back.  I have the same sound card, 
but even after unmuting the sound using aumix, it doesn't work.

Once I find time, I'll google for just what needs to be stuck into 
/etc/modules.conf for this to work.  Or you could save me some time, 
google for it, get it working and mail the list .. may be quite some 
time before I next boot into linux, I'm traveling, and this laptop only 
has windows on it.

Do lspci, you can find the chip id of your sound card. Insert the
respective module. The driver is available.

	Is the module loading(snd-intel8x0) ? Or maybe the sound is

ok, the sound card is `ES1371' for the i810e board. The kernel
identifies it as i810. The correct module is `es1731.o'. That is
driver for that card. I've the same board at home.

sox.   (if  you   have  a   powerful  cpu     you  can   directly  get
OGG/MP3/whatever enc  by piping out sox  to the encoder.  I have never
tried that since my CPU isn't powerful).

I tried the following method:

1. Record in WAV format for 5min ( ~50MB ) 
2. Stop the Record and save in file1.wav
3. Start the recording in file2.wav
4. Convert file1.wav to mp3/Ogg
5. Delete the file1.wav

Finally you will get a seq of mp3/ogg files for every 5 min :)

Bye :)

Hi,

  I dont have system here to test it.  But I am assuming the 
following steps

lspci                              // to find chip id
pico /etc/modules.conf
sound es1731               // add this line to /etc/modules.conf
modprobe es1731        // run this from command line

Did I miss anything?

The unix philosophy is to have different programs to do the recording and
the encoding.

For recording use rec (front end to sox) or grec aka gnome-sound-recorder
if you want something to click on. You can encode the resulting .wav file
into mp3 using lame, ogg using oggenc etc.

Unless you have a burning need to use mp3 you might want to try a patent-
free format like ogg since it has higher quality as well and better supported
on linux in general.

true. I found  ogg good enough for most of my  uses, except that XMMS'
equalizer    wont   respond    to   OGG,    for    god-knows-why   (or
xmms-devels-know-why) reasons. anyone got this working around?

Mine is a 333 Mhz pentium 2 and I get < 10% cpu utilization when doing

Hi,

here i would like to add that the UNIX philo can be forked into the
AT&T philo and the MIT philo.

the hackers at AT&T believed that every program in UNIX should
do one task and do it well, while ppl at MIT (RMS et.al) believ(ed/s)
in writing programs which would do multiple tasks, even if it affected
size of the code! ( reminds u of emacs ? ;)  )

Hello,

Yeah your suggestion for converting to OGG format is agreeable, but for 
one problem. Is ogg player (like mp3,vcd player) available
in the market

Thanks for the reply first of all.

Iam sure it would work in ur config but not with my config as win98 is in C:
& win xp is in D:
I tried sys D: with a Boot floppy of Win XP , but it did'nt work. I also
manually copied the ntldr , & NTDETECT.com files from C: to D:, but still
without any success. I could'nt make XP to boot, I am clueless :-(

Hi,
    FYI. IIIT-Hyderabad is a deemed university recognised by UGC/AICTEE. 
Further We have educational exchange relations with CMU and other 
foriegn universities. If you are such a big BOND why don't you rather 
ignore such a politely addressed mail or you need some point to jump 
around and reply.
    Don't tell us what open source is all about. We know clearly what it 
is. We are as an institute already a part of E-governmance project of AP 
government. Have you never heard of contest like
ACM programming contest and Google programming contest and also may be 
iitm's programming contest. This is just a invitation and challenge. If 
you feel ur self capable why don't you try participating and showing us.

This is not Personally intended but is just a clarification which needed 
to be done for your previous mail.

Hi,
Does anybody know of any Indian NTP service
providers?

I became aware of how poor our local supplies
of integrated mother-boards are when I found
new boards failing async serial communication due
to poor clocks - ( Check your clock for a pointer
to poor modem performance! )

FYI: Some observations on the systems I use ( with Debian )
SunSparc - loses 1 second per month
old Celeron - gains 3 seconds a day
brand new integrated mb - bad enough to fail interrupt-driven
	serial-communication

 Here no strings is attached.  

 The point is governments instead of making primary education sensible
 (GCD comes in 7'th standard maths which is good recursive problem and
  first algorithm mankind knows. Two's compliment comes in 7'th standard.
 Instead of focusing on the good math cum computer sci problems starts
 acronymous which with out basic education becomes useless in the long
 run.

thanks to screwed up routing, hk / singapore are still closer network 
wise than iit-m, though iit-m is physically far closer to my house (10 
mins from venkatarathinam nagar, adyar) than hk or singapore is.

that's networks and routing for you. :)

Hello Everybody,

Never realised that there were so many Debian fans in my
locality.

I've just posted a set of working debianised binary packages at
http://www.acarlab.com. The set consists of lame-3.94b,
ffmpeg-0.4.8, libquicktime-0.92 and qtstu-0.8.8. I would
welcome any report on them.

I also have a stable ( for me, ) debianised alsa-lib-0.9.8 - which
I can post if there is any interest.

Thanks in advance.

By 'windows' if you are refering to NT, here it is.

I searched for  'windows NT boot linux' on google  nd found this link:
http://linuxgazette.net/issue61/padala.html

This is  the Nth  time I'm seeing  a message  on ILUGC with  the title
'boot loader' from you... ;)

Hi

I have a dual booted system(Windows & Red hat linux).
I have installed linux with grub boot loader. After a

this made me a problem to the system.While booting,
the system will wait at the grub terminal, after
giving some commands only it will load my windows os.
pls give me soln. so that my system will directly boot
to windows.

well, The point  is for such trivial stuff you  could have searched on
google.  For  instance,  google  has  the answer  to  this  "different

But when I restart my machine it just works fine for 10minutes and then goes off with the same error.
I only updated the pacakges using the up2date utility and retrived the packages from fedora site. 
Any problem with this?. 
Plz Find me a solution.

  Then I don't think we doesn't need to participate in
such contests then.

  Programming contests doesn't mean fighting.  Open
you eyes to see that a _team_ (3 students in this
case) works for solving problems, not an individual. 
This _definitely_ help people to work in Collaborative projects.

amen.  This  argument against  contests  is  as  good as  saying  quiz
contests are wrong.

Competetions like these are a breeding ground and outlet to new ideas and 
innovation.
It is a bad attitude to look upon them as some sort of fight-until-death 
or mano-e-mano or bounty hunting.
If programmers around the world come together for some reason it is good 
for the entire community.
But then the provoking words "Programming Supremacy" in the invitation 
were a bit too much - It leaves a bad taste.
It is exactly these kinds of words that would provoke some anonymous 
hacker(or should I use cracker) in some corner of the world(or probably 
somewhere among us) to go ahead and deface IIIT-H websites. So one must be 
careful in phraseology, especially when it is going out to an 
international audience(!).

Ram

Your Font server is not running OR died after 10Min.  Check the your
/etc/X11/fs/config file.  OR Hardcode the Font path in
/etc/X11/XF86Config file.

Read man XF86Config for more info :)

1) Redirect using "Meta refresh" which is redirected by the web browser
itself (this is web server independent)

2) If you're using Apache web server, read the doc on URL rewriting
(mod_rewrite).

Note the double-qoutes in the subject.  These are not

and want to share them here (in case if any tcl
programmer want to know the unknown).

Hmm.. probably if you load the linux bootsector in the start of the
ext2 filesystem where you have linux loaded., and if you configured
the bootsector properly to load the kernel, then _probably_ you can
make the M$WinNT boot sector to chainload the linux bootsector. But
I'm just guessing this. I dont have a WinNT/9x system at hand to try
it out though..

Joe

Try this, I got it from a site:
2) on each host create a ssh key

	ssh-keygen -t rsa	

3) copy the public key
	
	eval `ssh-agent`
	ssh-add			# your passphrase
	scp -p $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  hostB:$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
	scp -p hostB:$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys # now no 
password is required

4) test if ssh is work (without password)

from hostA	ssh hostB (no password is required)
from hostB	eval `ssh-agent`
          	ssh-add                 # your passphrase
          	ssh hostA (no password is required)

Hope that helps.

Hi every one,
1.Can any one tell how to install Linux from an iso
image file stored in hard disk?
2.Will it be possible to load 2 different linux(e.g
Red Hat & Mandrake) in a single hard disk @ 2
different drives.If yes what will happen to the
booting of those OS'es.I have Windows & Red Hat.I wish
to try out Mandrake without disturbing both the OS.
thanks in advance for the answer
bye 
vikram

Subject: [Ilugc] GNU/Linux CDs needed - from Nepal
Message-ID: <4016A277.9010408@fewanet.com.np>

Hello all,

	I am right now working in Nepal (in a place called Pokhara, teaching in 
a college).  I need some latest distributions (like Debian, Mandrake, 
Gentoo, etc.)  for my personal use, to install in our 
servers/workstations and to demonstrate to my students.  Since we don't 
have good bandwidth here, one can't think about downloading stuff here. 
  I would be glad to have FreeBSD/NetBSD also, if available.

	These BE(software engineering) students are of the view that the Unices 
are something not designed for them and using them is like going to Mars.

	If any of you are interested in burning them for me, please mail me.  I 
will ask one of my friends in Chennai to contact you, collect it from 
you(and pay you for the cost of the CDs) and mail them to me.

	(Of course, some linux CDs are available in Kathmandu, in the shops 
which "import" and sell unauthorised CDs (fixed price - just 100 NRs per 
CD - whatever it may contain).  Along with Visualstudios and Autocads, 
we can find one Redhat CD also - the only non-windows CD.)

Thanks in advance,

Thanks anyway.

Hi All

	My database servers are present at three different locations.
All the databases servers, at the three different locations, are always
in synchronization with each other. Any database change at any location
is replicated across all the servers. I have three databases , db1, db2
and db3. The internet user inserts the record in db1 . The same data is
replicated in db2 and db3. 

	Is there any way by which we can ensure which database is
updated first.Whether data is replicated in db2 first or in db3 first. 
am using, mySQL - php- apache.

AFAIK, mysql simultaneously replicates from master to the clients by
tracking the bin logs. If at all there is a delay between the clients, it
would be because of the diff in latency been the master and the slave.

use a resolvable address (a real email address) in the sender envelope.

nobody@localhost.localdomain or nobody@www wont help.

Where can I get information regarding GNU
implementation of STL that is used in GCC?

PS: Google didn't help.  It would be much helpful to
me if you could also give the google search query for it.

I told you exactly what to do.

Now search google on how to make the php mail function do what you need 
it to do.  You are not the only person to have had this problem before, 
so you should be able to find it without many more emails to the list

In the source, perhaps?

Since this is _Standard_ Template Library, there shouldn't be
any GNUisms visible for a C++ programmer - for them, the reference
is usually here:

http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/

Since you're looking for STL implementation details, _the_ place
to look for is the source itself, obviously.

http://gcc.gnu.org/libstdc++/

Regards,
Sajith.

  I actually saw this before, but missed to dig
further.  I was actually looking for the complexity of
algorithms implemented by them.  Now it's there. 
Thanks, anyway.

there's an excellent tool called vi

another one i can recommend is emacs

but before that I'd strongly recommend reading http://www.sendmail.org/faq/

Well?

The permissible minimum time complexity of every STL component is
clearly specified in the standards - if a vector member can't be
accessed in O(1) time, then it isn't a vector, for example. That
isn't special to libstdc++.

Sajith.

  Know that.  But I was looking for more specific
information.  For example, what is the constant
factor, what is the exact O(x) in current
implementation.

  Seems like source code is the ultimate choice.

Hi  all

Is there any way i can see the amount of HEAP a process is using...
I tried in /proc/PID/ , but could not get it. Top is also not

If your program is coded using C/C++ you can override libc's malloc and
friends.  You typically don't even need to recompile your application.

You can find various "malloc debuggers" on freshmeat.net that will do
the job.

Note:  Some applications use their own internal implementation of
       malloc.  Eg.  For better performance, perl uses an internal
       version of malloc instead of the libc version.  You can never
       instrument such applications without modifying the source code.

Examining /proc will not help you much because it provides the kernel's
view of size/rss/share comes from brk().  This can be very different
from what your libc malloc is doing.

HTH,

Subject: [Ilugc] Doubt in SNMP in SQUID
Message-ID: <20040129024233.91751.qmail@web41706.mail.yahoo.com>

I have one doubt in configuring snmp support in
Squid.I am using    SQUID 2.5 STABLE3 and  NET-SNMP
V5.1        I checked for the following commands to
check SNMP. Both  worked correctly
#snmpwalk -v 1 -c public localhost system
#snmpwalk -v 1 -c public localhost interface

For SNMP in SQUID, i have been asked to add the
following in snmp.conf(in /etc/snmp/).
=======================================================
# First, map the community name "public" into a
"security name"
com2sec   local           localhost    public
com2sec   theworld    default        public
# Second, map the security name into a group name:
group   MyRWGroup      v1                    local
group   MyROGroup       v1                    theworld
# Third, create a view for us to let the group have
rights to:
view               all            included         .1
# Finally, grant the group read-only access to the
systemview view.
access   MyROGroup      ""          any noauth        
  exact     all       none      none
access   MyRWGroup      ""         any noauth         
  exact     all       all       none
   proc mountd
   proc ntalkd 4
   disk / 10000
   load 12 14 14
=======================================================
And then to recompile SQUID using
      #./configure --enable-snmp
But I installed SQUID using RPM and I found mib.txt in
the SQUID directory. Does this mean, SQUID is already
SNMP enabled.
Then I added the following in squid.conf(in
/etc/squid)
=======================================================
acl snmppublic snmp_community public
snmp_access allow snmppublic localhost
snmp_access deny all
=======================================================
I then executed this to check if SNMP is working with
SQUID
snmpwalk -c public localhost:3401
.1.3.6.1.4.1.3495.1.1

But i get "snmpwalk: Timeout"
Is this configuration correct. How to know if squid is
configured with snmp, when i installed using RPM.

Plz help me.
Thank You.

IIRC, GCC uses SGI's STL. So the SGI site should be a good starting point. Also it is worth trying STLport.

Hello everybody,

I have just started to write a driver for an Image processing card ( PCI device, no network support) which was designed in our institute itself. I finished writing the pci_driver struct ( name, probe, remove etc.). Now Iam ready to write the open, read, write, release for the card. 

I have written a simple character driver and for that i registered my fops using register_chrdev which returned major no. But for a PCI card I don't know how to register the fops and to get the major number for my device.

I searched a lot for that, but in vain. Also I found the registration of fops for my intel 810 PCI Audio device was done as

dev->audio = register_sound_dsp (&i810_fops, -1)

But I don't know, how to do that for my PCI device. Can anyone help me in this.

It is also fair to mention that these URLs are nearly 10 years old.
[1] dates back to 1994 and [2] dates back to 1996.

Tcl and also other programming languages have evolved tremendously.  All
you need to do is compare perl4 (94-96 circa) with perl 5.8 of today to
see the glaring differences in technology and implementation.  Therefore
much of what is said in these URLs is nolonger valid.

All in good sport, here are some reasons why you may want to use tcl
today -

Interesting urls though.  Thanks for posting.

Subject: [Ilugc] help regarding my project in LINUX
Message-ID: <20040131124501.75816.qmail@web41208.mail.yahoo.com>

hi people,

I am a 4th year student and i am doing a project
"Deadlock Checker tool" in LINUX.The main aima of the
project is to check for deadlocks at a current point
of time. 
For this, i need to take the information dynamically
from the system. One way I thought to do that was to
access the structure in which the process table is
stored and copy it into a virtual table and then use
it for finding deadlocks.I just want to know whether
this is feasible or is there any other method to take
information dynamically.
I do have 1 more problem with this project.The reason
y i have taken this project is to get some hands on
experience in LINUX.Now, veen when i finish the code,
i wud not be able to prove if my code is working
perfectly because LINUX does allready have deadlock
management and recovery.So please also suggest me any
way of proving that my code is correct by say using
some tool or anything.
waiting for replies.
Madhu
