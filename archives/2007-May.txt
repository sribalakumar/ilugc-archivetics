And how many seeders and leachers/peers does it show to be online ?
a figure like 2(100) for seeders, for example tells you that 100 people have
the full torrent content (as tracked by the tracker), but currently 2
are online.

seeders - 38(38) leechers 44(44) - now 7.39 gb uploaded, and still  
and 99.07% complete (it was 99.06% two days ago, so looks like progress)

The guy is running spamassassin on his PC.  It triggers whenever someone
sends email to ilugc from an insecure server (or from a virus infected
DSL IP / cablemodem NAT gateway through their webhosts server, even)

And he has misconfigured it to send bounces back to the mailing list

Silly of him, I'd say, but that's just me

are you sure it's not a fake torrent? Happened with me once, it got stuck
around 98% and never finished so I went back to where I downloaded it from
and checked the comments and many people were facing it, happened to be
a fake.

Thats neat.. Ubuntu has been by far the best newbie solution in the linux
world and it has also got some big names like ESR on its user list. So
great! I am happy because the new dell laptop will surely support linux
then. I want t buy one. But i will install gentoo when i purchase it!

Hi,

I installed FC6 in my x86 machine with Intel motherboard. It's installed
properly but I am facing two major problems:

1. The keys double quotes (") and at symbol (@) got interchanged, i.e.
pressing one displays other one on screen. I posted this prob to
linuxquestions.com (
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=505554) and added
following in xorg.conf file (I think):
Section "InputDevice"
Identifier "Keyboard0"
Driver "kbd"
Option "XkbModel" "pc105"
Option "XkbLayout" "us"
Option "XkbVariant" "intl"
EndSection
This fixed the @ key but double quotes still doesn't come properly.
2. I am able to ping websites like google.com & yahoo.com but not able to
connect to them using the browser or telnet. Is there a problem with TCP
stack?

Message-ID: <1178008017.5334.24.camel@ubuntu-desktop>

Hi all,

Does anyone here has a Debian "Etch" DVD (4.0) and/or Ubuntu 7.04 DVD
and stays in or around Kolkata? It would be great if anyone could donate
me a copy. Or if someone stays some distance away, can anyone post me
the DVD(s)?

It would be of great help. 
Contact me off-list or give me a call on 9903140286

Thanks

Hi All,

Some of the ilugc users knew I was associated with Freespire project. I can
say, that was the greatest mistake I had done. I have started this article How
people get moved by the word
"Freespire"<http://chakkaradeep.wordpress.com/2007/04/29/how-people-get-moved-by-the-word-proprietary/>on
how Freespire Project isnt good and how they neglect the Community.

For some, this can be blog ranting, and it is not. This is from a deceived
freespire user and many users are still fighting in the forums, but without
the real Open Source users, we wouldnt be able to do anything.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0705010453j28141abbp119aefd3b2a926a9@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

I have a website for our client.
There I hosted Joomla and the Wordpress.

In my home, via linux, I can update the data for the sites.

Today, I went to client's place for collecting data.
I started to upload the data from their place itself.

What a pity!

I can not upload any data.
I get all the administrative interfaces.
I enter the required data.
But, the data did not uploaded.
The Connection is Airtel.
Joomla and Wordpress, both are the thins which I
can not update the text or files.

At the same time, In my home, with BSNL connection,
I can update the data.

Is this the problem with Airtel?
How to rectify it?

Because, I can guide the client to upload the date themself.

Thanks,
T.Shrinivasan.

Message-ID: <20070501124652.GL15885@burns.dreamhost.com>

I know I'm not going to get any support from Airtel on this -- they
don't even recommend using the external aerial port on their card. But I
wonder if anyone has used a PCMCIA datacard (including from vendors
other than Airtel) on Linux? A bit of google-fu unearthed reports of
using Vodafone cards on Linux.. and I believe the hardware's similar
(both re-badged Option devices) .. but reports of experience on Airtel
would be encouraging.

Cheers,

Doran

I believe the Reliance card is CDMA, whereas Airtel's is GPRS. Not that
I'm by any means sure -- it would be good to hear more about their
experience/setup in any case!

Message-ID: <d16b1c80705010648q3deaba71nfde04cb8fe940377@mail.gmail.com>

Mailing List Guidelines

1. Use a proper subject line.

2. Do not troll in the mailing list

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll

3. Use [OT] for off-topic, non-technical discussions. But, don't
misuse this to start flame wars or to troll in the mailing list.

4. Do not top-post:

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting

Example of a top-post:

Because it messes up the order in which
people normally read text.

> > such a bad thing?
Top-posting.
> > What is the most
> > annoying thing in e-mail?

Always use bottom-posting.

> What is your name ?
My name is ILUGC.

5. Do not over-quote:

Example of an over-quote:

>>> On Friday you said
>>> blah blah blah
>> On Saturday you said
>> foo foo foo
> On Sunday you said
> foobar

6. Do not post HTML messages

7. Do not recycle messages

8. Do not send attachments

9. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical legal disclaimers. If your
company uses disclaimers, don't use your company ID for the mailing
list.

10. Do not reply to a digest. (If you are in digest mode and want to
reply to a post use ILUGC Gmane blog interface.

Link: http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc

11. Search for answers for your questions/problems in google.com or
any other search engine before posting your query to the mailing list.

If any of the above are not clear to you, Please read the detailed
list guidelines:

Link: http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

12. Do not post messages in all capital letters. Mails in CAPS is

help into GNU/Linux migration, check here:
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/GNU_Linux_migration

14. If you are looking for GNU/Linux distro CDs please check here:

http://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/

16. Don't send season's greetings or birthday invites to the group.
Its not mailing list etiquette.

We must use the above guidelines to maintain better readability,
proper archives, efficient bandwidth usage, etc.

Etch CD will be little bit tough for handling. Cause, Etch is actually 3 (
three ) DVDs. So, equivalent CDs will be a huge one......

Theoriticaly,It doesn't matter weather you are using Linux or anything 
else and it is definetly not a problem with the ISP cause they only 
provide a TCP/IP Interface. Try Checking weather this is only a problem 
With your wordpress/Joomla site or all other wordpress site, Simply test 
it out at http://www.opensourcecms.com/ .I really feel that this problem 
is caused due to a virus infected PC or a Mis configured browser or Both.

I would stick to using a bluetooth enabled Phone with the computer. 
Bluetooth Phones are a lot cheaper than the Data Card and youve got the 
Advantage of using your phone with other Devices Like PDAs, Desktop 
Computers and so on whereas with the PCMCIA Data Card you are restricted 
to Notebook computers. Also, I am quite sure all major OSs support 
bluetooth NAP or Dial up Service these days so i don't think it will be 
a problem to get things working.

Google Gives the Answer: searced for "Minimal Linux Distro with IPV6 
Support"

Came up with http://www.nycwireless.net/pebble

This appears to be one of these Specialist OSs based on Debian Linux 
targeted at Network Devices based on The Soekris Boards. But the ReadMe 
Says:

"Will it run on a standard old pentium PC:
	It should run fine on a standard PC.  For development I run it
on my laptops.  Minimum requirement is a 486 processor.  32mb of ram is
recommended, though you can probably get away with less, especially if
you don't start NoCatAuth."

So i guess it will install with no problems on your Pc, and the 
changelog says that IPV6 support is bundled since v.19 (which happens to 
have been the second public release) and all you need to get it working 
is apt-get install ipv6

hi,
i have a server with several subversion repositories. I keep getting  
berkelydb errors and have to run svnadmin recover, sometimes more  
than once a week. Although all the repostiories are under the same  
directory, they get clobbered at different times. There doesnt seem

number of times it gets corrupt. Any clues - this is driving me nuts.

Let me try to help you on this. Could you please let me know following details:

a) What is the exact bdb error you face?
b) Which command throws the error?
c) Is it specific to a user?
d) what's the access method http, https, svn, svn+ssh?

dont have the exact error - timed out, lack of memory - i will record  
it next time

any command - checkout, commit, update ...

nope - when it happens all users are affected

all of the above. I havent checked it recently but i think 'file'  
protocol may not be affected. Will check next time it happens

I've been using feist Fawn for over 2 weeks on my Dell Inspiron 6400 (Core 2
duo)..almost every thing works out of box. - Wireless, Network, Video
resolution (needed to upgrade to latest 915).

NT-apple is a headache - doesn't switch between wired and wireless
correctly.

Over all a Happy user.

After going through some similar problems with the bdb backend on older
Subversion releases, i moved to the fsfs backend. It has not given me a
problem since. New versions of svn support the 'fsfs' backend as a default.

.. provided said PDA/desktop supports bluetooth :-). In principle, I
agree with you -- though here it's a fairly old laptop so a phone with a
cable would be better. Unfortunately, the datacard has already been
bought and paid for, I'm just trying to find a way to fix the network
topology so a windows box isn't the one exposed to the rest of the
network and unable to be firewalled to stop its crufty configuration
(and worms) from chewing up the limited/expensive bandwidth.

Might be easier in the end to comandeer a phone, or buy a PCMCIA<->PCI
adapter for the server ... and I see this as a good opportunity to
indoctrinate those using the laptop into the joys of open source :-).

+1 for fsfs. It uses flat files instead of a db to store changes, so
much less chances of db locks, and all the related niggles. You can
convert your bdb repos to fsfs:

airtel gprs on mobile is 375 a month unlimited usage. Speed is  
acceptable for mail and ssh - also browsing. Also i can take the  
connection whenever i need it - just pay 375 and wait about 12 hours  
for activation. Cool for presentations when the organisers at the  
last minute say internet not available

I Installed firefox and working via firefox only.
Is there any configuration in firefox to allow text uploads?

If it is the problem with ISP, Airtel, How the gmail is working there?
I can compose big mail in gmail, attach files and send it.

In gmail, the text upload is working.
In joomla and wordpress it is not working.

Help me.

Are your repositories by any chance stored on NFS ?

Hey all,
today i want to know something about ethical things from you. If anyone post
a message like this:

Are you energetic enough to write some small kiddy virus (that do only
unwanted job)?
Or you may join us to do some really good job.
A new platform will be made ASAP.


In any group? What we should do? What will you do if someone posts such type
of message in ILUGC?
Will you banned him for ever?

375/mo to activate GPRS on an existing mobile account or ...? Also:
where? In my research I found that the Airtel data prices vary
tremendously from state to state.

For point of reference, I believe the price being paid here is 600/mo
for 1.5Gb. Signal strength fluctuates a lot, so whether it's even
possible to exceed that in a given month is questionable .. but that's
more a function of an out of the way location than Airtel's service.

activate and use for a month - no activation charge as such - 375  
just opens the unlimited pipe for a month. And it is stable - I have  
been online for over 12 hours in rural west bengal without problem

in tamilnadu - but i buy in tamilnadu and use all over the country as

We had faced the same problem many times before! About a year back we migrated 
out of using BerkleyDB as the filesystem for the SVN repository to using FSFS 
as the filesystem. FSFS uses plain files (on your filesystem) to store the 
repository and does not require or use BerkleyDB at all. Our repository size 
and number of users have only grown after our shift we've not seen any 
performance drop. We have, however, got rid of those nasty BerleyDB errors.

To convert your existing repository to the FSFS format, you will need to first 
take a dump of your repository (svnadmin dump), then create a new repository 
with FSFS format (svnadmin create /repos/path --fs-type fsfs) and then import 
the earlier SVN dump (svnadmin load).

You should not face these problems with your SVN again.

Hope this helps...

Cheers, Abhas.

Its ok to make mistakes. Most of the time it is due to ignorance. Just
correct them in future.

I'm glad you said it first! I've been biting my tongue on the recent svn
thread, wanting to say "just use {darcs|arch|bzr}". The only use-case I
see for SVN is in shops where CVS-style development is so entrenched
that moving to a less-warty system is the biggest change inertia will
allow. Yes, there's a bit of a learning curve (especially un-learning
CVS -- remember how annoying that was when you first had to use it) but
I find Darcs, and the detailed history of my code that it provides, to
be an excellent productivity enhancer once adopted on a project.

Yes, 'Distributed version control system' is in one of our long term goal.

Message-ID: <def372aa0705020613p720919a6n1dc1ec4920d1ee0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am trying to install a wireless sniffer(tcpdump) on Linux(RH 9).
I have a Dlink PCI Card which comes with a ralink chipset.

I am able to put the card in Monitor mode but it doesn't show the contents
of the packets when tcpdump is used.
When the card is put in Infrastructure mode using iwconfig, I am able to see
the packets that are sent to the BSSID that I had configured for the card
using iwconfig.

Is it possible to see all the packets using tcpdump ? Any ideas why I am not
able to see the contents of the packets(beacons etc)

I also tried using Linksys WUSB54G and the latest versions of tcpdump and
libpcap.
This card also uses the ralink chipset.
I get the following error "pcap: Can't get USB index" when I try to use
tcpdump

Hmm., subversion is not getting outdated because of distributed version
control systems (DVCS). Though DVCS seems very good for projects
collaborated over the Internet., for software houses, subversion is
still a good choice. I dont see how DVCS will fit into or improve
productivity for software firms.

Your post implies that the "distributed" nature of these SCM's is what 
makes them appealing to some projects. While that is indeed true it does 
not convey the whole picture. Performance for example is beneficial to 
any type of project whether done over the net or in house. Software 
firms frequently do projects across multiple centers distributed 
globally these days.

You can still use Subversion for decentralized development using the
svk plugin. It is written in perl, stable and cool plugin one would
love to use. But yeah, it is a nice to have feature in Subversion
during long run. But given the amount of popularity Subversion gains
in recent times, I'm unsure how many users are considering this
feature as a bottle-neck to use Subversion. For what is worth, the
count of Subversion users are doubling every 5 months.

OTOH, I'll not recommend bzr to corporates, not because of it's
nature, but because of it's current state. If i am right, it is still
in beta and they are actively working towards to release the first
stable version 1.0 as early as possible.

Check out this version control comparison chart to know the pros/cons
of every version control system.

Subversion is outdated in the same way "Windows is outdated". Our
community has never lagged behind when it comes to wishful thinking
;-)

Honestly, I think a lot of the uptake with DVCSs is because a lot of
cool kids are doing it. :-D (damn, 2nd smiley) Most development
efforts, both corporate and open source development tend to have a
centralized way of doing things. I see real manageability issues with
DVCSs if it's unleashed into an inexperienced team with varying
experience/skill levels. The Mozilla developers recently decided to go
with Mercurial, which is distributed - I suspect what works for
developers who write Firefox may not work with "Average Joe/Janardhan"
types. Git works well for the kernel, because kernel dev. has it's own
peculiar development model - Check out Greg Hudson's article.  Besides
All open source projects will continue to have ***one*** official
release only in the near future. Even if you have the ability to
cherry pick features from unofficial branches, how many people are
going to use it ? Maybe DVCSs will only increase the fragmentation in
open source projects.

Amen to that.

Damn, I was trying not to dive back into this thread, but I have to
disagree with you on management issues: *many* projects using Darcs have
a single, central, canonical repository, and distributed branches are
merely for individual developers to hack on. This provides great
freeedom: while hacking on a project like this, I can make changes
willy-nilly in my development branch and not worry about cluttering up
the changelog of the central repository. I can even have my editor
commit the change every time I save to compile or test or lint the code,
without having to worry about the effects of maybe hundreds of commits a
day on the central repository. As I'm going, I get all the advantages of
version control -- mostly being able to inspect the changes on a number
of scales. When I have the code in a stable state, I can package up my
patches and send them as a single change -- perhaps by e-mail, where
appropriate hooks will run a test suite against it before committing it
to the main branch. This sort of model is approached by SVN's
lightweight branching, but it doesn't go far enough and isn't exploited
well enough in the majority of cases.

Also, I've worked in a number of places (on and off dev teams, but
mostly off them, attempting to support the developers) where the VCS is
seen merely as a backup tool. Changes get checked in and history is
ignored. Branches are under-utilised. Bug-ridden code or even cruft such
as temp files get checked in, and nobody cleans it up until stuff really
starts breaking. Developers in such an environment rapidly lose any
sense of ownership of the code, or craftsmanly pride in what they have
produced.

For sure, this is a social issue more than a technical one, and a number
of underlying social issues in programming for cash are exposed, but I
see it partly as a legacy of poor tools. Back in the day, using RCS/CVS,
there were two ways to go: either check in every little change and deal
with the history becoming overloaded with "fixed typo" and similarly
pointless cruft, or carefully hone whatever you do to make it a work of
art before checking it in. Naturally, neither extreme has ever been
achieved for more than a dozen checkins so we end up with the worst of
both worlds: a history that provides little more than meaningless
statistics for managers to get excited about ("Woo so-and-so checked in
eleventy-thousand lines of code this year!" never mind half of those
were fixing his own mistakes), and lack of access to good differencing
tools when it matters most: making incremental changes.

SVN goes a long way to correcting this, if its branches are properly
utilised (by which I mean: heavily, with a lightweight structure in
place).  But unfortunately, it suffers from legacy in some of the same
ways CVS does:while a "long term goal" is to achieve DVCS this isn't
something that can be bolted on, much as repository-wide versioning
can't just be bolted on to RCS; and even moreso those coming to it too
often see it as another member of the CVS line to be treated in the same
way. The proper use of DVC is actually a radically different way of
thinking, where the code is not static but is interacted with at every
stage as a changing entity with all those changes visible. This makes
regression-type bugs difficult to introduce, makes many types of
refactorings unbelievably easier, encourages modular code and generally
seems to lead to much more polished code.


So in summary, I'm a verbose fanboy. And I'm probably too hard on SVN.
It's no coincidence that the Darcs and Haskell worlds have so much
overlap, which harks back to the point that I quoted. But don't let that
put you off, the un-learning curve for doing version control the wrong
way (CVS) is much less than that for programming the wrong way (Java).
But now I've probably turned off or at least confused the Java fans, so
I'll stop with my foot approaching my mouth.

Hi,

 I dont know if i am right or wrong , and this is just an opinion with not
that much of back ground about the development of tcp dump in the recent
times.

I only understand that tcp dump is good at getting you the frames of the
ethernet and therefore of a wired network.  Do you know for sure that tcp
dump works with wireless -- because the wireless frame is not at all similar
to the ethernet frame. If it works with wireless perhaps  it should be the
latest and greatest  because the last time  i saw it is in some beta testing
phase for wireless to capture  raw 802.11 frames.( I am not in to network
trouble shooting  of late  let alone wireless TS) . How ever   Ethereal is
working with 802.11b. ( dont know about 802.11g and  the latest MIMO -- i
dont know if these new monsters  even work with Linux in the first place.

the information in the footer is not there in the header, as far as i can
see. we do have newbies who might find the footer useful yet we do get our
share of 'unsubscribe's posted to the list. incidentally, '-- ' (and not
'--') is per rfc the separator for the signature. there is no 'standard'
footer separator (if there is, someone please point me to it). mailman is
inserting the line of underscores as the separator for the footer. if we 
use '-- ' as the separator for the footer also, when using quoted reply, 
only the footer will get removed and not the signature. all this is beside 
the point. if the list feels that the footer may be removed, i will be 
happy to do so.

  I've got one of their Mobile Office plans that doesnt have any monthly 
rental but I am charged by the ammount of data transfer. I've found the 
speeds pretty good on my Sony Ericsson Handset for downloading mail, 
uploading pictures to Flickr etc cause i usually background such tasks 
but it is a bit slow when connected to the PC but definetly faster than 
Dialup access in chennai. I've tried the same connection using my Dad's 
EDGE enabled handset and the speeds match the so called broadband 
service that Hathway used to provide.

My Sony Ericsson K510i came with a bundled USB Cable that worked without 
a problem on my Debian Sarge system. The phone also retails at around 
Rs. 5500 and shares the same software as the K750i.. and is one of the 
best phones I've used. It also has bluetooth. the only thing missing is 
expandable memory, but you will have to buy the 750i for that.

  Unfortunately, the datacard has already been

More details like a model no or a windows driver details will be helpful 
  in finding a solution. you can find them usually hidden under stickers

Must be a lot easier to get a phone and use it. Or even one of the FCT 
units will be great if used in a Fixed enviorment like an office or Home.

Changing the footer to something that is smaller and has a single link 
to the Listinfo Page should suffice for most users' needs.

I think the current footer delimiter works properly cause thunderbird 
has automatically cut it out of my reply

The headers I see in Mutt <http://research.iiit.ac.in/~masatran/mutt/>, are
as follows:

List-Id: ILUG-C <ilugc.ae.iitm.ac.in>
List-Unsubscribe: <http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/listinfo/ilugc>,

The footer is a type of signature, therefore, hyphen-hyphen-space should be
used.

> inserting the line of underscores as the separator for the footer. if we

Mutt shows all the signatures in the color chosen for the signature.

Could you change the signature to just this one line:

Unsubscribe, etc.: <http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/listinfo/ilugc>

Regarding digitally signed e-mail: stop adding an attachment with just the
footer. Adding the footer to the text will invalidate the digital signature,
so skip the footer in this case.

That's a classical example for a real *bad* project execution. Why do
want to own pride for your work when you work in a project? When you
work in a project, you should not be bothered about your individual
craftsmanship, but you should work for goodness of the project.

And again, it is one such example for poor practice. I suggest you to
observe the discussion among the developers (may be in a dev@ mailing
list) of any of open source project to know the typical practice.

Message-ID: <69621d830705021429l72c219c5y5b12c8a1c7550770@mail.gmail.com>

I tried to use beryl... but i failed...
My graphics is: nVidia Geforce-2 MX400 -- 64 Mb

I installed the graphics driver NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-7185-pkg1.run
after installation of linux-source-2.6.18 and linux-headers-2.6.18.

And also i edited my xorg.conf file.

I hope that i installed successfully my graphics driver cause one "nvidia"
logo comes before starting the Xwindow.

Anyway, i added the repository:
http://debian.beryl-project.org/etch ( binary)
http://debian.beryl-project.org/etch ( source)

And also all beryl items from there.
And also edited my xorg.conf file by putting the

Section "Extensions"
Options .....
EndSection

But i failed.
When the beryl icon comes to my toolbar and i right click on that and enable
the "Beryl" window manager.. then after some blinking nothing happens...

What should i do to start beryl?

Hai,

    Yes as per Rajasekhar statement, you cannot use tcpdump for WIFI
network. Even Ethereal will not help you. So just try with Kismet .

I tried using tcpdump with an Atheros chipset in Monitor mode and was
able to see all the packets.
Saving the dump from tcpdump and opening the file in Wireshark also
worked fine. Wireshark deciphered all the packets perfectly.

My version of tcpdump is :

	tcpdump version 3.9.5
	libpcap version 0.9.5

The commands I used:

	sudo tcpdump -i ath1 -s 0 -n -vvv -XX
	sudo tcpdump -i ath1 -s 0 -n -vvv -XX -w raw.dump

I don't have a card with a ralink chipset, so can't help you there :)

regards,
Sujith.

Friends.

I want to protect some files from deleting even from root itself.

I have done it with chmod and some option.
If you give that, the file can not be deleted even by root.

I forget that option.

Do anyone remembers it?

Please post it.

Thanks.

Myself found.

That is not chmod.
it is chattr

chattr +i <filename> to give protection.
chattr -i <filename> to revoke the protection.

Even Kismet uses libpcap. So even tcpdump should be able to capture
802.11 packets.

Maybe getting the error message would be useful. What I do is type
beryl in the terminal, it will throw out the relevant error and then there's
google which will give you the solution.

i am not interested in these types of pedantic arguments. i asked for a
'standrad'. if there is an rfc or standard that indicates that a mailing
list footer separator should be blah or that a mailing list footer is a
signature, i will take that.  else, i will take the opinion of the list
only, not any individual's interpretation. i will wait to see the

ok, looks like all the subscribe/unsubscribe and info things are all there
in the headers (haven't checked out the headers in a while). so, perhaps,
it is time to remove the footer. so, does anyone on the list object to my
removing the mailing list footer? currently the footer reads 'to
unsubscribe, send mail to blah blah' and also shows a web url for the
list, all of which information is also available in the mail headers as 
pointed out by user quoted above. if there are no serious objections, 
mailing list footer will be removed by this weekend.

all of which is irrelevant to the issue, i think. the mailing list is not
sending out pgp signed mail and neither do we add an attachment with just the
footer. and, if i am not mistaken, pgp signatures (like in your mail) are all
scrubbed by the list before posting out.

If the footer is removed for the above reason, how will people know of
the unsubscribe links ?
How do they see the header ? Does it appear in common mail clients or
web mail services like Yahoo mail and Gmail ? As far as I see, all the
mailing lists have some form of footers, some pointing to unsubscribe
info as ours and some pointing to the corresponding lists home page
and archive pages.

If am not asking an already explained question, why is this issue
being popped up now ? Are the majority of the subscribers having a
problem due to this ? If so, then it is good to remove it. But, when
it is not affecting a majority of the subscribers or when the
unsubscribe info said to be present in the headers is not easily
accessible otherwise, then please don't. We have had a number of
occasions when the footer had been pointed to some one asking "How to
unjoin from this list?".

While accessing mail in a browser only the footer is
generally visible and not the complete header(unless
the option is turned on). So it would be better to
retain the footer.
Just my 2 cents...

Hi,

 I am not saying that you cannot see the packets that are being transferred
on the network - you definitely can see it  -- but what you will be seeing
will only be the TCP/IP section of the frame but not the 802.11 frames ( for
example the management , beacons etc.) so do these commands give you the
i=out put showing the structure of 802.11 frames and WDS etc.  could you
please provide the out put of these commands-- because it seems that  iam
lagging far behind if i am unaware of such developmentsin the wireless end.

Thank  you for reading

Hmm.. DVCSs are _indeed_ quite productive. In massively collaborated
projects (Free software projects)., DVCS makes a lot of sense. A real
lot. It removes a lot of 'management headache'.

An inexperienced team will screw up even a very strict versioning
system. I've seen svn repositories with thousands of commits but
nonsense history., hence making it completely useless.

 Well I think you need the 1.0-9xxx drivers from nvidia. The GeForce 2 is
not supported by the latest nvidia drivers. One of my friends use
1.0-93xxdrivers. Search for it. Even otherwise, Geforce 2 doesnt have
pixel shading
support so most of the effects are not there. Anyway all the best!

Even with the information in the footer, we get occasional mails on
unsubscribing from the list.
It would be better to leave it as it is. or have a better one.

Try Filezilla. Yes, its the same one that you would have used on windows.
This is the linux port of that software. Uses wxgtk. Runs fine on GNOME.

Seems gftp too supports ssl with some compile time options(

It may be true, but how many of subscribers know that the unsubscribe
instruction is in the email header or, how many of mailing lists we
know that do not have footers. So far, I don't see any mailing lists
where they have excluded the email footer. Why we want to be an
exception?

My vote is to retain the footer. If we are bothered about the email
size, I suggest to include the mailing list URL alone in the footer.
But again, how many of subscribers know that they should go the
mailing list URL to unsubscribe from the mailing list is an unanswered
question!!

Some Nvidia cards have  had problems with composite.
try turning composit off in xorg.conf.
also paste the xorg log and glxinfo log and beryl output from command
line.That shoud help debug.
To check for yourself if nvidia drivers are fine and provide the necessary
direct rending.try glxinfo | grep direct.
Good luck

Since we differ on this, let us get a third opinion. This e-mail is
digitally signed. (1) Are the list members getting the digital signature?
(2) Is the mailing list footer appended to the text, or is it a separate
attachment?

macmini has been in the market for long time. Even macmini would run ubuntu
if you install. Compare the ports available and  it even has an optical
drive. Check out the "Mac mini At a Glance" section of
http://www.apple.com/macmini/ page. Mac mini seems more features rich at
that size when comparing by specs given in the websites.

Subject: [Ilugc] Downloading using accelerators - suggestions needed
Message-ID: <e977d4310705031940i64c091abk4c9ac9dbaf0404d4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am have been trying to download Kubunty Fiesty Fawn DVD for the past
couple of weeks. Initially, only the Torrent version was available,
and I tried downloading using KTorrent. I wasn't happy with it, as I
couldn't schedule the downloads between 2 AM and 8 AM. I then switched
to Azures. It did a good job, but, I had the download directory
pointed towards a FAT32 file system. Kubuntu ISO is 4.3 GB :-).  I
cleaned up my EXT3 FS for download again. Torrent isn't all that fast
and many times, I couldn't find seeders.

By then the DVD ISO was available for download from FTP mirrors. AXEL
which did a great job of downloading the the CD version at 150 KBPS,
failed miserably by reporting the following
<SNIP>
File size: -2147483648 bytes
Opening output file kubuntu-7.04-dvd-i386.iso
Crappy filesystem/OS.. Working around. :-(
</SNIP>
I got the same error for both EXT3 and VFAT

I tried the good old wget with a cron job. it works but at 6 KBPS.

I downloaded prozilla source-code and compiled it. It now has a decent
speed of 60 KBPS. But, i am not able to provide more than one mirror
URL to prozilla. It does an automatic search with LYCOS for alternate
FTP URLs. But the internal search doe not return anything. There is no
way for me to supply my own list of URLs. Moreover, it cant accept
multiple HTTP URLs.

Is there any easier way to download faster using accelerators? one of
the main criteria is that, I have to start it using a CRON job and
kill it using another CRON job. (2AM to 8 AM limits).

In simple words: how do you download such huge files with a BSNL BB?

Cheers,
Natarajan

Since ubuntu is based on debian it should have jigdo. Since you have
CD version and some downloaded files, you can use jigdo. This will
construct cd/dvd image downloading only what is not available
locally.

You can schedule the job using cron. However it will not use any
accerlator. You will get single thread only.

Yes. You can but it all depends on how you want to implement it. If you are
ready to spend money then you can go for Codeweavers.

You can try the following link

http://www.google.com/search?q=ms-office+on+linux<http://www.google.com/search?q=ms-office+on+linux&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a>

or if you don't want to spend money and would like to try a little bit, then
you can try first on one machine with WINE.

www.winehq.org for more info.

The following URL should clear most of your doubts (taken from wine site)

(1) No.
(2) footer is a separate attachment but Thunderbird shows it as inline text.

Since speed is not important enough for me I am using the slow 256kBps unlimited
connection plan. Big files are no problem.

Jigdo will do the job but it also uses wget. 6kBps with wget means a crappy mirror.

I agree the debate's a bit silly. There's some people who have been on
mutt-users for too long (or too short) a time .. anyway they're starting
to sound like David T-G from mutt-users, going on and on about pgp-mime
sigs getting broken by list footers. [Loved prof sriram's answer that
pgp mime sigs were stripped out by mailman anyway..]

I personally dont care as I know how to unsub and sub from mailman
lists, but yeah no sense removing the footer

My dear genius, Prof Sriram runs the list.

1. The footer is being appended as an attachment in your case as you pgp
mime signed the email.

2. Yes, as he said, your pgp-mime sig DID get stripped out.

Next, please?

Hey guys,

A product company I know requires some CSS help for the tool they are 
developing. The project involves creating some generic theme approaches 
that can be customized specific to each installation. The company is 
seeking help from freelance designers with the following background:

1) Experience with liquid layouts and multi-resolution designing
2) Comfortable with theme based development of UIs
3) Should know their way around JSPs - though doesnt need to be an 
expert - or atleast not get bogged down by jsp files
4) Some liferay experience preferred but not mandatory

Let me know if anyone is interested and I can move this forward.

But you can get good speeds by using IITM's server :) I had tried to
use jigdo to download an Ubuntu DVD a few days back - unfortunately
the jigdo template file is in itself around 700 MB! And there are no
officially released jigdo files, the latest I could find was made on
18th april (nightly builds), while feisty was released on 19th. Some
on the forums complained of older packages (which were later updated)
as not being present on the ubuntu repositories, causing an error in
jigdo. So, like the OP, I settled back to a standard accelerated http
download using Prozilla.

Hi all,

Toshiba Italy mulls pre-loaded Linux notebooks

http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS9644921792.html

---
Toshiba's Italian channel sales and marketing operation reportedly is
considering offering pre-loaded Linux in its Tecra, Satellite,
Portege, and Qosmio notebook lines, according to a story published
online last week in the Il Sole newspaper.

Luigi Cattaneo, country manager for Toshiba's Italy Computer Systems
Division, reportedly acknowledged that Hewlett-Packard and Acer own
more than 50 percent of the Italian Windows laptop computer market,
and that one way for his company to move ahead would be to offer
pre-installed Linux as an option, the newspaper reported.

Cattaneo said that in order to make headway in the SMB (small- to
medium-sized business) market, his company would have to market
notebooks in the 500-Euro range, and to do that, a Linux OS would be a
requirement, the newspaper reported.

"The corporation is seriously talking about this, and we are
evaluating attentively the question," Cattaneo was quoted as having
said. "It is a potential business to which we do not want to close the
door."

A Toshiba spokesperson at the U.S. headquarters in Irvine, Calif., did
not have an immediate comment when reached by DesktopLinux.com.

The Il Sole article is available online in Italian, here.

thats ok. this discussion did start with a message from the original poster
directed at me, asking me to remove the footer. i am not very much up on whats
going on around here these days, so i am quite likely to be misinformed or plain
wrong. so, i will go with the list opinion on how the list should be run.

i dont think we need to look any further. there are one or two calls for
removing the footer, but there seems to be a clear opinion in favour of
retaining the footer. the footer currently includes the mailing list url, but
not the chennailug url.  maybe, thats what we need to do, add that to the footer?

Most free sites comes with some hidden price or short comings.
Nowadays webspace have become very cheap, you can very well spend little
money and buy them instead of going for free webspaces.

In a word, no. flex+bison are parser generators -- this is an important
part of compilation, but not enough in itself. Also (I'm a little ruasty
on this point, so anyone, please correct me) they are for LR parsers and
in particular deal badly with ambiguity: C's grammar is a horrible thing
and building a parser for this is beyond the abilities of anything
reasonable.

But that's not to put a damper on your goals. Useful languages with less
pathological grammars (pascal comes to mind) can very well be parsed
with flex/bison. And the rest of compilation doesn't need to be that
difficult. At the next ILUGC meet I'll be introducing Scheme, which is a
wonderful little language for researching programming tool, and if you
have a better network connection than me I highly recommend googling
"the 90 minute scheme to C compiler", a talk given at a LUG somewhere in
Europe which delivers exactly what it promises in a nice little video.

I can probably dig up some other good online content on compilation if
you're interested.

A few points:

 * as much as I'm not a fan of Microsoft, I wouldn't level the charge of
   "no innovation" against them
 * show me a single software patent that wouldn't be invalidated by a
   reasonable court on the grounds of "prior invention" or even more so,
   being trivially obvious to anyone with an ounce of relevant expertise
 * this sounds more like "privilege seperation" a la sshd, than sudo:
   particularly in that it refers to a seperate, already running process
   rather than assuming a different UID. Not that this model is any
   newer than sudo .. I think VMS did something similar.

Actually, maybe I've missed something: why sudo? What does it do in
relation to this patent that su doesn't?

Let us use hyphen-hyphen-space to mark the footer, so that it is stripped
out by many e-mail clients when quoting.

I suggest changing the signature to just these two lines:

* Linux User Group Chennai <http://chennailug.org/>
* Unsubscribe, etc.: <http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/listinfo/ilugc>

By the way, we ought to have the website, and the mailing list on the same
domain name.

ouch - anyway, one thing about Moglen is that unlike RMS, he doesnt  
give the same talk every time. And if you get him giving his war  
stories it is really fascinating. Of course, like all FSF people he  
can talk non-stop for as many hours as you want. So if we can get  
him, it would be worth it.

when quoting, the proper way to do it is:
1. highlight the part you are going to quote
2. press 'reply'
3. if your mail client has any sense, you will get only the quoted  
material on the reply screen.

in this way, no extraneous matter enters the reply. It is silly to  
rely on '-- ' to strip out parts.

Now to poke a small hole in that mutt page up there, having used mutt
for the last 8 years or so.

Why Mutt is better than other text-based e-mail clients like Pine:
# Supports threads
#   Multiple instances can be run simultaneously
#   Colors

If you haven't seen 4.6x versions of pine (which have been around for
over two years now) they do all 3.

I dont want to make a compiler for C. I would settle for
a very simple language ( maybe something deigned by me )
which would have no ambiguity at all. So that's taken care
off.

But my problem is Code Generation. I do not know
assembly language programming( I only know 8085, which is
no good). I want to know whether there is some tool which i
could integrate with lex and yacc to do the code generation
bit for me.

Thanks.

Honestly, if its on the job, your company will bother buying the
licenses. If they are not buying, then it must do-able with
alternatives.

He is right. For some reason, the only Ubuntu Feisty DVD has a jigdo
template file which is 650+ MB.

The bunch of issues mentioned above indicate a failure to either
establish a sane branching policy or understand how branching works.

I am open to using DVCSs, but 'am yet to hear a cogent case made for them.

Look what is making headlines... M$ offering Windows on OLOP Laptops.

http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN0435704620070505
<QUOTE>
BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. hopes to develop a version of a $3
Windows software suite to run on low-cost laptops that a Massachusetts
foundation wants to send to the world's poorest children.

The software, designed for youngsters in developing nations, is being
tested on prototypes of small green-and-white laptops developed by the
One Laptop Per Child Foundation, Microsoft corporate vice president
Will Poole said on Friday.

The non-profit project plans to start mass production in September of
the so-called "XO" machines. They were designed specifically by the
foundation to run on the Linux operating system and other open-source
programs.

Linux is the main rival to Microsoft's Windows operating system. If
the machines run only Linux, Microsoft will lose out on an opportunity
to eventually expose tens of millions of children worldwide to its
Windows system.

One Laptop Per Child, founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology
scientist Nicholas Negroponte, is selling them at $176 apiece to
governments, which will then distribute them to poor children.

Some governments have urged Microsoft, the world's largest software
maker, to equip those machines with Windows software instead of Linux
and other programs developed by the foundation, Poole told Reuters.

"They're coming to us and saying, 'Hey. If we buy these very nice,
low-cost laptops, can you give us a version of Windows and Office ...
Can you make that available for that nice bit of hardware'," Poole
said. "Our answer is 'maybe'."

By default Ubuntu is provided with Bittorrent facilty. Locate the
.torrent file in the web, double click on it from your firefox
browser... the GNOME's bittorrent client will start automatically...

to re-start half done downloads, choose to download again (from the
same location) and choose to save in the same destination.. it will
continue from where it left..

no need of additional BT clients by default as far as Ubuntu is concerned ...

yes, this makes sense since we do carry debian amd64 now. download is in
progress but is going a bit slowly, so should complete sometime on sunday. 
it will be in

ftp.iitm.ac.in/debain-minicd

> * Debian 4.0 multi-architecture DVD-1 image

we are not carrying any debian images (other than the net install); it 
will probably remain this way till debian becomes more popularly 
distributed as full install images instead of the netinstall that appears 
to be more common now.

Subject: [Ilugc] Mount reiserfs with user write permissions
Message-ID: <20070505103103.GA2892@greatbear>

Dear ILUGC,

I have a reiserfs partition, which I'd like to mount with ordinary
user writable permissions. However, an option of umask or uid in
/etc/fstab alongside "defaults" warns me with an "invalid option"
warning and fails to mount. What is the right way to mount it with
user write permissions? Googling didn't get me far...

Of course, I am able to write to it as root.

Thanks.

Kumar

Cant you just change the permissions of the directory to which it is
mounted to 777?

I was bit taken aback after working with Suse Enterprise Linux 10. (Lets
forget for a while about novell-microsoft deal). Supports Xen , Yast got
easy to configure interface and good hardware support too. ( worked for me
like breeze )
In short Novell's got everything right to compete with IIS / Longhorn
server.

OK, that seems to be all right. Thanks!

But is it _the right way_? Of course, I am happy with this, but
still...

AFAIK, umask is supposed to be specific for FAT file systems, where
the files don't have a owner by default (you can see 'man mount' for
the filesystem specific options). Reiserfs has support for users and
groups, so mounting it should also honour this ownership.

In that sense, I would *guess* there isn't a "right" way to achieve
what you want.

I understand. So for filesystems which do have permissions, we can use
the same infrastructure.

Thanks.

There are lex token and bison grammar files available that recognize the
C language. Most programming languages can be recognized by a regular LR
parser.

Compilation is essentially a 6 stage process:

1) Analyze and split the source program to valid tokens
2) Parse the token stream and check for conformance to grammar
3) Convert the source token stream to an intermediate form (usually
Abstract Syntax Trees)
4) Parse the syntax tree and convert into a lower-level language
5) Perform optimizations, rinse and repeat
6) Finally convert the low-level language to assembly code for the
target architecture

Stages 1, 2 and 3 are usually part of the "front-end" of a compiler,
while stages 4, 5, 6 make up the "back-end".

Nothing like a good book to clear up the concepts. I recommend the
"Dragon book" on Compilers by Hopcroft and Ullman.

You can get all the source you want from http://cvs.fedoraproject.org. 
If you can't use the cvs file let me know and I will send you the tarball.

it is... for fs's with a permission infrastructure, the best way to
give permissions is to use it. however, there's an alternative if you
just want to change the permissions for the current mount without
touching the filesystem (say u have to put it as ro, and have to give
read permissions otherwise not possible). try the fuse bindfs
filesystem, and enhanced userspace version of `mount --bind`

http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/partel/bindfs/

it moves on...

thank you for that rahul..

that has three inscript, tamil99 and phonetic layouts for tamil.

missing is remington and something new that i found in FC6 id iTrans..

http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/extras/4/i386/repoview/scim-tables-tamil.html

above link gives scim-tables-tamil for the fc4 release...

well we can avoid re-doing the work.. fc6 has all these layouts put
together.. gr8 work indeed..

it will be of great help to Tamil facility seekers, if we could make out the
.deb package of it also..

no hurry ;-)

thank u again..

Was that a question? The repoview doesn't show it because the package 
does not exist in the FC6 repository. Got obsoleted or renamed.

Flex and Bison are excellent fully functional tools for compiler
building. I have myself used them to build compilers for toy languages
in compilers courses in grad school. Further they are the very tools
that are used in GCC itself. Certain front ends use flex, some don't.
But as far as I can remember all of them do use Bison as the parser
generator. In other words they are certainly "industrial strength"
tools.

That said, they are meant to solve two specific theoretically
well-understood sub-problems, which are particularly conducive to
"automatable" programming, in compiler construction...

Why would you ask for a talk on a question to which you have already
given an answer?

I liked this speech a lot:

Is it a good practice to sign all mails to list? I think people only
sign if they make some announcement or mails that really need trust on
authenticity. What is the point of signing each and every mail to the
mailing list when the mail reads "Yeah", "Nope" sorta? Sorry if this is
gonna hurt.

Praveen.

There's at least some people who carry privacy to tinfoil hat levels
..especially a few people on (for example) the mutt / gnus lists

Learning from them (signing all email, pedantically insisting on
pgp/mime rather than clearsign pgp) is not always a brilliant idea

Alrighty, removed the auto-signing of mails from my mail client. Not sure if its a good practice to announce that I had done so..;)

        Since I do not keep my gpg keys on a networked machine, it is a
 pain actually sign every mail.  I don't see the benefits of signing
 every mail overcome the downside of having them on a netwroked
 machine. So, no.

Subject: [Ilugc] apache2-prefork-dev install problem
Message-ID: <463F6B1F.9090102@gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I have a rather strange problem - I have a Debian server running Apache2
(libapache2-mpm-prefork), and there is a particular module that I want
to use, and unfortunately it's not available in any of the Debian repos.
So I have to use apxs2 to compile this in.

However, when I try to apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork-dev which
provides apxs2, it threatens to remove my existing
(painfully-configured) postfix install and replace it with Exim4. Now, I
really don't want this to happen. I just want apxs2. What's it got to do
with postfix/exim4 ?

This doesn't seem to happen in my Ubuntu laptop though. Time to shift to
Ubuntu on the server?

Thanks,
V.

Guys, don't bother - I avoided this problem by doing an apt-get install 
of both apache2-prefork-dev and postfix, the latter just got upgraded.

as far as EM is concerned there is only one license, and there is no  
such thing as open source - only FLOSS

the whole idea is to show: 'look world i have a gpg' (the fact that  
it is of no use in a mailing list and that it irritates a lot of  
people is irrelevant)

Me neither beyond that its just as irritating, and makes readers feel
jealous by saying stuff like "Hi, I'll be at a conference in Paris from
May 10-15 2007. Please contact my secretary Miss Nimbupani for any issues"

You can try Kenneth's suggestion, that's what I do too after facing the
same problem as you do.
Otherwise try OpenDNS - http://www.opendns.com/
Hathway people realy need to do something about their DNS servers.

I personally dont like openDNS...at times it doesnt resolve even gmail.com.
I think you can use 4.2.2.2.

Sure, but dns latency can be very bad sometimes if you query a US based
NS host all the time.

I'd suggest what KG suggested, install dnscache, or bind's
caching-nameserver rpm

Or you can consider using your ISP providers DNS , OpenDNS and other
open dns like the 4 series (4.2.2.2 , 4.3.3.3)  along with pdnsd.
pdnsd is a daemon which caches dns requests so the latency wouldnt affect much.
Its similar to BIND but very low on resource and light weight.

I tried to install pdnsd using apt-get install on my feisty fawn, but got
the following errors. It got installed, but when attempting to start, throws
some errors. How do i get rid of them?

I got the new DNS IP from Hathway. As of now I am managing also with
OpenDNS. But I am planning switch to BIND to avoid the
inconsistance.

How about something more general (abstract!): Has the patent system really
benefitted the non software industry? What are the fundamental differences
between software and non software goods - from a patents point of view?

Hi,

Can someone suggest a good TV Tuner card that you have used on Linux
(preferably on Windows too...) and that is available in India
(chennai/bangalore).
I am searching around for Hauppage, but cant find one.
Intex/Techcom/Pinnacle/PixelView devices are flooding the market, but I dont
know if are Linux Compatible and certainly dont want to find it out the hard
way ;)

Thanks

I am using Leadtek TV 2000 Expert ( I bought it after doing some
search for  compatible cards for  Linux & all versions of windows)  &
it is working fine. It is available in Ritchie street.

Hauppauge's are impossible to find in india. Only the cheap one's from
Pinnacle and Pixelview are available. They are well supported in
Linux. You need to use the bttv or the sa17XX modules for these cards.

I use the Debian DVD images, and so do many of my friends. In my opinion,
the DVD images are the popular method now. Besides, net-install will be fast
only for computers inside IIT Madras. Also, the computer center doesn't have
to download it, because I can provide a copy.

Hi all,

We are coming out with a solution for collecting donations for an NGO in
Lucknow, the donations would then be spent in building  children's home.

We built one such solution using Drupal and Donorge module but the
transactions are limited to credit cards and  Paypal account holders. And
donorge.com FAQ's doesnt encourage me to carry on. Many Indian Payment
Gateways are charging high transaction charges like ccavenue.com details for
NGO account:

4214/-Rs for one time setup , 7% charges for credit card transactions and 4%
for netbanking. I really dont have any idea about banking domain so wont
comment on the amount they are charging.

Need wise advise on implementing Tax free transactions with minimal amount
loss.

thanks in advance

I must admit that paymet gateways are convenient. Buy why do you have
to pay an overhead of 2% or more per transaction for online payment?
Where are the bulk of payments coming form? India or outside India? It
makes sense to get payments from outside India through a payment
gateway but otherwise - it might be simply far more cheaper to go by
the traditional check or wire-transfer or dd method. Especially from
an NGO perspective you would want to optimize on every single paise
you get as donations.
For Indian donations you might want to open accounts in a few of the
top Indian banks and then give the account information for donors to
deposit the money directly. That should be the cheapest option. If
there are not too many donations it might be possible to just have
somebody enter the information into an online accounting system for
users to see

Well, indicating the solution on the list might benefit others who are
facing or will face the same problem, right? Unless, of course, it is
too involved, and requires expertise, which it doesn't since you say
it's simple!

Greetings, friends!!

I'm Sandip Patel, a FOSS enthusiast based in Bangalore. A few of my
colleagues in DeepRoot Linux (www.deeproot.in - I am proud to be a
part of this _real_ Free Software Company), based both in Bangalore
and Ahmadabad, have been working with me, on a portal developed
and maintained for and by the GNU/Linux community in India. We are
keen that this site becomes a meeting point for FOSS enthusiasts
and contributors in different parts of the country.

On behalf of the maintainers of http://www.gnulinux.in I warmly
invite all ideas, contributions and suggestions that you have, to
enhance and enrich the website. We're thankful for all suggestions
we have already received, and have much to thank the FOSS
community.

Here's what is on offer:

 * FOSS knowledge-base: articles
 * Technical forum discussions
 * Personal blogs (of course on GNU/Linux and surrounding topics)
 * Posting space for GNU/Linux, FOSS related job offerings
 * Polls on various aspects of FOSS (and the website).

And in a short while we are also planing to setup:

 * Student support section
 * Mailing list
 * Wiki etc

So come, share your experiences, and join us in spreading the joy
of using GNU/Linux and FOSS.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] : Elliptic Curve Cryptography Doubt
Message-ID: <5887.8263.qm@web36811.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Pardon me for asking a question not related to Linux.
   
  But I could not get any kind of help anywhere regarding the doubt of mine about Cryptography.
   
  I have been following www.certicom.com and the Cryptogrpahy book by William Stallings. I am trying to implement a very basic function to ecrypt data using Elliptic Curve Cryptography. But I am having trouble converting an arbitary message m to a Point Pm on the elliptic curve. I could not find a procedure to do this even after a lot of searching.
   
  If any one of you has implement ECC ( I am not talking about ECIES ) just the basic encryption/decryption then maybe you can help me.

Fair enough, and thanks for the effort, but did you guys ASK the fsf
(gnu.org) before registering gnulinux.in?

They may not object but in such cases its good to ask first

Uhh? Why is it necessary to ask the FSF? In this sense, I take it that 
everyone who uses the name `linux' in their FQDN has to ask Linus?

No. The Linux trademark guidelines don't require that. GNU is not a 
trademark afaik but it is courteous to ask the people involved.

We  are not "officially" fsf guys, we do  support FSF in its activities.
But most importantly we are "free software people" who really
believe in the value of Free Software and Software Freedom.

I usually use aptitude in place of 'apt-get', it might be able to give
you more information on problems like the one you had.

Nah, it is just a frontend. There's a lot that apt-get -f upgrade will
cure, by the way.  Especially if you have installed newer versions,
pinned a package to a particular version etc.

Hi,

I hope its possible to connect a laptop to a desktop for simply file
sharing purposes without any switch in between.

now this is the scenario.. very simple i believe.. but missing out some where..

i have a laptop with kubuntu edgy
i have a desktop with edubuntu feisty
i have a rj-45 cable...
NFS installed in both the machines...

do i need to do something in /etc/network/interfaces ? or change/ add/
edit hosts ?

what else need to be done to make my pc talk to my laptop for file
sharing purpose..

You should be using a cross-over cable to connect a laptop directly to a
desktop without a switch.

Once you connect using a cross over cable, assign IP addresses in the
same network for them and you can access one from the other. You said
that you have setup NFS already and that should help in sharing files.
But I would prefer running ssh and do scp/sshfs when needed.

cross over cable? is it rj-11 or rj-45..

rj-11 --> the telephone cable we use

rj-45 --> the avaya, amp, krone LAN cables...

or is it different?

does that mean the same gateway and different IPs..

Will it fine if i allocate the following for my laptop,

address 192.168.0.2
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.0.1

and the following for my desktop...

address 192.168.0.3
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.0.1

in the /etc/network/interfaces file and eth0 to be static?

The configuration looks good. Remove the gateway option. There is no
routing needed when you are in adhoc mode. Without gateway everything
should work fine.

RJ-45 ethernet crossover cable is what should be used.

crossover can be in rj 11 or rj-45 .
Its just the way the wires are crimped.
That is the order of the colors will not be the same at both end.
For your case ofcourse its rj-45 , since your card accepts only that.

Hi all,

While installing JDK 1.5 (i586) on Ubuntu 7.04 (x86-64) I get this
error:

Unpacking...

Any idea what this is because of? Is it possible that the file is

Subject: [Ilugc] Frequent crashes, interpreting kernel logs
Message-ID: <20070513012253.GA4219@greatbear>

Dear ILUGC,

Of late, my machine has been freezing sporadically with some
error. Though I have tried Googling the error, I have not been able to
get a satisfactory diagnosis of what the cause could be. Therefore, I
was wondering whether someone on the list could interpret the message
better.

Please note that I was using the NVidia provided drivers for the Riva
TNT2 card. I have currently disabled it, but have reason to suspect
that these crashes are independent of that. Also, I am using
reiserfs. I get the error with both the stock Debian Etch kernel
2.6.18-4-486 and a custom compiled 2.6.21.1. Is it a software problem
or a hardware problem?

Here's the relevant part of the syslog during that crash (when the
NVidia driver was present):

into which folder are you trying to unpack it? /home/<user> or some
other like /opt ? if its the later case ensure that you have necessary
read-write-execute permission to that folder... or try it with
sudo....

it might be a reason...

Message-ID: <10172.122.169.158.181.1179047843.squirrel@mail.sqlstar.com>

Dear All,

I have dual boot PC with win XP/ FC5. Grub is running.

My windows boot partition is lost.

My windows boot partition is lost. I am getting Error 18: While loading into
Windows at grub loader.

Also , while

sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/win/

NTFS-fs error (device sda1): ntfs_fill_super(): Not an NTFS volume.
NTFS-fs warning (device sda1): is_boot_sector_ntfs(): Invalid boot sector
checksum.
NTFS-fs error (device sda1): read_ntfs_boot_sector(): Primary boot sector

NTFS-fs error (device sda1): read_ntfs_boot_sector(): Mount option
errors=recover not used. Aborting without trying to recover.
NTFS-fs error (device sda1): ntfs_fill_super(): Not an NTFS volume.

-How do I retify this without losing my windows data?


Also ,

#fdisk -l        shows...

I hope, this program is under low priority now. But AFAIK, ELCOT is

Presently ELCOT is looking one or two guys for the support activity.
If anybody good in GNU/Linux Env (Suse Distro is +) and looking for

Hi,

 I dont know anything in perl. But I want answer to the following question. Can some one please send me the code fo the following.

1) A perl program that records a file with the 4 fields from the database. The fields are Emp_code, Emp_name, Basic_pay
Also program to find the following:

HRA = 12% of Basic Pay
DA = 6% of Basic Pay
Vehicle Allowances (VA) = 2.4% of Basic Pay
Professional Tax(PT) = 1% of Basic Pay
PF = 12 % of Basic Pay
Net_pay = Basic+pay + HRA + DA + VA - PF - PT

I am sorry if this is not the correct place to ask this query.

Regards
Indu

Lemme try to put it in an alternate way - You have a database with the
following fields - Emp_code, Emp_name, Basic_pay. And using the
database you want to calculate the above listed values which are based
on the Basic_pay or values calculated out of it for every employee
(and do you want the found values to be added to the database, i.e.
the record for the corresponding employee?)

Check this tutorial -
http://perl.about.com/od/perltutorials/a/perlmysql_3.htm

If you are looking for a flat file database (i.e. the fields are
stored in a file rather than a database) please check this link -
http://www.thescripts.com/serversidescripting/perl/tutorials/asimpledatabaseprogram/index.html

Seeing your question, this either seems to be some kind of assignment
or a question in an interview. So, IMHO it is better you learn how to
write the code than some one giving you the code and you just mugging
it up and presenting it. This is important because if they ask you to
do some modifications and run the code, if you do not know how to
write the code you will stumble badly.

hi
i am facing some problem while creating JPEG image

the error i get is

Warning: imagecreatefromjpeg() [function.imagecreatefromjpeg]: gd-jpeg: JPEG
library reports unrecoverable error:

and the image created is a blank image with 0 kb size
<?
$im=imagecreatefromjpeg("path_for_creating_jpeg_image");
?>
after googling out.. for the error.. i have checked the following.

1.my server config script is..

--with-gd' '--with-zlib' '--with-curl=/usr/local' '--with-freetype'
'--with-freetype-dir=/usr/X11/lib' '--with-jpeg-dir=/usr/lib'

which says that it has support for " jpeg " and the dir is pointed to
"/usr/lib"

2. and my phpinfo GD shows...

GD Support enabled
GD Version bundled (2.0.28 compatible)
FreeType Support enabled
FreeType Linkage with freetype
FreeType Version 2.1.10
GIF Read Support enabled
GIF Create Support enabled
JPG Support enabled
PNG Support enabled
WBMP Support enabled
XBM Support enabled


3. in the /usr/lib .

i checked whether.. the module "libjpeg.so " is there..
and it is present.. !

but still i am not able to solve this problem..!

any other info required from me..?

Pls help..

Thanks

And about his keynote speech at the recent Red Hat

And besides he can code as well(paid for his education

Imagecreatefromjpeg() doesn't support CMYK JPEGs.

If you get this error: "Warning: imagecreatefromjpeg(): gd-jpeg: JPEG

Message-ID: <566362.7678.qm@web7603.mail.in.yahoo.com>

hai all,

i have configured fetchmail on etch with
postfix+dovecot(imap).
it works on a  particular user.

say a user thanigai can retrieve mails from isp
server.but another user named  sathish can't retrieve
mails from isp server.

while user sathish give the command as "fetchmailconf"
it says that "  fetchmailconf must be run under X "
(but the user thanigai can run this command)
while user sathish give  the command "fetchmail" it
says that  "skipping message
sathish@unitedprotech.com@pop.unitedprotech.com:1 not
flushed"

where  sathish@unitedprotech.com is username
            pop.unitedprotech.com is the isp name.

for this how can i retrieve mails for sathish

Message-ID: <69621d830705141206i741776cbme8c2901cb4d086fe@mail.gmail.com>

I got this Siemens Gigaset PC 108 ( a wireless lan card for laptops) but
unfortunately couldn't find a proper driver to be used in Fedora Core 6. I
went through many sites to obtain a driver but no luck yet. Can anyone help
me locate a FC6 driver for this card or any other way to use the card in
FC6?

You need to install codecs:

I think the VLC player can play most formats without installing any codecs.

Subject: [Ilugc] Returnable - Spawning javascript code with just a simple
	html API
Message-ID: <3935b63b0705162133s6bf89a58oc510bbb5911da7b2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I just wanted to share with everyone a new project that i'm launching today
called the Returnable Project ( http://returnable.org )

Returnable serves as a open-platform architectural guide to advance the use
of the URL as a DSL for specifying 3 traits : content,its delivery ,and its
behaviour on the web through the use of Returnable elements embedded within
web pages .

It's a personal project but quite a bit of javascript ,php ,url rewrite
,regex and css hacking spread over a few months of research and prototypes .

You could call it a way to create events using html as the API,if you have
the initial script added to the DOM.here is a simple example .

step1: add the script
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://returnable.org/returnable-core.js
"></script>

step2: add a returnable elements
<span><returnable href='
http://onhover.local.returnable.org/tooltip.text/this is somethin/'>Hover
over this for a cool tooltip</returnable></span>
<span><returnable href='
http://onclick.local.returnable.org/tooltip.text/this is somethin/'>Hover
over this for a cool tooltip</returnable></span>

=> thats it ! ... some of the afvantages are that u can have line breaks,
future version will also have html. With this architecture in place, the
simple text can be replaced with content from another source.

This is a proof of concept. It can be particularly used by bloggers who
need'nt code . just give the corresponing html . as of the launch today
,only tooltip return types exists. others to be added are - alerts ,
widgets,maps and so on.

For bloggers who are looking for an easy way to have tooltips (in javascript
enabled blogs) ,this could nbe a great utility. You can go through the site
to see demos on how to create intuitive tooltips (and more apps coming soon)
with just one line of code (apart from the script node to be added initially
)

I finally have the working prototypes ,and the project website website on
sourceforge,as well as the official website (returnable.org) running . I
plan to add support for oprea,(ie ,ff as of now ) , add mroe return types,
documentation ,etc .

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0705171729310.8041-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

Hi All,

I am trying to do the bandwidth allocation using the Squid's delay
pools. I facing one particular issue in that, data rate increase in
the 1st pool is affecting the 2nd pool. Even after rearranging the
pools(1<->2), 1st pool data rate is affecting the 2nd pool.

Presently squid has 3 pools (1 local + 2 ext).A

Any pointers to solve this issue?

Dear ILUGC,

If you haven't noticed alredy, Fedora 7 is going to be released on May
31st (planned). Though there are many changes, the most significant
chamge I can see is the merging of Extras and Core into a single
repository, consisting of 7000+ packages. I feel this is a welcome
step. Also note the rename from Fedora Core to Fedora.

See http://fedoraproject.org/ and http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAQ

Look at networking projects that require help:

http://sf.net
http://freshmeat.net
http://savannah.gnu.org

> which s/w will be the best one(in terms of small code size,

Start of by looking at bug reports. Try to solve the bugs. Submit
patches. This will give you a feel of the code. You can then look at
development.

> mostly and widely
> used s/w) which i can contribute easily.

It depends on which language/platform the project is implemented in,
and what you are comfortable with. So, just check out the network
monitoring projects in the sites mentioned above and pick one.

Have fun,

SK

if you wish to contribute to a n/w monitoring tool,why dont you
contribute to " nagios " . Its a very widely used and sophisticated
tool.  You could probably write some plugins for it.

Are all dependent libraries installed? Try this:

apt-get build-dep gaim

It will install all dependencies.

I think you're missing binutils. Try installing build-essential.
Also check config.log as mentioned in the last line of the error. It should
be in /var/log I guess.
If you need anymore help on this, do post config.log too, it might help.
Also, this might be helpful http://forum.techspot.in/showthread.php?t=4221

AFAIK implementation-wise, ppl dont follow OSI stack. Its only for
theoretical purposes(correct me if i'm wrong) ie., Most real-world protocol
stacks dont differentiate between the application, presentation and session
layers. Mostly TCP/IP stack model is followed. ie., those layers are put
together as one.

Hi Ashok,

No, the work is not restricted to the application layer. There is a
lot of work being done at layer2/3. Generally companies don't write
the whole stack because it involves a lot of work. Most of the
companies buy the protocol stacks from vendors and port it to their
platform.

As an example, here is a vendor who sells stacks:
http://www.futsoft.com/protocol_stacks.htm

So most of the work will involve porting and fixing bugs in the stack
or developing the stack if you work in a product based company.

Similarly there is a lot of stack work happening in the telecom
industry as well.

Riyaz

There is work, but do ppl separate the work in layers 2 and 3 from the
application layer? Does any real world implementation exist where
application layer interacts with layer 2 and 3 that exist separately,
instead of enclosing those layer's work in itself?

Message-ID: <3c52da3c0705200406j182b6f2fxb4ccbe66c94a5176@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need a sort of simple network based message/event queue: A single
computer (perhaps many) adds events to the queue, which are processed
by many different systems (one event is processed by only one system).
I've used polling of a database effectively before, but would like a
more "neater" and efficient way.

If possible, I would also like a way which allows syncronizing certain
events, i.e. I should be able to say that out of all events falling in
a certain class, only one event should be available for processing at
a time. And of course without starving other unblocked events.

Also possibly in PHP (i.e. the event processors are running in PHP-CLI mode).

Google hasn't been of much help. Am I asking for too much?

Thanks,

I have been trying to install Pdigin from source on my Kubuntu Fiesty
Fawn (Pentium 4). I am facing two problems.

1. SSL/TLS is disabled by default ( I think some libraries are
missing, but what?)
2. I get errors while "make"ing.

Is this a middle ware problem? I guess you could use a messaging layer
like MQ. There are many opensource versions that fit the bill.
Althought they are primarily java based, you have web service oriented
ones that can allow PHP usage also.

http://www.osmq.org/ is an example.

I guess  there is a '--enable' flag for that (atleast thats what my

'./configure --help' should show the list of options.

Sorry, I forgot to mention, I tried that, but I think, I dont have
libTLS with me. Where do I find libTLS? apt-get doesnt find it.

It's not just a front-end, it has a dependency resolver which is more
powerful than apt-get

Yes, very much. For ex. if you are working on a router or a switch
your work will mainly involve only L2/L3 work. You might be working on
routing/switching protocols and you will not be concerned about the
application payload at all.

Friends.

I have kubuntu feisty fawn.
At booting up, It should show "Kubuntu" image and a progress bar.

But, it is not shown in my PC and it takes very long time to show the login 
kdm window.

After login, there no problem with the GUI.

How to solve this problem?

Thanks.

Thanks, after googling I've found one PHPMQ that does seem to do the
task, but was last updated in 2004 :(

I'm looking for something really simple here: I was thinking that
since this should be a very common scenario, there should be simple
existing solutions. JMS seems great, but I really don't want the java
bloat. Isn't there anything based in C :) ?

Btw, this is a simple intranet deployment that I have in mind.

PHPMQ, I don't remember seeing it at all. I worked on JMS for some
time, but PHPMQ, for some reason was never in the picture. We used
java for that portion while the rest stayed PHP!

I ve seen only IBMs MoM (MQSeries, it is called and is not free!) that
had a C interface. I remember using it for a while.

Then I guess JMS will do. A well configured JVM might behave just as well too.

I remember using the following flag while compling gaim:
-enable-gnutls=yes

I had some dependency problems with gtk and gstreamer. Its installed, but
the aforementioned flag doesn't seem to do the trick.

./configure o/p said gnuTLS was compiled.

 sudo dpkg-reconfigure usplash

Incase any splash package configuration problem, it may get rectified..

 Incase u have installed more than one usplash screen(may be from edubuntu
artwork, or ubuntu artwork), do the following before the above.
 sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so

At this rate Fedora should soon run out of numbers. No sooner have I got
comfortable with one version, I see another has already come out.
Considering the countless number of linux(-alites)...each one has its own
offspring tree as prosperous as a hyacinth...I wonder what the point of all
this proliferation is about?

Is it FOSS or FUSS??

I have long since been a staunch Redhat user. From Redhat 7 right upto
Fedora 5. Now I am tired of doing two more ++'s from a Linux magazine
CD/DVD.

I am complaining..yes..but it is kind of becoming(or has it already become)
a trifle too confusing...wouldnt you say?

Off late i discovered a bug with kdm in Kubuntu Feisty fawn, it has
been reported in Launchpad and have added mine to it. I had a similar
problem but mine was during shutdown, I neither got the usplash screen
nor the system was shutting down. Mine is actually Ubuntu Feisty over
which I installed kubuntu-desktop. I just now changed my default to
gdm and it now works fine.

One of the plus point about any FOSS project is fast releases with enough

If you have to take the Java route, you should try MantaRay. Looks like 
they changed their name since the last time I looked, but I've heard 
good things about them:

If I'm not wrong, they have the fastest JMS implementation around.

One cant just release one version and sit idle. And FYI Fedora is a testing
bed for RHEL versions which are quite good for day to day activities and
development and even as servers for many. All these releases will have
Release Notes and Change logs, so before going to a new release, do read
them, see whether you really need them and then use it accordingly. It
shouldn't be like, you got a new release and you have to go for it. I have
seen many staying with Fedora Core 3 still and they feel its a solid release

Is it FOSS or FUSS??


I dont see any FUSS around here, rather IGNORANCE

My other point is this: Can i choose to safely and comfortably throw away

I use linux as my primary desktop too.
Except for gaming. And Microsoft has a stranglehold on the gaming front.
Until linux specific games are released, Windows will remain on my PC...

Two years ago, I gaveup Win and using only Linux as my Desktop adn server.
I never needed a win box to a job.
Linux can do most of the things.

Now, Linux is fully suitable for a Desptop Machine too.

Can you please put in bullet points what are your day-to-day activities that
you do in Windows ?

Except for gaming, I dont see a point that one is persuaded to use Windows !
But again no one here is telling that you should only use Linux or Windows,
its all your choice and this mailing list is to help people who are having
some problems with Linux.

this article is pure BS

1. the main reason why doze guys do not look for another operating  
system is that they are unaware of the fact that other operating  
systems exist. They buy computers like they buy fridges or tvs - they  
come with an OS and no one questions it. So why would they question  
the OS on the computer

2. multilicity of distros doesnt worry anyone because the dont know  
about this also. In india all anyone knows is redhat

3. Command line? in linux? you must be kidding

4. compatible hardware is a point - but a very minor point

5. geekiness - here we have to blame the ubuntu crowd that puts  
crappy guis on the market and forces people to learn command line.  
But there are mandriva, suse, redhat ... that dont have this problem

the main bar to spread of linux is that people just dont know there  
is such a thing out there.

The information that Linux exists is not exactly classified, nor is it 
controlled by a company - so if there is a real need for an alternative 
desktop OS, the word should get out, right? Perhaps it's just that 
regular people just can't be bothered? Or perhaps Apple keeps most of

Nobody can stop information from spreading these days, especially if 
it's important ;-)

I beg to differ but it is not a minor point. If say a modem doesn't
work in Linux, I would not use it as I can't live without the
internet. In fact, I had this problem with my USB DSL modem and I had
to do loads of research on the net to find a driver. Even when I
managed to find source for "some" USB DSL driver, I couldn't install
it. (big story - probed it after running some shell script after
reading code but no option for this modem, blah blah..). Finally, I
had to get my modem changed to Ethernet modem. All this because, the
dam modem manufacture had written driver only for windows.

yes - but you need a distro like mandriva which makes the command

you didnt go back to doze. Most people either get their hardware to  
work with linux or, once bitten, make sure it is compatible before  
buying it - so it is a minor point

That is what the article says! You need to work to get it running on
Linux while the vendor works to get it running on Windows. And when I
pay anything more than Rs.500 for a piece of hardware and it does not
work, it pains. To be honest, I am still researching to get my onboard
nvidia card to work with direct rendering, which has cost me a couple
of reinstalls, kernel downgrades, internet time and what not!!! I bet
my dad would not spend a minute like that. And I picked that board
even before I heard of what Linux is!

And that is likely what will happen with most people who are trying to
switch OS, at least for the cost factor involved! Just my opinion.

It will compile detect the card and all that, but will never turn
direct rendering on. And if I added some related clauses to xorg.conf,
it will hose my xserver! Worst it it won't roll back fully! I have not
tried this with the >2.6.18 kernel yet, no time and more importantly
no patience!

I installed Nvidia drivers manually for OpenSuse 10.1.
The only lines that that I added to the xorg.conf file were :

Driver "nvidia"
Load   "glx"

I was able to play Doom 3 after that. :)
What card do you have, btw ?

nvidia has far better driver support for linux compared with radeon.
What card is your anyways . maybe someone here can help you set up
direct rendering.

That was what I thought too. Driver is nvidia and I have Load glx
also. My doubt is because I have an onboard card. I am probably having
the wrong amount of memory alloted. I can post the specs in a day or
two. and thank you.

what about when you manufacture a lan card.
MAC has a specific layer.
tcp/ip are maybe coupled though they are in different layers.
But still thats a separate layer.
if you are writing a web server  you will be using the tcp/ip
implementation(probably) but not recreating it.
Difference of layers do exist. But the study of layers itself is just
academical as you said.
The developers who work with a particular layer are not required to be
concerned about the position of this layer in the stack or what is
above or below it.
Thats exactly why it has been divided into layers :)

Hi luggies!

      Can i get a idea about migrating a domain from one server to another
without changing Domain Name and Name Servers(NS)(i,e. i've placed a domain
in ONE server www.guitarvasu.info which has the name server entry as
ns1.tsrinivasan.com&ns2.tsrinivasan.com. I've planned to move the domain
guitarvasu.info to anotherserver )

Give your ideas to implement the same with 0% down time of
www.guitarvasu.info

Warm Regards
vasu

run netstat and see if port 22 is open, try starting sshd on someother 
port,  look into dmesg/ (var/log/messages) for logs  .. manually start 
sshd in debug mode,

If firewall/iptables is running, stop it and then try to connect to 
the ssh port.

I had never used windows on my personal laptops/desktops.  First thing i 
do after a  I get a laptop/desktop is to recover the space occupied by 
windows.  I really don't know how to use a windows box.  It appears to 
be too difficult.

I am not sure about totem, but you can install mplayer or xine and 
associated plugins. If you are on fedora, install livna repository and 
just rum "yum install mplayer* xine*" .. you are ready to go:)  enjoy 
your movies :)

1. Set a short ttl for the A and MX records for guitarvasu.com (10m)

2. Once the ttl takes effect (if the old TTL is 1 day then next day):
	a. Change MX record to point to the new mailserver host
	b. Change A record to point to the new IP
	c. Config the new box's mailserver to host mail for your domain

I am using FC 5. I googled for "fsck.ntfs" Couldn't find one for FC 5.

Do you have any reference where to download?

Subject: [Ilugc] Five crucial things the Linux community doesn't 
	understand about the average computer user
Message-ID: <55666.61.247.255.57.1179920205.squirrel@www.songbirdtech.com>

I think one of the things that the linux community does not understand
about ordinary users is that:

1) Installing new hardware and setting it up is still a very geeky
activity on Linux. Regular users want to buy and use a new printer, web
cam, scanner, mouse, monitor, DSL connection etc without having to monkey
around with CUPS, monitor modprobing, kernel recompiling etc. Most users
are not even keen on reading the installation manuals that come with their
DSL connections. They want to pop in a CD and click on "setup" and be done
with  the installation of the software, drivers etc.

To ask them to go through some obscure site on the net and wade through
some discussion forums just to get their new monitor/printer/DSL modem/etc
recognized properly is asking for too much.

And even for those few users who actually bother to read installation
manuals that come with their hardware, the manuals are mostly targeted at
windows users.

2) For most people, OS is not a religion. Most users won't even know what
is an OS and neither do they care to know. They don't really care about
this so called FREE-as-in-FREEDOM OS if their printer is not ready to work
in 5 minutes after they have connected it to their computers.

3) You get very little support if you call up BSNL/Airtel etc and ask why
your DSL modem is not working with the Linux distro installed on your
machine.

4) Games. Need I say more. To say that OpenGL on Linux is any comparison
to DirectX is to be totally deluded. OpenGL covers a minute subset of the
functionality that is there in DirectX 9. And now DirectX 10 is out and
there is no comparison at all. For those who disagree, please consider
looking at the Crysis Engine 2 or any other upcoming DirectX 10 titles.

If someone wants Unix, but yet wants to run their usual desktop app, then
I would recommend Mac OSX and not Linux. If money is a problem, I would
ask them to compromise and go for Linux.

you have to just change the ip in the nameserver config files - and  
then shit your files to the other server.

Deepan, I'm surprised you did not get it right. We do not expect the
candidate to work on .NET and Windows APIs. We expect him to have
experience in those technologies to develop or add features to
Subversion on Windows platform.

Why lick on windows a** and get ideas? Do you think candidates would always
wait for thier features ( API info you have mentiuned), get motivated to
add such features and copy the work?

You thinking/ideas are not in sync with what you want to achieve...

If you have data in the machine you must be careful.
But I usually use this step to recover

1. Use the windows boot disk and boot from CD
2. somewhere during the start of installation it will ask for selecte
Reparir
3. You select going to the microsoft repair console. 
4. You will get a command prompt. 
5. There is a command  "fixboot". This will fix your boot record.

Go to linux and then type

rootnoverify /dev/sda1
chainloader +1

and boot into windows.


Now, for the NTFS partition error,

1. In the same microsoft repair console DOS prompt, type chkdsk 
   chkdsk can fix most of the problems but sometimes you may lose
   data too.


Be doubly careful before doing any changes to the disk if you have a lot
of data in the disk. Try read-only mount of the ntfs partition on linux
and also try some ntfs recoery tools if you can grab hold of one.
Most of the times, the problem will get solved with chkdsk + fixboot. 
All the best !

One of my friends is on the lookout for a web developer to get his
company's website up and running. He is looking for a Linux based
solution. It would be a paid short term engagement.

You may be a freelancer as well. Experience in dealing with images
(banners et.al.) and in CSS is necessary. You are to gather the
requirements and suggest the best alternative (custom php pages or
cms based soln.... etc.), and implement it.

The site would be a commercial one, featuring products, about the
company, contact, news etc....

Please contact me offlist.

Run then.  Or hang around some more time and see how well regarded
porting open source apps cross platform is ..

And can you stop playing l337 hxx0r d00d and using weird high ascii

Subject: [Ilugc] Structure copy behaviour
Message-ID: <1179984180.8607.24.camel@sujith-lnx>

Hi,

Say I have a structure :

typedef struct {
	...
	...
	...
} tmp;

And I do this :

tmp a[256];
tmp t;

a[0] = t;

Now, for this structure copy how does gcc decide that :

1) It should generate a call to memcpy
2) Generate instructions to manually do the copy.

What is the threshold for the structure's size that changes gcc's
behaviour ?
And is there any gcc parameter to change this threshold value ?

regards,
Sujith.

Agree. Having seen how many people use svn through TortoiseSVN, and how 
much they appreciate it's simple interface over other bloated/overpriced 
SCM solutions, I think they're doing a very good job. Let's not be 
fanatical about this stuff just for the heck of it.

>From what I remember, gcc always does a shallow copy (case 1) and as an
optimization, it implements copy-on-write.

Basically, assigning a[0] = t will have t and a[0] pointed to the same
location till you change either t or a[0]. At that point, there will be a
memcpy for sizeof(tmp) from &t to &a[0] and then the write will happen.

If you want to have a deep copy, only option I can think of right now is to
do it in C++ and implement the copy constructor and also overload the
assignment operator. (this is your case 2).

PS: My C and C++ are kind of rusty since I have not coded in them for the
last 4+ years. If things have changed since then, someone will be able to
correct it :)

Hmm.

Can you compile this program using the following command and take a look
at test.s ?

gcc -save-temps test.c [ without any optimization flags ]

#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
	char val[64];
} tmp;

int main()
{
	tmp a[256];
	tmp i;
	a[0]=i;
	return 0;
}

Now change val[64] to anything higher, say val[68] and look at test.s
now. All the movl instructions have been replaced by a single call to
memcpy.

Is there a way to change this behaviour ?

Sujith.

Entirely up to you. It still looks silly and immature though, so I do
hope you're not going to do things like email a prospective employer
with that.

unfortunately he has a very unusual skill-set, so his peculiar

But you are wasting your money, because you already paid for it. Next
time you buy a laptop, get one without OS or one with GNU/Linux
pre-installed.

No I don't use this with my official email Id, but I wish I could.  I am 
not sure why you don't like them. These minor things fuel my passion :) 
.  Initially when I saw these characters I was wondering how to type 
these, later I learned ctrl+shift+u+<ascii code> would let you enter any 
unicode character in GTK applications.  These things are not obvious for 
me, I am from biology background. I learned these things couple of 
months back.  I have nothing against your opinion. Thanks for your 
comments. I will make sure not  to use them, when I mail a prospective 
employer.   I use them in my blog too :)

Using unicode is fun. But do remember that your blog is one of the first
things that turn up when someone (say a prospective employer) googles you up

The high ascii thing is old though, to not be funny or cool any longer
.. if you knew chinese for example you could have even more fun with
multiple ways to spell the same name..

Another important point to make, I had seen few resumes with "r?sume"  
or  "resum?", in the title. I am not sure about the rational behind 
this. (French origin?? )  For example   
http://www.designersnotebook.com/Resume/resume.htm.   I guess one ascii 
(special)  character is tolerable, not all of them :) agreed.   Thanks 
for the nice discussion.

Took me a bit to find out.. but here is the reason:

gcc replaces calls to structure copy and pass by value copies with a call to
a library call (memset and memcpy). That is the reason for you getting
different assembly code for char[64] and char[68]. It is not a compile time
option you can change. However, according to what I read, the code is in
asm-i386.h in function struct_cpy. The following post might help you better
:)

  1) A computer is an expensive, useful, general purpose
     tool. Researching the purchase of the machine and peripherals for
     compatibility seems reasonable.  As long as it is possible to
     accomplish the task with some hardware, it does not matter that
     some hardware vendors make incompatible equipment.

        Actually, I think it is easier than getting  things not blessed
 by the Vendor to work on Vista.  And now that some hardware
 manufacturers are pre-installing Linux, it means that drivers are often
 available (Dell distributes their printer driver for my color laser as
 a GPL'd .deb).

        Frankly, I would not buy hardware before learning whether it
 supports Linux; and boycott the other hardware vendors.

> 2) For most people, OS is not a religion. Most users won't even know

  2) Free software is about community; and people who care and
     participate, it is not a marketing machine; it is a group of people
     getting together to help each other achieve more from computers.

        These people are not part of the free software community, and I
 see no real reason to try to cater to them.  Free software is about
 community; is it surprising that no extraordinary effort is made to
 pander to those who are resistant to inclusion?

        Again, this is not about gaining market share.

> 3) You get very little support if you call up BSNL/Airtel etc and ask

  3) The free software community helps each other; and the network has
     the results of people sharing how they made things work, and the
     pitfalls to avoid.

        ISP's, retail shop salespeople, hardware vendors might not be
 clued in to free software, which is only recently encroaching into the
 mainstream, but the community provides its own resources to each
 other. This is why this LUG is here, and why people participate.

> 4) Games. Need I say more. To say that OpenGL on Linux is any
>    comparison  to DirectX is to be totally deluded.
  4) Free software is not everything for all people.

        I've generally been very happy with nethack, angband, and tome,
 since I don't do twitch games, but I realize that this is not what
 people want. I've been OK with Worl of Warcraft using cedega and
 transgaming wine emulators.

   5) Free software is written by people who have an itch to scratch,
      and for like minded people. The basis is what I label as "The
      Dinid Philosophers Solution" -- it is written for other people who
      pick up the fork and help feed each other.


        Feeding hangers on who just want a free meal is not really a
 primary motivation.  Sure, having the meal in the open where anyone can
 pick up a fork lets new fork-weilders join in, but making extraordinary
 effort to feed the non-participating is not something very likely to
 happen on a broad scale.

I actually spell it as r?sum?, which I think is the right form. But all

Correct - though the other three variants aren't exactly correct.

This is from Merriam-Webster:

Main Entry: r??su?m?
Variant(s): or re?su?me or re?su?m? /'re-z&-"mA, "re-z&-' also 'rA- or "rA-/
Function: noun
Etymology: French r?sum?, from past participle of r?sumer to resume,
summarize, from Middle French resumer

Some proverb (I don't remember which one, someone who knows let me know)
says that rain benefits everyone on earth, irrespective of who they are.
Similarly, we want free software to benefit everybody, without requiring
them to understand software and hardware. Examples: five-to-ten year-old
kids, sixty-years-and-older people. This requires some effort on our part,
and the benefits are worth it.

Also, computers are becoming ubiquitous
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing>, and we want those
computers to run free software. Otherwise, we will be forced to use
proprietary software. Replacing proprietary software is easier on desktop
computers, it is tougher on embedded systems.

That does not mean I give something substandard to my dad. Its
important to let your people know what they are losing, even if it
does not matter too much. What if he gave it to his friends son, a
gaming freak?? That sort of assumption is not good for any
professional, of any field and there are words to describe such
intentions. Sorry, your reply really hurts.

        If that floats your boat, go for it.  There are lots of free
 software people, like me, who are not interested in creating
 appliances, but tools.

I don't find asm-i386.h
I grepped for struct_cpy and found it in asm-i386/string-486.h

#define struct_cpy(x,y)                         \
({                                              \
        if (sizeof(*(x)) != sizeof(*(y)))       \
                __struct_cpy_bug;               \
        memcpy(x, y, sizeof(*(x)));             \
})

Is this the definition that you are talking about and will changing
this definition will it help ?

We are already seeing more and more embedded systems coming with Free
Software and it will be 100% real soon (Eben Moglen predicts it is
within 5 years and I agree with him).

"Now we have forty percent of the server market. We're going to have a
hundred percent of the appliance market within five years. That's a
trivial economic deduction from the following simple fact: when you
sell a four-hundred dollar palm top, you can afford to pay a license
fee for its operating system, of $24.95, or $49.95, or incur expensive
in-house development activity and make a Palm OS. When the box costs
fifty bucks, there's no room left for paying $12.95 to Mister Gates:
we win. We win."

That was not my intention. I have been using a laptop with ATI
graphics card and I didn't even notice I was missing something
(obviously I was not playing any games that require 3D support - I
only play GNOME mines, once in a while) because the Free Driver that
came with my distro was good enough. And the experience was not
substandard.

It is not our problem that NVIDIA and ATI does not release Free Driver
and not even release the specs. Now we recommend everyone to use Intel
graphics cards, which has Free drivers for 3D support. When people
chose not to buy NVIDIA and ATI and go for Intel they will realise.

Now when Dell is going to release their laptops with GNU/Linux
pre-installed and thye will go with only those hardware which work. So
this isn't much of an issue once more people start pre-installing
GNU/Linux like Dell.

You don't have to give substandard thing for your dad, but a system
with Intel motherboard and Intel graphics card with 3D support.

Message-ID: <a3bcf7260705250055r5d7d1260g697fdbf890933fdc@mail.gmail.com>

the procedure was quite simple for establishing BSNL DATAONE connection on
SuSE.

1)go to YaST
2)select network devices
3)click on DSL to create a broadband connection
4)add a dsl connection
5) in PPP mode select PPP over Ethernet
6)configure your ethernet card
             i)select the appropriate one
             ii)set the gateway as 192.168.1.1
             iii)you can set your own ip address or let DHCP provide you a
dynamic ip address .say set  it to 192.168.1.30.
            iv) you can set dns server ip by yourself if you want .the BSNL
service provide give you these details.or else the pppd will automatically
search for DNS and set
7)you can activate connection at boot time or you can do it manually.
8)now proceed to next step by providing name of the service
provider.setdataone(your choice)
9)set the user name and password for your connection
10)now select the checkbox for "automatically retrieve DNS" and "set DNS
automatically" if you havent set the DNS yourself.
11)proceed further and your dsl connection has been set.

a confirmation of this setup is that you get an icon on bottom panel
resempling a white coloured plug left-click on it to dial in and right click
to disconnect.

you can also set the DNS manually by editing /etc/resolv.conf and adding
lines as "nameserver xxx.yyy.zzz.www"

you can also manually start the connection by typing" ifup dsl0" at the
prompt in  terminal



i hope this helps those who are unable to connect to BSNL dataone in SuSE

Good. I am trying to fix what I have. Neither an intel board nor an
intel graphics card.

Happy that your intentions were not otherwise. If my gl worked, even
if not to its best, i wouldn't worry a tad about it. I guess my end of
the discussion should stop here.

Since you didnt mention - I presume its a i386 machine you have there..

so here you go, although I recommend you install the repository (
instructions at http://centos.karan.org/ - use the section that talks
about up2date )

http://centos.karan.org/el4/extras/stable/i386/RPMS/repodata/repoview/wine-0-0.9.24-1.el4.kb.html

Out of curiosity, was it your intention to change gcc's behaviour in
the struct copy case
If so what files did you change and did it involve recompiling gcc ?

I wasn't aware of the fact that gcc would generate a call to memcpy in
case of large structure copies.
And I didn't recompile gcc, I fixed my code. :)

Manoj Srivastava raises some interesting points which highlights exactly

Understood. That is a valid point. Linux developers create software for
themselves not for others and if others too benefit from the software
which the linux users created for themselves, then it is an added bonus,
but if not, nothing is lost for the linux developer. I agree with you on
that assessment.

Perhaps ordinary users have very different types of needs than does a
Linux developer, which is perhaps why they don't use Linux as much.

And there is nothing wrong in that. It is fair that a Linux developer
develops it for his own benefit and not for others.

If the consensus among Linux developers is that Linux is developed only
for themselves and others with the exact same needs (other geeks), then we
don't need to continue this discussion further about why regular users are
not flocking to linux.

IMHO, interesting but ultimately pointless exercise because Linux does not
yet have the kind of numbers to interest hardware makers.

It comes back to your point - perhaps the hardware makers have decided to
target only Windows and Apple users. And that is fair too.

Yes, but not all users hang out on ilug. And expecting them to hang out on
an internet user group so that they can just get their internet connection
working is perhaps not the right approach to solving the problem.

The problem for several of us is at a more lower, social, level. The
issue here is not just about us helping each other to utilize our
computers in a better manner but also about eliminating the grip that
the mammoth companies have over our society.

Free software is also about educating "normal people" about the evils of
proprietary software. If we don't try and tell other people as to why
free software is better than proprietary software, then evils such as
DRM, patents on software & algorithms, and proprietary software itself
cannot be eliminated.

Free software, Free world. That's encompasses a lot more than just
philosophers feeding each other.

Free Advice for the Litigious...

"All of which is to say - no amount of fear can stop the rise of free
media, or free software (they are the same, after all). The community
is vastly more innovative and powerful than a single company. And you
will never turn back the clock on elementary school students and
developing economies and aid agencies and fledgling universities - or
the Fortune 500 - that have found value in the wisdom of the open
source community. Open standards and open source software are
literally changing the face of the planet - creating opportunity
wherever the network can reach."

Message-ID: <406f1f3f0705250601v1e821015r29cfbf70ceef6dbb@mail.gmail.com>

One difficulty that linux faces in govt enterprises is the profusion
of vb and access based applications in govt departments which makes
transition from windows to linux impossible. You can get vb+access
programmers at dime a dozen and the development time is also very
minimal. A competing technology would be php+mysql applications. PHP
based web applications have a comparable development time when
compared with VB applications. Additionally web based applications
would make the transitioning from windows to linux much easier because
the application would be run from the browser in both cases. But the
catch is that you dont have the level of control over printing from
web applications that you have from a vb application. Yes you have
some css based control in terms of margins, padding etc. But when it
comes to creating content suited to page sizes it is very difficult.
Another issue is pagination. When you have content spanning multiple
pages you barely have any control in terms of the positions of the
content. You have some control in terms of page breaks but that too
very laboriously.
So is there some simple standard and easily reproducible solution to
this problem. If there is, then it would be the key to large scale
migrations from windows to linux machines in govt establishments.

IMHO are there powerful  games in linux which are in wide use ( as of now)
to have 3D rendering ??
And if you are going to take pains to run win* games by wine you can also
take pains to install Nvidia drivers.

It should be in the CD's provided by the vendor.
But I guess the rpm name should be something different like
"glib-devel<http://rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/PLD/dists/ac/ready/i386/glib-devel-2.3.5-1.i386.html>"
I am not sure:(

Huh? Why would a *server-side* script have control over the client's
printer? If you need printing on a local machine, feel free to write a
PHP-CLI application that does the same.

Alternatively, you can write PHP that generated JavaScript to do the
printing, just like what happens when a user clicks on the 'print this
page' button on several websites.

Untrue. Pagination with PHP works just fine. Do a Google search for
'pagination with PHP' and see how many scripts that turns up. Maybe it's
not as easy as VB's 'drag-and-drop', but do companies pay programmers
just to drag-and-drop stuff all day long?

The fact is that you can achieve the same results (if not better) with
open source solutions, atleast in the web arena. The
companies/government et al. are just not aware of it. Even that scenario
is changing given the sudden shift of emphasis of the industry to PHP.
Look at the number of jobs being offered to PHP programmers, there's
more demand than supply in India.

        This is not an unlaudable goal.  I  wonder, though, how
 prevalent that view is amongst the worker bees of free software, as
 opposed to the armchair intellectuals.  In my experience with people in
 free software development, I have never heard the goal above stated as
 a major motivator (and never heard it stated so succinctly).

        The original discussion revolved around what needs to be done by
 the creators of free software -- and while saving the world from
 software patents and DRM can't be argued against, it usually lies in
 the same sphere as ending world hunger or curing aids. Nice, but rarely
 does one spend 20-40 hours a week doing that in ones free time, unless
 one is very very unusually motivated.

        The result is that the general free software development flows
 down the scratching ones itch route.  If people are truly motivated
 in catering to the unwashed masses in order to save the world, they
 need to gird up their lions and actually pitch in and do the work.

I consider free software as social service, and as philanthropy. Government,
university, and non-profit funding agencies will want it that way. I was
under the impression that the whole of our community thought that way, too.

The benefits are for the users, not for the developers. Perhaps we should
ask the funding agencies to pay the developers for such work?

The replacement Linux-es for Microsoft- and Symbian- based mobile phones and

I think what he meant was how the various elements in the page were
printed. If you have a page with numerous elements,  you can't have
control over where(in which page) a particular element will be
printed.

The best solution is - the script can generate a PDF file with all the
content positioned correctly.

        I don't pretend to speak for _all_ the developers, and I don't
 think there is a consensus. But I can attest that a sizeable segment of
 the developer community does indeed share my views. The result is that
 the general free software development flows down the scratching ones
 itch route.  If people are truly motivated in catering to the unwashed
 masses in order to save the world, they need to gird up their lions and
 actually pitch in and do the work.

        I think we are on the cusp of change on that. Dell is now
 preloading Ubuntu, IBM says all their hardware  is compatible with
 Linux; HP also sells Linux on some hardware.

        I think you'll see more interest from hardware vendors in the
 future. Heck, Dell has a Debian package for their printer driver.

        There are even more venues out on the 'net. Debian user mailing

        Ha! That would be the day. But sure, if you think that'll work,
 go for it.

It is true that most of the *current* free software is a result of
scratching your own itch. But the entire GNU project was founded with
the exact goal of being a replacement for the then proprietary Unix -
and what good is a replacement that isn't used by the masses?

Over the course of time, free software developers; or the worker bees as
you call them, have indeed forgotten the *original* motivation behind
free software. A trend perhaps started by Linus - I doubt if he really
knew the moral and social implications of releasing his kernel under the
GPL. He did it simply because he really didn't care if the source was
visible to the whole world, something that any university student his
age would have done at the time.

Let's not forget that the "armchair intellectuals" of today were the
"worker bees" of the past, albeit, with different motivations.

Indeed, saving the world from DRM can hardly serve as a motivator for
writing software these days. However, it certainly plays a role in the
marketing of the software that is written. Regardless of why free
software is written, a small portion of the free software community
*must* be devoted to convincing the masses to actually use that software
- not only for the greater good of the society but also for the
developers of the software itself. I quote from Frederick P. Brooke's
"The Mythical Man-Month":

"Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as
his reward? <snip>
The pleasure of making things that are useful to others. Deep within, we
want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this respect the
programming system is not essentially different from a child's first
clay pencil holder `for daddy's office`"

I don't question the motivation of free software developers. However, I
oppose the view that free software developers shouldn't care about
whether their software is used by the masses or not. As long as there
are people ready to do the pushing voluntarily, the problem is solved.
The worker bees keep developing software for whatever reason - while
others spend time in convincing the masses to use that software. The
free software community is not only made of developers who can code but
also of people who are interested in spreading its message.

Of course, a small percentage of free software developers *can* afford
to keep "free society" as their major motivator: a vast majority of
university professors and students - who have nothing to lose. And of
course, people who are paid to write free software.

The essence here is not to forget the original goal of free software
development - and one of the objectives is to get the masses to use it.
The OLPC project is an exemplary example.

Hi ,

Today i joined the debian bug  mailing list , hoping to take part in
the bug fixing process.

Anyway the mails that come from them are in the number of 100+ in last 6 hours.

I am just curious , is there any other efficient way of getting to
look only at the areas I am interested in.

Since when i see such huge number of mails , I generally don't read
any of them.And could possibly stack up in the future.

I don't prefer digest modes.

Maybe I am missing on some othr kind of  system.

If there be any , kindly let me know.

I use procmail to sort my gentoo-bugs. procmail uses perl-like syntax
and is extremely powerful in terms of sorting mail. I discard bugmail
that isn't relevant to me and send the rest of the bugs into categorized
folders. Since all of the bugmail is generated by bugzilla, it should be
easy to filter.

Thunderbird filters could be made to work like procmail, but aren't as
powerful and not portable since thunderbird works on the client-side
while procmail is permanent server-side organization. However, everyone
doesn't have access to their IMAP/POP server to redirect mail to
procmail - in which case client-side filters are good.

Read it off a newsfeed (gmane say) - a newsreader like slrn should help

Message-ID: <69621d830705251004s2db21195h854e67c249850a30@mail.gmail.com>

I want to buy a new machine. But i am very confused about this....

which PC is good...

a) intell processor(p4 or core 2 duo)+intell mother board+G-force7600

b)AMD(athlon fx or 64 3200+ )+compatible mother board(MSI or
Gigabyte)+G-force7600


I know for gaming Amd is good but it's overall power is less than pentium.
AMD 64 3200+ is 2.8 Ghz where P4 has 3 Ghz speed moreover AMD's cache is
512kb(L1 & L2) & Pentiums cache is  2 MB. Also see tht gforce is better than
ati.

friends, please help me to take decision.

I worked with Ubuntu Feisty Fawn and Fedora 6 , but I opt to stay with

Be aware, variants of Gigabyte boards come with Nvidia display
chipsets for which binary only drivers are available; also, ensure
what LAN chip is on the board.

I have similar config, but every now and then I have problems with LAN
(not b'cos it is running AMD) and, till this date, I could not tweak
the sound card to work properly with Fedora (worked once !!!).

Otherwise, I do not have any complaints :-)

True-- but again quoting Ayn Rand-- Producing free software is not  some
altruistic activity-- it is the most selfish expression  of a programmers
self---  scratching ones own itch -- precisely amounts to that

Softlinks can be made by using the command ln -sv <File name> <Destination>

!.The size of the soft link is equal to the text size(each character is of
size 1 Byte) of the PATH of the original file.
!!. The permission of the softlink are lrwxrwxrwx,where 'l' indicates soft
link.
!!!.Only root can make a link in / partition.The owner and the group of the
soft link is root.Still the original file can be modified by its owner or
groupmembers.
!/\ Color of the softlink can be changed from DIR_COLORS directory. In
SuseLinux it is in /etc and is common to all users.

I use gmail and I cant live with pop.
So have to rely on gmail filters and that needs manual creation of each filter.
Maybe as Suresh suggested reading off the news reader is the best solution.

I wonder  what is so wrong in  That .  I think it is because you might not
have been follwing  the definitions - free software means -- Free as in
Freedom . All the works of  Ayn Rand are dedicated to promote that single
thought .

To quote her  again-- Freedom in any aspect means freedom from coercion.
Now check your premises correctly and see who is practising that better,
the  FSF movement or the giants from Redmond

Sure. But then GPL comes along and spoils all the fun :p. Somehow, I 
have a tough time seeing AR and RMS seeing eye to eye on any issue at 
all. They're both polar opposites in what they preach (and I'm probably 
insulting AR's intelligence by making a comparison in the first place). 
Creating software for fun sure is a selfish intention and I think would 
be noble in AR's eyes, but the 'mandatory' sharing she would have chafed 
at :)

I would recommend Intel Pentium 4 (or core 2 duo)
based on what you want, and Intel Motherboad without
ATI / GeForce Chipsets. You would be better off with
945 / 925 / 915 chipset.

Do you really need a 64 bit processor? 32-bit would be suffice.

Thanks Mr. Srinivasan for the clarification.
Let me give you a simple example - printing on small format printers
or on continuous sheet printing - managing the width and height is
very difficult from a web application.
I was wondering if there is a java based solution that can process the
html in the page and send to the printer directly without depending on
the browser print functionality. Another aspect I missed in the
previous mail is the ease of use. In a VB application you just click
on print and whoosh it prints. But from a browser you click on print
then the print pops up - you set page size, select pages, remove
header footer and finally you print. Even the pdf method has the same
disadvantage in that you click print, pdf opens in popup then you
click on print and then in the print dialog you click on print to
print the page.

I think Anant mistook me for a VB developer/fan. I used to work for a
company developing using M$ technologies. Now I run my own company and
we have linux as the development environment and PHP and MySQL as the
technologies. But the point is - to create a space in the VB+Access
market it is very tough. I can fight if I have the right weapons.
Printing seems to be a chink in the armor right now.

It doesnt make sense for a government organization to pay M$ 6000 Rs
each for each system just because they want to use VB+Access
applications. The sad thing is the companies dont normally look at
such aspects when then sell their VB application. Who cares if govt
has to send Billions to M$ as licensing fees.

Yes there is an alternative approach using wxWidgets but the cost of
development is much higher given the lack of skilled workforce and the
premiums I will have to pay to get them. PHP+MySQL seems do-able with
the workforce available in the market.

Another reason why I would like to push the web based approach is that
- possibly that would be the most scalable approach for applications
that need to be accessed from across the country. Also it would
possibly be the cheapest for the government.

I am sure somebody must have thought of and implemented a solution to
the above problem.

Cheers

Well, I think I answered that in reply to your other mail. You cannot 
take one point in her philosophy and say that it reflects her entire 
idology.  Yes, personal freedom is great, and whatever comes out of that 
is to be respected. But you are forgetting that her macro-economic 
policies are strictly pro-capitalist, largely conservative, and what 
people would consider "right" leaning politically. I cannot imagine 
Debian's philosophy being anywhere near hers.

I have a doubt - did you read her "Atlas Shrugged" ?  Sigh - I have to 
mark it OT now :)

Ah - bear with me, a few more clarifications.

If you're talking about economic/monopolistic coercion, then she would 
ask you to leave it market forces to do that job for you :)

I am dumb-founded - if you think FSF is practicing what AR preached, 
there has to be a big misunderstanding somewhere. With all due respect, 
I suggest you read more of her works to really understand what she's all 
about :).

If you don't mind using freeware (as in no source-code available but is
free of cost) you can use kqemu [1] for acceleration.

Sure -- dont share if you dont want to -- i dont see google sharing any of

in money-- but in value-- since you are so interested in AR let me put it in

Ok, let me put it this way - what I'm trying to say is writing code for 
fun as a "selfish expression" has nothing to do with free software. Yes, 
it's just a fact that some of the code written for fun will end up being 
foss, but it's not mandatory. What we mean by "free software" here is 
software written for fun (probably not so true anymore) being 
distributed in a certain way (i.e, under different licences like GPL, 
BSD, etc). What's a distribution mechanism got to do with whether the 
software was written for fun or not?

But, the actual point I wanted to make was not whether this particular 
point is in line with AR's philosophy or not (actually, I agreed with 
you) - the point is that if you look at her philosophy holistically, 
it's goes exactly opposite to what Debian & FSF's stated goals are 
(which is why I presume Manoj wouldn't want to promote her ideas :).

I'd rate P4 < AMD < C2D.

If you're using an older distro beware of 865 chipset mobos, have heard
of them giving users a tough time. But, have heard of newer distros work
fine, specifically Ubuntu 7.04 and sabayon 3.3. Not sure of others.

7600 GS or GT?


I know for gaming Amd is good


C2D is better.


but it's overall power is less than pentium.
> AMD 64 3200+ is 2.8 Ghz where P4 has 3 Ghz speed


Clockspeed isn't the only factor. C2D with 1.86Ghz can leave a 3.8 Ghz P4EE
way behind.


moreover AMD's cache is
> 512kb(L1 & L2) & Pentiums cache is  2 MB.


If you can afford, C2D e6320 is best bang for buck processor IMO.
It runs at 1.86Ghz and has 4mb L2 cache and virtualisation support. And
costs
just a couple of hundred more than e6300. Not sure of it's availability
though.


Also see tht gforce is better than

I'd opt for nvidia over ATI presently. But, if you're averse to proprietory
drivers
then go for Intel onboard graphics.

Virtual Box is amazing - much faster than the main proprietary
virtualization technologies.

While the source code version is open source, the binary they provide
does come with a few restrictions. You might want to check though.

I have installed VirtualBox in Feisty using Automatix and its performance is
good. I got sound working in virtual machine using VirtualBox (for some
reason, i didn't get sound in vmware)

Its worth trying VirtuaBox

I guess, apart from OS, there aren't a lot of apps for
64-bit processors. It would also save a litte on the

Although Anant has given the answer, still - Why do you want to enable
root account ? What you need to do with root permission that can not
be done with sudo ? If it is for something which can be done with
sudo, then please do not use the 'root' user. We have been surviving
for more than 2 years without ever enabling root.

I think its the User's Choice to use it in the way he wants and if the User
is sure about the ways to protect himself running as root, then he too can
survive :)

Again, its all about Choice :) (thats the fun with Linux)

Yeah you save on money but at the cost of performace.
I have heard people compiling Firefox in like 15-20 mins on
C2D e6600 whereas it takes 2.5hrs on my P4 2.0GHz, even
a 3.0GHz should take around 1.5hrs atleast.

If it were me, I'd anyday opt for C2D then Preshott or even
Pentium D which runs quite hot and slower than C2D.
And AMD again offers 64-bit in athlon's

I personally would go for 64-bit now unless you need a machine
for wordprocessing and such tasks.

This is not a fair comparison as you are comparing two different 
architectures. C2D and Core Duo are very efficient when compared to P4 
machines.

Friends.

I have a a separate partition for my backups as "/backup".

the details are
device = /dev/hda6
mountpint = /backup
size = 20GB

But, now the backup partition is filled almost 95%.
I need more space for backup.
So, I added an extra hard disk for backup.

Now, the extra harddisk is 
device = /dev/hdc1
size= 80GB
mountpoint = ?

How to extend the /backup with the new disk?

I want /backup should be 20GB+80GB=100GB.

Is there any way to extend the /backup?

A simple way would be to create a new directory under /backups and mount 
the new hard disk under it.

For Music fans using Linux:

Till date the Indian Music sites including Raaga.com, MusicIndiaOnline
etc, did not work on Linux/Firefox combination. There was a
Segmentation fault in Helix/Realplayers.

This has now been fixed and works fine. But the same is not available
in the final release of Helix/Real player. For you to listen to
Raaga.com, please download and install the latest nightly builds from
helixcommunity.org. Please remember to create Symbolic links in the
Firefox plugins folder to get the player working.

Message-ID: <51395.61.247.255.57.1180164305.squirrel@www.songbirdtech.com>

I think one of the primary problems with Linux developers/proponents is
they don't seem to understand that market share is IMPORTANT. Actually it
is critical.

There is the common misconception that we can adopt an elitist approach
towards ordinary users and not have that turn around and bite us.

Some examples of this elitist, exclusiveness:

Towards users:
--------------
a) We will target only geeks ... we are scratching our own itch and we
don't care that the software doesn't work they way you want it to.

b) If you need any help setting up anything, just ask the "community" or
RTFM or go to this discussion thread or that IRC.

c) If you need that functionality, just do it yourself.


Towards H/W Manufacturers:
--------------------------
a) If you don't release the specs, we won't write a driver.

b) We will boycott your hardware etc.


I will explain why all these statements and attitudes while fair are
really hurting Linux.

First a reply:

The so-called "arm chair intellectuals" that you are referring to are
regular users who may not have programming skills, but may have skills in
other areas.

NOTE 1: Their lack of programming skills does not in any sense make them
or their viewpoint inferior to that of a programmer.

These regular users may want to see the same features they are used to
having on Windows because, after all, some friend of theirs convinced them
to use Linux instead of Windows as Linux is better (and also free) and has
equivalent software.

Having said that I do understand your point of view - you are saying that
a person who does not contribute code towards an open source effort really
doesn't have too much of a voice as the developers are not in any sense
obligated to listen to "just" a ordinary user who is not actively
contributing towards the project.

I get that as well.

Now the other side of the coin is this - as long as ordinary users don't
throng towards Linux - that is, unless the number of Linux becomes pretty
large (in comparison to MS Windows usage), it is unlikely that Linux
developers/users will have quite the same say as MS / MS Windows
users/developers.

According to the February 2005 edition of Wired, the distribution of users
across OS's was something like this:

Under "Desktop OS":
- Windows: 95%
- Linux: 3%
- Others: 2%

Now, in the past couple of years the number of Linux users may have
increased. Assuming the number of Linux users has now reached 5% (highly
unlikely as that estimate means that the number of Linux users have gone
up by around 80%), Linux users would still feature very low in the radar
for hardware manufacturers.

NOTE 2: It is natural that hardware manufactures want to target the
largest pie in the market (MS Windows) and not Linux.

As much as it is the Linux developer's prerogative to target only geeks,
it is the hardware manufacturers prerogative to target only the biggest
pie in the market - the Windows users. They have the freedom do do that.

NOTE 3: If you want Linux to be taken seriously, we must target the
end-user and build up market share to the point where we can be taken
seriously. There is no way around it.

NOTE 4: If we want to remain a niche group (consisting only of geeks),
that is fine - we have the freedom to do that. But then we cannot decide
that we want the privileges of a mass-market player. We must be willing to
live with the problems of being a niche market player without whining
about the lack of support from hardware manufacturers, software companies,
governments etc.


NOTE 5: On the topic of boycotting hardware manufactures - when the
hardware company decided not to release linux drivers (or even specs) for
their hardware, it was a clear statement from them that they are not
interested in linux users. That is, Linux users are not invited into the
party they are throwing.

Boycotting such a hardware manufacturer is like sending an angry "No, I am
not coming to your party" mail to someone when they haven't invited you to
the party in the first place.

Thoughts?

PK

IMHO, the best bang-for-the-buck presently is the Allandale Core 2 Duo
E4300 at 1.80GHz/800FSB/2MB L2 cache, at ~Rs.5k for the CPU. It
overclocks easily to 3.4 GHz, at which speed it leaves pretty much
everything, including Quad-Core Core 2 Extremes, biting the dust.
The Allandale overclocking is actually limited by the Northbridge
power dissipation - they get too hot when the FSB is ramped up.

  Every few years, there is an exceptional value CPU that emerges from
Intel that blows away everything else in price/performance - past examples
include the Mendocino Celeron 300A, Coppermine Celeron 533A, Tualatin
Celeron 1200, Northwood Mobile Celeron 2400, etc. The present example
is the Allandale 1.80. It's probably roughly equivalent to a P4 at 10 to 15
GHz, which of course will never show up, since the P4 was phased out
in February. Old Stocks of P4 CPUs will continue to be available at
retailers
for several months, though.

-Siva

P.S. There's utterly no point in buying any P4 now, unless you're upgrading
a legacy system. P4s run too hot, and their performance is way too low
on GNU/Linux integer/pointer-chasing code, compared to the alternatives.

Just to update,

Suddenly it stopped working with Firefox and I followed enabling rtsp
protocol handling in firefox from
here<http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty#How_to_handle_rtsp_.28realmedia.29_protocol_in_Mozilla_Firefox>and
it worked again.

May be. But isn't it that we are underutilizing the
power of the processor? (alteast when 64-bit apps are
in development?)

:-o Compiling takes hours on P4's ? (I haven't ever
compiled anything, so don't really know). That would
also depend on the size of the software, if I'm not
wrong.

This probably answer's the OP's question better. He
has to define his *daily* tasks or tasks that he's
going to carry out on his computer. The programs that
he's going to use etc.

Yeah true I am comparing two different achitectures. But, they are two
alternatives for buyers to choose from and the newer one is doing better.
That's my point, if C2D is doing better then why go for P4 now? If you can't
afford C2D still AMD Athlons are better and not so expensive.
And then the heating problem with Prescott core is an issue, but not so in
C2D.

RIght, I should change my opinion here. It's E4300 that's best bang for
buck. Only thing lacking is virtualisation support in 4x00 series. :(

FIrefox is a big software and supposed to take time. Softwares
like qt and gcc can take even higher, upto 6 hrs, in my case.
I am just trying to say that the power of C2D's is way too ahead
from any P4's. And I believe compiling is a good test but maybe
not the best way to test.

Yes. We have to make trial and error method and the output differs from 
printer to printer.

briefly:

Full-virt basically means that your machine supports Virtualisation on
the h/w level and Xen can make use of that to run the guest os, natively
- with no patching / customising required. eg. being able to run Windows
under a Xen hosted environment - or in this case Solaris under a linux
hosted Xen environ.

This is different from para-virt, where the guest os needs to have xen
para-virt support built into itself to run as a guest.

lots of docs out there that explain this stuff...

Why not try VMWare
VMWare-server is free of cost. But does not have source code given.
I have been using it and it is quite good compared to all the other
virutualization sofware.

Do you care? and what you have done to fix the problem? Like blaming
all the developers for their attitude? In the Free Software community
the transition from developers to end users is gradual and the biggest
problem as I see is the attitude of people not ready to play the role
of the middle men - or people one level above end users and below the
developers, especially the students. You can write documentation,
reply to mails, take classes to schools and college students how to
use Free Software....

You are more than welcome to have a better helpline. Can you give your
mobile number so that people can call you when they are in trouble?
That is tough thing eh? It is easier to put the blame on the arrogant
community, right?

Can you report the functionalities you need to the developers? forget
about the end users for a moment and do what you can, play the role
one step above the end users, we need that kind of people in the
community.

Do you speak any of the Indian languages? I presume you know Tamil.
Can you help in translating some of the Free Software in Tamil? You
can contact me and I will give you a chance to help the community
without needing any programming skills.  Or can you help in reviewing
debian package configuration questions? Most of the debian developers
are from non-english speaking countries, so you could help them make
it in good english.

I do a lot of Malayalam translations and I don't consider my work any
inferior to coding and so does many in the community. Would you take
up this challenge?

It does not have to be code. You could participate in the lists, test
new versions, request new features ... but don't try to tell me you
are just an end user when you are clearly a level above them.

It is great to see WE here rather than a YOU :-) This is a step in the

We can surely go to the party in which we are invited like Intel

I am not sure if the following will help you, but give it a try.

What we used to do when we have to print a form through the browser,
is as follows.
1. Use different CSS for print and for screen using MEDIA:PRINT and
MEDIA:SCREEN tags in the Style sheet. This way, we can print what is
not displayed on screen and show what is not printed. We can also
force a page break or a repeat header (repeat one part of the screen
in every page) using the stylesheets.

2. Proivide the user with a button which does a document.print (in
JS). The user can optionally print from file->print.

Cheers,
Natarajan

I didn't even remember who it was while I was replying. I don't have
anything personal. The thing is when I see the same kind of messages
over and over again I tend to react. Everyone wants to be the end user
but we need people in the community who can be a step above the end
users and when people like students refuse it and just blame the
developers I can't sit idle. I just wanted to give him a chance to
look for things he could change, contribute (believe me this kind of
mails had good results at least in two cases recently - one of them
complained malayalam localisation is slow, I asked him to help and he
started reviewing our translations and helping one member with
language specific help)

   I suppose you are entitled to your opinion.  Fortunately, you can't
 force it on other people.  As  I said earlier, if feel like catering to
 end users and increasing market share is an itch you need to scratch,
 feel free.

    But you can't expect other people  to work according to your belief
 sets.

> I will explain why all these statements and attitudes while fair are
> really hurting Linux.

       The people who do the work get to shape Linux in the form they
  see fit. If you do not like the shape it is taking, get in there and
  do the work. Hectoring developers gets you nowhere.  Neither does
  expecting to order them around.

    That is nice.  Why should I care?

      When it comes to code I write, and priorities I allocate, their

 second to mine)

    Yup.  Money talks.  But since I am already developing software on
 Linux, and since hardware support is already eons ahead of what it was
 when I started using Linux back in '93, my itch is scratched, and I am
 content.

> NOTE 3: If you want Linux to be taken seriously

   Linux is taken seriously enough for me already.  IBM has billion
 dollar budget for linux, Dell is selling Linux boxes.

   The bottom line is that the current state of Linux more or less
 scratches my itch The fact that you guys are complaining that the
 developers don't g"get it" indicates your vision differs from that of
 the developers.  In order to realize your vision, you to do the work.
 Visions don't come cheap.

it is not a good idea to reply without checking to whom you are  
replying - unless the reply is purely technical, which is not the  
case here. As far as I can see, prem is not fully convinced about  
foss - so he has to be convinced, not flamed for not contributing to  
something in which he is not fully convinced about.

Subject: [Ilugc] trouble installing ubuntu 7.04 on parallels workstation
Message-ID: <975977.41578.qm@web36805.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I am having trouble installing Ubuntu 7.04 (Guest OS) thru Parallels Workstation on my Windows XP (Host OS).

I have a Compaq Presario Model - V3149 AU
AMD Turion
1 GB RAM
100 GB HDD

I installed Parallels. Created a new VM with config as 512MB RAM, 5120 MB Harddisk. 
When I try to boot using
the Ubuntu CD, i get the error
[    0.00000] ACPI : Unable to locate RSDP

Also tell me, is it true that Parallels Workstation works only with CDs and not DVDs.
I think it did not boot from my new Solaris 10 DVD.

I have Fiesty Fawn running on VMWare server.
Host OS: Win XP.

Although I've not installed the complete version, I could boot the DVD
and run it as live CD(DVD).

Created a Virtual Machine, and asked it to use the downloaded DVD
(.iso image) as the CD and it just booted out of it like a charm. Yet
to install it on the VM hdd and try.

There is no special step involved in getting it working. Just have
enough RAM for the VM (I had 512MB configured for the guest OS).

It's not about the cost. Even Microsoft Virtual Server is free and
they have added some pretty impressive support for running Linux Guest
OSs in their latest release.But we are not discussing that here, are
we ? I assume on this list, we are confining ourselves to discussions
of open source virtualization solutions. :-)

Not true. I use vmware, virtual server almost daily and then I tried
virtual box recently - I would say it's at least as good as vmware
server speedwise.Most probably it's faster. As already pointed out the
binary version of virtualbox has a rather dubious license. As far
vmware's performance goes anyone buying vmware till recently was
prohibited from publishing any performance benchmarks. So claiming
X-technology is worse than vmware is a bit of stretch.

Googling suggested turning off the Power Management settings in BIOS.
Or try passing acpi=off kernel parameter.

Parallels Workstation's VM Hardware spec says
<Quote>
Up to four IDE devices, that may be either virtual hard drives (from
20 Mb up to 128 Gb each, mapped to image file), or CD/DVD-ROM drives
(mapped to physical drive or to image file), or both hard drives and
CD/DVD-ROM drives;
</Quote>
So I think it should theoretically boot out of your DVD.

Did you check whether your DVD is proper? Did you try booting your PC
with the DVD before trying with Parallels?

But how do you know where to insert the insert-page-break css? you
dont know how big the content is when you print it right? suppose you
insert a page-break-after every 10 rows in a table and you have a huge
9th row. What will happen is there will be a pagebreak after 9th row
because of the size and after the 10th because of the css.
Additionally i have seen problems with the vertical alignment of
content when there is too little content on a page when the orphan is
a TR of a long table

If you any good link for setting up solaris as guest OS in XEN, can you plz share with me. I tried searching, but was not able to get the required document.

This is different from para-virt, where the guest os needs to have xen
para-virt support built into itself to run as a guest.

lots of docs out there that explain this stuff...

if you make sure all your pages are dynamically generated, then you  
can easily do this programatically from the server side

Hmm..

> Do you really need a 64 bit processor? 32-bit would be suffice.

Interesting what marketting can do. All current Intel processors
including the Celeron D, Pentium 4, Pentium D and C2D *are* 64 bit
processors. It is just that AMD calls its processors 64 bit
explicitly. AMD's technology is called AMD64, while Intel calls it
Intel 64 bit Architecture (earlier called EMT64). These CPUs are fully
32-bit compatible. So, finding a 32 bit processor in the market is
actually more difficult, you may actually buy something that is 64 bit
accidentally!

Use this URL to see what features your CPU supports:
http://compare.intel.com

If you got a recent P4, just pop in a 64 bit distro live/install CD
and it should just work. Just that you didn't know it was 64 bit.

I am not too sure about that. If i have a simple sentence of 200
characters including white spaces how will i be able to know how many
physical lines it is going to take on the printed page.

i do these things programatically by generating pdfs through  
reportlab. That way the enduser has total control over the printing  
process.

If increasing market share is not quite the itch you feel, then I guess
you can appreciate when hardware makers don't feel the itch to support
Linux (for its lack of market share).

So you cannot hold onto the view that hardware manufacturers who don't
support Linux must be boycotted right? I am not even getting to the part
where this (boycotting) isn't enforcing your opinion on hardware
manufacturers or not.

My point is simply this:

You cannot decide to remain a niche player while simultaneously expecting
hardware manufactures to cater to you as if you are a mass market player.

I haven't received any response from you on this except the same tired
arguments which I have already addressed.

If you are looking only at normal page breaks and repeated headers, it
is possible using the page-breaking CSS
(http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/page.html). It has been over a year
since I did this piece of code, and since I have switched places, I
don't have access to that code any more. I remember getting pieces of
info from google and it took me a week before I was able to square on
to the actuals. The output was pretty good.

When I tried using Jasper reports, through Java, They had mentioned
about back references. They advice to reduce the usage of "page 1 of
20" formats because, before they completly generate the PDF, they
first "print" all the pages and then go ahead and fill in all the
backreferences to the page numbers. This way, it is very slow and
sometimes very memory hungry. I don't think it is going to be simple
for a HTML report. ( I din say it is impossible, but am short of ideas
at this moment).

Sorry to put it so bluntly - but this is total nonsense. Where did pointers come in? 

Structure assignment is very much a part of the C standard at least since c99. In the "Constraints" part of the section titled "Simple Assignment" (Section 6.5.16.1) , we are told it is valid to have "the left operand has a qualified or unqualified version of a structure or union type compatible with the type of the right". The sematics of the copy is as you would expect it - a field to field copy; padding bits if any need not be copied.

Hi Sujith,

I am curious to know why you are bothered that gcc generates a
memcpy... It can, of course, be a matter of academic interest. However
I do not understad what code you had to change, and why?

A structure assignment is .. a structure copy. It has well defined
syntax and semantics defined by the C standard. I think I am missing
something here. ?

To circumvent different calling conventions.
The caller and the callee have to agree on how they are going to pass
parameters between them.
The 'memcpy' definition can be part of a library that may have been
compiled with a different calling convention.

My code change was pretty simple, replace structure copies with calls to
a wrapper function over memcpy - but, with my preferred calling
convention enforced.

C standards as most others only define the functionality, not the
implementation details. GCC and most other modern compilers implement
copy-on-write optimization since a lot of times, the values are copied to be
read, not changed.  And if you have to ask the question where the pointers
come in, I am left wondering if you are being illogical or sarcastic.

Please take a look at what copy-on-write(COW) means..
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_on_write

I do know for a fact that G++ strings are COW optimized and it is my guess
that structs are also optimized using COW.  I do not see how COW
optimization will break the standard since the compatibility checking will
be at compile time, while COW is at runtime.

A field by field copy is called a shallow copy. If one of the field values
is a pointer, the pointer will be copied as it is.  It is not always as you
expect it. I have been tripped enough times by not having a explicit copy
constructor in C++.

Regards,
Vaidhy

PS: If you think COW optimizations are not done in gcc for struct copy, it
is very easy to say so...

   Not all Netburst CPUs (Celeron D, Pentium 4 and Pentium D) are
64-bit enabled. Williamettes/Northwoods/Prescotts are 32-bit only,
while Smithfields and Cedar Mills are 32/64-bit. The general rule
is that all S478 P4s are 32-bit, while some LGA775 P4s are 64-bit
capable.

Use this URL to see what features your CPU supports:

  The EM64T-enabled P4s will support x86-64 distros, but they
run inefficiently wrt to power consumption compared to a Core
2 Duo. Most dual-core P4s consume over 100W, while most
Allandales consume a maximum of 65W, and some idle as
low as 12W, depending on the ACPI C-state.

http://www.theinq.com/default.aspx?article=36446

This is for the 65nm C2Ds, BTW. The 45nm Penryn C2Ds due
in about 6 months improve on this figure of merit by a further
30-40%.

  As a rough thumb rule, if you're running 24/7/365, 1W of power
consumption costs about $1 yearly, including airconditioning
costs, etc. Dropping from 130W of the Pentium D to 65W of
the Allandale is a pretty big deal - it's about Rs.2.5k per node
per year in cost-cutting (consider the savings for Google with
~450,000 nodes in the Googleplex presently). The savings are
more with ACPI enabled and configured correctly.

Any i965 or i975-based board should be fine. If you want to reuse DDR
RAM from an older board, any Via P4M890, P4M900, PT880 or PT890-
based motherboard should be fine.

  I'm partial to MSI, PowerColor, Foxconn and Intel-branded boards,
but there are a wide variety of reasonably good choices available in prices
ranging from Rs.2.5k to >Rs.15k. Just make sure that it supports your
choice of CPU, and combination of expansion slots (AGP/PCIe/PCI)
and you're good to go.

Thanks. I  went too far with this. Sorry about that. (I keep seeing
this kind of mails all the time so sometimes it becomes too agressive,
will try to be calmer).

My point was you could help clear up some of the points which you
brought up rather than pointing fingers at others and expect others to
do what you felt the most important thing (like sharing more market
share). My point is if you feel that is the most important thing you
feel start doing something about it with the help of others who share
the same ideas rather than expecting others to do it (even when they
might not see it as the priority thing).

I am using macbook to run linux, I use parallels to boot to the same 
linux partition that I use for dual boot.  Running fedora and osx 
simultaneous is a nice experience.

hi,

I was searching for method for printing in pdf in kubuntu 7.04 . I
came across a very simple method. In any website,  or document
(openoffice or anyother program)  select print to file & add extension
pdf. The file is saved as pdf file. I think this works in kde only. No
need to install any printer.

Or, in any print dialog, select print to file and get a .ps (postscript)
file.  Convert that to pdf using ps2pdf.

I think the print to file option saves the file in postscript format.
Not sure about KDE apps but it is the case in Gnome.
You can convert the PS file to pdf using ps2pdf.

Eventhough its extension is pdf, it is actually a ps file. (postscript).
To print in pdf, follow the steps,

Mostly, I face the problem in firefox in kubuntu.
I can not print to pdf directly from firefox.
Here is a tip to print to pdf in firefox itself.

File->print.
select "postscript/default" as printer.
select properties.
in "print command" give "kprinter"

now, give print.
It will ask you to print to pdf file.
give the pdf file name and again give print.

your pdf file is ready now.

Are you able to play it as root ?  Make sure your sound card is not used 
by any other program.
fuser might help, i am not sure.

you need to add web repositories to yast to install packages over the 
internet. here are some pointers,
1. go to  Yast -> Software -> Installation sources
2. you'll find an option to add repositories.
here are the links where you could find some
http://en.opensuse.org/Package_Repositories
http://en.opensuse.org/Package_Repositories
3. enable web repositories and disable the local ones if you just want
to use the web based repositories only

hope this helps,

I had problems with the default players while playing avi and dat
files. I think the problem is that DIVX decoders are not packaged with
ubuntu. If you install vlc media player from synaptic - it should
start working. installing vlc will install all additional required
libraries.

non-free codecs and commercial softwares are not intalled on ubuntu by
default.

i would suggest you  install "automatix" using synaptic/apt-get

you can run automatix and choose all the packages, codecs and plugins
that you need.
this should solve the issues you are having.

I think all codecs required for playing all media types are in the 
official repositories. Automatix is not needed and I think it will screw 
up distro updates with all the non standard repositories it adds.

        You do note that the GNU projects kernel is still barely self
 hosting; and the applications they managed to create never did reach
 critical mass.

        It took the scratch-the-itch folks to bring free software to
 where it is today.

        You mean the motivation of the first few people who worked on
 the concept.  On the other hand, the people who scratch their itches
 are not the same as the people who came on earlier. And while I
 contributed work to X10/Emacs/Lucid Emacs way before there was was a
 Linux, I must confess I was still scratching my itch, even back then.

        Lacking a crystal ball, I rarely make strong assertions about
 other people state of mind, motivations, or state of knowledge. I feel
 somewhat envious of your clarity into other peoples past
 motivations. Can we bowwor your crystal ball sometime?

        I kinda doubt that is the case with the majority of the
 bystanders.

        I think the world, and creating software, has changed a bit
 since IBM in the 60's.

        Why should I, or any other software developer, care about what
 you think my view should be?

        I have alway encouraged people to run with the marketing idea,
 if that floats their boat.  Whining about other people not running and
 performing according to their expectations is what I have been stating
 is something that does no one any good.

        If you think that someone on the publish or perish track has
 copious free time, you have not been in academe in a competitive
 university for long.

        It is the goal of the original developers.  The current crop has
 different motivators.  Just like you do not want to run your life based
 on my motivators, I have no desire to run mine based on other people's
 goals.

 trend in hardware support I am seeing; and see no reason to do things
 that I don't find fun, or to sacrifice on the altar of the god of
 marketing.

        I do not buy hardware I can't use.  I do not resume to tell
 other people what to do. If the hadware vendor wants my custom, and the
 custom of the companies whose buying decisions I influence; they''l
 provide Linux support.  Those that do not lose my patronage.

        Such is how the free market works.

        I am not trying to coerce anyone else to do anything they do not
 want.  I am happy with my current level of hardware support --heck, I
 was happy with it 10 years ago.

> I haven't received any response from you on this except the same tired

        And you with the same whining as usual.

        If you want marketing to be done, get off your butt and do
 something about it. Stop haranguing other people who have no interest
 in doing so.

If you are trying to play VCD then you need to use the following 

mplayer vcd://<trackno>
mplayer -vcd <trackno>

try track number 1

Message-ID: <436759.48383.qm@web8909.mail.in.yahoo.com>

hi,
i am using rhel4.
it had openoffice-1.1
i downloaded openoffice.org-2.2 and tried to update my openoffice as 
# rpm -Uvh openoffice.org-*
in the directory where i had openoffice.org-2.2 RPMS.
but i could use only ooffice1.1
then i removed ooffice as,
#rpm -e openoffice.org

now when am trying to install ooffice2.2 i am unable to install it as it says that the packages have been installed already. 

i cant find the binary ooffice too in my system. How to make my ooffice2.2 to work??

You can find your openoffice installation on

/opt/openoffice.org2.2/

directory.

configure gnome or kde to use openoffice to open the files with 
appropriate extension.

for eg.

use scalc  program in /opt/openoffice.org2.2/program/ directory  to open 
files with .xls extension

Thanks & Regards,
