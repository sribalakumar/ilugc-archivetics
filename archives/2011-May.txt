IMO, certification is an endorsement of the subject matter that you
claim to know.

Therefore, first you should acquire knowledge in the subject matter,
do some work in that area and then go for certification.

What is necessary is to show that you have done a couple of projects
using the technology (JBOSS in this instance).  To do cert. or not is
a matter of choice.

Cert. or no cert. a competent interviewer will know your depth of
knowledge within 5 mins. into the interview.

Please see the list archives on for discussion on certification.

My two cents.

did you try switching to any of the terminals(ALT+ F1, is it just X is
hanging ?) ? Are you sure that there are no hardware issues(did the
syslog give you any traces) ?

What kind of help do you guys need?

Have you installed it and read the documentation that is available @
Moodle's web site?

Under Moodle>Support  there are 4 resources where you can get help:

1. Documents
2. Forums
3. Books and Manuals
4. Commercial Services

Which of the above have you tried?  What is it that you are seeking
that is not available in the above categories?

Hi guys,

I followed the link http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SoftwareRAIDonCentOS5 and
configured RAID 1 with my Seagate 500 GB X 2 Hard disks everything is fine.

I also tested it by disconnecting one hard disk at a time and it boots from
the next hard disk and vice versa. When both the hard disks are connected I
booted my system from HDD 1. and saved a file in my home and desktop.

But when I disconnected my HDD 1 and booted my system from HDD 2. But the
file which i have saved was not in my home folder.

When I disconnected my HDD 2 and booted my system from HDD1. The file was
there in my home.

This shows me that the actual purpose of RAID1 (Mirroring) was not happened
there. Please guide me.

You can write regular expressions in perl/python scripts to match IP addresses.

One valid reason that i've practically experienced is the Graphics Drivers.
If you have ATI/Nvidia card, try installing Proprietory Drivers. If you just
have an Intel Graphics card instead, then you might have tough time clearing
this issue.

Forwarded Message from Arun Prasath <cena2525 at gmail.com>:

Hi,

I had upgraded my system to ubuntu 11.04. After upgrading I installed a
plug-in named "compizconfig-settings-
manager(0.9.4-0ubuntu2)" from the
software center for visual effects. After adding the plug-in, I changed the
visual effects options by clicking the checkbox of Cube desktop in it. It
showed some warnings such that "disable GNU..... " I randomly clicked those
warnings and gave apply changes to the visual effects settings that I have
made. At once my Ubuntu 11.04 sidebar in the desktop got disappeared. I
thought it is due to the settings that I have made for visual effects and so
I removed that plug-in from my software center. But, still I didn't get back
my Ubuntu 11.04 desktop sidebar. Please provide me solution to get back that
desktop side bar.

Thanks in advance...

Great.  Now read up on "mdadm" because you never know when you may
need it.  CentOS in rescue mode gives you only CLI and in that
environment 'mdadm' is your only friend.

Hmmm.

Send the output of "fdisk -l"

You have not mentioned any time frame when you attempted the break
testing.  Even though you may be able to use a software RAID device
immediately after it's creation, building the mirror images takes
time.  On a 250 GB device on my desktop, I have seen it take about 40
mins.  On a 500GB it might take longer.

See mirror progress in file "watch -n 10 cat /proc/mdstat"

When we connect the usb device it will reside as /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc etc.,
We can find that using fdisk -l

Is there any command to list all the usb devices location, like below

$<command>

/dev/sdb

        I guess you can do a "dmesg | tail" to find the info that you
need. It normally tells you where the device is. Thanks

The simplest way is to check for the device instances with dmesg

$dmesg | grep sd

Yes, but the built-in hard disks normally come first in the order of
assigning device names, AFAIK (Please correct me if I'm wrong). So if you
have 'n' built-in hard disks you can just ignore first 'n' rows of the
result to get the list of usb devices.

What if he OP is trying to write script that does something with USB disks?
If it's his own system he can ignore n number of disks he has. But for
generic script it won't do. dmesg is the best bet.

Be careful with the verbiage "usb device."  Only block devices will
show up as /dev/sd*.   An USB>RJ45 device will show up as a network
device ethX,  an USB>Serial adapter will show up as /dev/ttyUSBX etc.
X = [0-9].

For USB specific block devices, see what the output of 'lsusb' looks
like and then write your script to parse that output for all 'block
devices' on USB ports.

/sys/block contains data about block devices. A file named 'removable' contains 1 if it is removable devices. You can build upon this basic find and grep.

find . -name '*remov*' -exec grep -l 1 {} \;

This one lists cd drives also. It will show event umounted one. It will be interesting to expand this script, to omit such devices.

Hope you would recall me.

One of my friend and coordinator of ILUG Kochi wants to do a project as part
of his MTech Course in CS.

He is interested to do a serious work that is research oriented. Can anyone
help him in this regard. What about NRCFOSS? Any other organisations who can
guide him..?

He is good in programming in Python as well.

Not all usb devices are block devices(usb datacards, webcams etc.,). 
please be specific that you are dealing with block devices.

Here's one for kernels 2.6.20 onwards:

ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/usb-*

I have no idea if this is foolproof. However, with my USB stick:

# ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/usb-*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 May  4 23:17 /dev/disk/by-id/usb-JetFlash_TS2GJFV30_7JGO3QAD-0:0 -> ../../sdb
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 May  4 23:17 /dev/disk/by-id/usb-JetFlash_TS2GJFV30_7JGO3QAD-0:0-part1 -> ../../sdb1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 May  4 23:17 /dev/disk/by-id/usb-JetFlash_TS2GJFV30_7JGO3QAD-0:0-part2 -> ../../sdb2

Try to use your own names to usb devices using udev rules. Something
like usddisk, usbcamera etc,,
Then do a ls on /dev|grep usb

You can wrap them around functions with clean APIs, and put them in a library.

For now I going to put in a file and using FreeMind to manage the
codes. This helps to easily browse the files and hence the codes.
Since it is in files, I can use as it is in library.

But this way we cannot able to share the codes. And it is not portable
too. (between different computers).

There is another way to see what happens when a device is plugged in.
By using the

"udevadm monitor"

You can lively watch what happens inside the system when a device is
plugged in. Not just usb device.

Which browser?

The new FF, Google Chromium/Chrom use $HOME/.cache directory tree (a
good move IMO).  The streamed files are broken up into some numbered
filenames.

If you're using Firefox, an easier way to do this is to use the UnPlug
or VideoDownloader extensions.

Friends.

I am getting a lot of suggestions and requests to make our list more
users friendly.
Many people have much fear to post emails to our list.
This situation should be changed.

To make our list more users friendly, we need to review our guidelines
and our way of communications.

Shall we have a IRC meeting to discuss about this?

The following are some topics
1. List Guidelines
2. Tone of giving suggestions to the new users

Feel free to add more topics.

When can we have the discussion in IRC?
Suggest some times.

Thanks.

I have experienced this kind of weird stuff from Natty Narwhal. I remember
someone saying in some other thread previously,this is due to few of library
files and kernel files that are not upgraded to the new ones during upgrade
to 11.04 which is not the case in from-scratch installation of 11.04. Though
I am not sure what it is, a weird restart shown me some error which
mentioned some gnome library files are outdated and asked me to replace(not
even upgrade) to avoid the system errors.

Same experience here ... and I think it requires a specific version of
Acrobat reader.   For once a year activity, I use a laptop that came
with Windows pre-installed.

I think they all outsourced the development of their Cert. Authority

11.04 has changes in the UI plus the major switch to Wayland
(replacing X server) -- expect glitches in this release.

A fresh install might be different experience.   I have decided to
give this release a pass.

I don't think Ubuntu 11.04 desktop edition uses Wayland as the default
though I guess it might be there in the repos. My fresh installation
of Ubuntu 11.04 does use Xorg.

Quoting from 11.04 release notes
(https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NattyNarwhal/ReleaseNotes) "X.org 1.10.0 and
Mesa 7.10.2 are the new versions included with 11.04. The X server
includes a prototype of the multitouch input extension (XInput 2.1).
The Qt toolkit also includes pre-release support for multitouch."

I am adding my opinion.

I have been a member here for about 3-4 years now and the atmosphere
is quite gentle.  I have not come across any personal attacks or name
calling.

If there is anything that makes people uncomfortable from posting,
e.g. being reminded to use list guidelines, then I would suggest to
use it is an opportunity to improve your communication skill [1].

In FOSS you are dealing with a very diverse set of individuals.  IMO,
one of the paradigms of working with a FOSS groups is to develop a
thick skin and be able to take criticism for what it is worth, learn
from it (if there is a lesson) and move on.

I see posts from people asking for "step by step" procedures for
things which they can easily search for themselves on the 'Net, I see
posts with complete disregard for mailing list guidelines and some do
it repeatedly,  some OP's fail to follow up with questions/solutions
that have been posted.

In any other environment, be it school/college/work, one would be
reprimanded for their repeated faux pas.   Expecting anything
different from a mailing list is *unreasonable*; especially when the
help people get, is gratis with no expectation of even a thank you or
an acknowledgement once the OP's problem is resolved or the question
answered.

[1] Way back in the late eighties and early nineties, USENET was the
place to ask questions (technical as well as social).  There were
people from all over the world posting questions and giving answers.
The fact that all were not well versed in the common denominator
lingua (English), did not deter them from participating.   Newbies
were welcome;  those who exhibited that they had read the
documentation and were stuck in some place were helped.

My two cents.

I stand corrected, I believe it is in the repos.  A while back there
was an article on Ubuntu shifting to Wayland in 11.04; I assumed that
was the case.

Very few journalists have any clue what they are talking about when it
comes to free software.  lwn.net,  glyn moody,  ryan paul and a couple
of others.  Rest of them,  will hype and mislead just to get more hits
and ad revenue.  Verify the sources. Go to official websites or talk to
the people involved.   Wayland is in the repo for several
distributions.  It is far from ready to be default for any distro yet. 
It will take atleast 6 months to an year more.

During the Kubuntu dist-upgrade earlier settings are preserved.
During major updates of kde, users are prompted about keeping
configuration settings.
There is an option to boot 'earlier versions ' too in grub.

What exactly did you do?

Has anyone tried a fresh install of Natty on a Lucid/Maverick system
without formatting partitions and assigning the same mount points as
before? I've not been brave enough to try that though.

Upgrade takes way too long as compared to fresh install.

Questions is - Do existing apps works (if compatible) or do we have to
reinstall apps? I'm confident user data will stay on the home
partition without an issue.

Hello friends,

Due to the short notice, we have not received enough audience for the
spoken-tutorials.org meet  at chennai and because of the overwhelming
interest at thiruvanamalai, we have shifted the pro-gramme to ARUNAI
Engineering College - Thiruvanamalai, Tamil nadu. The pro-gramme is planned
between 11:00 am and 12:30 pm on May 9 2011 at the college campus. All are
invited.

I agree with the above. IMHO I dont see any need to change the
guidelines rather we need to see how to make people follow the
guidelines in a amicable way.

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 should be able to help you.

edit the file /etc/default/grub as root (preferably use sudo)
change the following entries (or add if not present) to look like this
GRUB_DEFAULT= x

GRUB_TIMEOUT=30

where x is the number indicating the position of windows on your boot menu.

and don't forget to run sudo update-grub after editing it.

There is a bunch of USB models listed.  Also, check if mythtv support the cards.

Dear all,

A two days Free training program on FOSS lab setup and administration was
organised by Anna University, MIT Campus for system admins / lab technical
assistants of engineering colleges.  It was held on 6th and 7th May 2011.
The 2 days session was handled by me.

Around 76 participants from 70 engineering colleges attended this training
program.

The participants were provided with Fedora-14 installation DVD and complete
Fedora-14 packages repository.  All participants were provided with
individual PCs for hands on practice.

The following sessions were handled in the training program.

Introduction to lab exercises based on open source lab syllabus
PXE based remote installation
Package management in Fedora using YUM / YUMEX
Network configuration and IPTables
Samba configuration
CUPS configuration
FUSE (explained about ntfs-3g and sshfs)
Virtualization using Qemu (using FreeDOS)
Kernel compilation / installation
Source code compilation
Few Troubleshooting Techniques

Ms.Catherine Bina, Head of the MIT Computing Centre was the main force
behind this event. On behalf of ILUGC I thank them for the opportunity. I
also thank Anna University for this.

Fantastic work, Baskar.  Are these events invite-only, or only for the
students of specific colleges, or can anyone attend them?  If they are
open, could you announce them before the actual event?

Yesterday, we had a camp on ?Spoken Tutorial? Project at Kanchipuram.

Video Tutorials are the easier way to spread the computer literacy
throughout the world. Skilled Computer Teachers are less in the
countries like India. But the video tutorials can reach any part of
the world, where any student can learn from the videos.

Tons of video tutorials are available in the sites like

MIT Video Courses [ http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/audio-video-courses ]
Khan Academy [ http://khanacademy.org]
PHP Academy [ http://phpacademy.org ]

But as they are available only in English, it is being touch to reach
the rural and village students.

To solve this problem, Ministry of Human Resource, India and IIT
Bombay, jointly started a project called ?Spoken Tutorial?

The idea is to create small videos on various software and languages
in one language and to translate the videos in to all the languages
possible.

The creation of videos, translation and dubbing activities are done by
the students, unemployed people, and home makers. Anyone can
participate in this project and the team rewards the contributors upto
Rs 3,500 for a 10 min video.

Prof. Kannan Moudgalya, The project leader of ?Spoken Tutorial? travel
throughout India, to create awareness about this project and to make
people to participate in the nation wide revolution.

Yesterday, Kanchi Linux Users Group organised a camp for Spoken
Tutorial Project, at Meeting Hall, Sangeetha Hotel,Kanchipuram. Around
45 students participated in the event.

Mr. Thyagarajan explained ?about Spoken Tutorial Project.

Mr. Shrinivasan (its me) about the activities of KanchiLUG.

Miss. Priya explained about her contributions to the Spoken Tutorial Project

Mr. Dhasthageer narrated his project on Fluid Flow Visualization.

We played some videos created by Miss.Priya.

Then, Prof Kannan explained about the project. He demonstrated on how
to create a Video Tutorial.
He explained how this project helps a lot of remote village students
in north east, west parts of India.
He answered for the questions. All the students expressed their
interest in participating this project.
He requests all the students to contribute a little for the national
revolution in education.

These spoken tutorials can be created to teach any Free Open Source Software.

We can extend them on various topics like
Basic computer usage
Using Internet
Online Banking
Online Ticket Reservation
Online Payment systems
Searching
Using Email Systems
etc.

Not Natty but Maverick on an existing Lucid installation without formatting
the partition. I did that when Maverick was released.

There won't be any existing apps after you do the above procedure-I think
only the home folder will be unaffected regardless of which partition it is
on. That is how I remember it was when I did it. You will have to reinstall
all apps

That sounds great sir. Even staff from our college (I.F.E.T. College of
Engg.) also attended and they shared out the experience they had there and
even we installed fedora 14 in our lab systems and was configuring the
fedora repository.
Thank you sir.

Message-ID: <BANLkTikdTnvO95Tq3DHOMvGfNVqvbRJtkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

Recently installed Fedora 14 in a Desktop when i logged in i found that
OpenOffice package was missing. May be i might have missed while customizing
it.

I have Fedora 14 DVD sponsored by LinuXpert Systems (Mr. Baskar Selvaraj)
which consists of Packages directory in it with OpenOffice packages.

I tried installing by double clicking on the rpm package files in the DVD
but there are dependencies.

So i tried to manually configure the repository using an *Vi* editor to the
file    */etc/yum.repos.d/fedora ...*(dont remember the file name excatly)

After changing the baseurl to DVD path when i try to use

*yum groupinstall openoffice.org-**

i get following error message:

" Cannot retrieve MetaData file (repomd.xml) . Check its path and try again.
"

When i opened the " repomd.xml " file it was empty.

Can you please provide me in step-by-step how to configure the Repository of
the Yum installer and to install all the OpenOffice Packages without
Dependencies?

This should be really easy with antiword, abiword or one of the other tools.

But you will not benefit by markup.

Have you tried using Firefox. Please go to the following

* Edit->Preferences->Advanced->Encryption and Try view Certificates.*

*If not *try to add Security Device as New PKCS#11 Module and Load

I don't see the lessons being linked with a project as an exercise. Is
that something you'll be considering during your training ?

For example, at the end of the following section, how do they learn to
apply what they learn on actual stuff ? Kenneth and NRCFOSS had some
ideas around it, I guess this is as good a list as any to ask about
that.

== Code ==
How to compile and Debug C++ programs using, gcc and eclipse. How to use
makefile.
Introduction to jQuery, day 1
Introduction to XML, How to use XML in jQuery, python.
Introduction to jQuery, day 2
Install Drupal and customising , adding themes..
Concepts of MySQL, PHP and how backend of server works. Linux as server.

I think you can include Ruby too in the Code section.

Where this training will happen? Is this training only for Delhi students or
what?

Without that structure--look at Bloom's Taxonomy, for example-- a syllabus
becomes a laundry list.

It is a *bad* practice to top post to mailing lists. Please read the
mailing list guidelines
(http://www.ilugc.in/content/mailinglist-guidelines) and about the
various posting styles. This will help you understand why we recommend
interleaved, trimmed posting style in this list.

          It is ok to use separate threads because, members who want
to discuss something specific to that lab setup may continue using
that thread. In my understanding, that's why we have separate threads.

>From the foreword of Free Software Free Society: Selected Essays of
Richard Stallman (2nd Edition):

This book collects the writing of Richard Stallman in a manner that
will make its subtlety and power clear. The essays span a wide range,
from copyright to the history of the free software movement. They
include many arguments not well known, and among these, an especially
insightful account of the changed circumstances that render copyright
in the digital world suspect. They will serve as a resource for those
who seek to understand the thought of this most powerful man--powerful
in his ideas, his passion, and his integrity, even if powerless in
every other way. They will inspire other who would take these ideas,
and build upon them.

Can you please add "smart questions", problem solving tips. Most students
get "struck" somewhere or other when they use FOSS software and if they
cannot solve the problem, most tend to leave. Some might write to mailing
list, still not get their problem solved because the list cannot answer
because they are not smart questions / they cannot understand and solve the
problem after receiving help from list.A large number of students who get
introduced to FOSS, leave away FOSS / GNU/linux for these reasons. A general
introduction of how FOSS model of development works would also be good.

I would recommend using `gist`[1] if you want to share snippets and if you just 
want to collect them for personal reference, use a local git/svn/whatever VCS 
you prefer. The advantage of putting them in gist or a local VCS is that you get 
all the native search/sort/manage/view tools 'for free'.

Besides snippets, I even put my vimrc and other assorted config files in git for 
this precise reason.

hi,

in python to mark strings for translation one does this:

string: somestring
marked string: _("somestring")

and in django templates:
string: somestring
marked string: {% trans "somestring" %}

can anyone suggest a very quick and easy way of doing this?

       I haven't worked much on translation as such. But if you choose
type it as "somestring" and then use substitute option for
substituting "somestring" with {% trans "somestring" %}, then you can
do either

1) M-x replace-string
           Give the string you want to replace, sometring in this case
and then the string to replace it with, {% trans "somestring" %} in
this case. This would replace All occurrences of somestring with {%
trans "somestring" %}.

2) M-x query-replace
          Same as above, except that it highlights each occurrence one
by one and asks if you need to replace. You can press 'y' or 'n' and
keep going.


      Sorry if you meant something else and the reply is not relevant. Thanks

I meant something else. Marking strings for translation means each
string is different. At present what I do is:
1. mark the string
2. C-W
3. type _("  this will autocomplete to _("") with the cursor between the
quotes
4. C-y

You can take this path AsciiDoc -> Docbook -> FO -> RTF. 

  1. AsciiDoc has a Docbook backend, so that shouldn't be a problem.
  2. Docbook XSL stylesheets[1] can convert Docbook to FO.
  3. Apache FOP[2] can convert FO to RTF.

Add the following code (simple and not so accurate code) to your ~/.emacs file,
and restart emacs. Open up a Python module, move the cursor to a string and
press C-c t.

------
(defun py-mark-trans ()
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (search-backward "\"")
    (insert "_(")
    (search-forward "\"")
    (search-forward "\"")
    (insert ")")))

(defun my-python-hook ()
	(define-key python-mode-map [?\C-c?t] 'py-mark-trans))

(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'my-python-hook)

Message-ID: <BANLkTikPvi+qyXA1t4=ZbXbA+pGBij+BAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I had posted this to the JUG-Chennai list too and thought this might be
interesting discussion in this list too as there are quite a few people with
knowledge of licensing here. Any comments, suggestions or work arounds
please?

Sun/Oracle does not allow you to package the FX runtime along with your
desktop application. Web start will download it from
http://dl.javafx-rt.com/ automatically. I am intending to make a desktop
application with JavaFX and it will be distributed in a CD/DVD to thousands
of subscribers. In todays' broadband era, it is not too difficult nor the
end users are going to complain much. But... What if Oracle decides to pull
the plug on JavaFX and brings down the dl.javafx-rt.com/ site?? I cannot
distribute my applications anymore! This is unacceptable and seems stupid
and selfish by Sun/Oracle. How do they expect developers to use JavaFX with
such restrictions?

My existing JavaFX projects were custom developed for a TV channel and we
gave the entire setup as a service and hence never thought about the
licensing issues. Now that I have to develop a mass distributed product, I
have a gut feeling I invested time and effort in the wrong technology... :(

Arun

I am bit late with the reply, but I guess I have a not so bad solution.
The following script uses HAL to do the trick.

------
for udi in $(hal-find-by-capability --capability storage)
do
    bus=$(hal-get-property --udi $udi --key storage.bus)
    if [ $bus == usb ]; then 
        hal-get-property --udi $udi --key block.device
    fi
done

The following code handles both the quoting styles.

------
(defun py-mark-trans ()
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (re-search-backward "[\"']")
    (insert "_(")
    (re-search-forward "[\"']")

Did you try searching the internet for the same? Please do your
homework before asking questions on the list. OpenLDAP and OpenDS are
open-source directory server implementations whereas Active Directory
is a proprietary directory server, the likes of which we don't usually
discuss here.

FAQs/About section of http://openldap.org and http://opends.org should
provide answers to your question.

I am fond of all these basics. I have not seen an real time implementation
so fond of asking people who have seen an bigger implementation of these.
Just to know the views of people who were really involved in LDAP.

The macro recommended is good; another method would be to simply use a
careful keyboard macro.

For instance, go to the top of the buffer, then:

C-x ( 	      (start recording)
C-s " 	      (search for "\"")
C-b ( 	      (prepend the parenthesis)
C-s " C-s     (search for the closing paren)
C-f ) 	      (closing paren)
C-x )

Then you can basically just keep doing C-x e, or do
C-u 100 C-x e to run the macro, say 100 times.

The advantage of this method is that you don't need to write Emacs
Lisp. The disadvantage is that it is prone to errors and not flexible.

See http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyboardMacros for details.

Most LDAP implementation support the standards.

openLDAP and serves my needs to do basic *nix style + Windows domain
authentication.

You need to define your requirements and then go looking for which
implementation supports them.

FWIW, Mac OS X server uses openLDAP  for it's directory services.

the only problem with this is that it will mark *every* string for
translation. Actually a human is needed to decide which strings to mark.
The method given works like a dream.

Subject: [Ilugc] [commercial] Python/Django training
Message-ID: <1305164743.17425.223.camel@localhost>

hi,

there is a large demand for python/django programmers, and I am getting
constant requests for candidates. I had tried to interest some
institutes in training, but most of them are unprofessional and provide
mere theoretical knowledge. Companies that need django developers have
to spend too much time training their recruits. The recruits lack the
all round skills in development and deployment that are the hall mark of
a modern web programmer.

I have decided to offer training in a live environment which will
produce people who can 'hit the ground running'. The programme will be
flexible, tuned to the individual needs. This means that the course can
run from one month (minimum) up to 3 months. Again depending on the
trainee, it will be both on location and remote. The location is Ooty,
and accommodation will be provided/arranged.

As an introductory offer, the charge will be 25K - and a job is
guaranteed for anyone who passes. 

Prerequisites - some knowledge of programming and web development. More
important, the ability to work hard and the desire to learn new things.

Please contact me off list.

all the best for your efforts. hope you involve the juniors & students from
different branches so that sustainability is ensured.

i wish you could have put "Kalasilingam University" instead of "our
university". of course the reader can go to the link and find out where you
are from, but i would feel it is a good practice to give brief &
comprehensive info in the main message.

it will also spur students from other instituitions who casually look at the
mails to become a bit more active.

         Yes, both emacs and vi/vim are quite powerful. When you
read/write huge amounts of code, they do lot of things in a fast and
efficient manner. But both have steep learning curves. Only repeated
use for all tasks will make you comfortable with these editors.

       Instead of vi, try using vim. It allows arrow keys, Del, Ins etc.

      IIRC, there used to be some tool called vimtutor. You can try
using that to learn vim. Just type "vimtutor" in the shell. If you
don't have that, on Debian, the package should be vim-runtime.

apt-get install vim-runtime

should install vimtutor.

PS: If you want to try emacs, try install emacs(apt-get install
emacs22 or apt-get install emacs23). Once you are into emacs, Type
Ctrl-h t. That will take you to the emacs tutorial. Thanks

Type vimtutor in the terminal, it will start vim in tutorial mode. You need
to have vim installed. Also search for vi /vim cheatsheet on your favorite
search engine.

This is useful for copying partitions. But if you want to clone entire disk
including MBR then you have to do

$ dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb

(note the absence of numbers)

Topic: Programming in GO

Description:

Google's new open source programming language, called Go, took the application
development world by storm when the search giant released it Nov. 10
2009. The Go programming language is an open source project to make
programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and
efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
that get the most out of multicore  and networked machines, while its
novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.
Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage
collection and the power of run-time reflection. It?s a fast,
statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically
typed, interpreted language.

Yes there are plenty of tutorials but it is like learning meditation
or cooking or swimming.

Or cycling or C programming.

It takes a lot of effort on your part.

Ohh sorry for the sad first experience . That was because of the old
vi editor . Please install Vim .
sudo apt-get install vim or #yum install vim would get you the entire vim bundle

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29#Features_and_improvements_over_vi

Vim in Six Kilobytes will explain the features .
http://www.vim.org/6k/features.en.txt

Personally I think it will take some time for anyone to use vi editor
. if you are impatient go for nano or gedit .

Pavithran

By inference, then UNIX system programmers using emacs do not know UNIX :D

Please let us not go down this road.

I started using vi in 1984 and it did take me a while getting
proficient at it.  It was the only curses based text editor on the
system I was working on; the alternative was ed.

IMO, the learning curve applies to any software application.   The OP
can choose to learn vi/vim or continue using the editors that he is
familiar with.   Use the editor that helps you get your job done.

My two cents.

Shocked when seeing this. suppose if a person knows vi or emacs

We use our own FOSS lab server for setting up the lab.  Fedora-14 is being
used for lab setup using customized kickstart file which installs about
6400+ packages from the fedora-14 repository.

As the existing power conditions is a big trouble here, we use 2 FOSS lab
servers to complete the lab setup as quick as possible.  We usually start
the lab setup process by 9.30 am and complete before 2.30 pm (it takes
around 4-5 hours to complete 30-35 computers).

Regarding softwares, almost all packages in the fedora repository is being
installed.  We install software packages for every proprietary equivalent
(will post the kickstart file and inform the list soon).

Can you share your disk image of the server if you are using thin client?
>

We don't use any disk image, as the installation is being done through PXE
based remote installation.

I am also having idea about providing one FOSS lab server for all LUGs in
India to simplify FOSS lab setup in academic institutions.  Requesting
members to share their ideas/toughts on this.

You don't get your private key signed by anybody. It is private and should
 not be shown to anybody.

You generate a keypair and the private key is encrypted with a pass phrase
 or a password.

Now your public key is what is called the certificate. But that
becomes a certificate
 only when it is signed by the CA's private key.

In the case of certificate your public key is appended with a
signature of the MD5
 or SHA1 hash of the certificate data.

Private keys are used only for document signing and for symmetric key
encryption
 when communicating.

Thanks Girish for you nice answer. But, I am still unclear that, "from where
should I generate CSR"? I mean, is it OK if I generate CSR + Private key
from my home machine ( please remember, this CSR will be for my
www.myserver.com). OR, do I need to login there in www.myserver.com and then
need to create CSR+Private key for that server? Which one?

If your intention is only to use SSL certificates to login to your server,
it is not necessary to apply for certificates from CAs. You can generate
your own public - pvt key pair in your own pc and copy the public key to
your server.

See if http://pkeck.myweb.uga.edu/ssh/ helps!

No, actually it's for my client. My client is already a valued customers of
Verisign! :) So, I must have to get certificate from verisign and must have
to implement this in server.

So, here are the steps I am following:

1. Generate private key
2. Generate CSR
3. Apply to Verisign with this CSR
4. Get certificate from them
5. Concate CRT+Private Key
6. Re-encode into PKCS12
7. Create JKS
8. Install JKS

but then again, I am confused about one things: (1) Is it really necessary
to "generate private key" from their server? I mean, ssh into my client's
server, run openssl command like from their server :

openssl genrsa -des3 -out server_self.key 2048

Will it create any problem if I generate private key and csr from my
home machine? And, after that applying for certificate into Verisign
with
that CSR?

No need to generate the keys on the target server.  You can generate
it on your local PC and sign it by Verisign and install the final cert on
the target server.

When you generate your keys, ensure you get the FQDN and other
details absolutely correct.  Also ensure that the ciphers you are using
to generate the keys are supported on your server.

+1

But I suggest rather than providing the FOSS lab server hardware/appliance
it would be better if you could post the server setup code and docs on a public
repo and wiki.  Anyone can setup a FOSS lab server using locally available
hardware, and also contribute code/docs back to you.

A FOSS lab server live CD/USB would also be a nice idea.

Hope you can consider this.

THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW! THANKS A LOT Raja Subramanian!
Thanks a lot Girish and Manokaran for their quick and resourceful answer,
those were bonus knowledge for me. :)

Anyway, my another question is: Do I really need to install JKS there in my
client's server? I mean, I am going to follow these steps one after another:

5. Concatenation CRT and Private key ( this CRT may be Self-Signed or found
from Third Party )

6. RE-ENCODE pem file into PKCS12
7. Create JKS

As I got this documentation, I don't think, that JKS is actually necessary.
What do you say?

I would very very strongly suggest you use Centos as it has a very
long support cycle (7 years)

I do understand kids need latest things to work on them. But theb the
cost of maintenance and support in remote areas can be a bit of an
issue.

I am toying around with the idea of different support consortiums for
such FOSS efforts: BFSI, Manufacturing, Academics (including PHBs)
etc.

I understand it is a bit mindboggling to even think of this
considering the minefield of Licences, patents, fianacial and host of
other issues.

But my focus is a resilient Support system for India specific environment.

Let me just throw an idea: imagine a 42 u rack with dual UPS, food
virtualised commodity storage and servers that can be placed anywhere.
Application can be anything.

Or perhaps I am hallucinating....

above IMHO,

Any thouhgts on this issues?

i am for Fedora for activities like these , its always a step ahead of RHEL
and yes students have an opportunity to contribute actively to the fedora
community rather than closed RHEL platform wrt to community participation ,
experimentation etc.... over and above all of it learnings .

The term you are looking for is remastering. Here's the Arch wiki page for
remastering Arch Linux ISO
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Remastering_the_Install_ISO

And to automatically start applications like Firefox you will need to add it
to the startup script of your chosen DE/WM. e.g. in GNOME you can add it to
System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications. Or in case of fluxbox you can
add it to ~/.fluxbox/startup file.

Try

$ unity --reset

it should clear up the problem. If not then look at other solutions like
reinstalling unity.

Indeed. In fact many steps ahead.

At he end of the course, of say 3 to 4 years, the fedora is obsolete
and the production systems they are faced with will be rather more
mature aka ancient.

I mentioned Centos. Last I heard of, Nobody stopped anybody from
contributing to Centos or SL.

Will take a about a week or more as I am co-ordinating with other
disparate sector people (about half a dozen) too and taking their
inputs.

Your single word "elaborate" isn't much useful in this regards.

I am afraid you are embroiled in small few server setups which are

Suggest you read Baskar's email again before posting.  He'd asked
for ideas/thoughts, which is what was provided.

So what are you on about??

Now only i saw that gnome3 & unity cannot be used side by side. Gnome3
installation made changes to unity files too. So, this reset is not
working..

the point i am trying to make is its Bhasker's business and he has worked
hard towards it, it can be anyone you me any one tomorrow , if one does
business in a certain way its better to leave or support him in some ways by
contributing to the goals by money or getting him some business , if you do
not think his idea is good enough for now of course you are free to change
the course that is what it is all about nothing less or more.

helping hands provided the commercials spelt out , also  what are the
support cost it has to be factored into the pricing if its not done yet.

I am looking at a synergy with academia/SMB in this perspective.

It is unfortunate that Satya completely missed the point.

It takes money to do open source and ait takes opensource to make a
aliving. RMS did it.

Even idiots can undrestand it.

Of course virus can be written by bill, lehmean, aig, etc and loot
your and my money  bu using (all taxes included) in MRP.

Luyggies need to understand that .

I suppose, you can uninstall Gnome 3 completely and reinstall unity by following
the steps mentioned in this blog post.

Baskar,

I have already provided as suggestion of using cobbler which we used
in production environment
for Install / Automation for Linux based distro's.

This let's the users to select kind of distro they want to install and
also managing them is much easier
for the system admin as well as users.

I had provided this information some time back on the same type of
thread. Please let me know if you need any help on this.

Regards,

Try to check the settings of Sound from System -> Preferences -> Sound.
Whether it is muted for Head Phones. Because in Some systems it gets Mute by
default. If so then Unmute it. May be a silly thing but it may be the fact
sometimes.

I would strongly suggest integrating IPA too for the highly dynamic
user management etc.

I know its tough work. But at this point of time I have no more than
one computer and no projects of such kind in hand to give further
technical input.

You mean the mic does not work? Or both speaker and mic don't?

Mic is usually muted, the alsa drivers do a great job of this magic. ;)

And the speaker will work if the audio driver is loaded.

No standard answer. Audio continues to dog Linux.

Message-ID: <BANLkTimyhv5ozOOAq_e4QqdsP5SiAEnG3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi lugies,

I work on atleast 20 to 40 machines daily. My authentication is
through LDAP. My laptop i use is windows xp and i use putty to login.
I have a desktop also which is rhel 5.4 32 bit. Now this 20 to 40
machiines is not entirly same machine of this atleast 15 of them will
be a new machine in some dc around the globe. i want to do Private
-Public key login , instead of thorugh typing the password everytime.
because file based authentication is more secure and easy. This
private key file should not be passwordless. i want to do passphrase
protected. As any body with access to my desktop or laptop can missue
my account to wreck havoc in DC. Though it is highly unlikely that is
possible. But i dont want to take chances. Now i want to do automatic
ssh into these machines. I tried keychain , which is says it can do
that. I dont mind keying in the passphrase couple of times a day of
work. But keychain requires i copy the public key file into every
machine i login into and every machine i login. If there any other way
to do passwordless ssh without needing manually copy the pub key into
each machine. Since the central ldap server already has all the
machine details, is it possible to do it from the central server. I
dont have control over the central ldap server, but i can talk to the
person holding the central server to do if i have substantial
information. Also how do i enable automatic login from windows to
linux through putty.I mean from from my laptop to desktop. here
copying the keys is ok. Since it is a one time effort. My point is how
to generate the keys in windows. Also if i use the same key pair in
linux as well as windows that would spare some effort in windows.

with regards,
ashwin

I dunno.

Putty should be able to use public key to login instead of password.

You can shop around for a LDAP based single sign on solution. But
 I have not heard of anything not used anything.

20 to 40 machines a day is a huge number and I can understand that
 typing the password is quite painful.

Why don't you run an ssh-agent(1) on one Linux host to which you login
 from Windows using putty and add all the private keys using ssh-add.

You have to type in the passphrases but once you do it you can
connect to any machine from there without password.

You have to generate a key pair on that machine and copy all the
public identities
 to each of the 20 or 40 hosts.

I hope I make myself clear.

Hello Ashwin,
           I think you can use Putty Gen to generate ssh keys. Once you have
deployed the public keys in all servers, use pageant.exe to load your keys.
now, you can connect to linux servers using putty. hope this solves your
problem.

Hi,
      I use Intel dg33fb desktop board and the default audio codec installed
is :* Realtek alc888* . I also followed the instructions given here
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto and made changes to
the */etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf* file and added the line *options
snd-hda-intel model=3stack-6ch-intel . *I also verified "3stack-6ch-intel"
is the model name for dg33* boards here :
http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sound/alsa/HD-Audio-Models.txt but
still the headphones don't work.

     When I open alsamixer in terminal , the headphone column alone is
disabled( greyed) .

     Any idea on the fix ?

Bala Kumar.

1. To copy keys easily once, ssh-copy-id is your friend. For instance,
   if you have a text file list out the various machines you ssh into,
   you could run a for-loop with ssh-copy-id to copy the keys.

2. gpg-agent can prevent having to repeatedly enter password.

Then is there anything equivalent to Skype in FOSS? Your point is strong but
what is the alternative?
It would be great if we have a list composed of FOSS tools equivalent to
these all

Try the steps mentioned in this article. And make sure , you find your own model
name from http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/audio_intel_hda#acer . If I'm right, yours
will be model=hp-laptop . Good luck and do let us know if it works :)

I did not see any such mail. In fact I don't know who OP is. Even if he had
done it, you could have avoided hitting reply-all instead of reply button!

But Just after sending it, I sent one more message on mailing list to avoid


I didn't see that either. This thread is only confusing because of all the
cross-posting.

Exactly. Whoever the OP was, he didn't cross-post to ILUGC, but
Narendra Sisodiya included ILUGC in the loop out of nowhere.

Having one mailing list is not going to happen and it is ok for LUGs
and User groups to have their mailing lists and topics. Though
cross-posting is not banned here, it is frowned upon. That is the
precise reason, we request to tag the cross-posted emails and use them
very sparingly for emails like announcements and etc.

India's Mostly used website and portal system is IRCTC, CricInfo etc,. What
is the hardware infrastructure that is needed to plan for an application
which handles more load that these two websites.

Say for a senario of 20 million users logs-in at a time.

What kind of server handles this load?
Can we go for Grid or Cloud Computing? which one is cheap and better?

Please suggest your Ideas.

No first hand info boss.

But I am sure it is a cluster of nodes.

If you run SSL then the ability to scale is reduced in a big way since
SSL takes a lot of
 CPU power.

Public key crypto is very expensive as you have to decrypt the secret
key using your private
 key for every SSL transaction.

If there is no SSL then some simple DNS round robin with some other
data center specific
 features thrown in would do nicely.

I don't think anybody uses grid of server grade hardware. I doubt it.

It is just good clustering.

But all this is peanuts compared to Google or yahoo.

Or even ebay or any other decent American website.

Rajesh,

          Could you please provide more information on the nature of the
website ? Is it going to have more static contents or dynamic contents ?
Akamai can help you in any case. We can help you offload your webserver by
serving contents from our servers instead of request reaching your origin.
           We have 80,000 Akamai servers across the globe and that enables
users to connect to their near edge servers. Once you provide more inputs on
the nature of your site, I can put you to our account team.

       FYI, the dns look up to crickinfo.com indicates they are akamai
customer.

The archives 
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2011-May/thread.html doesn't 
show such a mail either. I guess the person who cross-posted it to ILUGC 
wouldn't have been subscribed to ILUGC (don't know if he is the person 
starting the blatant cross-posting) and Narendra Sisodiya who is in 
multiple lists would have hit 'reply all' resulting in a dangling email 
discussion thread here. :-/

By providing more detailed information, you will help us to help you.

1. How do you want to connect to the internet? - Dialup, Broadband
using PPP over Ethernet, Broadband using ethernet (password on
router), Broadband using USB Modem/ USB Router, Wireless?

2. What have you tried to do so far?

3. What is the Windowing system are you using? (GNOME/ KDE/ ...?)

If I send you an OFFLIST email then why the hell you are sending it on
mailing list again..

and if you read the my mail then you will get you know that
I wrote a mail for "ASKING A SOLUTION FOR HAVING NO OR MINIMAL
CROSSPOSTING".. So like we can setup and ILUG-ANNOUCE  mailing list which
can be used for announcement purpose only (like a news or job posting or
anything which user want to post on many forums/) Now we can ask everybody
to join this mailing list or broadcast mail from this announcement mailing
list to all possible LUGs (ofcourse after moderation)

1 year back I got irritated by job posting on mailing list (because of cross
posting, same thing on all possible mailing list).. Then I created a
separate mailing list and after that I created/hosted a dedicated site for
it.. (http://fossjobs.in)

and Yes , I just made a single mistake in original posting..
I typed -- "So can we stop this?" I should have wrote - "So can we minimise
it"
next line say -- "We need to think some better solutions...."

You tried to diverted my discussion by typing this


   ""Wait a sec, IMHO you did the same ( cross posting ) with your "elpa
technologies" paid training "advertisement" email.""


Dude, There is no good mechanism (or better solution) exist that is why I
did cross-posting for elpa's training notice..

I wanted to discuss about community opinion rather the "play game of
criticism on who is doing what?"

PS: I do not have any attitude problem , probably you need to understand me
better and for this purpose you can spend some time with me on coffee or

Please don't cross-post forcibly. The person whom you are replying to, 
hasn't posted his reply to this list and probably is not a member of 
this list too. (Refer 
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2011-May/thread.html). It 
doesn't make sense to have dangling emails that make no sense to people 
subscribed only to this list. Think clearly before clicking 'Reply all'. 
This is the exact reason why cross-posting is considered bad and frowned 
upon in mailing lists.

Cross-post only if the information and the context are relevant to 
mailing list(s) and if some part of the conversation has happened out of 
some list, it is better not to forcibly add the left out list to your 
reply. Please check your recipients before sending the email.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Please stop hitting reply-all button. It is irritating to read
dangling mails that makes no sense.

Some general pointers:
Do not cross post any discussion mail; Tag announcement mails before
cross-posting; Avoid replying to any announcement mail; In most cases
it is expected that author of announcements should be contacted
off-list even if he/she did not cross post.

Thanks Mehul. It helped me. But, now, I am confused about one issue. Say, I
want some new software like FreeNX "installed" there. How can I do that in
remastering live cd? I mean, 1. Do I need to install that LiveCD in any
VMware and after that, I can add software ( by apt-get or something like
that) and then again make it iso?  2. Or, can I add software from unzipped
iso file? If this is the second one, how can I actually do it?
Any hint?

Good stuff. A couple of comments:
a. If you intend to share code and are expecting people to contribute back, it 
would be nice to host the code at some code repository like github.com. That way 
people can checkout the code, make changes and push back changes to you easily. 
Even for trivial scripts, I would recommend using gist.github.com (which also 
integrates well with blogs).

b. Why are you using wget to download the url ? Use something like the urllib2 
module in the python standard library and your script becomes instantly usable 
by anyone who might have python installed but may not have wget (python 
developers on windows, for instance).

c. For such a small script having an external dependency on BeautifulSoup might 
not be ideal. I would suggest using the re module from the standard lib to do 
your pattern matching and extraction.

If you host the script on github, I'll submit these changes - deal ?

cheers,
- steve

PS: ehe ...I do find it slightly amusing that you went with python to write a 
script to download ruby related webcasts :D !

Appreciate your initiative. Keep it up!

Long ago I used to use LUG as a playground to hone my tech skills.

I want more and more people to do the same thing to come out of the
 extremely limiting and mediocre thinking in India.

Well done.

It's really very useful.  Is there anything similar in Fedora to find newly

I think you should contact Limca book of Records (Guinness Records). I am
not joking and this is a serious suggestion as the company which has
installed /implemented maximum number of Linux installations in the world.

Try for that and if it is going to find a place, it will be great
achievement not only for you but for ILUGC also

Starting from August 2010 to till date we have setup FOSS labs in 83
engineering colleges in Tamilnadu and hope to reach 100 soon (probably
before end of this month) and aiming to finish all 180 engg. colleges (both
in Thirunelveli region and Chennai region) before August 2011 and I will
consider your suggestion once the job is done.

Hi Baskar:

Do you also provide a dump of Wikipedia when you setup the FOSS lab,
so they can use it for browsing (offline)?

Keep up the good work!

Yes, June 2008 offline edition (but not during the FOSS lab setup, but
provided in our FOSS lab server, as it takes about more than 5/6 hours for
extracting the whole content even on a core i3 processor + 4GB RAM + 1 TB
HDD)

Let me put it this way.

Even today Chennai has not come of age when it comes to software dev work.

You have to search in bangalore. I am sure other cities like Noida,
Pune and Mumbai are
lagging behind.

Even when I train people they get placed elsewhere mostly in Blore.

If you want to really learn software coding and engineering you should
learn in Bangalore.

I worked in Blore for more than 5 years.

The other thing is that your approach is wrong.

I posted for obtaining a house on rent in the paper. People started
calling and asking
 me where it was. ;)

So normally people who require employees post ads.

If you want a job you should look for it yourself.

Get my idea?

The onus is on you to impress employers to give you a job.

Best of luck.

  I can see a lot of difference between your script and mine,a few things i
can't understand ,

   1) you have used reporthook=lambda and xferred in try part , i can't
understand those.

   2) you have used exception but i  think there is no possiblity of getting
error ( i didn't get error
      for few videos i downloaded using your script ), can you explain why
you have used exception

   3) can we change the download option byte to kb

   4) whenever i cancel the script using ctrl+c and again start the script
it overwrites the previous
       file also starts from first video (so only i had to use wget to
download videos and continue), can we continue
        the download

Hi,

It just clicked me spontaneously.  Why not we have a separate discussion
forum site for ILUGC, and push all technical and lengthy discussions there?


Whenever a new topic is created in the forum, the members can post it here
for announcement, and then any further discussion can be made in the forum.

I dont want to prescribe any particular software, but obviously SMF and
phpbb are the popular PHP based ones.  (We can consider forums written in
other languages too, like ruby or python).  We can include open id feature
too for easy login.

If we need any new improvements on this discussion forum, we can categorize
it as "New Project" to be given to eligible engineering students as
mini-project and guide them to complete.

Regards,
Senthil

Thanks for your idea.
But, asking all the existing 2000 users to register in another forum
is too difficult.

There are many forums available like linuxquestions.org, ubuntuforums.org etc
We dont need a separate forum for ilugc. We can use any of the forums.

If you have any issues in the mailing list, we can discuss them and
fix them for sure.

Thanks a lot for thinking and providing suggestions for the
improvements of ilugc.

All suggestions are welcome and we can implement the better suggestions.

Thanks.

My organization if you can call it that does a lot of networking. ;)

We have products for networking techniques like ISP bandwidth
aggregation, failover, spam
 control, load balancing and so on. ;)

Now you learn networking with a lot of UNIX knowledge and sys admin experience.

And of course programming.

How do you plan to proceed?

That was intentional ;). Thought, I'd give you a reason to read up and learn 
some more python and some good programming practices :).

Well, ok, so the third parameter for urlib.urlretrieve() is reporthook. This 
parameter is supposed to be a function, which should accept 3 arguments. This 
function is called once at the time the connection is made and then again for 
every block that gets downloaded. The arguments passed to the function are 
number of block transferred so far, the block size in bytes and the total size 
of the file. Now, this reporthook parameter is optional, but I added it anyways 
to provide an indication if progress of the download. Furthermore, the reason it 
is a lambda instead of regular function is so that you can read up on what a 
lambda is :).

Well, again it was not strictly necessary, but I added it just to demonstrate 
how one might handle conditions like loss of network or lack of disk-space 
(which are both possible error conditions). That said, yeah, strictly speaking 
for such a small script, exception handling isn't really necessary.

Sure we can. Now that you know what the reporthook argument is, do you want to 
give it a this task a try ?

Hmm, yep, that's just me being lazy. Sure, we could check for existence of the 
downloaded files and also check the Content-length header with a http HEAD 
request to determine which files have been completely downloaded. I'll add this 
and push.

I hope you are having fun with all of this, if your intention was just to get a 
working script, your initial script was just fine.

PS: maybe we should take this off-list since this isn't exactly on-topic here.

The discussion forum site i proposed is not for replacing ILUGC..
rather, i proposed it as a complementary one..

We need not ask all 2000 users to register there..  but group of
people who wanted to discuss more upon a particular topic, can shift
to the discussion forum and discuss, while rest of the members can
subscribe to that particular topic if interested..

The only issue i have here is flooding of inbox.. thanx to gmail mail
thread grouping, i could manage it..   I am running another yahoo
group where some times hot debate will happen b/w few set of users,
which will flood all other members who may not be interested..

I took a small survey and found that whenever there are large mails
coming, it is because of intense debate b/w few members..  So i
thought of starting a discussion forum for the yahoo group, and
shifted such discussions there..  Members will initiate a thread in
the forum, and announce the same in the group..  And periodical
updates of discussion happening on the particular topic would be
mailed to the group.  This solved the mail flooding problem, while at
the same time, keep all the members updated of the main discussion..

I thought the same can be replicated here..

With advent of openid, the members need not be required to remember
the password..  I am in the process of integrating openid (yahoo &
gmail) in my forum site..

Senthil

Guys,

Please guide the newbies and don't try to be harsh with them. Our
action should encourage newbies to ask more questions without any
hesitation.

Ramesh: Can you be more elaborate on what are u trying to do and what

This is typical coporate boring non techie stuff.

You won't get a single open source free solution that offers all this.

Sorry Girish, I working on developing that kind of opensource solution, so i
need the inputs of the various systems so that i can build one properly.

Even though its a commercial solution, y it cant be open source.

This seems to be a dangling cross-post to this list. Please avoid
dangling cross-posts as it doesn't make any sense for readers
subscribed to ILUGC.

Subject: [Ilugc] Help & clarification needed in Setting up an Ubuntu based
	Internet center
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=42Hzf=vbne5oEvfxb9gMUF5v+aw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

My friend is running an Internet Center. When i visited there it was fully
Windows Systems inside.

He has got a single High speed internet connection and he shares it to all
the systems in the center via a single system.

He was complaining about Viruses because of Users downloading lot of
malicious contents.

So i preferred him to change all the systems to Linux (Ubuntu).

If so to set up such an internet center using Ubuntu, what are tools will be
required to share internet connection, ( i heard people talking about Squid,
but dont know much of it).

Can you list the essential tools to be needed ?

--thanks in advance, Prasanna

Many alternative ( open kiosk , dharma , outkafe ) but mkahawa is the one
which is still under development.

http://www.mkahawa.net/index.php

Their is also a dedicated GNU/Linux distribution for the same, but I am not
remembering its name right now , although that Linux derivative has a nice
web based interface.

I don't see any reason why cross-posting is not allowed here. Although
there is a lingering thread on it already going on, it might be good idea
to add it to the guidelines before starting with the policing ;)

If you can read my reply again, it will be clear that my comment was
not an effort at policing 'cross posting', but rather against the
dangling cross-posts. There is a discussion going on about
'cross-posting' and I am pretty much aware of that. The cross-post of
the OP to this list made no sense here, because it was cross-posted
somewhere in the middle of the conversation and that is precisely the
point I tried to raise. Cross-posting that is being discussed in
multiple lists is regarding sharing information across mailing lists
and not about 'dangling cross-posts'.

Thanks & Regards,

You can have some popular Linux distro inside. Something like Linux mint or
Ubuntu. (For the eye candy). Your friend has to decide if he wants to give
the users a full desktop or a kiosk. A kiosk is a restricted desktop like an
ATM where users have access to a limited number of applications and limited
access to applications.

If he needs a kiosk, you can build a kiosk out of scratch or you can use
some sophisticated suite like OpenKiosk:
http://openkiosk.sourceforge.net/index.html ( Thanks Gaurav Paliwal ).

He has got a single High speed internet connection and he shares it to all
> the systems in the center via a single system.
>

As a measure of security, you can have a good firewall, parental control
system, etc at the end node. I would recommend that you try Untangled for
this. If your friend has the resource, Untangled can run as a separate node.
Or he can run it in VirtualBox. Other standard security tools apply. Like
iptables, ( also checkout the Ubuntu package iptables-persistent ) etc.

There won't be too much of a Virus problem but if there is some Windows
machine connected to the network, you can protect it by using ClamAV at the
machine or you can add ClamAV to Untangle itself.

Squid is a proxy server, you can have polipo which is a light weight proxy
server (Apache:LigHTTPD = Squid:Polipo). Very simple yet effective.

Can you list the essential tools to be needed ?
>

It's essential that mp3 and other restricted formats of audio and video work
at the nodes. Install all restricted and proprietary codecs. (Free software
enthusiasts, appologise).

On the desktop, make sure you have icons for Libreoffice, GIMP, Chromium
Browser, VLC media Player, Firefox, games like 0ad, open-arena, sudoku,
mahjong, celestia, etc.

Install macslow's cairo clock and docky and a cool wallpaper for eye candy.
If you have scanner, install Xsane. Printer sharing has to be set up
carefully.

Some people may have questions. Make sure you have a sheet of paper with
info and (if possible) a copy of Ubuntu ready for them. :)

Oh, and if there are so many systems, updating them is going to be resource
intensive. Try apt-mirror for that. apt-mirror.sourceforge.net

Hi,

My brother was surfing through internet and found a nice and useful tool for
Transferring Files between the users in the same network.

It works fine and looks simple to use.

Application Name: Giver

Ubuntu / Debian users can install using:


apt-get install giver


After installing you can find the application in Applications -> Internet ->
Giver.

This application will automatically lists the users present in the same
network and when you click on the users, a pop menu appears to select two
options of
Sending a single file or send a single folder.

`cd -' is what I use while typing in the shell, mostly because it is
easier for me to remember where I came from, instead of a stack of
directories.   There is also a `dirs' command that shows the current
directory stack, which is automatically called when you do a `pushd'
or `popd'.

`pushd/popd' are fantastic when you are writing shell scripts, which
is rare enough for me that I might be doing it wrong.

I generally create env vars for frequently used dirs,

Subject: [Ilugc] Problems in Opening Aptana - an IDE for Rails 3
Message-ID: <BANLkTim26pWM-T6fWu5MjpBwkV6PX_-tZw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

OS: Ubuntu 11.04
Processor - Intel i5

I have downloaded Aptana Studio 3 - an IDE for Ruby on Rails 3 from the
below site
http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3

It was an ZIP archive file and extracted all the files into a separate
directory.

I followed the instructions from this page to get Aptana to be launched:
http://maketecheasier.com/install-aptana-studio-in-ubuntu-intrepid/2009/03/23/
and also from this link:
http://docs.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Installing_Aptana_on_Linux

But when i try to open the AptanaStudio ( executable file ) i get
notification in the programs bar at the bottom of the desktop that " Opening
Aptana Studio " then it disappears and nothing happens. Am not getting the
IDE launched. It is also not running at background, i found using top.

How can i get it?

--Thanks in advance , Prasanna

My friends company has been planning to migrate to linux completely. They
have around 800 employees. They are using Microsoft AD for authentication.
As we know AD is costly and closed. I preferred him to use OpenDs. Now we
have a problem in migration those used. We planned to export schemas in LDIF
and tried to import to Opends. But i am not sure that we can achieve
completely using the above method.

Is there any tools to migrate the from AD ? Is there any other way to
migrate. Please help me on this.

I have never done this myself and I have very little exp with AD.

But wherever AD is LDAP compliant you can migate users to Linux.

But convincing users to use openoffice, pdf writers and so on in Linux is going
 to be a challenge.

I'm not aware of any readily available tools. But if you are good at Perl/Python,
you can write a program to pull necessary information from your windows
box using the ADSI library (available for Perl and Python on windows) and then
populate your LDAP server by correctly mapping the elements. I remember doing
this a couple of years ago (from AD on Windows 2000 server to OpenLDAP). Also,
some manual tasks were involved related to migrating schema from windows 2000
to OpenLDAP on Linux platform. The point is - it is do-able, although not in a 
straight-forward way.

Search for Perl ADSI or Python Windows ADSI for more information.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

The trick is - "Dont convince :-)". Mandate it as a company/BU requirement 
and give no options to the users. Eventually, the concerned users will learn 
these tools and migrate - it worked pretty well in many companies and 
organizations. This is assuming that the users are part of the organization.

There is no Problem with the users at all, they are ready, Only thing is
they have implemented lot of group policies and Schemas in AD. But now we
need to convert it to OpenDS.

AD itself will easily sync with Linux but its too costly they are paying
around 2-3k for a single user in AD.

In previous post Mr.Karthikeyan did not ask you to try to plug in front and
back port. Instead he asked you whether when you play any song or video and
if you can able to hear sounds from speaker. and your complain was you are
not able to hear sounds from headset. so he said you to play an audio or
video with headset plugged and he has said you to unplug headset while the
song is still being played and now can you hear the sounds from system
speaker?

Did you try this?

System -> Preferences -> Sound
and then click on Output tab in it and select " Analog HeadPhones " as
Connector and now check whether it works?

I may not know something and could be doing something crazy. So, I request
you not to apologize or feel sorry for it.

You have not stated how you exported the user data.

To the best of my knowledge, Group Policies are Windows specific.
Perhaps, you can  extract the user data by means of "ldapsearch" on
the relevant DIT if you don't need the group policy data.  (I have no
idea about the MSADS schema for this information).

For single sign-on, you will have to integrate Kerberos (no idea if
openDS has this integration built in).

Make a prototype test bed and migrate a handful of users and test out
the feature set relevant to your setup.

Please keep us posted on how your migration goes.  I think a write up
on your experience would be an excellent reference.

Best,

Dear Rajesh,

Active Directory is a lot more than just an LDAP server.  The people 
here http://www.samba.org/ understand this very well and are working 
together as a team to build a free open source replacement for Active 
Directory (http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba4).  Your time and 
energy would be better spend contributing to this effort rather that 
going it alone.

There are no charges for the FOSS lab setup.  Colleges pay only the TA/DA
expenses for the resource person which usually range from 1K to 3K and
accommodation (if the college is located beyond 200+ km from Chennai)

ex. Chennai, Kanchipuram, Thiruvallur Districts - 1K
Kanyakumari / Thirunelveli / Thoothukudi Districts - 3K + accommodation

I think its time we charge for it , there were days when no one has
any knowledge of GNU/Linux or related software .
Now with widespread usage any additional effort put on it like
customisation etc  is worth more than just some voluntary or non-paid
amount .
I am not sure of many agree with me but do charge something .

I remember selling "ubuntu tamil" cds for 30 bucks or so though the
media+ burning would cost like 16 rupees or so . It was done so as to
not see the cd's hanging infront of buses as shiny mirror/reflector .

Pavithran

After all, it is Baskar who is doing all the work and it his call how
much to charge :)

I sincerely believe he is doing it because of his passion to promote
and proliferate FOSS into educational institutions that otherwise
might not have considered the move (the last part is a guess).

Yes I agree. The software is free but I think, services should be paid.
colleges often spend thousands and lakhs of rupees on installing windows and
their servicemen. why cant they pay some amount for the service in
installing FOSS ? This would also encourage volunteers to sustain the
enthusiasm.
Isnt it the the colleges are taking advantage of free service ?
generally I have seen  people take more care of things(services or goods)
which are bought. freebies are always looked down over their counterparts.

Most of us fail in support services especially when we try to spread
the message of foss.
Customers look for good support model and they don't mind paying if
support is proper and it works for their business without having to
wait for long time.

To continue to success of these implementation people should volunteer
for supporting and solving issues that might arise in these places.
Otherwise user's will not continue to use foss applications and tools.

Other way around would be training the staff of each college on foss
which is quite expensive for customers.

The Best way I could think of is the create LUG's inside their
colleges and support them through nearby LUG's. [ eg. ILUGC,KLUG,PLUG
]

I am willing to spare some time on Saturday / Sunday if anyone need
help on this.

Most of the colleges do not allow their students to do anything on systems, other than lab exercises.

Unfortunately, colleges want us to do some then during their spare time and not at our spare time. For most Saturday and Sunday are strict no.

Amazing work.

Is there an AMC or something like that ? That would be one way to charge 
for your services.

Dear all,

>

I would like to clarify few things regarding our FOSS lab setup and other
services for colleges.

FOSS lab setup is free of cost only for the first 30-35 computers and
additional computers are charged at Rs.200/- each (in multiples of 10).  So
far, only one college has requested and paid for additional computers.

Few of the colleges were interested in purchasing our FOSS lab server to
implement open source throughout the institution (our business model remains
sustainable/profitable only in this way).

Additionally we also provide services like implementation of DSpace with
browser based video streaming for NPTEL video contents developed by IITs and
IISc and LTSP based lab setup for internet browsing / first year lab in
engineering colleges.

Currently we serve about 300+ academic institutions in the state and hope to
double this no. in the next two years.

As I see many of the Institutions in Tamilnadu have been heavily investing
for new technology related products, FOSS related products / services has
good market potential in the educational vertical.

Good to see very basic manual. can you provide as a PDF rather than viewing
as a webpage? it takes lot of time to load simple contents.

There are many people around the world who dedicate their efforts ( and 
in many cases, a large portion of their lives ) towards doing open 
source work, and do so in a contributory manner with no interest or 
drive to gain financially from that. Its these people who are, to a very 
large part, responsible for the open source efforts at large ( not linux 
centric per se ).

The idea of the $DayJob and $RealLife sort of stems from this concept. 
Might be a bit strange to get ones head around, but if you consider it 
- its not that strange at all.

The person you are is based quite a lot on what you do, how you do it, 
where you have been and the people you have interacted with. None of 
these things have a bearing on money or financial gain as the primary 
motive ( but, we all need to eat and live in a house too ). It depends 
on finding a balance on where you want one set of things to stop and the 
other side to start. In many cases its possible to bridge the two sides 
or even straddle them at the same time. Sometimes its harder. And in yet 
other situations the DayJob and PassionJob are very very different. eg. 
A good friend of mine, excellent programmer and fantastic tutor actually 
has a $DayJob playing in a band.

just my 2bits

I meant more along the lines of the idea, ethos and ecosystems around 
open source, rather than code and content itself. Much like people do 
charity and humanitarian work.

When run  on your NFS server, this shows list of all connected
NFS clients.  Note that NFS mounts are per workstation and
not per user.

Hi,

I had installed Fedora 14 on my brother's PC. All went well, until recently
when I visited him I found the below issues.

1. The login screen appeared half. The remaining half showed some wierd
behavior, it appeared blank and when I hovered the mouse on that area, it
behaved like I was seleting that portion of the screen.

2. I booted into single user mode and when I started typing, there was no
output on the console, however when I hit enter I got the results displayed.

3. The system is a dual boot with windows and when I boot into windows, I
see no issues.

4. Could not locate any error in logs though there were some {II} messages
about some GTK "some.c" widget missing.

Any pointer will help.

Regards,
Ashish

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=07vT4Ho0Y9yM9ghn0LCaCd+PPUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Friends

  I would like to know which of these frameworks - RoR or Drupal - should be
chosen for developing a new website.

  The website should support the following.

   - A system for
   - requests to be created by customers,
      - which get automatically assigned to engineers
      - request gets resolved by the assigned engineer
      - customer closes the request with a rating
      - Excellent Database support
      - both customers and engineers must be able to register / login to see
      the status of their requests.
      - Automatic emails on request status
      - Generating Reports must be easy.


   - 'Social' from the ground up.


   - Easy Payment Gateway Integration


   - 100,000+ Hits a day


   - support for Great UI. More importantly, Changes to the UI must be very
   easy.


  A google search on the topic gives results pointing more towards Drupal
(as probably the internet is dominated by PHP/Drupal developers) and am
finding it hard to decide.

  I also heard a suggestion to go for Microsoft ASP.NET for scalability
reason- confused again :(.  I do not want to "pay" for Microsoft products. I
feel an open source product supported by a community of developers would be
better than a Microsoft product. And that would keep the costs low as well.

  Could someone give me pointers. Once website development starts, changing
the framework later on would prove to be very expensive and I want to avoid
such a situation. Hence, need your expert opinions.

  Please excuse if ilug is not the forum to ask such a question.


Thanks.

Shaahul Hameed

The motivation behind choosing a framework/language is driven by many
factors; one of the primary being the
availability of developers; followed by the ease of development and
maintainence.

Looks like it is a CRM software that you guys want to build. Have you
considered off-the-shelf CRM solutions?
Nothing stops you from building everything from scratch though, if
you've a justified pros and cons that favor reinventing the wheel.

There is no silver bullet in the choice of web frameworks. The factors
that you should consider are
a. do I have developers with the right experience.
b. will my customers spend X amount of money on hardware/software.
c. does the framework lets me write clean, testable code without
getting in my way.

Here's a list of frameworks that support MVC model really well and
lets you do TDD & have good test coverage:
Play, Spring MVC, ASP.Net MVC (its open sourced and you can deploy the
website in linux-apache-mysql-mono stack), Struts 2, Rails 3, Django,
Grails. (And the list is huge, I've listed only the 'popular' ones)

Thanks a lot for suggesting Issue Tracking / Request Tracking Systems.

That's exactly what I need which would be at the core of the website.
So that would be one part of the solution I am looking for.


As I mentioned in my first mail, these are my requirements:

What I am also looking for is the "web development framework" that
would best support such ticketing systems in addition to other points
mentioned above - so that the website development and maintenance
become easy.

I am looking for a sturdy long-term solution. Based on the frameworks
/ technologies you suggest, I would be off-loading the complete
website development to a company with the required expertise.

Thanks.

It does not matter what you choose. Choose the technology that you are most
comfortable with. However, it is better to avoid propereitary and closed
platforms like asp.net. Also it is not fair to compare drupal and rails.
Drupal is a cms system while rails is a framework. If you want to learn a
new technology while building the app, choose rails. It will help you
tremendously with newer projects.

See a video about this here:
http://spoken-tutorial.org/What_is_a_Spoken_Tutorial_English

See a video on how can we create the videos:
http://spoken-tutorial.org/Create_Spoken_Tutorials

Bala explained the requirements to create a qualified video and
demonstrated by creating a sample video.

We started the Ubuntu Release Party by sharing the cool drinks and snacks.

Vishnu explored the features of the new programming language "Go".

Then, Shrinivasan played the movie about the 20 years of linux in tamil.

The video is available here.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZKI0u18iLQ

Kumaran explored the new features of Ubuntu 11.04


The presentation is available here:

They encourage students to create solutions for all problems in
electrical engineering books
using scilab.
This will increase the support for scilab and make easy to implement
scilab in the colleges,
and to migrate from matlab.

Then, he explained about the spoken tutorial project and how can we contribute.

After his session, we discussed about a system to manage the entire project.
To make easy of the process of video creation,approval and translations.

Thanks for prof Kannan for the nice interactions.

Please contact Prof.Kannan if you are willing to contribute to the
project ""Spoken-Tutorial".

Subject: [Ilugc] 2011 Fresher looking for a job
Message-ID: <BANLkTinS2b+bQDsnkmbJQqWbBhBKgmbk6w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

 I am Nasreen, a Fresher with a Masters Degree in Computer
Applications (MCA) and have graduated with a GPA of 8.5 out of 10 in
April, 2011. I also hold a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics from
Calicut University.

 I have done my MCA Final Year project in Java titled "Proxy Strategy
Testimony and Calibrate" and a Mini
Project in Dot Net titled "E-Book".

 I am a girl from Coimbatore and have come to Chennai in search of a
job and would like to get started immediately as an intern or trainee.
I am open to learning in any technology the PRACTICAL way (as opposed
to the theoretical approach during my college days). I am willing to
work hard to face the real-life challenges of the start-up world.

 Please let me know if there is a suitable position for which I could
apply. I am available for a face to face discussion during the
weekdays. I would be glad to forward you a copy of my resume, if
needed.


Thanks for your time!

Nasreen

          Nothing annoying about it. IMHO, It's good to know how
interested colleges are in moving to FOSS and of course the great work
that you have been doing should be known to others :) Thanks

Dear Luggies,

Our activities have been dried up, It appears to me that ilugc is on the way
to find a place in the list of endangered species.
To raise the level of our performance, i sincerely feel the need to
retrospect the "office boy" role and that the same be given to a new person.

Can you elaborate on what activities that happened earlier that is not
happening now? IMHO ILUGC has undertaken more work than previous
years. Increased number of lectures in colleges, writing FOSS lab
manual, more interaction with student fraternity, are few things that
come to my mind immediately. Of course, these are happening apart from
the usual regular monthly meets.

Kindly tell me what is the strength of our last 3 to 4 monthly meets.
Kindly tell me how many workshop which we conducted in the last 4 months.
Kindly tell me how many threads of quality/fire on thread were there in the
last 6 months.
Kindly tell me how many LDD/Expo we have conducted in the last 6 months.

I would present my case in the forth coming lug meet on "Is LUG lacks
courage in accepting its errors".

I dont know much about the lug history and past,but i feel that the
thread is to be reduce in mailing list now a days.it may be due to the
split up of lugs in various region..regarding activities,monthly meet
is comparitively good now and most of the people attend the meet
during this period only..instead of change the office boy,change our
attitude discuss for further activities.

Hi,

>>.instead of change the office boy,change our

Lets accept the problem and correct it first. Strong leadership means
brighter future, If appears to me the future is bleak because of the "non
inclusiveness of people into the stream" by the current office boy. I have a
strong case which i will present in the forth coming meet.

Hi,

2011/5/31 Thyagarajan ?????????? <citizenofgnu at gmail.com>:
>> Is any monthly meet bettering in terms of participants after July 2010

          Why do you feel that the number of participants is a
yardstick ? Are we just talking about crowd pulling ? Even if the lug
meet has just 10 people, but something of great value is being
discuss, I would consider that to be quite active. Thanks


PS: There are ilugc members who are far away from Chennai and there
are people for whom Saturdays might not workout well. So, we should
never use the participant strength as a measure.

+1

Definitely participant strength should not be considered as a measure of
quality. There are a lot of factors that influence it.

>From students perspective, the months of March, April and May are tightly
packed with academic works (project submission/review, semester examination
and the like). This will have a considerable effect on the count. And now
it's summer vacation and so the students who are not native to Chennai would
not be available.

Thus considering the count of people as a measure is absurd, unless it drops
drastically. (If the participant/user strength has to be considered the
measure, Windows has to be called the best OS!)

from what I have seen on the list, the quality of talks has gone up and
also there is more planning in the talks. As for discussions on the
list, I find all my questions have been satisfactorily answered and that
seems to be the case with most questions asked. I also get the
impression that most people are happy with things. If you are not, the
onus is on you to point out what you think is wrong.

Beats me why are you keen on presenting it in the meet instead of
doing it here in this discussion, if you are of the opinion that the
attendance of the last 3 to 4 monthly meets is low! Please
substantiate your claims properly so that we can identify and address
the real issues.

That is initial euphoria of college students. :-) Wait for two more
months and it will be repeated again!

The LUG has seen consistent 20-30 member participation in all
subsequent meets, including last meet. IMO this is enough numbers
given the numbers in other lugs.

And talks are also good and varied in nature. I have never seen such
variety in ILUGC meet previous years. If you are not satisfied with
the quality of talks, can you let the list know what talks you found
bad?

As for workshops, this year there were more workshops guided by our
co-ordinator than last year. In my alma matter, I heard through
juniors that there were three workshops conducted on behalf of ILUGC
including a Faculty Development Programme for 3/4 days.

And also I know that ILUGC has conducted regular workshops, through
the updates he gives during the monthly meets.

Since you brought up the subject of organising meets, workshop etc,
can you please let the list know when was the last time you attended
the meet? And tried to broach this subject, so that co-ordinator would
have corrected his 'mistakes' or at least we the meet participants
would have offered help to conduct activities properly and pushed him
to do so?

         For streaming, an Encoder is required. I would suggest you to
search for an encoder package and install it. That's the start for any type
of streaming.

Can you let us know about the people whom he did not include? why wait
till the meet. You can let us know in the list. This is beneficial in
many ways:

1) Easier to read slowly, understand and then reply. (not all people
are orators. :)
2) Will serve as a record of discussions.
3) Some active members may not be able to come to next meet due to
various reasons. (Eg, I ve attended all meet since last august, yet I
cannot come to next meet due to college holiday schedule as told by
Vignesh )

Dear Thyagarajan,

Thanks a lot for your interest in improving the performance of our community.

Here is a list of events we had from Jan 2011 to May 2011.

Seminar: 6
Workshop: 4
Monthly Meet: 5
Foss Lab Server Implementations: 34

Please add here, If I miss something.

We appreciate your interest and expectations on improving our activities.
We could have done more in the past 5 months.
But, there are many parameters that affect the number of events.

The colleges we discuss, take more time to approve for any events.
In the coming semester, let us hope for events from various colleges.

Please feel free to share your thoughts on improving the performance
of our community.

If you have any issues on my performance/activities, you are always welcome to
discuss them in the list itself.

Being a part of a FOSS community is a great opportunity to learn so many stuff.
Mistakes are often pointed by community and it gives immense pleasure
to know that many people are interested in our growth and improvement.

Please share your views.

There is copious documentation on openDS's web site.

Specifically for users/administrators
<https://www.opends.org/wiki/page/OpenDSUserDocumentation>

and for developers
<https://www.opends.org/wiki/page/OpenDSDeveloperDocumentation>

I hope you can find the stuff you are looking for.

Subject: [Ilugc] Script to see Foss job through terminal
Message-ID: <BANLkTiki+KbjRqBBHOW40oW-A=9Z_7SrGw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi geeks,

  I wrote a ruby script , By using this, we can see fossjobs from terminal
that was posted in fossjobs.in  <http://fossjobs.in/>

Link of that script was below. Please see that and give your suggestion

http://sathia27.wordpress.com/2011/05/30/update-foss-job-script/

Using this we can,

   1. we can search for job by date
   2. by range of date
   3. and by keywords (i.e) ROR, PHPMYSQL etc.
   4. We can also see description of job,  if we needed.

                                                        Thank you
