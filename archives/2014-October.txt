Hi,

Lucia (2013 film) is a crowd funded and crowd sourced movie made in
Karnataka that used social media for its promotions.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucia_%282013_film%29

Please watch

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piiTeYDn6xA

where the movie's director Pawan explains the insane amount of
creative thinking and genius that helped to produce this movie.

Please do watch this 90 minutes video completely. Every minute has
important lessons.

I couldn't resist sharing this stunning talk as it has lot of
correlations and implications for what we are doing:

Motivating people for a shared vision !

Ravi

Hi, all FOSS Outreach Program for Women participants need to sign in as
candidates or mentors at https://opw.gnome.org/

Mentors can find specific documentation at
https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/Admin/System

The deadline for submissions is Oct 22 2014, 07:00 pm UTC
Selection decisions will be posted on Nov 12 2014, 07:00 pm UTC

As a novelty in Round 9, all Ascend Project participants, regardless of
gender, are welcome to apply. Ascent is a mentorship and barrier-removing
accelerator program designed to explicitly invite, include, and support
adult learners in making a first technical contribution to Open Source
software.

http://ascendproject.org/participants/portland/index.html

After some discussions, this is a first step expanding this outreach
program to other groups under-represented in the free software community.
I'm personally very happy to see actual progress! Kudos to the GNOME
Foundation and the FOSS OPW supporters.

We also use it for our production environments and we highly recommend
this. Also very low on resources

Some of the members who are in Hard ware business (we are also into the
same but don't know the sources) should   find out who are selling in India
the Atom boards with 4+ network cards. Some thing like below::; (reasonable
pricing)

http://www.hacom.net/catalog/mercury-uno-n270-firewall-appliance

We have raised this sometime back in ILUGC - hoping that somebody will
inform all the people about this as this is a space which is still void in
India. The key thing is reasonable pricing - many can import from other
countries but will work out to be costly.

Anyway, coming back to the point - pfSense is an excellent choice.

These boards run at low volumes and thus are higher priced even abroad than
say routers or PCs. OpenWRT, Tomato and similar firmware is favoured as
they run on common routers like Linksys, Buffalo etc. pFSense does not. It
may be worthwhile to have a project to make it run on such hardware than to
pursue purchase at reasonable price of low volume hardware.

Hi,
For maintenance purposes, I shutdown my almost new Dell server and removed my 6 drives from the server.
Afterward I placed them back in and restarted the server. The raid detected 4 drives out of 6. BTW, I am using Raid 5.
Since this is a new server, I called Dell for support. They deleted and recreated the Virtual drive. It was not initialized. It sees the old partition but it is not loading it.
Please help me get things back to the way they were.I have recent data not backed up. I would like to get everything back.

I have the webrtc platform - just depends if you guys can arrange the 
hardware your side.

Would require a webcam and echo cancelling mic / speaker.

Subject: [Ilugc] Nginx with Centos7
Message-ID: <CADtvZWCU1VkuSMS=u+Sy95qM2nAWmNpx5Sjp_CZGoOHrpC=OVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Am trying to setp-up nginx in centos7 (minimal image), and it seems like
installed successfully, but failed to start.

Below the steps which I followed to install nginx -

Created a file at /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo and add following content to
repo file:

[nginx]
name=nginx repo
baseurl=http://nginx.org/packages/centos/$releasever/$basearch/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1

And "yum install nginx", installed nginx without returning any error.

Then started nginx by using - sudo systemctl start nginx.service, but "
http://localhost or IP" not loading nginx default welcome page

I have verified whether any other services are running on the port 80, its
used by nginx only. Below the result.

lsof -i :80

COMMAND  PID  USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
nginx   2357  root    6u  IPv4  20726      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)
nginx   2358 nginx    6u  IPv4  20726      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)

cat /var/log/nginx/error.log is empty.

So where am wrong ? Pls help.

Please check selinux and iptables and try again.

If possible put selinux in permissive mode and trun off iptables and try
again.

+1  PC Engines has a new board with 3 NICs and 1GB RAM + 1Ghz CPU
costs around $150 + shipping + customs.   The soekris boards are even
more expensive.

I have used ATX form factor boards in regular cabinets with 4/5 NICs
(depending on PCI or PCI e slots) and get the same effect or perhaps
more powerful setup with a high end CPU and more RAM.

You can also pick up dual/quad port NICs on ebay.com (go for the buy
now option) from $25 to $50.  I prefer them as they are system pulls
from decommissioned servers in data centers; they are high quality.

For small network (< 25 nodes), Atom base boards with USB/RJ45 NICs
have also done a reasonable job for a FW+GW setup.

Friends,

Its solved after restarting my wireless access-point. Trying to figure-out
what was wrong with my AP, which is a normal (Low cost) access point.

Thanks Alot.

Special thanks to Rohit Bhute, Sathya Narayanan & Rigved (ILUM) for the
prompt reply and support.

1. Please do not top post.
2. OP clearly asked for open source FW while this is a commercial product.
3. I'll give you the benefit of doubt that language used was
unintentional. Broad, prescriptive and promotional statements like "it
will very useful to you" are to be avoided, especially for commercial
products.

Hi All,

Do we have any GUI tools to monitor data consumption for Ubuntu 14.04?
By googling, I came to know that download-monitor (from
duncanjdavis/download-monitor-submit)
was good with 12.04.

But it looks like the app is not available now. Please advise me some
alternatives

Hi all,

We now have all of the source code and audio files of my Tamil Text to
Speech application in Github.

https://github.com/vasurenganathan/tamil-tts

This open source package has all of the core components for any Tamil TTS
application and I am sure others can make use of it and improve this
further.

Thanks to Shrinivasan for helping me with making a repository in Github for
this application.

Vasu

Hi All,

As said by Thiyagarajan we are in lack of volunteer support. But If any 
one is willing to provide support we can also conduct via webrtc 
platform. We very much appreciate the volunteers who can provide 
support(like setting up the gadgets and connectivity) .

Apologies for late reply.

Hi

I have a question of how to print the longest line in bash scripting ?
Most appropriate would be to search for longest dictionary value.

*Input file contains*
Bala -> 54; 56; 57
Bala -> 54; 57
Bala -> 56; 57
Bala -> 54; 56; 57;60
Name -> 64; 66; 67
Name -> 64; 67
Name -> 66; 67
Name -> 64; 66; 67;60
Super -> 78
First -> 29, 60
First -> 29

*Output should be*
Bala -> 54; 56; 57;60
Name -> 64; 66; 67;60
Super -> 78
First -> 29, 60

efficient method.

while read line
do
    domain=`echo $line | cut -d" " -f1`
    echo $domain >> FirstColumn.txt
done < input.txt

cat FirstColumn.txt | sort -u > unique.txt
mv unique.txt FirstColumn.txt

while read line

    grep $line input.txt | cut -d" " -f3 | sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/ | /g'
done < FirstColumn.txt

Doesn't sort has key option?

Will this give the desired result?

sort -k 1 input.txt

Very few people do Ph.D in Mathematics in India. Good :).

This is not the right place to ask for papers that cannot be
redistributed and it is illegal to distribute it. Being an NITian most
probably your institute may have subscribed for that. Please check
with your institution's library or Math department.

This mailing list is related to Linux and open source software, people
here may not be aware of Mathematics. So I don't see any point in
asking questions related to Mathematics here.

Debit cards in india and financial and banking rules change every second.
So this bwhaviour is no suprise. Try using established indian gateway like
CC Avenue that works with all.

Hi All,

As said by Thiyagarajan we are in lack of volunteer support. But If any
one is willing to provide support we can also conduct via webrtc
platform. We very much appreciate the volunteers who can provide
support(like setting up the gadgets and connectivity) .

Apologies for late reply.

I am not sure if the question is off topic but I need some input before I
can finalize anything.

Actually to do my higher studies (in research) I wanted to make sure that I
land my career in Digital Image / Signal Processing only. I have a strong
background in Computer Application development. Now the Signal Processing
course comes under Electronics And Communication Engineering / domain while
Computer Vision & Speech Recognition subjects comes under Computer Science.

I am not sure if these subjects are different or doing Computer Vision /
Speech Recognition is nothing but DSP / DIP. Is MATLAB being used for
Computer Vision / Speech Recognition software?

Should I opt for Electronics And Communication Engineering course or one
from Computer Science? Kindly guide me appropriately

Dear Satya,


After PhD if you want to join academic institutes then in some places
people asked for preceding degree is in the relevant branch.
Otherwise, most of the places, it is hardly matter.

Enjoy your research and then publish good papers in hi-impact factor
journals/conferences.

Matlab and R are two good languages (sometime framework) in research where
you can design/integrate almost anything.

Wish you good luck!!!

Regards,
Koushik

Computer vision and speech recognition are extension / applications of
Signal processing.

You should be learning DIP / DSP as a course before going into its application.
Yes MATLAB is widely used but GNU Octave, Scilab are open altrenatives
of MATLAB.

Topic : Introduction to VtigerCRM

About vtigercrm: From wikipedia.

*Vtiger CRM* refers to both cloud and open source versions of the CRM
application offered by the company Vtiger. Vtiger's open source
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source> CRM
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management>
application was originally forked from SugarCRM
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SugarCRM> with the intention of being a
fully open source CRM application with comparable functionality to SugarCRM
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SugarCRM> and Salesforce.com
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce.com>. It offers reporting, a
customer portal and an Outlook plugin in its free edition, whereas those
functions are in paid versions of the other CRM applications. Vtiger's
cloud application was released in 2010, and offers added functionality such
as a new interface, advanced reporting, and email campaigns.

Which application are you using to compose your email.  You have a
Gmail address,  GMail browser interface does not restrict you to top
posting.
I composed this response from Gmail browser client.     You need to
click on the box with the  3 ...  It expands the text, navigate

Message-ID: <CAN5jxNYbxi3HsHU44keHhTotOQy5BuRihoQOwdZpBWJL1_w7LQ@mail.gmail.com>

Everybody must have heard about Malala's story, If not read link below
http://www.malala.org/#malalas-story

She got Noble prize for her activity today.  Malala Yousafzai becomes
youngest-ever Nobel Prize winner.

Comunity "*Malala*" created "*Hour of code*" for educating children. They
are calling all teachers world wide to participate in "Hour of code"

Check how can you help.
http://code.org/help

http://community.malala.org/the-hour-of-code-756960257.html

*Description*:
Last year, hundreds of organizations joined together to create fun
introductions to computer programming for all to learn during Computer
Science Education Week. Over 15 million students tried an Hour of Code.
More girls tried computer science than in the last 70 years, with over 10
million girls participating in this worldwide 5-day event in 2013.

This global movement seeks to expand participation in computer science by
making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women
and underrepresented students of color. Every student should have the
opportunity to learn computer science. It helps nurture problem-solving
skills, logic and creativity. By starting early, students will have a
foundation for success in any 21st-century career path.
Anyone, anywhere in the world can participate in an Hour of Code during
December 8-14, 2014. We encourage all teachers, parents and students from
all countries to join the movement.

Learn more on how to participate and help reach the goal of getting the
Hour of Code to 100 million students.

The question is ambiguous.   Do you mean storage (like in files),
network b/w consumption, or download/upload data consumption?

I am also looking for similar tools like this,
What we need is, to control the internet bandwidth in the office, for ex,
If some downloads exceeds "N" bytes, limit their speed, and also, If
something important, then I need to prioritize the bandwith consumption for
a person.


Thanks in advance.

I am on Linux Mint Cinnamon and I monitor my broadband data usage with
below applets.

http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/141
http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/31

Not sure what Ubuntu equivalents are. Cinnamon hosts a lot of other
such nifty applets & desktop widgets. If you're not specific about
Unity, you could try using Cinnamon. (on Ubuntu itself)

Subject: [Ilugc] Difference between sudo apt-get install and installing from
	source
Message-ID: <CADoCDct6cPqTZepYHZH=AmMxKtnVEARUUBCrNJSc=pzXLtk26Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all ,

What is the difference between sudo apt-get install tesseract and
installing from source  .
Let me explain the context so that it could give a clear picture .

I wanted to work with Tesseract and build better Training Data for Tamil
language as well as see if any modifications could be done to engine also
to make it more responsive for Tamil .
1.Hence installed Tesseract via sudo apt-get install tesseract .
2.I could see that the files and folders relating to tessdata were created
in /usr/share/tesseract-ocr
3.And installed all the necessary packages as mentioned here
https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/Compiling
4.Now the command tesseract is working fine .
5.I wanted to see the debugging of the system , hence posted a question
here
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tesseract-ocr/BxZvoUlxjOc
6.I was asked to perform the make file operations in Java folder .
7.Since within the /usr/share I could not find java folder , I created a
folder and tried to do the make .But it did not work out .
8.As per zdenop reply in the above  and Arun Pandian's reply to an earlier
mail , I am trying to configure it from the source and hence created a
clone using
git clone https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/
9.Here I could find the /java folder .
10.Trying to find answer via search engine leads me here
http://askubuntu.com/questions/335684/installation-difference-between-from-source-and-apt-get
But I am not satisfied with the answer

My questions are
1.What is the difference between package installation and installing from
source ?
2.Where can I find the files if I am doing a package installation ?
3.Am I doing the entire process wrong ?

Its nice to see some changes in ilugc. I have been top posting for a while
and none seems to care. The ancient dragons that breathe fire for every
thing they could think about seems to have mellowed.

I have used SMS lingos when I posted from mobile (because I can't type
fast) and still none has come out cursing me.

Its nice to see control-freak old habits dying and new era dawning. Let me
see how this non political situation holds.

Now it looks like a tolerant tech group than controlled by some law firm.

Hi

>>I have used SMS lingos when I posted from mobile (because I can't type

Nice to see that you have  not used any SMS lingo in your mail.
congrats and it is a good start.

>>Its nice to see control-freak old habits dying and new era dawning. Let me
see how this non political situation holds.
>>Now it looks like a tolerant tech group than controlled by some law firm.

I am recollecting Late Mr.Kenneth Gonsalves who used to scout for keeping
the guidelines,
Some members(some times including myself) where annoyed of that, but when
he is no more ,
I find that value addition which he brought to the table is incredible and
missing now.

In my view,when we deviate from the prescribed guidelines and if some one
is there to guide us on how to conduct ourselves under the pretext of
guidelines is no harm,In fact it helps like a crucial sign board when you
drive a car in the dark on a ghat road.

Above all, self reforming is a greatest thing, I would like to quote
"Self-reform automatically brings about social reform" - words of Shri
Ramana Maharishi.
Thanks for the self-reformed post @karthikeyan.a.k .

regards.

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

I guess looking into the source and following the code will be easier. You
can use Eclipse / Netbeans IDE for that.

Or you can cd to java folder inside tesseract's source code. Don't run 'cd
/java'. Run 'cd java' inside the tesseract code. Then running make will
solve your issue. I could see a folder named java inside '
https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/source/browse/#git', so your cloned
copy should also have it.

Hope this helps,
PrasannaKumar

1 Normally distributions have the software packaged. By packaging  we
normally mean these
Get source from original sources - normally called upstream.
Compile them.
While compile check for other software on which present one depends.
Create some default configuration like location of log files,
configuration files etc.,
Store the metadata about the software along with dependencies and some
brief information.
Put all of them into one or more deb file (rpm in case of rpm based
distributions)

When you apt-get install, the package manager gets the dependent
packages as well as this package, installs them and create default
configuration wherever necessary.

You can use dpkg -L package-name to get list of all files.

By the way you can do apt-get install if you are root. sudo is not
part of the command.

Too wide a topic. You will need to refine this further.

Sub topics would be packet filtering or firewalls, protocol based
filtering, content filtering which will cover a wide range of IDS/UTM/AV,
authentication frameworks for network applications, application firewalls
etc.

The apt-get or yum usage is for users of software. A distribution
packager maintainer will also use it for testing.

It depends on the distribution you use. Check your distro documentation.

If you enable the package source repo for your distribution, you can
also download the source packages (.src.rpm, for example).

| 3.Am I doing the entire process wrong ?
\--

Yes.

Since, you plan to work on enhancing the software, you need to use the
source code. If you are also the package maintainer for Tesseract for
your distribution, you can also work on packaging the same to a .deb
or .rpm file or whatever format the distribution uses.

Karthikeyan - instead of being nonchalant about it, why don't you return
this group a favour? We have put up with your top posting. Now it's your
turn to stop top posting and post as per the group's liking.

There is no point in alienating oneself,take being ignored as acceptance
and rubbing it in on top of it.

Also commenting on late KG was in bad taste. Can we see your cultured side?

Credit cards usually work. Did you try an instant electronic credit card
that can be used only online, by SBI?

PS: I have used a similar service from icici and i have a credit card.

Hi Kumar,

My suggestion is learn YII framework. It is easy to implement/use based on
our experience, it has lot of in-built tools/class. Please refer below link
for Frameworks comparison.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks#PHP_2

Following books/link will help you to learn YII framework for beginners who
already know PHP (OOPs):

1) The YII book: (by Larry Ullman -  Self Published)
2) Agile Web application - development with YII 1.1 and PHP 5 (Jeffrey
Winesett - Packtpub)
3) Official document from YII website - (
http://www.yiiframework.com/download/)

Thanks,
Dilip Kumar

No way I am putting bill gates above Kenneth, whatI mean to say was Bill
Gates doesn't like to see old ways die, like Windows on every computer. But
we at lugs like to have change. We must pioneer change. One of my friend
who heads a marketting company and uses linux widely has told me  that he
is afraid to post in this group because of the politics here. I see the
politics dying and I am happy about it. Once more young guys start ignoring
old rules and focus on posting about technology because they love it, the
old Soviet style guard will vanish.

I am reposting my views on the subject.

Sometimes see that even when a noob posts a genuine question we are
pedantic and first suggest top-posting instead of solution. Agreed,
there are guidelines but top-posting is not a heinous crime and we
should *care* about the OP's problem than worrying about such trivial
issues. if you go through threads in archive and see that we miss *no
opportunity* to advise folks on etiquette but really dont answer their
queries. Newbies would take it in right spirit when we provide answers
first then advice else may only get intimidated. Sometimes I wonder
whether some people pitch in ONLY to say don't top post as if that is
what OP wanted to know.

People would slowly learn pick the right way of communicating in
mailing lists. Am pure desktop user and have slowly learnt the jargons
and forum rules and now see the benefit of guidelines but for a noob
it could be discouraging. We should rate content over its form. If
someone is deliberately flouting / consistently doing that, thats a
different question altogether.

Also, why not advice just the sender instead of whole group?

The OP asked for a BI system. YII is a development framework!! The
connection is too tenuous to be useful.

To the OP: Pentaho is a popular BI system. I do not know if its PHP
based. Google would be your best bet.

Congratulations. You didn't top post. You did bottom posting, which is also not correct. Correct style is trimmed, interleaved.

What was the error from gparted?  When shrinking/expanding filesystems
+ partitions, it is best to use a Live Rescue CD.

Frankly I don't believe bottom posting will do much good. My Gmail lets me
top post by default and with my mobile its ( bottom posting)  time
consuming and almost impossible. Possibly splitting the this group into
ilugcd (ilugc - desktop) which enforces bottom posting, and ilugcp (ilugc
portable) which tolerates top posting might help. For me tech group should
be tech group rather than a rule enforcing center. Fun should be encouraged.

Well if one hadn't used Kenneth name as shield for his defense I wouldn't
have commented on it. If Kenneth was there and he opposed me and if I had
felt I am right, yes I would have battled him.

Honestly, I have been posting in various forums and two of the forums, both
from India, have annoyed me greatly, out of which, this one the most. To
make matters even worse both forums bear Chennai in its name. Strange!

This tech group earlier seen a lot of fun, which seems to be vanished now.

BTW, that time the rule was not enforced, but followed by everyone

Each forum has its own guidelines and for its own health it expects
its members to follow it. One can post a contrarian view but if thats
not accepted by the other members, you have to give in and play by the
rules. If its annoying to you, you are free to unsubscribe. Similar
behaviour got you kicked out of Chennai.rb. ILUGC has a larger heart.

And btw, belittling everyone else to 'reform' the forum so that it
exists only to entertain you is self-centered!

I fully agree with mano. Dear Karthick don't create issues. If you
don't like some guidelines, start a discussion on the merit/demerit of
the issue, which we willl debate and come to a conclusion.

Hi,

>>Well if one hadn't used Kenneth name as shield for his defense I wouldn't
have commented on it. If Kenneth was there and he opposed me and if I had
felt I am right, yes I would have battled him.

I have not used  Kenneth name as a shield, I recollected his contribution
and recollecting the list, how it was and how it is.
If you want to amendment to the guidelines do try a democratic way  rather
than flaunting  the guidelines.

Try to reading something in archive. Or rather scim through for some info
in the archive. You can understand why the guidelines are necessary.

Not sure the context as to why you would want to do this. Try this, perhaps?

Check the file vel.com
it seems no zone data is entered.

Check reverse.vel.com line 8.

compare the formats with

UPDATE kncet SET('20', 'Kavin','Female', 'KAvi at gmail.com','sdfsdg','8124455131'
WHERE name='Kavin')
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to
your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '('20',
'Kavin','Female', 'KAvi at gmail.com','sdfsdg','8124455131' WHERE name='Kavi'

$sql="UPDATE kncet SET id='$id', name='$name', sex='$sex', email='$email',
password='$password', mobile='$mobile' WHERE name='$name'";

Hi ,

First run the query in MySQL and then try with code.
-1  Check Query
-2 Check script

User echo and print_r() to see outputs.

echo
$sql="UPDATE kncet SET id='$id', name='$name', sex='$sex', email='$email',
password='$password', mobile='$mobile' WHERE name='$name'";

echo $sql; // check output with values.



With Thanks and Regards,
Kumar

First fix the above before targeting other error messages from BIND.
I suggest you get an understanding on how DNS works if you have not done so.

SOA, NS records are mandatory.

I believe the quality and quantity of information available at
stackoverflow and serverfault has made many a forums less relevant for
technical discussions. I guess the best use of LUGs today is evangelism,
networking and hand holding of newbies. Unfortunate to know that the
general feeling is that ILUGC has become newbie unfriendly for whatever
reasons.

But IMO the idea of the lug is to foster a community of open source /
linux enthusiasts in a particular
geographical area - rather than to just be a knowledge base.

Take the recent introduction of linux to a school that has been
discussed on this list. That's immensely positive work.

There is so much more work like this that can be done and I'm sure the
people on this list have the skills to do it.

Which DNS - there are several implementations?
BIND doc <https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-00845/0/BIND-9.9-Administrator-Reference-Manual-ARM.html>

Apache -- <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/>

This is a help forum and not personalized coaching site.   Ask

A few days ago, I upgraded LO to 4.3.2.2 (amd64) on Linux and Mac OS X.

In writer, while editing the doc with imported images (PNG), it looses
some of the images (random) and shows a box with "Read Error" in top
left corner.

After closing the doc and reopening it, all traces of that image is gone!

Seeing this problem on both Debian / Wheezy (amd64) as well OS X desktops.

Anyone else experiencing this anomalous behavior?

Search in any search with the error message.
You will get the answers, mostly.

If you search and did not get answers, then ask here.

I searched for you and got this link.

Nice.

> We planned to host the site as .org

.org is a Top Level Domain (TLD).  You will have to purchase a
subdomain; they cost about Rs.500/600/year and many domain registrars
provide basic hosting included in that cost.

This would be my recommendation e.g. www.<yourvillagename>.org :)

Strange.  I used keywords "free .org web hosting" and found quite a
few sites that provide free hosting for non profits, NGOs etc.

Please see above.  I'd rather you help yourself.

Greetings All,

I have to suggest my friend for creating a website for publishing of
journals and he is seeking a genuine advice in this matter. I dig into
google but not able to find a suitable web framework/template/theme which
helps him to create a decent journal publishing website.

I looked into wordpress/bootstrap to get an idea on the same but failed.

I might be wrong in my searching approach or keywords.

Can you guys help or navigate me to the apt link where at least I can get
an idea how to start with it?

Please advice.

Please use the right terminology. You are referring to crackers in this context.

Hackers are people who push technology to the forefront, and are eager
to solve challenging problems. Please read:

  2001: A Hacker's Odyssey:

The OP may try the Open-Access Plagiarism Search (OAPS) project from:

Also, please don't top-post.

You did not mentioned your requirement fully.

Why wordpress is not suitable for you?

What other CMS did you explore?
Why cant you use any of them?

If free is your choice, goto http://sites.google.com or http://github.io

If you want free and .org, then tell your friend to purchase .org domains
and point it to your servers for free.

Sir, I have visited this link also before posting my query on ILUG-C.
This didn't serve my purpose. Usually, I do my homework before disturbing
others.

Please suggest something else.
Thanks.

Sir, as I forgot to write that I don't have any professional experience in
core web field. I am familiar with Wordpress but couldn't locate any apt
Theme or Layout which may give an idea regarding that how a Journal
publishing website looks alike. Even I searched on google also and found
few on themeforest and on wordpress site. Few others are as:

http://www.academicjournals.org/

https://scirev.sc/journal/science/

https://thecustomizewindows.com/2014/06/wordpress-academic-journal-needed-plugins/
[[This one confused me. Does it guide us regarding plug-ins?]]

My hunting is still on. In the mean time if you know any decent journal
theme (prefer Wordpress) then please share.

I explored Twitter Bootstrap except Wordpress.

He wants it to be a good looking and professional webiste. So, may demand
more in future like (e-payment and other advance features). I have never
worked on advance features in wordpress and at present, I'm out from IT
domain for a while so I may not be able to put my time and efforts on this.
So, looking for a decent approach so that he can handle it with minimal
instructions. Please advise as according to it.

Thanks.

OJS is a very good journal publishing platform.  It has a built-in workflow
to manage your needs.
DSpace is used as a repository to manage artefacts of different types and
is not suited to publish journals.

Yes, gone through OJS and it's old as per reviews so may not be suitable
for future needs.
Checked DSpace and it seems like turnkey (repository).
Please suggest if you know any other tool.

What do you mean by "old" and what are your "future" needs?
AFAIK OJS is in active development and very much relevant to current needs.

Hi,

I thought I would drop a quick line to the list to let you guys know
about our beta releases going out today.

We're pleased to have reached beta for the main hamara i386 and x86_64
versions.

We're also releasing hamara-sugam beta - aimed at older intel hardware

and hamara arm core - currently we're shipping images for the cubietruck.

Would really appreciate any help anyone can give.

Feeback, testing, contribution, anything you want. We could really do
with a Tamil expert if anyone is willing?



Regards

When you claim one is better than another based on your tests, its
best practice to also reveal your test methodology and the test
results. Only then can others validate your claims.

I have trouble sniffing packets other than management with Alfa UQ2AWUS036H

Could you please point where am I going wrong ?  I don't want to use
Airmon-ng suite I want to issue the command using iw and capture it using
tcpdump.

Note:  I am testing my own network to learn more on WLAN, not to sniff
someone else network.

?Interesting! ?

There was something on the same lines as this a few years ago. Someone open
sourced their DNA[1]. There have been rather interesting forks[2] of it as
well.

Looking at the list, these are the things I see:

* Github gives you 5 free private repositories for your "top-secret"
projects. This is complemented by TravisCI builds on them.
* DigitalOcean can be used to deploy your applications.
* Email infra with SendGrid. I've personally used their transactional email
service and it is really nice
* SSL certificate from namecheap

Though, Its not about what you get from these individual services. It is
about the opportunity to experiment with a LOT of things that would
otherwise cost money to use.

Use this as an opportunity to try out the different services. Use
digitalocean's API in order to create droplets and deploy your applications
on them. Collaborate on a private project hosted on Github in the way that
large open source projects do (fork-pull request model). Create your
website and secure it with HTTPS (at least to an extent). Use sendgrid
transactional email to set up home automation via email.

The things you can do know no end. Just go out there and experiment :)

Hope it helps. Reach out in case you need any more help

All the best!

?Could you elaborate? I quite don't grasp the requirement of something like
this.

Because the way I see it, the database layer does different things when
compared to the web service layer. The purpose of the web service layer IMO
is one level of abstraction ?on top of the DB layer.

?On a side note, it is recommended to not put your query in a string and
execute it. It is a security concern. People can exploit this and execute
queries of _their_ choice on your DB. It is called as SQL Injection.

You can read more about it on the OWASP[1] site. Also here[2] is a way to
prevent SQL Injection in PHP.

Hi all,

While i've read and understand all the required guidelines for replying in
a mailing list (no top posting, not replying to digests, and basically the
whole thing here[1]), I am curious to know your workflow.

For eg. I subscribed using my gmail, and the reply button on gmail is
pretty darned crappy and puts you into top post mode. I need to select the
text in the email, remove the formatting, perform require edits, insert my
replies and send the mail

I've been a member of the PyCon India mailing list for a while now and have
followed this in all my mails but now i'm getting really bored of it.

Which brings me to think, am I doing something wrong? Is there some better
way of doing this other than having to edit EVERY email I want to reply to?
If there is, I'd love to learn.

Would clients like GNUS or Mutt make this easier? I've never tried them
out, I'm just curious.

Thanks,
Shrayas

It is called discipline. It is important before working with free and
open source software.

When you are part of a community, it is essential to follow the
terminology and guidelines that the group believes in. You can try to
be different, but, YMMV.

These have not been put forth by forefathers, but, have been
established as good practices in our circles.

?Hi,

Most definitely. I do understand this. I didn't intend to mean "bored" in
any offensive way. I'm sorry that I worded it that way. All I meant was
that it was getting redundant and I thought that I was doing something
wrong.

I do get it that these things fall under good practices and really respect
them. They ease out a lot of things like readability and searching through
archives.

Once again, Sorry if i offended anyone. I did not mean that the terminology
and guidelines were boring.

Regards,
Shrayas ?

setting "Reply-Style" as "Quoted" in evolution will make it easier to do
inter-leaved posts. I don't think trimming (by selecting unwanted text
and delete them) will take more time.

What types of apps we can develop for this. Should it be only Video
streaming apps or it can be anything in general.

Greetings,

I have used this immensely valuable resource multiple times when
switching from linux to solaris, aix and the such.

Well, I must humbly submit that my coding skills are, to overstate, rusty.

Can somebody who has sufficient exposure to various language give
their views about the following please?

http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code

http://www.lurklurk.org/rosetta.html

http://hyperpolyglot.org/

I request indulgence as I have not written much except few one off
bash scripts every now and then for a long time. Surely not project
driven. The last project driven was in c++ waaay back in 1993-94. and
some xbase, pl/sql during 1999-2004.

Hi,

I would really appreciate any input you people might be able to give to
this discussion.

We are looking for suggestions for a privacy package that would be either
- easy to install
- installed by default.

The discussion is here:

So far the suggestions (from me) are:

I think adding permission for packages like android will be a first step.
All package in repo can initially be enabled by default.

You mean showing what permissions/things the package has access to?

Hi there ,
I recently got to know about Indian version of GNU/Linux BOSS developed
under Indian government . I have few questions in this regard :
1. Where does BOSS stands as with other leading linux distros like Ubuntu ,
Fedora etc ?

2. How BOSS will benefit India and it's people , by having it's own
operating system?
I mean , will BOSS provide any specific advantage in any form which were
not there already from existing distros.

3. What all are the areas where BOSS is being used successfully already?

?No data in public , there are folks who are on this forum can answer that
better.?

?No idea.

as i said there are folks on this forum who can talk about BOSS , afaik you
are asking this from a point of view of an academic trying to teach , i
would recommend let students explore and decide on the distro of there
choice , once you know how to get around one distro and package management
in system , it really does not matter which distro you are using you can
figure out and learn quickly and be productive . I am in  Delhi this and
next week , let me know if you need any help .?

Showing the permission and allowing access to resources that is requested.
For example an email client need not have access to camera.

Message-ID: <CAP6xen=xMae+Aa5SfsE0ecUd5wRLf5k7aPH9K=J=cz3V2arD4A@mail.gmail.com>

Namaste Everyone,

As we all know about Flipkart's BigBillionDay sale and its consequences.
Last night, I was checking this link
<http://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/information-technology-case-study/the-tech-story-behind-flipkarts-big-billion-sale/44797175>
and
came to know that Flipkart deployed 4500 servers for the D-Day.

Now, can you guys explain me how was that possible? Does it mean that they
put their web code on 4500 servers? Is it really possible? If yes then how
or was there only single web code which was handling all requests?

But, I really appreciate Flipkart for taking up the initiative to handle or
organize such event. It was difficult for a Indian company to handle a
large pool of requests. Flipkart started a new chapter on web scalability.
#LessonLearnt (in technical way)

What are the factors which one should concern or pay attention while
focusing on such event regarding scalability or technical glitches? How can
we bring consistency to our web application like Google, FB, Twitter does
(they are handling zillion requests per second)?

I am not a web guy so curious to know about these questions. I was in
dilemma that how can I search this question on Google unless I would have
done that part before disturbing you all. BTW, there was a question on Quora
<https://www.quora.com/What-is-Flipkarts-Big-Billion-Day-Sales-Are-they-cheating-people-in-the-name-of-Big-Billion-Day-sales>
but they were discussing something else regarding the BigBillionDay sale.
#I didn't read all the quora answers.

May be I am asking this question out of lack of experience or ignorance
because I have not worked for any organization so far or not up to such a
large level where I got a chance to work on such a big project. Please
ignore my innocence for asking this question even if it sounds silly. I
hope WEB guys can guide me as well as others on this issue much better.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks.

My guess:

There was likely a hardware load balancer that distributed the
incoming requests to a bank of web servers. Each of these web servers
would have the code for the web layer (that builds the html) deployed
to each of them. To obtain the data needed for each request, a web
layer would add a request to a message queue, basically telling the
message queue to inform the web layer when its done fetching the data.
This is the easy part.

The complex part would be the database access layer. This will be a
bank of servers that consume the items on the message queue and talk
to the database servers to fetch the data. The biggest problem is
keeping the database servers in sync. In high traffic situations like
this, it is not possible without slowing down. So, instead of
expecting the databases to be in sync, they would've used logic in the
db access layer to track user sessions and to select the appropriate
db server that's being used for this session.

Thats a high level abstraction. They likely had many message queues
for each kind of activity eg, 1 for fetching the stock status, one for
fetching user's cart info, maybe even one for building the html from
all the data obtained and then send the final html (or json or xml
depending on the nature of the request) as response. I should've
probably named the 'web layer' as the orchestrator!! Its like the
'controller' in a Rails app.

Though I'm not on the devops side, I think 4500 servers is a medium
sized service! I might be wrong here. Some in devops could probably
throw more light on the 'magnitude' of the operations in comparison to
others!

Cheers,
mano

This relatively new talk should give some insight about DevOps and

?Scalability is a very nice concept to read on. At the same time, it is an
extremely hard concept to get right because of the sheer amount of
variables involved in it.

Here are some resources to get you started:
- Gramener on how they scaled visualisations during the election for CNN IBN
    Blog [1]
    Video at Fifth Elephant 2014 [2]
    Video at PyCon 2014? [3]
- Stackoverfow and its scale [4]
- Scaling reddit (2010) [5]
- Scaling reddit (2013) [6]. Personally I love this talk and learnt quite a
lot from it.

One of the conferences organized every year called rootconf (in India)
 basically tackles devops questions like such. You can have a look at their
videos too[7]?

Also, HighScalability[8]? is a great place to learn about scalability.

AWS + Chef Scripting for autoscaling
Redhat Openshift
Ubuntu Juju

Any of these cloud technologies actually make it pretty easy to achieve
a time limited 4500 web servers with storage, load balancing, database
layer etc.

OK - I understand.

Some work on apparmour with a profile for a desktop user and a gui might
do the trick.

I suppose if you use autoscaling then they will only be used if they are
actually required.

Perhaps they mean 4500 small instances?

I concur though - maybe mentioning "4500 servers" is just really good
marketing?

It does to me, but if your using cloud provisioning then you need to
work with the size of boxes that
they give you at a given price point?

?If i remember right, FK uses a combination of? homegrown servers and aws.
AWS provides pretty huge servers.

I dont know though, really looks like marketing to me.

Hi,

Just thought of sharing some information which i know about such
deployments.

Normally this kind of huge deployments would have multiple layers of server
for specific function
1) DNS server - holding details of lots of web load-balancer
2) Load Balancer - Static/dynamic details of lots of web server to load
balance the connection
3) Web server - Will mostly contain few static pages/dynamic part of the
web code
4) CDN - Holds most of the static contents and media files
5) Cache server cluster - Most important part of storage to reduce load on
DB servers by taking up all the reads.
6) Database servers - Typically handles only writes (saves the information
to retrieve in case of failure of cache nodes) and to serve reads that are
not available in cache cluster.
7) Application servers - They mostly hold the scripts that run as scheduled
jobs to cleanup carts, provide refund if stock not available, etc.

Flipkart is using the combination of cloud servers and real servers to
handle various loads and for better reliability and scalability.

They would also have dynamic scaling of new cloud instances to handle surge
in traffic.

They also ensure they have sufficient extra instance running all the time
to handle the load until new servers scaled boots up and fetches the
details and get ready to process requests.

Quite impressive. Thank you Lakshmi for sharing this.
After reading all what you've mentioned... first thought came into my mind
is that there is so much to learn. I do not know when will I get a chance
/opportunity to experience all these wonderful technologies.

I have few tools that I developed and put it in Public domain (GPL v3). I
assume, am the only user, since I wrote them to handle my needs. Some day
someone might find it useful for them, others may not discover it or find
it absurd.

I consider BOSS as one such project sponsored by Government of India under
CDAC.

While it is a good initiative to migrate government sectors from
proprietary to Free Software, creation of a new distro with an identity
(national or ethnic or whatever) is not a move that is necessary to achieve
the goal. In such cases, going along with already proven distribution that
is widely adopted will help to move forward.

Specific identity based products will not long last in India, since India
has its beauty in it's diversity. To take free software projects to these
diverse people, Localization is the key to go. When the most popular
Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora distributions have got the localization and
customization right, the option of which is available for the user right
from the installation step, I don't find the need for a new distribution
that sells just that point with identity.

I remember, once there was an Web browser called EPIC which is an fork of
Firefox. They customized it's theme, language with Indian flag, Indian
languages and created an identity as "Indian browser"
http://www.patheos.com/blogs/drishtikone/2012/03/epic-browser-the-amazing-indian-browser/.


Now when we look at their website, it tells us a different story of what
they are upto. https://www.epicbrowser.com/

Why would someone just leave their proven browser (Firefox or Chromium) to
use an new clone of the same which does what can be done on the original
version itself? I put an similar analogy for Free Software projects here.

can't able to install Photoshop is my first reason, then I can't able to

Please try to develop user friendly is like windows.

Free and open software is not just an operating but an ecosystem with a
bunch of software to enable different applications. Photoshop runs on
Windows and Mac alone. This restricts the OS choice. There age equivalent
software like GIMP that offer features like Photoshop but may not be as
strong on features. Thus, when you want to use open source,  you need to
look at the gamut of apps you want and try to figure out what going can use.

Have you tried the gnome-disks utility in Ubuntu?

After having used Linux now for 20 years, I find Windows impossible to use.
:-) There are user friendly distros like Mint etc which one could try.

Public domain software is not subject to copyright.

AFAIK, either GPL v2 / v3 doesn't fall under public domain.

You seem to be a Windows lover... Why to use Photoshop if we have GIMP. :)

If you learn how to access the partitions then its quite easy in Ubuntu
than Windows. Your problem is you didn't learn 'how to do'. Do it before
using anything and see the results. Don't draw your verdict on just these
simple things. Even I am using Ubuntu from a long time (might be 7-8years)
and never looked out for Windows for anything.

Kavin, change your perspective towards things and it will change
automatically.
Good Luck!

Adding my few cents to the discussion:

Well, a lot has been said above by my seniors so there is nothing more left
to say.

First of all, for every successful product we have to  analyze that to what
audience we are targeting. But security and privacy is that logic which
every user wants either knowingly or unknowingly.

But if the user is aware from latest snooping tactics then he may look out
for solutions. And, ?Whenever there is new technology that offers new
solutions people are bound to use it."

We can write a suggestion page on which we provide alternate solutions to
all major services which a layman uses for his day-to-day tasks and those
solutions provides end-to-end encryption.

I am writing down few tools which I encountered in my recent researches. I
am using some of these tools. Will surely share my experiences soon.

Skype replacement: Tox

Offline messaging app: Briar

Email client: MailPile

Another tool (not yet ready and completed to rock on the floor)
Crypto mail field is Scramble, encrypted webmail software coded by recent
Stanford University computer science graduate Daniel Posch.

A German company called Open-Xchange (uses PGP algo)
Tool name :  OX Guard
Using OX Guard, you can send an encrypted email to anyone?even if they
don?t use Open-Xchange

Another tool: Hushmail

Why can't we have a system which comes preloaded with all such encryption
tools and all these automatically executes during bootup process.
>From a layman perspective, he doesn't want to know what is happening behind
the curtain. All he is concerned about the performance of the artists and
show. We have to just aware the user and provide a best possible solution
and spread the word so that everyone can benefit from it.
This is all what I understood so far. In case if I am wrong at some point
then please correct me.
Share your experiences on this.
Thanks.

Hi everyone,

I know everyone is so busy testing and this message might be a bit late
but I was wondering if there is anyone who might have some extra free
time and would like to help? that would be so kind and nice as we need
more help for the last round before the final release:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOME/Testing

Sorry again but help and support are highly appreciated and needed :)

Happy Testing!

really bad for FOSS.

Bugs get reported and they get fixed. There is nothing shocking about
it. It is the way things work in F/OSS.

We at least know they are fixed, unlike proprietary systems.

Well said by Shakthi sir. As long as there are softwares there should be
bugs. But the main thing is they get reported and fixed and this is known

+1. That's the beauty of F/OSS (at least in my sense). Publicly exposed
vulnerabilities and publicly fixed so no need to fear.

Recently, there was similar news regarding Apple Yosemite OS issue and
other proprietary software companies and irony is no one came out publicly
and admit about these issues.

I love FOSS and understand all that is being said. I think it is
better in security than closed source. However, the stats shown in the
article are interesting and the opinion of security researchers seem
to suggest that there is no difference between closed source and open
source in terms of vulnerabilities.

This is not something that is expected. While fixes may come fast, the
more eyeballs proposition says that vulnerabilities will be caught
earlier and sooner as source is available for all to see. Soon/early
enough to avoid large scale impact.

Heartbleed and Shellshock have had a large impact across the board for
a lot of sites. I cannot deny that these two alone have cast a shadow
over these security assumptions in open source. SSL and Bash have been
around for ages and still these vulnerabilities took so long to
surface.

FOSS chest beating doesn't help the scenario.

Who cares? I don't use Microsoft so it's not my concern.

I use Linux, that's my concern.

It's naive to believe that FOSS is somehow magically safe because many
eyes can see the code.

Only if many eyes bother to look at the code, will they find the holes.

How difficult do you think it is for certain agencies to pay /exert
infulence on contributors to write in security holes?

In my view, these recent finds are the tip of the iceberg.

Either you accept that "all your machines are belong to us", whichever
OS you
are using, or you start auditing code.

I have a polish friend who is an OpenBSD contributor, he often makes
smug comments at me about the
fact that I run the Linux kernel on my machines. He often says "they're
are some funny things in there".

?It's not chest thumping at all. Bugs are found in all software - whether
free or proprietary. To write bug free code is not possible at all, what is
important is to make sure bugs are addressed promptly.

?But Open Source software is far more transparent in handling the security
issues and the patches are issued within days of a vulnerability being
discovered.

Exactly, assumptions like that are really bad for us if we want secure
systems.

The original poster said "at least we know when they are fixed". I'm
pretty sure MS and Apple write release notes with their
security fixes.

Agreed, this is for sure the no. 1 advantage we should all be pointing to.

The speed at which we we're able to patch against shell shock is worthy
of credit.

I'm of the opinion that FOSS is certainly better. Your statement about
MS does not give me added comfort with FOSS. I'm bothered about the
vulnerabilities and impact in the absolute sense in FOSS.

I've used FOSS for a long time and have managed a webfarm for 4 years
in the 90s. I've always marvelled at the fact that Linux machines were
simply rock solid, not hacked and a low overhead management platform
while MS machines were insecure and a nightmare. I've never before
encountered a serious vulnerability in Linux as Heartbleed/ shellshock
that shook the foundation of the platform stack used for web
applications itself.

I referred to ESR's thoughts/works like CatB as I believe in them
strongly (so much that I travelled to meet him for a chat at his
residence in Wayne PA in the 90s). Those premises failed in these
cases badly. Both SSL and Bash have been around for a long time, used
by many and were considered robust components. It was after a long
while that the enterprise segment believed in FOSS and adopted such
robust pieces.

That confidence has been pummelled by these incidents. The painstaking
gains made by FOSS in enterprise adoption would get eroded, whether we
like it or not. The sniggers will be back.

I posted this originally as I was concerned when I saw the statistics
quoted. This is what the commercial enterprise software vendors will
grab and use against FOSS. Luckily, most of them used SSL/TLS and so
cannot blow their own trumpets.

We will need to wait and watch how the scenario unfolds and affects FOSS.

You are missing the point.

What F/OSS claims is that the source code is available for anyone to
try out. Even if there are bugs, people can find it and fix it, and
anyone can *verify* the same.

Sadly, this isn't the case with proprietary systems.

Yes. This is the premise that also alludes that FOSS would mature
faster to being vulnerability free than a closed source product. The
caveat is that that must be a popular and often used software.

SSL and Bash satisfy both these criteria but still had serious
vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities leads me to think that a hybrid
model would possibly work better.

a) Develop fast, release fast and mature fast as proposed by ESR for
non-foundation software.
b) A more focussed QA by a dedicated team like what Theo practices for
OpenBSD for core platform components which also means feature
inclusion will be slow but measured.

OK - see what you mean. I concur, which is why I guess, I am actively
involved in building FOSS systems.

I have been thinking along very similar lines - but my approach so far has
been around creating a FOSS QA project that looks at other projects
independently.

I know google are doing something in this vain, but I am not sure they
are particularly
independent when it comes to government agencies.

Well Said, but still i saw in django also orm cannot be directly output as
webservice.

I have searched enough for this concept. Its better to create one for this
would help most of the people.

We have lot of GUI tools which will help to generate query.

So we can develop an app which has its own auth and websevice libs, user
can feed in query and export it as a service.

Hi all,

In linux, the init system is made of sysvinit to boot the os sysvinit is 
so simple and clean so that we can learn what it does.  But now some 
people come with new init system called systemd which is huge, bulk,

If it is choosen, Are people ready to fork with Debian ?

I was waiting for this conversation to popup here. There is *SO* much
ruckus going around the systemd/sysvinit issue. Seems like theres a loooot
of politics going around this.

Would be interesting to see the experts talk. I don't know much here.

IIRC, Prof. Srinivasan was @ CDAC Chennai (originally from NRCFOSS);
perhaps he could guide to the right person on the BOSS team.

Message-ID: <CADtvZWAjthVYt875j=XDyG8p8CXsiDc10ZSDWFco-MTjUbkJFg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

We are trying to identify the right approach to do Fail-Over and Load
Balancing in Linux server (Centos7), which contains Mariadb(mysql) and
web-server (nginx) with some services such as Video On Demand, Games, etc.
(streaming through Intranet, not Internet)

Please guide, to select the right technology/solution (Ofcource OpenSource)
to do so. Its seems complicated for me because of the dynamic data (eg: If
a user watching video and fail over happens, he should get seamless
streaming without interruption).

I have considered HA-Cluster (Heartbeat) for Failover and HA-Proxy for load
balancing, but still not sure, how to handle dynamic data fail over.

This might a bit late, for storage find an appliance solution and
catch the software/hardware vendor for utilities to fix.

PS - I have learnt this lesson the hard way - either you become close
to an expert on file systems when dealing with large storage or buy a
commercial solution with support.

More of a suggestion than help -- try xfs mailing list.  The XFS
experts might be able to help you.

I hope you have back ups of the critical files.

I would consider using heartbeat with a DNS round robin approach.

If you have a very low TTL for your DNS entry and a failover happens
your video
streaming should tolerate it.

Thanks Vikas.

Yes I am expecting very low TTL for our DNS entry, since its managed
locally, but this approach supports failover too ?

Yes - when you need to failover, you reconfigure the DNS entry to point 
to the new location.

If the TTL is low, the DNS change will propagate quickly - so requests 
will be directed to the new host.

Hello People,

While we still stick to the old and debate about top posting and same age
old things and live in the dead past, I have discovered a forum where there
seems to be nothing of those rules and talk of software and technology
prevails. Jump on to http://discuss.fsftn.org/

I am going to promote my favorite ruby programming there as Chennairb (ruby
group for chennai people) seems to have same politics too.

?Our youth now love luxury. They have bad manners, contempt for authority;
they show disrespect for their elders and love chatter in place of
exercise; they no longer rise when elders enter the room; they contradict
their parents, chatter before company; gobble up their food and tyrannize
their teachers.?
These words are generally attributed to Socrates -- though there is some
debate about the authenticity : whether the quote originated much later.

Anyway, the old vs young generation debate is continuous. Hope you will
accept, even if  you don't agree with, the youngster's inputs when you
become old(!), just as some if not many of us are trying to.

All the best in your new avenues and ventures.

Message-ID: <CAK2rq7zEeuwBnA8mRX1=CRKO42kzn3LByQaZy+XLwnC+MpEM+g@mail.gmail.com>

So I finally gave up my old Sony Ericson P1i mobile and got myself (*a
Diwali gift from my bro actually*) a Jolla mobile (purchased online
through Snapdeal)....

Below are my top of the mind, first cut remarks on the phone -

True to its tagline, Jolla mobile is really unique and has clear,
consistent, well-thought out design giving all focus on user
experience. Admittedly, has a steep learning curve and needs some time
to get accustomed to the gesture based design. Fortunately and
thankfully, there is a tutorial installed by default and helps in
trying out the different gestures. However, once you get used to it,
you can multi-task without any hassles. Once you learn the ropes,
every task is really a swipe / flick / pull away. At first, i felt it
is complicated but then realized it is just new and since my old phone
is neither Android / iPhone, there is nothing much to unlearn. A crude
analogy would be akin to learning to change gears in bike for first
time, the mechanism seems confusing but with little practice we can
ride the bike without any conscious effort.

So far, have been able to install few social applications like
Whatsapp (Mitakuuluu is native Sailifsh app), Twitter (Tweetian), IRC,
and few utilities etc and they're running well. It is built on Qt
technology, so we can see lot of Qt applications ported over time to
Sailfish. It also support Android applications although it may not
have same native experience as Sailfish / Jolla apps. It supports
*.rpm format for packaging and the ecosystem is growing with Jolla
apps. I beleive, given Linux background, any issues faced could be
resolved and there is a friendly and knowledgeable community to
support usage. To quote couple of instances, 1. Smiley support was
missing and installing an emoji font set from repo solved it and 2.
*.avi files did not play the video due to codec licensing issues
involved and installing *.rpm codec repo fixed it magically. Am sure,
expereinced users will have lot more to gain.

Hardware Specs are not exactly high end but it is not resource hungry
(at least native apps). No complaints on battery life. It has not
crashed yet.

This post is just to trigger some interest and will try to share an
elaborate review after some regular usage. Have been using only for
less than a week, so experience is limited and hence must be taken
with a pinch of salt.

In case you are hearing above Jolla for the first time, Sailfish OS is
built on top of linux kernel and developed by team in Finland. I
believe, these people were ex-nokia employees who left Nokia after its
marriage with MS and decision to stop development of MeeGo project.
Phone costs 16.5k and ist actually much cheaper in India than
elsewhere possibly due to the market size. Am sure, you can find more
details on the web. :-)

tl;dr - Jolla is a smart phone in very sense, it expects it users to
be really smart! ;-) :-D

systemd was started to parallelise running init scripts thus improving boot
time. Other options like JITing the init scripts or compiling them to
improve up the boot time could have been tried. I hope Debian as always
makes best choice possible. Even though I am using Ubuntu due to other
reasons I believe Debian is the best distro that makes sure freedom is
honoured always.

systemd controversy started way long before when it is in early stages.
I think, after a bit dull period, hate articles started coming again
when udev merged with systemd and RedHat announced that RHEL 7 will have
systemd as their default init system. There are lot of problems with
Systemd which are listed here,

http://boycottsystemd.org/

But, we have to admit that we don't have an answer to replace systemd
because most of the upper layer components (gnome environment) depends
on components which are swallowed by systemd (consolekit replaced by
systemd-loginctl, udev replaced by systemd-udevd, /var/log/messages
replaced by journald etc.,)

People started hating more and more because of the behaviour of the
developers, especially Lennart (you can see the reason in the
boycottsystemd link when someone have a broken journal and Lennart
started answering how to get rid of the broken journal instead of
inventigating why the journal broke)

I think it is Gnome's hard dependency of systemd and udev merge with
systemd resulted in systemd adoptation by many distros. If you carefully
see,

1. Kay Sievers is the developer of udev (Red Hat Employee)
2. Lennart Pottering is the developer of systemd (Red Hat Employee)
3. Most of the Gnome components are maintained/developed by Red Hat
Employees (I don't have any evidence, but whoever report bugs or
watching mailing-lists of gnome's components can very well understand
this point)

So, this looks like Red Hat is playing nasty games to dominate Linux's
Desktop market which got busted when debian decision to switch to
systemd and people started writing hate articles.

In my openion, if systemd would have created simple tools for each
systemd components (just like git) instead of merging everything in one
process, it would have been appreciated and adopted for its pure
technical merit. I hope uselessd (http://uselessd.darknedgy.net/) will
de-couple systemd's components and make it to follow the Unix
Philosophy.

Thanks,
Mohan R

Thanks. That will be great, to hear more views. I can probably bring to LUG meeting and show {off! ;)} to folks!

If anyone is looking for a new phone and willing to explore / experiment, this device would be  great choice. Btw, am not saying its not production ready but has lot to catch up with other mobile OS's, especially in terms of app ecosystem.

I've a N9 running maemo. Wonderful piece but no apps. Killing thing was no
sync with gmail contacts.

Does anyone have experience running Sailfish on N9? Would like to make it a
Jolla phone.

In our case we used DarwinStreaming Server(Streaming), HA-Proxy(Load
balancer), Keepalived(Fail Over) will do nice job for your requirement.

Topic

  Workflows with Tmux

Description
?:?

  Tmux, or Terminal MUltipleXer is a really sleek way to make your terminal
do
  a LOT more things that you thought it could. It manages windows and panes
like
  a BOSS.  I usually work on a bunch of things - some work related stuff,
some open
  source projects, some side projecty stuff, writing a blog post, etc. And
all
  these things require my screen to be in some format. One of the greatest
things
  about tmux is its ability to manage sessions. You can create a session
and make
  your splits in one fashion and when you are done with the work for that
point
  in time, you can detatch from that session and leave it right that way.
When
  you want to get back to it you can just pick up where you left off.

  The true power of Tmux however lies in applying this session management
when
  you are working on remote boxes. Imagine working at home on a remote box,
  closing your laptop, travelling to work and picking up *right* where you
left
  off. In addition, pair programming becomes an ease with Tmux. It is super
  simple and it just works. Thats the beauty behind it

  In this session, I will try to explain some of the concepts of Tmux that
I
  have learnt in the past few weeks of using Tmux (Note: I'm still a
beginner)
  and the way I use it. I will also demonstrate its power in remote
machines and
  how to use it to pair program.

  Don't have recordings of any previous talks. But you can find my previous

About Yourself
?:?

  My name is Shrayas. I previously worked at SAP Labs Bangalore and now I
work
  with my father at Logic Soft Pvt. Ltd. helping to explore new verticals
and
  do new things. I love open source and the whole idea behind F/OSS and have
  tried my best to contribute where ever I can to them. I do most of my
work in
  terminals with my trusty VIM and Tmux. I currently am exploring Python
and C#
  at work and side projects. Also I am slowly trying to use FP languages
like
  clojure and racket/scheme where ever I can (though I'm horrible at it :D)

  Otherwise, I am basically from the streets of Mylapore, Chennai. Did my
B.Sc
  from Loyola (any loyolites here?) and my MS during my tenure at SAP.

Namaste all,

My laptop (Core2Duo, 4GB RAM) is damn slow just because 'compiz' and 'Xorg'
are taking so much CPU %age (when I run 'top' command).

I moved to 'fluxbox' but it was so difficult for me to work on that. So,
reverted to Ubuntu unity desktop again.

Is there anyway to improve my CPU usage so that I can work efficiently? I
know, my laptop is quite old but for now I don't have nay other
alternative. Please guide me.

Thank you.

Compiz, unity and the like just slow the system down a lot. The purpose of
a desktop environment for me is really just to see the things I need to see
and nothing more.

For this reason, I always find myself falling back to Tiling window
managers like dwm[1] or i3[2]. These are the 2 i've used and I can tell you
they remove a LOT of clutter from the screen and allow you to totally
focus. You should try them out; i3 especially. ?

?Here is a nice talk on i3[3]? from the guy who made it. You can try out
things like awesomeWM or xmonad too, but i've never used them myself

I use i3 on a Intel Atom netbook and i've never really had any problem
except when I open a high performant website with firefox. Otherwise since
my work is majorly around terminals, it works like a charm.

Hope it helps. Cheers.

Xorg is needed, that is what provides the graphical environment. You
cannot do without it (yet).

Compiz generally puts strain on your resources, and all it does
additionally is provide fancy desktop effects. You can do without it
and greatly improve performance.

Big desktop environments like gnome, kde, unity try to provide desktop
effects, eye candy and high integration between system components.
These are to be avoided if you want "lightweight" system.

Tiling window managers are lightweight but they have a keyboard
oriented workflow and involve a learning curve. It is not suitable for
everyone.

Fluxbox, Openbox etc are window managers, and barely more than a
window manager. They are lightweight but don't provide integrated
desktop. You will need to configure a lot of thing manually.

You can try lightweight desktops such as XFCE or LXDE. Ubuntu has a
xfce edition named xubuntu, you can give that a try.

Yes, realized it when installed fluxbox. There is a learning curve for
sure.

Hi ILUGC,

Recently I learned about a new way of authenticating - with no passwords.
On every login, user gets a token a.k.a OTP via mail or SMS and stays
logged in forever.
http://passwordless.org/
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/10/passwordless-authentication-secure-simple-and-fast-to-deploy/
http://notes.xoxco.com/post/27999787765/is-it-time-for-password-less-login

I am planning to implement this in a mobile app using Codeigniter.

Has anyone used this. Any good web apps with such system. Any pitfalls
foreseen? Expert advice needed.

Staying logged in 'forever' dilutes the purpose of using authentication :-)

It is the 'second factor' in the 2 factor auth used for online credit
card transactions in India.

Pitfall is, anyone with access to your phone gets access to the
services that rely on this! If its mail, then you have to log in to
your email a/c to retreive this password - lil tedious. Every rose has
its thorns.

If your willing to help us test, you could consider hamara sugam:

I use lxde a bit and don't feel to lost when moving between that and other
heavier desktop environments.

MATE or Cinnamon can be used. It does not use huge resource and still
provides good features set. MATE may be better among the two. Give it a try.

http://tuxcoder.wordpress.com/2014/08/15/release-txt2unicode-converter-v4-0-velli/


code : https://github.com/arulalant/txt2unicode

It is merged with open-tamil library too.

https://github.com/arcturusannamalai/open-tamil

Currently it is a command line application and many non-tech people
feel tough to install and use it.

We need a web application with the following features.

1. one huge text area to get input text in any encoding
2. List of all 25 encodings available as option buttons to choose one.
3. A button with label "Convert to Unicode"

After pressing the button, the text should be converted into unicode
using the above mentioned python code/library.

4. The converted text should be displayed in another text area.

Example : http://www.suratha.com/reader.htm

This does the conversion using javascript.

We ported this into python and now we need a web front end for python backend.

Can anyone do this as a open source project?

Thanks.

Subject: [Ilugc] How to convert the fonts in Rich Text?
Message-ID: <CAND2794q5GiaB7uhEo0Uc5x2FkgKZ=yj_bzHK6FF7ujsavuZ1w@mail.gmail.com>

On working http://FreeTamilEbooks.com project, we get many books in
non-unicode text.

We are converting the text using open-tamil library.

https://github.com/arcturusannamalai/open-tamil
https://github.com/arulalant/txt2unicode

It is a python script and runs in terminal.
It can convert only the plain text.

The authors gives their works as MS word doc,
with lot of formatting like Bold/Italic/Tables/Headings etc.

We convert them to plain text and then convert to unicode.
Now, it becomes a tired job to reformat them all the text
as previous formatting.

Looking for ideas on how to convert the encoding with the rich text
without losing any formatting.

Share your thoughts.

Thanks.

I guess from MS word or from LibreOffice the file can be exported to html.
Try that option and see if it works.

I am not sure if any of our team can get the Chennai for that right now, 
but next time
we're in the area maybe we could come and put one together.

We're working on more DIY hardware like this - will post something else 
in the coming weeks.

Android is fragmentation, they don't give back.

Forking distros grows the community.

Or did I miss the wholesale adoption of Linux by the Indian consumer?
