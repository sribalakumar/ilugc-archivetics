Message-ID: <200207051345.AA3539984@mail.condoronline.com>

hai Luggies,

I have a problem in NFS.  There is no problem while configuring the server.

In /etc/exports file I have given all the information of the files which are to be shared with respective permissions.  Then I restarted the NFS and portmapper services.
 
While mounting the share in the Client 
mount server:/sharename   sharenameinclient
it reports an error RPC time out.

Why this error reported ?

Thanks in Advance,

Bathrinath Ra

Your server [rather it's NFS server port] is not acessible from the
client. Can you ping the server? If so check wether nfsd is running.

Hi,

    While poking around Google I found a link for an automated Kernel build
and installation script someone has written at
http://freshmeat.net/projects/ik/?topic_id=147

More details at http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue75/piszcz.html

The author claims that the script accurately determines the last bootloader
used to boot the current running kernel. However it detects only grub and lilo.
I looked at the script and the logic is -

1) If lilo config is present and grub config is absent then bootloader = lilo
2) If lilo config is absent and grub config is present then bootloader = grub
3) if lilo config is present and grub config is present then
            if "cat /proc/cmdline" contains the string "BOOT_IMAGE"
               then bootloader = lilo
               else bootloader = grub

Regards,
Moinak.

Hi Luggies,

I am using Red Hat 7.0.  I downloaded the grub rpm and installed it using the command

# rpm -ivh grub.rpm
# grub-install --root-directory=/boot /dev/hda

I rebooted the system and it prompted with grub>

root (hd0,0)
setup (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/hda1
boot 

There I gave these commands and it reported an Error

Kernel Panic :  No init found

How to solve this Error ?  Is the installation contains any error ?

Hi,

Great. /proc/cmdline does contain BOOT_IMAGE for lilo and not for GRUB.  
BTW, just for fun i did try this script and it works. This script
identifies either LILO or GRUB, nothing else. Load any of these loaders
and try this script (no need to reboot).

bhuvaneswaran.

Try experimenting with the TERM environment variable.
Setting it to "vt100" should get you started.

A nicer solution would be to use a better telnet client like Putty,
TeraTerm, etc.

Hi All!!

I have two disks hda and hdc and have swap partition in both of them.
The hdc disk is new and i would like to set a higher priority to use the
swap in this disk first. It is possible to configure such priorities for

I am most familiar with linuxconf for such system administrative jobs.

  Set the volume to maximum in your mixer. In general the volume is set to
70% by default. 

 I have found that in my PC the audibility in Linux is almost two times as
that of windows (in both OS all volume setting are at max ;-)

hi,

The ILUGC mailing list is now run using Mailman.  All subscribers
(digest and vacationed users included) should have received a welcome
message regarding this.

Our aero server was upgraded thanks to the efforts of Prof. Sriram.
Moving to Mailman was painless.  I've made sure that digested users
continue to remain in digest mode and also made sure that vacationed
users do not receive mail.  ILUGC is still a members only list so you
need to be subscribed to post to the list.

Mailman has a very nice web front end where you can change your
personal list settings.  You can check it out here:

         http://www.aero.iitm.ernet.in/mailman/listinfo/ilugc

ILUGC messages are also archived on aero.  The link for this is also
in the above page.

Suraj, could you please update the chennailug links to reflect these.
You could also use the above page to subscribe to ilugc.

Let me know (off list) if there are any problems.

cheers,
prabhu

This message is displayed on the client during the boot process or in the response to an explicit mount request. It indicated a problem with accessing the server. This error can occur due to the combination of incorrct Internet address and a correct host or node name in the hosts database file supporting the cleint node.
	This error can also occur whenever the hosts database file supporting the cleint is correctly specifying the server node, but the server node is extremely overloaded, is temporarily stopped, or has crashed

Solution to this being

If the server node is operational, determine if the server is out of critical resources viz, for example memory, swap or disk space

This is already done thats why the system boots with grub (ie in the mbr of
hda).  His root partition is /dev/hda5. So he needs to configure it in the
/boot/grub/menu.lst (or in the symlink /etc/grub.conf) to take the root
partition as /dev/hda5

It is something like

     kernel /boot/vmlinuz ro root=/dev/hda5

I think u need to patch the grub source with
(http://linuxfromscratch.org/~gerard/grub-0.91-vga16.patch)  then recompile
it. And also u need the splashimage. You will have to add a line like

splashimage=(hd0,0)/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz

in the menu.lst

Hi,

I just found this mail from one, Peters, from Dubai, in a Yahoo Group, that I am subscribed to(infotech-jobs@yahoogroups.com, to be exact). A novice guide install Linux - by a novice user. Thus the language is really simple and I guess a novice user will surely find this piece of guide an excellant one to start off.. installing linux on his/her PC.

PS:  Suraj can even consider posting this on the webpage ;-) :P

Mr. Peters,

Good Work Mr. Peter. Thanks for sharing your experience. I hope you wont mind me, posting your message to the Chennai Linux Users Group, India. Hope you enjoy your every bit of experience with GNU/Linux.

Subject: Windows & Linux - How to make them co-exist - A novices guide to installation -- by Peters A P

Windows & Linux - How to make them co-exist - A
novices guide to installation -- by Peters A P

Preface
I know many of you guys are experts in Linux. And
installing Linux must be a cakewalk for you, but for a
novice like me, I found it very difficult since I did
not know where to start from or what to do. So I
humbly request those Linux gurus to please excuse any
mistakes that I might have made while documenting
this. The main purpose of this document was to help
people like me -- beginners, to learn and install and
to make Linux & Windows co-exist. Thank you 

How I did it.
I remember I tried to install Linux way back in 1996 -
almost 6 years back, when Linux was just getting
prominence in India, but I got stuck up when the OS
could not detect the VGA card in the machine and I did
not have any resources or help to turn to and clarify
my problem and to continue with the installation. So
the simple solution was - forget about Linux and
install Windows.

I completely forgot about the existence of this OS
till I came to UAE in search of a job (an elusive
thing which I am still searching), my cousin Joseph
John offhandedly was talking about Linux, for which I
did not give much attention, because of my previous
experience. So every time we had a conversation he
used to talk about Linux and its reliability. He also
mentioned about the Linux Users Group in the Middle
East. After much coaxing and cajoling and instigating,
I joined the mailing list and subsequently I attended
my first meeting. 

All this time an interest developed inside me to learn
more about Linux, so I managed to get a copy of SUSE
Linux LiveEval from John and brought it home and tried
to install it in my brothers PC, but then I noticed
one thing that I did not know how to install Linux on
top of Windows ME which was existing in the system.
Again I was stuck, I thought that my Linux
installation for the second time is also going to be
unsuccessful, anyway with all the courage I inserted
the CD into the system and booted. The system came up
with SUSE Linux installation and something was going
on and it asked for some passwords and user names etc
etc, which I gave and then it said the installation
was complete. Thank god -- I thought, I have installed
Linux, so I removed the CD and restarted the machine
on the hope that Linux will come up, but to my dismay
it booted Windows ME and showed no signs of Linux. I
searched the hard disk drive and found that there were
two very large Linux files written on it. I could not
figure out what that was. Anyway I kept quiet about my
bungle of not being able to install Linux.

At the next LUG meeting I mentioned this, and few of
the members told me that SUSE Linux LiveEval does not
install in the system, it just creates a ROM image on
the HDD and to power up Linux you should insert the CD
every time. So now I knew what was wrong in my
installation and a few members suggested to install
Red Hat Linux.

So armed with my determination to install Linux I
asked John to give me the copy of Red Hat Linux he
had. But again the problem of making Windows and Linux
co-exist was there (since I did not know about it). So
with Johns advice and my determination, I backed up
all of my data to a CD from the computer and formatted
the CD and partitioned and installed Linux and then
formatted and partitioned and then installed Windows --
I was confused, I was not able to get the correct
process of partitioning and installation, Each time I
install Linux, Windows cannot be installed, when
windows was installed I cannot find the partition for
Linux, when I find both I cannot install Linux. John
gave me advice through telephone, I confused myself,
this confusion and complication went on till 5.00 AM
and I was exhausted and tired and went of to sleep…..

The next day dawned and when I saw the unfinished
installation, I got more determined, I called up
Ganesh another LUG -- Middle East member. With his
telephonic support, I was able to install Linux and
Windows ME.

You must be wondering why I did not follow manuals or
installation guides, I tried that, but that was too
much of technicalities. Also please understand that I
am one among the millions of people who do not know
Linux, but want to learn it.

The First Attempt
Here is what I did with help from Ganesh

Things Required
- Windows 98 bootable CD
- PC Quest Red Hat Linux 7.1 installation CD
- Computer System (of course), I used a PIII 550
system with 128 MB RAM, 40 GB HDD, S3 Virge Graphics
Card, CD-ROM drive

First I backed up the data -- my Word documents, Excel
Sheets, my websites etc

I booted up my system with Win98 bootable, with the
option "Boot from CD" and then " Start Computer with
CD ROM"

After booting up, at the prompt give "FDISK"

Now since I wanted Windows and Linux, I needed a small
partition to hold my Windows, so at FDSK, I created a
Primary DOS partition of 1 GB. I set this partition
active.

I did not create any other partition -- my HDD was 13
GB, the remaining part was not partitioned.

I restarted the computer and booted up again by my CD
ROM with "Boot from CD" option and then "Start Windows
98 setup from CD-ROM"

Now it started installing Windows 98. Once Windows 98
was installed, (I upgraded to ME that instance itself)
I restarted the system.

This time I had the PC Quest Linux CD in the CD ROM
drive. Linux installation started, I used graphical
install option. After selection, country, Keyboard and
Mouse, I came to the option of Partition. Here I used
the option of "Manually partition using Disk Druid"

Here you can see two screens split horizontally, top
screen shows two partitions and the bottom screen
shows the percentage of space used. You can find that
both the partitions are FAT32 partitions. One
partition has 1 GB and the other partition had roughly
12 GB

Blah blah blah.. and then the hard disk crashed --
it was almost 3 years old and my Linux Installation
got stuck.

The Second Attempt
So I was pondering as to what to do next, no amount of
coaxing and cajoling with my system would not bring
back my system to life, so I decided the only
alternative, to purchase a new HDD. With the new 40
GB hard disk installed in my system, I started the
entire process again, this time I did not need to take
backup, sine my hard disk was new and I had already
backed up my data earlier. 

But still I insist, backup your data

I booted up my system with Win98 bootable, with the
option "Boot from CD" and then " Start Computer with
CD ROM"

After booting up, at the prompt give "FDISK"

Now since I wanted Windows and Linux, I needed a small
partition to hold my Windows, so at FDSK, I created a
Primary DOS partition of 1 GB. I set this partition
active.

I did not create any other partition -- my HDD now 40
GB, the remaining part was not partitioned.

I restarted the computer and booted up again by my CD
ROM with "Boot from CD" option and then "Start Windows
98 setup from CD-ROM"

Now it started installing Windows 98. Once Windows 98
was installed, (I upgraded to ME that instance itself)
I restarted the system.

This time I had the PC Quest Linux CD in the CD ROM
drive. Linux installation started, I used graphical
install option. After selection, country, Keyboard and
Mouse, I came to the option of Partition. Here I used
the option of "Manually partition using Disk Druid"

Here you can see two screens split horizontally, top
screen shows two partitions and the bottom screen
shows the percentage of space used. 

On the top screen you can find something like this 
MountPoint Device Requested Actual Type
<not set> hda1 1004M 1004M WIN95 FAT32

This is where you add your Linux partitions, you will
be able to see an ADD button, click on that and create
a Linux Swap of 1.5 times the size of your RAM
Since everything is graphical, I presume you will be
able to ADD partitions with the following
specifications.



MountPoint Device Requested Actual Type
<not set> hda1 1004M 1004M WIN95 FAT32
/ hda2 1600M 1600M linux native
/usr hda5 2000M 2000M Linux native
/home hda6 2000M 2000M Linux native
/var hda7 2000M 2000M linux Native
/opt hda8 1000M 1004M Linux Native
/tmp hda9 1000M 1004M Linux Native
/usr/local hda10 500M 502M Linux naïve
<swap> hda11 192M 196M Linux Swap
hda12 1M 26850M Dos 16-Bit>=32M

Please note here that you do not do anything to hda1
as this is your Windows partition, apart from that,
using Disk Druid option partition the Hard Disk as
mentioned above.
Also your Linux Swap partition should be 1.5 times
your RAM
When all the Linux partitions are over, use the
remaining space to create hda12, this will be your D
Drive under Windows.
Your partitions need not necessarily be as above,
since I had a 40 GB Hard Disk I used the above space
allocations. You can set your own space allocation 


Choose partitions to format
- Select all -- I mean check marked all of them

Firewall Configuration
Please choose security level -- Medium
And then use default firewall rules

Language Selection
Choose the default language -- English USA

Time Zone Selection
Select -- Asia/Dubai
UTC Offset -- Choose the default

Account configuration
Root Password ---- "whatever you choose"
Confirm ----- "whatever you choose"

Account Name ----- "whatever you choose"
Password ----- "whatever you choose"
Confirm Password ----- "whatever you choose"
Full Name ----- "whatever you choose"

And then Click add
Package group selection

Since I was installing a server version -- I check
marked all the items

X Configuration
Just read through -- it asks about your Graphics Card,
it is better to know the name of th card before your
installation plus the amount of RAM n ur graphic card.
Else by default it probes your card and shows you the
option 

Monitor Configuration
By default again it probes for the monitor and you can
select that if you wish to or change it.

Customize Graphics Configuration
Again play around and choose the settings, which suit
you best

Now to quote Microsoft windows installation "Sit back
and relax for the next 12 minutes while Linux is
installed in your system"

Boot disk creation
I ignored that -- since I could not find a good floppy
around at 3.00 am

Congratulations, installation is complete -- click exit
-- I felt a sigh of relief - I did it !!!!

After clicking on exit your CD ROM is ejected and the
system restarts.

Once the system restarts you will find the familiar
Linux penguin with two options -- Linux and Dos, move
your arrow keys and select whichever operating system
you want to go to.

Now the question remains, I installed my Windows in 1
GB, where will I install my programs, if I install one
or two Windows programs my 1 GB will be filled. The
answer to that is simple, when the system restarts,
choose the DOS option. Here Windows will start up,
once Windows is loaded, click on My Computer, you will
see your C drive and D Drive, you must be wondering
where the D drive came from, remember while we were
partitioning using Disk Druid for Linux we had created
a DOS 16 >=32M, yes that is the D Drive, Now it is
simple, format that D Drive and it becomes ready to
use.

Conclusion
I am not sure to what extend it helped you guys out
there, but I would be honored to get your comments,
reviews, suggestions to improve to help Linux grow.
Some of the technical terms I used might not be
correct, please correct me wherever I am wrong, or was
wrong during installation.
One thing about which I am happy is that now I have
Linux and Windows running side by side and can select
whichever option I want.
Now the next step is to learn the complete operation
of Linux, I hope I can count on many of you guys out
there for support.
I wish to thank specially Joseph John
(saji_jjk@hotmail.com) and Ganesh
(ganesh_net@hotmail.com) for their help.

Thanks

hi

    well firstly i got to give my thanks for fixing
the sound card problem in mandrake which i posted
earlier this week.

    well now i would like to know something about
multiboot. the mandrake has a multiboot loader, if i
install another OS like win2000 pro the MBR would be
replaced. is there any way of outsmarting the win2000
loader??? 
   well i'll be loading XOSL as suggested by someone.
with XOSL loaded if i decide to load another OS
sometime later will i have to load XOSL again.

thanks in advance

Try

cpio --extract --make-directories < file.cpio

Anyone knows where cpio is generally used instead of tar? (Apart from
rpm2cpio)?

If you can't win the game, change the rules of the game.

You must have been in dodo land if you are by now not up in arms against
Microsoft's Palladium initiative. Or maybe you are just the lame computer
user that Microsoft encounters the majority of the time. But I hope you are
a wise ally who will fight for the right to own your own life.

If you respect your right to live in a free world, prepare to combat the
dark forces. This is a threat to my way of life and possibly yours. This
could also mean the end of free computing as we know it. If you think I'm
sounding hyperbolic, you haven't yet had an opportunity to comprehend the
implication of Palladium on freedom.

I wrote about this last month:
<http://chaoszone.blogspot.com/?/2002_06_01_chaoszone_archive.html#78348035>
:

PD> easy to get people to upgrade as it was, say, in 1996. *And

PD> Two: especially after the Hailstorm fiasco, MS' ability to push
PD> through even a de- facto standard is at an all-time low.

More (this is a digest+ from my weblog :-)):

* Palladium is based on TCPA, and the TCPA spec provides for TCPA to
  be switched off. Expect that to happen wholesale on home computers.

* Palladium will have to ship 100 million before it even _begins_ to
  start to make a difference.
  cf: Google cache: <http://makeashorterlink.com/?Y52312431>

* A pure Windows dependency on Palladium would invite antitrust
  allegations all over again.

* Nothing stops Caldera or Redhat from producing a TCPA-compliant
  Linux desktop and distributing it _with source_.
  TCPA != security through obscurity. Of course, if the PC is your
  work PC, then the source would go to the rabid dogs ^[2bd$ fine
  gentlemen in your MIS department, and you may not have r00t privs
  on your box :)

* If TCPA is a necessity to ``get office work done at home'', AND
  this cuts into -ah- leisure activities, then expect massive uptake
  of TCPA-compliant Linux/etc (with TCPA switched _off_, you have that
  right, if you're root) and dual-boot systems as people use that for
  their misc p2p/ripping tasks ;-)

* Palladium is likely to be, at best, nothing more than a carrot to
  msft's corporate/government customers who are sick and tired of
  `untrustworthy' desktops -- it would appeal to the control freaks in
  charge of IS departments (almost?) everywhere.  At worst, it is
  likely to be vaporware.

* The most interesting thing about Palladium, in fact, is that msft
  holds a (very broad) patent on secured-from-boot-up, palladium-style
  PCs. If MS insists on steep royalties on each Palladium PC sold,
  expect Joe MIS-er's enthusiasm for trustworthiness to fall
  dramatically.

Bottom-line, keep your eyes open, but for heaven's sake don't foam at
the mouth at every picturesque project name that comes out of Redmond.

Look up DNS howto in http://www.tldp.org. If you could be more specific
on what you intend to do, it would be easier to respond. For such a
small network, it would be better to resolve of /etc/hosts locally.
Manageable. Just make a startup script to copy a /etc/hosts file from a
central location for every bootup thus making change in one location
propogate. In case you have an internet gateway, then you can set up the
DNS as a caching only DNS with resolv.conf configured to look up your
ISP's DNS hosts. Set up the gateway machine's IP as the DNS IP on all
your Windows PCs and in resolv.conf as the DNS look up in resolv.conf
for every Linux PC.

Message-ID: <005a01c2259c$3e282760$9501010b@lan>

Hi

I noticed that the new ilugc mailman archives very helpfully
have the posters' full email address (with link) in the
archive pages. See, for example, 
<http://www.aero.iitm.ernet.in/pipermail/ilugc/2002-July/000033.html>

In this day and age, that's like an open invite to spammers saying
``come spam me!''.

I'm sure mailman had an option to munge/hide email addresses ..
could the listadmin please look into this? Any comments from
people familiar with mailman?

Cheers

I'm not so sure about that but I'll take your word for it.

I looked at this issue before we moved to mailman but found no obvious
solution.

    PD> Any comments from people familiar with mailman?

I searched on google and came up with a couple of interesting threads:

http://mail.python.org/pipermail-21/mailman-developers/2002-February/010589.html

http://mail.python.org/pipermail-21/mailman-developers/2002-February/010739.html

Its a huge thread that does not seem to lead to any solid answers.  I
blew atleast 45 mins searching for one and have real work to do.

So for now we have the following choices:

 1. stop using pipermail to archive and be happy with the yahoo
 archives.  I can do that pretty easily.

 2. Find a solution to this problem and let me know.
        
 3. Live with it.

Hi,

 cpio -i < cpiofile
or
  cpio -i --file=cpiofile

if you want to interactively rename files  
   cpio -ir <cpiofile

Specific files
   cpio -i filename <cpiofile  
use ' ' for substitutions like * , ? around filename

To just list contents
  
    cpio -t <cpiofile

CPIO is pretty powerful when combined with find
like
find / -mtime -1 -print|cpio -o>/dev/fd0

 It is  very useful for incremental backup.With sed or
awk we can do backup effectively in a large setup.

Also it can continue on another device when full 
i.e multiple floppies or tapes, even combination of 
them.

It can accept files to be copied from stdin. 
Thus if we create a file say f1 containing filenames
found under different directories, using cpio we can
create
an archive of all these files. 

cpio -o >archivefile <f1

I've RH 7.3. I bought new DLINK cards. Earlier Dlink cards had the
realtek chipsets and were getting discovered by kudzu - not any longer
as DLINK seems to have changed the chipset. I'm , however, able to
configure on commandline using ifconfig and modprobe.

I'm not able to configure a third ethernet card - eth2. Though I've not
gone beyond 2 cards earlier, I did not anticipate this problem. Ifconfig
comes out with an error if eth2 is being configured.

Has this been faced earlier? Any solutions/ pointers etc?

I downloaded oracle 9i for linux, which is in cpio format.  I initially had
problems in extracting those.  Later from Basker's solution i got those
files extracted.  But still i'm having some basic doubts on cpio formats and
its difference with tar.

Oops, Palladium != TCPA, but *is similar to* TCPA.

On the other hand, the similarity extends far enough:
alternative OSes will be able to run on a Palladium PC,
largely since the extra, Palladium functionality can be
ignored. Also, most OSes should be able to enable the
Palladium featureset if they so choose.

Seth Schoen has a pretty good page on the subject here,
this is possibly the best coverage I have seen from someone
not under a NDA:

I think it would be better to use IITM instead of ad-infested
YahooGroups (maybe use that as a backup). What I'll try to do
is figure out a way to get Mailman to discard the hostname part
of the email address in public archives.

can you pls wrap your mails at ~80 chars per line? It is very difficult
to read/reply to your mails.

  You wanted to setup email for internal use? In that case there is a file 
  /usr/lib/sendmail-cf/cf/redhat.mc which needs to be modified according to
  your  requirements. After change do
  m4 redhat.mc > your_setup.cf. copy this to /etc/sendmail.cf and restart the
  service. You also enable pop3 or imap. If you are using RH6.2 uncomment
   the line which begins with pop. If it is latest the file will be in 
/etc/xinetd.d/ directory. change the line which says disable = yes to disable 
= no then only Outlook will be able to work.
   to test whether they are working or not
   telnet ip 25
    for sendmail
   telnet ip 110
   for pop3

Thanks!  One way to do it might be to simply run a script thru the
archives that drops the hostname part.  If its a hassle for you to do
I'll look at the mailman archiver code and see if there is an easy
solution but no guarantees on the time frame.

Mailman delivers the mail pretty much the same way it was sent.  So if
someone decided to send it as HTML, thats the way it will be
delivered.  Similarly with attachments etc.  Listar used to decrypt
mime attachments and HTML and send them in as text.  Mailman does not
do that.

I'm completely at a loss to understand why you still try with Red Hat
6.2 when 7.3 is released! :) RH 7.3 must ship with very recent
versions of various programs including the X server and its very
likely that your card will work with 7.3.

If you are looking for 7.3 CD's I'm very sure you can get a copy from
someone on the list.

Hi!,

The mailman web management thing Obscures mail so I thought we could use
that function in the archiver as well so....

I did this to Mailman/Archiver/pipermail.py, added

from Mailman import Utils

And used this in class Article on line 178 as

ObscureEmail = Utils.ObscureEmail
self.author, self.email = ObscureEmail(message.getaddr('From'), for_text=1)

 The In-Reply-To header thingy also requires fixing. I'm guessing line 206,
has to become

 self.in_reply_to = ObscureEmail(strip_separators(match.group(1)),
for_text=1)

But I have an uneasy feeling about that...must be the warning given above
that....All this was on Mailman-2.0.12. This was just what I got after
30mins of code reading so it's bound to be wrong, specially since I am not a
python programmer, forgive me and hope this helps.

Regards
Samuel

Thanks very much!  No need to apologize!  I just tried changing this
but dont have write access on the mailman dir.  I'm not root so I'll
fix that ASAP (tommorow).

I should have grokked the sources myself but I'm trying to be careful
with my time these days.

I'll also try to see if I can fix the existing email addresses too.

I've a HP Brio with RH 7.3. It has SiS6250 which is recognized by kudzu.
I'm able to set it to 1024x768. However, in the window mode alone, two
horizontal lines appear along with the mouse i.e in the desktop mode,
graphics is clean. If I open an app, then this problem occurs.

Any fixes?

I think I'll use a perl one liner and edit all the HTML files
(in-place) in the archives with this:

$ perl -i -pe "s/(\w*)(@|%40)(\w*)/\1.at.\3/g" *.html

I'm not a perl hacker so fixes/suggestions are welcome.

To test this just grab one of the archive pages and run it through
this script all occurences of email addresses should hopefully be
munged.

Comments?

I'd like to suggest a slightly different regex, similar to
the YahooGroups one. The rationale is that anyone using the
web archives is not likely to need the email address, and
those wishing to publicize their address can continue doing
so using the <foo at bar dot tld> notation.

Cheers
--PD


$ perl -i -pe "s/(\w*)(@|%40)((\w|\.)*)/\1\@\.\.\./g" *.html

Here's a test suite:
jdoe@abcnet
jdoe@ee.foo.ac.in
jdoe@web.foo.info
<a href="mailto:foo@bar.com">foo@bar.com</a>
foo@localhost
foo@.bad.addr
foo@com.in-addr.arpa
John.Doe@devnull.int
John_Doe@foo.com
jdoe+sitename@foo.com

When processed this turns to:

jdoe@...
jdoe@...
jdoe@...
<a href="mailto:foo@...">foo@...</a>
foo@...
foo@...
foo@...-addr.arpa
John.Doe@...
John_Doe@...

I beg to differ on this.  I find the yahoo archiving painful when I
need to reply or write to the person who has posted.  With the yahoo
way there is absolutely no way for a non-member (or an occasional
reader) to figure out the address.  I have personally needed to do
this once or twice (and this is perfectly justifiable use).

I admit that a spammer has no chance with the yahoo approach but if we
were to replace: 

joe_user@some.domain.com with joe_user at some.domain.com

I think we get a reasonable compromise where a reader can figure out
the mail address and yet automated spam bots will have difficulty
getting the address.

What do you folks think?

You could use popen.  Under Python look at the os module and read the

Any unix machine should also have similar functions available.  You'd
need to include stdio.h and read the man pages.

Hi All,

I got a .gz file, on trying to extract it using gunzip, I'm facing a problem
stating the file is not compressed using gzip.  I just done onething, after
downloading that file in windows environment, I double clicked the file,
since the file is associated with Winzip program, it openend winzip, but i
cancelled the operation.  Does this trouble the .gz file?  Is there anyway
to retrieve that file?  Any Suggestions?

Thanks in advance

You'll probably need to scedule a script or a program for each minute. 
The script or program will have to maintain its own scedule for launching
jobs within the minute.  You must have guessed this by now :)

Hi Manohar,

Did U try doing a `file <filename>` on the file - that will tell you
if the file is wrongly named.

I am not sure why your file is giving a problem. Anyway as you have told if
you are able to open the file in Winzip and convert it to tar . you could do
that and then ftp the tar file to the *nix machine 

Just chk the mode you are using for transfering using FTP 

Cheers

In that case use cpio to unarchive it!!!

sorry - can't help with syntax :-)

Possible to do? Yes but do we want to do it?  Maybe not.  There are
pro's and cons to both approaches.

http://www.unicom.com/pw/reply-to-harmful.html

http://www.metasystema.org/essays/reply-to-useful.mhtml

The other issue is do we allow non-subscriber posts?  The plus is that
this makes life easier for the admin, makes it easy for folks to post
(no need for separate vacation accounts etc.).  The minus is that it
allows for spam (somewhat -- implicit destination emails still require
approval and so do administrivia requests).  Non-subscribers can post
random messages too.

BTW If you look at the archives (posts after the meet info update one)
the obscure email option (as suggested by Samuel) is working.  It
seems to work pretty okay and the default approach is to replace @
with ' at '.  If you have objections to this approach and definitely
want to remove all trace of the hostname please raise objections now.
I will wait till tommorow before I run the perl script.

Try  CUT command

   use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter.

  Ping using ICMP protocol. You have enable the
  ICMP in your firewall rules. I am not familiar
  with ipchains commands :(
  man ping & icmp may help u for getting more info

Most probably the ping reply ICMP is disabled in the firewall. Check
that out.

Try  CUT command
-d or --delimiter=DELIM
   use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter.

Hi!

If the host name thing is a problem beacuse of spam...most spam bots easily
work over the "at" trick we could do something like this

"""Email Obscrewer..."""
rightemail="foo@foo.foo"
[obsname, obsdomain] = string.split(rightemail, '@')
jsmail="javascript:user='" + obsname + "';server='" + obsdomain +
"';theemail='mailto:' + user + '@' + server;window.location=theemail;";

this will put something like this in the archive
<a href="javascript:user='foo';server='foo.foo';theemail='mailto:' + user +
'@' + server;window.location=theemail;";>

This works in Galeon/Mozzila/Konq/IE....You could prolly make it smaller,
but I though ppl without JS might find this a bit easier to parse...It would
take a very clever bot to harvest this.

Regards
Samuel

PS: Prabhu if you want a patched archiver, only HyperArch.py need to be
modified, mail me.

Agree. This is indeed pretty acceptable. The incidence of
`x at y' is high enough for harvesters to get a sufficient
amount of noise with their `harvest'. Although if I was
writing a harvester (god forbid) I'd look for `w at x.y.z' :).

   encrypt passwords = yes

All the other things I took it as default values.  

2.  cat /etc/passwd | sh /usr/bin/mksmbpasswd.sh > /etc/samba/smbpasswd
3.  smbpasswd username
4.  testparm    =====>>>> No Error Reported
5.  samba restart

But I didnt get the Samba icon in my windows box.  

An Error in /var/log/samba/smb.log

Hi all,
    Thanx for the efforts.
 
    But, What I want is, to read the text file as a whole into a single variable declared
in Makefile. The internal seperator does not matter.

Ex:
   The text file is : txt1.txt and contains,
                        
                      RegInfo.txt:RegError.jsp:
   I want to read the entire file into a variable in the Makefile something
   like this,

   TXTFILE < txt1.txt ( Iyo i'm not getting the syntax )

 TIA,

[as solution to ping not working on firewalled machine]

this may work, but is rather broad. presumably, the machine is firewalled 
for a reason. this essentially removes icmp from all the firewalling 
rules. if someone could point at the icmp ping 'port', the above command 
can be modified to open only that 'port' by using an appropriate -s (or 
--destination-port) option.

hi
 i dont think ping is associated with any port like echo(port 7).
 ping uses ICMP which operates at n/w layer and port number creeps in 
 only at the tranport layer,so --dport option cannot be used to allow ping
 another  reason for ping not working is

 probly 
 /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all 
 is set to 1
 echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all
 will be fruitful
 
 happy tweaking

Subject: [Ilugc] Regarding Password
Message-ID: <004701c2281f$69ee0920$54e7c7cb@den>

Sometime back someone was asking for the password for the access database
file in telephone directory cd. The password for the same is '14m1973'. I
think that is the birthday of the programmer. The database is encrypted with
some technique. If someone succeed the same please tell me how you did the
same.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] code to crash NT & cousins.
Message-ID: <200207091613.VAA04110@WS0005.indiatimes.com>

Hi! LUG,

I've been watching this list for quite sometime. But could'nt contribute because most of the threads are about administration.

This url came up in the openwatcom newsgroup. Guess what, its an NT bug !.  Thought I could post this to make luggers happy. Here's the url:

http://homepages.tesco.net./~J.deBoynePollard/FGA/csrss-backspace-bug.html

And here's a short program u can use it to reproduce the bug:

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/*
 * sample code to "hang" Windows NT !
 * based on the report given in <url>
 * this bug may be present in recent incarnations 
 * as well !
 */

#include <stdio.h>

int main ()
{
	for(;;)
	{
		printf ("\t\t\b\b\b\b\b\b");
	}
        // dead code
        return 0;
}

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

This code is well tested under Windows 2000 ;-)

There is nothing more satisfying for a lugger than seeing a M$ O$ crash :-)

On the other day, someone was asking about SIS6215c driver support in XFree86. Well, support is there 
in the code. But a small "hack" is needed to get it working. The 6215c cards use the PCI device id 204.
But the code in XFree86 looks for  201, 202, 203 and 205. So either you can change the device id for an existing chipset (do this if you are lazy) or add the proper #defines for 6215c (this is the proper way to do this.) I've been using this for the past 3 years and its working very well. If you're too lazy to build your own server then contact me by private mail.

Sorry for being so long.

cheers,
Krishnakumar,
Salem.

Where does ports come into picture in ICMP protocol (network layer)

ICMP packets should be firewalled based on the message they carry,
to see the list of ICMP messages try
# ipchains -h ICMP

for ping to be disabled ICMP echo message has to be blocked,.

Blocking other ICMP messages will lead to serious network
performance degradation, 
and I guess that any good sysadmin wont do that

hi all,

i dont know why no one seems to see the ' mark around my port keyword. as 
far as ipchains is concerned, the icmp type/code is used similar (but not 
same as) the port argument. of course, my --destination-port is wrong, it 
should be --icmp-type foo.

   Hi,
     I can't pinpoint the problem but my experiance is following. There is a 
file in samba docs/textdocs directory DIAGNOSIS.txt which is useful and
going step by step is one way of trying to solve problem. It looks the
number of open files limit are exhausted. There is a way to set by putting
an entry in proc file system to increse the number of opened files. Google
search may help you how to do this.

I've done that to the current archive.  However there are two more
issues.  From the archives page you can get all the email addresses
via the full archive download link (this is an mbox file).
Alternatively, you can get it from the downloadable text version.
Currently mailman does not put obscured email addresses here.

I'm not sure that spam bots download every file on the internet to
harvest addresses.  That way they'd eventually have to download
everything!  It also appears that other mailing lists do the same
thing (i.e. leave the text downloads with unobscured email addresses).

The only way to clean the text archives also is to run a cron job that
fixes them with the perl script.  I'm not sure this is worth it.

Comments?

so, the problem has to be elsewhere. maybe, there is no homes section in 
the smb.conf file? a minimal one might be something like this (reproduced 
from my smb.conf file).

BEEP is actually pretty interesting and very clean design,
but, like DIME, has an issue: the existing infrastructure
(HTTP (for BEEP) and MIME (for DIME)) are so ingrained, it's
hard to get people to shift. Witness how TLS has languished
vis-a-vis SSL for years -- inspite of TLS being _nearly_
compatible.

Most people don't give a damn that we're somehow
'overloading' HTTP far too much for our own good. Firewall
vendors don't see the overloading of HTTP as a problem, they
see it as an opportunity to sell (relatively more expensive)
application-level firewalls.

I wouldn't expect BEEP to get a lot of uptake anytime soon.
Pity :(

Cheers

Hi,

I would like to run my iSCSI pseudo-HBA driver program on a
SMP machine. But my driver doesn't support SMP. Is there any
way by which I can disable all the processors but one in the
SMP machine dynamically and run my program, as if it is running
on a UP machine?

( Statically disabling the SMP support in the kernel config file
   and recompiling the kernel is one way. Any clues on
    how to achieve it dynamically?)

Regards,
Sastry

A bunch of guys coming in from Romania (81.18.x.x) have been trying to
deploy rootkits into machines. Chaps have a host called
rootkits.netfirms.com and barty.netfirms.com and they deploy custom ssh
clients and email uis/pwds to massrootz@yahoo.com.

Looks like hack is thro' buffer overflow on openssh or DNS. Openssh3.4
is the way to go.

What happens?
These guys set your mails to low priority and spawn sendmail processes
with oem switch and specify root as sender thro' -F switch. Files
affected are ps, ifconfig, inetd, tcpd, top etc which hide their
processes. Their own ssh is running as a process called xsf (clever as
can be mistaken for xfs) Their files sit in /var/spool/at/spool/wu3. End
objective - send out porn mailers using servers that do not belong to
them.

I've been trailing them. If any one has some more news, let me know.

Not sure about the default Mandrake 8.1 install. 

1. If your kernel has IP forwarding/ IP Masquerading enabled and you set up a 
suitable firewall, you can share internet connection from a Linux server. 

Check the following URL for details on how to find out whether your default 
kernel has been compiled suitably and how to set up your Linux machine to 
share internet connection:

http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO/

2. You can also install apache and set up your system as a webserver. Your 
Mandrake CDs will have the necessary rpms to install apache.

For what kernel version?

There are some patches to enable CPU hotswap on/off,
but they aren't integrated into any released kernel yet.
They are being changed very much, but should end up in Linux 2.5
fairly soon, but I don't really recommend using this just yet.
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/lhcs/

I don't know of any other dynamic CPU on/off tools.
For now, I think that you are better off with static
CPU control.

A slightly more dynamic way is the kernel boot parameter maxcpus=1 .

If I remember correctly, there is another  kernel command line parameter "nosmp" which you can pass to 
achieve this.
 
nosmp           [SMP] Tells an SMP kernel to act as a UP kernel

Hi,
http://www.mysql.com/ has a (downloadable and searchable) doccumentation.
You can make use of that.
Also, ORielly has a book published on 'MySQL and mSQL' by George Reasee
et al, which is fairly good (and quite cheap).
A couple of other books avaiable have already mentiioned in another post
by someone else.

HTH,
Binil

Actually, I has problems booting into linux (RH 7.0)(thro boot disk) after installing, which i solved by typing "linux root=/dev/hda6" at boot prompt. Now, lilo is installed in the boot sector of the first HD (Win2000). It is booting and working properly and all, except i get this error while trying to make a boot floppy. HELP!!!

hi

in recent redhat versions the fstab file looks
something like this
<dump>
LABEL=/                 /                       ext3    defaults       
1 1
LABEL=/boot             /boot                   ext3    defaults       
1 2
none                    /dev/pts                devpts  gid=5,mode=620 
0 0
LABEL=/home             /home                   ext3    defaults       
1 2
</dump>
i think  mkbootdisk is not comfortable with *LABEL=/* entry 
try changing it to
/dev/hdXX / fstype defaults 1 1

happy hacking

	Bastille Linux isn't really a distro by itself. It is a set of tools
which you can run on your system to "harden" it and make it more secure.


	I would recommend a Debian Stable system as far secure systems go and
maybe "Bastillizing" it would really help too :-)

1. You do not need a DNS. You only need to be able to resolve names thus
resolv.conf needs to be good.
2. Can you ping an external IP from the Linux machine? I guess not as
Analog is a proxy but does not do NAT (atleast when I used it last. Do
they now?)

I would suggest you make the Linux machine the mail and proxy server.
SQUID will give you far better controls than what Analog does. Configure
pppd with demand option to dial on demand.

You will have to authenticate with your yahoo ID and password, to use POP
mail. 

BTW, I remember that yahoo has made POP mail a premium service.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the seventh revision of Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (codename `potato')
which mainly adds security updates to the stable release, along with a
few corrections of serious bugs.  Those who frequently update from
security.debian.org won't have to update many packages.

Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
`apt' package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to one of
Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors.  A comprehensive list of mirrors is
available at:

    <http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist>


Security Updates
----------------

This revision adds the following security updates to the stable release.
The Security Team has already released an advisory for each of these
updates.

Miscellaneous Bugfixes
----------------------

This revision adds important corrections to the following packages.
Most of them don't affect the security of the system, but may affect
data integrity.

    byacc           Fix timestamps in .deb file
    custom          Fix timestamps in .deb file

As mentioned Yahoo! POP services are no longer free. Yahoo! SMTP services by
extension I guess are also not free. So, for receiving your emails via
whatever MUA you could try fetchyahoo instead of fetchmail and use the SMTP
server provided by your ISP if you can't run your own MTA.

<quote>
FetchYahoo is a Perl script that downloads mail from a Yahoo! webmail
account to a local mail spool, an mbox file, or to procmail. It is meant to
replace fetchmail for people using Yahoo! mail since Yahoo!'s POP and email
forwarding services are no longer free. It includes all parts and
attachments within the email. It can also forward the email to a specified
address.

I'm not familiar with kmail, but if it is one of those MUAs which does not
use the *nix mailbox format a la Netscape, whatever I've said may not be of
too much help.

It is true that yahoo has removed its free pop access.  But, pop service has
not yet been disabled in yahoo.co.uk servers (may be they have forgotten!).
It has been disabled in yahoo.com and yahoo.co.in servers.  Both SMTP and
POP service works with Outlook Express (windows).  I feel that there is some
option somewhere in kmail which can be used to authenticate.  The problem is
I am not able to find that option anywhere in the menus.

I believe the ATI Rage family is well supported.  A few points to
note:

  1. Make sure you are using Xfree86 4.x.  Avoid the older 3.3.x
  version.

  2. Wipe out your older XFree86 server related packages (including
  the config files) and re-install them.

  3. I usually let debconf handle the configuration and it does a
  fairly good job.

Hello Friends,

I have developed a web based application using postgresql and php. I do not 
have a programming background. It consists of 

--- user registration, login and management
--- a simple discussion forum
--- member management for companies
--- order management for companies

The work has been done by in-experienced programmers in the beginning and by 
me for the past two months. I need some PHP GURU to sit with me and review 
the code. The review should include, the directory layout, functions 
handling, session management, security and bugs. Knowledge of Postgresql will 
be very useful, to do the database part.

If anybody is interested, please contact me offlist quoting your rates.

hi
 
installing oracle8i needs lots of tweaks 2 be done.
u need 2 add a line to ur /etc/sysctl.conf
u calculate "ramsize in MB * 1024 * 1024 /2 "
now add the following line to sysctl.conf
kernel.shmmax = "result_of_ur_calculation"
//it shud read something like kernel.shmmax = nnnnnnnnnn;
and as root ,run
sysctl -p

or 


echo "result_of_ur_calculation" > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax

try running ./runInstaller

hope this works!
happy hacking

The Linux way would be a  machine running Samba +  netatalk + NFS.

The commercial solution involves a properitary product called Helios.
You can get more information about this at http://www.helios.com

But there is no reason to go for the commercial product unless, you are 
want somebody who can hold your hand.

kmail supports unix mbox format.
The lates version which comes with
KDE3 supports both mbox and maildir
formats.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0207160912560.1365-100000@Bhuvan.bksys.co.in>

Hi,

As we know $MAILPATH environment variable in bash can be used to intimate
the user on new mail arrival and it is useful when the mails are received
in the same machine.

Short Description:

Here we have seperate mailserver for our incoming mails. But users
normally work in mainserver. Both are linux servers.

My doubt is, Is it possible to set the $MAILPATH variable in mainserver to
intimate whenever a new mail is arrived in mailserver? Or is there any
other way?

Long Description:

Something like, 

Normally we have an entry something like or similar to
  export MAILPATH=/var/spool/mail/$USER?hi $USER, you have new mail.
in /etc/bashrc

Should we able to change this entry to
 export MAILPATH=mailserver:/var/spool/mail/$USER?hi $USER, you have
new mail.

??

Valuable suggestions are very welcome.

I configured the X server using xf86config and I provided all the inputs and selected the driver file from the database and still I'm getting smaller resolution. I tried to setup res. to 1024*768 but its not working. I need help on this.

Are you talking about RedHat Linux 6.2? There's no such thing called
Linux 6.2. The latest version of the stable linux (2.4.x) tree is 2.4.18
and the latest version of the unstable 2.5.x tree is 2.5.25 and the (now
historic) 2.2.x series has 2.2.21 as its latest kernel.

Nice to know that you used xf86config... (-: generally I've seen ppl on
Redhat use only Xconfigurator. If you have the monitor's manual you
should prolly try giving the correct Vsync/HSync frequencies. Also
there's this nice 'Xfree86-Video-Timings-HOWTO' that you can read.

Subject: [Ilugc] filesystems ro
Message-ID: <20020716055451.37560.qmail@web8102.in.yahoo.com>

I want to install a system and freeze it by making all
the file systems read-only. I guess not all
directories can be made read-only. The system will be
used as a DNS and hence no mail or any other daemon/
program would be user based/ associated writing data.

I think the /var/log and /tmp directories need to be
rw. Is there any other directory that should be rw?
How do I make the rest ro at the file system level
itself without assigning directory permissions as
0444? Any ideas?

I was thinking of making /var and /tmp as separate
partitions in rw mode and turn all other partitions ro
in fstab. Am I right? have I missed out something?

Cool Penguin.

netstat is your friend. netstat -lnp will show you whats going on. -l is 
for ports open for listening, -n will show numeric (port number instead of 
port service name) and p will show the name of the process that is 
listening on that port.

netstat will show you current ports being used. lsof also shows socket
in hex. Maybe you need to find out how to decode the output.

you can check by using lsof to look at what are all the open files.

by using the mount option ro in fstab. the fourth field of the fstab file 
contains the mounting options. it is usually default; you can change the 
default to ro (or, if there are other options there already, just add ro 
to the options; hopefully, ro wont conflict with the other options). to 
try to see if things will work, you can remount the partitions read only 
on the running system by doing 

mount -o remount,ro /dev/blah /usr

if this command fails, that is an indication that something is open for 
writing on that partition.

i believe you are on the right track. i have a bunch of systems (including 
this list mail server) where /usr is mounted readonly.

Device level ro locks are a better option though more restrictive. You
would need to burn a CD everytime a config needs to be changed. Maybe
config files can be maintained on ro-tabbed floppies which can be made
writable, config files changed and tabbed back to ro.

You need to have rsync on both the local and remote systems.  Plus you
need either rsh or preferably ssh on both machines installed and
working properly.

hi
 you can  use a portscanner like nmap on the host of interest

 try giving the  following command 

 #nmap <hostname_or_ip_of the host>
it will show the open ports and services running on that port

happy hacking

Message-ID: <20020716085914.4982.qmail@web14608.mail.yahoo.com>

Dear Luggies

I am having Windows XP and Redhat 7.3 in my box with
128 MB RAM. I planning to add another 128 MB. Now the
swap partition size is 256 MB.  Somebody had suggested
swap partition twice the RAM size is not necessary in
all situation. Should I increase the swap partition?
If so how to do it without doing reinstallation.
Thanks in advance.

If u get connection refused, then rsyncd is not starting, perhaps in
/etc/xinetd.d/rsync file u need to edit enable it by saying disable as no

U can use the rsync daemon to do the transfer. U will require to create
/etc/rsyncd.conf on the remote machine.

################### start of /etc/rsyncd.conf #############
Example of /etc/rsyncd.conf is
[test1]
path = /tmp/backup
read only = FALSE

############ end of /etc/rsyncd.conf ######################

After doing that create restart xinetd by

/etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd restart

Following example will sync /home/foo on local machine to /tmp/backup on
remote machine.

rsync -avz /home/foo/ linux107::test1/backup

NOTE: test1 is not a directory in the server, also note use of "::" in the
destination path.

for more info RTFM.

Hi all,

Thanks for the inputs. I am able to run it now.
But now there is one more problem. 
I gave the "auth users= " and "secrets file= " options in the
rsyncd.conf file.
Now when I am running rsync, evenif I am giving the correct password, it
is giving error that authentication failed.

And one more problem, for some files it is giving the error "chroot
failed ".

Thanks in Advance,
Thanu

Subject: [Ilugc] make doubt
Message-ID: <1026824273.55e64ff8kameshj@myrealbox.com>

Hi all,
I have a project directory structure like this
dependent
	|
	|--->dependent.c
	|--->Makefile
	|--->independent(directory)
		|
		|--->independent.c
		|--->Makefile
The Makefile under the top directory "dependent" is like this
----Makefile starts here---
.PHONY: independent clean
dependent: dependent.c independent
  gcc -o dependent dependent.c
independent:
  cd independent && $(MAKE)
clean:
  rm dependent
----Makefile ends here---

The problem is,
For the module("named independent") sources that are up to date with the targets,make says "target is uptodate".This scenario is fine.

For the module("named dependent") sources ,make compile every time i make it even though they are up to date with the targets.This scenario is not fine.

How to make it to compile only upon change in the sources not every time in the second case.
with regards
kamesh jayachandran

The example I gave worked when I ran rsync as root, so the chroot option
wouldn't have failed for me. In ur case u may need to check whether u will
have proper permissions on the remote m/c. For rest of problems u may need
to experiment.

You could try mounting the other server's user mail directory on NFS and
give that as the directory in the variable. I've not tried but this is
an idea that struck me as being feasible.

Subject: [Ilugc] Using $MAILPATH variable across machines


Hi,

As we know $MAILPATH environment variable in bash can be used to
intimate the user on new mail arrival and it is useful when the mails
are received in the same machine.

Short Description:

Here we have seperate mailserver for our incoming mails. But users
normally work in mainserver. Both are linux servers.

My doubt is, Is it possible to set the $MAILPATH variable in mainserver
to intimate whenever a new mail is arrived in mailserver? Or is there
any other way?

Long Description:

Something like, 

Normally we have an entry something like or similar to
  export MAILPATH=/var/spool/mail/$USER?hi $USER, you have new mail. in
/etc/bashrc

Should we able to change this entry to
 export MAILPATH=mailserver:/var/spool/mail/$USER?hi $USER, you have new
mail.

??

Valuable suggestions are very welcome.

Hi,
    I don't know any thing like programming in Linux. C, C++ 
    compilers default with most distributions. But they can
    be installed on any Unix, Windows OS also. Perl, Python,
    TCL/TK are cross platform scripting tools. Shell programming
    is there for Unix like platforms. May be Linux specific is
    GTK and Qt are linux specific to some extent.
    What do you wanted to do with Linux? If you specify that
    then one can advise what to do. I don't think there is anything
    called Linux programming in general (OK Linux programming
    for me is Linux kernel programming).

regards,
Sambaiah Kilaru

 What are you talking? Unless you develop your own kernel
 however small it may be it is still called Linux.

The only thing I can think of is the Makefile file in "independent"
modifies dependent.c; What's in that Makefile?

All's well that ends.

Hi,
Let me restate my problem.
I have 2 modules module1 and module2 in 2 different directories.
I have individual makefiles for both of them.
If I run the make in those individual directories.I am able to see it making the targets only upon change in dependencies of those targets.Off course it is the desired behaviour.
But when I call Makefile of module2 from the Makefile of module1 like, 
module1: module2
	gcc -o module1 module1.c
module2:
	cd dll && $(MAKE)

It makes module1 everytime but not module2(as there is no change in its dependents) even though there is no change in the dependency list of both module's targets.
with regards
kamesh jayachandran

hi,

thanx for the replies. i'm sorry that my question was mistaken - i 
didn't ask if we chop linux's size down, we can rename it into 
something else (sorry kilaru, if that mail had hurt u). i was 
asking about the smallest possible size of a woking linux KERNEL. 
i was asking about how much any of u have managed to reduce the 
size before the kernel no longer WORKED.

about tomsrtbt, yes i use it regularly too. (btw, saravanan, u r a 
fan of the Lua language? plz mail me if yes). but i'm not 
enquiring about any distribution.

with all 'extra' features removed
( like networking :-) )
and with only support for keyboard and virtual terminals, i got a 
kernel size of 360KB (on kernel compilation). i didn't change any 
code. linux is certainly more scalable than this - if any of u 
have managed to reduce the SIZE OF THE KERNEL below this 360KB, 
plz reply me.

if i haven't made myself clear, plz bear with me and mail me. i'll 
explain in more detail.

anyone out there changed kernel code for some reason 
successfully?

regards,
kiruba

Hi
 i think the prob is in ".PHONY " .This is what O'Reilly's Introduction to make suggests 

> If a phony target is included as a prerequisite for >another target, it will be run every time that other >target is required. Phony targets are never up-to->date.

In one of the documents, I read that I need to enable MD5 passwords
and shadow passwords during installation.

Is there any way to enable them after installation?

Hi all,
I have a GVC external 33.6 modem, with RH 7.0. Configured modem with the RH PPP? tool, it detected the modem and everthing was okay till the time i tried to dial up my ISP. It was giving the error "Unable to detect the dial tone..Redialling", this goes on and on, and it never makes the connection. 

what am i doing wrong? Is there some settings that should be included in wvdial.conf?

cheers,

Hi,

Check out www.demolinux.org. The idea is cool. Just pop in the CD, and
boot your machine off the CD. You have linux booting up with a cool GUI 
with no hassles (only a few questions reg. keyboard layout and display).

The best way to wake up those dozing off on windoze ;-)

Hi,
   
  i know there are a number of linux distributions
developed, which are small from tomsrtbt to the huge
suse or RH. i would like to know all the various
distributions which are available for the users. These
distributions can be GUI based,just kernal based or
anything which runs linux. 

If possible briefly mention the pros and cons of each
one also.  

plz omit mentioning distributions like Suse, RH &
Mandrake.

thank u,

hi ,

I use redhat linux 7.3 (2.4.18-3) .
I had compiled a kernel for 2.4.18-3 .
While i boot using this kernel it says 

<message-begin>
   modprobe: Can't locate module char-major-81
</message-begin>

On googling i came to know that this module is related with bttv(v4l) .
But i haven't enabled this option while configuring my kernel .

What i have to do to disable this warning message ?

help me out .
TIA.
uday.

created a demolinux CD with tamil GUI interface so that people can try
linux with tamil lang. interface off the CD.

infact, we at ILUG - HYD was given a demo about BBC-LNX, the business
card linux and every one who attended the december, 2001 meet was
presented with a sample cd as well.

the cd is compressed and is only 48 mb or something. and it looks like a
visiting card and fits into your wallet.
check it out at

Hi there,


	It looks like your modem doesn't really recognize the dialtone
correctly even though it exists :-)


	To circumvent this problem, put in a ATX0 in your init string which I
think goes into your wvdial.conf.


	Hope that helps,


			Ravi

	You forgot the password you mean ? You could try the single user mode
thing, change the password and then do what you have to.

	Yes, run 'setup' and choose 'Authentication Configuration'

In my Windoze wxperience, I've had to switch off detect dialtone in most
modems for it to work. Look up equivalent in Linux and guess it should
work.

Hi all,
I have a GVC external 33.6 modem, with RH 7.0. Configured modem with the
RH PPP? tool, it detected the modem and everthing was okay till the time
i tried to dial up my ISP. It was giving the error "Unable to detect the
dial tone..Redialling", this goes on and on, and it never makes the
connection.

what am i doing wrong? Is there some settings that should be included in
wvdial.conf?

cheers,

Hi - I think you should put X3 in the modem init string settings. Remember,
if there is X4 in that string change that to X3. That should fix the
problem.
There are various other settings possible with the ATXx command set.
You will find the reference in your modem manual AT command set.

Bobby

Hi,
  Well 1.14 load is bad but it is not that bad. We need some more output to 
get clear picture. Why don't you try to send output of ps with options and 
check with
top also. May be log files will tell much. /var/log/messages and 
/var/log/httpd/error_log and other files in httpd will tell lot about problem
of the system. Check any console error message about hard disk.

These are some grain of salt advises. It is very difficult to advise with out
any of the above to give advise.

Sam

It actually depends, There is more to system load than just the numbers

and yes, updatedb is worse when you have your CDROM devices, etc.,

Hi!!

i have this php program which writes to a file using fopen(). its works fine
in my windows box and linux box(when i change the file permissions)...
but when i uploaded the file into a linux server and tried to write into a
file which is located in the server, it's showing the error,permission
denied. i tried to change the permission using chmod(), in php. Even that
returned "Operation not permitted". Is there any way that i can change the
file permissions using a php program rather than contacting the server
administrator.

thnx in advance,
R.Karthick

1) man chmod on a linux box or

http://www.google.com/search?q=man+chmod

2) Understand it

3) Conenct via FTP or telnet or SSH or what you will to your Linux box

4) use the chmod command to set the appropriate permissions. (644 should do)

5) Your fopen() will now work

Using chmod via PHP will not work because that too will require that you
have write permission on the file, the very reason why your fopen() was
failing in the first place.

If you are hosted on a half decent box, even if only with a web interface to
upload files, it should provide a way for you to change permissions. Any
sysadmin would die of exhaustion + boredom if he kept getting calls from his
clients to set perms on files.

 1. If already installed in ur system
      u have start SSH during machine start up
      use ntsysv command as root.

 2. If missed to install it during setup
      Take the 7.3 CD in the RPM folder search for
      the openSSH rpm and install it using
    
      rpm -ivh openssh*

      [ read man rpm for more info ] and to the step (1)
 
Bye :)

Subject: [Ilugc] Sybase Ct_connect() error
Message-ID: <200207220728.MAA09361@WS0005.indiatimes.com>

Hi there,

  I am using Sybase ASE [ rpm ] for linux.
  
  After I configure sybase it is working for about 
  few [1 or 2 ]day(s) and after that the following 
  problem occurs

  CT-LIBRARY error:

  ct_connect():  network packet layer: internal net 
  library error: Net-Lib protocol driver call to 
  connect two end points failed.
  
  The above mentioned error occurs when i give this 
  command isql -U sa -S <mydatabase>

  I have also created different user and gave it as
  isql -U abc -S <myabcdatabase>
  but the same ct_conncet() error occurs.

  During the installation process by default it 
  showed as  www but i have changed it as 
  www.myname.com.

  I doubt whether this might be a problem.

  Is there any body can help me on this issue.

  Thanks in Advance.

  Best Regards,
 Hemanth Kumer L

After following Prabhu's advice, I still could not manage to get X up
and running.  After intensive google searching, I finally found an
answer to this question.  

The card does not work out the box with even recent versions of X,
specifically the version that is included in Woody (some 4.x stuff).
However, it only needs a little tweaking of the XF86Config file by
hand.  Specifically, the following two lines of code need to be
present in the "Device" section:

driver "r128"
ChipID 0x5246

And everything works like a charm :)

cheers,

Subject: [Ilugc] How to increase maximum execution time in php
Message-ID: <013f01c231bf$226f4fb0$870110ac@samsi>

Hello All,

When i run a php file in command line i get the following error

[root@exp isps]# /usr/bin/php -q exp.php
<br>
<b>Fatal error</b>:  Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in
<b>exp.php</b> on line <b>190</b><br>
[root@exp isps]#


I have edited php.ini as
max_execution_time = 300

i still get same error.

How to increase maximum execution time ? Do i need to restart anything ?

Regards
Sathyan

I was hoping there would be a followup discussion
about 'market penetration' of browsers and available
browsers in Linux.  Instead, 'Viagra' becomes the focus.
Geeez.....

For stronger penetration of the browser market
and just better hits than misses naming the browsers
'ViaGratis' or 'ViaGarcia' may be more 
appropriate than 'Mozilla' 'Fudzilla' etc.,

Viagra always works for me but I can't say the same
for the available browsers in Linux! 
But, I can live with that. Can you ?

Dear sathyan,

Try restart httpd in your machine and try. Since apache reads the php
configuration file (/etc/php.ini) during the initial startup, it has to be
restarted for any change to take effect.

Sathyan had a problem with the PHP interpreter (/usr/bin/php) and its
got nothing to do with apache. whenever the php interpreter is called it
reads the config file, so any changes you make will be in effect the
next time you run the interpreter.

The max execution time might just not be set. You can try setting the
max execution time using the runtime call set_time_limit(). See to it
that your configuration file is _really_ read by looking at the phpinfo.
This you can do by typing:

$ php -i | lynx -stdin -dump | grep php.ini
          Configuration File (php.ini) Path /etc/php4/cgi/php.ini
$

I've a mail server running ipop3d. Whenever a client
connects on dialup and gets disconnected, on an
immediate connect, we get an error ERR: Mailbox in
use. Obviously, this must be due to a lock that ipop3d
places on the /var/spool/mail/$user file. If we wait
for 10 minutes and log in, the pop session goes thro'.

Does anyone know where this lock file is created and
how do we manually release the lock.

Cool Penguin.

Hi,

The Mandrake 8.2 CD shipped with DIGIT magazine does
not contain source files and documentation.Try for the
3 CD pack of MDK 8.2 then u will get the entire
documentation and source files.
PCQ Linux 7.1 comes with doucments and few sources. if
can find that cd also it wud be helpful for u..

Regards,

Partha

FYI , sources normally come as a seperate rpm package .

If u have all the cds of mandrake distro , u could find the kernel
sources in them (probably in the second cd, that's where i got my kernel
sources for redhat distro ) .

I am new to linux .I want to setup a small network of
6 machines all running on RH 7.3 . 
I did the following :

-Installed RH7.3 on a machine and assigned IP address
as 192.168.0.1 and likewise till 192.168.0.6 and have
connected them thro a hub and am able to ping from all
the systems.. 
- I want / home  in 192.168.0.1 to be exported to
other systems and have configured in /etc/exports of
192.168.0.1 accordingly.
-- Have also configured in /etc/fstab of the rest of
the systems to mount:/home of 192.168.0.1. .Have also
included te host nos in /etc/hosts.allow .
But the system on reboot gives the following output

Can somebody help me .

I too had the same conclusion earlier, but its not so. To test it out,
just write a php script which might run more than the seconds configured
in /etc/php.ini(while 1 seems to be smart) and send a http request to this
script and check the maximum exceeding time. Now edit the /etc/php.ini and
resend the request and i am sure it will result in old seconds. Now
restart httpd and you will observe the request been served in expected
seconds. Let us know if otherwise or where i am wrong.

Hello All,
    I am thinking about security in Linux. I had some problems in
    Role based access control. 

    If I create a user for one application say ftp then in principle
    he can use it to get email, pop-3 services. (by keeping noshell
    he may not be able to telnet) Is there any way to restrict not
    to get mail for that user. Same way the default pop3 daemon will
    not be able to restict individual user level. I don't think
    tcpwrappers will help in denying individual users. Is there any
    way to restrict for pop3 users.

Sambaiah Kilaru

but Sathyan's problem was not with apache but with the php shell. so you
need not restart your webserver.

If it is a CGI version of PHP, then php.ini is read on every run.

If the install is mod_php then the httpd would have to be restarted for
changes to take effect.

But still to serve the http request in case of any changes in php.ini,
needlessly we are supposed restart the server. Fine?

Sorry sathyan, still your problem is unsolved. Let someone else to try
solve it.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0207231642040.20223-100000@gateway.aero.iitm.ernet.in>

hi all,

there was a posting a week or so ago about the smallest usable linux
kernel and the poster inidcated he had got about 360k by throwing away
'useless' things like networking. unfortunately, the replies went off
track into smallest usable linux systems, toms root-boot floppies, run
linux off a cd and such. first off, i suspect that the size given is not
the actual kernel size but the bzipped kernel size. if we want limited
functionality, we can get really small by using the older kernels. for
example, current 2.4 version kernels come out at about 360k for minimal 
functionality. with 2.0.36 (redhat 5.2), a minimal kernel bzips to about 
200k (with only ide, ext2fs and console support). with 2.0.0, i have a 
gzipped kernel with full functionality (networking, nfs/nis etc etc) of 
about 400k - this is the old aero server which is currently taking a much 
needed break! when break time is over, i will try compiling a minimal 
kernel and see how small it will go. kernels of that vintage dont support 
bzipped format. if a smaller kernel is the goal, one could easily switch 
to the older and less functional kernels.

Like there's a perl/python interpreter, PHP too has an interpreter. the
php interpreter (on debian this is placed in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php{3,4})
can be used to read commands from a specified file (which could be stdin
too). 

$ php -q
<?
echo "hello world\n";
?>
^D
hello world
$ 

here, there is _absolutely_ no involvement of the webserver. php
typically reads the php.ini everytime it is run. and here PHP needs to
know _absolutely_ nothing about HTTP for the above example. Even when it
is run as a web app, it is your webserver that takes care of handling
HTTP requests and not PHP.

so the final say is that the webserver need not be restarted when using
the php interpreter and it is _very_ important to see if the correct
configuration file is read. if the interpreter was built from the
sources then the default location where the interpreter looks at is
'/usr/local/lib/php.ini'. use php -i to see if correct config file is
loaded. 

Optionally the interpreter can be asked to look for php.ini in
/etc/php4/cgi/:

$ php -c /etc/php4/cgi your_script.php

Subject: [Ilugc] Script duringstartup and shutdown
Message-ID: <200207231220.RAA23744@WS0005.indiatimes.com>

Hi,

sybase is not shutting down when i (Re)start the system.

So If i do the restart the system for about 2 or 3 times sybase getting crashed very easily.

To solve this issue I went into Service Configuration
to set the service, but unfortunately there is no such option called "Sybase service".  

So I have planned to write a script which enables me to start the sybase service when ever the system is getting restarted and stop the sybase service when the system is going for sleep/shutdown.

I want to know is there is any kind of 
batch file can be created so that it will get
executed during the startup stage and it has 
to get executed during the shutdown stage.

kindly guide me on this issue.

Regards,
Hemanth Kumer L

Message-ID: <20020723172346.8426.qmail@webmail26.rediffmail.com>

hi,

   yeah 360k was the size of the _bzipped_ kernel - sorry, i 
didn't mention that. also i got that size with almost no effort - 
all i did was to unselect as many modules as possible thru xconfig 
(i tried it on 2.4).
   for the past few days, i've been trying my hand at compiling 
kernels got from kernel.org->history. didn't achieve much success 
tho.
   guys who have done kernel recompilation to an extent much more 
than making selections in xconfig or menuconfig, plz don't b 
silent - plz post ur results.
   anybody out there actually opened up the kernel source files 
and chopped down code in order to get a smaller kernel?
   thanx a lot for the reply, sriram. wud u mind if i sent a mail 
directly 2u?
   a company called "Coventive" claims to have the "smallest 
embedded linux kernel in the world" (143KB): 
http://www.linuxdevices.com/products/PD3914712076.html
   btw, "removing 'useless' things like networking" was meant as a 
joke, expressing the extent of stripping-down i was doing.

I have just now installed mdk9 beta1 with single cd. 

Few Observations,

1. booting is very fast compared mdk8.2.

2 I had first look of Gnome 2.0

3.X windows also starts faster compared to previous version

4. Lot of latest softwares included like mozilla1.0, evolution 1.08
Kde 3.02 with koffice 1.2beta2

Other features i am just having a feel of it. All my cards have been

Hi,
	I have a function called input() defined in parser.y. And in lexer.l
I've defined

#define input           rbc_input

When I compile parser.y on Solaris (Forte cc compiler) everything is fine.
But when I compile the same file on RH7.2 (using gcc 3.0.3) getting the
following error:

parser.y:5708: redefinition of `rbc_input'
lexer.l:873: `rbc_input' previously defined here

Does anyone have any idea on this?

Thanks in advance,

Take care of vacation.pl in smrsh drectory else autoreply will not work.
Also users should have /sbin/nologin shell for smrsh to work not
/bin/false in case you do not want to give mail users shell access. Have

Also this is the first time they are using isolinux instead of syslinux to 
boot from cdrom. So there may be problems with some cd drives.

Hi,
	 Mdk is now based on new glibc and gcc3.1.1. I would like some feedback from 
mdk9.0b1 users as to the advantages gcc3.1.1 brings. How fast are the 
applications now that they are compiled with gcc 3.1.1? How are the Athlon 
optimizations if you are using them?
Thanks

Subject: [Ilugc] Minutes from the ILUGC Meet - 13th, July, 2002
Message-ID: <20020725053704.GA22590@chennailug.org>

************************************************************************
			Minutes from the ILUGC Meet - 13th, July, 2002
************************************************************************

	The aeronautics department was already teeming with life when I
entered. Srini was talking on ways of providing groupware solutions.
A Total of 21 ppl had attended the meet. The meet had started at 4:45PM
or I was told so. PAsokan was absent.

	Srini was mentioning that there must be some sort of a groupware
solution like that of Lotus Notes, etc., on GNU/Linux. Many issues
with free tools were discussed at length. 

	I guess I was late and all mouths had already started watering (oh
yeah.. now the post-meet-canteen is a ritual). Upon Suraj's request,
the meet was 'prolonged' for a little more time. 

	Prabhu came up and asked ppl to introduce themselves. Upon seeing
that the crowd was shying away from getting on to the dias, prabhu
started off by introducing himself "I'm prabhu.. eh... *laugh*".

	The now-not-so-shy crowd started... each giving a few lines about
themselves... their experience/problems/jobs/love with "Linux 7.2"(sic)
and such. This meet marks the 'last meet of the year(or years to come?)'
for Ravikant Rao and Srinivasan Ramakrishnan who are flying to Canada
and US respectively for education. There was this person (whose name I
forget) who was a BLUG member. He expressed that he liked ILUGC's
'friendly' and 'informal' atmos. Prabhu et al asked him the 'million
dollar-question': "Do you think an average newbie would learn more at
ILUGC or at BLUG?". He said that there were more ppl at BLUG and that
its possible that he gets to know more from them... and his final say
was that he liked ILUGC. (more than BLUG?) He expressed his wish to
volunteer himself for ILUGC and he also wanted to collect more
enthu/volunteers from ILUGC and organise more activities.  He mentioned
that currently our LUG was sailing without a direction and that it would
be nice if it can be directed. "It is not that we never attempted to
organise our LUG, but nobody volunteers to do stuff" explained Prabhu.
Another noteworthy 'feature' of ILUGC is that nobody "holds" ILUGC.

	Somebody got on to the dias and started talking (about weblogic[?])
while the "minutes writer" and ravi were busy exchanging private jokes.
\-;

	The same old topic of 'having a forum/IRC on ILUGC' was brought up
and ppl were enlightened by the older men and made to believe that
IRC/Forums wont work out.

	The meet ended and ppl re-assembled at the canteen. random mouths were
munching random junk ranging from juices to dahi poori.

	The next meet would take place at the Aeronautics Dept., IIT-Madras
on the 10th August at 4:30 PM.

 just create a file called "nologin"--leave it empty and place it on the /etc 
/etc/nologin
it will deny telnet connections..

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0207251347160.12350-100000@hanuman.ddns.comp.nus.edu.sg>

Hi,

I am using RH Linux 7.2.  I removed the default python came with that
distribution and installed python 2.2.1 from the source.

python is working perfectly now.  But the problem, suddenly the printing
service stopped working.  When i tried "printtool" it gives me the
following error:

---------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/sbin/printtool", line 7, in ?
    import printconf_gui
  File "/usr/share/printconf/util/printconf_gui.py", line 40, in ?
    from printconf_conf import *
  File "/usr/share/printconf/util/printconf_conf.py", line 81, in ?
    from xml.utils import qp_xml
ImportError: No module named utils
----------


I am not able to find xml.utils and instead I got "Gnosis Utils" in google
search.  Is that the appropriate module to solve the above problem?

If you wanted to deny telnet itself, you can stop telnet service. This
depends on how telnetd runs on your machine. Typically this is run as an
[x]inetd service. man inetd, xinetd for more details.

If you wanted to run telnetd and yet deny certain ppl alone from logging
in you can change the login shells of the ppl that you wish to deny to
/bin/true or something. man chsh for more details.

Hi VR,

Disable the telnet service... U might want to do this in case 
due to reasons like "clear case passwords" etc and move to ssh...

I'd recommend you use /sbin/nologin in the shell this will deny the
users access but allow pop login. /bin/false can also be used but in
this case, smrsh enabled commands will not run. Also think about how you
would enable password change in case user does not have a login. Either
provide it thro' a web based application or make the shell itself
/bin/passwd. Then every time the user logs in, he can only change his
password and sesion closes.

if you have pam enabled logins, see /etc/security/limits.conf and the
appropriate config file in /etc/pam.d/

ulimit would be a dirty hack too...

Is the older version of Python still installed?  If it is then its
likely that printtool is using the wrong version of Python.  So try
the following:

 1. Find out what the older version of python that printool used to
 use.

 2. Run printtool using that python interpreter.  Lets say its
 python1.5.2

 python1.5.2 /usr/sbin/printtool

This might do the job.  If it does.  Hardcode the interpreter in the
first line of the printtool script.

* bad idea*

never telnet as root. set up sudo access for yourself and other whom you
wish to have super access.
Any command as root can be done by issuing sudo <command> see man sudo for
more details....


And if you are *really* desperate to want to login as root then  rm
/etc/securetty.

Under normal circumstances, wu-ftpd would be installed but disabled in
xinetd. Check if ftp is installed using rpm -q ftp command. If it is
installed, check the /etc/xinetd.d directory. Open ftp file in vi and
set disable = no. Restart xinetd. In case you want to be secure, look at
chroot for jailed root. You will also need to decide and provide links
to a restricted set of commands in a directory as bin so that minimal
commands outside the ftp commands work.

The yahoogroups thingy that we have is already obsolete (or is it still
active?). We have a new system in place. Thanks to Dr.P.Sriram/Prabhu.
Our mailing list / archives are now hosted on aero.iitm.ac.in. 

The reason why you aren't able to post to the yahoo groups archive is
that it was created 'owner-post-only' and hence only the owner can post
to it, not the members.

Subject: [Ilugc] Firewall
Message-ID: <001b01c23545$05758a80$6300a8c0@smohan>

A while ago a post appeared on a firewalled machine not responding to
ping. Normally, ping reply is turned off. I had suggested turning it on.
Dr Sriram suggested it may not be appropriate without restricting the
port/socket for ICMP to respond to ping. Normally ping reply is turned
off to prevent DoS, smurfing etc. 

Iptables supports stateful inspection and rate limiting which would
allow us to respond to these requests but still limit the damage they
could do using DoS techniques. The icmp protocol match provides an icmp
type and state match.

In iptables parlance, there are only four types of icmp that can be
categorized as NEW, or ESTABLISHED: 

1) Echo request (ping, 8) and echo reply (pong, 0). 
2) Timestamp request (13)and reply (14). 
3) Information request (15) and reply (16). 
4) Address mask request (17) and reply (18). 

The request in each case is classified as NEW and the reply as
ESTABLISHED. 
Other types of icmp are not request-reply based and can only be RELATED
to other connections. 

iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j
ACCEPT 
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED  -j
ACCEPT 

1) An icmp echo request is NEW and so is allowed in the OUTPUT chain. 

2) An icmp echo reply, provided it is in response to an echo request, is
ESTABLISHED and so is allowed in the INPUT chain. An echo reply cannot
be allowed in the OUTPUT chain for the rules above because there is no
NEW in the INPUT chain to allow echo requests and a reply has to be in
response to a request. 

3) An icmp redirect, because it is not request-reply based, is RELATED
and so can be allowed in both the INPUT and the OUTPUT chains provided
there is already a tcp or udp connection in the state table already that
it can be matched against. 

In order to limit rates, the limit extension can be used along with
icmp-type as under.

iptables -A FORWARD -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m limit --limit
1/s -j ACCEPT

Check out what is ur. default runlevel (/etc/inittab) .
Then use 'chkconfig' to know what r the services being done .

There is also a gui utility for configuring this .
Check out System->Services .

Startup scripts are found in /etc/init.d and
symbolically linked to appropriate init level in
directors /etc/rc2.d /etc/rc3.d ..etc. 
To start/shut sybase create sybasestartup script like
this

#script sybase
#!/bin/bash
#
# description: this will allow sybase server to
start/stop
#              boot-time 

# Source the function library.
. /etc/init.d/functions

RETVAL=0

# See how we were called.
case "$1" in
  start)
/opt/sybase/install/startserver -f /install/RUN_SYBASE
	touch /var/lock/subsys/sybase
	;;
  stop)
	echo "Stopping sybase"
	/opt/sybase/bin/isql -Usa -SSYBASE  <shutsybase 
	rm -f /var/lock/subsys/sybase
	;;
  *)
	echo $"Usage: $0 {start|stop}"
	RETVAL=1
esac

exit $RETVAL


Here shutsybase is file containing
passswd   [ password of sa]
shutdown
go



Link this script to /etc/rc?d/S90sybase where ? is the
appropriate run level you want to start [here 90 is
just an example. give number according the desired
order of starting/stopping among various services]

Similarly link it to /etc/rc?.d/K90sybase where ? is 0
and 6

Remember scripts in /etc/rc?.d starting with S will be
for starting services and scripts starting with K will
be for stopping services

Add/remove service permanently using chkconfig
or ntsysv or modifying the symlinks in /etc/rc?.d/

start/stop a service temporarily using
/sbin/service servicename start
/sbin/service servicename stop

Create your own service-script if needed
in /etc/init.d

hi,

Cheeni told me of a new free book on Python that *he* wanted to
mention on ILUGC.  The original announcement was on slashdot.

Personally, I think the standard tutorial and library reference for
Python are good enough but maybe someone will find this useful.

I have recently installed GNU Hurd from Linux.
But actually Linux is not needed. The CD (Debian)
is bootable and loads Linux to install Hurd.
The system is working fine.

But I have two problems. Could someone help?

1. The swap partition is not mounted and I
don't know how to create the transalators.

2. I have not yet mounted an iso9660 CD ROM.
How should I create a device file for /dev/hdc
And how should I mount an iso9660 filesystem?
I am not able to read the documents in the
CD without mounting it, So I am unable to proceed.

Thanks in advance,
Suriya Narayanan M S

Hi all -

Forbes has a series of articles on Linux.  Forbes is very independent and as a
result is probably not going to be intimidated by Microsoft's FUD.

I meant that I used GNU/Linux to install GNU/Hurd,
because before booting the CD, I mounted it and read
/hurd-doc/hurd-install-guide.txt  by Neal H Walfield
It says
<quote>
   The  Debian  GNU/Hurd  distribution,  unlike  distributions  of  other
   operating  systems, does not have a nice installation program. One day
   it  will  and  maybe  you  will help design and implement it. However,
   until  then,  installing  GNU/Hurd  requires that you install the base
   system  from another operating system, specifically, another Unix-like
   system.  Reports  have come in that people have successfully installed
   the  Hurd from several different flavors of GNU/Linux and the BSDs. As
   for  other  systems,  it should not be a problem, that is, assuming it
   provides a Unix-like environment. No matter how one approaches it, the
   only  Hurd  distribution is based on Debian, as such, cross installing
   from Debian GNU/Linux could make life a bit easier.

The file /README-or-FAIL says
<quote>
   This CD set is a heavily modified Debian installation disc set which
   will only install Hurd.  The CD was produced with butchered debian-cd and
   boot-floppies scripts.  Most of the Debian documentation has been retained
   which may be of use to people not used to Debian installations, but be careful,
   it has a Linux taste.  All the Hurd .deb packages are included on the CDs and

I didn't boot the CD and follow the installation procedure.
I did what was told in the file /hurd-doc/hurd-install-guide.txt 
Accordingly my /etc/fstab reads
/dev/hd0s8      /       ext2    defaults        0       1
/dev/hd0s5      none    swap    sw              0       0

But I still get an error. BTW /dev/hda5 is the
swap partition under Linux. I think that can be used
under Hurd also. Maybe I didn't create the devices
using MAKEDEV. I had no time to read the man pages.
Will try to take a try this weekend.

Subject: [Ilugc] Recursive directory listing....
Message-ID: <FA3F4D4380B5D51186D600B0D0AAD24203A5A5A7@ccr.satyam.com>

Hi all,

has anyone tried the recursive directory listing....
I have VSFTPD 1.0.1 FTP server installed on SUSE linux 8.0.
When i execute  "ls -lRa"   it lists only the top level directories and
dose'nt list the directories recursively.
Is there any way I can get the recursive directory listing,maybe some conf
file setting i am missing?

Thanking you all for the time spent,
Regards,
Pravin Kumar S.

The below issue was sorted, 
had to dig down a bit in the conf file, /etc/vsftpd.conf to uncomment the
line 'ls_recurse_enable=YES'

Message-ID: <3D476D1D.62528424@eth.net>

 
Hi all,

I have a Dishnet DSL internet connection through a Centillium USB modem
(provided by DishnetDSL) connected to a Windoze box. I am trying to
create an Internet Gateway Server (a la PC Quest July 2001 issue) using
RHL 7.2 and I don't know how to go about configuring the USB modem under
Linux. I am not a Linux geek (...yet !). I hear that this has given
quite a few headaches to people who have already tried it out. Is this
true ? No light at the end of the tunnel ?

Help !

Regards,
Shankar.
