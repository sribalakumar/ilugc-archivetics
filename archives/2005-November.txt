Free and Open Source Software for E-learning
1-25 June 2004

Useful Resources

Introductory Remarks

During the discussion held from 1-25 June 2004 over 200 links were
shared and proposed by the participants. More links have been identified
and added as the discussion continues. This reference list of links is
an outcome of your inputs and has been compiled to provide some guidance
on the wealth of resources related to FOSS for e-learning on the web. 

An attempt has also been made to direct the attention of the more
technically advanced user to specific resources. In such a case, the
category is marked.

Hi, 
  I just installed Debian Sarge-3.1 on my system. It fails 
to 'startx'.

   System Config
AMD Athlon 2800 XP
80 GB Maxtor SATA HDD
512 MB RAM

  Initially the hsync n vsync settings were wrong. I changed
them in /etc/X11/Xconfig4 (hope the path is right). but it
still does not work.
  I have a Nvidia GeForce FX 5600 graphics card. Is it an 
issue with that. I tried installing the latest drivers 
from the nvidia website, but that also failed. It says there
was 'no precompiled version of your kernel available'. What 
does this mean?? 
  Everything else is working fine. I was able to mount all the 
drivers through the command line interface. 
  Does Debian support NTFS partitions??

  regards,
   Firaz.

I think I see the whole picture now: EOF is a condition, set by the OS when 
data in a stream runs out, and interpreted in C as a negative value (-1).

Where I was confused was this: To send an EOF in an interactive shell, you 
send an EOT, also known as Ctrl+D... In DOS, this is Ctrl+Z. Apparently, this 
is particular to interactive shells, where there's a need to inform the 
shell, and thus the OS that the file has ended. This character is not 
actually stored in the file, from what I see...

EOF is indicated by default, but the key seq Ctrl+D

Message-ID: <71ea7b280511020429k265cebb0i1cc1f7fa53e90bff@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

An exciting career, a chance to work in the development (not maintenance)of
next generation networking products and a pay packet which is the best in
chennai, is awaiting 2-3 years experienced professionals who

1. have strong knowledge in C, Networking, System Programming,
2. Any Chassis CLI commands knowledge. (Cisco chassis a plus)

ISofttech requires many such people and as u might know, ISofttech is an
terrific, informal organisation promoted by Ray Stata(Founder of Analog
Devices) and Ashok Jhunjunwala. ISofttech was recently in news for
developing Blooma, the world's first searchable email client. The team that
developed bloomba was acquired by yahoo and yahoo,chennai was established.
The people who are here are the very best in their respective domain. This
is a wonderful chance to work in this company.

ISofttech was recently in news, for forging pact with Vanu Systems (Market
leader in Software Radio, son of Amar Bose). ISofttech will function as an
extended arm in the product development.

This can be a turning point in ur otherwise normal career. I can be
contacted at 9840841352.

Regards,
Eashwar N.

Try the live CD of the distros first. Only you can identify the best distro
appropriate after getting used to each of the suggested ones.

Hi,
You can try linux from scratch as this would help you
in not only developing something like a distribution
but also help you to understand how to use a
particular distribution for your embedded system.If
you are using Linux from scratch you will know how to
compile or strip of an unwanted code from an existing
distibution and then learn how to recompile it for
your own system.
This is just a suggestion.After looking into its
official website you can decide upon it.

Hi,
you might want to try these 2 sites:
www.linux-laptop.net

tuxmobil.org

They have information on laptop users experience with
Linux for different laptop models. could be useful for
checking out issues / workarounds for ur model.

AFAIK qemu, vmware are hardware virtualisation software... one would
still have to install windows to run dos/windows apps using qemu

IMHO, wine or dosemu should server the requirement.

Hi,

  I have heard that Suse is good for Laptops and other desktops too.
Other distros that can be fruitful are mandrake & xandros. The are
good for laptops and desktops as they support multimedia etc. Redhat
flavors are good for servers and the like.

  For running dos based application you can use wine. Or if you want
to use windows as a OS running you can use VMware.

Hello,

AT#CID={0,1,2} for enabling caller-id function (it mentions (for U.S.A)

I tried these commands using cu and minicom got OK from the modem...but
I could not see any data in between the RING s.

Do Caller ID standards for Chennai Telephones or BSNL in general differ

I don't know if this is the right place to ask this..I am sorry if it is
not.

Hoping for help,

Subject: [Ilugc] FreeBSD Project Launches FreeBSD 6.
Message-ID: <1131160719.3792.14.camel@localhost.localdomain>

FreeBSD Project Launches FreeBSD 6.0 - Raises the Bar for Open Source
Operating Systems

Berkeley, CA (PRWEB) November 4, 2005 -- The FreeBSD Project announces
the availability of FreeBSD 6.0, an open source operating system derived
from BSD UNIX, which offers a powerful alternative to Linux, Solaris,
and Windows. FreeBSD enables enterprise organizations to utilize open
source technologies that focus on reliability, security, and
scalability.

"Yahoo! is impressed with the performance and stability of FreeBSD 6.0,"
says David Filo, Yahoo! co-founder. Yahoo! is one of many enterprise
companies that rely on the world-renowned stability and performance of
the FreeBSD operating system.

One of the new features in FreeBSD 6.0 is a multithreaded filesystem,
which greatly improves data access times for local disks, RAID
configurations, network filesystems, and SANs. Recent performance
benchmarks show that FreeBSD 6.0 outperforms Linux in raw data
throughput.

Additionally, FreeBSD 6.0 extends support for wireless devices such as
Intel Centrino and adds supports for the popular new WPA wireless
security protocol. Several improvements are incorporated into
NDISulator, a component of the operating system that allows Windows
network drivers to run natively under FreeBSD.

FreeBSD now scales much more efficiently across multiple processor
systems. Support for 8 or more processors, such as the new dual core AMD
Opteron configurations, gives consumers a viable alternative against
more expensive, proprietary hardware platforms and operating systems
from IBM, HP, and Sun.

About the FreeBSD Project

The FreeBSD Project provides a free, open source operating system for
several platforms, including Intel x86 and AMD64. FreeBSD is derived
from BSD, the version of UNIX developed at UC Berkeley. The unencumbered
BSD license permits modification and redistribution of the software
while allowing an individual or company to retain intellectual property.

I don't know, but you probably need to subscribe to the caller-id service
before they actually turn it on, so you won't actually see the signals on
the line unless you've opted for it.

IIRC, nowadays the caller id is enabled by default with Chennai
Telephones, bfone service. We need not opt for it explicitly.

Message-ID: <20051105044651.5909.qmail@webmail46.rediffmail.com>

  
Hi,
 Thanks for replying Karra. But still we have some misunderstanding. Here is what I want as a requirement:

My hardware has the MAC address 00:01:12:03:04:05. I want to change it to some other value(say 00:00:5e:00:01:01) without configuring it to the hardware using the ioctl SIOCSHWADDR call(actually I want to configure more than one mac address to a single interface). Hence i should recieve packets to MAC1 and MAC2. Packets to MAC1 will be recieved since it is a configured address. But how can I receive MAC2 packets? I agree Packets are not switched.

Regards
Muneer CH

Don't know much about caller-id's. But what I know is that you need to 
subscribe for
this facility. Also Following details about the caller-id are taken from 
related documents.

Phone gets first ring, duration 2 seconds
Delay 0.5 seconds after first ring
Send 30 bytes of '01010101', duration 250ms (channel seizure signal)
Send 150ms of marks (carrier signal)
Send an 8 bit "parameter word type"
        00000100 = Caller ID
        00001010 = message waiting indicator
        10000001 = Test for caller ID
Send an 8 bit number representing the number of WORDS in the message

Now, the actual data:

The first two digits are the month with a leading zero for JAN to SEPt.
The next two digits are the day of the month w/leading zero for 1 to 9.
The next two digits are the hour in local military time.
The next two digits are the minutes in local time.
The remaining digits (message length -8) are the telephone number
        of the calling party. The last field may include the 'P' or 'O'
        for blocked or out-of-area calls.

The last 8 bits of the message are the checksum. The check sum is the
two's complement of the modulo 256 sum of the other words in the data
message. This sum does not include the channel seizure signal or the
carrier signal.

Total transmission duration = 718ms

The above description is as stated in the Motorola MC145447 Caller ID
Receiver data sheet.

1. Half-Duplex != 10 Mbps.
2. Full-Duplex != 100 Mbps.
3. Your question is not clear. Do you want to know how to set the NIC
to 10BaseT-HD in Linux? You could try:

ethtool -s eth0 speed 10 duplex half autoneg off

4. It could be that your PPPoE router is set to no negotiation,
10BaseT-HD, and possibly this can be changed in its UI. Check there.

You cannot change the value on the NIC anyway - it is hardcoded into
the NIC (and hence is also known as a BIA - Burnt-In Address). All you
can do is to make the NIC respond to a different MAC address, on a
per-boot basis - which is done by:

ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:00:5e:00:01:01

The BIA stays in place. I haven't heard of any technique that lets you
change it. It in fact lets you identify the manufacturer of the
device.

Theoretically, you can do this with some amount of Linux kernel
hacking. But you should understand that what you describe will be
perceived by other devices on the network as an IP address collision -
your NIC will respond for ARP packets asking for its IP with both the
MACs. Most networking hardware will ignore at least one of these
(Cisco switches will shut down the port where the collision is found).
Your box will be unreachable on the network.

Now, if you want to have multiple IP addresses on the same interface,
each with its own MAC, then I guess it can be done with some amount of
fiddling around. I haven't given this much thought, though - but if I
were implementing this, I probably know where to start with.

I have made the following post in the FOSS group:

Dear all,

We have implemented a Tr-Ac Tool for Transparency and Accountability.

The tool is now mainly focussed on service organizations including
Governments.

It follows the Tottenham system of Administration, followed in Government
Departments, a proven system of tracking of letters and files in Government.

We have tried to convert the manual working into computerized working and in
the process, simplify the work, eliminating the need for taking multiple
copies of documents, feeding input data by various agencies, manual
generation of a variety of reports, proactive working to reactive working,
minimising the tme spent on postmortem analysis, etc.

The tools used are all open source: GNU/Java, JBoss, PGSQL all running on
GNU/Linux platform.

The tool has provisions to create the organization hierarchy, create and
manage external and internal communications, a contact management and
databank repository, reminder mechanism and history tracking.

Manual records can be digitized and made electronic and attached to files.
The implementation has improved the service level of organizations by 50%,
by redcing the process delays. The tool can be adopted by any organization.

We propose to present a paper on "Implementing paperless office for
e-Governance using open source tools" in FOSS.IN/2005 <http://foss.in/2005>.

2.6.x? Can you tell the exact version? Post the output
of:

cat /usr/src/linux/.config | grep USB

Replace /usr/src/linux with your kernel sources
directory.

Your camera is listed with gphoto2:

http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php

What did you try? and how do you know it didn't work?

I use a Sony DSC-P93 in PTP mode on 2.6.12.3 (Debian)
and works like a charm:

  gphoto2 --camera "Sony DSC-P92 (PTP mode)" --port
"usb:"
  gphoto2 --get-all-files

Can you give the exact message that is printed in the
output of dmesg after you connect your camera?

The PTP mode (Picture Transfer Protocol) was actually
developed by Kodak. Did you switch your camera to this
mode before plugging it in?

In the Sony DSC-P93, I switch to Setup
mode->Setup2->USB Connect: PTP.

I initially wanted to check if you have proper USB
support. Hence, I asked for the output. You will also
need SCSI support. Can you post the output of:

cat /usr/src/linux/.config | grep SCSI

Usually, I have the SCSI, USB support compiled as
modules. You can have it loaded only when needed. You
seem to have it built-in. 

Hence, lsmod may not be useful. Definitely have to
look at your kernel config.

If you can understand a bit of German (atleast, some
relevant outputs that you can look into):

Message-ID: <20051107201858.46638.qmail@web51414.mail.yahoo.com>

Dear ppl, 
I have dual boot in my comp. FC4,Win XP. I had some
problem with my XP. So i wanted to repair it. So i
tried to boot from the windows CD. But unfortunately
it didnt work.
I got this problem,

Press any key to boot from CD...
then,
Setup is checking your hardware configuration....

After this i didnt get the usual blue screen where it
asks to install XP...but got a blank screen. But this
windows cd worked fine in my friends' comps. And Other
Live cds like (Ubuntu live cd) works fine in my comp.
So what i did was i made my hard disk a slave in my
friends comp..and then reinstalled XP in my C:\. now i
brought it here and connected.
But i get an error if get into windows XP in the grub
loader.

here are my grub.conf and df -h outputs
grub.conf:

title Fedora Core 4
        root (hd0,7)
        kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.11-1.1369_FC4 ro

        initrd /initrd-2.6.11-1.1369_FC4.img
title Windows XP
        rootnoverify (hd0,0)
        chainloader +1

/etc/fstab :

where /dev/hdc1 is my c:/ (XP installed)

Now i have some qns..?
Why does the Cd give a blank screen output?
Now how do i manipulate my Grub.conf?

Try

chainloader +1
makeactive


/etc/fstab :

I trying to cross compile samba-2.2.7a.

I am using cross-tools ( gcc-2.95.3)

for configuration I use as:

#CC="arm-linux-gcc" INCLUDEDIR="/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/include/
/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/lib/gcc-lib/arm-linux/2.95.3/include" 
LIBS="/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/lib/libg.a" CFLAGS="$INCLUDES
$LIBS" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/arm/samba
--sbindir=/usr/local/arm/samba/sbin

After I run this , I get a messages :


....
....

checking whether to enable winbind ldap hack... no
checking whether or not getgroups returns EGID too many times... cross
checking whether struct passwd has pw_comment... no
checking whether struct passwd has pw_age... no
checking whether to use included popt... ./popt
***checking configure summary... configure: warning: cannot run when
cross-compiling
updating cache ./config.cache
creating ./config.status
creating include/stamp-h
creating Makefile
creating script/findsmb
creating include/config.h

Why is there a warning that it cannot run when cross-compiling!

If i do make it fails and gives me:

And what would these outputs be? Need to get the big

Well, you shouldn't be doing make when configure

Incorrect includes to configure or you don't have the
necessary header files.

`----

A Debian package is nothing but an 'ar' archive. You can simply do the
following:

1. ar xf <file.deb>
2. data.tar.gz contains the files
3. control.tar.gz contains  the pre-/post-  scripts. They might  be of
   some use too.

You seem to be missing essential header files. What is
your host system? Which distro are you running? 

You really should have posted the log just to my
private e-mail ID, or should have posted it to
pastebin.com (for example) and submitted the URL. Its
bad practice to send large attachments to mailing
lists.

That's not a correct netmask to get a valid prefix.

seems to have a few hits. I have ported RPMs from PLD to Redhat, it is
pretty easy. The Mandrake one can be a bit of a problem, though.

Subject: [Ilugc] Creation Of Mailusers
Message-ID: <20051108162536.28314.qmail@webmail18.rediffmail.com>

Hello,

This mail is basically about creation of mailusers with same name but different domains. 

I have more than one domain on a server. E.g: abc.com and xyz.com. Can we create only mail users eg: sub@abc.com and sub@xyz.com? If so how is that done and what would be the command? 

I need this integrated in PHP. Previously there was only one domain and I used to create using "useradd" command from PHP. That would create a home directory like /home/sub. With another domain I can't use useradd for the other domain as a user "sub" already exists.

Can anyone advise?

Thanks

You need a mail server that is capable of handling virtual domains.
Almost all of the Open Source ones do, but I personally find Courier -
http://www.courier-mta.org - the easiest to administer (among its
numerous benefits).

Message-ID: <871x1q6g96.fsf@localhost.localdomain>


Hi all,

I use Debian GNU/Linux on IBM ThinkPad R52. Recently I noticed that the system time drifts. Even if I set BIOS clock back to the correct time manually, after few days of uptime the system clock drifts drastically. Does someone had similar problem.

Google is not helping me much. Lots of people is having similar problem. Most of them use ntp-server/ntpdate to sync date/time using the Network Time Protocol. I really don't know whether it is a kernel issue or a Debian specific issue.ntp-server/ntpdate need internet connection to update time. What if somebody doesn't have internet connection? Is something really wrong with kernel? Time is the key thing and I wonder how it drifts and that too in Linux.

Could someone find out alternate solution for this ?

Cheers,
Noorul

Message-ID: <4371676B.4020703@gmail.com>

I had read "Speaking Well" by Loren Reid way back in 1986, and recently
had occasion to return back to it.  I recommend this book to all
students aspiring to advocate the use of free software to others.

According to Reid, the art of communication has made it possible for
humans to not only survive  but ultimately possess the earth.  We could
add, with free software, we are only a few steps away from making our
survival on earth more meaningful and may be one day even help us
possess the cosmos.  Reid appears to have exerted considerable influence
in US public affairs, highlighting the importance of making effective
speeches, and the above book has many interesting asides that could be
interesting to the experts here as well.

Of course, perfection in use of language is stressed in Tholkappiam,
Nanool and others. Very sophisticated debating rules are contemplated in
texts like Tarka Samgraha, our ancient flame war manual.  All these
resources help to sharpen our tools, and I HTH :)

is the drift by the same amount of time? if so.. check if u have enabled
UTC in linux.

if not then your BIOS batter must have gone weak

Is something really wrong with kernel? Time is the key thing and I wonder how it drifts and that too in Linux.

the kernel maintains its own clock based on the timer interrupts it
gets (jiffy count). however, this can lead to drifts due to interrupt
servicing time etc.. so, the kernel syncs itself with the hardware
clock every 11 minutes or so. so, if the time drifts from the actual
time monotonously over a long period, it is most likely to be a bios
problem, like a weak battery. ntp is not a must for every systems, in
fact most systems don't need it. the only case when u need it is when
u are not sure of setting the time manually accurately enough, and
when whatever drifts that might occur due to hardware inaccuracies
need to be kept to a minimum.

it moves on...

I forgot to mention that sometimes I use Win XP for official works. Is there
any chance for dual boot to create similar problem? I want to confirm
whether it's the problem with BIOS battery. Can someone help me?

is your system clock out of sync with the hardware clock or is your 
hardware clock not keeping time properly?

days of uptime the system clock drifts drastically. Does someone had

In PC, the problem occurs due to problematic BIOS battery. Replacing
the battery solves the problem. Not very sure about your laptop

Hi all!
I just got a Huawei WA1003A router for my BSNL Dataone connection. I
connected it to my ethernet card(it can be used on USB also). Works well
with Win XP. But I'm unable to configure it to connect on linux. As this is
a precoded modem, i cant use any rp-pppoe to do that, as its a precoded
modem(Type II). when i switch on my modem on windows, it just sends the
precoded passwd to the server and connects. When i try to activate my eth0,
it tries to get activated and fails saying that it couldn't resolve ip
address. Plz help..

hi,

I tried copying the following file to my USB drive when it is mounted
sync & async. The time taken with sync option is very high compared to
that of 'async'

$ ls -h -l FirefoSetu1.Bet2.exe
-rwxr-xr-x  1 arpit arpit 5.0M 2005-10-28 18:15 FirefoSetu1.Bet2.exe

If the USB drive is mounted 'sync': (the umount time is negligible)

$ /usr/bin/time cp FirefoSetu1.Bet2.exe /mnt/sda1
0.00user 0.37system 6:51.59elapsed 0%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+149minor)pagefaults 0swaps

If the USB drive is mounted 'async':
$ /usr/bin/time cp FirefoSetu1.Bet2.exe /mnt/sda1/Fire1.exe
0.00user 0.02system 0:00.28elapsed 10%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+149minor)pagefaults 0swaps
$ /usr/bin/time umount /mnt/sda1
0.00user 0.01system 0:07.90elapsed 0%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+230minor)pagefaults 0swaps

This vast time difference is only when i perform data transfer from
Hard disk to the USB drive. Data transfer from USB drive to Hard disk
doesn't take that much time, irrespective of the mount options.
Can someone please tell, why is it so?
                                                - Arpit

Hi ALL,

I have 2 Offices (Let A & B). The Data and the Linux
(FC2) servers are at 'A' Office.

To access/process the data at 'A' office, The Users of
'B' office login thro SSH with authorised Key to A
office and  and execute batch programs on the data and
get back the result on command mode. But they feel
uneassy to work on command mode.

So Iam planning to give Graphical Termial using VNC
server.

The Problem is:

Is VNC server is a *SECURED* one ?. Can I configure it
to my users. My data's are valuable one.

Please reply. I have to satisfy my management.

Thanks in Advance.

Best regds.

Babu. J

I don't think "async" mounting waits for the filesystem to be
unmounted to write the buffers to the drive. In all likelyhood, the
kernel kept on dumping stuff onto the USB drive between your cp and
umount. Did your drive's LED show activitity? IIRC, async option just
means that writes to that filesystem will not block.

Transfers from the USB drive to your regular HDD will depend on
sync/async settings for your HDD filesystems. Even then, I'd expect a
HDD write to be several times faster than a USB drive write. Your USB
drive/port might be the full-speed variety, which supports upto 12Mbps
only whereas your HDD would support much higher transfer rates. You
might have an HDD controller that does its own caching. Any number of
reasons.

    The LEDs show activity only when i cp and when i umount(& not in
between). If the mount option is async the blinking during umount is
of longer duration.

Shouldn't it be the other way round? Sync will
immediately flush the buffers and will take less time.

> IIRC,

async means there is no immediate writes to the drive
from the time you gave the copy command till the time
when the files get updated to the drive.

To the buffer, yes. Overall it should be the same.
Travelling from city A to B via car and then by flight
is the same as when you travel from city B to A via
flight and then by car.

Only when you have policies in between, handling of
the buffer or sync/async, the copy times will differ. 

Sync will flush immediately. async should write only
when you umount.

  man sync

Yes, only then data is flushed.

In 2.6 kernels you can force flushing of data without
caching.

not necessarily... just that with async, the kernel tries to delay
writes as long as possible, so that they can be bunched up/done when
there is less load. and umount happens to be the last opportunity the
kernel gets to write out the data. in fact, i suggest to arpit that he
run something like gkrellm, copy some big file to the usb drive
mounted as async, and sit back with very less load on the system. you
should see the disk monitor write out data after some time, even
before the umount occurs. on a related note, posix allows you to force
sync behaviour for a particular file even when the fs is mounted
async. (i don't think cp/mv offers this as an option though..)

it moves on...

this is most certainly the former issue i mentioned. Please google nad
find out how to disable UTC.. in gnome its as easy as unchecking the box
in the clock applet.

also check if your "/etc/localtime" points to "/usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC"

Subject: [Ilugc] Legal Robots, Ad-hocracy, ...
Message-ID: <4373FB42.50603@gmail.com>

Interest in Legal Robots appears to be picking up these days!
http://allafrica.com/stories/200511100036.html

Prof. T.K. Viswanathan, who taught us Jurisprudence at Law College,
wrote about "Slot Machine Justice" way back in the 1980's describing
"jurimetrics" connected with analysis of legal facts using computers. 
He then also became Member Secretary of the Law Commission.  His
lectures would make Justice Holmes or Chief Justice Marshall appear as
good old friends with a piercing analysis of their legal philosophies. 
He had a profound influence on me and his lectures on Roscoe Pound how
Law is a device for social engineering, still keep ringing in my ears.  
Porting law to computers is a very useful thing to do, and the mode for
doing that may be through ad-hocracy. 

I caught "ad-hocracy" from a link to an interview with Tim O'Reilley at
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4372728.stm : "... the thin end of
the wedge of something that science fiction writer, Corry Doctorow calls
the "ad-hocracy" - people just getting together to do stuff and make
things happen." 

While the Legal System itself is quite a complex machinery, it is only a
few people who have influenced the Law.  If anyone is interested in this
area, I could recommend the book "Men of Law" by William Seagle, who has
covered the lives of significant men from Hammurabi to Holmes. 
Hammurabi, ruled most effectively with *direct* letters to citizens:
Just imagine what he would be doing with GNU Mailman, if he makes a
visit again!  Bentham made the last most significant change in the shape
of law with his plans for codification of laws - the tools he would have
loved to use are around us only now!

The connection between Law and Artificial Intelligence, is not readily
apparent to many. Both deal with issues of representing information
around rules, to enable effective and useful computations on them, and
that is a long pending unsolved problem. Human like common-sense
reasoning is not possible without clearing the blocks preventing access
to the vast library of functions already available. I had the first
inklings of what could be a theoretically correct representation
suitable to express rules in 2000 when I coined the word "Calpp" to mean
computer aided legal procedures and proceedings and had a working model
of the representation.  Even before any coding is done, it is fairly
important that the framework that will be used to store laws are
discussed thread bare.  I'll be giving a talk on these issues at SJCE,
Mysore on 12th between 3:00 and 4:30 pm, and btw, Sakthi and Joe Steve
would also be there for the TUXEDO 05 event to give talks. 

>From a purely technical point of view, some ideas in calpp could impact
the way functions are represented in their documentations.  I am sending
a separate post on that.

The Law is common for all of us, and if you could contribute to this
field, set yourself to task!

Functions

I particularly request students and teachers  on this list to give
feedback on
this post:

Briefly about functions:

<a brief_intro to functions from Programming PHP by Rasmus Lerdorf &
Kevin Tatroe>
A function  is a named block of  code that performs a  specific task,
possibly
acting upon a set of values given to it, or parameters, and possibly
returning
a  single value.   

They improve  readability by  isolating code  that performs
specific tasks.

Functions are generally evaluated this way:

$value = function_name([ parameter, ...]);

The  number  of  parameters  a  function requires  differs  from 
function  to
function, and may even vary for the same function.

The parameters supplied to the function may be any valid expression and
should
be in the specific order expected by the function.  A function's
documentation
will tell what parameters the function expects and what values are returned
</brief_intro>
=============================================================================
Function parameters, steps and particulars::

Issues with functions:
    Parameters are not described clearly to enable automation of
computation
    There is a need to refer to documentation which may also not
disclose logic
    Functions are overloaded with steps
      different return values for different parameters
      the relationship between parameters and return values are not apparent

Soution: Represent functions logically as steps and particulars
    Function parameters become well defined when represented as steps
and particulars
    Invalid calls to the functions become redundant and reduce errors
    Well defined functions help to automate calling of functions with
appropriate parameters
    Enables easier understanding of how a function takes in and returns
values

NAME       wc - print the number of newlines, words, and bytes in files

SYNOPSIS       wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print newline, word, and byte counts for each FILE, and a total
line if
       more than one FILE is specified.  With no FILE, or when FILE is
-, read
       standard input.

       -c, --bytes              print the byte counts

       -m, --chars              print the character counts

       -l, --lines              print the newline counts

       -L, --max-line-length    print the length of the longest line

       -w, --words              print the word counts

       --help                   display this help and exit

       --version                output version information and exit

Comment:

TRY:
# wc --help -blw *.txt
# wc --version *.txt
# wc -blw *.txt

The first two calls to wc would ignore -blw *.txt

With "experience", one "knows" how to use wc.

If we  want to understand wc  better, or make  wc usable by automatons, 
it is
fairly  obvious  that   we  need  to  pay  attention  to   the  way  we 
store
representations about functions and the  parameters passed to it. This
is just
to point an issue and a  possible solution, that ought to work well. 
Students
can "prove" that they have understood  a given function, by defining the
steps
and particulars  relating to  the host  of command functions  like mv, 
ls, cp
etc. That  could make these functions  accessible to other  functions
that are
hunting for functions :)

.xdtd files are files created by xdtd Editor. XDTD editor is used to
create DTD (document type definition) files and can import and modify
externally created DTD files. DTD files are used to validate a xml
document using tools like xmllint.

I think you inference is based on the fact that kalculate is
non-free, non-opensource?

I feel you have a valid point, ILUGC should rethink on this.

Yeah, Kalculate is non-free. And I don't think ILUGC should promote it.

i happen to be the lead developer of avsap, an opensource accounting 
system available in several indian languages also. It could be 
instructive to have a debate on this topic - free vs. non-free. If the 
venue has internet connectivity, i can also demo avsap!

Pls be warned that I could be off target! I remember having a similar
problem a few years back. I think it got solved when I unchecked 'Day
light saving time' in Windows (which was checked and disabled when the
indian time zone was selected. I had to select an American zone to
enable the check box, uncheck it and then select Indian time zone).

Vague memories :-) ... so I could be wrong.

i tried copying the following file, when it was mounted async:
$ ls -h -l someone.tar
-rw-r--r--  1 arpit arpit 113M 2005-11-10 20:50 someone.tar

$ /usr/bin/time cp someone.tar /mnt/sda1
0.04user 0.60system 1:16.61elapsed 0%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (1major+149minor)pagefaults 0swaps

Although i got back the prompt after some time(1min & 16 sec to be
exact), but i saw that the LED activity continued for a long time
after that. I monitored the CPU usage using top.
After the LED activity stopped i umounted:

$ /usr/bin/time umount /dev/sda1
0.00user 0.03system 0:00.14elapsed 21%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (1major+229minor)pagefaults 0swaps

although this does prove that what Ramkumar said is correct, but
requiring 6 minutes to copy a 5.0 MB file is simply too much.

GNUPod! It absolutely  rocks. gtkpod sucks, though. You  can start off
by reading  about how  to mount  your iPod (fairly  simple if  you are
running one of the modern distros)  and then setting up GNUPod is also
as simple as following the documentation given on the site:

As long as it runs natively on Linux, it should be OK. ILUGC is after
all a Linux Users Group and anything that increases the scope of Linux
adoption should be on topic here.

Some of us are under the opinion that everything and anything that runs on
Linux should be Open Source or GPLed.
 There could be some people who might have liked Linux to be implemented in
a big way and may be willing to buy some things like this accouting package.

 In my opinion all the people of ILUGC are knowledgeble and we should know
about the other products also even if it is not GPLed or otherwise.

First explicitly state what the 'purpose of this group' is in
www.chennailug.org <http://www.chennailug.org>. Is ilugc just meant for
promoting GNU/Linux or restricted to Free Software alone? I think that
should help everyone.

Message-ID: <495e45120511110911r65d319d1k1e9c5283412425be@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

i am unable to connect to the internet for the past one week. I am
using FC4 with BSNLs Broadband connection. I have dual boot with
windows xp. I am able to connect from windows xp. During boot-up i see
message as bringing up interface ppp0  [ok] .Even
system-config-network shows the link ppp0 as active. The #route
command shows the default is set to eth0. I want it to change that to
ppp0. Can someone guide to how to do that. I tried
#route del default etho
then
#route add default ppp0

also tried with ppp0's ip instead of the interface name. Also tried
changing the /etc/default-route file. This file has only one word
eth0. I changed that to ppp0 & restarted the network services, but
didn't work. Anything i do to change the default to ppp0 but i lasts
for only a few seconds then it automatically changes back to eth0 as
default.

Further i would also like to know how to change the router username &
password. I have Huawei's smartAX MT 800. When i type 192.168.1.1 in
the browser window it says operation timed out or something like that.


thank you,

with regards,
ashwin

It seems that you are running out of space. 
Use df command to see whether you are running out of space.

IIRC its uses eth0 not ppp0. try "route add default netmask
255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.1 dev eth0"

please change eth0 to whatever is your ethernet port number

This could also happen if you mess your permissions with your own home. 
this might sound weird but sure enough..just check whether all the files 
within ur home belong to u. a 'chown' command will do. . this might 
happen when u format the root partition and reinstall any other distro 
whilst retaining the same home partition. had this issue while switching 
from fc3 to ubuntu with the same home partition

hello,

To check the file system you can use
1)$mount (or)

2)$/sbin/parted /dev/hda5 print

where /dev/hda5 is your device where the linux is mounted

you can have a look at this link.

prashant,
fdisk -l /dev/hdX where X is the name of the drive, eg a or b or c or d,
look for the partition type under id. it tells you about your partition type
:-)

Hi all,

ILUGC mailing lists have managed to clean up on top posting on the 
lists,but in return we seem to have started a new problem which is more 
irritating than top-posting.

*BOTTOM-POSTING*

A reply-technique where the poster just scrolls down to the bottom of 
the mail and write's out his reply.Please note that just by posting at 
the bottom you are not helping.What you need to do is a technique called 
"stripped-quotation".

When you reply to a mail, remove the text which is not required,which 
includes the ILUGC banner which is applied to every mail.Just make sure 
you keep only the text for which your reply will appear.

link on proper quoting: http://www.netmeister.org/news/learn2quote2.html

SK gives a good example on how this is done in his monthly mailing 
guidelines.Search through the archives for his guidelines mail or don't 
post till Dec 1 ;)

Is that all necessary (/dev/hda1      /winc   vfat  
rw,user,auto,umask=022    0     0). I am using FC4. in my /etc/fstab i
have the following entry to access my windows partition.

/dev/hda1  /windows  vfat  default

and i am able to access the files. I have always read from the dir.
though never tried writing into the dir from linux.

with regards,
ashwin

Technically yes.
But when you "post-hijack" i.e change the direction of discussion of a 
post there is no point in bottom-posting/quoting the earlier post.This 
is normally done by chnaging the subject line but still maintaining the 
older thread's subject line.

What do you want me to bottom-post against ? The fstab solution ?

Message-ID: <1131952453.31670.6.camel@mazda>

Hi all, 

I have cross compiled samba-3.0.12b for arm. When I run the smbd  on
board as:

#./smbd -D -d 5 -c /PATH/smb.conf

the process dies ..

I have checked the log.smbd file and it says:

I  have checked for this "ANSI_X3.4-1968.so" file during my "make

It is not there.. where do I find this shared libs?
Any pointer!

hi everyone,
downloaded something cool..check this out http://codewar.net/cuts/
now this software allows you to send commands and receive output from 
your computer through sms. of course this might sound lame if you have a 
bluetooth device but still for those who are still stuck with the older 
models..this might prove to be fun.

use crontab -e to edit the crontab file and schedule your "php event"
For example, crontab -e on my system looks like this:

0,15,30,45 * * * * grandfatherclock -q    # westminister chimes every quarter on your sys

0,15,30,45 * * * * /usr/local/bin/php /usr/local/apache/htdocs/calpp/src/base/heartbeat.php # phpevent


The "offline" part could be handled by the php script itself using fopen

Ilug-Hyd's Nikhil Shankar has SMSTerm -

functionality than this :)

Hello PPL,

I have a Compaq presario 2208 with SUSE 10 running on it. Intel AC 97 card 
!! HAve tried alsaconf and it says sound configured and ready to play but 
when i check the console it says NO SoundCard found.. When i try to run 
amixer or kmix or open volume control it says NO sound device found. When i 
configure it using YAST, I select the sound card and say edit the 
properties. I check quick automatic setup or Normal Setup and when i click 
next it throws an error saying the kernel module is unable to be accesed. 
INcorrect IRQ.  I thought it might be a problem with KDE buit i even tried 
GNOME.. No positive result..

I even tried deleting /etc/modprobe.d/sound and alowing alsaconf to recreate 
it.. Failure!! :((

any suggestions???? :((

Mr Nikhil Shankar (ILUG-Hyd) developed the SMSTerm. It uses the ICQ
2000 protocol to present a shell on your mobile phone, which allows
you to interact with your computer from any mobile on a GSM network.
URL: http://freshmeat.net/projects/smsterm/ (Thanks Binand)

One Day One Command 
===================

telnet -- User interface to the TELNET Protocol.

Summary:

The telnet command is used to communicate with another host using the
TELNET protocol. The telnet daemon (telnetd) must be running in the
another host to successfully connect to it.

Examples:

$ telnet localhost -- Telnet to the same computer.

$ telnet 127.0.0.1 -- Telnet to the same computer.

$ telnet MyServer 23 -- Telnet to MyServer thru Port #23.

$ telnet -l user1 MyServer -- Telnet to MyServer with UserName as 
                              user1.

$ telnet -a MyServer -- Automatic Login. Telnet to MyServer with 
                        current login name.

Read: man telnet and man telnetd

Greetings!

I would like to thank the team of "Tuxedo 2005", Sri
Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering, Mysore,
Karnataka for the opportunity and hospitality offered
during the two-day workshop held November 12-13, 2005.


Thanks to Joy, Chairman, IEEE-SJCE Student Branch for
working with me for the past one month (answering all
my queries :), and the student volunteers for taking
good care of us, and doing the needful during the
occasion. Special thanks to Dr. C. R. Venugopal
(IITB), who has taken so much initiative, and
continues to motivate SJCE students into FLOSS. Thanks
to Aanjhan, Ramanraj and Bharathi for their talks and
company. We had a good time :)

The photos taken during Tuxedo 2005 can be viewed
from:

SJCE, has Dr. C. R. Venugopal (CRV), Coordinator IIPC,
Staff Advisor, IEEE, who has guided students in the
past and continues to guide them with FLOSS. But,
again, as in any other "engineering" college in India,
the active students are only around 10 in a class of
60. Under his guidance they have done projects on
RTOS, minix and GNU/Linux, but, haven't published it.
CRV has agreed to take marketing very seriously. The
syllabus is no different from any other engineering
college. Same 6 courses, 2 so-called practicals.
Hopefully, when they become autonomous, things will
change.

HP, Bangalore selects students from SJCE to do their
free software projects. This is only for final year
students. As usual, I insisted on doing free software
projects during their course curriculum. CRV also
works closely with Texas Instruments, Bangalore in
getting projects for their students so they can get
hands-on experience.

Bharathi began day one (Saturday) with a session on
"GNU/FSF". In the afternoon, Ramanraj spoke about
"CALPP and AI". The quiz prelims and finals were
conducted the same day. 

Aanjhan spoke about "Embedded GNU/Linux" on day two
(Sunday). They had a "virtual treasure hunt" contest
for students on Sunday. I spoke on "Careers with
GNU/Linux and Free Software for Engineers" in the
afternoon. We screened the movie Revolution OS in the
evening.

Guyz, please feel free to narrate your experiences so
others will benefit from the experience too. 

We have decided to have more collaboration between
Chennai and Mysore LUGS, and probably conduct lot of
contests for students to make them do *practical*
stuff and get hands-on experience. We can plan install
fests, hack fests, coding contests etc. 

We will continue to motivate the so-called
"engineering students" into becoming engineers using
FLOSS.

Thanking you all once again,

SK

Shakthi, thanks! They look good.  Too bad you could not make it with us 
to KRS - the impressions from there are still floating around me.  KRS 
project, called Cauvery Upper Reservoir, was conceived and planned by 
Visveswaraiya, between 1910 & 1911, and finished construction in 1932 
during the reign of Krishna Raja Wodeyar IV, a before-computer era.  
Mettur Dam was also planned by Visveswaraiya and is of the 
pre-independence era.  Intelligent planning is a sine qua non for 
effective utilisation of precious water, and this project is worthy of 
emulation.  No, I do not mean we buid more dams, but to certainly do 
things so that water may be conserved and saved in tanks and reservoirs 
in appropriate ways that suit our terrain.

It was indeed such a pleasure to meet such an enthusiastic Professor, 
who received us so well, and was along with the students almost 
throughout the event.

switched my compaq to mandrake and things were ok

Hi all,

Thanks for your mails. The mandrake distribution CD given by Compaq is
not having linux2.6. It is having the lower version. I need linux2.6.
And, most of our development is based on Fedore Core 3, since it is
having Linux2.6. Is it possible for me to update the Kernel to 2.6
without affecting other functionalities?

Expecting your advice.

Regards,
Mohan

you be more specific?

> without affecting other functionalities?

mostly... but it is a bit risky to bump a major version (like 2.4 -
2.6)... the userland utilities might break... but the probability is
quite less, as the kernel usually retains backward compatibility...
tread with care still...

from what i have heard, debian/ubuntu works without hitches on most
laptops... give it a try...

it moves on...

Yes, it comes with 2.6.9-1.667 by default.

Yes. FC3 is a recent distro with a 2.6 kernel, and
hence it uses module-init-tools. So, upgrading to a
higher 2.6.y is not a problem.

Dude, 2.6 is very stable and since FC3 already has
2.6, you already have userland utilities working.

I use Linux 2.6.12 on x86 (on laptops), in x86
development environments (on desktops), on embedded
platforms (on ARM) and it rocks!

i was talking of taking a system with 2.4 userland stuff and upgrading
the kernel alone to 2.6...

Hi,
 Thanks for your reply. I was referring the the howto you mentioned for the
installation. Im configuring bridge for my setup. I have loaded tap0 and br0
before loading server. I dont know which keys to be mapped for *ca*, *cert*,
and *key* in the client config file.
 Regards,
Mohan.

Please feel free to cross link it in your websites or
wiki page.

Few people had told me that photo quality was not good
enough. I scale down the 600 KB original images down
to 30 or 40 KB using Gimp, so that people on dial-up
can retrieve them faster, relatively. Not everyone in
India is fortunate enough to be on broadband :( 

If you are interested in the original large-scale
images, I can transfer them to your computer/laptop
through USB, or I can give them to you in a CD.

Regards,

SK

Message-ID: <20051115084816.22221.qmail@web54507.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi
 
I downloaded the latest Openoffice 2.0 from Openoffice.org site. Following the insturctions, I copied the file into
 /usr/local folder of my Mandriva LE and got extracted all the *.rpm files.  As there were dependency error while trying to install those files using rpm package manager, I installed them using command option --nodep. All the rpm files got installed without any problem. 
 
Even appropriate menus got added in the desktop for launhing Openoffice writer, impress, draw, calc etc. But
when I launch the program both in KDE and Gnome it is not working. Hpourglass is active for sometime and then stops.
 
I have installed OpenOffice.org 2.0 alongside the version of OpenOffice.org 1.1.4.  However the old version Openoffice.Org 1.1.4 is perfectly working. What could be the problem? The Java Runtime Error 1.5 for Linux which is required  is already installed. I find the Openoffice.org 2.0 directory under
 /etc/opt/ 
Is it the right location where it is expected to install?
 
Hope somebody could help me to solve this problem.
 
R.Dhanagopal

Hello,

I believe, we dont have an exclusive IRC channel for our group. If we
already have one, we can update our wiki page accordingly. If we dont
have one, how productive it would be if we have one ? IMO, it would
enable our group members to contact each other. It would assist us to
conduct meetings. It would assist us to discuss & co-ordinate during
events like demo-day. Views are welcome.

NOTE: I've created a channel #ilugc in irc.freenode.net. If it sounds
fine, we can start using this channel. If we want this to be
permanent, we can register with freenode staff & I stand responsible
for this.

I meant ilugc website and wiki page. Currently, i've included the link
to your photo album in our wiki page:
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/Events

We can include the link to all other albums as well against
appropriate column in this wiki page.

In this context, you can also use 'convert' command. For example, to
resize your image to 400x400 resolution, you can run the following
command:
$ convert source.jpg -resize 400x400 dest.jpg
$ convert -help # for more detailed usage details

in this case he didnt hijack the thread - he said fc3 was not working, 
and i suggested he switch to mandrake which works well with compaq and 
he asked where to get mandrake and whether it was free

just a suggestion - there is a #linux-india channel that is very well 
supported. ppl from lugs all over india are there, and they also use 
the channel to organise their own lug stuff. Like the delhi guys used 
it to help organise freedel and bangalore guys used it to organise 
their goa meet.

Why do you  have to 'register' with freenode staff?  I mean, it sounds

Sounds great. Sure, we can use #linux-india. But, sometimes our time
may conflict with the other group. If we plan to convene a meeting, we
must ensure no other meeting is scheduled the same time. But, for me
this sounds feasible though.

Yeah, it's not a manual process. The process goes like this:

* We can access the channel and use it
* We should register our group information online, if we wish to make
it permanent
* As freenode has a backlog of months of pending online forms, it's
advised to ping any of freenode staffs frequently, thus they can push
our form up :)

Hi,
 Thanks for your suggestion. Now, I'm able to communicate between the client
and the vpn server. But cannot get in to the lan. The push option doesnt
seem to work.
 Using static key is not more secured, and I would be going for other
options at a later stage when Im confort with this static key setup.
 Regards,
Mohan.

I don't think all these things are needed. You can just register with
the ChanServ.

And you thought I didn't know about it :)

Convert does a resize of a 600 KB into 512x314 (which
I want), but, size only comes down to 130 KB. I may
have to explore the options though.

if you have an online meeting, you can always move to a specialised 
channel for that purpose - but most of the time, interaction is much 
more casual. Another thing, any even can be anounced in the topic - 
which means that out of towners will know how to schedule their visits 
to chennai. Point is, that most lug specific chat channels in India are 
dead because of poor attendance. This is the only one that is alive and 
growing (average of 35 at any given time), and its not moderated - 
except for kicking out bots and spammers.

I didnt mean it though :) I meant, you can use convert to automate
your conversion process instead of using gimp. Yeah, as you said you
can explore available options.

ssh -- OpenSSH SSH Client

Summary:

ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and

rlogin, rsh and telnet, and provide secure encrypted communications
between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network. The SSH Daemon
must be running in the Remote computer to successfully connect to it.

Examples:

$ ssh MyServer -- Connect to MyServer with current login name.

$ ssh -l user1 MyServer -- Connect to MyServer with UserName user1.

$ ssh user1@MyServer -- Same as Above.

$ ssh -c 3des MyServer -- Use 3DES encryption (Default).

$ ssh MyServer -p 22 -- Connect to MyServer thru Port #22 (Default).

$ ssh -X MyServer -- Connect to MyServer with X11 Event forwarding. 
        Using this, You can run X Applications from remote machine.

$ ssh -v MyServer -- Show more debug messages.

$ ssh MyServer 'who' -- Connect and run the `who' command in MyServer
                        and exit.

Read: man ssh

   really a great learning experience and a lot of fun too.. Gotta lot of
   Legal knowledge from Mr. Raman.. Bharathi was at his best as usual and
   Shakthi - "I need not say anything" :)

   What i would like to mention is the dedication and commitment of Dr. C. R.
   Venugopal.. GOt spell bound!!! Very rarely can one see such a faculty in a
   non IIT Environment.. Students were very enthusiastic and was really good
   to meet a lot of their alumni too.. And shakthi the photos are damn good..
   The last one especially.. I want mine :((((

Hi All,

   I need to reboot the kernel from kernel space.
 
   I tried invoking sys_call_table[__NR_reboot] from my module. 

   But it didn't work. Am I missing something ?

Thanks and Regards,
SenthilKG.

This might be more practical 

$ ssh -C -X MyServer

The compression option sure is helpful for running X apps (although it
kind of slows down normal CLI activity)

 Hi,
                                                                                  
  With regard to password policy in our concern, the passwords are to be changed by all mail-users once in a quarter, We thought of doing this with Squirrelmail with the help of Change_pass/Change Password plugin. But both doesn't seem to reflect properly with the /etc/shadow file, and this makes the user's password to expire even after they change the password using squirrelmail.
                                                                                  
  Is there any way of correcting this problem, so change in pasword with squirrelmail doesn't expire the password again.

Is it ok for you to tell what context you want to use
it in? 

You really should avoid this as much as possible,
unless, you are really sure on what you are doing. It
is important for you to use reboot from user-space.
Exceptions are when you have a hardware that does not
have any user-interface control, or when the hardware
is present in a restricted environment, not accessible
to humans.

If you really want to do this, check
drivers/char/watchdog/softdog.c. 

For such operations, usually hardware watchdogs are
used. Depending on your needs you can tweak the
watchdog.

One Day One Command 
===================

scp -- Secure remote file Copy Program.

Summary:

scp copies files between computers on a network. It uses ssh for data
transfer, & uses the same authentication & provides the same security
as ssh. The SSH Daemon must be running in the remote computer to do
the scp.

Examples:

$ scp file1 remote@MyServer:~/ -- Copy local file1 to Home Dir of
                                   the remote account on MyServer.

$ scp -p file1 remote@MyServer:~/ -- Preserves modification times, 
                   access times, and modes from the original file.

$ scp -r MyDir remote@MyServer:~/ -- Recursively copy entire MyDir.

$ scp -q file1 remote@MyServer:~/ -- Disables the default progress bar.

$ scp -v file1 remote@MyServer:~/ -- Verbose Mode.

$ scp remote@MyServer:~/file2 . -- Copy the file2 from remote account 
                                   on MyServer to the local host.

For Windows: SSH Client is Putty and SCP Client is WinSCP.

Read: man scp

Putty has its own scp client, pscp. There are several other SSH
clients for Windows, like Teraterm Pro, Vandyke SecureCRT, SSH.com and
even OpenSSH from Cygwin.

I prefer password less access to the server and instead use keys.

In Openssh implementation for v2 of ssh protocol,

On your client:
1. create an rsa/dsa key pairs with ssh-keygen
2. append the public key generated to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on your _server_
3. "ssh-agent bash" to span a new shell. ssh-agent manages your secret key.
4. "ssh-add" add the default key to the keyring
5. now ssh or scp to the remote host doesnot require any password. eg:
"ssh remote-host ls /"
6. Options for multiple server can be setup using .ssh/config  "man 5
ssh_config"

On the server side:
/etc/ssh/sshd_config should have
1. RSAAuthentication yes
2. PubkeyAuthentication yes

On windows, Pageant does the job of managing the keys for putty. The
private key has to be converted to the putty format using PuTTYgen
before it can be used.

Hi
 
I downloaded the latest Openoffice 2.0 from Openoffice.org site. Following the insturctions, I copied the file into
 /usr/local folder of my Mandriva LE and got extracted all the *.rpm files.  As there were dependency error while trying to install those files using rpm package manager, I installed them using command option --nodep. All the rpm files got installed without any problem. 
 
Even appropriate menus got added in the desktop for launhing Openoffice writer, impress, draw, calc etc. But
when I launch the program both in KDE and Gnome it is not working. Hpourglass is active for sometime and then stops.
 
I have installed OpenOffice.org 2.0 alongside the version of OpenOffice.org 1.1.4.  However the old version Openoffice.Org 1.1.4 is perfectly working. What could be the problem? The Java Runtime Error 1.5 for Linux which is required  is already installed. I find the Openoffice.org 2.0 directory under
 /etc/opt/ 
Is it the right location where it is expected to install?
 
Hope somebody could help me to solve this problem.


Hi

I removed the Openoffice2.0 rpms and reinstalled them. Now it is working in Mandriva LE . I don't know what was the for it not working earlier.

havent you posted this before? if you install using --nodep, you cannot

dont mix up your internet connection and your webserver. you cant change 
the webserver everytime you change your internet provider. BSNL dataone 
is fully linux compatible except for the change password and billing 
info.

you can get linux hosting for about 1K a year with 10 mb of space, 
control panel and basic stuff like perl, php and mysql - also unlimited 
email ids, etc etc. Register your domain - about 500 a year and you are 
ready to go

hy chilll out,,

all you need is a good and relieable braodband connection, and also ensure
that the provider is not blocking ur 80 port...

bsnl doesnt i gues...
if using a router , do port forwarding and it will work..
as far as dynamic ip is concerned...

use tools provided by noip.com <http://noip.com>
its just cool... no need toworry about ur ip anymore...
ur own webserver will be online based on ur domain name...
enjoy...

dont waste money on space, and other features...
get a good reliable broadband..
thats all

That is  a slightly bad  idea if you  truly want $browser to  gain the
so-called 'market share'.  But yeah,  when it comes to finding a means
of getting  work done,  I end  up using the  User Agent  extension for
Firefox. You don't have to necessarily use Opera just because you want
to spoof the User-Agent string.

websites coming from dynamic ips get blacklisted in a lot of places - 
often the service provider also gets blacklisted. Many isps dont accept 
mail from domains hosted on dynamic ips and list the sender and the 
domain as spam domains.

Mine is only going to be a website, not a mail host. So are there any
ISP that give static IP addresses, which are globally available (ie.
they don't use a NAT at their end.)

Hi,
 I installed openvpn using static key. It works well normally in LAN. But it
fails through the firewall.
Im running in openvpn in tcp port and have a forward rule in my firewall to
forward the packets to vpn sever in lan. Now, I cant make a connection, the
client get timed out error. Im able to ping my firewall. Apart from the
portforwarding, does it needs any other configuration to be set?

BSNL and Barathi does it i think, dont know the rates.. but they do give
static ips for some extra costs....
and if u are really going for a critical webserver...
do consider having a backup connection in case ur internet is down on one
connection.

Hi All,

"How to Run a Successful Free Software Project" by Karl Fogel, is a book
about the human side of open source development. It describes how successful
projects operate, the expectations of users and developers, and the culture
of free software. Quite Interesting to read on. Chkout this at:

Two things.

Your firewall should let through certain non-TCP/UDP traffic. If I
remember correctly, IP protocols 50 and 51.

Your VPN system should have NAT-T enabled, if your firewall also does
NAT for your VPN endpoint.

Reading again, I am not very clear about your setup. Depending on your
network, there are several configuration issues to keep in mind when
one or both of the VPN end points are behind firewalls.

Hi,
Thanks for the reply.
The client ip is a dialup and is not inside any lan. My firewall is nat
enabled. Im running vpn in tcp mode behind a firewall. As you suggested I
tried opening tcp ports 50 and 51. Still it didnt work. I get connection
timed out error from the client.
How do I make vpn nat-enabled?
 Thanks,
Mohan.

To start with, you can read my post once again. I didn't say TCP ports
50 and 51. I said IP protocols 50 and 51. There is a huge difference.

Hi,
I'm sorry. I should have noticed it.
Now I have freed up those two protocols. I didnt find any change. May be Im
missing some rules in the iptables. Can you provide the ip rule set for
this?
 Thanks and Regards,
Mohan.

I just found this:

http://www.monkey.org/openbsd/archive/misc/0409/msg01276.html

So what version of OpenVPN are you running? You need to enable NAT-T
on both the server and the clients.

OK, I just checked OpenVPN's website - they have this bit:

"OpenVPN is an SSL VPN and as such is not compatible with IPSec, L2TP, or PPTP."

All my earlier posts were assuming you were building an IPSec VPN
system. So ignore all of them. It seems to me that your problem is
that the iptables rules are unidirectional - can you post the rules
here?

I  don't  know  what you  meant  by  'clone'  (copy  from one  DVD  to
another?). If you want to get a DivX dump of a movie DVD, just do:

mplayer -dumpstream -dumpfile /path/to/file.divx dvd://1

Then, yes.  dumpstream is the way  to go. (of course,  is your mplayer
able to play the DVD as such?)

I guess, a better way would be using 'vobcopy'

How about performing a

dd if=/dev/<DVD node name> of=dvd.iso   ???

and then burning the iso image to the DVD.
Will it help?

I use openvpn in udp mode (to make it nat friendly). The external IP is
DNAT'ted to an internal server running openvpn service for the range of UDP
ports 6k-8k that I've assigned for this connection without port translation.
The service per client runs on a specific UDP port as per the config file.

In some cases, you will have to invoke the float option to take care of PAT
- if pure IP translation does not work.

Protocols 50 and 51 are not openvpn but esp and ah. Think you are mistaken
here.

Hi,
 I have recently installed FC3 in my office. The machine is connected to
Internet (broadband)/ Intrant via LAN. I tried to configure LAN in FC3, by
(manually) providing IP nos & DNS Server nos., but it is neither showing the
windows nework nor accessing the internet (even though it recognises network
card, etc.) I have tried DHCP also . Can anyone provide solution? Thanks in

What hardware? 

Post output of:

/sbin/ifconfig -a
/sbin/route -n
cat /etc/resolv.conf

Can you ping www.yahoo.com and 66.94.230.48?

Your SNAT rule should use the public IP (a.b.c.d mentioned in the DNAT rule)
as the source address to be translated to and must have source address check
for 192.168.1.127 before NAT'ting. Your current configuration will not work
as the reply is not coming from the IP that the initiating msg was sent to.

Modify
"iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -d 192.168.1.127 --dport 1194 -j SNAT
--to-source 192.168.1.1"
to
"iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -s 192.168.1.127 --sport 1194 -j SNAT
--to-source a.b.c.d:1194"

your ip has been blacklisted - if it is a dynamic ip, some jerk must 
have been doing something with it when he/she last used it (maybe 
running a mail host or a domain on it)

Two reasons.

1. ilugc list's mail server administrator has chosen to rely 100% on
the SORBS blacklist of spam sources. I consider this as a bad idea,
but individual opinions differ. It would have been a better option to
use the SORBS list as one of several indicators of a potential spam
rather than as a blacklist.

2. SORBS lists gmail's mail servers every time they notice a piece of
spam coming from gmail. The reason given is that gmail does not
include the originating IP address in the mail headers. Gmail's stance
is that including that information is akin to violating the privacy of
their client.

I, for one laud gmail's position. I have had several of these bounces
from gmail to ilugc now. One day it will be one too many, and I'll
just unsubscribe from the list.

  Not clear about your requirement. Anyway a cmd line tool called
'dialog' can be used to build message and input dialogs from shell
script. Type 'dialog' in your terminal and see its installed in your
system.

You can use checklist option in dialog box for getting multiple inputs
from user.

Ex: dialog --checklist  "Hai" 50 10 5 1 1 1 2  2 2

ya, i want to create a window with multiple input text fields.
"dialog" is working on my system but i am able to take one input only.
say `dialog --inputbox "type something" 0 0 123 2>/tmp/abc`
it is giving only one input facility.

well... dialog/zenity is meant for simple gui interactions.. the
closest `scriptable' solution i could think of, is to use the
gtk/glade bindings for perl...

it moves on...

Hi,
Thanks for the reply.
 Configuring openvpn in tcp mode doesn't seem to work. So, I changed it to
udp, and added the following three rules in my firewall.

iptables -vA FORWARD -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT
iptables -vt nat -I PREROUTING -d a.b.c.d -p udp --dport 1194 -j DNAT --to
vpn_server_ip:1194
iptables -v -I FORWARD -d vpn_server_ip -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT
 Now, Im able to make the initial connection with the server. But I cant
ping between the server (10.8.0.1 <http://10.8.0.1>) and the client (
10.8.0.2 <http://10.8.0.2>) . The server displays 'no route to host' and the
client displays the following message while I ping from the client.
 Mon Nov 21 14:59:33 2005 us=164067 NOTE: failed to obtain options
consistency in
fo from peer -- this could occur if the remote peer is running a version of
Open
VPN before 1.5-beta8 or if there is a network connectivity problem, and will
not
necessarily prevent OpenVPN from running (0 bytes received from peer, 0
bytes a
uthenticated data channel traffic) -- you can disable the options
consistency ch
eck with --disable-occ.
 Am I missing anything?
Thanks & Regards,
Mohan.

i do not laud gmail's position - for one, it is inconsistent. there are
discussions of this gmail policy in many fora. it should be noted that
gmail hides the originating ip only for mail submitted via the web
interface but passes it along (as they should) for mail sent using mail
interface, for example. obviously, the privacy of originating ip is not 
always protected. i do believe there is a workable solution - whitelisting 
all the gmail outbound mail relays. i will try to get this done. that 
should solve the problem without any policy changes.

How about using SORBS as an indicator and not as the final word in
deciding what is spam and what is not? Say with something like
Spamassassin?

Message-ID: <2bd916e50511220249x4028bcd5l1d14f95d066a9ff0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
 I have setup openvpn 2.0.5 server using static key in fedora 3. The client
is windows 2000. The setup is working perfectly in LAN.
 But it fails through firewall. My firewall is enabled for portforwarding. I
have the following iptables rules added to my firewall setup.
 iptables -A FORWARD -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -d external_ip -p udp --dport 1194 -j DNAT
--to vpn_server_ip:1194
iptables -I FORWARD -d vpn_server_ip -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT
 Im not even able to ping between the tunnels. Do I need to open additional
ports?
 Regards,
Mohan.

Hi,
Does anyone know of SNMP implementations that have a small footprint.
Googling didn't help.

There should be some kind of rule posted on the chennailug website then,
that it is forbidden to gather addresses of lug members for email
marketing purposes

Back in ilughyd any linux vendor which tried such stuff got its members
kicked off the LUG list, and a kind of informal resolution passed "we
will not buy anything from these guys"

OpenVPN does not use IKE or PPTP. This will not help. Posting what Binand
asked for makes sense.

Subject: Gaim and firefox problem.
To: ilugc@ae.iitm.ac.in

My gaim returns the following errors in the debug mode (Part of the
messages where the operation succeeded is truncated for ease of
viewing). It doesn't connect to any protocol most of the time.
Sometimes it connects properly. I had been using kopete. But kopete
lacks some features(like offline messaging, etc). So I want this
problem to be corrected.  Plz help.

Moreover, firefox also doesn't connect to the internet. For any URL,
it says Looking up host, then Connecting to host, then just sits idle
just with that message. I'm managing with konqueror. Opera also works
fine. But would like to get my firefox into action.

Had tried reinstalling gaim and firefox, tried updating with yum, etc.

I use Fedora Core 4, and HuaweiWA1003A router(Type II BSNL dataone).
But I haven't enabled the firewall in that also. I couldn't trace the
problem.

Hi all, 

I have a ULTRA ATA/133 IDE controller card that can be plugged into my
PCI slot. I can attach some IDE (hard disk) to  it.

At present I am running 2.6.12 kernel on my P4 PC.

My aim is to boot from PC and have access to the IDE (hard disk)
attached on the ATA/133 PCI slot throuhg moounting the disk.

Can anybody suggest if the approch is correct and any help or reference
or sugesstion.

Do I need to load any linux driver? I am just new to this and hoping for
sugesstion..

Thanks
Raja

So, what's the problem? I have no idea what is
configured in your current kernel. Just plug it and
check dmesg output.

Basically, you should have PCI, ATA, IDE support
enabled in the kernel. Check your dmesg.

Message-ID: <20051123120048.53331.qmail@web60311.mail.yahoo.com>

  
Hi guys [and gals, just in case]

Been searching around and have spent lots of time researching on this -
but I'm still not getting the solution. Perhaps you can help.

I'm TRYING to build a custom debian distribution based on the available packages from the SARGE tree for i386
machines. Yeah, I know, why another distro right? I understand the
arguments about it ... but just hang in there okay...

Company XYZ would like to create its own distribution with its own
selection of packages and of course its own branding. Nothing fancy
about the packages - no customisation currently. So, what they need
could be summarised as follows:

(a) Using a base PC,
- carry out a base install of Sarge Debian
- carry out installation of Desktop packages
- add/remove packages as appropriate i.e firefox, evolution, gaim etc.
- add some webserver
-  add IDE's for development
- add some services
(b) Thereafter,
- create an installer for this customised version
- create the ISO files
- write to CD or CDs as appropriate
- support, patches and updates will be via apt-get to a custom mirror

Sounds fairly doable right? Yeah, that's what I thought until I search
the Internet and found very little information about these. Everyone is
asking for stuff similar to this but till date, I have not found
something complete. I have seen the following

debian-cd
dfsbuild
debianinstaller
debiancustomcd
remaster knoppix
ibuild
progeny
linuxfromscratch


and I have in fact completed the debiancustomcd but In this i have not added any extra packages or perhaps it does but I'm simply
too blinded by tireness to notice.

Would appreciate if anyone can point me in the right direction or maybe
even provide me with the appropriate steps to take for my requirements.
Perhaps I could even promise to write-up a how-to for the benefit of the
others that are searching on the same lines ...

In summary, I guess, something along the lines of 

- install Sarge Debian for Desktop
- customize the packages
- customize the look and feel
- repackage for distribution via an installer

Can any body help me out in redistribution of Debian according to our requirements
  cheers
Mohd Omar

From: "Frederick Noronha (FN)"

http://www.justanotherperlhacker.org/lightning/

What are Lightning Talks?

Lightning Talks are sixteen five-minute talks in a ninety-minute time
slot (or eleven in a sixty-minute slot or 8 in 45 minutes). They have
become popular at the Perl conferences in the last few years.

Why Would You Want to do a Lightning Talk?

Maybe you've never given a talk before, and you'd like to start small.
For a Lightning Talk, you don't need to make slides, and if you do
decide to make slides, you only need to make three.

Maybe you're nervous and you're afraid you'll mess up. It's a lot
easier to plan and deliver a five minute talk than it is to deliver a
long talk. And if you do mess up, at least the painful part will be
over quickly.

Maybe you don't have much to say. Maybe you just want to ask a
question, or invite people to help you with your project, or boast
about something you did, or tell a short cautionary story. These
things are all interesting and worth talking about, but there might
not be enough to say about them to fill up thirty minutes.

Maybe you have a lot of things to say, and you're already going to
give a long talk on one of them, and you don't want to hog the
spotlight. There's nothing wrong with giving several Lightning Talks.
Hey, they're only five minutes.

On the other side, people might want to come to a lightning talk when
they wouldn't come to a long talk on the same subject. The risk for
the attendees is smaller: If the talk turns out to be dull, or if the
person giving the talk turns out to be a really bad speaker, well, at
least it's over in five minutes. With lightning talks, you're never
stuck in some boring lecture for forty-five minutes.

Still having trouble picking a topic, here are some suggestions:

1. Why my favorite module is X.
2. I want to do cool project X. Does anyone want to help?
3. Successful Project: I did project X. It was a success. Here's
   how you could benefit.
4. Failed Project: I did project X. It was a failure, and here's
   why.
5. Heresy: People always say X, but they're wrong. Here's why.
6. You All Suck: Here's what is wrong with the our community.
7. Call to Action: Let's all do more of X / less of X.
8. Wouldn't it be cool if X?
9. Someone needs to do X.
10. Wish List
11. Why X was a mistake.
12. Why X looks like a mistake, but isn't.
13. What it's like to do X.
14. Here's a useful technique that worked.
15. Here's a technique I thought would be useful but didn't work.
16. Why algorithm X sucks.
17. Comparison of algorithms X and Y.

Of course, you could give the talk on anything you wanted, whether or
not it is on this list. If we get a full schedule of nothing but five
minutes of ranting and raving on each topic, a good time will still be
had by most.

Bye :)

what do you mean by collaboration software? do you mean a version 
control system like cvs or subversion along with a ticket tracking 
system/wiki. Subversion + trac seems to be used by a lot of 
projects and really rocks.

Hi,

I am looking for fedora 4 for x86-64 arch. Has anyone got the dvd or the
cd's? 

I was wondering what is diffrent b/w this and the ordinary fedora
version. I mean is it just the kernel that is compiled with 64 bit
support (if thats the case cant we do that oursleves) or are all the
userland tools too compiled with 64 bit support?? Could someone
generally brief me on this.

Does this also mean that once i install the 64 bit version .. i will
need to compile all the other programs myselves (as rpms for it maynot
be available??)

Fedora is multi lib (provides both x86 and x86_64 libs ). RPM and Yum 
works understands and install these packages appropriately (lib vs 
lib64). Nearly all of the programs are under the x86-64 arch with some 
exceptions like Openffice.org which isnt 64-bit clean yet. Appropriate 
32-bit libs are installed automatically during installation and while 
using yum.

All of the programs provided in Fedora repositories (Core+Extras) is 
generally build against all the architectures maintained in Fedora (x86, 
x86_64, PPC etc).  Use yum install and groupinstall to install them.

the volume can be adjusted in gnome only and whatever volume i keep in

Plz suggest a work around.

	needed
Message-ID: <8dd9fd0511242143p410b29a4w2daec8173de3972c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I downloaded Firefox 1.5 rc3 from mozilla.org site and installed in my
Fedora Core 3 box. While using the Firefox 1.5 , I find the tamil characters
are not rendered correctly.  ( checked http://ta.openoffice.org )
Whereas i find the Firefox 1.0.6 which came as part of fedora is showing the
tamil characters correctly.

I found that firefox has to be built with complex script support to show
indic languages correctly from this website:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Enabling_complex_text_support_for_Indic_scripts

So tried building the latest version of Firefox (DeerPack 1.6a1) in my
fedora core1.
I have built Deer Pack 1.6a1 in my Fedora Core 3 box with the following
options in .mozconfig file kept under my home directory (~/.mozconfig) .

# options to build Firefox
mk_add_options MOZ_CO_PROJECT=browser
ac_add_options --enable-application=browser

# Options for 'configure' (same as command-line options).
ac_add_options --disable-accessibility
ac_add_options --disable-debug
ac_add_options --disable-freetype2
ac_add_options --disable-installer
ac_add_options --disable-jsd
ac_add_options --disable-pedantic
ac_add_options --disable-shared
ac_add_options --disable-tests

ac_add_options --enable-default-toolkit=gtk2
ac_add_options --enable-static
ac_add_options --enable-xft
ac_add_options --enable-ctl
ac_add_options --enable-xterm-updates

## processor optimization options
ac_add_options --enable-optimize="-O2"

The build completed successfully. When I browsed Tamil Language (one of the
indic group languages ) we sites, I find the text were not rendered.

Any idea what I missed in the mozconfig file ? or is there any other way I
can build the deer pack so that i can view tamil pages correctly.
Please advise.

Thanks & Regards
Mugunth

Changing the user interface font

There is no dedicated option to just change the font in the User 
Interface in OpenOffice.org versions that are based on the 641 builds 
(including OpenOffice 1.0). Nevertheless it is possible to change the 
font by the general font replacement mechanism. Select

        Tools -> Options -> OpenOffice.org -> Font Replacement
       

from the menu. Check the "Apply Replacement Table" check box. Replace 
the font

        Andale Sans UI
       

with the desired font. You probably will not find "Andale Sans UI" 
stated in the font list box of the font to be replaced but you have to 
write it manually into the "Font" field. Please choose one of the fonts 
from the dropdown list box for the "Replace with" entry. The settings 
apply immediately after pressing the "OK" button.

Message-ID: <dc538c3f0511250711v47d276c6m84db0102fba049dc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have just started a Open source Project in SourceForget.net using PHP.

Project Name: Weblook Express
URL : http://sourceforge.net/projects/weblookexpress

Idea came to me when i thought of porting the complete windows based
Desktop outlook express Application into a Portable, Web based
Application that runs on any Javascript supported webbrowser for any
POP3, or IMAP or HTTP Mail Service Providers.

I am just looking for people who can work along with me so that
complete porting occurs so that we can release the base version.

Technology to be used would be PHP, XML, XSLT, Javascript, HTML.

About Weblook Express
Weblook Express provides an integrated solution for managing and
organizing e-mail messages. It delivers innovations you can use to
manage your email communications, organize your mails - all from one
place similar like the desktop outlook express.

Project would involve complete porting of Desktop Outlook Express that
comes with Internet Explorer. The user should be able to configure
multiple Mail Service Providers. User experience is what we must see.
and i have more ideas in my mind. I also invite ideas, suggestions for
this project.

Looking for developers...

Since it is test release I think it is better to report problem in
concerned mailing list/buglist to help them solve problem

I specifically asked for USB/Ethernet combo modem from Airtel. They gave me Beetel 220BX ADSL2 + MODEM. Configuring this modem to use with linux is very easy. Everything can be setup on the device itself. After that just plug-in and start browsing.  

I think you can contact Airtel and ask for the same modem.

Well, if by Linux Bangalore you mean Bangalore LUG, then apparently
foss.in is not a LUG activity, but a corporate sponsored

Chennai LUG meets once every month, usually on the second Saturday of the month.

If only we could avoid such petty politicking and contribute more code
to OSS our reputation, as a nation, would be much better than what it
is today.

I added two more lines at the bottom of the script so that it would
help to calculate the cost.

Add the below lines after 818 line so that it would tell you exactly
the cost for Home 500 Plan

# corrected billing by balachandar m 12:26 AM 11/28/2005
# since we have 1024 MB of free usage per month
print "Corrected Billed usage: " . $usage . "KB = " . (($usage /

printf "Corrected Billed usage For Plan 500: " . (($usage /

Hi,

Is there anyone on this list who uses Common Lisp/Scheme or maybe
Emacs Lisp?  Anyone used one of the 'commercial' Lisp systems?  Or,
maybe worked on Garbage Collectors?

We (a classmate and me) are trying to work on the XEmacs garbage
collector and would like to discuss ideas with someone who is either
very familiar with Lisp or has worked on a GC in another context.

Please mail me on my personal id if this is way off-topic for this list.

Thanks in advance,
regards,

Yes correct, staying small and unnoticed from the coporate scanner will help.
The problem really stems up when a LUG has some "lucrativeness",by
that I mean when PHB's start noticing that a LUG is a good vehicle to
market their wares.

With ILUGC that's impossible.There is no corporate backing the LUG
neither is there any financial benifit of hijacking the LUG.Also not
converting the LUG into a "body/public entity" really helps.

As long as we stay true to these ideals we should be fine.What's
really important is that we should keep in mind that the community and
the fostering of it, which is more important than spreading the FLOSS
word.Create the community and the word will spread automatically.Your
word might not fall on a thousand ears but it's the ten's which
matter.

Also a big thanks is due to the ILUGC regulars. :)

Thanks guys! It's because of you I can today say "Thank God! ILUGC is
not like that".

how is it offtopic? although this is called a lug, i assume, as with 
most other lug's the topic is FLOSS rather than being restricted 
just to linux. or am i wrong? in fact in one or two lugs there is 
serious thinking on a name change to correctly reflect the 
objectives of the group

i have written emacs lisp packages.. but haven't worked on garbage
collectors as such... but well, i guess you can use the list itself to
put forth your ideas, in this thread - atleast, many would be able to
contribute, and we might gain some knowledge as well.. i hope others
don't find that objectionable...

it moves on...

Hi,

Well then, if nobody minds, here goes:

In case someone on this list is unfamiliar with this: the *emacs
editors are written as an underlying Lisp interpreter on top of which
the editor is implemented in Lisp. (More or less, this is what
happens).

The 'old' XEmacs GC is the primitive stop-and-copy type. There is a
major overhaul in process now where the allocator, and the GC are
being rewritten. The 'new' GC will be generational.

We had entered our idea for 'A New GC for XEmacs' in the RHL
open-source programming contest[1] and are now in a fix because it
seems someone (Crestani) in Germany is doing the same thing as his
Master's/PhD dissertation! So we have a fast moving target of code to
understand and to try and make modifications to.

I hoped someone who is familiar with Lisp (and its internals) would
help us understand the allocation and GC routines (which are well
written and abstracted, but is very voluminous). We'd also like to
bounce ideas on how to go about implementing new features (say, a
copying-collector). The sources are kinda intimidating at 300kloc of C
and about 300kloc of Lisp (although the GC and allocation parts are
<10kloc of C and very little lisp).

Anyone? Karra, if you are still here?

There is also a project somewhere called xulwebmail, which has an

Good feature.I think it now downloads only the diff's between the

http://spreadfirefox.com has some new campaign(Firefox Flicks) which
let's users show-off their firefox videos.Don't know if anybody will
be interested in watching homemade video's of browser's in action.

FF seems to have entered mainstream usage.But I still don't understand
why there has to be so much hype over a point-upgrade to an
application.Maybe it's just the viral marketing and the FF badge
wearing foot-soldier armies which are marching to Redmond for IE's
neck but I don't see anything in this release to get so excited about.

FF still has security issues though the turnaround time for updates is
fast.Still, you don't see Opera and Safari user's run riot over the
net each time a new point-release is announced.

Maybe I'm just an old grumpy faggot, don't know :)

You mean you use the PostgreSQL as your database backend., and CVS for
source code management? If that is the case, your wont have any issues
keeping your product non-Free. However, if you have used some source
code of CVS or PostgreSQL in your product then you'll have to abide by
the respective licenses.

things!! I am doing even without such immunity is another subject.

Let us discuss something that would benefit our nation, than trivialities
like this, is my humble opinion.

It is important that "end users" (e-n-d u-s-e-r-s)
know that RF technology is not secure enough to be
used for identification mechanisms. It is useful for
embedded system applications and in control systems,
but should not be used exclusively for authentication.


Creating an awareness is very important, and is very
much relevant to everyone, not, just our nation.

I am not at all familiar with the implementation details of the Emacs
GC.  Also, my GC fundaes are rather rusty at this time :-)  Sorry

Toufeeq,

My prescription for a corruption free world, is ban currency circulation and
make all transactions transparent on the web, for anyone to see. This is
possible, thanks to ICT. Bio-metric linked debit cards is the only solution.
Any wrong payment can be reversed at anytime, by a simple reversal of mutual
acceptance. Escrow system is the best for ensuring 100% honesty in
transactions. This would transform the world from dishonesty to honesty and
ICt would be the bandwagon for such change.

Kris.

well... perhaps the issue by itself was trivial.. but i guess the
issue it tried to convey was far more serious... i should thank this
thread for letting me know about RFID and the problems with it...
never knew much about it till now...

You can use Postgres code in your product and still make it a
closed-source one. Postgres is under the BSD license.

CVS is GPLed, but a BSD-licensed version is under development at

whoa!!

as a first and practical step, my take would be to
enable the e-filing of income taxes and all kinds of
'pay' related activities w.r.t a person using the
SSN/PAN number. I feel this would be more that an
effort to check the flow of money and other money
laundering activities. However, i presume such a step
would not be welcomed by our politicians and
bureacrats.

As always ... you are making lot of assumptions
without understanding the limitations of technology.

Subject: [Ilugc] How to create ubuntu add on CD?
Message-ID: <438DA019.80603@gmail.com>

hi,
i really suggest to keep those packages out of var and in your home

the following command will do
-----------

 dpkg-scanpackages Binary /dev/null | gzip -9c > Binary/Packages.gz
.........
just so you know....my pwd looks like this

-----------
/home/sudharsh/MyDownloads/Ubuntu Debs
-----------
all the packages are stored in a folder called Binary in Ubuntu Debs..so change all instances of 'Binary' in the command accordingly.
after this simply burn the cd with packages.gz in the root of the cdrom

regards
Sudharshan S

Message-ID: <20051130133017.44906.qmail@web54302.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,
   
  Read the information below, which i got in a mail.
   
  In unix, is time_t,  type defined from an int data type ?? Will unix based n/w applications crash during 2038? any suggestions??
   
  **********************************************************
  The Year 2038 Problem 
      Test it now.   steps...       1. login to yahoo messenger   2. send instant message to anyone - fine its working...   3. now, change ur system date to 19-Jan-2038, 03:14:07 AM or above   4. Confirm weather ur date is changed   5. again send instant message to anyone...   Your YM crahes....   ( while trying these steps close ur applications/IE ..etc 

.  my IE got corruptted and I had to reinstall )     * * * YES ALL NETWORK BASED APPLICATION WILL NOT WORK NOW * * *   Why..... 
   
  What is it?   Starting at GMT 03:14:07, Tuesday, January 19, 2038, It is expected to see lots of systems around the world breaking Magnificently. In short, many of the dire predictions for the year 2000 are much more likely to actually occur in the year 2038! Consider the year 2000 just a dry run. In case you think we can sit on this issue for another 30 years before addressing it, consider that reports of temporal echoes of the 2038 problem are already starting to appear in future date calculations for mortgages and vital statistics!   In the first month of the year 2038 C.E. many computers will encounter a date-related bug in their operating systems and/or in the applications they run. This can result in incorrect and wildly inaccurate dates being reported by the operating system and/or applications. The effect of this bug is hard to predict, because many applications are not prepared for the resulting "skip" in reported time anywhere from 1901 to a "broken record" repeat
  of the
 reported time at the second the bug occurs. Also, may make some small adjustment to the actual time the bug expresses itself. This bug to cause serious problems on many platforms, especially Unix and Unix-like platforms, because these systems will "run out of time". 
   
  What causes it?   Time_t is a data type used by C and C++ programs to represent dates and times internally. (Windows programmers out there might also recognize it as the basis for the CTime and CTimeSpan classes in MFC.)   time_t is actually just an integer (a whole number), that counts the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 at 12:00 AM Greenwich Mean Time. A time_t value of 0 would be 12:00:00 AM (exactly midnight) 1-Jan-1970, a time_t value of 1   would be 12:00:01 AM  (one second after midnight) 1-Jan-1970, etc..   some example times and their exact time_t representations:   Date & time     time_t representation   1-Jan-1970,     12:00:00 AM GMT 0   1-Jan-1970,     12:01:00 AM GMT 60   1-Jan-1970,     01:00:00 AM GMT 3 600   2-Jan-1970,     12:00:00 AM GMT 86 400   1-Jan-1971,     12:00:00 AM GMT 31 536 000   1-Jan-1972,     12:00:00 AM GMT 63 072 000   1-Jan-2038,     12:00:00 AM GMT 2 145 916 800   19-Jan-2038,    03:14:07 AM GMT 2 147 483 647   By the year 2038, 
 the
 time_t representation for the current time will be over 2 140 000 000.   And that's the problem. A modern 32-bit computer stores a "signed integer" data type, such as time_t, in 32 bits. The First of these bits is used for the positive/negative sign of the integer, while the remaining 31 bits are used to store the number itself.   The highest number these 31 data bits can store works out to exactly 2147 483 647.   A time_t value of this exact number, 2 147 483 647, represents January 19,2038, at 7 seconds past 3:14 AM Greenwich Mean Time. So, at 3:14:07 AM GMT on that fateful day, every time_t used in a 32-bit C or C++ program will reach its upper limit.   One second later, on 19-January-2038 at 3:14:08 AM GMT, disaster strikes.   When a signed integer reaches its maximum value and then gets incremented, it wraps around to its lowest possible negative value. This means a 32-bit signed integer, such as a time_t, set to its maximum value of 2 147 483 647 and then incremented b
 y 1,
 will become -2 147 483 648.   Note that "-" sign at the beginning of this large number. A time_t value of -2 147 483 648 would represent December 13, 1901 at 8:45:52 PM GMT.   So, if all goes normally, 19-January-2038 will suddenly become 13-December-1901 in every time_t across the globe, and every date calculation based on this figure will go haywire. And it gets worse. 
Most of the support functions that use the time_t data type cannot handle negative time_t values at all. They simply fail and return an error code.

  Karthik

The point is that those things may not be secure, but could be used to
impose surveillance and treat people like they were criminals or take

Upgrade to a 64-bit platform/OS?

Another interesting link is:

where the author hypothesizes that OSS will be the only software that
would have addressed the 2038 problem in a timely manner and that

only postpones the problem to some time far into future!
is there a way out of it once for all?  I feel this is more of
a design issue. A problem of trying to view date/time as
a counter. But, then I am not sure wether it would necessiate
any change in existing hardware design too. Probably yes ?

Do not under estimate the power of human beings to subvert every

What happens when the wire (or any device in between) connecting the

Postponing far into the future is quite an acceptable engineering
solution for sufficiently large values of future.

Infinity is an abstraction known only in pure mathematics; when it
comes to engineering (or applied mathematics), one has to put
practical limits on the theoretical concept of infinity, based on
design restrictions.

These outputs would help us (you can hide the static
IP if you don't want to send it to the mailing list):

/sbin/ifconfig -a
/sbin/route -n
/sbin/lsmod
cat /etc/resolv.conf

Message-ID: <20051201051635.73386.qmail@web50214.mail.yahoo.com>

This is a monthly reminder to members of this list
about the mailing list guidelines. Please don't reply
to this e-mail. If you want to update the guidelines,
do it at:

http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/List_Guidelines

1. Use a proper subject line.

2. Do not troll in the mailing list

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll

3. Do not post off-topic [OT] messages in this mailing
list. Use ilugc-non-tech@googlegroups.com instead.

4. Do not top-post:

Link: http://www.caliburn.nl/topposting.html

Example of a top-post:

A: Because it messes up the order in which 
   people normally read text.
Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
A: Top-posting.
Q: What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?

Always use bottom-posting.

Q: What is your name ?
A: My name is ILUGC.

5. Do not over-quote:

Example of an over-quote:

>>> On Friday you said
>>>  blah blah blah
>> On Saturday you said
>>  foo foo foo
> On Sunday you said
>  foobar

6. Do not post HTML messages

7. Do not recycle messages

8. Do not send attachments

9. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical legal
disclaimers. If your company uses disclaimers, don't
use your company ID for the mailing list.

10. Do not reply to a digest. (If you are in digest
mode and want to reply to a post use ILUGC Gmane blog
interface.

Link:
http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc

11. Search for answers for your questions/problems in
google.com or any other search engine before posting
your query to the mailing list.

12. Do not post messages in all capital letters. Mails
