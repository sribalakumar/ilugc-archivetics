If i were you, i will not really worry about inactive memory.

Generally the OS would utilized as much memory as required. Most of this 
would be used for cache. But when memory is required for a program this 
cache is cleared to make space.

But what sort of program looks for free memory before installing? i 
missed the initial mail.

For some very nice article on memory usage in linux, i suggest 
http://people.redhat.com/dshaks/rhel3_perf_tuning.pdf

Although the book is for 2.4 kernel most of iot applies to 2.6 kernels 
too..

The application is checking for free RAM before installation? Hmm...
Any application can check for total RAM during installation. That
makes sense. The concept of "free" memory does not exist under
UNIX/Linux. If I were you, I'd not install an application that checks
for free RAM. The guys who coded it got the basic stuff wrong - who
knows what all is in store once you install it? RAM can go missing
anytime after install, when the program is running. Well just hope
that these dudes aren't checking once in a while for "free" memory and
exiting in case there isn't enough!

Under Linux, you never run out of memory until a call to malloc()
fails. If your application is in the security arena and is trying to
use calls like mlock() to lock memory pages to RAM, then it may really
need to worry about "free" RAM pages, but not during installation.

Beware of this application.

There is no real problem with your server.  You just need to understand
how the VM works.

RAM (VM pages really) can be in the following key states:

1. active -- allocated to an application and in active use.  This RAM
should never be swapped to disk because the application is "actively"
using it.  Swapping it out to disk will only cause the VM to reload it
back into RAM and thus start thrashing swap.

2. inactive -- allocated to an application, but the app has not accessed
this memory recently.  Inactive RAM can be swapped out to disk.  If the
application touches inactive RAM, it immediately becomes active RAM
(no performance penalty).  But if the VM is out of free memory, it
allocates from inactive RAM.

3. free -- unallocated free memory that's not in use and can be readily
mapped to any application.

Note that I have used the word "application" above in a generic sense
to refer to processes, kernel pages, buffer cache, etc.


Points to take away:

1. The VM is clever enough to balance inactive and free memory.  You
should only start tweaking the VM if you face performance problems.
How much CPU time have your kscand/kswapd processes consumed?

2. Think of inactive memory as "probably free" memory.

3. Inactive memory is NOT a kernel memory leak or any other bug.  It's
the result of your environment -- processes you run and the nature of
load on the server.


If this still botheres you, consult RedHat and your application vendor
for their recommended setup.  There's stuff in /proc/sys/vm that can
be tuned to change VM behavior.



An additional note:
Applications can also override VM behavior by using mlock() and locking
memory pages into RAM so that it never gets swapped out to disk.
Applications that require near real-time response (cdrecord) use mlock()
and ensure that the process image and data never gets swapped out of
RAM.  Needless to say, you need to be root for the mlock call to
succeed.  Consult Stevens.

I quickly did an apt-cache search and found all the packages were available
on Sid too.

Wacom and IBall look like the favourites. I found out that eBay had an iBall
for 1300 and another for ~1750. Also, a Wacom for around 3000. But people on
#inkscape asked me to go with the Wacom one since it was more supported.

Can anyone recommend one. I need to use it with GIMP (and maybe Photoshop
CS3, say I have to design a PSD for my college).

Also where can I get it.

Hi,

I've been using Zend framework for a web-app, but I am not able to use
Zend in .. umm.. a "powerful" and "elegant" enough way. I'm looking
for a good tutorial on Zend Framework. Most hits I get from google,
either explains each Zend component separately (without explaining the
"big picture"), or creates for-beginners web-apps, which don't seem to
have good enough "structure".

Sigh, I'm being vague. But any suggestions on the tutorials? :)

1.       All my clients are login into the windows platform, they should automatically connect to their corresponding network share.

2.       Rights should be assigned for individual user & group

3.       In the rights option user can able to read, write & append option but delete option should be controlled by administrator.


Regards,
Karthick.V

Dear Karthick,

You can try freenas for this. Even though the undelying OS is FreeBSD.

But it is going to work well for your requirements.

Check www.freenas.org

Good Luck. Keep us informed about your progress in this regard.

Thanks Ravi,

Try www.openfiler.com this has got everything you need. But may be it is
going to be an overkill, I think.

I had a hunch Oracle was involved in this problem.  Oracle
allocates plenty of RAM but does not actively touch all the
pages.  This causes the kernel to mark the pages as inactive
and candidates for swapping to disk.

Oracle has plenty of knobs, both within Oracle as well as the
OS, that you can tweak.  Consult the docs.


On systems with huge RAM (> 16GB), kscand/kswapd can hog
CPU.  There are work arounds/patches for this problem.  Check
if your server is having this problem and needs fixing.

Have you looked at Samba?  It does all of the above.  Not sure about the 
delete option in 3 but I suppose it could be done with extended 
attributes of ext2/3 filesystem.

Message-ID: <cdc8c4430805031030s6e60e427w4335e55e8b6e418@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ilugc-ians,

I recently bought a HP printer (multi-function F4185) and took the
adventurous path of configuring the device in my home system running
Fedora 5 (running kernel v2.6.15-1, I know it's quite old).

After having trouble to make HPLIP work in my system, posted query on
their mailing list but it seems am getting the basic installation of
HPLIP not correct (as per their feedback).

FWIW, am trying to insall HPLIP from the latest source.

Is there anyone on this mailing list who have had successes with HPLIP
installation and setup in using HP printers ?

Why don't you try the much easier postscript printing?

Do you have a particular reason you want to use HP's driver?

There are some amazing postscript highlighting/formatting tools in
linux.

I once took a printout of C code and RFC documents for offline reading
and my printout had so much sex appeal since I knew how to use a2ps(1).

Thanks, I tried it immediately after seeing the reply, installationa
of a2ps was fine, no problems. But after I issue the command to print
a specific file I see no response on the printer end.

Verified the printer settings from my Fedora 5 system, it shows the
printer belonging to class HP5150 (I think this comes from the
previous HPLIP installation), should I remove this ?

Here is a transcript of the commands:

[root@thinnai ~]# a2ps -v -o bin/checkuser.ps bin/checkuser.sh
[bin/checkuser.sh (Bourne Shell): 1 page on 1 sheet]
[Total: 1 page on 1 sheet] saved into the file `bin/checkuser.ps'

[root@thinnai ~]# a2ps bin/checkuser.ps
[bin/checkuser.ps (ps, delegated to PsNup): 1 page on 1 sheet]
request id is d4185-printer-2 (1 file(s))
[Total: 2 pages on 1 sheet] sent to the default printer

Special features of some printers may not work with a2ps... Also, if you have 
a combined printer-scanner, you'll pretty much need the hp drivers for the 
scanner - makes sense to go whole hog with it.

The mouse is really uncomfortable for making strokes and lines. I am quite

Sorry I never meant to use a2ps(1) directly.

I have never done it.

You have to use LPRng. I had replied about this long ago. Search the
archives if you have time.

I think you have to simply

$ export PRINTER=lp@192.168.1.5

if that is the PRINTER's IP.

And 

$ a2ps -o foo.ps <<<other flags here>>> input.txt

And simply

$ lpr foo.ps

But if you want scanning functionality you would require the driver.

Even for scanning there is an open source program. I don't remember the
name as I have never used a scanner.

I remember, a binary tar file was available for download too. Why
don't you try that one. Forget the RPM. If you still want to debug
what is happening with your hung RPM command, please prefix your "rpm"
command with "strace" and post the output here.

There are many commercial plugins available to achieve this, majority of
which  are for windows, and ofcourse they come with pricetags attached
to them.

One simple way I would sugest, and which I have used, is to use audacity
 to record the skype conversations. The results have not been greatest,
but it can get you working. You might want to do some tweaking to get
better results. Install audacity, start skype calls, and start push the
record button, thats all to it to get started with recording calls.

FYI,

"Ida Systems Pvt Ltd will be reselling the Neo Freerunner in India.
After careful consideration the the Retail Price in India has been
fixed at Rs 20000/-.  This includes all taxes, shipping to your
address, 30 days return and one year warranty. We are hoping to be
able to ship the Freerunners to customers by end May. For more
information please email sales at idasystems.net.

There are still a few slots left in our inaugural offer for the first
40 orders of Freerunner at Rs 15399/-. Please mail me at rakshat at
idasystems.net if you would like to pre-book and avail the offer." [1]

Considering the import duties levied for electronics and hardware in
India, and to provide four RF components for this price is quite good
IMO. INR 15k is quite affordable to the folks working in the Industry
in India.

No, I don't work for Ida Systems.

Formatting would give you the major benefits but you don't have to do 
that necessarily.  Ext4 is backward compatible. You can mount a existing 
Ext3 partition with additional parameters and future writes will be in 
Ext4 format but this also means you can't go back and not lose the new 
files.

Also note that Ext4 support in the kernel and within distributions ( 
development versions, Fedora 9 etc) is considered experimental since 
user space integration is still incomplete.

Subject: [Ilugc] Where is /dev/eth0 in Hardy
Message-ID: <4822ACB8.2050702@gmail.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

A Newbie question. curious to know more about networking. When I digging
into my new hardy, I didn't see /dev/eth0 file. But everything works
perfectly. below are some findings.

mohan@mohan-laptop:~$ lspci | grep 'Ethernet'

But,

mohan@mohan-laptop:~$ cat proc/devices | grep eth*
cat: proc/devices: No such file or directory

and

mohan@mohan-laptop:~$ find /dev -name '*eth*'
mohan@mohan-laptop:~$

gives nothing about eth0 interface. but /sys tells the different story,

mohan@mohan-laptop:~$ find /sys -name '*eth*'
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0a.0/net/eth0
/sys/bus/pci/drivers/forcedeth

mohan@mohan-laptop:~$ udevinfo --attribute-walk
- --path=/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:0a.0/net/eth0

Udevinfo starts with the device specified by the devpath and then
walks up the chain of parent devices. It prints for every device
found, all possible attributes in the udev rules key format.
A rule to match, can be composed by the attributes of the device
and the attributes from one single parent device.

In /dev/net there is on 'tun' interface. But `udevinfo` tells nothing
about it.

mohan@mohan-laptop:~$ udevinfo --query=all --name=/dev/net/tun
node name not found
mohan@mohan-laptop:~$ ls /dev/net/
tun

I am confused with these informations. I googled to know more about
tun/tap But my knowledge in networking is not enough to grab it. It will
be helpful to me if gurus in our mailing-list teach me (or guide me to
some links) how the networking subsystem in 2.6 kernal works( in layman
term).

Thanks in advance.

Are u searching ARM7 or ARM9 board. For ARM9, I cant find any good dealer in
India. Some dealers are selling for more than 15k/-. But from abroad, you
can get only for 250$ include tax and shipping charges.
visit this site, http://www.kwikbyte.com/KB9202.html
http://www.olimex.com/dev/index.html
This is an indian company, http://www.spjsystems.com/
http://www.fudantech.com/cp5.asp
Better order from abroad.
For ARM 7, You may prefer SPJ systems.

AFAIK, No one is selling the board for development here. Bcoz 
it is very costly (~20K) and less market. Options are

1. Ask your friends to buy it from US.
2. Catch the ARM distributor in Chennai, thru them try to get the 
   board. In prv exp, they are not willing to spend time to help 
   students and cost is also too high.

JTAG is the processor interface for in-circuit debugging. Most of the
JTAG based debugger/emulator are very costly (~75K).

ext4 is still very experimental - and make sure e2fsprogs / userspace is

Yes it is more expensive in India but 2 options which worked for me-

Technologic systems has a distributor in Hyderabad - Analogic Systems
They sell the TS-7300 (200 Mhz ARM 9, 32 MB RAM, 800X600VGA, 2USB,
2Ethernet,  55DIO, 9 COM ports, 2 SD card slots and user programmable FPGA)
for about 14K. This might be expensive for hobby, but for business it is a
good deal! This is also available ex-stock in India.
If you need, I have the complete debian based dev tool chain in a SD card
for this.

Advantech has a lot of distributors in India for
x86 based Geode Single Board Computers.
Very simple to use, very familiar x86 environment.
Has a 300 Mhz processor with VGA, 2 USB, 1 Ethernet, Parallel Port and 2
serial ports. Can even connect an IDE to boot. Default boot is from Compact
Flash. I am able to run X without any problems.
This sells for around 13K. 'Damn small linux' works brilliantly in this.

Arun

gumstix boards [1] start from $99. If you add 70% of the board price
for shipping+tax, it comes to $170. You might also want to look at:

Dear Friends,

We had our LDD some time way back. Any idea when the next LDD is?.
LDD is a source of Knowledge awakening exercise. Nice to have one in
the near future.

Add your thoughts please

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

cd -- Change the Current Directory

Summary: 

cd is bash shell's built-in command. It is used to change the present
working Dir to specific Dir.

Examples:

$ cd -- Change the current Dir to $HOME ($HOME is the default).

$ cd ~ -- Same as above.

$ cd ~bharathi -- Goto the Home Dir of bharathi.

$ cd myprj -- Change the current Dir to myprj.

$ cd .. -- Goto the parent Dir.

$ cd -  -- Goto the last visited Dir.

TIP: 

CDPATH - Easy access to frequently used Dirs. For example, I use
/usr/a/dir1, /usr/b/dir2/ and /usr/c/dir3 folders very frequently.
So I added the above dirs in CDPATH like this

$ export CDPATH=/usr/a/dir1/:/usr/b/dir2/:/usr/c/dir3/

Now there is no need for me to type exact path to cd. Just cd dir1
will cd to /usr/a/dir1. Actually cd will looks into CDPATH before
doing the action.

Note:
1) Before changing to new path, cd will save the old path in the 
   $OLDPWD evn variable.
2) After changing to new path, cd will save the new path in the $PWD 
   env variable.

Read: help cd

iostat show the live status from /proc.
sar - collect and save the status for off-line processing.

Read the man pages of iostat and sar.

Subject: [Ilugc] Switching between sets of keybindings in vim
Message-ID: <1210341504.1542.35.camel@vimzard>

There are times where I want to switch between an entire set of
keybindings/commands depending on the type of file I'm editing. For
example, if I'm using C/C++, I'd like to (hypothetically) have a
shortkey <C-f> to create an for loop block as such:
for (i=0;i<b;i++) {
?<TAB>
}

But in python, I'd like it to do;
for i in range (b):
<TAB>

or it's equivalently for bash or any other language.

I'm wondering how I would do this with Vim.

Another thing I'd like to do is create a generic function to insert
snippets like <C-I>f would insert a for loop, <C-I>i a if block, etc. My
doubt is how to send the 'f', 'i' as arguments to a vim function, and in
the function how to access the filetype, etc.

It won't unless you mount the partitions and make changes to it. You
could even write to the mounted partition without any problems. Just be
careful before deleting anything and you should be totally safe.
And I am assuming you people won't touch any partitioning tools from the
live cd.

UbuntuStudio is targeted for multimedia users and IIRC it has a low 
latency kernel. Xubuntu comes with XFce as the default desktop.  Never 
heard of Goubuntu distro. From the site, it looks more like a team to 
help the Ubuntu effort.

to be precise, gobuntu includes truely free software. It would not 
include anything that does not fully comply with four freedoms  viz.  
use, study, modify, and redistribute. The list of components that  it 
would not include goes from firmwares, drivers  to restricted/non free 
applications.  Its a free software distribution , and good for the folks 
who want to build products on free software stack and don't want to 
worry about someone raising with any licensing issues in future.

The OP mentions "Goubuntu" and not "Gobuntu."  Maybe he intended to say 
Gobuntu.  However, both exist.

Some vim scripting can take you places.

I have no exact answer for your question as I have not wanted what you
want so far.

How about asking this in a vim specific list? There will be many gurus
there.

I do know some vim scripting but it is quite rusty right now.

the error indicate that No such file or directory but the files are

I've found this amazing plugin: SnippetsEmu which does what I want and
so much more (thanks to Vimal for pointing it out to me). Thank god the
code is open, so I'll be hacking through it to learn something. Can you
point me to some good vimscripting tutorials perhaps?

You can do this with filetype plugins. These are plugins that are
loaded only when a particular filetype is being edited.

Basically, you put whatever filetype specific commands you want in the
file ~/.vim/ftplugin/<filetype>.vim

where <filetype> is the filetype, eg c.vim for c files, python.vim for python.


See :help filetype and :help filetype-plugins

Check out the vim scripts page on www.vim.org. A _lot_ of scripts
already exist which do exactly what you're asking.

hi,

at today's lug meeting I wanted to give a live demo of digital  
mapping with gps after my talk. But I found that I just could not  
acquire any satellites within the IIT campus. Max lock I could get  
was 15 seconds. The moment I left the campus, my instrument behaved  
normally. This leads me to wonder if IITM is blocking gps. If so,  
why? There are countries like China and Cuba where mapping by  
citizens is illegal - but the last time I looked, IITM was in India.  
so wtf?

\--

1. Did you walk with your device outside the building or did you try
it from inside? You are not going to get consistent signals from
inside the building. You could try to go near the window(s).

2. Which device are you using? What is its Time To First Fix (TTFF)?

3. What was your TTFF [1] when you received the signals?

4. How many satellites did you receiver pick, when it did?

I doubt if IIT-M has GPS jammers.

from MIT, Chromepet to IIt gate I had perfect signal. On the flyover  
opposite IIT gate, I lost the signal, but got it back at Madhya  
Kailash. Again lost the signal on entering the campus. Both before  
the meeting and after it, I walked around outside and tried to  
acquire. For about 15-30 seconds I was able to acquire 3 satellites.  
After that nothing. Again from tenet building to the exit gate, no  
signal. When I left IIT and reached Raj Bhavan I got the signal back  
and was getting 5-6 satellites all the way back to Chromepet.

garmin 72. In Chennai, cold start takes about 2 minutes for a fix.  
Warm start is about 30 seconds. Bangalore takes a little longer. In  
Ooty it is less than a second.

Dear Friends,

I am a teacher in a government school in Viluppuram. We have received
computers with Linux installed as part of ELCOT initiative. We face many
problems in using the systems to teach our students.

Would be grateful, if anyone in Vilupuram area will visit our school and
help us start using the computers.

Best regards,

Well,
I am also a teacher , handling CS for Higher Secondary,

Since Govt schools got SuSE linux, you have to introduce to the students 
about SuSE
For the students , it is learning for the First Time,   where us, we 
have started from DOS, Unix then GUI at Win 3.1  Win 98,....WinXp ,
So it is easy for the students to learn Linux as first timer.

Then , Our learning system makes us to teach "Based on Book Content"   [ 
The actual teaching should not based on book content ]
So, here are my suggestions.

# For C and C++, use "gcc" compiler, along with editors [ just Google , 
you will get better understanding.]
[ if you have any trouble, i will send you a simple presentation file, 
where you can catch it ]

# For Star Office, use OpenOffice.
# For Electroni Work Bench, use "Logisim"  [ search , download, install ]
# For HTML, use simple Editors
# For Windows XP , .......nothing to learn.

have a nice day

Can we, in ILUGC, take turns to visit the site and help out these folks ?

If anyone is willing to join me, we can plan for our first visit next
weekend (weekdays it's not possible for me due to commitments in day
work). Of course, the teachers and students should be available during
our weekend visit.

Hi,

It was also proposed that there will be training to the staffs by
ELCOT and it appeared that they outsourced it to some one.

What's the Status?

Being may, Its likely that all schools around will be having Holidays.
Will it be possible for you to convene a meeting of all Staffs in and
around Vilupuram to assemble, on one day.

Hope everyone will be facing similar issues. That will make it even easier.

  Not sure if this is widely known, but there's a VM from Sun that has
been recently open-sourced under a variety of licenses. It runs on
a wide variety of Linux distros, including Fedora, Ubuntu, RHEL,
etc. as host OSes, as well as Solaris and Windoze. As guest
OSes, it supports everything from DOS/Windoze/Linux-2.4/Linux-2.6/
*BSD/Solaris/MacOS-X/etc.

  It's probably the least expensive way to try out MacOS X on a
stock x86 or x86-64 box. Give it a spin, it's called VirtualBox.

VirtualBox was already dual licensed and available under a open source 
license before Sun bought it, FYI.

Certainly odd  news. The GPS C/A receive signal is at 1575 MHz,
which can face interference from certain kinds of microwave ovens
and microwave devices. But my simple guess is that the tree cover
at IITM is causing too much attenuation of the signal from the
satellites at low elevations from the horizon. I've seen this behaviour
before from Garmin units - they need a clear line-of-sight to
the satellites for optimal performance.

Rahul,
          Thanks for the info - I was unaware of its existence, leave
alone its licensing terms, until a few days ago. Anyway, the more the
merrier - qemu, Xen, dosemu, dosbox, VirtualBox, ...

MIT has a much heavier tree cover than IIT - but I dont have this  
problem there. And I moved into an open space and tried for around 15  
minutes. Solution is simple, can someone else try?

It is very difficult to convince every-one to come to single place
on holiday that too with-out TA,DA, ...:) My suggection is invite
the OP to NRC-FOSS to spend few days over there to understand the
basics of "SUSE" Distro.

I did an online upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04 (Night Unlimited Broadband 
plan helps).  Under 7.10 I updated all the packages installed in my 
system.  The update manager has an option to upgrade to 8.10.  Clicking 
on the "upgrade" button will initiate download of relevant packages.  
In my case, the first attempt got botched; the second attempt was 
successful.  My system is now Ubuntu 8.10.

The frequency sounds too low and that would cause all sorts of
propagation problems.

I believe there are various factors at play here.

Firstly as Sivachander suggested vegetation is a big problem. And for
certain frequencies, the moisture/rain/weather etc.

Secondly GPS satellites are not geostationary (Am I wrong?). So their
orbits may not be favorable at certain times.

IOW testing it during a hot summer day and collecting multiple samples
might help.

I am a teacher in a government school in Viluppuram. We have received
computers with Linux installed as part of ELCOT initiative. We face many
problems in using the systems to teach our students.

Would be grateful, if anyone in Vilupuram area will visit our school and
help us start using the computers.

Well,
I am also a teacher , handling CS for Higher Secondary,

Since Govt schools got SuSE linux, you have to introduce to the students
about SuSE
For the students , it is learning for the First Time,   whereas, we have
started from DOS, Unix then GUI at Win 3.1  Win 98,....WinXp, Vista etc... ,
leads to comparison than learning. Eventually , it is easy for the students
to learn Linux as first timer.

Then , Our learning system makes us to teach "As it is in the Book"   [ The
actual teaching should not be "as is" ]

So, here are my suggestions.

# For C and C++, use "gcc" compiler, along with editors [ just Google , you
will get better understanding.]
[ if you have any trouble, i will send you a simple presentation to give
basic idea ]
# For Star Office, use OpenOffice.
# For Electroni Work Bench, use "Logisim"  [ search , download, install ]
# For HTML, use simple Editors
# For Windows XP , .......leave it to the students, they will understand.


have a nice day

I think the instructions on the web site are probably misleading.
Perhaps it is necessary for you to boot from the cdrom to follow
them.

Normally one should not need to boot from a CD to upgrade an existing
GNU/Linux installation (at least Debian/Ubuntu). As Arun Khan has
pointed out you can just use the upgrade option for the update tool.

However, if you have taken the trouble to download and burn the CD then
you may want to use this approach. Boot from the CD and then follow
the instructions on the web site.

Regards,

Kapil.

Friends,

The mail was typed in by me when I was in Vilupuram on May 12, 2008 to
participate in a Valaipadhivar Pattarai.

We helped the participants to create Email accounts, blogger accounts and
learn to read and write in Tamil. Towards the end of the day, I started
talking about Tamil operating systems and brought up Linux.

Atleast half a dozen persons immediately started showing interest. Mr.
Senthil is one of them.

Schools have received computers, no one to teach them how to use. They want
to install Windows if possible. The department says, you do whatever you
want, we will not question. But the teachers are not taking any risks. In
many places computers are kept unused.

I am sure similar conditions prevail in other parts of the state also. I
suggested to Mr. Senthil to send a mail to ILUGC and typed the gp message
from his email account (newly created).

Mr. Senthil promised that he will arrange a meeting of teachers from all the
schools in the area for a training session. I have suggested that we can
solve their problems in one or two sittings and get the computers working in
the schools.

I am not sure, whether he is conversant with emails and mailing list
communications. We need to do something before the new school year begins.

Best regards,

Ma Sivakumar

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

touch - Change File Timestamps

Summary : 

Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current
time. If FILE not exist, then it will create an empty file with that
name.

Examples :

$ touch myfile -- Set the time stamp to current time.

$ touch -c myfile -- Same as above. But if myfile not exist, then
                     it won't create it.

$ touch -r f1 f2 -- Set f1's time to f2 instead of current time.

$ touch -r f1 -B 5 f2 -- Set f2's time to 5 secs older then f1.

$ touch -r f1 -F 5 f2 -- Set f2's time to 5 secs newer then f1.

$ touch -a myfile -- Change only access time.

$ touch -m myfile -- Change only the modification time.

$ touch -t 200412251122.33 -- Set this time instead of current time.

$ ls -lu myfile -- Shows the last access time.

Yes. At an altitude of 20,000 km compared to 36,000 km for a
geostationary satellite. So, you need inputs from a series of
satellites to determine the receiver position.

I have checked with Ms. Nirmala, HoD /CSE of IFET, Villupuram. She is
willing to help out, but is busy with some official work for next 2-3 days.
I have also requested her to consider organizing a 2-3 day FOSS workshop for
school teachers in that area in her college. We should be able to convince
the management too.

If I could get the Villupuram school contact numbers / names, I could put
them on to Ms. Nirmala to initiate direct interaction.

Any other suggestions for NRCFOSS/ILUG-C joint actions are also welcome.

in the meantime,  we can take up Bharathi's suggestion. We could organize a
few days' training session for  2-3 lecturers at NRCFOSS, AU-KBC Research
Center.

we are also planning some training programme (towards last week of May) at
Anna Univ, Trichy. Can give you a clear picture about it in a few days.

If I could get in touch with Mr. Senthil and other teachers, we could
organize some useful activity.

Use this:
    gksu "sh /media/cdrom/cdromupgrade"

It worked for me.

Mohan, Ramanathan

I also told Mr. Senthil that if he can arrange a group of teachers, I will
travel to Vilupuram this Sunday for the first session. If we can go as a
group, it would be very effective.

I am trying to contact Mr. Senthil through the people who organized the
Padhivar Pattarai. I will send the contact details as soon as I get them.

anbudan,

Yes Sir.

I will get the contact details of Mr. Senthil and other teachers. They all
took my cards and phone numbers, I was in a hurry to leave and did not take
their numbers :-(. Hope to get them by this evening.

Mr. Senthil (9842377002) telephoned me. He said that, discussing with CEO,
he will try to arrange a training session for teachers in the district
during the first week of June (after schools reopen).

I told him that others from ILUGS and NRCFOSS might contact him for making
plans.

As immediate activity, he is eager to put the computers in their school (Sri
Nataraja Middle School) into use. Let us make further plans and visit
Viluppuram this weekend. Teachers from other nearby schools may also come
for training.

Did you edit grub.conf? Looks like a module signing issue. I believe all 
the modules are automatically signed by the kernel during the build 
process. If you ar egetting this error, most probably reason might be a 
wrong initrd file being loaded for the kernel in question.

ubuntu studio uses rt kernel builld sand *ubuntu uses generic kernel.

uname -r in ubuntu studio to know the difference.

I didn't find ubuntu studio much appealing. Infact, ubuntu detected my mic and sound more appropriately than studio version did.

The OP mentions "Goubuntu" and not "Gobuntu."  Maybe he intended to say 
Gobuntu.  However, both exist.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

ulimit - Control the resources available to processes

Summary: 

ulimit, Bash built-in command, provides control over the resources
(Virtual Mem, Max no .of process, Core file size, ...) available to
processes started by the shell.

For example, If max no. of user process is set to 5, then that
particular user can't run more then 5 process.

Examples:

$ ulimit -a -- Show All current limits.

$ ulimit -c -- Show core file size.

$ ulimit -c 1000 -- Set new core file size.

$ ulimit -u 5 -- Set max no .of user processes

$ ulimit -n -- Show max open files.

Read: help ulimit

 Same with me. All of a sudden my account was deleted. I had a lot of non

Hi,

Its a good initiative.  Is there any long term plan for guiding the
students.  I would be interested to know the details like what project can
we suggest to the student, what are the key requirements etc.

Message-ID: <c9ea6e770805130810o4d76a1c3y7469ec16b2d72e0d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I installed edubuntu fiesty, and later on forgot the password.  In a guess,
i tried in recovery mode, and i got the shell prompt.  I attempted to edit
the passwd and shadow file, and to my surprise i was able to update it.
Then later on i rebooted and logged in normal way.

now i am wondering, that the security of the system would be compromised.

is ubuntu devised in such a way?  Or is there any other way to protect the
system?

I think this method of password recovery works on several
distributions; wherein you can boot into single user mode and recover
your password. While there may be ways to switch this off, real
security is only if you make your system physically inaccessible to
others. For all you know, even if you do switch this off, someone can
come with a Live CD and achieve the same effect, right? :-)

However, I would also be interested in knowing a way to switch this off.

Thanks.

If you have physical access to the system, the only real security is to 
encrypt your filesystem. IIRC, this is supported during installation.

But whatever encryption you provide, anyone with access to the
hardware is capable of destroying your data. The operating system
security is only about cutting off 'soft' attacks on the system.

That's a different kind of security you are talking about. I was 
referring to preventing unauthorized access. If you are worried about 
security in the sense of preventing data loss, you would do backups 
obviously.

Hi,
IMO it will be better to leave the choice of doing what project they
want to do,i think our role here is to show the difference between
cathedral and the bazaar style  of development models.

Mr.Baskar was initiating the thought process for the students to make
up their mind in deciding what project they will be doing. In a crowd
of around 70 approx there were interesting topics which were mentioned
 by the students..

Mr.Baskar was telling about the upcoming GSoC member and debian dev
developer meet which is there around the corner.

Subject: [Ilugc] [X-post]: [OT] HDD size errors (BIOS?) (longer than usual
	email)
Message-ID: <41100.55595.qm@web63415.mail.re1.yahoo.com>

List,

I have a very odd hardware problem, and I cannot
guess, which hardware is at fault. 
(It might turn up to be a BIOS problem too, but read
on to help me out, if you can)

I have a SAMSUNG HDD, 80 GB, and everytime I power my
system up, the BIOS shows up the disk space as 33280MB
(32/33 GB approx) of HDD space, leading to GRUB also
failing to recognize the partition to boot from (or
at-least display the GRUB menu).

To actually determine what the problem is, I pop in a
LIVE CD, which should automatically mount FAT32
partitions but doesn't. So, I start a terminal and
mount them manually. I restart the machine, and voila!
the BIOS now detects the HDD as a 80 GB HDD, and the
grub menu is seen. 
If I later, shutdown the computer (with AC supply
still in) this configuration of 80 GB is lost. It
again shows up 332xx MB (32/33 GB approx) in the BIOS
and I have to reboot it through the LIVE CD and do
everything all again. Though I don't mind doing this,
I guess, it is simply a (machine) killer for the
DVD+-RW drive that I have recently purchased. 

I initially assumed it to be a problem with the Data
Cable, but it isn't so. 
Next, I assumed it to be a problem with the HDD
itself, but that is unlikely, since once it boots,
there are no problems. The partitions don't throw
Filesystem errors. 
Third, I assume it to be a problem with the motherboad
(the /bridges/ ?), but that too is *very* unlikely,
since, once the 80 GB is detected, it works without
problems. 
So, it could be a BIOS problem, but can anyone confirm
on this? If I have to upgrade my BIOS (2002 version, I
guess) I think, it is a very risky thing to do (that's
what manuals say). 

How do I further go about analysing or solving this
problem? 
Is the Linux kernel able to invoke some hardware that
reports the size to the BIOS which has failed?

What is the BIOS setting for the hdd?  AUTO?  What other options does 
the bios have for the hdd settings?  Can you set the C/H/S values 
manually?

Has the manufacturer released any BIOS updates for your mobo?  If so, 
read what problem(s) it is solving and upgrade only if it provides a 
fix for your problem.  Make sure your system is powered by a "working" 
UPS while you flash the new BIOS.

Put this disk into a newer system and see if it exhibits the same 
symptoms.

Your mail is pretty good.

It is due to BIOS doing CHS addressing instead of LBA addressing. I have
seen this problem before. (I dunno if the reasoning is correct but
at least it seems so). The BIOS is too old and so is the hardware. ;)

But I never solved it. ;)

I didn't have to. Went for a faster newer machine and graduates from IDE
to SATA.

Have you tried changing addressing mode in the BIOS?

I had a 40G disk that was always reported as 33 GB.

And remember. If the BIOS does not set up things for you the OS cannot
doc much.

I don't follow how your liveCD changes things on the next boot.

Hello,

I am posting this here as it should receive wide exposure.

http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html

The bottom line(s):
 1. If you run a Debian or derivative (yes, Ubuntu!) version
    that is based on etch or later,
and
 2a. If you generated an SSH/SSL key on this system 
 or
 2b. You created a signature using a openssl DSA key on this
     system

Then it is likely that your key is weak/compromised. Please change
it after installing a more recent "openssl".

This does *not* apply to GPG/PGP keys.

Regards,

Kapil.

There are two different things you are mixing here:
 1. Single user mode obtained by boot option "single"
    In this case the user *is* prompted for a password
    for the default installation of most systems (for example
    Debian).
 2. Shell mode obtained by the boot option "init=/bin/sh".
    In this case the regular "init" is not run.

> However, I would also be interested in knowing a way to switch this off.

Conjunction of the following:

 A. Use a BIOS password to disable booting except from your
    regular boot device.
    
 B. Use a grub password to prevent the selection of any boot
    option except the standard one.

 C. Use disk encryption "cryptsetup" to prevent someone from
    accessing your hard disk physically.

(A) and (B) can also be replaced by

 D. Always use a CD/USB to boot the system. This way the system
 cannot be hard rebooted without your presence. For soft reboot
 use "kexec" which does not require the BIOS/grub.

Regards,

Kapil.

On reading your mail it looks very much like a BIOS problem. 
Most probably, the "auto" HDD configuration in your BIOS
settings is not working.

The live CD "kicks" the HDD system and it then acquires
its "correct" settings. After that a soft reboot will work.

Diagnosing this problem is probably difficult. Ask a local hardware
expert to look over the cabling.

Kapil.

For Ubuntu Users, here is something to follow and be safe - 
http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2008/05/13/openssh-openssh-vulnerabilities-confirm-fix-instructions/

It is suggested to update your system with the fix available in the 
repos and regenerate both your user and server SSH keys. It's a PITA 
updating the places where you have added your keys to authorized_keys ,  
but it's for your own safety :)

Check the jumpers on your HDD.  There's a 32GB Clip Limit setting
jumper that needs to be changed.

Google  "hdd 32gb limit jumper" for details.

Not really.  In addition to BIOS data, the the kernel IDE drivers do their own
hardware detection/probing.

Try disabling your secondary HDD and CDROM drives in BIOS.  The kernel
will still detect and use these devices as usual.

$ sort myfile -o myoutput -- Sort the myfile content 
                             and store in "myoutput"

$ sort -b myfile -- Ignore the leading blanks and sort.

$ sort -br myfile -- Same as above but in reverse order

$ sort -c myfile -- Only Check whether myfile is already 
                    sorted

$ sort -f myfile -- Ignore the case and sort (a == A)

$ sort -u myfile -- Sort and output only unique lines

$ sort -t : -k 2,2n -k 5.3,5.4 myfile 
     -- Sort numerically on the 2nd field and resolve 
        ties by sorting alphabetically on the 3rd and

DVD plus shipping cost of 35.

What about shouting in the list? Is it also in the "RFC 1855"?

admins are permitted to shout - are you by any chance advocating top  
posting?

If admins themselves need to bend the rules, then how can we expect
members to follow? That does not mean I'm advocating top posting. In
the same way top posting is irrittating, shouting is also irrittating.

Since we are seeing too many "top-posting" and "not removing unwanted text" mails in the list, it is good to use the same weapon(RFC 1855 violation) to teach them... It reminds me the Tamil proverb - "To take out thorn, use  thorn"

Thanks.  Basically, even though the students are interested, they are
handicapped because of lack of basic skills required for a foss project.

Some example i can quote are:
  * Lack of knowledge of SVN.  (its one of basic operations in any FOSS
project)
  * Lack of knowledge of IRC
  * Lack of knowledge of Colloboration softwares. (like wiki, Project
Management etc)

So, we need to build a few skilled persons in the college, if we intend to
encourage students to take up projects in FOSS.

Regards,
Senthil

Ok.. here it goes again... While everyone is looking for being part of 
community, getting more people to actually participate, why are we 
struck in this archaic mode of making rules that no one except a few 
really cares about? I freely admit that I actually find top postings 
easier to read.. I know the current status first and then to find 
history I can scroll down as much as I want instead of scrolling every time.

As admin, you are of course at liberty to make up your rules.. but can 
we look at those rules in an objective way and figure out if the rules 
actually help the community?

RFC 1855 was last updated on Oct 1995, when internet was the domain of a 
select few... I am not saying old RFCs are invalid, but this one is. It 
is talking about netiquette in Victorian times.

I think it is time we face the facts and decide where we should be 
wasting our time and energy - Getting more people to switch to 
Linux/FOSS and not use pirated MS software or stop people from posting 
to ILUGC, hoping against hope that they might actually get a reply 
whether it is top posted or bottom posted.

Cheers,
V

being part of the community also means abiding by the rules of the  
community - I am yet to come across a community without rules

Bharathi did not make the rules. An admin is not at liberty to make  
rules. Rules have evolved by consensus - and strangely enough, the  
rule against top posting *does* help the community

And driving rules were made long ago when only a few people had cars.

discipline is also part of the process - let the newcomers get into  
the nix way of doing things as opposed to the unbridled anarchy of  
the windoze world. btw, I find it much easier to reply to your posts  
now that you have stopped top posting.

Sure, these are good suggestions. But the first thing that made our
man reach the list was that he forgot the damned root password. And
only since he forgot the root password he found out that security was
lax. You can have BIOS passwords, you can have bootloader passwords
and then you can have an encrypted FS. But the point I'm trying to
make is that you CAN forget the root password or any other password,
like the BIOS or the boot-loader password. And when you forget with
all your protection - you can lock yourself out. I'd say unless you
have stuff that you don't mind losing rather than the other guy
getting his hands on it, like for example porn that you don't want you
mother to know about, doing additional stuff to protect your PC from
malicious physical access is an overkill.

There are workarounds for various things. The BIOS password can be
reset by removing the CMOS "keep-alive" cell. If you have a live CD,
then the system is pretty much yours. I don't know about an encrypted
FS.

Somebody should do a survey on the number of mails concerning
top-posting in this list. I understand everybody wants a RFC-1855
conformant mailing list, but hell, I sure want to filter out every
mail that is a stop-top-posting request, because it doesn't really
concern me. Every time its the same arguments repeated. Perhaps such
mails can be tagged as [stop-top-posting] from now on, I'll use gmail
to filter it out.

Students are not able to use these things because they are not aware of 
these things, which happens because they do not have an opportunity or 
requirement to use them. On one side I agree IRC is the ultimate medium 
of communication, especially to seek help, with FOSS community, but for 
students IRC can be really addictive and may even become a distraction 
from their education. They do not tend to use collaboration softwares 
because they have nothing sorta collaboration in their curriculum and 
expecting them to come out of their curriculum jail is something that I 
don't see happening in near future.

In my personal experience, I found most student's interest to be very 
short lived and temporary and it dies out as soon as they get placed in 
some foo, bar MNC. Although I knew students within ILUGC itself 
contributing more than I have ever tried to, they still are a meager 
percentage of the student community (even within ILUGC) and they 
themselves were futile in trying to get their pals in.

Yeah me too. I don't give a damn about top posting. Parsing bits of
text is done with relatively little horse power by my  relatively few
gray cells. I've read the stuff about top-posting and bottom-posting -
for me it doesn't matter, if the mail is in a language that I can
understand, it is fine. Many people on this mail can't read Tamil(safe
assumption), they get some mails from the list  - these are either
read, tolerated or ignored. And I remember someone pleading with these
guys not to send out Tamil mails since he is seeing these strange
"boxes" due to lack of fonts! If you send a "DONT POST TAMIL MAILS"
(I'm simulating a shout here) mail, the problem will possibly turn
political. Best of luck with that.

Just some musings here. Whether you guys decide against top-posting or
agree to tolerate/ignore it will not affect my affection I have for
this list. Bunch 'o good guys that we are :)

Cheers!

There will be no problem if we respect both the duty of the mailing list 
admin to remind the list about following the list's GUIDELINES 
(intentionally shouting to make people understand that it is guidelines 
and not rules) as well as the freedom of the list members to decide upon 
how much they abide with the guidelines. The reason for the existence of 
these guidelines have been debated numerous times and eventually people 
felt it to be the way it is. You can find them easily doing a web search.

Set a root password, IIRC if you have a root password then booting
into recovery mode will also require a password.
 # sudo passwd

But as stated by others, don't be fooled by the false sense of
security this provides.

I am of the opinion that the first objective of such lists should be to 
help solve problems/answer queries.  

However, people should also abide by list rules as kg as posted in his 
response.  Personally, I do find it very irritating to see one line 
inputs like +1 or me too, besides the top posting issues already 
discussed.

A couple of suggestions:

1. Perhaps moderating new members' posting to the list can mitigate this 
problem.  The moderators can gently remind posters about the proper 
etiquette and let the post come through.  IMO, most people will get the 
idea after a couple of incidents.  

2. In addition, the rules can be also be posted once a month, as a 
reminder, to keep all members on the same page (so to speak).  

IIRC, some of the ILUG lists practice the above.

My two paises :)

May there be peace be earth.

we should have two levels:
(a) the really committed students could be initiated into svn, etc. [I feel
IRC is not a must -- Parthan  pointed out some of the side effects.} and
workon "live" projrcts.

(b) others -- eager, but may have a variety of handicaps, and might drift
half-way -- could be brought thru a semi "bazaar" mode  of open, but
not fully collaborative  development :
       commit the code etc. to a wiki (e.g., nrcfosshelpline)
       get guidance thru known mentors, report & discuss on regular basis

essentially work on an "exercise" project which could be a "sub-contract"
from an interested mentor.

this mode is ideal for 2nd & 3rd year students whocould mature to option (a)
in their final year. this may also enable widespread awarenes.

Agreed. The 'passion' and 'commitment' is just not there. Moreover,
they don't listen for technical 'advice'. It is as bitter as medicine.

Most of their fundamentals, and concepts are also very weak. They
first need to learn these before doing any project work, let alone a
FOSS project.

Law enforcement comes at a price.  Nobody gets paid to run this list.
Any work done by list admins is gratis and the entire community is
indebted to them for their service.  So it's unfair to ask the list admin
or moderators to take action whenever someone breaks the rules.

The whole community needs to take up the responsibility of ensuring
the rules are maintained.  Most people play by the rules, but for
several reasons some people don't.  Here is a suggestion to anyone,
except list admins, who complains about bad emailing habits:


First, offer the original poster, the offender, a solution to his/her
question.  After doing this, you can then complain about their email
habits.  Just complaining alone simply adds to the noise.

If you see an social networks invite or an equally silly mistake, then
email the offender privately and make them understand the error.
If they don't get it, exercise your delete button and move on (my
first option is always the delete button).


I've been using this technique for the past few years and am yet to
offended anyone, and at the same time I've managed to preserve
my own sanity.

Each person who is involved has their own motivation. For me the
motivation is not "to teach" but "to help learn".

Part of the learning process is to learn how to ask questions in
order to get answers.

If people "switch to Linux/FOSS" but learn nothing in the process
they will only harm FOSS in the long run.[*]

There are always newcomers, so mails about "Do not top-post",
"Read the Fine manuals" ... other such examples of mild-mannered
swearing is a permanent aspect of such fora.

Another part of the learning process is that the cursing eventually
stops and turns to admiration but _only_ if you do actually learn!

I don't think that any of these is a real handicap. To give a weak
example, when I started working with Debian, I did not know any of
these.

What is _essential_ is that students should be willing to:
 1. Read a lot. (Source code, documentation, etc.)
 2. Collaborate as group in this activity.
 3. Tinker with programs and systems.

In some ways this is different from their usual experience with
software which is almost the opposite:
 a. Write a lot of code (also called "bugging" by Djkstra!)
 b. Be competitive
 c. Avoid breaking things

Regards,

Kapil.

PS. An example is the recent discovery of the Debian Security Bug. It
involves a lot of 1-3 but very little of a-c! Surely, tremendous
kudos go to Luciano Bello for discovering the problem and the Debian
OpenSSL Team for handling its fix.

I usually do an 'rsync -axP' to make an exact copy, I don't know if
its the ideal solution. It might help to boot up into single user
mode, to avoid files being changed while you're copying. You'll need
to make changes in /etc/fstab, and manually install grub on the second
harddisk.

Suppose the file-system you want to copy is mounted at /source
Suppose the file-system you want write is mounted at /target

	cd /source
	find . -depth | cpio -pdumv /target

Note that this will not work properly if '/source' is '/'. You need
to exclude all the virtual filesystems for that.

Secondly, it will not create the master boot record on the target
HDD. You need to install the boot loader on HDD separately.

Read 'man find' and 'man cpio' before running the above commands and
understand what they do or you may damange your system beyond repair!

I've been keeping track of the list for quite a few years now, albeit
passively. I have to concede I  still don't understand the ruckus over the
order in posting! Guidelines are definitely not rules. Fine, even if
bottom-posting is mandatory here, IMO one doesn't have to raise a hue and
cry over anyone *not* sticking to it whatever be the reasons. If a newbie
sent a mail not satisfying the guidelines, it's upto the admin's discretion
to mail the person on top-posting or whatever - but when someone's asking
for some advice or something real urgent to be dealt with and requires help,
it breaks the continuity of the mail and becomes sorta irritating after a
while.Everyone has their own priorities and flaming repeatedly on guidelines
that people are either ignorant off or don't deem it necessary to adhere to
eventually beats the purpose of the mailing list! I'm sure there are better
things than nit picking frequently.
I agree that some action (?) should be taken say for a vacation responder
left on or advertisements of some type or those random silly mails that one
has learnt to ignore. But to keep harping on posting and structure becomes
irritating too. I've learnt to delete and ignore, and isn't the whole
posting-issue turning out to a be a worse waste of time than say, the time
saved by bottom-posting?
It's like the debate on dress codes - as long as person works efficiently or
atleast satisfactorily, what (s)he's wearing doesn't really matter. It's a
matter of comfort to the wearer.
I'm sure the admins find nit picking tedious too and if you're pointing it
out to the same person again, maybe the person simply doesn't want to work
that way. If you don't agree with the format of a person, just go ahead and
delete any mails. And it's kinda unfair - permitting posting in any language
even if a lot of readers don't understand while getting worked up over the
structure!
And that response of admins bending rules reminds one of the Indian
political bureaucracy! We understand that a lot of people are going outta
their way to be helpful and for sustaining the list- but this stringent
attitude on something so trivial has/will continue to put off a lot people.
What is applicable to the gander is applicable to the goose :)

Cheers,
Kadambari.

Seems, your root file system is facing some problems. you have to check root
file with 'fsck'. Ref the following link, follow the steps properly. Hope
your problem ill be solved.

Which in some ways classifies you as a newbie and may explain your
poorly formatted e-mail.

> Fine, even if bottom-posting is mandatory here,

The question is _not_ top vs bottom posting. The problem is quoting
only specific portions of the mail that you are responding to.

If you are asking someone for help, it is nice/natural to make some
effort to write your questions in a structure/language that they can
understand.

Since it is understood that some people are new to the culture, a
little bit of hand-holding or "pointing out the zebra crossings" will
be done.

If this help is ignored, the annoyed readers will take recourse to
.procmailrc or mutt scoring files or simply the 'd' key and the
questioner will be left wondering why their questions get no answers.

Regards,

Kapil.

it is not - more like the debate on cell-phone driving - whether the  
car is clean or dirty doesn't matter, it matters whether the driver  
stops the car to take a call or drives with one hand.

entry in main partition for the new OS partition.   And change the
/etc/fstab in the destination partition to mount the destination partition

edit the /boot/grub/menu.lst, and delete lines pertaining to recovery mode.

all it does is to prevent the recovery mode from getting displayed while
booting.

even then, one can even edit the entry for normal mode while booting, pass
on the arguments for recovery mode and enter in that mode.

Exactly.. :)   After  installation, the password was not working.. i thought
of re-install, but this recovery mode worked fine..

In security point of view, i think, even a windows system can be broken if
physical reach is there.

But in some corporate or office setup, we can better secure it, by removing
the CD drive (to prevent live CD option), disabling the recovery mode.  I
think, we can achieve this by tweaking the boot scripts.

Any way, it was a fruitful discussion.

Is there any possibility that those from industry create such opportunity..
Currently i see lot of engg students completing 2ndyear, vaguely trying for
IPT, without knowing what it is..  the most common destination for CS, IT
and Electronics student is BSNL :)

Very valid..  Wondering If not us, who is going to tie the bell..  is there
any other possibility, that the students can be motivated inspite of such
**handicap**

Best way is to make the teaching community addict to using these
collobarative tools for their own purpose..  Like maintaining a separate
server, which hosts an email server (initially for staffs alone for internal
communication) , and webserver..  deploying wiki to maintain and update
syllabuses, and other course materials..
Deploying a blog to maintain communications...
By opening the server to the internet, it would create a change in how they
operate.. if we make it as a habit, it will be a starting point, i feel.

I feel, this is achievable..  If we could demonstrate in one college, others
will automatically follow.. for that we need momentum and co-ordinated
effort from ourselves.. (ie from industry professionals..) ..

Yes indeed..  i  am looking for cause analysis..  Passion and vision is what
required most..  But who is going to infuse those?  I feel, it doesnt come
automatically..  we need some path breaking initiative to break this
deadlock..

There is no better utility than this for cloning as far as I know.

no editor is a substitute for knowledge of CSS, html and javascript.  
Learn that first. This is the GNU/Linux way.

I think you are taking the original querent's "exact clone" too
seriously! 

Using "dd" will copy every sector on the disk, whether used or not!

This will take "forever" on a large enough disk.

It may be better to use some sort of _file_ copying tool like "cp",
"rsync", "cpio", "tar", "unison", ...

I do not subscribe to this PoV because it is a flawed logic in the RAD
arena. The Q solicits an editor which would help in designing pages quickly
without getting into the nuances of it(though, one can always edit the
generated HTML/CSS). The present editors(like DW) are good and are
'intelligent'(to a certain extent)  and does not essentially ask the person
to know the minutaes of HTML.

I would prefer creating a bulleted list by using clicking on a button then
manually using the tags(you may be different in this case, but to my limited
knowledge there aint many who would do this!).

After all , how many developers know loop-unrolling and compiler
optimisations and ASM snippets when they are programming 'applications' in
C/Java.

Do note(again) that my observation is purely targetted at RAD developers and
not those who develop mission-critical or high performance programs - in the
latter, each and every line of te the program matters, and genreally these
are 'hand-coded'.

Also, i would be interested in knowing as to how this is the "GNU/Linux
Way".

PS: "The GNU/Linux Way" sounds like a good book title - anyone considering
this?? ;)

"The GNU/Linux Way" possibly refers to:

	You should not limit your freedom to Freedom 0

(Recall: Freedom 0 refers to the freedom to use software.)

Are you against RAD model? I feel, the lack of (knowledge of) RAD in linux
is one of the reason why Linux is not widely used for application
development for end user.

do you mean to say that there are two kinds of application  
development - Rapid and ordinary? Like tatkal and ordinary in railway  
bookings? RAD does not mean 'how quickly can I produce a page of css/ 
html'. It means how quickly can I get a bug free application in  
production and how quickly I can alter/upgrade the same in  
production. You generate html quickly not by using automating tools  
like dreamweaver, but by using templates so that you only write one  
piece of code once. And that one piece you do write should be written  
with an understanding of CSS and HTML. Employing hundreds of code  
monkeys to use DW to generate html without knowing what is html is  
not rapid development - it is an invitation to disaster. The doze  
WYSIWYG culture is aimed at trying to convince people that they can  
write applications without knowing how to write code. The 'nix - GNU/ 
Linux way focusses on understanding what you are doing. I have been  
in discussion with good web designers, and have yet to find one who  
uses DW. The preferred workflow is:
1. mock-up in photoshop (gimp for us)
2. slice/convert mockup to html
3. break out a text editor and clean up the CSS/HTML

I prefer to create a bulleted list like this:

a developer is a person who aims at perfection - and there is no

$ tail f1 f2 -- Show the last 10 lines of 2 files with small header.

$ tail -vn 5 myfile -- Show only last 5 Lines with header.

$ tail -c 12 myfile -- Show only last 12 Bytes.

$ tail -q myfile -- Don't show headers.

$ tail --retry myfile -- Keep retrying to open myfile.

$ tail -f maillog -- Output appended with file data as the file grows.
		     Useful to monitor logs.

$ tail -f -s 10 maillog -- Once in every 10s update the output.

$ tail -f --pid=200 myfile -- Terminate tail after PID(200) dies.

Hi all,
My PC Spec: Intel P4, 256 MB Ram, 40GB, Chipset Mother board.
Presently  I have installed Fedora 6 and I am stuck up with some resolution problems. It just shows up with 800x600
and not higher. I think it's because of my RAM size or the display driver.

May I know are there any lighter distro for the above mentioned spec and can do away with the resolution problem.
Started few months back, my Linux journey is quite exciting and thanks for all of your support.

Regards,
Balaji Natarajan

The above mentioned server must be down. It isn't pinging from my
system. Since that is your client's server, I don't think there is
much you can do about it, but retry sending the message when the
server comes back up [I think your SMTP server should do that on its
own]

Neither. (And your reference to railway booking is just too damn hilarious)
RAD is just a paradigm wherein you get stuff done that can be used earlier
than what would have been delivered otherwise in a SDLC - bugs are accepted,
but not show-stoppers. And if you are/like the business of quoting
wikipedia, then :

<WIKIPEDIA>"RAD approaches may entail compromises in functionality and
performance in exchange for enabling faster development and facilitating
application maintenance."</WIKIPEDIA>

Developing a portal is much different from developing a middleware or an
embedded system. I know many who develop quick pages in IDEs and always go
through the generated code and clean it up accordingly.


> 1. mock-up in photoshop (gimp for us)


<dripping sarcasm> Why you are doing this - effectively you should be
writing a C/ASM which generates an array of number corresponding to the
pixel values and then store it as a file. Some of my freinds in the
monkeyland do this. </dripping sarcasm>


> cannot comment on this as I have no idea about C/Java


Well, if you are referring to the best of the developers, then most of them
know either of the above languages(+python[scripting]).

a developer is a person who aims at perfection - and there is no distinction
> for him between RAD and ordinary.


So what about others? - they do not want perfection? Am not sure , whether i
understood your concerns!

Yup.  Norton Ghost ($) also does a good job of cloning and adjusting 
filesystem (ext2/3) size when disks are of different sizes.

Not clear what you are asking.  Deducing that you want your Windows box 
to see the folders on your Linux box as a "Network Share"

You will have to install/configure Samba on your Linux.  In synaptic 
search for samba and install all the samba-* packages.  I notice that 
there is a package for GUI configurator but I have not used it. The 
samba configuration file is /etc/samba/smb.conf.  The docs in samba-doc 
or samba-doc-pdf should you get started with a basic setup.

How slow is your 'Net connection?  Less than 9.6 Kbps?  Recall, this was 
the best speed one could get in the late 80s and early 90s, email 
transport was via UUCP (dialup/hop); one had to wait till the next day 
for responses.  Yet young Linus Torvalds and lesser mortals 
got "cutting edge" work of their time done.  Search engines like 
AltaVista came much later.

The next wave (already started) is embedded devices and netbooks 
(slightly bigger than one's palm - e.g. Asus eee pc).  Analysts and 
technocrats are predicting that Linux will play a big role in this 
domain.  The lic. cost is the least of the issue.  Reliability and 
scalability will be the factors.

Ahh.... you are not getting my point at all - pointing to some website is
not the name of the game.
I am NOT against using  a simple editor(instead of an IDE) to build
websites, but if  someone wants to develop using IDE , then simply RESPECT
him and his requirement. What i am hinting here is just sheer 'respect' and
answering his requirement, but at the same time - just advice him/her to use
;efficient; tools to build robust websites.

If still not convinced, then check this out :

aha - I am *not* against using IDEs. I use quanta on linux and  
textmate on mac for html. What I *am* against is using WYSIWYG  
editors for generating html/css. If I click on 'list' in quanta I get  
the framework for a list. But I *see* ul and li etc. That is not a  
problem. No one is asking people to manually type everything. This is  
a far cry from trusting something to generate code. You cannot build  
robust websites that way. You *must* be conversant with CSS and HTML  
- there is no other go. Especially if you want to build cross-browser  
compatible websites. Of course, if you want to build IE only websites  
- no problem use doze tools and forget about CSS and HTML.

Please download 'G4L' (Ghose for linux) and write it into cd.
1. Place the CD and boot machine from CD.
2. select source and designation path carefully.

       please note: G4L clone disk bit by bit. Data clone rate is 9MB per
sec approx. TO clone 80GB HDD it takes one hour fourty minutes approximately
( depence on processor and RAM).

Power failure will not cause any demage to souce HDD. Able to clone partion
to partion. can copy diffirent size HHDs but Size is fit to source size and
can't resize. Network cloning also possible. see more details in web.

Happy cloning.

Cloning of HDD is not an right way of Administrator. Try to become
administrator.

1. Please upgrade your ram to 512MB minimum.
2. For better GUI environment, Install Ubuntu or Xubuntu. which have an long
term support for updation nearly two years.
3. Light weight is Puppy Linux. but check using live CD before installation.

Thx for the ref. to this appl.  How did you come to know about it, 
Google?

In enterprises, when you have to deploy several systems (same hw 
config), this is the way it is done.  The big system integrators also  
install, in a similar way, the software (OS + appl.).

Basically you are being advised that there is really no alternative to
taking pains in life...

The corporate world and half baked techies are so full of UML, RAD and
what not.

It is so easy to think that one can be a great swimmer/skater without
going thro' pains.

It is impossible. I fall at least 5 times each day I learn skating.

I know it is the sure way to become a master at it and gain balance.

So much so that these days I enjoy falling. ;)

All software developers have to fully understand this kural.

"Ennamai inimai enakul akumthan
 unnal vilaiyum sirapu."

Also an abbreviated

"Idukkan varunkal naguga."

Translated to English, the above two refers to the importance of
enjoying pain.

Anyway coming back to the point finally ;),

A list apart is a great website for CSS frameworks. And there are also
quite a few websites where you can download superb templates.

I have bookmarked quite a few of them. I am still learning web
programming. So my list may not be exhaustive.

http://del.icio.us/girish1729/css

Basically there is no alternative to knowing the ins and outs of
something in engineering.

This applies to life in general too. You do a much better job when you
know what you are getting into.

Such general principles are usually violated at one's own peril.

In the BSD world we do

# dump 0f -f foo.dump *

for each of the file systems.

And restore it with

# restore rf foo.dump

Of course you are advised to do it in single user mode when none of the
partitions are mounted.

And you have to do the fdisk, disklabel(8) and newfs(8).

So this is not exactly cloning but it works much faster and better than
dd.

And you have NetBSD's g4u ( ghosting for UNIX).

Never used it though.

The web-apps that I've written and maintain are all written by hand,
so don't start flaming me too soon.

The learning curve to writing *good* html is quite high. My initial
designs for my webapps were when my HTML and CSS skills were not that
good, and we produced pathetic code that had to be hacked, over and
over again, to get it to look respectable on all browsers.

Of course, I learnt a lot in the process --- my app is XHTML strict now.

I'm throwing a few points here, without supporting either side of the debate:
1. For a first timer who needs to create production level code, or who
is getting paid for it --- perhaps, he can't afford to write it
manually. He'd be better off with some WYSIAWYG editor (+ the
php/python/ruby, which is easier to learn). Probably this holds more
true if you just need to write one or two pages.
2. If you really want to learn writing web-apps, write everything by hand.
2. If you are a professional, write everything by hand.

I also view CSS as a pathetic language/specification, although I still
use it for the lack of an alternative. Maybe I have lot more to learn
about it.

Point taken and thanks for the elucidation :) . But, i would still say - you
may use a WYSIWYG editor, but *PLEASE LOOK AT THE GENERATED CODE* after that
and understand what is happening under the hood, and do not blindly deploy
it. Am not sure how many have tried ADF(Application Developer Framework) -
using JDeveloper. Try it sometimes ;) ...... the page is filled with table
tags! phew!

Hmm, that looks like Django. Come to think of it, why use a high level
framework like that. Why not write plain sql statements, write plain
html, write your own authentication system, implement users and
groups, etc and attempt to connect all of that with a week end hack ?
Would it look nice if you somebody accused of being lazy and not
understanding sql, html, http etc ? I used to one of this snooty
anti-DW folks till I had a chance to observe a DW expert at close
quarters. It's quite presumptuous to assume that DW users don't
understand html, css, etc.

Is that happening using pulse audio? Have you tried switching back to
alsa? Are the results same then?

Another option is to just buy a Buffalo Terrastation without the drives, and put 
in 4 drives of your own. It does raid0/1/5 and does a very good job of it.

I was in need of a Linux/BSD based NAS about 5 months back, and here are
some of my thoughts.  I tried Netgear's ReadyNAS 11000, Adaptec's Snap 410,
FreeNAS and OpenFiler, and had a dabble with Sanat. Following is some detail
of my experiences.

I started with the Netgear ReadyNAS. It comes in 2 flavors - desktop and
rack-mount. The former is very nice for smaller applications - your
music/video jukebox or home server or something of that ilk. The rack-mount
I thought would be good for a business environment.
The software is good, and you get source to most of it, except for the
management interface (a perl-based solution) which leaves a lot to be
desired. The thing was slow and gave me problems in a Windows Active
Directory environment. These are well documented in the ReadyNAS wiki,
which, btw, is really a boon. Netgear has tried to answer the community's
needs and puts a fair amount of effort (I think through employee input) into
catering to the public. Responses were relatively good. Also the NAS
software had plugins that allowed for root access through SSH and some other
stuff.
The bad news: I had 2 disk failures with the rack-mount within 2 weeks. I
also had very poor network throughput for my 65 users who were sharing data
on this box. The box had 512MB RAM. I found out that this was horribly
insufficient for a small business. I also found out after going through
hours of support calls that the rack-mount device has no 1GB memory
available that works with it (yes really)! So I returned the box to the
distributor (Rashi Peripherals, who, btw, were completely useless as support
for this device).

I next tried the Adaptec Snap Server 410. Similar configuration, but this
box at least supported more memory. I tried it out with 2GB. The software is
based on GuardianOS, which as I understand is a Linux variant. I did not
look at the source closely. The box has really lame management software,
which is not terribly configurable. The console login allows a very limited
shell environment for a few mostly log-related apps. Shell access was really
not of any use on this box thanks to this crippled environment.
The OS and management interface halted and could not be made to recover
within the first 3 days. I spent a week trying to make it do something
useful, and calling Adaptec support in the US (the guys in Mumbai and Blore
were completely unable to provide any help) and finally gave up. The box was
sent back to the distributor (Renaissance Systems I believe).

I also talked to Sanat. I decided not to proceed with them (very competent
and knowledgeable technically, btw) because they would not give me root
access to their NAS equipment, and because they wanted an annual service
contract. These things may have changed in the time I dealt with them, so
best to contact them directly.

FreeNAS worked very well - easy install and lots of convenient things. But
the interface left a lot to be desired. I had some difficulties with Active
Directory integration, but I can't really recall off-hand what they were
(sorry).

I then tried OpenFiler, which is Linux (rpath, I believe) based. Install was
a snap. So much so that a guy with almost no technical background was able
to do an install with only phone guidance from me. The interface is very
good, but has a few kinks that I believe are going to be ironed out in the
latest version (2.3). The system is easy to use. The documentation is very
good. The community support is very good (openfiler.com). The only complaint
I would have about it is that it does not come with a stable, snapshot
backup system. I had to install rsnapshot independently, which was pretty
easy. rPath has virtual appliances for OpenFiler which I've tried on a test
environment and it works very well.
OpenFiler did almost everything (including iSCSI, which I was initially
dubious about, but am now pretty sold on) that all the other products did,
including Sanat's. At present I'm running OpenFiler in a 70-person
environment with absolutely no glitches for the last 3 months. It's not
perfect, but then again, what is?! For the price this is an outstanding
solution. Actually for anthing under 3lacs this is an outstanding solution.
Above 3lacs you may as well just pay OpenFiler :)

So my recommendation is to get some server-grade hardware, put OpenFiler on
it, and rest easy. The real issue with any NAS/SAN product is whether you
have the ability to support the product yourself. If you don't, learn. The
commercial guys who claim they'll support you are just trying to make a
buck. My experience was that I could not count on them (the commercial guys
anyway) and ultimately ended up having to rely on myself (yeah, nothing new
there i guess).

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

head - Output the 1st part of files.

Summary: 

Show the first 10 lines of each FILE. With more than one FILE, precede
each with a header giving the file name.  With no FILE, or when FILE
is -, then read the input from stdin.

Examples:

$ head  -- Read 10 lines from stdin and dump to stdout.

$ head foss.txt  -- Show 1st 10 lines of the file.

$ head f1 f2 -- Show 1st 10 lines of file f1 & f2 with header.

$ head -q f1 f2 -- Same as above, but with-out header.

$ head -n 15 myfile  -- Show 1st 15 lines only.

$ head -c 15 myfile  -- Show 1st 15 Bytes only.

$ head -c 15k myfile -- Show 1st 15KB only.


* Useless Use of Head (By Jan Schaumann):

"NEVER GENERALIZE" -- generalization are evil!

Just curious - are you an ASM expert? Writing a webframework in ASM, or for
that matter   a simple 'IF' into ASM :P .. i prostrate to thee!

As you wont be using compiler/interpreters to 'generate' code.

true. Lets put it into context. GUI builders: these generate code for  
every drag and drop of a widget etc etc. Which is fine for a simple  
layout or to get started. Problem comes when you try to fine tune -  
if you do it outside the GUI builder, which is quite often necessary,  
then the builder no longer knows what you are doing and all sorts of  
funny things result.

Sundar, thanks very much for your detailed experience and 
recommendation.  I downloaded openfiler a few days back, the stuff on 
their website looked impressive.  Now, with your practical experience, 
analysis and recommendation I am prompted to install it and learn about 
it :)

I run Debian etch on a pIII 800MHz, 128MB Ram, Trident on board
graphics card, and some 30GB hdd. I have 1024x768. Not really
snappy. But, definitely enough for my dad to check his mail and
read wikipedia.

This thread has effectively been hijacked. The poor guy asked for a tool
that create web pages, not names of frameworks that are used to write web
application. I am also a firm believer that "hand written" stuff is good for
many situations. The browser based front-end of our virtualization
management system is written in Python/TG. There is no DW involved anywhere.


There are businesses out there that I know are making a lot of money just by
making static web sites for customers. Due to the heavy competition, they
need to be quick and cheap. There are certain tools that help create good
looking, static web sites quickly and easily. And DW is one such tools. If
Ravi had asked for an alternate to ASP, most of the conversation in this
mail chain would have been valid. However, as a matter of fact, he *is*
asking for an alternative to DW. Taking into account what DW does, if anyone
can suggest an alternate tool that helps create static web pages visually,
it would have helped our man.

This thread has however been a lot of fun with Ken pitching in some jokes.
Now my turn for suggestions. Ravi, dude,  use Emacs. OK, now that the thread
has turned irrelevant, I invite the vi guys for a flame war.

Cheers!

if you had checked the thread, you would have found suggestions for  
quanta, nvu, etc etc which are all poor cousins of dreamweaver in the  
WYSIWYG department. The point is, that the nix philosophy being what  
it is, there are very often no tools that give an exact alternative  
to the proprietary tool. There are a large many projects that attempt  
to clone the proprietary tool, but as far as I can see, in all those  
attempts the clone is far below the original in quality. Some examples:

OO word and doze word
vb dot net and mono
vb and gambas

success stories are where cloning is not attempted and the nix tool  
develops in it's own way. Examples:
Gimp and Photoshop
Blender and Maya

So, if you want something like dreamweaver, spend the 600USD and get  
and use dreamweaver.

I have to agree that OpenFiler is a pretty neat product. Commercial support
is available for nominal rates from the parent company Xinit. Our other
customers use iSCSI products from LeftHand Networks on pretty heavy
workloads, and they like it as well. Our product FluidVM supports only
iSCSI, so I have tried only the iSCSI part of OpenFiler. These guys are
good. Since it is based on rPath Linux, you'd want to change the login
password of the rPath Agent(running HTTP on port 8004) from the default to
the something more secure. It is a security issue not many people are aware
of.

Dear Sir,

I am Sriram. I am doing 2nd year B.tech - IT in SASTRA University. I am very
much interested in  doing projects in linux but i do not have
proper guidance. I have some basic knowledge in linux.
But i am not able to implement my ideas in Linux. So i formed a group
with my friends and we are trying

to do projects in Linux. We
have the potential to do but we don't know the proper way to do.
Please help me do projects in Linux and explain me about FOSS projects.

Thanks

I configured samba, and tried to access the share..  But its extremely slow
to move in to a directory.  (but other connections like ssh & vnc are
working fine..)

Any solutions for this?  To make the linux file share as fast as windows
one?

The UNIX philosophy is several things. And several parts that make up a
whole. But I am yet to see the UNIX philosophy being applied to GUI
effectively. It is applied programatically and internally. GStreamer comes
to mind. As far as a simple user of the GUI is concerned, I am unable to
visualize how a user can apply the UNIX way of doing things and still remain
sane. There are several powerful GUI applications available today. OOo,
Firefox, etc. They run fine on UNIX, but where is the UNIX way of doing
things when you are using these apps?

We are talking about the differences between a user who want to use a simple
GUI application and a pipes happy developer. I'm sure there is a difference.
With Linux going mainstream, there will be more and more users who will just
want to applications running on Linux(they actually won't care if it is

things they are going to be looking for is alternatives to Windows based
software. They won't give a damn about the UNIX way of doing things.

Good work on setting up samba. 

Strange that your samba shares are slower than windows.  Are you using 
Vista+SP1 or XP+SP2?   I have seen a report that one needs the latest 
samba version for vista+sp1 because M$ introduced some new 
functionality for file sharing methods (sorry don't know the details).

You may have to do some performance tweaking.  

Personally, I have not touched samba for > 1 year so cannot help you

I suggest you search through the SAMBA FAQs and mail list archives 
(www.samba.org), I am sure others have experienced the same and got 
their solutions there.

Hi,

I conducted a "Debian GNU/Linux Installation" session as part of the
first day of the 15-day Industry oriented summer school program,
conducted by FSF-AP chapter, today, May 16, 2008, at Satyam Learning
Centre Institute of Engineering and Technology, Piglipur village,
Hayath Nagar, Andhra Pradesh (few kilometers past Ramoji Film City).

The photos are available at:
http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album44

I would like to thank FSF-AP for the arrangements. Due to official
work, I was able to spend only one day. This program is conducted in
parallel in three other colleges outside of Hyderabad. In the evening,
they provide training on team-building, communication skills,
personality development, and other soft skills.

Please check http://swecha.org/ for more details.

Students were mostly from Andhra Pradesh, and few from Tamil Nadu. The
INR 1500 cost for the program is inclusive of stay, food, and training
(lectures, and lab-usage) for the 15 days.

Most of organizers are volunteers - students, academicians or people
working in the Industry in Hyderabad. They also meet during the
weekends at:

FSF India A.P Chapter,
Flat No.201, Karan Apartments,
(exactly opposite to petrol bunk)
Paradise,
Secunderabad.
Landmark: Beside Sandarshini hotel.

Cloud computing is an umbrella term used to denote computational resources
on the cloud. The cloud generally means a network and the network that more
and more people are referring to now with regards to cloud computing is the
Internet.

The idea is to have your real applications on servers on remote locations
accessible via the Internet while you just need a way to access that
application. Google Apps, Windows Live and Amazon AWS(which is based on Xen)
come to mind.

Cheers!

Google search "cloud computing" gave interesting links on the very first 
page.

A very serious effort to get Windows refund from Lenovo is going on in
ilugd. There is cases in Europe where people have got such a refund,
but this is first time this issue is being taken seriously in India.
Some magzines are involved in this at the moment. Any help to get wide
coverage and discussion and importantly legal options would be great.

If the machine in question suits your needs, absolutely.  But that's
not the point.  See more below.

 Anupam> Or maybe 'punish' the ones that don't by asking

 Anupam> you can buy whatever machine you want..

I agree except that it's not punishment.  It's just being fair.

I compared the refund/credit statements of Windows XP and Windows
Vista EULAs.

,----[ Windows XP (on a machine with functioning Vista) ]
| IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE PRODUCT; YOU MAY RETURN
| IT TO YOUR PLACE OF PURCHASE FOR A FULL REFUND.
`----

,----[ Windows Vista (on a "virgin" machine) ]
| IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE. INSTEAD, CONTACT
| THE MANUFACTURER OR INSTALLER TO DETERMINE THEIR RETURN POLICY FOR A
| REFUND OR CREDIT.
`----

The choice of words is telling.  Microsoft seems to have left the
decision to refund at OEM's/installers' discretion (at least in the
case of machines preloaded with Vista.)  And OEMs may conveniently
choose not to refund at all!

What galls me are the statements like these:

"Nevertheless, 140 million PCs have sold with paid copies installed."
(http://money.cnn.com/2008/05/02/technology/Kirkpatrick_Microsoft.fortune/index.htm?section=money_fastforward)

Paid my foot, I feel I have been pick pocketed by Lenovo on
Microsoft's behalf.  Imagine MS as some kind of don and L as servile
sucking up local goon collecting "hafta" (extortion money) or pick
pocketing for the don. :)

From my perspective, the whole issue boils down to these
arguments/points to be settled.

1. Is it legal for OEMs to bundle software with the machines AND
  charge for it and require consumers to agree to a license before
  they can use it (after having paid)?

2. Are the terms of the Windows license (EULA) enforceable in India?

3. If a customer does not agree to the license required to use the
  bundled software, then does/should the consumer have a right to
  refund?

4. Are the terms of the license legally binding on only the paying
  consumers or also on the vendor (OEM)?

5. Can OEMs refuse to be bound by the terms and conditions of a
  software license _they_ bundled and charged for (agreed they did
  not author it but they did charge for it)?  If OEMs are exempt then
  how can the terms be binding on consumer?

6. What is the fair price of Windows to be refunded?  In my opinion,
  it should be at par with the market price or OEMs need to disclose
  the price at which they bought licenses (for legal entities to
  determine the fair price.)

In case it turns out that this land does have a fair law and has not
sold out to corporates at the expense of consumers, then following is
what I expect to get out of this Mahabharat when/if this ends.

Short term/this specific case
-----------------------------
1. A formal (verbal/written) apology from Lenovo.
2. Refund from Lenovo.

Long term/general case
----------------------

3a. OEMs required by law to provide "No OS" option on all machines
  (No, I do not want to purchase or be force fed Novell Linux
  either.)

Or at the very least

3b. Legal requirements binding on OEMs to document, print and
  distribute the timebound and simple refund process (along with the
  cost that will be refunded) _with_ the machines; may be distributed
  as part of the user manual or as a separate pamphlet but _with_ the
  machine (not just hidden behind tons of links on their website).

So I guess there are going to be two parts to this effort/fight: short
term and long term.

The short term part needs to be dealt with in MRTP and/or consumer
court.  BTW, meanwhile Lenovo is figuring out their address in India
that can receive a legal notice.

But what about the long term issue?  Who/which organization needs to
be influenced/educated to implement it?  Do we even attempt it?  How?
Do we discuss it here at all since the list is for "Linux and
Linux-related issues" and this may be considered off-topic.  IMHO,
it's not since it's about computing freedom.

Here some things that I learnt about this issue when I bought my
laptop.

Many _manufacturers_ do offer the option of FreeDOS (or IBM DOS for
Lenovo) and some even offer some GNU/Linux distribution
pre-installed when they have "certified" that their machine works
with Linux ... but
 	a. Vendors need to place a bulk order with the manufacturer
 	   to offer you this option. They are unwilling to place
 	   a bulk order unless they _know_ that that many machines
 	   will sell. (Note that if they later have to sell this
 	   machine with a legal Windows, that version will cost them
 	   more).
 	b. Vendors get incentives for bundling Windows programmes
 	   which are "shareware" or 30-day trial versions; there are
 	   even advertising placements! They pass on part of these
 	   incentives to you as a discount. These discounts are
 	   obviously unavailable if you do not buy Windows.
This to some extent means that vendors will offer only low-end
machines with the DOS/Linux option. The manufacturer's web-site will
also generally follow the same policy as vendors. At this point I
copped-out and bought a low-end laptop!

If you want to buy a high-end laptop then your best option is to ask
for a Windows refund from the manufacturer _after_ buying the machine
as the member of ilugd is doing.

You need to be quite careful to ensure that the EULA is not
accepted. Often the vendor will _helpfully_ unpack and install the
system for you and click through the EULA acceptance. It is not clear
that this acceptance is legally binding on you. Its not even clear
what the Indian courts think about click-through licenses!

I think that our best hope is to convince the manufacturers that
these are a few isolated cases and it is simplest for them to settle
the amount whenever it is asked for. You can also argue that if a
large number of people are asking for the refund it means that they
should drop condition (a) above.

This is only one aspect of the "Microsoft Eco-System".

Cynically,

Kapil.

I use one such. As I understand these are SaaS based frameworks that  
can support end user apps. The companies make money on subscriptions.  
I use Quickbase. Neat framework for workflow based apps when no of  
users are less. Framework easy enough to be used by a non-programmer  
but needs a biz analyst kind of a person.

Hey,

Funny you asked this question today. Yesterday, someone at /. asked
the same. Have a look at the comments section.
http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/05/16/1332249&from=rss

But I stongly suggest you donate them to some other organisation which
would need those comps, more than you do. Puppy Linux would work great
on those machines. :) Try other schools, or rural training centres,
the likes.

I think the querent was talking about machines that no longer boot!
Long term hardware support for these machines is an issue even if
some of them _do_ boot.

Hi,

I want to connect to serial ports, but my laptop has only USB ports available.
Hence, I'm looking for a USB to serial converter that's reliable and linux
compatible.

I've bought three non-branded USB/serial converters, but they all failed after
6 months of light use.  None of them have worked reliably (tried Debian 4 and
WinXP) -- sometimes they don't get detected, other times I can receive but
can't transmit, etc.  They rarely work.

Can someone recommend a suitable USB to serial converter brand/model
That Just Works?

Hi !

You should think of converting them into thin clients. We do the same thing here in Canada. Fedora and many other distros support LTSP and it is a simple process to convert them in to thin clients.

I can refer to many resources and also share our experience.

Is there a repository of such cases like the "cases in Europe."  I would 
expect such cases to get much publicity in the Linux forums e.g. 
slashdot. 

The first such case that I recall, occured in Calif., US involving a 
Toshiba notebook.  The customer did not agree to the MS EULA and was 
able to get a refund from Toshiba (after much arguments).

The other case, I recall was an UK customer (again a notebook) who got a 
refund from Dell/UK for not agreeing to the Windows EULA.

Just to add more points, it's a cluster of machines wherein you can
run a distributed application. Think of it as one server virtually
spread across multiple machines located in different locations. For
instance, if you write a application which consumes 10GB RAM, but you
do not have one physical machine to run your application. If you have
10 separate machines each having 1GB RAM, you could run your
application using this system.

Google search is a typical application which is built on this concept.
They have 1000s of low-end machines interconnected using a distributed
system. So even if one machine goes down, the remaining 999 machines
would ensure to fulfill the user request. They share a common file
system called BigTable and/or Google File System(GFS).

Similarly, on the open source front Hadoop is meant to be used as a
distributed computing platform. It has it's own BigTable alike file
system MapReduce to facilitate this setup. Many leading software firms
including Yahoo! and Amazon use Hadoop. If i'm right, Yahoo! has a
setup wherein they have interconnected around 2000 nodes using Hadoop
and it is one of the largest implementation afaik.

For more interesting facts about Hadoop, refer to their website:

Hi,

 You can use the Sugar interface (originally designed for OLPC) on Debian now

If you are on Debian sid (unstable), just install sugar

apt-get install sugar

and install any of the activities you like

apt-cache search sugar activity

It is amazingly new feel, completely innovative interface.

Try it now !!!

Its refund time, lets celebrate !! If we can replicate this in our
country sooner, the better.

"A French user asked for a refund after buying a ASUS computer that
came with Windows XP and other software pre-installed. ASUS tried to
apply a procedure which cost more money to the consumer that they will
give back ... The court ruled in favor of the user, who received back
130 Euro (~200 $) for the software. Here is the ruling  (PDF, French).
In France, this is the fourth victory for refund seekers during the
last two years, and many people are now filing for refunds (in
French). Two French associations (AFUL  and April) published a press
release on this victory the same day a important hearing happened."

Did you install any activity? Try the pippy one
apt-get install sugar-pippy-activity

It is a completely new approach. Instead of file and directory and
desktop, it is based on activities. For example there is calculate
activity and it gives you a calculator with all kind of fucntions. The
pippy activity teaches you python. It stores all your work
automatically with the activity itself.

Cheers

Dear Luggies,

This is an invitation  for open source web developers  and open source web
designer  to join "open web group"  a non formal team of web developers.

The objective of "open web group " is develop mission critical applications
like web interface for controlling satellites,  Interface for controlling
Nuclear Reactors. Controlling UAV and  AI. Is it interesting?

no am kidding, thats not our area :)

whole idea behind "open web group" is to develop simple and sophisticated
web applications that one could make use it in his day to day life.

if you have these... { willingness )

a, contribute to FOSS community
b, to learn new things
c, to work as team or single with minimal or no supervision
d, to feel coding as enjoy
e, working towards tight time line

hey, do u  think you possess all of these,  yes  than please forward me your
profile.

It is very much opened for student community,  to make themselves  a
contributors  for the society ,

*little knowledge about web technologies, server side script could be added
advantage. We need more Contributors.

Technical Skills
PHP
MYSQL
Ruby on Rails
Postgre SQL
Javascript
prototype
jquery

Hi,

In our last discussion, i have asked for a query, that samba share is very
slow.  I have solved this issue.  I dont know the exact reason, but the
following are the ones i did.

1. Added the linux machine to windows domain using kerberos.
2. the /etc/hosts was earlier changed to a different name server.  I changed
it to correct one.

I could not ascertain how the issue gets solved.  But after i restarted the
server the share access was very fast comparatively to other windows share.

Although USB2Serial is fine for most occasions, you have reason to be
concerned if you are doing really low level work. A serial port is a very
simple device. When you are transmitting characters out, there are no
complex software/hardware layers involved. If the kernel state is
unstable/unknown due to bugs in whatever modules you are programming, you
can still read kernel OOPs messages and other important messages from other
kernel low level sub-systems. When the kernel console device is as simple as
a traditional PC serial port or equivalent, you are in the best position to
read kernel error/warning messages.

OTOH, when you are using USB2Serial conversion, low-level kernel messages
have to traverse the complex USB stack. This may also trigger interrupts.
Depending on the stability of the kernel(and the bugginess of your module),
the message may or may not reach the host serial port. While the kernel
offers support for many devices to be used as the kernel console, the
simplest of devices are the best to use if you are into low-level
programming.

Some of the students i know dont have knowledge on PHP or MySQL..  But they

my organisation, so that they could organize gift collection easily through

their website.
[[ I would be glad to explain more on this, for implementation in other

If any of the students are interested, i would be able to guide them to help
this NGO.  Technical requirements are: PHP, MySQL, and knowledge on AJAX.

If we could match the requirements and the volunteers, a lot of benefits
will happen to both the contributors and the NGO's.

   All our applications could be released   with the open source license.
Absolutely free for the public to make use of it. One of our main objective
is to make FOSS to reach common men, make him realize how FOSS could  help

 Yes you are correct,  open web group  is an opportunity to make your dreams
come true. We welcome your ideas and
concepts, it need not to be something out of box. It could be your own
issues what you, yourself face in day to day life. All we  need is it should

Sure, we do in future. But as now we need contributors, developers, mentors
and designers

a) can we use moodle for the course  and can it be a offline tool -
which can installed on debinan/ubuntu.
 
b) also whats the best free software courseware review tool. we would
like to upload courseware and invite people to review it take review

Is there any website or colloboration tool for open web group?  Sure..  i
have a couple of such issues  that i am facing currently..   one is
implementing SSO in Windows Network for websites hosted in linux..
currently i am trying out mod_auth_kerb module for this.  Yet to get the
result..

Btw, we need to generate the resource pool for this..  I hope we could find
it from this ILUG Community itself..

Another issue that i came across was in writing out documentation..  When i
explained about the importance of documentation to my relative students, the
first thing they told was "I am not well in english"..  I told them,
documentation is only for recording what we know.. you can very well write
in tamil itself.. if needed, later on  we can translate in to english..

This is new experience to me, and i wish, we can try developing a small
application by documenting in tamil, (like requirement listing, design
etc)..

I've used Quickbase which has a nice app builder with very little  
scripting. A non-coder can build those apps. Better than Sharepoint.  
I've looked at FOSS BPM builders like Intalio etc. They still need  
more scripting than Quickbase. Wanted to tap the collective knowhow to  
see if something like this does exist which I'm ignorant of.

Subject: [Ilugc] Chennai Wiki == SPAM Centre?
Message-ID: <510523.75031.qm@web63408.mail.re1.yahoo.com>

List,

Is the wiki completely unprotected? I am shocked to
see almost every page *only* has spam and no content
at all for all genuine pages created. 

I assume the following are the reasons for this:
1. User who created that page, failed to apply a
/watch/ to it. 
2. This further lead to more spam on that page, making
it more difficult to find a correct history (when the
page was without spam) of that page to restore it
back.

Surprisingly, there are hundreds of people on the
mailing list who post queries / participate in
discussions but where are the wiki users among them? 

The immediate steps to restore the wiki could be:

1. Users who created pages, might probably know when
the did so, and are requested to click the history
section of the article (which currently displays spam)
and click on the link displaying Time, Date of the
article which supposedly is the original article. 

2. Give SysOp privileges to those who regularly edit
the wiki and protect pages such as the Main Page or
user pages thereby providing editing rights only to
sysops. (Cases where edits are required to be made by
normal users could be reported on the list or to one
of the sysops who'll do the needful)

3. Apply a watch (make that mandatory) to any page
that you create. Then, you'll know when spam attacks
your page and you can restore it immediately. By
'you', I mean any wiki user. 

If you think, you want to flame me, please do so, I'm
unaffected. Instead, if you just help edit the wiki
and restore pages to their original content, it'll
help. 

Perhaps, some wiki experts could help out to keep the
wiki more secure from random edits. (if there are
techniques available)

With the help of a few guys from GLUG-BOM, I maintain
the GLUG-BOM wiki, and have applied "watch" to most
pages which help me track spam and restore page to
their original state before spam, almost within a day.


I happen to see this state of the wiki, from a recent
post to the list about the CD Grabs page.

Thanks for sharing your solutions to the list.

In your OP, you had not mentioned that you were running a windows 
domain.  The above certainly helps your case.

err, name servers are in /etc/resolv.conf and not /etc/hosts.  This 
could have an effect if you have DNS for your internal hosts; pointing 
it to the correct name server is very important.

Not an expert on MS-CIFS but it eventually finds allowable shares.

Does this not restore your faith in open source solutions? :)

these are serious apps.  IMO, you would need people who are experts in 
these fields (not necessarily software guys).  do you have such people

Create a new user and assign him to ip address of the server. and also you
could edit existing users currently it been configured to localhost.

you need to edit that record replace localhost with %. I hope it could be a

Possibility: Go to the sound mixer, and go to preferences, here select
all the tracks to be visible. Now try setting everything at maximum.

I recently installed Ubuntu 8.04 on an Acer laptop, and had to do that
to get the sound.

Also try killing some specific application (Firefox included! in
earlier versions of ubuntu, firefox used to lock my sound device
everytime gmail made the beep sound).

I never lost my faith in open source :) .. btw, this was a good experienec,
as i configured samba for first time..

The reason why i went for this solution is to setup web dev folder for my
team..  each of my team member was configured a web folder in server apache,
and the folder was shared to them..

I created share level security and assigned the samba user to their folder..

This enables us to deploy this share as network folder and work directly on
it using eclipse running in our local desktop..  this avoids setting up
local wamp server for each of them..

Hi all,
Can someone provide some insight if gnokii supports the el cheapo handsets
like nokia 16** series?
The official page on the nokia site, however says there are no data
synchronisation possible for it/
no supported cable.
But some third party sites offer software(obv. for windoze)  that can be
used for data sync etc...
Those sites specify that the CA - 45 cable can be used.
I would like to know if someone has got any experience in connecting such
handsets to a linux box.

This is a great scenario of work group setup.  

Suggest you document your setup (the entire thing i.e. samba, apache, 
eclipse IDE on the desktops) in a wiki/blog so that others can also 
benefit from what you learnt.  You could also contribute it as an 
article to e-zines.

Anyway... I am interested in this and I am quite ok at rails. As in, I have

I do this:

1. Scan using Kooka
2. Open it in Gimp
3. Play with Color -> Levels and Color -> Curves so that I get a
histogram that has peaks near Zero and 255 (two highs at both the
extremes). Sometimes, I play with contrast as well.
4. Print.

Sorry - forgot
4. Create a new (reqd. paper size) document in Scribus
5. Insert the image into the page
6. Export as PDF
7. Email the PDF for printout.

If there is a easier method, I would be happy to listen. I found Gnome
Scan2PDF utility as not so user friendly and lacked customization
facilities.

This means that firefox (or some program that it is using like esound
or pulse or the flashplayer) is "holding" the sound device. This
prevents other programs from queueing audio stuff.

If you want multiple programs to be able to access your sound
hardware at the same time, then you need to activate the "dmix" alsa
plugins. I had this figured out a while ago and wrote the enclosed
".asoundrc" file. It works for me but I've forgotten why ;-)

If you do check this out and it works please write some documentation!

Kapil.

I think the recent version of alsa don't require mucking around with asoundrc to
enable dmix and software mixing. It works out of the box.
Right now, I don't have a custom asoundrc and I can open up as many instances of mplayer
I want.

Maybe he is using a sound server ?

I remember working on a project that redirects sound from the server to the
thin client for applications can can't be "told" to use sound servers. And
IIRC, Flash uses /dev/dsp. I don't think it does ALSA.

If you look through the shell script /usr/bin/{iceweasel,firefox} you
will find that it uses variables called ${FIREFOX_DSP} and
${AUDIOSERVER}.

I think the idea is that the user can choose which device or
pseudo-device is used as a sound device by the browser.

I believe that the same sound device is also used by plugins.
However, since one doesn't have the source to the flash plugin or the
real-player plugin one can't really be sure.

Kapil.

I had posted about a problem in emacs ruby mode regarding the capital
C not working as expected. I later found out why but did not post it
here. Here it is:

You'll  have to escape the 'C' in the following line in your .emacs:

Change it from
(define-key ruby-mode-map "C-m" 'newline-and-indent)

to
(define-key ruby-mode-map "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent)

Hey gurus - I will need to expand the / FS(ext3)  on my rhel3  machine  - it
has no LVM (meaning i am not using LVM for mounting the FS) ....it is
installed on hda2 ..given that i have some space below this partition - is
this doable from the running OS ?

i already used fdisk - deleted partition 2 - re-added the same with bigger
size - and then saved  with 'w' - i got the message that the kernel will
obey the new part table from the next reboot - but that does not seem to be
true - as it did not happen even after the reboot - I still see the old
partition table

i think i should be able to boot the machine  off a CD and do this - but
just curious if one can do this from a running OS and reboot if need be

Have not done this myself but this 
<http://www.howtoforge.com/linux_resizing_ext3_partitions> article 
suggests it is possible.  BTW, this link was right on top when I 
Google'd "linux ext3 resize"

Did this partition hold "system" files i.e. /, /etc, /usr, /boot etc.?

Most likely, if partition holds "system" files.

that the next reboot will make the kernel see the new part table .

I still remember those old days when I was using gnome. I think it

Mammootty's office has reponded to the open letter.

This is in response to the fire ignited by free software lovers of the
state against Mammootty's alleged association with Microsoft for the
Computer Literacy Programme for computer illiterates of Kerala.

In this regard Mammootty would like to make it clear that Mammootty is
in no way a part of the project. Mammootty has in no way associated
with Microsoft nor held any discussions with them. Mammootty Fans and
Welfare Association & Microsoft are envisaging the Project. As a
person Mammootty is against any kind of monopoly in any area.

Subject: [+PLUS] Open Source Developer
To: plus-discuss@lists.sarovar.org


I'm looking for an entry-level software developer to work on a series of
projects on a full-time basis.  This would be a long-term engagement as
an independent contractor.

I'm in the process of starting two businesses, one assembling and
selling Linux-based computers to small resellers, and one to develop an
educational simulation game targeting the home-school market.  Some
projects will be related to improving the usability of open-source
software that will be bundled with the computers I sell, and others will
be related to simulation game development.

The first project involves integration between OssimPlanet
(http://www.ossim.org/OSSIM/ossimPlanet.html) and Delta3D
(http://www.delta3d.org).

OssimPlanet is an open-source virtual globe, similar in many ways to
Google Earth and NASA World Wind.  Delta3D is an open-source game and
simulation engine.  OssimPlanet lacks physics, while Delta3D lacks
terrain.  OssimPlanet + Delta3D could provide an excellent base for a
simulation game set in the real world.  The projects have discussed
integration to allow them to work together, but haven't done anything
about it due to lack of resources and more urgent needs.

I'm looking for someone who is interested in taking on the necessary
integration and can commit to at least 6 months.  The work would be done
as a series of projects.  Payment would be on a per-project basis (based
on deliverables), rather than hourly.

The following are required:

-Fluency in English.
-Reliable broadband Internet access.
-Ability to work without supervision.
-Skill in C++.

Experience with OssimPlanet
(http://www.ossim.org/OSSIM/ossimPlanet.html), Delta3D
(http://www.delta3d.org), and Ubuntu Linux (http://www.ubuntu.com) would
be helpful but is not required if you're willing to familiarize yourself
with them on your own time.  Experience contributing to an open-source
project would also be very helpful but is not required.

Please email me if you would like more information.

I think he is asking how to find the block size of the filesystem. If that
is what he is looking for then,

"df" command would give you the block size.( see the column header after
you issue the command).
When I ran this command(df), I got,
"Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on" as
the header.

So, I believe the block size is 1024 bytes. Correct me if I am wrong.

Hope this helps.

from the further analysis of the problem, we found a problem
with the LSI Logic Corp MPT Boot Rom.

"No supported device found" is the error when booting the system.

we could not understand whats this. So escalated the problem to H/W vendor,
those who installed the Ultra320 SCSI Host Bus Adapter into the system.

Having any idea about this further, please guide me.

Thanks for your reply.

Message-ID: <cbaa36330805212214w67f8fa55ga7852ffc19189364@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Luggies,

I am wondered whether running a  application with strace will make it
behave differently.

My application on a ARM target board crashed consistently. The odd
thing was the log file also disappears during the mishap.

So I started the application with strace and captured the output using
a serial output.
But now the application which was frequently crashing without strace
, is not crashing.

No change was there in the environment and the code. Does strace
affects the way?

Regards
Deepak.

Sorry. You are wrong! :-(

If the file system block size is what you want then the command is

	dumpe2fs -h /dev/hda1 | grep "Block size:"

The answer is in bytes. This is for the ext2/3/4 file system on the
device /dev/hda1. 

If the block device block size is what you want then the command is

	blockdev --getsize64 /dev/hda1 

Here the answer is also in bytes for the device /dev/hda1. Note that
block-devices usually (always?) work with a sector size of 512-bytes.

Mutatis mutandi.

Regards,

Kapil.

May be. When you run the app with strace, some of critical point never
occure, due to the strace overhead/delay. Use core-dump or print to
figure out the crash point and check for the logical errors.

Time the kernel spent on the program, trying to do I/O, for example

Also try "man time"

Forget "strace". I have come across programs/device drivers that will stop
working once you remove print{f|k}s added for debugging! Various delays can
make a program work well. Is your program using a device driver you know
might be faulty? Try GDB, my friend.

# shutdown -t 10 -- Wait 10 Sec after warn the user

# shutdown -k  -- Don't really shutdown; only warn

# shutdown -r -t 5 -- Reboot after shutdown

# shutdown -h -t 5 -- Halt after shutdown

Hi,

   It seems that the BIOS is not supporting this device .   You might need
to flash/upgrade the BIOS / some configuration needs to be done in the
BIOS.  Check with  the H/W vendor.

   In the meantime, could you please tell me the Hardware Specification,
BIOS Version, linux kernel, dmesg and, lspci output.

Thanks for the answer.? If my script takes 162m total time, out of which computing time is 58m and IO operation in 2m.? Then what might be the reasons that takes remaining 102m of my script time?? 

FYI, it is a perl script doing some report generation from data in mysql db.

Checked with the Hardware Vendor. That will not do any harm to the access
of device they said. Error is only related to bootable state of that SCSI
device.

MPT Rom boot  tries to boot from the device. But there is no bootable meduim
or
device is found. So its giving this error.

Thanks for the insight. I have identified and protected a race

No problem. Glad to be of service.

Although most of the time the target Flash is pretty restrictive, I usually
have a separate, full fledged target filesystem with GDB et al, mounted over
NFS. And when you have a filesystem with all the tools you need, you
development time comes down unbelievably. My second preference would be to
use gdb-server on the target and gdb itself on a less restrictive host.

Maybe you need to write an open letter to Mammooty Fans Association  
showing how it is better to combat computer illiteracy using free  
software.

Hi All,

thanks rohan that you pointed out about the chennailug.org spamming. we have
revamped the our website chennailug.org year back i guess.
I would like to get it revamped with fresh wiki pages and other contents.

currently we have *1214* registered users

List of To-Do
1. clean up wiki pages
2. Install spam control for wiki
3. Migrate CivicCRM Drupal to higher versions Drupal if possible(v5.x or v6)

4. Design new Look and Feel for the site
5. Designated people who can maintain about the chennailug events happening
in chennai and update them on the site/wiki accordingly.

Please let me know if any of you interested.

What do i get by doing this?
- you can add yourself in your profile that you are maintaining
chennailug.org community site.
- chennailug.org site will put up the list on the website.
- you gain knowledge about drupal, civicCRM, wiki

We got clarity of who is doing what. Now we have to talk to the Fans
Association and we can even try to get Mammootty associated with Free
Software if he is sincere about his committment to supporting causes
for social welfare.

   Fdisk is not the right tool for it.  It only changes the partition..
   doesn't change the file system..  you will require a utility that can also
   dela with filesystem. Parted fits in well for your requirement.

   I havent tried using it before.. Was always lucky to have data on a LVM
   :).

   The man page says it is possible to extend space without destroying data..
   My suggestion is to back-up data before trying this.. I haven tried it
   myself

   But in ur case you have already changed the partition.. so i am not sure
   how this will work.. best way would be to re-create the same partition
   with fdisk.. then use parted.

   how r u checking your filesystem size? df? df displays size based on fs
   properties.. so even if you have a larger partition without extending the
   filesystem.. that would be the case... to confirm check the /proc/ info
   for exact kernel status of the disks...

 i think i should be able to boot the machine  off a CD and do this - but
 just curious if one can do this from a running OS and reboot if need be
  

   Partprobe should force your kernel to read your partition table without
   re-booting..  Never edit partitions for file systems which are already
   mounted. if normal data partitons no re-boot would be required.. if any of
   the system partitions are used, you will require rescue CD.

   Do let us know how u r about to burn ur hands. ;)

Dear All
As already informed about "clearing" very old computers from my school 
at salem, i have sold 286, 286, and 486 machines for Rs. 14/- per k.g.
by next week , few PI, PII with 166 MHz, 233 MHz with 16MB , 32MB RAM 
will be sold [ for Rs. 16/- per k.g ? ] .

Few members of this ILUGC contacted me, but all are pre occupied  or 
having some practical difficulties.

Since i am in Salem, Tamil Nadu., i can not "send" the machines to any 
other place , also , people who need these computer , may not come and 
get it [ no time and not cost effective ].

This is the fact, [ we talk about, "re using" old computers, give to 
"Charity", "Environmental Hazard" etc.. , but the reality needs more 
planning and hardwork ]

There is really no market for these kind of comps.  I have several such 
comps. gathering dust.  The best one can do is salvage the working HDDs 
for reuse but then again given their age they could fail any time.  I 
use them on experimental machines only.

(Sent once a few hours ago but I guess its lost in transit. So resending...)

Ever wondered what it takes to build a searchable database out of the wondrous
World  Wide Web?   Does  it excite  you to  write  software that  will manage  a
five-figure  number of  machines? Do  you believe  your software  should  do the
actual work while you spend your valuable time brainstorming a new software idea
at the snooker table?

We, in the Yahoo! Search Technology Content Operations team, do what it takes to
keep the underlying systems running better  and faster in order to keep Yahoo!'s
view of the WWW  up-to-date, relevant and fast.  If it means  seeing a method to
the madness of random disks failing  across a very large cluster of machines, so
be it.  If it means, we as the gate keepers of the whole setup, have to automate
testing the content building software to meet operating criteria, so be it.

About  our team:  Our team  deploys  and ensures  smooth running  of the  Search
Database content generation systems.  "Ensuring smooth running" is a big task by
itself and that involves writing a lot of software tools.

Given the large scale of  our setup, traditional problem solving techniques need
to  be approached  from  a new  set of  angles  simultaneously. To  give you  an
example,  a tiny  cluster (of  a  few dozen  machines) wouldn't  be affected  by
failing hard-drives because  probability of disks failing on  a given machine is
low. However, put thousands of machines into  the picture and we now have one of
these improbable events happening pretty frequently! We have about a dozen disks
failing  every day  and  so it  definitely  pays to  find out  the  causes on  a
continuous basis.

Now, we need a few more passionate people who not only have a zeal for operating
large scale systems but also have Automation in their blood.  Want to join us?

You should have solid software operations skills with the drive to fix issues as
they  arise  and the  knack  to  identify needed  tools  and  build those  tools
too. Your duties will be focused on:

  * Working with the rest of the team in knocking off ad-hoc maintenance tasks

  * Having and using the  wisdom to take a step back and  ask "How can we avoid
    doing these repetitive maintenance tasks?"

  * Contributing  independently to  build tools  that keep  the  search content
    building systems up and running

  * Communicating by  ways of documenting and mentoring  in an open-source-like
    Development Environment.

Needed Qualifications:
  * Proficiency in Perl, Shell Scripting
  * Very good knowledge of building web-based dashboards (CGI-Perl, PHP, etc.,)
  * Strong understanding of Unix systems and tools
  * 3+ years of experience developing Unix tools (in Perl / Shell)
  * Strong commitment to jump in and fix issues as they arise
  * Decent understanding of Networking concepts
  * Excellent trouble-shooting skills
  * Excellent Written and Oral skills
  * A BE/BS in CS/EE or Equivalent

Good-to-Have:

I assume you meant SVNReporter. You could use statsvn. It can generate
the report based on no of lines, no of committers, evolution of
directories, files, etc. I've not used this tool yet, but sounds like
it can generate the report in html format.

On the other hand, if you want to generate the pleasing reports for a
open source project, you could consider to use oholo. It is a hosted
solution. Once you configure your project, you could get various
reports: by developer, by region, by programming language, etc. It is
too good.

Hi

Apparently, there is an enterprise where they extract Gold from
electronic hardware. They put the PCBs in strong acids, which will
dissolve everything except gold and recover the gold used to make the
contacts inside ICs in the PCB.

Maybe you could try that.

AFAIK, this is done in a place called 'Byatrayanpura' in Bangalore.

Akarsh

Thanks for every one for the attention span given to my request and given me
some
tips to look further in this.

This problem got solved with the re installation of the same SCSI card and

This was happened only because of H/W lose contact.

Its better not to use this service and contribute to poisoning the

dispose them off safely. Maybe a space ship that will get rid of these

I don't know how they are disposed. Possibly they are reused till they
are useless and then neutralized with alkali and thrown away, in which
case it should be safe. However, in case you do plan to use this
service, you should probably find out how they are disposing the acid
and ensure that it is environment friendly.

Thanks for pointing that out, Mano. Didn't think of that earlier.

The problem is that the gold recovered by such methods is simply not
enough to finance waste treatment. Otherwise the corporates would've
entered it by now. So, my guess is that the wastes are just dumped
into the sewers!

Even if the acids are neutralized with alkalies, the resultant
solution will still have very very high dissolved solids content that
it will be beyond environmentally safe limits. Not to mention the
nickel, cadmium etc that are found in electronic circuits and to
dissolve which the acid was originally used.

Really, these are very very 'inconvenient truths' the tech industry
would like to wish away :-) Request you all to watch that movie. Its
been on TV for some weeks now.

Nowadays most of the TV program allows the viewer to rate their

send sms to some number say 5657 to vote for team A .

My question is how thing works ? what is that 5657 represents mobile
phone or computer ?  what are all the protocols involved ? how the sms
is received and processed ?

I want to know this because i going to use this sort of technology in

Tell them your intention and ask them for opt in instead of just sending 
them every week (and possibly ticking them off).  Did you intend to 
send them from GMail?

Look for list server like mailman.

SPAM is in the eye of the receiver.  Depends on the contents of your 
newsletter.  If you are peddling something then certainly most would 
construe it as SPAM.

5657 is a "short code" provided by the Telco.  Note that you need to
procure a short code from every provider -- Airtel, Reliance, RPG, etc.
so they can route the SMS destined for that short code to your end.

If you are handling a large volume of SMS, then it's best that the Telco
directly routes the SMS to your computer.  You don't need a cell phone
at your end.  However, your computer needs to support the appropriate
SMS routing/delivery protocols -- TAP, SNPP, UCP, etc.

Once the SMS is delivered to your computer, you can parse it and take
any action you desire.


If you just want to test this with a low volume of SMS messages, then
just plug any compatible cell phone to your computer with the appropriate
software.  Eg. A nokia phone with gnokii.

Can we get BIS to back this appeal, considering it has voted no and
raised concerns about the process?

If you are looking for low volumes, you can try things out at home by
purchasing a GSM Modem and by using Kannel Gateway (http://www.kannel.org).
See the SMSCs list here http://kannel.org/compatibility.shtml. I remember
using a Wavecom GSM Modem that connects via the serial port. The modem I had
was not supported by Kannel, but I was able to tweak the existing driver to
make it work with the newer model. Having the source code is so much more
fun, ain't it?

IIRC, Kannel gateway is capable of posting the contents of the SMS recieved
to any specified URL. I used a simple PHP script to recieve the SMS and then
do whatever I wanted to do. You can also send out SMSs(e.g confirmations) by
posting to an URL that Kannel Gateway makes available. But GSM Modems may be
difficult to locate in India. I got mine from Singapore. Kannel is much more
powerful - if you are only using the SMSC, it is probably overkill. Of
course, you need a SIM card for the GSM Modem to work.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] ekiga setup ...
Message-ID: <200805241558.09062.knura@yahoo.com>

I am trying to use ekiga but have not had much success.

During setup of the ekiga client it correctly detects that my system is 
behind a NAT and configures it appropriately.  The client is able to 
login to "ekiga.net" and I guess I am "online" because I am notified of 
incoming calls.

However, when I accept the call, I cannot hear the far party nor can the 
far party hear me.

My network setup is as follows:

                     |
  ekiga client-------|                   |
                    *|-------------------|
                                        +|--------- Internet (ADSL)

ekiga client is 192.168.1.68 (Ubuntu 8.04, ekiga v2.0.12)

* Linksys WiFi AP - LAN port is 192.168.1.1, WAN port is 192.168.0.9 
(Nodes on LAN NAT'd on the WAN port)

+ DLink DSL502T router/modem - LAN port is 192.168.0.1, WAN port is dyn. 
IP (PPPoE)
(Nodes on LAN NAT'd on the WAN port)

Would appreciate pointers from anyone who has used ekiga successfully - 
please share your setup.

TIA

heh - good one on the parted - I havent tried that - and about the resizing
partitions on the fly

I have had good success in the past with non / FS - for example imagine the
following - you have a FS on a logical drive on a RAID1  mirror with 2*36G
drives - now you want to upgrade the drives to 2*72G - you replace the first
drive let it resilver then the second - then fdisk --> go to expert mode -
change the # of cylinders for the LD and then edit the partition size
.........ext2online bingo!

Apparently, Violin memory has also launched a 500 gig one.

Curious to understand how the quest-for-RAM is going to shape up, given the
fact that facebook is running the entire user db in their gargantuan
servers(32TB in RAM!).  RAM gives only a linear speed-up O(n) , when
compared to efficient indexes which have O(log n).

How do you compare the two - One (RAM) is a storage medium, whilst the other

===============================
Visited a middle school in Viluppuram to help with the Linux Desktop
provided by ELCOT. There were 2 computers (Lenovo Think Centre, Duocore
processor, 512 MB RAM, wide screen LCD monitor with SuSe 10.1 installed).

1. The system is too slow. Disabling some of the services increased the
speed a little. Using Open Office the response time is too long.

2. The DVD given by Lenovo (Enterprise Desktop 10.0) is not related to the
installed version (Open SuSe 10.1)

3. Internet connection worked. Sound works, display works. To run dat format
files from CDs, created a Desktop short cut
mplayer vcd://1

4. To run exe files (of some educational CDs), downloaded and installed
wine. The exe file was basically calling some flash files.

5. Tried installed kdeedu package. Could not get the right version.

First the non-technical babble:
You application crashes once in a while? An ominous sign indeed. Why don't
you fix this first? Watchdog timers are only when your application crashes
unexpectedly.

Technical:
Are you able to verify that the watchdog daemon is running? If /dev/watchdog
present and accessible? Can you manually verify that the system reboots if
the watchdog's timer is not refreshed? Let us initially rule-out issues in
the watchdog driver in the kernel.

All the best,

Sure. I have found the issue and I have fixed it. It was a Heisenbug.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug#Heisenbugs

It was due to enormous amount of unlinks without closing the fds
associated with the file.

> Technical:

/dev/watchdog is present.  but i dont see any watchdog process running
in the system.

 Can you manually verify that the system reboots if
> the watchdog's timer is not refreshed? Let us initially rule-out issues in
> the watchdog driver in the kernel.

Sorry I am forced to ask you back how to do this.How to refresh the
timer from our application. I am using busybox 1.6.1

One more doubt.. whether the device shown in /dev/watchdog is a
softdog or hardware watchdog.

Any pointers towards these documentation is most welcome. I am not
able to locate them.

Hi,

Oxygen and Plasma team are on hunt for volunteers to maintain their websites - http://www.oxygen-icons.org/ and http://plasma.kde.org/

Most of the work would be around site-updating. HTML, CSS, PHP skills seem to suffice the requirement for now.

If anyone would want to get involved, please contact Riccardo (ruphy at irc.freenode.net) on #oxygen.

Thanks,
krish

Just two weeks back, i successfully configured samba in RHEL 5.  Although i
configured it in command line, later i found RHEL 5 has simple GUI for easy
configuration.

Pls check if you have any such desktop GUI application in Ubuntu server
edition for configuring samba.

The watchdog device is a softdog. A daemon needs to be running.

I'm not too sure if BusyBox provides a watchdog daemon binary option. But I
guess it would, given that BusyBox is used so much in embedded systems these
days. The concept of the watchdog daemon is pretty simple. It has a config
file /etc/watchdog.conf where you can specify various tests. If one of those
tests fail, it will stop writing to /dev/watchdog causing the system to
reboot.

These included tests for memory, number of processes in the process table,
test for a particular process, etc. A simple way to get this up and running
on your target is to initially install the "watchdog" package on your host.
Then simple do a "man watchdog" and "man watchdog.conf" to read up on the
various options this daemon provides.

Using watchdog daemon. See src/busybox-xyz/miscutils/watchdog.c

> softdog or hardware watchdog.

Normally it is a software. But you can link it with hardware by
loading proper device driver.

The watchdog daemon which comes with busybox is a very simple one. It
just kick the dog for every T secs. I hope, even the new version, only
the -t option is supported. (I use busybox-1.01).

If you want this watchdog to monitor your apps, then apps needs to
create apps.pid file at starting stage and this watchdog needs to be
modified to check the pid file(s) regularly at T sec. If any of the
apps/pid not responding then watchdog must reboot the board.

You can check up the normal watchdog src to get more idea about this
implementation.

Read src/linux-2.6/Documentation/watchdog/

 The modem is inbuilt into the telephone device and its HUAWEI wireless
modem (HUAWEI T-1 ETS-2288).
 It is connected to the PC through a COM3 port using the USB.

 In linux i just tried to change the wvdial.conf and tried the 'wvdial'
command. And the wvdialer reported
 the '/dev/modem/' not found.

In wvdial.conf, the default string for modem is /dev/modem. It is must
be replaced with the correct ttyS. Example:  Modem = /dev/ttyS2 (COM3
== ttyS2).  If ttyS2 is not working then try one by one from ttyS0 to
ttyS6 :)

Read man wvdial.conf

I just did an "aptitude upgrade" of my Debian Etch system at home. After

repeated multiple times :-( The system is well maintained. It is a AMD64

as the system will not boot if it is enabled.

I searched the web but could not find any solution to this. Any help will be

After a long struggle i came to know about how to configure kannel sms
gateway the official document was very technical contains all the possible
configuration details ,i was using my friends  Sony ericsson w80i mobile as
GSM modem to test this thing , unfortunately that mobile does not supports
the AT command to read sms from smsbox . One more problem with kannel is ,
it generate too many entries in log file ,
size of bearerbox.log went beyond 10GB because of some file permission
problem.Later i managed to make it work properly .

i am not in position to proceed furthur with my "SMS Travle Guru " (
http://sivaji.freehostia.com/project/sms-travel-guru/abstract.txt)  project
because i dont have GSM modem/mobile phone and i am not in position to buy a
gsm modem that support all the AT command ,i will be so thankful if NRCFOSS
or CDAM members came forward to  sponsor/lend me a GSM modem/mobile phone
.you can ping me offline for furthur details .

I think the modem also has a regular ethernet port.

As far as the USB connection is concerned, I haven't used it myself.
This may need usb_net driver and ppoe --- but I am just guessing.

Have look at the hints on broadbandforum.in

This is certainly mysterious. It is possible that in the process
of the upgrade you installed the wrong kernel.

Boot using rescue media and install the correct kernel and initrd.

Don't know if it relevant but nonetheles, I'll share my experience with 
XUbuntu upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04.  Even though I accepted the package 
manager's grub menu.lst, it was all messed up (I have Xubuntu desktop 
on one partition and Ubuntu 7.10 server on another partition).

I hand edited the menu.lst before rebooting the system and things were 
fine :)

I used the Debian Etch release 0 DVD, "rescue" mode. I started a shell in
the root partition and located the Linux-Image on the DVD. The version on
DVD was 2.6.18-4-686. The installed version was 2.6.18-6-686. The
Linux-Image installed without any errors, but on rebooting, 2.6.18-4-686
gives the same old error as 2.6.18-6-686 :-(

Dudes,

Ubuntu Tamil Team is on the eve of entering its third year. Ubuntu Kaippidi 
Thozargal Scheme is about to get launched. And we also wanna help Mr. Heron's 
catching easier. 

Hope no one needs a better reason than these three to come together.

Do join us at 4.30 PM of 31 May 2008, at Hotel Woodlands of Narada Gana Sabha, 
TTK Road, Alwarpet, Chennai to share tea and rejoice.

Do not forget to invite others around you and lets' make this a memorable 
event.

When you have such huge  RAMS, will the cache transfers be efficient since a
single miss will mean searching the entire RAM again... Al this while, We
had P*(Speed of cache retrieval) + (1-p)*(Speed of RAM retrieval). When hit
rate -> 1, the entire thing speeds up. But here, the time to locate on the
RAM might be significant too right?

IIRC, these systems were enterprise class in the same league as IBM's 
high end.

SGI would be the best people to answer the question.  Technology wise, 
their reputation is solid.

RAM is addressed and not searched.  What do you mean by searching
entire RAM for a cache miss?

I've not seen this formula in the literature.  Can you please explain what P,
"speed of foo retrieval" means?

Firstly, it is pointless to keep /etc as a separate file system.
Secondly, as long as '/' is not affected, you can do without a reboot.
All you'll probably need to do is to unmount and remount the file
system in question and that would be as easy as switching to
single-user mode and back. Practically its as good as a reboot but you
can still keep your nice uptime figures and boast about it ;)

Hi,

This is probably old news, but I'm sure most people are
unaware of this:

Several IIT lectures are available for free on YouTube.

Topics range over a wide variety of engineering disciplines.

Personally, I'm very happy to see our Indian institutions
also doing this.

Nice.

I was unaware of this, too. There was a series by Prof. V Balakrishnan
that was shot. I'm not sure whether that was for this programme -
strangely it doesn't seem to be up.

In Ubuntu 8.04, the php imap libraries are in the php5_imap package.  
Check for a similar package name in SuSE 10.1 Yast package installer.

Not necessary to download and compile, see above.

hi all,

i have installed eclipse in my sstem. it shows a error when i initiate it.
the error message is as follows

A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK)
must be available in order to run Eclipse. No Java virtual machine
was found after searching the following locations:
/usr/lib/j2sdk1.4-sun/bin/java

i have installed java in the /home/sutha/ folder in my system. and have set
the path by adding the following lines into the .bashrc file


PATH=/home/sutha/java/jdk1.5.0/bin:/home/sutha/java/jdk1.5.0/lib::${PATH}

JAVA_HOME=/home/sutha/java/jdk1.5.0

export JAVA_HOME PATH



also while trying to run java programs using anjuta when i use the menu
option to build the output is as follows

compiling file:sutha.java
javac "sutha.java"
sh:javac:command not found

total time taken:0 secs

 but i am able to compile the same file in anjuta using the terminal tab and
giving commands there.

what is the problem? any problems in setting path for java? what should i

I have a soft link to a JRE in the eclipse path.
Inside the ECLIPSE folder, I have a the following link

kumar@Ayodhya:/opt/SDE4.0-Professional/eclipse$ ls -al | grep jre
lrwxrwxrwx   1 kumar kumar     19 2008-05-09 19:28 jre -> ../jdk1.5.0_14/jre/

Please note that the link is to the JRE folder within the JDK.


Also, IIRC .profile was read by many systems automatically. .xinitrc
might also be a good place to add your PATH stuff.

HTH.

Yahoo !
i do not know, Since i am a lover of Yahoo services.
i always say Yahoo is the best, [ for me ]
It is True , most of the times, yahoo gives better result than google on 
"web links"
But , when it comes to "image" search , my vote goes to google.

Well, Shall i know, What OS and "Searching Software ? "  they use ?
i think,
Google : GNU / Linux [ Debian ? ]
Yahoo! : FreeBSD


have a nice day

Hi Guys,

Please spend half a minute and pledge to download Firefox 3 on the release

Though we know that Firefox will get more downloads on the release date,
this will help you in reminding the download on the release date.

Why would I download it from the site when it is available packaged 
within the distribution? Linux users by and large use pre-packaged 
software in the distribution. The downloads from the project website is 
heavily skewed towards Windows users.

Typically, this manifests with bad hardware.  Verify by booting, using a 
LiveCD (e.g. Ubuntu 8.04).  I am guessing the kernel is timing out with 
hard disk access - don't hold me to it :)

> any solution.

You will have to figure this out by stripping components from the 
system, use a LiveCD and identify which component is causing the 
problem.  Suggest start with removing the hard disk.

In one of my client's system, the RTC clock was flaky, the system would 
boot but I would get EIP randomly; had to replace the mobo.

+1. I always like to use softwares from my package manager, rather
than compiling unless until required.

I didn't know this. Thanks for sending this.  IITs are a product of
Nehru's vision. Thinking about this I had jumped from techonology to
economics.   Did see a networking course and was impressive.

Though lot of people have criticism on Nehru's socialist vision : The
fact is that the IIT's (and all the recognition they and their alumnus
get) are an outcome of just those policies, "ensuring highest-quality
education regardless of economic status"

This kind of high quality education - regardless of economic status is a
very important need to today ...especially primary education - there are
attempts to privatise and derail this - this will not do us good - 

this is also an important  example of what is possible when government
can work keenly on community initiatives.

hi,
 
the links between techonolgy and freedom - of course for those who want

http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/institute/history.php
 

Pandit Nehru in his first convocation address in 1956 said "Here in the
place of that Hijli Detention Camp stands the fine monument of India,
representing India's urges,India's future in the making. this picture
seems to me symbolical of the changes that are coming to India." 
 
In Sept. 15, 1956, the Parliament of India passed an act known as the
Indian Institute of Technology(Kharagpur) Act declaring this Institute
as an Institute of national importance. The Institute was also given the
status of an autonomous University. From this modest start in 1950, IIT
Kharagpur has been engaged in a steady process of development with about
18 academic departments, five centres of excellence. the vast tree-laden
campus, spreading over 2100 acres has a self contained township of over
15,000 inhabitants. Currently we have about 450 faculty, 2200 employees
and 2700 students on the campus.

Why not use the latest Fedora 9?  The above at best are about 2 years

At it's most basic level, Wuala is an online storage service. Like
other services it aims to allow you to access your files from
anywhere.  The big difference that sets Wuala apart from other
offerings, such as Amazon's S3, is that Wuala is peer-to-peer.

Interview with ESR (Jan 1, 2008) by Glyn Moody

Eric Steven Raymond has played a key role in the history of open
source. In 1997, he published The Cathedral and the Bazaar (CatB), his
seminal analysis of why the open-source development approach works so
well. He was one of a group who came up with the term open source and,
until 2005, was President of the Open Source Initiative (OSI), which
he co-founded. After years as one of computing's most vocal and
colorful characters, Raymond has been conspicuous by his absence
recently. He tells Glyn Moody why, looks back over the ten years since
CatB was published, and forward to the future of open source and its
ideas.

Subject: [Ilugc] Scene from Azhagan movie
Message-ID: <20080529162023.GA12025@saraswathy.madambakam.org>

Since Dr. Bharathi Subramanian is suffering from concussion I thought I
could give you some temporary relief with some useless babble.

But before that a scene from Azhagan movie by K Balachander. 

Mamooty is presiding over a dance programme by Bhanupriya. Geetha is in
the audience and she laments the lack of a better personality.

Basically Mamooty was being used as a substitute since Padma Subramaniam
could not make it to the occasion.

But Mamooty with his humor and humility won over the entire audience
including Geetha by saying that he was being used as 'rava uppuma' and
that sometimes even Rava upma could be tasty. 

Anyway I am serving you rava upma since 'One day One linux command' is
taking a well needed rest.

I could give you some tips since I have a very long UNIX love affair.

UNIX for me is like cricket or movies for most of you.

(And I like neither. Tamil movies are fine however)

Anyway here we go.
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
1) How to find the frequency of your monitor (refresh rate in X)?

Start X and type

$ xrandr

$ xvinfo

and 

$ xdpyinfo

are also useful.

Try it out. This tip was published in linuxjournal.


+----------------------------------------------------------------+
2) How to interpret diff files? How to create a patch?

I used to have trouble with this ages ago and I bugged my boss to teach
me this when I was working in Bangalore.

I admit that it takes a bit of practice to interpret diff output
correctly. And no open source project will accept patches from you if
you don't send them a unified diff.

So the default context diff output will not work.

Just passing the  '-u' flag to diff or cvs diff will do most of the
time.

I sometimes give  '-Naur'. man diff will help you further.


Another thing. I am a vim fanatic and it is much easier, smoother and
cooler to read diffs with vim.

And there is also a vimdiff that can be used for merging source files.

vim does a fantastic job as usual enhancing productivity in a big way.

The diff algorithm basically works like this:

  What needs to be done to file2.txt to make it file1.txt ?

   $ diff file1.txt file2.txt

And lines added and deleted are prepended with 'a' and 'd' with 'c'
standing for changed lines.

Already this has gotten too long but you get the idea right?

+----------------------------------------------------------------+
3) Detecting corrupted file transfers

This tip was published in linuxjournal as tips.

No big deal though. Most of you guys will already know this one.

When you read a CD/DVD or USB stick or even from the network or disk,
sometimes data gets corrupted and we wish to ensure that the file was
retrieved correctly.

You could do a diff of course but for binary data there are better
things to do.

$ sha1sum 

or 

$ md5sum 

followed by the file name at both ends will tell you if you were messy
in handling your CDs.

And of course there is no need to compare the whole output. Typically
the first 4 and last 4 HEX digits will do.

+----------------------------------------------------------------+
4) Now for some mplayer magic.

But of course yes. ;)

How can life be interesting without music? And video? ;)

We guys are so deeply interested in entertainment that we need a dash of
it in our daily lives to keep us going.

It helps us escape from reality for a while and with UNIX you can do a
fantastic job.

My mplayer article gives you some things you can try.

http://linuxjournal.com/9787

But we are talking about tips here. Let us try some audio stuff.

$ mplayer pattuppove.mp3

will play the superb song from Chembaruthi by Isai Raja Illayaraja.

But if you want it with salt and pepper, try this.

$ mplayer -af extrastereo pattuppove.mp3

or 

$ mplayer -af extrastereo=3 pattuppove.mp3

You could also try this.

$ mplayer -softvol-max 10000 -softvol pattuppove.mp3

and press the '*' key to increase the volume. Your ears will go deaf.

And you can try some cool stuff with play , the companion of sox.

You can try echo effects, reverberation and other things.

Once again my article will help you a bit.

http://linuxjournal.com/node/1005773

I have also written about it in my linuxforums home page.

http://www.linuxforums.org

And now for something interesting.

You can loop songs like this.

$ mplayer { pattuppove.mp3 masimasam.mp3 } -loop 3

$ mplayer { pattuppove.mp3 masimasam.mp3 } -loop 0

will loop infinitely. ;)

Have fun!


+----------------------------------------------------------------+
5) Networking fun

There is no fun in using a computer with connection to the Internet and
I don't even touch a PC with a 10 foot bargepole if there is no Internet
access and of course UNIX running on it.

netcat is well covered in my linuxforums page.

$ nc -l -p 1234

will start a TCP server for you to test your BE socket projects. ;)

$ nc localhost 1234

will speak to it and you can chat.

$ socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/foo

will open a LOCAL (UNIX domain ) socket for you.

$ curl 

and 

$ dict

are other cool programs to try.

Of course wget.

$ wget -O 

will help you save files with your own chosen name.

And other nice options in wget include

 -b and -c. Of course for recursive crawling you can use regexes.

I am still not too happy with certain lack of features in wget though.

I think that is it.

More later.

Have a nice time playing with computers.

The download request will be redirected to a mirror nearest to *your* IP

Sourceforge, Google and many other large sites do it.

among the plethora of links I got while I searched Yahoo for ["Top posting"
mails]
the following two observations may be instructive, especially for newcomers
[of course, most of these observations must have been made already in this
mailing list]:

(a) an old mail sent 5 years back

From: Mathias Bauer <Mathias.Bauer@sun.com>
Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2003 10:39:07 +0100

if you are forwarding a private e-mail to somebody else, top posting is the
best choice. But if you are participating in a public discussion (on a
mailing list or in a newsgroup), the mails should try to resemble a "real"
discussion as close as possible. And that's the reason why I prefer "in
betweenposting"

(b) from our good friend widipedia
Inline replying style (or "interleaved reply", "point-by-point rebuttal",
though it is sometimes also called "bottom-posting") was the original
Usenet<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet>standard invented and used
years before the existence of the
WWW <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWW> and the widespread public use of
email <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email> and the
Internet<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet>in general.
[16]<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_posting#cite_note-interleave_standard-15>It
is a format that can include "top-posting" for comments that need to
precede one's response to specific points of what is being responded to. It
can also include "bottom-posting" for introducing new material or
summarizing what has been said in response to specific points of the text
being replied to.

My addl comments :
1)  I tend to follow Mathias Bauer's prescription, and prefer "inbetween" or
"inline" posting most of the time.

2) Most importantly, I would like to chop off as much of the original post
and  retain only a few lines to maintain continuity of the discussion.

3) Being in a mailing list for discussions, we can avoid top posting. But WE
NEED NOT shoot off a mail for every top posting, especially when it does not
affect the flow of discussions. If one feels so strong, a mail to the sender
-- off the list -- should do.

Happens quite a bit because people are too lazy to do "Compose New

What is the difference?  It does not matter what the subject matter of 
the hijacker is, be it be "netiquette admonishments" or a technical 
query, or whatever.  S/he has hijacked the original thread/discussion 
with an unrelated subject matter.

Try Firefox 2.x.  

FF 3b5 (Ubuntu 8.04) was behaving weird whenever I clicked on a URL in 
an email (Kmail).

That is quite interesting. I find the wisdom of the crowds - flickr
based image search - much better for most things. Where it doesn't
work is for celebrities / models types searches. It definitely works
much better. Here is an example:

http://flickr.com/search/?w=all&q=jaguar&m=tags

Yahoo! uses FreeBSD on the front-end servers and mostly GNU/Linux
(RHEL) for the backend. The backend is mostly infrastructure from
Inktomi <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inktomi> and its a different
beast altogether. Backend is relatively much larger than the front-end
servers. The front-end servers are basically just a bunch of web
servers load balanced using Akamai's DNS service. The backend has
several different species of things co-existing and even competing :)

The 'tests' that are done inside Yahoo! claim statistically no
difference between Yahoo!'s results and Google's results for the top N
most common search terms. But I think Yahoo! Search has to improve a
lot for local queries (ex: "linux education in bangalore").

Here's something that you might find interesting:

http://developer.yahoo.com/searchmonkey/ - imagine searching for
"Linux CDs" and there being a nice result showing which ILUGC folks
have what CDs and what's their phone number - all in the search result
page!

Cheers,

  -Suraj

Airtel site had a problem in the earlier versions of FF too. In my

Message-ID: <797201.20802.qm@web7613.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hi Luggies,

After a long period i have swicthed to Redhat.
I have Installed RHEL5.
Now I have to configure DNS.
for that i searched for named.conf and got it in /usr/share/doc/bind-9.3.3/sample/etc/ then i copied to /var/named/chroot/etc/
then , I put my domain name in /var/named/chroot/etc/named.rfc1912.zones
(since this file is looks like the debian's named.conf )
then i started the named service.
the error is as follows,
# /etc/init.d/named start

Error in named configuration:

why are you loading example.com?  it is a reserved IANA domain to be 
used for illustrating DNS scenarios and *not* for production DNS.

The errors are telling that expected parameters are missing in your zone 
files, in some cases it is defaulting.

Frankly, the RHEL admin guide is the best place to start for the basics 
what you are trying to do.  Look for a doc RPM package.

It should be relatively easy for you to setup in RHEL if you have 
already done this on Debian.  Go through the .conf file and the zone 
files and clean up what you do not need (eg. example.com).

Hi,

Today, I was talking with a Unix(AIX) guy.

He told me that AIX and Mainframe are the big Unixes.
Linux is like a small kid.

He told that Mainframe is like a whale, AIX is like Elephant and Linux is
like Pet Dog.
They have their own biggest strengths. Linux can not even touch the heights
of them.

I refused him.
But he told that "You know only Linux. You never know AIX or Mainframe. Know
them and tell".

I hope that he is wrong.

As he said I know only linux.

What do you think about it?
Do anyone worked on the other unix systems?

How linux is better with other unix systems?

Thanks for your comments.

Pretty simple really, no one else has a plump cute penguin for a mascot

Other than that, one thing on top of my head is the sheer number of
weird devices Linux supports.
