Hi all,

I tried to setup Squid proxy server. After the configurations, 
when I restart/start the service it says ERROR: No running copy.

What could be the prob. Plz i need input on this.

There is another prob related to this. I run DNS server and I when I 
connect to net using PPP the local nameserver given in 
the /etc/resove.conf is changed to Vsnl DNS addresses. So the local 
network has probs. I shall deal with this and plz send me a suitable 
plan on this.

TIA
Aman

Probably If u are root ,its good that u are listed in the /etc/securetty (as psuedo term) which restricts ftp login.(this is a must,as root should not have ftp permission..against law)
If u have tried and failed as ordinary user,then check out the /etc/ftpusers file.If ur username is listed in that,then u are likely to be denied the ftp service.
thanks

Hi all,
   In Qt designer, I created one application after that I want to
   make some addition in the GUI part. Can I insert GUI components
   manually in cpp and .h files ?

   Suppose if I go thru the regular steps then all the modifications
   I did previously may go off.

   How to do it ??? :(

Message-ID: <200208021703.WAA07552@hd2.dot.net.in>

[cross posted to ilugc and BSD-India]
Hello,

	I find myself in the enviable position of being able to influence corporate 
IT policy, after having spent long hours battling management and finally 
getting them to see the benefits of going with Open Source solutions over 
MS/Oracle et al. (I use the term Open Source vaguely, I mean non-proprietary, 
GPL/BSD/Moz/etc.), I have been asked to draft a rough version of what the 
policy should be. 

	The corporation I work for covers a whole lot of areas, including broadcast, 
production, services industry (hotels etc), and finance; so the policy can 
just be generic in order to provide guidelines for future reference. Can 
anyone offer advice / help, or point me to any advocacy sites that would be 
useful.

ps : Does anyone here think posting to /. woud help?

Thanks

Modifications to the GUI should NOT be made to the *.cpp, *.h
files. Qt designer has to be invoked using the .ui file which was
created, and the components can be added. The cpp, h files
have to be recreated using uic.

Moreover, the *.cpp, *.h files should never be modified by hand.
If any action has to be coded, it must be coded in a new cpp file
which derives the original file. The Qt manual explains it clearly.

Hi,
I have a dual boot machine RH 7.0 and win2k, which i boot thro lilo, and this works fine. 
I came across a how-to on the net, http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/Linux+NT-Loader.html
which basically says how to Boot Linux from the win2k/NT Boot Menu. 
I copied the first 512 bytes and referanced it from the boot.ini file. 
The linux option appeared on the Boot Menu of win2k. However, selecting it gave the error "Linux 8080808080....." and it  basically hung . Help!!!!

What is the purpose of the policy?  Anyway, here are some thoughts.

 1. If there is a task to be performed and there is a free software
 equivalent to some commercial tool the management could keep the free
 software in mind.

 2. If there is a possibility of enhancing software will the
 corporation offer support or offer to help?

I think plain awareness about OSS and knowledge of its usefulness and
quality is valuable.

It really depends on what you want to do.  Are you going to be selling
the software or is the software going to be used in house?  I.e. is
the software life and death for the corporation?  For instance the
choices an academic institution makes can be very different from those
of a software company.

Hello,

> What is the purpose of the policy?  

The purpose of this corporate IT policy is very straight forward : to provide 
a set of guidelines fo all future procurement / out-sourcing / development of 
software (henceforth app). 

Well, strict guidelines. My current thinking (helped by a post in the BSD 
list) is OSS will be default. If an open source app is not a available, 
closed source apps wil be considered for OSS operting systems. If this not a 
choice, then, and only then will a any other alternatives be looked into. 
Right tool for the job.

>  1. If there is a task to be performed and there is a free software

Like I said, it will eb the other way around, OSS is default :)

>  2. If there is a possibility of enhancing software will the
>  corporation offer support or offer to help?

Yes. The corporation has previously funded development of applications 
(albiet closed source, under Linux) to serve its needs. If an opportunity is 
seen for the general community to benefit, the corporation will try and 
release any / all modifications it makes back to the community under a OSS 
license (this includes BSD, right?) Most of the work we do is on the app 
side, and very specific to our environment, but if anybody sees a use in it, 
the corporation will release it back. 

> I think plain awareness about OSS and knowledge of its usefulness and
> quality is valuable.

Uphill battle, but the LUGs have been a great help... we are slowly getting 
there... (HELP! Need more help getting desktops snazzier :)

> It really depends on what you want to do.  Are you going to be selling
> the software or is the software going to be used in house?  

99.999% inhouse development. Heck, this place runs Ingres, COBOL, SCO, Irix, 
Linux, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SAP-DB, and what-not... We need a Bismarck.

> the software life and death for the corporation?  

>From this point on, yes.

Thanks for your insights.

When unpacking kdebase-libs I get the following error.

How do I solve this conflict? Thanx for your help in advance.

I am sure you will not find any shortage of material with regards to
the merits of Free Software.  So let me just remind you about a lesser
known (or atleast less vigorously debated) point about to Free
Software licenses, specifically the GPL.

When talking to management you can emphasise the following point: just
because you license a software under the GPL, it does not mean you
have to distribute the software to all and sundry.  You only need to
make sure the entity receiving the binaries has access to the source
(to put it crudely).  And if the receiving entity has no interest in
further distributing the code, your program is as good as closed
source -- and you *are* writing "Free Software".

Consider the deals Red Hat has with Sony and others.  Red Hat signs an
NDA with Sony promising not to divulge Sony's IP.  Red Hat goes on to
use that Sony IP to make modifications to GPLed software (say GCC) and
gives it to Sony as GPLed soft.  Sony is happy and keeps the source to
itself... and so is Red Hat.

All this may not be in the true spirit of Free Software, but the suits
might just feel a little re-assured; and the letter of the GPL is not
violated.  So there!

-- 
All's well that ends.

Then have you set up any disincentives for using commercial software?

And you need interoperablity between GNU, BSD and closed source licenses,
especially if you do something cross platform :)  GNU and BSD code don't
play "good neighbor" very well ...

No disincentives. Which is why I need to policy to be non-trivially difficult

hmm.. for most part these are end-user applications. What issues am I missing

Hi all,

I tried to setup Squid proxy server. After the configurations, 
when I restart/start the service it says ERROR: No running copy.

What could be the prob. Plz i need input on this.

There is another prob related to this. I run DNS server and I when I 
connect to net using PPP the local nameserver given in 
the /etc/resove.conf is changed to Vsnl DNS addresses. So the local 
network has probs. I shall deal with this and plz send me a suitable 
plan on this.

TIA

Look at the LWP::simple module's "get" function. You will need to understand

Unless this access is required from a browser interface, why don't you
try wget directly using shell script? Wget <URL> will extract the file
to current directory. Wget -r will do a recursive extraction.

Try VideoLAN client aka vlc. RH rpms are available at
http://videolan.org. Xine can work on dvds if you have libdvdread,
libdecss and other stuff installed. most distros dont pack that since
they dont want to cross the (US) law.
You could try the Penguin Liberation Front site (http://plf.zarb.org)
to get all packages in one go though admittedly its meant for Mandrake

your script work well. But one more help
the savehim routine is not saving the file binary format.

it doesnot work when downloading the zip file

i changed your file to
#!/usr/bin/perl

use LWP;
use Symbol ;

my $Content = GetHim( 'http://www.asksathia.com/1.zip' ) or
         die "Check out the Link/Connectivity\n";

print "Retrieved Him...\n" ;

SaveHim ( 'temp.zip' , $Content );

#Subs follow
sub GetHim($)
{
   my $Request =  HTTP::Request->new('GET');

   $Request->url( shift );

   print "Retrieving Him.....\n";

   LWP::UserAgent->new->request( $Request )->content ;
}

sub SaveHim($$)
{
   my ( $FileName , $Content )   =  @_;
   my $Handle ;

   $Handle  =  gensym();

   open $Handle , "> $FileName " or die "open failed -- $!\n";

   print $Handle $Content ;

   print "Done at :$FileName:\n" ;
   close $Handle ;
}

is there any way to correct the above problem....

Although ISOs are available I would strongly recommend you to use jigdo.
Many-a-times the ISO changes while we are downloading and we end up
re-downloading the ISO. This is not only a pain on us but also on the
mirror. jigdo is nice because it redownloads only the packages that have
changed:

Suraj,
      Its always great time ,if we can discuss abt FreeBSD in our 
next meeting :)

Can someone find BSD people (from core team  maybe )to talk abt it 
?


I think Dr.Sriram is the right person,since he is using BSD for a 
loooong time :)

Dr.Sriram=>If you can spare some time,could you talk about the 
FreeBSD (or BSD as such) - its architecture,and how its different 
 from one more very popular free os :)


cheers

Hello,

	One alternative is that you can download the ISO's using
http://www.linuxiso.org. The advantage is that it goes thro a lot of FTP
servers, so you can have a lot of threads if you are using a download
accelerator like Prozilla. I have downloaded a lot of ISO's thro
linuxiso.org and haven't faced much problems. Do give it a try otherwise
you can try jigdo as suggested.

the main advantage with jigdo is that you can have a 'bleeding' CD
image. this doesn't happen with an ISO image. If an ISO image changes
you end up re-downloading the who thing again, but jigdo can download
only the changed parts and update the ISO.

Linux 8080808080?? I suppose you would have got "LILO: 80808080", or
"L8080" or something like that. Lilo prints a character ("L","I"...) after
every successful test on the system. This includes a check on the disk
geometry, partition table etc. to ensure that nothing is screwed up. 

"LILO: 8080 (in an infinite loop)" indicates that it is not able to load
the bootstrap program into memory, though all the other checks have been
fine. This could be because Linux and Win2k are installed on different
physical disks. The Windows loader goes crazy and names the physical
disks in a different order than that determined by the BIOS, so the lilo
loader will be seeing a hdc where it expected to see hda or hdb (Lilo can
also do it, but refrains from doing so except under explicit
instructions). 

This is the most likely cause of the problem. A look into your partition
table and ur lilo.conf would probably shed more light into it. Post it to
the lug - Lets
see.

Ganesh, please do your own BSD talking.  Please don't volunteer other
people to do your job.  If you want to talk about *BSD, go ahead.
Whats the point in asking Prof. Sriram (or anyone else) to do it?

You seem to be the person who knows so much about *BSD.  You are also
most vocal about it these days.  So, I think you should talk about
*BSD.  I'm sure Prof. Sriram will not mind. ;>

So on the agenda: 

  "talk about the FreeBSD (or BSD as such) - its architecture, and how
  its different from one more very popular free os :)"

Why doesn't someone talk on unix tools?  I think its time some other
volunteers apart from the usual culprits took the stage to talk.  I am
willing to talk for a small while (I always do that) or even start a
small series on something but I think there are enough people on this
list to volunteer to talk competently on something or the other.

Come to think of it Suraj hasn't talked (on stage) for a while.  Since
he started this thread I guess he owes it to us to talk about
something.  The last time he spoke was on gimp.  What Suraj? >:)

hi,

actually the debian has very less support for force installing. But
there is a interesting way how debian keeps track of this.
 
when every it installs a package, it creats some files in
/var/lib/dpkg/info/ .

go to that directory and grep for "/usr/lib/kde2/kio_help.la"  it will
show one file which contains this.open the file  and delete that line
and install ur required packages. 

every thing will go fine.

have fun
Bye

Hi

How about a "Debian Woody burn fest" or something.  Would someone with
mobile images of Woody please come to the meet?

I would suggest you use LILO for dual booting. Win2k boot loader is also
fine, but you will have to copy the MBR image created by lilo every time
you change something. If you have Win2k already installed, the easiest
thing to do is:

1. Make a copy of your win2k MBR on a floppy or elsewhere. (Just in case).
   To do this, go into "rescue mode" using the RH installation cd. This
will drop you into a shell. Execute the following command:

   dd if=/dev/hda of=/mnt/floppy bs=512 count=1
   This will copy the first sector of the hard disk onto a floppy. Make
more than one copy for redundancy sake.

2. Pop in RH 7.3 cd and start installation procedure. When you get to the
LILO loader part, it should automatically detect the presence of win2k,
and will ask you if LILO should be installed in the MBR or the first
sector of the boot partition.

3. Select MBR, and go ahead with the installation. 

4. Things should work fine when you reboot after installation, you should
be able to see both win2k and linux on the boot menu.

5. If (4.) does not succeed, you always have the floppy to boot from.

I have succesfully installed lilo in the MBR and use it to dual boot
between W2K and Linux.

Infrastructure).i have been working in these areas for the past 4 
months. if system is available i can give some demonstration 
too.

Standard redhat installation has server and networked workstation
options. Networked workstation option would be the client set up. If you
choose server setup, RH does not neccesarily install what ever packages
we wnat. It is better to go for custom install and install the specific
packages you want.

gr8. so I'm deciding that this is the agenda for this meet with a
'possible' talk on *BSD by $SPEAKER. It would be nice if $SPEAKER can
intimate me of his/her willingness to talk before today evening so that
I can put this up on the site with ease.

However it is really nice when DPS talks. oh well, I'm just requesting

prabhu> small series on something but I think there are enough people on this

and I've always heard about ppl doing leet stuff. I wish I get to hear
about one of such things on these meets. IIRC there was someone who was
writing something on pango (hindi stuff). 

like what karra said its been a long time since we had a 'fest'. Last
installfest was about an year ago (at focusite). and the last 'proper

I would be glad to talk, but I need some time for preparation. I'm not
prabhu to give 'unprepared lectures' (-; When there's time and nothing
on the agenda I'm willing to talk on APT and if ppl are interested get a
little further and talk on 'debian development tools', etc.,. But this
meet already has a good number of topics on the agenda:
 
 1. Introduction to *BSD by <identify yourself>
 2. Talk on OpenSSL/Crypto by Venki (A.Venkatesh?)

(see http://chennailug.org/ for more details)

although this will work its generally not advisable to do such things.
When you remove this package dpkg will remove only the files listed in
/var/lib/dpkg/info/<package>.list. so if you delete an entry from this
file, it wont remove this file. The proper way of doing this is:

$ dpkg -i --force-overwrite <file>.deb

When i wanted to install kde i had a similar error with kfind.
One person on irc suggested the above and another said this
could impede *apt-get's* dependency resolution. Is it true? My
understanding was apt-get was nothing but another interface
which uses dpkg.

thanks for your time and advice

Enter the root password. It will drop you into a root shell.

Run fsck on all the partitions that you have.
reboot. Enjoy

and, there have been some replies too. on a single disk machine, problems 
seldom arise. it is usually with multi-disk machines that problems arise. 
many dual boot folks would like to have separate win and linux disks. 
because of the 'high' iq of windows (perhaps, this is related to the user

windows and the boot loader (grub/lilo) should be on the 'first' disk.

thank you, thank you. well, i suppose i really do need to reply. i am not

wrong idea, i believe i have progressed to a state where i can describe my
knowledge level as low... no, really; i am not being humble and making one
of those superstar baba statements about known and unknown. well, i am
digressing already...  it is quite beyond my means to talk about the basic
differences between bsd and linux. prabhu was not much off the mark in
responding to the suggestion that i talk about bsd. if i am needed to, i
may prepare, and give a talk - and maybe even make it appear as if i know
about what i am talking. that is one of the professional hazards of being
a teacher... now, celibacy (voluntary or involuntary) is perhaps something
i could talk about with some authority, having gotten married only at the
ripe age of 34. my main difficulty these days is that mostly i am not in a
position to come to the lug meets on saturdays...

Yes, that would be very nice indeed.  If the next month is more
convenient please do give the talk then.  If OTOH this meet is fine
please feel free to talk.  I think Suraj's talk could be postponed to
the next meet (that is if he has any plans for a talk)?  This is

I doubt that this would impede apt-gets dependencies because the
package is a valid package (except for the error).  AFAIK apt-get does
the dependencies from the "Depends" field.  So if the package is there
there should be no problem.  The installation fails because dpkg is
failing when installing the package.  By using --force-overwrite you
just force dpkg to install ignoring the overwrite errors.  I've done
this several times with absolutely no adverse effects (so far).

You probably want to talk to Mahesh Shantaram. He filled out some
application form filling out "no religion", and when it was not accepted, he
got a stay order from the Bombay high court affirming that he was of no
religion. He is at http://www.techrose.org/

If that doesn't work out, ask Jace, at <jace@pobox.com>

Its very simple. There are ten commandments just in case you didn't know.

1) Grow your hair, the longer the better.
2) Water is only for drinking. Never use it for any other external use
3) Toothbrush is the instrument of M$. Besides the ingredients used in a
toothpaste is closed source. Avoid it all costs.
4) Donate all money to the nice memebers of ILUGC.
5) Shaving blade destroys environment. Don't shave.
6) Food and Code are analogues, Reuse and share both profusely.
7) In the morning the first thing to do after opening your eyeys is to
recite the Stallman GNU song
8) If you hand ever touch a windows machine. Immediately free the machine of
the M$. Pop in you GNU/Linux CD and reinstall the machine. This is the only
redemption for such a mortal sin. Watch the face of the owner of the machine
as he realises the redemption of his mahcine. The expression you can bet
will be priceless.
9) Start swearing along the along the lines of 
Holy Emacs!!
Holy Vi/Vim !! (Depends on your preference)
10) Finally the last and the foremost thing of them all...
Plain speak shall you speak. Never close source your mind. Be open.

Follow theese ten rules  and no time you shall be indoctrined in the
reiligion of being a GNU'er. Remember you are the shiny example for others,
looking at you people will embrace your new faith. 

I wish you luck.

Peace
Zameer A.

I don't think so. Vim is non-free, AFAIK. The author wants you to donate
money to some junta in Uganda, to keep vim "free". Hence, if you swear by
vim, you are not likely to be accepted as a saint of the GNU.

Yes Ravi, you won't be 100% GNU saint. As the license states 

"Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you
are
encouraged to make a donation for needy children in Uganda.  Please see
|kcc|....."

It is certainly a sect within GNU guidelenes. If you want, you can give
charity, but the code can be openly modified and reused.....

"It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following ....."

The rest you can read :help uganda. The license completly goes along the
spirit of Commandment (4).

Thanks Prabhu - that definitely puts matters to rest. Just tried
debian with a minimal install and followed up with updating to
sid (only about 100MB) and feels very comfortable - makes a
mockery of the FUD about debian being a difficult distro!!

Does anyone use XFS with debian ? Did not see a boot install
option and had to settle for ext3.

Thanks
Ashwin

IIRC, he got a certification from a Bangalore court stating he had no
religion, when he was a BSc student at St. Joseph's here. This was circa
1996. My memory is hazy, Mahesh himself is a better person to ask.

Perhaps, being a _popular_ site, it chooses to open in 
_popular_ browsers only?

PS. Tried Opera on Linux? That's a good fallback browser I
use on occasion instead of Moz.

Hi Friends,

I have shifted to Apache 2.0.39. I get the following error when I 
start it. But apache starts and runs  fine.

So, I tried to do what this says and nothing happened:

[root@www]: ./configure --prefix=/www --enable-module=so -DEAPI
Configuring for Apache, Version 1.3.26
  + using installation path layout: Apache (config.layout)
configure:Error: invalid option '-DEAPI'

How do I solve this problem? Thanx in advance.


Cheers!!!

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0208091911530.31061-100000@lantana.iitm.ernet.in>

Hello All,

   I am trying to setup remote printing in our NW.
   I have successfully set it in the Local Net.

   Now i am trying to setup in One machine, which is
   not in our NW, and it failed to print. Most of the 
   services ( SSH,TelNet..) are disabled ( Security! )
   in that system. But LPD is running :)

   I need to start any services ?
   
   What is the protocol used for transferring files during 
   Remote Printing ?

Thanks,

Try this

./configure --prefix=/www --enable-module=all
--enable-shared=max -DEAPI

Then build and install after that disable loading all
the unnecessary, I mean which you don't want.

It should help you get there.

But this message does not indicate anything realted to
apache 2.0 ???

perhaps youfor got something?

Emacs has features that will satisfy most unix programmers' needs.  It
is primarily a programmer's editor and a lot of the early features
were geared towards this end.  Apart from the mundane, like editing
the program source code, you can compile programs from within Emacs,
look at the error output and jump directly to the error-bearing line
of code, and once the build is successul, you can use Emacs with gdb
to get a visual debugging session.

In sum, Emacs can be a wonderful IDE.

All this is possible because Emacs is an extensible editor - meaning
one can add any amount of functionality to Emacs and also change the
default behaviour completely as one wishes.  [ Note: this differs
subtly but powerfully from the sense "one can add any amount of
functionality of Linux by modifying the source code" ]

People have, over the years, put this extensibility to various use and
now you have a variety of things you can do with Emacs - browse the
web, read Email, Usenet news, etc. etc.

Ok, well. that should give you enough food for thought now... just let
me know when you need more :)

All's well that ends.

Subject: [Ilugc] Partitioning
Message-ID: <200208092058.34055.natarajan_k@hotpop.com>

HI,
	I tried changing an existing dos partition into a ext2 one using mkfs.ext2 
and mk2efs. 
 # mkfs.ext2 /dev/hda7
But the partition type is still FAT 32 when I use fdisk(in Linux). I am not 
able to mount it as a FAT partition though. If I delete the partition then my 
partition numbers get changed i.e. 
If I am delete /dev/hda7 -- FAT 32 (mentioned above)
then the following happens
/dev/hda8 -----> /dev/hda9 (Linux swap)
/dev/hda9 -----> /dev/hda8 (ext2)

The /dev/hda9 partition houses LInux. If the partition number changes then I 
may need to run LILO again. But is there no other way out to convert the 
existing FAT partition to an ext2 partition.

You do this and it does not return an error?

Right. That's because you have a mess, not a working partition/filesystem 
combination. You need to change the partition type in fdisk, using the "t" 
command.

Only after you have changed the partition type to "Linux" (0x83) should you 
try to create a filesystem using mke2fs or mkfs.ext2 .

I don't understand this part. If the swap partition became hda7, I would 
have a *guess* about what is going on (basically, that logical partitions 
need to be numbered in order, so deleting one causes the others to move up 
... I haven't actually seen this behavior, but I doubt I've ever actually 
tried anything that would cause it). But I can't think of a reason why the 
deletion would cause two other partitions to *exchange* their listings in 
the partition table.

>If the partition number changes then I
>may need to run LILO again. But is there no other way out to convert the

There is, and I described it above. Recaping, you need to do it in two steps:

         1. Use fdisk to change the partition type to Linux (0x83).
         2. Use mke2fs to create an ext2 filesystem in the partition.

Hi Imthiaz,
 
Check the mode ur using to transfer the file.
change to Binary and give it a shot....
1) $ftp->type('A'); #Change to ASCII mode for Data Transfer

2) $ftp->type('I'); #Change to Binary mode for Data Transfer

perhaps, an analogy might help understand what is going on. think of your
hard disk as a book; the partition table is like the table of contents of
the book (only contains information about what is where and such stuff)  
and the file system describes the format in which the the information in
each chapter itself is organized. of course, your data itself is like the
actual text matter of the book. using fdisk (or disk druid or some other
such tool) will manipulate the partition table and not touch the file
system that actually resides on the disk. using mkfs or dos/win 'format'
command creates the file system (the way in which the actual data itself
is organized) and will not touch the table of contents er. i mean,
partition table.

as for whether change of partition numbers needs lilo to be run, it
depends. recent linux versions use partition labels to mount partitions -
look in what what /etc/fstab has; if the first column is label=blah, then
you have this later style. if the first column is /dev/blah, then you have
the older style. in the old style, yes, you have to edit fstab
accordingly, but may not need to run lilo unless your / or /boot partition
has changed number. if you have the newer label=blah style, only if /boot
changes (or /, if /boot is not a separate partition but resides within /) 
do you have to run lilo after making the change in lilo.conf. if your 
partitions dont have lebels, you can use e2label command to create (or

World's famous Computer Scientist passed away !!!

The name Dijkstra is most popular among researchers and scholars 
wordlwide. He has contributed several algorithms, concepts and 
terminologies towards the evolution of computer and its science.


Dijkstra enriched the language of computing with many concepts and phrases, such as structured programming, separation of concerns, synchronization, deadly embrace, dining philosophers, weakest precondition, guarded command, the excluded miracle, and the famous "semaphores" for controlling computer processes.

hi,

Sorry for the late announcement but the meeting will not take place
upstairs as it did last time.  It will take place in either the AE8 or
AE6 rooms.  These are classrooms downstairs in the same Aerospace
engineering building.  I should be outside the department at about
3:50 or so.  I'll try and make a few stickers or something.

apologies for cross-posting.  check while replying.

there is a list which works for creating a customized distribution for
schools and help reaching linux to schools with a set of curriculum and
all that stuff.

the mailing list is at school@linux-delhi.org

btw, is there a web page for the linux schools project.??

$ crontab -e 
This will show the user's crontab file using the default editor. You can edit 
it to suit your preferences. For the format refer to man crontab.

> 2.what is major and minor number of a device. How 2 find the major and minor
> number of them? 
The major number is actually the offset into the kernels device driver table, 
which tells the kernel what kind of device it is (whether it is a hard disk 
or a serial terminal). The minor number tells the kernel special 
characteristics of the device to be accessed. For example, the second hard 
disk has a different minor number than the first. The COM1 port has a 
different minor number than the COM2 port.

an ls -l of the device will tell you the major and minor numbers.

Hope that helps.

Hi Friends,

    When I tried to install kdebase-crypto deb package using 
dselect. It got unpacked but fails to configure itself. It says 
"dependency problems prevent configuration of kdebase-crypto. I 
think it is needed to provided SSL support in Konqueror. When I 
tried https://localhost it says "Unsupported Protocol".

When I tried the same URL in mozilla, it says connection refused 
when connecting to localhost. What should I do to get SSL 
configured

Thanx in advance

Check if you have enabled pnp os in your BIOS, if so, disable it and kudzu

Hi all

 I am seing this problem very often

 I use a cross cable to connect my two systems in my house and the
cable 
 end point is a bit loose

 I do an ssh from sys1 to sys2 and alls fine except when the cable gets
disconnected

 After getting disconnected, even if i connect it again, the ssh
session does not recover and after a long time it starts responding
intermittantly !

 i.e if i press enter 2 times, then the first enter will go and then it
will take another 1-2 minutes for the second enter to go - The link
seems to be fine when i use ping - it says it is reachable

 Now in this state even if i kill the ssh connection and try to
reconnect, i am not successful


 So why is that the link is not getting restored properly after a
disconnect ?

Hi,

I have a doubt, that is cron job is user dependent. If so will any 
cron job will get executed if no users are logged in to the 
system. Which is mostly case in servers.

Yes it will,even when no users are logged in.What it all means is that it 
executes with the permission of the user who
has set the cron jobs,and he will be intimated when the job is complete.

Cron wont intimate when _every_ job is run. It will intimate only when a
job outputs something to stdout OR stderr OR when it fails with an error
code.

Subject: [Ilugc] Minutes from ILUGC August 2002 meet
Message-ID: <20020812135838.11207.qmail@web8007.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hello everyone,

            Minutes from ILUGC meet(August 2002)

	As I walked into the rendezvous of the august 2002
ILUGC meet around 4:45PM, Venkatesh had already
started of his presentation on Open SSL and Open CA.He
was explaining public and private keys and later
explained about who exactly is a Certification
Authority(CA). what do the certify? How do they
certify etc. He explained how the public keys of
various certification authorities are by default
installed on major browsers(which is actually a mutual
understanding between CA and the browser developers).
This public key of any CA (eg Verisign) allows a
browser to determine if a particular public key is
valid i.e belongs to the person who claims it to be
his. Open source alternatives to these commercial CA
were also explained egs: - www.openca.org and
www.pyca.de (correct me if I am wrong). He then went
on to explain how a public & private key of a
particular person are certified in Open CA. From what
I understood i guess the public and private keys are
sent to a RA(Registration Authority ?) who/which then
validates the details provided by the person/system.
After the RA is convinced about the validity of the
information provided and then the public key is stored
into the CA repository. By following this method the
person/system is restricted from accessing CA
repository directly. There was also an
argument/discussion about whether this CA repository
is actually accessible though a LDAP server. Prabhu
then pointed out then no one before has talked about
LDAP so it would be nice gave a presentation on LDAP
in the coming meets. There was also a discussion
whether LDAP is a replacement of NIS or is it
something more, How secure is LDAP ? How does one make
LDAP secure? Someone(I am sorry I dont remember the
name) pointed out that Active Directory Service(ADS)
in M$ WINDOWS 2000 was actually an implementation of
LDAP and Kerberos put together although he immediately
pointed out that M$ had made a mess out of it. Prabhu
concluded that people would get to know better about
LDAP only if someone who has actually implemented it
could talk about it.So Venkatesh was requested if he
could talk about LDAP in the coming meets. Suddenly
there was a powercut and the entire meet then
continued in darkness(although i was in darkness for
most of the meet :-) ). There was also a discussion
about how exactly this private and public key
generated, and how tough or impossible to crack these
keys? So Venkatesh went on to explain how the keys are
generated and the algorithm(s) used to generate such
keys. Venkatesh concluded his presentation by citing
few of Open SSL commands(eg:- openssl genrsa 1024
-out).
	Prabhu walked onto the stage and asked various
suggestion and comments about the future ILUGC meets.
He requested people to come forward and volunteer for
various presentation and talks to make the meets more
interesting and exciting. Someone from Lateral
Software(?) suggested that he could give a talk/demo
about the kernel, various kernel modules etc. So it
was decided that the person will give a series of talk
on the kernel and related areas, there will also a
talk on LDAP by Venkatesh in the coming meets.He also
enquired who will write the minutes for this meet as
the Official Minute Man Suraj had not attended the
meet. Although i did not accept to write the minutes
at that time. After listening to Prabhu I felt that i
must volunteer for atleast something, being still a
newbie to GNU/Linux and this being just my 2nd LUG I
could talk on anything,but i could defintely write the
minutes coz it would help understand the concepts i
learnt in the meet and it someway i could contribute
to the community.The meet officially ended at about
7PM and then people slowly fragmented away. The
members will defragment again next month at most
probably at Lateral Software Labs the date of the meet
is yet to be decided.

Dear Mr. Suraj,

Thank you  for your reply.

I am Thushyanthan .K from Sri Lanka and I believe you are Tamil Nadu. I
would like to make animation for TV Programs. (Eg. Animations before Sun TV
News...... ). I tried xawtv and which is used to watch TV programs in PC,
Isn't it?.

Please suggest me a software to do that. (No problem, if Windows OS !)


Thank you,

Regards,

Thushi

Message-ID: <20020812072644.13145.qmail@webmail5.rediffmail.com>

Hi Friends,

   I have some doubt in installing PHP in woody. I had downloaded 
php-4.2.2 tarball. Should I convert it into a deb package and 
install it or just compiling from source would be fine. When I 
compiled it from source, the process went fine. But I don't see 
the php binary in the /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin which is used to 
run php scripts from console.

Thanx in advance!!!

Cheers!!!

Hi all,

I am studying at MIT. Presently MIT website is hosted somewhere in Canada
or U.S. on a Windows machine. We are reorganizing the entire site. We
planned to use PHP for many things. But our host doesn't has it.
We wanna make our site hosted somewhere in India on a Linux or BSD machine
with a good uptime. CGI support is not needed. We need a space of around
250MB. Can anyone suggest me a good hosting company in India?
Thanks all,
Praveen.

If you are compiling from the tar ball, there are two things to observe:

1. Donot use the --with-apxs config option. This will compile it as an
   apache module.
2. do a ./configure; make; make install; This will install php in
   /usr/local/ by default. 

<Nice things to try>
Try with --enable-sockets, --with-ncurses, --with-pcntl

Don't think this is _very_ OT :)

Suggest you ask for PHP and/or perl -- it's cheap, doesn't
add to the price of the package much, and you can do cool
things with it (like run your own slashcode clone! :-))

> We wanna make our site hosted somewhere in India

In India: the better known names (Pugmarks, Net4Domains,
VSNL Co-hosted) cost a lot. For instance, a 100MB pack at
Net4Domains costs as much as 23.5k/year[1]. Pugmarks is
about as expensive [2]. Don't know about academic discounts
(which VSNL gives -- my college ran it's entire site off its
leased line, which VSNL gave at a (at the time) 50% discount,
IIRC).

[1] <http://www.net4domains.com/perl/info/hostInfo.cgi?frm=hostInfo>
[2]
<http://www.pugmarks.net/prdct_details.asp?prdct_code=PM-231&prdct_nm=Shared

Uptime is important, but so's the bandwidth available
to that ISP.

> Can anyone suggest me a good hosting company in India?

It all depends on your budget. Using the comparison shopper
at [3] I found [4].

[3] <http://www.hostpulse.com/app/>
[4]
<http://www.hostpulse.com/app/searchf/default.asp?func=plan&cid=1426&pid=191
9>

I use Net4Domains personally, and while I wouldn't
*recommend* them, they're just about okay.

You can also have a look at WebSytz.com, which despite
the cheesy name performs pretty well (no, I don't get
money from them :)), or any of the sites returned
by hotpulse.com's comparison shopper.

If you have a slightly better budget, rackshack.com
(www.rackshack.com) can't be beat ($99/month for your
own server); or Netmar (www.netmar.com) ($49/month).

Btw, chennailug.org itself runs on a machine which
apparently is a very good deal, right?

Cheers

Hi pRaVeEn,

I suppose MIT has a leased line/ some sort of net connectivity with a
decent bandwidth (at least 2Mbps)?? On that assumption, you can buy a
block of IP addresses for MIT (if it dosent already have it....) from
your ISP (VSNL, Satyam, whatever), and run
your own Web/DNS & Mail servers on your premises. That would be the
easiest option (Scalable, at no extra cost).

The choice for the Web/DNS/Mail Servers? Linux Of course!! Makes life a
lot easier for management of the web services

Hello,

On Linux broadcast / production quality applications Maya from Alias 
Wavefront http://www.aliaswavefront.com/ for 3d; Houdini from SideFx 
http://www.sidefx.com for pre / post production, Film Gimp 
http://filmgimp.sourceforge.net/ for most of what Photoshop can do, and then 
some; Rayz from Silicon Grail (taken over by Apple) http://www.sgrail.com/ 
for compositing; Shake (again formerly owned by Nothing Real taken over by 
Apple) http://www.apple.com/shake/ for film level compositing; then you have 
Discreet Logic http://www.discreet.com/products/ showing off Combustion on 
Linux at NAB in April (product not released yet) - Combustion can take in 
3DSMax output with the depth info for real high speed composites...

Not much to write home about on the editing side, they only usable (user 
friendly) editor I find on Linux is Mainactor Sequencer 
http://www.mainconcept.com 

There are a lot of solutions on Linux depending on how much money you want to 
spend (these usually start at a few thousand USD). Also, there is no /one/ 
software that will do what you have in mind (kind of animations before Sun 
News). 

On the Windows front, this really isn't the forum to discuss it, write to me 
offline if you need more info, but for a quickstart you might want to check 
out 3DSMax 5.0

And we'll thank you not to be sarcastic to Mr Suraj, he might have 
misunderstood your question, just like I might have misunderstood your reply.

yup, interesting one. AFA certificates are concern, it's advisable 
to strict with netscape, since they are original inventors of SSL 
and also has much more facility for searching certificates.. 
blah.....

IE obvious reason but konqueror ?????????????????????

Hi all,

I have RH7.3 installed on a Celeron 366MHz system,with 64MB RAM and 2MB Video RAM.The hard disk partition is as folows:

swap space:188MB

and one partition of 3.5GB.

The system as such is very slow in response.It does not open a Window(i run Gnome) instantly and takes about 1 min to open.Moreover the memory usage shows 88% usage and 55% swap usage ,when i open just a shell and nothing else.

Iam not sure which one is slowing down my system.I have also not installed n/w related goodies in that.

thanks

Giridharan

My friend owns a computer institute.

In the Workstn2 and Workstn4, I have installed
Woody(Debian 3.0). I 've configured the network card
to 192.168.1.1, and I can able to ping the "eth0" in
my local machine.And also added an entry into the
routing table.

But what the problem I've was , I can't able to access
any other machines on the network.Even I'm not able to
ping those systems from this machine and vice-versa.

I hope you can suggest me a solution for this?

As usual M$ is not even acknowledging the seriousness of
the
problem.  It says  it's too soon to judge the severity of
the 
problem -- and even whether the flaw exists.

To top it all, M$ is blaming the guy who found the bug !!!

Message-ID: <1029316981.1341.176.camel@mdpnok104950>

[cross posted to twincling/chennai lug. take care while replying.]

Hi,

I am in the process of migrating from RHL 7.2 to RHL7.3.

I have been using Ximian Evolution as my mail client. Have a lot of
mails and filters in place. 

The Evolution intelligent import is not detecting my old settings.

is there a simple way to migrate the mails at one shot rather than
importing one folder at a time and then the address books, filters,
etc..

have googled but couldnt find much information.

thanks in advance for the pointer / helps.

regards
balaji

Message-ID: <20020814141255.20804.qmail@webmail6.rediffmail.com>

Hi Friends,

I am using woody. I used dselect to install php4(4.0.5-2).But it 
said it depends on apache-common(1.3.19-1) which is already 
installed(I don't know why that happens). Then I used dpkg to 
install php4 like this...

"dpkg --force-depends -i php4_4.0.5-2.deb"

It installed without any problems. I put the php4 package on hold 
.Then I tried to install other packages like php4-mysql,gnome-sudo 
etc.,  But still it complains like this

"You have held broken packages"
"php4: depends on apache-common.Try running apt-get -f install".

When I tried  "apt-get -f install" it says it will remove php4. I 
am literally stuck up.

In such situations what should I do? Please advice.

Thanx in advance

Cheers!!!

	Oh just make a tarball of your old evolution directory and unpack it in
your new home directory and start up evolution and you are done! That is
what I do everytime when I migrate :-)



	The intelligent importer is meant for old stuff of yours lying around
when you switch from some other email client to Evolution for the first
time. For Evolution->Evolution migration, just do the above :-)



	Regards,

    No! Actually the private key should never leave the person's
    machine! It should not be given to anybody ... not even the CA.
    If it is known by anyone else other than the owner, then
    security of the PKI approach is completely compromised.

    However the RA needs to verify that the person sending the
    public key for certification is also the true owner of the
    corresponding private key.  This can be done by various
    means. One simple scheme is challenge-response. The RA generates
    some one-time random data and encrypts it with the applicant's
    public key. It then sends the encrypted data to the applicant.
    If the applicant can successfully decrypt and return the original
    data then it is certain that he also holds the proper private key.

    The RA is the frontend to a CA's operations and deals with
    customers. The CA database may contain potentially vulnerable/
    private data that should not be accessible to all. So only
    the RA is ideally allowed access into the CA repository.

Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution
1st Edition January 1999
1-56592-582-3
280 pages

While this is an old book (not outdated though), it would still prove
a good read for those who wanted to know more about free and open
source software ideals and concepts.
You can read the online book at
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/toc.html

Alternatively, since the publisher has licensed the book under a
licence rather similar to GNU Free Documentation Licence, we have
extracted the text, chopped off all the *unnecessary* stuff (er,
O'Reilly marketing stuff essentially) and output to a PDF file
(536KB). For your offline reading pleasure, you can download the PDF
file here:

Happy reading and hacking*.

*hacking - the local media and other publicity chaps have recently
abused the term "hacker" (the DBS internet-banking cracking case). The
actual term that they should use is "cracker". Hackers are those who
like to fiddle with computer systems and source code while crackers
are typically evil guys who break into networks (without permission of
course) and perform all sorts of malicious acts like bringing down
your boxes or deleting away all your valuable files.

Subject: [Ilugc] ext2 strange behaviour
Message-ID: <20020816071505.GA9317@chennailug.org>

hi,

A box which has been up for 140 days runs on a single 20GB '/' ext2
partition (as was provided by our colocater) . For long this box has
been untouched but was once used for 'heavy-duty' disk activities in the
past.  when I logged in recently I realised that I'm unable to write to
the disk (even as root).


 # touch test.file
 touch: creating `test': Read-only file system

 # pwd
 /
 
 # mount
 /dev/hda3 on / type ext2 (rw,errors=remount-ro,errors=remount-ro)
 proc on /proc type proc (rw)
 devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)

 # cat /etc/debian_version
 3.0

It is worth noting the following:

  * During those 'heavy-duty' days, the system load reached upto 7.00
    and such. 
    
  * The filesystem has about 100 million small files on it.  there is
    one such directory with _lot_ of files:

    # time ls | head
    ^C

    real    12m8.965s
    user    0m2.020s
    sys     12m1.850s
    #

    Notice that the file list hasn't been done yet because there are
    _so_many_ files on it and all the files are under one single parent
    and I think thats the same reason why the kernel takes _all_ the
    time trying to read through its nodes.
    
  * This box is not physically available. It is a remote colocated box
    (and hence any solution, that you think of would be appreciated if it
    can be applied to a remote machine)

Can physical damages to disks cause such problems?

if in case a fsck has to be run, will it be possible to create a cramfs
with ssh enabled and allow a remote login to the system and fsck this
partition? Are there any ready-made tools/packages available for the
same?

  Thanks in advance,

    -Suraj

List Admin -> Is it really required to send the password in the

Is it possible to mount onto other system..?and then ssh into that..?Best 
thing is to convert into ext3..
this will be best solution and does not take time...

Yes, you do need to send the password along.  If you do not send out
the password you cannot unsubscribe.  To check this I actually tested
it with a dummy account.  This seems the default behaviour and is a
little painful. :(

hey all ,

My name is Aditya , and i am doing my 3rd. year cse at Sri Venkateswara College Of Engineering..I am also the additional secretary of the IEEE student chapter in the college.

WE are planning to conduct a 3 day national level tech. conference in the 2nd. week of feb. Apart from the invited and student papers , we plan to include tutorials and workshops for the participants of the conference .

It would be wonderful if  some of you experts could come over and conduct a tutorial or workshop at the college premises as a part of the conference. while we are still cloudy with regards to the topics on which the workshop could be conducted , something like python will be great for the students. we promise you a very big,bright bunch of young people as an appreciative audience.

Also we are loking forward to your suggestions regarding other tutes that can be conducted. Stuff like encyption , graph theory and applications will also be great.

thanks in advance,

regards

aditya krishnan

Message-ID: <3D5E08BE.6030903@qpackets.com>

hi,

       can anybody tell what does this error mean.

1.         when i load songs into XMMS player, it doesn't play but give 
this error.
           " arts_init error: can't connect to aRts soundserver  "


       i am not able to play songs either with "GTV" or KDE MEDIA PLAYER 
as well.

2.     when i load songs into GTV, it gives the following error.

           "gtv: No available audio device
           Fatal signal: Segmentation Fault (SDL Parachute Deployed) "

3.       In case of KDE MEDIA PLAYER or NOATUN,
           i am not able to launch the player itself and it gives the 
following error....

           Xlib:  extension "RENDER" missing on display ":0.0".
           Launched ok, pid = 26492
           KCrash: crashing.... crashRecursionCounter = 2
           KCrash: Application Name = noatun path = <unknown>
           Xlib:  extension "RENDER" missing on display ":0.0".

           [2]+  Exit 253                noatun


           Is there a common problem, since not even one player is able 
to play any song.


           thanks in advance,
 
       elan

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020817133656.00b16df0@pop.mail.yahoo.co.uk>

Hi,

I had Mandrake 8.2 running in my system till out of curiosity, I upgraded 
to kde 3.02 from kde 2.x.  The X server is now never stable.  It works fine 
till I don't open a "konsole" window and minimize it.  If I minimize the 
console window, I don't see it in the taskbar (unable to trace where it 
goes).   When I refresh the desktop the whole of taskbar vanishes and a 
grey strip replaces the taskbar.

Under this condition, when I switch over to some other terminal 
(ctrl+alt+f2...f6), the X-server crashes.  Last few lines of 
/var/log/XFree86 is not helpful.  Of late, I discovered that after the 
disappearance of taskbar, if I kill the previously opened konsole (using 
run command), the X returns to normal till I don't open another konsole for 
nth time (n is odd).  Every time I open a konsole the nth time (where n is 
odd), I get this problem.

After I kill the konsole, I get a message quotting "KDE Init could not 
launch konsole-noxft".

Where could be the problem?

Advance thanks,

/

Hi,

there should be stuff in /var/log/exim/ that should make sense. read the
logs and if you still don't understand or figure out whats going on (exim
documents all the error msgs it spews out very nicely -- see the FAQ or the
man page or whatever) post an URL to the log files themselves, and someone
can help you out.

there could be a gazillion problems that can be diagnosed at this stage.
post more descriptive error msgs, for better help.

best,

	--r.

Please also post how you connect to the internet.  Do you use a cable
modem?  Do you have a static IP address?  Have you registered a domain
name? etc.

Sending mails from your home machine to the outisde world is a whole
different ball game from receiving mails directly from "the outside
world" to your home machine.

well, there has to be some authentication mechanism so that x does not
unsubscribe y. with passwords, this can be accomplished in a single mail
that includes the password (assuming you have the password handy). without
the password concept, first you have to send the unsubscribe request, then
confirm by replying to the confirmation request (for a total of two
mails). if you dont have the password handy, then it takes two mails, one
to get hold of the password and the second to send the unsubscribe request
(with the password) for a total of two mails. thus, i would conclude that
this is acceptable. only, i dont know how to get the password by mail;
perhaps, this can be included in the footer of the posts.

  There are two options:

    1. You can make a partition act as your swap device
    2. You can make a file act as your swap device

    If '1' is possible you can do the following:

      # mkswap /dev/hdXYY 
      (where hdXYY is the partition which you would like to have
      as your swap device)
    else if you want to have a file as your swap device:

      # dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap.file bs=1024 count=<size in kb>

      Where 'size in kb' is the desired size of your swap file.

      # mkswap /swap.file
      
    Now your swap file/partition is ready. Edit your fstab and add an
    entry to mount the swap file/partition mount during boot:

    Depending on whether you wanted a swap partition or a swap file:
    
    1. For swap partitions:
    /dev/hdXYY	none	swap	sw	0	0

    2. For swap file:
    /swap.file	none	swap	sw	0	0

    The SwapSpace-HOWTO (mini HOWTO) is a nice read if you wanted to
    know nifty things about swaps.

  HTH,

Hi Everybody,

   Anybody interested in getting T-shirts with Tux/Linux logos 
etc., printed on them. Suggestions are also welcome on what type 
of logos can be printed on T-shirts. Actually, I know somebody who 
does this in a professional way. If there is good response from 
the LUG members, we could go in for a bulk-order.

This issue was of interest sometime back when Suraj made a mention 
about this on the mailing list.

Someone really interested can contact me .

Cheers!!!
Somu

Should we feature Tux at all? For long I've been feeling bad to wear
'Tux' Tees and 'Linux' tees without even a mention of 'GNU'. )-:

I would rather be very much willing to order 3 or 5 copies of a t-shirt
bearing this:

http://gnuart.onshore.com/images/uncle_gnu/gsam_want_gnu_big.jpg

If this image is posterised 3 levels i think it would become affordable
for print and yet look pleasing on the eyes.

vs> This issue was of interest sometime back when Suraj made a mention 
vs> about this on the mailing list.

I think I wouldn't have the time to sit through a purchase/print session
however I can offer these designs for free (free as in
{freedom,free-beer}):

1. http://symonds.net/~suraj/pictures/debian1-f.jpg
2a. http://symonds.net/~suraj/pictures/rtfm1-f.jpg
2b. http://symonds.net/~suraj/pictures/rtfm1-r.jpg
3. http://symonds.net/~suraj/pictures/unix_god-f.jpg

(other OT designs: http://symonds.net/~suraj/tshirts.php)

The XCFs aren't available online for the time being. Will put them up
and notify whoever is interested in further development of these
ideas/designs.

Tip: Please note that the cost of printing is directly proportional to
the size of the image and the no. of colours used. Also it is advised to
develop these images at _atleast_ 300dpi for better print resolution.

Hi Suraj,

  Thanks for your designs.Seems like we are getting more 
responses. Why don't you set up a voting system for the designs. 
So that we could go in for the design with maximum no:of votes. 
Because it will not be cost effective if we go in for one design 
for say 20 shirts and another design for the next 30 shirts or 
so.

Cheers!!!

  Increasing the SWAP more then 512 won't give
  much increment in Speed. So you can try with 
  512MB. And there is no necessary that SWAP 
  must be 2 times of RAM.

sure. will do soon. But if the prices are fixed before the votes get
setup. I hope you aren't fixing a "large" margin for this and I wish
the tees come out affordable.

<Details>

 Actually I set up CVSROOT 

$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.something.net:/cvsroot/myproject

the login as:
$ cvs login
pass
here I get unkonwn host error



I tried the same on a machine connected directly to the net and I was able

Hi Imthiaz,
I think it is the problem with your table type.
As of my knowledge ,MyISAM won't support referential integerity.
To have foreign key support you should have innodb or bdb table type support.
If you have innodb or bdb support it is just the matter of altering your table by issuing the following query
mysql> alter table tablename type='innodb'

Hi

CVS access is done thru a shell which is  $CVS_RSH which connects to a 
remote server in  a specific port.
where as ur proxy  listens for HTTP connections (80,8080,3128 
....etc),what u can do is
Run a proxy for the program used by CVS or do a NATing(Network Address 
Translation or Masquerading )
in the gateway.


Happy Hacking

(i am not a regular user of cvs, so i may be a bit off). cvs uses its own 
port; /etc/services shows cvspserver at port 2401. i am not aware of any 
cvs proxy server. in which case, you will have to do some nat/masquerading 
on port 2401 to cvs through a firewall.

Hi,

    A little bit of googling turned up a patch someone has written to
allow cvs connections to be tunneled through a http proxy -

http://list-archive.xemacs.org/xemacs-nt/199901/msg00006.html

It is also present on the cvs website though not yet incorporated in
the mainline.

But only if the CVS server runs on https port,this will work.Most of the 
open source cvs
never runs on this ...It runs on 2401..

even if it gets removed I think the image looks good because of all its
colours and shades and what not. If such a high res image needs to be
printed it would mean more bucks to shell. Rather simpler single/two
colour images would do fine. something like the ones at GT-CDROM, but with
a more meaningful message.

Not necessarily. If the proxy does Not restrict CONNECT messages to
only well-known ports then it is possible to connect to cvs pserver
running on default port via a proxy CONNECT message.

Though there's nothing very Tux-ish about it, 
this would be great! all crypto-anarchist perl
geeks in here, please say aye! :-)

other one by Bharathi a design with M K Gandhi. From my side I need 2( L and
XL) with either of these designs. I am also open to any other design too.
Pls let me know where are we heading with this?
Thanks
Sri

First off, we should have a way of collecting designs. I donot have the
time to read through the archives and collect URLs. More than that the
person submitting the design should make sure that the designs aren't
copyrighted under some non-free license. The one submitted by me on gnuart
is free (free as in free{dom,beer}.
If someone can send a list of links that have been posted here so far
(after verifying that they are free) and preferably/optionally
optimise/posterise the images at 300DPI or more, I would be glad to set up
a vote on chennailug.org. IMO, it is useless to collect votes on designs
that cannot be printed.

Subject: [slugnet] [Unix Review] Generating presentations in PDF format

Article from Unix Review
(http://www.unixreview.com/documents/s=7459/uni1029856352811/) that
gives an introduction (using Python and the ReportLab PDF library) on
how to generate a PDF document via a script.

Regular Expressions: Yes You Can
August 2002

by Cameron Laird and Kathryn Soraiz

Need to do a presentation? Your first thought may be to load up a
portable Windows computer with a PowerPoint sequence. There are better
ways, however, particularly if you come from a Unix background.

Better than PowerPoint

A focus on Unix for presentations isn't just a "fashion" preference.
You can prepare presentations with public formats, automate their
generation, maintain sources under version control, and practice all
the other elements of wise computing that are probably commonplace in
your daily work. In principle, all these are also possible with
PowerPoint-on-Windows technology, but at the cost of stiff licensing
fees, opaque storage, and inflexibility. Before you start your next
presentation, learn:

# the advantages of public formats
# that you, too, can write PDF
# and that presentations are a "killer app" for handheld computers

[...]

How do you search for a particular "String" inside the contents of a
directory
the string is inside the content of the file and not on the name 

How do you search for a functions implementation in a set of .so files

I think I can use ldd to see if there is some missing declarations

Abilash,

When starting a new topic please do not use the reply button on an
unrelated post on the list.

If you do that (as you have indeed done) your message will become part
of a totally unrelated "thread".  This can work to your disadvantage
because many people just skip entire threads they are not interested
in.  So it is only you who stand to lose if that happens.

In future start a new message with a relevant subject line that

decide if they want to spend more time reading your entire mail.  All
this is part of what is generally regarded as basic net etiquette.

Dear Friends,

Here is the latest update on Mandreke tamil localisation.
http://www.mandrakelinux.com/l10n/ta.php3

here are some screenshots ....

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamilinix/files/misc/screenshots/Mandrake/Screenshot-2.png
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamilinix/files/misc/screenshots/Mandrake/Screenshot-4.png

Almost the enitre user interface has been localised to tamil. So next
time you install Mandrake9.0, we'll see tamil in it's full glory. OK.
there may be some spelling mistakes and pls. help solve this by
following this instructions...

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamilinix/message/1222

Thanks to Srivas, We'll also get a tamil font which provides out of
the box support. But i sincerely request more font authors to send an
e-mail auhtorising for using their fonts. I fully understand the
amount of efforts put in by the font authors in developing their
tools.  I take this opportunity to thank everyone of you
individually, and you've made our language "Tamil" richer by
uncomprabale ways.
I would like to  assure you  again that Mandrake is not a company
that takes away your hardwark.100% of their work is licensed in GPL
and is given back to the public domain. They're only one of the few
companies with translations over 40 languages and they're actively
supported by their users. I can assurre you that at a later stage
you'll definitely feel proud for getting your fonts being officially
included in the Mandrake distribution.

Thanks for reading this, and we have got until agust 31st to include
the fonts in Mandrake9.0.
 I sincerely request font authors to give permission to atleasst one
font from their fontpacks.

I take this opportunity to thank Dr.srivas again  for his magnanimous
gesture of support to tamil.

Regards.,
Prabu

Subject: [Ilugc] gtk configuration problem
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020824093204.00b15c78@pop.mail.yahoo.co.uk>

Hi,

I am toiling myself hard to get gtk work with Mandrake 8.2

First gtk(2.0.0) required pango(1.0.0), atk(1.0.0), pkg-config(0.12.0) and 
glib(2.0.0).  I downloaded and installed all the packages in the following way:
#./configure	- in the respective director
#make install
#make check
#make

A simple program of the sort
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

int main()
{
return 1;
}
gives me compilation error that gtk/gtk.h is not found.  Using find 
command, I found that it is located at /usr/local/include.  This directory 
contains a file gtk.h (which I require) and a directory by the name 
gtk.  The file gtk has many files as "included files" that are present in 
/usr/local/include/gtk.

I tried including the full path of the file in the program.  Also, ran 
ldconfig before compiling the program.  gtk.h is also found in 
/home/vignesh/gtk-+2.0.0.  I repeated the above possible solutions.  But to 
vain.

A book guides to compile the program as
gcc example.c 'gtk-config -cflags' 'gtk-config -line'.  I have also tried 
using -I option with gcc.  No gains.

But I could not find gtk-config command in my system.

How do I compile this program?  Where should I make an entry so as to 
search the include files in the new directory?  I could be wrong in any of 
the above mentioned procedures or unaware of certain procedures.

Kindly enlighten me,

Advance thanks,
Vignesh.

hi all ,

   I m just hunting out on file system encryption for linux . And in the
process checked out that most of these weren't supporting 2.4 kernel. 
Only 2/3 supports 2.4 . 

Encryption tool which supports 2.4 :
   * loopiv / loop-jari
   * PPDD
   * Stegfs(alpha stage)
   * BestCrypt

And i finally settled with PPDD . I just want to ensure that i wasn't
missing anyting out there .

NOTE : We r gonna use this 4 commercial purpose , so BestCrypt is ruled
out .

bye

Check out http://lists.vipul.net/mailman/listinfo/cpunks-india

Hey, I see that cfs is now allowed for export or even distribution to
anybody but 'permanent residents' of US and Canada ? So, how did you find
it 'use'ful ?!!!
What black magic did you use to try it ? or did you 'make them an offer
they couldn't refuse' ?

Hi vMoksha type person :)

First off, I used it about 2 years back, hacking up some shell scripts to
integrate into an user's /home directory, transparently. I neither am, nor
was, a Permanent Resident, of USA or Canada, and will not be, for the
foreseeable future, thanks to the insane laws out here. When I last used it,
it was packaged inside Debian, though I had to rip the deb apart and
re-package it to my taste, and AFAIK, Debian/GPL allow it, and it was only
for personal use. :/

I'm not sure what else you imply with your question(s).

Oh, is vMoksha your company? As in, your initials ... 

best,

Well... I was reading the cfs page at research.att.com [1] and the
distribution requirement says that they don't have the source on anon ftp,
due to US export laws etc etc...

and the questions.... well..so i wonder how u persuaded them !!

Pre-installed debian GNU/Linux .... Yes 

Recently we ordered 5 PCs from M/s HCL Infosystems
through DGS&D,Govt of India Rate contract. We didn't
order any OS or  other softwares as we use GNU/Linux.
To our surprise we received the box with preinstalled
Debian Linux. It seems HCL has a policy of not sending
out any machine without OS. Hence, if no os ordered
then Debian is loaded. Well at last GNU/Linux is the
default operating system.

Try Collaborative Virtual Workspace. 
It is a nice extensible chat server and client
software; has  very primitive audio and video
conferencing as well. The server works well on
Solaris and GNU/Linux platforms. Java Clients are
available.
The chat server runs on the good-old LambdaMoo server.

CVW is a collaboration software environment that
provides a "virtual building" where teams can
communicate, collaborate, and share information,
regardless of their geographic location. CVW takes
virtual meetings one step further and enables virtual
co-location through persistent virtual rooms, each
incorporating people, information, and tools
appropriate to a task, operation, or service. To learn
more about CVW, see the Collaborative Virtual
Workspace Overview.

The reviews I've seen indicate that the Linux 3d accelerated
performance is almost as good as the raw Windows performance.  I dont
remember the website either (maybe it was anandtech?).  Anyway, I've
used the tnt2 card and it is definitely fast under Linux.  Quake3
playes nicely.

It might be that you have not installed the nvidia drivers properly.
The nvidia packages come with lots of useful docs.  Read them and you
should be able to sort your problems out.  You might also want to
upgrade to a more recent RH version.  It might help, I dont know.

As regards ati I'm not sure if ati provides its own drivers so you
might need to use the standard XFree86 drivers.  Again upgrading to
Xfree86 4.2 (from a recent distro) should help.

Google is your friend.

http://www.google.com/search?q=linux+games

http://www.linuxgames.com/

Also take a look at transgaming (http://www.transgaming.com).  WineX
supports a ton of Windows games via WineX.  You also get acceleration
etc.

Hello,

Thanks for that link! The http://acharya.iitm.ac.in has some 
spectacular stuff, but the linux version of the editor is not yet 
available... concordance be blessed, though :) 

Am unable to find any contact info on that site. Will IIT-M be willing to 
license source under any OSS license (GPL, BSD etc), and / or including 
commercial terms... Does anybody know whom I can get in touch with for these?

regards
BGa

Subject: [Ilugc] gtk configuration problem
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020825155040.00b42b58@pop.mail.yahoo.co.uk>

Hi,

I am afraid, my previous mail did not reach you.  Hence, I am resending it.

The problem is whenever I try to compile a program of the sort

#include <gtk/gtk.h>

int main()
{
return 1;
}

it says that it could not find the file gtk/gtk.h.

- I have installed gtk2.0.0 with all necessary dependencies
- Including -I option with gcc does not work
- I have run #ldconfig
- I have searched the archives and google too, but all leads to no solution.
- I downloaded gtk+2.0.0 from www.gtk.org

Kindly help me

Advance Thanks,
Vignesh

use 
  #include <gtk.h> 
since gtk.h is found under the include directory and not 
under gtk sub-directory.

as a precaution check whether the files included by gtk.h
are included as #include <gtk/file.h>.  
if not edit the gtk.h file to prefix the filename with
gtk/ in the include preprocessor directive.

using bash

servers=`grep "<\!ENTITY servers" filename | cut -f2 -d\"`

where ` is the inverted quote found on the top left corner
of 
the keyboard below the escape key, will assign the value to

the variable servers.  u can later use ${servers} to refer
to this value.

This assumes that the dataline you are looking for has a 
<!ENTITY servers string in it and that the value follows
the first double quote and ends before the second double
quote.

In case there are more than one <!ENTITY servers datalines
then the variable ${servers} will be a list of values which
can be processed using a for construct.

Lookup info or man for grep, cut and bash for further information.

hi

the following snippet will fetch any number within quotes
  inside the shell script u give

 NUMBER=` sed -n 's/<!entity servers"\([0-9]\+\)">/\1/gp'  `


 $NUMBER has the number that was within quotes

** Note:: the single quote next to '=' is backquote i.e the one thats 
above TAB key**

Happy hacking!

	I am assuming that you did ./configure without specifying a prefix -
that means that it used /usr/local for the prefix.

	This was for Gtk 1.2. Gtk 2.0 onwards the Pkg Config system is used so
you need to do :


	pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0 


	to get the include lines and C flags needed to build a program and 


	pkg-config --libs gtk+-2.0


	to get the list of libraries to link against :-)



	So your command line would look like :


	gcc `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0` example.c



	HTH,


		Ravi

	No, that is incorrect - please see my post explaining how it works in
the post Gtk-2.0 setup.

	Oh no, no, never do that. If you find yourself having to do that,
something is very broken ;-)

Date: 23 Aug 2002 20:52:45 -0400

Hello,

    Mono 0.15 has been released.

    Mono is an open source implementation of ECMA CLI virtual machine,
and the ECMA C# standard, and includes many classes found on the .NET
Framework as well.  

    The C# compiler is fully functional (we use it to bootstrap this
release for instance, roughly half a million lines of C# code). 

    We skipped version 0.14, that was only an internal release.

* Administrivia:

    As usual, two packages were released.  You only need the first to
    develop applications though:

	http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.15.tar.gz
		Runtime engine source code.
		Binaries for the compiler and class libraries.

	http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.15.tar.gz
		Source code for the compiler and the class libraries.

		Instructions for recompiling the compiler and the
	 	class libraries is included in mcs-0.13/INSTALL,
		thanks to Alp for authoring this doc.

    RPMS are available for Red Hat 7.3:

	http://www.go-mono.com/archive/libgc-6.1alpha5-1.i386.rpm
	http://www.go-mono.com/archive/libgc-devel-6.1alpha5-1.i386.rpm  
	http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.15-1.i386.rpm  
	http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-devel-0.15-1.i386.rpm  

    Debian packages are available too (Robert McQueen)
	<robot101@debian.org>.

	http://www.debianplanet.org/mono/

    sources.list for Woody:
	deb http://www.debianplanet.org/mono stable release 
	deb-src http://www.debianplanet.org/mono stable release 

    sources.list lines for sid are: 
	deb http://www.debianplanet.org/mono unstable release 
	deb-src http://www.debianplanet.org/mono unstable release 


		
* Stats:

	1049 commits since July 27th (0.13 release date)

* News

    There are so many news in the past month, that it is very hard to
    summarize it.  Basically: better, faster, more complete Mono.  I
    have included my attempt at a summary:

	* C# Compiler, from Martin Baulig:
	     Definite assignment support.
	     50% faster compilation times.
	     Almost all bugs against the compiler closed.

	* Tim Coleman and Web Services:
	     Tim has started to add support for Web Services.

	* Runtime:
	     Dietmar has been working on our remoting support as well
	     as Interop code.  Structure marshalling got complete
	     now. 

	* Internationalization:
	     Rhys Weatherley author of Portable.NET has contributed
	     his very complete internationalization code to the Mono
	     class libraries.  

	* ASP.NET:
	     Many contributions from Patrik Torstensson to the
	     HttpRuntime.  Gonzalo started to move the XSP page
	     processor into the System.Web assembly.  

	     Once Patrik commits the rest of the new code, it will
	     be possible to use the regular Web servers people write
	     as well as writing an Apache module.

	     Gaurav is back, and has been fixing and improving some of the
	     existing Webform widgets. 

	* Sparc and PowerPC.
	     Mark Crichton updated the SPARC code for Mono, Radek
	     updated the PowerPC port as well.

	* ADO.NET
	     Rodrigo and Dan have maintained thing: the OleDB classes
	     are starting to show signs of life with the LibGDA backend

	* Windows.Forms:
	     Work is progressing on the WineLib-based implementation
	     of the Windows.Forms.  The only way of making sure we
	     can run all Windows.Forms apps on Linux.

	* Resources
	     Dick checked in resource readers and writers.

	* Tons of bug fixes.
	     Everywhere, really.

    This time I had to put together packages, rpms, and release notes
myself, I apologize if I missed an important chunk of work, it is
really hard to read over a thousand commits and try to synthesize.

Enjoy!
Miguel.

Hi,

Have recently moved from RHL7.2 to RHL7.3. Since then having this
strange problem.

Suddenly two lines (the thickness varies) appear little below the mouse
pointer when i move over menu's. The system / mouse is working fine but
that lines are very irritating. 

The problem appears both in KDE  /Gnome. Tried reconfiguring X in
vain.This problem was not there when i used to run RHL7.2

Version of X is XFree86-4.2.0-8. 

Dont know what to do. Pointer Please. Let me know if more info is
required. 

Thanks in advance.

Regards
Balaji

Now the export regulation have been relaxed..It was relaxed i guess 
somwhere around end of 2001.
In fact you can go higher than 192 bit encryption support.Write  to the 
maintainer he will be able to
provide you with the source.

Export law still is binding on what USA calls as "Rogue states"

Hi Abhi,

       thanks for ur reply.
       Now tell me ..
       changing this permissions to a directory especially a system 
directory
       like "mcop-root" in the" /tmp " directory is a sin??
       While playing with the file permissions, i changed that(don't 
exaclty remember the
       default permissions )... and now
       the mp3 player xmms gives an "error mcop_root has no user 
permission ".

       How significant is this permission for the mp3 player to play.
       How to go back to the normal default file permissions?

       thank u.. once more for ur patience.

You will need a JDK 1.3.1+.
Download the jboss-tomcat bundle from
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jboss/jboss-3.0.0_tomcat-4.0.3.zip?download
and uncompress it into your filesystem.

Check out the JBossQuick Start guide at
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jboss/JBoss.3.0QuickStart.Draft4.pdf?download
 to get more info on JBoss.

HTH,
Binil

There is a while construct for the shell.

read is bash built in function which can read a line from stdin.
but it only takes space delimited data

#!/bin/sh

while read var1 var2
do
    echo $var1 $var2
done

This might help you reach EOF as an example, I would rather prefer you 
to write a small perl script

May be the X server config file has been modified in such a way that X 
server cannot start.

try to find the XFree86.?.log log file and locate the problem, then fix 
it, and for that time being disable
this line by prefix with # like this

# x:5:respawn:/etc/X11/prefdm -nodaemon


to do a test cycle

1. check the log file
    identify the problem, or send the portion to this news group at 
least some one can guide you.
2. modify or remove unnecessary options
3. try startx
4. if that all goes well, then re-enable that line which starts X

Using the 'alien' utility.

This is quite useful, to convert rpms to tgz and
vice-versa.  The sad thing though, as far as I know,
is that it doesn't come as part of the standard linux
installation (I am running Red Hat 7.1).  The alien rpm
should be available on the internet (www.rpmfind.net).

BTW, It'd be good to know if there's some other way
aswell:-)

Kanagesh.

Hi,

Some files in one of our Linux 7.1 machines suddenly grew to over 6GB in
size. Most of these files are part of the fileutils package (ls, chmod,
chown etc.). The binaries of these files became huge, ranging from 2 GB to
7 GB in size!!

How and why does this happen? Is it because of a sofware bug, or due some
malicious program?

TIA,
Srivathsan

Hi everyone,

I wish to know the effects of dialing to the internet (ppp) as root.  Is it a security loophole ? If so in what way ?

I guess the dialer (like wvdial or minicom) just starts pppd, which always runs as root.  So does the uid of the dialer make any issue ?

Can anyone clear my doubt pls ?
thanx

There are actually two sub problems:

#1 Choose a mail client that has both Windows and Linux ports

   The best bets would be browsers like Netscape or Mozilla.  These
   are available under both OSes.
   
   I myself use GNU Emacs and Gnus to read my mail under both OSes.


#2 Find a way to share your mail folders between the two OSes.

   You create a FAT32 partition on your hard drive.  This is a (only?)
   type of partition that both linux and Windows can read & write.

   I have a 2 gig FAT32 partition that I use to store my mail folders
   and other stuff that I just got to have under both environments.
   Works quite nicely.

Dear  Mr Sambaiah

get a copy of Solaris /  Intel...

>   Any of you know good hosting service provided in US.

>   reasonable charge.

Well,  there are  any number of hosting providers in US.
It would depend  on your  budget. From your requirements, i believe you
want Shared hosting services. If you are looking for some stable
(financially) provider, have a look at Yahoo !! Yes, yahoo does provide
hosting services...

http://servers.yahoo.com -- dedicated server hosting (  about $100  per
month  starting)
http://geocities.yahoo.com --   11.95  or  19.95 $  per month for  shared
50MB and more, domain name etc.

Have  a look at this comparison chart
http://geocities.yahoo.com/ps/learn/CompChart_PlusProWebmAdv.html

NOTE: If you need email for all your users,  do  look for providers who can
provider  a 'POP forwarding account for your domain",  then  you could use
fetchmail to pickup and  distribute to local users. Generally they would
add a header such as 'X-Delivered-To' on each mail to identify the
recipient. Talk to your provider if he would provide such an account.

Other  providers would be www.pair.net, who have a lot of experience and
seem to  be pretty knowledgeable.
Have a look at http://www.pair.com/pair/shared/ for a pretty detailed
pricing and spec list.

Hope that helps

Dear  Mr Sambaiah

..

>Well,  there are  any number of hosting providers in US.
>It would depend  on your  budget. From your requirements, i believe you

BTW: I forgot to ask this. Hosting out of the US requires $$ payments. In
the past I have found many India basaed websites have moved from US hosting
to Hosting out of India as they were  not able to manage the monthly  $$
payments because of the Foreign Exchange Laws. However, this was for people
paying > $100 per month and probably may not apply to you.

But you must take this into account. You should have a reliable method of
payment -- mostly International Credit Card, which would be available for
the full period of hosting. As the providers are very prompt  with service
disconnection  for non-payments. (infact, they may have automated this)
So, using someones' personal credit card may not be a good idea... Hope you
have sorted out these issues...

I have had many false starts with using Emacs, but have  never gotten to
using it regularly.
In an office environment, where i get various attachments in proprietary
formats, how do i use emacs for my mailing requirements ? Does GNU
Emacs/Windows allow me to launch external Windows programs for these
requirements ?

Any hints on starting out on this route would be wonderful...

it might be argued that switching to imap instead of pop would be a more 
elegant solution. the above solution provides the sharing on the client 
side. switching to imap on the server shifts the sharing to the server 
side. then, any imap mail client can be used. mail folders can be readily 
shared, but addresbooks takes some work (and may not be possible depending 
on the mail client...).

First off, Emacs has more than one mail client, and they might behave
differently.  So, let me just talk about Gnus - the one I use.  Gnus
uses mailcap database to view mime attachments.  So, if you have
cygwin installed you should be all set.  Otherwise you might have to
settle for something less interesting - like saving the attach to
disk.

I also seem to forget the name of another colocation service provider
which Asokan (pasokan@os4.com) had obtained for $50 a month. a celeron
700Mhz, 256M RAM, 27G WDC Drive was provided with base install of Debian
potato + sshd. Nice thing is that the box is like _yours_ and you always
can enable/disable whatever you wanted to do with it. (-:

Hello Suraj,

  What happened to the voting system? This can be done only with 
your assistance. Once you set it up, I can take care of 
maintaining a database about people who would like to order 
T-shirts with the designs posted on the chennailug site. Together 
we can get this thing done.

Cheers!!!

ohe, gimme the list of designs. I'll setup the designs. But I think it
makes no sense to keep adding choices while ppl have already voted. I
think a freeze on the list of designs should be done before a vote is
setup and thats why I was asking you to send a list of URLs pointing to
designs. fine if you think we should keep adding more choices for every
design, we can do it. but it doesnt make sense to me.

Hi,
IMAP is Interactive Mail Access protocol.This Service normally listens on TCP/IP port 143.
Few differences between POP and IMAP are
The message parsing is done at the server side in IMAP.
It supports multiple folders.
You can use pine to access the imap service.
The configuration variable in pine is

come on, now. read the problem report fully before offering your solution. 
lines equivalent to your solution are present (along with some others) in 
the problem report.

it would appear that srikanth tried to test the squid config from the same
machine (on which squid is running) and had the proxy pointing to
localhost (instead of 192.blah ip address). since there is no http_access
line that covers the localhost, it is being denied the squid service. it
would appear that srikanth did not try if this squid proxy is working from
one of the other clients which have the 192.x ip address. if he tries, it
should be working (or we have to look for the problem elsewhere, say, in
the firewall config, etc). or, he can add a 'http_access allow localhost'
line above the 'http_access deny all' line and check that it is working.

Are users not able to login locally, or are they not able to login
remotely? Which are the machines that you use for your NFS? you have to
add those machines' ips into the /etc/hosts.allow file. IP of
the NIS server also needs to be on the hosts.allow file. Otherwise, the
home directory will not be mounted.

Can you give the exact error that gets displayed?
Probably the ssh client machine (remote) does not have permission on the
ssh server (new RH7.2) machine. Edit the file /etc/ssh2/sshd2_config and
/etc/ssh2/ssh2_config on the ssh server (New RH7.2) to allow the other
machines in the lab. Remote ssh should work then.

Grassroots push for 'open source' in Indian software

By Frederick Noronha

BANGALORE, Aug 26 (IANS): 'Open source' and free software could open up new
windows of opportunity both for coders in the Indian software power-house,
and also to benefit those on the wrong side of the digital divide.

Soaring global software prices, tightening anti-piracy laws and even just
the ethical edge it promises is pushing campaigners from across the country
to lobby with international organisations and governments for the greater
use of 'non-proprietorial' software.

Increasingly, a small but growing band of 'free software' and open-source
advocates are pushing for a greater emphasis to this form of software.
Unlike proprietorial software, open-source can be freely copied and shared
across computers. 

"If we calculate the actual cost (of pirated software being used in the
... country) India would lose a significant chunk of its billions earned
from its software earnings," argues mahiti.org CEO Sunil Abraham.

mahiti.org is a Bangalore-based non-profit organisation that works to
'affordable and simple' solutions to the non-governmental and non-profit
sector. Bangalore's NGO sector is rather active, while this city is also
considered the software Mecca and sometimes called India's Silicon Valley.

Such a trend pushing towards 'open source' was visible during a United
Nations Development Programme-organised meet to shape a UNDP-Government of
India country programme on information and communication technologies (ICTs)
for development held here on the weeked.

Dominant global players, represented by firms like Microsoft, are
hard-pressed to swim against the 'open source' demands.

"Every technology has its pluses and minuses. If you find it is suitable for
your purposes, go ahead and use it (open source software). But do an
evaluation first. Don't be biased. Nothing is really free," argued
Microsoft's manager for technical services in North India, Punya Palit.

"It's not just the 'operating system' that is available, but some 1500
application softwares that come along with it," said Pune-based Systems
Research Institute executive director Jagdish G Krishnayya. He pointed to
the potential of software like Linux, which is getting increasingly noticed.

'Open source' or free software refers to non-proprietorial software that
often allows its users to copy the programme across many computers, meaning
that the cost of the software often plunges to unbelievable lows. 

Its proponents argue that while this may at first seem as affecting the
viability of software businesses, it would throw open vast new fields to
software usage in time to come.

"Instead of spending money running after software piracy, the Government of
India should spend the funds to promote open source software (which would
also bring down piracy of proprietorial software)," Abraham argues.

Other initiatives also give hint of the potential sought to be tapped in the
field of open source software. 

Recently, UNDP's offices in the US were on the lookout for suitable Indian
participants for a global conference, to be held in October at
Washington-DC, on the use of 'open source for e-governance'.

Delhi-based alternative organisation Sarai, affiliated to the Centre for the
Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), along with a forum of lawyers in
Bangalore and mahiti.org, plan to build a 'copyleft registry'. 

This would list all resources which are publicly accessible and freely
reproduceable -- thus promoting its sharing, while at the same time
protecting the rights of the person who created the work.

But Abraham argues that public money -- spent on research institutions and
universities -- should go towards building software that remains
publicly-accessible, and thus 'open source'. He also points out that big
names worldwide -- including Nasa, Nato and Walt Disney -- were going in for
open source software, and there was no justification for India not.

NGO workers and IT specialists also point to other related issues that block
the power of computing in a country like India. Besides the software blocks,
there are other factors hampering the greater use of computers in this
country of a thousand million people but where PCs sold each year are barely
two million or less.  

Computing was not benefiting the commonman because it was being divided by
multiple standards, multiple vendors, its too-expensive nature, solutions
that don't fit Indian requirements, and more importantly the lack of
adequate and affordable local language technologies, it was pointed out.

"There is this hype created by computer vendors that hardware needs to be
updated constantly," says Government of Madhya Pradesh commissioner for
family welfare Aruna Sharma, agreeing at this meet in some way on the need
for countries like India to look to alternatives to battle the so-called
'digital divide' that excludes the poor from the power of computing.

Pointing to other options coming up, Dr P Venkatachalam of the Indian
Institute of Technology (Mumbai) said that India expects to have satellites
that would offer hi-tech 'cartosat' information with detailed images in some
two years time.

But, he cautioned, the country would probably have not yet built up enough
capacity and skills to make optimal use of such images, which could have
considerable applications in rural areas and development. 

As this workshop pushed the attention on using ICTs for development,
Government of India's Department of IT e-governance director S.P.Singh said
fishermen in parts of the country -- particularly the southern Maharashtra
coast -- were already using suitable technology.

Some in Ratnagiri, coastal Maharashtra, had gained some access to low-cost
fish-finders, global-positioning systems that identified their location and
communication equipment which was being used to boost fish-catches.

Dear Luggies,

I had posted a message reg. huge (>2GB) files on my linux system. These
files are the binaries of the fileutils package (ls, rm, chmod, chown
etc) in /bin directory.

Has anyone seen such behaviour? Is it a software bug, or a security
violation that I have to worry about?

The main problem seems to be because the NFS home directories are not
getting
mounted on the new machine. Is the automounter running? Check if you can
mount the directories as root. If yes, then check the automounter settings
and see if it is running. /etc/auto.home and /etc/auto.master have to
point to the right NIS maps.

The host keys are stored in the .ssh directory in the home of the users.
When users try to login thru ssh, the home directory itself is not
getting mounted, and so, the sshd does not know the public key of the
user's machine (remote). Thus, no communication can happen between the
user's machine and the sshd. This means there will be no key negotiation,
no password request etc. I guess thats why that error is displayed.

  Now I am not using auto mount. I added the entries in FSTAB.
  I think it is not the NFS problem. Bcoz my home dir is also in 
  same mount. I am able to login.
  
  If I try to Login thru the SSH with WRONG passwd then, following
  error is coming,
  Permission Denied (PublicKey, Passwd)

  For others, thous are not able to login, the following error
  is coming, ( Note : Keyboard-interactive).
  Permission Denied (PublicKey, Passwd, Keyboard-interactive)

Hi,

This machine on which the problem came acts as a firewall between our
dept. network and the campus network. Linux is the only os, and no users
are allowed to login except root on console!

Googling didnt help, coudnt find the answer as to why this was happening.

You could contact Raghvendra Bhat, who'll send you the set @ Rs 250.
Below is a note recently circulated via ILUG-Goa, acknowledging the same.
- - - - - - - - - - 

Thanks to Raghavendra Bhat <ragu@vsnl.com> for speedily sending across the
seven-plus-one-CD set of Debian Woody, which reached here promptly ... and
perhaps in time for the ECAP (if anyone is willing to demo that).

It contains:

	Disc 1: Binary i386
	Disc 2: Binary i386
	Disc 3: Binary i386
	Disc 4: Binary i386
	Disc 5: Binary i386
	Disc 6: Binary i386
	Disc 7: Binary i386
	Knoppix v3.1 bootable, LiveFS based on Debian

I am most grateful to Raghavendra for speedposting the same at a nominal
price of just Rs 250, all the way from Kochi, in the true spirit of
sharing that GNU/Linux thrives on....

If anyone would like to get access to this, please let me know. We must
try and pass it around to ensure maximum utilisation. Please note that
this is the latest version of Debian, and our friends in Kochi have worked
hard to get it across. Let's make optimum utilisation of their help. FN

Yes, thats the plan.  I was under the impression that the next meeting
would be held at Lateral because someone (sorry I forget names!)
promised a series of talks on the Linux Kernel and preferred to have
it at Lateral.

Could some folks from Lateral please confirm and let us know if 10th
is OK?  Could the speaker also please let us know if this is ok with
them?

Thanks.

cheers,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0208311855550.6124-100000@Bhuvan.bksys.co.in>

Hi,

Here i have a need to auto backup my directories from development machine
to my own machine in a seperate backup partition.

So i have a script to do 

* Backup & move the tgz using RSA public key authentication
* Mount backup partition
* Do file copy and umount

If i run the script it works fine as it is expected to. It moves the 
backup & mounts the partition and does file copy and everything without 
any manual intervention.

To automate this process i prefer crond and put my script in crond. Here
it reports 'standard in must be a tty' while mounting the partition. But
everything prior (backup & move) goes fine.

How do i rectify this problem? I went on hunting for details over the net,
but didnt get any clue. Hope to get it here or atleast some links?

For your reference here is the sequence of commands been executed in my
script(example):

$ ssh my_user@my_host tar -zcf mytar.tgz my_dirs
$ scp my_user@my_host:mytar.tgz /tmp/
$ su root -c "mount -t ext2 -v /dev/hda6 /mnt/part6; sleep 3; mv mytar.tgz 
my_partion_dir -v; umount -v /mnt/part6"

I suppose the problem is while doing su. But i am unable to narrow down 
the same. Hope to get some lights.

regards, 
bhuvaneswaran
