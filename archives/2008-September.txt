this is not technology - it is your personal opinion on what is a  
good business model. btw, running server side on linux is a proven  
good business model. Are you also opposing teaching cyber cafe  
operators to run linux on the server side? Do you think that that is  
a bad business model? Are you also opposed to them having one or two  
linux boxes on the client side? Or you think that any one who sees  
these boxes will get upset and boycott the cyber cafe? Have you  
experimented with these things? Have you discussed these matters with  
cybercafe operators or done any study on this?

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

route -- Show / Manipulate the IP routing table.

Summary:

Route manipulates the kernel's IP routing table (/proc/net/route). Its
primary use is to set up static routes to specific hosts or networks
via a network interface (like eth0..). Read the man page to understand 
the each columns in the output.

Example:

$ route -- Show routing table. It will try resolve the name for IP.

$ route -n -- Same as above. But won't resolve.

$ route -ee -- Show more detailed info

$ route -A inet6 -- Show IPv6 related route info.

# route add -net 127.0.0.0 -- Adds the normal loopback entry.

# route add -net 192.168.14.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0 -- Adds 
                     a route to the network 192.168.14.x via "eth0".

# route add default gw midas-gw dev eth1 -- Set the default Gateway 
                                            for eth1.

# route del default dev eth0 -- Remove the default Gateway of eth0.

# route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 reject -- Sets rejecting  
                                       route  for  the "10.x.x.x."

# route add -net 192.168.13.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw wify1 -- Adds 
               the net "192.168.13.x" to be gatewayed through wify1.

I prefer a workshop over an LDD as the 
a.time is short,
b.Repeating similar event in the same area, with short gap.

We can have Seminar for all non-cse-branch students about Software Freedom.

IMO,
Lecturing will be traditional as compared to their regular classes.
But LDD type of events are those one which makes the student to
participate in it.  I prefer LDD with Lectures, though preferring LDD
in the first place and in deed there is a need for lecturing, may be
in the second place.

The college wants a exhibition on FOSSE -type and not the one we had(i
mean the rural development- insyder) kind of a stuff. We have good
knowledge and skills to show case various foss  products  which we did
it in past.

Kindly add up ur views.

Dear All

I had recently updated Fedora.9.0 using yum update which includes F.F.3.0. The consequence and ramification is that the F.F.3.0 is not loading web pages at all but only displaying error message stating that  " The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading".  It worries me a lot as I am not in a position to use the machine. However, the network activities are functioning perfectly as ever and there is no hindrance to it. I used "about:config" to change the parameters of network default settings on the browser. But with no success. the stalemate continues. kindly render your suggestions to resolve this issue.

Suggest that you erase all traces of FF from the system as well your 
home dir i.e. ~/.mozilla (backup your bookmarks.html if you so desire).

Re-install fresh and let us know if your problem is solved.

For LDD, we need more human resource. Presently we are lacking in

Your present FF setup is doing you no good, so what is your objection to 
removing it and installing it afresh?

OK, before you do above, create a brand new user on your system.  Login 
into the system as the new user, fire up FF and see if you encounter 
the same problem.  If FF is able to connect/display external sites then 
something in your personal setting is really hosed up - you will need 
to clean it up.   As the new user if the problem persists then you may 
need to do a fresh install.

Hello friends,

Remember the LDD which we had in Birla Planetarium, where we carried
our desktop boxes, such laborious works are not here, especially like
logistics and transport of machines, further there is no bureaucratic
head to approve each and every step what we take. So it is the matter
of identifying 20 (+/-  approx) qualifying exhibits and build the
exhibit by involving the student community. IMO lecturing may be good,
but LDD be better.More over this may be the last or last but one LDD
of this year considering the college calendar.The only factor to think
 about is the time.

quote from Bharati in previous post >> The SAD part is still the old
(OLD) team is handling this tasks.
We are young(*YOUNG*) ;) dynamic agile team, i believe that youngsters
like us can make a difference. Willing to see some new faces.

Wanted to update that the problem was solved...
The noapm noacpi stuff was not required.
But I had to add i8042.nomux=1 to the kernel parameters.

Now every thing is working fine.
The broadcom bcm43xx module does not work. I had to use ndiswrapper with XP
drivers.


Regarding shifting to Ubuntu, not possible for me - I use a propriotory
software (LabVIEW) and is supported only on OpenSUSE and a few commercially
supported linux versions.

Yes I agree with this.

IMO LDD is the only day which allows the students to realize their college
life.

Dear luggies,

The show was very well organised. They called over 250 school students from nearby villages to have feel of what tech is all about. Kids - 2 or 3rd standard- like the educational software - mainly gcompris and childsplay - very much.

I felt produest when these children - may be touching computers for the first time in life - start using mouse and getting deeply involved in gcompris all in just 10 minutes.

A ounce of work in rural is worth a pound of work in urban.

Hats off to gcompris and childsplay team.

Good point, check if they have posted any BIOS updates.  Vista works but 
remem. this is an OEM version that Dell most likely has tweaked to get 
everything to work with the hardware whereas with Linux you are trying 
a generally available distro.

Is the model known to work with Linux (from their support forums)?  You 
might get better mileage in the forums.

Is this OT? 

I don't think so.

It is very interesting that India and developed strong places like Tamil
Nadu are unable to provide basic amenities like electricity.

But we should light a lamp instead of complaining about the darkness. ;)

I will tell you what I have done. It took me a long while to obtain the 
financial resources for it and a lot of asking around led me to this
solution.

I have bought an Exide Tubular battery that is fairly large. I think
from the cost you can figure out the exact specifications. It is around
11.5k.

It is apparently able to support one PC for as long as 10 hours. ;)

I think with two PCs I can easily get more than 4 hours.

What more do I need?

I did something else as well.

Instead of going in for an inverter and multiple separate UPSes I went
in for an online UPS of rating 750 VA.

Now the output from this one battery and online UPS is connected to the
main power supply of my office. I can connect all my modems, hubs, PCs,
speakers, monitors and so on.

Obviously you should know that it is high time you threw away your CRT
monitors. LCD monitors take up very little power.

As I am writing this mail there is a scheduled power cut.

The online UPS + battery cost me exactly 20k. I believe I hit upon the
right solution to the problem since I know there are just too many
options out there. Generators, multiple battery vendors, local made,
branded, UPS/inverters from APC and so on.

I think the whole thing rests upon the battery. (I could be wrong here)

And you have the scary possibility of the acid spilling on your floor.
Ouch! In order to avoid all that spend that extra sum and go in for a
branded proper battery.

Hope this helps.

Thank you.

On the occasion of Software freedom day , our member Mr.RamaDoss
desires to publish  his work  on Free softwares. This book is a
translation of Richard M Stallman work on free softwares in tamil and
Mr.Ramdoss clarified that the book will be published as a copy left
work.

I would request Mr.Ramadoss to upload the content, give the url to the
list and i  request the members to give citation in the list. finding
fit , we can release the printed version on software freedom day at
kamban engg college, Thiruvanamalai.

Yes..  its very true..  there is this possibility also..  it will provide a
very good chance for all .NET developers to embrace linux..  existing of
mono-develop and sharp-develop will make them dump visual studio for small
and medium projects..  Windows sales will be dropped, the VStudio sales
would be dropped, if the Mono matures in to stable product..

But in overall, the benefit to microsoft is more than losses.. Hence i
suggested Ruby on Rails for the final year engineering students for doing
their project.. (earlier i was thinking of suggesting .NET in Mono)

I went thru the .NET architecture..  the main advantage of CLR format in
.NET is that its converted to native code the first time it is executed, and
all subsequent runs will use the compiled code..  but the java byte code is
compiled everytime it was run..  Cant Java fill this gap easily?

including cafe owners, they use MS Windows. why do you think that it would
work particularly in India?

Recently my brother went to sweden for higher studies.  He plans to buy a
laptop there..  and he found that windows vista is the default OS supplied
in all the machine..  But many of the programs in windows doesnt work in
vista..  I just sent an astro software that works in XP here to a person
there, and he could not run it in vista..

few years down the line, when there is possibility of vista becomeing
standard, then users will find both Linux and vista equally new..

Btw, on the war of Linux vs Windows in cyber cafe's, kenneth's suggestion of
mixed machines is the best solution..  few of the systems can be linux and
the server can be linux..  by this, we have choices to give to customer..
Those who just want to browse can use Linux and those who want windows, also
has the offer..

Since mozilla has been widely used now, switching to linux for browsing
purpose wont make much difference..

Open office can perform most of the works that MS word does..  But, its the
user experience that ultimately matters..  I feel, Open Office has not
reached the level to match Word's sophisticated UI and user experience.  but
functionally  we can do most of the things MS does..

As i said long back, this can be a good case point for the academic students
to take on..  identify where OO lacks w.r.t wonword, and then take that as a
mini project or academic project..

             But this is something worse than what we have seen till
now. I think they will some day patent all the keystrokes in the

Mono would have been a great framework for Linux and other non-MS OSs if
the mono developers had not stated up front that they want to make Mono a
close implementation of the .NET specification.

MS as the author of the .NET specification and also as the organization
developing a lot of the technology behind .NET will always have an
advantage in the development of a .NET implementation and their
implementation will always be ahead of Mono in terms of compliance with
the .NET specification.

Because of this Mono has always been viewed as the inferior implementation
of the .NET specifications and has been shunned by most enterprises.
Barring a handful of commercial apps which target Mono, pretty much every
other .NET application is targeted for the MS's implementation of .NET.

If the Mono developers had instead worked on a framework for Linux and
other OSs which borrowed concepts such as the IL, CLR etc but was based on
their own specification (that is, it is not branded as a .NET
implementation for Linux/other OSs) and had worked on developing an all
encompassing API which allowed apps to run on this framework and yet be
written in many languages allowing applications to be developed for both
the web as well as the desktop, it would have made Mono a great framework.

Sadly, as it stands, the fact that the mono developers have opted to make
it comply with the .NET specifications has resulted in Mono being seen as
an inferior and potentially legally-suspect implementation (due to the
fact that it uses technologies patented by MS) of the .NET specification
and this will severely limit it use.

PK

Thank you. I am working on the feedback given by persons to whom I had given
the collection of articles for review.

There are few things that need to be done based on feedback (adding Tamil -
English Glossary, making the style little more simpler) by this weekend.

The preliminary draft can be had from,

Challenging a patent is way too expensive. Companies like IBM have a 
broad cross licensing of all patents with the usual industry players.

hi,
for the past 2 weeks I am having memory problems with a server. I  
restart apache, and within a few minutes top shows all RAM and all  
swap used. The server becomes almost unresponsive until apache is  
restarted. Can you give some tips on how to find out which particular  
site is creating this problem? There are about 20 django sites,  
around 20 wikis and 2 php sites.

Hi,
    Try checking whether your memory is proper.  You can test it by running
memory test utility available for linux.

I wasted 3 CDs, before running a Memory check on my RAM. I ran the
memory checkker that comes along with Ubuntu Install CD (old one). I
used to have to DIMMs of RAM - a 512MB and a 1GB. The memory check
revealed a lot of errors. I removed the 512 and all the errors were
gone.

PS: Infact, even the downloads were corrupted for me

Simpler answer: Run a memory check on your RAM.

That is because the image is too large! This is a known problem.

I think you need to dump the entire image to a USB stick as in
	dd if=downloaded_file of=/dev/sda 
(if /dev/sda is your USB stick)

Please read the web page for clarifications, especially the part
about known limitations.

Dear experts,
I am using Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. I used synaptic package manager from updates and
extra packages. Normally downloaded packages are stored in

/var/cache/apt/packages/

I backuped the packages to new folder in my home directory.
After second update, i checked the deference between old and new packages.
Both are different. What happen to old ones?

My question is,

How can i keep it all without lost in the directory /var/cache/apt/packages/

I examined options and settings of synaptic package manager. I could not
found it.

i wish to use for other ubuntu PCs.


Padhu,

Looks more of a database problem to me. Have you deployed any new 
sites/features in the past two weeks? You might want to do a code review 
and see if you're running inefficient db queries. Running top should 
also show you what apart from apache is hogging cpu/memory.

Apache. And whatever apps you are using, if they have their own log 
files. Disable all the sites and bring them up one by one. You should be 
able to isolate what's gumming up the works. From whatever little 
information you are giving, there is no way to know.

If the packages are updated then the old ones are "autoclean"ed. I am
not sure how to configure "synaptic" to avoid autocleaning.

A different way to do this is to install a http cache server such as squid
on your LAN. (Use "apt-get install squid" and configure squid to
accept requests from any machine in your LAN).

You then use the following line in /etc/apt/apt.conf on _each_
machine.
	Acquire::http::Proxy "http://cache.ip.address:3128";
This will cache all the requests for files that your different
LAN machines ask for and you will be able to get them quickly if they
have been downloaded once. (Note that all machines should use
the same apt mirror site.)

Other solutions are also possible using "approx", "apt-cacher" and so
on.

I think that it caches the downloaded packages in /var/cache/apt/archives

Also I don't think that old packages get deleted automatically. I have been taking back-up of 'archive' and then simply copy those .deb files in the archive of other PCs and simply update without downloading any stuff.

I am also putting link to the screenshot of my archive folder where you can see all the old and new packages cached.
http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dfhnbc4z_90d56k3g74

I suggest you take back-up of archive folder for usage on other PCs or after formatting my own machine. I don't know if that would help.

How much RAM do you have on your machine and how much Swap ( output of
$cat /proc/meminfo will help ) . Have you made any changes after which
you are facing this issue ? You can even check the 'slabtop' output to
see if there is a particular slab cache which is constantly increasing
and the memory is not being reclaimed ( THere might be a memory leak )
.

I also had this situation with backtrack, I downloaded bt3_usb.iso file
from their server. After a small search in their forums, I found that
their is one script to make live iso file from usb iso. I think debian
also will have that kind of script. So make sure everything is right
before writing the usb image into disk.

Message-ID: <69621d830809020950pe2160dfs8391e9a0ff2f7fa9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
One of my friend is trying to install Ubuntu 8.04 in his machine. He has
windows there. And, he is a very new user of linux, i mean, this is his
first step.
Anyway, his hdd is 250 gigs. There are totally 8 partitions there, 7 are
totally NTFS & i think all of them are primary partitions.

Now, when he go for the ubuntu 8.04 installation, in the "hard disk
partition" sector, he cannot select "Manually partition", i mean, this
"Manually partition" is automatically *deselected. *When he goes for
partitioning, "*Fully automatic partition" comes with his whole 250 gigs
hdd. *

As far as i remembered, once i faced such type of problem & solved this with
debian dvd. There in debian only, i got the whole hard disk partition table,
from where i removed & created new ones. But, my friend dont have any debian
dvd now & he is really a novice user here in linux world.

Now, what should i suggest him?

To the best of my understanding, x86 BIOS allow only 4 primary 
partitions per hard disk.  One of the primary can be extended within 
which one can create a lot of logical partitions.

By "deselected" you mean greyed out or disabled?   If so, that is indeed 
strange.

On the CLI, what is the output of "sudo fdisk -l"?

He should be able use CLI fdisk to delete some, if the system boots with 
the Ubuntu LiveCD.

Early on (2.4.x days) one could define partitions upto /dev/sdX11 (where 
X is scsi disk id) on SCSI disks.  Without the listing from "sudo 
fdisk -l" we really cannot help your friend.

If he cannot do this then it is difficult to analyze what his problem.  
Perhaps he can install another disk and install Ubuntu on it?

  As per one of our lugie's  suggestion I installed Ubuntu in a fairly safe
partition (ie. Free space in your harddisk)  You can estimate that by
following the harddisk cylinders in fdisk. You need to play safe here , else
you can loose your data.

After Ubuntu installation I used testdisk
<http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk>to recover the NTFS partitons and
other linux partitions I had earlier.

Creating new partitions using fdisk prior to installation didnt show up in
partition table for me.You can try that too.

by releasing "Happy Birthday to GNU," a short film featuring the English
humorist, actor, novelist and filmmaker Stephen Fry.

In the five-minute film, Fry compares the free software operating system to
"good science" and contrasts it with the "kind of tyranny" imposed by the
proprietary software produced by companies like Microsoft and Apple that it
replaces. He encourages people to use free GNU/Linux distributions like
gNewSense (<http://gnewsense.org>) and free software generally, for
freedom's
sake.

This is not a suggestion for a novice computer user!

I think the problem is likely to be the use of some kind of
alternative partition table rather than the standard MBR.

If it indeed that case that the Ubuntu installation CD cannot
recognise the partition table and/or NTFS partitions, then you should
check their Installation Guide for information on this.

If no such problems are mentioned then please file a bug report with
them as some novice users (who may not even know how much disk space
they have) may erroneously erase their partition table data.

Kapil.

To: "gnome-i18n @ gnome. org" <gnome-i18n@gnome.org>
Cc: "Indian Linux group ," <indlinux-group@lists.sourceforge.net>


Hi,
 The GNOME localisation community in India is faced
with a very peculiar situation, and it would be good
to arrive at a consensus on how to deal with this.

 The BossLinux (http://bosslinux.in/) folk based at
CDAC-Chennai have gone ahead, and translated large
parts of GNOME (I believe version 2.18) into 18
Indian languages. These are available at
http://downloads.bosslinux.in/Translated_Po_files/
I applaud the scale of this effort, but unfortunately
there are some serious drawbacks here that make it
difficult, if not impossible for this work to be
integrated into GNOME:
1. I know of no attempt to contact existing language
  teams prior to starting on this work. This is true
  at least of Bengali, Hindi, Malayalam, and Oriya.
  Worse yet, the language team line in the .po file
  header has been changed to some CDAC address, which
  can only lead to myriad problems down the road.
2. As CDAC made no attempt to talk to people about
  consistency, the translation terms used are out
  of sync with accepted ones that were used earlier.
  At least for Hindi, and now increasingly for other
  language, the terms that the FOSS community uses
  are reviewed by outsiders.
3. The translation quality is low, at least in the
  Oriya .po files that I saw. For example, "parent"
  as in "parent process" has been translated into
  the equivalent of "biological parent".
4. CDAC has offered these files up for the community
  to submit upstream, but has apparently no intentions
  of being involved in the process.

>From what I can see, and after discussions on #indlinux,
here is what I see as a possible approach:
(a) For languages that are, say more than 60% complete,
   I see little benefit in trying to integrate these
   files, because of points 2, and 3 above. For Oriya,
   I will ask the Redhat person who now does the bulk
   of the work to make a judgement call.
(b) For languages that have not been started, or are at
   a very low level, it might make more sense for
   people to integrate these files. However, even here
   there are issues, such as unsolved Unicode problems
   for some languages like Kashmiri. I am not sure how
   CDAC has done translations in spite of these. I
   strongly feel that good-quality translations are more
   important rather than just ticking off a box for
   having added another language, and would be against
   the lazy way out of just integrating these files
   without a review.
(c) The list of CDAC language translations with existing
   teams: Assamese, Bengali, Hindi, Gujarati, Kannada,
   Kashmiri, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya,
   Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu. There is an incipient
   team for Sanskrit, and no teams yet for the CDAC
   translations into Bodo, Konkani, and Manipuri. I suggest
   that existing teams take a call on trying to integrate
   these translations, and someone with at least a working
   knowledge of Bodo, Konkani, and Manipuri step forward
   to start teams.

Would like to hear your views.

Chromium itself is under BSD licence. So what happens if I download
the source and compile it myself! Then the abv referred restrictive
terms would not apply!

Am assuming compliling chromium would result in chrome!! Or do we also
have to compile V8 separately and link and build the full browser out
of it?

Well done amachu.

Who is the publisher?
How much will be the cost of the book?
What about the publishing cost?
Any sponsors?


Yet, pagination, spell checking, cover design, pre-press works have to done.

Only few days are there.
Create a neat To-Do list and publish to ilugc.

Hope we can get nice volunteers.

All the best.

It refers to the date that RMS decided that there should be an
alternative to Unix which was used, written and distributed freely.

I imagine that the precise definition of the Four Freedoms came
later. There is a "history of GNU" article somewhere on www.gnu.org
which you can look for.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

passwd - Update a user's authentication tokens(s).

Summary:

Passwd is used to update a user's authentication tokens, like

the Linux-PAM API.

Example:

$ passwd -- Ask new passwd for your account.

# passwd user1 -- Ask new passwd for user1's account.

# passwd -l user1 -- Lock user1 account.

# passwd -u user1 -- Unlock user1 account.

# passwd -d user1 -- Remove password for user1.

# passwd -S user1 -- Show short info about user1's password.

# passwd -n 30 user1 -- Set 30days as the min lifetime of the 
                        user1's password.

Note: 
All new users should read the following topic in the man page
A) Protect your password & B) Choose a hard-to-guess password

Read: man passwd, pam

I am trying to reconcile the announcement's title "GNU Operating System" 
turning 25 i.e. celebrating it's 25th birthday.  To me, this implies 
that the GNU tools (the Unix equivalents required for sys admin at a 
min.) and the HURD kernel (GNU OS) were available the day GNU was 
announced/formed.

To the best of my knowledge the above combo is still not ready for 
public consumption [uber geeks may disagree :)].  IMO, it should have 
been captioned GNU's 25th anniversary.

I don't think that the HURD was even thought of 25 years ago.
(The first article about the HURD was on the net about 1990 or so).

The term "GNU Operating System" represents in loose terms "a free
alternative to Unix" (free as in mukta). And that idea _was_ born 25
years ago.[*]

> To the best of my knowledge the above combo is still not ready for 
> public consumption [uber geeks may disagree :)].

Depends on what one takes to be the meaning.

 a. There is not one --- there are many free alternatives to Unix.
    In fact, there are perhaps *no* non-free Unixes anymore!

    Does this owe a lot to the resolution made by RMS 25 years ago?
    Absolutely. Of course, it also owes a lot to the resolve of
    the hackers who followed up on this and took it well beyond what
    he had in mind.

 b. One can run the GNU tools + HURD combination to get an
    environment as good or better than what was available as
    Unix 25 years ago.

    Does a general member of the public really need to do this?
    No. There are currently a number of far superior solutions.
    Does the software community need this? Yes. (See below.)

I think that there are a lot of people who disagree with RMS and
FSF today on a number of issues --- and they may even be right. I
sense that this makes them begrudge FSF celebrating the 25th
anniversary/birthday of GNU.

This should not take away from:

 1. The vision and resolve RMS and the FSF put behind the vision ---
 starting 25 years ago.

 2. The cleverness of getting a rather well-known person like Stephen
 Fry to celebrate on behalf of GNU. If any of the distros had managed
 it, it would have been considered a coup!

 3. While Linux may be the dominant player in Unix today, the
 alternatives like *BSD, Solaris and even the HURD have an important
 role to play in the development of free software.

 4. That chocolate cake looks really delicious. :-)

So here's to (at least) another 25 years for GNU!

Regards,

Kapil.

[*] Of course, the *practical* minded people may disagree and say we
should celebrate "things" and not "ideas". Like it or not, the FSF
has always valued the latter over the former.

does it matter? many societies celebrate date of birth as date of  
conception - which is correct as the position of the stars at the  
time of conception are more important than the position at the time  
of birth.

(e.g. Twisted). The code was written by Java developers who are
relatively new to Python, and it suffers from some performance issues
(like a 30-second startup time). In examining the code, I found that
they had done lots of things that make sense in Java, but which suck
terribly in Python. Not because "Python is slower than Java", but
because there are easier ways to accomplish the same goals in Python,
that wouldn't even be possible in Java."

Nine month back when I asked for a sample quotation it was Rs 20000/- for
1000 copies. Now that I am working with a publisher this should ease.

Would be great to have few. This will certainly increase the quantity and
spread it across. Individuals can sponsor the cost of few books and
institutions/ organisations can sponsor tens. Please let know if any one is
interested.

AIX, HP=UX and various proprietary forks of the BSD base etc. 
Proprietary Unix market has been dying for a long time but there is 
still quite a huge legacy base (and associated revenue) with it.

In fact banks don't want to change their Unix base, these systems are
well settled and giving high throughput.

I used the eventX subsystem of gentoo.

Long bump up - probably too late for anybody thinking of buying one,
since they've closed registration last month.

Anyway, my folks ordered the higher-spec unit in July, and it finally
arrived yesterday. There's still a long backlog of orders from July - too
complicated to explain, it has to do with a lot of factors, including
the fact that Elcot is not really equipped for retail/single unit sales to
consumers. The student laptop deal was really an evolving
experiment over the last two years.

The unit is an Acer Travelmate 5720, and it's the unit that's further
away from the camera in the Elcot Firewalk Video (google for it).
Both the high-end and low-end units are the same model, with
different amounts of RAM and HD, no differences otherwise
(the Dell unit shown in the Firewalk video was not offered, since
Dell did not bid for the tender).

It comes pre-installed with Suse Linux Enterprise Desktop 10.1
and Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron (multi-boot with grub). DVD install
media (a $50 value) of SLED is provided by Elcot. Acer also
includes install media of the lame Linpus distro, but you can safely
discard it - Elcot's Suse and Ubuntu pre-installs *just work*.

Elcot has pre-installed a huge complement of useful FLOSS SW,
in addition to the base installs. The most notable is VirtualBox
from Innotek/Sun, which allows you to run multiple OSes in VMs.
Other goodies include OOo, virtually every media app for video/audio,
wxCam, etc. They've gone through a lot of hard work to ensure that
the app/driver stack actually works with the Acer HW, and I can
state that virtually everything I've tested works out of the box.

The HW - this is the real deal-maker. The CPU is a Merom Core 2 Duo
T7500 (dual-core, 2.2 GHz, 4 MB cache, EM64T, VT, XD), which is a
higher end CPU than that originally spec'ed (C2D T5670 2x1.8 GHz,
2 MB) on Elcot's website. The retail price on the T7500 is a good
$100-150 higher than the T5670. More importantly, you can run
any x86-64 distro natively, and also do HW virtualization with Xen,
VMWare, etc.

- 2 GB DDR2 RAM
- 320 GB Western Digital SATA drive
- i965GM (Santa Rosa) platform
- 1280 x 800 widescreen 15.4" TFT display
- Intel X3100 integrated graphics
- 62x DVD+/-RW writer.
- 6-cell 4000 mAH battery
- Broadcom Tigon3 GigE LAN (10/100/1000)
- Intel 3945 802.11a/b/g Wi-Fi
- Bluetooth 2.0
- Firewire
- 4 USB 2.0 ports
- 1 Cardbus slot
- 1 Expresscard 54 slot
- SD/MMC/ etc. card reader
- S-Video out
- Intel audio
- Integrated 1.3 Mpixel webcam (works out of the box with wxCam)
- Touchpad
- Metallic magnesium upper case and chassis (very light and durable)
- no visible fan intake or outlet, passively cooled by direct conduction
- heavy-duty black Nylon backpack carry case (I found it perfect for
  use as a DSLR + lens carrying case)

I priced a similar config at Dell direct (Dell Vostro 1510 with 2.4 GHz/3 MB
cache C2D), and it came to Rs.46k + tax = Rs.51.7k + delivery charges.
My guess is that there's no way that Dell could have matched Acer's
pricing, which is why they did not participate this year.

As for the durability of the Acer, only time will tell - but it survived the
Elcot Firewalk test, it runs fairly cool, and it is a stock Intel Santa Rosa
platform - so I have no concerns at the moment. The build quality is
superb, and is better than high-end Tadpole Sparcbooks and Apple
Macbooks in fit and finish.

In short, a fabulous deal from Elcot, and let's hope they repeat it next
year or make it a regular annual event. Kudos to Umashanker and his
team for their hard work and execution that made this possible!

Message-ID: <6e0c9d380809070418v2945ae6bse0d5526790d76718@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi Friends,

    I am pardhu, please help me, i  got a problem using samba in Redhat
ednterprises server version-5.please help me.

My scenario is  One samba share has to share like some users have writing
permission other has reading permission.
like wise.

my smb.conf file below
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options (perhaps too
# many!) most of which are not shown in this example
#
# For a step to step guide on installing, configuring and using samba,
# read the Samba-HOWTO-Collection. This may be obtained from:
#  http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/Samba-HOWTO-Collection.pdf
#
# Many working examples of smb.conf files can be found in the
# Samba-Guide which is generated daily and can be downloaded from:
#  http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/Samba-Guide.pdf
#
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash)
# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
# for commentry and a ; for parts of the config file that you
# may wish to enable
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command "testparm"
# to check that you have not made any basic syntactic errors.
#
#======================= Global Settings
=====================================
[global]

# workgroup = NT-Domain-Name or Workgroup-Name, eg: MIDEARTH
    workgroup = MYGROUP

# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
    server string = Samba Server

# Security mode. Defines in which mode Samba will operate. Possible
# values are share, user, server, domain and ads. Most people will want
# user level security. See the Samba-HOWTO-Collection for details.
;    security = user

# This option is important for security. It allows you to restrict
# connections to machines which are on your local network. The
# following example restricts access to two C class networks and
# the "loopback" interface. For more examples of the syntax see
# the smb.conf man page
;   hosts allow = 192.168.1. 192.168.2. 127.

# If you want to automatically load your printer list rather
# than setting them up individually then you'll need this
;    load printers = yes

# you may wish to override the location of the printcap file
;   printcap name = /etc/printcap

# on SystemV system setting printcap name to lpstat should allow
# you to automatically obtain a printer list from the SystemV spool
# system
;   printcap name = lpstat

# It should not be necessary to specify the print system type unless
# it is non-standard. Currently supported print systems include:
# bsd, cups, sysv, plp, lprng, aix, hpux, qnx
;   printing = cups

# This option tells cups that the data has already been rasterized
    cups options = raw

# Uncomment this if you want a guest account, you must add this to
/etc/passwd
# otherwise the user "nobody" is used
;  guest account = pcguest

# this tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
# that connects
    log file = /var/log/samba/%m.log

# Put a capping on the size of the log files (in Kb).
    max log size = 50

# Use password server option only with security = server
# The argument list may include:
#   password server = My_PDC_Name [My_BDC_Name] [My_Next_BDC_Name]
# or to auto-locate the domain controller/s
#   password server = *
;   password server = <NT-Server-Name>

# Use the realm option only with security = ads
# Specifies the Active Directory realm the host is part of
;   realm = MY_REALM

# Backend to store user information in. New installations should
# use either tdbsam or ldapsam. smbpasswd is available for backwards
# compatibility. tdbsam requires no further configuration.
;   passdb backend = tdbsam

# Using the following line enables you to customise your configuration
# on a per machine basis. The %m gets replaced with the netbios name
# of the machine that is connecting.
# Note: Consider carefully the location in the configuration file of
#       this line.  The included file is read at that point.
;   include = /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf.%m

# Configure Samba to use multiple interfaces
# If you have multiple network interfaces then you must list them
# here. See the man page for details.
;   interfaces = 192.168.12.2/24 192.168.13.2/24

# Browser Control Options:
# set local master to no if you don't want Samba to become a master
# browser on your network. Otherwise the normal election rules apply
;   local master = no

# OS Level determines the precedence of this server in master browser
# elections. The default value should be reasonable
;   os level = 33

# Domain Master specifies Samba to be the Domain Master Browser. This
# allows Samba to collate browse lists between subnets. Don't use this
# if you already have a Windows NT domain controller doing this job
;   domain master = yes

# Preferred Master causes Samba to force a local browser election on startup
# and gives it a slightly higher chance of winning the election
;   preferred master = yes

# Enable this if you want Samba to be a domain logon server for
# Windows95 workstations.
;   domain logons = yes

# if you enable domain logons then you may want a per-machine or
# per user logon script
# run a specific logon batch file per workstation (machine)
;   logon script = %m.bat
# run a specific logon batch file per username
;   logon script = %U.bat

# Where to store roving profiles (only for Win95 and WinNT)
#        %L substitutes for this servers netbios name, %U is username
#        You must uncomment the [Profiles] share below
;   logon path = \\%L\Profiles\%U <file://%25l/Profiles/%25U>

# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable it's WINS
Server
;   wins support = yes

# WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client
#    Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
;   wins server = w.x.y.z

# WINS Proxy - Tells Samba to answer name resolution queries on
# behalf of a non WINS capable client, for this to work there must be
# at least one    WINS Server on the network. The default is NO.
;   wins proxy = yes

# DNS Proxy - tells Samba whether or not to try to resolve NetBIOS names
# via DNS nslookups. The default is NO.
    dns proxy = no
    username map = /etc/samba/smbusers

# These scripts are used on a domain controller or stand-alone
# machine to add or delete corresponding unix accounts
;  add user script = /usr/sbin/useradd %u
;  add group script = /usr/sbin/groupadd %g
;  add machine script = /usr/sbin/adduser -n -g machines -c Machine -d

;  comment = PC Directories
;  path = /usr/pc/%m
;  public = no
;  writable = yes

# A publicly accessible directory, read/write to all users. Note that all
files
# created in the directory by users will be owned by the default user, so
# any user with access can delete any other user's files. Obviously this
# directory must be writable by the default user. Another user could of
course

# The following two entries demonstrate how to share a directory so that two
# users can place files there that will be owned by the specific users. In
this
# setup, the directory should be writable by both users and should have the
# sticky bit set on it to prevent abuse. Obviously this could be extended to
# as many users as required.

Definitely he is talking about "Red Hat"; You can understand it from some
word... "linux" + "software" + "os"  :)

Yes, but IMO better to confirm, I did run a search on the term in case
such a distro existed but didn't find any results, so asked him to
clarify. :)

Check the samba log file for one. And secondly, how are you trying to
mount the filesystem on the client?

>>>My scenario is  One samba share has to share like some users have writing
permission other has reading permission.
like wise.

This should not be a problem.
The best way to handle this (IMHO) is to give the permissions required to
the directory  you are exporting as a share.

in other words Unix/Linux file system permissions have a higher  ranking
over the Samba permissions.

Give the required permissions and just makesure that you update the smb
passwd  for a user based login and  you are done.

Let me know if you face any problems..

If the mail server IP Address and Domain Name is not properly
registered, then your mails will be rejected or classified as
a spam by most of the mail servers.

Your problem would be that you do not want to spend 2 hours on each
machine. Learn to use some kind of tool like kickstart or
fully-automated-install (FAI) to automate the installation of all the
machines except the first one.

Basically, the idea is that all the remaining machines are installed
in a way like the first one and the installation of these remaining
machines is automatic.

You can further speed up the installation by making a local copy of
all the packages available via the first machine.

Regards,

Kapil.

Don't look at the ibm website for thinkpad models. Contact your local
ibm/lenovo dealer who will give you much more variety on the thinkpad
R or T series.

You can also make use of tools like Clonezilla, which can take a 
snapshot of your hard disk after you have installed and configured the 
first machine to meet your requirements. Then just copy this image using 
Clonezilla to all other harddisks. You might require to do minimum 
configuration changes and fixes if it doesn't work. This serves 
wonderfully well if all your computers share similar hardware spec. 
Also, if you have a backup of your master image safely, even if one of 
the machine conks off, you can easily get back the machine to starting 
point with minimal effort.

Sir,

    1. For other distros, you can use Puppy Linux or xubuntu. I prefer
xubuntu.
    2. try custom Installation instead of default installation.
    3. After installation, you must fine tune your system performance by
stopping unwanted services.
    4. reduce the usage of high end graphics, uninstall games for more space
and make minimum partitions.
    5. To avoid multiple installation for same configuration PCs,   use G4L
(Ghost for linux- support  FTP cloning) or clone zilla live. One more way is
network installation which is most useful to handle more than one PC at a
time.

Padhu,
Ooty.

I admit that this comparison looks a bit confusing but the devil is in
the details! (click More Details) Here are some of the extra features
of the more expensive models:

1. Core 2 Duo vs Dual core processor (Core 2 is better)
2. Windows (I didn't say all features are positive!)
3. 160 GB hard disk vs 120 GB
4. 1 GB vs 512 MB
4. 2.83 Kg vs 2.91 Kg (loss of wt of DVD drive!)
5. Carry-in exchange warranty

I would suspect that it is (1) and (6) which add most significantly
to the cost. The loss of DVD drive would reduce the price but not by
much and the addition of Windows would more that cover that by a
corresponding increase.

Kapil.

How times have changed!

In 1996 someone challenged me to run GNU/Linux with X, Emacs and
TeX/Xdvi on a 486 with 4MB of RAM. The challenger lost!

I know that is not the same as OO or FF. Both of these use memory in a
way that makes one wonder why people had those nasty acronyms for
Emacs (for example, Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping).

Still, I suspect that a 128 MB RAM machine which is used only for FF
and OO should work just fine as long as one does not enable all the
whizz-bangs of the GNOME/KDE interface as well.

Regards,

Kapil.

Sorry, no modem was detected!  Is it in use by another program?
Did you configure it properly with setserial?

Please read the FAQ at http://open.nit.ca/wiki/?WvDial

If you still have problems, send mail to <wvdial-list@lists.nit.ca>.


I tried to include the device in kernal module using,

mode. You need to switch the phone to modem mode.

This can be done from the phone's key pad. I don't know if the
phone tools which come with GNU/Linux can perform the switching from
software.

Another method is not to connect with USB but with Bluetooth. In that
you can use it as a Bluetooth modem.

Regards,

Kapil.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

vlock -- Virtual Console lock program

Summary:

vlock is a program to lock one or more sessions on the text console.  
This is especially useful for Linux machines which have multiple users
with access to the console.  One user may lock his/her session(s)  
while still allowing other users to use the system on other consoles.
If desired, the entire console may be locked and console switching
disabled.

To unlock, Password of the user, who locked it, Or root is needed.

Example:

$ vlock -- Lock the current session.

$ vlock -c -- Same as above.

$ vlock -a -- Lock all console sessions and disable the console 
              switching.

Read: man vlock

HTH :)

I have come across nmask as short form of netmask.

If nmask is indeed a program then man/info on respective item should

You are better off showing more variety instead of picking just one in 
each category. You would have to assume the needs and the solutions that 
meets those needs are going to be diverse.

Seems like the -lrt and -ldl flags are missing. Try this

$ gcc  -I/usr/include -DFUSEINST="\"/usr\"" -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
-DFUSE_USE_VERSION=22  -L/lib -o siefs  siefs.o obex.o transport.o comm.o

KG, please refrain from doing this. Such generalized, sweeping 
statements defeat the purpose of having informed discussion. How do you 
know what kind of site he did and how much functionality he added? Do 
you know his exact requirement? If not, how would you know it would take 
2 minutes to finish his project?

If you have data to back up your claims, please show it. Otherwise, 
please refrain from projecting your personal, unquantified opinions on 
the list. What makes you think people will take your opinions at face value?

Sir,

    1. For other distros, you can use Puppy Linux or xubuntu. I prefer
xubuntu.

    2. try custom Installation instead of default installation.
    3. After installation, you must fine tune your system performance by
stopping unwanted services.
    4. reduce the usage of high end graphics, uninstall games for more space
and make minimum partitions.
    5. To avoid multiple installation for same configuration PCs,   use G4L
(Ghost for linux- support  FTP cloning) or clone zilla live. One more way is
network installation which is most useful to handle more than one PC at a
time.

Padhu,
Ooty.

Xubuntu 7.10 didn't detect the network card of intel dot station.
I never tried 8.04 on it.

DamnSmallLinux worked perfect.

Perhaps the whole point KG is trying to make is that it's meaningless to
make claims such as "you can create a website in X mins using foo".

Just look around at web frameworks, rails/turbogears/etc.  It's reached
a point of ridicule where each framework is trying to out do the other
by claiming to "create your own blog app in 10 mins".  Who in the
right mind would deploys these toy apps to run their blogs and what's
the whole point of this race?

What's your linux distribution?  And how did you install FF1.5?
How are you trying to start firefox?

??

Your error message provides a good clue:  it looks like FF3 is
not correctly uninstalled or your application icon is incorrectly
pointing to FF3.

I'm not sure that's what he meant, but anyways - the point of the race 
is being better than the other frameworks. It's simple competition and 
marketing. It's up to you, the developer, to weigh which framework is 
the best fit for you. Caveat emptor. There are plenty of sources to help 
a diligent developer to make an informed decision.

Hello
All was well with F.C.9,0 but except Firefox 3.0 which was recently started functioning weirdly. The reason was that it was throwing an error message stating that 
"The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading."   whenever I try to browse page on the internet though all network parameters are functioning 
as usual. Hence, I decided to try my luck with F.F 1.5 and went on removing F.F. 3.0 from default folders.
The irony is that still the error message is being displayed on browser F.F. 1.5 too.
The kernel is "Linux genomefoundation 2.6.25.14-108.fc9.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Aug 4 13:46:35 EDT 2008 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux" I installed F.F.1.5 through tar file.
I have no clue as to how to get rid off this tangle?
with thanks
s.mahalingam

The room currently booked is called Chandrasekhar Hall and is in the
main building that faces you as you enter the premises.

If this changes to a different Hall then I will inform you by e-mail.

Morning and Afternoon Tea will be arranged outside the Hall.

Lunch is in the Guest house area across the road from the Academic

However, GNUPG keys will be signed on presentation of recognisable ID

I have had similar experience with one of Intel's latest Atom cpu 
motherboard - works with Ubuntu 8.04.1 and openSUSE 11.0.  Guess these 
distros have the drivers for the latest chip set.

Wonderful; plus leaves plenty of space in the 10GB hdd for user data :)

I would love to attend this. But I am thousands of kilometer away.
Will the notes/presentation/tutorials be available online after or
before the workshop? It will be helpful and very informative. Of
course, there is Mr. Google. But all in one place -> Nothing like it.

There is no 'BEST' CMS.
And there is no Single silver bullet to software development(Frederick
Brooks).

The question should rather be which CMS will be best for situation x.
Where x is neatly defined in terms of the abstract functionalities of
the site.

You have static IP? Then you can set the IP, gateway, netmask and DNS
in system-config-network. Atleast here in Mumbai, hathway now provides
DHCP so my internet is configured out of the box, even though I have a
static IP.

Dear Bharathi,

Congratulations for lining up a wonderful event.

I have booked my tickets to Chennai to attend this Workshop.

Can you please let me know where exactly this CIT campus will be? (I think
this is a part of IIT, Am I right?)

Please convey my regards to our friends.

Hope to see you in the workshop.

The CIT Campus is adjacent to IIT but not in it.

In Chennai, street addresses are virtually useless so I am giving
Tokyo-style decreasing circles of distance directions.

Some key landmarks that are within 1-2 Km:
  Madhya Kailash Temple (to the North)
  VFS Hospital (to the North)
  TIDEL Park (to the South)

Some key Landmarks that are less than 1 Km:
  Indiranagar MRTS Railway station (to the East)
  Indiranagar Water Tank Bus Stop (to the East)

Some key landmarks that are less than 500 m:
  Central Polytechnic (to the North)
  MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (to the North)
  Women's Polytechnic (to the East)
  Modern Bakery (to the West)
  Bureau of Standards (to the West)
  Kanagam Village (to the West)

The street leading up to IMSc is not yet on open street maps
unfortunately. <delete>Attached is the PNG file from OSM with the relevant
street annotated.</delete>
The relevant URL for maps.google.com is
<http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=chennai,+india&ie=UTF8&ll=12.994564,80.247746&spn=0.010266,0.013819&z=16>

I am told that ou can find more information on our home page:
 http://www.imsc.res.in/

Hope this helps,

Sorry for hijacking the topic, i just want to add a point here.

Perhaps the whole point KG is trying to make is that it's meaningless to
make claims such as "you can create a website in X mins using foo".

I does not sound to me in that way. Technically speaking, it is easier
to monitor top posting,bottom posting my automating it with a kind of
scripts, but what to do with a kind of rant like this?.

Message-ID: <e43212340809100058p3c24957ci6f200044114d94da@mail.gmail.com>

Sir,
    I used debian lenny live KDE in USB.
It is very nice experience. It is having some extra packages than normal
live CDs. very nice job.

I request the persons concerned (who posted in previous mailing list) to
take their concentration with the following,

1. In desktop, there is no icon for installation as available in ubuntu. In
terminal also, 'install' and 'install-menu' outputs error.
2. Copying image file makes whole extra memory space available in the
external drive as inactive. It is required to consider and try to make a
script to create separate partition for saving their data.
3. For external device image, extra packages may be include to use the disk
space beneficially. But not in live CD images because it is overloaded.
4. During shutdown it is showing instruction 'Take the CD from tray and
press enter to shutdown'. this may be rectified.

Thank you,

Padhu,
Ooty.

You are in linking stage. And it looks like, you missed some

Is there some reason why the prebuilt fuse-module-....deb
doesn't work for you?

If you have compiled your own kernel using make-kpkg then you 
might want to try using module-assistant to build fuse-source.

There are a number of changes/patches that distributions make to
kernels so when you want additional modules you have three options
(which are mutually exclusive):

 a. Use the distros kernels and the distros modules.

 b. Use your own kernels but packaged with the distro tools
    and also modules packaged with the distro tools.

 c. Use your own kernel and your own modules.

If you choose method (a) you are likely to get maximum help from the
distros help fora.

If you use (b) developers will help you but you cannot easily swap
your experience with other users.

If you use (c) you need to approach the upstream developers (lkml and
fuse-devel) directly.

Regards,

Kapil.

You will have to execute the gcc command within the siefs sub-directory, 
which contains the .o files. That is do cd /opt/siefs-0.5/siefs and then 
run the gcc command.

BTW, this is just a hack. The right way to do it would be to modify 
siefs/Makefile.am and change

LDADD = $(fuseinst)/lib/libfuse.a -lpthread

to

LDADD = $(fuseinst)/lib/libfuse.a -lpthread -lrt -ldl

And then rerun automake and autoconf. This is not for the faint at heart. 
You have been warned.

Vijay

Are you able to download the same web pages using wget?

If wget also fails, then try disabling tcp window scaling on your box.
As root, run:
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 0

I went through the *Makefile.am *file, but didn`t find anything called
"LDADD = .... "
Anyway, i wrote your given line.
Then automake it.
The thing which came:
*
root@laptop:/opt/siefs-0.5# automake
configure.in:2: version mismatch.  This is Automake 1.10.1,
configure.in:2: but the definition used by this AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
configure.in:2: comes from Automake 1.6.3.  You should recreate
configure.in:2: aclocal.m4 with aclocal and run automake again.
/usr/share/automake-1.10/am/depend2.am: am__fastdepCC does not appear in
AM_CONDITIONAL
/usr/share/automake-1.10/am/depend2.am:   The usual way to define
`am__fastdepCC' is to add `AC_PROG_CC'
/usr/share/automake-1.10/am/depend2.am:   to `configure.in' and run
`aclocal' and `autoconf' again.
siefs/Makefile.am:3: `CFLAGS' is a user variable, you should not override
it;
siefs/Makefile.am:3: use `AM_CFLAGS' instead.
*
Then i autoconf it. Nothing appeas.
After that, i ran make command, and it came:

*root@laptop:/opt/siefs-0.5# make
cd . && \
      automake-1.6 --gnu  Makefile
/bin/bash: line 1: automake-1.6: command not found

Are you able to download the same web pages using wget?
If wget also fails, then try disabling tcp window scaling on your box.
As root, run:
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 0

Thanks siva for your extensive feedback..

I feel, the trust that i placed on Umashankar have rewarded..  For me, the
laptop was despatched on 6-sep, but still yet to receive the communication.

I heard, that a lot of colleges had made use of this initiative.. My
relative student, said just in his college alone, there around 600 orders
this year..  They provided an offer to the student to pay in installments
along with the fees of coming semesters, and with interest, it was charged
at Rs.35,000

Eagerly waiting for the laptop, after seeing your feedback.

               I think that before starting installation, you will try with
any OS as an experiment. You may get more OS to you and you can take a

1. run the following command in terminal,

   This will show that firefox is available or not. If not installed, then
install it.
2. If you are having KDE then Konqueror is default browser. then must add

3. If you want an short cut of Firefox browser in Desktop, then create it

I was not joking - the moment one creates a plone instance, it gives a 
full-fledged CMS without any need for further customisation - the two minutes 
I mentioned was the time taken for the site to load. For non-programmers who 
want out-of-the-box functionality and who want to sleep at nights, plone is 
the ideal solution. I moved away from plone for two reasons

1. in those days plone hosting was expensive
2. I was doing highly customised sites and plone was too difficult for me to 
customise - specifically integration with an external database.

That said, I hear now that zope3 has excellent integration with SQLalchemy - 
so this problem does not exist.

I did not reply to your original post because I do not think this list is a 
place for preaching and lecturing people on how and what to post. Talking 
about breach of rules is one thing, this kind of sermonising is another.

btw, there *is* a world beyond php ...

hi.
I have two mail accounts - at foo.com and bar.com. foo mail should go through 
foo server and bar mail through bar server. How to get kmail to do this? 
Although I have defined both accounts with pop and smtp servers, kmail tries 
to send all the mail through the default foo server. So all mail from bar id 
gets relaying denied.

Hi Mr. Ravi Jaya,

Before the thread  takes a meaningless turns, it would be better if
you could help us in terms of providing information on your
requirement. Keeping the requirement clearer, we can talk about the
limitation and advantages  with each respect to each cms and share our
experiences.
Shooting a suggestion , without this data in hand, will be a premature
talk, and any *TECHNICAL CONSULTANT*  in this floor will know that.

Well, there's not much I can do if you consider it preaching - I have 
clearly told you why I thought that sort of replying is unhelpful. If 
you think it is indeed informative, you are obviously free to continue 
doing so.

I agree. I could have suggested a few variants of my own. But I didn't 
have enough information to suggest him something else that would help 
him. He didn't express any need for 'alternative' solutions either. If 
the common solution is going to be enough for him, why make him go 
through the trouble of special cases?

If indeed I thought that I have something to contribute that is unkown 
or normally ignored, I would at least give him clear reasons why it is 
better than the most common alternative. All I'm saying is you have to 
make a case as to why you think your solution is better, since you're 
suggesting something different than others.

In the outgoing settings there is a check box to bind to a specific smtp server.  At the moment, I don't have access to my comp. to give the details.

I haven't tried too many CMS's around but have been fiddling around
with XOOPS recently. It has modules for integrating a lot of features
including forums, wiki, blogs, polls, article manager that you need.
You might want to give it a look then research further on it.

>>my requirement is to maintain an community portal, which consist of
reference materials, forum and polls. Along with that  i also in need of
wiki. for wiki i could use  trac.

I am not advocating/impeaching  any specific product of cms here but i
am recording my experience which in my view , that would help the OP

I am just churning the web for the first parameter , handling large
file formats and presume your reference material might(i presume
might) be of large file in size.

Some of the cms and their problems are listed below.The main reason
for comparing the drawbacks with respect to the problem is making
aware about the issues out there, and the findings listed  are far
from complete.
As problems might be there and also the fixes might be there to the
relevant problems, and we never know whether it is a 2 minutes of
work!!! or 20 hours of work and as a new user to those environments,
only the estimation can be done as we cross the bridge when it comes.


Plone:
When working with reference materials ,you might need to upload large
file formats and that There is an article which talks about plone
drawbacks in default mode. Kindly go through
http://www.contentmanagementsoftware.info/blog/large-files-management
and by default plone doesnt has the zodb blob. There are some round
about way of achieving this. As a beginner might have a steep learning
curve in addressing this problem.

A feature which has been accepted as a need by the plone strategic
community and a ticket was opened #7822 plone dev which does not have
the current status of the ticket.

Drupal 6.0x:
The drupal has a little more peculiar problem, if your resource
material is going to be "say not supported by getid3()  then you might
have to consider a fix at http://drupal.org/node/270994

Wordpress:
And security vulnerability been reported in the wordpress camp for
handling the large file http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4137 and
improved patched are available with server timeout on client request.


My suggestion would be get started with the most convenient language
you know and look out for the mentioned features  in the cms which is
written in that language you are comfortable with.i am continuing
search/research on this topic in between my work.i will come back to
this thread some times later. Mean while you can check out with
http://www.cmsmatrix.org/ for comparing various cms products and look
out for the features by visiting the relevant web site

Which license are you picking? I would recommend OFL instead of GNU GPL 
here due to the well known problem with embedding GPL fonts.

Thanks for the early feedback Rahul. We will definitely consider OFL once we
reach a stage of releasing the fonts.

Message-ID: <49902.61.247.255.58.1221204808.squirrel@www.songbirdtech.com>

My experience with the CMSs out there since I had to study them to decide
on what tool to use for a site:

CMSMadeSimple - Very simple and easy to setup. Has a few components but
not as extensive as Drupal, Joomla, Plone etc. I don't know if it has a
Wiki but it has everything else that you have pointed out.

Drupal - Very extensible. Lots of components. However, I wasn't too happy
with some of the components available. I found it too much like a
framework rather than a CMS. But I have heard others who swear by Drupal.

Joomla - Has everything you need and it is fairly simple to manage. Lots
of components and templates.

Plone - As Kg has already pointed out, this is a good choice. Can get
pretty complicated if you want to customize it. I use this internally for
the intranet and I really like it. Fine grained access control is a big
plus. Negative is that it is pretty heavy and also is a little difficult
to setup if you need an external database and don't want the ZopeDb that
it uses by default. A big plus for Plone is that it supports multiple
workflows for content updates with authorization levels, approvals from
editors etc.

Wordpress - It is essentially a blog software. It can be made to work like
a CMS but it is still not a "natural" choice for a CMS.

Typo3 - It is apparently pretty good. I didn't end up using it because I
didn't have Php 5 installed.

ez publish - Pretty good and very mature. Well worth considering. The API
is pretty powerful. This is a good CMS to consider if you want a solid
underlying framework and you require a content management workflow with
authorization levels.

Jaws - Seems pretty simple. I haven't studied this in much detail but it
seems to be pretty popular.

If your needs are more esoteric and if you are comfortable with J2EE,
there are some good options from Apache which you can use - for example,
Apache Jetspeed. But please be prepared for some elaborate configuration
and setup tasks. Jetspeed is more of a portal software.

One of the primary considerations for selecting a CMS is the strength of
the community behind it. This is particularly important if your CMS is
publicly accessible. The user and developer community needs to be active
and thriving else you won't get fixes for security vulnerabilities and
neither will you get help if you are stuck with trying to customize
something.

Another consideration would be to select a CMS which is fairly easy for
your developer to come to grips with. Else you will find yourself in a
place where you have a nice shiny CMS setup with all your content and then
your developer leaves and you are now clueless as to what to do when it
comes to maintaining the solution.

Hope this helps.

Regards,
PK

Hi,

I am planning to buy an inkjet printer for my personal use (2K-3K). I
would like to get some suggestions based on this. The important
criteria here is, this printer must work "out of the box" with Ubuntu
8.04 Desktop, or with Debian Lenny (since those are the only distro I
have in my machine).

I ve already tested an EPSON Stylus C90 printer, with which I was
unable to take printouts from Ubuntu 8.04 though the printer got
detected.

As far as I have tried/used, HP Deskjet printers work out of the box 
with Ubuntu/Debian.

I had done this long back when I had multiple email IDs. Now a days, I
*think* the following will work.

1. In the Settings -> Configure KMail -> Accounts - create multiple
Receiving mails IDs and SMTP Servers(you might have done this already)
2. in Settings -> Configure KMail --> Manage Identities, Create a new Identity.
3. In the manage id window, Go to the Advanced Tab, click on special
transport and choose the SMTP server of choice. (Each ID should have a
different Email address in the General Tab and a different transport
in the advanced tab)

4. In the compose window, click on VIEW-> Identity

>From now on, you can choose the identity you want to send the mail. It
will use the corresponding From address and the corresponding SMTP
server.

The relaying gets denied because the from address is different.

hope this works

:-) Generally I "Proof read" before hitting send. But today wasn't my
day. I am having trouble with the super sensitive touchpad which
interferes with my typing. Have to fix it.

I meant to say...

"I had done this long back when I had multiple email IDs. Now a days I
use only one. I think the following will work.

The above steps are correct.  I set up my multiple accounts and 
respective SMTP servers in a similar manner.

The identity can also be set on a per folder basis.  Select folder, 
Right click > Properties and choose the Identity.  To compose message 
with a specific ID, click on the folder and then select new message.  
The From header and the respective smtp server are preselected per 
above setup.  These settings can be overriden within the compose window 
like you have said.  To keep all messages of a thread (including yours) 
in the same folder check box "Keep replies in this folder"

Subject: [Ilugc] eGranary
Message-ID: <69621d830809121312x8e8cd0fnd7ff8225f9495ae3@mail.gmail.com>

First of all i want to apologize for sending this email into this group.
But, i am not sure in where i can send this email for my solution.

The thing is:

We are implementing to implement the eGranary in our university library.
This eGranary system is in house system, that means, user of this system
will use this system within our network, means, within our university. That
means, 192.168.x.x

We installed this system in our network. Anyone can use it with changing the
default proxy from their web browser. But, the thing is, when any one change
it to use this eGranary, they mostly forgot to re-change the proxy again.
The problem is: next student comes & he/she cannot use internet.

Now, is it possible to handle both system, the normal internet & eGranary in
one browser simultaneously? I want to bring this flexibility to the student
that, no one need to change this proxy anymore, when anyone wants to use
eGranary, he/she can use it; and when anyone wants to user internet, it will
be ok too... in same web browser.I searched but didn`t find too much about
this.

You talk about two solutions here. 

 1. A switch in the browser by which the proxy is turned off or on.
 2. The proxy has some switch which allows access to the the
 "eGranary" or the internet as per user request.

Which of these solutions do you want to implement.

Kapil.

You can use an auto configuration file called proxy.pac, It provides the
flexibility to programatically decide the proxy to use using javascript.

I dont know if this solution would work...  Host egranary app in port 80..
in the browser, add the url for the egranary in the proxy exclusion list..

In our company we are doing this..  In IE, there is a check box "Bypass
proxy for all intranet URL's"

In this way, the browser automatically bypasses the proxy if an intranet url
is used.

Special Thanks to Hiran for coming all the way to Chennai setting aside Onam

SIL's OFL as Rahul suggested.

We are looking forward to professional/ hobbyist Artists to help us. Will

Either Debian or CentOS is a good choice for both servers and 
development type workstations (personal preference CentOS which is 
equivalent of RHEL).  Choose one and stick with it 'cuz  you need to 
consider their maintenance (upgrades etc.)

1. For the size of your network, a high end desktop system would do for 
DNS, LDAP, proxy server.  Recommend two systems one for primary and one 
for secondary (replica of primary).

2. A server grade hardwar for MySQL, Samba, Web server.  Suggest you 
find AMD/Intel channel partner. You will be able to order best of class 
hardware compared to name brands (no one of them give you a choice on 
the brand of hard disks for example) and the bundle will cost you less.

3. Suggest you also deploy a NMS like Nagios/Cactii for monitoring 
purposes.  This could be done on the systems for item 1 above.

4. For edge firewall, suggest an appliance (like Linksys, DLink) and 
ensure that all services on the WAN port are closed and then open up 
only the necessary ports for incoming traffic.

5. Optional - seek professional help for the migration in case you do 
not have in house expertise on the above.

I didn't find any info on google regarding how to stop this.  I used
to get orkut login page upon entering just "orkut" in address bar and
pressing enter, when I was using Firefox 2.
But it now redirects to searchportal
What's the exact problem? and how to get rid of this? Is this a DNS issue?
I use MTNL Broadband, so both the DNS listed in router are DNS IPs
provided by MTNL.
Entering searchportal.information.com in address bar redirects to
information.com
These domains are owned by http://www.oversee.com/ as shown by 'dig'.

Reset google as your default search engine in Firefox.  In your about:config
ensure browser.search.defaultenginename is set to Google.

Use OpenDNS in favor of MTNL/ISP servers.  Better yet, run your own caching
name server, it's pretty easy.  Just "yum install caching-name-server" and use
localhost as your DNS server.

Googling "searchportal.information.com" returns several relevant results.

OpenDNS also redirects you to "suggested" sites when lookup fails.
And BSNL has started using OpenDNS as a DNS server for DHCP setups!

This is a better option.

The workshop on last sunday was really interesting.. we the students of
dhanalakshmi srinivasan Engineering college also attended it. Though being
students we were able to understand only a 75 percent of the talk... we
could get a lot from that workshop.
All the speakers( Mr.Raja, Mr.Shuveb, Mr.Vijay, Mr.Kapil)really did well in
giving a good explanation on their topics(since we students could
understand).
We would like to thank all the organizers of the Virtualization workshop
Especially the environment was very pleasant that kept us there one whole
day.
We would look out for more workshops and demos like this in future(if
possible at the same venue)

Yeah, I too beleive that the problem is with the DNS, it's redirecting
to the given url if some domain isn't found. So, if you run your own
DNS server this will definitely be eliminated.

The anti-phishing firefox plugin (www.mywot.com) that I have reportes
this information.com as a phishing website. I guess, the default

Subject: [Ilugc] Clonezillza live CD - My experience
Message-ID: <e43212340809170059l373bb359x31c17f472077fd70@mail.gmail.com>

Dear LUGs,
                 I tried clonezilla live CD (iso - 86MB size) for making
clone desktop Hard Disk. It is using gentoo linux core for booting. It have
an Good GUI mode interface with less graphics and very flexable user
interface.
                 By default, it has an option to make an shrink the
partition size to make clone and also having option for grub boot loader
reinstallation. You may use original grub of source also.
                 It has an facility to make clone with remote drives ( i am
not tried it).
                 It takes nearly 15 minutes for cloning 160Gb Hard disk
(SATA) in 512MB ram AMD64 bit PC. it makes auto shrick the partion having
size of 40GB to make fit in target hard disk with brief messages and also
made necessary alteration in filesystem table ( /etc/fstab )

Only thing is more questions ( intraction for making setting for cloning)
before start the job. But it is required.

Please try it.

Padhu,
Ooty.

Message-ID: <e43212340809172241j2204e34fyf016574709ae01a4@mail.gmail.com>

Dear experts,
                   When I use BSNL broad band and Airtel mobile internet
connection, DNS IPs are different for both Linux and Windows PCs.

For BSNL GPRS,

In Windows,
202.96.209.133, 202.96.209.5
In Linux,
202.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220

For Airtel mobile internet,

In windows,
202.56.250.5, 202.56.250.6

In linux,
202.56.240.5, 202.56.230.6

When i tried to use  windows DNS IPs in linux, Linux OS is not connected and
the same result for windows.

What is the reason for this?

Please explain or give me an link

I use 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.3 as my DNS. And this doesn't redirect to
suggested pages when the domain is not found.

I cannot explain why this is happening but  I am sure that 

 202.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220 are the DNS servers of www.opendns.org

Which one can we use for setting up a mail server.  Either the full packaged
Zimbra or the core mail server available in Ubuntu?

I was considering Ubuntu server but my friend recommended Zimbra as having
many other advantages, like web based portal providing ajax facilities,
calendar etc.

Depends on what you mean by "mail server".

1. Internet facing mail exchanger which sends out mail for a domain
   and receives mail from the internet (to delivery to mail spool).

2. Mail spool server which stores mail, performs local delivery
   and provides IMAP/POP access to mail.

3. A web interface to mail which is integrating with a calendar
   service.

One or more of the above could be combined. Some form of spam
filtering would be required in (1) and/or (2) and some form of user
authentication would be required for (2) and/or (3).

The "courier" and "citadel" suite of programs provided integrated

On the other hand we keep things separate at IMSc and use "exim" for
the SMTP part, "dovecot" for the IMAP/POP and "horde/squirrelmail"
for the web interface.

You can try some of the retrival tools around, if they can find
anything. But, chances are it won't.

You can try approaching some professional recovery people in your
area. But, do you have any such data that you just cannot afford
loosing? Because recovery of data is very expensive usually.

Helpful link but it only gives the Zimbra Desktop beta, not the backend 
Zimbra server.  The OP is looking for a server solution.

What is the filesystem? ext3 or reiserfs or windows filesystems?

Is the hard disk is detected in bios?

More chances are there to recover the data.

There are a lot of tools available in linux to recover the data.

In most of the times, a simple boot with a live cd and mount the drives will
recover all the data.

give here the details of the filesystem and crash history.
let us try.

Message-ID: <7e6ceab30809182017j32855a14g33b2ed8831dcb2f1@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings!

I work for Celestix Networks and we were primarily a Windows-Appliance
company. By appliances, I mean firewalls, proxies, VPN boxes and
stuff.

But we are now getting serious about linux appliances. We already have
a few products out and are looking to expand our team now.

We are looking for people who are good with these aspects of linux and
development in general:

Creating and maintaining packages
Experience with some version control system
PHP/Python/Perl scripting (or atleast one of these)
Extensive knowledge of atleast one distribution
Great if you know how the package repository works for your chosen distribution.

Even if you don't have a lot of experience with this, but feel you are
good enough to pick things up a month, feel free to apply. Freshers
are welcome too.

Send me your resumes off-list.

Thanks

Please define crash.  Presuming that it is not detected by the BIOS your 
best bet is to take the disk to a reputable "data recovery" service.   
It is *expensive* and there is no guarantee of full data recovery.

Do you not have any backup of your critical files?

I have been a long term user of Exim (MTA) + Openwebmail (Web I/f) + Courier
(IMAP/POP with TLS/SASL) + Mailscanner (kaspersky + clamAV + SpamAssassin
based filtering) + Webmin (administration) combination.

When I changed over recently, I was looking at a single solution for all
these along with nice Ajax front ends. I tried Zimbra first and found its
server side admin control to be weak especially in filter definition. Scalix
fared much better on this front and I went for it as Scalix had other
features on par.

Today I came to know about an event called freedom and software
happening in Chennai on 21st September  through a blog.
The event website is a google site
http://sites.google.com/site/freedomandsoftware/ Most of the friends
participating are our friends. But this mail is for some
clarifications

The invitation text says  following

<quote>
M. Subramanian - The Mayor, N. Ram - Editor, The Hindu, Debesh Das -
Minister of Information Technology, West Bengal, Kiran Chandra -
Director, Free Software Foundation India & Prabir Purkayastha -
Secretary, Delhi Science Forum, have been confirmed to be the panel of
speakers.

The objective of the event will be the launch of the project for the
development of a Tamil Version of the GNU/ Linux operating system. The
launch will be made by the Mayor, M.Subramanian. The project will be
developed by engineering students with able technical support from the
IT professionals & professors, and infrastructural support by the
entrepreneurs.

The logo and caption for the Free Software Foundation, Tamil Nadu will
be launched by Mr. N. Ram.

The event will be attended by the IT professionals, Entrepreneurs,
Researchers and professors of reputed colleges, from all over the
country and the registration will be open to all, so you can bring all
your friends as well. There will be no entry fee for the same.
</quote>

My questions are Following

1.Is this event anyway related with Free Software Foundation?

2. This news is not announced  in any Free Software Mailing lists,
like FSF-Friends, FSF-Tn(http://mm.gnu.org.in//pipermail/fsf-tn/) ILUG
Chennai etc . It is not announced yet in gnu.org.in also. Why This
much secrecy around this?

3.. The above invitation text says "logo and caption for the Free
Software Foundation, Tamil Nadu will be launched" in the function. Is
FSF India decided to start regional FSFs? If yes why  this is
organising in a a secret maner?

3. The Invitation text says "The objective of the event will be the
launch of the project for the development of a Tamil Version of the
GNU/ Linux operating system", why there is a need of another
distribution when tamil is well supported in most of the upstream
distributions? . Let it be the work of  Tamil Localisation groups.

4. The contacts provided in the website contact page is not at all
familiar in Free Software Community. And There is no information on
who is organising this event.

On a quick checkup with friends in Chennai, they  says it is an event
Organised by Communist Party of India (Marxist) . Thats why the
secrecy. I don't have a problem in a political party supporting free
software cause. But If it is the case i am very suspicious on
following points
1. The exclusion of the Free Software Movement in Chennai in Organising it,
2. Creating a body with power structure before Contributing anything .
I dont think a free software Foundation is not needed for releasing a
Localised GNU/Linux Distribution
3. Secrecy in whole process of a Public event

I am expecting a reply from FSF India on this

Select the "kde" package (in Debian and its derivatives).

Of course, you may want to use "kubuntu" instead of "ubuntu" if you
are likely to only use "kde" and not use gnome at all. I think there
is also a meta-package called "kubuntu" or "kubuntu-desktop" under
ubuntu.

In synaptic search for "kubuntu-desktop" and "kubuntu-default-settings", 
these are meta packages.   They will pull in the KDE packages, you may 
still have to install individual KDE packages that are not part of the 
above.

"Reflect upon your blessings, of which every man has plenty, not on your
past misfortunes, of which all men have some." Charles Dickens


And He gave you of all that you asked for, and if you count the blessings of
Allah, never will you be able to count them. Verily! Man is indeed an
extreme wrong-doer, - a disbeliever (an extreme ingrate, denies Allahs
blessings by disbelief, and by worshipping others besides Allah, and by
disobeying Allah and His Prophet Muhammad SAW). (Surah Ibrahim, Chapter #14,
Verse #34)

       One month before, one of my friend came to my office with hard disk.
he want to recover the data. I start the machine with Puppy Linux live. BIOS
detects the hard disk. But HDD track is problem and making continuous sound
'tup tup tup'.after one time access, the files are vanished. Even though i
recovered the data from HHD. He is very happy. He is working in leading
corporate computer manufacture company.

for linux you can use 'SystemRescueCD' (224  MB iso cd-image)

Hence, try with hope and get data as much you can.

You can also use any live cd, use foremost to recover. Can also use dd
if it's possible to get to that level.
Good luck.

This meeting has nothing to do with FSF India. They have not informed us
anything about the meeting, or even about the people who are organising
it. I guess they are not interested in getting support from the Free
Software community either.

There is no decision to start regional FSFs. They have used the logo of
FSF India in their Newsletter which is downloadable. Their use of the
logo is, actually, illegal. They have not even informed FSF India

This remains a mystery in view of the surreptitious manner in which they
are organising the event.

No one seems to know. We have sent mails to the known addresses to find
out who these people are.

That seems to be true. This is a CPM event and the objective god only
knows.

This would appear to be part of an attempt to float a parallel process
to take over the Free Software movement in the country. While I too have
no objection to anyone helping the Free Software movement in the country
or even independently promoting Free Software (as many groups are
already doing), what this group is doing is really sabotaging the whole
movement itself by causing confusion among FS supporters. This is
unethical and could even be illegal (using our logo without our
permission). This is very unfortunate.

If any guy can help you, ask him to go thro the following also:

I have used it once and it is really a very good software but it all depends
on how badly your hdd is crashed also.

Hope you will get back your data.

Message-ID: <20080921021147.GA5320@imsc.res.in>

Hello,

As I recently wrote (http://www.imsc.res.in/~kapil/blog),
I created a Fedora domU on a Debian etch machine using "xen-tools"
and "rinse". The latter creates a really minimal installation
which can basically just run "yum" to install more stuff.

The question I have is what is a list of packages which will
constitute a reasonable collection of packages for a Fedora domU.
I would expect something like:
 yum install "Console Tools"
I could compile this list by hand but I am looking for something
"ready-made".

I asked this question on #fedora (freenode) and was told that this is
not a supported method of installing Fedora Core. As I can see from
the documentation at www.fedoraproject.org --- it is indeed not!

So I have a complementary question. What constitutes a supported
method of installing Fedora as a domU or a chroot? To give an idea of
the answer I am looking for --- something like "debootstrap".

As far as I could make out the only way seems to be to boot a fully
virtualised environment like "qemu" or an HVM Xen. Is that really the
case?

Regards,

Kapil.

Just an update

The website of this chennai programme changed the name of Newly
launching organisation as  "Free Software Forum, Tamil Nadu"

Anyway it is good that they changed the name. But Still a lot of
questions remains
The event is suppose to start at 4 pm today ,  The event website still
list the objective of the event as follows
<quote>
"The objective of the event will be the launch of the project for the
development of a Tamil Version of the GNU/ Linux operating system. The
launch will be made by the Mayor, M.Subramanian. The project will be
developed by engineering students with able technical support from the
IT professionals & professors, and infrastructural support by the
entrepreneurs."
<quote>

Let me bring some statistics

Gnome L10n page for Tamil lists Upcoming gnome 2.24 release is 88%
translated which is enough for becoming Officially Supported Language
in Gnome.
http://l10n.gnome.org/languages/ta/gnome-2-24

KDE l10n page says lists 41% translated string in KDE 4.2 Trunk and
49% translated strings in KDE 4.1 . In KD4.1 Tamil was an officially
supported Languages ( Only 5 languages in India qualified for this)

All Available distribution including gNewSense  fully supports Tamil.
Even Controversial BOSS GNU/Linux
<http://sankarshan.randomink.org/blog/2008/09/03/what-a-waste-of-talent-and-money/>
Supports Tamil well

Many among localisation groups are well aware of Free Software
Philosophy and bringing out Tamil Translations of RMS's essays.
Yesterday they launched the the book titled "kattatra Menporul" as a
part of Software Freedom Day Celebrations  in Jaya Engineering
College,  Thirunindravur,  Chennai.

Some developers associated with swathanthra malayalam computing is
helping Tamil Free Software Community to develop Tamil Text to speech
system based on dhvani

So My question is what is so special about this custom distribution? .
It becomes a trend in india top distribute Custom CD's with some re
branding for wastage of public money. Making custom CD's for getting
some some govt projects will  duplicate a lot of development efforts
and resources when new version comes. The projects like  Kairai
GNU/Linux (Funded by CDIT, Kerala) , Bharatheya Open Office, Indic
Firefox, Indix (all 3 By CDAC)  etc   went obsolete because they are
not integrated with upstream and no body is going to use the old
version because new versions are available upstream.

Bacause of above reason I request newly forming Free Software forum
Tamilnadu to drop the Objective new distro and guide associated
students and developers to work with existing Localisation groups and
Developers to make it it more effective

Hi all,
 It was worth reading the fantastic jobs you guys do.
In fact feel a bit envious that you guys keep on having and making these
fantastic workshops.
I do hope you guys release the documentation (if any made or generated for

Anyways I was wondering whether or not to share an e-mail interview taken

Anyways, here's something I did about a year back.

Q1: Why have they not invited or even informed many who have done a
    lot of the work for localisation of GNU/Linux to Tamil?

I don't think custom distributions or even new distributions are wrong
per-se. Creating a re-branded localised distributions _can_ help to
promote FOSS ideas _and_ give local people a resource to reach out to
when they need help.

However, it is important to realise that creating a new distribution
means more than creating a CD --- the creators should be giving it
long-term support. This should not be the "foundation stone" phenomena
in the virtual world :-(.

On a separate note I am surprised to see The Hindu involved in the
promotion of Free Software. Their "Special Correspondent" on computers
and communication is Anand Parthasarathy is a major FUD spreader whose
connection to ICE is via "oh-so-cool-gizmos".

Kapil.

Hi,

To my knowledge Organizers are mostly from Swecha Project, who have just or
recently landed in Chennai for professional reasons.

I took efforts to contact them personally, and once they came to know about
our work and activities, they  are willing to contribute and work together.
I can write more later.

An attempt to contact the Organisers of the event and get their feedback
should have eased things :-) Will write more later.

I had enquired about the fsf-ap mailing list:

It still says "No such list for fsf-ap".

FSF-AP office is at:

Paradise,
Secunderabad.

Bhuvan is in-charge for this office, and Kiran Chandra heads the same.

To the best of my understanding, Bharat Operating System Software (BOSS) 
Linux by CDAC was created to address Indian languages and also provide 
support (technical and fixes) to Govt. agencies using it.

Interesting to note that the group wants to create a new "distro."  Have 
they evaluated BOSS?  Rather than reinvent the wheel, they should 
collaborate with the CDAC folks and try remove any deficiencies (if 
any).

In the "old days" leaders would come by and lay foundation stones for
various projects like bridges/factories and so on. After this stone
was laid with much fanfare and probably a statue of the leader or one
of the mentors, no further work would be done on the project. There
are a few R. K. Laxman cartoons on this theme.

A CD release of GNU/Linux could be a similar "end product" of the
project rather than the starting point of one! That would be
unfortunate.

If you've used the DVD to install openSUSE, then it's already there in it.
You can launch YaST by running yast2 from the terminal. launch the
software installer module from it, and you can install GCC, Make, Yum and
various other dev tools from the DVD itself.

Best,
Atanu

I am carefully drafting this letter, so that eventually i am making
sure that i am not raising an attack or defame to any individual or an
organization. In any part of this mail, i wish not to hurt some one or
a particular organization.

Why this cry is for?

This email is been written, in order to bring support to the free and
open source software from the Government side and explore the
possibility of having a through review about the functionalities of
its bodies in ascertaining are they(government bodies) diligently
carrying out their duties. I raise myself to question the
functionalities of a organization NRCFOSS,which claims its activities
are in and for the free and open source software domain.

Who am i to question an organiasation - NRCFOSS?

I am an ordinary honest poor taxing paying citizen of this great
nation. My bread comes by giving service on floss based technologies.
I think i do have the rights and responsibilities to question in bring
the facts to the table.

Why this question all of a sudden?

This question is being raised , because the organiasation in question
"NRCFOSS" tenure is about to finish and there is a talk about
extending the tenure of the organiasation. It is the high time to
question about the review by the floss communities how the hard earned
sweated tax money which has been spent in the name of FLOSS.

What are the questions??

1)I would request NRCFOSS  to clarify the list about the
functionalites of their organiasation.

2)I heard that NRCFOSS has been granted five croces of rupees in the
name of promoting FLOSS. How this money has been spent over in the
last 3 years.

3)If FLOSS propoganda campaign like LDD/workshop are the lone
activities of NRCFOSS? how many such activities are been carried out?
and kindly give the LDD/WORKSHOP name , place and dates, Money spent
for the campaign.

Is this is the place of questioning??

I know, this is not the right place to get the answers, I know the way
and path in approaching the RTI officer in soughting this
information.I would like to explore the similar minds of this list who
are in the process of knowing/want to retrieve the organization in
effectively serving the community.I know few developers who expressed
their disgustion regarding with the support from NRCFOSS and there are
instance where the organiaser is led down by the *TIMELY* money
support from the NRCFOSS. Further to it, the vast tune of money of
croces of rupees  needs to be examined, how it is spent.
I personally have  experience with FOSSE'06, MUKT.in'07 and MUKT.in
'08 and would like to know how much has been spent on these
events.People who are interested in this campaign please sent you mail
either to this list or sent me mail in offline.

Thanks and regards,
Thyagarajan Shanmugham

What software is missing? On a Ubuntu DVD also you might not find the
software that you require because it contains only those packages that
are in MAIN repository and does not include packages from Universe and
Multiverse repos.

am having a problem with kaffeine - it plays vcds ok, but if the mouse is 
moved across the screen it crashes. If the mouse is carefully moved below the 
screen, or over the kaffeine controls, no problem, but the tiniest slip of

Hey,

It was a great opportunity to get introduced people who were contributing to
Swecha :-) I had known only Pavi and few others  due to mukt.in

Other than that, I feel, I am not the right person to comment on other

Weird problem! Use the same OS on both my work and home computer. It's
up-to-date with all patches. Kaffeine works fine! Although I most of the
time use SMPlayer -- it works fine, and is feature rich, you can use it
instead till this Kaffeine thingis fixed.

What was the last change that you made on your system before this problem
started?

Dear all

It was wonderful function at Kamban Engg College.

The event was for 2 days i.e 19th and 20th sep.
We have planned for about 20 stalls as posted earlier.
Thyagu went there on 17th itself and started teaching the student volunteers.
I joined him on 18th. Baskar, Linxpert ceo Baskar, joined us on 19th. Ravi and Mohan joined on 20th. 

The students have showed exemplary interest in the exhibits. They grasped the things well even though the time was very short. In all about 150 students volunteered for the demo.

The demo was very well received by colleges and schools nearby. Roughly 4000 students of engg colleges,polytechnic, arts & science colleges, teachers training and schools attended the LDD. Our LUG team gave them introduction about foss before they went to view exhibits.

The KEC students have formed lug name Kamban Linux User Community and the same was inaugurated by the college chairman.

This event was, in my opinion one of finest that ILUGC has done recently.

The success was the trio combination - the management,faculty and students.

The management was very committed to the success of event.

The faculty especially their HOD Mr.Jothishkumar was very highly dedicated to this. Indeed in he spent several sleepless nights, camping in the college. Hats off to him.

The students - really pearls. Very highly motivated, intelligent and dedicated especially one Shivamoorthy. I am sure FOSS community will get few more sudharshans from here.

Over all very excellent event.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank the College Management,Faculty especially HOD Mr..Jothishkumar and the students for the opportunity extended to us.

Raman.P

For remote admin/management of mysql, use one of the tools from:
    http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/gui-tools/5.0.html

Query Browser is pretty good.


If you want to use mysql as the backend DB from windows/.net apps,
then you need odbc or a .net connector setup and configured
appropriately.  See:

http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/5.1.html

It has been a long time since a FreeIndian was interviewed. There's a reason behind it!

Our current interview is a software engineer who has done a *lot* of localization and is associated with maintaining a Linux distribution called IndLinux[1] that supports Indian languages at all levels. This interview is a bit special (like previous ones) and the interviewee has presented a caricature of himself which was drawn by one of his friends. The image describes him, but to know more you need to read his interview from the link below!

Message-ID: <2796b4760809212306r2a33f74co9e814dda38026e9f@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sir,

I downloaded kernel driver for my garmin gps so that I can interface it with
my ubuntu desktop as the linux command for GPS interface was not working :

"bharath79in@arvsmanian:~$ gpsbabel -t -i garmin -f usb: -o gpx -F blah.gpx
usb_set_configuration failed, probably because kernel driver ''
 is blocking our access to the USB device.
For more information see http://www.gpsbabel.org/os/Linux_Hotplug.html".

The link that I had used for downloading garmin gps kernel driver is :

 http://sourceforge.net/projects/garmin-gps/

I have ubuntu 8.04 hardy heron. If I try to execute the downloaded kernel
driver, only error message results. It says as if each line is wrong. It is
a BIG error. Kindly suggest me how to install kernel driver for garmin GPS.

Thanks and regards,

     1) Login to the machine from which you need to access and open a
terminal (or if you
                                                               are  in
doze open command prompt) You must have mysql client here.
     2) then give the command mysql -h <ip address of the mysql server
box> -u <username> -p
     3) It will promt for your mysql password for that user. Login
and you will can access your DB.

dear thiagarajan :
** this reply of mine is purely on my individual capacity. **
the impression I get from your posting is that you are not quite aware of
what NRCFOSS has been doing, which I am sure is not the case.

Everyone of us, including those who are working at NRCFOSS, may have our own
views and ideas about how to promote FOSS. However I would state that ILUG-C
in particular has had set the tone for NRCFOSS college interations in
Tamilnadu, which we quote and try to replicate in rest of the country.

I am sure the inputs you get -- especially the critical ones -- can be very
useful for NRCFOSS (whatever future form it take -- if!!) and for the
community.


with best wishes

You need to specify where you want to mount the disk(called the mount
point) So it will be something like

#mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/newhd
 where /etc/newhd is a "folder" which acts as the mount point

I don't have a write-up on the use of a single vserver as
a firewall+DMZ.

However, I recently explored the creation of a Fedora Core domU (i.e.
a paravirtualised system) under a Debian etch dom0 and it is written
about (briefly):

Request people of CDAC to join the community efforts than having a separate

in need.

We are planning to conduct a day of session for KDE translation by first
week of October. The idea is to bring in new translators, improve the
quality of translation, documentation etc.,

more details soon..

I will state the solution very simply ;-)

"Cannot open serial port '/dev/ttyUSB0': No such file or directory."

Your usb/serial port does not exist.  Is your GPS connected to your computer,
and have you loaded the usb/serial kernel module?

         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I think you mean this is a logical device for dom0. So it must be
exported to the domU as a virtual device. Your entry should be
something like

 kernel ="/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.18-1.2798.fc6xen"
 memory = 416
 name = "test"
 disk = ['phy:/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00,sdb1,w']
 root = "/dev/sdb1"

Please check this before using it or you may trash your disk!

Kapil.

Your disk/root entries do not look right.  In your config, you are
exporting physical disk sdb from dom0 as sdb1 in your domU.
Ensure sdb, sdb1 is **not in use** by your dom0, or else data loss
will occur.  If sdb is indeed the right disk you want to export to your
domU, then try with root="/dev/sdb1".

Don't blindly copy and paste sample configuration from the manuals.
Read the manuals thoroughly to understand what these settings do.
Setting "disk" incorrectly can result in data loss.

You cannot use the same block device in dom0 and in domU!

You need to _prepare_ a separate block device for use by the domU.

As Raja said, you are "playing with fire" and are likely to destroy
your existing installation if you do not read the documentation
carefully! Actually it is safer than playing with fire since you
cannot really hurt yourself :-)

Kapil.

Friends.

The laptop provided by ELCOT is preloaded with OpenSuse and Ubuntu linux.

But most of the people dont know how to use them.

They struggle a lot little little things like bluetooth, installing
apps, games, etc

It will be so nice, if we give a one day seminar on ow to use linux
for all elcot laptop users.

It is necessary too. I see more users remove linux and put windows
with local service engineers.

VirtualBox is there. but they dont know about it.

It is our responsible thing to urge and train people to use linux.

So, please arrange a tutorial day.
We can get all the email ids from elcot.

Waiting for the Linux Laptop Festival.

This is a good suggestion. Why not also video(s) of hands-on usage from
someone who is using this machine for these tasks?

Well
[ This is not related to GNU/ LINUX but for the List ]

I just want to clarify , atleast 3 thiagarajan's are in this list, Often
interacting with strong comments

I joined in this list by the year 2000 [ 1999 ? ], I am a school teacher
from Salem. I used to avoid arguments of "flame" type.

I think it is better to identify people of same name with a tag attached
with their name

You can call me a "Salem Thiagu" or "Teacher Thiagu" or any common
identification.

Kindly consider my request

Have a wonderful day

Thiagu

dear thiagarajan :
** this reply of mine is purely on my individual capacity. **
the impression I get from your posting is that you are not quite aware of
what NRCFOSS has been doing, which I am sure is not the case.

Everyone of us, including those who are working at NRCFOSS, may have our own
views and ideas about how to promote FOSS. However I would state that ILUG-C
in particular has had set the tone for NRCFOSS college interations in
Tamilnadu, which we quote and try to replicate in rest of the country.

I am sure the inputs you get -- especially the critical ones -- can be very
useful for NRCFOSS (whatever future form it take -- if!!) and for the
community.


with best wishes
Srinivasan.

>>VirtualBox is there. but they dont know about it.

I tried installing XP inside virtual box.  But the size of display area
inside the virtual machine is small..

But other than that, suse linux is very nice to use with all pre-loaded
softwares.

For normal students, the plethora of softwares loaded in suse may be a
burden..  they can in turn use ubuntu linux..

I tried to find apache server in the installation, but could not find..
Software installation is little bit difficult in suse..

Hi,

After connecting my GPS to my system thr' USB, I typed the following command
:

bharath79in@arvsmanian:~$ lsusb
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
Bus 001 Device 005: ID 091e:0003 Garmin International GPSmap (various
models)
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 041e:401f Creative Technology, Ltd Webcam Notebook
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000

I tried dmesg also (Partial O/P) :

bharath79in@arvsmanian:~$ dmesg
[  251.939690] usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address
5
[  252.143169] usb 1-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice

In my dmesg there is no statement that garmin gps has been detected. How to
load the GPS USB kernel module.

Serious e1000e driver issue in SLE 11 Beta 1

Dear Partner and Beta Tester,

the Intel e1000e driver on openSUSE 11.1 Beta 1 and SUSE Linux
Enterprise 11 Beta 1 might have a serious issue with the
potential to damage the network card in a way that it cannot be
used any longer.

Intel and Novell are currently working to analyze and solve the
issue.

For the time being:

Please do NOT USE
        openSUSE 11.1 Beta 1
or
        SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Beta 1
on systems with Intel e1000e hardware.

Any other hardware, including systems with
Intel e1000 (without -e) network cards, is not affected.

We will keep you posted.

With kind regards

  Your SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Team

non-text files.

Example:

$ strings /bin/ls -- Prints the strings from initialized & loaded
                     sections.

$ strings -a file -- Scan the whole file for the strings.

$ strings -f /bin/* | grep Free -- Print Filename before each string.

$ strings -t o file -- Print the offset within the file before each  
                      string [o = octal, x = hex, d = decimal].

$ strings -n 10 file -- Print sequences of characters that are at
                        least 10 characters long (Default 4).

NOTE: Write one "Hello World" Program in C and try this command on
the binary file(a.out) of that program.

Read: man strings

"flame", at least to the extent I had seen,  quite often gets transported to
bitter / personal acrimonious exchanges and the social / societal cause gets
lost. of course, each of us have our own way of putting things across.

by the way, since you are Salem, I hope you are interacting with Sona
College of Technology -- especially Prof Saravanan and Mr. David Samuel
Azariya who have been making enormous efforts towards foss awareness,
training and developement among the students. Of course, their main focus
has been on their own students but, am sure, jointly you could get more
things done in schools as well.

with best wishes

getting information about functioning of an organization, with due

One suggestion, you can change your gmail accounts settings to display
your name as Salem Teacher Thyagu. ie  Settings->Accounts->edit
info->Name and change it to what ever you want.

Use it with VNC or rdesktop then. Also try kvm which should be faster
since this laptop supports hardware virtualisation.

Using virtualisation of course!

Why would a general user want to run an apache server on a laptop?

Also useful to see things in .doc word documents that the author may
not have intended that you see!

Suppose the author of the document has the common (and bad) habit of
using older letters as a template for new letters, by cutting out the
text and addressee and then replacing it with the new material. Since
MS Word keeps all the deleted stuff in the "undelete section" of the
file in case you want to restore it, this material can be viewed
using strings.

This actually happened to a friend of mine who got an offer letter in
.doc format. Since he was using one of our Debian desktops he asked
me how he could view the file. I told him to use strings (this was in
2000 or so before Abiword and OO). He not only saw the offer he had
got but also the other offers the same organisation had made to
others!

Try it on .doc files that you have lying around --- you may be

NRC-FOSS is a central govt project under DIT, jointly run by CDAC, Chennai and 
Anna University. The actvities of the Anna University wing are detailed on 
these three sites:

http://au-kbc.org/nrcfoss
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/web/
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/

the answer to many of your questions are found there. As far as the Anna 
Unversity wing is concerned, our outstanding success has been in helping 
spread FOSS in engineering colleges around the country. We have been 
especially successful in Tamilnadu (thanks to ILUGC) and Maharashtra (thanks 
to the Mumbai and Pune LUGs). For other activities please see the websites 
mentioned above.

My theory is that it spawns a sub process and it writes it there

The output has to be one of "1" or "2" unless both are being redirected.

It depends, you have not revealed how you are invoking scp.

At CLI, scp outputs the filename, the xfer rate, and ETA to stdout.

These laptops are for students, presumably most from the IT streams.  
They will need an web server if they get into web applications.  From

What kind of software did you find difficult to install?  IIRC, Apache 
and it's common modules are included in the media.

Did you try using Yast?   There is a whole bunch of repos you can add in 
Yast to pull software (just like in Ubuntu).

Hi,

Ma Foi Academy is organizing a 1 day workshop on PHP and related Web
Development Technologies this Saturday, the 27th of September 2008.

What can a one day workshop teach? Everything needed to start web
development. Why waste time and money on long courses when it is proven
you can learn all this in a day. The Ma Foi Academy, specializing in
career development, has pioneered innovative teaching methods that help
deliver what is promised.

We also help participants who are college students get final year
projects to practice what they have learnt at the workshop. And we
provide support to the freelancers to get more business and met
deliveries

For More details, see the attached poster or visit
         www.antanosolar.com/learn

Morning I thought of the changing "files" in the description to
"binary files". But before I give try with text and script files,
Surprised and dropped the change. Now I will try with other type 
of files also ;)

Commendable objective but suggest you do it through ELCOT sponsorship.  
AFAIK, the laptops are going to students all over TN.

Closed minds will *never* learn new things.  With such people you are 
wasting your time trying to show them an alternate way.  Let them 
exercise their "freedom" to choose.

This raises the point are "LUG members expected to be tech. support 
for anything open source?" when anyone who puts out something on 
Linux/OSS platform w/o support for it.

Since you have raised the idea please take lead in this

Of course, one could also install a zillion distros (including non-free

Hi,

It seems that sshd looks if the client is given permissions  (IP-based) in hosts.allow, and then checks for further authentication.

What I required was, if the key is found in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file, then, totally ignore /etc/hosts.allow  entry.. (if an entry for that particular IP is there...) or, in other words, grant access.

Does anyone have idea on how to realize this? am I missing some config here?

Thanks,

/etc/hosts.allow is looked at by the "tcp wrapper" library which
decides whether on not a tcp connection should be allowed based on
the filters provided.

Authentication comes much later.

If you want a host to be allowed to attempt authentication it _must_
pass the tcp wrapper filters.

What you are asking is like asking the watchman at the main gate to
let you in depending on whether your key works in your office door.

Try removing the 'quiet splash' part in the section pertaining to your
kernel in /boot/grub/menu.lst. I had a similar problem which vanished
after I did this!

This affects any distribution that includes 2.6.27 rc series of kernels 
which is usually just the development distributions. However the latest 
rawhide (Fedora development branch) has removed this module temporarily 
to workaround this problem till a proper fix is available.

Message-ID: <93655eb70809241727q68f5ccfeuab532782f7490bc9@mail.gmail.com>

I was not quite active during the period when Microsoft ruled
(1990-2000 ). But then the trend has been slowly changing , with the
popularity of other open source technologies , and better options and
not to forget how big a flop Vista was . Microsoft played a monopoly
in the market for quite some time . They went from the OS to the
browser and so on , ................... Now there seems to be another
player in the market ( even stronger a contender ).. GOOGLE ... it has
come the other way round( from the internet to the system ) and is
trying its hand at everything ( considering the news that even an OS
might be out soon ) , Google's approach has been very different from
Microsoft's but the final destination is the same . But I seriously
think a Google monopoly will do a lot more harm , given the amount of
user related data it collects !...
Is this all a <em>Monopoly </em>Cycle, one firm takes a monopoly and
then another comes up to break that ??
First Microsoft and now Google .. what next ?

Define Monopoly. Do you think monopolies are supply-centric or
demand-centric?

A wonderful initiative happening in Kerala, and I believe we did not
see an effort this huge to spread Free Software to such a wide
audience have happened before. I hope all of you would try to join in
at least one of the locations of the Walk. (You could even plan a tour
around this, there are many beautiful places in Kerala to visit).

At the minimum join the mailing list at freedomwalk.in and share your
ideas and pass of this message to your friends.

To: fourth-estate-critique@googlegroups.com



Dear All,

This is my first mail to the group and I think this warrants a short
introduction about myself. Anoop John, running a small IT business in
Trivandrum by the name Zyxware Technologies. I had started this
company with a definite vision to actually drive the change I wished
to see in this world. I don't know if you remember this but we were
the company who released the Chikungunya Tracking Software as Free
Software to the Govt of Kerala last year. You can read more about the
company at www.zyxware.com and more about me at www.anoopjohn.com and
www.thondomraughts.com

This time we are planning on a mobilization campaign across Kerala to
promote social and environmental activism in the state. A team of us
are walking from Kasargod to Trivandrum and are planning to organize
programs in Schools, Educational Institutions and other Non Profit
Organizations to build awareness about the issues. Additionally we
hope to connect with activist individuals and organizations across the
state and give them an opportunity and a common platform to
collaborate with each other.

I am writing to this group because I know that there are quite a lot
of activists in here and we need help from you to organize the
programs in your respective areas. If you are interested you can read
more about the project below or you can check out the site at
www.freedomwalk.in

If you are interested you can please subscribe to the mailing list -
freedomwalk@googlegroups.com by sending a mail to
freedomwalk-subscribe@googlegroups.com If you know somebody who will
be able to help us with this please forward this information to your
friends.

Hoping to hear a positive response from this group.

Warm Regards
Anoop John



FREEDOM WALK - A Walk to Claim, to Ensure and to Preserve Freedom

Background

Our society is ridden with problems - social, economical,
environmental. People have always been trying to solve these problems.
Sometimes they have been successful while sometimes they have not
been. The level of activism and the sensitivity of the people towards
these problems have been going down progressively. Good can survive on
their own while evil has to collude to survive. This lack of a need
has resulted in a definite lack of communication and collaboration
among activists in diverse areas.

Free Software as a community driven initiative has been growing in
leaps and bounds over the last decade or so. This has been made
possible because of the use of technology for efficient collaboration
and communication in the community. The parallels between Free
Software activism and Social and Environmental activism are very
close, but their individual progresses have been very different.

Objective

1) Run a mobilization campaign across the state to build awareness
about the issues that we are addressing.
2) Use this campaign to connect with and connect together individuals
and activists across the state
3) Offer Technology as an efficient means and a supplement to the
existing systems used by the activist organizations

Hypothesis

1) There is lot of inherent goodwill in the society. If we can tap
into this goodwill to promote social causes we should be able to scale
up any kind of social operations massively
2) There is inherent goodness in everybody. If we offer the right kind
of opportunity for people to offer their capability, services and
resources in a way and scale convenient and comfortable to them, they
will.

Idea

Identify a campaign that will be bizarre that people would find it
novel. I am making myself available for this project as the crazy IT
guy who gave up a life in the US, a job in the US and who came back to
India to try to do the impossible. Additionally do something that
people don't hear very often. So we have figured out this idea of
walking from Kasargod to Trivandrum covering all district capitals and
conducting awareness seminars in Educational Institutions and other
organizations along the way. Politicians have done this, Adventurers
have done this, Activists have done this - but an IT entrepreneur with
the above profile - not before. This idea have been thrown out to
peers and the only response that we have been getting is - Crazy - and
we think that is good.

What is this freedom that we are talking about?

It is the freedom to live our lives to its fullest without harming
anybody else and without violating any of our accepted social norms.
There are several areas of life where we invoke this freedom. We are
primarily concerned with three different areas - Freedom from Social
Evils, Freedom to live our future without having to worry about
environmental catastrophes and energy insecurities and Software
Freedom.

Our offer to activist Individuals and Organizations

1) Ride on this program to promote their activities locally and across
the state.
2) Use this program to connect with like minded individuals and
organizations across the state
3) Upgrade their operations by using technologies and services that
are being offered

Organizational aspects

We are trying to partner with organizations who have reach and
presence in local areas across the state to organize the programs.
Currently we are partnering with Free Software communities across
Kerala. These communities are going to utilize this vehicle to promote
the free software movement in the state. Free Software communities are
already well connected and they have reasonably good presence across
the state. These organizations will be able to organize public
functions and local gatherings where the general public can be
included.

An agreement has almost been reached with WWF to partner with them to
channel all the environmental activism and queries that are going to
be generated. WWF has presence in schools across Kerala through their
social forestry and nature clubs. They should be able to organize
programs in schools where these clubs are active

We are trying to mobilize support of other social activist
organizations and individuals to use this opportunity and organize
their programs along the way.

Attracting Media Attention

The walk and the people who are walking and the collaboration platform
are areas which we think are going to be attractive to the media.
Media has also been very attracted to Free Software and has been
promoting Free Software liberally during our activities in Trivandrum
and we are hoping to bank on Free Software for this program also.

Promotion over the web

We will be using web as a primary channel to promote this project. The
whole walk will be covered virtually everyday and reports, photos and
videos will be updated to the website - www.freedomwalk.in - to let
people across the state and the world know about this. The site is
designed to let people interact with the people walking on a real time
basis.

Collaboration Platform

There is no point in bringing people together just for the event and
forgetting about them after that. The whole point of this exercise is
to connect activist individuals and organizations together and build
awareness among the general public. The event should serve the purpose
of building public awareness. For connecting individuals and
organizations we are developing and are planning to launch an online
collaboration platform that can be used for free by this target
section of the population. In addition this platform could also
possibly give an opportunity for people in all sections of the society
to contribute towards causes and we will have an opportunity to
validate our hypothesis no 2.

General Strategy for the program

We are going to follow a more or less impromptu strategy for
organizing the talks and seminars and public functions.
There are three reasons for this :-
1) We don't have good centralized resources for doing this.
2) We don't have very strong local connections.
3) The organization is going to get easier once the public visibility
and the momentum of the program increases.

Pending items in organization

1) Actual details of talks/seminars have not been finalized
2) Actual details of organizations who will be organizing the programs
3) Contact information of people who will be organizing the programs
4) Approximate dates during which the walk will pass through a
district have to be finalized

Impromptu items that are going to be fun and exciting

1) Places of stay have not been identified
2) Path through certain districts are flexible

Strengths

1) Very strong in web based collaboration and building web based
systems to rapidly mobilize online
2) Permanent team in Trivandrum to act as the Virtual Operations Centre(VOC)
3) Strong brand presence and reach in the Free Software Communities
across Kerala.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

tac -- Concatenate and Print files in reverse order.

Summary:

`tac' copies each file to standard output, reversing the records
(lines by default) in each separately. It is doing the reverse
function of the CAT command (TAC).

Example:

$ tac myfile -- Print the file (Line by Line) in reverse order.

$ tac -r -s '[^a-zA-z0-9\-]' myfile -- Print the file (Word by Word)  
                 in reverse order, by passing the Regular expression.

$ tac -r -s '.\|' myfile -- Print the file (Char by Char) in reverse

Our office assistant attended a free seminar conducted by TN sales tax
department on E-Filing of sales tax/VAT returns. Guess what the user guide
she brought back wants? A few extracts -

*INSTRUCTIONS TO BE FOLLOWED*

.
.
.
7. Your computer system must be as window XP or Window 2000
.
9. Office XP or Office 2000 or Office 2003 should be installed in your
system
.
.
.

We use openoffice and I am sure we can "save as" an excel file, but what do
novice computer users do/think when they see this user guide?! I think it's
great that these initiatives (e-filing) are being taken up by the
government, but requires more thorough insight and good consultation.

What about OpenOffice?! I am sure that is universal. Well also you don't
have to be a geek to use a linux comp, use a browser to download an excel
file, open it with openoffice, enter data, save and upload it back using a
browser...

My point was than a *novice* user might think that without MS Office and XP,
they *cannot* do an e-filing of sales tax return when they see the user
guide.

AFAIR, they use some macros in the Excel file that is available in their 
web site. These macros do some calculations once the basic fields are 
filled with appropriate values. That's why the requirement states 
Windows and MS Office as requirements. If you are good knowledge of 
doing calculations yourself on paper or have a dependable CA to help you 
out with the numbers then you should be able to open the Excel file in 
OpenOffice, fill in the numbers without using the macros, save it as 
excel and upload it to their website. I also remember reading that your 
Form 16 submitted along should be digitally signed. Due to all these 
complexities, a mere mortal tax payer will prefer spending 200Rs for a 
CA who does all these work, including filing tax returns and getting you 
the acknowledgment (let them too make a living ;-).

Ooops, pardon me. I misread it as IT. But same should hold true to Sales 
Tax as well. The complex calculations will be done by the macros.

This is very ambitious. i hope you have the necessary man power, funding and local support for the event.
   Adhoc and impromptu strategies pose their own difficulties. A good plan is essential. you can approach various colleges to participate in the event but they will be more inclined to buy it when you have a good plan. More sponsors and funding for the event will be on the positive side. Media coverage may start disappearing if the number of participants start dwindling over time. The mechanism has to be sustaining.

good luck,
Sarad.

Subject: FOURTH ESTATE CRITIQUE Walking from Kasargod to Trivandrum for Freedom

General Strategy for the program

We are going to follow a more or less impromptu strategy for
organizing the talks and seminars and public functions.
There are three reasons for this :-
1) We don't have good centralized resources for doing this.
2) We don't have very strong local connections.
3) The organization is going to get easier once the public visibility
and the momentum of the program increases.

Pending items in organization

1) Actual details of talks/seminars have not been finalized
2) Actual details of organizations who will be organizing the programs
3) Contact information of people who will be organizing the programs
4) Approximate dates during which the walk will pass through a
district have to be finalized

Impromptu items that are going to be fun and exciting

1) Places of stay have not been identified
2) Path through certain districts are flexible

Strengths

1) Very strong in web based collaboration and building web based
systems to rapidly mobilize online
2) Permanent team in Trivandrum to act as the Virtual Operations Centre(VOC)
3) Strong brand presence and reach in the Free Software Communities
across Kerala.

well i think initially when Microsoft emerged , there was not such
fierce competition ... it caught the market and grew with it ..(
correct me if i am wrong)

well in the case of Google it has been more of a supply-centric
monopoly ..... considering that it has never spent a penny on
promoting itself , ....... users chose Google ...

Ambitious - true. But that is the novelty of the project :-)

Yes local support is the key. We are banking completely on local
support for the program. There are two assumptions here - the local
community has to rise up to own the event in their locality and then
ride the event to promote the local activism.

What we are offering is an application framework and the APIs -
communities have to hack their way in and create their own
applications :-). Isn't that how Free Software Communities work.

Like you do, I hope too that we will be able to get sufficient local
support. Additionally we are hoping to generate sufficient
not-so-local support to generate the buzz in the blogger community as
well.

Cheers
Anoop

[1] Please do not type in CAPS. It means shouting.
[2] What do you mean by "HACK"? What do you want to do in Ubuntu 8.04? 
Do you want to customize it and create a customized Ubuntu 8.04 that you 
can install in other systems? If so, what all do you want to customize?
[3] Right click menus are pretty useful. Why do you want to disable 
them? If still, where do you want to disable them, in the desktop? in 
the application windows? in the panel?
[4] If you are meaning the panel menus [Applications, Places, System] 
then you can remove them by right clicking on them and then choosing 
"Remove From Panel".

"right click the mouse button on the quick launch browser application icon  so as to get the launcher properties wizard( F.F.3.0 ) wherein enter into the command menu box, the absolute path of firefox self executable file  regardless of location".
(e.g.)  "/home/usr/firefox/firefox"  or  "/mozilla/firefox/firefox"

Are you able to download the same web pages using wget?
If wget also fails, then try disabling tcp window scaling on your box.
As root, run:
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 0

Outof curiosity, where did IIT Delhi pop up from in this discussion?
Or did I miss something?

One possible way mentioned in the second mail here:

Hope this helps.

Henceforth, please read the manuals online, search using Google, and
then post questions which are really nagging. See this for details:

You can install one of the following window managers from the
universe repository:

 ratpoison, awesome, xmonad, ....

Then delete gnome entirely. While you are at it remove the
firefox/epiphany browser as well. 

Install build-essentials, openjdk, emacs/vim/jed, ...

Login to the console and type startx to get your graphical
environment (if you really need it!).

After that you need not worry about menus anymore and can easily
concentrate on programming!

You will also find that your computer gives you _real_ speed unlike the
486 that gnome makes your Core2Duo hyperthreaded 2.4 GHz appear to be ...

Yes, This is a valid point, some can do research on this topic like "By how
much percentage, the industry or academic growth will be increased, if you
remove firefox (gmail + orkut) from panel"

Those bluetooth devices which require Bluesoleil driver work with the
inbuilt modules in the kernel. I myself have one such device and it
works as soon as the bluetooth framework is installed, right since
2004 when I first got my bluetooth dongle.

Only the real life requirement drives any good project..  If we see most 
of the open source projects, they are initially done for a specific 
requirement for the real life.

The main reason why there is not much of open source projects is that 
those who have technical knowledge is not connected with those who need 
a software for their opearations..

Also, there has been no major discussion in this group (as far as i have 
known) so far on any ideas to start the open source project.

I personally have lot of ideas which can be started as an open source 
projects..  but where is the platform to discuss all those..  only when 
we discuss we can create a workable model and then implement those.

Hi All,

I am a newbie to drupal, but want to understand it ASAP.So that I can
develop new modules on top of it, or edit already existing modules to
satisfy my design requirements.

I need pointers to a bookshop in Chennai where I can get a "book on Drupal
CMS", I am looking for "Pro Drupal Development" by John K. VanDyk and Dries
Buytaert.
but any other book on drupal is also okay.

I searched "Higgin Bothams", and few other book shops in Mambalam area, but
in vain.

Thnaks in advance,
Krishna.

You can buy it online from Indiaplaza and it gets delivered within a 
couple of weeks (usually within a week for me in Bangalore).

http://www.indiaplaza.in/books/all/1430209895/all/pro-drupal-development-second-edition.htm

Or you can try out other Drupal books as well,

I think their goal is to create a buzz and get as many people looking at it as possible. it is a good first step.

Only the real life requirement drives any good project..  If we see most
of the open source projects, they are initially done for a specific
requirement for the real life.

The main reason why there is not much of open source projects is that
those who have technical knowledge is not connected with those who need
a software for their opearations..

Also, there has been no major discussion in this group (as far as i have
known) so far on any ideas to start the open source project.

I personally have lot of ideas which can be started as an open source
projects..  but where is the platform to discuss all those..  only when
we discuss we can create a workable model and then implement those.

Yes, This is a valid point, some can do research on this topic like "By how
much percentage, the industry or academic growth will be increased, if you
remove firefox (gmail + orkut) from panel"
</joke-extent>

there will be frustration leading to poor productivity

in ubuntu 8.04 (even versions before that) comes with bluetooth support.

go to system > preferences > bluetooth and select visible and connectible
for other devices. give a name to your adapter too. then normally it should
show you the devices available. and you can connect to one of them.

if not.

install ...

#apt-get install

gnome-bluetooth
nautilus-sendto
obex-server
obexftp
bluez-utils

i don't remember all the pkgs right now, you may insall all the pkgs related
to bluetooth.

HTH.

Dear luggies
Consequent to the interest ILUGC has generated among students, I am getting lot of request for suggesting proects.

In some colleges, they have decided out-and-out FOSS based projects.

Please suggest projects ideas.

Please keep in mind the constraints

a. The projects are not fulltime for B.E students
b. Most will have only preliminary knowledge - but can pickup fast.
c. Should point out resources available on net

Message-ID: <928747.52544.qm@web95415.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

I just learnt from a friend of mine that I should stop using Ubuntu as Canonical is not contributing to the development of GNU/Linux systems as compared to other players. He also suggested that since most of its stuff, or nothing, is upstream so we cant trust it. Also his argument was, being run by one man, who may tomorrow change his mind and stop support to Ubuntu, then what?

So, I am bringing this issue to the lista and have people's opinion as to how much Canonical has contributed and how wise is the decision to use Ubuntu?

Here is the article of Greg Kroah-Hartman, maintainer of the USB and other subsystems in the Linux kernel mentioning Canonical contribution to be 100 patches viz a viz 230 by Mandriva and only 270 by Gentoo. Remember Ubuntu is quite young compared to Mandriva, Gentoo.

Please suggest.

This is a welcome move in our LUG.  I too had lot of enquiries from lot 
of students, but could not give an effective help.  Discussing in this 
list can bring some positive outcome.

Some of criterias that i feel are important:

1. The academic project should be done for some real life requirements.  
No matter, what it is.  If it solves a real life problem, then this 
project is worth while doing it.
2. The basic skills needed for doing the project is very important.  We 
cannot guide project at the 8th semester, if the students dont know even 
the basic.
3. Even MCA students can be included in FOSS projects.

The FOSS project that is being undertaken should be fullfilling, and 
should be towards implementing in a common life scenario.  For example, 
if the student are doing an ecommerce project, they have to work towards 
implementing it in real life, and atleast deal some 2 or 3 prodcuts 
through that software.  Only then, both the project experience and the 
software would be useful for the students.

Secondly, as we have seen, no single matured foss project is short 
term.  For example, wordpress has been started before 2006 and still its 
evolving.  So, we should have a setup, so that, we build a student 
community of contributors across colleges under a common platform, so 
that the project they do evolve in to a mature one over the period of time.
But for that, we need to have a strong platform, a vibrant community, 
and the open source development model. 

By platform, i mean, a site that contains the SVN, Wiki, project 
management, IRC etc.

By Vibrant community, i mean, the contributors should be passionate 
about it, and should not do it for academic sake.

By Open source model, i mean, the concrete process to commit source 
code, and a workable model, where different team takes different tasks 
towards the common objective.  Its a model or process that should be 
finalised before starting project and should be strictly followed by the 
contributors.

To achieve those, there are some basic requirements to be fulfilled.  
The students should be trained in using svn, and other tools to be used 
for project management.  Only then they will be able to maintain, manage 
and take control of their development work.
Secondly, regular meetings and conferences is to be held both in person, 
and over IRC, so that they would be able to discuss each and everypart 
of the project.

As everyone knows, a foss project is NOT merely a coding.  Infact coding 
contributes only minor part of the development.  What is required is a 
solid concept, with optimal architecture for the project to start with.  
So the students should finalise on a concept, and start periodical 
discussion on various aspects of the project and document it.

*FOSS Project that i undertook
-----------------------

*I have been taken an initiative on my own, to guide 4 students from 
Mahendra engineering college.  I would seek the opinion of the group 
members over it.

The project i suggested to them was "College ERP".  To develop a basic 
module for the college to manage their administrative and academic 
tasks.  This is essentially for the college management, and would 
greatly improve the management capability and decision making ability 
for the college.
I am aware that this is too big a project for a BE student to take it as 
academic project.  However, i thought, that we would be covering only 
basic and essential modules for the college, and it can be continued as 
a long term project with next batch of students taking up from where 
they left.

The advantage i feel is that the current student can involve in the 
project till they get a suitable job, and in turn train a batch of their 
junior to work on it.  Even after getting a job, they can very well 
guide their juniors with their technical skills.

My idea can mostly be a unfeasible one, but my guess is that if the 
project kicks off, it would become a active foss project, else, it would 
become a normal academic project.  So any way, there is no loss for the 
student.

*My Suggestion:
--------------------

*If any of the members are convinced of my idea above, we can work 
together and convert it in to an active FOSS project, involving students 
from various projects, working on different modules.  For credibility, a 
brand name can be created by starting a community enterprise, or atleast 
by maintaining a fullfledged website, so that students can always refer 
to, when they submit their project to their management.
This can be done, by forming team of open source enthusiast, who would 
guide the students in various aspects.

Please share your comments on my proposal.

There are many other suggestions that i want to share.  But let me see 
the response to this first proposal.

Regards,
Senthil

There are two kinds of projects here :
1) An Enterprise application which primarily does not have any intelligence
in it, and is purely form driven. The design aspects of an application would
be reflected here, and might not require much R&D.
2) A 'research' project - something like Face/Speech recognition et al - now
this requires a much deeper understanding of the subject and a significant
timeline for research and then the subsequent implementation. ( i remember i
started off my final year thesis in mid-second year)

Now, it all depends on the aptitude and go-getter attitude of the student to
choose either of the above. Though, #1 sounds boring, building a mini-ERP
system or an Order-processing workflow is NOT 'trivial'.

For #1, i have been thinking of an COMPLETE OfficeSuite - which encompasses
Calendar, Booking COnf Rooms , Timecards, project mgmt, defect tracking,
Transport mgmt, Employee DB and search, simple HR system etc etc.  I am
aware of 'independant' applications that cater to the above, but there is NO
SINGLE product which caters to above. Though trivial, this would be a boon
for small entrprises ; and if the students can afford to 'support' it after
college, they can also monetize it by targetting the SMEs - whose market cap
is huge.

For #2, there are loads and loads - depends on the research interests of the
person.

So the October season has started. I wait for the day when the season 
starts with a mail "I am interested to do this project and I have the 
following ideas to go about doing it..".

Though I tend to say that the students should typically start looking at 
ToDos, Wishlists and Unresolved open bugs of FOSS projects, get in touch 
with the contributors/devels and try to put their effort on something 
which is there and to be made better, I am myself wonder whether their 
college is going to encourage them to take those as Final Year projects 
as their definition of such things still remain to be mostly tangled in 
IEEE papers. If the college permits such endeavours, them as sure that 
there is enough work to be done for another 3-4 years just from the 
existing pile of work to be done. Almost every famous project has half a 
dozen things which new contributors can take up and try it out. There 
are lots of people in this list itself who are someway or other 
associated with FOSS projects and would be able to provide the needed 
feed to much on for a season or two. I know we are tired of asking them 
to start early, learn the art and the tool, have some plan by the start 
of the season so they have more clue of what to do during the season.

I still remember students who I happen to meet somewhere during the last 
few days of the year (read December end) when they had 30 days or so 
left and weren't even having a working Linux distribution running at 
their boxes. There were some who wanted to do Qt based interface but 
didn't even have the inclination to go through the Qt tutorials, which 
were the fact are very good for starters. I hope things have improved 
since then, but I don't expect it to have completely changed.

Even though Ubuntu doesn't contribute development wise, they have an
important contribution - a large user base who can serve as testers. I
myself am not much knowledgeable with how Linux works, but have reported two
gnome usability bugs which were reported upstream and were fixed. In recent
years, Canonical's role in popularizing Linux is not insignificant. I feel
that it is as important a contribution as submitting patches.

The following list of OSS projects could be useful for students to learn and  implement the technologies for real-life situations.

http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/  (For Storage/Remote Backups)

BackupPC is a high-performance, enterprise-grade system for backing up Linux, WinXX and MacOSX PCs and laptops to a server's disk.

http://cult-thinclient.sf.net (For Network Computing)

Cult is an Open Source software-only network bootable thinclient Operating System that provides a complete solution for thin clients, PCs or virtualized hardware

http://www.gnokii.org/ (For Mobile Communication)

gnokii provides tools and a user space driver for use with mobile phones under various operating systems (most testing is done under Linux but also Solaris, *BSD family and MS Windows families are known to work).

http://beagleboard.org/ (For Embedded Systems)

Beagle Board is an ultra-low cost, high performance, low power OMAP3 based platform designed by BeagleBoard.org community members for embedded development


And finally, I have downloaded Fedora-9 Everything Source Repository (more than 6000+ software packages) as Source RPMS, and if  students were interested in getting this, pl write to 

opensource@vsnl.net

Doesn't this article itself simply put things straight. Ubuntu has
been around for 4 years *only* now as compared to the oldies like
Gentoo and Debian or for that matter RH. And already the upstream
kernel contributions is increasing and am sure will soon catch up with
the other distros. Also, one must understand lots of kernel devels
work in Redhat and Novell. for. E.g Alan Cox was with RH and Greg
himself works for Novell. So one can expect many "commits" from these
folks.

Also quite a lot of Ubuntu devels are also Debian Developers and there
"could" me a few commits that is a part of the patch sent from Debian.
I am not still sure about the numbers and quite surprised with the
Gentoo figure.

Well, I guess Canonical is on the right path. But one argument I agree
completely is Canonical is being run by Mark Shuttleworth, but the
better side of it is it has got a big community now and with its ever
increasing User base, there is no necessity to fear the worse.

And LP will be Open Source in a year from now with the Road map
already in place.
http://popey.com/Launchpad_to_go_Open_Source_by_next_OSCon

To conclude, I think the views will change in a couple of years from
now as Ubuntu matures (not that it is immature now) and they are a
couple of years older than what they are today.

Cheers!

I have  couple things need to cleared is the moodle project is alive still
?? since i could'nt see, much activity on moodle group. They are not very
active in their IRC channel and even in their in forum their is no much
activity in their forums.

I remember that their is somebody working on the moodle form the NRCFOSS at

The presentation above compare the distros against their upstream 
contributions for the period of last years and not for the lifetime of 
the company or project which would show a different set of metrics. Also 
the presentation isn't limited to just the kernel but the "core" 
components or what is called as Linux plumbing which includes GCC, Xorg 
etc. The video was more interesting to me.

If you have gone through the other posts and articles related to this as 
well, you would have understood the bug picture and other side of the 
story. For the record, Greg himself works for Novell and has been 
involved in Linux Kernel team as a contributor to Drivers for several 
years. Also the article is more a targeted knife against Canonical, who 
is the sponsor behind Ubuntu. The general thought which has grown from 
his talk was that he considered only the Linux Kernel as contribution to 
Linux and never considered contribution to other components to a working 
GNU/Linux distribution like the Desktop Environment such as GNOME/KDE to 
be a contribution towards GNU/Linux. Hence his notion of contribution 
itself was pretty short focused.

The points made against were with number of patches submitted by Ubuntu 
Kernel Team towards the Upstream Linus' Team. But, Ubuntu is more about 
giving an user friendly Desktop GNU/linux Operating System and hence a 
major part of its work has gone into this area than the Kernel, which is 
already provided by the very talented men (and women) lead by Linus. 
Ubuntu has indeed stepped up the momentum of Desktop  Linux with the 
release of Dapper Drake almost  2 years ago. It's not nice to forget the 
contribution of Ubuntu by taking Desktop Linux to the homes of thousands 
and thousands, with the fact that its Kernel contribution has been very 
minimal.

On the other side, Ubuntu has almost grown out to be a community run 
project, with Canonical most sponsoring the resources required by the 
community to manage the project. One main valid point available against 
Ubuntu and accepted by the Ubuntu community as well will be the 
non-Openness of Launchpad. But that day is not long away as Mark himself 
has hinted at various instances that Launchpad will soon be made Free 
and Open Source too. With time, we should see more people in the Ubuntu 
community turning up as contributors to Linux Kernel too. With every 
release, Ubuntu is becoming better and striving to solve bug #1.

There are many suggestions from our members regarding the students

Interested members among us can form a team, and decide upon the

Also, the details given by our members can be updated in the chennai lug

A lot has already been written about "Canonical's contributions or
lack thereof" and I don't think I want to add to this.

However, your question could also be seen as: "Should I switch from
Ubuntu?"

The choice of distribution should not be made lightly but it is far
from permanent. At the same time, installing a new distribution every
few weeks or even months is not my idea of fun. So having chosen your
distribution work on it and with the community for a while. Make a
contribution which feels like a milestone has been achieved. You can
then re-examine your decision in the light of experience.

Regards,

Kapil.

By which I meant "personal experience" of course.

Free software has one big freedom to offer (like science), that of
making your _own_ choices.

In the final analysis, doesn't matter what Linus Torvalds or Greg K-H
or RMS says or recommends. The decision can be, should be and _is_
your own.

Suppose Linus Torvalds started using MacOS tomorrow --- would
you switch?

P. S. Even Newton, Faraday and Einstein were wrong at times!

Hi all,
 I made an attempt at making a GNU/Linux primer at

http://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/2008/09/28/gnulinux-primer/

To put it simply, just something which tells newbies what it is all
about without getting technical.

What do you guys think? Do you think I may have missed something? Do
you think something could have been put up in a better way?

Or you think it plain sucks. Feedback and flames all are encouraged :)

The car analogy is useful for the USA where most people drive a car
I am not sure it works elsewhere as well.

I don't know what a really appropriate analogy is. Perhaps
food/recipes/restaurants or books/libraries/publishers.

Kapil.

Subject: [Ilugc] Fonts missing while using bullets in abiword
Message-ID: <511f47f50809280847v2c6f22a5of8efe00197274c20@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
 I am using Abiword. Abiword 2.6.4-4ubuntu2  to be exact.

 This is the following procedure one does to get a bullet list in Abiword.

>From the "function bar" (dunno if that is the correct title) go to
Format > Bullets and Numbering>

In Type choose Bullet from the drop-down box.

In  Style you get various options of the bullets

While few are easily seen, like Bullet, dashed, Implies, Tick and Hand
the few other styles are missing.

I get numbers there instead (for example Heart has the number 03A3 and
things like that)

Most probably it might be some fonts I have not installed or something
silly like that but I do not what to search or where to search.

Also installing lots of fonts to find/have few or couple of fonts is
bad idea, I hope you guys agree.

Any ideas where or what to look for, any signs?

I used to use a simple household analogy - "We buy rava from the shop 
and we can make a lot of things using it, for example upma or kesari. 
The shopkeeper or the manufacturer of the rava doesn't inflict any 
restriction on what to do with the rava. Think of a situation if he does 
so, saying what you can do with the rava and what you can't do. To make 
thing worse, think if he says that you can not share the upma or kesari 
you make with your neighbours and friends. This might sound very stupid 
but the same exists with software as well." But the problem with this 
analogy is that you have to also bring down a justifiable relation 
between the role rava plays in your life with the role a software plays 
with your life. Actually you can live without rava in this world but not 
without software. In fact software impacts our lives more seriously than 
what rice or wheat or rava can do. Software, in this modern world, 
controls our bank accounts, controls medical equipments which save our 
lives, it is present in everything we use from calculator, to mobile 
phone, to television, to refrigerator, to automobiles, to security 
systems, and the list goes. Thus, who controls software we use has more 
importance. Rather how much we control the software we use is important.

** I developer this analogy based on numerous times I heard Raman 
speaking on this topic. Perhaps the later half is a bit revised version 
of what he tells usually ;)

I have a confession to make: I have shamelessly used linux since 1995 and have 
never contributed a patch to the kernel. Even worse, I dont know C. So, 
boycott me. Hate me. Kick me. Ban me. But whatever you do - I will continue 
to use linux.

In the time of Olympics, linux was slapped by NBC with silverlight. None
of the distros have any workaround, but Ubuntu forums gave a partial
workaround
(http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=5574835&postcount=54). I think
this is a great contribution towards linux, rather than committing a
patch to Kernel. This whole troll from novell shows how much novell
feared about ubuntu.

While on the topic of Einstein's mistake am intrigued by the following
statement by Prof C.K Raju :
"On my "epistemic test", Einstein's conceptual mistake is proof that
he copied from Poincare".

 More can be found at ckraju.net. Am not a mathematician and do not

us! Assuming he has the time and inclination :-)

WHatever the case, his book 'Cultural Foundations of Mathematics

the question is this:

1. Ubuntu has patched the kernel, the patch is available in their repositories 
under GPL and there is nothing to prevent the maintainers of the kernel from 
pulling in the patches

or

2. Ubuntu has patched the kernel and has not made the patches available

or 

3. Ubuntu has only made around a 100 patches to the kernel which they have 
contributed upstream.

if 1 or 3 are the case, there is no room for criticism. If 2 is the case, then 
they are bad guys. You cannot insist on a distro patching more of the kernel 
than they need. So even if I release my own distro - I can assure you that I 
will not be patching the kernel, and no one can fault me for this.

Ubuntu install is six easy steps. It gave the chance of Live CD for
some one who is scared  that trying GNU/ Linux distros will crash
their Hard disks

Ubuntu comes with one GUI and doesn't confuse a new bie with all that
is available.

It is a success from a user's perspective and that is all it intend to do.

no distro has in its objective, clearly stated that the OS should be
made available to people in their own language.

etc., etc., etc.,

and its for human beings ;-)

[From Ubuntu Forums, on a similar question about finding Ubuntu specific 
patches]

You can indeed get the kernel patches, by grabbing the source to the
linux kernel. So if you want the kernel source to a 686-based kernel,
you would type:

sudo apt-get source linux-image-2.6.8.1-3-686.

This Downloads the source, configs, and patches. The patches can be
found in the debian/patches subdirectory of the kernel source directory
that gets created upon download.

Indeed all Ubuntu specific patches are available with the Ubuntu Kernel 
source in the repository and apt-get'able.

The number of patches contributed by Ubuntu Kernel Team to upstream is 
less and it has been accepted. I also heard from one of the Ubuntu 
Kernel guys that the patches we do are very less and what Ubuntu Kernel 
differs from the Linus' is the availability of binary drivers not found 
in the latter (obviously) in the restricted section. I do not have too 
much gyan on this, but happen to read this in the response mdz made for 
Greg's presentation.

Moodle uses a data directory that is generally not within the document
directory of the web server. In linux it is /var/data/moodle generally.
You can always know what your existing data directory is, and also
change it by editing the configuration file which can be found in the
moodle directory.

Yes there is not much activity in the IRC channel. But there are enough

I consult for multiple clients who use moodle, and I don't think moodle

sure others like me who can help you in this list.

I don't think what web server or OS you use should make any difference at all.
I am more interested in the technology and how things work than what
tools you prefer. As long as your webserver can run php and mysql it is
perfectly fine. 

As I mentioned earlier there is data directory that is generally outside the
document root and it is good that you are aware of it.
Now the next step of action will be to make that data directory
accessible to the web server. That is the web server should have read and
write permissions to that specific folder. After you make the necessary
changes to the permissions if there are still issues, kindly post again.

I understand that many colleges are asking / allowing the students to
project in the college itself.
Of course, many students have their own systems and tend to work from them.

Some of the issues :
a) installation of the distro and the relevant additional packages.
    -- while it is desirable to let the students do it themselves, a helping
hand / guidance could be useful
        if the immediate goal is to get the project going.
       [as Parthan pointed out, the last minute rush will be there.]

b) official letters / certificates : colleges generally need that from the
guiding agency
    (for project acceptance, attendance
    and completion)
    LinuXpert Systems, Linus Academy and other "established setups" could
issue one.
    NRCFOSS could provide the platform for unattached mentors (if they
desire it).

c) While the students are enthusiastic, there may be some resistance at the
college level for FOSS projects. Even in one FOSS enabled college, some
students were discouraged. We could do something about it -- using official
/ personal channels.

d) Publicity helps. Can we have a list of "successfully completed" FOSS
student projects.
    NRCFOSS, of course, has a vested interest in publicising this list. An
official letter could also be written to all the principals / HoDs
highlighting the availability of FOSS projects and the support offered by
ILUG-C.

e) Evaluation Certificate / Prize
    I have refrained (for various opeational reasons --as I see them) from
proposing Prizes for student projects at NRCFOSS. But ILUG-C can announce a
schema. NRCFOSS (and/or others) could provide the funds.

There can also be issues like monitoring the students regularly, helping
them with bandwidths for heavy downloads, etc.

We have to be realise that students might not respond with the same
enthusiasm / effort / basic knowledge.
option 1 : offer project ideas, mentor services to everyone who is regularly
responding (with work or more queries !!),. be prepared that a sizeable
number will drop out.

option 2 : use some criterion (more on commitment than on "top of the class"
variety) to identify  student groups, attach atleast one LUG member as
godfather (any godmother??) and get things going.

I am not very good at history --- even when the history is of
mathematics. So I cannot judge the value of remarks about who
invented calculus.

There is no doubt that every "great" scientist has stood on the
shoulders of others.

The one big flaw in most Indian schools has been the inability to
criticise and be skeptical about one's teachers.

The one big flaw in most Western schools has been their obsession with
obtaining priority.

I would rather combine the best of both schools rather than the worst!
So one should go beyond what one's teachers (real or virtual) taught
us but give credit to their teachings for one's ideas.

Kapil.

Hello,

I saw the following post about BOSS:

 <http://appaji.livejournal.com/57904.html>

The GPL and similar licenses do allow you to copy and use as you see
fit so I would not be in a position to deny that freedom.

However, plagiarism smells bad... Looks like someone did not want to
work on the documentation --- at least in English.

The following way of presenting the FAQ would have been satisfactory.

  The BOSS team have been working hard at the localisation of Debian
  software so it can be used in Indian languages. As a result we have
  not had enough time to work on this FAQ. However, since BOSS is
  derived from Debian most of the FAQ for that distribution applies
  equally well to BOSS and so we reproduce it here.

Regards,

Kapil.

Friends.

We have to do something.

I am seeing a lot of students wont find their turbo C, winamp,
photoshop, and .NET in
their laptop.

They simply wipe the hard disk and go for windows.

There is no userguide or manual.

The video tutorial in tamil and english is not compitable with KDE.
They search the things in KDE.

and finaly go to their pirated os.

It is our responsible to do something.
We have to arrange for a seminar and publicity it.

A userguide may be helpful.

How to start?

It is a wonderful opportunity.
We should not waste it.

Banshee, Amarok can be some thing similar to WinAmp
Mono is an implementation of .NET in UNIX
Probably editor like Anjuta can be installed by default and distributed ?

Hi !

I had pointed this out earlier and definitely not a good sign for Linux community.

I suggest that we open a forum for Ubuntu users as applied to Elcot laptop and collectively support it.

If can not be done in Ilugc web site , I am prepared to spare some web space and host it.

        What is the point of having testers when the benefit is not
 passed on upstream to benefit everyone? That is the critical point in
 Greg's talk. Ubuntu efforts benefit Ubuntu. They are not close source,
 but unlike the rest of the free software world, they make no effort to
 feed any changes back upstream.

        The way things work with changes are that if you make changes,
 you pass them to the upstream developer, using their preferred means of
 communication: that mean you use their mailing lists, their bug
 tracking system, rebasing the changes to hteir release, and not mixing
 in your own rebrancding changes or changes upstream made that you
 cherry picked into one giant diff kept behind a locked door in the
 basement with the words "Beware of the leopard" on the locked door.

On behalf of the organizers,
Free Software Users Group- Bangalore
cordially invites you to

The National Public Meeting on Software Patents
====================================


==Venue==

2nd Floor, Ecumenical Resource Centre,
United Theological College,
Millers Road, Benson Town.
(Behind Cantonment Railway Station)
Bangalore?560046

==Time==

10:00?17:00
Saturday, October 4, 2008



Software patents in India occupy a contentious and indeterminate legal
space. While recent amendments to the Patent Act have sought to bring
our law in conformity with WTO-mandated standards, these amendments have
shied from pronouncing conclusively on the patentability of software.
The result is an equivocation in the law which is being wrestled
aggressively and effectively by corporate interests, patent attorneys
and the Patent Office in favour of granting software patents.  Unheard,
and so unrepresented in this powerful triad are the interests of
millions of citizen-consumers who are either presumed too ignorant to be
credited with a view on the issue, or are presumed to be irrelevant to
the determination of issues which are seen as purely "business" matters
(as opposed to "citizen" matters).

Software is everywhere you look (and many places you never think
of looking). With the explosion of low-cost computing devices (think
mobile phones and iPods), software has leaked out of its traditional
home?the PC?and begun infiltrating various aspects of our lives. From
traffic signals to toilet commodes in some countries, refrigerators to
railway tickets, vacuum cleaners and electronic voting machines, TVs,
refrigerators and electronic pacemakers, inanimate objects of all sizes
are humming to themselves, chattering amongst themselves in an
intricate, highly complex tongue called 'software' that few of us can
ever hope to understand. On the impulses of software, we stop or move on
streets, fill up on petrol, and elect governments. Someone's heart
beats. Someone else receives land records on a village kiosk. Someone is
standing by helplessly for fourteen years (the un-evergreened term of a
patent) because software failed to factor in her disability.

There are big stakes involved in the control of software in an era
when software is becoming increasingly central to the way we humans
organize our lives and inhabit a democracy. At one level this is about
preserving the right of agency and self-direction that citizens have in
their own lives.  At another, it is about the right not to be silenced
when our long-fought democratic republic is at risk of being diminished
by a few lines of software in a machine. Whether or not we are all in
fact capable of deciphering software is inessential. Those of us who are
ought not to be denied the freedom to interrogate, tinker and improve.

Patents have the effect of adding an additional layer of 'protection'
to already existing copyright protection of software, while
simultaneously overriding the various affordances and safeguards built
into copyright law. For instance, the right of "fair dealing" under
copyright law permits users to examine and modify any software in order
to make it interoperable with other software. This is an extremely
potent right that reasserts our right to intervene in the shaping of our
surroundings. It is also one of the rights that is most imperiled by
software patents.

The present "public hearing" on software patents is an invitation
for dialogue on the various issue surrounding software patents.
Although the Patent Office had scheduled a public consultation on its
Draft Patent Manual to be held in Bangalore in August this year, that
meeting was abruptly cancelled (or postponed indefinitely, or to an
unannounced date?we can't be sure) without any reasons having been
assigned by the Patent Office.  This signals either of two unpleasant
scenarios: first, the Patent Office is proceeding with its consultations
in an extremely mechanical fashion, not intending inputs received in the
course of these consultations to qualitatively impact their functioning
in any way; or secondly, perhaps the Patent Office underestimates the
amount that citizens living in the IT capital of India might have to say
on the subject of software patents.

It is our attempt in this public hearing to organize the kind of
consultation that the Indian Patent Office ought to have conducted. We
hope also hereby, to serve as a gentle but firm reminder to the Patent
Office that its task is as yet undone.

Have you contributed to Ubuntu? or aware of the development/bug-reporting
process in Ubuntu?
If not, then let me summarize for you : It clearly says that a bug found in
upstream can either be fixed by the developer or be passed upstream - and i
personally have done this and also know that along with me thousand others
do the same.

This is an unfortunate situation in the FOSS world - consolidation and
cooperation is something that the FOSS world lacks - attacking different
schools of development should be refrained from and the best teachings of
all schools should be nurtured(as what Kapil referred to) and cultivated. I
am waiting for a true-next-generation OS that would be a mix(+advanced) of
the present OS'es and give it for free.

A similar behaviour oft seen is the attack on M$ : lets learn from them and
also assimilate the best of it in our thought process. M$ rocks for various
other reasons and we should truly appreciate(if not respect) them.

This is one of the examples of not giving credit to others for their
contributions and think Ubuntu did everything in one day. LiveCDs were
out many years before Ubuntu even started. Knoppix and many other live
CDs were popular. One of the biggest reasons for Ubuntu is the
availability of Free CDs, at least in India and many of the countries
were broadband is not widely available.

I agree Ubuntu has done good contributions to the community and not
belittling their efforts, but I would recommend it only when they
start recognising and crediting work done by other communities and
play by the same rules of the community. Like pushing changes
upstream, developing tools with Free Software community ... One of the
most prominent examples of Ubuntu's behaviour is with respect to
translations. Ubuntu forks translations and any improvement made to it
are available only to Ubuntu. What every distro does is push changes
upstream so that every one in the community benefits as opposed to
Ubuntu's - take it if you want, we don't care about the rest -
attitude.

I really think that should not be "or" but "and". Isn't it the
responsibility of a maintainer to ensure that, for the greater good of
the greater number, they should always forward the patch upstream?

I don't think this is the right question to ask Manoj who contributes
(a lot) to Debian which _is_ upstream for various packages in Ubuntu.

Why wait? Start writing it! :-)

To get to your other points. There should be honest criticism of all
FOSS activities --- this could include expressing animosity where it
is heartfelt.[1] That is what the "O" stands for.

Trolling is the only really pointless activity!

Regards,

Kapil.

[1] Alternatively, one could use various techniques to reduce one's
blood pressure so that one's heart doesn't feel the animosity! :-)

Umm.. If you can get hold of a dozen or two of them, or able to get a 
list of people who bought them, then ask them to come for a LUG meet or 
arrange one special LUG meet for this purpose and enlighten them, show 
them what all options they have and how to use them. Even if 10 people 
turn up, it's worth an effort.

This is a good idea.

We should also approach ELCOT to see if they are interested in
starting some support channels:

 * a mailing list
 * an IRC channel
 * a wiki

Alternatively, if there are people who are willing to put in the work
without intervention from ELCOT then they can start such channels.

Kapil.

There is "wget" for which you can specify byte ranges (the server
must support it).

LOL. Am sure you haven't done enough homework to know about the one 
you're throwing that question at. To let you know of the fact, Manoj 
contributes to Ubuntu's upstream named Debian and hence not only Ubuntu 
but a lot of other distributions which are fed by Debian makes use of 
his contribution.

Yes, but what we do in launchpad is we mark an upstream bug to our bug 
so that we can keep in track of upstream improvements on that bug. This 
doesn't ensure that when a patch is submitted in LP, it is 
auto-forwarded to the upstream bug tracker (From what I know about bugs 
and LP). It needs manual effort in filing the same patch to upstream as 
well and following it up. A few people do this and what Debian guys here 
mean is more people should come forward and do this, which is absolutely 
agreeable. There is also a new feature in LP that helps us to monitor 
bugs which has some relation with upstream, mostly something which needs 
to be reported upstream and followed up. A very few triagers have 
started doing this and it will become more helpful if the downstream 
patches are also filed upstream.

We have always welcomed the criticisms from Debian and that's something 
which has been always poking Ubuntu to improve. May be someday we will 
satisfy them enough :)

Is the installation of Ubuntu on the ELCOT laptop generic enough that
the users will _not_ get fobbed off with:

 your installation is hosed/too non-standard for us to help

The groups that you are listed are for Ubuntu specifically.

However, if the answer is "yes" then the best thing one can do is:

 - to point the ELCOT laptop users to these channels
 - ensure that someone who is sympathetic to their needs is present
   in these support channels

Kapil.

There is already a registered #ilugchennai channel in irc.freenode.net 
that none of us use these days. If you people want to use it, feel free

for GUI mode in KDE, you could try "kget"

I find it very useful.

Surely, if they're ready to use it or suggest using it then the Ubuntu 
Indian Team and especially its Forum members would be delighted to help 
people. Let me know if the decisions is "yes" on that :)

Who negated this? 'passed' is not 'automatic' but something done by the
triager.

By the way, came to know abt a probable bug which destroys the
hardware/firmware in Intrepid Alpha - source/cause identified?

        Ouch.

        Not directly, no. But Ubuntu has indeed taken some 40+ of my
 packages (and without make-kpkg and make, they would not be able to
 build their distribution, so perhaps I have contributed a little bit).

> or aware of the development/bug-reporting process in Ubuntu?

        Not really.  The point is, I should not have to -- fixes to my
 code ought to being fed back to me (ucf, kernel-package, etc) -- jut
 like I feed back changes to my upstream using _their_ preferred means
 of communications -- that means I use their mailing lists, I use their
 bug tracking systems, and I separate and rebase changes to their latest
 release.

        And why is it that the changes are not reaching me, then?

        Well, Debian was trying to be the "Universal" operating system
 too.

        I guess we are too far apart in this issue for there to be hope
 of a reasonable dialog.

Controversy is not only with bn_IN. It is also with ta_IN. Already Dr
Vasudavan is doing lot of Tamil translation for GNOME. Now CDAC is
trying to do that on their own by spending our money and the sad part
is, it never go back to the GNOME Repo :(

CDAC not released the Good Indian language fonts in FOSS License. So
those fonts can not be part of the any FOSS distro.

Looks like CDAC needs only the community developed source code and
(our tax)  money. It never wants to work with Community.

Thanks for your response, Professor.

I was going through a math forum where Prof Raju had posted a
requirement for research assistant in history of maths. In that there
was a response from someone from Israel who also claimed there were
references to infinite series (Taylor's I think) in hebrew texts as
early as 13th century AD.

After reading Raju's book I think there is truth in his theory that
Greece is the fountain of all of modern science (and all of
civilization) is a fraud committed by the westerners. It is
unbelievable that while Greece was discovering all these great ideas,
the rest of the world - India, Arabia, China - which were older than
the Greek civilization by a few thousand years were completely
idealess.

It is sad that our present political parties are little interested in
supporting research in these issues - issues which can truly
re-establish our glory - than on issues like the existence of Ram et
al a lakh and fifty thousand years ago, that he built a bridge across
Sethu etc!!!

While reading Raju's book I was particularly pleased at his debunking
the SAS postulate and its siblings :-) When these things were taught
at school we all used to wonder why such obvious statements have to be
enshrined as a great, fundamental truths on which all of maths has to
stand. Its nice to know even learned men think so :-)

Another interesting  excerpt for that book (am paraphrasing):

When the greek philosophers came up with the theorem that states that
the sum of two sides of a triangle is always greater than the third
side, the epicureans, who always were derisive of the greeks, retorted
that even an ass knows that - place some hay at a distance from the
ass, it will always walk straight to it. It wont go to another point
and turn some degrees to go to the hay :-)

Which I think was meticulously erased by the westerners so that Greece
can be looked upon as the one giant on whose shoulders all others
stood!

Yes. The following is also very intriguing.

Hi

You must reinstall GRUB, the bootloader on the MBR after installing
Windows. Try using Google to find help.

shred -- Overwrite/Delete a file securely.

Summary:

Overwrite the specified file repeatedly and remove, in order to make
it harder for even very expensive hardware probing to recover the
data.

Example:

$ shred file -- Repeatedly overwrite the file content with random data.

$ shred -v file -- Show progress info.

$ shred -n 5 file -- Overwrite 5 times instead of the default is 25.

$ shred -x file -- Use exact size. Don't round of.

$ shred -z file -- At the end of shred, overwrite the file with zeros.

$ shred -u file -- Overwrite, Truncate and Remove the file.
