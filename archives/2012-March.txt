get started sessions by the three developers. You can participate in
teams of maximum size 4. Each team has to choose only one project.
Team registration will be done during the getting started sessions.

After the getting started sessions, a list of interesting bugs and
features will be put up. You can choose from the given list or choose
your own bugs to fix. You will have time till the next day morning to
work on it. The developers will be present all throughout the day to
help you in hacking the code.

On the second day morning, the teams will be given a chance to present
their hacks. The top three hacks will be chosen and the respective
teams will be awarded prizes.

Dear rajesh,

PCI PRI card  TE110 you will get from some china vendors for less than 100
$,Digium card will cost you more than 400 $.

When you need to expand ,one options is buy some second hand small
configuration PBX and integrate with asterisk server,then you have both
analog phones and IP phones.

Thanks and regards,

Hi,

Airtel & Reliance are best on PRI services. You need to get a
Sangoma/Digium card to connect the PRI to Asterisk/FreeSWITCH server.

Instead of using physical IP phones, softphones can be used.

With regard to configuration, read through, experiment and understand it.
That is what will help for your organization.

The fee structure comes around 25,000 per semester..  In my opinion, this
is too high..  I doubt, whether this would be affordable to many..

also only first semester syllabus is given..  syllabus for other semesters
are NOT provided yet..

Subject: [Ilugc] eidete - a nice screencaster for gnu/linux
Message-ID: <CAND27944_EHv5uaLfTegFZRbQ=_aR12ZJaaGbPOK4epOW8VgTw@mail.gmail.com>

Found a nice screencasting application for ubuntu - eidete

Though the gnome 3 has its inbuilt screen recording app using
crtl+alt+shift+r
it can record only video, not the audio.

I was looking for a decent screenrecorder with voice.

gtk-recordmydesktop is good. But, we have to configure the parameters to
get video without any scattering effects.

Tried eidete. It is so good. Video is stored as webm format. video/audio
quality is fine.

Check more about it here:
https://launchpad.net/eidete
http://www.ubuntubuzz.com/2012/01/record-your-screen-activity-with-eidete.html

Recorded a sample screencast - "intro to gnome 3" in Tamil.
check it here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5h1-YgoJI

Now, you can create screencasts easily with Eidete.

pri card or else i need to go for a separate line.

HI all,
I have been closely watching the syllabus and course details of anna 
university. In this new course.. I think only the first semeter has new 
topics. rest of them are taken from the MCA and MSC course syllabus. 
Though course seems to be demanding Univerisity has no idea about how to 
go after the first semester.I was happy to hear about the course but 
become sad when I looked at the fees tab. I feel there is no difference 
when you compare the price with a commercial institiute course fee..

Subject: [Ilugc] How to access internal memory of Nokia X6 phone at block
	level ?
Message-ID: <CAND2796r5OS6W0_NdCyXdiZMbu1UpWx+ZmiEhYiRuKMX229q+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I deleted a file from a Nokia X6 phone.
That file was in the internal memory of the phone.

We can recover the deleted files from the memory cards using the methods told in
http://goinggnu.wordpress.com/2008/02/14/recover-deleted-files-from-memory-card/

I connected the phone in ubuntu laptop using the usb cable.
It has 15G inbuilt SD storage and some phone memory.

It is showing only the 15G mass storage when connected to computer.

I found a way to access the internal memory.
here it is.
http://www.siltala.net/2007/07/25/mounting-a-nokia-phone-a-little-bit-easier/

It uses obexftp tools to access it. So, I can able to see the existing
files in the memory.
The internal memory is mounted as a fuse folder.

So, can not implement 'dd' command to that folder.

I have to access the internal memory at block level.

Please share some suggestions to do so.

Thanks.

Does NRC-FOSS has any role in framing the syllabus?  If NOT, then who
exactly is framing the syllabus?

GPLv3 is compatible with Apachev2.

no - although it is a good practice to license an app you develop with
the same license as the parent app, you are free to do what you want.

there is a laptop with a fresh install of F 16. On a system crash due to

Guess fedora 16 has not done a fsck (file system check) after power
failure. It happens in many distros - fedora some time did not do a fsck
after hard reset saw this behavior in fedora 10 (and afterwards in Ubuntu
and mint also). Try to do a file system check with a live CD or force file
system check after reboot (there is some method which I forgot please
google for it). Try to save the file again and share the result.

Or try to insert a pendrive and try to see if you can save that file over
there.

Check this list

   - mod_rewrite enabled in the Apache conf file
   - AllowOverride enabled in the Apache conf or vhosts file (so that
   .htaccess rules can apply)
   - The .htaccess filename specified in the Apache conf file
   - An .htaccess file in the root of the Drupal directory (may be hidden
   on some filesystems, but should be there)
   - Rewrite instructions in .htaccess (distributed with Drupal, but
   sometimes needing tweaking)

To test your settings, run
apache2ctl -t

apache2ctl restart

Thanks. I was looking only httpd.conf and apache2.conf

Setting 'AllowOverride All' in /etc/sites-available/default fixed it.

Trixbox provides a better integration/UI for management of the VoIP

You should talk to the service provider for compatibility of your
existing lines with the PRI card you are planning.   Assuming your
existing service is a simple POTS line, it will not be compatible with
the PRI card.

 mode   Set the operating mode of the device, which depends on the
network topology. The mode can be Ad-Hoc  (network  com?
              posed  of  only  one  cell  and  without Access Point),
Managed (node connects to a network composed of many Access
              Points, with roaming), Master (the node is the
synchronisation master or acts as an Access  Point),  Repeater  (the
              node forwards packets between other wireless nodes),
Secondary (the node acts as a backup master/repeater), Monitor
              (the node is not associated with any cell and passively
monitor all packets on the frequency) or Auto.
              Example :
                   iwconfig eth0 mode Managed
                   iwconfig eth0 mode Ad-Hoc

</quote from iwconfig man page>

Try "Ad-Hoc"   i.s.o ad-hoc

hi All,

I have been sending out a weekly newsletter on Hindu festivals / culture.

All these days used to do it through a gmail account.
However the number of subscribers has grown to 1000+.
So, gmail restricts the number of mails I can send out at a time.

I am looking for a solution where:
. I can send mails with my own domain name (parampara.in)
. Be able to send mails without restrictions

It would be good to have:
. auto subscribe / unsubscribe option
. archiving

I suppose I can install mailman on our site.
Any other options ?

Thanks,
hari.

If you want to stick to Google, use Google Groups. You'll probably have
to get Google Apps to have the email come from your domain.

Mailman may be easier.

Yeah I can understand. ;)

A la a mailing list eh?

That seems to be the solution. You knew the answer to begin with.

I have installed mailman once or twice but never played with it.

It is the de facto standard for mailing list software.

You could also put up your mails in a blog.

Best of luck.

linphone is sip compliant, it works great with asterisk based servers.

This is a Wikipedia/Wikimedia hackathon, where developers are invited
to come write cool hacks on top of the amazingly large amount of data
that the wikimedia projects (Wikipedia, Commons, Wiktionary,
Wikiquotes, Wikisource, etc.) expose in a huge variety of languages.

Hacks can be anything, from an Android app that gives you 'situation'
quotes from Wikiquote based on sentiment analysis of your text
messages, to an app that gives you wonderful images of the places you
are at using Commons, to beautiful visualizations with Wikipedia edit
histories, to automatic song/album information gathering from
Wikipedia, to amazing dictionary interfaces across languages using
Wiktionary, to anything else that you can dream up. We'll have a few
people who have experience with the various APIs/data available.

Note: This is not a MediaWiki hackathon - Patches/Extensions to
MediaWiki are most welcome, but you are by no means restricted to
that.

Mailman is more than enough for your needs. Try it out, will be pretty easy

Please search archives for this discussion that took place a while ago.

If your gateway does NAT, I presume you are using squid as a
transparent proxy. If the gateway does not NAT, then the clients
cannot reach the Internet except thro' a proxy server like squid via
an explicit proxy configuration in the browser. If this is the case,
shouid should be able to control access to these sites.

If NAT is enabled, then you'll need to redirect DNS requests to a
local DNS server which either denies access by dropping those
requests.

Hi,

You should use ACL in squid which will block the sites you required.

Please find the url link which brief the procedure.

edit /etc/hosts and add following in last line
127.0.0.1 <Website address you need to block.com>
This will redirect the requests to your machine which running the squid
proxy server, so user can't reach that website.

This is a clumsy and often unworkable solution. 

1. It has to be done on each individual client machine using the squid proxy.
2. It has to be constantly updated on each machine.
3. And every browser on said client machine must be configured NOT TO use the proxy for such banned domains.

Very clumsy. There has to be a more elegant way.

 Its not necessary to do it in individual machines if you block direct
access to DNS servers. Only in squid machine its enough to put this
configuration. In our college its successfully working now.

for secure connections (HTTPS), it is most likely that CONNECT tunnel is 
used. Did you check out the following page ?

http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/HTTPS#CONNECT_tunnel

Since, its a tunnel, you can probably restrict access only by denying 
domain names instead of urls and such. you should try the following and 
see if it works,

Dear ILUGC and Kaniyam members,

Today when i opened the Kaniyam site (http://www.kaniyam.com/) from
Google's Chrome browser, it said " Malware Detected " as the tile of the

the contents are:

I also noticed something weird. The site, while loading, redirected to some
other url and then to google home page. But there was nothing in the

Dear Friends,

Microsoft International President Jean Philippe Courtois met Tamil Nadu 
Chief Minister on the 6th March 2012 to discuss on improving (or so they 
say!) the education and IT sector of Tamil Nadu, and agreed to work 
together.

Press Release: 
http://www.tn.gov.in/seithi_veliyeedu/pr06Mar12/pr060312_184.pdf

Even as a neighbouring State like Kerala where 'Free Software' is being 
used as a medium to promote self-sufficiency and initiative in learning 
among students thus helping them gain an edge in the competitive world, 
the Tamil Nadu government in the name of'improving' the education system 
has decided to further the use of proprietary software. This will 
directly result in yet another generation of software students being 
subject to a mechanical system of education which will result in them 
becoming non-qualified workers in an industry that is entering to a 
phase of crisis. This is at a time when a study has said students from 
Tamil Nadu are the the least employable in India.

This current situation is where IT industries are keen on Arts & 
Sciences students than engineering students is a direct result of an 
education system where the engineers are 'taught' and 'trained' to be 
mere users of proprietary software rather than 'engineers'. Today, 
families are forced to spend lakhs of rupees in the dream of a high 
salary of children, out of which almost 40% of the money goes for 
licensing fees in colleges. Despite all this money spent, the student is 
unable to compete in the job market and forced to take extra courses to 
enter the job market by spending at least few ten thousands.

This decision made at the top is a direct challenge to all those who 
want to see the improvement to the situation in the education system of 
Tamil Nadu. When there is a conscious effort against the people's 
interest, it is up to us to take a stand and work for what we deserve ? 
an education system based on free software.

The first step is to spread awareness of the use and relevance of free 
software and the dangerous implications of such a move. We invite you to 
join us in this campaign and join hands against this development.

You need to mention name and channel, I use the following command,
# iwconfig eth1 mode ad-hoc essid "dark" channel 1

Here you see 'eth1' instead of 'wlan0' because I use broadcom's
proprietary driver called 'broadcom-sta' instead of 'b43' family. This
will create an access point called "dark" (set a good name please). If
no error occurs, then I need to connect to this access-point with the
same command I used to create the ad-hoc network, like below,

# iwconfig eth1 mode ad-hoc essid "dark" channel 1

If everything is ok, then I will see essid as "dark" in iwconfig output,

# iwconfig
eth1      IEEE 802.11abg  ESSID:"Dark"  
          Mode:Ad-Hoc  Frequency:2.412 GHz  Cell: BE:33:20:D7:30:A4   
          Tx-Power=200 dBm   
          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Encryption key:off
          Power Management:on
#

At this point, I'm connected at link-level, I need to configure this
eth1 in tcp-level to properly use the device, like below

# ifconfig eth1 up
# ifconfig eth1 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0

On another laptop which I want to connect, I need to do the following,
to establish peer-to-peer connection

# iwconfig wlan0 mode ad-hoc essid "Dark" channel 1
# ifconfig wlan0 up
# ifconfig wlan0 192.168.2.2 255.255.255.0

Thats it, both laptops can talk to each other. One point is, I don't use
any WAP encription here. So, the ad-hoc network which I established is
free to all, anyone can connect without password.

The boot message is not available here.

Subject: [Ilugc] extract sentences from a xml file in bash
Message-ID: <CAND2796ePX4ziWAeVmm+_S-NiVWnHjotsQPewPFx3=QEaLg3yA@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

I have a text file to extract content from.

The format is like below

title = Mr
name = shrini
phone = some number
email = email address
address = home address
city = chennai
state  = tamilnadu
country = india

The same block continues as multiple times in the file, but in records
are in different order.

I want to extract any two lines from the entire file. for example, I
want to get the
pair of name, phone or name, city or name,email address or name, state etc

How can we use the bash utilities to achieve this?

Thanks.

Hi,

    We have a plan to replace windows 2003 server by CentOS. This CentOS
will authenticate all other windows desktops using Samba PDC. Total users
are 30.

    As of now we have thinclients with Windows 2003 server. Before adopted
with this setup, we had checked using one thinclient. While testing, we
felt that it was ok. After place 15 thinclients by connecting with IBM
X3400 server , we started to realize slow issue. For example, if one user
opens a pdf file, it takes time. Due to this slow issue,we are planning to
replace all these thinclients by desktops. Then these desktops will be
installed by Windows OS. Then these windows desktops will be authenticated
by Samba PDC. Samba PDC configured in a desktop configurationCeleron 1.8
GHZ,512 MB RAM). This system will act as gateway and squid proxy also for
our network.IBM X3400 is 4 years old. So we are not able to decide to
continue with this server for further operations. Please suggest
configuration or server model for Samba PDC to authenticate 30 users.

    Thanks for your time.

Use Perl. I'm sure there's an ini parser on CPAN which will make this
trivial.

Is there a fixed set of 'fields' per record? If yes, the solution could be
a lot simpler and possibly done using awk or a combination of shell tools.
If not, try this perl "one liner":

sample input file:

$ cat file
name=ravi
phone=101
email=a at b.c
phone=011
email=c at b.a
name=vira
email=a at a.com
name=crap
email=s at s.com
name=supercrap

The solution (which I've formatted here for ease of readability):

$ cat file | perl -MYAML -ni -e '
BEGIN {
    @db = ();
    $rec = {};
    %keycounter = ();
    $next_rec_at = 1;
}
chomp;
($k, $v) = $_ =~ m/^(.*?)\s*=\s*(.*)/gms;
$kcount = ( defined $keycounter{$k} ? $keycounter{$k} : 0 );
if ($kcount >= $next_rec_at) {
    push(@db, $rec);
    $rec = {};
    $new_rec_at++;
}
$rec->{$k} = $v;
$keycounter{$k}++;

END {
push(@db, $rec);
print YAML::Dump(\@db); # ... or do your report generation here
}'

output:

- email: a at b.c
  name: ravi
  phone: 101
- email: c at b.a
  name: vira
  phone: 011
- email: a at a.com
  name: crap
- email: s at s.com
  name: supercrap

cheers,

Given this is a hardware raid controller, you probably noticed the disk
'showing up' on the raid controller utility menu just before the OS is
booted. correct?

Usually, with a hardware raid controller, you don't get to access to the
underlying disks*. You will instead see unified disk(s).

* unless you also have some kind of a specialized software (such as HP ACU
CLI) using which you can 'talk' to the raid controller to query various
things from it (such as the list of drives installed, their status, etc.,).
Some raid controllers do support 'direct disk' mode, but you have to check
with your RAID hardware's manual.

Messing with the World's DNS is a Bad Idea, IMHO. Keeping track of such
'blockings' you've done all over the place (at the DNS, proxy and firewall)
will eventually get tedious.

This is a purely windows related issue.

Can you please clarify your current x3400 config so we can possibly help better?

Message-ID: <CAAnpABRsbyCPrbc0q6bzGfe7GFpOyB2rhXwue5omaT+KrmkOug@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I run a machine with CentOS 5.5, GNOME version 2.16.1. When I log in, or
when I try to add new widgets like Clock, or WindowList to my GNOME panel
(by doing 'Add to Panel') . I get the below error message all over my
screen,

The panel encountered a problem while loading
"OAFIID:GNOME_WindowMenuApplet"

The panel encountered a problem while loading
"OAFIID:GNOME_WindowListApplet".

The panel encountered a problem while loading
"OAFIID:GNOME_WindowMenuApplet"

Each of the message in separate windows. Widgets like WindowListApplet are
critical to me, since without it, any minimized window just disappears and
I have no way of retrieving that window.

I googled around and tried the following,

$ pkill gnome-panel
$ gnome-panel &

deleted ~/.gconf/apps/ and allowed the panel to build itself from scratch
when I logged back in. but nothing seems to work. Please tell me your
suggestions.

Hi ILUGC,

     I guess it is time for ILUGC to start another campaign against
the TN govt. When the neighboring state of Kerala is doing so much
with Open Source, why is TN govt. falling into a trap with MS?  (Refer
yesterday's hindu:
http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/tamil-nadu/article2967682.ece)

     IMO, the last thing that we would want is for our state to fall
into a vendor lock-in with MS. I guess it would take a fraction of the
cost if we develop TN. govt. its own private cloud.

Anyway, I think we first need to tell TN govt. that what they are
doing is wrong. Any ideas on how to go about with this?

as a person with fair amount of experience with dealing with govt
officials in various states I can assure you that the argument that
'neighouring state is doing this so our state should do it' is the
surest way to ensure that it is not done. Each state thinks it is better
than the others and this argument just irritates the officials. Base
your arguments with reasons.

The normal way would be to approach ELCOT with the proposal.....but
having said that ......there is a lot of political and monetory
influence is connected with government in these activities ......but
still its no harm in taking this to ELCOT ...people are still educated
there ....will have ears to listen .....taking it from there to the
government to amend depends ministers who still thinks cloud computing
as computer to use at the time of rainy season as we use
umbrella....such is the knowledge of people in power.....still I would
suggest it as worth a try .....

I don't know much about the server hardware requirements. But IMO, you
can have the Desktops in this configuration:
CPU+Board: Intel Atom Desktop Kit - Rs. 3400
RAM - Hynix LapTop RAM 1 GB - Rs. 475
No Hard-Disk
Some Case ~ Rs.1000

We had a similar issue in my school, and we had to dispose of around
15 thin-clients. Now, we're using the above configuration (but with
HDDs). You can use PXE and reduce your cost.

What you have now is a sensible Infrastructure policy, just that the server
is out-dated (or perhaps you've not looked deeper). Moving to a
thick-client infrastructure is only externalizing the problem (perhaps, it
will also get solved since now nobody will depend on the network or the
centralized server). But, let's get this straight: You are moving to a
cost-wise, maintenance-wise and moving-parts wise a more complex and
"expensive" infrastructure (FYI: Hard disk prices have doubled in the past
6 months).

The problem you've described might be most likely related to computing /
disk bottle necks... but you may have to look into some hardware usage
statistics (does I/O top out when these folks are reading their "PDF"? ...
and maybe also, Are there "Viruses" on your Windows Server(TM)?).

Try and meditate over how you can best solve the current problems you're
facing in the existing thin-client based infrastructure. Its a matter of
identifying bottle necks and clearing them up. Once you've cleared them,
you've scaled and you've also learnt the recipe to scale (atleast some of
the ingredients in the journey thus far). Centralization is where the world
is moving to - because today, it is easy to do (really beautiful software
exist, virtualization is reality) and it makes a lot of sense in today's
world (with rising costs of materials and energy). It also makes common
sense because most end user PCs don't get used to its designed capacity
most of the time. They idle and waste away.

If you'd like to take to virtualization here is your chance :) I'd think
its still a hardware-wise / energy-wise cost effective thing to do to
consolidate. Think about it: The "Internet" is moving in that general
direction too (move stuff to a centralized place where it makes a lot more
sense to take good care of it in bulk). End user computing at an office
environment is no different, just that its all local. Thick clients Messy
and I guess there is also something very fundamentally wrong when people
hate the presence of the "System Administrator" at their "desktop PCs"
taking away their productive time. How simple would it be, if we just
rebooted? ;)

I'd say: Centralize, Measure, Forecast and Scale.

Hi All,

I am looking for geeks who can do simple coding/tech work for me. Most of
the work I need would involve simple html, image editing, researching on a
topic, gathering of data, analysis of data etc. The only pre requisite for
the job is common sense.

I used to work with couple of IIT Kanpur students. They used to write blogs
posts for me at Rs300/post. If anyone is interested please write back to me

IBM x3400 has configuration as below,

       Quad core intel xeon 2.33 GHZ, 2*6 MB L2 Cache (5410), 13336 MHZ
FSB, 4* 1GB PC2-5300 667 MHZ memory, 2*146 GB 15k rpm SAS HDD, RAID 1.

       Further we connected one IDE 160 GB HDD also. Because we do two
copies of data backup. One is in this internal HDD and another one is in
external storage.

       Hope desktop (Atom processor, 1 GB RAM,HDD, windows 7 starter) is
available for the cost of Rs.11000 approximately.If so, our plan is, buy 15
desktops. It will be increased as 30 step by step.Here not able to decide
about server whether its existing old server or new server. Hence for the
last four years, there is no issue with this IBM x3400 server.

       This server resource(CPU,RAM & virtual mem) usage is not exceeding
60% when all users use fully.

       Before we adopted with this thinclient concept, we had used
desktops. By considering centralization, we implemented
thinclients. Thinclients are fully comfortable except this slow issue which
we are not able to isolate. When its compared with desktops, thinclients
are very easy for us to manage. We are searching for clue to identify
bottle necks.

     Once again Thanks for your time.

       Mediawiki is a wiki software written in PHP. Depending you what
you need the wiki for, you have a great many of them to pick from. If
you want PHP based and intended use is documentation, dokuwiki is
useful. Also, if you are looking at a different language, say Python,
moinmoin is a
choice. This link[1] from Wikipedia might help. Thanks

If it has Linux installed, What does 'top' say (during peak usage)?

You may need to populate the other CPU socket and increase the RAM to
about 8GB at least (preferably 16GB)

and oh, what is your network infra? If possible upgrade it to Gigabit

Keep the Thin clients in one VLAN if possible.

Please make sure your device supports pen drives. This to make sure that
your device can run in USB host mode. If not then there is no way for it to
support data cards (at least to my knowledge).

Subject: [Ilugc] Please suggest Linux server
Message-ID: <CAJG1P0XUvbXXdTHKwNju3tO+YQWk+3b3e+buW0-sw-LZp8hCWg@mail.gmail.com>

This server has Windows 2003 server. By using task manager, I come to know
that 60% of resource is peak usage.

Option 1 : So planning to buy new server(IBM X3400 M3), install CentOS,
configure Samba PDC, remove thinclients, buy 15 desktops(Atom), install
Windows 7 starter in desktops and all these windows desktops will be
authenticated by Samba PDC.

Option 2 : Install CentOS in a high configuration desktop, configure Samba
PDC and authenticate all desktops.

I tried with second option for testing purpose. Here all data are being
stored in the system where Samba PDC configured. In this is the case, all
users will need to access the Samba PDC system to get the data time to
time. I think first and second options will create network traffic and
create slow issue again. Is it right?

Option 3 : Install CentOS in a high configuration desktop, configure Samba
PDC ,authenticate all desktops using Samba PDC. But data should not be in
Samba PDC system. Data need to be stored in local desktops itself. so
network traffic may reduce. Here server will be used for desktops' login
authentication only.Is it right?

This server issue is making me to think lot as I need to come out from
this. I thank everyone for your most valuable suggestions .

Message-ID: <4F5A4C9A.8010601@gmail.com>

Doing "git pull" on linux-next tree always shows "Performing inexact
rename detection" for a very long time (more than a hour and going). It
also uses more than 1.5GB of RAM (out of 2GB RAM) in my system. Not able
to do any thing when this is happening - even maximising a window takes
2 minutes once such a situation is reached. I am killing the command
with a Ctrl + C as I am not able to do any work.

What is the reason for this? What it does internally? Is there any way
to circumvent this? I don't want to clone linux-next again (that seems
to be the worst case solution).

Today's session by FSFTN at CS-24, IIT-Madras covered Ubuntu installation
and a portion of basic GNU/Linux concepts. Mr. Yashwant and Mr. Alagunambi
Welkin handled these topics and a large section of the participants were
from the industry. There were some college students too.

My initial apprehension that there weren't enough number of technical
experts to handle all the questions posed by the audience subsided very
soon. This was not only because the volunteers answered the  queries
effectively but also due to the mutual interaction between the members
present. There were notable instances where doubts were successfully
clarified amongst the audience in this manner. It reflected the community
spirit of GNU/Linux

I also realized that the opportunities to explore this operating system
were limitless. Mr. Yashwant and Mr. Welkin made this clear and encouraged
us to think in a variety of ways. They also stressed on the fact that we
could truly learn only when we explored and introduced us to interesting
techniques to pave the way.

I am eagerly looking forward to the next phase, next Sunday where we will
delve deeper into the Introduction to Linux

Hi,
*
*
     Computer Society is a student association of the *Madras Institute of
Technology* which was established in the year 1983. Initially it was set up
to promote computer knowledge among students from various branches of
engineering but it later became an active participant in the FOSS movement.

*      Carte Blanche <http://www.cb.csmit.org/>* is one such annual fest
conducted in our college in celebration of Free and Open Source Software.
Its one of the biggest Free software Fest. It aims at creating awareness
among young minds about the power of FOSS and also is a platform for FOSS
enthusiasts to share, discuss and discover new horizons. We are palnning to
host it on *24th and 25th of March 2012.*

      Each year, FOSS demo stalls are set up enthusiastically by students
and FOSS advocators alike. These demonstrations on the features of free
software have been an effective way of bringing about the much needed
recognition and appreciation for the FOSS community.

      Apart from these demos we also organize special events such as
lectures from experts, GNU/Linux quizzes, and other competitions on Web
designing, hacking, networking etc. In the prvious years we had audio
conference with *Richard Stallman, Father of Free Software.*

     This year too, the Carte Blanche?12 is being organized with the
undaunted spirit and enthusiasm. We hope to further our reach and help
spread the wisdom of Free and Open Source Software. In this respect, we
would be deeply gratified if your renowned organization could be a part of
our endeavor. We have*15+ events* in this time and have already confirmed
workshops on *"Add on Development" by Mozilla, "Exploring Wikipedia" by
Wikipedia and "Open Hardware - Arduino".*



    *Volunteers who are interested to put Demos on various Free Software
can mail tocb at csmit.org*

Hello everyone!

Me and SrikanthLogic are conducting a small Unofficial Wikimedia
Projects hackathon in Chennai on 17th March. You can find more details
and register for it here:
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Chennai_Hackathon_March_2012

Also, I'd request the community to add ideas here:
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Chennai_Hackathon_March_2012/Ideas. Note
that this hackathon is *not* a purely MediaWiki hackathon, and the aim
is to build hacks/tools/gadgets around the API/Content than mediawiki
extensions itself (Extensions/Patches to MW are welcome too, but not
the goal). So tools that make your life as an editor easier, tools
that make content discovery in multiple languages easier, tools that
help Wiki* spread, anything at all your mind can think of - please
post on the Ideas page.

Thanks!

Controlling the browser settings in all the users machine is not possible.

You have to set the transparent proxy.
i.e you have to route all the network traffic in your office to the
proxy server automatically.

Check the following links.

Good network security implementation should work regardless
of the desktop/browser settings.

If you configure your firewall to accept outgoing web traffic
only from your proxy server IP, then even if users change the
browser proxy configuration they cannot cannot bypass your
proxy and gain web access. Worst case is without the correct
proxy config users will not have web access.

Reinstall wordpress via the upgrade page. If that doesn't work you can
upload files via FTP too.
Mostly I have seen this happen when some file isn't unpacked properly while
upgrading.

Subject: [Ilugc] Android on X86 platforms
Message-ID: <CANc+2y7GBOkQQBtStAtCn1LCrmY1Spq4aeUzj2SyptWf00yLSA@mail.gmail.com>

There is an Android port for x86 hardware (Intel and AMD CPUs) at
http://android-x86.org/. Those who wanted to try Android but did not buy a
tablet or smartphone can try this in your PCs. I installed it along with my
Linux Mint and windows installation. I had some problems after installation
but the community is quite responsive. They provided answers to my queries
and now I am able to boot and use it from my hard disk. Only current issue
is ethernet support is not available in the CD provided (there are patches
that provide this support queued up in the git repository). If network
support comes I will be switching mostly to Android. Android ICS is
available for download now. Hope this helps some one :).

setting up the projector and necessary extension box for powering the
projector and laptops for use during the Workshop. Participants have
started to reach the place after all the arrangements were made.

*9:00 Am: *Mr. Suresh Kumar arrived at our place and we received him and
took him to the seminar hall and he started to connect his laptop to
projector to get started.

*9:30 Am:* On-spot registrations were done.

*10:00 Am**: *By this time everyone has arrived and we have started our
workshop. Initially it was a theory session where Mr. Suresh Kumar was
covering the Basics of Simulation and what is the use of NS-2. The session
went for about 4 hours with the mix of both theory and hands-on.

*1:30 Pm:* We took a break for a lunch and returned back at2:30 Pm

*2:30 Pm:* He covered the rest of the workshop agenda and waited for
queries and feedback from the attendees and clarified the queries of them
too.

*3:30 Pm:* We thanked Mr. Suresh Kumar for his useful session and at the

I am not a great fan of Java with its speed/security. And, not to 
mention Android being a google product. I think, I am going to stick 
with Linux on my x86 for a while. That is, until ARM hardware becomes 
readily available. Then its time for Linux on ARM :).

It's high time you stopped top posting and learnt to follow mailing
list guide lines.

Your iptables rule is not correct, you are destination/reverse NAT
which is not needed in your setup. My preferred method with iptables
it to default DROP packets on the FORWARD chain. This will
ensure only traffic you explicitly permit to pass through your system
will be allowed - you can permit outbound dns, ssh, smtp/pop, etc
for select source and destination IP ranges.

Knowledge of iptables working is essential to build a successful
security system. Suggest you read the iptables documentation
fully and test thoroughly before deploying.

Android was (and still is) primarily a phone/tablet touch
screen OS. Even if it can run on a PC, I can't understand
how usable it will be as a desktop OS.

Can you please share your Android PC experience for
everyday use? That is vs a traditional Linux/Windows OS.

Here are some high level steps. You'll need to consult relevant
documentation along the way.

Run Samba on your desktop. Configure it to join W2k8R2 domain. Consult
Samba docs for how you can add your samba server to an existing AD domain.

Once the server is added, your AD will show your Samba server as a new
Computer object.

Run Samba on your desktop. Configure it to join W2k8 R2 domain. Consult
Samba docs for how you can add your samba server to an existing AD domain.

You'll need to use "security = ADS" in your [global] smb.conf section and
also need domain administrator credentials for one time addition.

Once the Samba server is added in AD, new AD Computer object will be
created. This is exactly like adding any Windows desktop/server to AD.

You then need to ensure extended ACLs are enabled for the file system
which contains /ubshare. Use the "acl" option in fstab. Eg.

    /dev/sda2 /ubshare ext3 defaults,rw,acl 1 1

Recommended you install e2fsprogs so you get lsattr/chattr and other
utils which you can use to view/set extended ACLs on ext2/3/4 file systems.

In smb.conf [global] section, you'll need

    map acl inherit = yes
    nt acl support = yes

to enable extended ACLs globally. You can now set administrator users
for /ubshare so they can change ACL permissions for other users.

    [ubshare]

    admin users = @"DOMAIN\DomainAdministrator"

Once all this is done, need to connect to the share from any AD registered
Windows desktop and as the admin user above. From the Windows Explorer
file permissions dialog, you can set permissions in the same manner
you set permissions on native Windows shares.

If in doubt Google for "samba extended acl" and follow the examples. Official
documentation is sparse.

It's preferred to use native Samba utilities (winbind) to connect with AD.

There is an alternate LDAP and NSS which is outlined here:
http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Active_Directory_Authentication_using_LDAP

LDAP approach is better suited only if you want all AD users to be visible
to Unbutu natively - ie, users can login to the shell over ssh using their
AD credentials. The setup is more complex and involves a lot of moving
parts which are not needed for simple Samba ACL setup.

Best of luck!

Subject: [FSFTN] Richard Stallman on Linux Action Show
To: <mailinglist at fsftn.org>

Hello everybody,
                       I am a big fan of the Linux Action Show (
http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/linuxactionshow/) presented by
Chris Fisher and Bryan Lunduke. I really love the way they present the
latest developments in the linux world. For their 200th episode, they
invited Richard Stallman for a phone conference on the show. RMS created a
big storm by saying some controversial things (as is his usual style).

Please watch the latest episode at:
http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/17822/richard-stallman-gnulas-s20e10/
 and share your thoughts.

There are two ways to defenestrate a computer: Either throw windows out of
the computer or throw the computer out of the window - Richard Stallman

I always miss Linux applications when using Android but using Android for
browsing, entertainment etc may give a different (good) user experience.
The way the UI works looks good. Using a mouse does not make any difference
when compared to Linux (but keyboard seems a little different but people
can easily get used to it).

<forwarded email>

As everybody must have noticed Jupiter and Venus are very close to
each other. In the past few months Jupiter was positioned above Venus
in the night sky. But after today Jupiter will be seen below Venus.
The conjunction will occur tomorrow 15th March sometime after 6pm. At
conjunction both the planets will have same RA and hence the same hour
angle.
The next conjunction will occur on 28th May 2013 which wont be as
spectacular because the planets will set just an hour after the
sunset. So don't miss this chance!

Start Stellarium.

Press F6 for the location window. Select Chennai.

Press F3 and search for Venus. Venus is currently behind a tree.

Press F4 for viewing options. Go to the landscape tab and select Ocean
so that there are no trees anywhere.

Press F5 for day/time window. Adjust the date and time and you can see
the planets changing position.

When searching for Venus, the object is not available in stellarium.
even moon, earth also not available in search.

What may be the reason?

I installed stallarium and stellarium-data in my ubuntu 11.10

I installed it in my fedora 16 and all the above steps works fine but as
you said Venus was behind the tree and later when i searched for Jupiter
and Venus again the camera port is pointing downwards towards the earth,
which means it is at the other part of Earth, now how can i switch to other
part?

It means that Jupiter and Saturn has set. That is, the earth has rotated
and Jupiter/Venues has moved out of the celestial hemisphere over Chennai.
Instead of switching over to another location on earth, shift time to
tomorrow around 7:05 PM. Stellarium by default simulates the sky in real
time (current sky). But the time can be changed by pressing F5.

Arun

	- today
Message-ID: <CAND279507sdxOe_dEaacBsR4kEkkR+P6bTH6740qoGvHOD6KOg@mail.gmail.com>

Source: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTA3MDk

The Fedora Project is seeking your help to improve the GNOME Shell and
its extensions.

Happening on Thursday, 15 March, is a test-day surrounding the GNOME
Shell and its extensions for the GNOME 3.x desktop. The Fedora camp is
looking for people to try out the latest GNOME Shell and to then play
around with the many GNOME extensions.

Even if you're not an ardent Fedora user, it's recommended to
participate in their test days if you're interested in the project
being tested. Unlike other distributions, the Fedora / Red Hat
developers actively work towards pushing their changes back upstream,
etc.

The state of the Fedora packages being tested are also the very
latest. Updated Fedora 17 i686 / x86_64 images have been spun for this
GNOME Shell testing to make the process quick and easy for anyone to
get involved. This test day is similar to their well known Fedora
graphics test days. Fedora 17 is using the GNOME 3.4 packages as their
default desktop experience.

For those interested or to learn more information, visit this Fedora
Project Wiki page.
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2012-03-15_Gnome_Shell_and_Extensions

Meanwhile, next week is the deadline for features to be 100% complete
for the feature-rich Fedora 17. The beta of Fedora 17 "Beefy Miracle"
is expected to come early next month as an appetizer while the final
release is on the menu for May.

With openoffice I have faced such situations. The only solution I got working is to remove files in .openoffice directory of the user - look for files which save state information like recovery.xxx etc.

Before getting to terrace, i used Stellarium in fedora 16 and located the
position and direction on the sky, took screenshots and then only went to
terrace and saw it. Stellarium is very good tool and yes it is awesome.. I
should recommend this for those who have interest sky science and
constellation art is beautiful work in it.

I am not sure the RHEL is having the drivers for the modern data cards.

It is not advised to run RHEL in the desktops as we will loss all the
fun stuff that gnu/linux gives
like office, multimedia, internet connectivity, latest software etc.

Migrate to fedora or ubuntu or any latest distro.

Take vanilla kernel from kernel.org and compile it or download a fedora
kernel (rpm package) with header package and install it. Then to connect
using network manager. If older network manager does not work correctly use
wvdial it should do.

	FOSS
Message-ID: <CAMjrZe+ZQVvedaXwL9vTdaZfydbRXH0FDrRdRAe+jb8Y5e4fqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Ilugies,

I have planned to start the Computer training center as a* **Social
Service* for
school students and
others who would like to learn computer and of-course training will be
strictly focused on FOSS,
in a motive to develop *my** own rural village* *Salapalayam*, in Namakkal
Dist.

I talked with few student in my village, they are very interest to learn
computer more practically.
since they are not much exposed to computer in their schools, teachers only
concentrating only on their theoretical subject not on practical
understanding of computer. I would like to focus not only on computer but
also on various field of interest, initially, on computer.

Most of students are not affordable to own computer or getting training
available in any of commercial centers in
Namakkal town which is 6-8 Km far from village.
Students convenient time: After school hours and they can utilize the
summer holidays being in the village.
*Purely, as Service motive. It is not for business or something else you
may guess.*

You can also do this for your village if it is feasible. Develop every
village from root level in India,
I am damn sure we people can make *India 2020. As Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam*
 Quoted.

*Please NOTE below:*
So, i was looking to buy Used / Old computers about 10 numbers from my
friends circle, But i don't get good response from my friends circle.

And one of my friend suggested me that, Buy working condition Scraped
computer from some of IT companies who doing it regular basis at a cheap
rate/free.
I have not much idea of How to get scrapped computers? Who is doing it? Whom
to contact?

If anyone knows kindly do a favor, it will be helpful.

Reasonable configuration, P-4, 512RAM, Minimum 40GB HD.
My budget around 2-3 K for each PC(10 Numbers)

Hai guys,

Many of you must have heard about DuckDuckGo.com, a search engine which claims
it does not collect or share personal information.

DDG has a opensource community platform here: https://dukgo.com/base/welcome
where we can contribute translations collaboratively using their
simple user interface.

There are Hindi, Kannada and Telugu at the moment but not Tamil. I
requested them
to add Tamil and I request you to do the same so they'll add soon. As
soon as they add
Tamil, you can translate one English word at a time or you can vote up
on others' translations.

Thank you,
Vigneshwaran Raveendran

http://pyvideo.org/pages/about  says that

This is a video index of Python-related video on the Internet. It does
not host video?it's an index.

Each video is lovingly packaged with a variety of metadata that
comprises the context of the video: When was it taken? What was the

Nice initiative to get all the python videos in a single place.

Most games which have an openGL rendering mode usually work quite well on
Linux under Wine.

The most common game that I play is counter-strike, which works flawlessly
over LAN on Ubuntu.

Then I sometimes play indie Games from the Humble Bundle, and all of the
Humble Bundle games have a linux version so They work natively.

Now for most people thats all the games they play, and they should be fine

Please consider using Fedora instead of RHEL 5. RHEL 5 is pretty
old and do not have all the software needed for setting up your

You can download a copy of Fedora from https://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora

Hi LUGC users,

Is some one using Tikona for ISP ?  Recently they have changed the way they
give me IP.  Instead of giving me a public IP now they have started giving
me private IP in 10.0.0.0/8 space.

One way it is safe that my IP does not get exposed to scanning.  However I
cannot access my SSH server on my system any more :-(

I believe someone mentioned about pagekite last month which might be 
useful here,

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2012-February/070113.html

This is how you create a SSH tunnel through pagekite,

https://pagekite.net/wiki/Howto/SshOverPageKite/

I think its free for the first 2.5 GB data transfer,

https://pagekite.net/support/faq/billing/#bandwidth

You will notice high latencies but it should be manageable, I would 
think. I haven't been able to try it yet, so please do share your 
experiences.

I believe the real utility lies in using it to test your Android
applications. The emulator is terribly slow in comparison, and if you
make the mistake of closing it then you have to wait half a million
years before it starts up again.

You can copy the generated .apk to the application folder (I don't remember
the exact location but googling will help). Then you can run the app
without any troubles. If the machine does not have Intel VT support then go
with this method (my Core 2 Duo machine don't have Intel VT support). If
Intel VT support is there then Android x86 with qemu will be like breeze.
This will accelerate your development efforts. Qemu emulating ARM on
systems is very slow (Intel VT will help in x86 guests only) so this must
be a good use case.

Thanks to the OP. I will check this out. I really need this. I just got
stuck with the emulator crying with an OpenGL application. The Android
emulator which comes with the SDK runs a software renderer under an ARM
emulator.

I have also thought about this; in my opinion, the key is a group of
enthusiastic people who just want to join and discuss something they
know, or are learning or working on, which is related to free software
and Linux. A good document which details on some points is:

All the best!

You will have a software renderer in case of x86 emulator also (as qemu
does not have 3D acceleration yet). But the software renderer in x86
emulator will be **lot** faster compared to software renderer in ARM
emulator (if you have Intel VT support). If /dev/kvm is present then your
x86 emulator will work smoothly.

Hope This Helps.

Thanks. What I'm looking for is not a malware detector.  I was looking for
ways to find out if my "ISP's DNS servers have been poisoned"..

Oh well. The thing is that the focus of GNU/Linux is slightly
different. Just like Windows would never have 80% of the super
computers running on it, GNU/Linux would possibly never be the best
gaming system.

However, we do play a few games over the LAN on a lazy Saturday
evening in our lab.

1. Enemy Territory: From the brilliant Wolfenstein series. There is so
   much more to do than just point, click and frag. You have to build
   bridges, rescue people, handle logistics and supply ammo (Each
   avtar you take has a different goal). Brilliant, and FOSS [1]
   
2. Assault Cube: Want a frag-respawn-refrag FPS? This can do it. You
   have death-matches, capture the flag, Team matches etc. Fun to
   play, but I am not too much of an FPS fan.

3. Eat The Whistle: Want to play that soccer game from your 8-bit
   console again, here you go.

4. We also play Dopewars and Poker (pokerth) if we feel like it. 

5. A nice one player if you have a small enough keyboard is Frets on
   Fire. Try it. 

If you aren't looking at only Libre software, you could also try Live
For Speed, Counter Strike, Commandos: BEL etc on Wine

Note: One or more of the following may be there in Ubuntu by
default. I am not going to give you tips about Non-free games, though.

I guess the python script is going to attempt to connect to a know public
site which is pagekite, then I guess there is a reverse connection which is
going to get established.  People are going to come into the system using
the reverse ssh.

$ ssh -R 1000:localhost:22 user at somepublicserver.com

Really appreciate your answer :-) however I won't trust my security with
some other system.

hi :
glad to know about your interest.
you could contact Mr. Suthan <83sutha at gmail.com>
[Attn.: Suthan, I presume you are still around that parts. You could
share your thoughts, wisdom and experience.]

you could also check with colleges in the vicinity -- I am sure
Bhaskar would have set up FOSS Labs in some of them. He may have the
names of the FOSS experts/enthusiasts over there. Some of us also
could pitch in with info/contacts.

The college contacts might give you a place for holding meetings/
sessions / workshops.
If you think there in interest in school level, please share the info.

with best wishes
Srinivasan

I remember using `namebench` to find a fast DNS server when the Airtel
servers were (predictably) being terribly slow. If you're looking for a
way to do what you want, that's a good place to start. It's unlikely
that _every_ DNS server (and there are many) that `namebench` has in
`/etc/namebench/hostname_reference.cfg` has been attacked so they're
likely to return different addresses.

There's the usual caveat that one domain can still point to multiple
addresses but you can probably still exhaust all the alternatives by
trying them enough times.

Of course if you are even worried that your ISP's DNS servers have been
poisoned just switch to using Google Public DNS or something and avoid
the problem. Having those attacked in a way that allows someone to lose
something is likely to cause such a huge fuss that you'll definitely
notice.

To: mailinglist at fsftn.org




An enthusiastic crowd gathered on Sunday at IIT-M , CS-32 to attend the
secound part of the Intro to Intro to GNU/Linux series organized by FSFTN.
Some participants were present last Sunday too.  They were joined by a new
batch of students from College of Engineering, Guindy.  The session was
handled by Mr. Alagunambi Welkin and Mr. Pratheesh Prakash

The first part of the session was a hands-on approach to shell scripting.
Mr. Welkin introduced us to the basic concepts and let us explore.  We
enjoyed modifying the comments and coming across a variety of errors.  We
experimented further, under Mr. Welkin's guidance and were comfortable with
the basics of shell scripting.  Materials used for this session can be
downloaded from :
http://www.fsftn.org/old/downloads

Mr. Pratheesh Prakash gave an overview of how to install softwares by
compiling from source.  He mentioned the various reasons for using this
method to install softwares such as unavailability of softwares in
repository, to use the latest version and for fun.  The hands-on for this
activity is to be held next Sunday

After this, there was a discussion of GLUG activities by students of
Pratyusha Engineering College and College of Engineering, Guindy,.  The
participants came up with a plan of action which they intend to implement
this week

Next week, we will delve deeper into GNU/ Linux.  The journey has been
enjoyable till now and I look forward to the next session

"/tmp/".$_FILES["file"]["name"]);

[1] /tmp folder working. I have uploaded saving files in /tmp location

[2] But I have changed /tmp to /home/user/uploads folder not uploaded

[3] I am using same permission /tmp and /home/user/uploads

root at server:~# php --version

today I met a Chennai fine arts college student.

font creation is one of their activities. but they not know about the
unicode and other font related stuff.

is there any document on how to create unicode Tamil fonts and how to fix
any issues on existing fonts?

they are creating only English fonts.
if we guide them well, they can create more Tamil unicode fonts.

please write in English on this list so that most of the members can
understand.

Indic fonts are very difficult to create. I have worked with Mr.Murali
Krishna, an expert font developer. I used to write dongle protected
keyboard drivers for his commercial fonts. Please ask the student to get in
touch with me off-list. I can introduce them to him. He is THE authority
for pro grade south Indian fonts.

Creating Indic fonts are a mix of Artistry, Carpentry (in the sense of
joins) and Technology. Tamil is relatively easy. Other south Indian fonts
require incredible number of joins to realise the entire character set.
Then comes the concept of `kerning` which requires language skills too.

On an [OT] note, it's incredible that he was honored with doctorate in
Singapore and Sri Lanka for his contribution to tamil computing. Wonderful,
he was not even invited to our great world Tamil conference :)

Arun

Nope. Highly unlikely. His primary business is fonts. Piracy is killing his
business. Releasing a few fonts for Linux will only be a philanthropic move
for him. Linux is irrelevant to him till DTP operators, News houses and
Television channels moves to Linux. I had convinced him 2 years back to
release a small bunch of high quality fonts for the Linux. He had agreed,
but I did not follow up on that.

But he sure will help someone who wants to make fonts for Linux non
commercially.

Commercial Note [Sorry for the non - free nature of this, just wanted to
help someone who might be interested]:
For anybody interested - he was seriously impressed when I told him you
could make a Linux distribution for DTP operators with the fonts packaged
along with it. The catch is - the fonts need to be protected from copying.
If anybody has got a solution, he will be willing to pay handsomely.

Regards,
Arun

Not possible to have 2 passwords for a same account. Passwords will be
encrypted and stored in /etc/shadow file in Linux. You can see the
encrypted password there.

Hope This Helps,

Multiple users with root privilege can exists in a system. However there will be only one user name 'root'. It is not 'root' that determines the privileges , but it is the uid in /etc/passwd that determines. You can have multiple users with root privilege by doing following steps

1. Copy the line containing root user information in /etc/passwd into a new line and change the name 'root' some thing else say 'root1'.
2. Copy the line containing root in /etc/shadow into a new line and change name 'root' into 'root1'

3.Now you can login as root1 and get all root privileges. You can change password for this user.

I believe, what you are looking for is sudo. Check out the following 
manual pages,

man sudo
man sudoers

See EXAMPLES section to get a quick idea. As the name goes, if 
authorized, any user can gain superuser privileges through sudo. So, in 
effect, two or more users can login as root using their own passwords.

gThumb is a nice image management software.

When we see an image, we can enhance the colours easily.

But, we have to click a image, then have to click the button for
enhancing the colours.

Is there any way to automate the process for clicking all the images
in the gthumb collection and apply 'enhance colours' option for all
the images?

Unix admin tradition is to call this account as "toor" - root backwards.

A better solution to the OP's problem is sudo as mentioned by others.

A small suggestion, insted of implementing one for VoIP and another for IM
etc., I would suggest you to use Elastix which is a combination of all the
things you are looking for.

This solution should work best for OP. Also password less ssh with
different password phrase
for different machines is something you can consider(although it does not
exactly match your
description).

I am feeling naughty. So I will comment on your signature.

There are multiple ways to learn.

Apparently it is said in the Vedas that there are 4 chief ways.

Talking to people, learning from books, experience and one more which I dunno.

Anyway today's TN is reeling under power deficit and this is caused not only
 due to power planning but also not involving engineers and technical thinking.

Technology is extremely essential for society and engineers can make a
huge difference.

And both these will work only thro' knowledge.

How to acquire knowledge?

We first learn thro' books, Internet, whatever.

Then we have to learn how to apply the knowledge by trying ourselves.
Then with experience
the knowledge gets firmly implanted in our brain.

We will have the power to share our knowledge with other people only
after we have
 gained knowledge through experience. And there is no better example
than programming.

And knowledge is not always secular knowledge. Real knowledge is obtained
 through meditation.

So all of you should spend at least half an hour a day meditating. It
will immensely help
 your personality.

PyQt with Qt Designer would be a good choice as well. wxPython and PyQt 
are GUI frameworks, so expect to have a learning curve if there is no 
prior experience.

A bit tangential to your query but if a non-GUI/CLI version is
available for use and functional, it would be a nice idea to package
it and make available via the repositories.

On March 17, there was a wikipedia hackathon at ThoughtWorks, Chennai.

I participated that event.

There was around 20 programmers joined together to work on building some
interesting applications using wikipedia.

We picked up the ideas form the link.
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Chennai_Hackathon_March_2012/Ideas

I picked up an idea of creating an application to record audio for adding
voices to the tamil wiktionary site.

Example: http://ta.wiktionary.org/wiki/tiny

In this page, there is an audio file on how to spell the word 'tiny'

Not all the words in the tamil wiktionary has the audio files.
It has around 2 lakh words.
It is a boring process to record a word, upload to
commons.wikipedia.organd link back to
ta.wiktionary.org page.

I wrote an application to make this process easier. It will show you a
word, record it and upload it to commons.

get the source code at
https://github.com/tshrinivasan/voice-recorder-for-tawictionary

see a demo screencast on the application here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a5Iv_ol1So

There are some 13 applications developed and all participants showed their
demo on the same day.
Thanks for yuvipanda and srikanth for organising a nice event.

Subject: [SFD-discuss] Celebrate Free Culture with us on May 19th 2012
To: "SFD announcements" <sfd-announce at sf-day.org>, "Open discussions about
SFD" <sfd-discuss at sf-day.org>

Dear all,

It is with great pleasure that we are announcing a new celebration in
the lines of Software Freedom Day focusing on Free Culture. Over the
years SFD gradually promoted Free Culture next to Software Freedom and
we believe it is now time to have a specific event for Free Culture.

Why is that so you may ask?

We feel for starter that the audience and participants are quite a
different audience from the people interested in software. In fact
artists from the Free Culture movement often use proprietary software
for plenty of reasons and wouldn't feel compelled to participate in SFD
(or event know about it). Then the format should probably be different.
While SFD tries to showcase Free Software and explains all the great
things you could do with it, a day to celebrate Free Culture should
definitely showcase Free Culture work, that is:
- exhibitions
- concerts
- movie projections
- surely more

What we have envisioned is a day where all the Free Culture artists
around the world could walk in the street and play, act or showcase
their work and explain to people what Free Culture is and why they have
chosen to contribute to the movement. Of course there could also be some
amount of discussions and debates, but we should definitely stay away
from long presentations and make it a real festival where the general
public would come and simply enjoy the show while learning about those
artists.

The side idea is also to give free culture artists one international day
where they can unite and make themselves heard all together. We are
seeing way too many attacks on culture these days with copyright
extensions and abuse of consumer rights of fair use, or lobbyists trying
to lock away public funded work for example.

So 2012 will be the first year and we will start contacting various Free
Culture supporting organizations to get their support. In the meantime
we have launched the Culture Freedom Day website at
http://www.culturefreedomday.org and hopefully should have the
registration and the wiki up and running fairly soon.

So if you have any connections with Free Culture Artists, Art schools or
universities, art galleries, pubs that organize live music, restaurant
which do photo/painting exhibitions maybe you should talk to them to see
how they feel about organizing a CFD event.

Discussion about CFD will be happening on the CFD forum at
http://www.culturefreedomday.org/forum and we also have an IRC channel
on Freenode @ #cfday for the geeks among us.

So thank you all to spread the word, 'identi.cate', twit, blog and tell
your family and friends!


-----------
Digital Freedom International (newly renamed to encompass our new
activities)

PS: and SFD will still happen on September 15th 2012!

Message-ID: <CAJLBBzybAv4XACfKAfsrPuk7SfjOkf115Urw0=HjmQSTWUiWxg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am involved in some  emulation application.

I am looking for virtualization software (hypervisor - hardware & software
emulation) in linux. To emulate 50 nodes(customized linux kernel + my
network application).

I understand that hypervisor is hardware arch specific.  So i will be using
intel arch (x86 based arch - latest dual core processor. ).
I thinking of using xen.
I have two queries.
1) Any other alternate for xen which has very small footprint?
2) Is it possible to emulate 50 nodes in latest x86 based desktop/server?

Thanks
suresh.

50 nodes? That is one too many.

Calculate at the rate of 128MB per instance.

I always use qemu.

I am also having a dual core intel processor. Does your processor support
Intel VT? If yes it is better to assume 256 MB per instance and 15% CPU
usage per instance (average use case). Then you can calculate the number of
nodes you wish to use.

Can you clarify , how did u get this number 128MB  per instance?
I though probably less than 32MB per instance. (Customized kernel - 2MB and
some scripts, and routing application (may be 10MB). So total img size
would be less than 15MB. while executing Memory food print can be less than
32MB(kernel space + user space).  This is my assumption. Please correct me
i am wrong.

thanks
suresh.

man qemu

Also I don't like xen at all. ;)

You must be right. You can run with 32MB RAM as well.

But I am curious why you wish to run 50 instances?

I am a very powerful qemu user but I am yet to come across such
 a strange need.

Can you throw some light?

Something like this.. with light weight.

Why you dont like xen? some technical reason? Also qmenu is emulating other
hardware arch correct?

I don't understand. Does it say many nodes?

What is your application? What do you plan to achieve?

Anyway best of luck.

That is right. Qemu is emulator, not a hypervisor.

But that is what I want. Moreover I use OpenBSD and Xen is not yet ported to it.

Xen is not fit for my needs. You can use it if you like.

I develop my product using qemu. All my networking appliances are
developed using qemu.

I install OS on external USB hard disks using qemu. I test liveCDs and
my own product's ISO
 image using qemu. I love it.

Hi ILUGC members,

I have written a shell script to find out what type of file is the file I am searching for. If the resultant file name doesnt have any gap (like /path/name/Bharath_file.txt) I get the result correctly. But if the file has a gap (like /path/name/Bharath Kumar Letter.pdf) I get simply "ERROR". Is there any bug ?? Please help me resolve the bug please ??

This is my code snippet : 

#!/bin/bash
echo -e "Input the file that you want to search: c"
read input 
find ~ -name ${input}
echo -e "Input the file that you want: c" // Comments : I will copy the file with the full name that I want
                                           //to find out what type of file it is 
read input1
file ${input1}| cut -d: -f 2

Not sure what you are trying to achieve here. If you know the path to
the file and also the extension to find the type, what is the need of
using 'find' command?

You should enclose the file name in quotes.

Windows users usually give whitespaces in the filenames/directories.
You might want to rename your files, directories so the whitespaces
are replaced with underscore (_) or dot (.). Refer (for a start):

  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2709458/bash-script-to-replace-spaces-in-file-names

In *nix, filename extensions don't really matter, except for few
applications which use them. Please don't name filenames with
whitespaces.

Hi All,

Does linux support the co-existence of IPv4 & IPv6 hosts?

I mean, Does linux have some inbuild mechanism to support the IPv4 and IPv6
co-exists (such as 6to4 translation, Tunneling etc). Also if you point out
some good tutorial on this topic, it will be helpful for me.

Thanks
suresh.

Thanks. Yes. it emulates the netowrk nodes. The end application is network
emulator. similar to the neptune.

Any one can help me on this topic. Still i am struck with xen.
I have read on some technical paper,  single core processor with 4GB can
support 3-4 guest os in xen. Is this correct? any one tried? if i use, some
12 core/16 core processor (I guess, some high end servers are available
with 32 core), i think 50 emulation is possible.
Any suggestions?

Thanks
suresh.

Also, the inline commenting method is wrong. In bash, you use # for commenting.

you can use the following bit and operate on $file_name

export file_name=`echo $input1 | tr ' ' _ `
$ echo $file_name
Untitled_Document_1

you can add more checks to know if it is file is a  directory or file and
process appropriately

Determining the file type using the extension is the *wrong*. This is what
windows does - when an executable file has a folder like icon (in windows)
people will try to open it thinking they have created it and the virus file
executes - a trap. Anyway people struck up with Windows need to care for it.

Why don't you use "file" command instead of finding the extension? The
"file" command returns the MIME type of the file.

If the file is an mp3 file it says "Audio file with ID3 version 2.3.0,
contains: MPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 160 kbps, 44.1 kHz, JntStereo".
Similarly for other type of files. If by chance you rename the mp3 file
with a .pdf extension or some thing else the "file" utility will provide
the correct type. "file" utility reads magic header in the file to
determine its type (not based on extension).

You may need to use extension only when the file is of type "ASCII English
text" - it may be a C or MATLAB program or any thing that is created with a
text editor (since all C files are text files).

Hope this helps.

You don't need any complication to simulate network emulation.

Just use 100 aliases and you have a complex network with 100 nodes.

Are you doing some silly college project or is it real life?

I get the feeling it is the former.

As many have replied to you there are many things you have to learn.

But you have made a good beginning.

Keep going.

Some general observations:

1) Your shell scripting style is not typical. Learn from others and improve.

2) Even the file command is not always accurate.

3) Learn to look at return values of commands in the $? variable

4) You can escape spaces and other metacharacters in many ways. I normally
 do a single pass rename of all files using mmv or even mv.

Example.

$ mmv -v "* *" '#1_#2'

Read mmv man page.

Yes UML may be a good choice. Also why can't you chroot and run processes?
I did not understand the use case but just a thought.

Elastix comes with GPLV2 so there is no restriction. You can play.......
Only if you need support from them you need to pay.

Message-ID: <CA+1bt6T0p6JeSkZfzFNxjwLuTO_-xHa8bkXpEnDFYP2Mm=CsAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, one of my VM is running CentOS-5.8. Most of the time, it's load avg.
is high. It has 4 gigs memory and Xeon 3.48 GHz single processor.

I am not sure, why this "exact" VM is showing high load all the time. Same
softwares with same configuration ( 4 gigs memory + even 2.66 GHz single
processor ) are not throwing such high load averages.

I searched processes which are running, those are necessary so I can't kill
them actually ( and moreover, these processes are running in other VMs too
).

Load Average is most of the time > 1.5

Any suggestion?

Hi,

Pl clarify the below points.

1. Pl mention the ESX version.
2. CentOS is 64bit?

Pl check the following options are enabled in the ESX where your Centos VM
resides.

1. Hyperthreading option is enabled in the ESX server. Check in the BIOS or
in the Vcenter select that particular esx and go to summary page. The HT
option should be active. If not enable the HT option in BIOS.

2. Pl check any reservation for cpu is allocated to some other VM, which in
turn cause the slow to other vm.

3. Select the CentOS VM, go to edit settings & go to resources. In Adv.cpu
HT core sharing mode should be "Any"


Thanks,

Thanks a lot. But the issue is: I don't have access to ESX host. Is there
any benchmarking tool that I can use in terminal as sudo user to check if
that CPU which is showing here is "dedicated" to my service?

Nope. Atleast you should have access to Vcenter. So that you can use tools
to check for benchmarking.

AFAIK you don't need Virtual Memory in embedded devices and hence you don't
need the swap as well.

   - From a design perspective, the design team will know how much RAM is
   required for a purpose built embedded device. This amount of RAM would have
   been provisioned physically.
   - For a general purpose device, we can safely assume permanent storage
   would typically be on board flash or memory cards. Any flash based
   permanent storage has a fixed `life` or write cycles after which it is
   likely to fail. Continuous use of swap file will reduce the effective life
   of the device.

Swap memory is concerned with paging.

You have virtual memory in embedded system.

Paging is part of Virtual Memory. Page tables maintain the mapping between
the Virtual Memory and the Physical Memory.

Embedded systems generally dont have Virtual Memory because the access
times are non deterministic.

In general, very few embedded systems really need deterministic operation.
Irrespective of virtual memory support, none of the run-of-the-mill
embedded linux systems are deterministic anyways. The 'hard-realtime'
embedded systems will surely not depend on virtual memory and will have
adequate RAM provisioned.

Arun

Don't applications/processes on embedded system have their own dedicated 
address space ? I would think having dedicated address space requires 
virtual memory management.

Embedded Linux. Linux needs virtual memory support with some exception like
uClinux.
Infact Virtual Address Space would be a better word than Virtual memory.

"non deterministic" is CS lingo for unpredictable. Assume you are accessing
a memory address, if it's in physical RAM you can read/write it in a few nano
seconds. But if the kernel has moved this page to swap it takes
several milliseconds
to access the page and the response time of your application suffers.

Unix kernels offer the ability for user land processes to lock memory pages in
physical RAM and ensure they are never paged out to swap. This syscall requires
root privilege and apps like cdrecord use it to lock its buffers in
physical RAM.
See mlock(2) and friends.

To the OP:
Memory management unit of an ARM core is typically 30% of die area, eliminating
the MMU will therefore reduce cost. Simpler 8/16bit microcontrollers do not have
any MMU and use only physical memory addressing throughout. Sacrificing the
convenience of a virtual addressing is one of the trade-offs an
embedded programmer
has to live with. Since embedded environments are carefully controlled and runs
no 3rd party applications it may not be a hard choice. See uclinux.org.

On the opposite end, ARM Cortex A15 cores have added a lot of features so they
can be used in servers. Eg. LPAE to support 1TB RAM, hardware
virtualization, etc.

One correction - Disabling kernel swap support is not just for embedded systems,
I'm pretty certain you can configure any Linux kernel (x86/ppc/etc)
without support
for swap. It's in the kernel menuconfig options.

The reason why it could be non deterministic is because there could be
interrupts trig erred by virtual memory systems during I/O
which could cause jitters in accessing and hence its not rest assured that
you get the same look up time for the access.

This thread is full of theoretical stuff, lot of useful info but
nowadays I only deal with practical reality.

That is the single biggest problem with the people I meet here in LUG.

You have to get practical doubts.

Theory is fine but we have to grow beyond that.

I have worked on few embedded systems but swap has never been a doubt
in my mind.

As Raja said MMU is the issue. Without MMU there is no memory
management, no paging
 and so no swap.

Even desktops can work without swap with adequate RAM.

This is No Theory, I am not understanding what you mean by practical
reality.
Can you explain the difference? How far is it from practical?

Please stop
1. presenting your opinions as facts, and
2. judging others so harshly


I must thank the OP for bringing up this question because
after posting my earlier response I wanted to understand
this in more detail and found this gem:

http://www.embeddedinsights.com/channels/2010/07/21/to-mmu-or-not-to-mmu/

The healthy debate in the comments contain as much
information as the article itself.


This article also highlights another important point - that
there are often opposing views to any topic. MMU/no-MMU or
theory/practice or vi/emacs, etc. What I have learnt from
my experience is not to be so convinced and blinded by
my own belief that I disrespect or disregard the other.
This has helped me listen to the pros and cons of both
perspectives and use the most appropriate one for any
given situation.

if we say it, it is theory. If he says it, it is practical.

Hi all,

We are happy to announce the results of Tamil Wiki Media Contest[1].

The competition was brutal.(Hence the mild delay in announcing
results)?Thousands of high quality files were uploaded for the
contest. In order to award prizes to maximum no of entries/contestants
as possible, we have increased the number of prizes. The files that
made it to the final round but didn't win ultimately were very very
close to those that actually won (in marks basis). Of those the top
100 can be viewed here[2]

A detailed report and blog post will be ready by next week. Thanks for
your support.

Message-ID: <CACm7z1ZfoEJUwEr7Jh1W7GgrOp8L964pJTL-DqrOymj3Civd_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear folks,

Recently got a chance to explore the Tamil Nadu's Free Laptop for students.
I had a chance to explore two different laptops.
It had BOSS Linux and Windows 7 starter edition as proposed.

When i logged in into BOSS in both the laptops, i found the Trackpad was
not not working / not detected in both of the laptops.
Then found that the Synaptics Touchpad dkms driver was missing, and
connected the laptops to internet and installed in it and then it worked
fine.

I hereby share this to you all, so that if you see any TN laptop with
Trackpad not working or not Detected in it under BOSS, please do share this
info and install the driver in it.

P.S:- In one of the above two laptops, Trackpad was not detected in Windows
too.

Made a post at our blog with link to download driver for it:-

     Based on the errors above, I am just guessing this would solve
the problem. Try dpkg-reconfigure on munin and oracle-xe.

Or, if you know the insserv mechanisms, edit the /etc/init.d scripts
for those two deamons. If that doesn't solve the problem, may be you
can paste the INIT INFO sections of those 2 files here. Someone would
be able to help. Thanks

Hi,

 Based on the errors above, I am just guessing this would solve

Thanks a lot.Because of info given by /you I just realized that I have
already uninstalled the oracle-xe and munin-node long ago. Removed the
oracle-xe and munin-node script from the /etc/init.d and everything is fine
now :) .

Thanks again.

Subject: [Ilugc] different network I/O handling methods
Message-ID: <CALDskyw9oRSzQoyayhjFhs9osounyg=ZLE785ybc86PQdPSomg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear LUG,

Been a long while since I initiated a mail to LUG.

I thought I will discuss different network I/O schemes or rather the
 way CPU and memory is used to perform what most of us do today.

Be it google search or facebook or mail or whatever this is what is key.

Right from publishing SSLC results to Deepavali mails to some event
 like earthquake jamming communications, the ability to scale with load
 and the load handling capability of servers is put to test.

I am an expert in server side gear. I have been doing this the last 10
years and
 more and starting from OpenBSD kernel, IPsec, routing to Apache to web
 development I have seen quite a bit of programming techniques.

It is a no brainer that if you want performance you write in C. You may know
Linus Torvald's comments on C++.

Okay I am not really concerned about programming language right now.

Only the high level design and coding will just follow.

Broadly put there are a few ways by which multi processing is done.

1) fork() based process creation(Apache pre forked model)

2) multi threading

3) event based I/O loop handling

You should read the paper by Ousterhout, the author of Tcl about why
threading is a bad idea and event loops are better.

This has been repeatedly demonstrated not only in my real life experience
 but also by the success of Twisted Python or nginx server.

Apache used only two approaches, 1.x pre forked model and 2.x threading.

nginx did better through event based I/O.

A lot of UNIX Programmers do not know about select(2).

It is the easiest way to handle multiple sockets, be it STDIN, TCP or UDP.

You could also use poll(2). Nowadays I just use poll.It is better than select.

You also have many methods to monitor file I/O. FreeBSD uses kqueue(2) and
 Linux has inotify and friends.

All UNICes have event(3) library which is a generic library for
network and file I/O
 using the event loop model.

If you have stayed with me so far then you can also perhaps guess why a
straight forward light weight process(thread) cannot scale or improve.

It most of the time causes bugs and performance loss.

Reason is simple.

By having multiple network connections you get performance. This is how download
 accelerators work. But using pipelining also improves performance which is
 not using multiple connections.

How to resolve this paradox?

Multiple network connections get you the bandwidth that are shared on
the LAN, so
 you can use the WAN bandwidth to your advantage.

However in protocols like SMTP and HTTP, creating a separate
connection for every
 mail or web request is a drag on performance.

Enough for now.

-Girish

It will be better if you put this in a web page and provide the link. It 
is difficult to read, mostly because, formatting & plain text just don't 
go well together unless you put a lot of effort in.

Who gives a damn about what he thinks about C or C++ for that matter. I 
hate C++ myself and he didn't have say it. I hate java too but I guess 
the discussion on "programming languages I hate" doesn't belong here. 
People who like C++/Java, please don't feel offended, this is just a 
personal opinion/choice.

        This is something that is easy to get wrong. I still see a lot
of people argue that multi-threaded is the way to go. But event based
approaches are a lot better. Also, I guess beyond a limit,
multi-threaded approach doesn't scale.

     In GNU/Linux, we now have epoll(7). Epoll is an event based I/O
notification based library. scales better normally, but can be a
little tricky if we are not used to event loops/event based
programming. Thanks
