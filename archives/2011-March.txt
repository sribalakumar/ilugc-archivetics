After seeing your output in the Paste I think the issue is not with
apt-get but something else.
I could only find out that far. I donot know what the exact problem
is. You are looking at the wrong place I think.

Could you please try running /usr/bin/ruby? It could be that /usr/bin
is no longer in the $PATH.

In my college days, counting lines was used as an example to
demonstrate the difficultly of writing Software Requirements Specs.
Even for a simple line counting program, the SRS becomes
unexpectedly complicated as one starts considering the boundary
cases.

If SRS is defined as "count all new line chars in the file", then what
about files which do not end with a new line character on the last line?

If we then modify the spec as "count all new line chars in the
file, and EOF unless preceded by a new line", then what about
files which have no text, only a single EOF char.  Is that considered
as a file with 0 lines or with 1 line.

Interesting exercise for any developer creating requirement specs.

Use lookup tables. If you are using 32 bit ints to store numbers, you need a
lookup table till 12.

uint32_t factorial_lut[] = {
    1,
    1,
    2,
    6,
    24,
    120,
    720,
    5040,
    40320,
    362880,
    3628800,
    39916800,
    479001600,
};

uint32_t factorial(uint32_t n)
{
    if (n < 13)
       return factorial_lut[n];
    else
       return -1;
}

I could think of one reason why you would ever want to do this is - speed.

Vijay

Hello,

Does this USB wi-fi dongle (RTL8187L chipset) work any better under
ndiswrapper? Under the native drivers, it stops communicating after a
few seconds of use. Disconnecting and reconnecting to the network will
allow it to work for another few seconds.

Is there any hope on this front or should I ditch this for another
dongle? If so, does anyone have any recommendations?

All the ndiswrapper posts I've found so far are pre-2010.

I had the same dongle connected to my desktop at one time.
IIRC it worked out of the box in Unbutu 8.x and WPA2 WLAN.

There are some software like oregano, gnucap, gEDA tools, KSimus.. by
which one can simulate circuits.. Also, QEMU, generic and open source
machine emulator and virtualize is there. It can be used to emulate
any kind of processor. So, by combining these we can able to create
powerful emulation software.

to ask questions. Translations include: German, French, Italian,
Catalan, Finnish, Danish and Spanish.

In only 5 years, Ubuntu has become the most popular Linux-based
operating system in the world with millions of users. Did you ever
wondered how the Ubuntu development works? Do you want to know how to
get involved yourself? You can get more information about Ubuntu
Developer Week here.

This is a myth.  The history of startups shows us that the best
entrepreneurs were neither mature nor experienced when they started out

If anything, the history of college-dropout entrepreneurs shows us that
understanding a specific customer need and build a kickass product to
address it is the best way to build a startup.

In fact, I'd argue that starting a company before you work for anyone else
will ensure that you have an open mind before dogma kicks in.  Now running a
startup -- once it becomes a full-fledged company -- takes experience.  That
is when maturity, experience, and understanding the caveats of doing
business in the real world becomes important.

Best,
Karthik

Hmm, do you remember if you used ndiswrapper or if you used the native

I agree there are remarkable exceptions.
But this cannot be generalized.

Adobe's founders were 40+ when they started out.

Unless you had a product idea which is simply out of the world, it is
unlikely that VCs will fund inexperienced and/or immature individuals.

Hi,

Late reply - I hope you must be convinced by many replies.
Here are my thoughts hoping that they might help you:

**Warning: Its a lengthy reply**

 > I am a final year BE student. While most of my mates are
 > sincerely searching for a spot in the corporates, me and two
 > of my friends cherish a dream of creating a business for

That's good news. But, choosing to be an entrepreneur means that
there could be a lot of sacrifices that you should be ready to make
when compared to getting a job in a company.

The reason most people shy away from getting in to entrepreneurship
or self-employment and instead find themselves a job in an
established company in my opinion/experience are as below:

1. Family/peer pressure.
One must sometimes be a rebel and not succumb to family/peer
pressure, but instead believe in self and strive hard to accomplish
his/her goal.

The same family/peers will realize the true value of the decision
that you made (of course, much later when you stand tall on the
success ladder).

2. Job/Career/Financial stability.
Most BE/B.Tech students that I have come across these days have
taken up the field of engineering (especially computer science)
for only one reason - to get a high-paying job and the opportunity
to fly abroad. Getting a job in a good company assure their family
that they can get married soon and "settle" in life :-D
To most of them - life becomes simpler at this level. So they
don't have to worry about starting a company, "manage" business and
hunt for projects - it simply not worth the trouble for most of
them.

3. Lack of ideas/business acumen.
Lets face this - you simply cant run a software company today
while there are so many of them already, and a lot of them
(however small or big) compete with each other in many ways -
not without an idea that would translate to business and the
dedication and effort that translates business to growth.

4. Lack of passion.
Most entrepreneurs that I know (both by books and personally) are 
extreme workaholics. At-least during the inception of a company,
they dedicate almost all their time in building their business
(be it technology, team building, client contacts, etc). I know
at-least 5 entrepreneurs personally who sleep for less than 4 hours
a day on average. Their passion for what they do - make them lose
sleep. YMMV, but if you are not passionate about what you do, then
you simply can't make it to success in the long run.

5. Lack of skills.
Most people are simply not confident about their skills and their
potential - not at-least when they are out of college. Some of these
people take up a job to gain experience and expertise and then
step into business much later. If you are not competent enough nor
confident about your skills or what you can do, its best not to
burn your fingers by starting up a business.

6. Fear of failing.
Most of us have been groomed since child-hood by being punished in
some way or the other for failing! This fear alone deters most of
them from becoming entrepreneurs. If you want to be an
entrepreneur, be bold and be prepared to face failure staring
right at you many times. It should only make stronger and
more wiser in the long run.

 > application development and software deployment.

There are way too many website development companies. But, the good
news today is, you can still get a project for doing a website
more easily - though it might not pay really great when you start
off. Eventually, when you focus of building high-quality websites
that impress more clients, you can survive as a good website firm.
Keeping yourself/company updated with the latest trends and
technologies, constant up-gradation of your technology skills and
business avenues will help in surviving as a website company.

Note that web is gradually becoming your application platform.
Most native applications are now becoming web applications
(using web services with web-based or mobile device front-ends
and so on). The market for web-based applications is only
growing more rapidly.

Of course, there are still applications that are not web based
(like banking systems, software/firmware for embedded devices,
  large enterprise applications, network and telecom-related
  software frameworks and monitoring tools, data mining/warehousing
  applications, and so on).

 > I recently saw a message in the "NCR Python Users Group India"
 > discussing Data Mining tool for collecting data from Excel
 > Documents and displaying them on web pages. I think these are
 > some untapped areas of software deployment, at least here in
 > India.

As of today - such requirements are very few and niche (when
compared to web applications and website related projects).
And yes, there are a couple of dedicated companies who cater to
such requirements. So, the market in this area is not untapped.

 > 1. Can we really survive as a company creating application
 > specific or customized software for situations like the one I
 > have mentioned above?

Yes, you can. But be prepared to be more diversified, unless
you know of a couple of dedicated clients who can feed you with
regular requirements in this area.

 > 2. Is there really market for such software and services in
 > India?

Yes, but not to a very large scale.

 > Kindly keep in mind FOSS.

For many of such requirements, whether you use FOSS or not
really doesn't matter to the client. Client wants results
that he can use, and for a justified price-point - unless
of course, the client is aware of FOSS and knows the benefit.

IMO, you must prioritize on client's needs and come up with a
viable solution without having to lecture the client with
"benefits of FOSS". If you are passionate about FOSS (like me),
you would simply opt out of any project that demands/requires
using a proprietary framework/application/tool (maybe with
an exception of proprietary to FOSS migration).

 > 3. If there is a possibility to survive. Are we going to be
 > judged by the work we do or by the industry experience we have
 > or supposed to have? (Remember I am still at college)

Let me tell you this: getting your first project/business deal
can be the toughest. If you get through this and come up with
great results and make your client happy, you will get more
projects eventually. After the first 4 to 5 successful projects
and client's testimonials, you will be judged by your work
and accomplishment.

Of course, you might not be able to crack the multi-million
dollar enterprise project deal to begin with - not without
strong founded industry experience and proven credentials.
But you will be able to survive and sustain on projects from
smaller clients (who wouldn't pay more than 4 to 5 figures in
Indian rupees) during the initial stage (at-least for an year
or two). But this should be good enough for most to plan and
focus on further expansion. Stable companies grow gradually
till they reach critical mass and then rapidly expand.

Remember the golden rule of business:
Steep growth = Painfully steep fall!

 > Keeping in mind that depends on the quality of work we do and our

 > would be starting.

To begin with, you start small - to gain confidence in yourself,
your deliver-ability and also in building the client base. How small
can be very subjective - lets say as good as "free" but yet the
client doesn't get a feeling that you are not serious about your
work. The idea here is to plan your personal expense, operational
costs and the gradual growth-plan of your company and then set your
price accordingly.

For example, there are companies who would build a website for you
for Rs. 5000/- and there are companies who would charge you
Rs. 5,00,000/- for the same (just like there are film stars who
cost almost nothing to act and there are some who cost the earth
  - you get the picture).

I hope you had patience reading my lengthy reply. Lastly, all of
the above are based my *personal* opinion.

Good luck!

[snip]

> Adobe's founders were 40+ when they started out.


To add, founders of CISCO and RIM (famous for Blackberry brand) were
also 40+ when they started out :-)

What really matters are self-motivation and passion to succeed by
creating value to customers - which in turn would eventually translate
to business/growth. Age and industrial experience (or lack thereof)
does not set the criteria for running successful businesses IMO -
though industrial experience would at best help boosting the
self-confidence and much needed support to help create a start-up.


> Unless you had a product idea which is simply out of the world, it is

True, but in my opinion running a company these days with VC funding
is like walking on a tight rope - especially if the company was funded
much before it reached critical mass in terms of business growth and 
were not destined for expansion.

+10 to every point you have mentioned here.  I can personally
relate to nearly everything you have mentioned.

Here are my additions to the OP.


I started a Linux/FOSS development company in 2003.   I ran
it for 10 months and was fortunate enough to get a client to buy
us over.  It was my first start up, had under 3 years of work experience
and the had just returned back to India after several years.

Don't expect your first startup to be a success.  It will be a
lot of effort, and every mistake will teach you to build a better
organization the next time you attempt it.  Being an entrepreneur
is successful in the long run, initially you will have to pass through
difficult times and learn from every mistake.


> The same family/peers will realize the true value of the decision

+1.  As a leader, you need to take the bold initiatives and provide
time for others to understand/follow your ways.  It's very important
to be patient with others who may initially lack your vision.


> 3. Lack of ideas/business acumen.

+100.  In hind sight, this is what I lacked the most.

All the passion, good will and motivation do not pay the bills each
month.  Money is the only language a company speaks.  Whatever
noble means you use to make it is okay, but it *must* translate into
revenue in the end.

A business plan will definitely help.  Don't underestimate MBA
grads.  I've had colleagues who were exceptionally brilliant IIT/IIM
products, they were critical to the growth of the organization.
Try to get someone with marketing/sales experience on your
team.

During those 10 months I ran my company, I rarely slept before
2am and was back at work by 8am.  I almost always worked 7 days
a week.


> IMO, you must prioritize on client's needs and come up with a

+1.  Solving customer problems, and providing solutions is far
more important to your business than patronizing FOSS or any
other ideology.

+1

Initially you'll have to project your own capabilities.  After a few
wins, you can start projecting your company instead of individual
accomplishments.



Some points I want to add:

1.  It takes a variety of skills to run a successful business -- technical,
sales/marketing, financial, and customer relationship management are the
most fundamental.  It's a good idea to partner with like minded individuals
who can fulfill these roles.  A single person doing justice to all these roles
is not possible.

2.  You need good mentors who can guide you along the way.  Advice
from this list is not good enough.  Close interaction with mentors is essential
if you are inexperienced with startups.

3.  Understand the strengths and weaknesses of every member in your
team.  Play to your strength and never to your weakness.  Eg. if you are
a great programmer but a lousy negotiator, then do not attempt to
negotiate with clients.  Let someone apt at negotiating play that role.



The company I run today is very different from the one I started earlier.
We work 5 day weeks, have extremely satisfied customers, generate
100 x the revenue and do it with half the number of staff.

For me the road here was long and difficult.  It is still difficult in many
ways and we have to face daily challenges.  But there's no other way
I would have wanted it.

Best of luck!

Take an ethernet cable, connect the computer to a switch/hub and
connect your system also
to the same switch. Also connect the MODEM with Internet connection to
the same switch.

To communicate you need IP addresses in the same logical network.

Choose something like 192.168.1.0/24 or some such thing. For instance,

Assign 192.168.1.3 to your machine and 192.168.1.5 to the other.

The MODEM can be assigned 192.168.1.1 if it already does not have one.

As all the code for ubuntu are hosted in launchpad,
anyone can get them and give to other distros.

all code for all distros is hosted somewhere - that is not the meaning
of the question. Most distros have a large number of people working on
upstream applications - but Ubuntu does not. why?

kernel packages are categorized stable and longterm.

Message-ID: <128618.23011.qm@web33106.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I am usually just a lurker but I HAD to reply to this.

1. For ANY business, cash flow is the critical. Be stingy while spending. You could rent comps rather than buy. You need not have a fancy office in the beginning. Always have cash equivalent to 2-3 months of expenses in the bank. 

2. Get good people to work with.

3. Keep thinking on how you can give more value for money to the client. This is for throughout your career.

4. Personally recommend having at least a few years of work ex as most business will be vary of trying out freshers for business critical stuff. 
Also recommend reading up basics of mkting, strategy. Remember that 99% of startups fail - plan around this.

5. You can be in a niche area and charge premium or get into LAMP kind of stuff which is low billing but high volume.

6. Entrepreneurship is more of a marathon and not a sprint. Keep this in mind while preparing. Staying power makes the difference in building an org.

Thanks,

Hi all,

One word of caution. I would recommend people sticking to facts rather than anecdotes. The golden image of college dropouts starting successful companies if the exception and not the rule. 

For every successful college dropout, there will be 200 failures. Do not compare yourselves to Bill Gates, Steve jobs, Dell etc. Bill Gates was from a VERY wealthy family with a LOT of connections. Steve Jobs had a team of experienced people from Xerox and stuff, Dell was running the business for some time as a student before he quit. Also US has way more opportunities in terms of funding and entrepreneur support.

I would like to remind Karthik that these are really young and impressionable people and I would advise caution. 

I have built a sustainable business based on FOSS consulting. Been through a lot of ups and downs.

Starting up sounds sexy but there is a lot of risk - it takes talent, a lot of hard work, adaptability, a very strong heart and most importantly dollops of luck. Yes. Luck plays a pretty important part.

Also the potential entrepreneurs should understand the there will be a lot of advise on this forum but if your business fails, at the end of the day, you have to feed yourself and pay your own bills. If you try to go back to a job, it will be tougher both for you and potential employers. You will not have any hard skills and for the other skills, prospective employers will be under the impression that you will quit as soon as you have the next great idea.

The thrill of entrepreneurship is that bottom-line responsibility rests with you and that exactly is the risk too.

Be aware that you are risking your life. Better do it with more preparation.

A friend of mine has built a custom Manufacturing Resource Planning
(MRP) system based on the Drupal engine and it has been in production
since 2007.

To go beyond building web sites, you need to have a fairly deep
understanding of Drupal.   Once you understand the architecture of
Drupal (or any other) package then it is up to as to how you can
extend it.

Hi,

Drupal is best suited for content-driven websites and web applications.
Doing anything other than this might involve deep diving into its
internals. IMO, if your webapp is not going to be purely content-driven
you might want to try out CodeIgniter or any other similar
web application framework.

Cheers!

Dear all,

I am reading all these responses - which are 'on the dot'.

Also, i see a trend these responses are towards : from the 'starter's' point
of view only.

Are'nt we missing one more thing :

- to have good marketing team / person.
He should be able to find good (and needy) clients - for which you could
satisfy their needs.  This is very important.

Even if you have a very good product - for instance (Mr. Girish - wont mind
me - for taking this as an example) the 'Spam Cheetah' , is a very good
product, but not able to shown to the right audience.  whereas in the same
category a lot of new products which satisfies the same need are doing very
good business.

Try to find: Internals (where you have a lot of control - if not full)
- first of all what you can do
- what you want to do - in the long run
- what compromises you could endure - in the short term (till you get a good
amount of revenue generated)

And then : External (which you have no control)
- the needs of a general customer (should have platform, need, etc)
- attack these segments (first time and low budget customers), these may not
be the corporate segment, but some private customers and of course factories
/ production houses etc.
- keep meeting them, month after month - since the more you go, the customer
will have the confidence in you, your product and also your company, and
finally your confidence in solving his problem
- quote a low (not lower than your cost break-even), and show him that you
are doing this specially for him.

FIRST - YOUR FULL EFFORT SHOULD GO TO GET A FIRST CUSTOMER.  As soon as you
get your first customer, through him, you should be able to get more
references, customers.

Efforts should be made to get more - enquiries, build up more funnels.
 Interaction with more potential customers will give you more confidence,
which leads to more endurance.

Most of the businesses wind up - not because of money ("There is no lack of
Money, Only LACK OF IDEAS" - robert schuller), but because of not having
enough confidence on the solutions / capabilities of the person / company -
to endure the problems.

It should be a point - that though the MS Windows was inferior to others (at
least at the time of their beginning), it not just survived, but grew to
become the default.  So concentrate on others which are not under your
"control" (I know that I am going to get more responses on this point) that
is the CUSTOMER ANGLE.

If you can find your customer, his needs, the solutions to solve his
problems - then you can win.  Getting people to code, and other after sales
etc, can be done without too much of a problem.

If there is anything wrong - please just point them out, and requesting not
to criticize me.

Happy Selling,

with warm regards,

K C R.

Pretty good advise, my 2 cents, when realty knocks on the door(cash flow, no
marketing competency, not enough capital etc), a entrepreneurs who is built
for it will evolve and adapt to the situation, those who don't will fade
away.

Don't get into it because of the glamorized anecdotes you read like "Bill
Gate, Steve Jobs are drop outs" that's for sure.

I would like to remind Karthik that these are really young and
impressionable people and I would advise caution. 

I have built a sustainable business based on FOSS consulting. Been through a
lot of ups and downs.

Starting up sounds sexy but there is a lot of risk - it takes talent, a lot
of hard work, adaptability, a very strong heart and most importantly dollops
of luck. Yes. Luck plays a pretty important part.

Also the potential entrepreneurs should understand the there will be a lot
of advise on this forum but if your business fails, at the end of the day,
you have to feed yourself and pay your own bills. If you try to go back to a
job, it will be tougher both for you and potential employers. You will not
have any hard skills and for the other skills, prospective employers will be
under the impression that you will quit as soon as you have the next great
idea.

The thrill of entrepreneurship is that bottom-line responsibility rests with
you and that exactly is the risk too.

Be aware that you are risking your life. Better do it with more preparation.

The real issue is I still can not understand this things.

If I know somw event is happening about any Free Open Source Software,
I just share the information here.

I do not get them as forward mail.
I get the information from various sites, mailing lists, irc etc.
After some editing like adding links, formatting, I share it to the
mailing list.

I dont want to give just a single url and all to click to explore what it is,
I give as much information as possible in the mail itself.

Links are also being provided for further exploration.

Those event information and content are to share with others and they
dont request for any attribution.

As I participate most of the event, I share the information to the list.

Please advice me on how I have to change the voice or tone in the announcements.

Give some examples on how we have to announce the event "Ubuntu Developer Week"
and the link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek to the list.

Thanks.

Kenneth,

As you told in the other thread like ubuntu is not giving back to
upstream, please provide some examples for that.
I am not aware of that so far.
If ubuntu is denying developers for upstream contribution, we can take
some serious actions and reporting about ubuntu.

Thanks.

Friends.

We are discussing for preparing the LAB Manual for Anna University Syllabus.

Shall we start working on this?

MIT Chrompet is accepted for providing a 40 seat lab for the community
to gather and
work on preparing the lab syllabus.

The Lab is facilitated with linux machines and internet connection.

Shall we meet there on coming saturday March 4 at MIT?

The Lab Syllabus is here.
http://goinggnu.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/open-source-lab-syllabus-in-anna-university/

We can choose any topic, create documentations on introduction, create
exercises and verify them.

Please update here, if you wish to contribute for the LAB Manual.

Thanks.

Hmm, interesting. I do believe this is unrelated to my problem, though,
which I managed to fix by upgrading the kernel to 2.6.35-27 using an
Ethernet cable.

I will post if I encounter any more trouble, but performance is
definitely up as it has been up for 2-3 hours (during which I've
transferred a few gigabytes to check) without any particular issues.

While searching for information on my Realtek chipset based WG111v2 I
came across some posts about Prism54-based USB wifi devices being
misidentified as Atheros-based. It might be worth confirming whether
your `lsusb` output matches anything on this page under '0846':
<http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids>.

The lab that you are talking about is the FOSS lab you set up the department
of Computer Technology.

We have planned to have this manual preparation work at Computer Center,
which is a central facility of the college, common to students of all
departments. This lab has 40 systems with CentOS-5 and only a few extra
packages installed. Internet connection will be available, however.

When you lift text verbatim from some one or site it is a common
courtesy to acknowledge where you got the information from and include
relevant text using some kind of notation.

Example

<quote>

                 blah blah blah blah ...

</quote>

Is that so difficult?

It is nice and welcome as long as you convey it in a proper manner.

Till now such postings, from you, look as though you have composed
them which is misleading.

> I do not get them as forward mail.

Mailing lists announcements can be forwarded by clicking on the
forward icon/link in your email client.

IRC you can copy/paste and mention the source of your quotation.
Ditto with web sites.

Those interested in your event will click on the URL.  It does not
matter IMO; the issue is proper quotation.

When you copy/paste it is not your voice/tone.   It is the original
authors voice/tone.  With appropriate quote marks you do not have
change the voice/tone at all.  After all you are quoting.

> Give some examples on how we have to announce the event "Ubuntu Developer Week"
> and the link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek to the list.

In this case it would have been sufficient to quote the first para of
the announcement and then give the URL for further reference.

Hi friends,

I tried to install Umbrello, A UML modeller in Ubuntu 10.04 using the
following command:

*apt-get install umbrello-kde4

*but it says:*
 " E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with
--fix-missing? "

Is this uml modeller is only for kde desktop or it can also be used for
Gnome? "

*Please help me friends.*

I'm using Ubuntu 10.10 and just "apt-get install umbrello" worked fine for
me. Try apt-get update or --fix-missing as it suggests.

Though it is a KDE based application, it can be used in Gnome very well (not
only this, but many KDE based applications).

Hi Shrinivasan,

I work very closely with Ubuntu team, so I have nothing to comment on this,
but read this [1] in slashdot.

Thanks

It's as simple as this - if it's not content you came up with, use quotes
(or anything that indicates that you've copied it from elsewhere, or are
quoting someone). If possible, attribute. If you're unable to use quotes
(for whatever reason), paraphrase. It's considered bad manners and (worse
still) plagiarism to not indicate the portions you've borrowed from someone
else.

Moreover, just adding one line, link, comment, or any minor changes, do not
justify using content as your own. And, I can't say it enough - attribute,
attribute, attribute.

For instance: You may be mashing up an announcement and have used a few
lines from some event announcement on a developer list, a few lines from
someone's blog post, and a couple of lines from a website. You may put your
announcement together, but the content is still not yours - it's from 3
different places. Ideally, you should put them individually in quotes with
corresponding attributions.
eg.
-----
ABC has a sprint happening at <venue> on <date>. <xyz_name> on the
<blah_name> mailing list says the following about this.
"<whatever you want to quote from xyz's email>"

As <MN>, the author of <insert> package, says in her blog, <quote> insert
snippet from blog </quote>.

For more information on this wonderful package refer <website>.

Understood. I do remember sending you a bio/write up offlist for some talk
and saw it sent verbatim to the list without quotes or attribution. While
there was no attribution required, it was not content that you generated but
it certainly looked like you did (likely unintentionally). Quotations to
indicate that you didn't write the lines would be a graceful way of helping
others realize who came up with what or at least in distinguishing between
something authored by you and someone else. While I was not miffed, I do
think it's not good practice to not quote, especially in open source circles
and academia.

Basically, while attribution is upto you, copying is not, i.e., 'tis not a
sin to not attribute, but it's a serious one to not quote content that you
did not come up with. Thumbrule - if you have pasted a line from somewhere,
put it in quotes, and attribute the author (if content snipped is
significant). If it's someone else's idea or if rephrasing it, mention that
you're paraphrasing someone else.

This applies almost everywhere - college projects, assignments, homework,
writing research papers, articles, publishing *anything* anywhere ... You
don't want to be stuck with a "plagiarism" tag!

A better (and more objective/impersonal) explanation can be found under
"Notes on plagiarism" at -

I don't really think there is any such classification in the real
world or at least not anything officially. What I am trying to put
forth is just a line of differentiation that would help us to see a
distinction between propertiery based languages and those languages
that are open source based.

As for the question of classifying c/c++, why go for such a high level
language? you can take up assembly language or BASIC FORTRAN for that
matter. The reason for them to not to be placed on either side is that
they were the ones on the first placed which ushered the development
of both open source and closed sourced systems. So there is nothing
like a strict protocol that defines the distinction of languages. But
rather the distinction is meant to help you chose between PHP and ASP
or between visual studio based languages and Qt based ones.

I hope I have justified the term "open source languages".

I would like contribute to this. I can provide help in the areas of
Python and GUI Programming.

I have been doing GNU/Linux training for quite sometime and I think I
can provide some useful inputs when it comes to doing a GNU/Linux
lab. The syllabus also seems to have some issues, but I think it can been
fixed up with a little bit or re-ordering and trimming. A few suggestions
for the lab manual:

  * There seems to be too many languages: Python, Perl, PHP, Gambas
    ... I would suggest that one language be used through-out the lab
    exercises, and the others be just touched upon.

  * One of the problems with labs involving installation of kernel and
    software packages, is that the students have to be given root
    access. And there will be lot of maintenance overhead for restoring
    the system back to a sane state. This can be avoided by installing
    the packages within a VM. Within the VMs the students get complete
    root access, and even if things screw up, the VM's harddisk image
    can be restored from backup.

  * The better order would probably be: (I have choosen Python as
    the primary language, here. But other combinations are also
    imaginable.)

    - Running Python 
    - GUI Programming (using Python)
    - Version control systems ...
    - Virtualisation
    - Setting up the complete network ...
      (using a virtual network formed by multiple VMs)
    - Installing various software pacakges (within VM)
    - Compiling from source (within VM)
    - Introduction to package management (within VM)
    - Writing user space drivers (using Python)
    - Kernel configuration, compilation and installation (within VM)
    - Running PHP
    - Running Perl

Regards,
Vijay

Whether a programming language is open source of closed source depends
on two things - the language standards and the language implementation.

As C/C++/C# are languages based on Open standards (ANSI/ISO) - so
anyone can implement a compiler/toolchain for them.

There are open source compilers/toolchains (like GCC, LLVM) and
closed source ones (MS Visual Studio, AT&T C++, etc).

Some languages like PHP, Python and Perl are open-source in terms
of language design (though they might not be standardized as the
part of ISO/IEEE/ANSI) and their default implementation. Many of us
simply refer to them as Open source languages.

In comparison, Visual Basic, ASP and similar languages are proprietary
designs (done by a company) and come with a default implementation
that also is proprietary - we cannot classify them as open source
language/implementation.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

[Foundation-l] New members of Language committee
Milos Rancic millosh at gmail.com
Mon Feb 28 17:19:28 UTC 2011

I am glad to announce that Language committee is stronger for three
new members. By the time of getting their applications, the list is:

???????? ????????????? (Zaharias Diakonikolau) (meta:User:ZaDiak)
* languages spoken: el, en-4, de-2, grc-2, pnt-1
* living in: Europe, Greece, Rhodes
* reason for inclusion: A couple of months ago Language committee
announced that it is searching for members from the [types of]
projects which don't have Wikipedia-like dynamics. Zaharias has passed
as an applicant from Wikiversity (he is admin at Beta Wikiversity and
bureaucrat at Greek Wikiversity). However, his qualifications go
further: he is actively working on creation, editing and promoting
projects in various Greek languages. Knowing that he is young, he will
be our long term investment, too.

Oliver Stegen]] (meta:User:Baba Tabita)
* languages spoken: de, en-4, sw-3 <small style="color:gray;">nl-1, fr-1</small>
* living in: Africa, Kenya, Nairobi (from Europe, Germany)
* reason for inclusion: Oliver is a linguist who is working for SIL on
East African languages. We'll have one ultra-relevant expert in
LangCom thanks to Jon Harald S?by, one of the LangCom members, who met
Oliver in Nairobi.

Santhosh Thottingal]] (meta:User:Santhosh.thottingal)
* languages spoken: ml, hi-3, en-3, ta-2,
* living in: Asia, India, Chennai (Madras)
* reason for inclusion: Santhosh is a free software guru interested in
languages. He will help us in articulating projects for covering
language-related needs of Wikimedia projects.

I want to add one more point related to Santhosh. He has passed as a
LangCom member not because he is from India, but because he has
relevant expertise and right attitude. Although he speaks three Indian
languages, he has become a member of LangCom because he is a free
software guru interested in languages. Before Santhosh's application,
we would have been happy to see anyone with this qualification and
this attitude, no matter of location of birth or residence.

However, Bishakha's question and subsequent conversation helped, as it
gave impulse to Santhosh to submit the application. And that brings to
my mind that it would be good to pass the whole world periodically and
raise the geographical equality issue. And it is not a joke. That's
obviously giving people courage, or at least the idea, that they have
the same right to become members of any Wikimedia body, as any
Westerner has. Sometimes the qualifications won't be relevant for
particular position, sometimes they will.

You have to keep reminding your government that you don't get your
rights from them; you give them permission to rule, only so long as
they follow the rules: laws and constitution.

?Or http://www.scilab.in/files/workshop_materials/Poster-LowRes.pdf
Website -> http://www.scilab.in/Textbook_Companion_Internship

Summer internship for the Textbook companion project

The FOSSEE textbook companion project is part of the FOSSEE project at
IIT Bombay. This project is handled by the following professors at IIT
Bombay:

Prabhu Ramachandran (Aerospace Engg Dept), Kannan Moudgalya (Chemical
Engg Dept), Madhu Belur (Electrical Engg Dept), Mani Bhushan (Chemical
Engg Dept), PSV Nataraj (Systems and Control).

Textbook companion summer internship project can be taken up by
students in various colleges who want to undertake a summer internship
at IIT Bombay. The project will involve a teacher of the student (from
the same college) who has taught the subject for at least one or two
years. The teacher will guide the student through the project and will
be responsible for the student's submissions.

The procedure is as follows:

You should know or learn Scilab. Resources are provided?here.

For use of any package (other than scilab) you should contact us
separately at contact at scilab.in.
You should propose three books in order of your preference using the
proposal form available at?this link?(you have to? register in order
to access the proposal form).

You must ensure that the book you are proposing has not been completed
under this project or is currently being undertaken under this project
by someone else, (click?Completed Books?and?Books in Progress?to see
the respective lists). We will try to tentatively allot one of the
three proposed book. To see examples of the books that have already
been worked upon, visit?Completed Books

Please note that the last date for sending codes of one typical
chapter?is now extended to 18th March, 2011

It is suggested that you propose the book as early as possible and do
not wait for the last date as your favourite book may get assigned to
someone else.

After we receive your proposal (from the form in item 2 above), we
will respond within a day about which book is?tentatively?allotted to
you. After tentative allotment, you will submit to us all the codes
for one typical chapter?within five days?of the allotted book. Fill
the proposal form keeping this 5-days-constraint in mind.?The
procedure and format for submitting the codes will be informed by
email.

If you will submit correct and good quality codes then your allotment
will be?final?with that book. You will be intimated about the approval
or disapproval for your proposal via email within 2 days. If you are
selected then your name along with the? textbook proposed will appear
in?Books in Progress.

After the final allotment you will start coding of the examples of
entire book in your college itself. You are required to send your
progress/codes to us every week at?textbook at scilab.in. Also send the
same to your college teacher. (Note:?Lack of regularity on your part
may force us to cancel your internship and the project will assigned
to another intern.)

Simultaneously, you should fill the IITB registration form (Link will
be made available soon on the website) and post it to us.

The time-frame for completion of the book coding? will be decided
between you, your college teacher and us.

You will come to IIT Bombay for one week to carry out the changes
suggested by the reviewer. The exact dates for coming to IIT Bombay
will depend upon

??? Your Vacation
??? Availability of accommodation at IIT Bombay
??? Completion of the book
??? Review of the book

Candidates who finish the report as per specified procedures at the
end of their one week stay here in IIT Bombay will get a certificate:

"Certified that the work completed is equivalent to six weeks of
training under the supervision of the faculty of IIT Bombay".

You will be given an honorarium of Rs. 10,000 for completing this work
and Rs. 5,000 to your college teacher.

For details please?click here

You will have to pay all other expenses. For example, some are travel
to and from IIT, boarding and lodging, and internship registration
fees: This will be intimated.

I have written at least 5 articles on vim.

I think it is the world's best editor when it comes to syntax highlighting.

All you have to do is:

:sy on

:TOhtml

or

:hardcopy > %.ps

for taking a snapshot in html or PS which  can be converted into PDF.

For black background you have to

:se background=dark

You can retrieve text from MS DOC using various tools in UNIX.

It doesn't always work but it does in many cases.

Squirrel Mail simply authenticates against your IMAP server.  Any
email account additions, password changing and maintenance
must be done on your IMAP server only, and is out of scope of
Squirrel Mail.

However, there are some plugins which can help you.  Suggest you
read the Squirrel Mail documentation completely to get a better
understanding of the features and limitations:

Please follow mailing list guide lines when you post.

If you don't know them, stop for a moment, look through
the list archives for the monthly announcements, read it,
before proceeding further.

To answer your question:
export the source code to html using Vim. Rename the
.html file to .doc. Open the file in Word and it will automatically
convert to Word format.

Message-ID: <AANLkTim04M7NMKCDwE-_anLdm3oQu70N7XCMiuaQ4VQ-@mail.gmail.com>

Hi
My sister at school is supposed to study Visual Basic at school in the
coming session and the computer at home is running Ubuntu. So can you
suggest some method using which she can do VB programming on Linux?
Similar problem is faced by students of Multimedia and Web Technology
students. The CBSE curriculum insists and has imposed use of Macromedia
Flash and Sony SoundForge for class XII.

Firstly, is there a workaround so that these softwares can be run on a Linux
System (except WINE) ?
Secondly, can we the open source community persuade the Board to modify the
course structure and promote use of Open Source technologies at school
level? Aren't we already doing that?

I think that the syllabus* has changed. When I was in class 12th I used to
study the VB and Oracle combo , but now it has changed to Java / MySQL
combo.

* : Assuming the board is CBSE and syllabus is of Informatics Practices.

Gambas or mono might be of help
http://gambas.sourceforge.net/en/main.html
http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page

Having said that , for a school student to corelate these tools with
what was taught in school using VB is an overkill . But she would
learn something new if she has the time and patience to use them .

Flash could work on wine though you don't like it , I guess thats the
only choice  else run windows on a VM

isn't mono IDE supposed to be for .NET based programming only?

at the age of 26.

So, Please don't discourage others. I will suggest if you don't know how a
business works in IT.

Then you should work at least 1-2 yrs in an IT company, try to find how they
work, what is the marketing strategy they apply.

Also, try to find what is the disadvantage on there strategy. This will let
you to create your own business strategy.

Always keep one thing in mind what an engineer can do, that a business man
can't.

So, be a good engineer first

I can suggest you startup field. Start working on Opensource collaboration.

One or two would have been remarkable exceptions -- more than half a dozen

Don't get me wrong -- I am not discounting the value of experience.
However, it is less important than most people would have you believe.  VCs
would much rather that you have a great idea than you have oodles of
experience.  They could care less about your experience, as long as you can
show revenue.

You are quoting me out of context. Both the quotes were for a post which
claimed only young inexperienced people can run startups and end up
with unadulterated brilliant ideas.

Neither me or the other poster were discouraging others. I was warning them
about realities of being on your own. For your information I have never
worked for anybody. I have been on my own since finishing school. I have had
some really great times and really bad ones.

I just want the OP to know that it is a long road. Be prepared for it. If
the OP comes to think that this is discouragement, business is a long way
off.

Again, like the prev mail, the context in which I quoted was in response to
a post which claimed only young inexperienced people can run startups and
end up with unadulterated brilliant ideas.

Point well taken...
But- The fact is that they will evaluate your abilities to show revenues.
Showing revenues is not only about a great idea. A business has to be built
with it. And generally, the experience will come from the VC's side if you
dont have it (read share).

On the same topic, nothing related to the original post.
Just a note - I attended a seminar conducted by Hindustan Chamber of
Commerce 2 months back on Venture funding.

Quick fact : VC funding in India -
No. 1 sector : Financial services
No. 2 sector : Core industry
No. 3.sector : IT and IT enabled services (less than 20%)

Investment phase :
More than 70% of investment by VCs were made in the secondary grown phase.
Extremely small percentage was made into startups.

VC funding in India is very very different from the VC funding in mature
economies. I was pretty surprised by the facts and figures shown during the
seminar.

I've been in early stage investing and an entrepreneur for a good
while now. There are two sides to a coin. For every success that one
sees in startups, there is a graveyard of 10.

Aspiring entrepreneurs must be aware of this as these would give
pointers to what succeeds. It also points to the fact that must not be
blinded by the idea if traction does not occur and carry on creating
frustration within. It is a fine line one has to tread.

On funding, it is true that seed funding is not as easy in India as in
the US but it has got a lot better in the last 4 years. Angel
investing is not as evolved either. There is a large gap between $100K
and $1M where players are very scarce. If anyone wants under $1M, it
is a tough ask. Entrepreneurs in India must strive to funds themselves
far longer than their US counterparts.

Subject: [Ilugc] Identifying the source of high memory usage
Message-ID: <1299215255.13554.17.camel@mjolnir>

Hello, everyone,

I'm running Debian 4.0 on a VPS. Yesterday, I had this problem where
more than two-thirds the available RAM was taken without any programs
running. RAM use was at around 700 MB _after subtracting cache/buffers_
but adding up the memory use of all the processes in `ps aux` would only
reach about 150 MB at maximum.

Is it possible that a program I was running earlier had memory leaks? If
so, how would I go about fixing this without rebooting the server and
how can I identify which program exactly is causing this? I have the
source for none of the likely culprits. 

Regards,

In my opinion high memory usage need not cause worry as long as swap is not touched. Did you notice any drop in performance? If not it should be
ok.

In top check which program uses highest memory  -M key. That might give some clue.

How did you subtract the cache/buffers ?  Typically Linux is quite 
liberal with using memory as is available. Hence a linux system running 
for a while will not report very low total memory usage.

I would not worry too much about this.

Any memory leaks the program might have had are now gone with the 
program no longer running.  One crude way I find useful to identify 
runaway programs is to track memory usage growth.  Run top and sort by 
memory (press M  I think) and watch it for a while.

Let us follow the same for preparing the manual.

We can change the plan, if required.

Hi,


     I'm a school student myself studying in CBSE, 11th Std., As far as I can remember, I was taught VB and Flash in my 6th and 7th std. too, but then I never payed much attention to it, because I was playing with Eclipse and Blender at my home. Also, the marks are not included for promotion (if that's the main criteria). I don't think CBSE mandates the curriculum for CS below class 9 (have to check it up).


     I would like to say that CBSE has changed its senior secondary curriculum to comply with Open standards. They have 2 streams - namely CS (Computer Science) and IP (Informatics Practices). CS deals with C++ and IP deals with the front-end and back-end connectivity. Previously, CBSE had used VB and Oracle for the IP stream. But now, I'm learning Netbeans w/ JAVA and MySQL. But then again, the SWING API which we're learning now in Netbeans has become obsolete. Both the products are owned by a single company, namely Oracle, which has earned the wrath of many Open source enthusiasts.   The C++ that is being taught in schools, is by using the old Turbo C++ ide. It's high time they change it to gcc. As far as my text book is concerned it goes like this: "Now click the start button, go to programs menu and choose MySQL command prompt." Some of my friends whom I've asked to switch, have asked me, "Will C++ work in Linux?" :-( Although CBSE has mandated that the curriculum has to be based on open standards, what is the use of having an entire open stack of applications to learn, when your base Operating System is closed and proprietary?

Thanks all for the interest in creating the LAB Manual for our students.

The Lab is available at Computer Center, MIT campus, Chromepet, Chennai - 44.
You can bring your laptops also if required.

We can have the session from 9.00 AM to 4.00 PM.

Please bring your friends too.

We need resources for Virtualisation, kernel compiling, fuse driver writing etc.

Thanks.

At the moment, I'm not seeing any trouble, but last night there was this
short period when the server started swapping and performance was
terrible. It would take ages to even serve a static webpage.

I sorted the entries in `top` by memory and on top was mysqld (125 MB
VIRT, 17 MB RES) followed by a few 4 MB apache processes. Even adding up
the VIRT table (the highest values) comes to a number about a fourth of
the RAM use reported by `free -m`.

I understand that disk caches, etc. will fill up RAM and have no problem
with that. However, here is the output of `free -m` at the moment (it
was much worse last night) <http://pastebin.com/pMkTh2FL>.

I've attempted to find the offending program (if any) but it doesn't
show up in the output of `top`.

What was the cpu load at that time? Some program may not use much memory but use lot of cpu, then also we see drop/stagnant performance.

I have experienced some such blackouts, while using rsync or some heavy disk read+cpu process. (off course I have no experience with web servers so your problem may be different)

I have come in here late, but if this is a VPS, it is very difficult to
debug this as some other guy on the VPS may be messing it up. Typically
top will show the whole machine and not just your share - again depends
on how it was set up. (if I am barking up the wrong tree ignore this)

FWIW, the Admin tools etc. are pretty much the same as in RHEL.
There is no firm date for CentOS 6.0 yet; so you if you want to see

Thanks a lot Kadambari, Kenneth and Arun Khan,

So happy to see the detailed explanations on Quoting.
Now only I really understand the things.

Will follow your suggestions in my mails.

sometimes, it requires a lot of patience and time to educate people.
Will be nice, if we all do the same detailed explanation while people
do mistakes like topposting, asking unrelated questions, replying to thread etc.

Instead of rude one line threats, these kind words will help the
people to understand the mistakes and rectify themselves.

I received some positive feedbacks on this thread from friends, who
were telling like "ILUGC should be more new users friendly".
We are proving that we are caring and educating people to learn and
improve themself.

Thanks.

Heck. This is close to impossible on your own.

gcc does not exist in isolation. It has to play along with several other
components like glibc and so on.

NEVER do it on your own. You are guaranteed to fail.

Instead upgrade the OS or simply install the binary package.

If you don't listen to this advice you can do as you please of course.

When I cause a memory leak I know what to do. top is good enough for me.

I never use valgrind of any of the profiling tools.

In your case I wonder what is going on.

The only big memory hog I have seen the 7z program from p7zip or
the firefox browser which does not use up half as much.

Other than that what you report is quite weird.

I know that Linux has various kinds of bugs but never seen or heard what
 you are saying.

Perhaps it is something wrong with your setup?

Just guessing.

Yes, it is definite. My Department has confirmed the event. They said
they'll give me the dates once they book the auditorium.

I am under the assumption that there is no fee for this. Please do tell me

The style of your asking had the right attitude (i.e. want to learn)
and you got the positive feedback and suggestions.

This is not just ILUG-Chennai specific.   If you ask the questions
with a positive attitude you get answers.   On the flip side, people
who ask for "step by step" on basic things (for which there are
umpteen articles/tutorials)  and expect hand holding without any
effort on their part - that is bad attitude IMO.  Linux mailing lists
is not the place for them IMO.

Do you mean some other VPS slice could be hosing up other guest VPS
and/or the "host" OS?  If that is the case then other VPSs on this
system is probable affected as well.  Perhaps OP should open a trouble
ticket with the provider.

The above is applicable to the vanilla shared hosting (e.g. apache
virtual hosts).   In VPS, "top" will only show what is running within
the "guest" OS of the VPS instance.

Hello all,

I am grateful to everyone of you for responding to my questions. Most of you
apart from just answering my question, have gone great lengths to explain
many things related to it. Even new threads have been created discussing the
topic. I think my mail not just helped me but a lot others. I have
deliberately postponed my "thank you" mail to this thread hoping something
new and useful would be added. I was right, in the past one week though many
things were posted the last mail came telling me of mentorship which is
untouched until now.

Everyone's mail helped me as much as it helped others who read this thread.
Some were motivating, some encouraging, some warning, some explaining, some
discussing; nevertheless everything was useful. Thank you all who have
contributed in the past week. I think we could wrap up the thread for good
now, which not necessarily restrict you in adding anything, just to put an
end to the discussion.

Thank you all.

Friends.

Today, we had a good meet and great work on FOSS Lab manual preparation.

Vijay explained about the project flow.
He created a repository to host the files.
Here is the repo - http://code.google.com/p/foss-lab-manual/

We discussed about the workflow and required time periods for the lab sessions.
We decided to create the manual using the asciidoc as it will be
easier for collaborative development.

Then we started to create study materials and lab manuals.

We committed our works on the repo in the evening.
We will continue the work from our home.

Thanks for the following contributors
Vijay
Vignesh
Mohan
Vimalesh
Dhilip
Shrinivasan

We thank computer society of MIT and their Head Incharge Ms.Catherine
Bina for providing the facilities.

That's a pretty clever thought. I hadn't considered that. Maybe I
haven't paid for 'guaranteed' RAM or some such? I'll check with them and
see.

<http://comspec11.in>Please feel free to suggest any change. It may have a

Now, all of you may be wondering how this web site is connected to iLUGc....
Well the connection is WORDPRESS!!! Yes, I'm using wordpress and it woks
like a charm. The UI is familiar and is like my wordpress
blog<http://hypersymmetric.wordpress.com>.
I'd also like to apologize to all those Drupal gurus and user for not
choosing it. I needed to deploy fast and wp had the upper edge as I didn't
have much to learn as my blog already runs wp.

We use asciidoc to create the documentation.
It is just a plain text format, but can be converted to other formats
like HTML,DocBook,LateX,XML and PDF easily.
The HTML files in the repo are the outputs of the asciidoc text documents.

check the asciidoc website for more info.
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/


> why not we do it in LaTeX itself that way
> any other format can be produced

asciidoc is very very easy than LaTeX as it looks like just a wiki formatting.

Happy to know that you are  interested in contributing.
Get the syllabus content from here
http://www.ilugc.in/content/open-source-lab-syllabus-anna-university

You can choose your desired task from the list
http://code.google.com/p/foss-lab-manual/issues/list

Learn asciidoc and start creating lab manual or study material for any topic.

Send us a patch :-)
Will add you as a committer then.

We need more reviewers, editors, proof-readers, content creators.
Please contribute.

>  as i asked before once we feel ok about the work who is going to wet it

This is a community project.
We help the students to face the open source lab in the next semester.
Without these efforts, they will scare to face the lab.

This effort will show the students that there is a big community to
help them to learn the open source technologies.

We only have to check the manual, proof read, edit, fix and have to release.

Here are a list of recommended WP plugins I run on my websites:

W3 Total Cache -- caching and site optimization. A+ in YSlow, etc.
Great for shared hosting where you have little CPU and you still
want great performance for your website.

WP-Table Reloaded -- I have ~100 tables on one website and this
plugin allows me to upload a CSV and create nice HTML/JS tables.

Podcasting Plugin by TSG -- flash plugin for playing mp3 audio directly
from the browser.

pageMash -- reorder page hierarchy by drag and drop.

OpenID, OpenId Selector -- easy/secure website logins.

Google XML Sitemaps -- create sitemap.xml for all search engines.

Google Analytics for WordPress -- If you are a GA user.


I also use Woo Themes, which works well with folding menus,
and other navigation elements.

Missed out on "WP Touch".  It creates smart phone friendly versions
of your WP site.  Compatible with WP Total Cache plugin.

What distro are you using? Most distros ship with multiple GCC
versions.  Eg. Debian 5.0.8 (old stable) comes with 2.95, 3.2, 3.4,
4.1. 4.2 and 4.3.  The latest 6.x also includes 4.4.  You just have to
apt-get install gcc-4.3 and ensure symlink /usr/bin/gcc points to
/usr/bin/gcc-4.3.

To make the changes only to your user account, "export CC=gcc-4.3"
before calling make.  Or you can also create a the above symlink in
~/bin/gcc pointing and ensure PATH is set to ~/bin first.


> what are the changes to include paths , macros , flags libs when i upgrade to gcc 4.4.4 or in simple what changes i should? do in my makefile or application when i migrate to newer version of gcc .

You don't have to change anything in your Makefile to use a new
version of gcc.  You will reuse the same system libraries with
the new compiler as well.

Unless your app is using features which are tied to a specific
gcc release, the migration to a new compiler is seamless.

If you want to use new features available in gcc 4.4, then consult
the manuals.

Do not enable CDN unless you really have a CDN subscription with a
vendor like Akamai, Amazon, Limelight Networks, etc.  I don't think the
free Coral Cache CDN is supported by this plugin.

CDN is useful only if you have users accessing your website from different
continents and you want to cache some of your site content closer to the
users using the CDN providers servers/bandwidth.  You can safely disable
the CDN option for now.

Hi,


     As I've already told in the January meeting, my dad wants to do more in FOSS. I suggested that he could become an advocate and legal advisor for FOSS projects. As he is interested in Intellectual Property rights, he accepted that he'd help us. I've asked him to read the GPL, which he has done. But, now he needs more resources to fully understand the community, and the bazaar system of development, that FOSS uses. I also need materials explaining about CVS, and the problems faced during combinig of different licenses.


     I thought he should get in touch with SFLC, India, what do you think about that?


     P.S: You can contact him at radhakrishnan at maasu dot in. He's a passive member of the mailing list too. 


 With Regards,

Which lab manual are you talking about? The one started at MIT yesterday is
not completed and I think this we shall discuss the corrections
off-the-list, as it will be making no sense to those who are not involved in
the manual preparation. After completing it, we can publish it for public
review and corrections.

Nice work; especially adding the options to register using various accounts
is nice and will give a good user experience :)

I would like to suggest some changes related to making a symposium website,
as I have done a few for my college.

After logging in, the sidebar shows 'Site admin', but a student registering
for a symposium will have no need to visit the admin page. You can edit the
sidebar file of your theme to change it. This is just a suggestion; it's
completely your choice.

Note that most of the pages lack web semantics. For example the headings of
pages are simply highlighted using CSS and they are not heading elements
(<h1>, <h2> and so on). Making your pages semantic will yield better search
results in search engines.
Also the domain name can be chosen such that it remains the same for all
years. For each year you can archive the site after the fest is over and you
can create a new landing page for next year. This also has to do with
improving your search results.

i do not know this will make a business sense to him to begin with . Ask him
to start reading http://www.groklaw.net/ .

yes this is one way , but there agenda is something which we need to revisit
, which will happen in due course of time in the meantime ask him to learn
as much as about the community by going to the meetings etc..

he can also advice people on the acts like Right to information etc.. once
he starts believing may be he can become an RTI activist himself , yes this
can be a good career option apart from his regular work .

I'm using a WRT54GL with Tomato VPN?(tomatovpn.keithmoyer.com)
firmware.

The WiFi settings show WPA2-Enterprise, RADIUS server IP,
shared secret, etc.  I've never used WPA2-Enterprise, my network
uses only WPA2-Personal in production.

hi,

a dumb question, but could not find the answer anywhere. I do a pull and
am told there are 4 heads. Do I merge all 4 - the earliest first, or
will a merge with the latest suffice?

Hi,


      Thanks for the reply and the link. By the term of Intellectual Property rights, I meant to say RTI, Patents, etc,. He's already doing RTI related filings. By the way, he's busy as it is with his profession, it was just due to my request, that he said that he'd take a look into the legal side of FOSS. Any more materials?

It's natural to compile the asciidoc file in the same folder and hence the
generated html file will be added while committing. If we are supposed to
move the generated html files each time before committing, it would be nice
to know the reason for it. (This may seem dumb, as I'm new to version
control systems; kindly point it out if it's so).

Hi,
I have this requirement to setup a small lab, where we have ~30 PCs,
all will be working on ubuntu. I need them to be connected in LAN. Also I
need to connect one of these systems(meant for instructor) to Internet.
The rest systems should not have net access.
How can i achieve that. All systems run on ubuntu and the same instructor
system should be the apt-cacher server.

apt-get install dhcp on the server. Configure dhcp. done. The server
should have two lan cards - the second one can be connected to the
internet. The other machines will not be able to access as long as you
do not install and configure squid.

(btw, not giving the lab internet is a very very bad way of setting up
an instructional lab)

+ don't give a default gateway in the DHCP service, disable
ip_forwarding in /etc/sysctl.conf and/or setup iptables to drop all
packets to the WAN, coming from the student work stations (put them in
a separate sub-net)

Having been involved in training, I used to feel the same way until I
realized that some of the students are more interested in surfing than
learning; not doing the exercises etc. and then later claiming they do
not follow the class.   Blocking Internet access was the the solution.

With the apt-cacher requirement, the OP is trying to balance the two needs.

I am not inexperienced in training either. I refuse to train where I do not
have the authority to enforce the level of discipline I specify in my
classes.
It is better to make the rules clear and enforce them without
exception rather than reduce the learning potential. YMMV

Making students accountable for their browsing is generally sufficient
to stop misappropriation.

Setup Squid with access logging enabled.  You can inform the students
that web access permitted but is logged, and they will be held accountable
for their actions.  Just the idea that web access is monitored will make
most students use the web carefully.

The problem here is also the net speed, the lab will be in a very remote
location in a rural area, with limited speed.
Cant I manage with a single network card? I dunno the hardware specs for the
lab as well. I am going there this weekend for setting up lab.

you have a bad pain in your finger - go to a doctor - he injects

 In GIT there is a file you can add to your project named ".gitignore",
where you can add the list of file extensions that git should ignore. In SVN
there must be something similar to that. Please try to use such feature.

" man stat "

are to be used in c program. Use those and develop your own program in C

I couldn't find any such file. However, I found that there is a property
called svn:ignore which can be set to the pattern of files and directories
to exclude while committing. After moving to the directory containing the
file to be excluded, I tried the following command

          svn propset svn:ignore . *.html

It says "svn: Cannot set 'svn:ignore' on a file ('php-manual.html')". How
should I fix this?

No. That will show the stat in first section of man page which details about
the shell command 'stat' and not the C function.

Hi,
  just check the connector in sound preferences, for speaker use analog
output in output tab i.e., sound preferences->output then check the
connector change that to analog output.
 i think this may help you, if it doesn't solve just ping me.

Hi Friends..

Fixed it. I've just swapped the arguments. The command should be

          svn propset svn:ignore *.html .

I just couldn't understand the error message properly. Sorry for the silly
doubt!

Follow the examples here.

I assume you have basic shell scripting experience.
Also man page of bash is good for a lazy weekend reading.

Hi,


     From the student's point of view, and as a student myself, cutting of internet access totally is very restrictive, and more harmful than having unmetered access. In this era of internet, its use and mis-use is one's one responsibility. I think that monitoring the system's activity remotely using VNC, or logging internet usage would be a good idea, as the concept of logging and monitoring deters much unwanted behavior. I would also suggest using a DNS based blocking system, like openDNS.


P.S: Remember, Linux is not Windows, and users are not supposed to be logged in as root, and student's do not need sudo privileges normally.

Hi,


     My dad has a Lenovo Ideapad S10-3S, and I face the same problem. I traced that the problem was due to the "dolby surround headphones" feature. So, i'm also working on how to get around this issue. Please check that if your laptop also has the dolby certified sticker or something like that.


     I guess it changes the the line-in to another line-out, so that you can get 4 channel audio. But the control is only through windows (which I barely used for an hour :-P), so I'm not sure. It works with only software control I guess... (like the old winmodems)

Will you restrict the use of mobile phones by students too . We are living
in the age of 2G and 3G . Even if u don't provide internet students may surf
on net using mobile phones while they listening to class.

Hi,

I am enthusiastic free software user. I don't know much programming. But I am willing to learn. Is there any project I can help and learn in the process. I have time now to dedicate on this kind of work. Can someone take me in their project as a volunteer, and I am based in Chennai.

regards,
Sid.

Hi,

For Fioinformatics, there are lots of programs "free"ly available. For phylogeny reconstruction there is 

Clustal (sequence alignment)
Seaview (sequence alignment editing)
Phylip (wonderful suite for phylogeny)
MrBayes (Bayesian phylogeny reconstruction) 

etc. 

Apart from that he can learn Bioperl and Biopython

- every one has individual style of training, and it boils down whether the
majority of the students get good knowledge out of it, or not, which is what
the crux is.

- the original post has asked a solution for one problem, and now the
answers / comments are taking a different route.

- most of us (including me - this instance) starts judging the other person,
when this is not needed, and also to be avoided.

- let us learn from the community of other countries - which will not take a
side, while replying.

I am not getting into any pathos, but, most of the thread gets treated this
way, these days.  I know that i will be getting more replies on this,
(instead of answering the original post), I leave it to individuals.

This is the combination that is part of LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and
PHP) that resulted in Linux and Free software being deployed in edge
servers in the early days.  They have a long history of coordinated
development and work well together.    PHP's support for other databases
have historically been much weaker.

Citation needed.  The earliest referenced instance of the term is

http://web.archive.org/web/20071212203835/http:/www.heise.de/ct/english/98/12/230/

PHP for a long time was inherently tied to MySQL as well. I would note
that LAMP became a evolving acronym where  "P" was substituted with
various languages over time however the combination of Linux, Apache,
MySQL and PHP as LAMP was historically a important marketing and
development initiative by Oreilly, MySQL DB and others that helped
propel Linux in its early days.

Right.  This was 2001 and "P" was being substituted with other languages
at that point

Subject: [fsug-tvm] Free Software ( sharing knowledge ) is in human
nature - an example
To:


https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=78514#c19

The above is a link to a bug fix sent to GNOME, the popular free
software desktop. It shows why free software works, and why people
work on it.

an excerpt from the above link :

"I would like to extend my thanks to the gnome team/community for a great last
moment with my dad.

Adrian Hands (my father) wrote the patch above to improve the usability of
gnome for himself and others. You see my dad was suffering from ALS and his
hands were so crippled he could no longer use a keyboard. Thus we used a Darci
usb morse code keyboard emulator to help him type. Even the morse code device
was a struggle as the sensitivity adjustment and positioning of the nice two
paddled key would fall out of whack. I rigged up a pvc cage that wrapped around
his knee and fixed remote switches to the cage so that he could use the
remaining strength in his legs to operate the Darci morse code device. He used
this last bit of body movement to write this patch."

I am a programmer, and I use free software to earn a living. I do not
know how people who do other things for a living will feel about this,
but I feel deeply honored to use software created by a community in
which people with so much passion contribute so selflessly.

I think it shows why the idea of free software works, and will keep on
working. Its in human nature.

Hi,

             I have an openldap server and I use python-ldap module to
write utility scripts for managing. I need to add about 50-60
users(member attribute) to a groupOfNames objectClass. How should I do
that in python using the ldap module? Will it be something like

attributes['member'] = ["dn for user1","dn for user2"...."dn for usern"]

or should it be done differently ? Thanks

If system->preferences->monitors doesn't show the resolution expected,
then you can try the Nvidia drivers (properitory, but it's fine
atleast nouveau is fully functional.), if you haven't done it
already. Install Livna repository, and do

$ sudo yum install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia

This should fix your problem.

       Figured it out. The above mentioned approach is the way to go.
We need to set arrtibutes['member'] = [all DN's to be added]

Message-ID: <AANLkTik+h0OhpOwiC0v=w0EvxmTPghV=fbN2NqpxesAu@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have been using Huawei's EC1260 Photon Plus for over an year and a half
now. And I was able to completely shift to Linux only after it worked
successfully on the alien platform (alien for the ISP).
The graphical tool that Tata provided along with Photon was capable of
shifting between three modes namely CDMA, HSIA and Dual (meaning both). As
is evident HSIA is supposed to work faster than CDMA. On Linux initially I
connect using wvidial or Network Manager and neither of the to methods
provide me the ability to see or choose the mode in which the Device is
working.
And its been working extremely slow lately, i.e 80-90 kbps (tried at three
locations Delhi Noida and Bangalore).

Awaiting Suggestions / Solutions.

Indian context:

first rule is unless it is an announcement of general interest to
several lists, do not cross post.

secondly if you urgently need a reply for your question, please realise
that the members of these groups are not paid to reply to you. If you
post on several lists, one list may give you the reply you want - all
the others are left hanging wondering what the solution was.

thirdly choose the list most likely to give a result. For me, for things
related to hardware, embedded, kernel, anything related to licenses, and
more arcane things like DRM and patents - Mumbai LUG

programming and software in general - Chennai LUG

python - the chennaipy and bangpypers

local issues - the local LUG concerned

OT trolling and igniting flamewars - Mumbai LUG

If the list chosen does not offer a solution, then try on another list.

(btw, why have you suddenly put a reply-to yourself in your list mails.
most lists are set to reply-to list - but your reply-to overrides this
and I find I am sending replies to you offlist. Please fix this)

Hi,

In empathy, I have multiple gmail accounts online simultaneously. When there
is a contact common among these accounts, it is showed as a meta contact.
When I double click such meta contact, a gmail account is chosen among the
multiple accounts by default.

I could not find a way to change this default account. Web search didn't
give any relevant results. Is there a way to change it??

Recently, I had a chance to try Ubuntu 11.04 in a Dell Netbook(inspiron mini
11) at Tata Croma.
Till I read this mail, I was thinking that I had tested a netbook version of
ubuntu.
Truthfully, I am doubtful whether this UI would catch up. It wasn't much
user-friendly.
The boot screen was interesting. I feel that Ubuntu developers love Mac.
This is evident in each Ubuntu release. Ubuntus looks are being inspired
from Mac.

Why do you have to install by building from source? If all you want is
to just get it installed, there are far more easier ways, or if you
want to learn building from source, go ahead.

Yes you need to have the toolset required to build from source. If you
are on Debian or Ubuntu, you could just install the package
'build-essential' which should install most, if not all the tools
required to build from source.

Hi, I need some advice about our "Server Down" condition. The thing is: our
one development server goes down after certain times. So, what steps may be
included in order to find "for what actual reason" this server is behaving
like this. I am sorry that, I am not finding enough keyword to search in
google, that`s why I am asking you this question.

Actually, which services should I check first if our server goes down?

Yes exactly. I doubt if many people will like the changes including

AFAIK there is no straight forward mechanism. Implement a good logging
mechanism for each of the services, and write a script which monitors each
log and takes periodic backups. Once the server goes down, check the logs.
Other than the log file of each service, monitor the system log too, so that
you can see if the temperature has gone too high (or other reasons).

make sure you check system logs, /var/log/messages, /var/log/syslog etc. 
to find the clues.  Also you might want to enable sar/atsar which gives 
you a report on the resource usage every 10 mins interval or so, which 
could help you to narrow down if its because of server running out of 
memory, being overloaded etc.

Quite a co-incidence. I was on NewEgg about to order a Kingston 80Gb. 
Just yesterday we covered news that Kingston is going aggresive about 
SSDs in India will be launching new series of SSDs for the country. Is 
anyone using one?

SSD is just flash hard disk.

I once got it working but never got time to play with it.

It is not really tiny. I think over time it will become small.

Quite a co-incedence. I am on NewEgg about to order an 80GB as its still 
expensive $200. Deciding between Intel and Kingston -- prolly go with 
Kingston as it is a bit cheaper. We covered a story yesterday where 
Kingston said they are going aggresive about SSDs in India.

IMO the kingstons are really slow when compared to some of the SSD's using
the sandforce 1200 chipset  an ssd like this
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227601 will blow
the Kingston out of the water in terms of performance.

Hi,

Sorry for bugging you again. Muktware will complete one year in April. 
It's an achievement for us, especially for me as after moving from 
India, and quitting LFY, it was a challenge for me to stay connected to 
the FOSS world and continue to contribute in the manner I could -- 
writing and publication. Today Muktware is a well known online 
publication. Thanks to a lot of LUG members who have been guiding me 
through this.

To celebrate one year, we are increasing the payment per-article. Now we 
pay Rs 1,000 or US$ 20 per article. The minimum length is 750 words. We 
are inviting reviews of OpenSuse 11.4. Gnome 3 and other latest distros. 
We are also inviting columns on contemporary issues.

Please help me continue this FOSS journey.

PS: We are based out of Brussels, Belgium. If any of you have plans to 
visit Brussels, please get in touch.

Best
Swapnil Bhartiya

The form factor is not suitable for me as I will be switching it between 
by netbook, laptop and desktop for testing purpose. I may eventually put 
it on my netbook. I was reading reviews and while Kingston/Intel has 
almost no cons, this one is ful of cons.

To answer your question - Linux, SSDs and India? Linux and SSDs do
decently well together. SSDs and India - I think should go well too.

Hi,


     Most of my friends are going to buy an SSD, mostly due to its quicker boot time and random read and write speeds. As far as prices in India, SSDs are definietly costlier, because a 2TB HDD costs 4.7k while a 30 GB Kingston one costs 4k. The kingston is slow, but the intel ones available here is slow. One of the main advantages for laptops is that portability is increased, because the drive will have no moving parts, so no more head crashes. In benchmarking it has been found that even the slowest SSDs are better for everyday use than the fastest 10k WD Raptor drives. So, that might justify the price. Another potential use for an SSD, is using it for the /, /usr, /var/ tm, usr/local, /opt, /srv,etc,. and have /home and other Data storage partitions in a HDD. This is especially useful for servers, where /var on the SSD, makes things quite fast. Also, swap can be kept on the HDD, to reduce wear leveling. I think ext4 with noatime, and /tmp and /var/tmp as RAM Drives, would also reduce wear leveling. Yet to try btrfs...


     Even on a HDD, according to Linus himself, noatime is a good fs option. As a rule, in my all my linux boxes, I edit fstab in such a way, all my partitions, except swap have the noatime option. I also include, two RAM Drives, /tmp and /var/tmp. This is because data in both the partitions, don't need to be stored after a restart.

The Startup Fever seems to be in high pitch. Never before has it been easy to start a company - but still, with all the ideas that we all have, there seems be a gulf between an idea/concept and it becoming a prototype.

The Startup Centre is organizing an event to help aspiring entrepreneurs cross that gulf. We are bringing in a plethora of resources - be it coders, entrepreneurs, designers, to plug in gaps in the resource front to make that prototype happen.

This is slated for the dates of March 25th - 27th at the Startup Centre in Alsa Mall, Egmore.

I've always been a huge fan of the Open Source community, but if there are aspiring coders who thrive in dreams of building the next Quora, of iPhone app of the season, this might be just the right nudge to make it happen.

Hope to see you there. More details at: http://in50hrs.thestartupcentre.com

Vijay

I also include, two RAM Drives, /tmp and /var/tmp. This is because data in both the partitions, don't need to be stored after a restart.

This is no longer necessary atleast in distributions like Fedora which
ship with relatime by default and I believe it is the upstream kernel
default in recent versions as well. Relatime updates access time once
per day or in a batch instead of everytime a file is accessed taking
away the extra latency while not losing the access timestamp feature.

Hi,


     I have 2 hard-disks, a 500 GB with CentOS, and a 250 GB with Fedora. Each has its own grub in the hard-disk MBR. Both are grub legacy. Now, i'm using the bios' start-up boot sequence utility to choose between the two. I would like to keep my 500 gb as the start-up disk and be able to chainload the MBR of the 250 GB. As i;m reinstalling Fedora, should i install its grub in the first sector of the disk, rather than the MBR?

So on your primary grub if you say rootnoveriy (*hd1*,x) would it not work?
I think it should. Just go to the grub command line and try.

Hi,


     You can easily try Sugar in any of the leading distros, like Ubuntu or Fedora. Fedora also has a live educational spin, with Sugar pre-installed. It is called the Sugar on a Stick. You can check that out too. Sugar on windows, is not supported due to ethical controversies. There is an old installer though, which is not current and not recommended, as it does not have any activities. Your best bet would be to install the fedora spin using a virtual machine like virtualbox or vmware.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimgC+My--DBKo5GGtdX5dJdg=DmoU-7Po06LfpS@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Today, the first phase of the FOSS lab setup at Computer Center, MIT was
done with the servers provided by LinuXpert Systems.  64 systems were
installed with Fedora 14 (with around 6400 packages) or Fedora 13 (around
4500 packages) based on the configuration of the system.

Though all the systems were running GNU/Linux (CentOS) earlier, we believe
that this installation with such a large number of packages would make the
students realize the availability of a huge variety of software for each
domain. (When people could not find a pre-installed alternative for a known
proprietary software, most of them switch back to Windows immediately,
without looking for the available packages.)

Thanks to the volunteers from KanchiLUG who helped us in the the process.

Learn PyGTK as Most of the Gnome applications use GTK.
PyQT is used to learn KDE apps.

There are some Alternative for PRO-ENGINEER

1. BRL-CAD   (http://brlcad.org/)
2. Archimedes (http://www.archimedes.org.br/)
3. OpenSCAD (http://www.openscad.org/)
4. LibreCAD   (http://www.librecad.org/)

I'm not sure if I get the context right, but I've been considering going 
for an SSD soon, as my test suite is getting unbearably slow as the 
project expands. Doubling the RAM didn't really buy me any significant 
performance gain. I've heard from quite a few developers that SSDs do 
help a lot in this case.


Vamsee.

SSD's may not help  much if your test suite does a lot of block 
reads/writes. It is great for booting my win7 laptop though.

Ensure you are running a 64bit distro to take full advantage of
additional RAM.


> I've heard from quite a few developers that SSDs do
> help a lot in this case.

Is your computer a laptop or desktop or server?

Is your test suite disk IO bound, network bound or processor bound?

Is the test suite read or write intensive or both?

Can you put in a RAID array with multiple SAS drives to handle the
extra IO load?


Reference performance figures for HDDs:

SATA 7.2k RPM -- 80 IOPs, streaming read and write: 40MB/s and 20MB/s

SAS/FC 15k RPM -- 180 IOPs, streaming read and write: 80MB/s and 60MB/s

SSD -- 3000 IOPs, read and write performance: 100-300MB/s and 100-150MB/s


Unless your OS/disk supports SATA TRIM command, writes to SSD imposes
an erase before write penalty which will kill write performance.

SSD is great for small random IO, but for sequential IO the performance
delta between FC/SAS is smaller.


Some price figures for enterprise SSDs, these typically go into
SAN arrays:

For enterprise storage arrays: 400GB is USD 20,000 list!!
For mid range storage arrays: 400GB is USD 6,000 list!!

You can go for PyQT. It is lot more easier with QT designer.

Just out of curiosity, why is C programming on ARM very different from
C programming elsewhere? The compiler / cross-compiler should do the
needful, right?

Please do correct me if I am wrong.

Thank You.

Yes you are right, but there are more concepts like file read and write
differs, so if that have a guide then it will be easy to move on...

If you suite is disk I/O bound, you will get a significant improvement on a SSD.

> Is the test suite read or write intensive or both?

On SSDs, read and write speeds do not differ as heavily as with
spindle counterparts. IIRC, SSD reads are of the order of 750 Mbps and
writes are of the order of 650 Mbps.

I heared people say that we can do some web related projects using ROR.

I need a good introduction to Ruby on Rails and what all can be done with
it.

Am interested to develop some Web Service Projects. Is RoR a good Option for
this?

I think you can do RAD(Rapid application development) with RoR.

You can make a lot of money very easily with this. ;)

I dunno anything more.

There are plenty more, just do a google search.

What do you mean by "web service projects"? Ruby on Rails is a web 
framework that helps you develop database-backed web applications 
easily. You need to learn a bit of Ruby too, but you can definitely get 
started with Rails without knowing too much Ruby. It's just one way to 
create web applications, there are similar frameworks in Python and PHP 
too.

Rapid *web application* development would be more accurate. Also, 
whether it's "rapid" or not is subjective - it's definitely easy to get 
started with, maybe easier to develop in compared to some of the other 
alternatives.

> You can make a lot of money very easily with this. ;)

That's just a careless and inaccurate answer. Yes, Rails is a "hot" 
technology right now, but how much money you make is directly 
proportional to how much value you create to your employer/client/end 
user. Rails is just a tool, perhaps a very good tool - but you don't 
make any money out of it unless you know how to use it properly.

> I dunno anything more.

When neither of your answers are very helpful (not to mention inaccurate

Thanks for the replies guys, I'd have to say the test suite is both read 
& write intensive - it puts a typical database-backed web application 
through it's paces, right from creating users to uploading 
images/processing videos to running selenium browser-backed tests for 
javascript-heavy parts. Currently it takes 20-25 seconds to run the full 
test suite, which is unbearably slow when you're doing TDD. This after 
plenty of hacks on the Ruby GC settings and other tricks to cut down the 
time as much as possible.


Vamsee.

25 seconds and you are worried? I think the full django test suite takes
5-10 minutes with sqllite.

Do you care if your doctor has an MBBS degree? (This is not a

To work with GNU/Linux or in generally to do programming BE/BS/Degree and
Diploma is not needed. Just common-sense, passion and mentality is only
required.

I care but thats because due to that ....

I know my doctor studied in a college with a hospital attached and
was taught by  practising doctors and that my doctor had hands on
experience as part of his/her college course -- one full year IIRC

None of these apply for Engineers. So ....

yes - because I have yet to meet a self taught doctor. But one of the
best sysadmins I know (who has all the qualifications mentioned above
has a degree in architecture). And a few others do not have a degree at
all.

Just sounds like asking for basic graduation. Just so it does not
affect the morale of the others in the team? Of course, BE/BS is not
quite going to guarantee any sysadmin skills anywhere.

I am working in a hospital - nearly 25 years. I have seen  some doctors with valid degree but to whom I won't be willing to show even my finger nail. On the other hand I trust some semi-literate dressers.

I would still prefer a person with a Computer Science degree. I would
also obviously test him/her for skills and passion, but if she has
spent 4 years doing a CS degree, half attentive in class, and cheated
through exams, I would expect that person to know basics which are
other wise boring and mundane during studying, and hence no one would
self-learn such things.
Many of batch mates for example did not like algorithms as a paper,
but it obviously useful in the industry.

Ah, so we should increase our required qualifications to include only
students who have graduated from colleges which are very strict in
their attendance requirements, like most IITs and NITs in the south?
Indeed, this is what most big (good?) companies do.

And these good colleges (I can debate that IITs are good colleges) do
expose you to valuable lab sessions and difficult problem solving
skills.

with due respect I bank on my experience of nearly 20 years of employing
people in this field. I have yet to find any correlation between a CS
degree and sysadmin (or programming) ability. Only one thing I have
noticed is that EEE and ECE people seem pretty good in this respect.

My apologies for triggering  the instigation.  We would definitely 
consider a non CS candidate if he is really passionate about the work, 
has penchant for technology  and has taken extra efforts to learn things 
on his own.  We highly appreciate the enthusiasm to learn, passion and 
energy one could bring on the board.

I'll revise my requirements accordingly.

Thanks

Like I mentioned, time taken to run test suites becomes important when 
you're doing TDD. This is not as much of a problem for say something 
like a build server/ci tool. autotest does help when adding incremental 
tests (as it watches test files and runs only the changed/added tests) 
but I trigger the full test suite often enough on my workstation (4GB 
RAM, 160GB SATA, Ubuntu 10.10 x32) to make this a pain point. So my next 
iteration of upgrade I think, would be something like 8GB RAM, 
(compatible) SSD, Ubuntu 11.04 x64.


Vamsee.

but do not forget the huge amount of time saved by doing TDD. One can
enjoy a coffee or cricket while the tests run instead of wasting that
time to write realms of code that may or may not work ;-)

well in django one normally only runs the tests for the particular model
one is working on. And when that passes, for the whole app, and when
that passes the whole project. So usually one is only running a small
subset of the test suite.

There is 'autotest' for Ruby/Rails apps, and StackOverflow tells me this 
is the comparable tool for Python:

On your current box run the test suite, data, DB out of a RAM disk
or tmpfs.  A clean chroot test environment on a 4-8GB RAM disk will
work faster than any HDD/SSD.  And much cheaper too.

Sync the RAM disk state to HDD periodically so to ensure persistence.
Syncing can run in background to minimize performance impact.


There are several advantages in not touching disk.  The Mailinator creator
discusses how he reaches extremely high performance on old hardware
using Java by running his app entirely out of RAM:

Hi,

 >What do you mean by "web service projects"?

I would give you a example for a web service :
It is like providing a service over the Web where the service can be used
remotely without mannual intervention.

For example :

" Consider a weather forecasting site which updates the weather report on a
hourly basis and they provide this report as a service where other sites
like NDTV, or any news channels website uses this service to provide
information of the same in their website without any mannual interpretation.
"

Hi All
Sixth ILUGCBE meeting report 

The Sixth meeting of ILUGCBE and one day Python workshop was conducted
at KGiSL Institute of Technology, Saravanampatti on 12th March
2011.Aroung 75 students from two colleges in Coimbatore attended the
workshop(Dr G.R.Damodharan college and KGiSL). 

The workshop started by 09.30 A.M. Jaganadh G, Biju B and Sundaram
Ramachandran was there. We are happy to see that Sundaram Ramachandran
is faculty for FOSS in KGiSL Institute of Technology. Jganadh G gave an
introduction about FOSS and ILUGCBE before the workshop started. After
the introduction we started the hands on workshop session. The students
were very keen to make their hands dirty with Python. All the students
were able to practice the basics of python programming language. Biju B,
Anoop Thomas Mathews, SAtheesh Kumar and Sundaram Ramachandram was
active in helping the students to practice the python examples. The
workshop ended by 04.15 P.M. 

The next item was LUG meeting. Since no other members were present we
discussed some general issues while we walked through the campus.
Sundaram Ramachandran came up with suggestion to help small and medium
office to adopt FOSS. He suggested that we have to create tools for
Pharmacy, Travels to adopt FOSS .

You can very well do so using Rails. Just as easily in Django or CakePHP.
You could provide it as an RSS feed that other apps poll periodically.

As others have mentioned, pls follow posting guidelines.

Subject: [Ilugc] Inclusion of FOSS in MCA curriculum
Message-ID: <AANLkTikDoO1zPjqNfDjkivVkCsJUhsFverrDAm3z6639@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

          There was a workshop on curriculum revision for MCA recently held
at Anna University, Chennai. The main aim of the workshop was to revise the
curriculum for MCA which has not been revised for the past 10 years. As Head
of MCA, Dr.Sivanthi aditanar college of Engineering, i attend the workshop.
We discussed about the various subjects that need to be included into the
curriculum. I suggested Opensource as one, and more others did the same. So
FOSS found its way into the syllabus.

Later while deciding to find a spot for the subject it was decided to have
it added into the syllabus as a laboratory. And more theory based subjects,
relating to foss were added into the elective stream. This curriculum is
sent to AICTE for further consideration. We have also recommended that the
syllabus should not restrict the students about which tool they use in their
lab.

Subject: [Ilugc] Partition Problem while installing Linux
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=HfvASBTOUMfqckF1Mnf7Nf3M6FNjUQbH8GU4K@mail.gmail.com>

I have an HP Pavilion Laptop dm4-1009TU.
Operating System already present as manufactured : Windows 7 home 64bit.
HDD : 320GB
Ram : 4GB
Processor : intel Itanium Processor i5

*Here comes My Problem Statement:*
1. 280GB is set as a Single Drive ' C ' for Windows. Remaining 17GB as
Recovery Partition and the rest for some internal storage.
2. Now i want to install Ubuntu in this laptop as a dual OS, so i tried to
split the 280GB partition into a half by Disk Management tool of Windows
which they provide.
3. After i split it, it says that is unallocated. When i try to use that
partition to create a new file system using the same tool, it shows an error
message stating that " Dynamic Disk or clusters cannot be used to create a
new partition". So again i joined that splitted space into the same.
4. Now i got an idea of trying to resize the 280GB partition by running
Ubuntu as Live. i resized as a half of 280gb and even in this Ubuntu
partitioner it says it is unusable and am not able to change the properties
of this unusable space splitted from it.

Hope, understood my problem.
Finally am trying to create a New Partition Table , Whether it ill leave
windows back as it is or it ill format entire disk even though i resize my
320gb as some logical partitions and leaving the beginning part without
formatting and using other splitted partitions as ext4 file system to format
it?

Please help me. I am now running Ubuntu as Guest in Windows using Virtual
Box.
But i want to use it as Dual os. Need help soon.

creating a new partition table from scratch will obviously remove all the
data and format your whole drive.

there can be faster temporary solutions for your problem by using the guided
partition utility
but you will find it to be perfect only when you tailor your paritions as
per your requirement.

and thanks, you just gave me an idea for my next blog post .. will get back

Message-ID: <AANLkTikiE=UVZR4Fi_O+aN-ELYja+i1rtubu-jSeZbhx@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Friends,

I am glad to announce that today we had a Workshop and FOSS Awareness
programme at I.F.E.T College of Engineering, Villupuram, Tamil Nadu.
Mr. Yogesh - Application developer in Open Source Team at CSS CORP., (
Member of Ilugc and PuduvaiLUG too) with his friend
Mr. Amirthanarayanan - member of both LUGs gave us a good Start of Ignition
towards FOSS.

The workshop was divided into two sessions.
*
Forenoon Session:*

   - History of Linux
   - Open Source and FSF.
   - Distributions of Linux.
   - Community support for Linux.
   - Video of Comparison of Graphical effects of Vista vs Ubuntu ( Youtube
   Link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC5uEe5OzNQ )
   - A short Movie Created using Open Source Software " *Blender* " - SINTEL
   (www.sintel.org)

*Afternoon Session:*

   - Programming Languages available with FOSS/LINUX
   - Final Year Projects should be done on own and not to buy so FOSS is
   good place to start with
   - GCC Compiler  - A quick Demo.
   - Demo on Compiling and Installing ' *tar.gz* ' source compressed files.
   - Package Managers in Ubuntu - Explored some of the packages
   - Showed a Demo on few Interesting and Amazing FOSS Applications ( such
   as SweetHome 3d, Celestia -  http://www.shatters.net/celestia/) and even
   mind blowing games like 0A.D., Lincity, etc.)
   - Installation of Ubuntu Linux and Basic commands to work with it held at
   our FOSS Lab as a Hands on Session.
   - Discussion about Mailing List, IRC, and gave us some valuable advice to
   get started in FOSS for our future.

Our Sincere Thanks to HOD of CSE Ms. S. Nirmala , To let us to get this
opportunity to bring in such a great persons into our campus and made a good
turn up to FOSS.
After this Session most of the students were seriously discussing about FOSS
and even joined the mailing list too. Thanks for creating such an interest
in students of our college.
Again we thank Mr. Yogesh Girikumar and Mr. Amirthanarayan for spending
their valuable time for us. We have planned to start a LUG at our college

Hi,

Can someone explain how video streaming works - i am mainly interested in
how the server works when you click along the timeline of the video. Does
the server span threads/processes to fetch the frame from a specified moment
- how is the load sharing(/scalability) achieved! Do these need custom-OS
for efficient file traversals?

Umm, that kinda defeats the purpose of TDD. When you run the test suite 
basically, the intention is to know that you haven't inadvertently broken 
something that you thought was unrelated by your latest changes. That said 
though, I know that at least when using nosetest you can be selective about the 
tests you run using different patterns such as the modulename, filename, 
testnames, generic regex, only the ones that failed in the last run ...etc. So 
typical workflow is generally run a subset of the tests during development and 
run the entire suite before committing changes -- or at least this is what we 
follow at my workplace.

This is a very interesting approach. Going beyond periodic syncing, one of the 
things I've been planning to try out (although never got around doing) is to 
setup my dev environment (ie: app server including the db) on a ramdisk, which 
is disk backed up as part of a raid to a loopback mounted disk image :) ! 
...this is something suggested by someone on IRC -- not sure of the practical 
benefits, but it sounds like a nice idea.

I'll try to get it done this weekend.

The purpose of TDD is not to check if anything has broken in the app. 
That's the purpose of unit/developer testing in general. Running the 
whole test suite every time you add/modify a test is going to be 
seriously time-consuming (which refers to my 20-sec lag). TDD's purpose 
on the other hand is to allow the discovery of the most 
simplified/testable interface to your app. In other words, TDD is more 
about application design than reliability. Of course, it ends up helping 
the latter anyway.

Not exactly a proper answer to your question, and I'm nowhere near

What?

What do you want to know?

None of your assumptions are correct.

The idea is that the video is distributed using HTTP or RTSP and then
the media is
 UDP multicast or unicast using RTP.

In the case of youtube I think there is no RTP at all.

At any rate read the relevant RFCs. But you don't seem to be
interested in the low level
protocol semantics.

You want to know what happens at the programming/network /CPU usage level.

It is like this(I think, not sure).

When the user seeks to a particular offset in the video, the MPEG
frames at that file offset are
sent.

That is all. No multithreading, no multiple connections. Just one connection.

MPEG as a protocol encodes video in B, P and I frames. Read the MPEG spec.

Actually video streaming is fairly straight forward if you consider
only the higher level protocol.

Just like reading from a disk except that the download happens on
demand rather than all
at one stroke.

For smooth playback you will want to have a few future frames download apriori.

Of course there is more than what meets the eye but this should do for
the moment.

I never assumed anything above - i asked honest questions as i wanted to

And in this case you are not assuming :)
When i talk about file-traversals  or custom-OS, i think i was talking about
UML diagrams and not btree or some other
file structure (!!).

Would like to know the network level  details as much as possible; more than
network level,
i am interested in how the webserver acts with the mpeg file that resides on
the server.

I got the drift, but no concrete course. But you gave me some keywords which

But, having done my homework, my above question remains still unanswered.

Just thought I'd bring closure to this thread. While the RAM usage
wouldn't show up under Buffers/Cache, it did drop to expected use as
soon as I required the extra RAM (by mallocing up a few megabytes).

I assume this is how this hypervisor (the vmware one, I think) works.
Since I have since not noticed any performance issues any more, I think
what I was experiencing was unrelated and so I've decided to just let
things be.

This is how things worked. `free` would report > 900 MB of RAM after
subtracting buffers/cache but when I ate up that last 100 MB or so,
`free` would report ~ 300 MB which is much closer to what I'd expect.
Releasing the memory and then waiting for a long time would result in
that usage jumping again. Swap is untouched at all times. Funny, eh?

Hello Venkatraman,
          If i understand your question correctly, I assume your query is
regarding streaming and believe you know that, In videos  there is something
called progressive media and streaming. Let me explain both to clear things
in Air

          Progressive Media
          ---------------------------
                    This technology is old. The videos are in the usual
location of  webserver. When the user play a video, the entire video is
downloaded to your system cache and the videos are played as and when your
system cache certain limit. Here, after you have watched a video, you can go
to your system cache and watch the video from them.

           Streaming
           ---------------
                Install an app Windows media server/Flash server/Quicktime
server in your webserver and upload the videos there. When the user watches
the video, it is not stored in your system cache.


      I don't think, have a custom OS will send the videos efficiently.
Apparently, it's the internet Traffic that you need to be concerned about.
There are companies which offer products to accelerate the web contents in
the internet. Hope, this helps. let me know, if you need more info

Clever, but it's a terrible idea in terms of performance.  RAID1 assumes
both your disks have similar performance.

The RAID1 driver will ack disk writes only after both disks in the raid
group successfully commit data.  So your write performance is still the
same as that of your HDD.

However, if your IO pattern is primarily reads, you should experience
better than HDD performance.

Since your RAM disk is volatile, your RAID1 array will be in degraded
mode on boot up.  You need to handle this case manually.

> I'll try to get it done this weekend.

Instead of a loopback mount, suggest you use LVM or a raw block device.
That way you minimize the number of layers you need to go through to disk.

Do let us know the outcome.  I would love to be proved wrong ;-)


Btw, there are vendors who retail RAM "disk arrays", eg. ramsan.com.
Works really well for apps high performance apps which do not support
memcached.

You may find the nodejs.org project interesting.  It's a web server and
programming environment built for HTTP streaming (video, xml, text, etc).

Node is a web server with an embedded Javascript engine (the V8
engine lifted from Google Chrome browser).  You write event driven code
on the server side, similar to what JS is traditionally used in the browser.

Node is used for projects where a web server needs to maintain a constant
network connection with a huge number of client web browsers and
stream/push events to them from the server side.  Eg. a web based
instant messaging client.  Doing this using PHP/Python/Ruby/etc would
be very inefficient as apache/web-server would spawn a new process/thread
for every active client connection.

On most servers designed for virtualization, the cost of RAM is often
50% of the entire hardware cost.  Therefore hypervisors employ plenty
of techniques to use RAM efficiently, and you may be observing the
effects of some of these features on your VM.

Thanks for the info, Raja. I suspected this might be the case and just
wanted to eliminate the possibility that there was something wrong with
my virtual machine or with the OS running in it. I'm fairly certain that
this is normal behaviour though, now.

That link of yours is very informative. It would seem that 'Section 3.3
Ballooning' could induce the behaviour I saw but I haven't read it
carefully yet.

May I, as usual, intervene here with another layering within the
"webserver " and "mpeg file that resides on the server"

Now, in a serious media server, clips shouldn't be residing servers.

It should be residing on HA storage (SAN,iscsi, NAS, NFS etc.). Now in
that scenario, that "know the network level  details as much as
possible" in itself is an Industry, per se.

What I had in mind was IT infrastructure for an HA media server.

Typically a pair of physical servers accessing a data store through
copper/iscsi/fibre/FC network etc. would get data at around 4gbps into
the server boxen which is thrown out by the server boxen which would
have many services running within them like iscsi-initiator-d,
multipathd, httpd, usual network deamons etc.

Now one of them would be, httpd, apache webserver which listens on the
VIP provided by your HA hardware. and you can put apache under a
cluster managed service an application server like tomcat etc can be.
Databases like oracle, postgresql, mysql etc can made active passive
configuration.

One can have underlying sybsystems like CLVM etc.which can host HA
clustered filesystems as GFS, OCFS etc. which makes a lovely base for
having a samba/NFS share.

Now who mincemeats the URL is httpd and its handlers' headache.

Apache (Linux process name: httpd) just knows that so and so file is
stored in a certain filepath which usually points to external storage
(when seen from within that box) mounted on the some suitable
mountpoint on physical servers's filesystem.

Now, from UML perspective etc., a little later.

I vaguely remember seeing somewhere in one of those pdf's hosted on
the AICTE website wherein AICTE Urges the institutions (I think
somewhere in the IT requirement conditions that an institution had
meet like 1 computer per student norm etc.)  who want to register to
use Free Software, or some phrasology, way long back circa 2005-8.

Let us call it, The APJ effect at the time.

Haven't checked lately.

Can other members who are in Academia cross check it please and let
the list know?

This can be a scene changer in the education like:
Are we equipping our future IT Masters with the right tools to cross
the laberynthine mazes of  business rules
and
build into them the necessary love they must have for the technology
throughout their life.

I am eagerly awaiting that to happen to Mumbai University too. sigh.

How I wish guys at TIFR and the such Free Software in Mumbai (being
the financial capital) increase their visibility in the industry also

and learn to explain to corporate that free software is not evil.

Free Software gives Enterprises a very strong IT muscle to flex and
wring out the best from their IT Infra.

The same can be thought about in the academia from IT management perspective.

It would be very interesting if the members shared their experiences
on this matter.

Support costs for free software need not be as expensive as non-Free  Software .

 may or may not be evil depending on the case to case basis - They are
into a business which uses IT as a tool, see.

in active engagements with the colleges periodically be visible etc.

Above all IMHO.

Dear luggies
The Management of a college is keen on using FOSS. They have asked about the FOSS tools relating to assembly language used in Microprocess/microcontroller - similar to MASM/TASM.

What are the alternatives to MASM and TASM?

If someone is willing to give a session on such tools please contact me offline.

One of the reasons I added the `ill-defined' in my post.
This seems an interesting problem though.
--One does want to ensure that a change has not broken anything, but
can that be done by ONLY testing where a breakage is possible? Sounds
really hard problem to solve.

Yeah; TDD is not just regression testing. But using such labels which
were defined in a context where coders wrote code and testers tested that
code is one of the areas of some confusion in the understanding of TDD
at least to me, for a time.

I tend to think of TDD as exploratory development and best suited for those
situations when part of the solution is NECESSARY for defining the
problem itself and/or the exact approach to solution is yet unclear.

Thoughts?

Glad it helped.

While you are at it, could you please activate an instance of
BigBlueButton on that test box?

If you want HA, well, I may be able to answer questions here.

I am surprised that the entire software community is either ignorant
of HA or takes it for granted and does not help bring down the cost of
HA.

That will help us power many mini data centres.

For example, A power fencing device costs around 35k INR. For what
exactly: few Power sockets (a very good industrial/rugged available
for may be around 70 to 500 INR) which are controlled using a snmp
ethernet (wired and wireless) port .and some snmp stuff thrown in. Had
in mind Arduino and embedded linux.

The mass production cost for such a device should not cross say 1000
INR. Call it "Internet Power Socket" .

The requirement definition could be one BCA Project, Design could be
another and the such.

I feel (and know) that the Institutions Indian Academia/IT industry is
not at all helping Indian business to realize their full IT
infrastructure value.

Nor are they utilizing the existing SSI infrastructure. Free software
too should look into this issue.

How can Industry take Academia seriously?

In fact Indian IT/ITES giants with cash to spare should come forward
and pour some money in here proactively.

Above IMHO.

Message-ID: <6cad473f7e45a10fbfd424a05f90c59a.squirrel@www.glug4muz.org>

Hi,
 When I am executing a php code like below:

<?php
 $timestamp=mktime(0,0,0,3,1,2011);
 echo $timestamp;
?>

on Linux and Windows system then there is always a difference of 19800 in
output. The result shown on Linux system is always 19800 less than the
value displayed on Windows system. But theoretically output on both
systems should be same because the number of seconds elapsed since
01/01/1970 to 03/01/2011 should always be same on both operating systems.
Can any one please explain the reason behind this difference.

Have you checked the timezone on both the machines?
19800 seconds = 5.5 hours
See http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=19800+seconds+in+hours
Maybe both your machines have different time zones?

19800 is exactly 5.30 hours which is IST to GMT offset.

Your Linux box is reporting UTC timezone while Windows is showing
localtime.  It is common for Linux to set hardware clock to UTC and
use timezone data to calculate local time.  Windows systems set the
hardware clock itself to local time.  Windows/Linux dual booting systems
also run into this issue.

Set the TZ environment correctly before you call mktime.
See the Errors/Exceptions section of the manual:
    http://php.net/manual/en/function.mktime.php

Can you please explain how to customize the Linux system to set the
hardware clock to local time? I am using Open SUSE 11.0 on my system.

When you install Suse, the installer will give you the choice of setting
hardware clock to local time or UTC.

Best refer to Suse docs on clock setting. Here is the first search result
from Google:

Subject: [Ilugc] Two Day National Level Workshop on NS-2 in Chennai
Message-ID: <AANLkTimupA_K5xbvrX7gF5X6EDxo6UnBs3ADdHJOqetC@mail.gmail.com>

About NS-2 :

NS or the network simulator (also popularly called NS-2, in reference
to its current generation) is a discrete event network simulator. NS
is used in the simulation of routing protocols, among others, and is
heavily used in ad-hoc networking research. ns supports popular
network protocols, offering simulation results for wired and wireless
networks alike. It is popular in research given its open source model
and online documentation. However, modeling is a very complex and
time-consuming task in ns-2, since it has no GUI and one needs to
learn scripting language, queuing theory and modeling techniques. Of
late, there have been complaints that results are not consistent
(probably because of continuous changes in the code base) and that
certain protocols are replete with bugs.

NS was built in C++ and provides a simulation interface through OTcl,
an object-oriented dialect of Tcl. The user describes a network
topology by writing OTcl scripts, and then the main NS program
simulates that topology with specified parameters.

I don't think that's such a big problem in general; we write failing 
tests first and then add code in TDD, though this is not always 
practical or possible. What I think you're referring to is a bigger 
problem, as to how much should we test (or how much coverage to have in 
other words). There is no hard and fast rule here - while 100% test 
coverage is great, it's hardly practical or recommended in most cases. 
We pick the places where we want to make sure the app performs as 
expected - and go easy on the places where it's not so important for the 
effective functioning of the app. It's a trade-off, but usually having 
the discipline to write tests means that (whether TDD or not) the app 
will be reasonably bug-free (ahem).

Personally, I'm not an XP/Agile fanatic - while I find the general 
guidelines very helpful, I'm not a strict adherent, I should admit :). 
Especially in a startup scenario, where speed of execution is so 
important, one has to be very judicious about where to put the extra cycles.

Actually, for me at least practically speaking, it's been the other way 
round - TDD helps me when I'm know what to expect fairly well - which 
means that I know what to check for, see the tests fail and write the 
supporting code. But when it comes to say, something like writing a 
fairly complex javascript-driven UI, I find TDD less compelling, not 
because it's not useful, but I don't know what to test for some of the 
times. It's likely a new plugin or a UI component/approach I'm trying on 
for the first time, which is a big part of what I do. Insisting on TDD 
at this stage becomes tedious, because I don't even know how to 
configure/use this component or in some cases, how it behaves. So I just 
finish the part and then write selenium tests. Again, it's a trade-off 
:). Perhaps if there is a reliable (and fast way) to test javascript 
headlessly, I might not have to break the TDD discipline, but we still 
have a ways to go (at least in the Rails world) for that.


Vamsee.

Friends,
I try to install moodle under linux 14. I have extracted files. But to
install the file
I have to run the install.php.
When I give the following command from the browse
       http://192.168.20.76     or http://localhost.localdomain
 I got test page of apache fedora.
But I issue the command
       http://192.168.20.76/install.php or
http://localhost.localdomain/install.php
 I got following error message
       forbidden. You don't have permission to access. install.php
I have stored all the files under /var/www/html only.
Can any one help me.
My thanks in advance.

Murugan

The problem may be is that /var/www/html 's owner will be root . So it 
was forbidden to normal user . So change the ownership to you , so it 
can be accessed by you ,

chown -R username /var/www/html/

Run this as root user in terminal .

I hope this would help you .

I have got errors like these but not while installing moodle. May be this is
a general issue. Use chmod to check if you got the right permission levels
on those folders. While you are doing the install make sure you are root or
issue your command line with sudo.

Message-ID: <722291.63322.qm@web94615.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

Dear luggies

On behalf of ILUGC three sessions were done in this week. 

1.16 Mar 2011: College: Karpagavinayaka College of Engg and Tech, Mamandur near Chengalpattu. It was for ME students (about 38). The session covered basics of perl. It was hands on.

Faculty members Mr.Sivaraman and Mr.Anandan were instrumental in organising this workshop.

2. 18 Mar 2011: GKM College of Engg, Perungalathur near Tambaram. It was an introductory session on FOSS covering philosophy, installation, common software and introduction to perl.  About 60 students of 3rd year and 4th year CSE attended.
Faculty member Mr.Manickam was instrumental in organizing this.

3.19 Mar 2011: Adhiparasakthi College of Engg, Kalavai, Vellore dist.
It was an introductory session covering introduction, common software, python programming and FOSS projects. The python and common software session was hands-on. The python session was handled by Selvamani and common software handled by Praveen.

Faculty member Ms.Kavitha was instrumental in organizing this.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank the College Managements for the opportunity.

There are opportunities galore - especially with forthcoming foss lab paper. ILUGC needs lot of PHYSICAL volunteers. Whoever, is willing please mail Shrini. In my opinion we  need atleast a 25 members.

Hi Arun, This may be helpful i think so

If you want to give access to this for others then make it the www-data as
the owner of the /var/www/html/

this is the default apache permission.

1. Which college would that be?

2. Which parts of FOSS?
    2.1 What is the current level of
          knowledge and exposure?

3. It is commonly considered rude to type
    in all caps--similar to shouting.

Nothing to offer,, really.

But it seems that the faculty in the remoter Colleges seems to like
having annual event. Hence they are asking their students every year
perhaps.

On the other side, some of them would like to show off their
discoveries such as webserver apache, moodle, koha etc. That is an
opportunity for us free software enthusiasts should cash in. and enter
the small business while we are at it. A live cd with some business
application such as small accounting, counter bill peinting
aaplication thrown in, can be distributed and demonstrated off the
campus in a small (preferably influential and popular) shop/business
and everybody wins.

Of course, then there is an opportuinity for ego-massaging of the
respective HOD, Pricipal, director etc. After all those while
elephants thrive on such inpout from Industry/Community.

OTOH, even if the request is a blatant offer to ego-massage. So be it.

What says the members?

There are many business potential in the education industry (yeh now it is an industry) esp. in TN

1.Setting up proxy, firewall and maintaining them
2.Setting up library management software
3.Student information system
4.Setting up and maintaining college website
5.Setting up centralised learning materials management -moodle
6.Most colleges are going in for so called 'smart class room'. Plenty of opportunity for innovative solutions

In a college I heard that a company maintaining firewall and proxy charges Rs.50k as AMC.

Greetings,

Please note that there are participants from at least 14 countries
apart from India that too within few weeks of announcement.

http://kohacon11.vpmthane.org/ocs/index.php/k/k11/schedConf/registration

Surely the students and practiioners too will gain a lot.

I am planning to experiment and present CentOS as a robust High
Availability Platform for Applications like KOHA/DRUPAL etc. I don't
know what I will Land up with though over the course of time.

Some of the question I am looking at in a practical viewpoint of an
Application and IT infrastructure Architect are:

1. We need to look at lifetime of the application like KOHA - perhaps
10 year in the timeline of a library?
2. Is the quick changing Fedora/Ubuntu stand the trial?
3. What is the interaction between DSpace etc?
4. Can they both be running in HA peacefully?
5. etc.

If so please reply on this list.

I must declare that I am not going to invest INR(Money) in this. I
can't afford HA hardware at this point of time.

Would anybody like to join me in presenting a paper or experimenting?

Perhaps two different department can jointly decide to own one server
each and bring it together for HA demo teaching purposes and then use
it later individually or using the HA setup for themselves and to
educate next gen of the students.

few more to add

1. Setting up LTSP, if the college has too many low configuration computers
2. As per the new AICTE regulations, the colleges should have multimedia
based digital library esp. for NPTEL videos.  DSpace with video streaming is
a good option.
3. Some colleges/universities are looking for asset management, so there is
a place for OCS inventory NG.

Very often the FDP run by FOSS--Python/SciLab for Scientific and
Engineering Computations--is an exercise to add a line to be read
in the annual report of College/Department.

But we do it nevertheless because at least some students get
into FOSS/Python as a result.

With a few gratifying exceptions, faculty are usually not
really interested much in these as teaching tools. Some
faculty members doing research do get interested.

I am all for doing these sessions, whatever be their
reason for hosting it

Please define your concept of High Availability  -  people have
different ideas on these buzz words.

I think 10+ years is a reasonable time frame.  Version upgrades surely
but changing to some other package - the migration cost could be
prohibitive.

> 2. Is the quick changing Fedora/Ubuntu stand the trial?

Don't know what you mean by this.   IMO anybody using Fedora as a
server platform and that too in production ... I know people are doing
it ...  In one instance, I was forced to install a version of Fedora
(which was no longer supported at that time) because the vendor's app
was certified only on that version!

> 3. What is the interaction between DSpace etc?

IMO, if ERP apps can run in VMs then Koha and DSpace can also run in
respective VM.

What is HA hardware?   Do you really need enterprise grade servers to
demonstrate your Proof of Concept or present your paper?  For a Proof
of Concept this can be achieved with mid range desktop(s) that support
Linux KVM.  (system board + cpu cost 13-15K).

> Would anybody like to join me in presenting a paper or experimenting?

I think it would be better if you first present an executive summary
of your paper/experiment.

Subject: [Ilugc] FOSS - for making MONEY
Message-ID: <AANLkTinBw1xV+NMV_wQwdxdRuoLMpspU=NQmRRih=Pnq@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Friends

  There's been a lot of discussion on FOSS and trainings on several threads
from various FOSS enthusiasts.

  Can someone give a few *examples* of *how FOSS could be used to earn a
living* - in addition to setting up computer labs & developing applications
using FOSS.

  In other words, Can we make use of *readily available* *FREE software* to
*make money* - this might help someone seriously look at FOSS for MONEY -
also might attract more people towards FOSS? (I do understand that money
must not be the deciding factor in one's career choice)

  The reason why I ask is that it is the MONEY that is the most important
motivating factor in one's career choice  - that's the primary reason why we
see so many fresh engineers and graduates dying to get placed in an IT firm.

  If we have some real life examples in the form of entrepreneurs here, that
would be great.


Thanks

Vanitha

Hi,

FOSS Training, Consulting and Deployment are good
money-spinners to start off with - in my opinion. I've
been earning and making a living out of them for the last
8 years (after I quit my last job sometime in 2002).

When I meant Training - I also meant corporate training.
Many companies in the recent years (both big and small)
have been looking at FOSS based solutions in their
organizations.

As of today, good skills on technologies like Python, Perl,
Ruby, Linux, MySQL/PostgreSQL, NetBSD/FreeBSD, and the whole
plethora of web technologies based on FOSS (Django, RoR,
CodeIgniter, etc) are still in great in the industry.

Having said that, there is an acute scarcity of knowledgeable
resources in these area. Thus, most companies resort to
updating skillsets of their existing workforce to tackle
challenges in developing and/or deploying using FOSS by means
of corporate training. So, there *is* a great demand for
experienced, highly competent and industry proven corporate
trainers in various FOSS technologies.

There are niche FOSS related projects and technologies for
which companies cannot easily hire a resource personnel,
they often resort to hiring contract developers, consultants
or administrators.

 > In other words, Can we make use of *readily available*

 > seriously look at FOSS for MONEY - also might attract more
 > people towards FOSS?

There are many FOSS enthusiasts like me who make a living by
working as freelance consultants on various FOSS technologies
for contract development, consulting, administration/deployment,
and corporate training. I'm a 'live' and kicking example of
"how to make money *only* using FOSS" :-). I'm self employed,
pay my house rent, taxes and raise a family without a company
id card for the last 8 years. Last year, I started off my
own company with an intent to contribute back to FOSS in
someway or the other and to enlighten many more people about
living a life without a "name-some-big-company-here" identity
badge.

There are many others like me in this list too. All others
like me - please raise your hands :-D

The point is - making money from FOSS is possible provided
that you have the skills, experience, maturity, patience and
passion towards what you are doing.

 > (I do understand that money must not be the deciding
 > factor in one's career choice)

In an ideal world, it is not. But in a country like ours,
if you have a dream/passion to achieve something - you need
*money* first... fast... and lot of it :-). Else, you
will be consumed into /dev/null too soon! I've been there,
rebooted and did renice my priorities.

 > The reason why I ask is that it is the MONEY that is the
 > most important motivating factor in one's career choice  -

Unless you are an idealist saint like RMS, you'll need money,
and to earn money - you need a decent job first, and to
get a decent job, you need a nice "IT" graduation tag to
begin with - this has been the easiest mantra since the
mid '90s.

And in a competitive country like ours - you can't be an
idealist without being financially self sustainable - as
mentioned, you'll either be quarantined in /lost+found,
mv'd to /dev/null or overwritten (rather corrupted)
by /dev/urandom.

 > If we have some real life examples in the form of

There are many successful FOSS entrepreneurs here. I'm a
just a small and budding example, right now :-)

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

Producing open source software:

 * Qt had it's code dual licensed, they sold commercial licenses.
Then TrollTech was bought by Nokia, so the shareholders made money
there too.
 * Ghostscript had a deal with FSF to make the latest-but-one version
GPL, but they sold the latest version with a commercial license.

Using open source software:

 * A graphics artist using GIMP will make money the same ways as
someone using Photoshop.
 * A journalist using OpenOffice is selling his articles.

Selling/supporting open source software produced by others, you get
paid for your expertise:

 * Setting up an office.
 * Handling installation, system administration.

I'm not a real-life example, but the company I work for has some open
source software, not sure we directly make any money from it though.

What's In It for Me? How Your Company Can Benefit from Open Sourcing Code

As the open source community continues to clamor for more companies to
open source their code, more and more executives are asking themselves
just what open source can do for their company. There are a number of
ways for a company to open source an internal project: from tossing
code over the wall on the one hand to running a fully open development
project on the other to any combination of the two.

This talk will discuss the costs and benefits associated with each
method as well as how to successfully launch your new open source
project.

Text from the gnome.org


GNOME is an innovative Free Software desktop. It is easy to use and is the
most popular desktop distributed with free operating systems.

In an effort to get more women involved in Free Software, the GNOME project
is sponsoring several internships for women from May 23 to August 22, 2011.
The application deadline for the program is April 8. The applicants need to
get in touch with individual GNOME projects ahead of time to decide which
project they are interested in working on. The stipend for the program is
$5,000 (USD).

Participants will work remotely from home, while getting guidance from an
assigned mentor and collaborating within their project?s team and the rest
of the GNOME community. The projects include developing software for the
core desktop, file management, messaging, popular applications, educational
activities, and the platform libraries. There are also non-coding projects,
such as graphic design, documentation, and marketing. The program is open to
students and non-students alike.

In addition, GNOME will participate in the Google Summer of Code program
this year, which sponsors students working on many different Free Software
projects.

Please visit http://www.gnome.org to learn more and apply. The mentorship
opportunities are also available throughout the year for anyone interested
in getting started contributing to GNOME outside of the internship program.

There was no deal with FSF.  They were the sole copyright holders and
don't require permission or deals with anyone in such a situation.

Greetings,

At the outset let me thank all the replies to the thread.

We are talking about less than 2% conversion rate here. That is not enough.

I was thinking about pleasantly shocking the senses out by
demonstrating with a low cost fencing device to build a  HA destop
cluster and a floating a VM across boxes as the basic setup for homes
by showing a live video while live migrating VMs: Two decent desktops
with about say 1 gig memory would do for time being with a thin clinet
or an old desktop acting as a front.to the cluster.

One should see it to believe it. It probably has the most lasting
impact on the user.

You may suddenly get >25 seriously willing adaptors immediately after the show.

I know that VMware can do it. In fact hey use this tricks to inject
into the CEO's (the one with the money ) mind. The CTO often learns
implements the technology in an Elephan't loin-cloth (yanai komanam in
tamiz and Haati ka langot in hindi) emergency budgets and does a
mating dance with the cluster for about two years till he gets the
hang of it. After all he has to plogu through this to the fresh
"bright graduates" from Inidan university.

If I am sounding a little cynical about Educational system, I request
the Academic Gods to ignore it as a meaningless chatter from an  HSC
('80) student. I do not wish to reveal my academic credentials further
than that.

If I am sounding a little cynical to the people from industry, I have
seen it from more from the ground than from the rarified air of ego
filled and very afraid IT Management which is crushed between the
sometimes valid and sometimes 'ridiculous' requests on the one hand
and their own knoledge and resource constraints imposed by the
selfsame CEO who ordered it in the first place.

More discussion and ideas can help us build a solid idea base for
future generations.

India has been a leading knowledge generator and vendor for over 10,000 years.

Tolkappiam / niti shastra / artha shastra / yoga / Ayurveda did not
emerge out of a vacuous society.

They were are by pracitioners and not by pure academics sitting in
their ivory towers.

An oh they did not have that "university degree" or whatever it may
churning out money for the institutions and useless graduates who have
to undergo extensive and intensive training to about 12-18 months on a
live projects before they can talk about technology they know.

It is an opportunity to re-look at and re-calibrate our pedagogy,
industry interface, concerned individuals and small businesses to come
together and have a trusted, resilient across geographical borders and
acting like a true intellectual warrior, an intellectual kshatriya",
as it were. No single points of failure in the technology and the
support.

If the above sounded like a sermon, I apologise for wasting your time.

Above are my perceptions and humble opinions.

Warm regards,

Rajagopal

Oh! you are talking about Alfresco, pentaho etc.?

That is indeed a great idea.

Throw in an instance of Bigbluebutton, webmail, calender, admin tools
to manage 1000s of users, provisioning tools, Repository and the such.

They are also after all Java based and we have a JBoss with many ha features.

In fact we can dream of having finely tuned Redhat MRG (sources are
available) as a platform in a campus.

One sheds tears of blood when on'e tax money is wasted away by some
egotistic moron who has been ego-massaged in in some vendor's
conference wiht all the goodies and the such as the vendors like to
influence the minds of people who influence youn minds of India (Over
50% population uner 30 years of age).

I can talk freely here because many of us have somehow managed to get
our head out of sand and have tried to swim the ocean of technology
rather than that expensive upgrade rollercoster imposed by the vendors
and hope I will not not be misunderstand.

Again above imho.

Indeed. That is why they are _very_ bad choices. I forced a software

Indeed. but for VMs to be available you need HA below that.

One example:
a power fencing pdu with an ehternet port should do (25-35K INR) .

I would certainly prepare that. but before I commit any more time, I

it is enough - those two people will soon be giving their own talks to

Who do you refer to as "they" above?  Aladdin released Ghostscript
under the AFPL, and only old releases were made available under the
GPL.  The versions released under the GPL were called GNU Ghostscript.
 In either case, that's an example of someone making a living by
producing free software.

Still it is better to be clear than assume that everybody else has the
same understanding of the concept.  The OP is looking for
collaborators and interested parties should know the assumptions he is
making and the direction he wants to go.  A reference URL would be
sufficient :)

Aladdin, who were the sole copyright holders of Ghostscript invented the
dual licensing model.  You claimed that Aladdin had a deal with FSF.  I
don't see any evidence of that.

You didn't see any evidence to the contrary either.

Quoting from http://devlinux.org/deutsch-interview.html#sec6

    "[...] I promised Stallman in writing that all future versions of
Ghostscript
     would be released with the GPL."

If you provide the claim, I am not going to look for evidence to the
contrary.  That wouldn't make sense.

Is this what you are referring to as a deal with FSF?  This is merely a
informal arrangement with RMS at best.    If you are a copyright holder,
how you license your software is your sole discretion.

You didn't ask for citations or evidence, you asserted that the

you knew what you were talking about.

So, a promise made to someone in writing is not a deal, but an
informal arrangement?  Is that your objection to what I originally
wrote?  Should I have said "Peter Deutsch, the creator of Ghostscript
had an informal arrangement (in writing) with RMS to release it under
the GPL (and transfer copyrights to the FSF), but used to release the
latest version under a different license"?

Yes,  I was aware that there wasn't any deal (asking for citation for
this isn't useful because noone can prove a negative)  more
importantly,  I think there is a confusion over copyright and copyright
licensing.  See below.

My objection to your understanding is that I don't believe that there
was  any copyright transfer to FSF.   Aladdin held the copyright and
licensed it under GPL and various other licenses but never transferred
copyright which is the entire basis of their business model.   It is
possible to practise dual licensing without copyright transfer but only
if the contributed portions are permissively licensed which was not the
case for Ghostscript.

You can't be "aware" of a negative, unless you can prove it.  In that
case you were only unaware of the deal, which you post facto decided
to call "an informal agreement", despite it being characterized as a
written promise.

Again, do you have any evidence to back up your belief?  Or should we
just take it at face value?  Looking at the releases in
http://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/gnu/ ... version 2.3 was
"Copyright (C) 1988 Richard M. Stallman", version 4.03 was "Copyright
(C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc."  In 2004, Ghostscript
left the GNU project and changed it's name from GNU Ghostscript to GPL
Ghostscript.

The rest of your of your statements are non-sequiturs to what I said.
True, but irrelevant to the points you were replying to.

Now, unless you have something to add based on facts you are aware of,
you are just trolling.  Please don't do that, it just wastes
everybody's time.

I don't see it characterized as a written promise.  If you are aware of
a written promise, then do point me to it.  Otherwise, I have no reason
to believe that.

Nope.  See below.

Yes.  This is not a coincidence.  Aladdin started practising dual
licensing at this point.   FYI,  a joint copyright is not the same as
copyright transfer.

> The rest of your of your statements are non-sequiturs to what I said.
> True, but irrelevant to the points you were replying to.

It is very much relevant to the business model.,  That is the primary
point you are missing.   If Aladdin did transfer copyright to FSF,  how
can it license the code under a different license?  The basis of my
argument is that  if a entity is practising dual licensing as a business
model,  they must either have sole copyright of the entire codebase or
any third party contributions must be under a permissive license.  If
Aladdin transferred copyright to FSF,  they simply would have no legal
right to license the code-base under any other license.  The mere fact
that they did is proof that no copyright transfer happened and you are
wrong.  As simple as that.

I've already linked to, and quoted the relevant source.

This is what you initially tried to refute:

     * Ghostscript had a deal with FSF to make the
       latest-but-one version GPL, but they sold the latest
       version with a commercial license.

I could keep chasing you around as you continue making new
assertions, but this has gone on long enough.

No new claims were made.  I merely refused yours.  You have failed to
address my point which is that Aladdin could not have transferred
copyright to FSF and practised dual licensing at the same time.  I rest

This is not a recent phenomenon in my case. I started consulting for
corporates in 1996/97 moving their infrastructure to open source
replacing M$. I did that for 7 long years and fairly successfully.

I know a few ILUGC members belong to the 80s era and have dabbled with

Subject: [Ilugc] Ubuntu Network Manager Wifi problem
Message-ID: <AANLkTinre+dY4ZV6ZaNA2vjw14nAkNNVGZRD7eJoR_HY@mail.gmail.com>

Hardware - Dell Mini 1012
OS - Maverick
Wifi - Broadcom

My issue:
1. I suspend the PC by closing the lid while Wifi is alive.
2. I move across physical locations to a diffferent Wifi network and
power up the machine from suspend state.
3. NM showing trying Wifi to the configured SSID but fails.

Diagnosis:
It seems like the NM is using the previous WiFi network settings for
security to connect to this network/SSID. Reason - it shows an alert
connecting to the correct SSID but the failure alert for this
connection shows the earlier SSID.

Actions tried:
1. Restart networking and NM - same problem.
2. System restart resolves the issue.

Need:
I hate this hammer approach and feel there must be an elegant way.
Does anyone have experiences solving such an issue?

In50hrs is an event, loosely based on several existing formats of
weekend prototyping events.
This is aimed at entrepreneurs, hackers / developers, and people with
a flair for design and business models.
We believe these are three essential elements for any form of startup.
The event brings together these three folks, in a structured manner
with appropriate help from mentors
(people running successful startups) who will periodically assist and
guide to build out the prototype of that killer idea of yours.

For more info,

Here is the mentor list.

Some mentors have built their organizations using Free Open Source Software.

This event will be so useful for developers/entrepreneurs to build
their ideas into products.

Try, stopping networking services (ensure that the
wifi interface is brought down) and do modprobe -r on
the wifi driver module and reload them (using modprobe).
This technique worked on my Slackware running on ASUS
1201T for a similar problem.

Haven't tried on Ubuntu though. On Slackware, I do not
use NetworkManager. I'm using good old iwconfig tool
(created my own custom network service management
script using this) and it works pretty well for me.

Chandrashekar.

If a company is not looking at FLOSS, they are looking at doom of
facing customer attrition because the cost of doing business will
escalate dramatically considering a lot of business
nano,micro,mini,small, medum, large, MNCs etc have started taking IT
for granted. So much so that even places of worship have treating IT
availability like a utility like water, electricity, et. al.

Am I pulling this out of thin air? perhaps.

Try unloading and then reloading the broadcom/wifi modules. There might be
more than one. If that works you can probably automate unloading the modules
using the suspend infrastructure you are using (pm, s2disk, etc.)

Subject: [Ilugc] Need help in releasing an Open source Device/App
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=gr-zxdA2BKWw-rdTwSVnm4b6uvcN=ymR9Dnpp@mail.gmail.com>

Some time ago, I had mentioned on this list that I am making an open source
device for the hearing impaired. It's no serious high tech stuff, but
something I think will make the quality of life of children with hearing
disabilities a little better. Just a small summary of the device-

"The only way to get the attention of a bunch of kinds with hearing
disability is by getting one of the child to get eye contact with you"

A local paging system consisting of-

   - A 2.4GHz transmitter connected to a PC. This acts as the message
   transmitter.
   - A 2.4GHz receiver in a battery powered hand held unit with a 2 line LCD
   display to show the message. (Should be made very small eventually if mass
   produced)
   - Later - A small graphic LCD to display messages in local language.
   - Broadcast message to all units and Point message to single unit.
   - Range around 100 ft. (Can be increased by parallel transmitters placed
   around the campus)
   - Vibrator to get attention in the hand held unit.
   - Hardware is based on Arduino

A prototype unit is ready and it works. The cost is less than Rs.800 even
during prototyping. Cost was the major factor in my design. It is targeted
at countries like ours. Mass production can make it easily affordable by
even small schools. Even without mass production I believe corporate
sponsorship can easily get it into schools.

I hope by releasing the entire stuff (Hardware circuits, embedded software
and PC side software) as open source, this can really grow and inspire a lot
of other spin offs which an individual cannot think about. Also, I would
like to get active participation (even if not technical) to brainstorm on
ideas which could have been left off.

OK, coming to my request - I have no time as I am stuck with my bread and
butter work. I somehow squeezed my time to get the prototype off the ground.
I don't know anything about open source standards or starting an open source
project. I am sure this thing will take months to come into the open if I
work on it. I need a small group to take this forward. I will provide
technical support at whatever stage. I need this group to manage the open
source side. Once we get this up, and get some ideas in if I have missed
something, I can commit on the PCB design and even make a few distributable
prototypes.

The following is not related to anything with this list, so please excuse me
and ignore if you feel so...
I wanted to wait till I make my millions before I do my duties to society.
The wait has taken too long and will take more! So I decided to give what I
have. Technology. I call upon fellow techies to do the same... I recently
heard about a friend's conversation with a blind person who was pissed with
the fact that whenever he approached a technologist/company with an idea,
they are immediately calculating the profits and sales figures and don't
take it up. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. I run my own business
too. But I think collectively if we contribute simple small working ideas, I
am sure they will add up to make a huge difference to a poor society like
ours.

Arun

OK, I realise the message was too long :) So here is a gist. If interested,
read the whole mail...

I have developed a local paging system based on arduino and 2.4Gz radio
modules. This is aimed at schools for the hearing impaired. It is very low
cost and am releasing it in open source, both hardware and software. I don't
intend to manufacture it either, but will provide all tech support. Anybody
is free to do so.

I need help in releasing the project open source. Take care of the entire

Subject: [Ilugc] configuring database
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=Az5UzXrXgJBeCnePo5h2A3HNM5OryX_0c6ZN=@mail.gmail.com>

Friends,
I have been installing moodle under Fedora. When I configure the
database I got following error message

Error: Database connection failed

It is possible that the database is overloaded or otherwise not
running properly.

The site administrator should also check that the database details
have been correctly specified in config.php

Warning: mysqli::mysqli(): (28000/1045): Access denied for user
'murugan'@'localhost' (using password: YES) in
/var/www/html/lib/dml/mysqli_native_moodle_database.php on line 75


What I should do to solve this problem?
thanks

Are you able to connect to your Mysql database using command line
client from the System on which you have installed the PHP code
plonks?

Why could you verify the connection manually via , mysql or via phpmyadmin .

Hopefully when you could access this user in mysql via phpmyadmin ,
you could finish up with  problem.

Let me start by saying that I'm  no big php/css wiz to be hacking themes...
But I'll try... I did ask for a comspec domain but admin coordinators
refused. And the event is over. So I'm probably going to host my own site
using free hosting. So I'm learning html, php and js from scratch. Thanks

Hi Mr.Elango,

I hope you are getting CUI mode but not your GUI.
If that is the case then just do a file system check using the command
" fsck ".
This will check for any bugs in filesystem and will try to fix it.
Whenever a bug is about to fix it will ask to confirm it. So fix it and
restart, you ill get back your GUI.

This site gives a view of FLOSS landscape and can be very useful. You
can clidk on various words that are appearing

and this in particular.
http://www.visual-literacy.org/pages/documents.htm

Using periodic table format is a very interesting conceptualization.

And oh! the periodic table in its two dimensional format was inspired
by Mandaleev's close association with another Russin Sanskrit scholar.
He so much influenced that he named originally some elements with
prefix of "eka" sanskrit/Hindi for one.

Hi,

He said he is using RED HAT edition.

Whether USB ports have got disabled?
What would be the problem and how to resolve it?

run the following commands as root.

fdisk -l

note the results.

insert usb drive.
again,
fdisk -l

now, you can find the device name of the usb disk. It will be shown as
/dev/sda1 or /dev/sdb1

mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt

cd /mnt

access the contents from /mnt folder.

Please note that if you use fedora >= 7 , each storage device is
treated as /dev/sda as opposed to  /dev/hda for IDE as it used to be
and still is in some deb.

So the number may vary.

So I would strongly suggest that in another open and visible command
windows the fruend runs :

tail -f /var/log/messages

That will immediately tell when the pen drive is plugged in and when
it is removed and most important of it all: the device name /dev/xxx

There was a similar discussion on ILUG-Delhi mailing list.  I would
suggest that you read the postings in the  thread and understand what
is involved when you want to connect VoIP network to a PSTN network
(GSM in your case).

Where have you heard the above terminology?

PRI/BRI is a digital line with an array of 64 Kbps channels +
signaling channels for ISDN [1] telephony services.    ISDN adoption
has been slow (almost non existent) but the transport technology has
been adapted to other data/telephony communication services with
adapters at respective ends of the pipe.    Channel banks can split up
the array into various services including analog services.

> ?I also need to know, where we use these things.

It would depend on your requirements.  I suspect you are in the stage
of defining your requirements.   I suggest you engage a knowledgeable
Telecom consultant to guide you, vendors tend to hype their product.

There are multiple ways to post and interleaved, trimmed posting is
the one recommended by this mailing list. So avoid top posting.

You can also connect your mobile using usb data cable & can connect to
internet. Tell your distribution so that i can tell you specifically, If you
are using ubuntu goto preferences->network connections->mobile broadband,
then add connection with your service provider name.

In ILUGC we do not sell or do student projects.

 We can only help/guide if you have some specific problem. Please be specific about your problem like - error message, where in your program you are struck etc.

 I suggest you to use Netbeans to develop your Java applications. A detailed
tutorial on establishing JDBC connectivity is explained in the links below:

Please follow the mailing list guidelines and avoid top posting. Have
you looked into the source code that was downloaded from some website?
What is the thing that you are trying to do and what is the error
message that is shown?

Please be very specific showing code snippets (through bitbucket or github
as Jaganadh suggested) as to
(1) what YOU have tried and
(2) what is the error.

Be rest assured that you are NOT going to get the source code for your
project through ilugc.

I think you should help such people.

They have at least tried. like me. To be cone "Graduates".

I have my share of serious programming much before I rouched open
source. But theat stupid "graduation certificate" has eluded me
forever.

I have raised and witll maintining a family of four+ fro about 30
years.without somebody doing my homework of proramming(?).

Universities, please stop this stupidities.

Above IMHo,

With warmest regards only,

I use qemu which is what people normally call as kvm I guess.

I did not like Xen. VmWare is very popular but I don't like it.

I have also used Virtualbox, it is good but I don't like it much.

I dunno. Popularity does not mean anything more than that it is usable
and functional.

Number of virtual hosts? I dunno. I would  think that this is
dependent on your RAM .

Qemu is really very fast and is resource friendly.

Qemu is also immensely reliable.

I am sure people find Vmware also reliable or else it would not be so popular.

That is all I can tell.

No.  KVM is a Linux kernel module and heavily accelerates Qemu .  People
normally call these technologies by different names since they are
actually different from each other.

Very open ended question.  More details needed on how you are going to
use virtualization to answer.

Dear sir,

I am very sorry for delay mail . I am very thankful to you and your
team of ILUGC for giving a wonderful exposure for our students and get
to know the FOSS .The session by Mr.P.Raman was very interactive and
useful for our students and outside participants from various colleges
they were all overwhelmed by the FOSS concepts and was very much
interesting ? while working in UBUNTU and students came to know how
useful this environment and handling was too easy for the the
system.we wish the student will undergo projects on foss and we expect
in student community foss awareness getting faster.once again i thank
you and your foss team

I don't think so. Nevertheless, if that is your opinion, then *you* are
welcome to help such people.

When you don't have time (patience?) to check for spellings in your
mail(with all those spell-checkers), why do you think everybody else in the
list have time to decipher your mail? (I'm not one of the list police you
mentioned in your mail in another thread; merely a member who is at least as
busy as you are.)

Raj,

There is a tool called Java NCSS[1] ( which will do exactly the same
thing that you want to do. It's a open source tool and you can get the
sourcecode of the same and see how it is done. There is also a mailing
list and a source repo. so you can start contributing by fixing a few
defects for them :-)

Are you in your college / in-house training of a company?

Anyways, I think, you should do a little more homework and explain it
more accurately for us to help you.

1. If am not wrong, you are working on a J2EE Application. What is the
app server that you are using? (TomCat, JBOSS, GlassFish, ...?)
2. Have you ever tried writing a Hello World Web Application with that
server? (If NO, first do that before you attempt this).
3. How are the modules organized? What does each module do? Is it a
helper class or a set of JSP/JSF pages? What exactly are there in
these modules?

If you can get some answers to these, your actual question would be a
little bit more accurate. We are at a loss of what exactly do you want
us to help you in.

Natarajan.

Please follow the mailing list guidelines and avoid top posting.
Interleaved, trimmed posting is the preferred style in this mailing

Hi,

FYI.

Installed Debian Squeeze today from the LFY DVD., and after
installation I was unable to boot into Windows :s. For some reason the
Vista option was missing. Had to run 'grub-mkcfg' and paste some of
the output manually into '/boot/grub/grub.cfg' to solve the problem.

During install the Installer actually detected Windows though.

Since normally only questions and that too too newbie to boot are the

I think virtio is a tunnel, not a hyperviser. We can't compare these 
products because they use different techniques to achieve 
virtualization. Contest should be like this,

Full-Virtualizers:

VMWare vs Hyper-V vs Virtualbox vs Qemu

Kernel-Assisted-Virtualizers (Para-Virtualizers):

VMWare(6.0) vs Xen

Hardware-Assisted-Virtualizers (Intel-VT or AMD-V):

kvm(qemu-kvm)

SandBoxers:

BSD-Jails vs Linux-VServer vs OpenVZ vs Virtuozzo vs Linux-Containers(lxc)

We can achieve nativity only in 'SandBoxers' but host and guest should 
be same kernel. I don't know about 'qemu-kvm' in clouds, but for 
experiments and personal use, it is way better than any other solutions.

Thanks,
Mohan R

I don't think bluez creates any device files inside /dev. hci* 
interfaces are just like our eth* interfaces, you just modprobe the 
driver, and talk with them through their interface name, they will never 
create a file in /dev directory.

To see the name of your bluetooth device, here is the command,

$ sudo hciconfig -a

[OffTopic]: As your blog suggests, if you are planning to completely
migrate to GNU/Linux, 4 GB is hardly adequate.

Your question suggests that you may not have understood the
layout of files and directories in *nix
Read this if you have time [Too-Much-Information warning]]
> http://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_01.html

I do not know if a single logical partition can extend over multiple
physical drives. [I do not think it is straightforward if it is.
Can someone who knows how LVM actually works chip in?]

However, you could do this.

Assumption: Your new drive is /dev/sdXY

[sdXY can be sdb1 or sdc1 etc. Figure this out]

0. Optional: Create a partition on the drive [You will lose data already
on the drive]
   As root,
   # mkfs.ext2 /dev/sdXY

ext3 and ext4 are great too. But given the drive is just 6GB, I wonder
if there will be significant gains.

1. Create a mount-point
   # mkdir /extras

2. Add this line to /etc/fstab
   /dev/sdXY /extras ext2 defaults 0 1

This will mount the cause the partition to automount on /extras

3. Now, if you reboot, the partition would be mounted in /extras. Copy
   your non-critical files like music or documents to this partition.

   If you want to continue work without rebooting, do this
   [Needed only the first time]

   # mount /extras

4. You can confirm that the partition has been mounted by
   # mount
    > This lists the mounted partitions

Add the word "single" to the end of the kernel line.

I think SuSE's boot screen itself allows you to change the
kernel line. If it doesn't, press e when on the SuSE option and
press e when on the line that starts with the word kernel

Hello folks ,
?
In recent months I hear lot about cloud computing or cloud aware applications , not? so convinced about the concept other than the advantages of IT procumerment/deployment and reducing maintanence costs in view from IT team and putting public aware applications like gmail on cloud or salesforce .
?
but certainly cannot put home grown business apps on public cloud provider because of security reasons .
?
?
Just curious has anybody deployed apps in cloud env or in simple
how to create/deploy Cloud aware application
How to make existing applications ( mostly legacy ) to make cloud aware or? put in cloud environment 
?
thanks in advance for your inputs 
?
?
thanks

MongoDB is one of the NoSQL databases.

Here is an easy book[1] and interactive guide[2] to learn MongoDB.

Subject: [Ilugc] Help Required: WUBI root.disk corruption
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=xLWcJrhfW8=G=+hmc=dTVFhb1GFY5PSLsnTEC@mail.gmail.com>

I had Ubuntu 9.10 installed in Windows Vista via WUBI (Windows Ubuntu
installed). My laptop battery dried over the weekend and hence it was
automatically powered off. While booting up yesterday, it complained about
not being able to find wubldr (WUBI loader??). Hence, I booted up the
machine using an old Live CD (Ubuntu 7) to access the Linux filesystem.
While trying to mount the root.disk file (D:\ubuntu\disks\root.disk), it
complained about an Input/Output error. I assumed it to be a file corruption
problem and ran "chkdsk /f". This seems to have wiped out the root.disk file
(it was close to 20 GB and I was already having disk usage issues in the
Linux partition).

I would like to salvage atleast some important files from this. I have tried
data recovery tools such as "EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard", but even they
could not find the "root.disk" file in the said location.

Has anyone encountered this problem before? Any pointers to get back the
file would greatly help.

Thanks,
Ananth

This looks like an automated email, people will learn to follow the
guidelines, but sending something like this for every next mail is a
little annoying. Guidelines reminder can be sent as part of a reply to
the actual query, not separate mails.

you mean he has written a script to identify posts that do not conform
to guidelines and has automated the process? (I wrote a script in perl
long ago to identify top posts, but not the second part of automatically
sending the mail - seems a good idea, saves a lot of work)

It really doesn't matter if it is automated or not, but is annoying.

I guess its more useful to point a top-poster to a page that explains
what top-posting is and why it is not good, rather than sending him to
a page of guidelines.

How about sending it ONLY to the poster and not the entire list? That 
way archive won't be messy.

How about including this logic into the mailing list engine itself
so top/bottom posts do not get accepted!!!

It is more annoying to receive a mail with top-posting.

so you believe that people can post any way they like and no one here
should object? That every list member does not have a duty to help make
the list a better place?

I have tried that - these guys never bother to read such posts - it is
only when it is pointed out for the public to see that some of the more
sensitive people actually bother to find out what is happening. Most of
them just see whether it is relevant to their query or not and ignore
it.

I don't quite understand your question. crosstool-NG is a good tool to

Every member has the responsibility, I dnt like top posting too. But
too much of guideline mails for each mail thread is annoying. If the
same is within a relevant mail it wouldn't make the archive ugly or
the reading discontinuous. Its my opinion, a start to get something
done about this. IMVHO, we shouldn't trash the list with the name of
making it a better place.

I think KG's reminders actually improve the readability of the list. I 
think we can all live with a little active enforcement of guidelines 
like these. It's the price you have to pay for a uniformly readable 
list. I'm okay with it.

Hello,

Does anyone know how to make Nautilus confirm "Move to Trash"?
Occasionally I hit both Home and Delete in a large directory and move
some folder to trash. If I have anything else in Trash, then finding
this folder becomes really hard.

The gconf entry `/apps/nautilus/preferences/confirm_trash` doesn't do
anything.

I'm using Ubuntu 9.04. If anyone could confirm whether this setting
works properly in a later Ubuntu, I'd appreciate that.

Regards,

Thanks, Nagappan, the links are exactly what I needed. I'm on Gnome
2.26.1 so I'll have to do some legwork before patching. Or I'll just
switch to Thunar.

Gnome's attitude towards user interfaces is incredibly baffling.

I use it to power my website and a school information system webapp. It can
be found at schoolpulz.com. You can see last years TN public exam results
analytics at schoolpulz.com/results - I think thats a good example where
NoSQL (I use couchdb) is a good fit.

 binaries to compute Worst case execution time of a task
Message-ID: <AANLkTim6_nx-JsTQfyj3_PWSkNe7xti9Gq7G6bBOG19W@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ,

My name is Pradheep. I am working in the area of ?Multicore scheduling?. I
need to estimate the worst case execution time of a task. For which I am
using a tool ?OTAWA?. This works on an Eclipse platform.  This computes the
worst case execution time of a task by taking the binary executable file
generated after compilation of the gcc code and sets  constraints using an
lp_solve tool. The ILP(Integer linear programming) constraints for each task
based on maximum resource allocation is formulated and based on this and the
worst case execution time of the task is computed. To do this I need to
cross compile my gcc code based on gcc tool chains.

                Actually 2 cross compilers were suggested namely

1.       Cross tools

2.       ARM processor tool chain

I am finding some errors stating ?Unable to install getandpatch for glib?
while executing demo.sh file for  building the gcc tool chain. I tried
resolving the same but I am unable to completely eliminate them. I would be
obliged if any one could suggest some cross compilers like the above which
has support for me to complete my work. I would be obliged if any one could
help me out on the same.

Hi All

I am facing a strange problem. I have two systems where vnc is enabled. One
person is working on the two systems. He will be executing some java
programs in the  two machines.
Suddenly I found that some folders in the desktop is vanishing. I found
those files and folders in the Trash.

Is there any way to find who deleted the file. The deletion happens by using
the *del* key not by using *rm* or *rm -rf*

If my question is foolish forgive. I searched in the WWW but it says about
examine .bash_history. But this does not solves my problem

Linux from scratch is not a distro in the traditional sense.  It is
basically a guide for building everything from upstream source
tarballs.   A media of the distro would just be a bunch of tarballs and
the guide

Check the logs for clues on why sshd is failing.
See the fies in /var/log/.

Subject: [Ilugc] How to prevent MySQL table corruptions?
Message-ID: <AANLkTinDJobbv7o2seaOD0g0YGZ8MgcH1inSONvffHmR@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

I have a SugarCRM server running.
I am getting the following error often,

Query Failed:SELECT tracker.* from tracker WHERE user_id='max_id'
ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 0,10::MySQL error 1030: Got error 134 from
storage engine

To solve the issue, I have to repair the table 'tracker' everytime, by
the following command in mysql.
repair table tracker;

How can we prevent these kind of frequent mysql table corruptions?

Thanks.

I just opened this configuration file and looked the content.

The part of that file content is,

# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.  See

#Port 22
#AddressFamily any
#ListenAddress 192.168.122.0/24

You can change the database engine type of the table to InnoDB.. but be careful; the performance of InnoDB table is slower than MyISAM.

Hi Shrini,

Looks like either abrupt database shutdown (kill -9 ?), possible 
filesystem corruption (I had faced similar issues earlier on a large 
database using MyISAM storage engine  running on RHEL5 with 
XFS filesystem) or maybe there could be some issue with hard disk. 

In any case, backup your existing tables. Then, try migrating all 
tables to InnoDB storage engine and check if this fixes the problem 
for now. InnoDB provides automatic row checksum and repair feature 
and it works pretty well.

Also check for mysqld error logs (you can check where the error 
logs are stored by typing "SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_error';" at the
mysql prompt) to get a hint on whether the server has detected
any storage engine crashes or other issues.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

Hi,

On MySQL 5.5+ and on MariaDB (which uses XtraDB), there were no
significant performance overhead reported when compared to MyISAM.
Infact, InnoDB is the officially recommended reliable and high-performance
storage engine on MySQL for sometime now.

One issue here is to tune a whole lot of the innodb_* configuration 
parameters correctly for decent performance.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

Hi Suresh,

>  "sshd". These are the files that i've found in the "/var/log",

You might want to look up /var/log/messages and /var/log/secure
files.

Try 'grep sshd /var/log/messages | tail' and 
'grep ssh /var/log/secure | tail' and check for any possible issues.

First check if sshd is running by trying the command 'pgrep sshd'
on the host. If the output is empty, its very likely that sshd is not 
running. Try 'tail -f /var/log/messages' on one terminal and do 
a '/etc/init.d/sshd start' on another terminal.  Then, check the 
output that comes up on the previous terminal.

Assuming that sshd is running on the host, try 'tail -f /var/log/secure' 
and try connecting from the remote machine using ssh. Check
up the message displayed in /var/log/secure.

This should help us diagnose the problem better.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

How did you disable SElinux?

Give the output of the following command.

cat /etc/selinux/config

Did you restart the computer after disabling SELinux?

Hi Suresh,

>  USER=root ; COMMAND=/sbin/service sshd start
>  Mar 31 18:30:48 mercury sshd[24192]: Received signal 15; terminating.
>  Mar 31 18:32:00 mercury sshd[1752]: Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 2222.

Looks like /etc/ssh/sshd_config is mis-configured to listen on 
port 2222 instead of the default SSH port 22. Try editing the 
sshd_config file and uncomment the line that says "#Port 22" 
by removing the leading # on that line. Save the file, do 
'/etc/init.d/sshd start' and check the logs.

Also, run the command 'ss -l' as root user and check if you can 
find a line that has something like ':::ssh' listed under 
'Local Address:Port' column.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

I am using Reliance Netconnect USB modem,

I want to shift to 3G usb modem,
I want to know which usb modems work under Linux box ?
If you give me the model number along with your Internet provider, then I
will be able to compose a list and host on wiki.

BSNL - Model No LW272 Ubuntu Package is available in the USB. For fedora we
have to extract the .deb file and put it in the respective folders to enable
it.
