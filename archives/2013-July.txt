I have never commented on your posts so far...

I am compelled to do so as I do not like disinformation being spread.

You please do the steps you describe and then report the facts here or
else I will be compelled to start a flamewar based on the facts I whav
and will discover and you will have no cover.

The is a quesiton posed by a person, as I haved gleaned from my
readings and myexperience, who is very knowledgeble.

Let me start my tirade here: you have no knowledge of capacity
planning, So kkeep your fingers tied before jumping to a response.

I will not respond to your irresponsible responses if any, if they are
devoid of facts.

What do you know about RHEL/Centos? nothing. so dont comment on it
would be my mild advice.

I'd like to correct some things mentioned here.

This is wrong. For the Debian case, all packages are arranged in the
pool directory. By this, I mean ALL architectures. Now, you could do a
find -iname '*amd64*deb', but even that wouldn't give you a good
estimate, since that misses the architecture independent packages. So,
you'd have to look for 'all*deb' as well. Naturally, these find
statements would be somewhat inaccurate from the getgo.

The same thing holds for Ubuntu. For CentOS, you could use the x86_64
filter, but even that could be a little tricky. In addition, you'd
have to handle the noarch RPMs.

One way to get an estimate (and even to create a mirror) would be to
look at the size of the complete DVD images. For instance, for Debian,
going from http://www.debian.org/CD to the DVD image list provides 10
DVD images. That would roughly mean a 44 GB footprint. This would also
be without the x86 packages, so if you intend using it for multiarch,
you need many extra packages.

> OpenBSD 5.3 i386 packages alone take up 17 Gigs.

Are these binary or source packages?

Please let me know if this makes sense.

Thanks.

I will now get to the jQuery UI project which adds a lot of
interesting functionality to the jQuery core engine.

This is a demo I copy pasted from it.

Great one again!

One issue though: I can drag any box anywhere; that means, If I get
the upper box into lower drop zone; it is achievable; though lower
drop zone is not showing me "Dropped" message.

That's true for other one as well.

That means it is not dropped.

I am glad you are learning.

jQuery has everything one needs for a sophisticated web application.

I recently developed a media portal for searching, playing and
downloading media files.

There are lot of ways to skin this cat.

Use a firefox plugin or something to photograph the page.

Then print the image.

Use a htmldoc converter to write out the table as PDF.

There are many other ways.

Or simply use ImageMagick import or somehow photograph the page.

Well, Chomsky wasn't defending a random person he believed to be right, he was 
defending one of his undergraduate students. Just goes to show that everybody is 
human and that relationships and interactions have a direct effect on how you 
think and they can colour perspective (Chomsky, of all people should know this 
:) ).

By the looks of it Chomsky seems to have been defending the idea that innovation 
can happen anywhere even by small kids (a.k.a - it is small student Vs Big Bad 
Industry ...the student is obviously right). It is unfortunate that the facts 
mattered less.

Note that the controversy reached it's height sometime in early 2012 when the 
Smithsonian inducted some of Shiva Ayyadurai's work as part of their collection. 
The above article appears to be from then.

In any case, I think the saving grace is that not many people took this 
non-sense seriously and the matter died due to lack of any more spice in the story.

cheers,

He is a great linguist and all, but for Chomsky facts always mattered less
when it came to Big Bad Corporations? or the Evil Uncle Sam . ;-) Something
to remember while reading his stuff.

As long as you only post links I (we?) have no problem! Its when you try to
pass of your conceited drivel as knowledge, it is insulting to ones
intellect and I feel compelled to point it out.

Lets see how long you can resist finding fault with (insulting?) others
here!!

Message-ID: <CAFHFDAm7n4-pinO1VoK-xaerbuwh7Vak0DYc3HufdS+qKdzxoA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am not sure if I am the only one who's ADSL modem goes bad after ~ 1.5 to
2 years.  I currently have Beetle 450 TC1 and it does not hand out IP
address on WLAN though it is properly configured.  More over it suddenly
stops working by not resolving IP addresses even when I tried configuring
the modem with OpenDNS.

1. Has any one been successful in getting to the shell of the Beetle 450
TC1 modem after telneting to it ?  I know the older one such as Beetle 220
gives you busybox shell with the sh command.

2. Is it possible to get a new firmware, When I tried contacting Beetle
they are good for nothing they did not even mind responding.

3. In the worst possible case of getting a new modem what ADSL Modem model
do you suggest for the following criteria ?

   - I would love to have snort it and work perfectly fine with our Indian
   ISP.


   - It would also be good if I could get SSL VPN on it.


   - Ability to configure syslog on the modem.


   - Extending the antenna of WLAN alone into another room.


   - At least 4 Wired port on the modem come router ?


   - What do you thing about ? D-Link DSL-2750U Wireless N ADSL2

Subject: [Ilugc] PDF XL and HTML reporting
Message-ID: <CALDskyw=wheacOGjT0ccSgTQis2_4L=GWsfMuEtry8GPpHsn0g@mail.gmail.com>

As part of my product development efforts I have had to create tabular data in
 various formats PDF, XL and HTML.

I use Perl CGI and of course jQuery for my products.

So the CGI has to generate these from ...yes HTML.

But there is a difference.

The HTML that renders on a web page along with other HTML elements
inside a div is different
 from a HTML page that contains just the desired table.

But it is rather easy.

Creating MS XL and PDF is a little more work.

It turns out I can use a Perl CPAN module Spreadsheet::WriteExcel can
do that job with some programming.

For HTML tables I use a UNIX command with htmldoc.

/usr/local/bin/htmldoc --webpage -t pdf14 --pagemode fullscreen --size
25x11in --left 2 -f out.pdf out.html

The code for Spreadsheet::WriteExcel goes along:

my $wb = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel->new("$outpath/webhistory.xls");
$w = $wb->add_worksheet("History of web traffic");

$b = $wb->add_format(); $b->set_bold();
        $wcol = 0;
        @h = ();
        for(qw(Date From_IP URL HTTP_method Action)) {
                $w->write(0, $wcol++, $_, $bold);
        }

        @rows = ();
        $wrow = 1;

                $wcol = 0;
                # Write to an Excel file as well...
                for($date,  $host, $macid, $url, $method, $action) {
                        $w->write($wrow, $wcol++, $_);
                }
                $wrow++;

       $wb->close();

I have only heard the legend of a hacker who cannot be stopped.
Could you be the chosen one?

Hurry! The world is full of darkness, and might not survive unless you
brighten our days with your lucid code.
Vast masses of poor LUGgies are dying of ignorance.
Please continue shining the brilliant light of your knowledge upon us.

Please paste some code about generating PDF's in Perl already!
If you didn't tell us, how would we know how to do that?

Please make sure that your code is not well-documented, and has several
errors in it.
How subtle, and how beautiful are your "mistakes"! Each one chosen to
enlighten us!
We shall take these upon us as our assigned learning exercises.

Forgive me, Guru-ji, as I thought you were a common idiot at first.
You are not a common idiot at all!

No Google, no books, nothing can help us!
You, and only you are are source of knowledge.

Please, Guru-ji. Never leave this list!

Your humble pupil,

- Ashwin.

Guru-ji, as you requested without using words, I have done my homework.
Since you have not yet uttered any enlightened words on PDF generation in
Perl, I deduced in my dimwitted ignorance, that this was an exercise left
up to the reader.

I am submitting this crudely documented source, a tutorial on how to
generate PDF's in Perl.
Now this fellow is not accomplished, and wise like you. He does not
understand that silence is golden. He says crude and foolish things:
http://rick.measham.id.au/pdf-api2/


Kindly turn it into a tutorial for the rest of us, and post it on this list.
I humbly request that you not use "strict" or "warnings" hints to the
compiler, as who could be so arrogant as to doubt that you will always do
the supremely correct thing?
Also, please don't use "my". This is a means of declaring that a variable
is lexically scope, and it is only for mortal fools, and total n00bz.
It would really help the readers, if you could distort the white-spaces. It
will force the reader to learn about perltidy. That'll be great!
And, never, ever use meaningful variable names. It keeps the reader on
their toes. How will they ever learn, unless they have a VM running in
their head, keeping track of each $a and @b ? Moreover, in your previous
article, on how you generate XL spreadsheets, you completely omitted
mentioning your data sources. This is a ninja-level tactical move, which I
will never fully understand. The variables seemingly appear out of nowhere,
and vanish into nowhere. No "warning", no "my" declarations. Just deadly
efficiency. Master, you truly are one with the machine!

Please forgive my ignorance, as I am not worthy of interacting with a being
so supremely attained, and skilled, beyond my comprehension.
Also, please forgive Rick Measham. He is not a worthy example, to anyone.
I look forward to reading all about how to generate PDF's using Perl.

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

Overdose of sarcasm is just as bad. It is easier to ignore emails, I
guess. Let's not stoop very low, in trying to correct others. Thanks

LOL !!! Brilliant !! *NOW*, I shall look forward to Girish's mails just to read 
your responses ! If Girish can use this forum as his own personal soapbox, 
propaganda tool and incoherent rant space all rolled into one, you certainly can 
use it to indulge your inner creative writer !

Ignoring emails just produces ignorance.
There are many things in the world that would be better, in my humble
opinion, if we engaged in civil discourse, instead of letting machines
filter our reality.
As for stooping low, there really is no limit to my stupidity, or the
Universe.
I don't understand your concept of "low".
I say whatever this list lets me say. If anyone really minded, Girish would
have been gone, long time ago.

Please, don't stoop so high. Yeah, I've been to Vivekananda rock too. Big
deal.

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

Firstly, I do not endorse or support those commentary (his views on
lug and those conceit phrases )  written by Girish.
he is being pounded.
I request the list moderator to take cognizances  of the situation.

I disagree with the statement that it was an overdose. The dose of sarcasm doled 
out by Ashwin was in perfect proportion to the dose of incoherent half-baked 
tech gyaan Girish relives himself off on this list.

Why the double standards ? If one has a big enough problem with Ashwin's reply 
so as to voice it, one should have the same problem with Girish's 
mis-information, personal propaganda and soopbox rants.

If on the other hand, ignoring Girish is something you can do, I think you can 
do the same for Ashwin's sarcasm laden replies ...ah ! or do you think Ashwin 
needs to be treated differently than Girish ?

I doubt that's going to happen. One can only use reason with reasonable people.

Girish is not going to change or stop because he firmly believes that all he 
does is right and anyone who thinks otherwise is doing so because they either 
have a personal problem with him or they are useless time-wasters not to be 
bothered with or they do it because they like correcting others rather than 
contributing something constructive. You see he *does not* think there is 
*anything* wrong with what he does.

Well, there is nothing there to stop if you think about it:
- If you do not see a problem with Ashwin's mail, there is no reason to reply 
other than for saying, thanks (same as you do with Girish's posts)

- If you see a problem with Ashwin's mail, ignore the mail (same as you do with 
Girish's posts)

...unless of course you think rules should be different for Ashwin and Girish.

cheers,

Thank you, Shrinivasan. I was hoping for people to discuss what free speech
means.
And how should a community govern itself, when are all about Free Software,
Free as in Speech?



Here are my views. And yours may be the same, or different.

Everyone defecates, and defecation is natural. Yet, there ought to be laws
against defecating in the Ganges.
We can't all be tolerant technologists who invent water filters to deal
with the pollution.

After all, who is Girish? He is me, and you.
I personally don't care if Girish stays or leaves.
I would like a better quality discussion for all.
Please, share your views on how the list should govern itself.

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

Subject: [Ilugc] perl or python or javascript?
Message-ID: <CALDskyx2BsvpwkWpoxjZ-k+H40s-8X+o+eUpoP391n963C5+PQ@mail.gmail.com>

People who want a quick job or improve their chances of employment, living a
 better life or some such thing will wish this question to be answered.

Like everything else in life this answer is highly subjective and
every opinion is
 right or wrong depending on who is reading it.

I will add to the confusion in my own way.

My love affair with perl goes far beyond the job requirements.

It has got to do with my love for the open source UNIX phenomenon.

I used to read about Larry Wall, how much the world was welcoming perl
and so on.

Javascript happened because of my biz need.

And python was learnt by and by. Even today I am not very good at it.

Perl was also very useful in my career. So much so that it actually
caused my boss to be
 annoyed by my speed and grasp of perl.

And also my boss's boss.

By the way as an aside, death stalks us every minute. When we die we
cannot carry all our wealth and
 enjoyments to our next life but we surely can carry our knowledge. By
that I mean not directly the
 syntax or programming language mastery but knowledge which is the
ability to learn and retain information
 and process it in a certain way.

Now back to the topic.

Python cannot do what perl can. And you can argue similarly with other
languages also.

Every language has its place in the scheme of things.

But if you are looking at learning programming or obtaining long term
employable skill then
 all these languages are good.

Javascript cannot be learnt without html, xml, css and CGI knowledge.

And CGI cannot be written in javascript. ;)

For CGI you have to learn perl anyway.

Our irctc website for train ticket bookings is written in simple CGI.

I am not sure what language.

But it does not use any fancy web framework like Mason or Catalyst.

Anyway I digress.

Perl is used for mostly UNIX centric work. Somehow it nicely weaved
into my life.

I write the most critical bits for my hacking in C. Rest all in perl.

I also earn my bread in perl these days by executing projects for a UK client.

I recently wrote a program to convert audio podcast to video with a
static image.

I used perl and UNIX commands like ffmpeg and a python code to use the
youtube upload API.

But I did not write a single line of python. The python program was
used like a UNIX shell utility.

Javascript is very useful for animation purposes and for developing
cross browser,cross OS network accessible
 user interfaces.

Today web application development is a very useful skill.

Having jQuery and PHP skill seems to have a certain demand.

Can you write a daemon , a UNIX server background process in perl?

Yes you can. I use it in production.

It is slower than C and less capable in certain ways, more easy in certain ways.

But Javascript is useful only within a browser environment.

How many of you installed spidermonkey and started hacking javascript?

After all I send you a jQuery code sample each day no?

-Girish

Please, feel free to use filters.

Swami Vivekananda himself would have told you that your goal is to cover
your ears, when you hear things you do not like.


AWAKE?

Actually, I am going back to sleep. For 37 minutes. Then I will hack Perl
again, just like I have for the past 18 years.
Swami-ji, we are all equally holy.

FILTER THIS!

Cheers,

Does innovation happen because of biz need, or because some hacker is

It's ECMAScript, as in "European Computer Manufacturer's

Surely, you are wrong! When we die, it really is over for us. There is no
more life after death.
Now you and I are saying two different things, and neither of us knows
anything about death.
What we are saying is called BS ( Belief System ).

Renting the modem from the ISP is another option.  When things do not
work, the ISP tech cannot blame the modem manufacturer.

For Wi-Fi, I use a separate AP with the features I want.

Renting ends up being more expensive than buying and support ends after the
one ear warranty is up. Why not get a ADSL+wifi device that can run dd-wrt
and customise to your liking?

I am saddened to see that the signal to noise ratio on this list is
getting worse and worse.

Ashwin and Girish - neither of you are helping. Sick and tired of the lame
posts.

It is the internet equivalent of a couple of guys getting up during a show
and having a go at each other without the slightest thought to anyone else
present.

If you guys want to have it out, please find another venue to do this so
that our inboxes are not filled with the litany of your squabbles.

Not with the ISPs I have service with.    Tata Docomo, in Mumbai,
gives the modem free; replacement is within 24 hours if the modem is
defective.

I use a Huawei Quidway 3000 ADSL +WiFi router which costed me Rs.1,800/=
from BSNL. It has worked well without problems for about 4 years now.

BTW, what were the special features you were looking at and what you got
with specific models. Keen to know as I'm also looking for features like
QoS, file type based throttling, WiFi bridging etc.

Arun has suggested pfSense which I've heard a decent bit about. Never got
to use it though. IPTables and ip route commands in combination can achieve
this on Linux too.

I've seen reasonably ease to use front ends for IPTables - Shorewall is one
I strongly recommend for its feature set and strong support on lists.
Webmin has some good plugins for IPTables and Shorewall.

Dear Prem,

I would love to improve the signal to noise ratio on this list.
For this purpose, I have raised objections about Girish's postings, which
are pretty high in noise, IMHO.
Now, you have lumped my objections together with his noise.

If we allow Girish to keep posting his technically inaccurate rants on this
list, then we also have to allow people to correct the inaccuracies, to
prevent misinformation.
There are better forums for Girish to accomplish his worthy aim of
knowledge-sharing. He has already been told this several times.

You choices are:
1. tolerate Girish, and tolerate those who correct him.
2. ask the list moderator to ban Girish, and anybody else you don't like to
hear from.
3. use email filters, and improve the signal to noise ratio for yourself,
and not for the list.

I am here to exchange knowledge about GNU/Linux and FOSS.
Yet this list seems to lack the will to self-govern.

Please let's get administrative issues out of the way, to keep the
discussion technical and interesting.

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

Hi,

Overdose of sarcasm is just as bad. It is easier to ignore emails, I
> guess. Let's not stoop very low, in trying to correct others. Thanks


But sometime its good to have someone like Kenneth or Ashwin, giving a dose
of sarcasm. AFAIK one of guidelines of public mailing lists of ILUG's is to
give correct info based on facts and figures NOT on perception and
illogical views.

It will not only save us from Diarrheal emails but will also decrease
carbon footprints by stopping people maintaining redundant copies of JQuery

I agree with many of your points. I am sorely disappointed with the fact
that the moderators here seem to have gone on permanent vacation. Also,
yes, the members of the mailing list themselves don't seem to police the
discussion as rigorously as was the case earlier when people like KG were
around.

Having said that, your emails don't paint a flattering picture of your
ability to hold a discussion online. If you feel that Girish's emails are
not helpful, please don't add to our woes by following up with long,
pointless sarcasm - not one person is going to be reformed by that, and it
adds to the noise already present.

Respond with a single line, if need be.

Girish - it is sad that you have brought ilugc to this point.

Moderators - are any of you checking the emails on this list? Please respond.

Thanks,
Prem

I am flattered! I was merely amplifying the noise to draw attention to it.
Anyway, we seem to be having a discussion right now, and I am certainly not
saying that your abilities to have a discussion are deficient.

While making a mistake in one line is possible, explaining why it is a

steve, and Garuav, glad to hear that you enjoy my writings.

privacy, etc.

I'm planning on building out a couple of multi-NIC Zotac based boxes with 
untangle this month for my office for the exact same purposes. I'm not sure 
if this group wants to be hear about such an experience or would consider it 
off-topic - if so, then please follow my blog - http://vijay.axham.com/blog , 
if not, one of the moderators can let me know that it's okay and I will share 
my experiences here.

-Vijay
n.b.: I read the posts via RSS and cannot filter by sender. I assume that 
there are others like me and I don't want to add noise to the group. Hope you 
understand my reticence in simply posting away out here.

+1 to this discussion , yes we have learned to ignore one alien and few
ignorant fan boys , now mods need to take cognizance of the issue on hand
and bring sanity to this list .  I would be happy to do the honors if made

Let up STOP this thread here.

Girish,

All your writings are for the community.

It is sad that you are using the list only in write mode. Not in the read
mode. Please hear the feedback from the community and change your writing
style, content and tone.

If you are not ready to hear the community and change, you are not a part
of it. Don't make do make you so in our list.

Ashwin and others,

Thanks for brining out the issue and trying to make our list even better.

Please remember that personal attacks in public lists won't make us better.

Thanks for building a wonderful Foss community in Chennai.

I would like to get same kind of multiple replies when asking for speakers,
place for hackathons, call for volunteers for any activities etc.

Hope this happens soon.

Thanks all.

+1 for hangouts but it has limitations, like 10 members per video
conference. But people can watch live on YouTube.

Webinar is also a good idea.

Girish,

Do make your work  peer review done. If your writing is just to stay
(*only*) on subject and not your experience in the IT industry( none
bothers) , it will be a great help to the community.

You should take pride in attempting to contribute something to the
community. All that what it requires is a peer review for your
article. I am sure you will present a better material in due course.


Cheer up.

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Message-ID: <CALDskyxZDUXyLA1ENzRVY8+9ahB88-j2yOh5gdpe1nDUn=BhOA@mail.gmail.com>

The source code was sent in an anterior mail.

Meaning of anterior:

$ dict anterior
>From WordNet (r) 3.0 (2006) [wn]:

  anterior
      adj 1: of or near the head end or toward the front plane of a
             body [ant: {posterior}]
      2: earlier in time [syn: {anterior}, {prior(a)}]
      n 1: a tooth situated at the front of the mouth; "his
           malocclusion was caused by malposed anteriors" [syn: {front
           tooth}, {anterior}]


Back to business.

The UI effects,the real core of jQuery animation and probably all
animation activity
 since I am sure that animation existed even before the advent of the web.

Just like perl never invented regular expressions, I believe all these
animation names ought to be
 memorized.

Let me list them

Blind
Bounce
Clip
Drop
Explode
Fade
Fold
Highlight
Puff
Pulsate
Scale
Shake
Size
Slide
Transfer

The above words ought to be memorized as they are perfect English
words that have a
 real meaning in life.

So it is not really difficult at all to remember.

Basically our mind finds it hard to learn Sanskrit because the words
are not familiar to us.

But since we are already used to these we only have to see it and use
it in animation context.

The way you use the jQuery UI's animation API is this:

 $( "#effect" ).effect( selectedEffect, options, 2000, callback );

First the jQuery selector.

$('body') is also a selector.

Then the effect API, then you can call it like this:
var options = {};
$('body').effect('fold', options, 2000);

The callback is just a function to call at the end of the effect.

That is a standard feature in all jQuery APIs. We can ignore that.

The 2000 is the delay in milliseconds(1 thousandth of a second) for
which the effect will run.

This is also standard. For setInterval() and setTimeout() it is the same metric.

So the way you can invoke this API is by including these jQuery plugins:

<script src="/jquery/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.ui.effect.js"></script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.ui.effect-blind.js"></script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.ui.effect-bounce.js"></script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.ui.effect-clip.js"></script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.ui.effect-drop.js"></script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.ui.effect-explode.js"></script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.ui.effect-fade.js"></script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.ui.effect-fold.js"></script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.ui.effect-highlight.js"></script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.ui.effect-pulsate.js"></script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.ui.effect-scale.js"></script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.ui.effect-shake.js"></script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.ui.effect-slide.js"></script>
        <script src="/jquery/jquery.ui.effect-transfer.js"></script>

Usually we do not employ these many plugins.

But since this is complicated math a separate plugin is required for
each effect.

Hope this clarifies.

Now you can play with it to learn and enjoy.

Now for the biggest LIE ...

So far whatever animation I showed you was a lie.

Only these are animations.

Whatever else I called as animations were not really animations quote unquote.

Make your own judgement.

I leave it to you.

Subject: [Ilugc] July 26th is Sysadmin Day
Message-ID: <CAHe+QBs=UzPejskYEOYP1z0zbGQ0iJOCnywNXUSDw35VtZ4Twg@mail.gmail.com>

July 26, 2013 14th Annual System Administrator
Appreciation Day

A sysadmin unpacked the server for this website from its box, installed an
operating system, patched it for security, made sure the power and air
conditioning was working in the server room, monitored it for stability,
set up the software, and kept backups in case anything went wrong. All to
serve this webpage.

A sysadmin installed the routers, laid the cables, configured the networks,
set up the firewalls, and watched and guided the traffic for each hop of
the network that runs over copper, fiber optic glass, and even the air
itself to bring the Internet to your computer. All to make sure the webpage
found its way from the server to your computer.

A sysadmin makes sure your network connection is safe, secure, open, and
working. A sysadmin makes sure your computer is working in a healthy way on
a healthy network. A sysadmin takes backups to guard against disaster both
human and otherwise, holds the gates against security threats and crackers,
and keeps the printers going no matter how many copies of the tax code
someone from Accounting prints out.

A sysadmin worries about spam, viruses, spyware, but also power outages,
fires and floods.

When the email server goes down at 2 AM on a Sunday, your sysadmin is
paged, wakes up, and goes to work.

A sysadmin is a professional, who plans, worries, hacks, fixes, pushes,
advocates, protects and creates good computer networks, to get you your
data, to help you do work ? to bring the potential of computing ever closer
to reality.

So if you can read this, thank your sysadmin ? and know he or she is only
one of dozens or possibly hundreds whose work brings you the email from
your aunt on the West Coast, the instant message from your son at college,
the free phone call from the friend in Australia, and this webpage.
Show your appreciation

Friday, July 26, 2013, is the 14th annual System Administrator Appreciation
Day. On this special international day, give your System Administrator
something that shows that you truly appreciate their hard work and
dedication. (All day Friday, 24 hours, your own local time-zone).

Let?s face it, System Administrators get no respect 364 days a year. This
is the day that all fellow System Administrators across the globe, will be
showered with expensive sports cars and large piles of cash in appreciation
of their diligent work. But seriously, we are asking for a nice token gift
and some public acknowledgement. It?s the least you could do.

Consider all the daunting tasks and long hours (weekends too.) Let?s be
honest, sometimes we don?t know our System Administrators as well as they
know us. Remember this is one day to recognize your System Administrator
for their workplace contributions and to promote professional excellence.
Thank them for all the things they do for you and your business.

Opinions are like a**holes; everyone has one; and it is located in the posterior which is the opposite of anterior. Your's my friend, seems to be overstated; and you insist on using this forum to voice your opinions on Sanskrit, death and your boss.

Hey Girish,

How about a map of English/Sanskrit, visualized in jQuery?
It should be a 3D visual diagram that you can rotate, zoom in/out etc.
The diagram should capture all valid words, and also valid sentence
constructions.
Yet, I don't think you can do it. Neither can I.
So let's leave this list in peace, and take our high caliber assholes
elsewhere. :)

Cheers,

About 2.5 years ago WPA Enterprise was not available in most consumer
grade Wi-Fi  APs.

I settled for openWRT (Linux based) installed in an ALIX box.  I will
admit it is expensive but gives me the flexibility for installing
whatever I want (x86 based).

Today, a few do offer this option and I have seen them in the ASUS models.

Hi,

I am using Ubuntu OS,


I am installing the required software (development libraries)  using
"apt-get" from internet (ubuntu repository).


Is it possible to replicate these repository to the external harddrive?


The requirement,

I want to install the same development libraries on the Desktop which
doesnt have internet connection.
So i can take the external harddrive and install it on that pc.

Is it possible?

Thanks
suresh.

You can try apt-on-cd (aptoncd.sourceforge.net) which creates a
repository that can be used by apt to install packages.

One more thing - the ability to configure the radio power level.

At that time a few of the Buffalo models had this feature, the APs
looked very sleek.  However, over a period of time they would simply
disappear from the WLAN network.    After a few RMA replacements, I
concluded that it was a heat dissipation problem.

My openWRT box simply keeps working without any complaints.  FWIW

Are you in India? Do you get Un-interrupted power supply for 130 days?
If not which UPS are you using?

I think Tomato and Svensoft firmware give radio power controls for
extending the range of the wifi AP. On my Quidway, as I observed with many
home routers, the router needs rebooting once every 48-72 hours. Symptoms
would be link speed slowing down. Reason that I figured out - logs are in
memory and as the memory is close to full, this happens. Looks like the
infrastructure is lean and dos not have syslog kind of software to rotate/
limit/ manage logs.

I have done so for around 1.5 years when I did not have internet
connection in my PC. I have put the script in sourceforge. Please see
https://sourceforge.net/projects/ubuoffupdater/. It may be useful to
you also. Instructions to use the scripts will be shown while running
the script.

Hope this helps,

You can do that by setting the "user" option value. For
instance. consider this entry in fstab:

UUID=7927a7ab-8c3f-4198-bd73-d3cc519a9ac3 /auto/mydrive	auto	rw,user	0	0

This will allow /auto/mydrive to be accessed as non-root users.

More information is available in the man page of mount. See also the
man page of fstab.

Message-ID: <CALV9oma+_6PYyXpqdUJ9p9pXTmHEXAzq7qNqKbUmDu-s096=yA@mail.gmail.com>

command: nice
purpose: run a program with modified scheduling priority

syntax: nice [OPTION] [COMMAND [ARG]...]

according to the nice value kernel decides how much time is required for a
process
nice range: -20 to +20
process with nice value -20 has higher priority
process with nice value +20 has lower priority

to see the value of nice value of all process
$ ps axl
the 6th column with 'NI' is the nice value of process

example:
run a sample script name 'sample.sh'

$ ./sample.sh

note the nice value,
$ ps axl | grep ./sample.sh

now assign the low priority to the script

$ nice -5 ./nice-test.sh

check with
$ ps axl | grep ./sample.sh

to assign high priority with -15 root permission need

# nice --15 ./sample.sh

to check
# ps axl | grep ./sample.sh

more info: $ man nice

This is a nice autocomplete plugin which is part of jQuery UI project.

It is really nice. Very very simple code, easy to understand and implement.

Please try it.

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/jquery_tutorials/

The list of cities are:

 $(function() {
                var Cities = [
                        "Delhi",
                        "Mumbai",
                        "Chennai",
                        "Bangalore",
                        "Coimbatore",
                        "Madurai",
                        "Pune",
                        "Chandigarh",
                        "Kolkata",

                        "Kavaratti",
                        "Tirunelveli",
                        "Kanyakumari"
                ];
                $( "#tags" ).autocomplete({
                        source: Cities
                });
        });

The code is also only this much.

Ironically, the more adept sys admins will be less known by users because
the systems just work and there is no need to seek out the sysadmin :-)

There's a net legend about the sysadmin who completely automated his job as
a set of Expect scripts.
I guess good sysadmins create slack time to hack on pet projects,
capitalize them, and leave.
Some of the best sysadmins I've known, treat the job as a transitional
phase, a step towards something else.

Hi All,

I am have systems with processors Intel Pentium 4,AMD Athlon XP, Celeron
and 1GB/512 MB RAM configuration.

I want to install a debian/ubuntu based linux distro in the systems as I
was more familiar with it. I have installed Linux Mint 14 KDE in a system
and found that the performance is not decent.

My primary usage is LAMP development.

Which linux distro will be apt for my requirement?

Thanks,

Engelbart is one of my heroes. Sorry to see him pass on.

Doug Engelbart's mother of all demos will, very likely, never be surpassed.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfIgzSoTMOs

In a single live demo in 1968 he demonstrated: (From Wikipedia)
a) Mouse
b) Windowing user interface
c) Video conferencing
d) Teleconferencing
e) Hypertext
f) Word processing
g) Hypermedia
h) Object addressing
i) Dynamic file linking
j) Collaborative real time editor

But like Brett Victor points out, Engelbart's thinking on things like
video conferencing was broader in scope and deeper in meaning than what we
have nowadays.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos

Doug Engelbart's greatest contribution was in how he propagated the notion
of very high performance teams - teams which pool together the IQ of
individuals, and which rely on open collaboration using technology as a
key ingredient in their quest for high quality research.

"Boosting our collective IQ" which is a collection of papers by Doug
Engelbart is well worth reading:

Hi Manikk,
I am using ArchBang (http://archbang.org/) on a P-IV system with 512MB RAM
for LAMP development and it is working excellent. So I suggest you to try
this distribution on old configuration system.

Subject: [Ilugc] Need help migrating from a failing harddrive
Message-ID: <1372933266.435.27.camel@mohanlaptop.silentcrooks.org>

Hi,

Need some help moving data from a failing harddrive. Failing in the
sense, harddisk goes busy and gets stuck in the middle of heavy I/O,
most of the reboots ending in running fsck manually to get it boot. and
SMART overall assessment is "Disk failure is imminent".

Here is the partitions I have in the failing harddrive,

Model: ATA SAMSUNG HN-M500M (scsi)
Disk /dev/sda: 500GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: msdos
Disk Flags: 

Number  Start   End    Size   Type      File system  Flags
 1      1049kB  106MB  105MB  primary   ntfs         boot
 2      106MB   105GB  105GB  primary   ntfs
 3      105GB   105GB  524MB  primary   ext4
 4      105GB   500GB  395GB  extended
 5      105GB   500GB  395GB  logical                lvm

1. First two partitions are for WinXP No issues loosing them.
3. Third partition is /boot.
2. The last lvm partition contains following logical volumes,
	/dev/vg_mohanlaptop/lv_root - /
	/dev/vg_mohanlaptop/lv_home - /home
	/dev/vg_mohanlaptop/lv_virt - /home/mohan/Virt
	/dev/vg_mohanlaptop/lv_swap - swap

Here also I already backed-up lv_home and lv_virt into my external
drive, so loosing lv_home, lv_virt and lv_swap is fine.

But, I don't want to loose /boot and /dev/vg_mohanlaptop/lv_root. They
have my OS which is running fine for nearly 2 years. I have to migrate
this to new harddisk without loosing it.

I already took backup of /dev/vg_mohanlaptop/lv_root. My question is, If
I restore the contents of /boot and lv_root from current failing
harddrive to new harddrive (ofcourse creating same partitions with
enough space) and restoring grub in the new harddrive, will it work?
will I get the same OS which is running on my failing harddrive?

Keen to get some feedbacks,

Note: the backups are all tar.xz archives

Thanks,
Mohan R

I had done this earlier by moving the complete filesystem (from a failing
drive) to a new disk and adjusted the partition values according to the new
disk structure in grub and able to boot and work without any issues.

Remember, you also need to adjust the UUID values in /etc/fstab and any
other configuration files which requires modification.

Giving unique labels for the various filesystems is also an option

LABEL=root   /  blah blah

Besides /etc/fstab, the Grub menu also needs to be adjusted.  Again, I
use LABEL there as well.

Yes, Mumbai.  Had it not been for planned outage, the up time would be higher.
UPS is APC 800 Back-UPS RS - dedicated for low power network appliances.

It is quite stable under moderate usage. After all, it does have a 700
MHz processor and 512 MB RAM, so if you use it only with light usage,
it should work well with high uptime.

If you intend hosting a web facing server to serve customers, then it
wouldn't be such a good idea, since it isn't likely equipped to serve
thousands of requests per minute.

I personally run it internally as a backup server, web server and a
simple iptables firewall.

I have been using it for LTSP based thinclient implementations, were it
runs DHCP, TFTP, Apache which I also use it for setting up FOSS Labs.  The
performance and stability is good enough for my need.

Now, I am working on implementing LDAP and will post the status soon.
 Because of single ethernet interface, I don't think it will be best
suitable for building Proxy/Firewall kind of applications.

I have a Back-UPS RS 600 dedicated for D-Link modem but I have been
facing constant issues with it. The original unit got replaced because,
they had to replace battery every month. Now the new unit is yet to
complete a month, fingers crossed.

Is there is something that we need to take care of when powering lower
voltage devices?

Thanks and Regards

Message-ID: <CAND2794h1Jc5kPNGn+i3UJjvztNeVQ=O2=ot4ELJCj0pFiwx3g@mail.gmail.com>

I installed Kubuntu 13.04 and the found the installer has some issues
related to the text displayed.

Here is a sample bug.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu/+bug/665632

Currently the OpenOffice.org slide says:

OpenOffice.org works with documents from other popular office
applications include WordPerfect and Microsoft Office.

If I?m not mistaken, this should be:

OpenOffice.org works with documents from other popular office

This seems simple.
The fix is just a change of a word in a HTML file.


Let me try to fix it.

I shared the details on how I fixed the small bug in kubuntu installer.

Hope this will help for new contributors to ubuntu.

Sorry to hear that, within warranty APC is quite reasonable in
replacing units but do not expect a shiny new one.  I got used stuff,
restored to "factory new" condition - whatever that means.  Make sure
the original warranty period is carried over to the new serial number.

Good point.   When on battery, the "inverted" AC is not a clean sine wave.

Just a thought - you could try using a better quality SMPS DC power
units (similar to laptop SMPS units).

So why don't you consult him ,except this mail i do not see any other
mails to this group from you for what are you trying to thank the group for
?  why do you need us now for  ? , The problem with saying something like
this is public now especially on this mailing list i doubt anyone's true
intent i have seen people going all the way to asking people to acknowledge
the way you are trying to just to get there ego massaged.

Wow man. Did it ever occur to you that this might have been genuine?
Please stop this. This list has great content and is much bigger than
bloated and hurt egos.

And I wanted to respond to this rant with similar sentiments but you have
anticipated me :-)

Surely, someone being grateful to someone else need not annoy a third
person!

Frayed nerves on this list. Will take a few days to settle down I guess.

Here's my opinion:

1. Newbies should be encouraged to ask questions, and we should help them
patiently.

2. Girish is not a newbie, but someone who knowingly disregards feedback
from others on the list.
Many efforts have been made to get him to stop posting noise. Naturally
some are upset.

3. This Linux list is very Indian in flavor. Lots of dissenting voices, and
complaints, but very little action.
Perhaps the government that governs least is the best government.
Yet, this list seems to have no will to govern itself, whatsoever.
I could yell, and curse, and insult, and do anything here, and I will be
tolerated.
Who is going to stop me ( or Girish ) ? There are no moderators here!
Isn't it wonderful to know that I can dump sewage here? :-)

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

Normally this list is not moderated heavily, as almost all members are civilized and cultured.
After? Shrini intervened things became normal. If any list member likes another
member, that is not cause for intervention. I think you are overreacting. If need be we will step in again.

Hi,

I do not interested in indulging sarcasm, but a quick point,
Can we revisit the guidelines and

add

0a)  psycho correction of people  through bombarding them.
0b)  people can use filters to restricting the annoying party.
0c)  put all the mails in moderated mode for at least  some time where
other people peace is kept intact.

between , I am not taking any sides.

regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

Message-ID: <CAK2rq7wPjdL_yuYcBuJuXR8W5mfff_HiC3S_jMQurN6gBkZQYg@mail.gmail.com>

All,

In case you haven't seen this yet in planetkde.org - a success story
of how an England school has made the switch to KDE.

http://dot.kde.org/2013/07/04/year-linux-desktop

How I wish Indian schools emulate this model and reap benefits!

Interesting thought that I particularly liked in the interview - That
in a fast-changing environment, you anyways have to learn new
interfaces and ways of doing things.

"Once we decided to go ahead, a special newsletter was sent out to all
parents. We probably had less than half a dozen who disagreed,
maintaining that learning Office was a more useful skill. Whilst I
accept their views, I would argue that an 11 year old student starting
with us in September 2014 will probably not reach the job market until
2024 or there about. What will Office 2024 look like? Your guess is as
good as mine, but good basic skills and a logical and analytical way
of dealing with computers will be good for a lifetime."

The OP is not Girish. Nor has he participated in this thread. So why is he

My dear fellow, this list is far from worthless!
It is great place for me to come and learn about technology.
As a bonus, I can say whatever I want! Free Speech! Free Software! Free
Email filters for anyone who doesn't want to listen! Wonderful!
As you will readily agree, this list has great appeal for people like me
who contribute nothing of value, but like to dump entire paragraphs of
semi-coherent junk here.

I don't intend to leave, at all! This is so much fun! :-)

Cheers,

Well, I didn't hijack this thread.
I was merely pointing out, that unless some order can be brought, this list
will always be in chaos.
I feel that this list could be a lot better for all, if moderators
exercised their powers, in moderation, of course.

Perhaps, we should embrace the chaotic nature of the FOSS bazaar, and let
things be.

Friends.

Though we have around 3000 members in our list, only some 20 people will be
talking in the list.

I hope there 20 people are good background in the Foss world.

Rarely we are getting the mails from newbies.

I am getting many complaints as we are not newbie friendly.

When the experienced people are raising many issues and they want the list
to be fully moderated,
There won't be any discussion happening here.

Need your ideas and thoughts to make our list even better, newbie friendly,
filled with activities.

Share your ideas in this thread.

Thanks.

It's true... what I have seen so far. ILUG doesn't have that kind of
acceptance behavior which a novice or a learner wants. No one borns with a
knowledge. We should support everyone and help them to understand what they
want to know or learn. There are many senior and experienced people in this
list but I have seen very less support from them. If someone asks a silly
question(what-if (s)he asks,everyone starts from ZERO) don't underestimate
them. I have many things to say but I would like to wrap-up at this point.
I may be wrong for many so please forgive me for being straightforward.

1. We definitely need to be very newbie friendly. FOSS can be disorienting
to a newbie.
We should patiently help them get acquainted, and point them to useful
resources on the web.
A word to the wise is often enough.

2. We should treat this list as a community resource, like a river fresh
from the source ( no pun :).
If someone mistakenly pollutes the river, nothing needs to be done, as
civilized people realize their mistakes when corrected gently.
Yet, if someone is a habitual polluter of the shared river, and moderators
don't take action against them, then we are willingly agreeing to have
polluted river.
Please, use filters to deal with the pollution on an individual basis. We
are a polluter-tolerant community, and don't mind bad water quality for all.

3. Of course, allowing polluters means that newbies will always be
overwhelmed by the amount of noise.
Newbies will likely form the first-impression that FOSS is as half-baked as
the low-quality, inaccurate, non-fact-based, semi-technical,
NON-discussions that are posted to this list.
This is actually very bad for GNU/Linux in general.

4. We can actually do a lot better, for GNU/Linux, for this list, and for
anyone earnestly wanting to learn or share knowledge.
Diversity of ideas, opinions, speech, software, values, etc is a wonderful
thing. I believe that this Freedom can be balanced with a meritocracy.
All it takes is the will to remove polluters who have been warned several
times not to pollute.

5. If nobody has that will, then I will gladly help pollute this list,
until someone does.
Please use email filters if you would like to censor me.
I will be using Free Speech, and most people only want Free Software. :-)

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

Hi Shrini,

Here are my thoughts on this topic.

No one is forcing the remaining 2980 members not to post to the list.
Some might have voluntarily chose not to post while some might be
overawed by discussions and arguments. As much as they grasp the
negative things happening in the list, they should also try to catch
on to the positive things and try to follow them.

It is quite natural for newbies to hesitate posting to this list even
if this list was 'newbie-friendly'. What we request from the posters
is that, they should observe the things happening in the list and
listen to things people point them to. For example, whenever some one
asks a poster to follow the mailing list guidelines and not top post,
how many people really do that. A few might not understand what is
meant by top posting and why not to do it, but I have seen very few
asking more questions in this regard. All we is see is blatant and
repeated top posting even from a few old-timers on the list which is
not a good example to set imho.

For example if I am a newbie, my first question could be totally
insufficient in information or could be in SMS lingo. Some helpful
person on the list would have me asked me to provide details on what
things I tried, what error I am seeing and etc. and pointed me to
http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html. I should understand
that the person has spared some of his valuable time in trying to help
me solve my problem and has taken additional effort to point me to the
smart way to ask questions so that I am more likely to get an answer
or a solution to my problem. Taking it into consideration I should try
to follow all the guidelines I have learnt from my first post and the
responses to it and try not to repeat the mistakes.

How many times has this happened? I can say, barely few have gone
through this learning curve. We send the mailing list guidelines to
the new subscribers on joining the list and also send the link to the
mailing list guidelines in the footer of every mail so that people
take note, read it and try to follow it. This is not a free support
list for people to expect guaranteed answers to their questions or
solutions to their problems. The people on this list are mostly folks
interested in Linux (or GNU/Linux if you prefer to call it that way)
and free software and voluntarily share their knowledge and experience
to help people solve their problems. It is a two-way road, the same
people who help people solve their problems also ask questions when
they face any issues.

While this list has been self-governing all this time as Raman pointed
out, more and more people are starting to abuse it willingly. At such
a point there should be a little bit of moderation done imho. I agree
this a place where we promote freedom but that doesn't mean everyone
should blow their mouths off with the instantaneous things that comes
to their mind. After all, this is a public list and the archives are
available on the internet for everyone to see. So do people really
want to talk things and have them recorded in the history of the
internet forever linked to their name? While I could easily filter
such emails, it does paint a very bad picture about ILUGC which is so
untrue.

These are my thoughts from the perspective of a person who has been on
this list for a reasonable time.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

To a certain extent it is true and this has become like this in the last
2-3 years, I would say.

Also, there are lot of newbies who will be coming from Windows background
and would like to ask the questions from the Windows point of view.

Lot of replies from our side will be always like

this question has been answered but nobody gives the pointer that in a
mailing list everything will be archived and one can look at the archives.

But how many people are going to point to a new user - how to search an
archive?

Or this is the link http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/ where you can
search first and find out if your doubt has been addressed already.

Even for the new users who are registering in the mailing list - the first
mail he/she receives could be having this ( I don't know and it is
difficult to go thru the entire first mail with lot of details initially
and after some time you will be used to eh guidelines by just following so
one will not be checking the details at any time also)

So, again we need to take the questions from the newbies with lot more
sensibility and give the answers which will help them to come back to the
list again and again.

Also every new member should be mailed a basic understanding of Linux (for
a person who is familiar with Windows) which is easy for him / her to
easily grasp the fundamentals of Linux.

Somebody who is coming from Windows background - there will be lot of
shocks one will receive - like no C: drive or D: Drive and mount commands
etc., etc.,

So, somebody should write or give pointers to that so that it will be easy
for a newbie to understand.

Similarly there should be a simple one page for guidelines and what to do
and what not do in a mailing list.

I think explaining about top post/bottom post and trimming and how to do it
and why to follow that also is very important.

I have seen many times somebody who is senior in the list replying to a
newbie's mail that you are not supposed top post/bottom post etc., which
will be demoralising for a newbie.

These are some of my thoughts and others can add / modify this.

Regards

Ravi Kumar

      You can use any of the free/open CSS frameworks like
bootstrap[1] or pure[2]. Basically, they have a "reset" css, which
removes the differences between the layouts in various browsers. You
can use just that, and use your own customi CSS for the rest. Or, you
can use all their CSS features and customise just the colours used in
the website to suit your company's colour themes.

      You can do these with jQuery/YUI or some such library. Bootstrap
too supports these(IIRC, botstrap's JS is written over jQuery). I
would suggest that you try out possible options and use what suits you
the best. Please do not just go by what we suggest :) Thanks

[1] - Bootstrap - http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/
[2] Pure CSS - http://purecss.io/ (This is the CSS part of the YUI3 library).

       I agree that we should be newbie friendly. But, there must be a
limit at which we should stop. That is, we should help them learn and
use GNU/Linux. But we should never spoon-feed them. For eg, if someone
runs into an issue in configuring a web server, we shouldn't simply
say do steps x, y, z and you will be done. Asking them to show
evidence of what they have already done is not being unfriendly. It
just makes sure that they are not using the list as a free support
service.

       When people violate list guidelines, we do tell them that it is
incorrect, and suggest the right way to do it. That again is not being
unfriendly, it is just part of the learning. May be the tone used in
such responses look stern. We can try to do something about that.

      Also, we need to reduce the amount of unnecessary noise on the
list. At least on the list, we should stop showing hatred and inflated
egos. If people don't like mails from someone, let them just filter
those mails out. If people do like mails "about" someone, they can
simply delete that email and go ahead.

       I am not for moderation. We have been a self-governing list,
and occasionally, we do run into issues. But I guess we have enough
mature people to come out of it. Thanks

I have blocked Girish's emails. But there's no escaping them via anguished
responses of other members of the list :)

Why is there a reluctance in the community to give a warning to an
unresponsive member to stay on topic or get banned? This list cannot be
perpetually at the receiving end of an unlimited volume of a single
person's brain vomit.

+1. Most newbies ask questions without doing some ground work. We need to
be polite and not brush them off with brusque replies. Most members are but
some tend to come down hard. Teaching newbies to think and research for
themselves is key to building a sustaining volunteered support model.

Maybe we should ask newbies to tag their mails with [noob]. Will help those
not wanting to handle such traffic filter them.

One other way is to organise discussions under some categories/tags like
discussion boards which newbies can scan as they may not use the right
search words in archive search. Needs volunteer effort.

We can be polite at the first instance. Repeated mistakes need jolts to
move out of that rut. I've seen specific members' mails having top posts
repeatedly. I think we must have a short term suspension/ ban ( a month?)
for repeat offenders. This happens in every community and we need be no
exception. Hopefully some such mechanism would work well and not alienate
members permanently.

+1 no moderation. Lets be tolerant and use our own individual methods to
handle stuff that we do not want to read.

I also saw some one say less than 20 members are active on the list.
Speaking for myself, when I see the noise, rants, unasked for lessons etc.,
I tend to ignore them. The list has had a very large proportion of such
mails over the last quarter - large enough to draw ire and irritated
responses from otherwise polite, benign members. There was a much wider
participation before this sparring on the forum started.

I see this list as one where anyone with some queries and problems using
FOSS can seek help and can get reasonable, erudite replies. I think this
list does certainly fulfill that purpose admirably. Turning this into a
tutoring mechanism or a programming oriented content certainly skews the
participation. Do people participate here to beat their chests? I do not
think so and that is probably why such content draws sharp responses.

         Good find :) And good that you fixed it and documented how
you fixed it.

         On a related note, I very recently had a discussion with
some guys who thought you need to be a super efficient C programmer to
be able to contribute to any of the GNU/Linux related
projects/distros. We should probably look at creating awareness in
this area. We can be a valuable contributor even if we are good at art
work/GIMP(or what ever the tool people use for that). We need to
spread the word that all kinds of skills are needed to make a distro
successful. Thanks

Hi

Girish's mails blocked!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Iam a Newbie and I have learnt a lot from his posts.  I got a very rough
response for my first post but support came my way too.  I would kindly
request to unblock him once again.  If he gets demotivated then myself and
many other newbie's stand to loose.  Another member of this group
recommended me to join this group, participate in the discussions and get to
know more and also contribute later.

Whoever has blocked him, I will be grateful to you if you agree to my
request.

Ambarish Santhanam

I have blocked Girish's emails. But there's no escaping them via anguished
responses of other members of the list :)

Why is there a reluctance in the community to give a warning to an
unresponsive member to stay on topic or get banned? This list cannot be
perpetually at the receiving end of an unlimited volume of a single person's
brain vomit.

Dear Sir
Sriram has blocked himself from receiving emails from Girish. AFAIK, no one
has blocked any one posting to ILUGC.

Dear Sriram
It is possible that some people learn from him. And when others take the
trouble to
correct him people may learn too. So it is very tough to ban someone for
copious
posting *intended* to help. Even when there is a disagreement about how
useful
they actually are. (In this case disagreement between Girish and a large
number
of others). I tend to feel that there is too much of personalisation and
not enough
content; but I am not comfortable about banning for such reasons.

I hope you remember enough of me to feel that I agree with your judgement
but
understand your anguish

 Ok, here we go :). Sriram has blocked Girish's mail from his inbox.
Not from ilugc. So, you will receive his emails.

 But there is one other thing that you need to take care of - Top
posting. When you reply to an email in ilugc form Gmail, the cursor is
positioned at the top of the email text that you are replying to. If
you just start typing and hit reply, the list receives your mail in
what is called a top-posted way.

The right way to respond to emails in ilugc(and most other GNU/Linux
User Groups) is, hit reply, remove the unnecessary parts from the
email you replying to. Retain those parts of the email that you are
quoting, do an inter leaved response. For eg, if an email has 10 lines
and you are replying to lines 1,2,3 and line 8, remove all other
lines. Type your reply relevant to lines 1,2,3 below those lines, and
the reply relevant to line 8 below that. This style of posting is
called inter leaved posting. This wikipedia article[1] gives a good
explanation of various posting styles.

     No one expected such harsh response for your post :) So, don't
take it negatively. Thanks

One useful thing about tee which I think is a bit underrated is the "write to 
standard output" part -- the fact that tee not only consumes its standard input 
but also copies it without any modification to its standard output (while also 
writing it to a file), is awesome when you want to ^log^ an 'intermediary' 
state, eg:

cat somefile.txt | sort | tee sorted.txt | uniq

Dear Friends,

>From the conversations over here, I could understand that most of the
members in this group are computer geeks, who either learned coding or who
use it!

But, you should accept the fact that a vast majority of the people in our
state or nation (if not in the world) have a prejudice that Computer means
a CPU, Keyboard, Mouse and a Mointor with Windows !!
This includes Professionals too!!

Rarely we are getting the mails from newbies.
>
> I am getting many complaints as we are not newbie friendly.

Suppose a person somehow learns about Linux, tries it and finds it
interesting, but could not fix some issues!! He Learns from his friends
that a mailing list exists for LUG.  He joins the group and posts a
Question. The first Reply that may fall into his Inbox may be one among the
below:

"Why are you asking this Question here. This is very silly. Have you
searched in Google?"

"I think people know that there is a Search Engine Called Google"

"I think you can do a lot of Research by Google"

Friends, will he still be interested to ask questions in the List?


Seniors in the List may be Experts but, newbies are not (and they are
called so just because they are not!)

There is a Search Engine called Google, I agree. But, Googling cannot solve
problems. It requires the intervention of some humans!

Most people are not interested in Researching. They need their problems
solved.


And, yet there is another fact... All those people in the World (atleast in
India) do not know Coding (and they don't need to)!!

Till date, most people are not aware (even if aware, are afraid) of command
prompt. The reason behind the success of sale in so many desktops (or
rather Windows) is it's GUI !!

Had GUI been not available till date, I think that hardly 10% of the people
would have bought or used Computers!

Suppose for a Question, your answer is completely in Code.
Will all people understand how to try the Code?

Will they further try using Linux?
Is the above situation the goal of FOSS (or Linux)?


All those who use Linux are not grown up experts to feed themselves. There
are many new born or crawling babies !!
Please don't make them to die out by forcing them to grow up rapidly!!
IMHO, I am not asking to spoon feed people.

P.S: I am sorry if any part of my mail hurts anyone. I am also sorry for a
longer mail.

      I don't know whether you are a computer professional or not. But
let's take this as an example. Let's say there is a student of
mechanical engineering who goes home from college and and tries to
solve a problem in thermodynamics. He is stuck somewhere. What would
be the best approach ? Posting the question in some forum pertaining
to thermodynamics and waiting for someone to respond, or trying to
seach through the web to see if some similar problem has been faced by
someone and helped by others ? I would believe it is that latter. No
one would want to wait until someone in some forum to replies to their
query. So, why should it be any different in the world of computers in
general, and GNU/Linux or free software in particular ?

     I will also tell why I had to give such an  explanation - I have
been trying to help people use GNU/Linux for 7-8 years now. From what
I have observed, whenever we give a direct reply to people's query,
they almost always forget what the problem was, and how the problem
was solved. After a while they re-encounter the same problem, and they
again expect(even demand) someone else to fix it because that was how
it was done the previous time. There is no learning there.

    The objective of this list is to promote the use of free/libre
software, specifically GNU/Linux. But when we say "use" GNU/Linux, it
means that you are comfortable using the system and you can do basic
troubleshooting. I will further explain it with an example.

     Let's say someone wants to use a more recent version of firefox
than what's shipped with the distro. They download, and launch it and
it says xulrunner.so is missing. If they had googled for that, it
would have been the very first link. But people would not have done
that and would have simply sent a mail to this list. That is what I
call as "expecting to be spoonfed". That, in my opinion is bad.

       Agreed :) But all of us, when trying out something new, should
put in the effort to learn and then use it.

      Another valid point. But people reply based on what they know.
If you ask me how would someone know the IP address of their
machine(of course a bad question :) ), I would probably say "run
ifconfig". That's not because I want to reply with a "command", but
because that's what I am used to. If someone is used to doing it using
a GUI, they would respond as well. So, the person who asked it now
knows 2 ways of doing it.

Dear Friends,

You can file your income Tax Returns online now!!

Last year,  we had to download an Excel File, full of macros, fill it,
convert to XML,upload the XML and get confirmation back. It was tedious.

But, this time, they have made a more friendlier interface, a web based
one. This would enable you to fill the form online and submit it
immediately.

Click on the Buttom "Quick e-file ITR" in Link:
https://incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/

Remember.. Last Date for Filing Income Tax Returns is 31 July 2013.

P.S:
After Filing the Returns Online, you must download the acknowledgment slip
(ITR-V) , duly sign it and send it with attachments (if any) to Income Tax
Department, Bangalore within 120 days.

 I too agree with you that the latter approach is the better one.
But, when some newbie posts a Question for first time, people may provide
the answer.
As a foot note, the Questioner may be advised to search in the internet /
manpages before questioning.

I meant that harsh replies to newbies keep them out from questioning
again!!

I agree. Some Effort and new learning is required.

But, we cannot teach all people (unless they are interested to learn )  !!

For instance, if I convince a home maker to switch over  to Linux, he / she
will be interested only in doing things in GUI.  He may be reluctant to use
Terminal. Hence, a simple GUI solution is always preferred for simple jobs
(Like Printing, PDF Viewing, etc)
(Personal Experience of trying teaching :) )

You don't. It doesn't matter how MySQL stores the data.

If you want them to be displayed column-wise, you will need to update
your views to display them column-wise.

Data and presentation need to be separate.

Hello Purushothaman,

What you need to do is a PIVOT
http://www.artfulsoftware.com/infotree/queries.php#78

Of course, this might be better done in PHP.
That will take some programming.

Cheers,

FWIW, GNU sort has    <-u|--unique>  option to remove the duplicate entries.

Subject: [Ilugc] Need volunteers for book review program
Message-ID: <CAOdw4WsiRA87hTGLmDWWR_PPtvFsVBj_CPfNhbWEmnmF3Xp3uQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

    Recently, I came across a very useful program run by some book
publishing houses. It is called a 'User Group' program. It is a partnership
program, where the publishing houses provides user groups with
pre-release/newly released book copies for review. They expect the user
group to review and send back and/or post reviews in sites like amazon. It
is a win-win.

   The publishing house get to publicize the books, and as a user group, we
get access to cutting edge books.

    In our case, we can also provide these books to deserving educational
institutions and raise awareness about technology. (I heard recently that
Richard Steven's Network Programming has been published again. Wont I love
to have a look at it?!)

   But to do this, we need volunteers who will agree to review and post the
book's feedback.

   So, am sending this email asking for volunteers, who can commit some
portion of their time in exchange for a chance to do their bit for lugc,
and also to enhance their own skillset.

   Also, looking forward to feedback from the group. Please do send in your
comments.

PS: Bay Area LUG already does reviews like this - so this should be an
already well vetted program as far as LUGs go.

Regards,

Yes. It is pretty simple to fix simple bugs like this.

even reporting bugs is a great way to contribute.

I fixed two more similar issues too.

Message-ID: <CAND2794m3o5M5Ugrwee-E=M=Dac78pwZXq7iWG7bbo9Fb=W4HA@mail.gmail.com>

I was exploring an onscreen keyboard for ubuntu.
Found iok is interesting.

I was seeing the man page.

At the bottom, it says as

AUTHOR
       Suji A <suji87.msc at gmail.com> , Parag <pnemade at fedoraproject.org>


Wow. I know her. Suji is a member of ilugc and kanchilug.
She is from a village near to kanchipuram.

Some years back amachu told that suji was porting iok from fedora to ubuntu.
Nice to see that happened.

Found this in her blog:
http://suji25.wordpress.com/2009/09/01/create-debian-package-for-iok/

some old discussion:
http://markmail.org/message/ejps6ygrvw7qsxkk

It is a happy news that there are many contributions from india too.

Thanks Suji for the nice work.
Keep up the good work.

I use Mint KDE and Cinnamon and can definitely help in desktop
installations. I stay at Nanganallur.

How about setting up a stall in a prominent place (say, new Phoenix
shopping mall with a good footfall ) with laptops / PC's / R-Pi's
running different Linux OS's and FOSS? We can handover CD's for
interested folks.

I know this has financial implications but we can seek sponsorship
from corporates / vendors who sell Linux based hardware (Dell sells
Ubuntu models )?

Keen to hear other views on the topic.

@ Ramesh Kumar,

Your FOSS Lab setup initiative for schools and colleges is highly
appreciated.

LinuXpert Systems has been initiating the process of implementing FOSS
campuses (setting up of FOSS Repository Server, GNU/Linux Labs etc) across
Tamilnadu in all Universities, Engineering, Arts & Science Colleges,
Polytechnics.

We are looking for volunteers who can support our initiative.

We will be providing necessary resources like complete distro repositories,
free training for server / lab setup, travelling expenses, accommodation
etc.

Interested volunteers may contact me offlist for more details.

The correct way of storing time-series data in a RDBMS (mysql, postgres...)
is channels in cols and data in rows only. Typically RDBMSs can handle
millions of rows but not columns. Imagine running your
data acquisition over years. Also updating a single row with channels in
rows will be a nightmare and may not be even possible.

No you cannot. If you are writing a full fledged php application, you can
query the data normally, load it into an array and transpose it to get the
required results. Take a look at this:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/797251/transposing-multidimensional-arrays-in-php

If you only want to present data (manually), install phpmyadmin and export
your required data (got through a SQL query or search option) to Excel
formal. Load this excel file, copy the required cells and use the
paste-special>Transpose function.

Thanks for your words.

My initiative is not about implementing FOSS Labs, rather the people
understand the importance of Knowledge Freedom through Free Software.

Ok, I am not feeling tired in doing this.  But, I may stop doing this when
our education system realises the importance of Knowledge Freedom or when
they completely start using Free software for the academic purposes.

ehe, but that wouldn't demonstrate the point which was being made in the

Chill,

It seems this is the first mail from Ganesan Gopal to the list.
Am I right?

Is it possible for anyone to create a video tutorial on our list

    1. Please do not  top post
    2. Please do not hijack threads
    3. Euclid said, "There is no royal roadto geometry" - Meaning
there is no shortcut for learning. You can't learning anything within
one day.
    4. To answer your question, the best resource is drupal's
documentation available at their site.

Within one day?

Come on friend.
How can you learn a entire CMS in one day?

It is like you are asking to learn bus driving in one day.

Before learning bus driving, you need to learn so many things.
you should know

1. walking/running
2. road rules
3. traffic signals
4. two wheeler riding
5. any small four wheeler riding.

Like this, to learn drupal administration, you should know the following

1. Any GNU/Linux Basics
2. Installing Apache,MySQL,PHP stuff
3. Time/Patience to read documents/books and see videos

Watch these videos:

The Absolute Beginners Guide to Drupal  :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgYu7-DQjDQ
Site Building With Drupal - 01 : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWcWuszZV5k

Check this book too:
Master Drupal in 7 hours ebook
http://www.symphonythemes.com/how-use-drupal-7-hours-free-drupal-tutorial-beginners-ebook

A simple google search "drupal tutorial" gave me these links.

You could have searched internet before asking here.

We have some guidelines to post in our list.
read them here and follow the guidelines.

http://ilugc.in/mailinglist-guidelines

Wishes for your drupal explorations.

Friends.

We have some guidelines to post mail in our list.
We send the link to the guidelines when someone join the list.

Most of us wont read the automated mails fully.

When a new comer crosses the guidelines, we shout at them to follow
the guidelines.

He goes to the page
http://ilugc.in/mailinglist-guidelines

We give some instructions and new buz words like troll, top post,
bottom post, interleaved post
and some lengthy wikipedia page links.

Will the newbie have any patience to read all these full pages to know
the new jargons?

I am not sure how a new comer understands the example given on that page.

Even, the gmail hides all the quoted text. We may use other clients
like elm, mutt, pine etc
which display the text fully.

We can not expect that the new comers to use the desktop clients for emailing.

Thus, the new comers are getting confused to know about our guidelines.

In the meantime, when he receives some mails, he may ask some questions.
Like the same way he replies for any mail in office or gmail, he shoot
the question.

Alas.

He gets some replies with asking him to follow the guidelines, dont
top post, dont bottom post,
ban him etc.

He gets many replies, but none of them answers his question.
And the thread goes far away from the question.

When he sees the same for some more questions, he losts interest in
asking question
and he decides to be a silent watcher.

This is happens most of the time.

I completely agree with he should follow the guidelines for sure.
But, what are we doing to teach him the guidelines?

How many of us read these full length guides?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll
http://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

I am thinking on creating a video tutorial in tamil and english
to explain the mailing list guidelines with all the examples of

what is top post, bottom post, interleaved post, over quote?
How gmail hides the quoted stuff?
How to reply using gmail?
How the top/bottom post is pain in reading other mail clients?
How to reply to a digest mail?
How to put proper subject line?
How to search in ilugc archives?

etc.

There are fine screencasting tools available.
eidete and kazam are the best tools as far as I know.

Can somebody volunteer to create these videos?

Hope the newbies can watch the 5 min video to understand
the list guidelines.

What do you think?

Will it work?

Share your thoughts.

This email thread is about the "tee" command and your reply to the thread
is about OpenVPN which is totally unrelated to this discussion. What you're
doing is commonly called 'thread hijacking' which is a bad thing to do in a
mailing list. So I would recommend you starting a new thread to ask your
question. If you don't know how to start a new thread, just compose a new
email and send it to this list instead of replying to an existing email.

To get best answers for your problem it is better to do prior homework like
searching the internet for OpenVPN configuration for your distro. Learning
about OpenVPN before following the configuration steps on some website
would be very helpful. If you face any issues, get back here on this list
with the steps you followed, and the error condition you're facing.  While
there are a lot of experts and experienced people on this list, there is no
guarantee that you will get a solution to your problem. So doing the
homework before asking the question helps.

Pro- tip: Read the mailing list guidelines from the link present in the
footer of every mail in this list and try to follow them to stand a best
chance of getting answers to your questions.

Thanks and Regards,
Guruprasad

Even in case of windows people don't do a google search and expect
some one to answer. I have seen this personally even with
professionals who write windows applications. Here learning is the
problem and not the OS (or the attitude towards learning certain
things). Sorry if this hurts anyone.

In Linux problems are explained correctly. People just need to read
things that appears. Many used to click the "Yes" button or close it
without reading the contents and won't realise that is their problem.

People who write code in Linux don't know how to use it (saw this
personally and heard this from one of the ILUGC members too). In case
of windows applications are there (which are closed and paid
applications) to solve the issue but hard reality is people will
pirate it. In case of Linux piracy is present (or very little) and
that is the problem for those who don't want to pay / code.

This is not to hurt anyone.

In many cases, the thread gets hijacked by meta discussions. This thread
itself was meta, albeit intentionally. Now it has become meta-meta :-).

IMO, thread hijacking is the main problem that scares newbies away - they
ask a simple question and it gets hijacked by discussions that go
tangential at many levels!! How do we tackle this?

Subject: [Ilugc] jquery ui tabs
Message-ID: <CALDskyws6ruV1TrOT44g21=y05665APWi90+cL4+EvH23nqimg@mail.gmail.com>

UI tabs is actually a nice way to present content and in fact it works
well with many menu systems.

It is not a solution to all menu presentation but it does help in many
situations.

I took the example from the UI demo package samples but I modified to
illustrate two situations.

One is tabs invoked on mouse click which is default:

$('#tabs').tabs();

that is all.

or

$('#tabs').tabs({ event: 'click'});

In fact the selector $('#tabs') can be anything. I like to call it
that way. The id name is the one on which the
 divs are selected.

The content(data ) is presented thusly.

<div id="foobar">
             <ul>
                        <li href="#first"> First </li>
                        <li href="#second" > Second </li>
             </ul>
           <div id="first"> Hi, this is first tab </div>
           <div id="second"> Hi, this is second </div>
</div>

Notice two things here.

The div on which the tabs operate, the selector in the javascript code
is actually a container div for
 the tab headings and also the tab content.

The headings are a ul list which is linked to the tab content div id.

The href= is used to indicate that.

The code section is little complicated because I do some antics to
show the mouse over feature and illustrate
 which tab event is currently active.

But it can be just one line of code.

$('#tabs').tabs();

or

$('#tabs').tabs({event: 'mouseover' });

That is all.

$(function() {
                        $( "#tabs" ).tabs();
                        $('#cl').click(function() {
                                $('input').css({ color: 'black'});
                                $(this).css({ color: 'red'});
                                $( "#tabs" ).tabs({ event: 'click'});
                        });
                        $('#ms').click(function() {
                                $('input').css({ color: 'black'});
                                $(this).css({ color: 'red'});
                                $( "#tabs" ).tabs({
                                        event: "mouseover"
                                });
                        });

        });

It is as usual:

The last item in:

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/jquery_tutorials/

Now I will explain some more things.

The array data structure in javascript is not commonly used. Only for iteration.

The associative array, hash data structure is what is heavily used for
passing options for all jQuery APIs.

All of them work with the {} bracket style. The key value pairs are
separated by colon(:).

So

in spidermonkey:

$ js
js> a={name: "Girish", age: 18, hobby: "sleeping"}
({name:"Girish", age:18, hobby:"sleeping"})
js>
js> a["name"]
"Girish"
js>
js> a["hobby"]
"sleeping"
js>
js> b = [2,3,4, "girish"]
[2, 3, 4, "girish"]
js> b[0]
2
js> b[3]
"girish"
js> for(i=0; i < b.len; i++) {
 print(b[i])
}
js> b.len
js> b
[2, 3, 4, "girish"]
js> b.length
4
js> for(i=0; i < b.length; i++) {
 print(b[i])
}
2

4

I think you are taking a stance on admissible directions.
How many posts actually fall in that category?

If it is a newbie question, tag it.

not help them to lean themselves ]
3. You can search and give better google links
4. No extra moderation required [ existing moderation is enough ]
5. Not the "only 20" are active, many are Active, Watching, finding
solutions to the list queries
6.Avoid, Avoid, Avoid hurting people in the list. [ esply to the newbies ]

Great idea, I am sure it would work especially in this era of fast
food and less patience , I am sure people would consume and understand
a video better than reading the guidelines in text .

Hope there are some simple FOSS tools to create such video fastly .
Are there any FOSS tools which could be used , Please do suggest . I
wouldnt recommend blender as its cumbersome and we would be happy with
2 D .  But there would have been something which would help us !

Simple screen casting is enough for this.

Eidete or kazam are great tools for this.

                        center: latlong(),
                        mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP
                });
        });


Data:

<body>

<label for="lat">Latitude</label>
<input id="lat" name="lat" value="7.47">

Dear Sir,

It did not get to this situation after just a post or two. He does not
respond to well meaning feedback pointing out errors in his posts, or
requests to keep unrelated non-technical content out of his emails. His
posts are a mess of misinformation with a few hidden nuggets of truth.
Trying to correct him is like banging one's head against the wall. I feel
they do more harm than good, but that's just my opinion.

This is a discussion forum where people should have a meaningful dialogue
and learn from each other. If he wishes to deliver a monologue to newbies
he should start a blog and build a following there.

I hope you remember enough of me to feel that I agree with your
> judgement but understand your anguish


Sir, Yes I do. Presence of old timers such as yourself is one of the reason
I continue to keep checking ilugc.

I am no longer an active participant in the ilugc meetings and even the
list. But here we have one of the last surviving linux mailing lists in the
country with an active and thriving membership. It saddens me very much to
see the noise overtake the signal on the list in this manner.

It is the other way around.

The students are spoilt because they are given the most *important*
questions needed to clear the exam, or the *expected* lab questions in
the practicals. Unfortunately, the real world doesn't work like that,
and competition is stiff.

When step-by-step instructions are given to a student, they will
continue to expect the same in the future. It is just like people who
complain, will continue to complain. Their mind is already prejudiced.

So, when rubber meets the road for the first time, the friction
produces lot of heat. In our case, noise.

Girish, I would like to understand what sort of "menu systems" UI Tabs or
jQuery UI Tabs work well with? I am curious to know because this is an
angle I have not thought about before and I would love to know more.

Also can you tell us all what Menu Systems are, in general?

Girish, or anyone else who understood this post - please help me understand
these, please:

a) what did you just quote and unquote?

b) What's the lie? and What's the biggest LIE?

c) What were the animations that were shown but are not true animations?

d) What are the True Animations?

I hope there is at least one person other than Girish who has learned
something valuable from his original post. I would like to *please* hear

Completely agree!

Noobs are noobs and they cannot be expected to learn list ettiquette first
before they can learn about what they want!. So, what is more important is
guidelines for the old timers:
1. If it seems to be the first post of a member, only those who answer
their queries can point out the OP's etiquette transgressions
2. If you are compelled to respond in a tangent to the original post, then
start a new thread
3. Except for purely technical queries and responses, if your post is
longer than 140 characters, then just write a blog about it and post the
link here. Please do not trouble a captive audience *

That said, do not preclude adults who join the list perhaps NOT to learn
linux indepth to make a career out of it, but to just use it as they would
use a windows pc! If they want a fish and if you have one and can give just
give. If you dont just ignore and go your way.

* this post is excused because it is meta :-)

Length restriction only on opinions, metaphysical outpourings etc. Not on

started writing a reply to this mail past two days , but looked to me it
is going to be a rehash of what everyone is/were talking about . since the
concerns and situations faced by this list  are  not unique either  ,
thought a blog post will be more apt thing to do .

Hi,

Thanks for giving me guidance. Yesterday I bought a new harddisk (segate
ST9500325AS 500G cost 3.5k, not sure this is Value For Money, but just
bought it) and went through. Now, I'm posting this mail with the same OS
migrated and working from the new harddisk. Its worth of an ilugc session,
or atleast a blog post.

All I have to do is (from a live-cd)

1) create the lvm partitions with the same name as in the failing harddisk
(size doesn't matter but name matters and they should have enough space to
restore the backups)
2) restore the backups
3) modify /etc/fstab to point to the correct partition for /boot (this step
is not needed if you have /boot in lvm, unfortunately, my /boot is not in
lvm, so I have to modify /etc/fstab to get rid of the UUID which points to
one of the partition in my failing harddrive)
4) generate new /boot/grub/grub.cfg
5) install grub into boot sector.

thats it, restarted and I'm done. All works fine (atleast no impact to my
day-to-day activity). Now I know how these cloud admins clone hundreds of
nodes while eating snacks.

Thanks,
Mohan R

Well, I wish I could have told something better. But when ever I do
something good, this group has always found faults with it. It was so
demoralizing.

Any way I have the tenacity to fight back the rotten old people (old here
means old minds, definitely not age) who dominate this group. But the
youngsters simply choose the ignore option. Kill this group, let the young
ones start something of their own.

This group is like Indian National Congress after independence. Quiet
useless other than 1 or 2 things. What to say! Even very good people in
India want the young ones to obey boring customs. Better they perish.

Personally, I have realised two things on online fora. The first one
is that attitudes and emotions cannot be conveyed fully over text. So,
a genuine, harmless suggestion to follow list rules could come off as
being an order. So, the second thing I've learnt is that one ought to
cultivate a thick skin and be ready to learn.

There are a couple of things here. Your attitude of fighting back is,
if anything, worse than the very shortcomings you allude to. For
instance, let's take top-posting as an example. It has been pointed
out several times that top-posting is not considered appropriate on
this list, in various tones and with different levels of vigour. Yet,
you don't seem to like it, and continue to top-post. I am guessing
that that you view this as a mark of defiance. That probably makes you
feel happy, but to the people who prefer that the list recommendations
be adhered to, it is very inconvenient and unnerving. And all it
achieves is to anger more people, than improve the situation. Now, if
you did back down from your position and comply with list rules, we
could stop having these endless arguments and focus on useful
discussions.

I don't have an appetite for political commentary. However, note that
you are quite free to start your own list with the values and ideals
you consider important. If you do create a forum that you think would
be more appropriate for like minded people, please announce it
here. That way, we needn't argue constantly and raise tempers, and
people needn't be held back by the whims and traditions of the members
of this list.

Thanks.

Subject: [Ilugc] slider UI element
Message-ID: <CALDskyxxPG7jaQkA=9tZ=LCP262xVCCyniD9ckyHZfEoSuktFg@mail.gmail.com>

The slider UI element can be used to obtain input from the user in
lieu of the HTML form mechanism.

Different input elements are checkboxes, radio buttons, input boxes, textareas.

Slider is a nice option for values that indicate a range.

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/jquery_tutorials/ui-slider.html

The code is simple

 $(function() {
                $( "#range" ).slider({
                        range: true,
                        min: 0,
                        max: 500,
                        values: [ 75, 300 ],
                        slide: function( event, ui ) {
                                $( "#amount" ).val( "Rs" + ui.values[
0 ] + " - Rs" + ui.values[ 1 ]
);
                        }
                });
                $( "#amount" ).val( "Rs." + $( "#range" ).slider(
"values", 0 ) +
                        " - Rs." + $( "#range" ).slider( "values", 1 ) );
        });
        </script>
</head>
<body>

<div id="range"></div>

The data is also included.

The slider is showed in the range div above.

The lower end value is accessible using the .slider('values', 0) API
and the high end using the .slider('values', 1) API.

Hi Girish,

Thanks for the work..
I would like to support with few pointers which you may ponder in your work.

The code which you have given is partial and incomplete.

If you are interested in explaining the slider function, make it
explicit that the above is a  partial part/skeleton/snippet  of the
code.
Putting myself in the shoes of noob, I may be wondering where is the
element #amount.
I know how to find a source of a web pro gramme, but that not
guarantees every noob to know it.

Probably if you say the following in the onset , it might help a bit

level : noob/intermediate/expert
prerequisite : Knowledge of what are dom elements, worked with any one
of the javascript library like jquery. mootools, extjs,etc.

One kind suggestion, *please subject your work to a peer review*,
certainly it helps a million mile journey.
Thanks once again for your effort.

Thank you, manivannan!

Even though I am far away, I will be at the install fest in spirit!

Volunteers, please add your contact information to this wiki:

http://linux.wikia.com/wiki/GNU/Linux_Install_Fest

Help improve this document, for a successful install fest!

Here are a few suggestions. Please, feel free to respond with your thoughts!

Approach the whole install fest with a pragmatic mindset.
Assume that users are interested more in free software ( gratis, as in free
beer ), than Free Software ( libre, as in free speech ).
We want new people to start using GNU/Linux, so we will call it "Linux" for
the sake of this install fest.
People will discover and appreciate Software Freedom, and start calling it
GNU/Linux on their own.

Identify what the new user wants to get out of their computer:
1. Surfing the web
2. Email
3. Social Media
4. Games

Explain how Free Software can meet these requirements, and more.
Explain how Free Software may be used to protect security and privacy.
And finally, explain what freedoms Free Software brings.

Glad to see the enthusiasm about this festival!
Penguin power!

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

Lol, thats a good one.

How does the Linux Install Fest work? Do the volunteers stay at one place and people bring their laptops or computers? Or do the volunteers go out to sites on request?

Actually I just copy pasted from the jQuery UI sample.

You should thank the original developers.

The latitude and longitude of my place I know by heart.

That is all.

Well, thanks for saving us the trouble of copy pasting. :)

Actually, I rather enjoy reading the Linux command usage instructions,
posted via email each day.
I learn something, because the poster mindfully summarizes the most useful
options to pass to the command.

Surely, THIS is the great LIE you alluded to, earlier.
As much as I would like to believe you, I don't think this is all, at all.
:)
I have a dreadful feeling that we are in for another round of:

   1. copy from jQuery docs
   2. paste into email
   3. obfuscate
   4. send to a captive audience of thousands
   5. ignore all cricism


Girish, please be social, not necessarily sociable.
We're all into machines, but we're people first.
We can read the nitty-gritty details about machines elsewhere.
There are so many topics to explore, and nobody is interested in all of
them.
This is, or should be, a place of community.

Here is an off-color remark ( of which I make plenty :).
Please stop reading if you choose.

If you have a HUGE penis, but no skills to talk to people, do you think
you'll get laid?
People will try to chase you away, the moment you reveal your massive
talents.

Now, on to my destination!

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

Srini - One thing am concerned about installation is many of us ( an
assumption that i make, i could be wrong) *do not* have experience in
new machines that ship with Windows and use UEFI as boot. i have read
up a bit on the topic but nowhere near having thorough awareness of
the subject.

Suggestion: It will be great if we can request someone from group to
conduct a brief session in any of the upcoming ilugc meets on UEFI,
Secureboot concepts and how-to-do on linux installation on such new
machines.

I am not sure if i have hijacked this thread. Apologies in advance.

Subject: [Ilugc] traveling by bus or plane with jQuery
Message-ID: <CALDskyx9_3sfHYC67WV8O6gbCD_JSDXx9K=2LC9Teukg8BMeDg@mail.gmail.com>

You can book tickets by bus or plane using this method:

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/jquery_tutorials/ui-selectseats.html

It uses the selectable() API of jQuery UI project.

The code is :

 $( "#selectable" ).selectable({
                        stop: function() {
                                var result = $( "#select-result" ).empty();
                                $( ".ui-selected", this ).each(function() {
                                        var index = $( "#selectable
li" ).index( this );
                                        result.append( " #" + ( index + 1 ) );
                                });
                        }
                });


        });

This code begs explanation. Hold on.

Let us look at the data:

<p id="feedback">
<span>You've selected:</span> <span id="select-result">none</span>.
</p>


<ol id="selectable">
        <li class="ui-state-default">1</li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">2</li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">3</li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">4</li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">5</li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">6</li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">7</li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">8</li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">9</li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">10</li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">11</li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">12</li>
</ol>

So the selectable regions are listed using the ol html element.

Which is nothing but ordered list.

And the class is given as "ui-state-default". Perhaps you could select
them beforehand.

I have not tried it.

Now imagine you are going to travel by bus or plane.

And the seating arrangement can be depicted this way.

Using CSS.

And you can book the tickets you desire by dragging the mouse. If you wish to
 select the seat that is far away you can press control.

Okay the code is complicated because the seats selected are shown.

Otherwise it is pretty easy.

Just $('#foo').selectable().

But we are waiting for the user to stop selecting and when that event triggers
 we show the user the seats he selected.

$( "#selectable" ).selectable({
                        stop: function() {
                                var result = $( "#select-result" ).empty();
                                $( ".ui-selected", this ).each(function() {
                                        var index = $( "#selectable
li" ).index( this );
                                        result.append( " #" + ( index + 1 ) );
                                });
                        }
                });
          });

We are waiting for the stop event and the function() body is given as
a hash value.

Note the {} and : separator.

So stop is the key and the function body is the value.

Now the #select-result id is actually the region we gave in the html
body where the results would show.

First we are emptying it with empty() to clear the previous selection.
Then we are iterating thro' the
 ui-selected class and using the jQuery each() API we identify the
seat number using the index and
 selectable li selectors.

Then we are appending it to the result id.

@ Shrini - I request that you, as list owner/moderator, instruct
Girish to stop them completely - not just for a while.

He has admitted copy/pasting examples from somewhere else without
giving any reference to the source in his original posting.
IMHO, this is plagiarism and perhaps copyright violation also.

We can share "gyan" by posting links to the original content and not
copy/pasting them here.

You can now download all the code samples as one zip file.

However the samples will not work because the source jquery files and
stylesheets are not included.

I will fix that soon.

Fixed the bug.

Now the jQuery source files as well as CSS files are included.

Let me know if you face any issues.

But that adds to a lot of noise.

I use only a small subset of the stylesheets and jquery source but all
are included.

I think the samples being in a different folder will kind of make it
easy for you to test them.

I would think not. Copy pasting with your comments / opinions interspersed

If he can do all this in a blog, he can build a fair following - especially
as there are some here who like his posts! Not to mention, code can be

Hi All,

First of all I would like to thank the entire FUEL Project community for
their greater contributions to the success of the initiative we started
five years ago. With the help of community volunteers and organizations we
have achieved remarkable milestones through our journey till date.

Building the language standards in the open source and making it freely
available in the open domain is one of our motto behind starting FUEL
Project. Our objective is to establish a common and universal platform to
support continued development and adherence of GILT standards by building
the consensus for it's development, establishment and promotion with the
help of community and organizations working towards the aim of
democratization of content and wider awareness and acceptance of these
standards.

The FUEL GILT Conference 2013 is being organized by Red Hat and C-DAC GIST.
In this conference we are gathering industry localization experts,
linguists, internationalization engineers, testing professionals working
towards language technologies.

Participants would get a chance to network all the localization experts
working in the industry as well as able to grab more opportunities
available in this domain. There would be learning for the beginner
localizers as well.

Keeping these objectives in mind we have identified following tracks for
the papers:

    1. Globalization, Language and Translations (Something that showcase
the importance of language, culture, it's role in the modern life, etc.)
    2. Standards: Linguistic resource (work towards Terminology, Glossary,
Dictionary, Style Guide, Unicode, CLDR, FUEL Modules, Script Grammar, etc
would lead into this category of development.)
    3. Tools & Technologies (An effort in the direction of development of
translation management systems, Rendering Systems, Quality Assessment
tools, Fonts, Input Methods, etc. would lead into this category.)
    4. Localization in FOSS (The volunteer localization efforts in the FOSS
world, how they contribute, what they contribute, etc would fall in this
track.)
    5. Open Track (Anything related to GILT and relevant matter could also
be considered provided we get a space to allocate you a slot.)

For more details about the conference, its venue, registration and paper
submission please visit here:

Please feel free to write to us if you need any information regarding the
conference.

Thanks!

Subject: [Ilugc] CGI to bundle files together
Message-ID: <CALDskywyFYHHLMGJmUrDmU3UzgG7Wm4ZcAk-eM_v=fyYQh9hDg@mail.gmail.com>

Here is the js and the CGI.

You can click on any element and invoke a function. They need not be links.

Here I am invoking a click handler on the h2 title.

  $(function($) {
                $('#dlall').click(function() {
                        $.get('/cgi-bin/dlall', {},
                        function() {
                        location.href= "/dload/jquerysamplesbundle.zip";
                                }, "text");
                });

        })
Instead I could select for $('h2').

Same thing. Then I am invoking an Ajax call to the CGI dlall and once
it finishes
 I am changing the location of current page to the bundle zip file.

You can do this only if the MIME type is not known to the browser.

If it is a video or audio or html or txt or pdf then the browser will
change the page.

In this case it downloads.

The CGI is:

GI;

$q = new CGI;

print $q->header;

unlink("/var/www/htdocs/dload/jquerysamplesbundle.zip");

chdir('/var/www/htdocs');
`/usr/local/bin/zip -r dload/jquerysamplesbundle.zip jquery_tutorials/* `;
`/usr/local/bin/zip -r  dload/jquerysamplesbundle.zip css`;
`/usr/local/bin/zip -r dload/jquerysamplesbundle.zip jquery `;

This is very simple perl code. Mostly done using the zip shell command.

I guess you've made a copy-paste error. "use CGI;"?

Could you please just post to a blog and then send the link in? That
way, it is much more logical to read than having to look through
disconnected e-mails that have copy-pasted code.

Thanks.

Hey check this out http://tutorialcodeigniter.com/ .
http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/tutorial/ you may possibly do
your sample projects rather than depending on some one.

You have to guess the language using the unicode values of the text provided.

Project Silpa has implemented this.

Live demo: http://silpa.org.in/Guess_Language

Source for this module: https://github.com/copyninja/guess-language

Get the source and explore how they have implemented this.
You can use the same concepts to do your tasks.

Actually that is why the website is given from where you can download
the samples.

#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI;

$q = new CGI;

print $q->header;

unlink("/var/www/htdocs/dload/jquerysamplesbundle.zip");

chdir('/var/www/htdocs');
`/usr/local/bin/zip -r dload/jquerysamplesbundle.zip jquery_tutorials/* `;
`/usr/local/bin/zip -r  dload/jquerysamplesbundle.zip css`;
`/usr/local/bin/zip -r dload/jquerysamplesbundle.zip jquery `;
`/usr/local/bin/zip -r dload/jquerysamplesbundle.zip images `;

To provide the source of CGI I will have to do something else.

I did that very long time ago in LUG. I used to convert the code into
syntax highlighted html and I sent you
 the link.

So all along I have been publishing my samples using my web resources.

Though blogging and stuff like that I am not familiar with.

Subject: [Ilugc] libkural
Message-ID: <CAND2797gqSc3B19gvq-YJerVc8e0tqb60LERpO9sE+_wEBG9KA@mail.gmail.com>

When I was exploring the packages available in the ubuntu repository,
I found BibleTime.
A software to study bible in different ways.

Wondering, if there is any search tool for studying Tamil literature
like Thitukkural.

Found a library. libkural.
https://github.com/arcturusannamalai/libkural

It is a python library which provides the Kural, its english version
and english meaning.
Using this we can build widgets for KDE, GUI apps, fortune kind of scripts.

But it is missing the Tamil meaning.

Many authors like Mu.Va, parimelagar have authored tamil meaning for Kural.

I wish to add the tamil meaning to the libkural.

Which version of Tamil Meaning for Kural is available for public usage
in public domain or creative commons license?

Can anyone share the url of the tamil meaning content with these license?

Thanks.

AFAIK, the ownership of the above versions are with the publishers.
You could try talking to them. I do have permission on Mu. Va.'s

parimElazagar urai must be beyond reach of copyright. It is many hundred

Me too joining the speakers,

Talk: Disk Management with LVM

Want to share my experience when I migrated from a failing hard-drive to
a new one without loosing the OS. I'll cover the below sub-topics,

1) Disk Partitioning with LVM
2) Taking Backup with LVM snapshot
3) Restoring backup in a new disk and starting the same OS.

Thanks,

I have given a bunch of tooltip examples. There are plenty of plugins that
 do that too.

Tooltips are a very effective way of providing customer help in

They can also be used to annotate images and so on.

Message-ID: <CAP6xennU3Du3Dp7ezf4t_7OPdedB7eWX9RhVRcaf+1HQq7vowA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I want some inputs, please help me in this.

I want to install Windows7 (which I don't want but for some work I have to
do it unfortunately) on my external HDD (Seagate, 1TB) mounted as /dev/sdc1
(FileSystem: NTFS) on my base OS (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS).

# Doubt 1: Total size of my HDD is showing in GParted is 931.51GB, I am
fascinate where is the rest space?

# Doubt 2: 600GB is full so it means I have 331GB remaining. I want to
allocate 80GB to my Windows7, after this I will have 251Gb free, which I
want to use for storing Data. I tried to resize my 1TB HDD using GParted
and Resized my HDD and assigned 80GB which is shown as unallocated. Upto
here I am fine but when I want to apply the changes I got a warning as:

*****
Moving a partition might cause your operating system to fail to boot.
you have queued an operation to move the start sector of partition
/dev/sdc1. failure to boot is most likely to occur if you move the
GNU/Linux partition containing /boot, or if you move the Windows system
partition C:

Moving a partition may take a very long time to apply.
*****

So please be kind to guide me should I go further or not? I don't have any
other media to take my backup.

Thanks in advance.

Hard disk vendors count the disk space in terms of powers of 10. 10^3
bytes = 1 KB, 10^3 KB = 1 MB, 10^3 MB = 1 GB, 10^3 GB = 1 TB. But
computers and operating systems see the same storage in terms of 2^10
bytes. 2^10 bytes = 1 KiB, 2^10 KiB = 1 MiB, 2^10 MiB = 1 GiB, 2^10
GiB = 1 TiB. So after applying these conversions, it comes to
approximately 931.3 GB which is what GParted shows correctly. Check
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabyte and the table in the page for
more details.

Subject: [Ilugc] Ubuntu 13.10 replacing X.org with Mir
Message-ID: <CADtvZWDZe-BnXf9+SO56Ln9a1Evm5-2kGt2fJ_CocLDzx-obkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Some of the recent announcement by Ubuntu clearly mentioned that their
latest release 13.10 will replace X-window server (X.org) with their own
Mir-Display Manager.

I strongly feel this is going to make a big impact in the Linux
Community/Developers. Even-though the license is GPL, I think they are
planning to reach the Eco-system that Android and Apple is having.

In some of the blog entires Ubuntu has mentioned that Unity 7 will run atop
of XMir, an implementation of X that provides a compatibility layer
that allows software, desktop environments, peripherals and multi-monitor
setups designed for X to continue to work as expected.

But am not sure about how feasible it is .Looking forward to hear your
inputs.

About Mir -

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mir/

PS: Kubuntu has announced that they are not planing to switch to Mir. Below
the comments made by Jonathan Riddell of Kubunut-

"A few months ago Canonical announced their new graphics system for Ubuntu,
Mir. It's a shame the Linux desktop market hasn't taken off as we all hoped
at the turn of the millennium and they feel the need to follow a more Apple
or Android style of approach making an OS which works in isolation rather
than as part of a community development method. Here at Kubuntu we still
want to work as part of the community development, taking the fine software
from KDE and other upstream projects and putting it on computers worldwide.
So when Ubuntu desktop gets switched to Mir we won't be following. We'll be
staying with X on the images for our 13.10 release now in development and
the 14.04 LTS release next year. After that we hope to switch to Wayland
which is what KDE and every other Linux distro hopes to do."

What you need is not 'calling', but 'embedding'  - you should be doing this:
            $('#box4').css('background-image', 'url(images/<?php echo
$filename; ?>)');

and, btw, this applies not only for jquery, but any piece of the html/php
code.

Nice to hear

But it is missing the Tamil meaning.
>

Thirukkural itself is in Tamil. Why do we need yet another meaning ? LOL!!
I think you meant commentary!!

 Which version of Tamil Meaning for Kural is available for public usage
> in public domain or creative commons license?
>

 Though many have authored commentatory, only Mu.Va's version is easy for
understanding. His words are so simple that anyone can understand.

Though commentaries of Parimezhalagar, Manakudavar, etc are under CCL now,
they are hard for commoners to understand. The complexion itself may cause
simple readers to close the application.

I would recommend to use Mu.Va's commentary as prime (along with
Parimezhalagar & others)

BTW, Thirukkural reader is available for Android!!

My suggestions / comments may seem to hijack the thread. But, I am
presenting a commoner's view. Sorry if the mail is more of OT

This isn't usually the recommended way to do it. It gets unmanageable
once you start working on bigger applications.

One way would be to use CSS classes, it is a good idea when you don't
have too many variables to handle. e.g. you have to alternate between
white and red backgrounds you can do try this
http://jsfiddle.net/3T2rJ/

This works when the choices are known beforehand and very limited. If
you need something dynamically generated using the server side script
you can try http://jsfiddle.net/eJX2W/
What this does it that it keeps the javascript part clean. You can
serve JS code from external file, which is good for performance
reasons.

PS: My JS skills are not too great so my code may not be optimum, if
so you're welcome to improve upon it.

There is a slim possibility that things can go horribly wrong and you lose
your data. So, if the data is not that important you can go ahead. If it IS
important, then arrange a temp media where you take backups and go ahead
with resizing your partition.

Backup is like insurance. You wont need it until things break. You decide
what sort of insurance you want and proceed accordingly!

Is this not a redhat distro family specific command? It also requires the relevant package to be installed via the package manager and not source, for it to work, IIRC.

It appears that since 2009, Debian and Ubuntu have had the service
command. See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=534300

However, one needs to install it.

Ditto for chkconfig (origins from Redhat) the equivalent of
update-rc.d in Debian/Ubuntu.

openSUSE also provides service and chkconfig since version 10 or 11.

Everybody and their grandmother in the linux DE developer community
hates cannonical for their announcement. They should have worked with
wayland to sort out their issues, instead one day they announced Mir
out of the blue with a rant about wayland as their reason (which
turned out to be nonsense anyway).

On a positive note, their announcement made both gnome and kde guys
hurry up with their support for wayland. I see Ubuntu as a falling
distro which was once great.

I am sure Mir will be as successful as unity.

Message-ID: <CALDskyxn5jeEjFqN2Dxm7hRas8JTVnUKLF7UDm8F30hn+QKgXw@mail.gmail.com>

using the sortable plugin. This is from the UI project.

http://awrdev.g3tech.in/jquery_tutorials/ui-sortable.html

The code and data are too simple to mention.

The data is basically a list and list items are sorted using the mouse
drag and drop.

Using this you can easily construct jigsaw puzzles by breaking an
image of some picture.

Or you can give a section of a Rubik's cube.

There are other applications too.

If someone can make Tamil (or any other Indian language) translation

I think first it needs to be investigated whether change would be needed
only in the application section or also at the driver level.
Then we need to study the amount of changes to the existing code.
Then only we should move ahead.

If the licenses are fine and software/work is free as in freedom then
it is fine provided the work is not against the interests of the free
software movement and human values. Funds can be accepted from anybody
provided there are no strings attached in the context mentioned.

We must always be cautious about hidden motives and ensure that valid
rights are not compromised.

Generally accepting advts or sponsorships without strings attached is
not a big problem.

Problematic areas can be "porting free software to proprietary OS",
"education portals with vested interests", "Free News portal with paid
agents", "Surveillance", etc.


academia.edu is better than researchgate.net as far as commitment to
open access is concerned. They are not well designed though.

Since *jobs* is bash's builtin shell command for checking background jobs,
it is better to avoid creating alias in the name of existing
internal/external commands.

Hey,

Atleast with Ubuntu, the default .bashrc calls an external script
.bash_aliases if defined in the home folder. Write all your custom aliases
here so that you don't clutter your .bashrc and also have a neater
organization of aliases.

Cheers,
Abraham

+100 :)

Likewise 'test' is a no no.

As a general practice, I prefix the string "my_ "  to the alias name
to avoid conflicts with 'installed' utils and built in functions.

$HOME/.bashrc is there for all users.

Further one can split aliases and functions in separate files and
invoked from $HOME/.bashrc

e.g. [ $HOME/.bash_alias ] && . $HOME/.bash_alias  (note the period
before the pathname).

Yes. I meant "# vi ~/.bashrc" settings will take effect only for the
root user since it ("#") is being edited for the root user.

in most cases log files give enough clue.   Look at the apache error logs.

share the outputs of the following commands.

ls -lh /var/www/alphamember_list.html

ls -lh /var/www/api/combined-members

ls -lh /var/www/api/combined-members/getAlphaList


Hope these files may not be there or they dont have permissions for
apache to read.
The owner of these files should be www-data.

Hmmm.
This means that there are some files missing.
Check the files inside the folder /var/www/api.

Place the required files there.

Hope you have some version control system implemented for your development.
Chekcout the latest code in the /var/www directory.

Otherwise, check that you restored from correct backup file.

Compare the files in  /var/www/api/ with your wamp setup.

Message-ID: <CAJLBBzwVHD5=oSNe_tFWmENdemhfG992-wkKiaACahtg6+1Diw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I  am in need to install multiple linux distros to my laptop. Currently i
am using Ubuntu. It is good for Desktop users. But some of the libraries
(latest version) required for SW development are missing in the ubuntu
repository .

So i am thinking installing fedora . But i dont want to loose my Ubuntu
also.

Unfortunately, i have only one partition in my harddrive. completely used
by ubuntu.


Can i reduce the partition size ?

When i google-d, there are some articles shows , we can install multiple
linux distros and each distro require one (root) partition. and swap
partition can be shared .


Can some one tried this? Please share your views.

thanks
suresh

Hi,

Check the permission of every folder(r-x) and file(r) right after www for webserver user.

This is the most common problem when you move files between windows and linux.

As far as I know, Ubuntu is good for desktop and development. Yes, you have
to install some libraries manually.

Last time, I tried to install Debian(squeeze) along with Ubuntu but failed

Gparted is the ideal tool to be used for such a situation.

What is the size of your hard disk copy/paste out put of "sudo fdisk -l"

>

Depending upon the size of  the hard disk and the number of distros
you wish to install;  you need to do some planning **before** you jump
to gparted as others have suggested.   Keep one partition for /home
that you can mount on all the distros (you may need to change the
uid:gid if there is some mismatch.

What libraries are you looking for? Ubuntu has a system of PPA
(Personal Packaging Archives) repositories that will have the latest
version of various software before they are tested enough and
integrated into the main distro. You can also try the Ubuntu
development release (it is pre-release software, so there could be a
lot of bugs) which should have newer versions of software and
libraries. I run Debian unstable on my laptop and it is running
absolutely fine without any issues. YMMV.

Hi ,

 I have a doubt in php and mysql. i want to retrieve column values from two
tables in
single combo box. Both table will have same values but in one table some
values will be empty. so unique values should be return in combo box  i.e
empty values should not be shown.


For example :

Both Tables have same values in different languages

Table 1  product name in english language
Table 2  product name in spanish language (some values will be empty)

But unique values should be shown i.e empty values should not be shown.

Sorry, I did not see the source.

The other way would be through a better mail client or gmail plugin.

Hi Shrini,

>We have our Meet on July 13, 2013

>Check the details below.

>ILUGC Monthly Meet (July 13 2013):-


After long time i have attended the ILUGC monthly meeting.
It was a good experience.

Thanks to Raman P for  dcmtk tool kit presentation and showed the
opensource penetrations in Medical software field.

After this session, some thoughts in the mind,

Opensource software has matured enough across all the fields. But many of
them not aware of those software.

Can we start collect Top widely used open-source software used in across
the fields.

Such as,

1. Medical.
2. Education (Maths, English ,Physics,  School mgmt etc).
3. OFFICE utilities
4. Networking
5. Research/graph etc.

Probably some of you may used in your experience, who can share their
experience in ILUGC monthly meet and list those software in ILUGC web
portal.

Please share your views.

Thanks
suresh

Even this kind of initiative would be very helpful for those who promotes
Open Source in their town like me. I have been asked many times regarding
Open Source softwares in these fields.
A request to all those who are using these or working on these kind of
softwares please share your experiences.
Thanks in advance.

check out by the command ifconfig whether what output you get
If you are facing the problem there are chances you might not get the ip address in the output. For the naive people in simpler words the output will be just one para and not 2 as it should be.
Try this link
http://pratiklahoti.wordpress.com/2012/06/26/ubuntu-12-04-the-system-network-services-are-not-compatible-with-this-version/



For me this link dint work but for many the above link worked so try that out first

My experiment:
1. sudo? vi /etc/network/interfaces
you will see the lines:
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

instead type:
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static

address 192.168.1.5
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1

Now do:
2. sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
Paste below lines:
nameserver 127.0.0.1
nameserver 192.168.1.1

now restart your network with:
3.sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

now check
4.ifconfig 
?

5.ping diaspora.com 
If this gives response your net is working ....Hurray!


6.sudo service network-manager restart

This is basically called static ip

Let me know whether it works or else what error u get take a screenshot and mail me

Subject: [Ilugc] Issue on virtual users in Postfix
Message-ID: <CAA7cRDNCFvkHGS4dtTE6Vwj8NnXJV1k1E+EFQ=0jZH+bQ+x2Xw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

         I have implemented virtual users (user without system account) in
postfix on Centos but not working.

I have done below things in main.cf file

      # vim /etc/postfix/main.cf

                 myhostname = example.com
                 mydomain = example.com
                 myorigin = $mydomain
                 inet_interfaces = all
                 inet_protocols = all
                 mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain,
localhost, $mydomain

                  virtual_mailbox_domains = .
                  virtual_mailbox_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/vmailbox
                  virtual_mailbox_base = /vmail
                  virtual_uid_maps =
static:5000                                             ## i created vmail
account and set uid and gid 5000
                  virtual_gid_maps = static:5000

       # service postfix restart

       # vim /etc/postfix/vmailbox
         test at example.com  example.com/test

       # postmap /etc/postfix/vmailbox

       # mail test at example.com

But i am getting *status=bounced (unknown user: "test")* in *
"/var/log/maillog"*

Is this the complete log?

Everything seems ok except the bounce.

Did you create the example.com/test maildir under it?

Any email setup also requires corresponding DNS.   In your case have
you setup a 'local' DNS server for example.com?

Nicely done. Providing a pointer to research and find the answer, yet leaving 
the door open to seek additional help.

This is an excellent example for our community to follow and flourish.

 From the BSD MAN pages:
     du -- display DISK USAGE statistics

Subject: [Inpycon] Python Month
To: "Mailing list for the PyCon India conference" <inpycon at python.org>
Cc:

PyCon India, the premier conference in India on using and developing the
Python programming language is conducted annually by the Python developer
community, represented by Python Software Society of India. The conference
attracts the best Python programmers across the country and abroad.

This year, PyCon India is celebrating the month of August as Python Month,
with aim of increasing the awareness and awesomeness of Python Programming
Language within the student community in India.

WHAT IS PYTHON:

Python is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that can be used
for a diverse area of software development. It o?ers strong support for
integration with other languages and tools, comes with extensive standard
libraries, and can be learnt in a few days.

Many Python programmers report substantial productivity gains and feel the
language encourages the development of higher quality, more maintainable
code.

Some of the biggest names in the industry like Mozilla, Google,
YouTube,Dropbox, SurveyMonkey, Bitly and numerous others also use Python
for providing the services a lot of users are familiar with.

Because Python is very easy to learn and at the same time very powerful, it
is used as the first programming language in introductory courses of
Computer Science in many universities and high schools.

In India, Kerala state and CBSE have already adopted Python in their school
syllabus.

HOW YOU CAN HELP

Python month will be organized and completely run by volunteers, anyone who
wants to participate is welcome and all help is appreciated.

This is a big task to handle and therefore requires lot of volunteer
support. Here is how you can help.

1. If you are a Python programmer and please give a talk / workshop at a
college in your city.
2. If you are a professor or student, please facilitate the a workshop in
your college.
3. Help us in coordinating Python Month by talking to colleges to arrange
workshops.

hi lugs

linux mint 15 virtual box not working

logs

Kernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)

The VirtualBox Linux kernel driver (vboxdrv) is either not loaded or there
is a permission problem with /dev/vboxdrv. Please reinstall the kernel
module by executing

'/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup'

as root. If it is available in your distribution, you should install the
DKMS package first. This package keeps track of Linux kernel changes and
recompiles the vboxdrv kernel module if necessary.



the dkms package is installed

sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup

Run this and share the results.

Message-ID: <CABD5kLfHqjWcWtsSA2-O80GEBxhSFauO7e_S7bdnA9NWR85vyQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I had a couple of questions:

   1. Is there a limit on the number of wifi users supported by a wireless
   router?
   2. If yes, can you suggest a router that can support 50 concurrent wifi
   users?

We are using Belkin and Netgear routers, but are facing issues when too
many people connect.

Not a direct answer to your question but an alternative thought.

I've not used more then 10 on a wireless AP. However, I do expect these
routers to have this issue. From a long term cost and availability
perspective, these are still the best bets over higher end equipment.

Can you not rig up a set of routers on a ethernet backbone on the LAN (WiFi

Hi Imthiyas,

Sorry to Interrupt this thread, but for sake of goodness, please write
your mail properly and don't use SMS lingo ("n" for "and") when you post
to mailing-lists like ilugc.

If you are a student and spend lot of time sending SMSs to your friends,
take some time from your busy schedule and look at point 5 in this page,

http://ilugc.in/mailinglist-guidelines/

And finally, No "sir" please, It only belongs to "Sir" Ravindra Jadeja.

Thanks,
Mohan R

Subject: [Ilugc] 1D1C - parted
Message-ID: <CALV9ombnih0Z_DqJbxtjsT3hbNyx+7W+KjF0S_mF+L1kdpdCHg@mail.gmail.com>

command: parted
purpose: parted  is  a  disk  partitioning  and  partition resizing program
             for large size hard disks

syntax: parted [options] [device [command [options...]...]]

example:

1. To choose the device to edit

     # parted
       (parted)  select /dev/sda

2. To display all partitions

    # parted
      (parted) print

3. To create primary partition of 20 GB in selected hard disk

    # parted
      (parted) mkpart  primary 100 20000
      where 100 and 20000 is start and end points in mb

4. To create logical partition of 10 GB in selected hard disk

    # parted
      (parted) mkpart logical 20000 30500
      where 20000 and 30500 is start and end points in mb

5. To create a file system on partition

    # parted
      (parted)mkfs

6. To resize partition from one size to other

    # parted
      (parted) resize 3
       start? [20GB]? 20GB
       end? [30GB]? 27GB

      size of partition 3 is actually reduced from 10GB to 7GB.

7. To copy data from partition 2 to 3

    # parted
      (parted) p

     p prints the partition layout
     umount both source and destination partition before copy

     (parted) cp 2 3

8. To remove partition

    # parted
      (parted) rm
      partition number? 3

     the partition with number 3 is deleted

9. To set units in MB, GB, TB respectively

    # parted
      (parted) unit MB
      (parted) unit GB
      (parted) unit TB

10. To create partition and filesystem together

      # parted
        (parted) mkpartfs logical ext4 20000 30500
        logical partition size of 10 GB ext4 fs is created
        20000 and 30500 is start and end points in mb

11. To exit

      # parted
        (parted) q

Hameed I don't think there should be a problem in getting them connected
however if you are using 802.11g the max throughput theoretically would be
54Mbps, practically ~40Mbps =~ 5MegaBytes/second of data transfer if a
single user gets connected.  So if you were to connect 10 users they may
get a maximum of ~512Kbps each which may be good enough only for browsing.

The maximum you can do is co-locating (i.e) have three WiFi router working
on Non-overlapping channels of 1,6 and 11 to increase the number of users
to 30 and still have a decent speed of connection.

If you have 802.11n supportable AccessPoint then a single AccessPoint can
support upto 150 - 300 Mbps which would be really good to support 30 users
with single AP with ~ 512KBPS, however the down side is you would need all
your clients to support 802.11n (Hardware related not software) as well.

Hameed you can able to connect 50 users with the netgear and tplink also. I
already tried with this in our college.

One more thing you didn't mention the model of yours.

Arun

Both the Netgear and Belkin routers are N150 model. Would they be able to
support 50 users? We have around 30 desktops sharing a 2 Mbps connection
through Digisol USB WIFI dongles. Planning to migrate to a 4 Mbps / 8Mbps
connection soon. We would have around 50 computers soon.

Message-ID: <CAP6xennbWwFx5tBp8+-QiWet+xP4tXfk=Qcsosts44M781kQQg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

I need some information regarding my doubts in wordpress website.

*Issue 1:*
I want to UP my wordpress website (static one) which I have created on my
localhost. Could you help me how can I upload it on my cPanel? Before
disturbing all of you I tried google for this and got some info that I have
to change the '*wp-config.php*' settings and have to copy the database file
to the cPanel. I got confused regarding the database file location on my
system.

My website folder is at following location:
*/var/www/wordpress*
*
*
In this folder I have wp-config.php file but I am unable to locate database
file. When I use phpmyadmin, I am able to see my database. But where is it
located?

Is there any one stop solution or link to my query that how can I upload my
wordpress website folder to cPanel?

I followed this link:
http://www.theeduzone.net/theeduzone1/?p=45

*Issue 2:*
When I changed the Permalinks to Custom One, I am unable to access my
website on localhost. I changed it to as:

%/postname%/ and %/postname% (tell me which one is valid)?

I also googled for this and got to know that I have to  modify .htaccess
file or I have to change the Apache mod_rewrite settings, but from where I
can change it?

I followed this link:
http://hightechnology.in/wordpress-custom-permalink-not-working-in-localhost/

*Issue 3:*
On my theme homepage (name: discover (free one)) I have 4 Box headings but
I want 3, I messed up with php code and deleted the 4th box code but it's
still visible on the theme? I also googled for my issues but failed to win
over this issue.

On my home page I got a message as:
Not Found Apologies and so on....

I want to remove this so I googled for this and found that I have to create
static front page, i created and it's not visible anymore but the page
which I created is now appearing on my menu list which I don't want. I
followed this link:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_a_Static_Front_Page


*Issue 4:*
*
*
If I continue with all 4 boxes on my homepage (in case if it's not being
rectified) then why do 4th box overlaps on 3rd box in Firefox but it's fine
on Chrome.
I used firebug on both browsers to figure out the difference but failed.

Please help me in these issue so that I could be able to UP my website.

Thank you in advance.

Step 1: Zip your wordpress directory

Step 2: Export your local wordpress database via PHPMyAdmin

Step 3: Upload your wp zip file using cpanel filemanager and Extract the
zip to root(public_html - If you pasted in this folder means you can access
your site eg: http://www.yourdomain.com) directory or some other
directories.

Step 4: Create a database and database user in Mysql database then import
your local database through phpmyadmin

step 5: Now goto your wp directory and edit database name,database
username/password in wp-config.php and save it
Now check your site URL.

I think we cant do it in mysql. Because of string 'S'.
But found some link if id is number
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1389605/sql-find-missing-ids-in-a-table

But we can do it with some scripting language like ruby or python to solve
the issue.

Getting all ids and generate ids of array from (S001.. S00N) and compare
those array. May be its not best solution. But we can achieve through some
scripting language.

5.  A file system with a "label' can be mounted using
LABEL=<label_name> in /etc/fstab.
     for instance --- mkfs.ext4 -L <label_name> /dev/sdXY

Thanks Baskaran for the help. I did as you mentioned. I am confused at just
one point:
I uploaded the Zip file on cPanel and then extracted it but it extracted in
as another folder called as wordpress means not all files on
*public_html. *It's
in a folder (public_html/wordpress). I am not able to access my website
might be because of this issue. Should I need to move all file to *public_html
*from *public_html/wordpress? *Please help me in this.

I created a database and database user in MySql (on cPanel) and imported my

I changed below mentioned fields in *wp-config.php *file:

define( 'WP_HOME', 'http://www.mydomain.in')
define( WP_SITEURL', 'http://www.mydomain.in')

// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'abc');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'peter');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'xyz');

/** MySQL hostname */
define('DB_HOST', 'mydomain.in');

I am confused in MySQL hostname (last mentioned field), what to write there?

Please help me. Also help me in my other issues.

Thank you in advance.

Hi all,


If i try to open http://www.annauniv.edu/ (Anna University website) it
shows a blank page from my office network, using Zentyal firewall server.
This is happening from past 1 week, none of the changes is made in firewall
machine.
if i try to open https://www.annauniv.edu/ (By Using HTTPS) it is working.

What would be the issue? How to resolve it ?

Thanks in advance

Just move all the files from wordpress dir to public_html using Cpanel file
manager
- Select all the files inside the wordpress dir then click *Move icon *in
File manager (On cpanel)
- On move dialog window enter the path /public_html then click move files
button
That's it.

Use *localhost* for hostname
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');

Just a conjecture: maybe the firewall is filtering based on content and is
blocking the site because it has some 'unwanted' stuff whereas it cannot
peek inside https and hence just lets it pass through!

usage:  queue, examine or delete jobs for later execution
            executes commands at a specified time.

syntax:  at [-c | -k | -s] [-f filename] [-q queuename] [-mMlv] -t
time [date] [-l] [-r]

    $ atq

    or

    $ at -l

4. To remove the schedule job

    $ atrm 5

    or

    $ at -d 5

    will delete the job number with 5

5. To schedule jobs from file at 10 am apr 13

    $ cat duejobs.txt

    /home/mercury/sample.sh

    $ at -f duejobs.txt 10 am apr 13

6. To process a command

    # batch

    $ at now + 1 day
    will execute command 1 day from now

    $ at now + 2 days
    will execute command 2 days later from now

0. Excite them with something like "Best on and outside the earth"
1. Intoxicate them with user friendly transitions
2. Addict them with the power even with GUI
3. Convince them with what responsibility that power brings in
4. Let them experiment with _their_ time savings.
5. Coach them economy of "Time=Money"
6. Elucidate the TCO and Hence the ROI factors.
7. Corrupt them with ultimate commandline power.

It has always worked.

Never Confuse them.

Even PHBs can be attracted.

I suggest you to invite FOSSEE team from IIT B. They will conduct
scientific computing on python workshop if you can arrange for systems and
organise it. Check it out.

Message-ID: <CADGU_bsEB0-Y6VzMGVhix9VsjiBhVNrYuRbGeXFtmbSLe3t41w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello People,

Just want to know is there any group for Indian Electronic Hobbyist. I see
that people are greeting more interested in software and are quiet
forgetting what makes software really run.

I am also quiet ashamed that many electronic engineers (including me)
haven't soldered a single component to  a PCB :(

Is there way to turn things around.

      Looks like HTTP is being blocked - most likely a content scan.

     Seems to allow this. But to check if there is some content scan
being done, just try once more with --no-check-certificate. that is
wget https://www.annauniv.edu --no-check-certificate . Thanks

Message-ID: <CA+3=756YY-GKq2c_HzK14ckpCU6g2hWKLizPCC3XCm+K-LkG+g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

One of the companies in Hyderabad wants to do a network audit for an
Organization having around 1000+ Computers spread across 4 offices. They
have asked me for Linux based solutions in this regard

This company is using around 4 Linux Servers, 4-5 Windows Servers and all 4
offices are inter connected using point to point links (offices are spread
in different cities).

They would like to do a network audit to find out if the network is working
at optimum levels or not and any improvement is possible.

They have some network topology diagrams which have been manually made.
They have a mix of Cisco/Linksys Managed/Semi Managed and unmanaged
switches and Routers.

I have suggested the following:

1. NMIS & Open audIT from Opmantek
2. NMAP with ZenMap
3. The Dude from Microtik (not GPL but free)

They would like to achieve the following:

1. Dashboard showing Automatic network topology maps
2. Network Performance


Apart from the above, I would like to know from this group

Is there any better software which will give an automated network topology
diagrams?

Any pointers in this regard will be appreciated. Nagios is also suggested
but the company is looking for more of a network audit than NMS.


With Best Regards*

TSS Ravi Kumar

Message-ID: <CAND27973u12-L+byjw9xmsbsBpfe7c5ua_SnhdTDQoVi7ObbPg@mail.gmail.com>

Yesterday, I gave a talk on "Introduction to Free Software"
at FirstPlanet.in (opposite to LIC building, Mount Road, Chennai)

Around 20 freshers attended the session.

I explored the following stuff.

GNU/Linux History
Free Software Philosophies
Ubuntu Linux Installation
Partitioning tips
Alternate applications
Introduction to Commandline
Installing applications
Intro to ILUGC

They are organising these kind of workshops/session regularly for fresher.

Wondered to know that their main business is to provide support,
customizations for
the open source enterprise applications
compiere, http://www.compiere.com
openbravo, http://www.openbravo.com
pentaho http://community.pentaho.com

for around 4 years.

They are interested in ILUGC activities and they are happy to provide
place for any events.

Already they host the java user groups meeting and chennai astronomy
group meetings.

I invited the CTO to give a talk at ILUGC meet on running business
with open source software.

I thank for the firstplanet.in team for their great services.

Hi,

This is to inform you that the regular registrations for PyCon India
2013 will close in 7 days. After this, the ticket cost increases to Rs
1500 and your chances of getting a ticket reduces.

Why go through all of this trouble ? Book your tickets now !

A few seconds ago (24/July/2013 14:40) I was able to see the site
content with <http://www.annauniv.edu/>

It could be a problem at your site that is blocking content coming in.

What do you want to achieve?
Do "you" want to get in to soldering stuff? or every electronics engineer?

If you want to, then buy the following.
Soldering Iron,
Lead,
Flux,
multimeter,
perf board.

Buy some basic self assembly kits from Richie street to play around,
something like LED blink, or running some motor or sensor etc.
You can also buy some Arduino or any other eval  board in the market and
use online community to assist you. Arduino has cover most of the
application which you might want to do.

If you want to learn basics then get this book
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Electronics.

Or if you want to create your own circuit board and solder, then I would
actually recommend Eagle CAD software, but KiCAD is the open source
alternative, although its in development, I hear that its getting better.

If you have an arduino you can buy ATtiny controllers, These are 8 pin
programmable devices and you can flash them using Arduino.

Note that I am not a electronics guy by academics, if you have interest
thats enough.

If you compare software and hardware, the major issue is the cost, every
new thing you want to try in hardware needs money and it may fail to work
;), the rest is self explanatory.

If no one knows of any group, we could create one? I m pretty sure IITM's
CFI team can help a lot in this regard.

arch will display the architecture that OS is compiled for. It will
not show the hardware's architecture. In a x86_64 machine a 32bit
(x86) OS can be installed. In that case arch command will say x86 (or
i686 or whatever).

I have seen you are explaining about commands but that is not complete
unless how that works. Explaining that will let people know more and
they will turn into a geek.

Good that you mentioned this, its really a nice tool. I would also
recommend this,
Comparing commonly to other tools, it has 3 views.
bread board view, schematic view and PCB view.

There are symbol libraries available at:

There is no need for a new group, I find ILUGC as best may it be embedded
or web or anything else, well thats my opinion.
lets keep this group as it is and freely discuss electronics and open
hardware here.

The URL is a reference on what exists. With F/OSS, you have the
freedom to create your own libraries. Everyone has different needs,
and one needs to make a self-assessment before deciding if it suits
them or not.

Yes, I have used it.

I remember using Zabbix for generating some parts of these diagrams.

It is a monitoring tools

Perhaps you should look at some SNMP tools. Some google-fu needed here

Yes Agreed.

Also with other closed software when it comes to libraries you have that
freedom, still its worth mentioning.

Yes thats fine, But in this context!, I do know some FOSS enthusiast and
entrepreneur who had trouble with KiCAD footprint having some problems with
libraries where the PADs of the footprint had extra junks ,It costed extra
bucks to make the footprint design on their own and send it again to a Fab,
it cost no matter if its an open license footprint, or closed one. Thats
the reason for asking you. In Hardware sometimes self-assessment can
totally fool you.

May be I'm a n00b, but how do you say that he is behind a proxy and the
proxy is doing content scan if he is connecting to the original IP of
www.annauniv.edu ?

I did the same thing from my machine using firefox, both http and https
urls works fine but for https I have to add certificate exception.

when doing from curl, with --insecure, both urls works. Also, it works
when we use wget like this,

$ wget --user-agent=fscku http://www.annauniv.edu
$ wget --user-agent=fsckus --no-check-vertificate
https://www.annauniv.edu

To OP,

Which browser you are using? IE6???? or do you altered your use-agent
string for some other purpose?

Thanks,
Mohan R

Sure, can, because the F/OSS licenses are clearly defined, and widely
used. Unfortunately, different proprietary tool vendors have their own
terms and conditions.

You missed the point. If it really was a bug, it could have been

That is your decision, and I'd leave it at that. I'd prefer not to use

Hi Krishna,

I too love to have a group with lot of open electronics enthusiasts who
can share interesting things happening in electronics world to guys like
me (I'm from CS background). Those kind of electronics related posts
makes no sense in software oriented ilugc (just my openion) and if any
flame-war starts, it will add more chaos to ilugc.

And not to forget, Sakthi Kannan is the lead developer of Fedora's
"Electronics Lab" spinoff.

and the ssl certificate looks horrible.

* Server certificate:

OU=SomeOrganizationalUnit; CN=localhost.localdomain;
emailAddress=root at localhost.localdomain

It looked like childish when I see localhost.localadmin being used in a
reputed university's SSL certificate and not to mention, it got
expired!! I think they are using the default signatures created when
apache (mod_ssl) got installed in that server.

If anyone here knows annauniv's webadmins, please ask them to follow the
steps below to create a proper self signed ceritificate or ask them to
properly have a CA signed SSL certificate (Comodo CA charges 64$ per
year or ~4000/- INR, I don't think its a big money for Anna Univ).



$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key.withpassword 1024
Generating RSA private key, 1024 bit long modulus

$ openssl rsa -in server.key.withpassword -out server.key

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated

What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a
DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:IN
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:TamilNadu
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Chennai
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Anna

Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Computer Science Department
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:webmaster
Email Address []:webmaster at annauniv.edu

to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []: [leave blank]
An optional company name []: [leave blank]

$ sudo mv server.key server.crt /etc/ssl/apache

  Hi,
  the prime thing of  1D1C is only synopsis of a command and few examples
  after go through man pages. Explanation of how a command works,
  what are the processes it initiates  ... etc will take more time and space
  to explain which is not possible for me here. i am also in the learning phase

  If possible you can explain a command with a complete how it is working
  i will try to post these things in that manner in a blog which may
be useful for
  freshers.

+1 - the purpose is to expose the a plethora of tool set available in
GNU/Linux distros.

+1 You are doing a great job.  It is well nigh impossible to cover
every nuance of the options some tools have (find comes to mind).

The fun part is experimenting with the options and appreciating the
power of such tools.  By doing so, the individual becomes empowered to
solve problems on their own.

Individuals who feel that additional examples of the tool, adds value
to the discussion, should post them here.
(I have done it on a couple of occasions).

+1 to your efforts for F/OSS. It's nice to know about the contents because
very soon I am going to address few young minds on F/OSS. But as of now I
have seen very low interest from students and teachers regarding F/OSS,
don't know why? Majority of the students just want to complete their degree
and teachers are really in a very bad condition (regarding new
technologies). I really feel bad when they advise students to run their C
code in Turbo C compiler, where are good teachers, who could help new and
young minds to explore new things. All engineering students just want to
get job in any MNC's (TCS, Infosys, et al).

I talked to many people regarding what they do when they face some problem
in their (office, school or college) network, they simply said that they
call those (dumb) computer engineer who don't know about anything REAL
computers (most of them use cracked or pirated softwares) which is very bad
for an enterprise. I advised them (here in my case: I advised my friend who
is working in a school as Computer Teacher) to make your own brigade of
Real Computer Engineers (because they have sources and resources), who
knows almost all nitty-gritty details about basic computers, networks,
client/server arch, information security and digital forensics so that next
time if you face any problem they can solve and get real experience) which
could help them in future for sure and there would not be any need to call
or assign those computer engineers who just make money out of nothing. I'm
still hoping for the BEST result.

1. Please trim your quoted content - e.g. no need to see ILUGC footer
in your quotation.

2. Prima facie, the problem appears to be in your network setup.
Report the issue to whoever administers your network and the gateway.
 I can see the content of www.annauniv.edu with both http and https
using chrome version 28.0.1500.71.

Aircel partners with Wikimedia Foundation to offer free mobile
Wikipedia access through Wikipedia Zero

Aircel subscribers to be the first in India to have free access to
Wikipedia on their mobile phones

SAN FRANCISCO and NEW DELHI -- July 25, 2013: Aircel and the Wikimedia
Foundation today announced a partnership to offer Wikipedia on mobile
phones without any data charges to Aircel customers. The alliance is
aimed at making knowledge available on Wikipedia accessible to all
Aircel customers in both rural and urban areas for free. This is the
first service of its kind to formally launch in India.

This partnership is part of the Wikimedia Foundation's Wikipedia Zero
program, which focuses on reaching the billions of people around the
world whose primary opportunity to access the internet is via a mobile
device. The partnership will help provide Wikipedia to 60 million new
users in the region.

Anupam Vasudev, Chief Marketing Officer for Aircel, said, ?Through our
alliance with the Wikimedia Foundation, Aircel is not only making
internet services reach a wider audience, but also helping to
encourage and enrich the lives of our customers by offering access to
knowledge and information free of cost. We are excited about this
partnership and hope this initiative will benefit all our customers
from various age groups.?

?We hail Aircel?s commitment to enhancing and expanding access to free
knowledge for their mobile customers. With the partnership, we extend
our program to India where we potentially reach millions of people for
the first time.? said Kul Takanao Wadhwa, Head of Mobile with the
Wikimedia Foundation. ?Aircel is one of the operators across the globe
that has contributed towards expanding free access to Wikipedia Zero
to 470 mn mobile users.?

Aircel customers will be able to access versions of Wikipedia in
English, Hindi, Tamil, and 17 other Indic languages.

Aircel is a young, data led telecom player and has been continuously
innovating products and services to offer convenience to its young
customers. The company has recently introduced various noteworthy data
products like Pocket Internet Smart and the recent Pocket Internet 24,
which offers internet at less than 1 rupee a day. Therefore, Aircel
aims to empower and inspire the youth by enhancing their data
experience.

Subject: [Ilugc] AdBlockPlus Whitelisted Google
Message-ID: <1374755029.13497.87.camel@host0.silentcrooks.org>

Hi,

I'm not sure how many of you are using AdBlockPlus and noticed google
Ads appearing when you search for some product (eg: ssl certificate).

It seems AdBlockPlus whitelisted Google because Google is paying money
to them. Not only google, there are lot of companies paying AdBlockPlus
for whitelisting,

http://dottech.org/25096/what-is-acceptable-ads-and-how-to-disable-it-adblock-plus/

This webpage discusses about why AdBlockPlus allows Ads. It also shows
how to quickly disable "acceptable-ads".

But I feel, sooner or later, AdBlockPlus will remove the checkbox and
not going to provide a way for user to disable "acceptable-ads". I felt
betrayed by AdBlockPlus. So, thought of doing something to remove the
Google Ads myself.

Then I came around greasemonkey and its ability to manipulate DOM. I
started writing my first greasemonkey script and finished with
'DisableGoogleAds.user.js' which will remove advertisements from google
whenever you visit google websites.

I have uploaded it to userscripts.org. If you don't want google ads in
your browser, then follow the steps,

1) install greasemonkey extension
2) go to http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/174141
3) click install button on the top right corner.
4) enable the script in Tools->Greasemonkey->Manage User Scripts

Thats it. hope you enjoy google advertisement free web.

Thanks,
Mohan R

we can't simply avoid this Google ads.. It may help us sometimes when we
are looking for some specific product or service we got one site after
searched and we entered in to that it contains information along with
Google ads you may see that the ads are quite related to what you have been
searched it Will be usefully when you are express urgency of resource.

Thanks,
Hope you take it good,
Guru.

It is loading the USB storage drivers because the device presents

What is the volume of inbound traffic are you anticipating i.e. no. of
hits / sec?  You need to have some idea about this and do some
capacity planning before jumping into load balancing.

nginx - powerful (small foot print) reverse proxy; designed from
ground up to do load balancing.

We have 47 volunteers registered so far all around the tamil nadu.

Without having a core group to help them for any queries, it will be very
tough
to run this event.

If no one is interested to volunteer for core group/primary contact,
wondering how to proceed further.

Message-ID: <CACm7z1bQzrpWAZ85EpHs5S7a87RRKWNMmKdM-LUv_azZZp4-Rw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have got a small question regarding working with Live USB.
Let's consider the Debian as the distro I use. (I believe it doesn't matter
in this subject).

Question: How can I persist or keep my files in Live USB even after a
Shutdown or Reboot for next time to use it?

Description: My Hard disk has recently failed. So I am not able to boot via
HDD. Temporarily using the OS via Live USB. My HDD has failed and cannot be
accessed at all. So, I wanted to work with LIve USB and store the files
(Ex. documents, codes, pictures, etc.,) to the remaining space available in
the USB drive, so that I can use the same file even after reboot. I know
the Persistence mode while creating Live USB will persist the applications
Installed. But it doesn't seems to persist our personal files saved to home
directory. I believe there should be a way to persist files in Live USB.

I searched in search engines regarding this subject, which again produced
links targeting Persistence of settings and applications but not files.
Thanks in advance.

It is a really simple question.

To persist files you have to run a read write file system.

The best way is to normally install the preferred distro into the USB Disk
(instead of using the regular liveusb creation methods) .

Hi,

There is a program called pendrive linux, which I use to create live Ubuntu
USB Sticks,
There is an option in that you can select and make the filesystem in the
USB Driver persistant.

Hope it helps.

Thanks, By the way are you sure it persists files? Because I have used
UnetBootin, which can persist profiles and settings, but not files.

Yeah, I believe that Live boot uses squash fs, So in this case, do I need
to make it read-write system? Is that possible?

The general idea to keep it readonly is to preserve the life of the USB
sticks. USB sticks have a limited number of write cycles after which they
might fail. If you still want to persist files, partition the USB stick
using fdisk/cfdisk. Keep the second partition for persisting data. Install
the live linux distribution in the first partition. After booting into the
live linux version, format the second partition as ext(x) (or FAT32 if you
want to exchange files with a windows box). Later you can manually mount
the partition. You can create a symbolic link from the home directory to
the mounted partition.

No. Ubuntu USB Disk Creator's Persistence option should help. It
preserves files also across reboot. It uses a union fs on top of the
root fs.

Hope this helps,

As most users in ilugc uses gmail, when they reply to the thread, they fail
to notice the text below the three dots (...) and simply hit reply without
quoting the text properly.  Hence all the recent mails got top posted in
the list (mainly by the gmail users).

I request the moderator to include/highlight the above point in the ILUG-C
list guidelines (especially for gmail users) to avoid top posting
repeatedly.

Buy a cable tester and run the automatic test mode.

It may not be crimped properly. Pins 2,3,8 are important.

All the 8 pins should be properly terminated and the colors should be visible.

Check this out.

http://www.incentre.net/ethernet-wiring-diag.html

By the way this subject is not OT.

Only political and non technical discussions are OT.

Commercial too.

Arrant Nonsense! I don't know who gives out those electronic degrees!

Actually in TIA 568B (100Mbps) CAT-5e, Pins 1,2,3,6 are important --
White Orange/Orange and White green/Green Pairs. It is the same for
CAT6 too.

Crimping should be proper in any and every case.

If you use an good branded crimping tool, the stripper part is there
which helps us strip exact length required inside an RJ45 Connector.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYm9GIAlaIk


BTW, I just realised that there can be hardware trolls too with wrong
(and potentially dangerous) information. Such info can smoke
(sometimes) expensive components and cause more downtime and damage
than a silly jquery or PHP code.

Moderator please filter such posts.

http://www.vogella.com/articles/EGit/article.html is a good tutorial on
usage of EGIT for Android programming.

If you are going to learn to use git, I would recommend learning to use git
from command line instead of learning to use egit. It will have help you
more and is definitely more powerful than EGIT.

Hope that helps,

With warm regards,
Abraham

The video looks good however I am doing this for my home so I cannot afford
to buy the crimping instrument :-(

This is what I finally did as shown in the image[1] to spot the segment
which was wrong, each time cutting the single wire(Orange) which was
missing the continuity and checking with the aid of the multimeter which I
purchased while I was in College.   Along the way I spotted that the cable
has worn out a lot and it is better that I purchase a new one.

I looked at ebay and came out with two products as shown in link [2] RS300
and [3] RS899, why is there such as huge price difference, Is it because of
Quality ?  Suggestions welcomed.

Then buy ready made LAN cables; they come in a myriad of lengths
starting from 1m to 10m or more.

Take that cable to a shop and get it properly crimped.
The crimping tool costs about Rs.100  or so.

IMO, hosting anything on servers that are located in the US or any of its
vassal states would be foolish!

Can you tell me if you have an idea as to why is there such a price

Branded cables are a lot more expensive than self crimped ones in
India. Quality is definitely better. The branded ones come in specific
lengths and the cable is factory crimped /moulded and thus will have a
longer life and lower resistance at the connector pins. This is also a
high margin item for the manufacturer as the price is low comapred to
other equipment they make.

I've founded crimping RJ45s to cable cut to desired lengths work just
as well here. Costs a whole lot less as labour is not expensive in
India (as compared to the US). I've not found the premium for branded
cable worth the difference in quality as we can re-crimp here in India
easily.

+1.   However, I would qualify it with "shop that does LAN cabling for
a business."

I have seen really bad workmanship from the so called "professionals"
and when questioned the response "don't take tension"  it will work.

> The crimping tool costs about Rs.100  or so.

We are like that only.   Most of us do not believe in investing in
proper tools.   I have had onsite tech support asking me for phillip
crew driver!

For gui, you can use minicom or gtkterm.

For python, you can check this out.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/676172/full-examples-of-using-pyserial-package

Do ensure that your permissions for the port are set correctly. You can use
the command 'dmesg' to find out the debug messages that are logged while
your computer initializes the external connection. That will contain the
device id (USB-to-serial converters generally appear as /dev/ttyUSB0).

Cheers,
Abraham

Invoke the install shell script/program, use manual partitioning
during install and install on the second hard disk.

I saw the minimum rate of the crimping tool to be greater than 350,  More
over the 30 meter cable is already worn out hence though going with a new
one.

True.

I have often used that Rs.100+ crimper often

I must mention that it requires skill in handling cables and wires
inside it a bit.

I was wary of the original troll disguised as answer from unqualified
and inexperienced electronic "engineers".

Suggestion: buy about 'm' (say 5-10) RJ45 connectors, about 'n' (say
10) meters of cable and crimping tool (Rs.100+) [total outlay ~
150+(m*5)+(n*10) : m and n can be adjusted so that total cost is below
300]

Practice crimping.

Not a very big price to pay for such practical tutorial.

Enjoy!

Message-ID: <CAP6xen=qJdHGHpBbM_EcTkKJRmGosY5+GCRS=MiJsiWUXgtMPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

Please guide me in my Email settings issue/doubt on server.

I have registered my domain from Company A (bought in June, 2013) and my
web space from Company B (bought in July, 2013).

Company A provides me 2 Email Address on their servers ( I used one from it
perfectly on my Ubuntu system with Thunderbird ).

Company B provides me 5 Email Address on their servers ( here,I created one
and set it's settings as mentioned )

and when I configured it on my Thunderbird, my first email got some errors
(might be due to MX records because I have changed the nameservers).

Now is there any way to access my both email addresses ( from Company A and
Company B )?
I know if I want then I have to take the back-up and then export all Emails
to active email server. I want to do this if there is no way out.

Am i right...I can take the backup of all emails via using POP instead of
IMAP?

Please share your experiences.

Thank you so much in advance.

The entire email delivery system depends on the MX records for your
domain and not who is providing the service.  Hopefully you have
configured the MX records in your DNS servers properly.

When you are asking for help, it would be better to give the specifics
of your domain(s).   AFAIK it is in the public (see example below)

<example>

$ host -t mx google.com
google.com mail is handled by 50 alt4.aspmx.l.google.com.
google.com mail is handled by 10 aspmx.l.google.com.
google.com mail is handled by 20 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.
google.com mail is handled by 30 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.
google.com mail is handled by 40 alt3.aspmx.l.google.com.

</example>

Accessing the "delivered emails" is a pop3/imap action and you just
need to define the two in your email client appropriately.

Your question is not clear.

I am assuming you want to transfer (copy) the messages from A to B.
IMAP is the answer - connect to both servers using respective profiles
and copy the folder/messages from A to B.
This may be the only option since you do not have 'root' access to
either A or B server.

Subject: [Ilugc] CSS: making a div to always stay at bottom
Message-ID: <1375103531.8308.17.camel@host0.silentcrooks.org>

Hi,

A beginner question, I need to place a div to always stay at bottom of
the viewport even if there is no other element in the html page.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Test</title>
<style>
#footer {
 position: relative;
 bottom: 0px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div id="footer"> Test Footer </div>
</body>
</html>

In the embedded css, I used "position: relative" which I thought will
accomplish my requirement, but its not working as I expected, If there
is no other element in the page, then this div goes to top.

I can use "position: absolute" or "position: fixed" to make the div stay
at end. But If the page grows, they overlap with other growing elements.

I need to make the #footer div, always stay at bottom, if the page
grows, then it should stay at bottom and it should not overlap with
other growing elements.

how to make it? Need CSS experts guidence. Went through lot of pages
(flex boxes, flux columns, setting height: 100% to <html> tag etc.,)
nothing works.

Thanks,
Mohan R

I think the answer is in your question itself.

I have used a footer div but I use position:relative or fixed.

I have other elements.

You can use % for the height offset.

Subject: [Ilugc] Issues connecting to Internet with BSNL EVDO Modem (Prithvi
	make).
Message-ID: <CAOVWD3v3XQmoNi678tGi=JVaYFHOFKo-0biSU_+=WxcgKJK5EA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am having a BSNL EVDO (Prithvi) modem in Chennai and I am unable to
connect to the Internet. I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 Bit.

The wvdial.conf is as follows,

cat /etc/wvdial.conf

[Dialer Defaults]
Init1 = ATZ
Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
Modem Type = USB Modem
ISDN = 0
New PPPD = yes
Phone = 9183006292
Modem = /dev/ttyACM0
Username = 91********@aaabg.in
Password = 91********
Baud = 460800


I am using GNOMEPPP to detect the device. The phone number was
entered as *99#

I got the following output on the console.

Just in case, there is an excellent software (for english AFAIK) for

Wow!! thank you!! I fixed it. I came across this link and infact, I
tried modifying html's height to 100% as done in this link. But, at that
time, I was trying to set margin-bottom to a wrong div.

This time, it works perfectly and infact, the original css in the above
link is a bit scarry for first-timers like me. But a careful
understanding simplifies my html example like this,

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Test</title>
    <style>
      html, body {
      height: 100%;
      }
      #wrap {
      min-height: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      margin: 0 0 -5%;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="wrap">
    </div>
    <div id="footer">
      <p>Test Footer</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

Thanks,

Assuming the second OS is also a Linux variant.

a) Mount the ISO as a loop device with ISO file system.
b) You will then be able to traverse to the mounted directory and
search for the installer.
c) Invoke it and it will lead you through the installation process.
d) At the point where the program shows hard disk partitioning for
install, opt for the manual method instead of automatic. This will
allow you to create partitions and designate mount points. You must be
aware of how to partition disk, specify filesystem types and mount
points. Generally, it is good to have a partition for the OS mounted
on /, one for your user files mounted on /home and Linux swap.

You will need to try this out. If you are apprehensive of doing it
yourself, maybe you should take the machine to one of the ILUGC
meetings for some one else to help.

On posting of messages:
a) Please trim the mail being quoted to just what is needed like I've done.
b) Please do not post on the top.
c) Many of us will be willing to help if you try something, get stuck,
let us know where you are stuck with error messages etc so that some
one can help you. A plain "Help me" will not get you far.

Hi,

This is to inform that the regular registrations for PyCon India 2013 will
close by *EOD tomorrow*. After this, the ticket cost increases and it
becomes harder to get a seat at the event.

Why take the risk ? Book your tickets today at pyconindia2013.doattend.com !

Looking an application which can read the authentication details
from a conf file and upload the images to all these three sites.

Can anyone do this as a pet project?

I contribute some of my photos to wikimedia commons.

Here is the list of files.
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:ListFiles/Tshrinivasan

It will be nice to see the images as a nice image gallery.
The current method of displaying images uploaded by a user is not so good.

We can get the images and details using the mediawiki api.
We can use "openphoto" to display images as it will take care of all
the display part.

We have to create some code that adds mediawiki as a image source for openphoto.

required skills : PHP, API

Update me if any one is interested to do this project.

This is not good as compared to album view of picasa/facebook.

openphoto gives the same nice album view.

Thats nice.

I will check mediawiki api to get the list of images uploaded by a user
and update here.

You explore the possibilities of adding mediawiki as a imagesource for
openphoto.

Message-ID: <CAP6xen=EQOWiFu_1xLKCODbmernUz4pv1R2Y9ckFK6oV2AXSsg@mail.gmail.com>

If you always wanted an Arduino kit to kickstart those electronics
projects, then it's your GOLDEN chance!

Arduino is a microcontroller board that can used for making computers that
can sense and control more of the physical world than your desktop
computer.

The hardware consists of a simple open source hardware board designed
around an 8-bit Atmel AVR microcontroller, or a 32-bit Atmel ARM. The
software consists of a standard programming language compiler and a boot
loader that executes on the microcontroller. Which means, you can use it to
work on amazing electronics projects.

And you can get it for mere $12, from this Indiegogo campaign!
