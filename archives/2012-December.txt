Hi Kumar,

As list guidelines avoid top posting. I am using http://
www.buildyourvps.com/ and they are very customizable options and hence 
their pricing seems attractive to me. I choose VPS and hence chose the 
above. If your need is not vps then the above is not usefull for you. 
There are many more hosting providers. I have never faced down time 
problem with this host. They say fair share cpu. So if you doing a cpu 
intensive application then VPS may not be a good option. From my 
experince tocici is good host. From what i read, they have been doing 
hosting business for long long time. Like from 90's (1995 to be exact). 
At the end it is all what your needs are and host best the offering fits 
your needs. For me tocici is good, but i am still exploring , so if 
people of ilugc know better VPS providers please suggest.

with regards,
ashwin

It is great that you are trying to get into the Linux world.

There are basically two types of installs that people do in any PC. Single
boot and Multiboot.

Single Boooting involves using only one OS, like Windows only or Linux only.
Multibooting involves using two operating systems like Windows and Linux or
Two Linux systems in the same computer and choosing the operating system
when powering on the computer.

Choose your way first, do you want a Linux only or a Linux+Windows
combination. Then

use *Google* for that type of installation. There are a lot of tutorials
and help available online.

Thank you.

   CFEngine is a popular open source configuration management
system, written by Mark Burgess. Its primary function is to provide
automated configuration and maintenance of large-scale computer systems,
including the unified management of servers, desktops, embedded networked
devices, mobile smartphones, and tablet computers.

   Cfengine, or the configuration engine is an agent/software robot
and a very high level language for building expert systems to administrate
and configure large computer networks. Cfengine uses the idea of classes
and a primitive form of intelligence to define and automate the
configuration
and maintenance of system state, for small to huge configurations. Cfengine
is designed to be a part of a computer immune system.

Some features:
      ? System monitoring extensions, which extend the monitoring
capabilities of CFEngine 3
        community to allow for defining custom monitors for any type of
information.
      ? Support for manipulating virtual machines on Xen, VMware ESX, and
KVM.
      ? Native Windows support
      ? Flexible searching of reports in a brand new scalable interface
that supports thousands
        of hosts on a single hub.
      ? Mapping into a Graphical User Interface - for fancy commercial
upgrade paths.
      ? Role Based Access Control
      ? Support for Mission-Critical High Availability through a fully
redundant, lightweight
        architecture for system information updating

Overall nice app but if the thief is formatting the hard drive, it cannot
be traced.

The answer given by them is that you enable BIOS password so that the thief
cannot format.

Not convincing as BIOS passwords can also be broken.

But at least this gives a small defence against theft.

The above will only give you a snapshot every 2 seconds (default) and
the cpu cycles and memory needed by du.

rsync does a better job of showing real time progress:

$ rsync --progress --archive <src_file/dir>  <dest_file/dir>

rsync can be used for "local" copy as well.
--progress shows % of the progress as well as time elapsed for each file.
--archive (see man page) but more importantly if target file exists
then it does *nothing* whereas cp will overwrite the file unless you
use the -n option.

After the job is over you also get a summary:

$ rsync --progress --archive debian-wheezy-DI-b3-amd64-kde-CD-1.iso cp.iso
sending incremental file list
debian-wheezy-DI-b3-amd64-kde-CD-1.iso

There is no way other way. In laptops resetting BIOS password is little
difficult when compared to desktops. The only solution you have is to make
sure your laptop is not stolen at any cost. If you can make sure that then
there is no need of such a software at all.

It is not possible to do anti-theft without any limitation.

Message-ID: <CABko9NJWZxhYrSrOyt-DhZXTzyazv9RbsRV5d2tGs0Y89KiM4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a completely untrusted remote (sand)box (stranger has root on it).
I'd like to "trigger" running a program on that box and like to get the
triggered program's output from that box. My problem is in trusting the
output of this program since it (or the layers above/below it) could have
been tampered with by the said root user. How can I trust something coming
from an untrusted box?

Context:

The stranger will be challenged to solve a problem on the box (say, apache
fails to start, we'd like the stranger to fix it). To measure whether the
stranger has solved the problem, I'd like to run something on the box (ex:
ps -ef | grep apache) to validate if the end state has been achieved.
However, such a naive 'ps' test can easily be cheated using a rootkit or
possibly using other simpler means of reverse engineering / cheating.

My current approach is to only extract part of the needed information from
the box and do the validation from outside (ex: by comparing against a
reference / control / ideal solution). But not all challenges will fit into
this scheme (the example outlined above cannot be done this way since we'd
like to actually see if such a process is running, however, for instance, I
can certainly challenge a person to write a fibonacci series generating
program on the machine and be able to confidently validate that program's
output from this machine. In this case, the "truth" being validated is
universal, whereas systems specific truth (such as whether mysqld has been
configured correctly or not) can be found out only by probing the machine).

Any solution that involves cryptography / signing / etc., or anything else
that is out of the box will be helpful.

Any tips / ideas?

Regards,

What is there to mistake? Entrepreneurship creates wealth and funnels
jobs. What is wrong in that? There is only anything good with that.

But one should be ethical,moral and bold in business and survive for
more than 5 years.

It will not take months.

You need to pick up certain ideas like hosting, domain, web space etc.
Cloud blah blah.

You can get your website up and running with an Amazon instance if you prefer.

They have a trial run for a year.

But it may be be better to go for a hosting at around 20$ a month.

And web development for your online store is not easy.

You have to model your site after flipkart.com(Google or ask friends)
and you will succeed.

Be ready to spend around 60k INR to pay a good web developer and you
are ready to go.

Time taken to develop perhaps 1 month. Not sure.

It depends how many items you have to sell.

But I have not done all this. Only giving you a rough idea to plan
your expenses and timeline.

Hope this helps.

May God bless you with success.

First of all give a *meaningful* subject line.  In this mailing list,
we are all open source enthusiasts and a some members are experts in
their subjects but this fact does not belong in the subject line.

Your subject line should *focus* on what is the problem that you are
trying to solve of the information that you want to know.

Coming to your query and your experience as stated in your OP :-

Please start here <http://bit.ly/SDCqVA>.   Do read through a few of
the links that come up in the search result.
You will begin to get an idea as to what are the ingredients that you
need to have.

At this stage, I would suggest you get your hands dirty with the
basics, then put up a product gallery.  As you gain more knowledge
delve into e-commerce.

Subject: [Ilugc] make
Message-ID: <CALDskywSJ_qz3kqebib9fOavttJuTPytJOQXySBF2LWVWKUtqw@mail.gmail.com>

You make a living.

Or you have to make a living if you are still a student.

To make a program executable we "make" it.

What is that?

make is a program that invokes the makefile in the current directory
which usually
 invokes makefiles in certain subdirectories within it.

Within a directory there could be C source files and header files,
there could be some other
 action performed, you could be compiling C++ or Java. All compiled
languages require makefiles.

And you can also perform arbitrary actions like building a port in
FreeBSD or OpenBSD using make.

This involves download from one of the mirrors, integrity check,
untar, configure, make, check
whether the package conflicts, then add package.

Usually we only want to "build" our program to convert the source into target.

So you should know what people mean when they say a certain build is
having bugs.

Or if they say can you give a new build? You should know how to do it.
You create a new build with make.

And builds are usually checked in into CVS or SVN or some version
control system. That always only stores
 source files and you are supposed to check out the source and create a build.

The build is always an executable, it could be an appliance or an ISO
in my case. It is something that is usable in
 binary form.

There is a desirable one to one correspondence between build and the
version in version control repository.

But this is a human thing and not very easy to enforce.

We will look at make and makefiles in detail a little later.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] online shopping the future
Message-ID: <CALDskyxc7Y--HvXfCagiY8jw9rfciODLng0MYfPa_1YvsUaqZQ@mail.gmail.com>

This article is about online shopping and it may or may not belong to LUG.

If I can talk about irctc here obviously this also belongs here. I
still marked it OT.

I mostly talk about entrepreneurship, business sense and technology.

This article has a bit of all that.

Basically I feel in the gut that just like ATMs and online banking and
online ticket reservation has
completely changed our lives in the way we do banking and ticketing I
am quite certain shopping
 also will become completely online.

Even now we have to go to the bank to deposit a cheque or to drop cash
and to access the locker.

And ticketing is something both airline and railway that does not
require any physical interaction.

I believe shopping will never be an online only thing. But at the same
time a lot of articles nearly
 every electronic good and more importantly computer peripherals,
components and accessories
 can be purchased online without any issue.

We can't buy fruit juice online since flipkart cannot deliver it on time.

I am going to talk about flipkart. Not only that I will also explain
my situation.

I live in Nellai, the place I was born and here you cannot even get
Modern bread. There is a lot of
 local manufacturing here and it is not backward at all but I prefer
not to buy computer spare parts here.

So what do I do?

I purchased lot of things in flipkart. And what are the benefits I found?

Let me list them:

1) I can read the reviews of others before buying. Just like Amazon
books or like any other thing that
 we Google. Is it going to help if I buy a green net for my garden ?

2) We can purchase something based on the budget and you can sort the
query results with lowest price first

3) You can view the snap and feature list calmly at home without the
hustle of a shop

4) Payment methods of flipkart are cool. They have an eWallet
feature.I initially recharged using SBI, then
 ICICI and now my RBS credit card. And I pay my credit card bill using
online banking

So you can see that everything is eased and made friendly and useful.

How do these companies make money? How do they give attractive prices?

They save on real estate. You need not stock inventory in an expensive
locality. They can sell even on a Sunday night.

No need to manage personnel to handle customers.

You can logon to flipkart with your gmail or facebook ID. And payment
gateways are there to talk to banks.

Overall it is just like being able to transfer cash in the dead of the
night when no bank is open, you can buy a
 digital camera for 3k if you want an impulsive purchase in the middle
of a dream at night. ;)

flipkart founders are ex Amazon.  It's operation is based on the
Amazon model from product info / order / feedback / delivery.

It's USP IMO, is the C.O.D payment methos.  Again a very old concept
but relevant to the India context where a lot of fellow netizens may
not have credit/debit cards or are afraid of online fraud.

All other online (India base) are following a similar model pretty much.

This question is because they don't have any CD/DVD ROM in the Government
Laptop.

1. We have to connect some external DVD ROM and install the Ubuntu.
2. We have to create a bootable USB pendrive for Ubuntu

Thanks.  This information would have been helpful if the OP had
mentioned it in the first place.

Please trim your quotation.

Item 2. should be fairly easy using Windows version of unetbootin.

Hi guys,

We - from ILUG-Dharmapuri, are conducting our first operation in outdoor -
a Linux Practicum. Following are the details about this.

Message-ID: <CALV9omYM-JMfm-VLgB727+vcQzC1j4MycoOac+HC4-zF6yPVkA@mail.gmail.com>

Tool of the Day: ntop

     ntop is a network probe that shows network usage in a way
similar to what top does forprocesses. In interactive mode, it
displays the network status on the user's terminal. In Web mode,
it acts as a web server, creating a HTML dump of the network status.
It sports a NetFlow/sFlow emitter/collector, a HTTP-based client interface
for creating ntop-centric monitoring applications, and RRD for persistently
storing traffic statistics.

Features:

? Sort network traffic according to many protocols
? Show network traffic sorted according to various criteria
? Display traffic statistics
? Store on disk persistent traffic statistics in RRD format
? Identify the indentity (e.g. email address) of computer users
? Passively (i.e. without sending probe packets) identify the host OS
? Show IP traffic distribution among the various protocols
? Analyse IP traffic and sort it according to the source/destination
? Display IP Traffic Subnet matrix (who?s talking to who?)
? Report IP protocol usage sorted by protocol type
? Act as a NetFlow/sFlowcollector for flows generated by routers
 (e.g. Cisco and Juniper) or switches (e.g. Foundry Networks)
? Produce RMON-like network traffic statistics
? Traffic statistics are saved into RRD databases for long-run traffic
analysis.

While most of things you said are true, I find localized buying a bit
cheaper in certain parts like Chennai. Of course, it will not be the case
in Nellai, but with a bit of research, you could save a lot of money. For
example, I wanted to buy a HP 21 Ink catridge, which was somewhere around
900+ in flipkart, but found it to be 400+ in Richie Street. May be it
involves talking about legitimacy of goods. This is just my observation.

Subject: [Ilugc] Hardware and Software Bloat in Tablet Computers
Message-ID: <CACbtZwSFbHPLwYOHE3NVQ5gj00PS5CPCK8OJf9ZiSxYaHU6EMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Tablets are the latest consumer computing devices. It requires no
introduction. What I want to discuss is their hardware requirements, mainly
their CPU/GPU power and their RAM and the software that use them.

About 6 years ago (6 decades for technology, may be), a computer with a
2Ghz Pentium 4 processor,  256 MB RAM, No Graphics Card could do a lot of
things, as far as  I remember.

Now if you please go through this opinion report
http://m.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/this-tablet-is-not-a-mood-elevator/article4161092.ece/?secid=3010

The gist is tablet with 512MB RAM is less memory and that troubles me.

Most tablets have a separate processor for computing and graphics rendering
(CPU&GPU) and have memory somewhere north at 1/2GB in most cases. This
clearly indicate software bloats.

With all that said, I will ask somethings that is floating in the mind:

1. What part of the software drives the hardware requirements so high to
the tune that 2X RAM than I had for PC is considered insufficient and most
devices have 4X or even 8X?
2. If tablets are meant to be portable and lightweight, in terms of
hardware, how come they become heavy weight in terms of software?
3. Have the programmers messed up somewhere and have bloated things beyond
control and there is no going back?

In the meantime, you might try to read this

install yourself. If you have got a friend's computer, the Ubuntu CD or ISO

Dear Friends

The recent action against a boy for allegedly posting comments against
a leader on Facebook is an indicator that despite massive public opinion
against restriction of speech online, suppression of freedom of
expression continues. Free Software Foundation Tamil Nadu calls on all
supporters of a free internet to gather in human chain at *4 PM at Besant
Nagar Beach on December 4, 2012 (Today)* against the various flaws in the
Information Technology Act, especially Section 66 A.

>From the action against Professor Ambikesh Mahapatra to that against
cartoonist Aseem Trivedi and Ravi Srinivasan in Puducherry, the Air India
crew members and Shaheen Dhada and Rinu Srinivasan in Mumbai, the use of
the IT Act is serving as an obstacle to free expression of ideas. The lack
of clarity in the rules due to the use of vague terminology is one of the
major reasons for this situation. FSFTN and demands that the rules be
clarified and loopholes be closed so that the IT Act cannot be used to
settle personal vendetta or enforce one's ideas on others.

There has been successful protests in Bangalore and Hyderabad last sunday,
lets show the people in power we from Chennai too want the change. There is
nothing like joining hands in this wonderful climate against the flawed IT
Act. Join us today at 4pm in Besant Nagar Beach.

FSFTN and Chennaites for Internet Democracy invites all those who are keen
to protect our rights in the internet to join hands. Let us raise our
voices in unison against the flawed IT Act.

Subject: ITU Meets in Dubai this week to discuss Internet Governance
To: prasmailme at gmail.com


       The International Telecommunications Union convenes today in Dubai
to discuss among other topics Internet governance. The ITU is part of the
UN now and consists of representatives from governments around the world.
We've expressed our concerns about this process in two recent Mozilla blog
posts portions of which are included below:

"...we question the very assumption that a "binding global treaty," enacted
by member states alone, will be beneficial for the Internet or for global
society. The Internet needed no treaty to come into existence, to expand,
to flourish, and to transform global society. The Internet needed no
convocation of governments to facilitate the professed aims of the new
treaty. There is no reason to believe that a treaty will fill any current
need or cure any current defect.


To the contrary, there are reasons to believe that such a treaty, instead,
would be detrimental. Key aspectsappear to point to increases in government
control beyond the existing rule of law. Technology does not blossom by
government control.  Put simply, governments do not know best how to design
the future. Moreover, there are legitimate concerns that some governments
most interested in a new treaty may aim to limit free expression and
personal freedoms, to control political activities, and to violate the
security of their own citizens. Oddly, in the name of harmonization and
interoperability, some of the very attributes of the open Internet that we
value the most - open access, unrestricted connectivity and sharing,
content neutrality, and user choice - could be compromised."  Read

Geoffrey MacDougall and Tim Hwang on Mark Surman's team have been leading
the campaign from our end and created Mozilla - ITU, including web tools
<http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/ITU/> to help people express their voices. A
few contributors with domain expertise like Andrew Bridges have also helped
out a lot.

There's a broader Internet campaign arising in opposition to the ITU
effort. You can see some of it on Twitter #ITU or #freeopen among others.

Culprit #1: Virtual machines and interpreters (Dalvik VM, Java, 
HTML5/JavaScript engines, etc...).

In good old days (and I remember 8086 based IBM PCs to 80386 based 
PC-AT machines), men were men and wrote programs directly in 
in assembly language for most needs. Programs are small, succinct, 
fast and very efficient. Then, later when the newer generation 
programmers took over (in the early 90s), they moved over to compiled 
languages like C and Pascal. The mid-90s witnessed the rise of
so-called RAD tools (Visual Basic, PowerBuilder, Delphi) which demanded
more hardware power to get their jobs done. 

By late 90s, everybody were talking, drinking, eating  OOPs, virtual 
machines, XML and so on - all of which claim to make programmer's 
lives "simpler" at the expense of huge processing power and memory.
 
Year 2000 and beyond, we are moving towards web services, distributed
architectures, cloud computing - all of which ultimately demand tall
layers of framework overhead. Coupled with them, we are looking at 
"refined" UI and human-computer interface (multi-touch gestures, 
voice-recognition, face-recognition and what-not) - which again hikes up
the processing and memory requirement.

Culprit #2: People are "trying" hard to become lazier. They want to learn
less and make the computing devices adapt to them. But unfortunately, 
I doubt it if this is working at all. 
  
>  2. If tablets are meant to be portable and lightweight, in terms of

Most tablets are fundamentally flawed by their design/architecture and
choice of OS/software stack.

>  3. Have the programmers messed up somewhere and have bloated things beyond
>  control and there is no going back?

Yes. Read Java, .NET, and layers of frameworks on top of them. If the
entire user-space stack were completely and carefully developed in C/C++,
a tablet with a modern specification would feel like a super-computer our hands.
This whole baggage of web stuff (HTML5, Javascript, CSS, XML, JSON) are
slowing things down due to layers of abstractions to make designers/programmer's
lives easier.

But the bigger problem is, we lack smart programmers - they take at-least a 
decade (or a couple of hundred-thousand useful SLOCs ) to form. And they 
are expensive. The world is willing to live with many not-so-smart 
programmers/developers guided by a sophisticated programming/development 
framework to safeguard them from their own mistakes. This is all part of the 
software-hardware-business-and-programmer-job economics :-)

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

Tool of the Day: Packit - Packet analysis and injection tool

Packit is a network auditing tool. It's value is derived from
its ability to customize, inject, monitor, and manipulate IP traffic.
By allowing you to define (spoof) all TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP, ARP,
RARP and Ethernet header options, Packit can be useful in
testing firewalls, intrusion detection systems, port scanning,
simulating network traffic and general TCP/IP auditing.
Packit is also an excellent tool for learning TCP/IP

Subject: [Ilugc] some makefile syntax and rules
Message-ID: <CALDskyy3gZZZrqR26X5pysDSMmZwpv+a5-Q+DRVZkf1i3A_pkg@mail.gmail.com>

makefiles contain one of two things in the rule execution/body part.

Either the body is some makefile directive or command or it is a shell
script. But a rule
 body has to be one line.

So you normally find plenty of "\" characters in makefiles. So there
are two kinds of loopings
 and conditions. Makefile's own syntax and the shell syntax.

A makefile is composed of mainly three parts in its core.

The target, which is the object/entity you want to create or make.

Then the dependencies, which means the source for the creation of target.

And then the body part defines the way in which the source can be
cooked to make the target.

An example is here:

$ cat makefile

foo: foo.c foo.h
          gcc $@ -o $<

This will create the target from the dependencies. The target is the
first keyword followed by a
 colon and then the dependencies, in this case the source files foo.c and foo.h

You have plenty of builtin variables in makefiles. $(CC), $(LDFLAGS) and so on.

You can add to them or overwrite them with,

LDFLAGS += -lutil

or

LDFLAGS = -lm

More later.

Subject: [Ilugc] Make and compiled languages
Message-ID: <CALDskyw4-zM8VPUV3VAB5s34eVm4FTTqdDH+QxMNNkSX_KpgVA@mail.gmail.com>

Makefiles are useful only with compiled programming languages.

But makefiles in general are employed even when there is no
programming involved at all.;)

Other than of course makefile scripting. If you care to call that
programming at all.

As I said before make is used to download, extract, create a package
and install ports/packages in the
BSD world.

It is actually BSD make which is different from GNU make just like
even ls is different.

Now for  a language like javascript which is pure interpreted make is
not useful.

make is used for perl although perl is an interpreted language.

Ever heard of perl -c ? Perl also has a compilation stage.

But my guess is that makefiles are useful in perl CPAN module
compilation due to Perl XS which uses C
 bindings.

makefiles are used to just compile first,then link and so on.

It recursively descends down directories and compiles a whole project.

But a usual project is a mix of several programming languages and
several components.

One top level make may invoke several things in between.

To: Wikimedia India Community list <wikimediaindia-l at lists.wikimedia.org>


Dear all,

It is immense pleasure for me and Naveen to announce that India has
won officially at the photo-contest Wiki Loves Monuments
internationally. Two of the photos from India among 3,60,000+ have
made it to the top-10.



1. Tomb of Safdarjung from Delhi has received from the highest ranking
by the international jury, as the image wins first prize globally. The
photo plays with the light and gives a wonderful contrast between the
darkness of the room and the lighted tomb, giving it a dramatic
effect. The photographer is Pranav Singh, from Delhi.

Safdarjung's Tomb, a garden tomb with a marble mausoleum in New Delhi,
India. It was built in 1754 in the late Mughal Empire style, and was
described as "the last flicker in the lamp of Mughal architecture".

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tomb_of_Safdarjung,_New_Delhi.jpg

Comments from Jury: The strong light contrast between the lighted tomb
and the darkness of the room emphasizes the monument, and gives it a
dramatic component. The tomb is sharp and detailed, and free of visual
distractions; with gravity and a perfect sense for the angle of view
and light this picture presents the object - the architecture and
light forming a stage for the tomb, focusing on the details of the
stone carving. All in all a nicely framed and executed picture that
seems to speak of the significance of this tomb.



2. The Taj Mahal is no where lying behind. The winning photo from
India ranks 6th internationally. The photographer is Narender Kumar,
again from Delhi.

The Taj Mahal, is a mausoleum located in Agra, India, that was built
under Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife, Mumtaz
Mahal. It is one of the most famous Indian buildings and considered a
symbol for love world wide.

Comments from Jury: The Taj Mahal is probably one of the most
photographed monuments in the world - and definitely in this
competition. This particular image gives an impressive view of the
silhouette, showing also the adjoining buildings. The complex seems to
wake up, out of the mist. It gives context and mystery at the same
time showing just a bit more than on most pictures.

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rear_side_of_Tajmahal.jpg

It's happy moment for the Indian community. Congratulations to all
winners. Thanks to the entire Indian community and to the Wikimedia
India Chapter for constant cooperation.

Hi
We (The Mojolab Foundation) are looking for contract-able geeks of a hippie
inclination who are willing to travel to places where goodwill abounds but
plumbing may be scarce, in order to set up networks and content hubs that
will help build bridges across the digital divide and enable people who
have never been heard to voice their concerns alongside the rest of us.
Areas we will be working in in 2013 are citizen band radio, wireless mesh
networks and tools to manage content and track events across a distributed
network to enable democratic communication.
If that's something that sounds fascinating to you, please write to me at
arjun-at-mojolab.org.

We're a small organization where everyone wears many hats, so if you're

You have made some interesting points. Nice thoughts.
But I keep thinking weather the entire `bloat` is a cause or effect of the
points you had mentioned?

Message-ID: <CAFHFDAmykWJp1nDmnhYwporLwVFb6ip4YagTz36BAr_aD0Bu6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have a server with 4 nic card,  I installed Debian wheezy/sid on it.
After installation I rebooted the machine only to find that the eth0 has
become eth5 ?

This is the closest thing I came up with google
https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=24383 "This is a Linux
*feature* that when ever you change the MAC address it ups the eth*"

The trouble is I did not pull out the nic card on this server and replace
the nic after installation for me to face this problem.

However, the posted rules file indicates you are using multi port
ethernet cards (mac addresses are in sequence).

Also eth0 mac address != eth5 mac address.

Please state your problem clearly.  What you kind of hardware you are
dealing with, what are you doing with that hardware.

Brute force solution - empty the persistent net rules file and reboot.
  udev will recreate the entries in the file and assign device eth*
names in the order it sees them.  Edit the file to your liking i.e.
which NIC (aka mac address) you want to assign to respective eth*
names.

dig has nothing to do with hosts. It uses bind and internet servers for DNS.

hosts is the file lookup method in /etc/resolv.conf. This has nothing
to do with BIND
 or dig.

$ dig @8.8.8.8 <somesite.com>

man dig

Trendwise, what Chandrasekhar says is true. I would say bloat is the
effect and the cause is dropping hardware prices.

Cheaper hardware make the need for programmers to write efficient
software less - code cruft. This is a sort of unconscious "hand in
glove" phenomenon where hardware guys pump up power, software guys
consume it and say "give me more".

This is a good example of a variant of Parkinson's law in play along
with Wirth's/Gates'/Page's law.

Very true. Though, there has been some "stop,
 introspect and optimize" phase lately by some
hardware and software vendors lately. The
resurgence of C++ in user-land for development
for some of the modern smartphone / tablet
platforms (Windows 8, Blackberry OS 10) are a
proof.

One of the primary reasons for Apple's iOS
performing well on a very moderate hardware
specs when compared to most competing hardware
that run Android is - most of their user-land
middleware stack/framework are developed on
Objective-C which is a very light-weight OO language
without overhead of VM, bytecode compile-interpret
phase, and so on.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

OpenStack is a collection of open source software projects that
enterprises/service providers can use to setup and run their cloud
compute and storage infrastructure.

More corporates and communities are contributing to openstack.

Found a easy book to start with openstack.

In my personal opinion, I think that is the difference between a hardware
company (Apple) driven OS/Middleware development and a software company
(Google) driven OS/Middleware development. Apple knew exactly what hardware
their OS was going to run on and they optimized it awesomely. Including
taking rather risky business decisions like no multitasking, no flash etc.
The result is a brilliant device called the iPhone. As you mentioned,
without the overhead  of the VM, bytecode interpreter and without  multi
tasking, flash support, they needed lower processing power and that
directly gave great battery performance too, which is a very important part
of a smart phone. Google on the other hand ironically by making Android
free, allowed the OS stack to be installed on cheap, low power processor
driven Chinese phones and got a bad name. Poor OS response and very bad
battery performance.

Its not about Google is doing things wrongly. Is there any benchmark
showing that Dalvik VM is the cause for the trouble? And Apple does not
produce their own hardware they just buy from some one and force them to
make things their way. iPhone app store has very stringent requirements. As
they already had a fan base (many of them blindly thinking whatever Apple
makes is great) they are able to get more money and more developers to work
on. If America is taken out of the equation (many blind believers of apple
are there) then Apple will go in dust. Even in tablets the CPU usage is
just 10 to 15% which means rest of it is just idle. Software should be able
to utilise the available power before asking for more power - it can use
Dalvik VM or other things. No offense intended.

Everything is resolved by  the NS records for your domain.
Have you *changed*  the NS records for your domain within the last
couple of days?   The NS changes take a few hours to propagate.

What is the problem here?  Isn't this what you want it to be?

The sites must be using an old cache. IMO you should pose the question to them.

Great - many a times the problem is the hosts file.

Has anyone gone beyond  IaaS (e.g. openstack) to a PaaS (e.g.
openshift or cloudfoundry)?

ah interesting and should be possible IaaS provides all the components and
we should be having a PasS running over it . personally i would not  want
to get into this business  as initial capital requirements would be  high .
Technologically would hack if someone puts in the money.

OpenShift  components can run on top of OpenStack.
<http://www.krishnaraman.net/openshift-origin-on-openstack/>

<http://www.krishnaraman.net/openshift-origin-on-openstack/>

OpenShift Origin on
OpenStack<http://www.krishnaraman.net/openshift-origin-on-openstack/>which
describes step by step how to set it up.

In addition to OpenShift  being able to run on top of OpenStack, it can run
on top of AWS, it can run on top of KVM <http://www.linux-kvm.org/> or
VMware in your own data center, it can run on top of Virtual
Box<http://virtualbox.org>in your personal laptop, and it can even run
on top of ?bare metal?
unvirtualized Linux hosts.

They are complementary projects that work well together. OpenShift Origin
is not presently part of OpenStack.

Subject: [Ilugc] Yakuake new tab fails to open the current working directory
Message-ID: <50C06010.2020400@gmail.com>

Hi,

I recently found about Yakuake and found it nice. But I have run into 
some trouble.
I was using gnome-terminal before and in that, new tab opens a new tab 
in the
previously working directory. But Yakuake even after setting up 
preferences correctly
fails to do so. I searched the web for a solution and found this:
https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214547
In comment 2, a solution is suggested, where, they point out that 
/proc/PID_for_yakuake/cwd
stores the present working directory. But in my case, the link 
/proc/PID_for_yakuake/cwd
doesn't change. It always points to my home folder and my new tabs always
open with their present working directory as the home folder.

I even tried making a new 'cdd' in which I forcefully change the link to 
the
directory I am going to and then do cd to it. But the command
ln -sfn my_new_pwd /proc/PID_for_yakuake/cwd
throws up permission error even when I 'sudo' it. Help? Is there some 
kind of lock on it?
Currently, the permissions for /proc/PID_for_yakuake/cwd reads 777.

Further down in the webpage, I see that a patch has been submitted. How 
do I use a
patch in an existing installation?

Thanks in advance,

Thanks for all of the above links.   It is very informative and I have
known about a few.

Openshift on LKVM is something I learnt new from your post and
definitely worth investingation

My query was not on whether openshift PaaS can be done or not and on
which platforms.

I was interested in knowing if anyone in this list has actually
implemented a PaaS based on the opensource components; be it as an
eval or a production roll out.

Have you done a PaaS with openshift on any of the platforms listed above?

Thanks,

Now the LiveUSB OpenBSD project that I have been running in
sourceforge for more than 4 years now has become
 mature and its cousin LiveCD OpenBSD has become a real LiveCD.

http://livecd-openbsd.sf.net

and

http://liveusb-openbsd.sf.net

I am sure you can easily get going with OpenBSD if you try the LiveCD.

Tool of the Day: Ganglia

    Ganglia is a scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance
computing systems such as clusters and Grids. It is based on a
hierarchical design targeted at federations of clusters. It leverages widely
used technologies such as XML for data representation, XDR for compact,
portable data transport, and RRDtool for data storage and visualization. It
uses carefully engineered data structures and algorithms to achieve very
low per-node overheads and high concurrency.

Do you need a benchmark to "prove" that a program running on a VM 
requires more CPU power and memory than native code ? Its like 
asking for a benchmark to prove that a tanker is slower than 
a truck!

> And Apple does not produce their own hardware they just buy 
> from some one and force them to make things their way. 

Wrong! Apple "design" their own hardware and software. They design 
everything from the low-level architecture and at times processor 
instruction-sets all the way to the polished interface and the 
hardware shell. They get chinese and taiwanese companies to 
mass-manufacture their design. Every big hardware vendor does 
the same (Samsung/Lenovo/Intel). Thats called cost economics to 
survive the market. 

And yes, Apple (or rather Steve Jobs and his team) are all about 
perfection and they cant take things any other way - I mean 
zero-compromise. Thats why, their suppliers are "forced" to make 
things their way. That's why a chinese manufacturer's product looks 
sturdy and professional when it comes from Apple, while the same 
manufacturer builds a flimsy product for others ;-) 

> iPhone app store has very stringent requirements. 

The stringent requirements on iPhone app store has come a long way 
to make applications mature and application developers more 
responsible. Android Playstore in contrast is chaotic filled in 
immature applications and spamware/malware. 

For an "end-user", Playstore only has numbers. But count the number
of mature and stable applications, and they are very few. 
You just cant trust an application on Playstore without looking 
at the ratings and reviews - and I've seen very bad/malicious
applications on Playstore with hiked up ratings.

BTW, you don't complain about stringent requirements from the Linux
kernel development community to get your patch into an official 
Linux kernel, do you ? ;-)

> As they already had a fan base (many of them blindly thinking 
> whatever Apple makes is great) 

Wrong again! If people buy Apple products '"blindly" thinking 
that whatever Apple makes is great', then why did 3 out of every 5 
apple products fail miserably in the market ? Apple has more failed
products than successful ones. People only go for products that are
practical and makes their lives easier. It doesn't matter which 
company that product comes from.

Its a common misconception that people "blindly" go for Apple 
products. In reality, mature audiences who prefer perfection have
bought Apple products. Successful products from Apple (or any company
for that matter) have sincere efforts in making them suitable for 
perfectionists. Of course, ignorant people would go for any "name" 
brand - be it Apple or Samsung or Blackberry or even Microsoft.
They care about of the "brand" factor than the actual novelty.

> they are able to get more money and more developers to work on. 

The last time I checked, Linux developers are the most highly paid
and are in high demand. Apple is not a comparison for them.

There are significant numbers of iPhone and iPad users living in India
right now! Every wondered why iPhones get sold out faster in India
when they are introduced, or why some greedy sellers sell "imported"
iPhones at more than a lac few weeks before their India-Launch ?

Keeping the CPU running at more than 50% does impact battery usage - 
which in turn results in higher overall power consumption and 
increases carbon foot-print. It is a critical requirement for modern 
smartphones and tablets to optimize battery usage without sacrificing 
significant user experience features. 

Nobody wants to rush to a wall outlet in midst of watching a movie, 
reading a book or even surfing the Internet. A tablet with less than 
7 hours of battery life or a smartphone with less than 16 hours of 
battery life is definitely not acceptable.

Very true. We need hardware companies that build on Linux and to 
focus on a similar feat. But I'm afraid that it takes a lot of 
stubborn-ness and arrogance with a perfectionist attitude to come up
with something comparable to Apple.

While the core Linux kernel developers work with such an attitude (that
resulted in the most successful, optimized and feature-rich OS kernel), 
the same attitude is somewhat lacking amongst hardware vendors and 
integrators that incorporate Linux into their product-lines.

I do sense a trail of stubborn-ness by folks at Canonical and the 
Ubuntu community in general in not compromising to anything thats 
below their expectations - which in turn did result in a very high 
quality product (Ubuntu family of distributions).

Making Android "free" was a good move. This allowed more hardware
vendors to incorporate them into their products and helped them 
build a more open eco-system. But I guess, they should get rid of
VM cruft and come up with a completely full-stack user-land build 
optimized for native performance and provide more thorough API stack
for writing native applications with rich content and UI elements.

Message-ID: <CALDskywgXq2KFUqWU=KTpB+NpM0+5UsTEpf_qPfygVt_Zx=7JQ@mail.gmail.com>

syslog is a tool/daemon/service/method to do logging in the UNIX duniya.

syslog is not a piece of code or a daemon. It is also that.

It is actually a concept, a method by which you can log endlessly and
you can view
historical data.

You have the ability to send syslog data to other hosts in the LAN
using UDP, you can
 actually execute a trigger using syslog with some pattern. You can
log to multiple files and
 so on.

syslog has various facilities and priorities.
local0..local7,user,daemon etc. are facilities. Priorities are
 info,emerg,crit etc.

In fact if you log to crit a wall message will be sent to all users.

Syslog is an extremely flexible logging subsystem in the UNIX
repertoire that has evolved very well
 with the times.

There is a syslog-ng and also newsyslog. You can rotate logs and
define criteria for them. And old logs are
 compressed. You grep through them using zgrep.

There is a tool called logger which can write to syslog. And it is
also a daemon that listens on a local socket.

Nice adds on to these are report aggregation and presentation tools.
Splunk started out as one and has travelled much further to be pretty
extensive in event correlation etc.

Lire is a nice open source tool. I'm quite optimistic that there must
be more tools that do graphing across time using RRDTool and the like.
Have not ventured into this in the last few years and hence am pretty
rusty.

Networking gear be it managed switches, routers, firewalls, modems,
mail servers and ...
it is a really long gear.

Any box that sits on the network. NAS box, VPN, ISP link aggregator or
any device associated with networking
 all belong to the same category of design.

They all have flash inside(except NAS), or they could be a virtualized
appliance like VMWare VM ; in fact you don't
 move routers and VPN boxes and firewalls to the cloud. It is impossible.

You could have a firewall on the cloud yes, but I am not sure how that
will evolve.

It is not alike the firewalls we see today.

So whatever it is, ultimately OS boots off a flash or EEPROM or some
such thing(no moving parts, CPU fan or anything),
 and is an embedded device.

The OS is typically Linux or NetBSD or FreeBSD. In rare cases some other.

Then the device has to be managed.

How?

You have to provide a web interface.

The moment you talk about web interface then there is javascript, CSS,
DOM, Apache or nginx and several other concepts.

All networking gear talk through the web interface in which
configuration and management and monitoring happen thro' the
 single point of access; the web interface.

But some devices also have a CLI which I doubt is very much used.

In order to run a tiny web server inside the appliance which is what
all these gear do one needs to run a server like Apache
 or nginx. Or some other.

And you also require CGI ability or else it would be useless. Embedded
databases like SQLite also get used.

Thank God, you don't have the complexity of today's web browser or
having to run graphics.

A web server can be run without any graphics or rendering inside the
appliance since all this is handled by the browser.

The way to make the device answer the user commands entered thro' the
web interface is using CGI and some server or daemon
 process running inside each appliance.

Although on the surface they all are very different inside they need
to have the same set of features that I discussed above
 in order to cater to their core function.

The main activity is very different, but all of them have a web
interface, have the OS burnt into some form of solid state storage.

And they all offer some form of device monitoring, SNMP support,
graphs and logs.

This is not the case as the high end Switches from Cisco, Foundry and
others - all the Network administrators will be heavily using CLI and for
Cisco sometime back they used to charge money for enabling the CLI meaning
they used to ship by default with GUI and they knew very well that CLI is
preferred and they used to ask the customer to shell out extra money for
CLI.

In the CISCO compatible world that most gear seeks to be in, the CLI
is extremely important to know. Notwithstanding GUI, the configuration
files are all CLI scripts that are run on every reboot. If something
backfires, you got to know CLI to know where and why the error occurs.

In a high end box we built, CLI was king. We did build a GUI but it
could never quite match the flexibility and power of the CLI. GUI
works well for prepackages sets of scenarios where an option would
produce a slew of CLI....

Yup.  Nice little utility - nice of you to mention it.

+1 Need to size /var/log  and keep it in a separate disk partition or
a logical volume.

logrotate does a nice job of cycling the logfiles.  To compliance
requirements, it is also necessary to ship the older log files to an
archive *before* they get rotated :)

The commercial virtualization / cloud vendors will disagree on the
above statements.   Today, an entire IT infrastructure (firewalls,
routers, vpn gateways, ethernet switches with vlan,  classic / desktop

Thats why I believe, If Gnome raises again to mobile/tablet world, it
will kick even the iOS's butt (not that droid, because it doesn't have a
butt). Anyone remember maemo? I'll buy N900 anytime without thinking
twice then buying the so called Android bloat. All the bytecode
languages sucks!!! at least in performance!! (may be I'm biased.. see
the disclaimer).

Well gnome have a solution to performance without compromising easiness,
its called Vala (https://live.gnome.org/Vala). Well, they made life more
easier now for the so called lazy programmers, Its called
Gjs(https://live.gnome.org/Gjs).

Disclaimer: I'm nowadays a gnome3 fan. not because of their UI, but
because of their middleware and ecosystem.

the process of hosting a web site. cPanel utilizes a 3 tier structure
that provides capabilities for administrators, resellers, and end-user
website owners to control the various aspects of website and server
administration through a standard web browser.
But it is a proprietary.
features:

   - Bandwidth, Domain Management,Sub-Domain Management ,POP3/IMAP Accounts
   - Mail Client Configuration, Forwards and
   Aliases, Autoresponders, Account Level Filtering
   - website statistics, logaholic statistics, analog statistics, bandwidth
   stat
   - security: IP denial, ssl/tls management, ssh/shell access, gnupg keys.

Message-ID: <CALDskyz8d9d+1CEqSsrRoHnMpWz3b6NquphYE20MOXfXazksZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Our IT industry also has not changed in the last 60 years of
existence. We still are doing testing, maintenance,
service projects. Training and education is not being attended to.
That is also full of mediocrity.

In order to capitalize on an open source project, to make it popular,
to make it a success, as in get lot of downloads,
 users, queries, and occasion projects/money a certain set of rules
have to be followed.

A project takes time to take off.

This is not surprising.

My LiveUSB OpenBSD project has been around for 4 years and more.

And I slowly started adding to it, improving it and what I started as
a fun project has now started earning money
 for me. But that is not something to speak of.

I know I have more to do.

I run close to 15 open source projects today but I never get any
traction from around 12 of them.

I started them recently and I think I myself did not pay attention to
it or use it myself to add the excellence angle to it.

And the rules I find are:

1) You have to create something unique and that fills a need. This is
true to succeed in biz. You can sell karivepilai in
Germany since you won't get it there. So import it from India, take
care of stocking it and sell it by paying for shop space.

2) You have to create unique content, unique code, something different
from what already is available which means
 you should be creative and be good at it. You should be doing
something interesting and better than what people
making 40L a year in Indian IT industry, globe trotting and meeting
customers are doing. You should be a good
programmer.

3) From the values standpoint you should not shrink at sharing away
for free. Nature will force it from you if you don't
 do it yourself. Moreover that will certainly do a lot of marketing
which is essential for promoting yourself in case you
 are not interested in marketing your initiative or biz

4) Few more values like responsiveness, continuous improvement,
staying technically focused and understanding
 the technology landscape also matter. These are really not values,
these go into the skill region. But normally you find
 that skill comes only after the right values are there.

Best of luck with open source project development.

Also sourceforge is a remarkably well managed organized way to promote
open source.

I don't know about GNOME for low-power mobile
platform, but I think developers must seriously
consider enlightenment framework. A couple of
proprietary hardware vendors are already using
them. The framework is light weight, efficient,
feature-rich and mature right now.

The problem currently is, they lack a
large ecosystem of applications, developer
community that are prevalent in GNOME and
KDE/Qt projects.

Actually, I've been a GNOME fan since the
beginning. I personally loved the default
GNOME3 UI - it's remarkable and futuristic
though unconventional. And yes, GNOME as
a project is evolved to be very robust.

Chandrashekar.

not care for your privacy ... their implementation of 'auto-magical

Ubuntu is helping Linux to reach as many people as possible. Lets not

If users have to be educated because the defaults are clearly bad for 
privacy, the right solution is for users to push for the product to 
change and have the feature be opt-in and not opt-out.  Pointing this 
out is not going to confuse or scare users.  It is valuable feedback.

        Unfortunately, Ubuntu is just doing more harm than good by
intruding upon once privacy. And it is promoting itself, not
GNU/Linux. Though I am not able to locate that specific link, there
was a suggestion from a Ubuntu developer a while back that Ubuntu
should drop the 'L' word(referring to Linux) in Firefox etc. so that
it just stands as Ubuntu and not as Ubuntu Linux something. This,
IMHO, is skewed up thinking.

Ubuntu supports a lots of newer hardware(the sole reason my laptop
runs ubuntu, but soon to switch over), but it just can't do such
stupid things as integrating Amazon stuff enabled by default. Thanks

Hi,

Switching to other distro and stuffs is not going to work for common users.
Many users who don't know what software is, how to open terminal or type
some command are there. They are the real users and telling these things
will scare them (this is the strategy that microsoft uses to scare big
corporations and not letting them to go away from microsoft products). So
please stop these. Many distros don't have a user friendly defaults. For
example in Fedora (fedora 15 or something) if I open a folder using
nautilus it will open in a separate window (this is senseless for a common
user who just wants to open a folder). There is always a way to change it
but common user don't (and need not) know and need not juggle with those
options. I am not saying Fedora is bad, I am not against it but some
defaults are really horrible and make common users run away from Linux.
Ubuntu is done a good job in this regard (even ubuntu has problems but it
is better compared to others in default choice). So lets not confuse people.

This is not to hurt anyone. Just shared my views.

PrasannaKumar

Please elaborate how/what will scare the users?

Don't the "regular" Windows desktop users download apply security/bug
patches from MS?

Ubuntu also provides software updates.
Ubuntu can release an update which will disable this feature.

That is not true at all.
People will listen if they are asked to.
Here we are dealing with shopping related issues as well and all
classes (including the petit bourgeois and bourgeois) will listen and

If I say you have to use synaptic package manager or ubuntu software centre
to install software they say "this is difficult" and ran away (this
happened with engineering students not with common people who don't have
any computer experience). Most common computer users knows that using
windows will have privacy issues. Most of them don't understand simple
thing like using IE will be a big problem - they just use it. I am speaking
about software engineers here. I personally have seen people who write
device drivers still believing IE is secure - I have tried to educate them
about using firefox and they are not ready to switch for security,
performance and features reasons. I do have seen people thinking modifying
the settings is a difficult thing.

Don't see from a software engineer or some one who used computers for 3+
years point of view. Think of a really common man who use computer to do
normal work (mail checking, writing documents, etc).

Ubuntu also provides software updates.

There are apt caching tools like apt-proxy, apt-cacher-ng that will do
it in a smart and efficient way if those bunch of machines are in a
network where at least one machine has access to the internet.

apt-on-cd (aptoncd.sourceforge.net) is a very good tool that could be
used for a similar purpose.

And why are you prefixing all the lines in your email with a '#'?

aptoncd is a good tool.But requires physical discs ,disc images cannot 
be used directly.
apt-proxy, apt-cacher-ng said requires networking.But I don't have a 
laptop to network with
friends pc if i wish to install to my friends pc where my idea helps me.

The link clearly states that you need the driver bundle for your
scanner; how to extract the firmware from the bundle and how to
install it.

Your next step is to contact BenQ and ask for the driver bundle.

http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2012/12/08/the-libreoffice-community-organises-a-6-day-test-marathon-to-help-preparing-the-new-4-0-version-of-libreoffice/

The Document Foundation announces the LibreOffice 4.0 Test Marathon.
During 6 days, from December 14 to 19, users and supporters around the
world will be testing the first beta of the upcoming LibreOffice 4.0.

The final version of LibreOffice 4.0 will be released in February
2013. By organising this big Test Marathon early, the developers will
be able to fix many bugs before the release candidates and the final
version are made available.

The LibreOffice community has organised various bug hunt sessions
before, with many people joining, bugs found and tests done. This has
contributed considerably to the overall quality of the product.

Also participants were enthusiastic. Thanks to helping in the QA work,
they learned a lot about powerful functions of LibreOffice and tricks
how to use the office suite.

Participating is easy and fun. Since the event is lasting a week,
everyone may choose the moments that suit them best.

Details are available on the wiki of The Document Foundation:
http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/QA/Test_Marathon_LibreOffice_4.0.
There?s also an overview of LibreOffice 4.0 new and improved features:
http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/4.0.

All participants need is a PC with Windows, Mac OS X or Linux, and a
LibreOffice 4.0 test version (which is available from
http://www.libreoffice.org/pre-releases), plus a lot of enthusiasm.

Filing bugs will be extremely easy, thanks to the help of experienced
people who will be around those days to help users and supporters with
tips, on the QA mailing list (libreoffice-qa at freedesktop.org) and on
the IRC channel (irc://chat.freenode.net/libreoffice-qa).

Dear all,

I had posted a job for perl. But I got only one response. That means
that  there is negligible
 perl knowledge in LUG.

Do you expect to be spoonfed everything?

Why don't you pick up on your own?

Perl is hard like UNIX but you can learn with time and effort. It is a
very nice language.

Aptitude will come only when the right bhavana is there. You need attitude.

Anyway I hope you can learn perl soon. Let me see if I can organize
some perl class again.

The last time I did that was more than 3 years ago.

That may be a good idea.

Oh I had one in which exactly 3 ppl were there. ;)

I mean the one I did in Teynampet long ago.

Okay I will send perl coding tips in another mail.

-Girish

Subject: [Ilugc] Perl basics
Message-ID: <CALDskyy=H644Rv0P8nx7d-5WZe1dqngnLvG+OQAjOoyiDzE1VQ@mail.gmail.com>

Since the level of perl knowledge sucks I will start from the basics.

I had already done that long ago. But now the LUG river will have new fishes.

Okay it is really trivial to get the first perl code running:

$ cat f.pl
print "How are you?";

That is it.

Every line is terminated with semicolon and if and else and elsif all
require  parantheses like C.

But you cannot leave  it out for single lines as in C.

Java and perl and C++ all follow C style. perhaps not C++.

Anyway the way to read a file is very simple.  You can either directly
read with the diamond(<>) operator
 or use the Tie::File CPAN module.

$ cat fileread.pl

for(<>) {
    print;
}

That is it.

now run it with

$ perl fileread.pl /etc/passwd

To actually open a file for reading,

$ cat openfile.pl
open F, "/etc/passwd";

for(<F>) {
   print;
}

close F;

Now to write to a file, do this:

$ cat writefile.pl

open F, ">/tmp/test";
print F "how is this going?\n";
close F;

Try these first.

Hi Girish,

It is not only negligence, there are people who are comfort with their
current jobs, and so they havent sent you the reply. Atleast I personally
know of 4 people in ILUGC, in that 2 are masters in Perl, and other 2 know
Perl very well.

But they are happy with their current job profile.

Looking forward for your perl tips.... :)

Please let me know if you have any queries.

Thanks,

John

Possibly most here are employed or there are not many people here. Did you
specify salary. Something around 30 - 40 K should be attractive enough.

Subject: [Ilugc] time and computers
Message-ID: <CALDskywpO9xyomON6-HoB4-UTePAjGECCA8OCrbCZ6tOB+X73w@mail.gmail.com>

In 1998 when I started my career in Novell in 1998 I started work in
time synchronization.

I wrote a protocol convertor between Novell Timesync and UNIX NTP and
this work saved
 Novell a 5m dollar British telecom deal and I also did another bugfix
for which I got an award.

Of course in big MNCs awards are one way to manage political equations. ;)

Now time synchronization is not something that is easy. Not at all.

A prof in univ of Delaware Dave Mills wrote the NTP rfc and he
maintains the various other
literature on it.

The documentation is incredibly chatty but very comprehensive. You
obtain atomic clock precision
 from Cesium crystals aboard satellites.

There are various NTP stratum 1 servers around the world that fetch
this time through radio long wave (sat is microwave)
 and also transmit in radio.

Of course with computers we only have to use UDP. ;)

There is very simple basic school algebra here. You get time from a
remote stratum 1 or 2 NTP server and your time is
 off by a few seconds, and then you have to account for the latency of
the packet transit.

It can be corrected provided the uplink and downlink delays are identical.

Of course all this was in 1998.

Subsequently a German Henning Brauer wrote OpenNTPD(www.openntpd.org)
for OpenBSD.

That removed all the nonsense and complexity of the UNIX ntpd or xntpd toolset.

Now this is installed in all OpenBSD machines as this is in base.

In fact you can get accurate time if you use my

http://liveusb-openbsd.sf.net

Try it. It is incredibly  useful to get started.

Or try this livecd.

http://livecd-openbsd.sf.net

A simple way to correct the skew or some timezone issue just this:

# rdate ptbtime1.ptb.de

I do this when my computer is off by a large amount.

The RTC clocks that run with the CMOS clock on the mobo are usually
not accurate.

Not even as good as the wrist watches  you wear.

Why is time imp?

Well all processes depend on wallclock time.

Message-ID: <CAND2795ea6rz94cEaHXb4GJ8mymbJqWfKm=hPRZMxPdhAFz-SQ@mail.gmail.com>

Source:
http://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/12/10/wordpress-3-5-rc6-is-out-please-if-you/

WordPress 3.5 RC6 is out. Please, if you can (and earlier the better),
hammer on TinyMCE with the most ridiculous object and embed tags you
can find, and anything HTML5. (Here?s a zip for the nightly build.)

What?s important in RC6? After a good first attempt last week
(#22790), we took another stab (#22842) at fixing TinyMCE?s handling
of, well, ridiculous object and embed tags. Our goal right now is to
ensure that nothing breaks in 3.5 that worked in 3.4.2. So, go find
your best embed spaghetti* and make sure nothing breaks.**

    Very easy to test: Go to the ?Text ?tab, paste something in, head
to the Visual tab, confirm things don?t look broken, head back to the
?Text? tab, see if it looks mangled, head back to Visual, confirm
things don?t look broken. Remember, we are looking for regressions, so
also check 3.4.2 to see if it occurs there.

** Breaks means the embed disappears in whole or part, or there?s a
JavaScript error, or your computer starts smoking. Whitespace and
other HTML changes do/will happen (contents may settle during
shipping). Of course, your content should never be damaged, as that?s
just no fun.

What happened to the last two RCs? We generally try to do a ?soft? or
?silent? RC at the very end of a cycle. We?re confident we?ve gotten
the testing it needs, but we?d like to enter a 24-hour period where
there are no more changes to trunk. Having a cleaner version number
provides for a good line in the sand, and can help in case some
blocker bug report comes in. Of course this time, we?ve stuttered a
few times. TinyMCE hell was RC4. A few final changes on Friday (after
we decided to not release) resulted in RC5. And the second round of
TinyMCE hell is RC6.

This also means our new target is Tuesday, December 11. We?ll again
convene at 10 a.m. Eastern to see if the winds are blowing in our
direction. (Even NASA needs good weather.)

Moztrap is a web application, that should simplify the supply of tests
for software in a cooperative way. Along with software life cycle, it
suggests test cases documents, that can be run by several testers
using different locales and operating systems. The results of those
tests can be recorded and reported in Moztrap with a few fairly simple
steps.

Meanwhile, it is noticeable that to use Moztrap complicated computer
skills are not required.

Difficult call. Acad equivalents are QCAD, FreeCAD etc. I found QCAD
good. Draftsight is another free but not open source from Dassault
Systemes.

For solid modelling BRLCAD is touted but falls short by miles.

FEM needs specialised element libraries while the FEM solvers
themselves are simple and OSS programs exist. Without proper element
libraries, the FEM/FEA software is useless. Finding equivalents of
Ansys/NASTRAN/ABAQUS etc is next to impossible. OSS would have
separate solvers for static/linear and non-linear/dynamic analyses.
All these guys have attractive educational licences.

I ment that if I had replaced the NIC card on the server then it is okay
for the OS to have named my nic card in that increasing order, however it
this case all I did was to reboot the machine and eth0 became eth5.

I am using Dell Rack based server, which has four ethernet card.  While
installing the system I configure eth0 to be my mgmt interface.  Then I ran
apt-get update and apt-get upgrade, then rebooted the system when I faced
this problem of eth0 never came up :-(

This worked on an instance, thanks.  However how do I make sure that the OS
does not rename the interface automatically and cause this confusion ?

I don't have your persistent rules file handy.  I have not seen the
contents change *unless*  there is some hardware change - removal does
not delete it's respective entry and addition creates an new entry
with the eth number bumped up.

See above - entries in the persistent rules file should not change
mapping of eth name to mac address.  You can make a backup copy of the
persistent rules file for reference.

Here I did not do any hardware change all I did was "apt-get update"
followed by "apt-get upgrade" followed by "reboot", however this occured
just once.  On subsequent reboots the ethX does not get bumped up by one.

This has happened around 3 time in approximately 50 servers so far.  If the
same continues I am planning to turn on the file immutable with chattr to
prevent it from getting changed, do you think that might help ?

The first thing I do after installing a box is setup ifrename. I usually
name the interfaces to 'eth-pub', 'eth-pvt', 'eth-mgmt', etc.

It becomes dire necessity and a prerequisite for applications involving HA,

Dear Girish Ji,

Why do you always need to be so sarcastic ?

I love linux, and would even want to live with it, most of the time
(99.99%) it gives me everything and even the community people are very good
mannered and well cultured.

There are many times that even a simple reply can be made into a top-class
solution to the OP. When dont you answer from Linux point of view !!!!

Do, turn in your charm face when you are replying.

I always liked those sessions when we met for spam cheetah at chennai
(Frontier & others).

Looking to see your charming friendly reply (instead of hard-task-master
type).

regards,
s.sivakumar

Subject: [Ilugc] today's perl class
Message-ID: <CALDskyz7XC0sDJQ4_bhXLTd+RaxcynALwpWn+P0+OGkWSsv3ug@mail.gmail.com>

I am not sure about a physical class.

I have not yet forgotten my last bad experience when no one turned up.

Moreover I am also not sure about the modalities.

But e-mail classes are okay.

We will see some simple regex code today.

Let us look for the name girish in /etc/passwd fine.

$ cat findgirish.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl

open F,"/etc/passwd";
for(<F>) {
   if(/girish/) {
      print "Found Girish . $_ \n";
   }
}

close F;

Actually open should be done like this:

open H, "file" or die "could not open file";

Anyway you can write a simple conditional set like this:

if(/fo/) {
}elsif(/bar/) {
} elsif(/fat/) {
}

perldoc perlre

will give you a good idea.

Regexes are a complex topic and it took me close to 3 months to master it.

You can pickup the UNIX regex pattern set from the flex man page as well.

Sometime back I faced the similar  situation. I wanted all eth's to be static even if card is changed (a box in a remote location).
I edited /etc/udev/rules.d/75-persistent-net-generator.rules. In whitelist I added eth*. This stopped udev from assigning rules for eth.

However, what you face should be bug. Better to take it in debian mailing list.

Message-ID: <CAND27973D4eSQXB9HDfC_tnEUVMr6xu+-k6gAWCJTtLSZo21Yg@mail.gmail.com>

Source:
http://www.cyberciti.biz/linux-news/download-samba4-software-active-directory-compatible-server/

Samba is a free software re-implementation of the SMB/CIFS networking
protocol. Samba version 4 has been released. It is a major rewrite
that enables Samba to be an Active Directory domain controller. I have
been waiting years for this option.

>From the release note:

    Samba 4.0 supports the server-side of the Active Directory logon
environment used by Windows 2000 and later, so we can do full domain
    join and domain logon operations with these clients.

    Our Domain Controller (DC) implementation includes our own
built-in LDAP server and Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) as
well as the Samba3-like logon services provided over CIFS. We
correctly generate the infamous Kerberos PAC, and include it with the
Kerberos tickets we issue.

    When running an AD DC, you only need to run 'samba' (not
smbd/nmbd/winbindd), as the required services are co-coordinated by
this master binary. The tool to administer the Active Directory
services is called 'samba-tool'.

Download Samba version 4.x

You can grab the latest version by visiting this url
https://www.samba.org/samba/download/
 and read press release here.

OK - this explains it.  I missed it in your OP.  However, you did not
mention the build date.   AFAIK, Debian Wheezy is aka Testing i.e. it
is not released product.  Use it at your own risk.

I have encountered similar behaviour [1] in Debian Wheezy and Ubuntu 12.04.
Having said that, I am using Wheezy build DebianInstaller Beta3 and
udev is consistent with respect to NIC devices in the persistent rules
file, ditto with  Ubuntu 12.04.1.

[1] In my case udev would not make any entries in the persistent file
after I blanked the file and rebooted the OS.

Wheezy is in testing phase (see my above comment) - use it at your own
risk.   Do mention the build date if you decide to file a bug report.

chattr would help (work around) but there is a more fundamental issue
that you need to resolve for yourself:

Will these systems be deployed into production?   Sometimes it may be
necessary to install Debian testing (hardware driver support) but make
sure that your management is well aware of it.

Nice alternative.   I have used it many years ago but with udev
persistent rules it went out of my horizon.

Hi Team,

Its looks fine and you are using name based virtual host. Have made any
entry for abc.com at DNS server. please do and retry again.

Here below error show's looks like fully qualified domain name name. you
can try www.abc.com instaed of  abc.com <http://www.abc.com>.
or change the server name as www.abc.com change and restart httpd

Thank You,

Hi,

As I discussed in the last Ilugc meet, I have finished this twitter app.
Here is the source,

https://github.com/mohan43u/gtweet

I didn't create any package though, you have to compile it from source,
it needs some libraries to be installed in your system.

Here is pkg-config dependencies

gio-unix-2.0.pc
gobject-2.0.pc
gtk+-3.0.pc
gdk-3.0.pc
oauth.pc
gobject-introspection-1.0.pc
libsoup-2.4.pc

If you see above files in your /usr/lib/pkgconfig directory, then you
are good to compile, else, compilation will fail. you have to install
corresponding packages which will install this files (means, you may
have to install *-dev|*-devel packages)

An introduction document is available here,

https://github.com/mohan43u/gtweet/blob/master/doc/README.pdf

I hope it will be useful for you.

Thanks,
Mohan R

I was wrong about this.

The Ruby on rails programmer can work in India and get paid in UK pounds.

Or US dollars.

If the guy is really good he will get a job in the US.

Subject: [Ilugc] perl log analysis
Message-ID: <CALDskyxWUvr6hArieJZB6ehyouEiVi=X-t64=zMsqB1HSYFBbg@mail.gmail.com>

One can analyze log files or text files using perl.

It is possible to use regex and perl's ease of file reading, scalars,
arrays and hash data
 structures to process data.

We will see a few samples in this mail.

Say you want to slurp all the numbers in a file. You want no numerical data.

Then this code will do.

$ cat removenum

for(<>) {
          s/\d//g;
          print;
}

Then if you wish to print all the lines containing numbers,

$ cat printnumlines
for(<>) {
            print if (/\d/);
}

You can do things like changing the case of all alphabets or
capitalize all words.

$ cat ucase
for(<>) {
            uc();
            print;
}

You run all these samples like this.

$ perl ucase <textfile>

Try more samples like this.

-Girish

Of course you have to redirect the resultant text to some other file
in case you wish to save the
 processing.

Tool of the Day - Tripwire

 Open Source Tripwire is a free software security and data
integrity tool useful for monitoring and alerting on specific file
changes on a range of system. It functions as a host-based
intrusion detection system. Rather than attempting to detect
intrusions at the network interface level While useful for detecting
intrusions after the event, it can also serve many other purposes,
such as integrity assurance, change management, and policy
compliance.

None to my knowledge.

I have heard of Raj Mathur way back in early 90's as a FOSS activist.

I never had the fortune of meeting him though. Like KG.

My condolences to his family on him loss.

We have lost one of the pioneers of FLOSS movement in India.

The Linux Foundation - a non-profit organization behind the Linux kernel
development, promotion and protection releases a new video on the title "
2012:What a Year for Linux" and covers major happenings around Linux kernel
that took place during the current year.

Wired thing to note on the video is that they are using Mozilla Firefox
Browser (well actually that's a good news) and Mac system or a Mac theme !

Message-ID: <CALV9omY_yhFZ5BKFcqP4LbPrC-tcUk7x+BM9b2Ad33M-WJ383g@mail.gmail.com>

Tool of the Day: Monitorix

  Monitorix is a free, open source, lightweight system monitoring tool
designed to monitorize as many services as it can. At this time it
monitors from the CPU load and temperatures to the users using the
system. Network devices activity, network services demand and even
the devices' interrupt activity are also monitored. The current status of
any corporate Linux server with Monitorix installed can be accessed
via a web browser.
It has been designed to be used under production UNIX/Linux servers,
but you can use it on your laptop or on your Linux box at home as
well.

For system monitoring in laptop, I would also recommend conky. You
can easily get the codes for various configurations from the net.

Subject: [Ilugc] more perl
Message-ID: <CALDskyzWnCPArCJ8Rf2iVh3zKjuaCDaEVaW65cJB_UGqD+Aa2w@mail.gmail.com>

I was browsing the CPAN search site today looking for modules.

Those of you that dunno perl will not know CPAN.

Even if you do know perl I wonder how many know that perl comes pre
installed with certain modules.

Stuff like Digest::MD5, Digest::SHA1, Tie::File and many others.

For stuff that  you wish to do that is not distributed when you
install perl  you require to install like this:

# perl -MCPAN -e 'install Text::Reform;'

This is going to bug you before you find that it installs the module requested.

This also illustrates that perl has a fairly extensive command line
processing engine which has made a lot of
 per one liners popular.

The examples I showed for file processing line by line looking for
patterns and modifying some can be done
 using one liners.

But they are for advanced use.

In fact,

$ perl -pi -e 's/girish/nobody/' /tmp/ex.txt

will do an in place replacement which is a cool feature.

There are several reasons to mark your mail as  spam,

* The IP you are using may be a blacklisted one
* SMTP authentication is not enabled in mail server  -> not in all cases
* Your antispam engine does not included the appropriate spam verification
info in the mail header -> not in all cases
* Suspicious words in your email subject or the body.

ILUGC wiki was spammed once again.
Though the main page contents were safe,
The spam bots created many new pages and it took around 2G of mysql db.

To save space, installed a new mediawiki instance and restored the
pages we created.

Added the following extensions.
ConfirmEdit
SpamBlackList

Now the wiki is safe.

I will receive an email alert for any change in the wiki, so that we
can fix if any spam happens.

I request you all to create a new account to edit the wiki.


Thanks for your patience.

Message-ID: <CALV9omY=a14=0zD6nL-JiL9L8dnek92kx+UJ4Fuuq29NDLwX7w@mail.gmail.com>

Tool of the Day: Webmin

 Webmin is a web-based system configuration tool for Unix-like
systems, although recent versions can also be installed and
run on Windows. With it, it is possible to configure operating
system internals, such as users, disk quotas, services or
configuration files, as well as modify and control open source apps,
such as the Apache HTTP Server, PHP orMySQL.

 Webmin is largely based on Perl, running as its own process
and web server. It defaults to TCP port 10000 for communicating,
and can be configured to use SSL if OpenSSL is installed with
additional required Perl Modules.

I used Webmin to adminsiter machines in my web farm in the 90s. This
is a good admin tool especially in webfarms. You can one machine as a
master and all others as slaves running webmin and configure all
machines by logging into just this master. A whole lot of plugins also
exist for Webmin for different packages apart from the ability to
write custom modules. Webmin also has heartbeat and service monitoring
across machines with logs and alerts on exceptions/error conditions.

Message-ID: <CALDskywnrfN2kb_XxKBxNv8Y2KbC1-dBYMZOniBHAHomqak83A@mail.gmail.com>

You can use a CPAN module by reading its man page.

Most CPAN modules are available as packages in most UNICes.

But as I said you could simple

# perl -MCPAN -e 'install Foo:Bar;'

Now after you install the package,

$ man Foo::Bar

or

$ perldoc Foo::Bar

will give you ample usage examples. With that you can begin programming.

Knowing perl without knowing how to use CPAN and benefit by it is like
learning how to cook without
 knowing how your food tastes.

CPAN has a searchable interface:

http://search.cpan.org
which gives you plenty of options to figure out which module you can
start playing with.

For distros like Centos, It is best to use the Package Management system
like yum.

That was ancient knowledge.
Since Perl 5.6, 'cpan Foo::Bar' should
suffice.

Once you've learned Perl well enough,
you'll rarely need CPAN - it's a crutch and
a mere distraction.

Subject: [Ilugc] How to learn python and perl
Message-ID: <CALDskyxJBC49Oa79zHoKnRxa2wRW0Wpp9CpBynDu0EiuZBifGQ@mail.gmail.com>

Okay let us look at my case.

My case is not typical since my attitude is thoroughly Western,
totally unfit for India, my approach
 completely different from those of others I see around.

Still it will serve as a case.

Long long long ago when I started my career I knew nothing of
programming having started off from an ECE
 background. I was scared of coding. Problem solving and making my
brain work was too painful.

I was always very good at math and studies.

Now after I got fired in California when I went there as a crypto
consultant, after I did some soul searching as
 to how I wanted to see myself dying I resolved to learn coding.

And I learnt perl and C. That was in 2003.

I had a great boss and I learnt a lot from him but I really taught
myself. This has been the case even from my childhood
 days in Lakshadweep.

I told you, my case is not typical.

Today I run more than 12 open source projects, I almost became an
OpenBSD dev(not very interesting) and I feel that
 technically I don't have any fear to learn something new.

This happened because I had a steadfast view to learn coding.

And that I did over a long period. Over 18 months or so.

Once I broke the mental issues, the cultural issues and the attitude
problems rest was easy.

To learn a language like Python or perl is much easier than learning C.

One can begin programming in Python and slowly graduate to Perl and then to C.

But hoping to learn in sequence is like trying to live life in sequence.

Never happens.

Take up something easy, keep browsing, keep reading, be disciplined
and worship Goddess Saraswathy daily.

You will get there. Slowly.

Slow and steady.

Never bother about job or money. That will come after you have coding ability.

If you are handsome girls will come after you...

Subject: [Ilugc] the other way to read ilugc mails
Message-ID: <kao3at$g49$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hi,

As you guys might know , you can read ilugc via gmane web interface (blog 
or frames). But gmane also offers nntp service. Which is also free just 
like web interface is free. One can use nntp client to read. I use pan as 
news client to read the posts. Configuring pan to read ilugc post is very 
straight forward, anyone can do it. The interface pan gives is also cool. 
It is just like reading mails from thunderbird. You can also post to ilugc 
from pan through gmane. For which the first time only gmane will require 
to authorize by visiting the crypted link it sends to your subscribed 
email account. After that it is business as usual. One benefit i find is 
that i find , it helps to keep mailing list traffic from exploding your 
inbox, while you still read them and post to them and you remain 
subscribed. One feature i found bugging me is that ilugc m/l 
administrator have added encrptyion of mail id so that bots dont spam 
them, which is good. Gmane offers the email as image so that only humans 
could read them. I wrote the following script which downloads the image. 
SO that i dont have to fire up brower to see the image. 

==========gmane.sh=========
#!/bin/bash
wget -O image "http://gmane.org/address.php?string=$1"
eog image
=========================================

So i invoke it as 
$ gmane.sh 'ashwin.chn at gmail.com'

Remember qouting is important otherwise script will be confused, as with 
most bash script. 

But then you dont need to do the above to email that person. The above is 
only necessary if you want to see the person's actual email id.

I think pan is cool. I have been reading with it for a month now and i 
wont be going back to the gmail or gmane web interface again to read. I 
know gmail offers imap and pop services. But gmail web interface offer 
lot more services.

Tool of the Day: Spamassassin

  SpamAssassin is a e-mail spam filtering based on content-matching rules.
SpamAssassin uses a variety of spam-detection techniques, that includes
DNS-based and fuzzy-checksum-based spam detection, Bayesian filtering,
external programs, blacklists and online databases.
  The program can be integrated with the mail server to automatically filter
all mail for a site. It can also be run by individual users on their own
mailbox
and integrates with several mail programs.SpamAssassin is highly
configurable;
if used as a system-wide filter it can still be configured to support
per-user
preferences.

The emphasis is on scaling - to handle ~3000 concurrent requests and hence
we're looking for people with NoSQL experience and preferably deliver this
by leveraging AWS.

Interested candidates or parties can get in touch over email at
suraj at careergear.in . Detailed functional spec will be given after a brief

Subject: [Ilugc] How to learn python and perl

Okay let us look at my case.

My case is not typical since my attitude is thoroughly Western,
totally unfit for India, my approach
 completely different from those of others I see around.

Still it will serve as a case.

Long long long ago when I started my career I knew nothing of
programming having started off from an ECE
 background. I was scared of coding. Problem solving and making my
brain work was too painful.

I was always very good at math and studies.

Now after I got fired in California when I went there as a crypto
consultant, after I did some soul searching as
 to how I wanted to see myself dying I resolved to learn coding.

And I learnt perl and C. That was in 2003.

I had a great boss and I learnt a lot from him but I really taught
myself. This has been the case even from my childhood
 days in Lakshadweep.

I told you, my case is not typical.

Today I run more than 12 open source projects, I almost became an
OpenBSD dev(not very interesting) and I feel that
 technically I don't have any fear to learn something new.

This happened because I had a steadfast view to learn coding.

And that I did over a long period. Over 18 months or so.

Once I broke the mental issues, the cultural issues and the attitude
problems rest was easy.

To learn a language like Python or perl is much easier than learning C.

One can begin programming in Python and slowly graduate to Perl and then to C.

But hoping to learn in sequence is like trying to live life in sequence.

Never happens.

Take up something easy, keep browsing, keep reading, be disciplined
and worship Goddess Saraswathy daily.

You will get there. Slowly.

Slow and steady.

Never bother about job or money. That will come after you have coding ability.

If you are handsome girls will come after you...

Subject: [Ilugc] CGI perl
Message-ID: <CALDskyzVb0UYdpVS7E1Z0YBXQjk8-=rhBOHMj4U7v9=bPBaLOg@mail.gmail.com>

CGI 101 is really simple.

What is CGI?

What is 101?

CGI is the web's method of returning dynamic data in place of static
html pages that you manually edit.

Common Gateway Interface means nothing like Random access memory. ;)

So unless you try it out you will learn nothing.

And 101 means fundamentals. So this mail talks about CGI in a
fundamental way. We will see some advanced
 use in the coming days.

A CGI script is a program executed by the web server say Apache or
nginx or something.

It can be a shell script, C, perl or python code.

It is usually written in an interpreted scripting language like perl or python.

Every CGI script has to output the MIME type text/html or text/plain
or else your server will give 501 error.

"Internal server error"

This is a very good error message. It means that you will now tear
your hair learning CGI. ;)

CGI is a concept you can master easily with perl or shell.

But you should really now:

$ perldoc CGI

$ man CGI

You can easily master how to use  CGI perl module.

$ cat first.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI;

$q = new CGI;

print $q->header;

That is it. First get this working. If your browser does not show an
error then you can proceed.

You also need to set the

ScriptAlias variable in Apache httpd.conf

Then do some interesting things.

$ cat sec.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI;

$q = CGI->new();

print $q->header;

$d = `date`;
print "Current time is $d\n";

Also you should set the script executable and readable for others.

In OpenBSD all scripts run as www user.

In Linux it is different. It will run as nobody or root.

Message-ID: <CAFe1ooL8yfH=jnovCPmZJ2RF_+SGqGyjN__F5B8cKz9Fpr4y-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Using ffmpeg in Linux. I am trying to read a live RTMP stream and restream
through HLS to iOS devices.
ffmpeg has a segmenter feature which is able to create m3u8 playlists. It
is working fine for static files. When I try to use it for a live stream, I
am ending up with iOS devices rejecting the feed. The same live and
segmented m3u8 playlist works fine on Mac/Safari and Mac/Quicktime.

I know it is a vague problem thanks to the crazy number of
container/format/codecs available in the AV world. My only other solution
is probably to use Adobe's media server.

Anybody who has experience in this or could give me some direction?
Thanks.

Arun Venkataswamy

I have a little experience in ffmpeg and android.
Please provide more information about your problem.

Do you want to use ffmpeg library in some application you are developing
for Android? This involves the NDK and not just the SDK.

If you just want to play streams in you app, the simplest way is this:

 Git? - Here is CollabNet
Message-ID: <CAND2796J_hVHuYrfXHWxH-u1R9Oouo2tokGNav12VBMJfnQOPg@mail.gmail.com>

The entire IT world is turning towards using Free Software, nowadays.
One of the major issues in implementing the FOSS Solutions in the corporates is

Technical Support for the Free Open Source software.


Though the Free Software Communities are very active in providing free
support in mailing lists,
IRC channels, Public forums etc, the organizations can not wait till
someone answers in these channels
when some critical issue happens.

On those critical situations, they need some helping hand, some
shoulder to fall on.
even they are ready to pay for the commercial support for Free Software.


Most companies now start to provide commercial support for Free Software.

Example:
CollabNet [ http://collab.net ] - Apache Subversion, Git
Redhat [ http://redhat.com ] - Redhat Linux
Canonical [http://www.canonical.com] - Ubuntu Linux
Novell [https://www.suse.com/ ]- Suse
PostgreSQL - EnterpriseDB Corporation (http://www.enterprisedb.com)

It is a good thing to see the list is growing and more companies
choose the support as their way of making money with Free Open Source
Software.

CollabNet, which is providing Support for Subversion from its early
days, now started to support Git too.

How does CollabNet support git?
CollabNet has its own ALM product called TeamForge
[http://www.collab.net/products/teamforge] . It can have git as a part
of its version control system, which provides easy UI to manage
repositories and provide access control.

Apart from that customers can buy only GIT support where they can get
the open source git from their repositories and get support from
CollabNet.

CollabNet has a expert team on git and it pays for developers who
contribute for Git. With the experts in Git, CollabNet provides
support via email, phone and remote session.

See here the plans.

http://www.collabnet.com/support/support-programs#git

CollabNet is already providing same support for Subversion where it
pays for Subversion developers and provides Commercial Support and
free support via its forums.
http://forums.open.collab.net/

Read the git blogs here: http://blogs.collab.net/git where the experts
from CollabNet share their experience in Git.

It is providing hosted solution for Git and Subversion too. Check here
http://www.cloudforge.com/

Its a great opportunity for organizations to implement git with the
support from CollabNet.

I'm not sure what you are trying to do with FFmpeg, if your goal is to
create something on top of FFmpeg on android, you should take a look at
these articles too,

http://blog.pkh.me/p/13-the-ffmpeg-libav-situation.html
http://codecs.multimedia.cx/?p=339

In short, there was a Coup-like-thing happened to FFmpeg project that
didn't go well and the result is a fork-sort-of-thing called Libav.
Debian switched to Libav as well as it's child Ubuntu, Gentoo switched
to Libav as well as it's child Sabayon. I'm not sure the status of
Fedora (anyone who use fedora can say whether they have Libav by
locating avprobe/avconv/avplay binaries)

So, its basically, you have to make a decision whether to use FFmpeg or
Libav. As of now, both projects share code they write, but the way they
write is different from each other. As a end user we don't have to care
as long as ffmpeg/avconv have ABI/API compatibility. But in future, they
may not.

Mohan R

Sudo is the way to do it. Handing over the root password is not advisable.

You have rootkits and other tools for forensics. I never use them.

You can keep track of all the files which got modified with the help of
AIDE, however this would not log the activities of user it can only tell if
a file is changed or not.

Getting CGI to work after you have solved the 501 - Internal server error
 is interesting.

You have something to talk about now.

Let us look at few crisp useful examples. Then I will tell you how to
use Ajax with jQuery to
 build a useful web application.

No useful stuff can be done without javascript and CGI.

In fact this alone is sufficient. No need to use bloated Catalyst,
Mason or Python CGI frameworks.

If people talk about this in LUG it is only due to ignorance. How many
people in LUG have grown
 beyond Linux?

Anyway let us look at the first CGI code that does some real work now.

$ cat interst
#!/usr/bin/perl

use  CGI;

$q = new CGI;

print $q->header, $q->start_html;

$uptime = `uptime`;

print "The uptime of this host is : $uptime\n";

$loggedin = `w`;

print "The list of users logged in is \n";

print "<pre>";

print $loggedin;

print "</pre>";

print $q->end_html;


$ cat another
#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI;

$q = new CGI;

print $q->header, $q->start_html;

$pslist = `ps ax`;

print "<pre>";

print $pslist;

print "</pre>";

print $q->end_html;

I can give you more and more and more.

But we stop here.

It is not advisable to share the root password with people whose actions you 
feel the need to track. Use group definitions / sudo to limit define 
groups/roles and the actions that are allowed for users in those groups.

That said, to do overall system auditing, take a look at the auditd daemon.

[pdf link] http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf

Please read 2.6.2 for auditd -- and the entire document if you want to learn how 
to properly secure your system.

Title is misleading. x86 is more than 90% of the market I think even
with Apple gear and Sun.

You just can't ignore x86.

My LiveUSB project only supports x86 and I get queries often, nobody
asked it for any other architecture.

So this article says that old legacy 486 code is being thrown away.
This is like saying that
Minix is dead. We know that.

Hi Girish,

It is not x86. The title clearly says it is just 386 not x86.

      IIRC, on Debian, uname -m (or uname -a) used to return i386 for
x86 machines(Or was always i686 ?) and hence the confusion Thanks.

Hi,

Can you justify how Python "CGI" frameworks are bloated ? Have 
you developed any sizable web application (something better than
a web based monitoring tool or a report generator) that you could
show us as proof that Perl CGI is "all"  you need ? 

>  If people talk about this in LUG it is only due to ignorance.

Most people in LUG who know their stuff stay quiet (generally). 
Ignorance leads to biased, subjective opinion and misinformation. 
You don't grow *beyond* Linux as there's just empty space beyond it.
You rather grow from neanderthal UNIX-spinoffs to Linux :-)

Some folks just can't handle the strong concoction of pragmatism, 
ingenuity, creativity and intellectual potential that Linux kernel 
development demands - so they rant against it not on their chosen
favorite OS's groups - but rather in a LUG group.

Any beginner web developer will know that this is  *not* how 
you learn CGI programming nor how you develop web 
applications. Kindly stop feeding misinformation to those 
unaware.   

Hard-coding HTML elements and tags within your CGI 
program is a very bad idea - no matter how small your web 
application. The whole purpose of using perl is out-right 
defeated with the above approach.

Atleast, the code above should've followed idioms like the 
one below:
----------------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use CGI;

# The following template could be read from a file
my $template = <<END;
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
 <body>
   <p>The uptime of this host is %s</p>
   <p>The list of users logged in are:
      <pre>%s</pre>
   </p>
  </body>
</html>
END

my $q = new CGI;

print $q->header;
printf $template, `uptime`, `w`;
--------------------------------------------------------------

Most modern frameworks (Catalyst, Rails, Grails, DJango, 
Cherrypy, etc...) remedy this problem without the steep
learning curve of CGI scalability modelling and deployment.

Maybe, you must spend time learning some new languages
and frameworks and not to forget - Linux internals
to rid yourself from biased judgement.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

Giving out the root password and then having to track is almost 
impossible. You should instead add his account to sudoers list and give 
approriate privileges, then the problem becomes some what manageably 
trackable and contraollable. One more thing is that to use the bash shell 
history feature to log all commands typed in a terminal with date and 
time stamp. For more details see http://larsmichelsen.com/open-source/
bash-timestamp-in-bash-history/ and you can use the same feature to use 
history for large amounts of time like explained here http://www.debian-
administration.org/articles/175

Main article is not about -m, it is something related to -p, My laptop
says,

$ uname -p
Intel(R) Core(TM) i3 CPU M 380 @ 2.53GHz

If your linux[1] says i386 for -p, then you should consider reading
mentioned article.

To my knowledge, -m means processor architecture like i386/i686, x86_64,
sun4u/sparc, arm* etc.,

Thanks,
Mohan R

[1] I'm insisting on linux. because only linux dropped support for i386
chip. Not others.

The creator of Catalyst no longer recommends Catalyst. They have created
Mojolicious - a kickass web framework that puts itself ahead of most
existing modern web frameworks with support for WebSocket, evented I/O,
REST-ful interfaces, a beautiful, simple syntax for creating web apps and
even ships with its own little jquery powered web-based debugger -
http://mojolicio.us. I've been extensively using it to build many
applications for myself and my clients. Move on.

Equally comparable is Dancer http://www.perldancer.org/ - very similar
syntax and all. But I haven't tried this out although there are great
reviews about dancer.

... and dancer / mojolicious are also capable of limping around in CGI mode
besides running under any PSGI / Plack environment.

Cheers,

  -Suraj

PS: Ever tried running a plain CGI app on a Xen guest? (like EC2). fork
sucks.

Message-ID: <CALDskyx2jC+6KfcZ-vcBsTDc9MRQTufbMFPjgqB1g_Ho46smkw@mail.gmail.com>

In my CGI journey so far I have had trouble displaying a progress bar
for HTTP POST uploads.

It has always been a sticky wicket.

Apache doesn't cut it. I am yet to learn nginx.

And even  CGI.pm does not help much.

Also CPAN does not help.

Then something happened.

In life if you do the right things and wait long enough you will get there. ;)

So something called xHR came along. I dunno what that is.

Something that browsers began to support.

And today you can do upload progress bar, drag and drop upload,
multiple files asynchronously uploading
all with some jQuery magic and perl CGI of course using CGI.pm.

I got this working for a project of mine and it is so satisfying.

I have started using dancer for the past few months. It is simple and allows lot of flexibility in coding. I am migrating my perl/tk codes (about 2.5lakh lines) to dancer based. I like dancer very much.

With upcoming dancer 2 it will be totallo OO.

        Catalyst was a bit frustrating(and bulky) when I tried it. I
agree that we shouldn't be using it :).

      +1. Recently, I had to work with dancer for something at office.
And it is really simple, and doesn't come in the way. It is more like
Flask in Python. Thanks

Hi all,

Tamil Wikipedia crossed 50,000 article milestone on December 18th, 2012.

The first 1000 articles took 1 year and 11 months.

The last 25,000 articles were created in just 2 years and 2 months !

You can find the growth captured in the graph at

http://ta.wikipedia.org/s/3ys

During the last few months, we focused on clean up, improving article
quality and creating most important articles listed at

Dear Lakshman,


Can you please provide me information on hardware can be purchased?

I am thinking about buying Dongle E1550 [ 2]  for gsm_open initially and If
I am correct buy a FXO port for landline and setup freeswitch for our small
setup.

Can you suggest me if my current plan would work good for a very small call
center support function?

Such a simple thing but in the UNIX you don't have a progress bar for
copying files.

There are two ways to solve this issue:

1) rsync -P <src> <dst>

2) pv <src> > <dst>
(ex: pv bigfile.img > /tmp/f.img)

Subject: [Ilugc] More perl and CGI
Message-ID: <CALDskyxTKDkARmhVVLjAbPAuM0McicxQh=1Fp4zGMmztsGW-8A@mail.gmail.com>

CGI and perl have always enjoyed a nice marriage.

I find it incredibly easy to do simple things over the web.

You need glue code with jQuery and javascript browser frontend to go with it.

Most cases don't even require that.

We saw how to obtain dynamic output from CGI and perl last time.

Now we will see how to obtain user input and process it.

That will be nice.

Simple DB query, search, e-mail sending and feedback processing, quizzes,
 ratings, simple interfaces all depend on this.

Let us look at something from the CGI.pm man page itself.

You must get into the habit of looking at man pages and the examples in them
 to get started.

Reading man pages and making sense takes lot of experience, patience
and knowledge.

No other reference is good. You have to count on web and man pages...

Here is the sample:

# cat ilugsample.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl

 use CGI qw/:standard/;
          print
              header,
              start_html('Simple Script'),
              h1('Simple Script'),
              start_form,
              "What's your name? ",textfield('name'),p,
              "What's your relationship with LUG?",
              checkbox_group(-name=>'words',

-values=>['casual','serious','student','entrepreneur']),

              p,"What's your favorite OS?",
              popup_menu(-name=>'color',
                         -values=>['Linux','Windows','Mac','Other']),p,
              submit,
              end_form,
              hr,"\n";

           if (param) {
              print
                  "Your name is ",em(param('name')),p,
                  "Your relationships are: ",em(join(", ",param('words'))),p,
                  "Your favorite OS is ",em(param('color')),".\n";
           }
           print end_html;

And see it work here:

Subject: [Ilugc] perl again
Message-ID: <CALDskyzNiFot6R3NzMYUy5UarUT5jX1XU8VD2L7g4P2zLN-ucg@mail.gmail.com>

More and more perl.

Perl stands for practical extraction and reporting.

It was written by Larry Wall, JPL programmer. Tcl was written by John
Ousterhout and Python by
 Guido von Rossum.

Lua was created in Brazil. It is used in gaming, embedded systems, has
a very easy interface to C
 and is an amazing language. But unfortunately I am yet to learn it.

Perl is tougher to learn since it is tightly tied to UNIX and genius
in a lot of ways.

One requires a deep appreciation of computers, algorithms, protocols,
OS and so on to make good
 use of it.

In a lot of ways Perl is like UNIX.

Let us consider some code to find a file.

Use the file command right?

No.

You can of course evoke shell commands from inside perl using,

backticks, '`' or system() or exec() or readpipe().

But you have functions for grep, basename and so on inside perl itself.

So find is done by reading:

$ perldoc File::Find

File::Find(3p)         Perl Programmers Reference Guide         File::Find(3p)

NAME
       File::Find - Traverse a directory tree.

SYNOPSIS
           use File::Find;
           find(\&wanted, @directories_to_search);
           sub wanted { ... }

           use File::Find;
           finddepth(\&wanted, @directories_to_search);
           sub wanted { ... }

           use File::Find;
           find({ wanted => \&process, follow => 1 }, '.');

DESCRIPTION
       These are functions for searching through directory trees doing work on
       each file found similar to the Unix find command.  File::Find exports
       two functions, "find" and "finddepth".  They work similarly but have
       subtle differences.

Refer to man for more details.

Copy paste examples and have fun.

Subject: [Ilugc] Some shell scripting
Message-ID: <CALDskyxbFrht=S4NKwAm+Untm8-gi5a3m7y5PWjJRBS=5pr2kg@mail.gmail.com>

I was reading the OpenBSD install script for something and I found
that the simple pdksh script
 itself was somewhat ...complex.

So if you want to write cool software shell scripting is not a bad idea.

I have written commercial installers for products in 2003 in shell.

That was in Sun Solaris.

The advantage shell scripts have over perl scripts is that with shell
you have all the UNIX toolkit programs
 along with even C code you write for use.

But with perl that is bit hard.

Also you have progress bar software in shell like pv and you can write
install scripts
 with other constructs like grep and sed and cut.

Which is what I used to do.

You could also use expect(1) or even perl.

I will send examples later. For enumeration I use jot on OpenBSD.

On Linux you use seq.

I have a spreadsheet that needs to be worked on by everyone in the
team (Max. 30 people). Most of the time, people tend to leave the
sheet open thereby making it on a read only mode.

If I could get a macro that would close the sheet if its inactive for
more than 5 seconds it would be great (similar to timer function in
excel).

Example vba for MS Excel is here.

In Mumbai, the Lamington Road market has quite a few refurbished/used
re-sellers.  The situation must be similar in Chennai.  Do a survey of
the market and ask.   Beware, it is not always possible to get what
you want.

The type of CPU you are looking for is still  in "active" use in most
companies.   Try your luck with the big vendors or institutions that
lease systems; they may have restocked "out of lease" systems.

OO/LO has scripting capability.   Way back, I had contracted a
developer to write a macro for OO.
Have you investigated scripting for OO/LO [1]?

Something similar can be written for OO/LO.  Also search for MSO macro
to OO/LO converter - beware YMMV.

You do simple programming constructs using ksh like this:

$ cat sample.sh
#!/bin/ksh

echo -n "Please enter a number:"
read n
echo "You entered $n"

echo "Do you want to square it? Y/N"
read res
if [ $res = "Y" ]; then
    square=`expr $n \* $n`
     echo "Square of $n is $square"
else
       echo "Bye"
fi

You can move on to really feature rich scripts.

Basic looping is provided by the pleasant for() construct which is
 very different from the C for.

It is also found in perl.

Let us see a sample.

$ looping

for f in `ls /etc/*`
do
            echo "$f"
             type=`file $f`
            echo "$f is of type $t"
done

Please note that I use backticks '`" which is the same key as ~.

~ is called as tilde and ` is known as backquote or backtick.

You use the latter for evaluating shell expressions.

t='date'
t="date"
are both useless. ;)

t=`date`

is useful...

Hi,

On KSH and Bash, you can as well use
        square=$((n * n))
and avoid the overhead of expr command. The above construct 
is called arithmetic expansion. At the shell prompt, you could 
also do something like:
   $ echo $(( (100000 + (100000 * 0.1236)) - (100000 * .103) ))
for basic math, without rushing to your handy calculator.

Not really. There's a 'for loop' with C-like syntax on KSH93 and Bash:
for ((i=0; i<10; i++))
{
      echo $i
}

And this works well for 'counting' for loops.

>  $ looping

Yet another useless use of 'ls' command. You could've used
     for f in /etc/*

    [snip]

You must avoid using back-tick (`) for command substitution
on all POSIX compliant shells - it lacks readability and cannot 
be nested. Use $(command) instead. 

You might also want to brush-up on basics of shell scripting 
and keep a good tutorial/reference handy before your next post
on the topic :-)

Slackware Linux installer and package management tools and 
the plethora of rc scripts on most Linux distros do still use 
shell scripts.

Most modern Linux distros however use systemd or upstart 
instead of old rc-style shell scripts for performance and 
scalability reasons. The installers of most modern Linux 
distros are either based on Python or Ruby scripts for 
maintainability and scalability reasons.

That was back in the '90s. Today, shell scripting is a *very* bad idea 
if portability, maintainability and performance are concerned. Shell
scripting is not recommended for anything greater than a 10 line
script. For anything bigger and complex than that - you should 
use Python, Ruby or any other modern scripting language instead.

That's why Larry Wall created perl so that you do not have to 
depend on 'C code'  (binary executable programs) of your 
underlying system. Try porting a sophisticated shell script 
from Solaris to OpenBSD or Linux and you'll understand why 
shell scripting is a bad idea for writing medium-to-large scale 
programs.

Shell and old generation Perl emphasize glue-scripting (gluing 
together other programs written largely in C/C++) mainly because
they lacked features on their own. Today, things are different. 
Modern scripting languages (Python, Ruby and also Perl) are 
full-featured and glue-scripting today can be fully avoided except
for a few one-liners.

In the year 2009 I think unless I am mistaken I had a two day seminar
on the 11th and
12th of September in IITM.

Lot of people including Prof. Ashok Jhunjhunwala put in their share of
the work/expenses and
 I prepared for more than 9 months.

Such elephantine efforts in future will become easier mainly due to my
enhanced standing
 , knowledge and access to money/people.

However in case I come up with an idea like that I shall avail the
services of people like
 you.

But in my experience the best way to serve my country and do good to
the world at large
 is by creating an international brand like Zohocorp.

If God wills that will happen.

I don't have to worry about it.

If it is destined to happen it will surely happen.

I differ, If you consider Gentoo is a modern distro, then your statement
is wrong. Gentoo as well as its childs still use openRC, not
systemd/upstart.

I still differ, People who want performance don't consider Python/Ruby.
A careful design can make scalability easier by writing it in C and do a
glue-scripting, rather than Ruby/Python.

I'm not an architect who can talk about scalability/performance of a big
or enterprise level application, just an amateur programmer, but in my
opinion, whatever complex the problem, a well defined split-up and
writing tools for each split can scale whatever level we want.

Want a proof? just look at git. It doesn't suck!! because it was not
written in Python/Ruby, its a bunch of C programs which can be used as
commands in bash (as well as in any language). what you say about this?
with your so called Python/Ruby scalability?

Just my opinion, it doesn't mean, all applications in the world should
be written in C. but, I'm saying beautiful applications are all written
in C.

When we talk performance, let's talk about what exactly we mean by it. Most
applications are never bottlenecked on the CPU and are most of the time
waiting for I/O. In such cases, the so-called "overhead" of running a
dynamic language like perl/python/ruby far outweighs the drawbacks. Writing
good code in C is probably twice as hard as writing good code in perl (and
probably 10x as hard as writing good code in python / ruby).

By "good", I mean, maintainable, readable and modular code.

That said, when it comes to shell there is one problem I've faced a lot:
Since shell scripts leverage external utilities (like cat/sort/cut/etc.,)
that can be realized only after a 'fork()' and since most people today
prefer to run stuff on VMs, the performance of fork system call on certain
VM hosts is unpredictable and bad. Sometimes it may take several seconds
for a seemingly harmless process like cat to instantiate.

git is a fairly limited and well defined problem area that involves mostly
string manipulation. Also, its open source (and open source software
quality _usually_ is better than enterprise grade software, IMHO). Consider
something more complex and event driven, like your typical enterprise grade
HTTP application that is under a constant pressure of meeting deadlines and
people whose, shall we say, social conditioning is not necessarily wired
for the most elegant solutions but instead for those that just work and
those that give them recognition in their social circle (read: "career").

Also, if the script is being invoked from inside a login shell, then there
is a bright chance the 'ls' will be aliased (I usually alias my ls to show
file size) and this will fail in weird ways.

I used the word "Most"; not "All". Gentoo, Slackware and a couple of 
other distros do not use systemd or upstart yet. Having said that, 
on Gentoo today, systemd is just an 'emerge' away.

Wrong. People who want performance prefer Perl/Python/Ruby or the likes in
comparison to C programs + Shell. It is obvious that you have no first hand
exposure at maintaining a 25,000+ line shell script (which I did in the late
90s) - so you have no clue on what I'm talking about.

As an exercise, try writing a Linux installer and package manager with 
features and capability of Redhat's installer (anaconda) and their package
manager (RPM/YUM) using just shell scripts and existing bare-bones
Linux tools (tar, cpio, bzip2, etc). You'll understand immediately why 
people chose Python/Ruby over shell :-)

I am a technology mentor - and I train architects on how software must
not be built in the first place. I can talk at length about scalability
modelling. 

In the 80s and early 90s, traditional UNIX paradigms emphasized on 
splitting complex problems into smaller problem sets that could be 
addressed by carefully written tools and utilities in C and then 
glued-up together using the shell (just like LEGO(tm) building blocks). 
This worked well during at that time. 

But the problem with shell is in its architectural design - it was never
meant for solving complex problems - the overhead of forking multiple
process (to run different programs), its lack of built-in functions
for rich data-types (hashes, objects, resizable vector-based arrays) and
algorithms (map, reduce, sort, search), and its extensive dependency 
on external tools and commands (like cut, grep, sed, etc) for trivial 
tasks makes it slower, unintuitive and unattractive for solving 
"complex" problems. 

Today, we have a better design - rather can creating hundreds and 
thousands of binary programs using C, we have most performance-critical
and low-level functions written in C and bundled into libraries. And we 
use smart programming languages like Python/Ruby/Perl that wrap these 
libraries as extension modules. That's how Python/Ruby/Perl perform better 
and are more scalable. For example, a python program made up of 
Python + C library extension is a lot faster than a shell script made up 
of Shell + C program binary (as there is no fork-dup-exec involved in 
the former). 

>  Want a proof? just look at git. It doesn't suck!! 

Git doesn't suck as long as you are happy with what it provides. 
There's very little scope for customizability here. Every time I tried 
implementing a workflow radically different from what git provides, 
I end up yelling out what Git really meant - "Goddamn IdioT" (as per 
Linus Torvalds, the creator) and move on to mercurial.

And that's why it is rigid, non-flexible and expects you to learn umpteen
commands to manage your source code eventually. 

> what you say about this? with your so called Python/Ruby scalability?

Mercurial is written fully on Python and it is way more scalable and fully
customizable than Git. For example, writing trigger rules for mercurial
expects you to only know python and mercurial library interface. 
In comparison, git expects you to know umpteen commands, shell and a 
plethora of not-so-portable utilities like inotify on Linux - that's not 
what you call scalable.

Mercurial has proven to be much faster than git for large-scale commits
and I have personally benchmarked both myself on server deployments. 
For your reference, look up the following link: 
   http://draketo.de/proj/hg-vs-git-server/test-results.html

Ubuntu community folks will tell you how bazaar is as fast as (or better 
than) git - and that's written in Python too. The beauty of well-designed
software lies in its extensibility to solve problems pertaining to the user
domain.

Lesson for you: merely writing an "application" in C does not make it any 
faster. In most cases, it is counter-productive as it does not emphasize
reusability. Good software design principles revolve around using C/C++ 
to address problems related to system domain - that could be extended as 
libraries by programs written in Python/Ruby/Perl/Haskell/Java or any 
high-level language that allows application developers to focus on problems
related to user domain.

And yes, get this out of your mind that C is all about "high performance".
Performance, Scalability, Maturity and Maintainability depends *not* on your
choice of programming language - but rather the software design and 
architecture.

Beautiful applications can be written in any language - Ksh, C, C++,
Java, Python, LISP, Ruby, anything. Right design and right tools for the 
right job is what matters. 

As another exercise for you, try solving the algorithm problems on 
http://projecteuler.net/problems using C (with standard C libraries of 
course). Then, try looking up solutions for the same problems solved

In return don't ask us to demonstrate an OS kernel developed using

Good point. BTW, the original code snippet posted by OP will not work
as `ls /etc` will only return list of file names and not expand to their full
path.

The most common mistakes by amateur shell script programmers are
unnecessary usage of 'ls' and 'cat' commands in their scripts.

Kind of a response benchmarking which proved that hg is better.

Just one question? did the test used python+Subprocess.call() for all
the git call's?

I thought libgit.a is there (or better http://libgit2.github.com/) which
prevents fork-exec. However, the test is talking about gc. So, my point
doesn't count as a valid argument. But I'm just wondering the test is
comparing things which are not in the same level,

If the entire test performed by doing python+hg-with-api and python
+git-via-subprocess.call()/bash+git-commands, then I'll say, the test is
biased towards hg. Well, you can ask "the test is all about garbage
collection, what the hell you are talking about?" well, may be git has
some problem with gc, but I'm saying there is something fishy the way
the test has been performed.

Aahh!! the same old (or modern) advice. Common pundits, I'm not saying C
is the only way and I really say python/javascript is way better on text
processing, no doubt on that, its my personal experience. But saying C
and shell-scripting doesn't belongs to the modern programming is utter
shit.

Well, I'm solving my own day-to-day problems with C
http://github.com/mohan43u/ the same problems can be solvable much
easier in other languages, but whats the point of solving my problems in
easier way? I'm not a corporate with deadlines. Programming is fun after
all :)

Well, beautiful, depends on one's view. I would say thorn is beautiful
than the rose (this is a counter post right? obviously I have to post
like this. sorry for wasting you time).

This code will fail miserably if the directory contains file name with 
spaces. One solution could be is to play with IFS variable.

 Nginx is an open source Web server and a reverse proxy server

Nginx can deploy dynamic HTTP content on a network using
FastCGI, SCGI handlers for scripts, uWSGI application servers

 Nginx uses an asynchronous event-driven approach to handling

approach can provide more predictable performance under high loads

Using screen or tmux inside putty and you will never have to worry about

multiple terminals mess when working with multiple servers 
simultaneously. Once you are into screen multiplexers then you will 
forget about relying on bare bones putty.

The problem is only with setting the number of lines which can scroll with
a single turn of a mouse scroll wheel.

Prior to Ubuntu - a couple of distros had a similar setup. IIRC
Xandros/Linspire had Click-N-Install.

IMO, it's target audience are the non-geek users and so be it.

The geeks have the option of dpkg, apt-*, aptitude, synaptic.

Toool of the Day: Netdisco

 Netdisco is a network management application targeted at
large corporate and university networks.Data is collected into
a Postgres database using SNMP and presented with a clean
web interface using Mason. Designed for moderate to large
networks, configuration information and connection data for
network devices are retrieved by SNMP.

 With Netdisco we can locate the switch port of an end-user
system by IP or MAC address. Data is stored using a SQL
database for scalability and speed. Layer-2 topology protocols
such as CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol) optionally provides
automatic discovery of the network topology

Subject: [Ilugc] starting lua series
Message-ID: <CALDskyzNqveuiZc_ge=hof8fx+p4vhX4dk4YzNEpc0M8bh1aVw@mail.gmail.com>

I did not get time to do justice.

So this is something. We will get better with time.

You can Google for lua but you cannot know much about it easily.

It is fairly niche still.

I also dunno whether it is being used in India.

Let us look at our first program.

$ cat first.lua
for i=1,20 do
        print("We are on loop " .. i.. "\n");
end

This will print numbers from 1 to 20.

All loops end with "end" keyword.

In shell we have

for ...
do
done

In lua we have

for do
end

Similarly for functions too.

Let us look at our second lua code.

$ cat sec.lua
function testfunc(x,y)
        return x * y;
end

t=testfunc(2,3)

print(t)


We have learnt how to use functions, how to assign and print. ;)

We will also see the most important construct in lua, tables.


$ cat tbl.lua
mytbl = { "Girish", "is", "here", "wasting", "time"}

for i=1,#mytbl do
        print(mytbl[i])
end
$ lua tbl.lua
Girish
is
here
wasting
time

Lua tables are just like perl's hash tables or associative arrays or
dictionaries in python.

In lua however tables are a very very powerful construct.

We will see them later.

Sorry for this half baked beginning.

I promise to do justice in time.

Message-ID: <CALDskyx3tTktGTUVje_L-pM=bn8aZQtAURcKErTQjU8KK3t=XA@mail.gmail.com>

It is self explanatory if you think a bit...

$ cat fr.lua

file = io.read("*all");

print("I read the whole file")

print("Converting the file to upper case and writing")

o = string.lower(file)

print("Method 1:")

io.write(o)

print("Method 2:")
file:lower()

io.write(o)

I will explain tomorrow after you do your testing and thinking.

Message-ID: <CALDskyzma5mFdRrHu5mcm-WzRjms_-iWPD+tk60M5Dzvikia_Q@mail.gmail.com>

My first love impression with lua is that
it is quite expressive, pithy, has C like economy of expression and neat syntax.

Kind of reminds me of jQuery also.

I think this will also become elitist like Perl rather than somewhat
common like Python.

Or maybe it will lie in between.

But it is pleasant and nice.

I will have a better idea when I hack lua for more than 1 year.

I will post to LUG then.

This is my tomorrow in case you are reading this from India. ;)

Anyway you run this code like this:

$ lua fr.lua < /tmp/somefile.txt

This is important. If you just give the file name it will wait and do nothing.

This code will convert the file into lower case and print in two different ways.

Lua like python has plenty of string manipulation functions built into
the standard
 library itself.

Lua has excellent support for perl like modules and already people have made
available several Lua Rocks which you can use.

I hope to write one within a year or so.

The way I see it, lua has several built in conveniences of python or
Tcl and other
 scripting languages, it has the power and depth of perl being so
closely melded with
 C.

In the next few weeks we will naturally be able to see its power and beauty.

I find it quite boring that I cannot spot the os interface for several
functions that
 are common in languages.

C API like

pwd
chroot
copy
move

and so on are missing.

Or I am not looking properly.

There is however a os.execute().

Anyway we will get there step by step.

You are right, you are not using the gmail interface.

info@ is a commonly used ID. Try some other.

Huh?

Are you suggesting that some other user id should work?   If so, how?

Besides postfix, you must have also setup a POP3/IMAP server like
dovecot?

I am intrigued that GMail is actually sending out the messages for
'example.com'  and your server receiving it (see below).

$ host -t mx example.com
example.com has no MX record

>From my Gmail account, I have sent a message to "test at example.com"
expecting a bounce.   But to my surprise no bounce; apparently it goes
into a bit bucket somewhere in the internet (or so it seems).

To the best of my understanding, you need to set up a DNS server for
'example.com' that resolves the MX record to your SMTP server pointing
to your server.   Since you do not own 'example.com', setting up
'example.com' in your internal LAN is one of the ways it can be
achieved.

I have done this for testing email server setup in my LAN and it works
fine - only caveat I need to use another 'internal LAN' SMTP server to
communicate with the example.com server.  Both servers use the
internal DNS server for example.com.

Although you have given information about your setup, it is not clear
where your email server is located (WAN or LAN).

Without a topology of your setup, it is not possible to help.

Then you mislead us all by giving example.com as the domain!

$ host -t mx zhivu.com
zhivu.com has no MX record

How to you expect any email delivery w/o a proper MX record for your domain?

Strongly suggest to read up DNS basics and ensure that your domain has
at least one MX record.
