Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl beginning
Message-ID: <CALDskywie7Zpp5EJUVzxVL_HZJk02P99-G11iEWDe+g3Mymu8A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have intermittent Internet access. Hence the absence of tips on the days
 I am unavailable.

I shall try to fix this problem.

Since we have seen a little bit of javascript, jQuery and CGI I think
we should revisit this
later. It is not possible to learn everything at one go.

Today I am starting perl training. Since I am not very good at Python
I will send tips in python later
 to improve my skills in that. ;)

Anyway let us begin with some history and background of perl.

This will also put you on a good footing to attend my perl class on
the 18th of this month at TalentSprint
 Royappetah.

Simply put Perl is a scripting language, an interpreted language and
it began with a  focus on CGI and
text processing in the UNIX world.

Today we find perl being used in all OSes but it is primarily a UNIX
thing and has very strong leanings towards
 UNIX geeks, IPC and UNIX internals than Python.

Is this is the reason people in India prefer Python over perl? I dunno.

I cannot answer that.

At least in LUG, the perl knowledge seems woefully poor.

Anyway perl is an interpreted language. Which means that the perl
source and executable are the same.

But that does not mean that we cannot compile perl.

$ perl -c first.pl

will tell you whether the compilation phase of perl is successful.
This is very nice.

We can identify a lot of bugs that way. Also the

$ perl -w

switch and the

use strict;

in the perl source code helps us debug further.

Now let us look at a hello world.

#!/usr/bin/perl

print "Hello world\n";

$ perl -c first.pl

$ perl first.pl

will execute it and print it.

Now, perl has mainly 3 data types, scalars, arrays and associative
arrays/dictionary/hash.

Unlike shell scripts and makefile variables, perl always requires a
variable to be prefixed with one of
 $, @ or # before it.

Even when assigning a value.

For example, in shell we say,

Var=1
echo $Var

But in perl we say

$var=1;
print $var;

And remember every line in perl needs to have a  semicolon.

And though it looks like C, you cannot have an if condition without a {}.

However perl does allow this;

print "no match" if($var ne 10);

This looks like English. Perl has this construct.

But you cannot do this;

if($var ne 10)
           print "no match";

Even single line statements need to go inside curly braces.

So let us look at a slightly complicated example before calling it a day.

$cat second.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
my ($first, $second) = ();

$first = "something";
$second=2;

print "The value of first is $first\n";

print "The value of second is $second\n";


We will see more in due course. Stay tuned.

I have been using SuSE Linux since 1996 for my servers and have been a
happy user.  I was evaluating 12.1 from RC1 stage for desktop and it
was stable.

I installed 12.1 RC1 on a brand new laptop (i5-2430, 4GB RAM, Intel
GPU, WiFi, BT, card reader etc.) and all devices work out of the box
w/o the need for downloading BLOB drivers.  I upgraded to 12.1
released version as soon it was available on the mirrors.

On the desktop end I am happy with it.

However, if you want to use 12.1 on the server side - a few words of
caution.   I was an early adopter on the server side as well but
reverted back to 11.4.

There are quite a few issues, mostly related to the switch from System
V init to Systemd init.  Change to System V init, if you must use 12.1
on the server side.  See openSUSE mailing list archives for issues
with 12.1.    Plan to open bug reports on the breakage I have
experienced.

My 10 paise.

I am using Digilite's  DL425 Intel Atom board (mini-ITX FF).  It does
have a fan for the CPU; the noise is almost not perceptible.   For the
case you can use iBall "Netbook" cabinet; it does come with a small
fan but does not create much noise.  You can see the cabinet at iBall
web site.  You can visit panache.co.in for smaller and more glamorous
cabinets but expect to pay around Rs. 3K.  It is your choice.

Mumbai price estimate would be around Rs. 5500 for the
board+memory+cabinet (iBall).  TN cost would be in the same ball park.

You can PXE boot it or use a thin client firmware.  I have done some
eval with Thinstation.net but not quite happy with resolution of the
fonts and icons.

Then be ready to pay extra bucks for some one else to do it for you;
be it a thin client vendor or a consultant who can do your setup with
off the shelf hardware (see above).

How important is it to you for a fan less solution?  The above
solution works me, especially, when I don't have to call the vendor to
fix it and loose 2 or more days in the process.

Not just India, world over, perl is not as widely used as, say, Java or
Python because perl, for writing anything significant, requires mastery
over the language's internals. Without experience and/or careful thought,
one can completely ruin or make one's code horribly difficult to maintain
if they don't know what they're doing with perl.

But that is fast changing - with Moose (and other emergent frameworks built
on top of Moose (like Catalyst MVC framework)), perl is now an extremely
fast paced environment.

At least in LUG, the perl knowledge seems woefully poor.

"%" is used to prefix hash variables, not "#". But I can totally understand
how that freudian slip happened :)

Correct. It requires heavy investment like UNIX. I agree.

I dunno why. I never liked Catalyst and I am sure I won't like Moose either.

I am just comfortable with plain old perl with the hand. I might be a
luddite. Well.

Sorry.

I have become very lazy and I was in a bad mood in the morning.

Anyway the # character is the comment character in perl, config files
and shell scripts. ;)

Though your comment is correct I think in this particular case I am right.

Perl certainly is very UNIX focused unlike Python.

Now don't catch my neck. ;)

Is it possible to browse internet from browser using the proxy settings?
If so, the proxy/firewall admin may blocked the ping.

try an console based browser like lynx or links.

lynx http://google.com

I managed MediaWiki's participation in Google Summer of Code this year,
and could talk with anyone interested in participating, anyone
researching it, and anyone who is curious.  :-)  We try to document our
participation on mediawiki.org wiki pages.  Some useful resources:

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code

For some quantitative analysis of our past participation, Max Semenik's
analysis page:

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:MaxSem/GSoC_analysis

The four Indian students from this year's participation were Devayon
Das, Yuvi Panda, Akshay Agarwal, and Ankit Garg.  You can read more
about this year's participants at:

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code_2011

But of course there are about 170 other organizations that participated
in Google Summer of Code this year.  Our experience might differ from
some of theirs.

Any student who is interested in applying to GSoC next year: now is a
good time to start learning about MediaWiki so you'll have a good
proposal when the application time comes in the spring!  You can start
with this guide:
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/How_to_become_a_MediaWiki_hacker .  And
of course I'm happy to give help.

In a corporate setup, the port used for ping is usually blocked in the firewall.

If you couldn't get lynx installed, try "links" or "wget". infact wget
would be easier, as you can set the proxy settings easily through the
command line.

For lesser beings, like me, who are stuck with M$, with no
links/lynx/wget/ping, what we do is this:

telnet <server> <port>

if there is a proxy inbetween

telnet <proxy> <port>
and then use it to connect to the actual term. (WGET is far easier)

Hi all,

Is there any Skype for Ubuntu 8.10 ?

Or atleast let me know of any instance of working Skype in any Ubuntu version.

The Skype download page does not list Ubuntu 8.10.

Thanks,

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl tutorial 0
Message-ID: <CALDskyxzF4LQq9BCiDRP51TgmaN__nKOf-OhiMZDKw3v9N98HA@mail.gmail.com>

There was some comparison with Python yesterday.

Though perl is not as good as python in many ways for some reason perl
has a very strong developer community around it. It has
got a certain way to obtain copious documentation in UNIX man page format.

Perl has CPAN(www.cpan.org) which is integrated into the standard distribution.

The sheer energy and force behind perl seems enormous. No other
language has enjoyed
 such sheer patronage. Not C, not java,not even php.

And perl's UNIX focus lies in its manpage format for documentation
unlike python's help(<module>)
 style, though every language has OS bindings perl is a direct copy
when it comes to regex, its
 IPC and so on. It is nothing but UNIX in a new flavor.

Today we will see some more examples.

$ cat 0.pl
-------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl

$scalar1 = "This is a string scalar";

@arr = (1,2,3,5, "string1", "one more", $scalar1);

%h = ("key1" => 6, "key2" => 10);

print "The array is @arr\n";

for(keys %h) {
          print "key is $_, value is $h{$_}\n";
}
-------------------------------------------------------

I will explain the above code.

We have seen scalars yesterday. All scalars start with $ and hold
singular values.

If you want to store a list of values you require arrays that start
with the @ character.

Then we see the hash which starts with the % and it uses the same
assignment style.

Meaning that we use (...) to assign values to the hash.

This is because hash is also an array. Instead of numeric prefix it
uses named keys. That is
why it is called an associative array.

So it has exactly 1/2 of the array length.

This is because half of the assignment items go towards making the key
and half the values.

Hashes have no ordering. It is stored and retrieved in a different
order. So in order to use
 ordering we need to resort to the sort() function in perl.

We saw that the array can be printed just by enclosing the array in
double quotes(").

If you print it like this:

print @arr;

you will get the same result without the space between array elements.

This is a key feature of perl. Perl is context aware.

Depending on whether the lvalue is singular or plural(scalar or
array), the RHS will be assigned
 as the length of the RHS or the list in the RHS itself.

For instance, if you write,

$sca = (1,3,4,5);

You will see that $sca contains 4.

$ perl -e '$sca = (1,2,3,4); print $sca;'
4$

But if you do this:

@a = (1,2,3,4);

you will be able to assign the whole array.

This can trip many people, even experienced programmers. One can even
argue it is a bug.

For instance in many situations it will be obvious we want the entire
list but you won't get it
without resorting to () on the LHS.

Anyway we will get to that on a future date.

For now, the hash statement and the print in the above code is confusing.

%hashsample = (1, 100, 2, 200);

will get assigned as :

1 -> 100
2 -> 200

So,

$hashsample{1} = 100;
$hashsample{2} = 200;

Note the syntax. This will drive you mad initially. Perl uses a lot of
funny characters.

One more thing. Another confusing thing but you can say it is a feature.

You assign the hash like this also and get the same result.

%foo = (1 => 100, 2 => 200);

This is because => is an alias for ,.

Howzzat?

Anyway array values are accessed with [<index>] and hash values are
accessed with {$key}.

For example,

@a = (1,3, 10);

print "first value is $a[0]\n";

%foo = (1 => 100, 2 => 200);
print "hash content with key 1 is $foo{1}\n";

Since hash always contains scalars as keys and could contain anything
as value it is always one to one.

For instance you can hold an array or function pointer as value but it
has to be an array pointer.

So every time you access a hash value, it will be $hashname{$key};

The usage,
for(keys %h) {
          print "key is $_, value is $h{$_}\n";
}

will be explained tomorrow in iterators. This is the foreach() iterator.

Perl makes it very convenient to use array elements in a for loop.

More tomorrow.

I belive it is still in the repository. you can try apt-get or synaptic to
install it. I have not validated this in ubuntu, but its there in my mint,
which is based out of ubuntu.

Did it ever occur to you that it could have been an error, an accident. Or
do you have limitations appreciating

If you have made a mistake, apologize and move on. No point in asking 
these questions, every one knows it could be a human error.

perl is not as good as python? Good lord, I got not the time for this flame

perl's documentation is not in the manpage format. Perl's document is
written in the "POD" format (for "Plain Old Documentation"). It is possible
to obtain the documentation using perldoc (not man) and pod easily gives
way to turning the same documentation into any format. Yes, its a big
advantage, but its not "just" man pages. Given man's popularity and
familiarity, for the sake of convenience, some package maintainers choose
to also turn the pod documentation into man.

Could you please explain what you mean by "perl is a direct copy when it
comes to regex"?

Perl is a language with an interpreter on top of Unix-like OSes (and
windows and mac and many others including real-time embedded OSes). Perl is
not an OS. the OS is below perl and does all the hard-lifting, but perl, as
do all languages, attempts to let the programmer write an elaborate recipe
of achieving something by manipulating the OS underneath, without us having
to know about the internals (of interacting with the OS).

So it is confusing when you say that the driver is the vehicle, ie., perl
is the OS.

Oops.

Its not the length of the array. Its the last element in the array.

Everything requires a certain approach to learning, learning to deal with a
dog is very different from dealing with a dragon. But there are obvious
differences in end applications for the two. The question is whether you
have learnt that approach fully well and can explain the same to everyone.
It is not very helpful to make sweeping statements that only point out
problems without providing solutions.

I have a Samsung Galaxy and can confirm this is not present (I could not
see any running app by the names shown in video, nor any unstoppable third
party apps). Since Google builds of Android were shown not to contain this
and indications are that carriers are making OEMs add it, we in India are
safe, I guess. We generally don't have direct relationships between
carriers and phone companies, and use 'international edition' of phones.

May be people who got phones from carriers should check for this and post
here(iPhones and IIRC HTC Android was also released in partnership by
Airtel, Vodafone)

Hey,

Just download skype static(not dynamic).

It will just work out of the box.

The sounds will need some tweaking(install path) but it will
serve your purpose.

Check the mic, recording is a pain .

Otherwise it will work on any Linux.

But on Ubuntu perhaps installing the DEB would be the best idea in
 case you don't have dependency issues.

Subject: [Ilugc] US has become a dangerous place for software development:
	RMS
Message-ID: <4ED96309.1010203@gmail.com>

RT (Russia Today) yesterday conducted an interview with Richard M 
Stallman, the founder of Free Software Foundation and the writer of the 
world's most advance license GNU GPL. RT asked readers to ask questions 
and then they would pick questions for RMS.

http://www.muktware.com/news/3056

We asked two questions on RT's Facebook page and both those questions 
were presented to RMS.

Muktware: Do you think USA is becoming hostile to innovation and 
competition as the companies like Apple and Microsoft are gaming the system?
RMS: I have to point out that innovation is not my highest value. Human 
rights are my highest values. So I don't to get into the dialogue that 
treats innovation as a primary goal.

With software patents the US has become a dangerous place for software 
development, including innovative software development, because when a 
program is innovative, that means it has some new ideas in it. But it 
also has lots of well-known ideas in it. A large program combines 
thousands of ideas. So if you have some new ideas and you want to use 
them, in order to use them you have to combine them with a lot of other 
ideas that are well-known. And if you are not allowed to do that because 
those other ideas are patented, you can't use your new idea.

Muktware: How much control should the USA have over the Internet?
RMS: No more than anyone else. I don't think it will be safe to have any 
global control over the internet. because we could predict that that 
global control will work for the empire of the mega corporations and 
would attack human rights.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl tutorial I
Message-ID: <CALDskywaftLi1G-vype8wEp0JTUGBMqrn5kx0qoqf_5=daD+_g@mail.gmail.com>

Yesterday we saw some perl code/opinions and history of perl.

Today we will see more.

As I said perl grew up in the UNIX world with UNIX command line tools
and shell scripting
 ideas. You can even look at it as a shell scripting language on steroids.

As we go along you realize that if you know UNIX well already you are
well on way towards
 becoming a perl expert.

grep,tr,sort everything is also there in perl as functions.

$perldoc -f grep

And you can easily call shell executables using

$output = `grep girish /etc/passwd`;

system("rdate time-a.nist.gov");

or

exec("cp /etc/passwd /tmp");

Though you can have OS bindings and interactions with any language,
scripting or otherwise with perl
 the UNIX ideas are all over.

You can open a UNIX pipe just like you open a file.

Perl's modules provide you with functions that the shell commands do
without doing a fork(), exec() and
 calling  a shell executable which is very costly.

And contrary to what people think and believe perl only slightly
improved the regular expressions already
 used in the UNIX world in shell globbing and so on.

Look at man flex. You find nearly all the perl regex ideas.

And perl code is not really intuitive. It has its defects along with
its strengths.

But just like we have an inferior language like English which cannot
match up to Tamil whichever way you
 look at it, perl though not as great as others is popular, successful
and enjoys support.

So I use it , I spent time learning it and continue to use it.

Let us get back to explaining the foreach() array iterator from yesterday.

Before that few general comments about scripting and high level languages.

High level languages all consider the default type of a variable as a
string. Of course you have to
 quote them, but you don't have strong typing as in C.

In fact it is the weak typing of variables in which they can become
integers or strings depending on the
 context that make scripting languages so easy to deal with.

Scripting languages also make several difficult things easy. Due to
perl's strong UNIX affiliation you can
 do a lot of things you have been doing in the UNIX world using pipes
and various command line tools more
efficiently in a better programming language like perl.

And network programming and many cool things that C does perl can too.
Without the difficulty and pain.

It has object orientation and is a very good OO language unlike C++ or
Java. Perl give many choices and
 as I said, in typical UNIX style, it is very well documented, it has
accurate example code in the man pages
 and the CPAN modules/third party libraries are of very high quality.

Overall we get a very pleasant experience with perl.

As part of these multifaceted conveniences and powers, we also have
what is called as array iterators.

This is also found in shell scripts and certainly in languages like
Python which has advanced forms of the same idea.

For instance, instead of using for() loops like in C for iterating
thro' array elements, we say

foreach $var (1,2,4,5,100) {
         print $var . "\n";
}

Or this:

for $var (1..100) {
        print $var . "\n";
}

It is very similar to the shell scripting concept:

for var in `cat /tmp/file`
do
         echo $var
done

See?

These are called iterators.

We also see two more of perl's superb features.

One is the range operator. 1..20 to print numbers from 1 to 20. Cool.

You can use them anywhere we want.

And the string concatenation operator ".".

$o = "first " . "second" . "third";

will simply add the three strings(strcat() in C).

Then you have another great feature.

$foo = "imposition " x 40;

will write the string "imposition" for you 40 times.

Okay we have seen enough explanation and English till now.

>From tomorrow we focus only on code samples.

I will illustrate whatever I have been trying to say in English so far.

>From Wikipedia author Karthik Nadar

On the day a terrorist attack ripped through the heart of my city,
Wikipedia changed my life.

The 2011 bombings in Mumbai made international headlines, but at the
moment the crisis struck, there was no straightforward information
about what had happened.

I knew I couldn?t be the only one looking for answers. So I went out
to take photos, uploaded a map I pasted together, and made sure the
Wikipedia article on the incident would help people make sense of the
chaos.

Since then, I?ve made thousands of edits to Wikipedia articles. My
experience that day on Wikipedia made my passion for photojournalism
clear, and I?ve followed that path ever since.

I felt so grateful for Wikipedia, and when I learned how it stays
online, I donated 250 rupees to do my part. Will you make a donation
to keep this valuable resource available around the world?

Wikipedia enables us to share the world. With 470 million different
visitors every month, it?s revolutionized the way we consume and
spread information -- sometimes even down to the moment it happens.

And it does it all for free -- with zero ads, under 1,000 servers and
fewer than 100 staff.

That?s amazing. Just look at Google or Facebook. They have hundreds of
thousands of servers and tens of thousands of staff.

It?s no wonder Wikipedia is the 5th most popular and most visited site
online. And it?s also no wonder why they need support every year from
people like me and you.

Will you pitch in $5, $20, $50 or whatever you think Wikipedia is worth to
you?

Thanks,

Karthik Nadar

How are you saying this? From my understanding Java's primary design goal
was to ease the implementation from OO design and in the begining Perl was
to kludge error reporting. For example, the concept of private is not
explicit in Perl.

Message-ID: <CALDskyw5hm-CrwH77H_x7L2boxwtiM-8cJDggqUhDzfajjN0RQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am really not competent to talk about OO since Object Oriented
programming is not something
 I am excited about.

The only language in which I have used it is in Perl. And in CGI I use
it a lot without actually knowing
 that I use OO at all.

It does not force one to think much, it is not pedagogical and
abstruse or confusing. It just gets your job done.

So we may have a lot of subjective arguments here. Essentially my
point was that in lower level languages
 like C++ and Jave and other OO focused languages OO becomes very
involved and difficult(at least for me).

But in perl it is nice and simple.

But you have to read a lot and the information is scattered in several
different man pages.

$perldoc perlobj

$ perldoc perlboot

$perldoc perltoot

$perldoc perlbot

and so on.

Also

$ perldoc perlmod

In the case of perl object orientation is implemented using the module
and package concept.

We will cover that later.

So all I am saying is that one can have any number of subjective views.

We should end up learning something useful that is all.

I think it will be impossible for me to remove opinion from fact or vice versa.

Please take my tips with a pinch of salt.

I don't think even wikipedia is free from prejudice.

So just live with it. ;)

just using classes and inheritance does not mean that you are using OOP.
And it is impossible to use OOP without actually knowing you are doing
so.

I'm assuming, by "It", you meant OOP in general.

I take it that your interest is in looking at perl as a way to have fun -
than "get job done". But, unfortunately, majority of the people, whether
hobby programmers or professionals who get paid to write code, want to get
"something done".

As a trainer, if you think perl is a good language for pedagogy, there are
more stricter languages like C that can help. If you're looking for
Abstruse/Confusing languages (I wonder, why though),  there are other more
esoteric languages: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_language

However, for getting your job done, it is incorrect to give the impression
that perl cannot be used for getting one's job done. Moose and modern
frameworks built around Moose bring object oriented features to perl in
many innovative ways.

I would partially agree with you that object oriented programming (the way
it is done in Java) makes it possible for anybody and everybody to "get
their job done" - which is also bad from the point of view of building
teams and organizations (very difficult to gauge one's programming /
analytical capabilities). Perl, that way, is a very useful tool for
filtering out and hiring the best. But due to its "kinda esoteric" nature,
there aren't as many perl programmers around as there are Ruby / PHP /
Python and... last but not the least, Java programmers. ;)




> But in perl it is nice and simple.

In some other languages, like Python, it is even more so. But, of course,
understanding OO in general helps than looking at "easy ways out" to do
something without learning about it.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl tutorial II (conditionals and looping)
Message-ID: <CALDskyxFCFBDFVPaPk-qm9GYB3ViH_GnX0TEyVMpOeJ-sXuc7Q@mail.gmail.com>

We will see conditionals and looping.

To begin with perl does not have the switch statement found in other languages.

There is also no break and continue. Instead you have last and next.

Most of perl's conditionals are written using the regex construct:

if(/\d/) {
} elsif(/\w/) {
}

Here is a complete example.

$ cat i.pl
$users = 'foo,boo';

if($users =~ /\d/) {
        print "digits\n";
} elsif($users =~ /\w/) {
        print "alnum\n";
}


Regular expressions are usually acted upon the default $_ special variable.

So if(/\d/) actually means if($_ =~ /\d/).

Anyway now let us focus on the core conditionals and looping facilities in perl.

We have already seen the if() condition before.

We have also seen the foreach()/for() iterator.

for() is just an alias for foreach().

$ cat i.pl

foreach($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
        print $i . "\n";
}


Replace foreach with for and it will work the same.

We have seen the iterator idea already.

for $var (1 .. 100) {
          print $var . "\n";
}

Same thing can be written as

for(1..100) {
         print;
         print "\n";
}

Here we again see the default loop variable $_ working.

It is good not to focus on perl's tricks to begin with. Do things the
formal way.

We now have seen the if() conditional and the for() looping construct.

Of course we have while() and we can simulate switch statement too.

We will see that tomorrow.

That is not true. Like all conditionals, it depends on the program's
context... and program's context is entirely dependent on the programmer.

Good programmers don't use regexes for everything (especially "most
conditionals") because it makes it
   1. difficult for other programmers to sit through and figure out what
the regex is trying to do
   2. difficult to be precise, there could be many possible matches
   3. impossible to separate implementation logic from business logic
   4. (CPU-wise) expensive to do something that could have been better
designed with alternate, non-english based approaches

Regexes make for some shabby, unmaintainable code. Use regexes only when
absolutely necessary. For most machine-machine communication, there are
well defined data interchange formats than human language that needs "regex
parsing" (data interchange/serialization formats such as YAML, JSON, XML,
etc.,). For most human-machine communication, there are MVCs (like perl
Catalyst) that let you separate business logic from the data representation
and user interaction. You can still use regexes, but such frameworks
minimize your urge (as perl "scripters") to use regexes and other bad
practices.

More than raw language skills, good practices make good programmers.

Cheers,

Hi !
Is there a way to have Tamil Phonetic Typing in Fedora ? Just like Google's Tamil IME that we have for Windows platform. I looked for region and language settings -> keyboard layout options, and searched for Tamil phonetic keyboard layouts. But, none of the options there have phonetic typing for Tamil. 
I am using Fedora 16 ; 64 bit

If there is sufficient interest, I'd like to talk about "Producing and
recording music with Jack" in the _next_ meeting (not the Dec 10th one).

Description:
Jack is a Virtual Studio framework for GNU/Linux. It fits nicely with the
Unix philosophy of "Do one thing and do it right", allowing stand alone
applications to model and perform the role of real-world equivalent
instruments and devices while providing a robust platform to allow them to
work together in real time. Jack models a real studio - so people familiar
with studio technology will find it easy to relate to Jack. The Corollary
is that to get accustomed to producing / recording music wih Jack, it is
important to understand studio terminology.

There are patchbays and it is possible to 'connect' the output of one
virtual instrument / device to one or more. It is even possible to patch
the output of one application to itself to produce interesting end results.
There is even a global clock that controls all these instruments and let
them all start / stop / synchronize in tandem. You can pipeline audio
streams through effects processors, mix them, master them even over
multiple computers over netJack. Jack is cool and above all, it is Free
Software. Jack supports most high-end audio hardware out of the box and
copes with low end hardware pretty well.

An interesting tidbit: Jack project contributed to the Linux kernel's
real-time abilities significantly.

This talk will be a hands-on demo of Jack running the Hydrogen Drum
Machine, ZynAddSubFX Synthesizer (based on the many revolutionary hardware
synths), Qsynth (real-world sound samples based synth), RoseGarden (MIDI
recorder / sequencer), Seq24 (pattern based MIDI sequencer that can be used
as an Arpeggiator) and Ardour2 (Digital Audio Workstation with inbuilt
mixer and effects processor pipeline). There would be no feeling of a
"finished" sound without the many LADSPA plugins that make producing music
with GNU/Linux real and fun.

However, setting up jack can be a bit tricky. Though, in the recent months,
atleast the latest and greatest of Ubuntu makes jack work "almost" out of
the box.

This talk will mostly cover
1. the primitives of electronic music
2. how jack models the same.
3. setting up jack
4. a little jamming with jack!

What's needed?

- I will bring my laptop and a USB-MIDI cable
- need one of you to kindly find a keyboard with MIDI out (preferably not a
complex high-end MIDI controller that requires reading a 150 page manual :)
)
- need one of you to kindly find some sort of decent speakers (my laptop's
speakers don't work)


Duration: 60 minutes

About the speaker:
I'm a self taught music student for the past 7 years. I'm also a
self-taught student of computers and depend on computers to make a living.
I used to learn music (mostly carnatic and a bit of western) and had always
been looking for a means to use my GNU/Linux based computer to record and
learn. I'd always wanted a home-studio setup for the purpose of learning
and recording what I learn. Jack made it possible to finally make my dream
of setting up a home-studio come true. I expected to have "real" hardware
in my studio and I thought, what an expensive hobby that would be! but I
now have a "real" powerful desktop that costed me about 5-7 times lesser
than a "decent" entry-level hardware-based full studio setup.  I run
AVLinux 5.0 on my studio desktop where I only use it for the purpose of
producing and listening to music. Though there are a couple of other
alternatives, including Ubuntu Studio (which I tried a while ago and found
it not as out-of-the-box as AVLinux), Studio64 (tried, didn't even work
well), etc., that all bundle jack and the plethora of music software that
work with jack.

I think, we are comparing Apples and Oranges here.  (See below)

I beg to disagree here. Perl, C++ and Java were created for different
purposes/problem spaces. It would be better if we choose the right
tools for the right purpose. PERL/ C++ / Java have inbuilt libraries
and constructs for different purposes. So if in their solution space,
they find that "A" is very repetitive, they build a library/construct
for that. If PERL thinks "A" is not the problem, but "B" is, you get a
different building block in PERL. So, when you use PERL/Java/C++ you
should know what building blocks are available, and what aren't. Then
fill the gaps with your brains.

A house can be constructed using wood, clay, clay bricks, hollow block
bricks, steel and glass, etc... The problem is same. The solution
space is different. The problem that needs to be addressed by the
developer differs. He will have a different set of problems to solve
in each of the solution spaces.

As I said in one of my previous mails, A language is just a language.
Its your ideas that become programs. If I allow any North Indian
Politician to contest in elections in Tamil Nadu, would s/he not talk
a few words in Tamil? Frankly, its not very different in programming
languages.

Each language has its own nuances and abilities. A "good" programmer
will try to utilize the tools to the best possible extent.
//??????????? ???????? ??????//

>From a hiring perspective, am not sure why people are obsessed with
the mastery over the syntax of the languages. This also creates a
problem, when you frame a question that is applicable for PERL and not
very applicable for Java. We have to understand that programmers are
not a single breed. Everyone specializes/has interests in particular
areas.You can't compare a OS programmer, with a Game developer, with
an enterprise application developer, with a mashup developer (What is
a Mash up?). Am sure the Mashup developer would have the least clue of
what it takes to sort objects in Java/ Perl.

IMHO, the problem isn't with Java/Perl, its a problem with your
question paper / interview panel. As I said earlier, a language is
independent of analytical skills. Why not frame your questions in such
a way that they don't have to write programs, but provide you with
algorithms instead?

>> But in perl it is nice and simple.
Let me fix it for you, "But PERL is nice and simple " :-)

I think, I should have combined this statement in my other mail with
the subject - "Comparing programming languages".

In my definition, A good programmer is one who, with the given
circumstances, writes a code that optimizes readability, time and
space complexity and maintainability.

Anyone who tries to showoff their skills, by writing cryptic logic, is
surely a villain in my team.

There would be trade offs at some situations. For example, if you try
to look at the Kernel Source Code (Linux of course), there are a
few^H^H^H many places where the code is written in ASM. But, the
comments above it would give the "C" equivalent of the ASM code. That,
my friends is a one great programmer :-)

Agreed to every thing you say. Not sure where I gave you the impression
that perl, as a common ground for measuring language skills, is a good
filter. Measuring one's language skills is of use only for gauging if the
candidate might be useful to fulfill, also, the short term needs (which,
usually, is to maintain/extend/fix an already developed solution).
Measuring based on language skills is of only a cosmetic use from the point
of view of hiring a long-term asset for a company. I didn't mean to say
perl is "syntactically tough" or somesuch and hence its a good tool for
interviews. Nope. I only meant to say this:

Perl (or C, for that matter) doesn't lay out things on a plate. Perl
requires understanding of core OS concepts before one can build real world
applications for use in a production environment. PHP, Java, etc., OTOH,
makes it infinitely easy for anybody to program and build seemingly real
world applications, allowing all sorts of people to write all sorts of
things and still get away with it. In Java, it is the VM that externalizes
problems, as though, it is someone else's to handle.

I meant to say, thus, if you come across a perl programmer who has built
real world applications, chances are their fundamentals will be strong
(which, of course, you'd be testing in the interview). Their fundamentals
are strong because the language forced them to rethink their approach at
every juncture of their own skill development. That said, likewise, one
also comes across a whole bunch of "perl scripting" people who have not
written anything more than 300 lines of relevant code... but then, again,
it is very easy to spot them.

Absolutely agree. But tell me, from your experience, do you have a perfect
interview panel who all ask relevant, core testing questions? :)

I think, this thread is slightly moving away from Linux and moving
towards programming skills and hiring. Should we tag it as [OT]?

I Agree, and agree to disagree as well :-)
I agree that you need to get your OS fundamentals strong if you really
need to code well in C/PERL. The disagreement is on the fact that when
I want someone to be strong in Fundamentals, OS Concepts are NOT the
only fundamentals. Linking back to your homepage - System Thinking is
a good example of fundamentals.

Again, Agreed and disagreed. I agree that Java, .NET and to some
extent PHP, and others as well, do hide the OS implementations. This
doesn't mean that I can write rubbish and expect the VM to take care
of everything. A well experienced Java (or .NET) guy can guide you
though how a memory leak could occur in a Java program, how to use a
profiler to debug the memory leak, how threads get tangled causing
deadlocks, etc... Sounds familiar?

As I said earlier, we try to solve a different set of problems with
different tools. We don't necessarily take care of freeing up the
memory in Java, as we do in C. But, this doesn't mean that you can
create anything you want. We still need to make sure that the Garbage
Collector (GC) will be able to handle the memory on it's own, by
coding correctly. A bad programmer will be the same across all
languages.

The definition of what you mean by fundamentals makes a difference
here. I would go down to "Systems Thinking" for example as a
fundamental. OS Concepts, ... well an extremely added advantage?
Unfortunately, *Nix and other "time shared" scheduling OSs are not the
only one type lying around.

Spot on. Agreed +1

How come the candidates who come for interviews, never even realize this?

Dear folks,

I was very much surprised to see in Fedora 16 when i connected my iphone to
charge via USB cable and in Battery Indicator there was 2 indicators,
1. Showing my Laptop battery charge status and
2. Other showing my iphone battery charge status.

I have written it in my blog with screenshot here

I haven't seen such a thing in any other Operating systems. Wanted to share
this new feature with you all.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl III more looping
Message-ID: <CALDskyzxzVyOUnrDfzAmSeip2fVu2zrHRNTqdnPDV1OEC_rKVA@mail.gmail.com>

Just like the if() condition in languages there is an unless()
condition in perl.

It is just the opposite of if.

$j = 6;

unless($j eq 6) {
        print "j is not 6";
}

if($j eq 6) {
        print "j is 6";
}

You can also write conditionals like this:

print "I matched" if (/here/);

or:

print "Not matching" unless(/here/);

Of course this construct only makes sense inside a loop since $_ gets
 set only in such conditions. And this need be a for() iterator.

It can also be a file read with the <> (diamond operator).

Now we will see the while loop.

It is just like C. Except that there is a dollar everywhere.
$i = 26;

while($i > 0) {
        print "$i\n";
        $i--;
}


There is also do while().

$i = 26;

do {
        print "$i\n";
        $i--;
}while($i > 0);

We have an example to obtain user input and then a conditional code.

$ cat i.pl
print "Please enter a number:";
$i = <>;

chomp($i);
if($i eq 1) {
        print "i is 1\n";
} elsif($i eq 100) {
        print "is is 100\n";
} else {
        print "i is neither 1 nor 100\n";
}
$ perl i.pl
Please enter a number:

Note that chomp() is used to remove a training newline from input.

<> reads a line or lines from standard input STDIN depending upon whether
 the LHS is a scalar($var) or array(@a).1

Now we will see how to do break and continue  using last and next:

$ cat i.pl

@arr = (1,2,2,4, "something" , 3, 5, 56, "more string", "last", 334);

for(@arr) {
        unless(/\d/) {
                print "Got string:$_\n";
        }
        if($_ eq 2) {
                print "I am continuing\n";
                next;
        }
        if($_ eq 56) {
                print "I am breaking the loop\n";
                last;
        }
}

Enough for today.

Hi,

I am working on a buddypress project to create a social networking 
site.  I want to create a mailing list for each buddypress groups, and 
enable user to discuss in that group through email.  Suppose, if i am 
creating a group for python users, i should get  a group mail like  
pythonusers at mysite.com .  This group mail should contain all members of 
the python buddypress group.  When the user leaves the group, he should 
be automatically unsubscribed from this mailing list too.

Do anyone have any idea over this?  All user interfaces can be done 
through buddypress plugins.  But how do i create a new group mail, 
dynamically?

If i am right, mailman provides only one group mail id.  Please correct 
me if i am wrong.

More over, i have to create a new group mail id dynamically through 
php.  When i create a new buddypress group, i should get a group mail on 
the name of that group.  Is it possible with mailman?

to give a scneario, suppose, let us assume i am working on a social 
networking project for this Chennai Linux User group.  We have many 
categories of mails coming to this, and NOT every wants everything.  
Suppose, i want to create separate subgroups for each kind of mails.  
The mails would be like  jobs at ilugc.com , main at ilugc.com,  
news at ilugc.com etc.   Is this possible with mailman?

It is possible with groupserver.org , but i could not install it 
properly.  More over, i want to use buddypress, and integrate this 
groupmail feature there.

Senthil

You can create any number of groups with Mailman.

Regarding building an interface with an external site, it is also possible.

ilugcbe mailing list is actually ilugcbe at googlegroups.com but still adminstered through Mailman.

Hi !
I did try installing ibus and the booster packages for tamil. But, I couldn't find the Tamil keyboard layout even then. All I did notice as the keyboard layouts were
1. Tamil2. Tamil keyboard with numerals3. Tamil (Srilanka, TAB typewriter)4. Tamil (Srilanka, UNICODE)5. Tamil (Tab typewriter)6. Tamil (TSCII typewriter)7. Tamil (UNICODE)
But, none of them seem to support phonetic typing. 
Am I missing out somewhere ?

Change the keyboard Input method to ibus. Or start ibus-daemon directly
using Alt+F2. Then right click on i bus icon in notification area, go to
preference you will find few of languages expand drop-down list. Then
choose tamil phonetic.
Then add it. While clicking in text box press Ctrl+space to enable the
chosen phonetic. Now it should work.
note: ibus-m17n will enable Tamil support.

Have a great day!

Dear Roshan,

Hi.

I did not know the website you sent for registrations. You just show up
 and yes if you want to have tea, then with the money. ;)

You can just walk in.

After a couple of months of this perhaps we can organize things in a better way.

As to what in perl I am going to cover I guess it will be a good one
day dump of the basics to advanced stuff, but I will focus more on the
basics than on the advanced stuff.

Message-ID: <loom.20111205T115659-412@post.gmane.org>

Hi Girish, et al.

This has been an interesting and opinionated introduction to Perl. Thanks!

A note about a module that has helped me a lot to debug my Perl data structures
from the very beginning - Data::Dumper

>From perlmonks.org (http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=31714):

Item Description: takes a variable ( or reference to a variable) and 'unrolls'
or dumps it out for inspection

Review Synopsis: invaluable for object design and debugging complicated data
structure

Coming from a Perl Monk, that is high praise indeed.

Its usage is very straightforward:

use Data::Dumper;
local $Data::Dumper::Indent = 1;
print "DEBUG: Your-variable: ", Dumper (\<your-variable-here);

It is an idiom in most of my Perl scripts.

Interesting side-note: its author, Gurusamy Sarathy, is probably the only Indian
who has been a Perl Pumpking, aka release manager. Link to an old (2000)
interview: http://www.pinjax.com/gsar.html.

Sameer

Subject: [chennaipy 1149] Request for comment : pluggdapps
To: <chennaipy at googlegroups.com>

I am an open source programmer in python, C and linux, have authored couple
of tools called eazytext (wiki processor), tayra (web templating language)
and CouchPy (CouchDB database modelling tool) all released under GPL v3.

This email is about a web framework, released recently, called pluggdapps,
and I request your comments on the same. I will try to reason out why I
went about building this pluggdapps,

1. It is an attempt to unify Model-View-Controller design pattern and a
plugin architecture. To highlight an important road-block in current
web-frameworks, plugin designs break at view-templating. It is difficult to
provide a plugin system without compromising on MVC. But with pluggdapps I
hope this problem is solved. And couple of smaller ones got solved along
the way :)
2. NoSQL databases, although immature and yet to evolve, are challenging
SQL  databases in web domain. pluggdapps have assumed CouchDB as the
default database, and roles out a modelling tool-kit called CouchPy to
build expertise around NoSQL database.
3. Lot of development in web is to do with browser-technologies. pluggdapps
include a comprehensive templating tool kit called Tayra. It is inspired
from Mako (from pylons) and HAML (from Rails) and has best of both worlds.
And it is the only web-templating tool that support template-plugins.
4. With ideas like WebSockets, SVG, WebStorage, WebGL, HTML5 coming up on
web, having a framework and a community can help us build some amazing
technologies in future.

I sincerely anticipate your feedback. Right now I am more or less working
full-time on this and your comments can be of immense use to me.

To know more visit http://pluggdapps.com, please note that the site is
hosted with regular BSNL broadband using Static-IP. We know how BSNL works,
good and bad in certain ways.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl tutorial IV regular expressions
Message-ID: <CALDskywiWKULWkrZsnjidRjf+KdHn9vQ0M5oMUHQkYwMBAhZ0w@mail.gmail.com>

 A regular expression is regular and is an expression of the real thing.

It is not the real thing.

It is regular because it is a pattern to express the real thing.

Let us look at an example.

$foo = "Girish is here";

if($foo =~ /\w/) {
        print "\$foo contains alphanumeric characters\n";
}

The =~ is a regex equality operator. It is like ne or eq in perl.

Or like == check in most languages.

And the // is the regex container.

Anything inside that is an expression. Like

\w
\d
\S
[a-z]
.*

It is a little difficult to learn but it is well worth it.

For instance at this minute you can easily memorize :

\w - Any word character(alphanumerc, 0-9a-z_ )

\d - Any digit 0123456789

\S - Any non space character(any character other than single space or
tab or newline)

[a-z] - It is a character class with characters a to z.

Now regular expressions like these are always used inside the two slash
characters like this. //.

/\w+/ is used to mean more than one of word character.

/\d+/ means contiguous digits.

First we will focus on regular expression matching. That is the tough
part. Tomorrow we will look at substitution with the s/// operator.

The match is actually the m// operator but usually nobody uses m. People
just use //.

So to match a sequence of digits, we have to write like this.

$s = "I am a string with 1234";

Now

if($s =~ /\d+/) {
	print "digits match."	
}

There are two more twists.

The () operator is called the cluster operator inside a // regex
container.

So /\d+/ is the same as /(\d+)/ as far as matching is concerned and
 as far as regex is concerned but with a difference.

The matched tokens are stored in a special variable.

This is the real power of regex.

It is stored in $1.

So if you print it you will get 1234.

if($s =~ /(\d+)/) {
   print $1;
}

I have to explain few more concepts and we will see more examples
tomorrow.

+

is a repetition operator.

There are other repetition operators:

{1,n} - 1 to n repetitions

But + is cool.  + is actually {1,} (more than 1 without bounds)

 It is nice and can be used very often for most basic
needs.

\d+

as we saw above means get us all the digits that occur close together.

It will get us

"134343 is the string"

all of the digits here.

But not this.

"324s343 3r4 is 33"

In this case we need something else to match all the digits.

In fact it is very difficult.

So as I said always remember regular expressions need an ability to
think about what is regular in the input string.

Then only we can construct meaningful and correct regex.

Another concept is called anchors.

Most of the time we look for regex in a positional way.

We want to find any string occurring in the beginning of a line or after
a space or something.

Or at the end of the line.

So you say

/^string$/

to say that the line begins and ends with the literal "string".

^ is the beginning of the line.

$ is the end of the line.

This means we can say.

/^The/

for all lines beginning with The.

/end$/

for all lines ending with "end".

Yes. SQL*Plus and SQL*LDR are the Oracle command line tools available
on all platforms including Linux. The command names would be "sqlplus"
- for normal query and results and "sqlldr" for bulk data loads from
flat files(AKA  ETL) .

Good documentation. It describes how to access Oracle from a Shell
Script. If you just want to use it as querying tool, you can skip the
script and use the SQLPLUS directly.

Install oracle client on linux (with the version compatible with
server version)  and then you can connect to oracle server via command
line , you can script with this and do more.

Message-ID: <CALDskyz38rzTTo+JTPepEfFcKYdyE+z=aHCZuLiiMQEQJG6ffQ@mail.gmail.com>

There are many special variables in perl which can be seen with

$ perldoc perlvar

There are many for REGEX.

If you match a part of a string which is what you do all the time,

you can get the matched portion in the variable $&.

Example:

$str = "Here is a sample string";

if($str =~ /^Here/) {
           print $&;
}

It will print "Here".

Not useful?

It will be useful when you match using expressions.

The idiomatic and perl way of using regexes is when you read from a
file or stdin

We saw how to read from stdin using the diamond <> operator.

while(<>) {
      if(/\d+/) {
              print "I get digits $&\n";
      }
}

This will read any input from stdin and print out just the digits.

But only the first match. For all matches you have to use //g.

Anyway all matches are done on a line by line basis. So if you have a
regex that spans
 multiple lines you have to give one more switch to regex like //s or something.

Anyway you can easily write a cat(1) command in perl using:

$ cat cat.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl

while(<>) {
         print;
}

$ perl cat.pl /etc/passwd

will print the file on stdout.

Sometime back, I remember in one of the emails there was request for 
training for Gimp as replacement for photoshop. If we have this 
magazine, I think it will be great if it serves as a platform to 
introduce Foss softwares to the small businesses as a replacement to 
their pirated/non-foss softwares.

Subject: Updates on Download.Com caught adding malware to Nmap installer
To: nmap-hackers at insecure.org


Hi Folks.  A lot has happened since yesterday's email about
Download.com's antics (http://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2011/5) and I
wanted to send a quick update.

First of all, several people complained about my angry tone and my
telling Download.com to "F*ck" themselves.  I appologize to anyone
offended.  But if you ever spend more than 14 years creating free
software as a gift to the community, only to have it used as bait by a
giant corporation to infect your users with malware, then you may
understand my rage.

The good news is that many users are sick and tired of having their
machines hijacked by malware.  Especially by CNET Download.Com, which
still says on their own adware policy page:

 "In your letters, user reviews, and polls, you told us bundled
  adware was unacceptable--no matter how harmless it might be. We want
  you to know what you're getting when you download from CNET
  Download.com, and no other download site can promise that."
  --http://www.cnet.com/2723-13403_1-461-16.html

Um, what people WANT when they download Nmap is Nmap itself.  Not to
have their searches redirected to Bing and their home page changed to
Microsoft's MSN.

Speaking of which, Microsoft emailed me today.  They said that they
didn't know they were sponsoring CNET to trojan open source software,
and that they have stopped doing it.  But the trojan installer uses
your Internet connection to obtain more "special offers" from CNET,
and they immediately switched to installing a "Babylon toolbar" and
search engine redirect instead.  Then CNET removed that and are now
promoting their own "techtracker" tool.  Apparently the heat is so
high that even malware vendors are refusing to have any more part in
CNET's antics!  But if CNET isn't stopped, the malware vendors will
come crawling back eventually and CNET will be there to receive them.

There have been dozens of news articles in the last day and hundreds
of outraged comments on blogs, Twitter, Facebook, etc.  In the midst
of all this terrible PR, Download.com went in last night and quietly
switched their Nmap downloads back to our real installer.  At least
for now.  But that isn't enough--they are still infecting the
installers for thousands of other packages!  For example, they have
currently infected the installer for a children's coloring book app:

http://download.cnet.com/Kea-Coloring-Book/3000-2102_4-10360620.html

Have they no shame at all??!

I've created a page with the situation background, links to the news
articles, and the latest updates:

http://insecure.org/news/download-com-fiasco.html

Feel free to share it.  Together, I hope we can get Download.Com to
apologize and cease this reprehensible behavior!

Cheers,
Fyodor

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl tutorial VI file I/O
Message-ID: <CALDskyxpffbv6VQhDTwQQw1hYK3sq_yMT4_pLkVOFzisPnEANQ@mail.gmail.com>

We saw the power of regex and also that regexes form the core
strength of perl. How easily it melds with the perl idiom and the
 perl way of doing things makes regex very commonly and
 powerfully used in perl.

In fact most of the time perl is used because of the flexibility of regexes.

It slows down things a bit but perl was never built for performance.
It will never
 be faster than C since all languages are written in C and it is an
interpreted language.

At least it would be faster than Java. ;)

Anyway I was also talking OO and God knows how I could forget python.

Python is a language built with OO in mind ground up. And it is very
pleasant to do OO in
 python and it is a clear OO language.

In my opinion perl OO is more natural and smooth as opposed to Python
because you
 can do OO in perl without even realizing the complexity or OO concepts.

That I will argue is a power of perl than its weakness. It is not
perfect and it is ugly but
 you can get your job done without any hassle. Hence the argument in
LUG few days ago
 that perl OO does not have private variables. In fact javascript is a
prototype language.

It means that there is no much difference between class and object.
Perl also has that
 idiom though it is not strictly so. One needs to instantiate a class
as an object to use it
 in most cases.

Also python has many functional programming concepts. The for()
iterator we saw in perl
 is a crude example. In perl you have very few. Python and LISP are full of it.

Anyway let us get to work now.

File I/O involves reading and writing files.

All languages have OS bindings to do this. Javascript does not have;
it runs inside a browser and
 a browser cannot have security flaws.

Anyway file I/O in perl can be done in many ways.

In the simplest case:

open FH, "/etc/passwd";
while(<FH>) {
      print;
}
close FH;

will do a file input.

A simple file output would be:

open FH, ">/tmp/test";
print FH "Writing a test file\n";
close FH;

Test these two programs.

It is easy.

The <> (diamond) operator takes a file descriptor/handle as input.

It is called a typeglob in perl I think(I don't like academic stuff).
It is something,
 not a scalar, not an array, not a reference.

Anyway <FH> reads from the file handle typeglob. <> reads from standards input
 file descriptor.

The diamond operator is as much a hit amongst the perl geeks as the
regex // operator.

It significantly simplifies file input.

As to file output, print is the most useful command to write to a file
descriptor.

print "What is this?";

prints to stdout.

print FH "what is this";

prints to the file handle.

There are other commands like sysopen(), sysread() etc. but I never use them.

$ perldoc -f sysopen

The perl's standard documentation installed in the perl distribution
is not always
very readable. Some pages are very badly written.

Ironically the perl modules found in CPAN have very nice man pages and
plenty of code samples.

In fact you can simply use the mouse to copy paste code and you can
begin perl hacking.

What is twitr? Do you mean twit ?

Anyway what do you want me to do?

Regexes are very complex but then with time you can learn it.

I took more than 4 months to master it.

But the real mastering took even more time.

And as to memory I was only 8 years old in 1985, so I dunno if
someone can remember for so long.

Memory is a gift of Goddess Saraswathy. We can only pray to her.

What more can we do?

Perfectly ok.

I chose tamil keyboard layout in Regional and language settings.

This is system wide change . You need to change ibus setting . you can use
the command "ibus-setup" . After adding tamil. Check for shortcut to change
keyboard layout. If not change it in shell. you must get some other icon
other than keyboard. That represents the change of keyboard.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl tutorial VII (perl tricks)
Message-ID: <CALDskyzt3ydDdEr3mokF1kHBeTK-FKEoF7MJnjdxNCd1HS8_PQ@mail.gmail.com>

Perl is a language full of tricks because it is nothing but UNIX command line
tools with some innovations of its own like regex extensions, easy and
 well integrated OO to solve complex problems easily, easy file I/O, easy
 socket I/O, easy IPC facilities in UNIX and so on.

However using pack(), vec(), map() and so on is hard.

I have not yet understood how map() works. It is a functional
programming concept.

pack() is used for binary protocols and for encoding in various forms.

In a lot of ways perl is messy and with a syntax that is so odd that
it is often called

"The write once forget language"

In other words perl is used for quick and dirty jobs.

But that is not strictly true. Perl is also used a lot in serious
tasks and many UNIX utilities
 are built with perl. The entire package management in OpenBSD which
is the best package management tool
in the UNIX world developed by Marc Espie, a French gentleman is in
perl using perl OO.

Perl is slow and not really as fast as C. It can never be faster than C.

In fact C is a middle level language which acts as a low level
language in the kernel(particularly bootup startup code)
 and as a high level language when used for GUI like GTK and as  a
middle level language in most applications
like networking, I/O and so on.

Perl on the other hand is a high level language. It is a scripting
language; which means that it is a
 language used to express your ideas in a language that looks like English.

This could be said of python but perl is not even half as elegant.

It is only its integration with UNIX ideas, its superb ability to copy
great ideas and integrate well that it
 is such a hit amongst UNIX geeks like me.

Why was I not forced to learn Python deeply? But perl is something I
use everywhere. This should give you a hint.

Anyway let us get down to business.

die "The program does not have any sense!\n" unless(/something important/);

This is an example to prove that perhaps perl is like English and a script.

What is a script?

A script is written by hand or a poem or Haiku or a scrawl.

Perl can be used that way. It can be used without much thought about
efficiency or variable scoping, typing
 or declaring.

All perl variables are by default global. By global people say file
scope, package scope and so on.

Anyway let us not get into that.

Let us see another example.

$ perl i.pl /etc/passwd
88ced295c57a727aadab4e626dad47b1df6c98e3
$ sha1 /etc/passwd
SHA1 (/etc/passwd) = 88ced295c57a727aadab4e626dad47b1df6c98e3
$ cat i.pl
use Digest::SHA1 qw(sha1_hex);

$digest = sha1_hex(<>);

print "$digest\n";

sha1 is a command in OpenBSD. On Linux you say sha1_sum which a GNU thing.

Anyway there are plenty of tricks one could do with the UNIX in perl.

Look at this:

$ cat i.pl
open PIPE, "netstat -a|";

while(<PIPE>) {
        print;
}

Here what we do is open a pipe to the netstat -a command. It lists all
the sockets in the system.

We can of course do this:

$ perl i.pl
       2       8      37
$ cat i.pl
open PIPE, "|wc";

print PIPE "What are you doing?\n";

print PIPE "Let me count now\n";

close PIPE;

Hi,

> Honestly speaking no one will read.> Please do think that how many in this group, uses their system in Tamil ?

I beg to differ.

During my college days me and couple of my friends were toying with a
DOS program, where a handler routine will be hooked up with keyboard
interrupt signal and try to capture key press. Instead of reading the
scan code from keyboard buffer, it directly reads from keyboard port
address, so that the handler can execute non-intrusively with respect
to rest of the system.

This idea came from a magazine called "Tamizh computer". Although we
work with English for day to day activities, good articles in native
languages are bound to help some one.

Instead of starting a new magazine, why not channel FOSS articles to
existing magazines.

Dear Friends,

On our march to prove that IT can not only contribute to the economy of
this country but also to the lives of those who have been ignored and
forgotten in our race to the top, the day to give life to the Punnagai
Community Computing Center has come.

We as the volunteers of Free Software Foundation, Tamil Nadu along with its
associates, would like to invite you all for the inauguration of our first
center at Mylapore.

Place: Pallakku Maanagar, Near Railway Station, Mylapore, Chennai.
Time: 4.00 PM
Date: 11th December 2011

What is Punnagai Community Computing Center?

The Punnagai Community Computing Centre is an attempt to take the wonders
of the world of IT to those people who till now have had no opportunity to
be a part of it. This includes students whose schools do not have any labs
or who may not go to schools at all and young men and women whose job
prospects can be greatly boosted by even some basic computer skills. These
students and youth, through a series of age-appropriate free courses, will
be armed with tools that can make a key difference to their lives.

Hello all,

One more Indian appeal is about to go on the banners soon I guess. Please
read Dr.Sengai Podhuvan's appeal here[1]. Aniruddha Kumar's appeal is also
on the way and might be available soon. If you had met the old gentlemen in
the conference, didnt had a chat with him, here his story. Thanks Victor
for getting these amazing stories out! They should be used to beyond
fundraising to make people edit / atleast know who is editing Wikipedia.
The "20 something male editor" may in larger numbers, but showcasing these
profiles from different demographic might make more the ratio better.

map is a means of transforming ("mapping") an array into another array. The
arguments to map are:

1. function which will take one element at a time and return one element
2. the array of elements

As an example, if one would like to calculate the square of numbers in an
array and store them in another array, one can use map to do it as follows:

@x = (1,2,3,4,5);
@y = map { $_ * $_; } @x;

or simply

@y = map { $_ * $_; } (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

When map invokes the provided function (first arg) it is called with $_ set
to each element of the array and is called one time for each element in the
order of appearance of its arguments. Let's use map now to also print the
array @y:

map { print $_ . "\n"; } @y
1
4
9
16
25


Here is an exercise to the reader: Using a combination of regexes and map,
read a HTML file and turn all its <a href="(.*?)">(.*?)</a> into a hash
where the URI is the key of the hash and the marked up text (anchor text)
becomes the value. The following is a sample test input string:

$string = <<EOM;

<a href="/blah">Go to blah</a> and <a href="/blah/search">look for all the
blahs</a>... and here is a <a href="/multi">multi
line
 <em>nested</em> HTML markup
</a>
EOM

I'd once again request you to stop demeaning the stuff you're trying to
teach (or thrust your impartial views onto a public forum like this). Why
would anyone want to learn something that is, according to your narrow
understanding, is worthless?

If you think something is tough, it will remain tough and unapproachable
(because the problem of 'toughness', etc., is in your mind). If you're full
of your own preconceived notions, it is very difficult to change it unless
you're willing to throw away those notions and then explore and learn about
it (there is nothing to lose when learning, except time :) ).

Think about it, programming a computer was not any friendlier back then,
yet, that is what paved way for generic abstractions that allowed us to
build cooler stuff on top. Perl too, if you approached it this way, can be
effectively used to abstract away problems and build generic solutions on
top. But you should be willing to invest time in abstracting and designing
your code thus. If you expect a scissor to do what a chainsaw can (and vice
versa) then it is not the tool that is at fault.

An illiterate will (almost always) write horrible poetry. This is a highly
subjective (and highly inflammable ;) ) bait. Perhaps you're judging perl
by your (or your peers') inability to write elegant code? A sword, to a
Samurai, is more elegant than a pistol.

For that matter, why were you not forced to learn even perl deeply?

Kudos to the people behind this project! This is an excellent effort to
which we'd also like to contribute by way of donating Career Gear's Trichy
training center's hardware, physical and virtual space, ltsp based fully
free software infrastructure and wherever possible our staff's time too.

btw, the second number provided above has only 9 digits. :)

I know couple of friends who rave about perl. Especially I hear that
the first 2 chapters of Programming Perl by Larry Wall is a must read
for every programmers. With all its goodness Perl seem to foster a
kind of cryptic programming, demanding a lot of meditation to
understand its logic, especially when the logic was crafted by some
one else. The OP has got some truth in his article, although slightly
out of context, but hey every one is entitled to their opinion don't
they ? May be it is more to do with the style of writing and less to
do with their opinion. May be.

Cheers,

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl tutorial VIII (I/O command line and functions)
Message-ID: <CALDskyxADcTHdAZS9mMmNrf8zpA94gZ9vPLQJtwKNZ1khBvwjQ@mail.gmail.com>

I/O is done using either of the <> (diamond) operator or of course using
 command line positional arguments.

For instance you read a line of input like this:

$input = <>;

print "You entered: $input\n";

You can obtain the input when the script is executed from the command line.

$ perl foo.pl first second third

$ cat foo.pl
$first = shift;
$second = shift;
$third = shift;

print "First positional arg is $first\n";
print "Second arg is $second\n";
print "Third arg is $third\n";

Now we have an idea how to obtain input from the user in two ways.

Either from the command line or by asking the user to type something.

Output is simple. Use the print command. If you print to a file handle
the file is written into.

A perl function is a subroutine and the keyword is sub().

But the () are not necessary.

$ cat exfunc.pl

sub foo {
        $f = shift;
        $s = shift;
        print "Args are $f and $s\n";
        print "Inside the function\n";
}

&foo(1,"second");


As you can see the subroutine foo has a body {} just like a C block.

And the arguments are passed in its calling and they are accessed using the
shift() function which we use to get arguments from the command line.

There are other ways to do the same thing but this is the simplest.

And easiest to remember.

The function is called either just by

foo("first", 34);

or by using the

&foo()

method.

There is a difference between the two ways to invoke functions but ignore
 that at the moment.

Suppose we apply the logic that one language is enough to computers , then why use perl,python etc.? After all everything was in binary language few decades back and the then programmers understood it well.

Monoculture - even in language is bad. Linking/limiting knowledge to a single language is not good.

     He is not demeaning anything. He has an opinion that he is
expressing. You talk like Mr . Kapil Sibal. I use Perl is my job and I
have used Python as well. I can tell you from experience that even
well written Perl code is quite difficult to read when compared to a
well written Python code. Please don't hurry to say "Well, then it is
not well written". And to reply to your accusation, this is Randall
Schwartz says in his Learning Perl book.

"Perl is good for quick-and-dirty programs that you can whip up in
three minutes".

Now, did Girish say something different ?

And the same book also says, "Perl is kind of ugly, This is true.".

You may love a language, but do jump at some one who points out a few
negatives of what you love.

     You are getting into personal attacks which is a very bad trait.
When a language has a variable like "$|" and people use such stuff
frequently, I wouldn't call that language elegant. Another thing is,
you always seem to have the opinion that anyone who tells  something
negative about Perl is an "illiterate" or doesn't know how to write
Perl. That is not the case. When it comes to readability, I find
Python to be much much easier then Perl or C. C is a language that I
like very much. But when someone says Python is more readable and
looks more elegant, I would most certainly agree.

        Another personal attack ? Can't people attack the points
mentioned without attacking the person. Thanks

Please avoid personal remarks in the list.

AFAIK, Teachers do add a bit of personal experience in their teaching. 
Your personal experience might be different and you are welcome to share it.

I know very little perl and I like Girish's tutorial emails. So, I hope, 
he continues his effort for the benefit of the list.

You can always ask perl to "use English".

Mathematics is full of symbols and it is very beautiful once you
understand their meaning. Perl is no different, and the symbols
are well chosen - Larry Wall is a linguist and considerable effort
has gone into these details.

Learning a programming language is much more than the
semantics. Suggest the focus of our discussion is directed
towards deeper topics.

Really? :-/ I personally liked it. I don't think it had anything to do
with Chrome. Firefox by itself has its bunch of loyalists(Iike me).
Firefox has improved a lot since 3.x. Chrome seems to have made
firefox a better browser by giving it the competition it deserved.
Even the Nightly is amazingly stable and fast of late.

I guess this was made after

       I have seen people use that. But never used it myself. Also, it
seems to be less commonly used. Most discussions on the Internet do
not seem to use it.

         I agree that considerable discussions might have gone into
it. But may be mathematics might not be the right analogy. But again,
Perl was designed a couple of decades ago, and given its age, it might
have been the well chosen. Only that, in my opinion, it doesn't look
elegant. It does its job well, no doubt about that.

       It had been mostly towards better things until this trend of
personal attacks started. But yes, there is more to learning a
language than its semantics. Thanks

Install visual studio redistributable. It should work. If even after
installing that if it shows error about missing dll then, manually download
those dll from *Internet* and paste *wine C_drive/windows/system* to open
this location use the wine menu. or it will be in *~/.wine* location.
Enjoying the freedom is important, but using it properly is more than that.

Just use Tor. Search for package vidalia in ubuntu and install it.
Alternatively, you can also follow the instructions in this link -
https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian-vidalia.html.en

Note : Its much safer to follow the link, than directly installing vidalia/tor.

Agreed. English is the easiest to read. Python is easy. C is very difficult
(or would you prefer C to be placed before Perl?). Assembly is very very
difficult... and so on.

1. I just ask you to imagine replacing this entire analogy to introducing
GNU/Linux to the uninitiated. Imagine, if someone kept telling you that
GNU/Linux sucks compared to, say, OSX... yet you gotta learn GNU/Linux for
a reason not explained clearly.  Now, as a reader, I'd be (and was) highly
confused and become wary of approaching such a thing which is supposedly
sucky and the purpose of learning which I'm not clear.

2. Imagine, being told that writing code in C is not advisable in
comparison to Python because C requires careful memory management. Of
course, it is a true statement (when looked at partially). But an
incorrect, impartial statement.

... and imagine 1 & 2 happening on a public forum.

Hence, I'd asked the OP to "consider" not doing these two above outlined
things.

I owe an apology to whoever that may have interpreted whatever I may have
said knowingly or unknowingly to cause damage to their identity. Let's
please end this thread that has gone beserk.

regards,

Do you need RHEL in particular ? Centos is a community compilation of 
the RHEL packages. You can check the packages and version between 
RHEL-5.7 and Centos-5.7 on distro watch. They should be the same.

http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=redhat
http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=centos

I think, what you are looking for is CentOS. There are a lot of mirrors 
where you can download CentOS from, check out their website centos.org

On a side note, you will see a lot of mention of term "North American 
Enterprise Linux vendor" on their website which AFAIK means Red Hat. The 
alternative name is used for legal reasons, I believe.

Hope this helps.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl tutorial IX ( perl and shell scripts)
Message-ID: <CALDskyyoof5gfn4TES9-rSXKDtnqWxsumPWxXWfAqHAg4f4A-A@mail.gmail.com>

Perl is a good substitute for shell scripts but not really good in the
 sense that shell scripts have not lost their relevance and status.

Due to its rich integration with the UNIX environment and culture perl
 makes an excellent alternative for automating/scripting and install
 scripts.

In fact in the bad old Indian IT industry perl is almost only used for test
 suites and test automation. We will look at that one of these days. Perl
 has excellent support for test automation. Really, easy cool and intuitive.

Today we are looking at how perl knowledge can make you better
 network admin.

In fact I wrote my first perl scripts when I created an install script for a
 crypto product in 2003. The admin web interface was entirely perl.

So I had plenty of exposure. Moreover I think some parts of the
install script was in shell.
 I don't remember well. You can mix and match anything in a shell script.

Let us first look at perl's find and perl's grep.

Here is:

$ perldoc -f grep
grep BLOCK LIST


       grep EXPR,LIST
               This is similar in spirit to, but not the same as, grep(1) and
               its relatives.  In particular, it is not limited to using
               regular expressions.

               Evaluates the BLOCK or EXPR for each element of LIST (locally
               setting $_ to each element) and returns the list value
               consisting of those elements for which the expression evaluated
               to true.  In scalar context, returns the number of times the
               expression was true.

                   @foo = grep(!/^#/, @bar);    # weed out comments

               or equivalently,

                   @foo = grep {!/^#/} @bar;    # weed out comments

As usual perl man pages are written for geniuses and are not very clear. But
 once you use it a few times you will get the hang of it.

There is a script called find2perl and you can :

$ man File::Find

Let us look at an example for perl's grep.

$ cat i.pl
@a = (1,2,3,4,"what", 'bat', 23);

@b = grep(/\d/, @a);

print "@b is only numbers\n";

As with every other thing in perl to use it to your advantage you should
 know regular expressions. Without a grasp of regular expressions you don't do
 much in perl.

What has this got to do with shell scripts?

Where are shell scripts used? And when should we go for perl scripts?

Shell scripts are used for installing software. Shell scripts are used
in cron jobs for
 automation and for network testing and even for avoiding repetition for some
quick task you have in mind.

You have to use perl instead of shell when you wish to do sockets programming.

However this is not strictly true. There are plenty of command line tools like
 curl, wget and netcat which can help you even with sockets, but the full power
 of sockets will be available only in perl.

I will give a sample of how something is written in shell and how the
same thing is
 done in perl.

$ cat i.sh
for i in /etc/*.conf
do
        echo "---- New file $i ----" >> /tmp/configsinetc
        echo  >> /tmp/configsinetc
        cat -n $i >> /tmp/configsinetc
        echo  >> /tmp/configsinetc
done

$ cat i.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl

use File::Glob ':glob';

@f = bsd_glob('/etc/*.conf');

open FH, ">/tmp/configs";
for $fl (@f) {
        open RD, $fl;
        print FH "--- New file $fl ---\n\n";
        while(<RD>) {
                print FH "$. $_";
        }
        close RD;

}
close FH;

Both are expected to do the same thing:

Write files with .conf suffix under /etc/ all into one file with line numbers.

The perl version seems substantially difficult as you have to do
 manual reading of each file.

The shell script however is much simpler.

But there are counter examples. Let us look at one:

$ cat f.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl

open FH, "/etc/passwd";

while(<FH>) {
        ($uname) = split /:/;
        if(length($uname) eq 5) {
                print;
        }
}
close FH;

Here we find out usernames that are 5 chars in length.

How will you do this with shell script?

Perl is a higher level programming language than the shell script. So
 it comes with a convenience that you can make very good use of.

Hey LUGGIES!

I have been snooping around for an nice free host and happened upon "
http://x10hosting.com "
It was a great service that offered completely unmetered storage and
bandwidth. But the thing is, I'd like to run a diaspora node on it.
Diaspora runs on the Ruby on Rails platform. Unfortunately, they(the hosts)
offer only php, python, ASP.Net, perl and MySQL.
What I'd like to know is where or not there is any sort of emulator or
parser that runs RoR applications on a python or perl environment?
Thanks in advance!

Cheers,
Suraj.

Just solving the ruby problem is not enough, checkout the dependencies 
for diaspora on their website,

https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Installing-and-Running-Diaspora

Ruby - The Ruby programming language. (We're developing mostly on 1.8.7, 
but we also support 1.9.2.)
RubyGems - A package manager for Ruby code that we use to download 
libraries ("gems") that Diaspora uses.
Bundler - A gem management tool for Ruby projects.
MySQL - Backend storage engine.
Or: PostgreSQL - Backend storage engine.
SQLite3 - Relational database management system
OpenSSL - An encryption library.
libcurl - A library to make HTTP requests (and much more).
ImageMagick - An image processing library we use to resize uploaded photos.
Git - A version control system, which you will need to download the 
Diaspora source code from GitHub.
Redis - A persistent key-value store that we use via Resque for 
background job processing.

How are you going to get these dependencies installed ?

You might be better off getting a VPS instead of a web hosting solution. 
And AFAIK, there is no free VPS available.

Subject: [Ilugc] Issues using touchpad while charging Sony Vaio laptop
	running Kubuntu 11.10
Message-ID: <CAJzkRmY7dX4FH5Uz2Z6mvL6xELqCCR_0K6ueUrjEwGi-tsT9Hw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,
I am running Kubuntu 11.10 on a Sony Vaio VGN-FW260J and I recently
purchased a new charger for my laptop. Ever since I started using the new
charger, I am unable to use the touchpad with the same ease as before-at
times the response is delayed, at times it acts on it's own(i.e. left click
automatically happens without using the touchpad) and sometimes it becomes
unresponsive. This issue is becoming really annoying now. I tried the fix
suggested in
http://askubuntu.com/questions/70333/touchpad-freezing-on-a-sony-vaio-vpcf22s1e
but
it didn't solve the issue. I do not have an option to disable touchpad
while typing(I find it odd too but it just isn't there). What puzzles me is
that the touchpad works fine when the battery is discharging. Has anyone
else faced a similar issue?

 style ethical hacking contest
Message-ID: <CABCn+F0rv8_C=Bpsk_n8CUSYFUjxrzvbhO1=3FX++JQ0K65rpQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

My name is Sanjay Gopalan and I am a student of Amrita University,
Amritapuri, Kerala. The university, in association with Amrita TIFAC Core
in Cyber security, is conducting a national level capture the flag style
ethical hacking contest, InCTF, solely aimed at students. The contest is
similar to several international CTF style contests such as UCSB's iCTF,
RuCTFe etc but participation is limited to students enrolled in an Indian
University only and is being held from November 2011 to January 2012.

The goal of the contest is to impart to students knowledge of secure coding
practices and the implications of not following them. The contest features
3 rounds-first round is a learning round, second puts the learning to test
and the final round is the CTF round where teams will be given a vulnerable
Linux machine to defend.

The pre-requisite of the contest is knowledge of a programming language.
Working knowledge of Linux is highly desirable but not required; learn the
required skills while participating in the contest. The first round is a
learning round which imparts the skills that will be required in the later
stages of the contest.

A team can consist of maximum 5 members, all of whom must be from the same
college. There is no registration fee to participate in the contest. Prizes
for the top 5 places: upto Rs. 25000, upto Rs. 20000, upto Rs. 15000, upto
Rs. 10000 and upto Rs. 5000 respectively.

Registrations to the contest are open till December 31st, 2011. Keep in
touch with us. Website  <http://inctf.in/> | Email <contact at inctf.in> |

I think we should thank HP for taking a positive step by releasing WebOS
as free software, and now we should encourage them to go further toward
ensuring computer user freedom and ask if they will release it under GNU
GPLv3 (or later) and for them to make a commitment toward insuring that
WebOS can be built and flashed/installed without the use of proprietary
software.

Hi,


I faced the same problem. So I went to the TOR website instead, and
downloaded the 'Tor bundle' and installed that. The bundle gives you
Tor+Firefox integrated, and It's the easiest way to use Tor.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl tutorial X (some code tidbits)
Message-ID: <CALDskywbx82azXrx7VCYvheBAmM8Z7Q9oV5gffOfjv11dEC+yQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hope you are familiar with the programming language by now.

If some of you still dunno how to execute a simple perl script,
please remember this.

$ perl foo.pl

$ cat foo.pl
for(1..1000) {
          print; print "\n";
}

You can easily accomplish many difficult tasks in text processing
 with perl even without using any regular expressions.

You can easily convert all input into upper case:

$
$ cat i.pl
while(<>) {
   print uc;
}

Perl's documentation is written in plain old documentation format (POD)
 which can be converted into pdf, text and of course the nroff man format.

You can find all these converters:

$ pod2
pod2html   pod2latex  pod2man    pod2test   pod2text   pod2usage

Perl's POD documentation can either be invoked using:

$perldoc foo.pl

if the file contains the documentation inline or even if the file that contains
 pod is in the standard search location.

$perldoc perltoc

will tell you all the topics covered by perl's installed documentation.

It is huge, massive and no amount of reading will help you learn perl
unless you
 really get down to trying perl and running it.

Perl cannot be run interactively like Python. You have to run it one
script at a time.

All perl functions are written in the perlfunc man page.

$perldoc perlfunc

But it is useless. Instead you say

$perldoc -f split

or

$ perldoc -f join

or some such thing.

Some of the perl functions you can learn today are

1)map
2) tr
3) substr
4) push
5) shift
6) pop
7) keys
8) values
9) pack
10) ord

Just google and try out the examples.

The Perl interpreter's inbuilt debugger comes close to it. You can add the
'-d' switch like 'perl -d myscript.pl' or simply 'perl -d'.


There is an external tool called 'psh', which is a shell replacement that
uses perl. YMMV.

Dear All,

I am sharing the statistical report of Indian language wiki projects for
the month of 2011 October.  It is available here.
https://blog.wikimedia.org/2011/12/12/indian-language-wikipedia-statistics-october-2011/


Some interesting facts that I discovered this month are:

   - Nearly *4.3 crore* readers are there for all Indic language
   wikipedias!  This number is huge and increased by nearly 1/3 in just 1
   month! So Indic wikis has huge reader base.
   - Marathi wiki community has increased its active editor base by nearly
   33% in just 1 month.
   - Sanskrit wikipedia has been amongst the shining stars of *all* Indic
   language wikipedias in terms of adding new articles (12 new articles every
   day in October) and edits per article (nearly 18 edits across all articles,
   old and new.)

You can find more interesting facts from the report at

Message-ID: <CALDskyyGv-4DHR_4kVADNPMEL9kh4L+7ogWzKX1pxnq=v0gv4w@mail.gmail.com>

$perldoc -f length

will tell you the way the length() function call works.

If it works on a scalar string it will tell you the number of
characters and if it works on
 an array it will tell you the number of elements.

You don't need me to find out what a perl function would do.

First pick up a book or some good site on perl and memorize all the
important functions.

There are only around 25 important functions. Try to reinforce the
perl way of coding
 into your brain.

Try out examples and build real life perl code around the use of each function.

I can tell you some trivial computer science nonsense like you can
have a queue and a stack
 using perl arrays with the functions to add and remove elems, ents
from the top of the stack and front of the queue.

push(), pop(), shift() and unshift().

Normally the perl idiom is to use push() to populate an array.

You don't have linked lists in perl. You do have pointers in the form
of references and
 you can combine arrays, hashes and have array of arrays.

For that you have to have a firm grasp of perl pointers.

Once you learn it is fun.

It won't be as hard as regex.

To construct and use an array of arrays or a hash of hashes is bit time taking.

Look at these man pages.

$ perldoc perllol

$perldoc perldsc

Don't feel scared.

Every hard problem in life is tackled with confidence, boldness,
manliness and a little
 bit of patience.

Patience wins in the end. Keep at it.

We will explore these topics in turn one by one.

And finally the dream has become the reality. Centre was declared open
by Mr:Uthayan. He elaborated the importance of taking technology to
people and there by developing our country in an inclusive manner. He
emphasised that in the era of technological revolution we need to
think globally and act locally. Almost 40 people attended the
function.  A sweet and meaningful song by Anandan from that locality
added more color to the function. It was fun to be with the kids.
Thanks for joining us. The journey is on and you are always welcome to
join hands with us.

Its an interesting system. I wonder how they protect their system from 
malicious users, considering they provide a service to run background 
processes.

Application:  Chkconfig

What it is:

Chkconfig is a utility to update and query runlevel information for system
services.  Chkconfig manipulates the numerous symbolic links in /etc/init.d/,
to relieve system administrators of some of the drudgery of manually editing
the symbolic links.

To know more about:

http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl8_chkconfig.htm

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install chkconfig


Example:

chkconfig --list apache2

This command lists the run levels Apache is configured to start on

in 2/3 days. I can take class on 16th Dec. I am also trying to arrange some 
old systems. Let me inform you once I get systems.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <CALJ7LH-1AvOUYJY1NHXjWiqNO-eHLnB1HrKeYcXy7dc__CD=oQ@mail.gmail.com>

Application: setserial

What it is:

Set and/or report the configuration information associated with
a serial port. This information includes what I/O port and which IRQ
a particular serial port is using.

This version has a completely new approach to configuration, so if you
have a setup other than the standard ttyS0 and 1, you will have to get
your hands dirty.

By default, only COM1-4 are configured by the kernel, using IRQ 3 and 4.
If you have other serial ports (such as an AST Fourport card), or
if you have mapped the IRQs differently (perhaps COM3 and 4 to other
IRQs to allow concurrent access with COM1 and 2) then you must have this
package.

To know more about:

http://setserial.sourceforge.net/

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install setserial


Example:

setserial -g /dev/ttyS[0123]

setserial with -g option help to find out what physical serial ports
your Linux box has.

Great work done by Pranav Mistry (Indian), who designed this and i was
waiting for the source of this because he already said that he is not going
to sell it any organization for patent, and he will release it under Open
Source and now he did as he promised and made the community proud too.

It seems, the source repository seems to be empty, returning error "Checked
out revision 34".
Hope soon they will resolve this issue.

Hope your are not considering using Ultrasurf/Tor in a corporate
environment. This traffic is easily identified by enterprise security
devices and proxies.

Ultrasurf/Tor also has a dark side - it has a reputation for hiding
illegal activities. You will become guilty by association. Using
these applications is a bigger breach of corporate policies than
using prohibited sites like Facebook or Youtube at work.

Know your risks before using these apps.

Apologies for forwarding that mail without a deep check of the links.

The source code is still not available and the people are asking for
code for a longer time.

check here.
http://code.google.com/p/sixthsense/wiki/Software

Lot of people asking in the wiki and mailing to pranav to update the code.
Still no info available on code.

Let us hope they release it soon.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl tutorial XI (perl references)
Message-ID: <CALDskyzJ7fk0aaMey2nJNaYFTnt+YtHHCQwVnEwTz9630=j5DA@mail.gmail.com>

Well just a reference would not cut it.

In English the language that I am not a master of and neither would I
want to be a
 master of come what may, there are two words.

Infer
Imply

Both mean more or less the same thing. You say, implied meaning and you say,
 "I infer from this the following."

Anyway in programming languages references or pointers and the C
language idea of
 call by reference and call by value all have something to do with
what I wrote above in
 English.

Basically the concept is that in the normal idea in which a variable
holds a value, like

$a = 50;

in the case of a reference or a pointer, you have a certain
associativity as in math like this:

a -> b -> c

a - (refers to) -> b - (refers to) -> c

So you say something like this in perl.

$a = 50;
$ref = \$a;

So now it is like this:

$ref -> $a -> $50

So you can easily dereference $ref and say,

${$ref} and you will get 50.

As you can see a scalar reference is not like a C variable pointer. It
is not that
 useful.

What makes us wonder at perl's genius and the cleverness of the design is in
assigning an array pointer.

Like this:

@a = (1,3,4,40);

$aref = \@a;

Now it is fun.

You can do a lot of cool things with it but that will take time. For
now say, you can
do this:

print @{$aref};

And as you can guess you can pass the entire array in one variable by
passing a reference to it.

There are lot of other very useful clever things you can do too.

You can build an array of references.

@refarray = ($aref, $aref2, $aref3);

where,

$aref = [1,3,4,10];
$aref2=[2,3,4,200];
$aref3=[100,"girish", 20];

Now you have what can be argued is a 2 dimensional array.

Hmm, things are getting a bit involved no?

Hold on. Be with me.

But before that how do these become array references? I just changed the
 () to [] and how do these become references?

That is a perl idiom. Always use funny characters to say what you mean.

So instead of :

@a = (1,3,4);
$ref = \@a;

you say,

$ref = [1,3,4];

Now to dereference you say,

@a = @{$ref};

You can obtain a reference with:

\

and you can dereference with:

@{ }

Try examples.

$ perldoc perlref

dia can be used to make very good, professional looking diagrams indeed.

If you're looking for outlining a large org chart (or any other such
hierarchy) quickly and dirtily, the freemind mind mapping software might be
helpful too.

dia can be used to make very good, professional looking diagrams. However,
if its a very large chart, freemind (or any other suitable) mind mapping
software might be helpful in representing your org structure.

dotcloud is a VPS: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server and
due to its inherently 'compartmentalized' nature it allows a hosting
service provider to divide a physical server into logical spaces.

There are many other VPS providers such as 'linode.com' who provide VPS
instances of many GNU/Linux stacks.

AFAIK that a Windows 7 Enterprise 90 day eval version is available
from Microsoft.

Search for "Windows 7 evaluation" gave this link that might perhaps
meet your needs.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl tutorial XII (hashes and references)
Message-ID: <CALDskyzE7FYBi8c3SB0HBqnGjaR9ixFR1JcLsCcT+Enps3v8wQ@mail.gmail.com>

References in perl are nothing but pointers but you can't use it like
you do it in C with subtraction, increment and so on.

Perl is a higher level language the references have to be used the perl way.

For instance references allow us to have a hash of arrays. A big array
can be coverted into one element easily with a reference
 and you can use that as a value in a hash.

For that matter you can even use function pointers are hash values.
This is in fact a common perl idiom. Of course in perl you
 don't call it a function pointer; instead you say subroutine reference.

Anyway now let us look at a hash.

%h = ( 1 => "first", 2 => "second );

$h{1} is "first" and $h{2} is "second".

Now

%h = ( 1 => [1,2,45,100], 2 => $a);

$a = [1,100,"girish"];

Of course the second line should come on top of first.

Now you can do like this:

$aref = $h{1};

@arr = @{$aref};

You can build an array of references like this also.

@a = (1,2,3,4, [10,30,4], [1,3,4]);

$a[#a][0], $a[#a][1], $a[#a][2] will give 1,3,4

You can also obtain a reference to a hash.

%hs = ( 123 => 35, 100 => 20);

$ref = \%hs;

%hash = %{$ref};

Now, $hash{123} will give 35.

Then please explain what it is other than saying it is not a VPS. Would
like to know (they are too abstract on their website).

Never mind - they build on top of Amazon EC2 and sell themselves as a
"platform as a service". Business/Marketing jargon but they are essentially
still a VPS (IMO, a VPS--) underneath.

No, they are not. VPS and PaaS are very different. dotcloud seems to 
offer various services you can use to build you application while in a 
VPS you can go nuts and do *whatever* you want with your guest OS since 
you get root access.

Right. They offer the services of "ops" which in the VPS world is to be
done on one's own.

Hi,

Never mind - they build on top of Amazon EC2 and sell themselves as a

"platform as a service".


They don't sell it as Platform as a Service (which is known as PaaS) but
they say that it is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). There is lot of
difference between the two and of course Amazon has also an offering for
PaaS on their IaaS. Right now everybody is offering more of IaaS but may be
three to four years down the line, it becomes a commodity item (IaaS) and
the real juice lies with PaaS.

All the best!

Regards

Ravi Kumar

Not necessarily, because there are also fully managed VPS providers who 
do the ops for you. But you are right, it is something similar.

Message-ID: <CALJ7LH_-PeBta4q7uONLCgxS4CAtaOaDROGoYvx7NOFXTLusZw@mail.gmail.com>

Application: usb-modeswitch

What it is:

Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act
like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If
the driver is already installed, the storage device vanishes and
a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
"ZeroCD" feature.

On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a
Linux kernel module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still
shows up as "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that
issue by sending the command which actually performs the switching
of the device from "usb-storage" to "usbserial".

To know more about:

http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install usb-modeswitch usb-modeswitch-data

Friends.

Tamil Wikipedia announced a Media Contest to increase the commons
media files like photos, audio and video in the wikipedia world.
see the announcement here.
http://ta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contest/en

To upload the photos there are two ways available so far.

1. The web based upload wizard
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:UploadWizard

2. Java based upload tool - Commonist
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Tools/Commonist

We have to provide a detailed filename and description to the images
for uploading.

When we have a bunch of photos to upload, we have to select them,
crop, or edit them before uploading.

Found that that "GThumb Image Viewer" can show the files, edit the
files and add IPTC tags to the images.

We can view,edit,delete,rotate,crop and add the required Description
and Title to the images
for uploading to wikimedia commons.

How to upload the files?
There are two tools already.
But, I wanted to plugin to any image viewer to upload to wikimedia
commons directly.
No image viewer has that plugin.

DigiKam has it, but due to some issues, the mediawiki plugin is not released.

So, I started to write my own script for uploading all the files in a
folder to upload to mediawiki.

Here is it.
http://code.google.com/p/mediawiki-uploader/

Usage details are available in INSTALL and README files.

Thanks for the wikipedia users Surya and Sodabottle for their valuable
suggestions.

Please report if there are any issues.

Provide your suggestions for improving too.

Thanks.

This new editor was mostly written by Trevor Parscal and Inez

away from them for a few months and I have to say I'm extremely
impressed with what they've put together. If you're expecting Google

it's getting easier and easier to add cool features.

Hey MediaWiki developers, surely you're not going to let Trevor and Inez

Check that the file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock is there and owned by root.

if not create an empty file by the following command.

touch /var/lib/apt/lists/lock

then, run sudo apt-get update.

I am pretty sure the opposite should be done. The lock file is created
by apt so that no other concurrent process runs. Remove the lock file
if it exists and retry.

# rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock

However, do so IF AND ONLY IF you are sure that there is not other
instance of apt or synaptic or any such package-manager running. Else
all you will manage to do is get the system in an inconsistent state.

I answered the other part of your question in a prior message. As for
this issue, it could just be that your package list is
corrupt/obsolete. Do an apt-get update and things will work fine.

They have 3 more days left in their fund raising effort ($2,040 raised

edit the policy files, which are then distributed to all the servers. The
package also includes a keylogger plug-in, which can capture all the
actions within a Sudo session. With this plug-in, an administrator could
find out what a user did during a particular session, or who issued a
specific command at a particular time. The package can also produce reports
of who has privileged access, and what programs they can run. The software
can be run from the command line, so it can be incorporated into
administrator scripts.

Nice to know but it is a commercial product.

I suppose the sudoers file(s) can be distributed other ways too.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] perl tutorial XIII (some OO)
Message-ID: <CALDskyzmUQNFdh3e21sWwVvFMr5yo8V2D6d+ALkkdf51zoJjhw@mail.gmail.com>

Object oriented coding is not my cup of tea.

So ideally this section should be handled by someone else in the LUG crowd.

But since perl knowledge is not very high I will volunteer this time.

By the way you can attend my upcoming talk day after tomorrow. It is a
nice big hall that can accommodate a lot of people.

Please be there by 9am day after(18th Sunday). It is TalentSprint
right next to Gaudia Mutt in Royappetah opposite
Ponnusamy hotel and it is around 5 mins walk from Music academy.

Anyway now back to perl coding.

OO is not something with which you can bullshit and gain respect like
people tend to do with deep networking or crypto concepts.

It is a practical tool which is very useful for programming and of
course design.

The main purpose of OO is as they say information hiding or scaling.
Many programming languages including perl does not implement this
 hiding business all that well. This is not to say that you can't do OO with C.

In fact Objective C used in apple products is supposed to be  C with OO.

But even without that, just plain ANSI C can do OO albeit in a crude way.

We can use structures and pointers.

But why talk about C structures and pointers in a perl OO article?

Reason is simple.

In perl, OO Is implemented using hashes and references.

A Perl hash is roughly equivalent to a C structure.

A C structure can be opaque and can hold anything within it. More
structs, integers, strings, arrays and so on.

Of course in C there is no string data structure.

In higher level languages the only data structure people use by
default is a string.

Everything in higher level scripting languages is a string.

Anyway now a hash table or a hash or a dictionary or an associative
array or a structure is nothing but a bunch of
 key value pairs.

A key can be just a name , in the case of C it is a variable name; in
perl it is an explicit name given to retrieve the value.

It could be a string or an integer.

The value is what counts. The value is what is stored in the hash and
that is our interest.

Obviiously in a perl hash we can store anything as a value.

Yesterday we saw how we could store an array reference as a value.

This is because every value in a hash table is a single entity.

It cannot be plural.

In other words in mathematical terms, it is a into mapping. One to one.

Anyway let us take a simple hash table.

%foo = ( name => "girish", sex => "male", exp => 20, designation =>
"engineer", runcode => $funcref);

Here is a simple record for the person girish.

The most interesting part is the runcode => $funcref.

Say,

sub func {

            print " I am inside the func";
}

&func;

will call it.

Now I can get a refrence:

$funcref = \&func;

You can call the function by

&$funcref;

Since all references are singular values and since you can hide any
aggregate data inside it,
 all references can be  a hash table value.

Consider:

%foo = ( name => "test", coderef => $funcref, array =>
[2,3,4,"nothing"], hashref => { 1 => "hash", 2 => "bar", name =>
"hashref" });

Now you can see that a hash can be formed with anything inside it.

Now you can get a reference to this complex hash.

$r = \%foo;

Now you can claim that $r is an object with a strong, a function, an
array and a hash.

This is the most basic idea of an object.

You hide what is inside the object by a reference, since it is just
like a C pointer. It can hold any address.

And you can always retrieve each object member by using a key.

The other aspect of an object is the lack of order. No sequencing.

This is also true of hash tables. No ordering.

Today we have seen a lot of theory.

Tomorrow we will see some real OO examples.

[personalOpinion]
Objective C is a completely different language. While the goal was to
add OO to C, the syntax seems foreign to me. I find it strange that
you chose Objective C over C++ to demonstrate Object Orientation added
to C :P

Yes. :D There is a complete (free) book about it.

Isn't this Perl specific? Are you referring to the weakly typed nature
of some scripting languages? Lists, dictionaries and even tuples
and Sets are used very frequently in Python

Uh? Where in C is a variable name a first-class type? Do you mean a
symbol-type in lisp-esque languages (and I suppose it is something
similar in Perl)?

Minus the dangerous pointer arithmetic?

In hash tables, this is true because the hashing function (ideally)
should distribute the keys uniformly. Is it true for any object?

Great. Sorry if some of the issues I raised here betrayed my
ignorance. I am just trying to get things a little clearer. I am a
Perl noob but am comfortable in other scripting languages like Lua,
Ruby and Py.

Inaguration
To: mailinglist at fsftn.org, jec-lug at googlegroups.com


We all have the dream for serving the community we live.
Sometimes we donate money, sometimes cloths.
Sometime we contribute to Free Open Source Software by writing code,
documenting, meeting, spreading the freedom and more.

Some people teach to poor students. They give free education to them.
Some people donate books and notes.
Some people takes care of their education expenses.

Still, the free education for poor students with quality is a dream in
most places.
The government schools are so pathetic as they can?t give quality education.

It is the time for proving our contributions towards quality free education.

Most of us may having a dream for helping the students by teaching
them, by giving the quality materials and computer with internet
access.

Here, some energetic young people, join together to make their dreams
into reality.

The Free Software Foundation TamilNadu [ http://fsftn.org ], had the
dream of starting Community Computing Center, where the poor students
can walkin and learn what they need from the skillful volunteers.

Punnagai ? The Community Computing Center was started at Mylapore,
Chennai on last sunday, Dec 11, 2011
This center serves the nearer poor students to learn their school
subjects, and computer.
A computer with linux and internet connection is provided for their usage.

Volunteers are  from FSFTN team, IIT Madras, corporates and local people.

They take care of the center and for the mentor-ship of the students.

All the services are provided for free.

Mr.Udhayan, from TamilNadu Science Forum, initiated the event with his
wishes.
4 Local students joined the center and all the volunteers cheered them
up with their interest for helping.

Shanu, Welkin, Sibi and other volunteers proceeded with their talks.

This service need to be spread across the country.
Each village should have such a center with educated, motivated volunteers.

Announcement Page:

Please contact Welkin:9962240050,  Shanu:9884792347
If you are interested in starting such a center in your area.

Thanks a lot for the FSFTN team for their great service to the community.

Friends.

Thanks for your support and encourages in tamil e-magazine for foss.

Now, I am looking for any free online workflow management system to
manage the tasks.

The flow will be like this.

A author joins the project.
He submits the written or translated article
proof reader reads it and fixes it with proper images/links etc
editor approves the article
designer collects approved article and adds in the file for magazine
designer releases the pdf file
proof reader checks the file
editor approves it
release manager releases it.

There may be some more tasks too.

Anyone should join the project and they can take any task they want.
team members should get email alert for the activities.
File attachments should be there.

Looking for your suggestions.

Which one suits for this project?

code.google.com
launchpad
github

any other suggestions?

Thanks.

How?

Author submits article.
Editor checks article and reviews it or gets it reviewed.
If it is otherwise OK, then proof reader comes into picture.
It will be for the author to make any modifications.

I would think, a simple bug tracker like mantisbt would just suffice, 
initially. Author could create a bug and attach his document. From there 
on, the team can jump in and do everything you have mentioned over that 
particular bug/ticket. Everyone works independently on their 
workstations and use the bug tracker as platform for integrating their 
work with the e-magazine.

Nope, just define one using typedef such as,

#define true 1
#define false 0
typedef int bool;

a VPS as I understand it is a share on a server which as far as the user
is concerned is a full server with root access. The only thing one
cannot do in most VPSs is install a new distro. One can upgrade to a new
release of the installed distro. Dotcloud does not even give shell
access, let alone root access.

Unless you are dealing with an ancient compiler, answer is yes. <stdbool.h>
defines standard macros that takes care of compatibility issues too in case
you are using old code that defines 'bool' differently.

This explains its usage and advantages:

In many cases, You can re-image your VPS with a new distro. It should be 
pretty much the same as removing your VPS and creating a new one.

Dotcloud does provide a shell but I highly doubt that it will be bash or 
any other full fledged shell.

Not quite. VPSes, whether achieved using Paravirtualization (like Xen) or
using Compartmentalization (like OpenVZ) limits / binds one to the same
kernel but everything else above it can be changed. For instance, in
OpenVZ, it is possible to run fedora / ubuntu / centos / etc., all on the
same physical machine.

C99 has bool datatype. Older compilers don't have that. You can use Bool in
case of gcc (when using C89 standard). It is better to go with bool (and
C99) if you are not going to use multiple (or older) compilers.

Since C defines any non-zero value as true, rather than defining true as 1
you better define true as !0. Ie, true is the opposite of false.

This is the only way to ensure that a test against 2 true values will work
in all cases.

This is a bad thing to recommend given that there is a standard header
<stdbool.h> for the same purpose. And since it is C99, it should be
there on any system.

True. Interestingly, I have seen some code bases (Minix?) that use ! !
condition to make sure the value becomes 0 or 1.

For example,

	int a = 113;
	printf("%d\n", !!a);
	
will display 1

It was just a simple code snippet to indicate bool can be quickly added. 
I agree, it should not be used exactly as mentioned since the naming is 
too generic. OP can chose whether to use stdbool.h or add 3 lines to his 
code, to me this is just a moot point.

If you meant to say
#define true !0

that is not going to work. Checking true against a variable with non-zero
value will still fail. [ if(a == true) is same as if(a == !0) which will
fail]

C99 booleans automatically converts all values to one or zero according to
standard rules before storing it in the variable. Therefore they should be
used in preference to defining our own and using integers as kludge.

No, C99 and stdbool.h are much more than that. It simply defines bool to be
_Bool which is not same as integer typedef you define.
_Bool is a full fledged boolean variable that can convert other values to 1
or 0 when stored according to standard rules in a transparent way. In fact
one need not use stdbool.h if one is happy with typing _Bool. (but not
recommended)

No. It is very important to stick to the standard. In C's rationale,
existing code is extremely important while existing implementations
are not. [1]. Therefore, #defines like this still work and probably
will work for eternity. 

But standards are established for a reason. They define the interface
or guarantees that are offered by the language. A language MyBreakyC
may choose to define 1 to be true and 0 false in one implementation
and the other way around in another. The programmer is expected to use
names like true and false to stay safe.

I suppose you mean _Bool to be a datatype (not variable). I was under 
the impression that it was all done in the headers but apparently not. 
Its nice to know there is a boolelan datatype. Although, it is wierd 
they chose _Bool instead of bool. I guess, that would break code which 
had already defined a bool macro. Talk about legacy stuff...

As someone said, a mistake in programming leads to lifelong support. ;-)
Other datatypes defined such are _Complex, and _Imaginary.

If using a document management system or content management system
fits in to your plans, you may consider KnowledgeTree, which has
configurable workflows. If you are already on Drupal, you may look at
the module "workflow", which lets you control various stages before an
article is published.

Since you are going to use the system for holding the articles for
publication into a pdf document ultimately, in either of the above
systems, defining a workflow state "approved for publishing" as the
final state, instead of "published", should serve the purpose.

Message-ID: <CACm7z1aQnxP1hB34oZmaMNGuYfbOM8nnCSohE48Hj_v2PwMkQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear luggies,

One of my friend is running his laptop powered with LinuxMint 11 + dual
boot windows and he uses Reliance Broadband + USB Modem manufactured my ZTE
corporation for internet connection.

According to his Data plan when some data limit is reached, the speed of
connection will drop from 3.1 Mbps to 256 kbps.

When the speed drops, he is unable to get internet connection in linux and
he can access internet via windows in the same laptop using the Front-end
developed for the modem.

Now whats happening? What should be the problem? How can this be resolved?

He feels like just for this reason i need to switch to windows (he wants a
solution for this in linux).

Even i have tried in my laptop running fedora 16 updated till date and
modem gets detected, configuration done, yet not getting connected.

Thanks in advance :-)

I am not sure if this is the case in your scenario, but seems logical to
put this forward:
The speed drop is not bandwidth control. It is actually because the
connection itself switches to a different technology (Broadband+ and High
speed 1x in my case). To switch the modem to connect using the lower speed
technology might be a proprietory AT command. Since the Windows front end
can do this for you, it is able to connect in low speed.

Arun

IIRC, Unison is a repository sync utility and not a back up utility
alone. Rsync would be a back up utility as it backs up from a primary
store to a secondary store. Unison is a two way sync using rsync as
the underlying mechanism. The two repositories, thus would be peers
and would be brought to the same state.

Unison operating in abck up mode is a special case.

Pros:
    1. Multiple history levels
    2. Great for text-only stuff
Cons:
    1. Binaries aren't handled well. I remember reading that rsync's
    delta algo works pretty well for these.
    2. You normally need information only 1 version deep. Backups are
    used to recover if for some reason the hard-disk fails
    3. Space consumption will be waaaay more given that you have so
    many versions
    
If you are still interested, search for phoenixfs on github. Ramkumar
Ramachandra [artagnon], implemented a versioning file-system based on
git.

rdiff-backup uses this and it works great as a general purpose backup
system.

Eg Using rdiff-backup on Windows I have more than 300 revisions of our
production Tally server backed up. Each backup set size is ~200MB, and my
entire repo is only ~500MB.

Hi everyone,

We'll be hosting our next Ubuntu User Days on January Saturday the
14th - Sunday the 15th 2012.

"User Days was created to be a set of courses offered during a one day
period to teach the beginning or intermediate Ubuntu user the basics

In order for this event to be a success, we need instructors to lead
sessions.

To volunteer to lead a session, you can contact a member of the Ubuntu
User Days Team by sending an email to myself (lyz at ubuntu.com), the
ubuntu-classroom at lists.ubuntu.com mailing list or by contacting us on
IRC by stopping by #ubuntu-classroom-backstage on irc.freenode.net.

If you are unsure of a topic for your session, you can visit the
Course Suggestions page:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDaysTeam/CourseSuggestions

If you are unsure about expectations for class instructors, please
ask! You may also visit the logs from past Ubuntu User Days:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDaysTeam/natty
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDaysTeam/maverick
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDaysTeam/lucid

Please be sure to pass this announcement along to any of your friends
who might be interested in leading a session.

Thanks everyone!

*1. Prasanna* ? explained about what causes the power regression in mobile
devices running latest linux kernels.
The reason is due to ASPM being turned off by default for those devices
which is not ASPM compatible and forcing ASPM on this device would cause
battery life problems. One main issue is the hardware are now made windows
specific which makes devices not to support ASPM of Linux kernel.

He also explained about the application

*2. Prakash* ? explained about how easy, fast and handy to use FFMPEG
encoder/decoder to convert audio and video formats.
He showed a live demo of how to convert a video into sequence of images and
also to convert sequence of images into a video.
Converting a video to sequnce of images:

*  ffmpeg -i input_video_file.flv images/Screenshot%d.png*

In the above command -i indicates input file and the video can be of any
format you have. ?images? is the directory created and ?Screenshot%d?
indicates the output filename with prefix Screenshot and %d will be
replaced by the number for every images generated.
You can specify any image output format, here we have specified .png format.

Subject: [Wikitech-l] Please Welcome Yuvaraj Pandian & Max Semink
To: <wmfall at lists.wikimedia.org>, "Wikimedia developers" <
wikitech-l at lists.wikimedia.org>

Greetings all,

The Mobile and Special Projects department is pleased to announce the
addition of two new contractors to the team: Yuvaraj Pandian and Max
Seminik.

Yuvaraj Pandian or Yuvi as we gotten to know him was one of our 2011
Google Summer of Code students. During GSoC he worked with Arthur
Richards on porting the Wikipedia 1.0 bot to a PHP extension named
Selection Sifter. This was in important offline project as it allowed
us to better support and extend our offline tool chains. Previous to
this he had been active in the busroutes.in community where users
@logic and @planemad motivated him to come on and help the Wikimedia
community. One of his early Wikimedia project memories includes the
tawiki community discussing the ShortUrl extension. He found the
entire channel so lively and helpful that he applied for GSoC.

Yuvi will be working for us remotely while on a six month sabbatical
from KCG College of Technology, India. He'll be extending the Android
app, enhancing MobileFrontend, and working with our various offline
efforts to further the reach of the projects. You can find him on irc
under the nick 'yuviapanda' .

Max Semink has been an active MediaWiki contributor since 2009. He's
recently been most involved in developing the API Sandbox for
MediaWiki. An extension that allows any user to easily create complex
API queries through a visual interface. When not hacking on MediaWiki,
Max has been busy developing C++ software for embedded systems in the
railroad industry. While train switching has captured the majority of
his recent developer cycles, he's super eager to change direction and
focus his full time efforts on MediaWiki.

Max will be continuing his interest in the API by helping us improve
and extend its use within mobile. He'll be adding a proper API to
MobileFrontend, extending support for GPS, and in general moving the
API forward for our mobile clients. Max will be working for us
remotely and can be found under the nick 'MaxSem' .

It's great to be able to see two active community members be able to
join us full time.

Please join me in (re)-welcoming Yuvi and Max!

Hi all,

It was a almost a unimaginable surprise when I heard a Samsung camera
has a Tamil interface! See pic[1]. It is important milestone when
Indic is starting to reach beyond computers, mobiles. While this also
reinforces the Indic growth theory(not just wikimedia in non-profit
space, even for business in for-profit space), it also means more work
for those who are working on Indic space (translation, content
creation,technology). Their work will directly or indirectly reach
more people outside wikimedia projects. Projects like wiktionary will
be source for many languages which might not have any other largest
source of?vocabulary elsewhere. I would not be surprised if in future
translations for real world things are done openly through projects
like translatewiki :)

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] shifting gears to shell scripting
Message-ID: <CALDskyxSK+toDLkWA6PxuhGAvQQX0P0-D6cz1ywKSq3Ob0n6rQ@mail.gmail.com>

Shell scripting is as related to perl programming as a knife is
related to a sword.

But that is not to say that perl is always superior to shell scripting.

Many things that shell scripts can do is unnatural to do with perl.

As is the common case the language proficiency determines the choice
rather than the appropriateness
 of the situation in question.

A simple shell script is written like this:

#!/bin/sh

print "Hello World";

Not like this:

#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello World";

Bash is not universal. It is also not a good shell to learn shell
scripting. And please avoid
 tcsh or csh.

ksh is what you have to use.

Anyway we will focus on shell scripting and leave the argument to
those who like to waste time.

Now, a really nice effect I like to show to students learning shell
scripts is this:

$ cat i.sh
#!/bin/sh

for i in `jot 10 1 10`
do
        echo "Your tea is getting ready!"
        sleep 1
done

This won't work in Linux. You have to replace jot with seq and tweak it.

for loops in shell are an iterator construct. Just like in perl.

Only while gives you looping in shell.

An iterator is just a way to go over a list of values one by one.

For instance,

for foo in 1 3 3l4 something "nothing else"
do
         echo $foo
done

will go over each value one by one.

And in shell scripts each value is delimited by a space or a newline.

This is how UNIX works and UNIX utilities work.

No big wonder here.

We sometimes don't like it. We don't want to lose newlines. I will tell you
 what to do about that later.

For now, shell scripting requires that you know the various UNIX utilities like:

sleep
cut
grep
find
ls
date
su
tail
head

Take your time to learn them.

Apple Abuses Patent System Again To Obstruct W3C Open Standard
from the getting-to-be-a-habit dept

Apple has been garnering quite a reputation for itself as a patent
bully, for example using patents around the world in an attempt to
stop Samsung competing in the tablet market, and bolstering patent
trolls. But that's not enough for the company, it seems: now it wants
to use patents to block open standards.

As befits an organization that seeks to promote the Web, the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has a clear policy on the use of patents in
its standards:

    In order to promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C
seeks to issue Recommendations that can be implemented on a
Royalty-Free (RF) basis. Subject to the conditions of this policy, W3C
will not approve a Recommendation if it is aware that Essential Claims
exist which are not available on Royalty-Free terms.

Message-ID: <CALDskyzixPYoSvrk24=herVpCtEFp+Kyyk=oPeH-mP4bPpyWVQ@mail.gmail.com>

A shell is a covering with nothing substantial inside like sea shells
from which
 the word came.

In the UNIX world shells are meant to say something other than the kernel.

But in reality it is not just the shell and kernel. There are many
other entities.

The C library called glibc in the Linux duniya and the libc in UNIX,
the binutils
 package which is part of the OS base system and several other pieces
go towards
 making a complete system.

And then people say that Linux is just a kernel and that you need GNU
utilities and
 packaging to make a Linux distro.

Linux is  a brand and a commonly understood word to mean anything
related to UNIX.

Most people think UNIX is academic and old and that everything they
say today is one of
 the various incarnations and cousins of Linux.

This is not correct and I will stop at that. Let us see shell scripting.

You have different ways to count in shell scripts. I used to use the
expr command. It is messy.

Then I learnt the let command. It is nice.

You are free to use other UNIX command line utilities too. Every shell
comes with what are
 known as "shell built ins".

Typically ls,date,pwd and so on are shell builtins.

And every shell also has command line editing features like auto
completion, history, line
yanking, killing and so on.

Bash has made a lot of innovations in this area and it is a really huge shell.

ksh has many of the good features of bash without the bloat and the bugs.

You are free to stick to bash for learning and then when you graduate
you can start using ksh.

Now, let us look at a simple while loop with counting. As I said, for
is only an iterator. It is not a
 real loop like while.

$ cat i.sh
let i=100

while [ $i -gt 0 ];
do
        echo $i
        let i--
done

This is a nice way to iterate with a while loop.

I repeat.

for takes a list of values beforehand and runs the loop thro' them
like list of files or
 list of numbers or list of strings or a combination.

while has a condition like in C and runs the loop infinitely till the
condition is true.

The expression

[ $i -gt 0 ];

is nothing but the test command.

$ man test

Instead of [], we can also use test.

Depending on the true value, while runs.

And both for and while rely on the body being enclosed in

do
done

There are two more constructs with a body.

Obviously they are conditionals and not loops.

if [ $i -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "i is equal to 0"
fi

The loop terminator is the keyword in reverse.

Similarly with switch statement.

case $i in
...
esac

We will see the case statement later.

It is the only shell thing that understands regular expressions.

Let us finish with one more way to do counting. As I said with expr.

$ cat i.sh
i=100

while [ $i -gt 0 ];
do
        echo $i
        i=`expr $i - 1`
done

If you leave out the spaces or include spaces where you shouldn't it won't work.

Execute it exactly the way you see it.

For some time I was thinking about the purpose of WHATWG, the group
that promotes HTML5 and all other standards that make web application.
The last time I digged around them, W3C seem to have Microsoft
sympathizers and WHATWG seem to have Apple, Google sympathizers.
Native apps on iOS and Android are important for Apple and Google. And
interestingly WHATWG, the group that splintered from W3C on XHTML
issues, and promoted HTML5, is not involved in touch events ? Or that
only W3C is being sued ?

While Mozilla, Opera, Safari, Chrome et all other than IE are moving
with WHATWG (the live standard concept making a release every 6 weeks
or so), shouldn't we be focusing whether touch events are available on
WHATWG ?

With a larger controversy between W3C and WHATWG looming around, this
micro-controversy on W3C makes me skeptical on this controversy
itself.

Message-ID: <CAFoeR8UDGgvZA1f8k2YqKF_uKVhOawOS=zFt=4HybuyvQy3+sQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I am Karthik Raj doing my final year B.E. I am working on a project
based on *Speech Recognition* that attempts to capture voice and produce
appropriate text which in turn further processed to other language voice
outputs. My team has started working on converting voice in Tamil to Tamil
text. Project is an open source.


   - Can you suggest me about which language or a tool will be reliable to
   do this task?
   - Also how to proceed with my project?
   - Any ideas that would help...

Thanks in advance.

Hi

CMU Sphinx is a Public Domain Software for Speech Recognition.
cmusphinx.sourceforge.net
If you are familiar with java you can work on this. Also it has some Python
bindings too .
The web page of CMU Sphinx gives good tutorials on how to build a Speech
Recognition system for your language.

this is how the 3G service is offered.  I dont know about reliance.  but 
when i went through Airtel 3G plans, they said, that after some data

Message-ID: <1324376541.9163.36.camel@xlquest.web>

hi,

for development purposes I have a number of websites running under name
virtual hosts on my laptop. Setup: mysite.web, in /etc/hosts:

127.0.0.1    mysite.web

front end is nginx listening on port 80 with a name virtual host proxied
to another webserver  that actually runs the app on ports 8000 onwards.
This works fine as long as there is an internet connection - if there is
no internet connection, firefox barfs saying it cannot access the net
and find the site. There is no problem if I run an IP based virtual host
- but then I can only run one site at a time. In the old days firefox
had an option like - 'these are local sites, no need for internet'. (or
was that netscape? Any suggestions?

Or using subdomain ? Like,

In the former case nginx must listen on 8000, 8001 and 8002 ports, in
the later case,
you may need to add the following lines in /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1 ? ?mysite1.web
127.0.0.1 ? ?mysite2.web
127.0.0.1 ? ?mysite3.web

As I said before I am not sure I understand the situation ...

Did you try with good old telnet ? Also, check whether you have any 
proxies in firefox settings. In your case, since there are multiple 
levels before you get the page, it might be better to debug step by step 
using curl (or something similar).

If you know the remapping rules, you should first try sending the 
requests to your app running on port 8000+ with proper headers and make 
sure it works. It might not a simple task but might help in debugging 
greatly. And, If your app works, then you can try checking whether nginx 
rules are correct and whether the remapping to your app works correctly.

let us make it simpler. Forget all the virtual host stuf and nginx etc.
To replicate the bug just do this on a standalone machine:

1. in /etc/hosts add the line:

127.0.0.1   mysite.web

2. make sure apache is running and listening on 80

3. In any browser try to access mysite.web - you will either get the
default apache page or whatever you have put as your default site.

4. Disconnect your internet connection

5. Clear browser cache

6. try to access mysite.web (you can ping it, but cannot access it
through a browser - I have tried firefox and links)

freetts is an open source project for English. I am not sure whether it
supports Tamil (or any other language). It can be used with Java and if I
remember correctly with C also. sphinx is also a good one. Speech to text
is really an interesting project. All the best guys. If you know the basics
of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and good in mathematics then this is
right for you.

Note: A lot of Indian names appears in
http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/research/. Indians are good in these
core technologies too :) :)

Try using wvdial with correct configuration. Usually the device name will
be /dev/ttyUSB0 (for a tata photon plus device I used). If it works then
make a script and run it as needed. It may be a problem of network manager.
If it works with wvdial then report the issue to network manager guys and
they will fix it.

If wvdial did not work:
Try with different plans available in the list (instead of the correct
one). This may work if your device switches to a different technology. Your
net connection may work. But it may cause some trouble like higher billing
rate so use it for some 4 hours and check the bill amount in net to make
sure you are not billed higher. If you are billed properly then yeah this
is the solution. But to my knowledge they won't change to a different
technology.

          It works(i.e. the default page loads) for me with the
suggested scenario. I am on Debian. I had setup mysite.web to
127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts, accessed the site from firefox, disconnected
my LAN cable, cleared the cache, and was able to access it again. To
double check, I accessed mysite.web from w3m as well when the LAN
cable was disconnected and it works. Thanks

I am guessing, when disconnected, NetworkManager disabled lo as well or 
did something similar. Unless we spend some time debugging, it will be 
hard to explain why it happens. Also, I have experienced quirky issues 
such as these with NetworkManager before and they are not worth debugging.

Probably it puts Firefox in offline mode? Check for that.

Apparently, they are not known for their customer support, atleast when 
it comes to not-so-big corporations.

I meant Fedora guys who work for Redhat - they are not bound to support

 Hi
        There is also another Tool for speech recognition   named HTK ..But
the problem is it will work perfectly for English..and i can also handle
the Unicode fonts...so if you are working with Tamil Characters of Unicode
you can work on it. try  to download HTK book and also for Fundamental of
Speech recognition by L Rabiner it will give idea of Speech Recogntion..
.at the same Sphinx is also a good tool for Speech recognition...

It might be worthwhile to mention the details of your hardware e.g.

CPU -- blah, blah
Chipset -- blih, blih

AFAIK, the manufacturers have different hardware configs for the same
model.  Besides, expecting the community to find out such details is
unfair IMO.

Also, it might be worthwhile to mention the name and version number of
the distros you have tried so far.

> Any solutions

Without above info, figuring out your problem and give a solution is a
tall order - just my opinion.

dnsmasq is another suspect in such scenarios - is it installed and running?

Some systems fails to read from cd/dvd during installation. This may be
simple, but just give a try by installing via usb pen drive.
Check whether display brightness has gone down, try increasing the display
brightness using the key for it in your laptop.

I have had problems with Nvidia cards. Did you try booting with the 
option "Basic Video Driver" in the Boot menu ? Also, if you are unable 
to find this option, try searching on the web. I am sure there is one 
atleast in fedora.

Use the minimal mode (generic video driver) or text mode to do the

*** Please do not top post ***

You have got a fairly new hardware so I would suggest stick with the
latest versions.(Ubuntu 10.04 might be ancient for your hardware)

try "acpi=off" and/or "noapic" as kernel boot parameters with Kubuntu
and Fedora.

My engineer has bought a laptop with similar config except for the
CPU, which is i5-2430.

Do you have any other operating system in the machine?
Do you see any other screen before the blue/black screen ?
Are you sure the CD drive and the CD you tried really works ?

It might be that the CD/DVDs were burned with Nero in a M$ windows.
There are many related reports about that.

Subject: [Ilugc] [TIP] some shell ideas
Message-ID: <CALDskyzg+q2SuY8g2-8e6kh4tR7K0u1kWt+6hxuOsSVdm4hZWw@mail.gmail.com>

Shell scripting is not just programming.

It is a bunch of things that one knows to do effective work
 from the command line.

One can do good shell scripting only after a rich UNIX experience
 which takes some 4 years.

You need to know all the fancy UNIX command line tools which you
can invoke from a script or even directly from the shell.

Before you proceed to shell scripting per se you can just play
 with the shell to get some basic facilities byheart that help you
  with day to day tasks.

For example,

$ history

will give you list of commands executed previously.

Bash will give you history from the last login session. ksh will not.

But nobody uses this command these days.

Just press the up arrow and you can cycle thro' all the commands.

Also <TAB> completion is nice.

Just type the first letter or first two letters of a command or file name
 and press the <TAB> key. It will complete the rest of the command for you.

You can look at the shell environment with the set command.

$ set

You can find out certain basic things like

$ echo $HOME

$ echo $USER

$ echo $SHELL

You can set the prompt with

$ export PS1=foo>

You can find these silly things in any book on UNIX.

You can do line editing with:

Ctrl-a to go to beginning of line

Ctrl-e to go to end of line

Ctrl-K to kill the line

Ctrl-r will do a reverse search on command history

Remember certain things.

Shell variables do not actually get exported to the child shells till you
actually export them.

Every shell script starts a new shell which is the child of the parent
shell where
 you type commands.

So you have to export variables to make the variables show up in child shells
as well.

You also have functions in shell scripting.

$ function foo {
>  echo "how are you?"
> }
$ foo
how are you?

The '>' and '$' was not typed by me.

Touch screen is mostly a matter of hardware. If you build a web application
/ use an existing suitable free software app and slap a skin on it, you got
what you wanted. But if you asked me, frankly, I would be wary of employing
someone who claims to have done such a project. Why not something real /
challenging?

You must have seen http://www.autonlab.org/autonweb/14661.html
The paper is fairly clear.
It will be very easy to implement in R as most of it is available.
RWeka has a version of X-means.  So it must be a built-in in weka.

But what are you trying to do?

modify the information criterion?

I prefer "pgrep -x <app name>"  -x matches the exact name of the application.

Girish ,

Instead of talking about if and while in shell, which is present in
every programming language ( Anyone with some programming knowledge
should be able to figure this out in no time), why not talk about
regular expression and sed and awk.  which are more intresting than
looping constructs.

C programming is something everyone in India learns; at least whoever
has studied any of the core branches.

And many may not know how to compile and run a C program in a Linux box.

Here are some utter basics.

$ cat i.c
#include <stdio.h>
int
main() {
  printf("Hello World\n");
}

$ make i

or

$ gcc i.c

will get you the result.

The output file is either in i or a.out.

You can do a

$ ls -ltr

to figure out the latest file created.

Of course you should not compile C on UNIX without knowing some basic
UNIX commands.

A compiler like gcc only converts the source code of C into assembly.
You need a linker(ld) and an assember
 like gas to convert the assembly to machine code that is executed in the CPU.

Now C coding is about thinking a lot and not just getting your job
done without programming hassle.

In fact it is impossible to do C coding without design skills and no
high level design can be done without C coding
 experience.

In fact C is a language that demands an extremely high degree of
commitment, intellect and experience.

However most people seem to know many basic C programming concepts and
have experience running C code.

As to the IT industry I think any IT company in India depends on C
only as much as 20% or so.

Rest of the people get on with peripheral skills.

Just adding to that, I've found that -Wall switch is very useful for
finding silly errors that might creep in, so it makes sense to compile
every C program with that switch on. And -g is useful if the compiled
executable is to be debugged at a later stage.

Both these switches are applicable to g++ too, and has the same meaning.

Hope that helps :)

Ask him to join the list and let his ask his queries :-)

What kind of help he need?
Did he install the sphinx and test it?

ask him to contact the irc and develop mailing list of sphinx
for any coding assistance in sphinx.

Ask him to read

          This is something I was about to say, but Shrini raced ahead
:) We find a lot of people posting questions on the list in their
effort to help their friends with FOSS related software/OS. But what
they don't realise is, when they post their friends questions/issues,
they get the solutions and try it/implement it in their friends'
computers. The problem does get solved. But what's missing is, their
friends never get to know how the solution was arrived at, and all the
thought process that went into it.

        If you could request you friend to join the list, hs/she would
definitely learn a lot more from the day to day activities/mails in
the list. And may be, in due course can become an active FOSS
contributor as well :) So please invite/persuade them to join the
list. Thanks

Ashwin,

Please don't see it as simple if construct.  There are lot of attention
required while used to evaluate expressions .

On a related tool, way back in my days as a developer, we used lint
(to remove all warnings and errors) before submitting our code to the
build queue (vt100 terminals connecting to the main frame over 1200
bps dial up lines)

A search for the same coughed up 'splint'  [1]  which looks very promising.

internal mail server).

I opened it directly through browser, and cleared all the mails, both
inbox & sent items, and closed it and went home, happily !!!!.

Next day when I opened the thunderbird 7, i was shocked to find all
the mails - inbox & sent were gone !!!!.

I need ideas - what could have gone wrong, to avoid the same happening
next time. Please guide.

you are synchronising mails, so if you remove from the server, it will
get removed at your end. And vice versa.

On monday 19th - many mails inbound to my email id got bounced - due

Hello

While configuring either thunder bird or web client, by mistake, you may have chosen the option which enables user to delete mails stored in the client when deleting the mails from the server and vice versa. This option is available with the thunder bird.

I do not know enough of java to do that. From what I understand, I need
to set the location of the jdk in the classpath. Jdk is here:
/usr/java/jdk1.6.0_30

As per the message the env variable is not set or is not pointing to the
right path. Can you
validate it and get back?

Note: even if you install packages the variable sometimes does not get set.

Yesterday The Federal Communications Commission issued a Public Notice
announced that they approved Spectrum Bridge Inc.?s television white spaces
database system, which may provide service to devices beginning January
26,2012.

By the use of VHF and UHF TV channels can provide connectivity faster than
WiFi so it can handle more data. It can bring (nearly) free Internet access
to the most remote areas of the country,
FCC Announcement :

Unused spectrum between TV stations ? known as ?white spaces? - represents
a valuable opportunity for
provision of broadband data services in our changing wireless landscape.
This unused TV spectrum provides
a major new platform for innovation and delivery of service, with potential
for both research and commercial
applications. Development of unlicensed radio transmitting devices has
already led to a wave of new
consumer technologies, including Wi-Fi and other innovations like digital
cordless phones and in-home
video distribution systems that have generated billions of dollars of
economic growth. This new technology
will build on that track record and provide even more benefits to the U.S.
economy.

Hi Siji,

Otherwise, the text reads as though you are making the statement
(which it is not).

The announcement is US centric; people in India may not be able to
enjoy the benefit outlined in the announcement until the GoI adopts a
similar policy.

Dear Sir,

I too had been using Evolution more and only changed to Thunderbird -
in the last 6 - 7 months. Found it was OK, but now thinking of
changing back to evolution once again.

sir, will it support multiple accounts.

Thanks sir,

Message-ID: <CALoDM-EFm5rGJW7yBxQUrxMaAz3h7YeB+j57pL5BjH1sYK3nrQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

     This is for gentoo users who have experienced it.If you are new to
gentoo, take a look at here,

     *http://www.gentoo.org/*

and get latest gentoo 11.2 from

*    http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/where.xml*

     Try this link to install gentoo live dvd into hard-disk.This live dvd
comes with almost necessary multimedia and development applications default.

   *http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Install_LiveDVD_11.2_to_hard_disk_drive*

  Why this means?

- Installation is one of the most toughest part in gentoo and linux users
avoiding gentoo because of the installation.

- Gentoo uses *portage *packaging system which is based on  *BSD*-style by
compiling source code of packages.To make a  complete system with the
packages like X11, gnome , kde will take long-time.

 Try this, reach me if you have any problems.

I use Reliance Datacard and the hardware manufacturer is ZTE. I use it in
Ubuntu and it is just plug and play. In Mac I had some trouble but the App
on the reliance website works fine. My suggestion would be, find the model
no. of your data card and search for the correct driver and install.
Reliance website has driver for both Linux and Mac.

Try the All-In-One install method, that is very simple.

Note: Some of the libraries/tools used by NS2 may be old and it may
conflict with latest library/tools available in Ubuntu 11.10.

Dear Sir,

Mr. Kenneth : where & how to disable the synch option - tried google -
but could not find it exactly on this.

Mr. Baskar : automatic configuation on thunderbird.  Just changed the
DNS and other network details.

Mr. Mahalingam : I have tried in both "Account Settings" &
"Preferences" and could not find the disabling the 'Delete mails
stored in client, when deleting the messages in the server"

Your help is being appreciated.

Thanks for taking your time in this.

Hello Mr. Sivakumar

On Thunderbird desktop client(6.0 or 7.0), choose Tools-Account Settings-service settings-Leave Message on server check box(can either be ticked or not ticked according to your option) or leave blank. Until I delete from server check box. That's all.

S.Mahalingam

This does exactly what happened to the OP in the first place, if I'm
guessing right. This option is for those who wants messages to remain
on their server even after they delete it from within the thunderbird
mail client. But if you delete it from the server ( and if IMAP is the
method of message retrieval ) then the messages will be removed from
the server as well as the client during the next sync.

What the OP needs is to set his message retrieval method to POP3.
Evolution or Thunderbird (The choice of MUI) is irrelevant here.

Are you certain that Sun Java components were not automatically
removed ?? Just to clarify.. This is supposed to happen when you run
package upgrades.

Hi,
I  faced this "blue screen " while installing Ubuntu 10.04. I remember a
small change in my BIOS  "harddrive settings" corrected it  . But if you
already have an OS in the Hdd then this change may cause a boot failure.

Regards,
JK

Mr. Yogesh Girikumar :

*>>What the OP needs is to set his message retrieval method to POP3.
>>Evolution or Thunderbird (The choice of MUI) is irrelevant here.*

What you have mentioned here is very apt.  (I wish I had spelt this clearly
in the first time ....)

Mr. Mahalingam :
*
On Thunderbird desktop client(6.0 or 7.0), choose Tools-Account
Settings-service settings-Leave Message on server check box(can either be
ticked or not ticked according to your option) or leave blank. Until I
delete from server check box. That's all.*

- There is no such thing 'Leave Message on Server - Check box' in the
Account Settings.

- Also 'Account Settings' now is not under "Tools", but under "Edit"
Option.  Why I mention this here, is not to correct YOU, but to tell you
how is the Thunderbird 7, settings here in my Ubuntu 10.04.  Please let me
know, if some thing is wrong in this version.

Still you can help me in this.....

Apologies for jumping in late into this thread.

There is a command "alternatives" which can be used to set and switch
between various java (or for that matter any application) of different
 versions.

I had to fight with this command to set the system for developers who
develop apps across versions of Java, PHP, Python -- Common scenario
for those who develop apps in Centos 4.x/5.x .

HTH in future.

I don't understand what you are stuck with here. You might want to
upgrade to Thunderbird 9.0 ( if you think there is something wrong
with version 7.0) .

If you are looking for alternatives, one mail client that you should
really try is claws mail. It's in the repos.

You can try this: Edit -> Folder Properties -> click on the 'repair
folder' button. (this might get back your mails by chance)

Good ol' advice, before you do anything, BACKUP BACKUP BACKUP your
Thunderbird folder by copying the /home/<user>/.thunderbird folder to
somewhere safe.

do we need 'mercury' to rename a file? Isn't this just 'mv' instead of
'hg mv'?

Above command line is specific to renaming multiple files under
'mercury'. 

We can rename multiple files using another method,

$ for FILE in *.css; do mv "${FILE}" "${FILE%.css}.tss"; done

I just copy pasted the command from my shell window :) since the files
are under version control (Hg) I had to use 'hg mv'

Message-ID: <CAND27951gnOB0PhsDk5SV-sHv=nVObAQMRx+rzuPyfcRQbJ7KQ@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

I am looking for buying a laptop or netbook.

Budget : around 20 k

Looked the netbooks in a laptop shop.

They are so small with 10" screen.

But, sony viao has 11.6" screen which has most wider screen in the tiny devices.

Will the sony viao 11.6" support linux well?


The usage will be browsing, openoffice, python/php coding.


Please share your thoughts on performance/processor/RAM requirements
of netbooks.

Check with dell (Netbook), which will come around to your budget.

But don't work for more hours in netbook which will create an eye problem 
since it has a small screen.

If you have an old monitor you can buy a small netbook and attach the
monitor to it using vga adapter. This will reduce cost, help in reusing
your older device. It may save some 4000 to 5000 Rs in your budget.

Acer hardware is not so good, IMO.

I have an Acer laptop, which STRUGGLES[1] to boot once in a while.
According to their customer care, it's a normal behaviour :-O

[1] While booting up, it emits too much heat, fan rotating with so much
noise and stalls with that.

and more BS - practically every programmer I know has acer, and all of
them (including me) have had no problems at all. My power adapter failed
after 2 years, but thats it. And where else can you get models with
linux (no doubt linpus, but still linux)?

I also have expereinced heating problems with Acer. I found out later that
the graphics card was 'normal' and not (low heat emiting) 'mobility'
version. This was about two years ago.

Okay. I shared MY experience. May be it's a problem with the particular
model I have (Aspire 5745). Or may be, you and those whom you know using
Acer, have been lucky.

Of course, that's a nice thing, but that doesn't have anything to do with
quality of hardware.

He knows better about your laptop's behaviour and your calls to customer
care, than you do. That's why! ;-)

Subject: [ilugd] Looking for an Android Developer for App Dev Contract
To: "Linux Delhi" <ilugd at lists.linux-delhi.org>, <iitdlug at googlegroups.com>

Hi All
I am looking for an android developer with a good understanding of SIP and
how it works on Android to work on a social project on contract.
Just to clarify, I will prefer to work with independent individuals on
this, since
a. the project is ultimately going to be open source
b. I am looking for fast turnaround times (email replies in hours not days
and phone availability at all reasonable hours)
c. This is NOT a high value corporate contract, it is a small research
activity by a very prestigious international organization, so its more
portfolio value than cash value

Please respond with timelines and a quote to deliver the following. Rough
guestimates will do, and please err on the *opposite* side of caution if
err you must.
*
Goal: To develop an Android app that can transfer incoming calls on the SIM
line to a SIP server. *

Suggested approach:

A SIP client that can :
1. Forward incoming calls on a GSM/CDMA (GSM only will do, but CDMA only
will not) line to a SIP number at a proxy on the same LAN
Could use the SIP stack baked into Gingerbread. However it would be even
nicer to be able to do this on an older Android version, so that we can
deploy on cheaper phones.
2. Can use the USB tether line as a transport layer. I am sure this is
baked into the SIP stack on Gingerbread, but it would be important since
Wireless messes with call quality. Same applies for older versions
3. Can take a call from a SIP line and forward it outwards over a SIM line.
This need not be working in the prototype, but the approach should not
negate this
4. MUST be able to transfer DTMF tones from the incoming SIM line and
transfer accurately to the SIP extension. This is a go-nogo
call...everything else working and this not working means no go :)

The prototype will be deployed by techies who understand the meaning of the
word "BETA" so the focus is on functionality not visual appeal or user
experience. Config files and scripts are fine as long as clear instructions
are provided on how to operate.

That's pretty much it, have no restrictions on what you can use as a basis
as long as its free for redistribution along with source code...which I
suppose means you're limited to GPL.

Cheers
Arjun

It depends on what you intend to run on it. If you are going to do a
lot of browsing and minimal office work, or if you want good
portability,  then get a netbook. If you are going to be running
resource intensive apps, if you are going to be watching movies,
playing games, if you need storage space, if you don't mind carrying
something around 3kgs or so in your back pack, go for a laptop.

My recommendations: Dell, Acer, Toshiba, Lenovo.
DO NOT buy: HP, Compaq, Samsung, HCL. (my experiences)
Sony is unnecessarily expensive. So I wouldn't buy it.

If you have reading problems or if your eye isn't healthy, go for a
laptop. Also ask for something that comes with free DOS or Linux by
default. Laptops heat up. Netbooks don't heat up as much. If there are
unusually high numbers of heat vents, you don't want to by that (my
observation). If you are buying dell, buy extended warranty (trust
me).

Buy VT enabled stuff that runs hardware assisted hypervisors better.
Make sure you don't buy a glorified tablet if you're buying a Netbook.

Portability :
  Netbooks can be under 1.5Kg and gives better battery back up. Atom
processor and 10 inch screen comes to rescue here.

Development work :
  I have done decent amount of development work on a netbook. Its your
code, you know the source base well and most of the time you will be
just typing stuff. But to do heavy testing, debugging or hacking an
alien source base, you can connect a big monitor to your netbook.

Browsing :
  If you use less of tabbed-browsing and can remember your tab
windows, you can switch to full screen mode (F11) and get the best out
of your 10 inch screen.

And try to remove the battery, as much as possible, when your
laptop/netbook is plugged in. Gives good battery life.

If this is the only x86 you are gonna have and you are gonna use it
for serious programming, better buy a desktop or spend a little more
for a 14/15 inch laptop.

Cheers,
Pratap

Message-ID: <20111229030141.GA6648@panahar>

I need to use a plugin to display tables based on data from a mysql
database (separate from wordpress's main database). Any suggestions
about which is the most feature rich plugin?

Features that would be useful include options to for visitors to be
able to sort records and export a table as a csv file.  Will be nice
if the plugin allowed some embedded querying facilities that visitors
could use.

I have seen some plugins like datapress, wp-table reloaded, custom
tables. Am looking for feedback on what is the most-feature rich and
most actively developed plugin.

In general, I think, everyone is working towards tablets. And, netbooks almost seem outdated. So, You might be better off spending extra 10k and getting a laptop.

Nevertheless, you can check out Asus netbooks as well, not sure if they are any good.

I am using Dell Inspiron Mini (intel Atom, N 450 processor with 2 GB ram). My dual boot system has Debian Squeeze with MS Win XP. I use bluetooth for net connectivity with Nokia mobile. Battery lasts for 2.5 hours. No major problem.

Subject: [Ilugc] My thin client experience
Message-ID: <CABko9NL5kr8mbkG5k1zromChHZ=mXg9BYpSX1raxDue830ja4g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Thanks to all the folks who gave useful feedback to help me find a suitable
thin client for my business' needs. I just finished taking iTalc on a test
drive. iTalc is quite literally a beautiful educational tool. I wanted to
use the power of computers to visually explain concepts but yet didn't want
to put up an economically and energy-wise expensive projector or a fancy
large screen TV. iTalc filled that very need by providing a means to
control and transmit to the desktops of the LTSP clients.

My needs were:

1. GNU/Linux friendly thin clients that work in an LTSP environment.
2. Low on power consumption: saves power bill, saves cooling needs, cut
down need for a big UPS.
3. Low on desktop foot print: Thin, Small, Simplicity is what I was looking
for. Simply because I don't have a very large space.
4. Self Maintainable (ie,. no
horribly-designed-products-with-3-year-warranty).
5. Gigabit - just so I can be happy to know the network is not my
bottleneck.

What I reviewed:

1. Ncomputing: Bound to their proprietary software - sucks to be forced to
use non-LTSP. But Ncomputing was way cheaper and it did "lure" me since
they are known to "support Linux".
2. Userful: Super simple, Beautiful, Works with most - but I got skeptical
and leaned away.
3. Panache: Awesome line up of products though, most cost effective thin
clients are proprietary. No way to get a look and feel - gotta order and be
happy with whatever I find. I didn't like this very aspect. The good part
about panache was its openness in letting folks purchase their cabinets
alone. But their cabinets are about 2 times more expensive than the
cheapest vanilla Rs.900/- cabinet.
4. Used PC: I tried. I gave up because I didn't want to be living with a
nightmarish infrastructure made up of a diverse mix of PCs of all sizes,
ages and makes. Plus, most of them came with stuff I didn't want - like
hard drives or an AGP. But all disadvantages aside, this seemed to me to be
the most cost effective route- I could have gotten a box-monitor based
setup for Rs.5000/- but that saving will swell other running costs.
5. DIY thin client: I so wanted to do it. but I wasn't sure I was going to
find the time. Little did I know, though, that this route will consume 3
man days in finding the truth behind excellent sounding sales promises by
just about every vendor on Ritchie St.

The review:

IMO: All the factory made products didn't score on the price and the
maintainability front, except Zotac's ID-series. But its availability in
India was a problem. Used PCs weighed low on all my needs except that of
self maintainability and low cost. DIY seemed like the only choice left to
be explored... and this exploration is more than just calling up people ;)

So I was left with the bar on power consumption and foot print. The only
way forward was to come up with the configuration and shop for suitable
cabinets that are small and available in the market for closer inspection.
This is what I ended up with after arriving at Chennai and loitering around
Ritchie St for 3 days.

Thin client configuration:
- Intel D425KT
- 2G DDR3
- 15.6" LED TV
- Zebronics Genesis "slim" cabinet
- KB+Mouse

The cost of this setup turned out to be about Rs.9,100/- though if one
wasn't as specific about desktop space usage or energy usage, a setup as
cheap as Rs.6,000/- could have been achieved using old CRTs instead of the
LED that sank 3.3K.

The server and its karma:

The LTSP server used to be a Home Audio Studio DAW  in its previous birth.
I chose this because this was the best box I had on hand. I chose edubuntu
11.04 because LTSP worked out of the box (My erstwhile studio sports an i5
Quad core with a DH57DD motherboard. I upgraded this rig to add 8G more RAM
and bought two new 500G SATA 2 drives for RAID).

I also test drove the power of the jack audio framework and realized it is
possible to use LTSP to _do_ stuff like what real studios do (one person
doing the drums, one singing, another doing the bass, another playing a
real instrument and one mixing it all together live. One Helluva Free
Software Orchestra it can be. Who wants to jam? ;)

Thanks for a wonderful review.

Just hope you are running a 64 bit version on the server otherwise
your other 4 GB RAM would go waste. Wondering how many Thin clients
are going to access this server.

I have run a Fedora 3 HA and then Centos 5- 3 node cluster (with
fencing, of course) with LVS front-end for load balancing with DRBD
and NFS with about 150 thin clients (waaaay back in 2007).

Perhaps I can give you some input.

Of course, I'm running a 64-bit PAE.

I have run a Fedora 3 HA and then Centos 5- 3 node cluster (with

Interesting. Would like to hear the end goal / motivation behind a
thin-client setup and what bottle necks / challenges you faced. I only have
15 nodes to begin with. Way less than 150 :)

http://italc.sf.net/ <-- and if this isn't enough info, you can try it
yourself by downloading edubuntu 11.04 ISO. Start the 'server' by booting
off the ISO and for a demo thin client, connect another computer to the
network and make it boot over the network and watch the magic.

PAE is for 32 bit systems. If you are using a PAE kernel then
your kernel is still 32 bit but it can handle more than 4GB RAM.

There is nothing called 'certified hacking' in the F/OSS circles.

People appreciate other hackers for the cleverness and brilliance of
their work, and how they push technology to the forefronts. One's work
should speak for itself, not a certificate.

Please don't send such e-mails to the list.

Dear Sir,

Sorry to hijack this thread.

There is a need for a commercial application - which we may need.

Need : To show a Monitoring & Saving software in Linux - *in GUI format* -
when you connect an UPS.

Already have :

- a software package which comes along with the UPS (called UPSILON)
- it is very good in Windows Platform - shows everything in graphical -
Dashboard sort of
- it also works and does all it needs to : monitor, alerting, shows in
bargraph
- but it does not show in as like Windows, as the Developers did not find
it necessary.

Is it possible to show the signals received by the software (do not have
the codes - since it is a proprietory and already in compiled executable
version), and show them using Python - in wave format, and any other GUI
based format.

(I have seen Jaya Engineering College students - doing something in Python
- way back in 2008 - SFD celebrations at Birla Planetarium.)

I think we can contribute / pay the cost for this. The same package can be
offer to other UPS vendors - for the same application, if need be, by the
developers.

Please do let me know : calmsiva at gmail.com.

with warm regards
s.sivakumar

hi,

a team of 3 people are playing. We need the sum of the best two scores.

>>> scores = [5,2,3]
>>> scores.pop(scores.index(min(scores)))
2
>>> sum(scores)
8

can this be done in one line? (first line which initialises the variable
is not counted).

8

sum(sorted(scores)[-2:])

seems like a more general solution.

Avoid, the 10" screen.  It looks very nice and compact but after a
while the small foot print feels a bit cramped especially the
keyboard.

Having said that there are two HP netbooks in my household, mainly for
"on the road" usage.  About a year back HP was selling it w/o an OS
and I got it got for a shade under 15K.   openSUSE 11.4 detected all
devices and my sister is quite happy with it.

> Will the sony viao 11.6" support linux well?

I believe the SONY VAIO 11.6" comes with the AMD E-350 + Radeon GPU @
Rs. 23K.   The CPU/GPU combo will need the latest version of your
favorite distro (kernel 2.6.30 or above IIRC).  Please search for
compatibility before purchase.

Compaq has a laptop with the same CPU+GPU combo with a 13" screen.  In
Mumbai, it was going for about 21K with Windows7 HB.  It is slightly
bigger than the 10" netbooks, has a DVD writer too.   The keyboard
size is comfortable. This was a high runner on my short list (I was
dumping my Acer 5545) until Toshiba came out with a Diwali special
(i5-2430, 4GB RAM, Atheros WiFi and best of all NO OS).

I think the netbooks should be able to handle this, it depends on the
back end database and how heavily your apps will use it.

Avoid 3GB configuration that is sold along with Windows 7 HB 32 bit
version.  Make sure the 2GB configuration has 1 DIMM slot empty for
you to add additional 2GB if you do need it.

Yes, that is your opinion based upon your experience with the product.
  Vignesh is giving his opinion and he clearly states so.

My opinion is based on my experience.
Re Acer, I found out the hard way.   While under warranty ACER failed
to fix the speaker problem on my laptop.  The trouble tickets were
closed within a few hours after my engineer's visit to their service
center.   When I persisted (after the warranty was just over), I was
told that my unit was out of warranty and had I purchased extended
warranty (while it was still under warranty) they would have fixed it.
 Thanks but no thanks.   I decided to dump it.

Others, within my acquaintance circle have similar experience with Acer.

Last year, I had an offer to conduct hands on workshop on Linux
Administration @ KSA.   It was an almost done deal; then somebody in
the hierarchy insisted that the trainer should have RHCE.   My 25+
years experience in the Unix/Linux field + LPI certification was
totally worthless to them!

To them experience did not matter!

I remember getting egg on my face as all the people I had recommended
for that program were rejected on this ground - and some people who were
totally unfit were accepted on the same ground.

and from their website, it looks like they are totally focused on
windows, so it is totally irrelevant to this list.

as far India is concerned, judging a company by marketing, sales and
service is risky. For example I would judge Redhat as one of the best
companies around - but my experiences with their sales and support staff
have been horrible. The reason for this is that the standard of ethics
of the people who man these departments is abysmal. They are a floating
population - today they are in Microsoft, tomorrow in Novell and the
next day in Acer or Redhat. This is not only in the IT field - it is
everywhere. If one is unlucky enough to get a defective item, life is
hell. I have had problems with various Tata products, Maruti, Compaq/HP,
Axis bank, just to mention a few. One good thing with Tata is that if
one goes high enough, problems get solved - but in all these companies
one is dealing with people far down the food chain. People whose sole
priority is to get rid of the complainant as fast as possible.

+1 I had the Acer Aspire One D150 for 18 months. The screen and
keyboard are not convenient for extended use and I had to connect
external display and keyboard anytime I had to do serious work.

I purchased a Thinkpad X120e on eBay for Rs 30k and got a free
1TB USB HDD using a discount coupon. I no longer use the external
display or keyboard. Only problem with AMD APU notebooks is the
heat, the CPU fan runs constantly. Will be a good idea to test the laptop
for heat and quality issues prior to purchase.

:) I didn't even think about that. Actually, I was trying to figure out the
slice syntax (Python's has never been intuitive) and realised 1:3 is specific to
a 3-element list.
