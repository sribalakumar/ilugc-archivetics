Somehow, usage of the term 'business person' seems to preclude
knowledge of technology. I have been in the chemical processing
industry (as a service engr), in the manufacturing industry (as an
owner) and in the s/w industry (as an employee) for the last 5 yrs. I
have developed applications in C, Java, Perl and PHP. I design arch
for enterprise applications now and even now write code in java
occassionally. I lead a team of 10 hotshot programmers, advice mgmt on
technology issues and take tech related decisions for my employer. So,
I use many angles to look at a problem in contrast to the narrow
programmers perspective that seems to cloud many in this list.

If any of you thought it was a rant by a naive 'business person' pls
revisit the thread. And pls tell me if this background info has helped
you see new meaning in it!!

You got me wrong. We dont say, it is a rant. What we say is., that the
perspective matters depending on the domain of expertise. As., I said. A
person well versed in OS technology would be able to identify the
innovations that have happened in the various Free Software OSes
(gnu/linux, gnu/hurd, freebsd, netbsd, *). But., the same person wont be
able to appreciate the innovations in the Python language or its
interpreter. Computing journals such as IEEE, USENIX, etc.. carry a
number of research conclusions/proposals based on Free Software and open
technologies. Many of them are path breaking innovations, however a
python programmer., or a perl programmer need not necessarily understand
the implication of such innovations. Same goes to a business person.
That is not a degrading comment on the perl/python programmer or the
business person. If you want to read between the lines., I'm sorry.

Nothing personal, Joe :-) There was nothing in your post to irk me.
Forgive my outburst.

But your mail gives me one more chance to clarify what I meant by
'earth shaking' innovation: it is one that cuts accross domains and
makes people go 'wow'.

When a Unix system was installed in our campus in the mid 80s (yes,
late, but it was still the rule of licence raj then) and we were told
by resident eggheads that we dont have to wait for days to get results
for the programs on punched cards we submitted to the CS and that we
can work on the terminals ourselves we did go 'wow'. Then again when I
saw a mac in a printers studio it was 'wow... why didnt the unix or
the dos guys think of it!'. I was not a CS dept guy. But it still
amazed me.

Years later was humbled when I got an internet connection (missed
witnessing the browser revolution though). But soon got disenchanted
by the pathetic search results. Until google happened. Now, these are
the innovations am talking about. Not restricted to geeks but the
whole society.

Loadable modules or virtualization of filesystems in the linux kernel
are great innovations no doubt. But of restricted appeal and only for
people in the kernel field. Locale shaking, yes, but not 'earth
shaking'.

What irks me is the branding of differing points of view as 'against
the faith' and flaming/trolling all such posts to oblivion. A list
member sent me a pvt mail raising some very relevant issues. When I
asked him why he would'nt post this to the list he says he has tried
in the past but got flamed into submission. Now he is clear he wont
post anything in the list! Dont you think this is a sorry state of
affairs for the lugc community? In any organization shutting out
dissent is the first sign that all is not hunky dory as one would like
to beleive.

Again, this is not aimed at you, Joe. It is for the whole lugc
community to think about.

This really is my last post in this thread :-) Will search lugc's soul
more in other threads.

ok...u may not reply to this, but you could think this over...i was
too young to witness the events you are talking about, but i could
guess that for people who were deeply involved in hardware or systems,
the arrival of terminals could have as well been the next logical
step, having followed that area closely and knowing deeply about it.
on the other hand, when I first encountered XMPP(Jabber), a protocol
from the free software community, as a person interested in design in
computer science, my response was the same emphatic 'wow!'...what a
beautiful and elegant application of an extensible data format to a
network protocol....now, it would be foolish of me to expect that
every1, for that matter, every1 in the cs community, would have
perceived the innovation similarly...it is just that breakthroughs can
never be universally appreciated...ok, some are distinctly more
important than others...but imho, universality can never will, and
never should be a goal we should strive at...

it moves on...

  On Friday, the 13th, you said:
  > I am using the function xyz(), giving arguments
arg1 and arg2, 
  > but it does not work. Anyone know why?

Always use bottom-posting.

  On Friday, the 13th, you said:

  > but it does not work. Anyone know why?
  I think you should be swapping the arguments around
in the 
  function, instead of the way you are doing it.

Hi sir,with your guidance i carried out the steps in your above 
mail and report as follows:-
i have successfully managed to connect to the BSNL(Bharat Sanchar 
Nigam Limited, the ISP run by the Indian government) using kppp;i 
have verified the connection by using ifconfig within which i could 
see that pp0 was assigned an IP and kppp also shows successful 
connection ; then, i can see that i am getting a nameserver IP from 
the service provider which i verified by looking into 
/etc/resolv.conf;but i am unable to make any dns lookups; the 
default route has been verified by using route-n command which 
shows that i have a default gateway;
2.i have tried using dig  
dig www. google .com
the output of the dig shows that i could connect to the DNS but i 
am not getting any answer section;
therefore i am unable to proceed further; kindly help
regards ram,chennai,india

Subject: [Ilugc] About the List and the wannabe Rulers
Message-ID: <20051002174808.78608.qmail@web52509.mail.yahoo.com>


Lately, there seems to be several self proclaimed
rulers are dictating their views as the 'acceptable
behaviour' to participate intelligent discussions.

So I ask the 'Authority' to say

Who is the current List Administrator ?

When did the list's 'Guidelines' turn into 'Rules' ?

Way back when there were only guidlelines and
participants used their own sanity except on
occassions tempers flew due to sun-flares,
bad music etc., Eventually, still participants
behaved with tolereance and cool and the list 
moved on.

Who are these present day Rulers? are they attempting
to become one ?  They give me the creeps
with their threats 'the posts will be deleted',
No more 'OT' etc., 

Last, I did enjoy very much the intellectual
discussion went on recently in reponse to
Mr. Mano.  So, I would like to see more of it
with [OT] or whatever tags  smart people 
decide to put in front of it.  Again,
participants can simply ignore it if they
don't like the author or the tags. I request
'facism' be not allowed to creep into this list.

I for one appreciate posts from Biand, SivaSankar,
Chandrasekar and several others.  

If my comments are unacceptable. please let
me know and I will gladly oblige by unsubscribing.

Hmm., I think the STPI is working on something like this. They are
creating some sort of nodes around the country interlinking ISPs
so that for a traffic between two Chennai ISPs need not travel all
across the world.

This depends on where the chennailug.org website is hosted. If it
is on a data-centre in the US., yeah then the traceroute was
right. :)

Ok., I get what you mean. Well., that is quite true. However, that
is not the case only with Free Software., it is as such a case
with the entire Software Industry. After a point in Science and
Technology, the innovations get confined to a very narrow area.,
which surely does not appear path-breaking to common man. 

But., targetting the lack of innovation due to saturation, towards
the Free Software community is something that is not
acceptable. In fact, in today's scenario most of the advanced
research get implemented in Free Software rather than their closed
source counterparts. The only cases when superior technology is
not implemented is when the concerned technology is patented or
has some crap of that sort attached to it. 

The argument that `lack of incentive kills innovation` is not
true. Take UNIX as an example. When its developers started out.,
Bell was not really supporting the project because they had
already blown out a lot of money in the MULTICS project. The
developers still created UNIX in their free time because of their
passion towards programming/developing/*. So., today's lack of
``earth-shaking`` innovations may be due to the saturation in this
field.

Hmm., well. I really cannot comment on this. However, this list
has had experience of mindless flame-baits. Non constructive
arguments going in circles. But many times., a flame-war has
happened because someone just decided to forget/ignore some
facts. ``Flame wars and Arrogance`` is not the picture that the
``Free Software Community`` wants to show to the world.

India does have a backbone. Way back in 1998/1999 (or earlier) I
remember going through an article in Computers Today. It mentioned
something around 400 mbps or 300Mbps (+/- 150Mbps) backbone in our
country and that 50% was not utilized!

And I remember seeing the pipes passing through ernakulam, and madras
when I did traceroutes here and there sometime in/around 2000.

The backbones those days were gateway'd to FLAG (which I think was
purchased by Reliance last year, for millions) for international
connectivity.

And yes, there is a new set of links/hubs around the country. And
there are some plans for IRC servers (are they already on the network?
DALnet?) on some of these Internet Exchanges (IXs) too... this means a
*lot* of bandwidth.

ps: My views could be outdated/incorrect. I am no more into network
stuff and it has been a really long time since I checked on these
things.

There was a talk about a possible chennai.dal.net on
#chennai@DALnet a very long time back. However, nothing
happened. These Internet Exchanges and such are initiatives by the
government. I dont think they'll put up IRC servers and such.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0510030913560.807-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

----- Fwd Message -----
Hi, 

My name is Vikram Vijayaraghavan. The pt of this email is: I am back
in India (from the US) to setup the Indian operations (in Chennai) of
the startup I work for, Efficient Frontier (www.efrontier.com) and
thus looking to hire some smart engineers.

The core of our work is all Python based and the UI framework uses
struts/jsp. Please take a few minutes to read the job posting (sorry
for any crossposting) :

---
First about the startup: The startup is in the search-marketing space
wherein it applies optimization theory to deliver maximum performance
to online advertising campaigns. What this means, in a very naive way,
is the adverts you see in Google/Yahoo etc websites are all
dynamically bid on in a real-time auction to get top positions with
constraints of total budget, seasonality etc . The whole system can
hence be modelled as a very involved optimization/math problem and we
have some of the best minds in that field working on this. The
engineering problem of creating a feedback loop by getting data from
search engines and the customers and collating/processing that data
and using that to execute new bids realtime is enormous and this is
just one dimension of the problem.

To give you an idea of scale, total online ad revenue is around
$11billion a year in the US alone. We were first-movers in this area
and today we are the largest data-gatherers from Google and Yahoo.
Most of the top e-commerce websites are clients and we ourselves
manage more than 150million USD per year revenue. This space is
"redhot" as the marketing folks like to put it.
----

We are looking for three kinds of engineers. Obviously, more
experienced the better, but I am open to hiring people with less
experience if they are really smart. The positions are:

a) Systems Engineers with a good software engineering background,
   Some DB experience a must. Good C/C++ skills, python experience a
   huge plus. Must be a good "systems" person overall

b) QA/Test engineers: People who are familiar with standard testing
   concepts and who can write a whole test framework from scratch.

c) UI engineers: People with experience in the struts/jsp framework.
   People with a decent UI background who are more than anything very
   enthusiastic about UI work.
 
Some of the obvious advantages are : top-notch payscale - get paid in
dollars; will match competitor pay and more, stock options - startup
is 2 years old so you can get a very good payout with your options,
visa/greencard processing while working in Chennai, excellent/very
informal work-culture.

Do take a look to see if you are interested. At the very least, please
forward it to any lists and suggest people who might be interested
(and get referral fees). I would be glad to discuss this in more
detail with anyone. Either email me at vvikram@stanford.edu /
vvikram@gmail.com or call me at 91-44-24996092.

Regards,
Vikram

Thanks Rudy - I'm sure many on this list, like me, appreciate
your postings on varied topics, including HPC, VM, Enterprise Unix,
Opterons, SMP, etc. I hope you decide to stay on.

Your concerns should be taken in positive sense by all. I am sure
there will be never any deletion/removal/unsubscription from this
list. Only case where extreme steps required are in case of illegal
stuff posted. I am sure this group is mature enough to continue the
tradition of free speech and free software.

In our Oct month meeting only, We have to finalize the next person the
List Admin Post.

> When did the list's 'Guidelines' turn into 'Rules' ?

It is only Guideline. I made few changes in monthly mailing list
reminder and send to Shakthi. Here attaching the Guideline with some 
extra additions. I hope, it is in accpectable form ? :)

=====

 A: Top-posting.
 Q: What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?

 Always use bottom-posting.

 Q: What is your name ?
 A: My name is ILUGC.

5. Do not Over-Quote

 Example of an over-quote:

 >>> On Friday you said
 >>>  blah blah blah
 >> On Saturday you said
 >>  foo foo foo
 > On Sunday you said
 >  foobar

6. Do not post HTML messages

7. Do not recycle messages

8. Do not send attachments

9. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical big legal disclaimers. If your
company uses disclaimers, try to avoid using your company ID for the
mailing list.

9. Do not reply to a digest. (If you are in digest mode and want to
reply to a post use ILUGC Gmane blog interface.

Link: http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc

10. Search for answers for your questions/problems in google.com or
any other search engine before posting your query to the mailing list.

If any of the above are not clear to you, Please follow the link:

   Dear Swamy,
   I am glad to inform you that we have successfully implemented the
   installation, training and handholding of 'Min Aluvalagam', paper-less
   office solution in the Head Office of Sports Development Authority of
   Tamil Nadu, India, in a short span of 30 days, using OPEN SOURCE tools
   such as Java, JBoss with PGSQL as backend, all running on Linux.

   The implementation of the tool has transformed the work culture of the
   organization and all employees right from the Tapal Section Assistant who
   is an 8th class pass to the Member Secretary are willingly using the tool.
   All incoming letters are scanned and digitized and from then on moves
   electronically and attached to e-Files which get instant approval and
   outward tapal is sent. This has dramatically improved the service level
   and cut down the average process time by 50%. A copy of the Certificate
   issued by Mr. P.W.C. Davidar, IAS, Member Secretary, Sports Development
   Authority of Tamil Nadu, is attached..

   This is a unique e-Governance initiative. The tool complies fully with the
   Tottenham system of office administration, followed in the Secretariat,
   Governmentt departments and undertakings. We can integrate any language
   and Digital Signature into the tool.

   We have implemented the tool in Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu Ltd.
   (ELCOT), a Govt. of Tamil Nadu Undertaking, for the last almost 2 years,
   based on which, they have entered into a marketing agreement with us.

   We have implemented a customized paper-less communication solution for
   Industrial Guidance Bureau, Govt. of Pondicherry, connecting 19
   departments / municipalities / panchayats on a simple dial-up, for
   granting time bound and transparent clearance.
   We had implemented the solution in the Office of the Spl. Commissioner of
   Treasuries and Accounts, Chennai for five months from Jan to May 2005.

   We look forward to the pleasure of hearing from you and the opportunity of
   servicing any requirement thro' your good offices, as it is the right
   time, considering the Right to Information Act. Our tool can be adopted as
   an e-Governance tool by any Government organiation.

Subject: [Ilugc] CPU affinity in Linux
Message-ID: <4340D279.90305@tandbintl.com>

    "Simply stated, CPU affinity is the tendency for a process to run on 
a given CPU as long as possible without being moved to some other 
processor. The Linux kernel process scheduler inherently enforces what 
is commonly referred to as soft CPU affinity, which means that processes 
generally do not frequently migrate between processors. This state is 
desirable because processes that seldom migrate often incur less overhead.
    "The 2.6 Linux kernel also contains a mechanism that allows 
developers to programmatically enforce hard CPU affinity. This means 
your applications can explicitly specify which processor (or set of 
processors) a given process may run on..."

re:  i am getting a nameserver IP from

This is no longer a driver problem, clearly.
Jacques has greater expertise in this area than me
and recently solved a complex case. Likely
he will likely respond.  But before dialup do:

# ifconfig
there should only two blocks like:
lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host

          RX packets:284 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:284 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
          RX bytes:19009 (18.5 KiB)  TX bytes:19009 (18.5 KiB)

eth0     Link encap:  HWaddr 00:0C:E5:52:6F:B3  
          inet addr:192.168.10.26  Bcast:192.168.10.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::20c:e5ff:fe52:6fb3/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:447 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:262 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
          RX bytes:256942 (250.9 KiB)  TX bytes:39980 (39.0 KiB)
          Interrupt:11 Memory:14400000-14401fff 

lo is a needed loopback 
If there is anything more, perhaps eth0, shut it done with
# ifconfig eth0 down
Check that it is gone with:
# ifconfig
Then start the dialout.

Sir,

As Marv points out, the modem is working fine and has nothing to do with 
your problem.


I fail to understand exactly what happens because in your earlier report 
(visible at the end below and named case #1 in my reply) you write that 
you are connected but cannot get a reply from the DNS which has been 
assigned, while in the second report just below you show that you cannot 
LOGIN.

There are three steps in the procedure before you can make any usage of 
the connection, even pinging an address:

1-you dial and the modem on the other side answers. This is clearly working.

2-the program   pppd   is started on both sides.

3-Either the ISP computer in general (computer, not modem) or your 
computer sometimes, start an authentification procedure,

which in case #2 clearly fails.

If any of the step above fails, it makes no sense to try to use the 
connection, it CANNOT and WILL NOT work.

To understand what went wrong in phase 3 of case #2, it is necessary to:

-edit /etc/ppp/options

-insert in it a line  with the word   debug

-save and exit the editor

-try again to connect

-right after the procedure ends which in your case makes the message 
"The PPP daemon has died. (exit code = 19)",

find close to the end of the file /var/log/messages a line "pppd 
started" or equivalent.

-copy that part of the file (not to send the very large complete file) 
from "ppp started" to "The PPP daemon has died"

for analysis, for which you can choose between:

 -doing it yourself using   
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/471/debug_ppp_negotiation.html .

 -send us that part of the file (again, PLEASE do not send the whole 
file). If this is your choice, please also send your file

/etc/ppp/options .


One only among a large number of possibilities could be that your files 
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets and chap-secrets is not empty

(i.e. nothing in it or no line NOT starting with a # sign): if this is 
your case, add a leading # where there is none and try again.


Jacques



Are these two ways to express the same problem, or did problem #2 occur 
after you connected as in case #1?


Was the failure observed in #2 already there but ignored in case #1?

IIRC, I have seen a script that you ask somewhere in the web. It uses 
'expect' to do the job. I didn't remember were I saw it. I think your 
problem is that you don't want passwd to execute interactively.

Well, it depends on what you want to do.

If you are root, you can write your own wrapper with the passwd
--stdin version of the passwd command.

If you are a normal user, you should look at an expect based script.

If you are a web developer, DO NOT create your website users as Unix users.

If you are a systems administrator, you ought to look at cfengine.

If you are a programmer, it is easy to write code that does whatever
you want - using the functions in pwd.h and shadow.h. Slightly more
difficult is to have hooks to PAM and use all its features.

Try it as a root,

If you wish to change password of other users as root,
you can try the 'chpasswd' command. A simple example
of how you would change the passwd of a user called
tux to w31c0m3 would be as follows:
    echo tux:w31c0m3 | /usr/sbin/chpasswd

Try 'man chpasswd' for a more formal documentation.

Subject: [Ilugc] re: how to install from tar files
Message-ID: <43412113.4010209@gmail.com>

hi,
First of all note that tar balls contain the source of the package, so 
you must compile them first. normally most of the tarballs contain a 
configure script which tries to guess your pcs configuration and then 
creates a file called makefile which in turn contains all the 
instructions for compilation, after compilation u can install the 
packages by issuing 'make install', u may also want to specify certain 
flags say for example where you would like to install the software. lets 
go in detail
open the terminal,
cd to the place where u have downloaded the tarball
issue 'tar -xvzf <name of the package>' this cmmand extracts the files
cd into the root of extracted directory
issue './configure', usually the software installs itself in /usr/local 
, if dont have root access you may also specify custom locations by 
'--prefix=/location/of/ur/choice'
after some messages and if there are no dependency errors or similar, 
issue 'make' command.
the software will compile, after this issue 'make install', if u get 
errors while installing try again as root, otherwise the dir onto which 
u r installing does not have write access,
thats it,
also remember to always read README, INSTALL files present in the 
tarball as they may contain some special info regarding installation and 
usage, if you hav any doubts jus contact me n i'll b glad to help

regards
Sudharshan S

 I want a normal user to change their password using the script. 'chpasswd'
or 'passwd' with --stdin supports only for root. 'expect' is a solution and
need to check with it. Is there any other idea.
Thanks for your comments.

Then the following expect script should suffice (though it doesn't
handle all possible cases of automating passwd command):

-------- cut here ----------
#!/usr/bin/expect -f
spawn passwd
set oldpass [lindex $argv 0]
set newpass [lindex $argv 1]

expect "password:"
send "$oldpass\r"

expect "password:"
send "$newpass\r"

expect "password:"
send "$newpass\r"

expect eof

------- cut till here ------

Assuming that you saved this script into a file named 'chpasswd.expect',
and made this file executable, try running this script the following
way:
   ./chpasswd.expect oldpassword newpassword

If you want to automate interactive commands using perl/python/ruby
or similar languages, there would be better ways to achieve them
without depending on the 'expect' command. You might want to
read up on controlling pseudo-TTYs if that were the case.

Hello,
I'm a new linux user and i seem to have the following problems:
1. I've installed Debian "Sarge" (Testing Version , not the stable one) on
my sys. which is P4 3Ghz Intel915gav Motherboard. I can't get the Sound
Driver to Work. One of my friends told me that i have to recompile the
kernel inorder to install the new ALSA driver

2. I have a Relaiance WLL phone at my hostel room that i use to connect to
the internet.Unfortunately, the phone doesn't come with a linux driver what
do i do?

3. I'm not able to write to mounted(FAT) drives when i'm a normal user. I
tried setting fstab to various options with little success.

I'd be grateful for the help.

You can get the apt repositories for mplayer/xine etc from
http://apt-get.org .
Remember these are not official .deb packages.
btw, in sarge Totem should play almost any a/v format fine.

You can compile mplayer from source code:

1. Download essential-codecs-version package first and
extract it. 

2. Download MPlayer-version package and extract it. 

Both can be obtained from here:

http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/design7/dload.html

3.Enter into MPlayer sources directory and do:

   $  ./configure
--with-codecsdir=/path/to/essential-codecs 
   $  make

As root do:

   #  make install

Yes, as a debianite, even I do it the debian way. But mplayer, like
the kernel, is an exception. For all the optimization it offers for
each processor etc., it's best when compiled. Besides, mplayer is a
beast when it comes to dependencies. Too many of them... either you
will end up pulling 100 of megs of packages along, or you favourite
file format support will be missing. Good old ./configure is still
handy :)

it moves on...

setup imap in linux machine and place your mbox file for a user and download 
the mails to outlook. In this way you can convert either way. Or just 
configuring pop3 and doing the above steps will convert mbox to Outlook 
format.

I am the coordinator for the Codebreaker and Computer Security
Workshop events at Shaastra. The registrations for CSW have ended, but
all college students are invited for Codebreaker, a computer security
based competition. There's a written prelims and a two-phase finals,
with a quiz and a hands-on session on the comp. I am afraid only
college students are allowed to participate, but all are welcome for
watching the quiz part of the finals. I am sure it will be a good
learning experience :)

it moves on...

I was able to xine, after doing an apt-get upgrade, but installed only from the
original dvd, i wonder why it did not install before doing an apt-get upgrade.

I also installed mplayer, after installing mplayer codecs, & kaffeine
in addition to totem
video player. All of them are playing videos, but mplayer crashes frequently.
I found 'apt-get -f install' solves most of the dependency problem in
the installation.

i couldnt make out what that GM means.. so i didnt dare to download ,
Moreover it was uploaded on 5Th oct.. but the scheduled release is on

If you purchased RHEL4, then you also get installation support as the
bare minimum - open a case with Redhat support.

Awesome machines to run GNU/Linux.

Did you boot into windoze?

When the thinkpads arrive from the factory, the hard
disk is formatted with fat32. When you boot it the
first time into windoze, the fat32 is converted to
ntfs. Huh! You will need to partition for GNU/Linux.

> I would like to install

Most recent distros do the dual boot setups for you.
So, it shouldn't be a problem. Just make sure you
install grub/lilo to the MBR of the hard disk.

Have fun,

SK

Purchased for tech support and manuals? or purchased
for any specific libraries?

If you only want to run servers, there are lot of
"free as in freedom" distros that you can use.

I run Debian GNU/Linux servers on HP 5500 at work.

I believe distros have an upgrade option, when you
boot from the installation CDs, that simply update the
libraries.

Its always good to keep /home or any other data on a
separate partition so you don't have to worry about
upgrades affecting your data.

Backup your data, just in case, before proceeding.

Completely unrelated to your query, but this model most probably
has defective Nichicon capacitors and will fail within 6 months, or
even worse, when it's just out of warranty. Dell does not admit to
any manufacturing defect.

Now 15 days back we

There's probably an upgrade option in RHEL 4.

Hi Kamal,

I own a T52. I had formatted my HD and installed Ubuntu on it. The best
thing you can do is better format the whole harddisk and install Windows on
a preformatted patition using the serial key provided at back of your
thinkpad (you can use your friend's windows CD and it is perfectly legal).
Then install Ubuntu over any of the free partition. Please note that you
have to download all drivers/software that came with thinkpad's windows
installtion from the IBM site - http://www.lenovo.com/think/in/en/

The other methods including resizing, recovering to IBM rescue disks didn't
work for me as expected.

if you recently buyed (sic), run my dear boy, return it for another make which will natively support linux; any good make; Acer 4152 NLCi is a piece i am stuck with - does not even respond properly to several distros including RHEL 4 WS ;RH 9 ; FEDORA FC 4 ;
2. if you fail, start a club of Acer notebook suckers, we will be the first 2 members; i offer a 1000 INR  to a guy who will configure all the listed features on to this 4152 NLCiin any suitable distro ; my search for configuring its softmodem(Agere)to connect to the internet is going on for the last 3 months almost.

well...that's different versions of the same distro... did u try
debian? i have a Acer Aspire 3002NLC and works quite well with Debian.
Well, there are a couple of glitches, but my system is surely usable.
Not saying that this should hold for 4152 NLCi, but surely worth a
try...

it moves on...

Check out this link (about the SC400, predecessor to the SC420):

Dell is still using the Nichicons in later systems, but you may have got an
upgraded motherboard. Wait and watch - if you start getting random reboots,
hangs and exceptions, check out the capacitors immediately.

Message-ID: <7bf1bec50510062307w781ca661o6d429ff5047a6f48@mail.gmail.com>

An intriguing post in slashdot about the venerable nessus going closed source:

http://news.com.com/Nessus+security+tool+closes+its+source/2100-7344_3-5890093.html?tag=nefd.hed

The motivation seems to be related to some points I raised in the 'To
provoke thought..' thread: Competitors somehow bypassing the GPL and
still benefitting from the improvements made by the original author.
The original author ends up spawning competition (and also feeding
them) and ends up losing! If Renaud Deraison is to still keep nessus
ver 3 open source, what will be his motivation to improve it and more
importantly, what will be his motivation to invent a new product?

Of course, Fyodor is against it and says he is happy with GPLed Nmap.
But different strokes for diff folks. Maybe Renaud Deraison covets a
Ferrari but Fyodor does not! It doesnt mean Deraison is evil! Or is
he?

None with the level of stability and ISV support to the extend of RHEL
(Suse is probably the closest).

In any case, where exactly does RHEL not belong to the list of "free
as in freedom" distros?

Do you have /tmp on a separate partition? If yes, what
is its size? 

Can you try with mkisofs:

I tried to copy the image with k3b in /mnt/win_g/images/  which is fat32 
with more than 9gb free.
 Linux partition has about 3GB free while the dvd is 4.3 gb.
I tried to create dvd image with command    mkisofs -udf -o 
/mnt/win_f/dvd.iso /dev/hdc
where /dev/hdc is my dvd rom. It is asking to add -input-charset, what 
-input-charset to be
specified. /mnt/win_f is fat32 with about 6gb free.

The maximum file size in a FAT32 partition is 4GB. that's why i guess
k3b crashes at 85% which happens to be near the 4GB border.

NTFS is capable of handling larger files and same is the case with ext2 (IIRC).

Try ripping the DVD to some other partition with a different filesystem.

I think its not that way.
There is some command in dos called "copy con" and hence the dir could
not be created.
Also try creating "prn" directory.

Is Nero storing the image in a single image or in multiple files.Also
chk. whether the image size stored by Nero is more than 4GB. I've seen
apps splitting the images into multiple files when storing them. Guess
Nero also does the same.

The way in which DOS used to handle the console was using the name con
for console. So going by the same architecture Windows also doesn't
allow you to create with names viz.
con - for console, com1 - for serial port 1, lpt1 etc.

To send a file to serial port (COM1) one can issue the copy command
with target as com1.

Yeah you are correct, nero has split the file excess of 4gb into
2files, one 4gb &
one 373.6 mb.

As far as I know there are nothing. The problem with DOS or Windows
for that matter is that, it doesn't deal with devices with Major or
Minor numbers as linux handles.

Probably those designing the architecture should put in more thoughts.
Lets see how the Vista turns out.

The Linux way is based upon "everything is a file" paradigm. For
example, on Linux you can do things like:

mknod /home/binand/mydevices/myserialport c 4 64

and use /home/binand/mydevices/myserialport in any software that uses
a serial port - your dialling software or your remote console
software, for example. There is no loss of functionality, nothing.
There is nothing sacrosanct about /dev/ttyS0. /dev is just a
convenient location for collecting all "special" files which are not
plain files or directories or sockets or pipes.

But it says it is a read only file system. Is ntfs readonly from linux.

To be 100% correct, '/' (ASCII 0x2f) and nul (ASCII 0x0) are excluded
from being part of valid filenames.

One Day One Command 
===================

du -- Print the file's disk space usage.

Summary:

du summarize disk usage of each file/Dir, recursively for directories
and print the info in different format. Normally the size is printed
in units of 1024 bytes.

Examples:

$ du -- Show the disk usage of present and it's all sub Dirs
        (recursively).

$ du -a -- Show the files size also along the Dir.

$ du -h -- Show sizes in the Human readable format (1K, 2M).

$ du -S -- Don't include the Sub Dirs size.

$ du -s -- Show total size of the current Dir. No detailed listing.

$ du -X MyExcPat -- Exclude all files, which is matching with the 
                    patterns(*txt, *awk, *.c) in the 'MyExcPat' file.

$ du --exclude="*.pdf" -- Exclude all PDF files.

$ du --max-depth=2 -- Travel only 2 level depth below the current Dir.

$ du -b MyFile -- Show the 'MyFile' size in Bytes.

$ du -h MyDir -- Show the 'MyDir' size in Human readable form.

I have a doubt in the Linux system dir (like etc, var) naming convention. What does "etc" exactly mean. i have also seen this folder in Windows c:\winnt\system32\etc. And also I have the same doubt on "var". How does this folders got this name. Like for example /sbin means super user bin dir (am I correct).

The Linux kernel does not have any system directories.
The GNU/Linux system as such has it.

etcetra? etc has all system configuration files.

var means "variable", for having varying file sizes.

There is no hard-and-fast rule. Its just a name that
is easier to remember and that is common for all to
use. If you build a distro from scratch (LFS for
example), you can name the directories in whichever
way you want.

opersys guide:
http://www.opersys.com/dox/opersys-quickref-1.0.5.pdf

When creating the directories for your ${PRJROOT}, you

Shouldn't this even depend on the filesystem implementation?

 Let me start with an example. The file names CON, LPT1, PRN, etc., can be
created on a FAT16 file system, by directly manipulating the FAT tables
(write your own program. Ref. Peter Norton's System programming book -
forgot the exact name though). You will have to use an old version of DOS
(DOS 6.22 or earlier) for trying out this.
 But there are certain restrictions as imposed by the operating system. I am
not very sure, if we can create a file called CON from Linux on a fat32 file
system, as I am using a friend's PC. I was able to create files with names
containing #255 in it, under DOS. But I had problems accessing it through
Windows. Thus I would summarize it like, your file system doesn't restrict
you to create certain file names. It is just the program that you use to
make the entry into the tables, makes the restrictions. So if we try to use
another program (or write our own) to make changes to the entries, we can
virtually create any kind of file names.

Rgds,
Natarajan.

if u have mandrake 10.x then u need not install explicitly. use the
mandrake CD to install the locale ta to use with KDE. it works well
for me.

NEWS FROM BANGALORE AND PLANS FOR FOSS.IN: Atul Chitnis
<mail@atulchitnis.net> writes on the
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/foss-in-announce/ list:

          This is it, the last day of speaker and talks
          registration for FOSS.IN/2005.

By midnight tonight (October 8th), we will be closing
registration for talks for the technical and community
sessions of the event. Speakers who have registered but not
submitted any talks will be removed from the speaker database
tonight.

          So if you are planning to submit any talks - you
          have till midnight tonight (GMT+0530!)

FOSS.IN seems to be generating massive amounts of enthusiasm
in the Linux community, and *especially* in the BSD community
(who have proposed several talks and workshops), the Gentoo
community, the Debian community, etc.

The FOSS community rulez!

I will send in another mail giving you some top level stats
about talks and speakers once we close registrations tonight.

          Once registrations close, we will spend a couple of
          days sorting things out, checking which talks need
          work on, and will release the first shortlist
          (minus work-in-progress talks and "star" talks) on
          schedule in the evening of the 12th of October. 
          (See the schedule at http://foss.in/2005/cfp/).

Once clashes and WIP talks are sorted out, we will release a
second list with these added. "Star" speakers will be
announced as soon as the remaining major sponsor
confirmations come in.

Call for participation for business sessions and student
talks will go out early next week. Stay tuned. Atul

WHY GNU/LINUX NEEDS A MENTOR PROGRAM: See this interesting
essay at
http://business.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/09/13/1816200&from=rss

Why Linux needs a mentor program By: Tarun Agnani: Imagine
you're a new Linux user. You ordered an Ubuntu CD weeks ago
and forgot about it. You're surprised it actually comes in
the mail. You slap the shiny disc into your PC and cross your
fingers. The installation is quite slick. You're impressed by
the splash screen and attractive desktop. Wow, you think
you're hot stuff -- a Linux user. But the euphoria fades as
you realize there's a problem with your modem. Now what do
you do? ...

You may kindly inform the Principal and HOD(CSE) about this matter and 
enlist the students for this as per your norms.
Thank you all for your lively interest, enthusiasm and support for this 
major national initiative. We would revert to you soon on the schedule

http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8601

an article on linuxjournal which takes an in depth look at '/etc'.

for the other partitions you can just browse the directories, it's 
fairly simple and you'll be able to figure out the contents yourself.

Also:
DO NOT REPLY TO THE LIST'S DIGEST MAIL
& USE A PROPER SUBJECT LINE.

hope I'm LOUD and clear.

You dont need to do this:

Message-ID: <654433ee0510092306h3c3e8d9due90fed6f6db2a0d5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
     I'm looking for a Bluetooth dongle which I can plug into the USB
port which will work in Linux. I am running both Ubuntu 5.04(on an
Compaq nx5000 laptop) and Slackware 10(on an nforce2 based mobo).

      From what I've heard from some friends, there are some dongles
available for less than Rs.400 from ritchie street (the usual brand x,
made in china, taiwan or something) which work in windows, though I
havent had the opportunity to try them out in linux.

Can anyone suggest a dongle that is know to work?

I have seen the bluez
page(http://www.holtmann.org/linux/bluetooth/features.html), but it
would be good if anyone could suggest a dongle which is available
here.

All of Sandisk's USB flash drives I have seen so far work just fine on
Linux (I didn't test on X/KDE-running boxes, so I had to manually
mount them. YMMV).

Well, actually, I'm rather looking at whether the bluetooth side of
things would work OK. Am sorry if I wasnt clear in my previous mail.
Actually, the reason I'm trying to get bluetooth to work is to
send/recieve files from my nokia 6600 phone(runs the symbian series60
OS). More importantly, I installed python on the phone, and want to
write code on the computer and run it on the phone (there is a
bluetooth console app, which does this), 'cos typing out code using
the phone's keypad is a huge pain in the neck to say the least!!

I havent had any problems with usb flash drives - they usually appear
as /dev/sda1, sda2, etc, and then I just mount them as vfat and use
them...

My mistake. Read it as flash drive, not bluetooth.

Try the following software:
gammu: http://freshmeat.net/projects/gammu/
gnokii: http://freshmeat.net/projects/gnokii/

I'm not sure if the specific requirement which you seek(running python) is
possible through these packages though.

I got a Bluetooth dongle (yellow in color, no brand.. no tech details.. 
let me see and tell you afterwards) from Lotus Computers, Ritchies 
street. It is working fine. I was able to configure this for serial 
device communication and file transfer. It was working well with bluez 
and KDE front end.

Plz ask your sys admin. Bcoz if the outsdie traffic is blocked then 
you can do anything. Anyway you just give try by 

1. Ping some externel server by IP addr
2. Adding your gateway as DNS server in /etc/resolve.conf.

Can you elaborate on your network setup? Which device

Post the output of the following from your system,

/sbin/ifconfig -a

Message-ID: <73c077240510100704t16bd86b5n7af1d64af897fe0d@mail.gmail.com>

Hello friends,
I had RH9 which was working fine in all ways except connection my
broad band connection, that i got FC3 CD from one of our friends,
installed it.... but the friend was so good in maintaining the CDs
that the first CD stopped at half of the installation bcoz of read
error and i had to quit the installation process in the middle.

Then as my RH9 was probably unable to run so i decided ro install my
RH9 back. I successfully installed my rh9 in my seperate 10GB HDD i hv
for linux and at the end of the installation, while rebooting, it
showed " Fatal Error : Run database Recovery" and shutdown. On
rebooting it stops at " Grub loading stage2" and doesnot proceed
with.. only a blinking cursor stays...

I tried again but still the same exists. I thought something got wrong
with my HDD and asked Prashant of our group. He said "stage2" means
some thign is wrong with the boot loader ( GRUB) , anything wrong in
hdd would have made bootloader stop at stage 1.5.
He adviced me to install GRUB again by using a live CD. I used Knoppix
and tried with " grub-install hd1,0 " as my " /boot " is hdb1. But it
says " disks couldnot be found ". I also triend to reinstall GRUB with
RH9 CD thru bootloader updation, but still at the end it shows the "db
fatal error rn recovery".
I couldnot install or even boot my Linux HDD with my other HDD where i
hav Win98 and XP (which is the Py disk drive) disconnected as it said,
hard disk parameter error.

Now, atlast.. i seek the help of the User Group Gurus to help me find
some way out of it and make my linux UP and Running soon! :D ( I would
be getting FC4 tommorrow, i will try with it too)

So, can we assume that grub was not installed onto the
MBR? Did you format the hard disk before proceeding
with the installation?

Yup, First i was using MDK 10, there too even dialup wasnt working,
then i lost that CD, later i got RH9 from my friend, at that time i
tght.. FC was diff from RH ( i now understand how stupid i was) so i
felt quite comfy with RH9 was i had dialup with me that time and it
was working in RH9. :D

Nope... my primary disk is a 40GB HDD having WinXP and i had problem
when i installed MDK that it loaded the boot loader in the Py disk's
MBR crashing XP and even it dint boot up that time.
I dint format.. i installed over it.. as i cldnt complete the FC3 insallation.

Its your choice.

I would format it with a new journalling filesystem
that has better recovery, compared to what you had
with RH9.
 
> And whats the meaning of "Grub loading Stage2" ??

In short, stage1 loads stage2. Stage2 loads the boot
configuration file.

4.2.2.1 <http://4.2.2.1>: RNS at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) - now part of
Verizon.
BBN are the guys who developed the first ARPAnet IMPs
(predecessors to routers) in 1965. This RNS, however,
was commissioned only in the late 80s or 90s.

This may not work unless you've set up routing/NAT/mangling
in such a way that your non-routable packets reach that DNS server,
which IMHO won't happen easily. YMMV.

Greetings,

  We've been working on our GPLed multilingual editor for Indian

" Thanks to the C-DAC at Pune, Emacs Project Team has received the
permission to use C-DAC ISFOC fonts for Emacs-Indian support in 1998."
Does anyone on here know if these fonts are licensed under the GPL(any

  Help!

Any USB Bluetooth Dongle with CSR (Cambridge Silicon Radio) chipset
works fine in Linux. Bluez also supports CSR well.

My USB Bluetooth dongle was also brought from Ritche Street (brand x,
made in china). But, it had the CSR Chipset, so my Dongle works fine
in LINUX. Make sure you bye a CSR Chipset USB Bluetooth Dongle.

 Brand doesn't matter, Chipset matters.

"search" is for the domain name to be searched for.

Check this:
http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl5_resolvc.htm

If you are really interested in it, try setting up a
local DNS in your home LAN:

Hey Friends..
Atlast a good news is here.. Bcoz my friend hasnt finished burning FC4
ISOs, i tried installing Ubuntu. The installation was succesfull. I
installed GRUB @ MBR of my HDD having win98 n XP, actually it was a
risk worth taken. The installation lasted long, sometimes i got afraid
that it has hanged some where... 626 packages under text mode
installtion was indeed tiresome. Atlast installation ended, the system
rebooted and thank god.. GRUB loaded and now i could even boot my XP
from it.

But, AFAIHS there wasnt no "Develpoment tools" in the main menu. I
tried with Add/Remove Packages, it shows Perl Python etc. I added
Emacs to it. Even now theres no such option in the main menu. I am
wondering how to access them, though command mode is always there.

Second, My main need is connecting to my broad band, if i get it done
in Linux i will stop using Windows. Theres no Internet option in the
System Menu. If someone have connected the BB conn then plz help me.

Aneways i will b getting my FC4 tomorrow. I will install it Hopefully :D

Hi,

Recently  I installed Xandros OCE 3.01 (Open Circulation Edition) . I
have been using it
for a week. Everything works out of the box, Audio, Display ,
Broadband, Printer( Epson C45 which I recently bought ). It has a very
sleek look, very good fonts. Windows & other Linux partitions have
been configured automatically with C,D, E Drives. Linux partitions
have been given names like Fedora, Mandrake in the file manger. DVD,
VCD,  are playing without any tweaking.

In one sentence, everyone should try it once.

I believe Ubuntu is debian-based, so you should have
something like "Synaptic Package Manager" as a
front-end for apt-get? You can use it to install
packages.

> Second, My main need is connecting to my broad band,

Need more info. It would be useful if you can post it
as a new topic with a new subject line, because, your
"RedHat9 Installation problem and booting" is solved
now. 

Provide more details:

How are you connecting to the Internet? What is your
network setup? Post the output of:

/sbin/ifconfig -a
/sbin/lsmod
/sbin/route -n

Count me in. 

Any topic is fine with me. Volunteers can pick up the
topics of their interest, and if there are any topics
left, I can handle them. Even otherwise, I'll be
around.

Hello Nava ladi,


1)Check wether the smbd is running if not running you cant recieve message
and start smb

/etc/init.d/smb start

2)Did you configure your smb.conf file.If not try out with this

In the file /etc/init.d/smb.conf

workgroup = workgroupname       
server string = yourcomputername    
 message command = /usr/local/bin/linpopup "%f" "%m" %s; rm %s

and now try sending the message

better try sending the message using computer name instead of ip address

File Formats of almost all files we use day to day is explained here: 
http://www.wotsit.org/default.asp
This will be useful to one who decodes binary format of any file.

In this site, there are formats available for ms-office also. But why 
the people use to say that MS has not opened .doc, .xls,.. file formats? 
Is there anything more than this necessary for other non-MS applications 
to read the ms-office document? Can any one explain me?

Hi,
   I use a compaq v2136 notebook with integrated bluetooth module. i could
connect to the internet using gprs with windows. While using knoppix it is
asking to INIT string for GPRS that your provider recommends. The default
came as AT+CGDCOND=1, "IP", "internet". This is coming in a dialog box with
[ok] and [cancel] options . Rest is ok. my phone is being detected. Can
anyone help me resolve this problem?

I am connecting my Nokia 6610 through Infrared port to my HP Laptop 
nx6120. My Service Provider is Airtel (GPRS), Chennai. I am able to 
connect successfully. I did not need any special configurations. I give 
just ATZ, nothing else as init string. It works fine. I hope these info 
may help you as a hint.

Message-ID: <73c077240510120322n4f611388ke1679b8c4a7dcbfe@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Friends,
I installed ubuntu yesterday to solve my no-linux-on-my-machine problem ( :p ).
As my main need is internet, i asked the mailing list to help me.
Later i found the way to setup broad band connection in Ubuntu from
their Help site. Here is the Procedure so that it will be usefull for
others in future:

Configuring PPPoE for ADSL Connection in Ubuntu :
------------------------------------------------------------------

* ppp0e configuration is installed default during most Ubuntu
installations. To check whether it has been installed, type the
following @ shell/terminal
                         dpkg -l | grep -i ppp0e

* If Ubuntu has installed pppoeconf, the output willl be something like this:
              ii pppoeconf 1.1ubuntu1 configures PPPoE/ADSL connections

* If its not the above output then you have to install pppoeconf, as follows:
                 sudo apt-get install ppp0econf
* After the installation you can configure the pppoeconf. You will
need just ur username and pasword and a bit of common option's
answers. Select always on, as ti is best suggsted by Ubuntu itself.
To configure:         sudo ppp0econf

* extra tips:
# To start the connection: pon dsl-provider
( I have a doubt ?! whether we have to type it as dsl-provider or type
the name of the provider such as 'dataone' or the username
'user@dataone' ?? )
# To end the connection: poff ( I tried to end my connection, it says
cannot kill ppp0 so im not able to manually end it)
# To get the status: plog ( It too doesnt work, do we have to use
'cat' command ?? )  or ' ifconfig ppp0' ( i suggest this, it provides
u with better info)

Thank You,

@ Shakthi : I havent finished with my installation yet, as i havent
yet installed FC4 :D More queries regarding it will continue ;)

Update: I face a specific problem, after getting connected, say some
10 - 15 mins of browsing using the Mozilla-Firefox browser, something
gets wrong that i am not able to open the web pages using the browser.
But, the connection is active and i am able to use GAIM. Ane idea ??

Message-ID: <39899.10.195.246.247.1129116699.squirrel@ismail.iitm.ac.in>

Hi!

   First of all let me know if this is off topic. I will consider posting
this in some other list.

  I want to use Numeric arrays from the SWIG interface, i.e passing and
returning Numeric arrays.

http://www.scripps.edu/mb/olson/people/sanner/html/Python/NumericTypemaps/index.html

I found this link, but couldn't make much sense out of it. For instance, I
didn't know what "%inline%" meant. And is there any full example that I
can see. All the examples in that site are only parts of the code. I have
no idea as to how to use all those data types. Any body with prior
experience in this area could help me.

  I tried Boost Python, but got stuck right at hello world itself. The
python interface to C using Python.h seemed too long for me. Any other
way to achieve this is also OK for me.

  As regards why I want SWIG and Numeric Python, one could read the
following.

  I have some code that involves a lot of "for" loops. I am a big fan of
Python and hence wrote the code in python. But then I realised it was
too slow. I can't use array slicing here as the job done in one
iteration depends on the previous iteration. So I decided to go for
writing the code in C and wrapping it in Python. I found SWIG to be nice
and easy to use, wrote the C code. But I couldn't use Numeric arrays
that are central to my code.

There is no meaning for filename extensions in the
*nix environment. 

You can still have a foobar.tar.bz2 filename for a
.tar.gz file and extract it using:

  tar xzvf foobar.tar.bz2

You might want to look at ext2 undeletion howto. If your filesystem is ext3 
as per this FAQ 
(http://batleth.sapienti-sat.org/projects/FAQs/ext3-faq.html) you cant.

But the actual file contents will most probably exist on the device. So if 
the files are just ascii you might get some part of it by doing something 
like cat /dev/hdx|strings |grep "some unique strings".

It depends :-)
Try viewing the above file using less.
Less will show .gz file if it has got the proper extension.
The same file when renamed to .bz2 will be displayed as a binary file.


Some applications depend on file extensions.

No Chakk, I am not talking about ISP specific issues here. Its the
general procedure for any ADSL connection - Ethernet based. I am not
sure whether the same works with USB-based connection which the Tata
Indicom or Bharthi Telecom offers. I have a BSNL ethernet connection
and i used the said procedure.

While that's true, this will be useful in any case. A PNG file need not be 
named .png, but it will still come under the same file format, so the site

To make it clearer for the uninitiead, if your resolv.conf look it

search xyz.com <http://xyz.com>

If you ping abc it will take below as the FQDN

abc.xyz.com <http://abc.xyz.com>

I just tried and it looks like you can have multiple search lines too. I
didn't read (the manual) though

Hi!
Recently in my friend's system I tried to configure Dataone broadband
connection.
I ran the adsl-setup, adsl-start commands.
I got the msg connected but I could not go to any site.
I checked the /etc/resolv.conf for the name server and it is ok.

This happened in Mandriva.

In Xandros I could connect and surf but it frequently gets disconnected ( 3
to 4 times within 10 minutes).

Any help?

If you are on Redhat/derivatives, you wouldn't have found the man page either.

Pick up the man page from
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=115041 and save
it as /usr/share/man/man5/resolver.5 (optionally gzip it) and then do
man resolver for the documentation.

Security problem: versions 0.9.1 - 0.9.5pre2 have a securityproblem with 
the suid-bit
On a multiuser-system it is possible that KPopup create a root shell. If 
you delete the suid-bit of KPopup, it is not possible to recieve messages.
(chmod -s /opt/kde/bin/kpopup adapt path!)

When  i use firestarter i find there are several hits from different

If you look closely, you will find that the site has documentation
only for really old versions of Office. You won't find Office
2000/XP/2003 formats documented there.

The ones they have are I think the results of patient reverse
engineering by several OSS teams.

Declaring yourself a layman/newbie is  no excuse to not knowing how to
install. But before that:

1. Don't Top Post.
2. Change the Subject appropriately (or better, create a new thread).

To install xine, you would first want to find out which distro you are
running. You  can then  download (or search  in your distro's  CD) the
appropriate  binary package  of xine  for your  distro and  install it
using your distro's installation utilities (ex: rpm -> redhat, apt-get
-> debian, etc.,.).

Subject: [Ilugc] Linux Distribution building
Message-ID: <434E0AE0.9000907@tandbintl.com>

Dear all,

I have planned to be a unofficial project guide for a Computer Science 
and Engg. students. I am thinking of going for a "Linux Distribution 
Building". I have a few queries on this:

1. Is this project having enough stuff to be a final year project for a 
B.E students? or it is a overhead for them? (The students are very much 
interested and have worked in linux as beginner, knowing vi.. and myself 
a mid level linux admin and GNU-C/C++ programmer).

2. I checked with linuxfromscratch (LFS) and downloaded a LiveCD to 
build a own distribution. It builds and installs in a harddisk 
partition. But I visualize this project to be a "Building Linux 
distribution" with actual output as a "Install CD" for x86 systems (like 
other major distributions). Is it possible with LFS? I read the LFS 
documentation, not able to conclude anything about "Install CD". Please 
guide me on this.

3. Is there any other alternative way apart from LFS, for this project?

Regards
T.KaruppuSwamy

Most probably your "message command" in samba configuration is incorrect. 
The samba server receives the message, but it did not know how to display 
it.

Building a linux distro is something that a engg student does as an
hobby.There's nothing innovative in building a LFS.A case of "been there
done that".

Final year Engg students should think of new innovative/creative projects on
the Linux platform rather than re-inventing the wheel.

How about one of the projects on sourceforge.net <http://sourceforge.net> ?
Try to find a orphaned project which interests the student and implement
missing functionality to it.SF.net <http://it.SF.net> has many projects
which are either half-completed or are orphaned by their original
authors,that should provide an excellent base for a BE project.Ofcourse,it
would be better if one can respect the original licensing of the project and
make sure the modifications done to it are released back under a FOSS
license.

Hi all,

>>Building a linux distro is something that a engg student does as an
>>hobby.There's nothing innovative in building a LFS.A case of "been there
>>done that".
 Hello there, if you can build a linux distribution with all the necessary
things, then i would appreciate what you have told above.Do you think that
building a distribution is so easy!...have you tried building a
distribution? or atleast gathered information on what all constitutes a base
system, so you mean to say that LFS people are not innovative and we are
also since we are building the same?...I dont think you have knowledge in
LFS.Just doing things would count to the statement above.LFS is an area
where you have to concentrate while building your own
distribution.Learningwhat LFS is a BIG
JOB.Your statement also makes clear that u r not good in LFS becoz using LFS
you cant make a distribution, you can only form the base-core for your
system.
 >>Final year Engg students should think of new innovative/creative projects
on
>>the Linux platform rather than re-inventing the wheel.
 is building a distribution not an innovative/creative one???....i think u
dont have much experience in knowing the core things of building a
distribution.It is even harder than application projects.
 sorry to be rude, but you cannot just like that tell that building a
distribution is what an engg student does as an hobby!..if thats the case,
today india would have it's own wonderful,powerful and reliable linux
distribution.
 just think, is there any Indian Linux Distribution as
Novell/RedHat/SuSE...how many people are ready to build a Indian
Distribution par with them rather than telling "why to re-invent the
wheel"!!!
 sorry for being rude...but i had to...

Message-ID: <73a10bbf0510130348l37138c4ci8029bc2fc434a2cc@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,
  I wish to allow only members of a group to be allowed to mount &
umount a partition.
  If I use the 'group' option for mount, any member of the group is
able to mount. But with regards to umount only root or the user of who
performed the mount can umount it, not other members of the group.
  Is there any way, by which all members of a group will have mount
as well as umount permisssions for a partition?

Actually, if you look at it, Office 97 to XP uses the same format. Not sure 
about 2003, but I can save a file in an XP and transfer it to a 97 and still 
have it run.

Openoffice.org can save in those formats, so reverse engineering worked, in 
this case... :)

***** thanks a log my dear friend, for your overwhelming support, boost

I love to do a linux distribution. You mail has motivated me more and 
more to go for such a passion of build your own stuff.
Let me go through the lfs site once again with your input, so that i 
will get more idea. I have taken print out of your steps which will help 
me to steer the project.

I have one more doubt.. Can we build a Base system (I mean command line 
only linux - with basic command line based software such as networking, 
file manager, lynx (or elinks), mail client) in the period of 4 months? 
Why I am asking this I should not put students in trouble, they should 
not become scapegoat for my interest in this project.

No, you need to put in two lines:

nameserver 61.1.96.69 <http://61.1.96.69>
nameserver 61.1.96.71 <http://61.1.96.71>

These are(were?) the BSNL primary and secondary nameservers
respectively. I don't know what they're running now, but in the past
these used to get cracked and/or crash frequently. So I added the
BBN nameserver 4.2.2.1 <http://4.2.2.1> above these two, and used dnsmasq
(a lightweight replacement for bind) to perform dns caching locally.

I am probably being a real pain by now ;-) but u now use "nameserver
127.0.0.1" as the first line of your resolv.conf to use the local dns cache?

Yuppie! I joined the Ubuntu user list bcoz i finally isntalled Hoary
ie Ubuntu 5.04. But from he list came to know that there is a massive

wasnt there previously! The install CD is 648 MB and the installation
ISO is 655 MB. Yet to check them !

For friends using Ubunty 5.04 Hoary and wish to upgrade to Breezy

Sir,
i had an occasion to transmit a sensitive State Government document password protected in word 2000 format and the same could not be opened at the other end by the receiver in his office 97 ; even though the password was known to both of us;this caused extreme excitement in both camps , ultimately.
somehow, this incident gives an opinion that there exists some encryption meth changes in these builds viz., office 97 to office 2000; any comments on their behaviour , please
g.ramanathan

Please don't top post. Qoute only relevant text, not the entire mail.
If you want to start a new thread don't use reply.
As for your question, fedora comes with yum. Either sudo or su - or
log into root and then do yum install
the sequence of cmd could be
$sudo yum install xine
{enter user acc. passwaord here}

--or --
If you have not configured your user account to sudoer's list then use:
$su - root
{enter root password}
#yum install xine

if either of them reutrns package not found or something similar try
adding more respositories to /etc/yum/repo.d/<repo-name.d>. Some
repositories could be fedora-extras(if u r using FC4 then its already
configured to use fedora-extra), livna, freshrpm, dags, etc.
There are lots of article on how to configure yum on fedora over the
net. try seraching the seth vidhal's pages or fedorafaq.org or

I'm not too sure in that context - I've never tried to encrypt a Word doc, let 
alone try that on different versions. But from what I've seen, the base 
format has not changed. That is, an unencrypted word doc is still a word doc. 
It's quite possible that Microsoft changed the encryption method in between.

I seriously doubt if you can. You are probably storing your document
in Word XP's 97-compatibility format (look inside Save As).

I personally have had a lot of trouble when colleagues who had Office
XP sent me their documents when I was still on Office 2000.

You have to show as to how different it is from the

1. It could be built with a new package management
system.

2. It can be a minimal distro with packages that suits
a particular group of professionals. For example,
dentists or firemen?

3. It could be useful to people at a particular
instant: for example: a distro that can help people
during disasters. There were some discussions on this
in slashdot. 

4. You have to define the following:
platform/hardware, distro size, intended audience etc.

You will definitely learn a lot, but, you have to be
clear with your objectives and intended purpose of the
project.

Have fun,

Hi!

Here's what I propose to cover in the talk:

Need for RSS and related technologies - Notification mechanisms.
Various web data formats based on XML - A quick overview, and general
characteristics. The RSS vs. ATOM debate. Who uses RSS, for what, and
how? How does one access RSS feeds on Linux. Software which use RSS as
input or output. Developer resources for RSS. Future of such
technologies, some reflections and discussion on accessibility of data
on web, which concerns RSS etc.

If you think I'm missing any important topic, please indicate by
tomorrow, so that I can cover it if I have enough fundaes :)

it moves on...

You can add OPML, www.opml.org. OPML, Outline Processor Markup
Language allows the user to have all RSS feeds in one file and view
them from opml compatible reader, like habari xenu,
http://habarixenu.mozdev.org/.

I would think this message is from "Krishna" rather than "peevee" .. why
does the message header say that the sender is peevee?

Message-ID: <20051013174150.87190.qmail@web50213.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

I would like your thoughts on project workflow
management software available for GNU/Linux.

Google returned this useful link:

http://linas.org/linux/pm.html

There are plenty of them, but, I need suggestions from
people who are already using one.

I would prefer one that is a stand-alone application,
but, it is fine if its web-based that can be used by
all developers in a LAN.

I want a tool  that can be used to prepare a roadmap
for a project, which in turn can be divided into
sub-tasks. Notes should be written for each sub-task,
and at the end of the project it should be possible to
provide a complete documentation/history of the
project with the above notes. 

This is to give an understanding and estimate on the
solution paths taken during project development, paths
where backtracking was done, or simply a quick
reference on the lessons learnt from the project.

MrProject has limited features, but, I would
appreciate any other recommendations.

Thanks,

SK

I was reluctant first to speak out since I don't really participate beside a
little in the list. Anyway, here I go. How about speakers in the meets ,if
they have time to spare make a writeup of their talk, in briefs/details,

No, not needed. The other machines on the LAN, however, have
"nameserver <non-routable-ip-address of the dnsmasq host>"
(say 192.168.0.254 <http://192.168.0.254>) and nothing else, to take
advantage of the DNS
caching for the local network only. In other words, I'm running my
own local DNS server that caches the contents of the 4.2.2.1<http://4.2.2.1>RNS
(and optionally the two BSNL nameservers or any other nameserver
for that matter), for use by all the hosts on the internal LAN.

Hi,
 >>You have to show as to how different it is from the

Yes, that should be the motive in building a customized distribution....
 >>It could be built with a new package management
>>system.
 personally i feel it would be a great job done,but it is also good to have
an existing PM with all the support you can give to an end-user. RPM and
Debain are becoming the industry standards and sooner or later i think these
two will be there by default in all distributions :-)
 >>It could be useful to people at a particular

 Sure, i agree with you..
 >>You will definitely learn a lot, but, you have to be

 yeah, i too did not follow the above mentioned point and was taken to
failure...but later we put all our objectives and purpose and now we are
clear with them...
 with regards,

What you're saying suspiciously looks like an issue tracker to me. I 
would recommend Edgewall Trac, we use it extensively at Ma Foi Systems 
Group for bug & issue tracking. It's a bit tricky to set up (but dead 
easy on Debian), written in python, runs on Apache2 and every decent 
open source project is using it or shifting to it. Here is the link:

http://projects.edgewall.com/trac

It has built-in facility for making milestones and checking your entire 
project roadmap. Added advantage is it's excellent binding with 
subversion - you can browse your checked-in code through trac, and refer 
to files/tickets through numbers very easily. Added to that, it has a 
wiki built-in! If you have any trouble setting it up, I'll be glad to 
help. Or if you want a demo, I'll give it on sunday when you come to Ma Foi.

Vamsee.

1) Ancient advice - Don't reply to digest.
2) Mount windows partition.

Hello Sarav,

you can use mount to see windows file in linux


$ mount  //172.16.1.35/SharedDocs /mnt
$ cd /mnt


SharedDocs is the Shared folder in windows partition
Now mnt will contains the windows file

Thnx,

Hi,
 If it is windows, first check what filesystem is your partition. If it is
FAT32, then it would mount automatically. If it is NTFS and ntfs not
supported, it would throw error while mounting. You have to download the
ntfs rpms for your kernel. You would have to do this if you are using Fedora
Core or RedHat distributions.
 the link where u can get ntfs rpms for fedora core and redhat is ,
http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net/rpm/index.html
 regards,
C.C.Chakkaradeep

I guess that you want a FQDN (like
<something.dyndns.org<http://something.dyndns.org>>
or similar)
to resolve to your ISP-supplied dynamic IP address, even if that
changes from time to time.

I use dyndns.org <http://dyndns.org>, and the ddclient daemon works fine for
this purpose.
YMMV - you may have to tinker with its configuration to get it working.

Hi,
after installing suse 10, i want to put my comments....
The installation seems to be too good,
well tailored in such a way that you need to answer very few questions, 
and at the same time , you are kept informed of what all happening.. 
what packeges are installed etc... but i didnt find any custom package 
installation options as in redhat....
It didnt recognize my touchpad at installation time. .. so the 
installation took  in a semi graphic environment , not much impressive 
to see... as everything appeared in blue and red....
but once the system booted, its really wonderful...
i really wondered, is this my PC giving such cool renderings....
the rendering engine is very very impressive..
But its really RAM hungry.... even with 256, we may feel the delay...
It detected the power management, which many distributions failed to do 
till now... (for my laptop)...
it also detected each and every hardware exactly...
By saying exactly , I mean to say,
for example, I have a ALi 5451 Sound card..
but it showed it as HP's 5451 ALi sond card.. and like wise...
i wondered how it could detect that it was HP's...
and similarly for other hardware...
but it didnt install 3D Accleration support for my ATI RADEON 340M 
graphic card... in fact, till now, non of the distri did that... but i 
heard that suse is doing that..
ok thats it for now...
May be it will work more better on desktops...
bye

Dear Irfan / Tariq bhai,

Our heart goes out to those who are suffering the loss and damage. May God
be with them all.

I am not sure if our browser based paper-less communication tool developed
using open source tools (Java, JBoss, PGSQL back-end, all running on
GNU/Linux) can help in any way to establish the desired communication
between users thro' a central server.

If you think it could, we are ready to support with a fully functional free
version, pre-loaded on to a hard disk and airfreight it for use by Linux
Pakistan.

Please feel free to let us know and the full address.

Regards,

Kris Dev, Tr-Ac Net, Chennai, India with

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0510142129430.9532-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

LinuxLinks.com is a big collection of Linux related site Links.
URL: http://www.linuxlinks.com/

One Day One Command 
===================

<, >, >>, | --  Redirection Operators.

Summary:

By using some special notation, we can redirect the output of many
commands to files, devices, even to the input of other commands and
pass the output of one command as input to another command. There are
3 Type redirections are available in shell:
 
1) Standard Output, 2) Standard Input and 3) Pipe

Examples:

$ ls > MyFile -- Redirecting the std output of 'ls' to a file.

$ ls >> MyFile -- Append the redirected 'ls' output to a file.

$ ls NoDir 2> MyFile -- Redirect the std errors to a file. (TRY: Just
                        remove the 2 and check the output).

$ touch a b -- Create 2 dummy file for testing.

$ ls a b c d > MyFile 2>&1 -- Redirect both std output and std error 
                              to a file.

$ sort < NameList -- Redirect the file 'NameList' as the input to the 
                     sort command.

$ sort < NameList > file -- Same as above. But here output is also
                            redirected to file.

$ ls -1 | sort | less -- Output of 'ls' is piped to 'sort' as an input
                    & output of 'sort' is piped to 'less' as an input.

Filter Programs performs operations on input and writes the result to
the standard output. Filters are very useful in redirection. Examples:
sort, tee, grep, less, head.

Read: info bash

ITU - International Telecommunications Union, that functions under the 
aegis of the UN, has offered to "take control" of the internet. More

Unites States of America practically controls the whole world in almost
every sphere of human activity!! No wonder they conrol the internet too and
want to control it in future too!! Probably an American of Indian origin or
any other origin could have created the internet for the world. But just by
being an American, they want to take control!!

You need to install w32codec package which has all windows media format 
decoders. In spite of installing this, it may not work. In that case go 
for VLC, which is a good player, which will do.

Let's have a look at some of the countries who want to wrest away 
control from the US.

* Iran
* Brazil
* China
* Russia
* EU

Believe me US controlling the internet is much better than any of the 
above countries controlling it.Btw, transferring control to the UN is no 
different than US control.

And,
FYI,No "American-Indian" controlled the Internet.It was created by an 
American research body called DARPA.

They control it because they funded all the research as well as the
actual implementation, as a DARPA project under the Pentagon. They
were under no obligation to turn it to civilian control under the ICANN
(overseen by the Dept. of Commerce), but they did so anyway because
the public benefit was much higher than the risk to U.S. national security.

Probably an American of Indian origin or

Yeah, and Ramar Pillai could have discovered the Theory of
Relativity - but he did not.

But just by
> being an American, they want to take control!!


No, they are in control because they paid for the research that
led to its development, almost of which was done by developers
and researchers in the U.S. Almost all of the content on the net
is also of U.S. origin.

Nobody is under any obligation to use the Internet - you can always
de-peer from the rest of the Internet today and build your own
local network with your own protocols, technology and domain names.
This is what some of the countries that want to take control of their
own networks want to do, and they are always free to do that.
Remember, nobody is under any obligation to route your packets
or to route packets to your network. The agreements are entirely voluntary.

Moreover, the value of isolated networks would be close to zero, by
Metcalfe's Law (the effectiveness of a network grows quadratically
with the number of vertices).

If I recall correctly, there was a project to port Firefox (or
Mozilla) to KHTML instead of Gecko. Whatever happened to that?

Oh, if you WANT China or Iran controlling the Internet,...

Remember, China is the country that blocks (or at least, used to block) 
Google, because the content that one can access through Google is possibly 
against the glorious ideology of the People's Republic.

Iran would probably want separate Internets for men and women or something...

But I have a fundamental question for everyone: What exactly is "control" of 
the Net? Controlling the assignment of IPs? Controlling the rootservers? 
Control over domain names? With all of these being as distributed as they 
are, it's hard for me to see how they could ever be controlled by any one 
country. So, what do they want to control?

They do what they do, because they cannot live in isolation! They do it for
their benefit. We all only like to follow. No wonder we are where we are and
never will be where they are.

We are only Ramar Pillais!! I agree.

In this context, check out this news item:

http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=82346

A dispute between backbone providers Cogent and Level 3 resulted in
Level 3 de-peering Cogent, leaving most of the Cogent network inaccessible
to the rest of the net.

Something similar to this can easily happen to all Internet access in India
-
if FLAG and a few of the companies that own the undersea fibre capacity
decide
to de-peer BSNL, Reliance, Bharti and a few other Indian ISPs, the Internet
in India will effectively become a large LAN and nothing else.

The reason that peering works is that it (normally) benefits both parties
to honour the peering agreement. If either party wants out, the agreement
breaks. It only works in your favour if you're willing to cooperate -
a lot like the GPL in SW development.

If you want to have your own net under your own control, you are always
welcome to do so, but you'll derive little or no benefit from it if nobody
accepts your packets or delivers packets to you.

Message-ID: <20051015142840.79826.qmail@web54113.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

Has anybody had a problem with accessing list mails
through gmane's news reader interface using a
newsreader client like thunderbird.

Every thing was fine till 20-07-2005, then suddenly
mails stopped. but I am getting ilugc mails in my
yahoo mail without any problem till date.

 Again I started to get mails in thunderbird  from
29-09-2005. But till date form 29-09-2005 I have only
13 mails. 

 I also checked at
http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc
That also does not have all the mails.

I have gone through the list archives at
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/.
But I did not find any body else having any problem.

Can anybody shed some light on my problem.I have tried
in different clients, diff OS , diff PCs. but same
result....

Yes. I can still read all the mails in my yahoo mail.
but a news reader interface is much more clearer.

If this issue is already been solved, then I have

oh!.. that surprised me!
Are all the agreements publicly known??.. i mean the details. the
article does talk of these being "handshakes"...with very little
paperwork.  Getting the govts  in (thro UN say) might help in this
respect (want paper work??.. get the govts :) ).

One Day One Command 
===================

aspell -- Spell Checker

Summary:

Aspell can either be used as a library or as an independent spell
checker. Its main feature is suggesting possible replacements for a
misspelled word. Aspell can also easily check documents in UTF-8
without having to use a special dictionary.

Examples:

$ aspell -- Show Help/Usage message.

$ aspell conf -- Show ASpell configuration details.

$ aspell -l -- Start typing some words and Press Ctrl+D then aspell 
               list all misspelled words from that text.

$ aspell -c MyFile -- Run Spell checker over MyFile and Give a list of
                      replacement work for the misspelled words.

Read: man aspell or /usr/share/doc/aspell-xyz/
                 or http://aspell.sourceforge.net/

StumbleUpon 
(https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=138&application=firefox)
is a OSS Firefox extension which does the whole collaborative 
browsing/sharing/peer reviewing thing.

Extension Description (from mozilla.org)
StumbleUpon lets you "channelsurf" the best-reviewed sites on the web. 
It is a collaborative surfing tool for browsing, reviewing and sharing 
great sites with like-minded people. This helps you find interesting 
webpages you wouldn't think to search for.

Dear all,

Do we have the inner strength like China to resist anything wrong and
support anything right any where in the world?

Can we take the lead to do something original?

Let us all think and act first for our benefit and then for common benefit,
because that is the way world will progress on open source and internet use.

Aha! I would said "Same Pinch" if u had told me this a week ago :p
Friend.. i have one way out, Just upgrade urself into FC4 :p

Or else change the distro, all Debian based Distros have a
comparitively easy way of connecting to BB. Thats what I experienced
with Ubuntu :)

I too had the same problem modprobe was able to detect rtk8139too but
dint know what was wrong preventing the BB from getting connected, now
i am using FC4 and connected my BB yesterday ( mine too is BSNL
ethernet connection) it worked fine.You need nothing to do jus
configure the adsl connection with adsl-setup as pppoe3.5-27 is there
with FC4 :D

What wrong is China resisting? Remember images of a man, a tank and Tiananmen 
square? That's NOT the country I want "resisting wrongs" around the world - 
they have more wrongs to their name than they could ever possibly resist...

And in your rush to do something original, is it worth reinventing a (square) 
wheel?

Sorry! I replied in a hurry. You are in the same subnet with a netmask of
255.0.0.0 <http://255.0.0.0> . With an IP of
10.255.211.102<http://10.255.211.102/>, can you ping other machines in
the LAN?

Simility is different from StumbleUpon

Simility uses "implicity" user rating. The user need not click on "I like
it" or any button for each of his favourite websites. We find his interests
based on his browsing patterns. Also the webpages are *automatically*
categorized, but in stumbleupon the users/reviewers has to do it manually.

As simility gains more users, the recommendations will be better than
before.

Message-ID: <43525BE3.5080007@gmail.com>

Hi all,
After installing SUSE 10 on my compaq laptop.,
these are the following problems i couldnt find  a solution to....

1. My GNOME Startmenu is disappearing sometimes... i need to move my 
mouse to other menu and back to startmenu again to get it back.. can 
anyone tell me whats the reason for this??
and solution??

2. My xserver is crashing if i am plugging my PS2 mouse in place of my 
Synaptic touchpad.
Its working fine for only one of the them, is there anyway to config 
xserver so that  I can use both mouses and have no problem with it??

in my xorg.conf ,
I have 2 inputdevices for mouse,
one is for synaptic touch pad
and the other is for PS2 mouse,
everything is fine,
except that ...
if i set synaptic touchpad as "CorePointer"
and PS2 mouse as "SendCoreEvents"

xserver starts only if its running with Touchpad, if i connect ps2 
mouse, it crashes..... but if i connect ps2 mouse after Xserver loads, 
it will work fine,
similarly... if i make PS2 as CorePointer and start Xserver, it crashes 
if touchpad is active...
is there any way, by which I can start my Xserver in both the cases and 
use my mouses seamlessly..? without any crash??

Hi,
     Well, first of all, thanks to everyone for their help/suggestions!!

      I finally decided to just take the risk and buy some random
bluetooth dongle! I went to mercy electronics(being rather lazy to
drive all the way down to ritchie street), I picked up a bluetooth
dongle for Rs.475, with no manufacturer name on the box, which I later
found out to be 'bluesoleil' or something.

     It worked great in linux - absolutely no setup required! Atleast
on ubuntu, I just had to install the bluez and gnome-bluetooth
packages, and I was up and running!! I could quite easily send and
recieve files from/to the phone!! Really cool!! And it required far
lesser setup when compared to windows, where it required quite a bit
of driver and weird package installing to get working. It seems that
atleast as far as bluetooth is concerned, windows has really pathetic
support - very few drivers come bundled by default, I had to use the
cd that came with the device and install some weird program it came
with to get the device working.

    Am very close to getting the python bluetooth console working!! :)
There are quite a few more hacks to explore as well, such as making
the phone use the internet connection available on the computer
instead of gprs and such!! Cool Stuff! Maybe a demo is in order in the
next meet!

congrats!
that was a nice install

2.SuSe 9.1 came with a ltmodem driver for a Lucent internal modem which configures nicely during the install.In SUSE 10 the ltmodem driver is missing (at least in the 5 disk CD 
set) and the old driver will not work.

can you find out if there is a new driver available?

such a demo of using the internet connection instead of the gprs on the mobile, will be of interest.

Yup. The same one.

Oh, and I got the python bluetooth console working too!! Its very cool
- I am able to write code on my computer in a python console and get
it executed on my phone, on the fly! It took quite a bit of
head-banging to get it working. But, at the end it turned out to be
pretty simple, just three short commands! :)

Will try and get the gprs thingy working next.

Already did it, actually it detected all my hardware correctly,
but switching between synaptic touchpad and ps2 mouse is not easy...
moreover... that GNOME Startmenu problem still persists...
I never heard of any problem of such nature before, someone who 
experienced similar prob before??

Hi,
 you could download the NTFS RPMs from this site,
http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net/rpm/
 Regarding Tata Indicomm Broadband Connection, are you using the WLL Phone
Broadband Internet Service or the single leased Broadband Connection?
 If you are using the second one, can you please ask your nearest Tata
Indicomm Center whether they have a separate client for them?...when i had
sify Broadband, i had separate Windows and Linux client to connect.
 with regards,
Chakkaradeep

1. Download the ntfs rpm from 
http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net/rpm/fedora3.html and install. Select 
the right rpm as instructed by this download page.

2. Your BIPAC 7000 ADSL USB Modem has been listed as supported modem in
   the accessrunner site in the given link:
   http://accessrunner.sourceforge.net/modems.shtml
   Try this driver. If the above driver does not work let me know. I 
have ADSL USB Modem
   (same conexant chipset as that of BIPAC 7000 - vendor id: 0x0572 and
   product id: 0xcb06) supplied by Airtel DSL Services working fine with 
some
   other driver I downloaded long back. It is working on both Redhat 8.0
   (kernel 2.4) and FC3 (kernel 2.6) just like that. Almost just install and
   no configuration except your ISP username and password through html
   interface. I think It should work for you also. This driver even works
   with Debian clones also.

Dear All

ON behalf of CIOSA and its members we thank Bharathi, Shakthi kannan,
hari, Raman and other volunteers who helped our members learn about
opensource. And special thanks to Mr Asokan pichai and mafoi academy for
giving us space.

I seriously believe that initiatives will be taken forward and implemented
by our members.

We should, perhaps after getting specific feedbacks, have a followup
sessions.

Looking forward to do another workshop with you guys.

Is this error shown POST checks. If so you may have to
change your BIOS battery. This is not problem with any
OS.

What I use to follow:

1. A big / (root) partition (of 5GB min)  to do my day to day work 
(browsing, development, mailing, photos,...) - here I use to install 
stable feature rich distro. A /home partition to store my downloads and 
personal files irrespective of distros. (I use to preserve this /home 
partition at any instant to store downloaded essential rpms/debs like 
USB Modem drivers, kernel sources,...)

2. Another / (root) partition to have a feel of other distro released 
then and there (this size can be small around 2 GB min). This distro 
won't have seperate /home.

3. A common swap partition.

4. Always installing grub on MBR, which will take care of existing other 
OS partition also. Easy to edit grub.conf.

5. In my experience just 10GB is enough to have two distros comfortably. 
Rest can go for other OS.

 ok u can do this by installing normally...
 >>.2. Another / (root) partition to have a feel of other distro released

 again partition and proceeed the installation, but do not install
bootloader here because u already have an bootloader installed by the first
distribution.
 >>4. Always installing grub on MBR, which will take care of existing other

not always..as mentioned above, install the grub/lilo during the first
installation, that is, in the 1st step...now edit the grub.conf or
lilo.confto load the second linux distribution by adding the necessary
root,initrd
and kernel parameters. The root parameter in kernel will change according to
your distribution.
 Hope i made u clear...If at all any other method is available for the
above.i would be very happy to know :-).

Hi raj
I am presently using Reiserfs for all my linux partitions except 
swap..(as you know , swap is different file system).
I am using 2.6.9, check out the net, you will find the kernel history , 
i remember reading it but dont memorize.. but its there since 2.6 at 
least...

First,
No formalities on ILUGC.

Second,
None of the vanilla kernel sources on http://kernel.org have support for
Rieser 4, i.e Rieser 4 is not a part of the mainline kernet(yet).

You will need to get the vanilla source for 2.6.13 and patch it with the
Rieser 4 patch which can be obtained from Namesys(http://namesys.com/)

The other alternative is to hunt for patchsets which can give you Rieser 4 +
other goodies/fixes.The -mm patchset has Rieser 4 support merged in but it's
not suitable for production usage.

For more info on Rieser 4 http://www.namesys.com/v4/v4.html

AFAIK 2.6.x (upto 2.6.13) will support reiser4 with the namesys patch
applied... I suggest u try the archck patchset
(http://iphitus.loudas.com/archck.php) I found this patchset to be
really cool... the ck patch is supposed to be a performance
accelerator :-)

do you specify "/dev/sda1" in ur menu.lst (/boot/grub/menu.lst) file?
IIRC grub uses a different numbering in the format (hdx,y).. where x
denotes the hard disk number and y the partition number both starting
from 0.

It's possible to to censor content by making certain sites inaccessible by
making their IP addresses non-resolvable, or even worse, non-routable.
It's also conceivable that certain groups may be denied domains or
other net privileges based on their beliefs/ethnicity/nationality etc.
(i.e. preferential quotas, etc.). China, for instance, restricts general
access to Google and certain other search engines. There's certainly
scope for considerable degradation in the hands of a repressive
regime.

Exporting veriable is depands on the SHELL. I hope, you use Bash. So 
just try

$ export MYENVVAR=Hello

$ echo $MYENVVAR

In addition, you should put 'deb-src' entry in your
/etc/apt/sources.list file. It could be similar to the following
entry:

deb-src http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/opsys/linux/debian/ sid main

Depending on your current setup, you may modify it.

Greetings!

This is a followup to the NGO workshop held on Sunday,
October 16, 2005. A number of NGOs wanted info on
companies who could help them migrate to GNU/Linux,
and take care of installation, configuration,
maintenance etc.

If your company or the company where you work are into
IT services (migration to GNU/Linux, system
administration, network administration, database
management, etc.) _for_ GNU/Linux, please add the
company details to this page.

http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/GNU_Linux_migration

This will be beneficial for them, and for you.
Interested folks will be able to get in touch with you
for further discussions and services.

Thanks,

SK

 hmmmm, depends on how may packages you plan to throw in for every distro.
SuSE(9.3) minimal system install is pretty stupid that it doesn't include
essential too like wget.
Any tried doing this in a chrooted env?

In /boot/grub/menu.lst the entry for windows xp was

rootnoverify(hd1,0)

and the corresponding entry for FC4 was

root(hd0,1)

I have installed my bootloader in the ATA hard disk.

Subject: [Ilugc] Help needed to devolope a VRRP router
Message-ID: <20051018061549.24084.qmail@webmail49.rediffmail.com>

 ?
Hi

   This is my first mail to this group. I need some help in designing a VRRP router (rfc 2338) using LINUX.

Following is the area where I need the help

When a router becomes master, we need to enable an interface with virtual mac and primary IP of the virtual router. (I am using logical interface, not physical). I am not suppose to overwrite the existing interface because this will prevent from contacting the router itself. Moreover if I want to enable more than 1 instance of VRRP (like the one in rfc 2338 section 4.2) this method will prevent me from doing so. So I need some kind of aliasing of the interface. Is it possible to create an aliased interface with different mac address? Or is there any other method to implement this?

Thanks in advance
Regards
Muneer CH

You've got a seriously mis-configured LAN. The standard configuration
uses non-routable static or dynamically allocated IP addresses (say,
192.168.1.xxx) for all the machines on the LAN. The Gateway machine
has LAN-facing interface with a non-routable static IP address, and a
WAN-facing interface that uses whatever protocol your ISP mandates
(say DHCP/PPPoE). The Gateway machine performs NAT (Network
Address Translation), and sometimes other functions including
packet filtering, port forwarding, dns/http caching.

You do *not* manually edit or alter the configurations of any system
on the LAN each time your ISP-supplied IP address changes. The Gateway
takes care of everything when NAT is properly configured.

so if i have Dynamic DNS server then i may get rid this problem,


Dynamic DNS solves a different problem - how to make a system with
a Dynamic IP visible to the Internet from outside the LAN using only its
Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). Check out:

Well Google has it's own biases.
Example: orkut.com <http://orkut.com>, spelled back is 'tukro'.

On Google enter "tukro" on the search box and hit "I'm feeling lucky".
On the page that loads up search for "tukro", can you find it ? Why did that
page get indexed for the word "tukro" ?

Repeat the same search on Yahoo.

And Google's policy on China is the same followed by MS,Yahoo and
AOL.Basically Google China blocks/provides access to sites on terms dictated
by the Chinese government.

What is your point? I didn't get what you were trying to prove here.

With the alternative being having all of your engineers arrested and
tortured by the Chinese government, and all your hardware and assets
confiscated. You really think Google or the others had a choice?

Simple,
The google engine obviously has some bias or some malfunction.

However, this does not mean it's evil. :-)
It's their engine and they are free to do what they want with it.

If their policy really was "Do no Evil" they should have stayed out of
China.
Remember China blocked access to Google some time back and there was a
public uproar against the government.Eventually China would have had to give
in to public demand.Instead Google buckled and gave in to the governments
demands.They should have just stayed out of China, I can understand why
MS,Yahoo need China but there's less incentive for Google in China apart
from the cheap labour prespective.

Hi,

Since we are on the topic of controlling content on the Internet, I thought
this was worth mentioning.

http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/filtering/

It's a continuing research project which aims to document what is filtered
from the internet by governments,institutions,organizations.

if ur partition is indeed /dev/sda1 then this should be

friends,
I am not able to recover the linux(FC3) partition in my system as i had
recently installed Win Xp, whose bootloader has made the grub
non-functional.I tried linux rescue method and the 'grub-install' command
when executed said 'sbin\grub : not found'.
If anyone has a solution to this problem please send me a reply.It is really
urgent.
Expecting your reply.

Why can't you try map directive, like shown below?

title Windows XP
        map (hd1) (hd0)
        map (hd0) (hd1)
        rootnoverify (hd1,0)
        chainloader +1

Don't panic. Cool. Had you chrooted before running grub-install?

Have you tried "chroot /mnt/sysimage" before issuing grub-install ?

When you use the install CD and boot in the rescue mode the root file
system is searched and is mounted under /mnt/sysimage (IIRC).

Perform a chroot to /mnt/sysimage and then try grub-install.

Are you  trying to run  this command from windows?  sbin\grub wouldn't
exist. If  its on  linux, then it  should be  a 'forward slash'  (/ --
ie.,. /sbin/grub).

Message-ID: <20051018131748.20842.qmail@webmail32.rediffmail.com>

Hi

  First of all, thanks for the Help. But I still have some problem with these implementations.

1> vrrpd implemention:
   This is restricted to 1 VRRP instatnce per interface. This is not acceptible for me. I need more than one VRRP instance per insterface. Refer the section 4.2 in rfc 2338 for the example.

2> Keepalived implementation:

   They are supporting many instances per interfaces. But all instances are having the same MAC address. This is actually a violation from RFC. mac address of vrrp interface should be, 00:00:5e:00:01:{VRID} (refer section 7.3 of rfc 2338). so whenever the vrid changes, corresponding mac should also change

If you are the only person who needs access to this doc, the procedure
is as simple as:

gpg -c personal.txt
(give a decent passphrase)

It will encrypt the file and store it in personal.txt.gpg. You should
delete personal.txt after that (shred -u personal.txt for reasonably
secure deletion).

When you want to read the file again, just:

gpg -d -o personal.txt personal.txt.gpg
(give the same passphrase as above)

That's all to it.

Caveats:

1. DO NOT forget the passphrase. If you follow the steps above and
then forget the passphrase, your personal.txt is as good as lost.

2. The above procedure is only good for personal encryption. If you
need to share encrypted and signed documents, you have to go through
the full GPG setup and documentation.

$ play snd.aiff -- Play the AIFF file.

$ play snd.wav echo .5 .5 100 .5 -- Play with echo effect.

$ play snd.wav reverb 1 1000 333 333 333 333 -- Play with reverb 
                                                effect.

Hello,

i havn't created extended partition.

So, using fdisk, i'm unable to create a new partition in the remaining
10gb because first 4 partitions have been created already. None of
them are extended partitions.   Is there any other work around to
create new partition *without losing data*. Here is the output of
'fdisk -l':

My vote is for opera and not for firefox...
if you are running firefox.. then run top and press 'M'...
You will find fire-fox would probably in the top.... I can be sure that it
would eat more memory than your X..
So for people who bother about system resources... use opera..

NOTE: IE HAS SECURITY PROBLEMS...

Is there any way by which I can use my telnet connection  to connect to a

Some thing like web tunneling or similar methods will help me?.

Do you mean to delete any of the existing partition and create new
extended partition ? Doing so, how can i retain the data in existing
partition ?

1) You should have created an extended partition (say /dev/hda2) and created
all the primary Linux partitions within that.

2) Your swap is too large - 1x the RAM size is sufficient, even if you want
to do suspend-to-disk.

3) One possible way around this to use partition-magic from windows, and
see if you can convert the windows primary partition into an extended
partition. Then move it to the end and merge it with the unused space,
then create additional partitions in the extended partition. There's always
the risk of losing data in the Windows partition.

4) The other way is to use a second hard drive and copy out the entire
Linux trees, and copy it back after re-adjusting the partitions.

Yeah! It was a mistake. Earlier, months back, partitioning was done by
a novice. It should be corrected now!

RAM size is 1GB. Swap size is 2GB. As you said, 1GB swap seems to be
reasonable as well.

Ever, i dont trust windows. So, i afraid, i may not incline to make
this critical attempt. I'm planning to do the following:

* Note down the start/end cylinders
* Delete last two partitions
* Create the extended partition (till end)
* Create two new partitions (retain old geometry)
* Add new partition (this is the requirement)
* Reboot. Re-install boot loader, if its required and use the system!

I guess, deleting the partition alone doesn't delete the data. But
formatting does. Let me know if i'm wrong!

It's a laptop. So, to do this i might require to go through long loop
and wait for couple of days (may be).

For whatever it's worth, Google reversed it's decision to list Taiwan as 
a province of People's Republic of China:

http://english.epochtimes.com/news/5-10-13/33280.html

Come on, let's cut Google some slack. After all said and done, it's a 
business, and it's out there to make some money. And, China is too big 
and important a market to ignore for political reasons.

Vamsee.

Subject: [Ilugc] can't recover grub in a dual boot system 
Message-ID: <BAY110-F7D86F9F1192ED2F330719BF700@phx.gbl>

Hello friends,

I am unable to recover my grub bootloader on my dual boot machine which 
holds Windows XP and Red Hat Linux 9.0. I accidently changed the timeout=0 
and Windows XP as default OS choice in grub.conf file. As a result whenever 
I boot my machine, I get no chance to view the grub screen and the system 
boots to windows xp.
I have not created the boot partion during the Red Hat os installation so 
use of Linux Rescue disk failed to detect the Linux partition in my 
computer.
Any ideas how to mount the linux partition and re-modify the grub.conf file 
to default values?

Expecting your response.
Regards,
Pradeep.

Whatever said and done, China is a strong nation and refused to bow before
the West! Don't get me wrong. I am not a supporter of whatever China does.
But they made USA and Europe bow to them.

The President(s) of China never travelled out for 30 years, when they were
consolidating themselves. Their ministers and bureaucrats never trevelled
unless absolutely essential, unlike most other countries, where people
travel abroad to enjoy hospitality!!

During my almost 6 years stay in North / Central America, i have never seen
Chinese marketing teams going around, marketing their products. They
improved the quality of their products and became numero uno in
international consumer goods inductry, so much so, Pat Buchanan in one of
his Presidential debates said openly, Cna we imagine a USA without China
today!!! Every item of common man's daily use is made in China brand!!!

What we need to learn from them, if not Tianemen square deal, for sure, how
to improve production and productivity to compete in international markets,
and make the whole world come to them, pay them at their door step and
pick-up the goods in bulk (containers) and pack them and sell them.

A barbie doll sold in USA for usd 10 is bought at less than a dollar in
China in million pieces. No wonder, they can didctate terms to anyone!!!

When will we ever learn to become more transparent and accountable to our
billion citizens?

Sorry if I'm taking this more OT, indeed, China is in an admirable 
postion today. With a authoritarian regime, things like discipline are 
easier to enforce. I don't doubt it's manufacturing muscle, I'm sure 
India would find it difficult to match it. But do the ends justify the 
means? Does it really matter that you're one of the most powerful 
countries on earth (economic or otherwise) when your citizens don't have 
most basic individual rights?

Democracy is much more messier, slower than 
dictatorship/authoritarianism. But, I'm much more comfortable living in 
a poor but free country than a rich but non-free country. Wow, I think 
I'm coming pretty near to a circular reference to FOSS ;-)

don't mind if ur partitons are not mounted by default.

if u know the partition names u can just mount them like this,

mkdir /test
mount /dev/hda5 /test
vi /test/boot/grub/grub.conf

incase u don't have the device files create them using mknod as follows,

mknod /dev/hda b 3 0
mknod /dev/hda1 b 3 1
.
.
.
mknod /dev/hdb b 3 64
....
mknod /dev/hdc b 22 0
.....
mknod /dev/hdd b 22 64

remenber u need not create all the above
i just mentoned them for ur refernce.

hope this helped u.

hi,

wht i suggest is delete the swap in fdisk and then create a new
extended partition with starting cylinder  as 4273 and till the end of
the disk.

once u do this u can create a large logical partition and copy the
data from /dev/hda4 ( current part no.) to one of the logical and
delete it too sort of backup. then create a new one with starting
cylinder as 2710 to a size of ur choice and then restore the dump tht
u have taken into the logical partition.

then u can delete the logiccal partition and recreate to restore symetry.


do this at ur own risk.

kiran.

It doesnt matter if u created boot partition or not, it will detect your 
  linux partition for sure, if it exists intact on hdd...

Absence of boot partition is not an issue. I think your Linux is on a 
non-ext3 partition, maybe reiserfs, jfs or xfs. In that case you need to 
pass the appropriate argument along with 'linux rescue' command line of 
your rescue/install disk. Also the rescue/install disc that you are 
using may be of a older version of the distro.

Simple way is to use a live CD (Maybe ubuntu) and modify the GRUB conf.

HTH.

I have a set of Ubuntu CDs (300 Intel, 10 powerpc, 10 AMD64)., and 10
OpenCDs. Leftovers from the SFD festival at Madurai. I'm planning to
bring these CDs to the next ILUGC meeting or GLV., which ever comes
first. If any one wants these CDs (as large quantities) please mail me.

I will be charging Rs.10 per CD. (Er. I paid quite a bit for customs).

Hello All,

Is it possible to get the list of DHCP Servers address on the current

No luck :(

What do mean here, DHCP is for dynamically assigning IP address?

With other IP address set other than 10.255.240.102 <http://10.255.240.102>,
can you ping 10.255.240.102 <http://10.255.240.102> ;-) your neighbor could
be using that.

If you are saying your university uses dhcp for IP assignment, first check
the range. If 10.255.240.102 <http://10.255.240.102> is the range , the dhcp
server could have allocated it to other machine for a given leased time.

If you need a static IP within your network, you got to check with your
admin over there, get details and if you still have problems, let us know.

I don't see much difference between 10.255.240.102 and 10.255.240.104 in 
terms of reaching the proxy. The possible reason would be a clash in the 
IP address for 10.255.240.102. You said that your university uses DHCP. 
Why don't you safely receive the IP information from the DHCP. Why would 
you want to configure it manually? Any special reasons?

Hi

 I have some problem with configuring a proxy arp in my machine (linux kernel 2.4.20). I have the following configurations.

Host1:

 eth0: ip address 30.0.0.1
 eth1: ip address 20.0.0.1

Host 2:
 eth0: ip address 30.0.0.11
 eth1: ip address 40.0.0.11

Then I added a proxy arp in Host 1 by issuing the following command

# arp -i eth0 -s 30.0.0.40 00:11:22:33:44:55 pub

Now I issued a ping request from Host 2 to 30.0.0.40

#ping 30.0.0.40

Expected:
---------
Arp will get resolved as 00:11:22:33:44:55 but ping will fail

But I am not getting the expected result. Arp is still remains unresolved:

#arp -a 

 30.0.0.40  incomplete

If I ping to 30.0.0.1 (to host 1 from host2) is successful

Can Anybody help what is wrong with this configuration? Am I missing something?

Thanks in advance

Hi,

Could you throw some light on hardware detection capabilities. For
example did it detect nVidia GEforce as nvidia or as generic driver.
Internal modem, legacy hardware, NTFS support(Fedora doesn't provide
this in their CD set).

Thank you,

with regards,

Usually there is only one DHCP server in a given subnet. If you
suspect there are more, some of the things you can try are:

1. Scan the subnet on port 67/udp using Nmap: nmap -sU -p 67
192.168.100.0/24 (you will need root privileges to run nmap -sU).

2. Send out test DHCP requests and look at the IPs responding. Perl is
good - look up Net::DHCP or Net::DHCPClient on CPAN.

3. Try something like dhcp_probe -

Which distro? Perhaps try yum. Also try rpmfind.net <http://rpmfind.net> to
find packages that contains the dependencies.

If you have rpm dependencies try searching in
rpmfind.net    or
rpm.pbone.net

Hi,
   Don't try installing through rpm -ivh <package> . It gets you into
dependency problem like the one you are in. If you have all the
dependecies and know the right order then the rpm cmd would be a easy
way. Otherwise yum is a better soloution. You need to have root access
to use yum. For which you can su - or sudo or login as root and issue
the cmd
yum install <package name>
If you don't get the software you need with this cmd the try adding
more repositories to /etc/yum.repo.d/ directory. I assume that you are
using redhat based distro. If not there must be similar software eg.
apt-get.

I would like to rephrase it as follows:

Does it really matter that you're one of the largest democracies on earth
(developing for the last 58 years, when most citizens don't have most basic
essentials for living, except the so called freedom of speech?

Our present form of Democracy is hypocrisy and worse than
dictatorship/authoritarianism. But, I'm much more comfortable living in a
poor but free country than a rich but non-free country, as I have the
minimum comforts in life, which are denied to most of my countrymen as true
merit has very little merit and only connections speak.

I challenge the powers that be - Politicians, bureaucracy, judiciary,
businessmen and rich to give up currency circulation and make all
transactions transparent on the web. You can see a truly developed India,
better than China.

Subject: Ubuntu 5.10 Server
To: ubuntu-announce@lists.ubuntu.com

The Ubuntu team is proud to announce Ubuntu 5.10 Server, the first
release of Ubuntu designed especially for server environments.
Like the standard desktop Ubuntu, it occupies a single CD. However,
it is distinguished by the following features:

* Includes server-oriented kernels with out-of-the-box
automatic support for multiprocessor systems
* Includes a wide variety of popular server applications
such as apache, mysql, postgresql, php, zope, openldap,
bind, samba, all on the single CD, ready for installation
* A slim default installation, occupying just 400 megabytes:
add only the software you need, for a clean, maintainable
configuration.
* Provides no desktop environment (GNOME, KDE, etc.) by default
* Safe and text-oriented boot mode for better clarity and
infinite justice on boot.

The default installation is secure by design, with no network ports active
after installation and access to free security updates activated. Network
services are activated only when explicitly installed.

As always, it's supported with regular releases, a commitment to
security updates for 18 months after each release and professional
technical support from many companies around the world.

For more information about the new features shared with Ubuntu 5.10,
see the Ubuntu 5.10 announcement at

http://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2005-October/000038.html

Cool! I did and it worked! Thankx much.
What i did is slightly different though. I deleted the swap partition
(hda3), created new extended partition starting 4274 to 5168 (hda3)
and created two new logical partitions (hda5 & hda6). I set hda5 as
swap, hda6 as ext3 and sacrificed old swap (2GB)!

mandrake has a utility to size and resize partitions. you need to boot 
the mandrake install cd, go up to the partitioning menu, do your 
partitioning and then exit install - quite safe. better than spending 
$70 for partition magic

Thanks. I was wrongly scanning the following ports :)

$ grep "dhcp" /etc/services
dhcpv6-client   546/tcp
dhcpv6-client   546/udp
dhcpv6-server   547/tcp

Message-ID: <73a10bbf0510200115r798ea18eh679d8d4e64dbcc0b@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

I have the following entry in fstab
/dev/sda1   /mnt/sda1     vfat   rw,group,noauto,sync     0    0

After mounting my usb drive, the
$ umount /dev/sda1
gives "Device or Resource busy"

# fuser /mnt/sda1
gives the pid of "famd"

The man page of "famd" says that the configuration file for famd is
/etc/fam.conf

$ less /etc/fam.conf
less: No such file or directory

The only way for me umount is to shut down.

I also have doubt about the USB devices naming(or numbering) under Linux.
I have four USB ports in my computer. The command "mount /mnt/sda1"
works irrespective of the USB port in which i have plugged the USB
drive. Can someone please explain the USB device naming & numbering
convention under the Linux kernel.
                                                                     - Arpit

Need more info.

Which distro? Which kernel? Which USB device? 

Post the output of the following after you plug in
your USB device:

/sbin/lsmod
dmesg | tail -20
/sbin/lsusb

that should be `umount /mnt/sda1` not '\dev\sda1'.
/dev/sda1 is the device file.
/mnt/sda1 is the mount point.umount will un-mount a mount point.
For more info, read the man pages.

If all else fails try `umount -f /mnt/sda1`.

 ?
Thanks for replying to my mail.
I have already enabled it. but still it is giving problem.
It is giving out the proxy arp for an address in the network for other interface. i.e If I configure a proxy arp for 40.0.0.11 where 40.0.0.1 is the eth2 IP, and if I send an arp request to eth0 with ip address 40.0.0.11, it works. Is there any rule that says the proxying address should not be in the same network as the network of interface where the request received? Also in the above explained case, the proxy reply has the mac of eth0 not the one I configured through -s option.

doesn't matter because umount looks up the values from the /etc/mtab.
so it doesn't matter whether u umount using device named or mount points.

Yes, you're right.
Just one problem,umounting using the device name will fail when the 
device is mounted on multiple mount points.

Hi,

I have installed Mandriva 2006 through ftp install. I have installed
full kde . It took me two nights
with BSNL Broadband connection.  It has some improvements over
previous version like kde 3.4.2, gcc4.0 & so on.

as far as i know u can only mount a device once. but rather u can bind
an already existing directory into another dir.

how do u mount the same device in two places.

Will your search for the perfect Linux distro ever be complete ? :)
I guess you've tried every single Distro that's available in the market.

Sometime back,you were experimenting with SUSE10 IIRC.
Why not create a wiki page for each of the distro's that you try at 
chennailug's wiki and document your experiences.This way it would be 
helpful for the whole ILUGC community.If someone has a distro specific 
question,they can be pointed to the wiki page.

Just a suggestion..

Basically, mutiple mount points can exist which will point to the same 
block device.

However for this to occur I guess there should be no entry in /etc/mtab 
which can be done through the "-n" switch of mount which prevents an 
entry to be written in /etc/mtab.

Provide sufficient info when asking a question.

Which USB device? Post the output of the following
after you plug in the device:

/sbin/lsusb
/sbin/lsmod
dmesg | tail -20

Most disto dosen't support mp3 playback. you need to install
mp3-pluginthat corresponds to the music software to playback mp3. Use
yum to install mp3 plugin. Try yum install xmms-mp3.

i dont suppose so..atleast not in fc4. it doesnt play mp3s out of the 
box due to some patenting issues. debian plays them though (can see

good 2 hear from u after a long long time.
ok now i had found a way to get around this annoyance. i hav tried all 
the softwares provided in the link u had mentioned, but none came close 
2 vnstat
ok now 2 the main part. dont update ur vnstat database often, just do it 
once at the end of your session. that seems to solve the problem

Message-ID: <2a070a20510202110h4a88e465i4af07fc59e96b4ac@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was looking at this article
http://www.rediff.com/money/2005/oct/10phone.htm


It mentions that one can call USA/Europe cheaply by using a modem that
connects a phone and broadband.


 I am wondering if services like this could be used legally in India, from
govt perspective.

If I call USA from India through a computer, it is legal. How
about calling through a phone device attached to the internet port?
Would that still be legal? For ex, if call thru vonage from India to India,
vonage charges 17 cents a minute, so they probably are paying all the
taxes to Indian govt.


In case you did not know how VoIP hard phones work, it is a modem which
connects into an ethenrnet port. A phone can be plugged into the modem.
>From then on, it is a regular phone. I am thinking of bsnl BROADBAND AND
vONAGE at home..

yes. it is a nice program etc. thanks. how do they make money anyway? what
is business model? this program does not seem to have a linux client.

but, do you still know if it legal to use a VoIP phone adapter between phone
and braodband connection. that is the core question i had. my question is
not about technology or rates. but over the legality of it.

sorry for not answering to the point...
recently i have heard that BSNL is after these ppl... who are running on 
these clients and making money, without any registration..

IF they register and pay some tax its legal i guess...
thats how this phonewala etc runs... even SIFY, runs... it also provides 
that Broadband phone, which we can connect it and use it like our normal 
phone..
but dont know about VOIP Buster etc...
using for non commercial purpose is not an offense i guess.

FSFE: Early comment on new Microsoft Shared Source Licenses

"Since we so rarely have opportunity to say something positive about
Microsoft, let me begin by congratulating them", says Georg Greve,
president of Free Software Foundation Europe. "Microsoft finally seems
to have made a step forward on their long march towards giving their
users freedom: of the five licenses published, our cursory first
analysis suggests that two of them indeed fulfill the Free Software
Definition."

According to FSFEs first glance, the "Microsoft Permissive License"
(Ms-PL) and "Microsoft Community License" (Ms-CL) both appear to
satisfy the four freedoms that define Free Software. In particular:
The Ms-CL also appears to implement a variation of the Copyleft idea,
which was first implemented by the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Given previous Microsoft statements about the Copyleft approach and in
particular the GNU GPL as 'viral', 'cancerous' and 'communist', seeing
Microsoft now publish licenses applying the very same principles seems
quite an evolution.

Naturally, it is not the publication of licenses, but the publication
of software under a Free Software license, that gives people freedom:

It is indeed not very useful if every company, administration or
author publishes their own license; so it would have been preferrable
if Microsoft had made the decision to use the GNU General Public
License (GPL) and Lesser General Public License (LGPL) for its Shared
Source program.

Far more than 50% of Free Software worldwide is published under these
licenses, they are very well-known and people trust them for good
reason.

"Microsoft has walked a mile and is now standing mere inches from the
GNU (L)GPL: We fully understand that Microsoft is first trying to get
the nail of its little toe wet in the Free Software community, and we
welcome that," continues Greve. "But in the course of time we would
prefer to see Microsoft join the large global community of commercial
GNU (L)GPL vendors."

"For now it will be good if Microsoft starts relicensing its portfolio
under the Ms-PL or Ms-CL; but we still have to warn people to be
careful about the 'Shared Source' label and look at the specific
licenses: The other three licenses of the Shared Source program are
clearly proprietary and obviously do not qualify as Free Software."
Greve finishes.

The Free Software Foundations will need more time to study all these
licenses and their interactions with other licenses in depth, so this
is not a final evaluation -- and the final evaluation may as well
reveal problems that were not visible at first sight.

Microsoft still has a long way to go, but for now it seems they made a
step in the right direction, and the Free Software Foundation Europe
hopes they will keep it up.

About the Free Software Foundation Europe:

The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), founded 2001, is a
charitable non-governmental organisation dedicated to all aspects of
Free Software in Europe. Access to software determines who may
participate in a digital society. The the Freedoms to use, copy,
modify and redistribute software - as described in the Free Software
definition - allow equal participation in the information age.
Creating awareness for these issues, securing Free Software
politically and legally, and giving people Freedom by supporting
development of Free Software are central issues of the FSFE.

Ya, you are right. The man page says that giving the device name is
obsolete, although it works. But this isn't the solution.

I had already tried this but this didn't work.

Does umount fail in *all* cases ?

What happend when you just plug in the device,perform no operations and 
then un-mount it ?

Write operations to block devices are done asynchronously.When you 
un-mount a device it performs the write operations.So I suggest once you 
copy something on to the device, wait for some time for the write 
operation to complete and then umount it.

I think you meant plug in the device, [mount it], perform no
operations and umount it.
Yes, i have done this. I still get the Device busy error.

In the fstab entry i gave in my first mail, the options were given as
'sync'. So write operations are not async.

>operation to complete and then umount it.
If the mount option is async, i had to wait around a minute while
umounting, so that the data is synced. In order to avoid waiting i
changed the mount option to sync.

It seems the problem is with famd, or perhaps with the programs that
use famd(nautilus, etc?). What version of Gnome are u using?

You got it. If i don't mount it through a GNOME teminal, the problem
doesn't occur.

>What version of Gnome are u using?
The one that came with Sarge 3.1r0a. (i.e GNOME 2.8)

The last post in this thread suggests to remove fam. The system that i
am using is a stand alone one (no nfs, samba, not even internet), so i
think i can safely remove fam.

Thank you all, for helping me out.

It also comes with a 2.6.8 kernel. I will definitely
recommend that you move to 2.6 kernels.

2.6 kernels use sysfs and hence, any device connect
will be auto-mounted, file browser opened, and even
produce an icon on your desktop!

Could BSNL's modem be used for any other broadband provider's connection?
I mean if I purchase it and later decide to change to some other provider,
is there any provider for whose connection i can use it?

generally true - our lists do need more humour, but preferably 
one-liners and as part of a thread. But starting a new thread on a 
forwarded joke would tend to divert the list.

The minimum requirements seem to be a 386 with 16 MB of RAM and
200 MB of hard disk (if installed).

I can run Routerlinux (www.routerlinux.com <http://www.routerlinux.com>)
with just 4 MB of RAM and
as liitle as 4 MB of hard disk, and the maximal configuration only
requires 16 MB of RAM and 16 MB of hard disk.

The various LRP/LEAF/LOAF distros are even smaller. They must be
smoking something potent if they think that Minix 3 is going to work for
resource-limited embedded applications.

sorry but I am quite ignorant abt the topic of kernel :-) but wouldnt it
make sense that a micro kernel need more resources since it needs to
keep passing messages between the mdoules?

 `------------

I believe that's the space required for installation of all the tools
and s/w that
come bundled with the ISO (http://www.minix3.org/software/index.html) + an
assumed user required space. We should  be able to cut short.

Apart from the Linux usage mentioned in the above article, a nice 
picture is used in the article.

A cow is curiously looking at a Linux based computer. Any wild/funny

the unstable version of debian is called "Sid" and testing version is
called "Etch". If you do a complete dist-upgrage to debian sid, then you
will no longer hold relevance to security updates since you will be
working on an "unstable environment" and will have access too bleeding
edge software. However personally, i use Debian Sid and have not found
it to be the least bit "unstable" ;-) unless you mean for your system to
be a server, i would suggest you do an "apt-get update && apt-get
dist-upgrade" and changing all your "stable" to "unstable"
in /etc/apt/sources.list (provided you have a good net connection of
course)

No., actually this depends on the implementation and the features
provided by a Microkernel. A microkernel such as the Mach takes
more memory and resources than a normal UNIX. However, the L4 is
lean and simple and powerful. So., the whole thing is about design
and implementation.

Hi,
     You can delete remaining partitions other than
fedora and windows...(thst is of 30gb)/...using manual
partition option.Then debaian automatically partition
and format the required size and we can install debian
there.

At the input, generally Ctrl+d is EOF, while in C, I *think* it is
(int) -1 on most systems.

Isn't EOF a condition (and not a character by itself)

Freedom !!! Bcoz the VMS allows cows to decide when to be milked, and
gives dairy farmers a more independent lifestyle, free from regular
milkings.

If this[1] became 'free' (free as in freedom) we can really have 'free
beer' (free as in freedom) produced completely using free software.

Free Software  milks a cow --> If  the 'free' milk so  produced can be
used to make beer, we get 'free beer'.


(unfortunately the "formula" for making beer out of milk is not in the
'open' (unlike this[1]) and hence the link).

Message-ID: <20051025175315.84912.qmail@web50207.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

I would like to thank Prof. Raja Prabhu, Prof.
Bhaskar, Krishnaswamy (EEE), Prasanna (EEE) et. al. of
Crescent Engineering College, Chennai for the
opportunity to conduct a GNU/Linux workshop for their
IEEE Chapter on Saturday, October 22, 2005 at their
college premises. 

The workshop had two sessions:

1. Alliance VLSI CAD Tools with GNU/Linux.

You can check out the simple code examples for VHDL
programming from here:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/embedded-howto/

The session was meant to get students started on VHDL
and on introducing them to Alliance VLSI CAD tools.

http://www-asim.lip6.fr/recherche/alliance/

2. Embedded GNU/Linux Labs HOWTO:

This presentation is on how to get started on setting
up GNU/Linux labs for embedded, hardware and VLSI.

The presentation is available from:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/embedded-howto/

I'll send the link for the photos after I upload them.

Regards,

SK

I downloaded it 2 days back, and tried it out - seems to be pretty
cool, though I ran into what I think are bugs perhaps. However, that
could just as well be because I ran it on my laptop, which has one of
those integrated intel graphics chipsets...
Anyway, I could bring it over on the next meet or something...

It's a character - the ASCII EOT character, generally (code 0x04). :)

What chipset does it use? Usually, it's a question of enabling it in the 
kernel configuration. Alsa supports most sound cards, but I've got no 
experience with bluetooth and wi-fi.

Check www.gentoo-wiki.com for some of these things. Most things are already 
there, especially in the HOWTO sections...

B.S. Do you mean if I write char a[] = { 0x03, 0x04, 0x05 } to a file
and read it back, I will write three bytes but will read only one?

>From /usr/include/stdio.h:

/* End of file character.
   Some things throughout the library rely on this being -1.  */
#ifndef EOF
# define EOF (-1)
#endif

Even though theoretically it can be any signed char < 0.

EOF isn't a char/int. It is just a condition (that there is nothing
more to read) that is normally indicated with a return value of -1 by
system calls.

First of all, system calls don't return EOF - stdio library functions
do. Even then, some stdio functions return other error indicators -
NULL, maybe - and the programmer is expected to check with feof() to
see if EOF actually happened.

As you say, EOF is a condition - that there is nothing more to read.
But it is ALSO the #define'd constant in stdio.h (and specified
somewhere in ISO C standard) which can be a char/int/whatever, and
represents the condition to the programmer. My (rather old) draft copy
of ISO C defines EOF as:

(EOF) expands to an integer constant expression,  with  type
          int  and  a  negative  value,  that  is  returned by several
          functions to indicate end-of-file, that is,  no  more  input
          from a stream.

Hi,

I got hold of the lg3d-live-cd 2.3 ISO.

I tried it on the ATI 7500 here on my T41 thinkpad,
and after loading the kernel, it exits with no screens
found.

On the Intel PIII desktop it loads fine and gives a
ncurses interface with options for fluxbox, console,
xfce etc. After choosing any window manager it tries
to start X but exits with no screens found.

Do you have to pass anything specific to the kernel on
bootup?

Thanks,

SK

Ok. I found out the parameters by pressing F1. You can
pass the following to boot,

  slax dbg

I also passed, "nohotplug nopcmcia" to boot faster.
This gives you an ncurses interface where you can
choose the desktop environment/window manager and the
driver.

The ATI driver in the LiveCD doesn't work with the ATI
7500 on T41. Well, its old and I don't think it will
support 3d and graphics acceleration. There is another
option for an nvidia driver. I chose the kernel driver
(last one) and it booted fine. But, the mouse movement
was pathetically slow due to:

(EE) RADEON (0): [agp] AGP failed to initialize.
Disabling DRI.

I think a desktop with a recent 3d, graphics
acceleration card (like nvidia) should suit this
distro.

And yes, you can also install lg3d-core to hard disk:

https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/

https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/lg3d-getting-started.html

I'll get a copy of the Live CD during our next meet.

i think you can create more than one primary partition with

mandrake has a utility to size and resize partitions. you need to boot
the mandrake install cd, go up to the partitioning menu, do your
partitioning and then exit install - quite safe. better than spending
$70 for partition magic

There is no official announcement from Debian yet on K10. K10 is latest. 
But neither K9 nor K10 are stable. Hurd is in active development. 
Whatever you get are development snapshots. You may wanna check if you 
could borrow CDs from anyone of these people.

Hi,

after a few years, i decided to reinstall debain from last year's pc quest
dvd... and i have a small problem that im quite stuck at.

im unable to access the windows partition (both fat32 or ntfs) as non-root
user. my /etc/fstab has the line for the partition as

/dev/hda1      /winc   vfat   rw,user,auto    0     0

the permission on /winc is rwxr--r-- after its mounted, no matter what i
set it before mountig it (while experimenting with manual (u)mounting, of
course). trying to change perms after mounting results in a operation not
permitted error.

any suggestions to access it as non-root user??

regards,
Ananth

Try this

/dev/hda1     /winc   vfat rw,user,noauto    0   0

I think this should solve the problem :)

i dont think that will solve the problem. vfat does not support
setting per file permissions. but u can tell the kernel what common
permissions are needed for files/dirs. check the dmask and fmask
options for fat in man mount. i think appending dmask=022,fmask=133
should do the trick... (dmask sets the same permission on all dirs,
fmask on all files)

it moves on...

I dunno, I hear Microsoft has an app that will make Windows
run pretty damned fast. I believe they called it FDISK.

make it
/dev/hda1      /winc   vfat   rw,user,auto,umask=022    0     0

that should solve the problem :-) .. i think right now u cant see the

IOSN's BOOKLETS AVAILBLE FOR DOWNLOAD

Free/Open Source Software: A General Introduction by Kenneth Wong and
Phet Sayo is a 60-page booklet, part of the Asia-Pacific Development
Information Programme's e-Primers series. What makes it interesting is
not just that it is written in a simple and easily-accessible style,
but also the fact that it is freely downloadable. (From www.iosn.net)

          Its preface calls the Free and Open Source (FOSS) movement
          one of the "new technologies and ... new opportunities...
          that is playing out before us today". It also calls it many
          things at the same time. Including, a "revolutionary
          development process, disruptive technology, ideological
          movement, new knowledge and standards, and more".

This primer launched the series which is focussed on the FOSS movement.
One would prefer the use of the term FLOSS, since the "libre" concept
is obviously a crucial one here. But then, the power of the corporate
world is such that they define concepts and one has little choice on
whether it should be Linux (rather than GNU/Linux), Open Source rather
than Free Software, and FOSS rather than FLOSS.

That apart, this book contains some useful material.

It starts off with definitions: about the Free Software Foundation, the
Open Source Initiative, the FOSS development method (reduced
duplication of effort, building upon the work of others, better quality
control, and reduced maintenance costs), and a brief history of FOSS.

Then we go to the meat of the issue: why FOSS?

Also: Is FOSS free? How large are the savings from FOSS? What are the
benefits of using FOSS (security, reliability and stability, open
standards and vendor independence, reduced reliance on imports,
developing local software capacity, reduced 'piracy', localization
possibilities, etc)?

There's the other side of the balance-sheet presented too: what are the
shortcomings of FOSS? 

This primer admits to the lack of business applications, hassles when
it comes to inter-operability with some proprietary systems, and
limitations on the availability of documentation and the 'polish' with
which products are presented.

          From there, we go to FOSS success stories. These are pointers
          to projects where large governments (or supra-governments
          like the European Union) took strongly pro-FOSS policies.
          There are studies from The German Bundestag servers, the city
          of Munich, the experiences in France, UK's policies on FOSS
          procurement, and the migration to FOSS in the city of Turku
          in Finland.

>From the Americas success storiasia, es come from California, Texas and
Oregon -- even if the pro-FOSS laws were still to be passed at the time
of writing. Then, there's Peru, Brazil, and, in  Asia, China, India,
Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia and Japan.

Wong and Phet, who obviously have a good overview of the subject
they're writing about, shift to some successful FOSS projects. These
include Bind (the DNS server, without which internet addresses such as
yahoo.com or even microsoft.com would not function), the Apache web
server, the Sendmail email server, the secure network administration
tool OpenSSH, and the Open Office productivity suite.

Richard M Stallman, the father of the Free Software Movement and a
guest of the International Open Source Network, would probably be happy
with a section of this book(let) that explains the difference between
the "Linux" buzzword, and the concepts like GNU/Linux. Newbies to this
entire idea are told about where they can download GNU/Linux from --
don't try unless you have a fat pipe to the internet, it's just easier
to very-legally make copies of a distro that someone else has. Issues
like download time, installation and compiling time, quality assurance
and learning time are also very briefly touched on.

With so much packed in a small book, you might just realise that we've
still only reached half-way through the title.

Quite rapidly, the authors shift to more complex issues -- licensing
arrangements, the GNU General Public License, BSD-style licenses, and
issue like whether FOSS can be combined with proprietary software.

We move on to localisation ("the process of creating or adapting a
product to a specific locale, i.e. to the language, cultural context,
conventions and market requirements of a specific target 'market'),
methods for localizing,  and a case-studies of FOSS in government and
education.

Having seen how some of this works on the ground, it might be risky to
rely solely on the printed word to judge how things work in this field.
For instance, a more thorough evaluation of the Goa Schools Computer
Project (or, Goa Computers in Schools Project, as it has also been
called) stills awaits being done. And it would be best done by someone
who has empathy and appreciates the potential, without necessarily
being a close observer-participant as this reviewer has been.

          Finally, we end with a glossary... much-needed for a subject
          as geeky as this. There's also a list of interesting URLs of
          different GPL compatible and incompatible software licenses.

As noted above, what makes this book different is not just that yoiu
are free to "copy, distribute and display" it, but also make derivative
works from it and make commercial use of this work. Further, the
authors are generous in crediting all the persons whose work, comments,
feedback and copyedits went into creating this work. We are reminded at
the end about the agendas of the two UNDP-linked institutions that
brought it out (www.apdip.net and www.iosn.net).

Clearly, there's no reason why this needs to be read by both those
gung-ho and those skeptical about the potential of FOSS. You can't
claim that the costs (there's none) or lack of access (it's just a URL
away) kept you from reading it. -- Frederick Noronha, October 2005.

FIGHTING DISASTER, THE FLOSS STYLE:

Chamindra de Silva <chamindra@opensource.lk> informs that
Sahana phase I is currently being deployed in Pakistan
together with the support of NADRA (National Database and
Registration Authority) of Pakistan, IBM Crisis Response Team
and IBM Pakistan. NADRA has a comprehensive people database
as they build and maintain the central system that maintains
the registration of people (identity card, passport, etc). In
Pakistan, however the system is not web based and under tight
security controls. Thus Sahana fills the gap of making the
data accessible to the other organizations involved in the
relief effort such as the NGOs. Apart from that NADRA does
not have the equivalent of the request management system and
organization registry which is built into phase 1. This is
what the integrated system should look like this:
http://www.reliefsource.org/foss/images/2/2e/NDMS.jpg

The deployment model presented by us can be found at
http://www.linux.lk/~chamindra/docs/Sahana-Pakistan.pdf

Chamindra is keeping notes and lessons learned on this
deployment at the Reliefsource wiki at

HELP FOR A WEBSITE, IN HINDI: Shubhranshu Choudhary
<smitashu@gmail.com> is working on a People's Website of Chattishgarh,
and he got useful for some of his technical problems from Indic
computing guru G Karunakar.

"Shu" has been trying to put in "as much matter in Hindi as
possible". They use the Hindi Mangal Unicode as font for the
www.cgnet.in site, due to go online in early November. Shu
says: " I am having huge difficulty with content in various
different fonts in Hindi. My friend Sudhir Gore of India
Today Delhi had sent me a TBIL converter from Microsoft which
is working for few fonts. I also trying to work with
Parivartan which came with the CD given by Govt of India. But
I have not been able to make it work yet."

Karunakar responds:

          I assume you are trying to convert texts composed
          in different fonts to Unicode, so what would be
          first needed is which fonts are those texts in.
          There exist few convertors
     
          There is one here, which converts to ISCII
          http://ltrc.iiit.net/showfile.php?filename=downloads/FC-1.0/fc.html
          http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/indlinux/
          scripts/iscii2utf8.py?rev=1.2&view=log

ISCII can be converted to utf-8 (the encoding in which you
have to keep webpages) using the attached script. There is
also more convertor scripts at
http://www.indictrans.org/mapping/English/legecy_to_unicode.php
(I am cc'ing to the developer Swapnil Hajare - he could help
with specific issues).

For info on using Hindi on internet read
http://www.devanaagarii.net

Typically if your users are sending content in lots of fonts,
maybe better to identify a small set (5-6) fonts in which you
could accept contributions in. Most of the above scripts are
[GNU]Linux based, I guess we need to do a simple app. which
can do the conversions without users having to fiddle with
scripts (will try to get someone volunteer for that).

BATTLEGROUND OF IDEAS:

Battleground of ideas: FLOSS debate raises tempers at BytesForAll

BytesForAll's mailing list[1] recently played host
to a strong, and at times polemical, debate on
proprietary-versus-FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source
Software). In this debate, there were these couple of great
posts here [2] and here [3], that put things neatly in
perspective -- thanks to David Geilhufe who is co-founder of
the SocialSourceFoundation.org [4] and Sunil Abraham of
Mahiti.org [5].

It all started with a rather critical-of-FLOSS post by
University of Manchester's Dr Richard Heeks [6] offering a
link to an eDevelopment Briefing titled "Free and Open Source
Software: A Blind Alley for Developing Countries?" [7].

It calls the 1980s shareware "FOSS forerunner" to have had
"zero" impact, says data from Africa shows only five percent
of computers "in developing countries" have any Open Source
software running on them, and notes that proprietorial
software dominates "even in Cuba... where the US embargo
should make conditions highly propitious".

Besides, the briefing says that "piracy" and the "limited
size of initial purchase price within total cost of software
ownership" there is actually no "evidence of FOSS delivering
cost savings".

Says the briefing: "In particular, proprietary software may
not be open source but it is certainly free for the great
majority of developing country users, thanks to piracy." It
points to the lack of awareness of FOSS in Africa, and the
lack of international links needed to be part of an "active,
global community of like-minded developers".

One early response to this brief text came from BytesForAll
co-founder Frederick "FN" Noronha and is here for viewing
[8].

It argues, "The "5% of computer systems" overlooks the role
played by FLOSS in servers, in keeping the Internet running,
in giving unprecedented access to developers of the Third
World to take part in a global movement, and more." This
study, argues this post, overlooks the potential of FLOSS in
large 'developing' countries like India, China, Brazil and
South Africa. It points to another study -- from Finland --
which it says is more open to the benefits of FLOSS in the
"developing" world. See
http://www.maailma.kaapeli.fi/FLOSSReport1.0.html

FN also adds, "By saying 'proprietorial software is free' for
the bulk of the 'developing' world, the study is guilty of
both tolerating/encouraging the illegally copying of software
('piracy' is a loaded term, unfortunately accepted by
academia too) and missing the essence of what Free Software
is all about (offering the freedom to be used, copied,
studied, modified and redistributed). We are not fighting
just for the right to remain 'pirates'...."

Richard "RMS" Stallman, founder of the Free Software
Foundation joining in the debate with these comments. [9]

There was a longish debate on benchmarking FLOSS. Javier
Sola, a Spanish-Chilean working on Khmer language
localisation in Cambodia, added some interesting points [10].

Javier, who works with APC member the Open Forum of Cambodia,
argues: "Academics should make sure that they look at all
factors when they write something like this. In this case the
author has not come even close to it. He has, among others,
completelly ignored the power of localisation, diminished as
"techies and amateurs" some of the people that have clearer
ideas of what is needed for real migration and used
anectdotal data for his conclusions."

Sunil Abraham argues how proprietorial software could kill --
no exaggeration, due to its delays and restrictions -- in a
post-Tsunami situation. He also argues that "because Sahana
(a Free/Libre and Open Source Software project to cope with
disasters) is FOSS, the earthquake stricken people from
Pakistan and India don't have to spend money earmarked for
food on software." Then, in an almost tongue-in-cheek Sunish
manner, he argues that FLOSS "increases the responsiveness of
an organisation. This is important whether it is peoples
lives or greater profits." [11]

David Geilhufe has this very interesting response to argue
that FLOSS offers "viral diffusion" (to enable its
uncontrolled spread, of course in a positive way), local
control and lower barriers to entry. Well put, and very well
argued.

Here's [12] what David argues eloquently: "There is no
religious war here, but I think the staunch defenders of
proprietary code get stuck on analyzing the software... this
isn't the important part. One needs to analyze the innovation
and use of software... that, I believe, is where the real ICT
impact lies."

David's Social Source Foundation [13] is here. It is "a
nonproft organization that exists to create open source,
mission-focused technology for the nonprofit and NGO sector."

Another link is the OpenNGO.org [14] network. OpenNGO calls
itself "an open source project to create a set of web-based
tools designed to meet the needs of small U.S. nonprofit
organizations and non-governmental organizations across the
globe."

Meanwhile, another strong debate continued at the Global
Knowledge for Development mailing-list, visible at the
archives here [15]. Some supported Heeks views, while others
said academia was missing the point on FLOSS.

Said Mark Davies (mark@busylab.com): "As an African business,
and as an African software development business, I still
don't get it. There's so much enthusiasm for FOSS, there's so
much conference mind-share spent on this topic, and yet I
don't see an illuminating discussion about the opportunities
for risk/reward for people like us." [16]

After facing a lot of counterpoints, Heeks responded: "You
can read this message in two ways: either that FOSS will
never deliver; or that the FOSS community needs to rethink
its strategies. Or, of course, if you've devoted months or
years to FOSS and don't like the message, you'll try to
denigrate the writer, deny the data, and so forth." [17]

Klaus Stoll the president of Fundacion Chasquinet [18] in
Quito, Ecuador also swam against the tide. He wrote: "...yes,
my organization Chasquinet Foundation works with Microsoft
and yes it is the same organization that produced and
published the Open Source tollbox for Telecenters in Latin
America [19] and yes we have as a policy in our organization
that people should have a right to choose. What counts for us
here at the grassroots are real ICT tools for Development, be
they open source or otherwise, what counts is if they make a
real positive impact in improving peoples lives."

African NGO Kaibassa argued here[20]: "We at Kabissa have a
very practical orientation and don't really push Open Source
in our trainings or through our services and Web site unless
it's just staring in our faces as just plain better. Open
Source Content Management Systems and other server-based
tools and desktop applications like Firefox and Thunderbird
spring straight to mind. In the meantime, I hope you and
other software developers in Africa are aware of and
considering attending Africa Source II."

But one key perspective came from Richard "RMS" Stallman,
founder of the Free Software Foundation [21]. He commented:
"The choice between free (freedom-respecting) and proprietary
(user-subjugating) software is not a technical choice. It is
an ethical and political issue about people's freedom. To be
neutral on issues that merely concern technology is fine. To
be neutral on ethical and political issues about freedom is
nothing to be proud of."

Forgotten Passwords
------------------------------

One particularly vexing problem is a forgotten password. In most cases, 
you can correct this problem by logging in as root and using the passwd 
utility, as in passwd jones to change jones? password.
Unfortunately, this approach won?t work if you?ve forgotten the root 
password itself. To fix this problem, you must boot an emergency system 
with no password or its own password. You can then mount the main 
system?s root filesystem and edit its /etc/shadow file. Be sure to edit 
the file on the main system, not on your emergency system! Look for the 
line that holds the root password:

root:$1$I0eGeG$ksE86Ind4MfKE0:12783:0:::::

The password appears in the second colon-delimited field, and in most 
cases it begins with the string $1$.
You can do one of two things to correct a forgotten root password:
*Copy a password field from an account with a password that you do 
remember. When you reboot, you can then use that password to log into 
the computer. This is the superior option, if you know at least one 
other password on the computer (or on another computer-- you can copy 
the password from another system).
*Delete the password field. This sets a null password, which lets you 
login as root without a password.
In either case, but particularly in the second case, you should use 
passwd to change the root password immediately upon rebooting the 
computer back into its normal software. In fact, you might want to 
disconnect the computer from the network when you reboot, to minimize 
the slim chance that a cracker will be able to break in during the brief 
period of vulnerability when the system has no root password.

Or If you boot using grub, you can replace the init=/sbin/init with
init=/bin/bash
which will drop you to a shell from were one can reset the password.

One Day One Command 
===================

umask -- Default file-creation permission mask.

Summary:

umask is used to set the default permission for files, which is
created by the user. To get the actual default permissions, the 
mask should be XOR-ed with 0666 for files and 0777 for folders.

For example, if umask is 0002, then (0002 ^ 0666) = 0664 is the 
default permission for files.

Examples:

$ umask -- Show the mask value in Number form.

$ umask -S -- Show the mask value in Symbolic form.

$ umask 0022 -- Set the default mask as 0022.

$ umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx -- Same as above, in Symbolic mode.

Another way to fix this problem is by booting in to single user mode. In
single-user mode, you computer boots to runlevel 1. Your local
filesystems will be mounted and You will have a usable system
maintenance shell where you can use the passwd utility to change the
password of any user.

When i boot into single user mode in Ubuntu (i gave the root user a
password), it asks me for the root password.. is this method distro
specific?

Its not distro specific. This is because sulogin is set to run for

http://www.redhat.com/magazine/008jun05/features/fc4/#trim . I request
IITM to include fedora-extras in their mirror for the benefit of the
Indian Linux users. BTW, who is the new list admin.. I saw the
ilugc-list mailman interface page at iitm site list mail admin. as
Sriram. Is this Prof. Dr. Sriram??

Thank you,

with regards,
Ashwin

That's a Source RPM or SRPM. You need to build it first
using rpmbuild (resolving dependencies, if any) before
installing the binary RPM(s) that are built by rpmbuild.

Check out 'man rpm' and 'man rpmbuild'.

'yum isntall xmmms' it installs the latest version solving all 
dependencies.. if still probs try this plugin.. check this out 
http://stentz.freshrpms.net/rpm.html?id=495. this is the mp3 decoder 
library
this is the mp3 plugin for xmms u were lookin for 
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/fedora/linux/3/xmms/xmms-mp3-1.2.10-9.1.1.fc3.fr.i386.rpm 

note that tthis plugin can b used only with xmms.

Subject: [Ilugc] Query Regarding ARPD
Message-ID: <20051031073941.31229.qmail@webmail28.rediffmail.com>

Hi All,
 ?
1) In order to  Enable user space arp daemon (ARPD), we need to enable CONFIG_ARPD=Y and recompile the linux kernel. 
 
As per /usr/src/linux-2.4.X.X/Documentation/Configure.help,  enabling  CONFIG_ARPD expects "Kernel/User network link driver"to 
 
be enabled. How to enable this option in kernel version 2.4.20? 
 
2) Does user space arp deamon (ARPD) works on kernel version 2.4.20 ? 
 
3) Do we need to apply any kernel patch for ARPD to work on kernel version 2.4.20 ?

Thanks in advance for your time and effort.

Regards,
SenthilKG

Subject: [Ilugc] My experience with Cooperative Linux (coLinux)
Message-ID: <4365F551.1020109@tandbintl.com>

   ** What is this? **
   I tried coLinux 0.6.2 on Win-XP-SP2 running on HP nx6120 laptop. :-)
   ******* It works fine. Just amazing ********
   I felt like working on full fledged installed linux.
   http://wiki.colinux.org is very much useful. It **does not** take much
   memory, just 2 MB only :-)

   ** What is coLinux? **
   CoLinux is a linux running on other Operating System, so that switching
   between two operating systems is just finger tip work.

   ** Installation method I followed **
   1. Downloaded coLinux-0.6.2.exe (4.7MB) and
   Debian-3.0r2.ext3-mit-backports.1gb.bz2 (28MB) from
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=98788.
   2. Downloaded Windows Packer Capture Library WinPcap_3_1.exe (457KB) from
   http://winpcap.mirror.ethereal.com/install/default.htm
   3. Installed Windows Packer Capture Library as instructed by above link.
   4. Install the coLinux-0.6.2.exe in C:\coLinux directory.
   5. Copy the Debian-3.0r2.ext3-mit-backports.1gb.bz2 in C:\coLinux and
   rename it as "root_fs"
   6. Run "C:\coLinux\colinux-daemon.exe -c default.colinux.xml"
   7. Now you should see a linux kernel boot message and login prompt in a
   less than 10 secs.
   8. If WinPcap is installed properly, you are connected to your network,
   you can do apt-get also immediately. I installed WindowMaker desktop using
   apt-get.
   9. Configured vncserver to run at boot time, which will start my
   WindowMaker desktop. A VNC Client running in Win-XP served me the
   wonderful WindowMaker desktop.
   9. I installed firefox with "apt-get install mozilla-firefox" and xmms
   using "apt-get install xmms" just like that.
   10. Tested internet access with firefox, it is simply great.
   11. Tested xmms with output plugin set as eSound. It is wonderful. I
   configured eSound to stream to host Win-XP (IP Address of LAN).
   12. Downloaded esound.zip from
   http://www.liquid-reality.de/main/projects/esound. Unzip and run "esd -tcp
   -public" from Win-XP command prompt  to listen the audio ().

   ** How does it work **
   Unlike in other Linux virtualization solutions such as User Mode Linux (or
   the forementioned VMware), special driver software on the host operating
   system is used to execute the coLinux kernel in a privileged mode (known
   as ring 0 or supervisor mode). By constantly switching the machine's state
   between the host OS state and and the coLinux kernel state, coLinux is
   given full control of the physical machine's MMU (i.e, paging and
   protection) in its own specially allocated address space, and is able to
   act just like a native kernel, achieving almost the same performance and
   functionality that can be expected from a regular Linux which could have
   ran on the same machine standalone. Since coLinux uses the same binary
   format for user-space executables as native Linux, coLinux can load and
   run an existing unmodified Linux distribution concurrently with the host
   OS.

Try any recent distro like Fedora
Core/Mandriva/Ubuntu/SuSE/Debian.

Just make sure you run 2.6 kernels.

Your question is far from clear.  If a packet has a 'wrong'
destination MAC, then which host are you calling the 'destination'?

Assuming a reasonable qn..., If you are not on a lan segment that is
not switched, then all packets will be received by all the hosts on
that lan segment, and the network card will drop all packets that are
not destined for it.  With etherreal and the network card in
promiscuous mode, the hardware filtering is turned off.  That is why
you are seeing all packets that are destined to other hosts as well. 
They will be dropped at a higher level in software.
